On the second day, amidst the chaos, Mary found herself forgotten in the nursery. Feeling lost and scared, she alternated between tears and sleep. Mysterious events unfolded around her, with people falling ill and strange sounds echoing through the house. Seeking solace, she ventured into the dining room, finding it abandoned with a meal left unfinished. Feeling thirsty, she drank some wine, unaware of its strength. The sweet drink made her drowsy, and she retreated to her nursery, hearing cries and footsteps outside. As she dozed off, the house fell eerily silent. Mary, unloved and indifferent, pondered on who would care for her now. Alone and neglected, she awaited someone to remember her, as unfamiliar footsteps approached the nursery.|['1.

"Mary pondered the news deeply. Mrs. Crawford revealed her imminent voyage to England to reunite with her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, at Misselthwaite Manor.

As they embarked on their journey to Yorkshire the next day, Mary tried to distance herself from Mrs. Medlock at the railway station. She didn't want to be associated with her.

She had to travel to London against her wishes to fetch her niece, who was the daughter of her deceased sister Maria. Mary, looking sullen in her black attire, sat quietly in the railway carriage. Mrs. Medlock, observing Mary's demeanor, remarked to herself that Mary seemed spoiled and peevish.

Mary's gaze involuntarily shifted towards the woman, Mrs. Medlock, who continued her chatter with increased interest. She shared a tale about a hunchback who married a sweet lady not for money, but out of genuine affection. The lady eventually passed away, leaving the hunchback, Mr. Archibald Craven, withdrawn and peculiar.

The rain poured down heavily outside, making everyone at the station wear waterproofs. Lamps lit up the carriage, and Mrs. Medlock brightened up over their meal. Mary observed her fine bonnet slipping as she dozed off. When she awoke, Mrs. Medlock roused her at a station. A footman helped Mary into a smart carriage, and they set off into the rainy night toward a mysterious manor. Mary peered out, curious about the journey across Missel Moor.

The carriage traveled along a dimly lit road, surrounded by wild and desolate moors. Mrs. Medlock explained that the land was vast and barren, covered only with heather and gorse, inhabited by wild ponies and sheep. The wind howled as they drove through the darkness, passing over rushing water beneath small bridges. Finally, they arrived at a grand, low-built house with dimly lit windows. Mary was led through a maze of corridors to a room with a fire and supper waiting for her. The next morning, a housemaid woke her by lighting the fire. Mary admired the tapestry-covered walls depicting a forest scene.

"Mary was puzzled by Martha's demeanor, as it contrasted with the servants in India. The servants in India were subservient and did not speak to their masters as equals.

After spending several days outdoors, Mary woke up hungry one morning. Instead of pushing her food away, she ate her porridge eagerly until her bowl was empty. Martha mentioned that the fresh air of the moor was giving her an appetite. Martha also commented on how lucky Mary was to have food to eat, unlike some others in their cottage who had empty stomachs. Mary spent her days wandering the gardens and paths, observing things around her. She often visited a long walk outside the walled gardens where ivy grew thickly. There, she encountered Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, which seemed to chirp cheerfully at her. Mary tried to communicate back, feeling a connection with the friendly bird.|"[""1.

She dashed up the path to the green door she had first entered. Then she sprinted down the path to the other door, into the orchard. As she gazed up, the tree stood tall beyond the wall, and the robin finished its song. Walking around, she inspected the orchard wall, finding no door. Running through the kitchen-gardens and along the ivy-covered wall, she searched for a way in but found none. This mystery intrigued her, making her grateful for being at Misselthwaite Manor.

At that moment, something wonderful happened to Mary at Misselthwaite Manor. Four great things had occurred to her since she arrived.

One peculiar morning, a young girl found herself exploring a vast, empty house all alone. She wandered through narrow and wide passages, feeling as if she were the only one to ever set foot there. After trying several closed doors, she finally opened one to reveal a grand bedroom with embroidered hangings and inlaid furniture. Intrigued, she continued to explore, finding rooms filled with old tapestries, curious furniture, and even a cabinet with a hundred tiny ivory elephants. As she played with the elephants, she heard a rustling sound and discovered a little gray mouse with six baby mice living in a cushion. Feeling tired from her adventures, she made her way back, occasionally getting lost in the long corridors.

Mary skipped around the gardens and the orchard, taking breaks every few minutes. Eventually, she reached her special walk and decided to try skipping its entire length. Although it was a long path, she grew hot and breathless halfway through. Pausing, she counted to thirty and spotted a robin perched on a branch. The robin followed her and chirped a greeting.

She paused and listened to the silence. The robin perched on a treetop, unmoving like the rest of the world. Mary tiptoed away from the door, grateful for the grass muffling her steps. Walking under the delicate gray arches of the trees, she gazed at the intricate sprays and tendrils above. If she were Ben Weatherstaff, she could tell if the woods were alive, but to her, they appeared only as gray and brown branches devoid of buds. The sun illuminated the enclosed space, making the blue sky seem even more vibrant. The robin fluttered down, chirping and flitting about, seemingly showing her hidden wonders. Despite the silence and strangeness, she felt content, save for her worry about the garden's roses. Kneeling by a flowerbed, she spotted pale green shoots emerging from the soil.

Mary, feeling pleasantly tired from playing outside, dozed off in an armchair near her. The sun had been shining on the secret garden for almost a week. Mary loved calling it the Secret Garden because it made her feel hidden away in a fairy tale world. She enjoyed being outdoors, running faster and skipping more. She took care of the garden, making the plants happy. Mary was determined and absorbed in her work, finding joy in discovering new sprouts every day. She imagined how beautiful the garden would be when all the flowers bloomed. During that sunny week, Mary got to know Ben Weatherstaff better, surprising him with her sudden appearances. He didn't mind her company as much as before and even found her polite. Mary learned to approach him quietly to not startle him, and they developed a friendly bond.|"['1.

"""That's like him,"" said Ben Weatherstaff. ""Trying to impress the ladies with vanity and showiness. He'll do anything to show off and flirt his tail-feathers. He's as proud as can be."" Ben rarely spoke much, and sometimes he wouldn't even respond to Mary's questions except with a grunt. But on this particular morning, he had more to say. Standing up with one boot on his spade, he observed Mary. ""You're starting to look better,"" he remarked. ""You're a bit plumper and not as pale. When you first arrived, you looked quite miserable. I thought to myself, I've never seen a more unpleasant, sour-faced child."" Mary noticed the robin nearby, looking more charming than ever. His red chest was shiny, and he danced around with grace, seemingly trying to impress Ben. But Ben was not easily swayed. The robin flew closer and sang a little tune, trying to win him over. Ben tried to resist, but eventually, he couldn't help but be enchanted by the robin's antics. It was a moment of magic, and Ben stood in awe, as if under a spell.

Long ago, Ben Weatherstaff learned to care for roses from a lady who loved them like children. He shared his gardening knowledge with Mary, who found joy in the roses. Ben showed her how to spot swelling buds that would bloom after warm rain. Mary, who once disliked people, now felt the world changing for the better. Ben's gruff manner intrigued her, and she began to like him. As Mary explored the secret garden, she encountered a boy playing a pipe under a tree. Animals gathered around to listen, creating a magical scene. Mary felt a sense of wonder and curiosity as she observed the boy and his enchanted audience in the woods.|"['1.

Mary stood still as Dickon rose from the ground, charming the animals around him. The squirrel scampered back up the tree, the pheasant withdrew, and the rabbits hopped away, not out of fear. Mary realized it was Dickon, who had a wide, red smile and a friendly manner. He brought garden tools and seeds, speaking quickly and comfortably. Mary was drawn to his fresh scent of heather and grass, forgetting her shyness. They sat, and Dickon showed her packages of mignonette and poppies, explaining how they bloom. He whistled to call a robin, showing Mary how birds respond to friendship. Dickon's ease with nature fascinated Mary, making her feel at ease too.|"['1.

Mary’s thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She did not know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She had never thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she went red and then pale.

He walked to the nearest tree, an ancient one covered in gray lichen but with new green shoots. Taking out a knife, he pointed out the dead wood that needed cutting. Eagerly, they moved from tree to tree, with Dickon showing Mary how to prune and care for the plants. He explained how to differentiate between live and dead branches, ensuring that the strongest ones thrived. Dickon's expertise with the knife impressed Mary as they worked together.

Mary and Colin were laughing uncontrollably in the room, sharing stories of their adventures with Dickon, Captain, Soot, Nut, Shell, and the pony named Jump. Mary had taken Colin to see the pony, a shaggy moor pony with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose. The pony, Jump, had a special bond with Dickon, communicating in whinnies and snorts. Mary shared how Ben Weatherstaff had compared her to the pony, saying they both had nasty tempers. She also mentioned how an angel in Yorkshire would understand nature and be friends with wild creatures like Dickon. Mary's genuine and natural demeanor brought Colin back to reality, and he listened intently as she described the wonders of the secret garden.

When Dr. Craven entered his patient's room, he was surprised by the scene. Mrs. Medlock opened the door to laughing and chattering. Colin, usually a demanding young gentleman, was sitting up straight in his dressing-gown, engrossed in a garden book with a plain child. The child's face glowed with enjoyment, a stark contrast to Colin's usual fits of rage about fresh air. Dr. Craven, fearing he might lose his inheritance if Colin recovered, was alarmed. Mary suddenly mentioned Dickon, a familiar name on the moor, which visibly relieved Dr. Craven. Colin, known as the Rajah, expressed how his cousin Mary made him forget his illness, unlike other doctors. Dr. Craven, puzzled by the situation, left without giving any new orders, feeling thoughtful and puzzled.

"In the cozy bedroom, a surprising visitor, a large crow, greeted Mr. Roach with a loud ""Caw—Caw"" upon the door's opening. Despite the warning from Mrs. Medlock, Mr. Roach nearly jumped back in surprise. The young Rajah, not in bed or on the sofa, sat in an armchair with a young lamb nearby, fed by Dickon. A squirrel perched on Dickon's back, nibbling a nut. Meanwhile, the girl from India observed from a footstool. Colin announced his plan to go out in his chair that afternoon, requesting privacy along the Long Walk. Mary noticed Colin's quiet demeanor during lunch and asked about it. Colin shared his vision of a grand procession, likening it to the arrival of spring. The nurse prepared Colin, who made an effort to assist and engaged in lively conversation with Mary.

Dickon gently pushed the wheeled chair as Mistress Mary and Colin strolled alongside. Colin, leaning back, gazed up at the sky's vast arch, dotted with small snowy clouds resembling floating white birds. The wind carried a sweet, wild scent down from the moor, filling the air with freshness. As they wandered through the garden paths, deserted of human presence, they marveled at the beauty surrounding them. Upon reaching the Long Walk by the ivied walls, a sense of anticipation enveloped them, prompting hushed whispers.

Mary and Dickon worked here and there while Colin watched. They brought him buds opening and closed, twigs with green leaves, a woodpecker feather, and a bird shell. Dickon spun the chair, showing Colin wonders from earth and trees. It felt like a magical kingdom tour. Dickon mentioned seeing a baby robin soon, busy feeding worms. The noise and chaos in the nest fluster the bird. Mary giggled, covering their mouths, following the whisper rule. The afternoon was full of new discoveries, with golden sunshine.

Birds and animals joined in the fun, pecking at crumbs and enjoying the treats. As the afternoon quieted down, the sun cast a golden light, and everyone relaxed. Colin, now looking natural and at ease, rested comfortably against his cushions. Soot, perched on a branch, seemed ready to doze off.

In the twilight hours, Mrs. Sowerby would sit on the low wall of Dickon's garden, surrounded by flourishing vegetables and fragrant flowers. Dickon, with his magical touch, tended to the plants as if they were his friends, whispering to them and nurturing them with care. Mrs. Sowerby found solace in these moments, listening to Dickon's tales of the day and the happenings at Misselthwaite Manor. She learned of Mester Colin's newfound strength and his secret adventures with Mary and Dickon. The garden was a place of wonder and growth, where even the toughest of vegetables thrived under Dickon's gentle care.

Mrs. Sowerby had a clever idea to help the children. She suggested giving them fresh milk and bread in the morning to curb their hunger while they played in the garden. She knew that growing children like them needed good food to stay healthy. Dickon admired his mother's wisdom, knowing that the children were enjoying themselves. Colin and Mary found joy in their pretend games, a way to protect themselves from suspicion. Colin, feeling better, wanted to keep his progress a secret from his father to avoid disappointment. He feared falling ill again and didn't want any letters sent about his health. His strong emotions made him feel feverish, emphasizing his dislike for being talked about or stared at.|"[""1.

"""The boy has improved remarkably,"" he remarked. ""His progress is almost extraordinary. Now he willingly does what he previously resisted. However, he is still easily agitated, so we must be careful not to upset him.""

Colin sadly mentioned, ""I might have a tantrum. I don't want to, but if they talk about writing to my father, I might have to do something.""

He decided to eat less, but his morning appetite made it challenging, especially with a tempting breakfast set out daily. Mary sympathetically noted that the breakfast was sufficient for someone dying but not for someone living.

One morning, Dickon surprised them with fresh milk and currant buns. This delightful gesture led to more enjoyable moments. They realized that they couldn't burden Mrs. Sowerby with their appetites daily and offered to contribute.

Dickon introduced them to roasting potatoes and eggs in a woodland oven, a new and delicious experience. The Magic circle under the plum-tree continued to work wonders, aiding Colin's progress each day.

One morning, Dickon returned and shared a story about meeting Bob Haworth, a strong wrestler from Thwaite. Bob revealed his secret to building muscles and strength through exercises taught by a showman. Dickon, inspired by Bob's advice, demonstrated the exercises to Colin and Mary. Colin, amazed, started to join in, gradually gaining strength. Even Soot, the watching bird, became restless, unable to mimic the moves. These exercises became a daily routine, alongside their other activities. The children's newfound vigor surprised the household staff, who struggled to understand their sudden appetite and energy. Dr. Craven, upon returning from London, was astonished by Colin's rapid improvement. His once pale complexion now glowed with health, his eyes sparkled, and his hair looked vibrant.

In the garden, Mary and Colin enjoyed the wonders of nature. Mrs. Medlock remarked on the positive changes in Mary, noting her growth and newfound happiness. The secret garden continued to bloom, revealing new miracles each day. The robin and his mate guarded their nest of Eggs with great care, understanding the importance of their delicate contents. Dickon, who could communicate with the robins, was trusted by the birds. The robin, however, was initially wary of Mary and Colin, observing them closely for any signs of danger. The robin's cautious behavior was due to his concern for the Eggs and the potential threats in the garden.

When the boy started walking on his own, it was a huge relief. But the robin was worried because the boy's actions were different from other humans. The robin realized that the boy was learning to walk, just like how the robin learned to fly. The robin's mate found comfort in this thought, believing that the boy was learning at his own pace. The children would often move their arms and legs in unusual ways, puzzling the robin. The robin knew the boy could speak their language, so the bird trusted that the actions were safe. As the boy began to move like the others, peace settled over the nest. The robin enjoyed watching the children's activities, finding it entertaining.
