Harry Donnelle was known for his exceptional fixing skills. He repaired the camouflage for us to watch a chipmunk, showcasing his expertise learned in France. He also fixed the chimney on the cooking shack effortlessly. Despite being a great fixer, he faced a challenge with Mr. Ellsworth, the scoutmaster, who had a way of persuading others to do things his way. However, Harry managed to impress Mr. Ellsworth with his plan to lead the Silver Foxes on an adventurous journey through New York State. The troop was split for the journey home, with the Silver Foxes led by Harry and the Ravens and Elks drifting down the river. The troop members exchanged good wishes and plans for the expedition, ensuring they had a strategy in place in case they didn't all reach their destination together.|['1.

The following day, Wednesday, began early in the morning. The rest of the group planned to start their journey on the houseboat that Saturday. It seemed like the Ravens and Elks stayed up all night creating funny signs on cardboard to tease us, even with the help of Mr. Ellsworth and Uncle Jeb, the camp manager. When we reached the main road, every scout from camp seemed to be there, with signs hanging on all the trees. Despite the humorous signs, we were prepared with supplies like egg powder, bacon, coffee, and more for the hike ahead. Our group had a well-equipped camping setup, ensuring we wouldn't go hungry with plenty of food to last us. Before setting off, we enjoyed sodas at Warner's Drug Store, where Mr. Warner greeted us with a friendly scout smile.|"[""1.

Harry Donnelle instructed the group to line up, signaling the start of their big hike. As they set off towards Saugerties, they shared jokes about wild animals in the Catskills. Harry mentioned the absence of wild cats and foxes, except for a few remaining foxes. Their route led them southwest towards Woodstock, aiming to reach the Ashokan Reservoir by going past West Hurley. By late afternoon, they veered off the road to find a suitable camping spot with good drainage and drinking water. Harry suggested sending some of the group to the nearest village for mosquito repellent, crackers, and meat. Excited about the abundance of fish in the brook, they planned to fish for dinner. Harry decided to stay and fish while sending someone to get supplies. Spotting a path, the narrator took a shortcut to the village through the woods.|['1.

The dense woods made it challenging to follow the trail, overgrown with bushes. After about fifteen minutes, I reached a deserted stone house with boarded-up windows and a slightly ajar door secured by an old, useless padlock. Inside, the dark, damp space lacked a floor, covered in spider webs, indicating abandonment. Peeking inside, I discovered it was likely a spring house with water trickling from rocks. Hurrying out, I left the door slightly ajar. Continuing along the path, I noticed large animal prints with five toes, unlike any local wildlife. The distinct prints alternated between five and four toes, suggesting a large, peculiar creature had passed through. Nearby, a small village with only two houses and a tiny post office stood, offering a variety of goods and emitting a corn-like scent.|['1.

I purchased some lead sinkers, crackers, and chops for Charlie Seabury to make him thirsty before eating fish. I also bought fly paper for our bivouac camp due to the flies at dinner. I joked with the seller about a big animal track I saw, suggesting he secure the village. Carrying my items in a bundle over my back, I headed back, stopping at a spring house for water. I then climbed a tree to scout our camp, but only saw smoke in the west. As I was about to descend, I heard a growl and saw a large animal with spots and a long tail. It approached the tree, making strange noises, resembling a tiger or a wild cat.|"['1.

I was perched up on a branch, facing a fierce animal below. Its eyes glowed like fire, and its tail wriggled menacingly. I was frightened but kept my wits about me. Scouts don't panic; they stay calm. I realized it resembled a leopard, but those are in Africa, not America. I needed to act fast. The creature seemed ready to pounce. I tossed a chop from my bundle, distracting it momentarily. This gave me a chance to think. I had to outsmart it quickly. Instead of being its prey, I used the distraction to my advantage. It's like Mr. Ellsworth says, quick thinking wins battles. I had an idea - an inspiration. I managed to buy a few more moments to plan my next move.|['1.

During a tense moment, I had to think fast. I realized that leopards were as tricky as school exams! I had a plan to outsmart the leopard by throwing a chop to distract it. But I had to act quickly before the leopard got too close. My heart raced as I aimed to throw the chop into the doorway. If I missed, I knew I'd be in trouble. With no time to waste, I considered splitting the chop for a backup plan. But in the end, I decided to go for it and throw the whole chop. The stakes were high, and I had to make a split-second decision to outwit the leopard.|"['1.

I crouched in a tree, scared and shuddering, unsure of what to do next. At first, I thought of dropping down and running, but fear held me back. I was frozen, too afraid to move or even climb higher. I regretted not luring the animal into the house earlier when it would have been trapped. Suddenly, I remembered a story about how natives in India catch tigers using gum-covered leaves. Inspired, I grabbed fly paper and scattered it around the tree. The sticky sheets would trap the animal just like the leaves trapped the tiger. In no time, the ground was covered with fly paper, creating a barrier that would make it hard for the animal to approach.|"[""1.

As I crouched, the wild animal's eyes blazed like fire. A fly paper sheet landed near him, and he pawed at it, mistaking it for food. It clung to his paw, and in his attempt to remove it, he smeared his head. He then stepped on another sheet, causing chaos. More sheets stuck to him, and he howled in distress. Blinded, he stumbled, crashing into a tree and the spring house. Covered in gum, grass, and dirt, he looked far from regal. Tanglefoot, a sticky substance, proved mightier than tanks in incapacitating him. Despite his suffering, I remained safely perched, observing his plight. Blinded and disoriented, he struggled against the tree, worsening his situation. It was a pitiful sight, a reminder of the power of simple traps over sophisticated weapons.|"['1.

When I realized I was safe, I felt sorry for the helpless animal. He couldn't see, which made him anxious. Feeling bad for him, I decided to help. I made a lasso with a rope and descended the tree cautiously. Even though I was scared, I knew I had to be kind. I tried to loop the noose over his head, but he was restless. Eventually, I succeeded and secured the rope to a tree. After climbing down, I left him in peace, promising to return. As I walked away, I reassured him and explained the tracks I had seen earlier. Despite my fear, I showed compassion for the trapped animal, understanding that everyone deserves respect, even in the wild.|"['1.

Harry Donnelle was contemplating the situation carefully. He decided not to harm the magnificent leopard he had found. Instead, he asked two kids to fetch a wheelbarrow from the village. Harry tied up the leopard's feet with rope while they waited. Soon, the entire village arrived, including the postmaster, Hunt, and Westy with a wheelbarrow. Harry planned to find a way to remove the fly paper from the leopard without hurting him. A man named Hasbrook offered to keep the leopard in his barn overnight. They carefully placed the tied-up leopard in the wheelbarrow and headed back to the village. Harry mentioned that he would seek help from the Historical Museum and avoid using gasoline near a lamp. He shared his experience of being shot in France and emphasized the importance of staying safe. The kids were grateful to have met such a kind and knowledgeable person like Harry.|"['1.

Yesterday, during a routine transfer of a leopard at Costello’s Circus, the animal got frightened by the brass band playing. It escaped by forcing its way out of the cage and ran through the circus grounds. Efforts to shoot it were unsuccessful, and it ran into the nearby fields. The leopard was last spotted near Merritt’s hill. Circus staff and volunteers armed themselves to locate and deal with the animal. The owner, Mr. Rinaldo Costello, assured citizens that the leopard would likely avoid people. The leopard, named Marshall Foch, was valued at over six thousand dollars and was known for its unique five toes on the fore paws and four on the hind paws. Despite being docile in captivity, adult leopards are challenging to capture. The circus staff camped out to handle the situation, and a boy scout eventually captured the leopard alive.|"[""1.

"Harry Donnelle mentioned, “I think Mr. Rinaldo Costello will send an impressive show after Marshal Foch once he receives our incredible letter.” We were lounging by the fire when Harry, in his usual teasing manner, joked about Costello's show. Suddenly, the word ""adventurer"" sparked my curiosity. Harry then mentioned the high cost of mysteries and offered me one at a wholesale price if I fetched his cigarette case. I returned, and we discussed the two hundred dollars found at Temple Camp, which caused quite a stir. Harry explained that the money was his and shared an adventure about a narrow escape involving Skinny McCord at the camp.

One day, a man convinced me to join him for a fishing trip instead of facing my sister's friends for tea and tennis. Feeling like a coward, I opted for the fishing adventure with Jake to avoid the social gathering. As we headed to the old house-boat near my home, the scene was eerie with the early morning darkness. While waiting for Jake, unexpected voices of Boy Scouts, including my father and his friends, disrupted my plan. Escaping the scouts, we set sail to Coney Island's coast, catching various sea creatures. Despite a brewing storm, I insisted on staying for more fishing, leading to a risky situation where our anchor might have been dragging.|"[""Question 1: Why did the narrator choose to go on a fishing trip with Jake instead of attending the social gathering?\nA) They wanted to catch sea creatures\nB) They were feeling like a coward\nC) They needed to escape the Boy Scouts\nD) They wanted to explore Coney Island's coast\nE) They were excited about the storm brewing"", ""Question 2: What disrupted the narrator's plan while waiting for Jake at the old house-boat?\nA) Unexpected voices of Boy Scouts\nB) Arrival of the narrator's sister\nC) Sudden rainstorm\nD) Jake's delayed arrival\nE) Arrival of the narrator's friends"", ""Question 3: Where did the narrator and Jake set sail to for their fishing trip?\nA) Old house-boat near the narrator's home\nB) Coney Island's coast\nC) Local fishing market\nD) Boy Scouts' campsite\nE) Tea and tennis club"", ""Question 4: What risky situation did the narrator's insistence on staying for more fishing lead to?\nA) Running out of bait\nB) Losing their fishing equipment\nC) Anchor dragging due to a brewing storm\nD) Getting lost at sea\nE) Running out of daylight"", 'Question 5: What was the mood of the scene as the narrator and Jake headed to the old house-boat?\nA) Excitement\nB) Fear\nC) Sadness\nD) Confusion\nE) Happiness', 'Question 6: What did the narrator feel like when deciding to go fishing with Jake instead of facing the social gathering?\nA) Brave\nB) Excited\nC) Cowardly\nD) Relieved\nE) Proud']"|"['B) They were feeling like a coward', 'A) Unexpected voices of Boy Scouts', ""B) Coney Island's coast"", 'C) Anchor dragging due to a brewing storm', 'B) Fear', 'C) Cowardly']"
We pulled up the anchor and attempted to start our engine, but it was malfunctioning. The plug was causing a short circuit, the coil was behaving erratically, and the carburetor was flooded with water. To add to our troubles, the pump was not working properly. We found ourselves in a difficult situation, stranded in the middle of the ocean as the land faded into the distant horizon. Throughout the night, we battled the waves, constantly bailing out water to prevent the boat from sinking. By morning, the weather improved slightly, allowing us to use the oar to steer. We eventually came across a swamped lifeboat with a deceased man inside, along with some intriguing items in his pockets. It was a challenging ordeal, but we managed to navigate through it.|['1.

"Alright, there isn’t much more to tell. We found a man in a boat, but we couldn't tell how long he had been there or what happened to him. The boat was barely afloat, with a name that was hard to read. We suspected it might be the _Lady Anne_. The man seemed like a rough sailor. We couldn't rescue him due to the weight on our boat. So, we searched his pockets and found a weather wallet with money and a smeared letter signed ""Father."" We kept the money and the letter for safekeeping. Eventually, we were rescued by a schooner.

The main reason we used fake names was to hide the fact that I had left camp without permission to go on a fishing trip. I didn't want anyone, especially my family, to know. When I returned to Bridgeboro, the houseboat I needed to change my clothes was gone. The boy scouts had taken my uniform, leaving me in a tough spot. I tracked down the houseboat to Staten Island and met a scout named Roy who helped me change. Unfortunately, I left $207 in the locker, which caused some trouble for another scout. Back at camp, I got in trouble for being late. The letter I found on a dead man mentioned a ring with a Lincoln cameo. I imagine an old Civil War veteran struggling to make ends meet, warning his son about dangers in France. Looking into the campfire, I can almost see him writing that letter.|"['1.

I have a hunch that the old man sent the kid a ring with President Lincoln's head on it. I picture Honest Abe right by the blazing fire. Maybe it's just a crazy idea, but I think the old man got the ring before going to war. I wonder where that village is. I might be a daydreamer, but I've had this story in my mind since fishing with Jake Holden. It all fits when I look into the fire. It's a good campfire tale, right? I could see the whole thing in the blaze, especially the old man. Maybe not true, but I could see it. Harry found a letter with money, but it's odd for a sailor missing a finger to wear a ring on it. Maybe the sailor took money from a soldier. I'd like to find the man who got the ring years ago and help him. And the soldier warned of robbery? Maybe he got robbed.

Harry welcomed Mr. Costello to their temporary camp, introducing him as part of their touring group. Mr. Costello praised Roy, known as the Leopard Catcher, for his bravery. Harry then playfully presented Roy to Mr. Costello. As they walked to the barn, Mr. Costello strutted confidently. Roy admired the fancy cage wagon with gold mermaids, imagining the fun Dorry had riding in it. Roy wished he could be in the wagon with Marshal Foch, the leopard. Dreaming of being in a parade, Roy mused about his love for hiking and apple pie. He admired how Mr. Costello handled the leopards and imagined a friendship between Marshal Foch and the man.|['1.

When they returned, the keeper led Marshal Foch with a rope, and the fly paper was gone from his head and body. Harry Donnelle mentioned that they removed the stickum with gasoline, causing little harm to the leopard. The keeper had a pistol, but it seemed to be for safety. The leopard cooperated and walked into the wagon. Mr. Costello announced that the people of Kingston would have the chance to see the hero for free. He suggested Roy the Redoubtable or Blakeley the Bold for the parade. He asked if Roy could look fierce and fearless. Mr. Costello assured that the advance agent would inform the town.

Harry Donnelle sat on the fence, laughing so hard I thought he might fall off. The other boys teased me, calling me a fool for being scared of the circus. They wished they had the chance to be in the show. But I had never been in a circus before and didn't want to sit up high on the fancy wagon just to look fierce. The wagon had big red shutters with gold designs to hide Marshal Foch, the lion. Mr. Costello, the ringmaster, drove the wagon expertly, cracking his whip loudly. As we entered Kingston, circus posters covered the store windows and fences. Mr. Costello praised me for my bravery, using fancy words that all started with the same letter. Inside a side tent, we sat at a mess board like at camp. I sat next to Judge Dot, a midget, and Lieutenant Lemuel Long, the thin man. Madame Whopper, the fat lady, ate a lot of pie.

The most intriguing character was Jib Jab, a peculiar creature with fur like a bear but a man-like head. Despite his intimidating appearance in pictures, he was not exactly human or animal. Initially scared to dine with him, the sight of him approaching the table was a real shock. Judge Dot classified him as part of the menagerie class, not a typical freak, necessitating his presence in a cage.

When we returned to the circus grounds, I spotted Harry Donnelle and the patrol, along with some other scouts waiting. I hurried down to join them. Mr. Costello came out and commended me, calling me the idol of the crowd. Thirsty from the day's events, I relished the praise. Harry Donnelle chuckled at the situation. Mr. Costello even suggested taking me to Europe to meet nobility, but Harry quipped that I could barely handle one continent in my pocket. We were all given tickets to the show that night. Mr. Costello praised me, mentioning how esteemed I was by the side show's personalities. He advised me not to speak too much about Jib Jab's humanity, leaving it to the audience to decide. As we mingled with the scouts from Newburgh, who had visited Elm Center, we attended the show together. Later, I bid farewell to the side show performers with Dorry Benton. The freaks were preparing for bed, and Mr. Lemuel Long joked about scouts' hearty appetites. Judge Dot teased about his height, claiming he was shrinking due to age. He vowed to demand more money from Mr. Costello if he continued to shrink. Madame Whopper's weight gain led to a raise, a decision influenced by the rising cost of living.|"['1.

Jib Jab had just finished washing his face, revealing his handsome features with curly hair and bright eyes. He changed into a bathrobe and lounged on a chair, putting his feet up. Dorry was amazed by Jib Jab's appearance and the fur covering he had. Jib Jab lit a cigarette and expressed his disdain for the civilized world, missing the simplicity of the jungle. He mentioned feeling out of place among the circus performers, feeling like an outsider and facing jealousy from others.

"He mentioned, ""It's suitable anyhow. I'd love to visit a camp like Temple Camp; it must be amazing. Our tough luck has been a challenge. I think making biscuits is even harder than our luck."" Then he explained, ""At first, our scoutmaster had to leave for war when we were just starting. It was a big blow. We tried to find a replacement, but scoutmasters were rare; they were scarcer than coal and sugar. They were all in France. So, I took on the role. We could find one now, but since we managed without one all this time, we decided to wait for our scoutmaster's return in a couple of weeks. We've saved two dollars and fourteen cents for a welcome back gift—actually, two dollars and four cents, with a Canadian dime. Our little cabin burned down, leaving us without a meeting spot. But we still have our scout spirit; it's priceless. If they had a price, we couldn't afford it."" He assured, ""Initially, it was tough, but we've grown to enjoy it. We're making the most of our hard luck. All we need now is time. This winter, we plan to work on Saturdays. Unfortunately, that won't help us prepare a warm welcome for our scoutmaster.

Adventure may be exciting, but mowing lawns is a sure way to earn money. The narrator's friend joked about their failed adventure and the importance of practical work.

Suddenly, a small light flickered among the trees not too far from where I sat. It appeared, disappeared, then reappeared. At first, I thought it might be a firefly, but it was too large. After watching it steadily for a minute, it vanished. Curious, I got up quietly and cautiously approached the spot in the darkness. Although not exactly scared, I felt a nervous excitement. As the patrol leader, I had the right to ask why my companion had moved away. I noticed a piece of newspaper in his pocket and jokingly pulled it out. To my surprise, it featured a picture of Jib Jab, a character known for his mischievous look. I was captivated by the image, feeling as though Jib Jab was speaking to me.

It's important to consider carefully before doing a good deed. Rushing into it can lead to unexpected trouble. Jib Jab had welcomed us, so Harry suggested waiting until after the show to visit him.

Harry was sharing a story with his friends when he mentioned a boy named Gaylong, who seemed to always have bad luck. He told them how luck can strike unexpectedly, like when Charlie Collins met his own brother in France while on duty. Harry believed the world was as small as a coconut and shared stories of encounters like Stanley meeting Livingstone in South Africa. Despite his wild nature, Harry showed kindness to little Willie, putting his arm around him. He painted a vivid picture of Old Grouch Gaylong in a scout uniform with many sarcastic badges. Harry even pointed out a face in the flame, which turned out to be Mr. Jennis. As the group watched, Brent Gaylong's face appeared in the fire, along with Jib Jab, creating a sense of curiosity and wonder among them.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a group of friends embarked on a thrilling adventure through the countryside. They camped in Greendale, where they met old Major Chandler, Mr. Wade, and Horace, and had a blast enjoying the farm's dandy russet apples and delicious apple dumplings made by Horace's sister, Betty. As they journeyed through Woodstock, they were warned about poets, authors, and artists in the woods, but they found them harmless. Passing by the Ashokan Reservoir, they reached the Wallkill River and camped near New Paltz, close to a school. The next day, they caught perch for supper and shared stories around the campfire. Moving on, they encountered Tanner's Crossroads and the village of Slow before finally reaching the Hudson River, where they had a big adventure.|['1.

I was frustrated with the operator as I needed to reach my sister by ten o’clock, but she was delaying me. With just three minutes left, I made contact. A distressed voice explained they were lost on Eagle’s Nest Mountain since 5 o’clock, hungry and scared. They asked for help to inform Judge Edwards in Haverstraw. I assured them we would rescue them, as navigating trails was our expertise. I calmed them by saying mountains weren’t frightening. They were surprised by the phone's presence.

Just sit there and tell riddles until you spot us. Which path leads to Eagle's Nest?"" He advised taking the west road from Haverstraw until reaching a large white house with a windmill. Beyond that, a cow path through fields would lead to the woods. We'd find a trail to the mountain with caution for other paths branching off. It wouldn't reach the peak directly, explaining why they couldn't find it descending. Upon sharing with Westy, he rushed to Haverstraw while I gathered the others at camp. Harry eagerly joined, and we set off north, passing the white house with the windmill. After some confusion, we located the mountain trail near a prominent rock.

As we hiked up the mountain, the trail became rocky, making it challenging to navigate in the dark. Suddenly, we heard a noise and saw a dark figure moving away. The higher we climbed, the denser the forest became, with tall trees and thick underbrush. Following the trail single file, we used a lantern to light our way. We caught a strong smell of burning leaves, but it would come and go with the breeze. The crackling sound grew louder, indicating a fire approaching. We followed the scent, pushing through the underbrush, trying to stay ahead of the approaching flames. The fire appeared like a line of soldiers charging up the mountain, advancing quickly towards us. Despite the fear, we pressed on, hoping to outrun the encroaching blaze.|['1.

That night was unforgettable. We pushed through the brush, stumbling and falling, helping each other. Our clothes were torn, and we panted like dogs. The crackling was loud, smoke filled the air. The fire rushed uphill, leaving little chance for us. Despite the danger, we worked together. One girl sobbed, fearing the fire getting closer. Another tried to calm her.

We ignited the brush near the cleared area closest to the fire. If the wind blew in that direction, the fire would have spread towards the other one. However, it had to fight the wind, which was challenging. Our clearing acted as a barrier, but sparks flew across it. Harry, struggling to speak due to exhaustion, urged us to move to the opposite side of the mountain quickly. Will suggested finding water, as there must be a source nearby. He proposed following a stream downhill. Despite the difficult terrain, Harry assured us the fire wouldn't descend as rapidly. Will emphasized the importance of water in guiding us.

The stream flowed down the mountain's west slope, guiding us through rocky terrain. Will Dawson's advice proved true as we followed the brook. It ensured an easier descent without the uphill struggle of the east side. The water led us swiftly and kept us hydrated. Despite navigating steep sections, we saved time and space. As we trekked, distant flames signaled the fire's advance. Reaching open land, we encountered a road, leaving the brook behind. Harry's Packard swiftly transported us to safety in Haverstraw. The townsfolk watched the mountain blaze, a sight we hadn't considered while on the peak. Our quick actions were praised, showing that in emergencies, action speaks louder than words.|"[""1.

I could see the danger we faced even more clearly now. It seemed as though everyone in the village thought we had perished in the flames up on the mountain. The dark figure we spotted earlier was likely responsible for the chaos. It was a lesson learned to never toss matches carelessly and always extinguish campfires thoroughly. When we reached Judge Edwards’ house, a curious crowd swarmed us, eager to hear how we survived. They believed we had perished in the fire. Mrs. Edwards warmly embraced us all and treated us to coconut frosted cake and hot coffee. We reminisced about our adventures and the sweet taste of home. The next day, we journeyed back home, sticking to the trail like a tightrope. Finally, we arrived in Bridgeboro, greeted by the familiar sight of Bradly’s Cash Grocery, signaling our safe return.
