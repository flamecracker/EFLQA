Many authors have faced the injustice of being known for just one book. For instance, Defoe's masterpiece was not only Robinson Crusoe, and Bunyan's talent extended beyond Pilgrimâ€™s Progress. Similarly, Blackmore's Lorna Doone overshadowed other equally charming novels. Johanna Spyri, known for Heidi, also wrote captivating stories overlooked by many. Heidi, a timeless tale, introduces a lovable character, but Spyri's Cornelli offers a deeper narrative. In Cornelli, the sensitive heroine faces unjust suspicions, a common theme among children. The story unfolds with a diverse cast of characters, from lively children to humorous grown-ups, set against a backdrop of spring. As a young girl races through the woods, her encounters with the wind and nature mirror the themes of resilience and growth found in Spyri's lesser-known works.|"[""1.

"""Oh, Martha,"" the child exclaimed, ""I wish you could experience the wonderful wind today in the woods and on the hill.

Cornelli dashed past the closed doors and entered the isolated house overlooking the stream where her father, engrossed in a newspaper, sat at the table.

The lady expressed her disappointment at the child's appearance, contrasting her with the neat and lovely Cornelia. She described the child as wild and fierce, like a little kitten ready to pounce.

"""Why must Cornelli learn embroidery now?"" asked the friend. ""She has beautiful books to read; she has shown us some. Don't you prefer reading a story to playing in the stable, child?""

""We shouldn't listen to her,"" said Miss Dorner. ""When Cornelli is bored, she will read her books. Please, Miss Mina, watch over Cornelli. Silly things like this shouldn't happen again.""

""You don't need to do such silly things,"" scolded Miss Mina on the stairs. ""I have enough to do without watching you change dresses every few hours.""

Cornelli looked surprised. Mina seemed to understand and left the room. Cornelli, feeling upset, threw a dress out the window. Mina returned with the dress, finding Cornelli looking down at the yard crossly.

The next day, Cornelli happily walked with her teacher, forgetting the previous day's troubles. Mr. Malinger asked for a rose, and Cornelli gathered a bunch for him. They parted warmly.

Dino praised Mux for his cleverness, even though he didn't want to draw the goat. Instead, he decided to draw two brown horses, one trotting and the other walking. The Director was drawn to the dining room by the beautiful singing of Agnes and Cornelli. Impressed by Mux's flawless recitation, the Director found stunning drawings of his brown horses and a breathtaking painting of his cherished childhood view. Cornelli expressed her love for the picture and shared her dreams of starting a singing school with Agnes. The Director approved of the idea and suggested celebrating with chocolate. He also planned for a school on his estate, where children of busy mothers could learn to sing. Additionally, he assigned tasks to Nika, Dino, and Mux to contribute to the estate's upkeep.|"['1.
