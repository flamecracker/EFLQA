The boys decided to hold contests on Baker's Plain that Saturday. Kites soared, some crashing into rocks. Girls, including Dora Stanhope and her cousins, watched. Dick paid special attention to Dora, while his brothers did the same with the Laning sisters. Later, a girl shared a dream involving the boys in a forest facing danger.|"['1.

"When night fell, the lights of Boma shimmered quietly over the town's bay. The ship anchored among others, ending the long ocean journey. ""I heard a French sailor say he hates land,"" Sam added. ""He hasn't set foot ashore in three years."" The Rovers decided to stay on board until morning. The boys couldn't sleep, wondering about their upcoming hunt. Along the river were warehouses and crowded streets where trading took place. The population was a mix of Europeans and greasy-looking natives.

"""Dick, although we were never close, I can't bear to see anyone suffer,"" said Dick as he handed Baxter thirty shillings, a generous gesture considering Baxter's financial struggles. Baxter, surprised by the unexpected kindness, brightened up at the sight of the money. The day was eventful as Randolph Rover prepared for their expedition in Congo. They stocked up on supplies and enlisted the help of Cujo, a knowledgeable native guide. Cujo warned them of the dangers ahead and formed a bond with Aleck. Meanwhile, Dan Baxter, who had been hovering around them, proposed to join their journey.

At eight o'clock, they set off on foot instead of horseback, heeding the advice of a local who warned against the challenges horses would pose. Leaving the town behind, they journeyed along a highway flanked by lush tropical vegetation, teeming with palms, mangoes, and sprawling vines. The air was filled with the scent of decaying plant life, and the ground was dark and muddy. Two days passed without incident, except for a close call when Sam got stuck in a treacherous swamp. After a rest, they continued their trek, mindful of the dangers lurking in the unfamiliar terrain.

The wide highway became uneven, forcing them to leap over treacherous swamps. Mr. Rover was relieved they hadn't brought horses. The jungle teemed with birds of all sizes and colors, some singing melodiously while others were grating. Traveling up a hill, they lost sight of the Congo River. Cujo recommended this shortcut through a forest of towering African teak trees. Randolph Rover cautioned vigilance in this unfamiliar territory. They lodged in a hostelry with separate rooms. Alert to danger, they concealed their weapons. A native woman led them outside, shadowed by Aleck. Suddenly, attackers surrounded them, overpowering them and rendering them prisoners.

After a long journey, the group arrived at a small clearing by the Congo River, with a log hut once used as a fort. Covered in vines, it was hidden but still usable. The men tied Randolph Rover and Dick to the walls. As the uncomfortable hours passed, the former bully of Putnam Hall revealed they were prisoners for ransom. Dick stood his ground against the bully's threats. Suddenly, a call alarmed them. They fled into the jungle, using vines to climb trees to escape pursuers. Tom's swollen ankle was tended to with water from a nearby pool. Cujo led the way, scouting before they set off on a new path, avoiding capture.|"['1.

Pop and Cujo prepared a meal by starting a fire and cooking fowl and roots. Tom, despite a swollen ankle, enjoyed the meal. They journeyed through a dense forest with beautiful ferns and sharp vines. After resting, Tom bathed his foot in a pool, feeling better. While observing a monkey, they encountered a snake. The snake, fixated on Tom, prepared to strike.

Tom fired his pistol, and the snake slithered away. Startled, they ran far from the scene. Reloading quickly, they heard Cujo calling. He found Captain Villaire's group at the old fort, guarded by French brigands. They planned to approach at night. Angry at the desertion by other natives, they neared the swamp and the Congo River bank. In the dark, they moved silently towards the cliff. Cujo subdued a French sentinel, signaling the others to join. They disarmed the Frenchman, tied him up, and retreated to safer ground. Cujo climbed the cliff cautiously, warning of the danger.

The torch hit Tom's neck, risking his grip on the vines by the jagged rocks below. Luckily, the torch slipped away into the dark waters, and Cujo reached the cliff's top, chasing after Baxter. Cujo knocked Baxter unconscious with a powerful blow. Tom called for help from the cliff, directing the company to surround the swamp. Shots were fired, injuring a Frenchman. Captain Villaire warned of betrayal, prompting the brigands to vanish into the woods. Victory favored our friends. Randolph Rover, seated in the fort, tended to his bruised finger after the fight. The boys, with minor wounds, were relieved. Baxter, now a prisoner, feared his fate. Dick revealed how Captain Villaire planned to torture them for ransom.

After a satisfying meal from Captain Villaire's supplies, Cujo bundled up some remaining goods lost by the deserters hired by Randolph Rover. Pushing on until late, they rested in the village of Rowimu. The following week brought a hunting trip yielding birds and an antelope. Progressing deeper into the jungle, Cujo guided them to safety. The expedition encountered various towns and villages, transitioning to an area dominated by black inhabitants. Cujo inquired about King Susko and discovered another American party collecting plant specimens. As predicted, a storm hit while they were in a teak and rosewood forest, causing chaos. Seeking shelter under rocks, they faced the storm's fury. The eerie atmosphere, with monkeys and birds in a frenzy, added to the tension.|"['1.

"He crouched between two large rocks, and the others followed suit as a tropical hurricane roared in. Tree branches and vines flew past, birds swept by like chips in a river. ""Keep down!"" shouted Randolph Rover, but the elements drowned his voice. The wind passed, rain poured, turning hollows to pools. Lightning struck, thunder roared. A baobab tree crashed, flames burst. Rain continued, making everyone miserable. They tried to start a fire but failed. Cold, water-soaked food made them feel wretched. The sun emerged, evaporating the rain. The hurricane had left broken trees, washed-out riverbanks, and dead animals. They met unfriendly natives who knew of King Susko's recent passage. The mountain where he headed was said to be full of gold and haunted by a ghost warrior. Despite the warnings, Cujo led them towards the mountain. The natives' attitudes turned cold, hinting at trouble ahead. The college party was nearby, possibly causing tensions with the locals.

Dick had lost his pistol earlier but found it among the leaves, fully loaded. When he shot at the lion, the bullet only grazed the beast. The lion, wounded, roared and prepared to attack. Dick managed to hit the lion's forepaw, causing the beast immense pain. As Dick tried to reload, he realized he was out of bullets. Just in time, shots from Tom and Mr. Rover hit the lion, killing it. Chester and Cujo examined the lion and found a bullet from Chester's rifle.

Tom was correct. Chester informed them that the former Putnam Hall teacher was missing. He had left to search for a rare flower around the lake. Dick decided to take matters into his own hands.

"""It's like a romance, this search after your father,"" Chester told Dick. ""I hope you find him. You can rest assured that our party will do all we can for you. Specimen hunting is all well enough, but man hunting is far more interesting."" They had crossed a small plain and were now navigating rough rocks covered in thorny scrub brush and vines. The thorns bothered everyone except Cujo, who skillfully avoided them. During their journey, they encountered wild animals, and Sam even caught a mischievous monkey that bit him. After discussing their next steps, Cujo, Randolph Rover, and Dick proceeded cautiously, facing dangers along narrow paths and rocky ledges. A sudden attack by the Bumwos led to a brief but intense battle, with Tom's quick actions saving the group from harm.
