In the wintertime, Jack armed himself with a horn, a pickaxe, and a shovel. Under the cover of the dark evening, he journeyed to the Mount and began digging a deep pit, 22 feet in depth and nearly as wide. Concealing it with sticks, straw, and loose soil to mask the hole, Jack waited. At dawn, he stood on the opposite side of the pit from the giant's cave, blowing the horn loudly to awaken the giant. Enraged, the giant charged at Jack, threatening him. However, Jack remained composed and taunted the giant before defeating him with a swift blow to the head.

Once upon a time, there was a widow with two sons. She sent her eldest son to fetch water from the well to bake a cake for his journey. The amount of water he brought would determine the size of the cake. Unfortunately, the can broke, and most of the water spilled. His cake turned out small. His mother offered him half with her blessing or the whole with her curse. He chose the whole cake, accepting the curse. Before leaving, he gave his brother a knife, instructing him to check its condition daily. If it stayed clear, he was safe, but if it rusted, danger had befallen him. On his travels, he encountered a shepherd who spoke of the Red Ettin of Ireland. Seeking refuge from terrifying beasts, he found shelter in a castle, unaware that the Red Ettin owned it.

The next morning, the younger brother examined the rusty knife, prompting him to announce his departure to his mother. Reluctant at first, she asked him to fetch water with a can for a cake. While carrying the water, a raven warned him of the leaking can. He quickly used clay to seal the holes, ensuring enough water for a large cake. His mother offered him half with her blessing, but he chose the whole instead of her curse. As he journeyed, he met an old woman who, after sharing his cake, gifted him a magic wand. The fairy foretold his future encounters and vanished. He encountered a shepherd who revealed the sheep belonged to the Red Ettin of Ireland. The shepherd prophesied the younger brother's role in defeating the Ettin and inheriting his land. Despite encountering terrifying beasts and the Ettin's castle, he fearlessly used the wand to defeat the Ettin and free the captives.
