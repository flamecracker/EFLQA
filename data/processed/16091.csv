Every hour, the clock chimed in the hallway outside, its sound reaching Dorothy in her room. Her mind raced with plans until exhaustion threatened to derail them. As the noises outside faded, Dorothy managed to drift off to sleep, only to wake abruptly at five o'clock. A knock on the door signaled Miss Bell's arrival, ready for the day. The other nurse, engrossed in a novel, paid Dorothy little attention before leaving momentarily. Seizing the opportunity, Dorothy quickly changed into a plain linen dress and cap from the suitcase. A new disguise in place, she hesitated briefly before venturing out for a breath of fresh air, hoping to evade suspicion and make her escape towards the barn and water behind the institution.|"['1.

Everyone appeared occupied, cleaning the horses and tending to the stables. Cheerful morning chatter filled the air, and Dorothy, mistaken for a nurse, noticed the light-hearted banter that followed her presence. She found solace in the camaraderie within the stone walls. Suddenly, chaos erupted as a horse bolted towards the terrace where patients were with guards. Despite the commotion, Dorothy seized the chance to escape by boat unnoticed. Paddling skillfully, she shed her nurse attire, concealing her true identity. Consulting her compass, she steered towards Everglade, hoping to reunite with her anxious loved ones.

Dorothy had a sudden realization, a first for her. Two polite young men in canoes were gazing at her, but they remained silent. Dorothy longed to talk to them, feeling they were unaware of her situation. The men mentioned missing people in the woods every summer, hinting at a similar case.

"""It's amazing how some places can remain hidden,"" Dorothy whispered, cautious. ""It's like they fear being exposed. Look, that spot seems where the canoeists landed. Wait, it's further up, near the willow. We must dock there and search. I wish I could have--but wishing won't help."" A sense of dread crept over Dorothy as she entered the woods again, but she bravely decided it was a matter of facts, not memories. Tavia must be somewhere in those woods, she had to be. ""We need to find her,"" said one of the men. The boys from Camp Capital and their neighbors gathered for a discussion in the woods. They learned about a young girl's escape and a man, Morrison, who had fled earlier. Dorothy overheard it all. ""He rambles about a girl who should inherit his uncle's fortune,"" the man explained. ""He's into theater."" ""But what happened to the girl he took?"" Ned asked. The man worried about recapturing escapees, especially with the girl's wealthy widow mother involved.

Dorothy bravely navigated through the dark woods, jumping from rock to stone and over bushes and brambles. As the sun began to set, she heard her friends calling out to her. Cologne, trying to catch up, was too scared and surprised to make much progress. Dorothy paused and listened, reaching a clearing where she climbed a fir tree to get a better view. From the treetop, she spotted something white in the distance. Meanwhile, Cologne turned back as the boys arrived, and Nat insisted on continuing the search for Tavia. The group eventually made their way down the cliffs, with Dorothy and her father, Major Dale, exchanging loving words. Dorothy decided not to reveal all her recent troubles to her father, only mentioning her time at the sanitarium.
