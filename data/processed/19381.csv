Let me introduce you to the farmyard animals. It's important to get to know them as they work for us, and maybe some of us work for them too. Helping each other is a vital part of life. Although the farmyard animals may not look or talk like us, they are not so different. For example, the little Chicken who refused to eat gravel when scolded by his mother was relatable. I have many stories to share about our outdoor neighbors, like animals thinking, talking, working, and loving their babies. Animals even help each other in times of trouble. I once had a Quail visit my door during winter, seeking warmth. Animals have their ways of communicating and showing care, just like the Horses who wished the farmer understood their happiness.

The Swallow embarked on a journey with two young Doves, flying over farms, rivers, and towns with bustling children entering large buildings. They reached a vast lake where they lost sight of land. The Swallow shared how they navigated, following their instincts. After crossing the lake, they landed, and an intriguing event unfolded. The young Doves, eager to hear more, got distracted by the farmer's activities. When they returned, the Swallow was gone, leaving the Doves disappointed. Meanwhile, the Sheep family, known for their kindness, brought warmth to the farm during cold weather. Their presence uplifted the other animals, creating a harmonious and cozy atmosphere in the Sheep-shed. The farmer ensured the shed was well-maintained, providing comfort to all the animals during the chilly March winds.|"['1.

On a bleak morning, the soft bleating of the first Lamb signals its arrival. Day by day, more Lambs join the flock, tiny and awkward, learning to stand and walk. They quickly grasp the art of eating, fueling their growth. Lambs initially feed on warm milk from their mothers, who consume hay, grass, and turnips to produce it. The milk is a delight, causing them to wiggle and wag their tails in joy. One Lamb with a long tail grows vain, teasing others about their tails until his wise mother advises against it. She explains that tails are trimmed to prevent discomfort as wool grows. The Lamb learns humility and refrains from boasting, realizing that tail length doesn't define him.|"['1.

"""That's what I mean,"" his mother said. ""You should be glad. When it's done, you can join me in the field. Men look after things for us; that's their job, to care for us Sheep."" The little Lamb regretted boasting. He no longer acted superior. He wondered why they didn't have short tails from the start. Asking his uncle, an old Wether Sheep, he got a laugh.

In the henhouse, the fowls inspected the eggs. Among them was a shiny white egg that caught everyone's attention. The Bantam hen admired its beauty, while the Dorking Hen declared she would hatch it for a special chicken with shining feathers. Determined, she rolled the other eggs away but struggled with the slippery shiny one. Frustrated, she pushed all the eggs out of the nest, breaking two. The Dorking Hen bragged to others about the extraordinary chicken she anticipated, believing its lightness meant greatness. Despite her grand expectations, only a common chicken hatched from another egg. Disappointed, she shared her disappointment with the Dorking Cock, who left in disdain.|"[""1.

The rooster had boasted to the other Cocks about the shiny egg that was soon to hatch, bragging about his Dorking lineage. The Black Spanish Cock, however, found the fuss unnecessary, pointing out the oddity of Dorkings having an extra toe. Suddenly, chaos ensued as the Dorking Hen cried out about a Weasel in the henhouse. The Cocks rushed to protect the flock, while the Hens watched nervously. Amidst the commotion, the Dorking Hen accidentally knocked the shiny egg to the ground, revealing a shivering Chick. The Black Spanish Hen criticized the rooster's behavior, while the Bantam Hen comforted the Dorking Hen and suggested warming the Chick under her wings.

Mrs. Dorking chatted with the Bantam near her nest while the Black Spanish Hen buried shiny egg pieces. The Shanghai Cock scolded the Dorking Cock for being rude to Mrs. Dorking. The Dorking Cock apologized and they became friends. The Dorkings are now well-liked in the poultry yard. Meanwhile, the Duck hatched her first Duckling, which excited everyone. The Ducks and Geese on the farm got along well. The first Duckling hatched, and everyone gathered around to see it break free from the shell. The Drake proudly compared the Duckling to its mother.

"""That is so,"" said the Black Spanish Cock. ""You do look alike; the same white feathers, the same broad breast, the same strong wings, the same pointed tail, the same long neck, the same sweet expression around the bill!"" That was just like the Black Spanish Cock. He always said something pleasant about people when he could, and it was much better than saying unpleasant things. Indeed, he was the most polite fowl in the poultry-yard, and the Black Spanish Hen thought his manners quite perfect.

Then the Duckling's five aunts pushed their way through the crowd to the nest under the edge of the strawstack. ""Have you noticed what fine large feet he has?"" said one of them. ""That is like his mother's people. See what a strong web is between the three long toes on each foot! He will be a good swimmer. The one toe that points backward is small, to be sure, but he does not need that in swimming. That is only to make waddling easier.""

""Yes, yes,"" ""A fine web,"" and ""Very large feet,"" cried the fowls around the nest, but most of them didn't care so much about the size of his feet as the Ducks did. Large feet are always useful, you know, yet nobody needs them so badly as Geese and Ducks. The Geese were off swimming, and so could not see the Duckling when first he came out of the shell.

One of the aunts suggested taking some of the Ducklings to the brook, but the mother questioned her knowledge of caring for them. The young mother, despite being new to motherhood, thought about her future Ducklings. The Drake proposed waiting to see what the children would do at the brook. Soon, the Ducklings were happily swimming and drying themselves on the bank. They instinctively knew how to care for themselves without being taught. The Ducklings grew quickly, exploring the farm and learning to swim in the river. They found food in the mud and enjoyed their days swimming, eating, and sleeping.

The Duckling quacked and decided to visit the Blind Horse in the pasture. The Blind Horse welcomed the Duckling, cautioning him to avoid getting stepped on. The Duckling shared how a Weasel had bitten him but felt better since being in the pasture. The Duckling didn't realize that making the Blind Horse happy had improved his own well-being. The two bonded, with the Horse sharing stories of his youth and travels, while the Duckling talked about life in the farmyard. The mother Duck was surprised to find the Duckling with the Blind Horse instead of at the brook. Nearby, in the sheltered farmyard corner, Bees were busy in their hives.

In the bustling bee homes, everyone pitches in to help each other, creating a harmonious life. The Queen Mother is a busy bee, laying up to two thousand eggs daily. Most of these eggs are for the Workers, placed in small cells of the brood comb. Occasionally, she lays Drone eggs in larger cells but never Queen eggs, as only one grown Queen is allowed per hive. The Workers, foreseeing the need for a new Queen, prepare a special royal cell by enlarging a Worker egg cell. They feed the hatched Larva with royal jelly, making her grow rapidly. After a cocoon phase, she emerges as a Pupa and matures into a Queen in sixteen days. The Workers protect the young Queens from the Queen Mother, ensuring their safety until they are ready to rule the hive.|['1.

The worker bees were buzzing in and out of the hive, sharing news from the neighboring hive. The bees couldn't visit each other due to bee laws, but they caught up in the air or while sipping honey.

"""I am concerned about the Bay Colt,"" his mother expressed worriedly. ""Since he was moved to a stall in the barn away from me last autumn, he has developed some bad habits. Despite my repeated reminders not to nibble on the manger's edge, the first sound I heard this morning was the scraping of his teeth against the wood.""

""That's no excuse,"" his mother added firmly. ""He's been teething since he was only five days old, and he won't finish teething for another three years. It's not praiseworthy to avoid cribbing only when you don't feel like it. The time to stop is now. If he waits until all his teeth are in, breaking the habit will be much harder when he finally tries.""

The Dappled Gray chimed in, containing his frustration, ""It's because you're young and we care about you. We can help you avoid trouble if you heed our advice. I had lost my front teeth's black pits before you were born. When a Horse loses those pits, they've gained wisdom. You may not know a curb-bit from a snaffle now, but you'll learn many things once you're trained.""

The Bay Colt, tossing his head, remained silent. When taken out for water, the Dappled Gray quickly conversed with the others. ""We'll leave him be, as he prefers. We won't offer advice unless he seeks it,"" he decided.

"""I don't care,"" said her cousin, ""I'm going anyway, and you can stay at home if you want to. Good-bye!"" He ran and leaped over the fence, and trotted down the road with his head well up and his tail in the air. And then how the Gray Colt did want to follow! ""I won't!"" she said again. ""I won't do it. I'll look the other way and try to forget it, but I wish he knew how hard it is to be good sometimes.""

The next morning the Bay Colt was in the pasture again. The farmer and his man had found him far away and led him back. ""I had a fine time,"" he said to his cousin, ""and I don't feel a bit mean. I'm going again to-day, but don't you tell."" When his mother scolded him as he deserved, he just switched his tail and thought about something else until she stopped talking. Then he ran away again.

The next morning when the Gray Colt saw him, he had a queer wooden thing around his neck, and fastened to this was a pole that stuck out ahead of him.

In the autumn, before the cold drove them to the barn, the Bay Colt wore a poke, remembering the lesson on jumping and running away. His mother was proud, and the Dappled Gray, rarely praising, saw potential. Yet, the Bay Colt grew cross when told to stop cribbing. Some Colts learn obedience easily, while others struggle with jumping, cribbing, and kicking. The older Horses sympathize, helping them understand that doing right leads to a fulfilling life. The farmer introduced a bit to the Bay Colt, gently correcting his behavior. The Gray Colt adapted, finding comfort in understanding the farmer's cues. Despite resistance, the Bay Colt refused to accept the bit, causing concern among the older Horses. The next days brought more driving lessons, where the Gray Colt adapted well, while the Bay Colt remained defiant, proud of his solid hoofs and unwillingness to conform.|"['1.

When the gray colt mastered walking steadily and turning as directed, she proudly pulled a light log through the field. Although tiring, she took dainty steps, believing it was real work to teach her to pull. The man driving her patted her neck and fed her apple cores. Meanwhile, the bay colt thought deeply, vowing to stop cribbing. Despite a sore mouth, he stayed strong, realizing he needed to be steady like his cousin. The dappled gray and the blind horse praised the bay colt's plowing skills, acknowledging his hard work and dedication.

"""A lot of Lambs are like that,"" his mother explained. ""More than you think. They resist and fight because they can't always get their way. But when they learn to follow the farmer's lead, they realize his care is better than endless play. Colts will be Colts."" Among them was a Lamb, a lively fellow with a twin sister. Their mother adored them equally, but the brother sought superiority, even nudging his sister. His mother corrected him often, for he was stubborn and ignored her at first. Despite being mischievous, he was not intentionally naughty, just energetic and thoughtless. He sometimes even showed rudeness to his mother, which saddened her. She loved him dearly and understood his behavior. The flock had several sets of twins that year. Since their mothers couldn't raise both, the farmer placed one Lamb from each pair in a pen near the house. They played and drank milk from a bottle provided by the farmer's wife. When hungry, they eagerly waited for the bottle, sometimes biting her fingers in their impatience. The twin Lamb wanted his sister with the other Lambs, suggesting his mother avoid her so the farmer would relocate her. However, his sister never knew about his plan, showing her love in different ways. If separated, they might not recognize each other later due to their similar appearance.

The mother Sheep and her twin Lambs were huddled together in the Sheep-shed one night when the farmer came in with men carrying shears. The Sheep were frightened and bleated, not understanding why they were being moved. The men took the Sheep into the barn one by one, starting with the older ones. The Lambs watched anxiously as their mother was eventually taken away too. They heard the sounds of shearing and the men's voices from the barn, feeling scared and unsure of what was happening. The brother Lamb regretted his unkind words from the night before, wishing he could be close to his mother again.

The twin brother and his sister were left alone in the barn after all the mothers were taken away. The brother, feeling lonely and frightened, saw freshly shorn Sheep in the meadow and realized what had happened. He then witnessed his mother struggling to find her Lambs in the pasture due to her changed appearance after shearing. Initially torn between selfishness and goodness, he eventually chose to lead his sister to their mother, realizing the importance of family unity.

The Meadow Mice living near the farm were friendly cousins of the barn mice. They had distinct differences in size, fur color, voices, and lifestyles. Unlike their cousins, the Meadow Mice preferred the outdoors, never venturing into houses. They welcomed visits from farm animals grazing in the meadow but didn't return the visits. The cows and horses respected these tiny creatures, watching out for them in the grass. Meadow Mice built their homes in tree stumps or near ditches, raising large families. The babies, no bigger than bumblebees at first, stayed in nests until they were ready to explore the world. The parents were gentle, wise, and always kept clean, setting a fine example for their offspring. The eight baby mice were tiny and pink initially, but as they grew, they became a delightful sight for their proud mother and her neighbors.|['1.

The days went by, and the eight baby Meadow Mice grew quickly, becoming less pink and more like their parents. Their mother prepared them for the world, teaching them to run, gnaw, and hide from danger. She shared important lessons about survival, cautioning them to flee from predators like Hawks, Weasels, Owls, and Cats. While most of the siblings listened obediently, one bold mouse, the largest and most handsome, often disregarded warnings, thinking he knew better. One sunny day, a black bird appeared, sparking fear among the siblings except the daring one. Meanwhile, a group of eager Pigs poked their snouts through a fence, eager for news, as their old mother reminisced about their father's colors and temperament.|"[""1.

As the wagon turned into their lane, the children saw the beautiful white Pig inside. She had perky ears, a stubby snout, small eyes, and a curly tail. The Pig squealed, showing her sharp teeth and fine hoofs. Despite her elegance, the other Brown Pigs with black spots and feet were surprised. The White Pig was brought in a hurry, but Pigs are known to be contrary. The old Hog tried to catch up but was slow. Once set free, the White Pig squealed and joined the others.

The tiny kitten lay there, moving weakly until his mother nudged him over. Slowly, he inched towards her, unsure of his wobbly legs. New to the world, he clumsily dragged his body, not knowing where he was headed. His empty stomach and the cold made him instinctively crawl towards his warm mother. As he felt around, his mouth found something sweet and warm, which he eagerly drank, not realizing it was milk. Soon, he and his siblings fell asleep, content and safe beside their loving mother. The mother cat watched over them, marveling at their smallness and wondering if she was once as tiny. The days passed, and the kittens grew, opening their eyes to the world with curiosity and innocence.|[]|[]
The young kittens were too scared to hunt and would huddle together, hiss, and puff up their fur at the slightest movement. They played games and chased each other's tails in the loft, but their mother warned them to stay away from the holes in the floor. One day, the White Kitten fell through one of these holes and landed in a dark box, where she met a Blind Horse. The Kitten was frightened but the Horse reassured her and asked her to come out into the manger. The Kitten hesitated, thinking the Horse might mistake her for a Pig, not realizing that Horses could recognize different animals.

The White Kitten felt sorry for the Cat when she saw him. She remembered a time when she had to feel for things before she could see. She explained to the Cat how her mother used to wash her and how her tongue was getting rougher for cleaning. The Cat was glad to find the White Kitten and cleaned her up. The Kitten felt ashamed when the Cat carried her home. After a fall, the Kitten was lame and her mother was sad but didn't punish her. The family walked downstairs, and the Cat introduced her three kittens to the farmyard. The Yellow Kitten was a great hunter, the Brown Kitten had a remarkable voice, and the White Kitten was the most obedient. The Hen was proud of her twelve fine chickens with long legs and thick feathers. She showed them off to the Shanghai Cock, who believed they would do well if they behaved.|"[""1.

The young Shanghai chickens were proud of their good looks, especially their legs. They believed that their family never wore feathers on their legs, unlike other fowls. The mother hen led her brood to the wheat-stubble fields where they enjoyed rich pickings. The fowls, including the brave and polite Cocks, roamed freely under their watchful eyes. The Cocks, the lords of the poultry-yard, protected the flock from dangers like Hawks. One day, a Black Spanish Cock saved a Dorking from a Hawk, showcasing both bravery and politeness. The chicks learned to break their food into pieces using their feet or bills before eating. While most of the brood grew plump from the wheat grains, one thin chick worried its mother. The Shanghai Cock reassured her that the chick was just growing fast, similar to when he was thin before growing into a fine-looking rooster.|['1.

That evening, the mother hen and her chicks settled in the old apple-tree near the poultry-yard. The mother hen flew up to roost while the chicks climbed a board to join her on the branches. It always takes fowls a while to settle down for the night, jostling and squawking until they find their spots. The chicks were worried about falling off in their sleep, but soon learned how their feet are designed to grip branches tightly. As the night passed, all the fowls slept peacefully, except the Shanghai mother who noticed one chick looking unwell. She realized he needed gravel to aid digestion. The next day, the chick avoided gravel but felt unfulfilled. Despite having his way, he missed out on the joy of simple activities with his siblings.|['1.

For several days, the Bantam rooster noticed his shadow was small compared to his siblings' shadows. He overheard hurtful comments about his size and abilities. Feeling self-conscious, he secretly ate gravel to grow stronger. Eventually, he realized the importance of hard work and facing challenges. He decided to be honest with his mother and admitted his mistake. The Bantam then befriended a Dorking Chicken who had previously mocked him. On the farm, animals like the wise Collie dog, patient Oxen, hardworking Horses, and productive Cows all played essential roles. The Bantam learned that overcoming difficulties and putting in effort lead to wisdom and respect from others.|"[""1.

On the farm, there are different animals, each with their own unique characteristics. The Geese, for example, believe they are the most important, boasting that one of them is worth more than five Horses or a dozen Cows. However, their neighbors know better and chuckle at their airs. The Geese strut around in winter, thinking they are too good for hard work, unlike the Horses who understand the value of honest labor. The Geese get plucked four times a year, each time acting surprised as if it's the first. They tend to forget things quickly and make the same mistakes repeatedly. Their inability to distinguish between big and small things often leads to unnecessary trouble. In the end, it's a lesson in humility and the importance of hard work that the Geese need to learn.|"['1.

After the Gander and his wife hatched seven Goslings, they happily took them to the brook. The Gander and Mother Goose were relieved that their babies were safe and they could stretch their legs. Ganders are devoted fathers, sharing egg-sitting duties with Mother Goose. The other Geese were proud and happy to have their friends free to roam again. While most Geese followed the Gander through the gate, the Gray Goose struggled at a small hole nearby. Exhausted, she rested, wishing she could join the others. Frustrated, she refused to take another path. As a windstorm hit the farm, the animals scrambled for shelter. The fowls sought refuge in the Hen-house, shaking off raindrops, showing their dislike for wet weather.|"['1.

In the barn, the Cows stood still with their necks in the stanchions, thinking of those outside. The Horses, after a hard day's work, enjoyed a good supper of oats in their stalls. The Sheep sought shelter under a tree during the storm, finding comfort in the cool rain. The Lambs played gleefully in the lightning. As the storm passed, the Sheep shook off raindrops and ran joyfully around the field. Following the Bell-Wether, they crossed a fence that leaned over, venturing onto the road. Each one followed the other, not thinking for themselves, until they found themselves on the road, following the Bell-Wether away from the farmhouse.|"['1.

After a while, a heavy wagon rumbled down the road, startling the sheep. The Bell-Wether led them into a hilly field, followed by the others, feeling scared and uncertain. When a strange dog appeared, their fear grew. Sheep, with their strong foreheads and horns, could defend themselves if brave. But fear spread among them, and they fled to the hilltop, feeling miserable. Uncomfortable and out of patience, they couldn't explain why they ran uphill. It was an instinct passed down from their wild ancestors to seek safety on high ground. Luckily, Collie, the farm dog, found them and guided them back home, scolding them playfully.

Hen Turkeys are caring mothers, especially in the spring when they lay and hatch their eggs. To avoid the Gobbler breaking their eggs, the Hen Turkeys sneak away from the flock when he's not looking to find a safe spot for their nests. Once the eggs are laid, they return casually, pretending they were just getting a drink. The Gobbler doesn't like young Turkeys and would break the eggs if he found them.

The farmyard animals will always remember the arrival of the Peacock, especially his first day among them. He arrived in the evening when the birds were settling down for the night and the other animals were already asleep. The next morning, a stunning greenish-blue bird with a magnificent train emerged in the yard, catching everyone by surprise. The fowls, in awe, paused their daily walks, mesmerized by the sight of this unfamiliar creature. The Lamb mistook the Peacock for a cloud-bird, recalling a past stormy night. When the Peacock corrected him in a proud tone, the Turkey Gobbler felt compelled to assert his own importance. The Peacock, unfazed, displayed his impressive train, leaving everyone marveling at its beauty and grandeur.|"['1.

The Gobbler let out a sound and then addressed the Hen Turkeys, emphasizing the need to move along to avoid interactions with random fowl. The children, eager to see the Peacock, trailed behind. The Geese welcomed the newcomer, hoping for his friendliness, though they noted he couldn't swim due to his feet not being webbed. The Gander, observing the Peacock's homely feet, decided to mention it to the Geese later. The Geese, eager to head to the water, hesitated to ask the Peacock if he worked for a living.

The Peacock thought highly of himself and his beautiful feathers. He believed others admired him for his beauty and never gave away his feathers except when he molted. The other fowls, like the Black Spanish and Dorking, were polite but didn't fawn over him. The Chickens found his harsh cry amusing, but the Black Spanish Cock scolded them for mocking the Peacock's natural voice. One day, the Peacock stood on the fence, aloof and self-absorbed, as a group of young fowls passed by. Oblivious to their presence, he engaged the Bantam Chicken in conversation.
