"In the past, the Green was home to Two Donkeys and the Geese, surrounded by houses without names. Each family's address was simply ""The Green."" The people were content in their own community, unconcerned with the outside world. Longevity was common, except for rare early deaths like that of little Miss Jessamine. The elderly were proud of their age, except for the secretive Grey Goose and the big Miss Jessamine. The Grey Goose had trouble with dates, only recalling events by ""last Michaelmas"" or similar vague terms. The village faced troubling times, hosting political meetings and sermons on the Green. The threat of Bony, a feared figure, loomed over the children, who imagined him as an Ogre. The Grey Goose believed Bony was a fox, hunted by men in red coats."|['1.

The Grey Goose never saw Bony, and neither did the children, which lessened the fear of him. The Black Captain, known for his black mare and mysterious ways, was more effective as a Bogy with hardened offenders. The Grey Goose recalled his arrival vividly, unsure of his purpose during those troubled times. Some believed the Black Captain, with his swift mare, could protect against the French invasion. The Johnson's Nurse used his reputation to discipline the children, threatening to hand them over to him if they misbehaved. The eldest Master Johnson was terrified when the Black Captain unexpectedly appeared and playfully carried him away, turning the boy's tears into laughter.
