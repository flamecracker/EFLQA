The Mountain Top Inn, nestled near the Blue Ridge in Rockfish Gap, was surrounded by the stunning beauty of autumn. The October afternoon painted a picturesque scene with prairies, fruit-tree forests, and a garden of flowers under a sky of the bluest hue. The sun's scarlet rays touched the peaks, casting a magical glow over the landscape. A young boy, perched on the inn's porch, daydreamed, his imagination filled with vivid scenes of soldiers marching, battles, and the sorrow of Lee's surrender. These memories, etched in his mind, stirred a mix of emotions from pride to sadness. The boy's heart longed for the past, where heroes like General Robert E. Lee led the way, leaving an indelible mark on his young soul.|['1.

The boy noticed the sound of hoofs and saw a man riding down the road towards the inn. The boy, eager to show hospitality, directed Uncle Jake to take the horse to the stable. As the man approached, the boy ran to greet him. The man, firmly seated on his horse, extended a strong hand with a kind smile.

"As Jimmy and the young man approached the spring, Jimmy excitedly pointed it out. He quickly knelt down, scooped up rust-colored flakes, and inspected them. Meanwhile, a saddle left by Uncle Jake caught the young man's eye near the horse-rack. Curiosity led him to flip it over, revealing the initials ""R. E. L."" This discovery filled him with a sense of recognition, prompting him to rush into the house. Mrs. Claverly identified the man approaching as Lee, causing astonishment in Jimmy. The goat, Jericho Bob, and his friend Julius Cæsar Fish, were busy nibbling on various items in the yard. Jericho Bob, eager for a taste of turkey, watched longingly as Thanksgiving approached. Despite Mrs. Bob's sacrifice of a hen, Jericho's desire for turkey remained unfulfilled.

"""Jericho Bob!"" his mother called out, pointing to him sternly as she adjusted her colorful turban. ""Jericho Bob, it's your turn to collect the eggs today. If you don't bring back twenty-three, there will be consequences you won't like."" A tiny beak appeared, pecking through the eggshell. Slowly, a fluffy brown ball emerged with a funny little head and two wobbly legs. This turkeykin, named Fish, Jr., made its home in a freight car near the Fish yard. As the seasons passed, the friends watched the turkey grow, knowing it would soon be their Thanksgiving dinner. On the day before Thanksgiving, tensions rose between Jericho and Julius Cæsar Fish. Despite a momentary truce, a scuffle ensued over the fate of the turkey. Ultimately, the bird evaded capture and perched on the freight car, leaving the friends in a comical predicament."|"[""1.

With the help of a wash-tub, an old chair, and Julius Caesar's back, Jericho Bob was lifted onto the car. A turkey strutted on the roof, wings spread. The turkey screeched, broke free, and flew to the last car. In a flash, Jericho Bob's Thanksgiving feast vanished down the road! Small things can have great power as they grow. This was evident in how America, once seen as insignificant by big nations like England, France, and Spain, grew to be a force. France tried to limit America's growth by controlling the Mississippi River. America rebelled, wanting to expand. President Jefferson sought a compromise, leading to the purchase of the Louisiana Territory from Napoleon, who needed funds for his European plans. Napoleon's change of heart surprised many, leading to the sale of New Orleans and the entire Louisiana Territory.|"[""1.

In the past, President Jefferson was unavailable for advice due to lack of quick communication methods. Therefore, Monroe and Livingston acted independently. They signed a deal to sell the Louisiana territory to the United States for $15,000,000. This decision faced criticism, as the true potential of the land was unknown. The territory turned out to be incredibly resourceful, with abundant crops, rich pasture-lands, and valuable minerals. This transaction, made a century ago, led to the acquisition of states like Colorado, Wyoming, and more. This region, now the wealthiest part of the U.S. in terms of natural resources, was a significant investment. The city in this area enjoys a unique outdoor lifestyle, with roses, wisteria, and magnolias thriving year-round.

As you navigate its meandering waters, you'll find yourself lost in a maze of trees and greenery, only to realize that being lost in the woods feels like being on the river.

The rivers in the vast territory between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean are being used for irrigation, turning barren lands fertile. Even the Missouri River is contributing, but in a peculiar way. The Missouri River was found to leak water as it flowed downstream, a strange phenomenon. Farmers in Dakota discovered water while digging wells, believed to be from the leaking Missouri River. This water is used for irrigation, making it a valuable resource for farming during dry weather. Irrigation is considered one of the most useful purposes for a river.

"Mazin' Grace's first outing with Nell was to the ""Christian an' Debil"" Society. Despite her limping from recent blisters, her smile reflected pure joy. Both girls proudly wore new watermelon stockings. Alligators, a source of curiosity up North, are still plentiful in the South. They are hunted mainly at night with torches. Contrary to belief, alligators are easily shot but resilient. They nest in mud, lay many eggs, but cannibalistic tendencies hinder population growth. Alligators eat anything, including pine chips. They can travel long distances overland to find water. Hides are preserved and sold, with ten thousand killed annually in Florida. Conflicting reports exist on their size.

Once, I had a strange encounter with an alligator in Florida. It was a female protecting her young. During a trip up the St. John's River, we were approached by two men who hunted alligators and plume-birds. While exploring an alligator nest, we faced a big alligator charging at us. Only one man had a rifle, and he shot the alligator down its throat, causing it to sink away. In the Amazon River, alligators grow huge due to few hunters. I once found a piraña inside a dead alligator. Alligators in the Amazon are said to be more aggressive than those in the Southern States. The heat in Charleston on August 31, 1886, was unbearable, with no relief even at night. The sky had a misty, tropical appearance. While chatting with friends, a strange rumbling noise approached, like distant thunder but from below, growing louder until it was upon us.|"['1.

The sturdy brick house we were in started to sway gently, then with increasing force, making us spring to our feet. We held hands, staring at the tottering walls. The floor beneath us heaved like a ship in a storm, and debris crashed around us. We realized we were in an earthquake. The house's motion turned vertical, as if a giant toyed with it. Staggering, we rushed to the jammed front door, trapped until the quake stopped. After a final convulsion, the earth settled, leaving us shaken. Chunks of the neighboring house fell into our garden, luckily avoiding harm. We managed to open the door and joined neighbors in the street, suffocated by the smell of sulfur.

During the fall season, the hogs were brought in from the fields to fatten them up. They were kept in a pen next to the road, hidden under a woodpile except for a small opening in the back where they were fed. To avoid detection by passing soldiers, the hogs were fed quickly when an army was approaching, ensuring they were napping during the march. The house, strategically located in a valley, had hidden spaces like a cellar with a secret room accessed through a trapdoor, false ends in the garrets for storage, and closets with hidden compartments for linen. Even the kitchen had a wood-box with a false bottom to store food and silverware. These hidden spaces were crucial to protect supplies from soldiers or marauders passing by unexpectedly.|['1.

Deep within the fort lie dungeons where no sunlight reaches. When the government took over, a human skeleton was found chained in one, and in another, two iron cages held skeletons. Legends suggest they were heirs to the Spanish throne. Osceola, a famous Indian chief, was once held in a cell here with another chief, Wild Cat. Wild Cat escaped through a small window after starving himself. The fort, built of coquina stone from Anastasia Island, is a sight to behold. St. Augustine's harbor offers great fishing, and the sea beaches are perfect for bathing. The town's warm winters and cool summers attract visitors.

"In an instant, the smoldering fire roared to life, the ponies of the visitors were secured, and the group gathered around Martha and the fire. John discussed business briefly before one of the men respectfully asked Martha for a song. Her guitar filled the prairie night with sweet music, captivating the men.

Martha and her guest enjoyed their time at the ranch. In the mornings, they watched the cattle being herded for shipment from Amarilla. The cattle sometimes passed close to the house, but often they were far away on the prairie. Every afternoon, they went horseback riding, with Martha ensuring her friend's safety. Scylla's riding skills improved each day, and they even enjoyed gentle gallops. On one ride back to the ranch, they were greeted by a horseman in a frenzy.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, signaling the end of supper, One-eyed Saylo rode off towards Amarilla. Meanwhile, John readied himself to join the cowboys on a saddle mission. The evening was serene, with the moon casting a gentle glow over the prairie. They rode out, pausing to listen to the distant cowboys' songs.

The short-lived chaos unfolded swiftly as the little horse regained its footing after a brief stumble. Trembling and with wild, blood-shot eyes, the pony bolted into the darkness, leaving the girls stunned. Scylla wept while Martha, holding Dan's reins, tried to figure out a plan. Realizing a storm was approaching, Martha attempted to lift Scylla onto Dan's back but failed. Remembering Dan's training, she commanded him to kneel.

Slowly, the herd began to thin out, leaving short gaps between the animals. Martha realized the herd was almost gone. As the living walls on each side disappeared, only a few stragglers remained. Finally, the stampeding herd passed, leaving Martha and the once-crippled Scylla alive. Scylla, now standing for the first time in years, thanked Martha for her bravery during the storm. Exhausted and wet, the girls embraced and prayed together on the prairie. As they wondered how to get home, they heard approaching horses. Martha tried to call out, but her voice failed.

A short way along the train tracks, a group of horse soldiers had dismounted and were working swiftly to destroy the rails. One team loosened the spikes while another piled the ties and lit fires beneath them. The dry ties caught fire easily, heating the rails to a bright red. The soldiers then bent the rails around nearby objects. Harry and his mother watched with fascination until they noticed a soldier riding towards them. Harry excitedly danced, recognizing his brother in the gray uniform. Captain John Magill, noticing the approaching Federals, quickly rode back to warn his comrades. Harry, eager to stay and watch the skirmish, tried to convince his brother to let him stay. However, Captain Magill was determined to take him to safety.

Captain John Magill witnessed the impact of his actions and paused to encourage his troops, but they were in a state of panic, fleeing in disarray. The Union soldiers were now close, and the buzzing sound of bullets filled the air. Quickly positioning Harry in front of him for protection, Captain Magill followed his retreating men, who were now far ahead. As they reached the house, Mrs. Magill, pale and anxious, feared for her children's safety. Seeing the imminent danger, she bravely stood in the path of the advancing Union soldiers, risking her life to buy time for her sons to escape.

When the time came to say goodbye, the sun shone like a ruby above the crimson and gold trees. Two brothers, one in blue and one in gray, stood hand in hand, symbolizing unity between the North and South. This moment changed Harry's life, leading him to pursue a military career. After the war, he was educated by John and Thomas and excelled in his exams, earning a spot at West Point. Now known as Lieutenant Henry Magill, U.S.A., he had a remarkable journey from a young boy to a military officer. In the 1830s, steamboats used creative ways to signal their arrival to passengers and shippers. The absence of steam whistles led to boats using unique sounds to announce their approach. The steamboat _Champion_ even had a daring young lad swing on its machinery to catch attention when the signaling tubes broke.|"['1.

"The event inspired the captain of the _Champion_ to come up with an idea. He decided to make the boy a permanent part of the crew and gave him the role of ""walking-beam boy."" He even got him a beautiful flag. Whenever they approached a town, the brave boy would climb up to his spot with the flag. He would sit on the walking-beam, creating a unique and thrilling sight for onlookers on shore. The boy's waving of the Stars and Stripes against the vast sky background was a spectacle to behold. Other steamboats soon adopted this idea, and more ""walking-beam boys"" emerged along the rivers, each with their distinctive flags. Despite the risks, these boys became popular figures among passengers and received various tokens of appreciation from different regions."|"['1.
