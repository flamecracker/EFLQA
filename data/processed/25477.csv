Grandpa Martin suggested that the Curlytops go camping, but they insisted they wouldn't. Instead, they went to the Home for Crippled Children with Grandpa Martin. Among the children there was Hal Chester, who had almost recovered from his lameness. The Home had helped many children like him. Ted and Hal made whistles by the river, while Jan played with her friend Mary. As they saw storm clouds gathering, they hurried home in the goat-wagon. Jan threw a pine cone at Nicknack, urging him to go faster. In the distance, they saw a flickering blue light on Star Island, which made them a bit anxious. Grandpa Martin dismissed it as a dream or imagination.|"['1.

"During their late supper, Grandpa Martin shared his plans with the Curlytops. Let's get better acquainted with them. Theodore, also known as Teddy, and his sister Janet, or Jan, spent their summer at Cherry Farm with their mother. Their father, Mr. Richard Martin, owned a store in Cresco. Baby William, nicknamed Trouble, joined them. Nora Jones, the maid, assisted Mrs. Martin. They also had two pets, Skyrocket the dog and Turnover the cat. In the first book, ""The Curlytops at Cherry Farm,"" the children found a goat named Nicknack and had adventures. They helped Grandpa Martin sell cherries to Mr. Sander, the lollypop man, who made candy. The children also got lost in the woods. Jan and Ted, known for their curly hair, loved being called the Curlytops. After supper, they played camping on the old couch in the sitting room, imagining it as a tent."|['1.

Jan and Ted were excited about the idea of camping on Star Island. Ted suggested playing a game where Trouble, their dog, would be a bear. He even planned to use their grandpa's cane as a pretend gun. As they chatted, Trouble climbed on the couch to nap, but Jan reminded him not to sleep there. The children were eager to play but got sidetracked by stories of wild bulls and tramps on the island. However, their grandfather's concern about tramps dampened their spirits. Despite the farmer's warning, Jan and Ted decided to share the news with their grandpa. As they left the store, Jan assured Ted that there was nothing to worry about. They hurried home to tell their grandpa about the camping plan, eager for the adventure ahead.|"['1.

Teddy carefully picked up the spilled baking soda package after Trouble threw it at the rabbit. Baby William mistook it for a white stone. The rabbit hopped away, possibly to share a story in rabbit language about seeing giants in a wagon pulled by an elephant. Ted and Jan were excited to go camping on Star Island. They helped Grandpa Martin pack the tents and essentials. Trouble caused mischief but was saved from falling off the haymow and losing a bucket down the well. The Curlytops loaded the boat for the camping trip. Despite concerns about tramps, they set off, leaving Nicknack and his wagon on the island under a tree. Janet kept an eye on Baby William during the boat ride.|['1. What did Trouble throw at the rabbit?\nA) A white stone\nB) A bucket\nC) A baking soda package\nD) A tent\nE) A wagon', '2.

Grandpa Martin set up the camp near the shore where they landed. He unpacked the tents, cooking supplies, and food. Teddy suggested finding a snack before everything was unpacked, and Grandpa Martin had cookies from Grandma Martin's thoughtful packing. Teddy joked about finding a bear's den, but changed it to a fox to not scare his little brother and Jan. Grandpa warned them not to go too far or near the lake's edge. Baby William found an ant he sat on but didn't harm. The children enjoyed the sunny day on Star Island, excited for more camping adventures with their grandpa.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Grandpa Martin unpack after setting up the camp near the shore?\nA) Fishing gear\nB) Bicycles\nC) Tents, cooking supplies, and food\nD) Surfboards\nE) Kites', 'Question 2:\nWhy did Teddy suggest finding a snack before everything was unpacked?\nA) Because he was bored\nB) Because he was hungry\nC) Because he wanted to explore\nD) Because he wanted to go swimming\nE) Because Grandpa Martin asked him to', ""Question 3:\nWhat did Teddy joke about finding near the camp?\nA) A bear's den\nB) A fox\nC) A rabbit hole\nD) A squirrel's nest\nE) A bird's nest"", ""Question 4:\nWhy did Teddy change his joke about finding a bear's den to a fox?\nA) To scare his little brother\nB) To scare Jan\nC) To not scare his little brother and Jan\nD) To impress Grandpa Martin\nE) To impress Baby William"", ""Question 5:\nWhat did Grandpa Martin warn the children about?\nA) Going too far from the camp\nB) Going too far from the lake's edge\nC) Going near the lake's edge\nD) Playing with the ants\nE) Swimming in the lake"", ""Question 6:\nHow did Baby William interact with the ant he found?\nA) He squished it\nB) He ignored it\nC) He fed it\nD) He sat on it but didn't harm it\nE) He ran away from it""]"|"['C) Tents, cooking supplies, and food', 'B) Because he was hungry', 'B) A fox', 'C) To not scare his little brother and Jan', ""C) Going near the lake's edge"", ""D) He sat on it but didn't harm it""]"
"Janet excitedly exclaimed, ""Look, it's a bunny rabbit living in that hole!"" Ted agreed, ""Let's explore the island and find more surprises. Maybe we'll discover a big cave!"" Meanwhile, Nora and Mrs. Martin prepared a picnic for the children on a box. The Curlytops and Trouble enjoyed sandwiches and cake while Grandpa Martin and the hired man unloaded the boat. As they set off back to the mainland, Grandpa Martin decided to bring Nicknack, the goat, to the island. Despite a brief scare when Nicknack jumped into the water, he began swimming towards the island confidently. Ted reassured everyone that Nicknack would be fine, and Grandpa Martin praised the goat's unexpected swimming skills."|['1.

Nicknack swam swiftly, not as skilled as a duck or fish, but still impressive. On the shore, Nora, Mrs. Martin, Janet, Trouble, and the farmhand watched as the goat approached. Unlike a dog, Nicknack didn't shake off the water but settled on the grass, feeling at home. The camp setup continued as the tents were raised with help from Ted, Jan, Mother Martin, and Nora. Nicknack was tied to a tree, awaiting a leafy shelter. The group explored the island, enjoying the fresh spring water. Amidst playful stone tossing, Ted mentioned finding a star piece or its impact crater. The Curlytops roamed as Grandpa and the men readied for supper prep.|['1.

The two Curlytops explored the island, searching for star-holes but found none. They sat under the tent for supper cooked by Nora on a portable stove. The sides of the tent were open, letting in the evening air. Trouble, the youngest, had mistakenly put salt in the lake, thinking it would turn it into an ocean. Realizing his mistake, he tried to fix it by adding more salt. His family forgave him, and they enjoyed a campfire together. The mosquito netting kept bugs away as they settled in for the night.|['1.

Teddy assured everyone that they would listen attentively, and Grandpa Martin recounted a childhood tale from when he lived near a vast wood teeming with bears and wild animals. He described his father as a skilled hunter who often took down bears and wolves in the untamed region. Grandpa Martin shared a gripping anecdote about being chased by a bear as a young boy but finding refuge in a hollow log until his father and other hunters rescued him. Later that night, a commotion outside the tent alarmed Teddy, but it turned out to be their goat, Nicknack, stuck between two trees. The next morning, the Curlytops set off on an adventure with Nicknack, stopping to snack under the trees. However, their peaceful moment was interrupted when Teddy spotted a bear in a hollow log nearby, causing Jan to swiftly suggest leaving the area.|['1.

Ted assured his sister that he would protect them from the bear by urging their goat, Nicknack, to move faster. Grandpa, armed with a club, investigated a noise near a hollow log, only to discover a fox that scampered away. Reassured, the children focused on fishing, landing several catches. Nora, preparing the fish for dinner, joked about the confusion of meal times while the children cleaned up. Jan and Ted noticed a bird with a hurt wing and wanted to help, but the bird always managed to stay just out of reach when they tried to assist.|"['1.

Jan, Ted, and their little brother William were exploring the woods when they spotted two little birds acting strangely. The birds lured the children away from their nest by pretending to be unable to fly. The clever birds were protecting their eggs from being disturbed. Jan and Ted, being kind-hearted, wouldn't have harmed the birds or their nest. The children then discovered a robin's nest with baby birds waiting to be fed by their mother. As they continued their walk, they searched for a fox but found none. Jan stopped to pick some flowers, and Ted stayed with William. A ragged man approached Janet, asking about a professor. Janet remembered that a professor was like a scientist. The man wondered if someone else was looking for the same thing he was on the island.|"['1.

Janet was amazed at how swiftly the man vanished into the woods with his bag of stones, leaving her speechless. She watched the bushes shake as he disappeared, unable to see him anymore. When she recounted the incident to Grandpa Martin, he speculated about the presence of tramps on the island. Concerned about the safety of the children, he decided to investigate the island the next day. Despite Teddy's eagerness to join the search, Grandpa Martin insisted he stay behind for safety reasons. The following day, after a thorough exploration, no sign of any strangers was found. Meanwhile, Ted and Janet enjoyed playing by Clover Lake, soaking in the summer fun. The camp was well-established, with plenty of provisions stored in the cooking tent, ensuring a comfortable stay for everyone.|"[""1.

The Curlytops enjoyed playing games and taking rides with their pony Nicknack, sometimes joined by Trouble. Mrs. Martin believed in balancing play with responsibilities, assigning Ted and Jan daily tasks like fetching water from the spring and gathering wood for campfires. Nora, the cook, made delicious treats in the camp's oven. Ted once heard a strange bird while fetching water and left the pail to investigate, but Trouble, eager to help, attempted to fill the pail himself and nearly fell into the spring. Luckily, Ted and Jan arrived in time to prevent any harm. Later, the Curlytops spotted a ragged man near the spring, who rescued a soaked Trouble from the water, disappearing before they could intervene. Despite the scare, Trouble was safe, though wet and upset.|"[""1.

Teddy quietly made a decision to search for the mysterious men on his own, determined to find the ragged man and possibly others. Although he didn't voice his thoughts, Teddy was resolute in his plan to uncover the truth about the men, even if it meant exploring caves or gypsy wagons. As he embarked on his mission, Teddy's curiosity led him to investigate footprints near the spring, suspecting they belonged to the tramps. With his sister Jan by his side, they followed a hidden path, discovering clues that hinted at the tramps' presence. Excitedly, Teddy called Jan to witness a new revelation, his voice filled with astonishment and determination as they delved deeper into the mystery.|"['1.

Janet asked Teddy how he found the hole as they walked towards it. It was off the path they had taken through the woods from the spring. Teddy explained that he accidentally fell into it while walking, but luckily it wasn't too deep. Janet peered into the hole between two rocks, noticing it slanted downwards. She decided it was too dark and dangerous to explore. Teddy tried to climb out but struggled due to slippery pine needles. With Janet's help, he managed to pull himself out using a grapevine. They reunited with their family, and Trouble was excited to bake with Nora.

In the dark cave with just one lantern, Grandpa Martin wanted to explore more but didn't want to take the children far. Jan clung to his hand tightly.

Ted and Janet rushed to the leafy bower where the goat, Nicknack, was usually kept. The warm weather on Star Island meant the goat spent only half the time in the stable Grandpa Martin had built. They found Nicknack tangled in a bush by his rope, which he had dragged after wandering away. A dog was barking at him, preventing him from escaping. Mrs. Martin scared the dog away, freeing Nicknack. The goat, frightened but safe, was led back and hitched to the wagon for a ride.

Ted and Janet were thrilled with their makeshift boats made from strong boxes. They pretended the boxes were ocean steamers on a grand adventure in the cove near their grandpa's camp. Using pieces of wood as paddles, they floated in their box-boats, enjoying the feeling of being on the water. However, an unexpected surprise awaited Janet as something pulled her box along. Upon investigation, they discovered a turtle had gotten entangled in the rope tied to Janet's boat. While Ted's boat still floated, Janet's had taken on more water, causing it to sink to the bottom of the cove. The siblings watched as the turtle splashed about, trying to free itself.

Hal, Jan, and Ted decided to start a mine like the miners out West. They read about it when Hal was injured and couldn't walk much. Hal suggested they dig until they find gold and have a gold mine. Despite Hal's foot not being fully healed, they planned to dig with Jan doing most of the work. They collected shovels and a hoe and headed to the cave. The adults assumed they were digging for fish worms. The children chose to start a new hole rather than expanding an existing one. The sand made digging easy without many rocks. In about thirty minutes, they dug a deep hole, similar to digging at the seashore. It was a fun and productive activity for the Curlytops.|['1.

"While Jan was at the tent-kitchen asking Nora for snacks, Ted and Hal carried the light ladder to the deep hole they had started.

They continued their journey at a slower pace, and Ted attempted to jump over a muddy puddle but slipped, getting his leg wet and muddy. This mishap allowed Janet to catch up with the boys. As they approached the cave entrance, Hal hesitated to venture deep inside. With Ted and Hal's support, Janet bravely entered the cave. The children observed the spacious cave illuminated by Hal's light, but they didn't find the blue rocks or any signs of a picnic. Hal suggested leaving due to the noise they heard, possibly from a falling stone. They sat nearby, enjoying a snack from Nora and a drink from a spring. The boys then rode on, admiring nature, searching for the elusive blue rocks. Despite their efforts, they didn't find any. Finally, as the day waned, Hal spotted a large stone in the hillside.|"['Question 1:\nWhat happened when Ted attempted to jump over a muddy puddle?\nA) He successfully jumped over the puddle.\nB) He slipped and got his leg wet and muddy.\nC) He caught up with Janet.\nD) He found the blue rocks.\nE) He decided to leave the cave.', 'Question 2:\nWhy was Janet able to catch up with the boys?\nA) Ted slowed down to let her catch up.\nB) Hal waited for her.\nC) Ted slipped and got his leg wet.\nD) Hal hesitated to enter the cave.\nE) They all sat down for a snack.', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Hal hesitate to do as they approached the cave entrance?\nA) Jump over a muddy puddle.\nB) Enter the cave.\nC) Leave the cave.\nD) Find the blue rocks.\nE) Enjoy a snack.', 'Question 4:\nWhy did Hal suggest leaving the cave?\nA) They found the blue rocks.\nB) They heard noise possibly from a falling stone.\nC) They were tired.\nD) They were hungry.\nE) They were lost.', ""Question 5:\nWhat did the children observe inside the cave?\nA) Blue rocks and signs of a picnic.\nB) A spring for drinking.\nC) Hal's light.\nD) Noise from falling stones.\nE) Snacks from Nora."", 'Question 6:\nWhat did Hal spot as the day waned?\nA) A large stone in the hillside.\nB) The elusive blue rocks.\nC) The cave entrance.\nD) The noisy falling stones.\nE) A picnic spot.']"|['B) He slipped and got his leg wet and muddy.', 'C) Ted slipped and got his leg wet.', 'B) Enter the cave.', 'B) They heard noise possibly from a falling stone.', 'A) Blue rocks and signs of a picnic.', 'A) A large stone in the hillside.']
"""Yes, they are,"" agreed Grandpa Martin, as he held one of the stones. ""There might be some iron in them, but not gold. Look out!"" he suddenly called as the stone slipped from his hand. The Curlytops and Hal laughed and jumped back. The blue stone hit the shovel with a clang, and a strange blue flame appeared. Mr. Martin examined the burning rock.

Mr. Weston approached Grandpa Martin, expressing interest in purchasing a meteor on the island. He explained that the blue rocks found by the children were part of the meteor they had been searching for. Mr. Weston and his friend had been looking for the meteor for a long time and were close to giving up until they found the blue rocks. They wanted the meteor for a museum connected to a college. The blue rocks were significant as they indicated the presence of the meteor. Mr. Weston recounted how they saw the campers but never got close. They had spent nights in a cave on the island while searching. Eventually, they found a piece of the meteor that emitted a blue flame when struck by a shovel.

"Ted, Janet, and Hal, along with other camp members, including Trouble, went to the hill where the big blue rock was hidden. Upon inspection, Mr. Weston confirmed it was the long-sought-after meteor. The museum directors purchased the fallen star from Grandpa Martin, restoring his lost crop money. Mr. Weston and Professor Anderson returned to the island with men to excavate the rock safely. Mr. Martin, surprised by the discovery, shared he had never believed the story of the fallen star. The children enjoyed their camping adventure on Star Island. In the next volume, ""The Curlytops Snowed In,"" the children have fun with skates and sleds. Ted invited Janet for one last ride with Nicknack before leaving the camp.
