"The speaker was Henri Martin, a French adolescent of the new type that has emerged in France since activities like football and tennis started to be widely promoted. He posed a question to his schoolmate, Frank Barnes, the son of a French mother and an American father. Frank's real name was Francois, influenced by his mother. Despite this, he embodied the traits of a typical American boy, evident in the contrast between his robust physique and the slender frame of Henri, his closest friend at the school they both attended near Paris, in St. Denis. ""I'm waiting for my uncle here at school,"" Frank explained. ""He's quite occupied and finds it challenging to visit whenever he wishes. He's expected to arrive early in August."" ""That won't do, Frank!"" exclaimed Henri. ""Come home with me until your uncle arrives. I live not too far away, in Amiens. We'll have a great time together. I'm joining the French Boy Scouts this vacation!"" Henri pronounced it as Boy Scoots, which made Frank burst into laughter. The French had adopted the Boy Scout movement from England, keeping the word ""scout"" but giving it a French pronunciation. ""It might sound funny to you, Frank,"" Henri said generously. ""But it's not a joke. We initially called ourselves Eclaireurs Francais, but General Baden-Powell preferred a change. We're quite similar to English and American scouts. We take the same oath, which we"|"['1. What is the main idea of the text?\nA. The differences between French and American adolescents\nB. The activities of the French Boy Scouts\nC.

"""Yes. My mother,"" he gulped a little at the word, ""wanted me to know all about France, and never to forget that I had French blood in me, you see. My French grandfather was killed by the Germans at Gravelotte--he was a colonel of the line. And my mother, even though my father was an American, was always devoted to France.""

""We are like that--we French,"" said Harry, simply. Into his eyes came the look that even French boys have when they remember the days of 1870.

""The Germans--yes, they beat us then. We were not ready--we were badly led. But our time will come--the time of La Revanche. Tell me, Frank, you have seen the Place de la Concorde, in Paris?""

""The day is coming when the black shall be stripped off! Alsace-Lorraine--they are French at heart, those lost provinces of ours! They shall be French again in name, too.

"""My friends are their friends,"" Harry said. ""My mom always says, 'Bring a friend, Henri.' We'll have lots to do. Long walks, tennis, riding, and shooting. Let's decide today. Come to the office with me. We'll ask the headmaster."" They went straight to see Monsieur Donnet, the school head. The school had English and American students learning French. Henri made their request. ""Yes, that's fine,"" Monsieur Donnet replied. ""Your uncle will visit in August. But there are rumors of war. When there's talk, there's no war. But if war comes, everyone will leave. So, it's better if you stay with Martin. That's good news, right?"" Henri said, ""We can't worry. What will be, will be. You're coming home with me, Frank.

"""It's great news for me,"" Frank exclaimed joyfully. ""Living in schools or hotels all the time gets tiring! Being in a home again, even if it's not mine, will feel wonderful!"" In late July, France, unlike many European countries, especially England and America, seemed less prone to trouble. Peace in Europe seemed secure, with President Poincare of France visiting the Czar of Russia, strengthening alliances. Despite tensions brewing, the French government aimed to suppress news to avoid public unrest. France, having learned from past mistakes, was prepared for any conflict, counting on alliances with Russia and potentially England. The government prioritized maintaining diplomatic victories to secure support. As tensions rose, France was ready, relying on allies to deter any aggression.

In France, life carried on calmly and peacefully, with soldiers active and new recruits joining the military. While some knew of the looming threat of war in Europe, many remained unaware. Suddenly, news broke that Austria had made impossible demands on Servia, leading to protests and mobilizations by Russia and Austria. Germany even issued an ultimatum to Russia. The situation escalated quickly, with talk of war spreading. Henri Martin explained to Frank that the Kaiser of Germany saw this as an opportunity to crush France. Lieutenant Marcel believed England's internal issues might deter them from joining the conflict. The tension was palpable, and the fear of war loomed large.|"['1.

"""Yes, I believe that. We're like that in America, too. Why, right after the Civil War, we nearly had to fight about Mexico. And the men in the South, who had just been fighting the northern army, were all ready to volunteer and fight for the country.""

""Well, that is one reason, then. And, for another, France is getting stronger, and Russia too. For a few years after the war with the Japanese, Russia was weak. But now she is getting strong again, and Austria is getting weaker. If Germany and Austria can ever win it is now--that is what the Kaiser believes. And why must France fight? Even if she is not attacked she must help Russia because of the treaty.""

It was during the morning recess that they held this conversation. Now the bell called them back to school. The class to which they went was one that was being taught by M. Donnet himself, the head master. He was at his place by his desk, and the boys had taken their seats. Suddenly, just as the master was about to speak, a servant appeared with a telegram in his hand. He took it to the master. M. Donnet tore it open and read it, while a serious, grave look came into his eyes. Then he stood up.

The school quickly emptied as the teachers, gardeners, and servants left for war, leaving behind only the boys and a few elderly men. St. Denis resembled a ghost town, with all the young men departing. A woman advised the boys to return home as the school would soon transform into a hospital. Despite the uncertainty, they planned to reunite in the future. They decided to head to Henri's aunt in Paris, navigating through the bustling station filled with soldiers and emotional farewells. Harry suggested traveling by bicycle, realizing it was a practical solution.

They easily executed their plan to keep using their bicycles, realizing it would be a mistake to abandon them during the war, as it was their only means of transportation. Riding through crowded roads into Paris, they saw countless refugees in cars heading out of the city towards England. Officers were prioritized for taxis, leaving civilians to find other ways to move around. The streets were bustling with men saying goodbyes and soldiers reporting for duty on designated days to avoid chaos.

"""Yes, and they are running them,"" said Henri, dryly. ""But not in Paris. They are on their way to the border, perhaps. Wherever they are, they are carrying soldiers or supplies. The government has always the right to take them all. Even at the time of the manoeuvres, some are taken, though not all. It is the same with the automobiles. In a few days there will be none left--the army will have them all. Officers need them to get around quickly. Generals cannot ride now--it is too slow to use a horse. You have heard of Leon Bollet?"" ""He is a famous automobile driver in races. He has won the Grand Prix. He will drive a general. He is a soldier, like all Frenchmen, and that will be his task--to drive some great general wherever he wants to go."" That was how the meaning of mobilization really came home to Frank, who learned more from the things he missed that he was accustomed to seeing than from new sights. In the boulevards, for instance, where as a rule the little tables in front of the cafes would be crowded, all the tables had vanished. That was a result of what was happening.

August was ending, and Henri and Frank remained in Paris. War had engulfed the city, with troops heading to the front. Paris was dark, illuminated only by searchlights due to the threat of German air attacks. Despite the chaos, Paris remained calm and resilient, with wounded soldiers returning and makeshift hospitals set up across the city. Harry and Frank sought news at bulletin boards, joining silent crowds eager for updates. Amidst the uncertainty, Henri and Frank discussed the war's progression, with Henri expressing confidence in France's defense.

"""I think so, and I hope so,"" said Frank. ""But if my mother were there, I would want to be there too. I've read a lot about war and battles recently, Harry, and I know that sometimes an army has to retreat, not because it's beaten, but because it's necessary for planned battles later on.

Amiens, a city reminiscent of a smaller Paris, holds a unique blend of being a bustling manufacturing town and a hub of ancient art. Currently, the city is quiet, with soldiers passing through its streets. Harry explained that Amiens serves as the headquarters for the second army corps, where reservists report regardless of their residence. The old citadel overlooks the town, its ancient battlements dismantled. Harry noted that in times of war, the city may not withstand an enemy's advance. As they observed French scouts in khaki uniforms, Henri greeted the scoutmaster, Monsieur Marron, who shared that the scouts were busy serving as messengers. The scoutmaster expressed hopes for peace amidst the current tasks, hinting at potential future challenges.|"['1.

Morning greeted the two friends with the sound of bugles playing reveille just outside their window. Excitedly, they jumped out of bed and rushed to the open window. In a nearby park in Amiens, white tents had appeared overnight, bustling with soldiers. A scout on a bicycle arrived and handed a letter to an officer. The boys quickly got ready for the day and headed downstairs to find Marie, the cook, ready with breakfast. Henri's mother, busy assisting the wounded in a Red Cross hospital, had already left for her duties. The boys shared a laugh about the French soldiers known as piou-pious and the arrival of English troops in France as allies. Despite the uncertainty of the situation, they found humor in the unique characteristics of the soldiers they encountered.|"['1.

"""We'll soon know, even if she can't tell us,"" Henri remarked. After breakfast, they quietly approached the kitchen. To their surprise, they found blushing infantrymen enjoying hot coffee and rolls, a different treat from the usual camp food. The soldier's face darkened as he recounted capturing Mulhouse and chasing the Uhlans. The joy of liberating Alsace was evident, but the return orders brought shame. Speculations arose about battles in France, unaware of the advancing Germans. Meanwhile, Frank and Henri, now disguised as scouts, reported to M. Marron for instructions.

In their task of guiding the refugees, the students learned more than any news reports could convey. The refugees, eager to share their stories, found solace in being heard. A woman with a baby expressed the sacrifices made for France and the hope for a better future. The students, well-versed in military strategies, understood the significance of troop movements on a map. They foresaw potential dangers in the Germans' maneuvers and the importance of defending the left flank.

Amiens, a city mentioned in the passage, holds little strategic importance compared to Rheims or Laon, which the Germans have captured. The uncertainty of the Germans' next move prompts discussion among the characters, recalling historical events like Napoleon's march to Moscow. The urgency of the situation is highlighted when a telephone call summons Henri and Frank for a task requiring English proficiency. With the troop's organization dissolved, each scout must act independently until further instructions are received. The passage conveys a sense of anticipation and readiness as the scouts await new orders from Colonel Menier, signaling a shift in their responsibilities and the need to adapt to changing circumstances.|"['1.

"""Let's search for Colonel Menier,"" Frank suggested. ""We can harm the Germans more by following orders than by causing harm. War is awful; let's not worsen it."" Frank, once again, explained his mixed heritage and French mother.

"""When you come back, Amiens might not have any French soldiers,"" he said. ""I'm aware. It's not time to fight yet. We won't fall into the Germans' trap by fighting where they want. We'll wait until we're ready. This isn't like 1870 when armies were wasted instead of retreating to better positions.

They continued their journey, and shortly after passing the post, they noticed some Uhlans who had stayed behind. These German soldiers were lying in their greenish gray uniforms by the roadside, a sight that sobered the boys. Despite only encountering a few Uhlans, they knew the war had claimed the lives of many. The boys rode in silence for a while, noticing the desolation around them. The women and elderly men working in the fields added to the eerie stillness. Suddenly, Henri realized the distant noise they heard was from a battle, the wind carrying the sound towards them.

"The closeness of the battle spurred them on, making them ride faster than before. The booming of the cannons ahead grew louder, and the noise changed gradually. Soon, distinct explosions pierced the battle hum, alongside a sharper, irregular noise. ""I hear rifle fire too,"" Frank remarked. ""It's lighter than the cannons but just as constant. Battles are raging from here to the Swiss border, near Verdun and the Vosges mountains."" A large vehicle approached, kicking up dust, followed by more. A British officer on a motorcycle appeared, dressed in khaki. ""You're...?"" the officer started, chuckling. ""I doubt it, lads! Follow us for a bit, but beware, you're nearing real combat!""

The road was sloping slightly, causing them to feel a bit more effort in pushing their bikes. As they reached the top of the incline, they noticed the officer had gotten off his motorcycle. He was unpacking a box and assembling a device that resembled a surveyor's tool, flashing a small mirror. The officer seemed puzzled by Frank and Henri's presence in the disputed area but didn't question them like a French or German officer might. He instructed them to continue guiding him and his team towards Guise. Frank, noticing something peculiar about the clock, raced back to inform Captain Hardy.

Hardy took no chances, quickly guessing the reason for the clock's strange behavior. He organized his men into an impromptu fort with the omnibuses in the village square. As English and German cavalry approached, their khaki uniforms made it hard to discern their allegiance. Frank noted the practicality of modern uniforms, unlike the showy ones of the past.

As they coasted down a small hill, Henri mentioned that another road intersected theirs just around a bend. Turning the corner, they were shocked to see soldiers in spiked helmets marching south on the crossroad. Startled, they abandoned their bicycles and hid by a hedge to avoid the German infantry. Frank speculated that the soldiers might have used the railway from Arras. Wondering why the enemy troops hadn't been spotted by airplanes, Henri explained that the aircraft were likely identifying enemy gun positions to target accurately.

They were now sheltered and safe from being seen. Despite this, they could still see the long line of German soldiers along the road, stretching for miles. Frank estimated they had close to five thousand men, traveling light without camp equipment. The Germans seemed to be on a forced march, likely heading to a specific location. Observing the troops turning off towards Hierville, Henri noted their familiarity with the area, taking a shortcut through a field. Frank believed the Germans had a carefully planned strategy, possibly catching the French and English off guard. Determined to inform headquarters, they decided to wait until dark to avoid detection and assess the troops' movements. Frank proposed scouting ahead while Henri stayed behind for safety.|"['1.

In the past, noisy airplane engines made it hard to talk while flying. But now, with quieter engines, chatting mid-flight is easy. This silence helps in military operations by keeping the plane's presence hidden. Greene shared a story about a scary encounter with fog during a flight. Lost in the fog, he climbed above it to find sunlight but faced bitter cold. Flying blind, he spiraled up, hoping for a break in the fog. Eventually, the fog cleared, and he landed on a golf course. Despite the ordeal, Greene was accused of intentionally landing there by a retired colonel.|"['1.

"Frank chuckled heartily at the tale but also suspected Captain Greene's motive in sharing it. He believed the captain aimed to uplift his morale, distracting him from his lack of flying experience, which made Frank appreciate and respect him even more, though he felt it was unnecessary. ""Yes,"" he agreed. ""There's the hill where we saw them, as we turned that corner. That's the road they were marching on, and those woods to our left. I wonder if they're still there."" ""You're fortunate,"" Greene remarked shortly. ""My first flights were unsettling, but you seem a natural. Yet, you may not fly much, that's how it goes!"" ""We must,"" Greene added. ""Then we'll return. We can't ascend in a straight line. Once, I climbed to twelve thousand feet, but ended up fifteen miles away. Look here. Do you have the flashlight?

"He guided the monoplane downward, silenced the engine, and smoothly descended, feeling the exhilarating thrill of gliding through the air. As the ground appeared alarmingly close, though still far below, he leveled the aircraft, restarted the engine, and circled back over the woods. Peering down, they found no signs of activity. ""Hmm,"" mused Greene. ""If they weren't Germans, I'd think your story was a fabrication. English or French troops would reveal themselves somehow. But these Germans are disciplined to a fault.""

Frank followed Greene's instructions, understanding his plan. Holding the torch pointing downwards, he saw the light beam shoot straight down. Though not strong enough to illuminate the treetops, it was visible from below. Greene explained the automatic's power and its use against unexpected enemies.

In the dim, rainy night, Harry cautiously approached the deserted inn. The scene was eerie, with furniture smashed and glass shattered.

Frank found a can of petrol in the cellar and knew it would be enough to fuel the monoplane. However, he heard Germans upstairs and realized they were blocking his escape. To prevent them from using the cellar as headquarters, he set fire to the wood soaked in petrol. The smoke filled the room, creating a diversion for him to escape.

Shortly after, he heard coughing from upstairs, indicating the smoke was spreading. A fire had caught, burning fiercely up the posts to the beams above. Frank was pleased to see the dry, old wood burning quickly. As the fire spread, cries replaced the coughing upstairs. The crucial moment arrived when someone opened the door upstairs, risking Frank's discovery. However, as the door opened, the smoke rushed up, causing the German to retreat. Frank seized the opportunity, slipped through the door, and found the hallway empty but filled with smoke. He made his way to the back, through the kitchen, and out into the fresh air. A sudden explosion behind him signaled the second can of petrol igniting. Frank realized his actions would expose the Germans and their plans.

From the fields to the inn, the distance was about a mile. He sensed something wrong a quarter mile from the meeting spot. A small noise alerted him, possibly a twig snapping or a foot slipping on mud. He knew he was being followed. Wondering why they didn't capture him, he realized they thought he was leading them to the plane. Determined to refill the plane's tank, he refused to give up. Remembering the flashlight in his pocket, he signaled to Captain Greene in Morse code, suspecting Germans were trailing him. He asked Greene to imitate an owl's cry if he understood, signaling to keep heading for the plane. Frank left the rest to Greene, having done his part.|"['1.

Two Germans were within sight, but they didn't stop him from signaling. He had planned for this. Dropping to the ground, he heard a footstep and a hoot of an owl. Skirting the fence, he reached the monoplane. Suddenly, a German told him to stop and grabbed his shoulder. A revolver shot rang out, but Frank's quick thinking saved the day. Speaking in German, Frank ordered them to get in the plane. He made a bonfire to signal for help. The monoplane took off, and there was finally time for explanations.|['1.

""Yes, sir,"" saluted Greene. ""The Germans are in a cluster of woods on the Amiens road, near the intersection with the LaFere road. I estimate around five thousand soldiers.""

""No, sir. They damaged my tank, and I had to wait to refuel before returning. All my fuel leaked before I could land to patch the hole. Did you start your search at the sight of the burning house?""

"For a while, there was loud gunfire coming from the woods where the Germans were stationed. The sounds gradually faded. General Smith-Derrien exchanged a meaningful look with one of his staff colonels and allowed himself a rare smile during the difficult retreat days.

""Colonel Mewbray is on the field phone, sir,"" he informed the general. ""He connected with our wires here. The horse artillery surrounded the German position in the woods and shelled them for ten minutes. The Germans stopped firing, and when we used searchlights, they displayed white flags.

Henri swiftly took the wheel with Frank by his side. Having learned to drive from his father, Henri demonstrated his skill by confidently starting the car. Once familiar with the vehicle, he showcased its power with a quick turn and a roar into the night. As they navigated the muddy roads, they encountered traffic and the distant sound of the ongoing battle. Passing through fields lit by troop encampments, they were halted by a French guard. Presenting the pass from Major Cooper, they were allowed to proceed. The journey led them away from the skirmish sounds, prompting Frank to comment on the eerie quiet. Deciding to head towards Abbeville and then Boulogne in search of German forces, they altered their route to avoid Amiens, where signs of German invasion were evident.|"['1.

Frank and Henri quickly realized the imminent danger as they spotted two large airships approaching. They hurried to the barrels containing petrol, knowing they needed to act fast. Frank swiftly dug a hole and created a trench towards the barrels. He opened the tap, allowing the gasoline to flow into the trench. Using copper wire from their car, Frank set up a plan. As the airships drew closer, the boys were ready. The gasoline in the trench was strategically placed. The airships flew low, and as they passed over the trench, Frank ignited the gasoline. A massive explosion rocked the sky, causing the airships to veer off course. Frank and Henri had successfully thwarted the impending threat.|"['1.

He pondered if his strategy would succeed and if he could execute it. Would he have the courage to act as planned during the final test? Time to decide would come later. Meanwhile, many things could go wrong and ruin his plan. All he could do now was wait. Each moment of waiting brought the climax closer. The sound of airship motors grew louder, accompanied by distant battle noises. Suddenly, men emerged from the inn, surprising him with their concealment. But pondering this was useless. Instead, he observed keenly as the men surrounded a massive aerial battleship, becoming its crew. With a spark, he ignited the petrol-filled hole, causing a chain reaction that destroyed the enemy's air fleet. The success of Frank's plan was evident as the flames spread, sealing the fate of the German raid.|['1. What was Frank pondering at the beginning of the passage?\nA. His courage and strategy\nB.

Their one chance to escape was to reach their car before the Germans recovered. They didn't move quietly now, fearing delay. The distance seemed longer than before. Finally, they neared the house used by the Germans. A man in civilian clothes but with a German officer's cap rushed out with a pistol. They ran, and the man, startled, slowed them down. In the light, he recognized them as the boys from earlier. Fuming, he prepared to shoot. Frank, following orders, stopped to protect Henri.

Suddenly, a cry of horror escaped him as Henri, a bit ahead, had not stopped as quickly as Frank. The German officer, in a fit of rage, raised his pistol and fired at the French boy point-blank. But to his surprise, the pistol only clicked as it was unloaded. He tried twice more, but the revolver was empty. Enraged, the German officer was caught off guard by Frank's attack. Frank managed to subdue him, showing that even a weaker person can overpower a stronger one with the right technique. Shots rang out behind them, prompting the boys to run and seek cover in a ditch. Escaping in their car, they sped away with the engine roaring, leaving behind the futile attempts of the pursuers. Frank, seething with anger, condemned the officer's cowardly actions.|"['1.

Frank and Henri had a thrilling adventure involving airships and a daring escape. Frank speculated that the airships might have been headed to Paris to cause havoc. As they drove to safety, they felt relief knowing they had evaded danger. They discussed plans to bring French troops to defend Paris and outmaneuver the Germans.

France will not forget your valor. I am heading to Paris to provide reports. I will commend you to the authorities. And who knows?"" He playfully pinched their ears, a gesture cherished by French soldiers since the days of Napoleon, who considered it an honor greater than the Legion of Honor.

After the departure of the staff officers, Amiens took on a new look. The sounds of guns and rifle fire echoed in the streets. Smoke billowed from burning villages nearby, marking the relentless advance of the Germans. Henri expressed anger at the destruction, while Frank envisioned a future where the French would triumph over the invaders. Despite the imminent threat, the Germans did not arrive, and Frank and Henri remained vigilant in the Martin house, offering shelter to scouts and refugees.

Before the Germans arrived in Amiens, the military authorities ordered no resistance. The mayor, with the police and Boy Scouts, collected all firearms from citizens to protect the town's landmarks. Frank and Henri, working in pairs, convinced people to surrender their guns to prevent destruction like in Belgium. When the Germans arrived, the mayor surrendered the town peacefully. The German lieutenant warned that any attack would be punished, but peaceful behavior would be respected. The town had to accommodate thousands of troops, and supplies would be requisitioned. The scouts' efforts in disarming the town played a crucial role in saving Amiens from destruction.|"['1.

"""My orders are to make no resistance,"" he said. ""I bow to the inevitable, regretting that we are not permitted to defend ourselves to the death. Amiens will keep its faith. No attack will be made, since that would mean treachery. I will order the gendarmes and the Boy Scouts to clear the square."" Frank and Henri were of great assistance in doing this work, Frank taking the lead, since no patrol leader happened to be in evidence. They and the police soon drove the people back, and the Uhlans dismounted. There, in the public square, used as a market place, they proceeded to cook a meal, making a fire in the street. From the sides of the square the people watched them sullenly. But there was no demonstration, since both the police and the scouts had explained that anything of the sort was likely to mean the execution of the mayor, who was within the power of the enemy. As soon as the public curiosity to see the hated invaders had been somewhat satisfied, the people were urged to go to their homes, and by mid-afternoon the streets were deserted. Then began the entrance of the real force of occupation. At the head rode a general of brigade, a somber, stern-eyed man, accompanied by his staff.

That evening, Amiens was under German control. Trains filled with troops passed through the city, some carrying wounded soldiers whose cries echoed in the quiet night. In the distance, the sound of gunfire towards Paris grew louder. Surprisingly, even the Boy Scouts were found useful by the Germans. The city faced constant danger, and the Germans, not wanting to destroy Amiens, utilized the scouts as intermediaries. The scouts helped gather supplies for the Germans and relayed messages between the German staff and French authorities. Strict rules were imposed, citizens had to salute German officers, adhere to curfews, and risked arrest or execution for being out past curfew. The city was under martial law, with hostages held at the Hotel de Ville. Amid the uncertainty, Frank believed a significant battle was underway, though the outcome remained unknown.|['1.

The day after concluding that it was hard to know what was happening, a significant event occurred. Most of the soldiers in Amiens headed south, leaving only a small group to guard the town and manage the railway. The movement of troops suggested that the battle was intensifying beyond the German's expectations. Frank speculated that the fighting was likely at the Marne River, where entrenchments were made during a previous retreat. Henri added that the terrain there was challenging, recalling his father's advice from 1870. Despite the discomfort of obeying German orders, the scouts carried out their duties diligently. Frank observed that the recent troops were likely reserves, tasked with securing communication lines and fortresses. The town bustled with officers overseeing supplies for the frontline troops, working tirelessly day and night.|['1.

Men fight best when well-fed, a fact the Germans understood. Soldiers were never sent into battle hungry. Amiens was a hub for the German flying corps, with many aviators and damaged planes needing repair. One day, two scouts on bicycles were startled by a fierce shout from an angry officer. Frank recognized him as the one who had fired at Henri during the Zeppelin incident. Fearing capture, Frank sped away, knowing the consequences if caught. The officer's hate for them was evident, and Frank knew they faced death if captured. Despite the risk, Frank hoped Henri would understand his flight was to save them both. Frank reasoned that the officer did not recognize him, giving him a chance to move freely in town. The Boy Scouts, trusted by the Germans, had certain freedoms, like being out after curfew, and had friendly relations with some German soldiers.|"['1.

Frank had recently made a discovery that he couldn't shake from his mind. Determined to rescue his friend, Henri, who was unjustly arrested, Frank devised a plan. Late at night, Frank tapped a Morse code signal on Henri's window, signaling his intent to help. Despite Henri's reluctance, Frank led him to the river where they swam silently to a hidden boat under cover. The daring escape unfolded under the cloak of darkness, with Frank risking his liberty and life to free Henri from his wrongful confinement. The two boys, skilled swimmers, navigated the treacherous waters, evading capture and finding refuge in a hidden boat, ready to sail to safety.|"[""1.

"""I'm guiding it with my hands against the wall,"" Frank whispered. ""That will lead us to the opening - the smallest for the boat to enter the stream. The current will take us downstream. I have a rudder to keep us close to the left bank. It's a risk - our only one. If all goes well, we'll drift past the city and be safe!"" They entered the Somme's current, facing a time of fear and trial. Every sound made them fear discovery. They didn't dare look out. Their odds were slim. Hours passed, and Frank hoped they were far from the city by dawn. Light seeped in, but they stayed hidden. Their success grew, but capture was a risk. ""Join me,"" Frank said. ""You'll have my best - not much! Dry clothes and my son's war blouse."" They heard the French and English were winning. ""Let's join them,"" Frank exclaimed.

There was a noticeable shift in the battle's character overnight. The loud gun noises had lessened, hinting that the Germans might be retreating towards the north. After walking for hours, the group encountered French infantry instead of the expected cuirassiers. The French soldiers, in their Boy Scout uniforms, were greeted warmly by the locals. A captain praised the boys for their courage and promised a surprise in Amiens. The return to Amiens was swift, greeted by tricolor flags and jubilant crowds celebrating the departure of the Germans. French and English troops paraded through the town, creating a festive atmosphere. The group arrived at the Hotel de Ville, where Colonel Menier was welcomed with salutes and free passage.|"[""1.
