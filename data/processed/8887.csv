Mr. Maynard reached out his hand to his son, and as King took hold of it, he sensed that his father's strong stance on the matter was a more powerful admonishment and a more effective teaching moment than any specific punishment could offer. Some marks, like those on glass vases or metal ornaments, could be easily wiped away with a damp cloth, but most were on delicate surfaces like plaster casts or polished wood, requiring careful handling. The meaningful exchange between father and son conveyed a lot, and King went to bed feeling that he was no longer a child in his father's eyes. Marjorie expressed her reluctance about a change, but her parents proposed a new plan for her education, which turned out to be a success. The plan not only improved her learning but also fostered a strong friendship with her classmate, Delight. Her mother explained the importance of being a good hostess to Marjorie, emphasizing the balance between old and new friendships.|"[""1.

"""Get ready, young explorers,"" her father exclaimed. ""Imagine you're on a safari! Go hunt for animals to fill your arks. Elephants are worth five points, tigers ten, lions fifteen, and so on. Once your arks are full, we'll tally the points and award prizes. Now, go!"" The children dashed off excitedly, scouring every nook and cranny for the hidden animals.
