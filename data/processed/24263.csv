A French cavalry captain shared a heartwarming story about a horse that couldn't eat due to old age. Two kind horses on its sides helped by chewing the hay and oats before giving them to the elderly horse, enabling it to eat. This act of compassion shows the bond between animals. Similarly, orangutans have shown intelligence by using stones as wedges to open oysters without getting hurt. Another touching tale is of M. Sonnini's Angora cat, a beautiful and loving companion.

A clever French dog once faced a tricky situation. On his way back from a restaurant with his master's dinner, two dogs tried to snatch his food. The brave dog defended his meal against one dog while the other began stealing. Realizing he couldn't beat both, he cleverly ate the remaining food himself to save it from the other dog. Later, he returned to his master with an empty basket. Similarly, the Indian ichneumon, a small creature, bravely fights snakes to protect travelers.

She bravely examined it and even used her paw to check for any danger, eventually conquering her fear and playing with it joyfully.
