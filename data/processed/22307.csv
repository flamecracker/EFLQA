The search for Greg continued all day, shrouded in mystery. The Grammar School boys felt a sense of loss, likening it to a family tragedy. Len Spencer hesitated to print his suspicions about Ab. Dexter due to fear of legal consequences. Despite this, the police, militia officers, and fire-department officials organized search parties. The fire chief instructed them to spread out in the countryside while maintaining communication to share any findings. The search party was given a detailed description of Greg's clothing and the gunny sack he carried. Captain Hall emphasized the importance of finding any clues, urging everyone to stay vigilant. The search proved slow and challenging, with halts for potential clues like footprints. Eventually, they paused at a farmhouse to buy food, fueling up for the ongoing search.|"['1.

Dave Darrin followed closely behind the leader, with Dan Dalzell in third place. Dan consoled himself with the idea that if Dick and Dave encountered danger, he would have enough time to escape. Suddenly, a noise caught their attention, prompting Dick to cautiously investigate. As Dick moved away with the light, Dave and Dan were left in darkness. Soon, the boys stumbled upon a spring where Greg rinsed his mouth to get rid of a bad taste. They had been found after the town turned out to search for them.

Greg shared his harrowing experience of being abducted and taken on a mysterious journey in a wagon. He described being covered with old sacking and feeling a gag in his mouth. Greg suspected the culprits were Dexter and Driggs, overhearing their conversation about scolding each other for throwing bricks. Dexter believed that abducting Greg would frighten a woman and make her realize the seriousness of the situation. In contrast, the other man thought it was a foolish idea and could lead to trouble. However, he suggested that the woman would pay handsomely to secure Greg's release due to her kind nature. Greg recalled hearing the men leave the cave after discussing their plans. As the group discussed Greg's account, they heard Gridley's fire alarm whistle in the distance, signaling the recall for all search parties.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Greg feel in his mouth during the abduction?\nA) A sock\nB) A gag\nC) A piece of cloth\nD) A rope\nE) A handkerchief', 'Question 2:\nWho did Greg suspect were the culprits behind his abduction?\nA) Gridley and Driggs\nB) Dexter and Gridley\nC) Dexter and Driggs\nD) Gridley and Dexter\nE) Driggs and Gridley', ""Question 3:\nWhy did Dexter believe abducting Greg was a good idea?\nA) To teach Greg a lesson\nB) To frighten a woman\nC) To prank Driggs\nD) To play a game\nE) To test Greg's bravery"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did the other man think of Dexter's idea to abduct Greg?\nA) It was brilliant\nB) It was foolish\nC) It was necessary\nD) It was funny\nE) It was dangerous"", ""Question 5:\nWhat did the other man suggest the woman would do to secure Greg's release?\nA) Threaten the culprits\nB) Offer a reward\nC) Call the police\nD) Leave Greg in captivity\nE) Ignore the situation"", ""Question 6:\nWhat signaled the recall for all search parties during the discussion?\nA) Greg's scream\nB) Gridley's whistle\nC) Dexter's call\nD) Driggs' signal\nE) The woman's cry""]"|"['B) A gag', 'C) Dexter and Driggs', 'B) To frighten a woman', 'B) It was foolish', 'B) Offer a reward', ""B) Gridley's whistle""]"
