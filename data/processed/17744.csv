Lifeboat drills became a routine, preparing passengers for potential attacks. As they neared the perilous zone, precautions were taken, such as dimming lights and keeping life preservers handy at all times.

Amidst the tension, a mysterious encounter with Lieutenant Secor, a Frenchman, and a suspicious passenger claiming American citizenship but believed to be German, Levi Labenstein, raised alarms. The boys observed a secretive meeting between the two men, fueling their curiosity and fear.

"""Sure he is!"" declared Charlie. ""He's no more a real Jew than I am! He's a Teuton! Germany has no love for the Jews, and they don't have any use for the Huns. Take my word for it, fellows, there's something wrong going on here.""

In silence, the boys observed the two men in their peculiar meeting. The tilted mirrors in each stateroom provided a clear view of the conversation between the Frenchman and the German, or as the boys suspected, Labenstein. The boys remained unnoticed as the men occasionally glanced up at the mirrors on their wall but gave no sign of detecting anything unusual. Despite the open transoms, the boys couldn't hear the conversation due to the men speaking quietly.

Joe stopped speaking when Blake gestured towards the mirror. They saw the reflection of the men in the other cabin and quickly put away any papers they had been examining. A sudden knock interrupted them, catching the boys off guard. Blake responded and covered the mirror with a cloth to prevent the Frenchman from noticing its reflective position.

Lieutenant Secor entered, claiming to have just come down from the deck and offering the boys the opportunity to capture views of a special lifeboat drill. Suspicious of the Frenchman's false statement, Joe and Charlie pretended to adjust the camera, while Blake maintained a welcoming demeanor despite his distrust."|"['1.

Joe and Charlie decided to head up on deck, carrying a small camera with them. As they emerged, they noticed an unusual lifeboat drill in progress. Captain Merceau and his crew were taking precautions due to the ship being in a danger zone. The passengers were practicing getting into the lifeboats, which were being lowered into the water for the drill. Amidst this, there was a commotion as one of the boat's falls got jammed, causing the boat to tilt sharply and spill its occupants into the ocean. Despite the initial panic, the situation turned into a light-hearted affair as the sailors, who were good swimmers, were quickly picked up by another boat.

Suddenly, the periscope vanished, and the submarine emerged, revealing its steel-plated back. Chaos ensued as passengers rushed to the lifeboats. A torpedo was launched towards the ship but narrowly missed. The gunners retaliated, hitting the submarine. After a tense moment, the submarine disappeared beneath the waves.

On the ship _Jeanne_, there was a mix of fear and excitement as another unidentified craft approached. An officer warned everyone in English about the danger. The _Jeanne_ had managed to fend off the submarine but wasn't certain if it had been damaged. Suddenly, a fast-approaching destroyer from the United States arrived, followed by two more destroyers. The passengers felt relieved, but the danger wasn't over. They remained vigilant for more submarines. A suspicious passenger's actions raised concerns about possible signaling to the enemy.

Blake and his friends discussed the situation after putting away the films of the submarine attack. They agreed that it was best to wait and see, as having only one witness wouldn't lead to much if they reported Labenstein. A visitor, Mr. Labenstein, asked to borrow an electric flash lamp, explaining that his was broken and he needed light in his berth due to the danger posed by the Germans. He offered to return it at the end of the voyage or buy it at a good price, mentioning his Jewish heritage and willingness to make a deal. Blake, cautious, inquired further, noting that each of them had a lamp and that Labenstein might be trying to take advantage of their situation.

"The guest observed Blake intently as he revealed a flat, three-cell nickel-plated battery holder with a white-backed, tungsten-filamented light in a recessed socket. ""I cannot accept this without payment,"" Mr. Labenstein insisted after turning on the light. Blake explained that the lamp shines brightest before the battery dies, likening it to a fountain pen running out of ink. Blake's strategy was to let the failing light confuse any potential submarine threats. Joe praised Blake's clever plan to use the light as a decoy.

His room is next to Labenstein's, and we can spot them if they sneak out after dark—if we stay vigilant."" As evening fell and the ship's lights dimmed, the boys split the night into shifts to guard against what they feared was treachery. ""It won't be good luck if they signal a submarine,"" Blake remarked. ""But it'll be a stroke of luck if we can stop it."" Blake kept a close eye on the neighboring rooms through a hole in their door. Suddenly, Labenstein emerged, followed by Lieutenant Secor.

"Blake responded, ""We'll need to search."" Glancing across the deck, they found no one. Just as they turned away, a figure emerged from behind a boat and challenged them. ""We're looking for Lieutenant Secor and Mr. Labenstein,"" Blake explained. ""Have you seen them?""""Yes, they mentioned stepping out for fresh air,"" the sailor replied. ""You'll find them near the bow. Don't use any light or matches. If you want to smoke, go below.""Silently, the boys moved forward, suspecting the two men of foul play.

The passengers panicked, but another explosion confirmed the submarine's destruction. Blake explained the principle of how a depth charge works with incompressible water transmitting explosive force.

The boys understood that solid evidence was necessary to convict the plotters. While they were convinced the men had tried to sabotage the French ship, legal proof was crucial. Blake realized they could only report about the borrowed light and the flashing incident, which might not be enough. They concluded that searching the suspects' belongings for incriminating evidence was vital, a task they couldn't perform. So, they waited. Despite the men's suspicious behavior, nothing concrete could be pinned on them. The boys stayed vigilant against submarine attacks, but the alarms were false.

The boys, Blake, Joe, and Charlie, were preparing for a new film project when suddenly, a cloud of deadly chlorine gas drifted towards them. Private Drew, with his experience in combat, quickly warned them of the danger. The gas masks worn in the trenches were their only defense against the lethal gas. The masks were simple but effective, with cloth helmets saturated in chemicals to neutralize the chlorine. Despite the protection, wearing the masks was a struggle as it made breathing difficult.

As non-combatant representatives of the army, the boys readied themselves for a risky mission. They ensured their pistols were working and got new gas masks with fresh chemicals. They applied lampblack on their hands and faces to avoid detection by German searchlights. Despite the danger, they armed themselves and ventured into enemy territory.

The group faced a perilous mission near the German lines, risking sniper detection or machine gun fire. The slightest movement could trigger a deadly response. Blake instructed his friends to drop and lie still at any sign of light, using lampblack to hide. As they cautiously moved through the darkness, they encountered the tragic sight of fallen soldiers left unburied. Suddenly, a bright illumination of No Man's Land exposed them.

For about five minutes, bright lights shone on the blood-stained ground, and there were sporadic gunshots. The American and French soldiers fired back, but the outcome was uncertain. Darkness eventually returned, bringing relief to the boys. Their journey was far from over, especially the return trip if they survived. They crept along cautiously, knowing it was unsafe to stand.

They were then brought to the German army's headquarters, where a sudden air raid by French and American airships startled everyone. The Germans abandoned guarding the boys to man their anti-aircraft guns. The boys watched in awe as the aircraft approached in formation, resembling great birds. Blake speculated that the raid was well-planned by their side, given the quick German response. They sought shelter, expecting the air raid to target the camp. The thrilling sight of the airships flying overhead left the boys amazed by the speed and precision of the attack.|"['1.

As they spoke, a white cloud burst near one of the aircraft, causing it to dip and plunge before straightening out again. Blake, Joe, and their assistant spotted what seemed like a tunnel entrance, illuminated by electric lamps. As they dashed inside, the airships bombarded the area. Racing through the tunnel, they heard explosions from the bombardment above. The tunnel was well-made, allowing them to run upright, with enough space for three abreast. Blake realized the tunnel sloped gradually underground, leaving them vulnerable to bombs. They continued deeper into the tunnel, where the airships' attack caused darkness and silence. Blake tried to turn on a light but found himself trapped under dirt and rocks. Joe, regaining consciousness, felt like a volcano had fallen on him, struggling to breathe under the debris.|['1.

No one replied, but Joe, feeling his strength return, dared to move. He managed to free himself from the earth and stones that had fallen on him, luckily none on his head. Using his pocket lamp, he spotted Blake and Charlie nearby, covered in debris like him. They worked together to clear the rubble. Blake had a head wound, but was otherwise okay. They agreed to dig out. Despite their efforts, progress was slow. Charlie cried out as they realized they were not making much headway. Blake called for help, and someone on the other side began clearing the rocks. They emerged into a small room with logs for walls and roof, where they found a man and a ragged blue uniformed man.

"The Frenchman winced, but a call from a man in the corner caught his attention. Bending over him, he uncovered Labenstein's face in the lantern light. ""Please don't say it,"" the lieutenant pleaded. ""I had to pretend. But now, I can fight openly for France. I've learned the spy's secrets and where leaks came from. My mission is done.""""I'm a French Secret Service member,"" the Frenchman declared. ""I pretended to gain his trust and learn Germany's sources. Now, I know.

They left the room, once a German shelter, and found American soldiers in the trenches. Later, the boys learned the raid preceded a big offensive, driving back the Germans and destroying an ammunition dump. The soldiers welcomed the boys, glad to have the valuable films back.
