Henry's sister, asleep in the wagon, woke up and asked for water. Mr. Ware was slow to respond, but Henry immediately offered to help. With a tin cup in hand, he got out of the wagon barefoot. Henry was used to the outdoors and didn't mind the rough ground. As he walked towards the spring, he noticed the tethered animals were restless. Henry tried to calm them down, but they were still uneasy. He quickly fetched water for his sister. While at the spring, he saw two glowing eyes in the forest. It was a panther ready to attack. Remembering advice from Ross, he bravely confronted the panther with a flaming torch, scaring it away.

In a beautiful valley, the travelers saw the sun rise, lifting their spirits. Mr. Ware, usually reserved, was moved by the sight. They found the valley fertile and beautiful, with clearings ideal for their new city, Wareville. With dry weather in midsummer, they built log houses close together for safety. Men cut trees into logs for walls, while puncheons made the floors. Each house had a window, door, and a stone chimney.

Near the river bank, two miles away, a spring attracted wildlife at sundown. Henry, armed with his rifle, felt a surge of manhood and nerves. His gun, modeled after a Western rifle, was his prized possession. With a powderhorn and bullets, he joined Ross and Sol near the spring. The forest turned crimson in the setting sun, casting a lonely spell. Choosing a spot to teach Henry, they waited in silence. The night fell dark, the wind whispered, and the trio remained motionless. As Henry's eyes adjusted, a deer emerged at the forest's edge. The stag, unaware of danger, surveyed its surroundings.

In the wild, Henry aimed his rifle at a stag. His hand trembled, but Ross and Shif'less Sol pretended not to notice. Suppressing his pity, Henry fired, proud of his marksmanship yet feeling remorse. He shared his success with his family, and they worked on furnishing their home. They dried animal skins for warmth and decoration, and made simple furniture like stools and chairs. Mrs. Ware and the children helped, creating a cozy atmosphere. The family also made tables and a stone oven.

The boys were hot and sweaty, so they shed their clothes and jumped into the water, enjoying the refreshing coolness. Unaware of the approaching storm, they lingered in the water until the sky darkened, and the wind picked up. Thunder rumbled, and lightning struck. Startled, they scrambled out of the water and quickly dressed. As the storm gathered, the boys, sons of the forest, welcomed the rain to end the drought. The sky filled with rolling clouds, lightning flashed, and thunder roared, frightening the cattle.

Away the cow ran, with her pursuers behind her. The rain poured through the woods, falling in sheets. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled less often. The boys got drenched but didn't notice. Darkness covered the forest, and they grasped hands for company. Rain blinded them, making them uncomfortable. They headed back to Wareville, tripping on vines. Seeking a light from the blockhouse tower, they found none. Lost, they stayed strong, knowing they'd find Wareville by midnight. Rain stopped, the moon appeared, but they didn't recognize their surroundings. Lost and weary, they leaned against an oak tree, disheartened. They laughed at their situation and wrung out their coats. The warm wind dried them, but they were so sleepy. Their wilderness skills helped them cope.|['1.

In a hilly land with caves and stones, two tired boys searched for a place to rest. Hungry and sleepy, they found a sheltered ledge. Surrounded by darkness, they lay down on the hard stone, falling asleep quickly. The bright morning sun woke them. The world was beautiful, but hunger gnawed at them. Alone in the vast wilderness, they felt small. Despite this, they found joy in their situation, showing courage. To ease their hunger, they chewed slippery-elm tree bark and ate wild plums and blackberries. They knew they needed more substantial food but lacked the means to hunt.

Henry and Paul found themselves in a challenging situation in the wilderness. They decided to try fishing with a homemade rod and bait, catching a fine perch after several attempts. Lighting a fire proved difficult, but they eventually succeeded, cooking and enjoying their fish over the flames. Knowing they needed to prepare for the future, they planned to make a fish trap and discussed setting snares for rabbits. Henry demonstrated how to set up a snare using pegs, a cord, and a trigger.

In early Kentucky, boys crafted clever snares to catch small game. Henry and Paul set up four of these devices, using plantain leaves as bait for rabbits. Satisfied with their work, they hungered for supper but were too exhausted to fish. As the sun dipped low, they gathered fallen brushwood for a blazing fire that lit up the forest. Lying on the soft turf, Henry gazed at the setting sun and pondered the vast wilderness beyond. Enthralled by the idea of freedom in the wild, he envisioned floating down rivers and witnessing thundering herds of buffalo. Amidst the peaceful night, a distant panther's cry pierced the air, chilling Henry. Despite the danger, the crackling bonfire kept them safe. As he lay awake, Henry heard the panther's approach, feeling its soft steps through the ground. With a tense heart, he watched the dark forms of the approaching predators, thankful for the protection of the roaring flames.|"['1.

Henry was not scared, even though it was strange to see two powerful predators circling the fire near where two unarmed boys rested. He understood that the beasts were not there to attack but were intrigued by fear. The fire was like a magnet to them, like a snake to a bird. He wished for his gun, safely hanging over his bed at home. As he gazed at the larger panther, he thought about making them regret approaching. The panthers dashed away through the trees, frightened by the fiery sight. Henry knew they wouldn't return soon. Paul, less familiar with panthers, was uneasy. Henry assured him of the animals' timid nature. After a successful rabbit catch, they cooked and ate it, then focused on fishing for more food by the creek, deciding to stay put for safety and sustenance.|"[""1.

"""Look, Paul!"" exclaimed Henry, dropping his stick and grabbing his friend's hand. ""Just a little further, and we'll be safe! Over this hill, the fire can't reach us!"" Although it was just a hopeful guess, Henry's words spurred Paul on. As they reached the top of the hill, both boys cheered in relief. Ahead lay an open field with a glistening stream cutting through the center. Energized by the sight, they sprinted out of the forest towards the water. Jumping in, Henry felt the rocky bottom beneath him and pulled Paul up. Together, they found a sandbar to stand on as the fire raged around them.

The boys gazed back at the path they had traversed, feeling a mix of relief and sorrow as they saw the once majestic forest now reduced to a desolate ruin. Charred trunks stood like burnt houses, while smoke rose from the scorched earth. Despite the heat and smoke, they ventured towards the forest's remains.

In the heart of the wild, a sudden new sound pierced the air, sending shivers through the timid creatures. A faint, distant quaver on the wind made the ring of eyes retreat into the forest. Rabbits and deer fled in fear, while even the wild cat, though snarling bravely, scampered away. Henry and Paul slept on, unaware of the danger lurking. Henry, with his keen senses, stirred in his sleep, feeling the alarm. As the eerie whine grew closer, Henry awoke abruptly, realizing the imminent threat of a pack of wolves.

Paul gazed down, meeting the eyes of the largest wolf, feeling a strange pull towards the ground. Henry warned him to stick close to the safety of the big beech tree. As the wolves circled below, Paul clung to the tree tightly. Henry, pleased to see Paul regain his humor, looked down at the wolves, patiently waiting for their prey. The wolves, with their red eyes glowing in the moonlight, remained still, waiting for their meal. The night passed slowly, with the wolves growing more impatient. The wolves sensed a new scent and saw the two boys in the tree as a tantalizing treat.

The old leader sensed the darkness thinning as the dawn approached, filling him with fear. The first light in the east, gray and faint, intensified his dread. His howl mixed anger and disappointment. The forest's black veil turned gray, the eastern light growing intense and hostile. The wolf's terror increased as the sun rose, its fierce beams blinding him. The earth bathed in a golden glow, driving the wolf and his pack into a panic. Henry and Paul, after a perilous night, left swiftly, haunted by the forest.

Paul quickly grew silent, his senses sharpened by the wilderness life. Crouched together, the boys watched as a line of Indian warriors passed, silent and ghostly, through the foliage. Paul's instinct to move away from the tree saved them from detection. The boys, fearful yet mesmerized, counted fourteen warriors passing by. The warriors, likely Cherokees, traveled swiftly southward. The boys, now alone, began building a raft to continue their journey down the river. Using their poles to steer, they floated through dense forests and towering cliffs, reveling in the untouched beauty of the wilderness.

On the raft, Paul and Henry had dinner while floating peacefully. They couldn't tell how fast they were moving. Paul found a cozy spot and fell asleep. Henry kept watch over him and scanned the surroundings. The raft glided smoothly with the current, like a bubble on the water. The scenery was serene, with the water shimmering in shades of silver and gold from the sunlight. The trees, touched by early autumn, hung over the stream. In the distance, a misty haze covered the forest. As they drifted, they saw smoke in the distance, signaling familiar territory. Paul woke to shouts and saw familiar faces - Ross and Sol. Henry steered the raft to shore, and they were reunited with their friends, who had tirelessly searched for them.

In the following days, as Henry ventured into the forest, he felt the wilderness teeming with life. Game was abundant, but Henry, not one to take the easy path, had to work for his rewards. The late touch of spring quickly faded as frost crept in, painting the forest in vibrant reds, yellows, and browns. From the blockhouse tower, Henry admired the kaleidoscope of colors, declaring this his favorite time of year. With the impending cold weather, he anticipated new challenges in hunting and exploring the wilderness. As autumn deepened, the foliage blazed with intense colors, captivating the settlers who now spent most of their time hunting. Henry and his companions discovered a beaver dam, learning to trap and cook the beavers.

As winter arrived early in Wareville after Indian summer, with cold rain turning to snow, Henry found himself spending more time indoors. Reverend Silas Pennypacker opened a school for the winter, obliging Henry to attend. The pioneers in Kentucky valued education, establishing schools to ensure their children's growth. Reverend Silas, a jolly and scholarly figure, was well-liked in Wareville. Despite Henry's reluctance at nearly sixteen, he respected his father's wish for another winter at school. With about thirty students, Mr. Pennypacker focused on providing a solid education.

Mr. Pennypacker observed Henry closely, foreseeing him as a future leader in action rather than a scholar.

The students, stirred by patriotism, felt a strong desire to stand with their countrymen in the east.

The boys huddled together, their excitement palpable. Henry's heart raced with the news from the Massachusetts town. The thought of going there consumed him, but Paul disagreed. The people of Wareville remained oblivious to the war's progress. The winter's cold grip kept them isolated from the outside world. Despite the snow-covered mountains and forests, the Kentuckians were well-prepared. They lived off the land, trapping game and fishing in icy rivers. As the snow melted, floods threatened, but Wareville stood safe on high ground. Henry, resilient to sickness, braved the wet wilderness. The approaching spring whispered to him, beckoning him to the woods, away from human faces, to live as one with nature.|"[""1.

Henry's behavior had changed; he showed disinterest in his duties and sometimes lacked appetite. His mother suspected illness when she noticed this change. However, his father suggested that fresh air might do him good. So, Henry took his rifle and ventured alone into the wilderness, leaving his friend Paul behind. Surrounded by nature, he felt invigorated by the signs of new life around him. The young grass, budding trees, and the sweet scent of the Southern wind filled him with joy. Henry relished the solitude, finding companionship in nature's whispers. As he gazed at the wild turkeys on the hill, he felt a deep connection to the world, yearning to explore the vast forests and rivers. The need for salt in Wareville led the settlers on a journey to Big Bone Lick, where they could gather salt to sustain them.|"[""1.

When Paul and Henry learned about the upcoming expedition, Paul eagerly shared the exciting news with Henry outside the palisade on a beautiful spring day. He described a wondrous place where a hunter spoke of a great salt spring in a marsh surrounded by ancient bones of gigantic creatures. Determined to prove the truth of this remarkable place, Paul convinced Henry to join the journey led by skilled foresters carrying horses laden with supplies and salt. Mr. Silas Pennypacker, a knowledgeable scholar, also joined the group, eager to witness the extraordinary sight of mastodon and mammoth skeletons. As the party set out through the forest, the townspeople bid them farewell, marveling at the vibrant image of the young explorers venturing into the vast wilderness.

Henry walked near the back of the line, with his schoolmaster ahead and his friend Paul behind. He felt grateful for being allowed on this journey. Everything excited him - Paul's story about giant bones, the salt spring, the mysterious woods, and his role in the trusted group. Pride and joy filled his heart as he walked with confidence. The sun rose, casting golden light on the forest. The group stopped at a beautiful glade for a break. They cooked venison, cornbread, and coffee over a small fire. Henry and Paul ate heartily, fueled by the wilderness air. They resumed marching, with Ross leading and Shif'less Sol guarding the rear. The forest was peaceful, with only natural sounds. The group marveled at the beauty of the land as they journeyed through Kentucky. Henry and Paul swam across a river, relishing the wilderness experience.

Henry, a skilled woodsman, joined Ross in the forest for a hunt. With silent precision, he approached a group of grazing deer. Taking aim, he shot one down effortlessly. Ross, impressed by Henry's talent, quickly prepared the game. They returned to camp, where they cooked and ate the fresh deer meat. As night fell, Henry marveled at the beauty of the wilderness under the moon and stars. The next day, they cautiously reached Big Bone Lick, a site filled with ancient bones of mastodons and mammoths. Henry was amazed by the remnants of these creatures from millions of years ago. The schoolmaster explained the origin of the salt springs, linking them to the ancient sea that once covered the land. Henry was fascinated by the natural history surrounding him and felt grateful to be on such an important mission in the depths of the forest.|"['1.

Most salt-makers didn't care about the origins of the giant bones they found, using them as tripods for kettles or as seats. However, the schoolmaster and two boys found the bones fascinating. While the salt-making progressed, wild animals visited for salt. Ross and Shif'less Sol scouted for danger while Henry and Paul worked on reconstructing a prehistoric animal from the bones. As the day ended, the reconstructed figure collapsed, disappointing the schoolmaster. Ross planned to leave for Wareville soon. Henry impressed Ross with his scouting skills, realizing Paul's interests differed. Henry and Ross ventured into the forest, where Ross hinted at a mysterious quest.

The scout's smile widened as he spotted the most talented student he had ever taught. They moved cautiously through the bushes, searching for a wild turkey's trail. Despite the bird's ability to fly without leaving tracks, Henry knew the one they sought was different. As they circled the camp, Ross suddenly halted near a brook, pointing out a footprint. The tracks led them along the water's edge, revealing more joined by a group of warriors. Henry braced himself, realizing the Shawnees, a feared tribe, were close. Ross signaled danger, but Henry, with primal courage, followed silently. Peering through the bushes, he saw the fierce-looking Shawnees around a fire, armed and painted for war. Ross suspected an imminent attack, prompting a swift retreat southward with the precious supplies.|"['1.

"""Yes,"" Henry answered, ""twenty or more of them, and they were an unpleasant group, Paul. I think we could defeat them in a fair fight, even though they outnumber us three to one. They are more familiar with these woods, and there's the issue of salt; we must protect what we came for."" The men checked on the heavily loaded horses, unable to ride unless necessary, and headed south in single file as they had arrived. Henry scanned the surroundings, seeing no imminent danger. It was a lovely afternoon in early spring. The forest shimmered with the fresh green of budding leaves, under a flawless blue sky. The world seemed inviting and harmless, yet Henry couldn't forget the menacing circle of painted faces in the glade. Observing Paul closely, Henry noticed his paleness, but admired his comrade's courage and endurance. After a brief exchange, they lapsed into silence.

After hearing the wise words, Paul stopped asking questions and rode alongside Henry through the night, taking turns on horseback. They crossed streams, ensuring their salt stayed dry.

The leader explained that they had retreated and followed a line all morning, but now they needed to stand and fight. They set up a defense with bags of salt and fallen trees. Two men guarded the horses while the rest waited behind the fortification. The sun shone on the tranquil wilderness, but tension filled the air as the white and red men prepared for battle. Suddenly, a shot rang out, followed by a cry that sent shivers down Henry and Paul's spines. Ross's serious demeanor confirmed the danger.

Henry and Paul observed the approaching storm with fascination. The thunder grew in intensity, followed by flashes of lightning that split the sky. The wind howled, causing the forest to groan. As the hurricane descended upon them, most sought refuge on the ground. Despite hugging the earth, the wind's roar and the crackling of falling trees filled their ears. The storm passed swiftly, leaving a trail of destruction. They quickly loaded the salt onto pack horses and navigated down a steep hillside in the dark and rain, relying on each other for support. Grateful for their safety, they silently trekked through the wilderness, feeling the hand of God had spared them.

Henry and Paul, exhausted and soaked, relished the warmth of the fire, drying their clothes and feeling comfort seep into their bones. Ross suggested they eat, comparing them to Roman fighters.

"""I had a thrilling adventure,"" he shared, ""fighting wild men and feeling like a great Greek hero from Homer's tales. But that's enough for me. I prefer peaceful battles of knowledge over those of war."" They hurried on, and soon shouts from the forest signaled good news. Two men rushed to greet them, relieved to see everyone safe, horses laden with salt. The triumphant procession entered Wareville, where families embraced their returning heroes. Gathered around the fire that evening, Henry recounted their salt-making journey and showdown with the Shawnees.

Henry was thrilled upon hearing about the new expedition, eager to join despite his parents' initial reluctance due to the dangers of the journey to the salt licks. However, Ross intervened persuasively, highlighting Henry's suitability for the task. With the support of Mr. Pennypacker, Henry's favorite, and the need for a scholar on the journey, permission was eventually granted. Excited, Henry and Paul embarked on the adventure, leaving behind fears of Shawnee battles and embracing the summer's lush greenery. They encountered diverse wildlife, including buffalo and elk, in the Barrens, a treeless region teeming with game. Guided by Jim Hart, they ventured towards caves rich in niter, essential for gunpowder production.

Paul and Henry gazed ahead into the dark cave, their torches illuminating a small island of light around them. The cave stretched like a subterranean gallery, carved by ancient hands. As they ventured deeper, they discovered a crypt filled with withered Indian remains laid to rest with bows and arrows. Moving on, they marveled at the grandeur of the cave, with glittering walls and a vaulted dome ceiling adorned with stalactites and stalagmites formed drop by drop over ages.

In the past, the pioneers at Wareville focused on creating gunpowder, but they found contentment in the wonders of the cave and the beauty of the green forest outside. Henry and Ross provided fresh meat, while Paul excelled as a fisherman. Despite their adventures, they found no signs of danger from Indians. The settlers completed the powder-making in peace and returned home triumphantly. Now, the settlers awaited the crucial test of the soil's fertility. They were confident in the land's potential due to its richness and depth. As the wheat shoots sprouted, the schoolmaster predicted a bountiful harvest, estimating a yield of at least twenty-five bushels per acre. Despite the hard work of preparing the ground for planting maize, Henry longed for the freedom of the forest.

Henry observed the lush trees, especially the beeches that grew exceptionally well in this area. He expressed relief that they didn't have to cut down the trees for farming. The prairies were teeming with wildlife, with buffalo, elk, and deer grazing in sight. Paul, the least experienced hunter, successfully hunted a deer, bringing satisfaction to the group.
