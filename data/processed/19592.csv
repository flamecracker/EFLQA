Nicholas Thorne pondered beside his mother, disappointed to learn of her limited means. He had hoped for more, as it affected his future prospects. The image of his mother working diligently to support his education didn't impact him much. Nicholas was selfish, only concerned about his own needs being met. His mother had taken on a job to afford his schooling, but he was indifferent to her sacrifices. Mrs. Thorne, a strong and determined woman, concealed her face with a veil as she walked swiftly.

In a sunny sitting-room on the second floor, Jasper Kent's father sat in a luxurious armchair. He was around fifty years old, but appeared to be a chronic invalid due to health issues from his time in Central America where he had amassed a fortune. Despite his ill health, he spent his days surrounded by books and art, keeping himself occupied with reading and quiet activities. His wife, Mrs. Kent, had been supporting their son Jasper financially and was relieved when her husband suggested that Jasper should stay longer with them.

"""Jasper,"" his father replied firmly, ""we cannot allow that. I am certain she wouldn't want it, and I cannot permit it. I hope you will adjust to the new situation.""

Jasper, a confident boy, laughed at the idea of Mrs. Kent, a woman, being able to harm him. He was more concerned about his father's well-being. Despite knowing his wife married him for security, he didn't dwell on it. Jasper received news from his mother that she had remarried a wealthy man, indicating a change in their relationship. Although he briefly worried his mother might abandon him, he dismissed the thought due to her past affection. During a vacation, Mrs. Kent didn't invite Jasper, possibly due to his stepfather's harsh nature. Despite her polite demeanor, Jasper sensed her detestation.

Jasper's father lay motionless, his face showing signs of tiredness and pain. Tears welled up in Jasper's eyes as he realized his father was passing away. Suddenly, there was a slight movement, then stillness. In that moment, his father had passed on.

She dismissed the idea of poisoning and blamed the new doctor for his father's demise. The funeral passed, with Mrs. Kent displaying false fortitude. Jasper, now aware of his stepmother's deceit, inherited most of his father's estate. Nicholas Thorne, a figure of mixed opinions, arrived unexpectedly, embraced Jasper, and hinted at benefiting from the changed circumstances.|"[""1.

Jasper's face reddened with anger. How could this stranger, Thorne, be favored over him in his own home? Jasper wasn't obsessed with money and would have accepted a cut in his allowance if needed. But losing his rightful place to someone like Thorne was unbearable. Nicholas had successfully managed to upset Jasper. They didn't cross paths until dinner, where Nicholas ate heartily while Jasper looked forlorn. With his mother favoring Nicholas, Jasper felt isolated. His appetite suffered, unlike Nicholas who enjoyed the attention. Jasper stood his ground, refusing to accept the unfair treatment. Mrs. Kent, harboring a dislike for Jasper, now hated him after the incident. She sought revenge, plotting to use a hired man, Tom Forbes, to humiliate Jasper. Despite Nicholas' defeat, he was willing to move on, unlike his mother, who was bent on making Jasper pay.|"[""1.

During breakfast, Mrs. Kent maintained a chilly silence towards Jasper, only speaking when necessary. Nicholas, sensing tension, occasionally smiled at Jasper across the table but remained quiet.
