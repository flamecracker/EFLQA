Mr. George spoke to Rollo while they were at the railway station. Rollo was standing on the step of the car, looking in at the window towards his uncle. The conversation was interrupted by the bell signaling the train's departure. Rollo ran back to his second-class car, two cars behind Mr. George. As the train started moving, Rollo pondered on the double-headed nature of London, consisting of two distinct cities, the ancient London and Westminster. Westminster derived its name from the cathedral church built there. Over time, Westminster became a famous town with palaces and public buildings. London also grew as a hub for merchants and artisans. Eventually, the two cities merged with surrounding villages, forming one vast metropolis. Despite this, the City and the West End remain distinct, each excelling in commerce and political power, respectively. Mr. George elaborated on this as they left the London Bridge station.|"['1.

When the train arrived at London Bridge station, passengers exited their compartments onto the platform. In English trains, the doors are on the sides, unlike in America where they are at the ends. This causes passengers to disembark almost simultaneously, quickly crowding the platform. Across the platform, there is typically a line of cabs and carriages waiting to transport passengers from the train cars. Baggage is conveniently placed on the same car as the passenger, making it easy for railway porters to transfer it to awaiting cabs. These porters, dressed in distinct uniforms, are numerous and courteous, especially to first-class passengers and those accompanying pleasant-looking ladies. While not allowed to accept tips, they sometimes discreetly receive shillings or sixpences, particularly from American travelers unfamiliar with the customs. Upon arrival, Mr. George and Rollo discussed saving money by traveling second class and the importance of managing luggage efficiently. They then proceeded to explore the bustling commercial capital of London, with its impressive docks, warehouses, banks, and historic landmarks like St. Paul's Cathedral and the Mansion House.|"['1.

Mr. George and Rollo approached London Bridge, crossing it to the Surrey side. From there, they glimpsed the grandeur of London, with its landmarks like the Houses of Parliament, the Horse Guards, and the Admiralty. The bridge itself was a massive stone structure with bustling traffic on both sides and pedestrians crowding the sidewalks. They paused to observe the river below, where a steamboat navigated the strong current. Mr. George explained that the tide flowed in from the sea, pointing out the vast array of ships lining the riverbanks. As they looked upstream, they noticed the absence of ships above the bridge due to navigational restrictions. The river was a busy thoroughfare with boats and steamers crisscrossing the waterways, creating a vibrant scene of activity.|['1.

Mr. George explained to Rollo that ships couldn't pass above the bridge due to the long masts. He also mentioned how a drawbridge wouldn't work with the constant flow of foot passengers and carriages. They observed a steamboat landing on the London side of the river with a list of cargo manifest for customs duties. Mr. George pointed out a large building resembling a fortress, known as the Tower, originally built for defense. The Tower is now used to store treasures and state prisoners. The Tower was strategically placed below the city to intercept enemy ships coming up the river. However, as the city expanded, the Tower is now surrounded by streets and warehouses and serves a different purpose.|"[""1.

Rollo noticed a tapping noise on the sidewalk. It was a blind man with a stick that had an iron tip, making a sharp sound as he walked. The noise warned others of his presence. Despite the crowded sidewalk, people made way for him. Mr. George explained the failed attempt of a bridge that few used. They crossed the bridge, observing steamers on the river below. The steamers were busy with passengers embarking and disembarking from a floating platform. The scene was chaotic with boats moving in all directions. The steamers emitted black smoke, creating a murky atmosphere. They descended a stone staircase to a street below the bridge, passing under a dry arch to reach the floating platforms, where they paid the fare.|"[""1.

Mr. George and Rollo were on an adventure to find the right boat to Westminster. They decided to ask an orange seller for guidance. The woman gladly helped them after they bought oranges from her. Rollo shared that the schools they saw were for poor boys and were started by a cobbler. They boarded a small boat, joining other passengers. As they sailed along the river, Rollo was fascinated by the sights of warehouses, bridges, and steamers. He was amused by the gestures of the pilot and the engineer on the boat. The boat cleverly passed under a low bridge by folding back its smokepipe. The passengers embarked and disembarked at various stops, witnessing the unique operations of the boat.|"['1.

Mr. George decided to inquire about the best location for their stay in London. He preferred the West End for its interesting everyday walks and street sights. As they approached Hungerford Bridge on a steamboat, Rollo noticed its unique iron suspension construction supported by massive chains. The Westminster Bridge followed, appearing more grand with its architectural front. Mr. George consulted a guidebook to identify Whitehall, a street with historical significance related to King Charles's execution. They encountered a well-dressed policeman who provided them with helpful information about the area. Rollo admired the policeman's uniform, noting the dark blue suit and the distinctive hat. The policeman answered their questions politely and with a gentlemanly demeanor.|"['1.

"In London, there are about six thousand young and active policemen assigned to different districts called ""beats."" Each policeman walks in his beat to maintain order, help lost children, assist strangers, and answer questions about the city. They have authority but use it gently. Rollo saw a policeman taking a young prisoner to the station. Despite wanting to follow, his uncle advised against it. Rollo felt sorry for the boy and asked an orange vendor about the incident, learning the boy's offense. A few days later, Rollo got lost on his way back from the British Museum. With no money for a cab, he sought help from a policeman, who guided him back to his lodgings."|"['Question 1: What is the primary responsibility of the policemen in London?\nA) Selling oranges\nB) Guiding lost children\nC) Driving cabs\nD) Assisting strangers\nE) Running errands', 'Question 2: How do the policemen in London typically use their authority?\nA) Harshly\nB) Inactively\nC) Gently\nD) Aggressively\nE) Secretly', ""Question 3: Why did Rollo's uncle advise against following the policeman taking the young prisoner to the station?\nA) The uncle was the young prisoner's lawyer\nB) It was getting late\nC) Rollo needed to buy oranges\nD) Rollo's uncle was a policeman too\nE) The uncle didn't want Rollo to get into trouble"", ""Question 4: What did Rollo learn about the young boy's offense from the orange vendor?\nA) He stole an orange\nB) He lost his way\nC) He was buying a ticket\nD) He was asking for directions\nE) He was helping a stranger"", 'Question 5: How did Rollo manage to find his way back to his lodgings when he got lost?\nA) He called a cab\nB) He asked the orange vendor for help\nC) He followed a stranger\nD) He used a map\nE) He sought help from a policeman', 'Question 6: What does the passage suggest about the relationship between Rollo and the policemen in London?\nA) Rollo dislikes all policemen\nB) Rollo is afraid of policemen\nC) Rollo trusts and seeks help from policemen\nD) Rollo is a policeman himself\nE) Rollo ignores policemen']"|"['B) Guiding lost children', 'C) Gently', ""E) The uncle didn't want Rollo to get into trouble"", 'A) He stole an orange', 'E) He sought help from a policeman', 'C) Rollo trusts and seeks help from policemen']"
Rollo walked with the second policeman, who was very interested to learn that Rollo was American. They chatted about New York and Boston. The policeman mentioned having a brother in Boston and another in Cincinnati. As they walked, Rollo shared stories about America and his adventures in London. At the end of the second policeman's route, Rollo was handed over to a third policeman. This continued until Rollo spotted Charing Cross with the tall Nelson monument. Realizing his location, Rollo thanked the policeman and continued home alone. The passage highlighted how policemen are helpful to strangers, always ready to assist. They carry specific tools like batons, rattles, lanterns, and oilskin capes for different situations. Policemen are seen as friends to travelers, providing aid and guidance when needed.|['1.

"In London, there are many lodging houses scattered around the city. They can be found on side streets branching off from main roads, with signs saying ""FURNISHED APARTMENTS"" displayed in their windows. Mr. George and Rollo found a place to stay in Northumberland Court, which was once part of the estate of the famous dukes of Northumberland. The area used to be filled with grand mansions built by English nobles along the Thames. Now, the space is filled with streets and alleys named after these noble families. The lodging Mr. George and Rollo found had a dark but cozy sitting room with a sofa, armchairs, and tables. The bedrooms were well-equipped, and they decided to rent the rooms for twenty-seven shillings a week. The landlady welcomed them and Mr. George handed over his card to finalize the agreement."|"['1.

"The landlady explained to Mr. George that sometimes guests book rooms but can't come, causing inconvenience. Mr. George paid in advance and left to return with Rollo later. They rode a cab to the railway station and back to their London lodgings. On a Sunday morning, Mr. George wrote a letter while Rollo watched outside. Margaret brought breakfast, but there was confusion over the coffee cups. After breakfast, Mr. George planned to visit Westminster Abbey and St. Paul's.

Mr. George and Rollo walked into the church through the south transept, one of the arms of the cross-shaped cathedral. The main part of the church, called the nave, extends east to west. The chancel is at the head of the cross, while the north and south transepts are its arms. The space where the cross intersects is known as the choir, where congregations gather for service. The choir is separated from the rest of the church by ornate partitions called screens. These screens rise high above the floor, often reaching over 20 to 30 feet. The abbey also features stained glass windows, intricate carvings, and sculptures. Mr. George and Rollo were in the Poet's Corner, surrounded by towering columns that reached the ceiling. The church's layout includes aisles, separated by columns, and higher roofs over the nave and choir compared to the aisles.|"['1.

Rollo and Mr. George made their way up the passage until they found a bench with a vacant spot. They sat down to listen to the deep tones of the immense organ above the screen separating the nave from the choir. The seats in front were full, and a lady, along with a gentleman, joined them at the bench. The lady, unsatisfied, sought a seat closer to the choir. Eventually, she found a spot with some ladies and settled in, leaving her husband standing beside her. The service, conducted by clergymen in white robes, seemed complex to Mr. George and Rollo. The scene felt more like a dramatic spectacle than a religious service. After the service, the congregation moved towards the choir, admiring the monuments, statues, carvings, and stained-glass windows before exiting through the gateway marked on the plan.|['1.

Rollo and Mr. George explored the church, fascinated by the ancient monuments and inscriptions. The cold, damp atmosphere gave the church a tomb-like feel. The sculptures depicted men in various activities, from studying to sea battles. They also visited the chapels, small recesses adorned with monuments and used for religious services. Each chapel had unique decorations and significance, with one chapel housing the tombs of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth. The central chapel, where many ancient English kings were buried, stood out as the most intriguing. Mr. George decided to skip St. Paul's that day, finding the service at a small chapel more spiritually fulfilling. He compared it to Jesus' meeting with his disciples, emphasizing the importance of seeking forgiveness and salvation.|"['1.

"""Today, Mr. George and Rollo decided to visit St. Paul's Cathedral in the city. They debated on how to get there, whether by a steamer for sixpence, an omnibus for eightpence, or a cab for a shilling. Eventually, they chose a cab and rode towards the city. Passing by the old Temple Bar gateway, Mr. George stopped at an office, leaving Rollo to explore the area. While in the cab, a woman approached, offering violets for sale, but Rollo declined.

Mr. George calculated the cost of a chain for Rollo, factoring in wear and tear. He advised Rollo that the chain would gradually deteriorate and lose value over time. Mr. George explained that investing in items subject to depreciation could result in financial loss, unlike investments that generate interest. Rollo's uncle emphasized the importance of considering long-term value and enjoyment when making purchases. Although Rollo had the freedom to spend his money as he pleased, his uncle's guidance helped him make informed decisions. Rollo decided to delay purchasing the chain to explore other options.

In London, some of the grandest shops are found on a street known as the String. This street, part of St. Paul's Churchyard, boasts a variety of shops selling books, millinery, laces, embroideries, caps, bonnets, silver plate, and jewelry. Despite the street's name, it's common to find such luxurious items there. Rollo and his family meet at St. Paul's Churchyard, where they decide to explore St. Paul's Cathedral. Inside, they are awestruck by its vastness, height, and intricate paintings on the dome.

At the top of the stairs, a woman oversaw the clock room. She guided the group to see the massive clock wheels and three bells: two small bells, actually large, and one monstrous large bell. The clock's pendulum is fourteen feet long with a weight of over a hundred pounds. The minute hand is eight feet long and weighs seventy-five pounds. The small bells chime quarter hours, while the great bell strikes hours and tolls for royal family deaths. Descending through a dark stairway, they reached the corridor to visit the dome and cupola, more captivating parts of the church.

Rollo and his cousin Jennie were captivated by the sight of workmen repainting the dome's inner surface. They watched in awe as the men balanced on ropes and pulleys high above. Imagining the chaos if the ropes were to break, they felt a sense of wonder and fear. As they explored further, they climbed intricate staircases to the stone gallery outside the church. From there, they marveled at the view of the city below, with tiny figures moving about like mites. Mr. George then led them through a door back into the church, where they were surrounded by a maze of beams and structures, shrouded in darkness. The space between the inner and outer dome revealed a complex system supporting the wooden outer dome.

Mrs. Holiday hesitated between Rollo's eagerness and Jennie's apprehension. Mr. George assured her of the safety of the public stairs, emphasizing the authorities' precautions. He was concerned about Mrs. Holiday's fear, even if there was no real danger. As they climbed, Mrs. Holiday's fears lessened, encouraged by Mr. George. They reached a high outside gallery called the golden gallery, but the height made them dizzy. They saw young men heading to the cupola with a guide. Mrs. Holiday didn't want to hinder Mr. George's ascent but was too scared to go higher. Mr. George pointed out the undesirable reputation of boasting about risky feats.

In the past, a prince named William from Normandy in France conquered England and became known as William the Conqueror. He distributed land and power among his followers, creating an aristocracy that still governs England today. This aristocracy, made up of descendants of the conquerors, controls the government, the military, the church, and the economy. While some new nobles have been appointed over time, they are not regarded as highly as the old families. Despite this, England has enjoyed peace and order under this system. However, there are concerns about the distribution of wealth and the disparity in earnings among the working population. The total annual production in England is estimated to be more than three thousand million dollars, showing the vast economic output of the country.|['1.

In England, the aristocracy receives a large portion of the value produced by the labor of the working class, leaving them with little for themselves. This results in the working class living in meager conditions, while the aristocrats enjoy luxury. Contrary to England, in the United States, those who work the land have comfortable homes and can afford the luxuries of life. This difference is attributed to the laws and institutions shaped by the aristocracy in England, which favor them, whereas in America, the laws are shaped by the masses, giving workers a larger share of the proceeds of their labor. This allows them to enjoy a better quality of life, educate their children, and have comfortable homes.|['1.

Clubhouses, grand mansions owned by groups of gentlemen known as clubs, are lavishly equipped with reading rooms, libraries, dining areas, and spaces for various games. These facilities cater to over a thousand members and demand annual expenses ranging from $30,000 to $50,000. On a particular evening, Mr. George and Rollo ventured into the bustling streets of Trafalgar Square, teeming with excitement and bright lights. The crowd pushed towards the west, where the splendid clubhouses and palaces stood illuminated. Amidst the glow, Rollo felt a jostle and realized his wallet was missing.

He explained that wisdom outweighs gold, quoting Solomon. Mr. George praised Rollo for being careful with his belongings, stating excessive care is unnecessary. He likened travelers to merchants who factor in losses in their plans, usually around five percent. Mr. George advised including loss allowances in travel plans, treating them as routine expenses.

"Mr. George remarked, ""London pickpockets are remarkably skilled, often working in groups to create a distraction and swiftly steal from unsuspecting victims.

Rollo was eager to see the bustling activities at the docks, while Mr. George was fascinated by the docks' construction. Building the docks was a massive task with many challenges. The chosen location needed to be low near the river, requiring the demolition of existing houses. To prevent river water from flooding the worksite, a coffer dam was built. The first set of docks, the West India Docks, was constructed in 1800, followed by others. The docks were enclosed by thick walls and accessed through large gateways. The docks were surrounded by streets and houses, making them hard to spot from a distance. Rollo and Mr. George rode through London's crowded streets to reach the docks, where they marveled at the forest of masts, ships, and bustling activity of loading and unloading goods.|"['1.

After the extensive excavations were completed, Mr. George explained the meticulous process of constructing the docks. They started at the base, laying robust foundations and erecting thick walls along the basin's edges. Streets, quays, sheds, and warehouses were then built. To facilitate movement, drawbridges were essential for people living nearby. Warping, a technique using ropes to maneuver ships, was crucial for loading and unloading. Ships could be drawn short distances using lines attached to posts or anchors. Rollo learned how ships could be warped even in the open sea using floats that create resistance in the water. This method allows ships to be pulled towards them. Rollo was intrigued by the complexity of ship maneuvering and the various techniques employed to navigate vessels efficiently.|['1.

Mr. George explained that sailors use a special method to move a ship during calm seas or to escape from an iceberg. As they walked along the dock, they noticed a large ship with many passengers, mostly emigrants from France and Germany. Mr. George led Rollo onto the ship, where they saw people in unique clothing preparing for the voyage. Among them was an elderly woman with a peculiar book and a child playing with a worn wagon. Rollo tried to communicate with the child, but she didn't understand English. However, her mother, a friendly woman, explained that the child didn't speak English. The scene provided Rollo with a glimpse of the emigrants boarding the ship at the start of their journey.|"['1.

During a storm, emigrant ships face various hardships. Although the ships are sturdy and designed to withstand harsh weather, if caught in a storm near rocks or a coast, the situation becomes perilous. Waves can drive the ship onto rocks or sands, endangering the passengers. If the ship hits the shore, it may capsize, leading to passengers drowning or being washed overboard. Some attempt to secure themselves to the ship's structure to avoid being swept away. Rescues are often carried out by boats from the shore after the storm subsides. Despite these dangers, many emigrants brave the Atlantic for a chance at a better life in the new world. Ships like the ones in the London Docks arrive in New York regularly, with only a small fraction facing disasters at sea.|"[""1.

Suppose a person wants to buy goods for a cargo, like a man preparing to ship elephants' tusks from Africa. He needs a variety of items in large quantities to trade with the natives. The man lists the goods he needs and their quantities, then gives it to an agent. This agent, familiar with docks and brokers, procures the items and sends them to the ship bound for Africa. Upon delivery, the ship's captain gives the agent receipts, which are then sent to the merchant. This process makes the business easy and efficient for the merchant, requiring only a small office and clerks. Mr. George and Rollo discussed this as they observed the bustling docks and even toured the Tower of London, a historic fortress turned into a tourist attraction.|"[""1.

The armor displayed in the hall varied in style from one monarch to another, showing how military fashion evolved through the centuries. Some suits were made for English princes when they were children, sparking Rollo's imagination of wearing one.
