Thanks to the publishers of various magazines for allowing us to share stories. In my Brazilian garden at late afternoon, the sky transforms from dazzling blue to roseate hues for the sunset. A lizard climbs the wall lazily, while the song of the Sabiá thrush fills the air. The scent of orange blossoms lingers. Night falls swiftly in the tropics. Theresa, our storyteller, stands under the mango trees, ready to enchant us with tales. Her attire, adorned with lace and beads, adds to her royal presence. She narrates stories of a time when there was no night, only eternal day. The daughter of the Great Sea Serpent longed for the shadows of night, bringing a desire for darkness to the land of daylight.|"['1.

"The daughter of the GREAT SEA SERPENT explained that ""Night"" was the term for the dark shadows in her father's underwater realm. She longed for some darkness in the bright world above. Her husband decided to send three loyal slaves to request a portion of the night from the GREAT SEA SERPENT. The slaves journeyed through dangers to reach the sea serpent's kingdom. The sea serpent granted them a bag filled with the sounds and creatures of the night. Overwhelmed by fear, the slaves opened the bag prematurely, releasing darkness and the night chorus. The daughter eagerly awaited their return, and upon seeing the night approaching, she fell asleep under a palm tree.

Long ago, a wise woman in Brazil commanded the birds to sing their sweetest songs at dawn. The cock was appointed the night watchman, marking the watches of the night with his voice. To this day, the early morning is called the _madrugada_, with the cock heralding its arrival to the waiting birds. The morning star shines as the queen of the _madrugada_. In another tale, a rabbit lost its long tail to a crafty cat. Instead of being upset, the rabbit generously traded the tail for a sharp knife. The rabbit then exchanged the broken knife for a basket with a little old man. Despite losing its tail, the rabbit remained optimistic, knowing there was always something good to gain.|['**1.

Once upon a time, Mr. Rabbit journeyed through the deep forest until he reached a clearing where an old woman was gathering lettuce. She kindly shared some with him. As he enjoyed the lettuce, Mr. Rabbit reflected on his losses and gains - losing his tail but gaining a knife, then losing the knife but gaining a basket, and finally losing the basket but gaining the delicious lettuce. Despite losing his tail, Mr. Rabbit found joy in the lettuce, declaring it the best thing he had ever tasted. From that day on, no rabbit has had a tail, yet they all happily enjoy lettuce. Nearby, a toad was known for attending parties far and wide, much to the dislike of a big black buzzard.

A long time ago, when animals spoke and tigers owned farms, a tiger needed help clearing his overgrown land. He offered an ox as payment to the beast who could do the job. The monkey, goat, and armadillo failed to meet the tiger's expectations. Finally, a small rabbit stepped up. Despite doubts about his size, the rabbit worked diligently, impressing the tiger with his dedication. The tiger left on a hunting trip, leaving his son to watch over the rabbit. The toad, waiting inside a violin at a party, wished he hadn't come as he waited for a ride home.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a rabbit made a clever plan to outsmart a tiger and get an ox. The rabbit worked hard to clear the farm, but when the tiger returned, he noticed the rabbit's incomplete work. The tiger stayed to watch the rabbit finish and then gave him the ox as promised. As the rabbit journeyed with the ox, he thought to kill it twice but stopped each time, fearing mosquitoes and flies. Finally, when he found a peaceful spot with no insects, he decided to eat the ox. However, the hungry tiger appeared and begged for a piece. The rabbit, afraid of the tiger, shared the ox, but the tiger ate it all, leaving the rabbit with only a tiny bit. The tiger then asked the rabbit to build a stockade for him, but the rabbit was angry and refused.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a clever rabbit trapped a fierce tiger using long sticks. The tiger, trapped inside the enclosure, tried to break free by jumping with all its might but failed. The tiger rested and thought about the sunny jungle outside, the cool water, and the good hunting. With renewed determination, the tiger finally broke through the enclosure but not without getting hurt. To this day, the tiger bears scars from the escape.

The toad gathered all his relatives before the race, instructing them to respond to the lamb's call. Surprisingly, the toad's brother tricked the lamb by mimicking the toad's response.

"Once upon a time, a lamb and a toad approached the king's palace. The king's daughter spotted them from the window. The toad, riding on the lamb's back, pretended the lamb was a horse by waving a stick and urging it on. The princess chuckled, and soon everyone in the palace joined in laughter. The lamb obediently returned to its pasture. From then on, people used the phrase ""as meek as a lamb"" to describe someone gentle. In another land, a stag and a tiger both decided to build houses.

At dawn, the deer returned to his house construction. Upon seeing it, he couldn't believe his eyes and thought he was dreaming. The sides were done, a door, and a small window. He suspected someone was helping him. Working hard, he finished the roof by sunset. Excited to sleep in his new house, he made a bed and dozed off. The next day, he informed the tiger he was going hunting and asked for wood and water upon his return. When he came back with a tiger's body, the tiger and deer couldn't sleep, fearing each other. In the night, a noise startled them, causing a chaotic escape. Both ran far away, never returning. The house, tired of waiting, eventually collapsed.|"[""1.

The little white hen nervously approached the royal palace, clutching a letter for the king in her little brown basket. Despite her fear of the great royal doorkeeper, she managed to present the letter to the king, which was dirty and damp from its journey.

"Once upon a time in a beautiful garden, beasts roamed freely and were allowed to eat the fruits as long as they followed one rule. They had to bow politely to the fruit tree, call it by its name, and say, ""Please give me a taste of your fruit."" It was crucial not to be greedy and leave enough fruit for others and for the tree to grow more. The beasts often forgot the names of the trees, except for the most splendid tree that no one had tasted.

Once upon a time, a monkey remembered a tree with a long, hard name and a little tune he sang. He never forgot the taste of the fruit. He didn't eat it again but enjoyed tricking other animals by sharing it with them. One day, a tiger invited a goat on a journey. They encountered a marsh, and the tiger pretended to be brave, urging the goat to go first. The goat bravely entered but got stuck in the mud. The tiger took a different path. Later, they found banana trees, and the tiger asked the goat to pick bananas. The goat gave the ripe ones to the tiger, leaving himself hungry. Further along, they found a cobra, and the tiger tricked the goat into thinking it was a gift for his daughter.

Once upon a time, a mischievous monkey encountered a wax figure that resembled a boy selling bananas. The monkey, known for causing trouble, attempted to ask politely for a banana but received no response from the silent wax figure. Frustrated, the monkey threatened the wax figure, but still, there was no reply. The monkey's loud cries attracted other monkeys, and together, they devised a plan. They formed a pyramid to reach the sun, hoping its rays would melt the wax. Eventually, the sun's heat freed the monkey, leaving the old woman who owned the garden to switch from growing bananas to cabbages. Since then, monkeys have believed they own all the bananas, a tale from a time when people transitioned from fruits to meat as food sources became scarce.|"['1.
