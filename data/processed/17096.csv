Mr. Brown decided to let Tom stay with them in the woods camp and offered him a job at the boat-dock when they return home. Meanwhile, Bunny and Sue played in their green tent made of tree branches. While Sue dressed her dolls, Bunny played with his toys. Hearing Tom's call from the boat, Bunny shouted back, but they realized Tom was stranded without oars. Tom had accidentally floated away in the boat, carried by the wind. He tried to use a stick to push the boat to shore but couldn't reach the lake bottom. Tom, unable to swim, asked Bunny for help. Bunny and Sue were unsure how to rescue Tom without oars.|"['Question 1: What job did Mr. Brown offer Tom?\nA) Fishing\nB) Boat-dock\nC) Hunting\nD) Cooking\nE) Gardening', 'Question 2: Where did Bunny and Sue play?\nA) Beach\nB) Park\nC) Woods\nD) Green tent\nE) School', 'Question 3: What was Bunny playing with?\nA) Dolls\nB) Sticks\nC) Toys\nD) Rocks\nE) Leaves', 'Question 4: How did Tom end up stranded in the boat?\nA) He fell asleep\nB) Bunny pushed him\nC) Wind carried him away\nD) He was swimming\nE) He went fishing', 'Question 5: What did Tom use to try to push the boat to shore?\nA) Stick\nB) Oars\nC) Doll\nD) Rock\nE) Fishing net', ""Question 6: Why were Bunny and Sue unsure how to rescue Tom?\nA) They were too far\nB) They didn't like Tom\nC) Tom was too heavy\nD) Tom could swim\nE) Tom had no oars""]"|['B) Boat-dock', 'D) Green tent', 'C) Toys', 'C) Wind carried him away', 'A) Stick', 'E) Tom had no oars']
Bunny and Sue found themselves in a pickle by the lake. Bunny was worried about not being able to row the boat back without the oars. They called out for help, but no one heard them as the adults were out for a walk. Suddenly, their dog Splash appeared and, with the help of Tom, they managed to bring the boat back to shore. Tom was advised never to go out alone in the boat again. Days at Camp Rest-a-While were filled with joy, picnics, and fishing trips. One day, while returning from a farmhouse, Tom spotted a man and hurried the kids into hiding. Tom's fear piqued Bunny and Sue's curiosity about the mysterious man approaching.|"['1.

Bunny and Sue, along with Tom, hid among the bushes like scared rabbits. Tom, though afraid, comforted them. Sue asked for a piggyback ride, and Tom obliged, carrying her while she clutched her doll. Leading the way, Tom guided them safely to the tent where their parents were. A few days later, a man with black whiskers and a whip arrived, looking for a boy. Tom, recognizing the man, spilled water in shock. The man claimed the boy was his worker, but Mr. Brown refused to let him take the boy, as he had been mistreated. The man left, threatening Tom.

The farmer in the city was unkind to the narrator, prompting them to flee. Later, they spotted the farmer in the woods, causing the narrator to hide.

The children speculated about the sticks, with the girl guessing they were for croquet mallets. The boy thought they might be for trapping animals, but Bunker revealed it was a secret project.

Mother Brown expressed her confidence that Tom would return in the morning, pointing out that the warm weather made sleeping outdoors comfortable.
