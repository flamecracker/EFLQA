Max always admires the animal when it is mentioned; and I must acknowledge that things have turned out well in the end. But the distress Ismay and I endured because of that detestable cat is not something I consider a blessing. Personally, I never cared for cats, although I understand their value. I can manage fine with a practical old tabby that can fend for itself. Ismay despises cats, and always has. However, Aunt Cynthia, who adored them, could not comprehend how anyone could dislike them. She believed we secretly liked cats but refused to admit it due to some moral flaw. Of all cats, I detested Aunt Cynthia's white Persian cat the most. It was a pampered creature that Aunt Cynthia valued more for its pedigree and worth than genuine affection. Despite our dislike, we kept our opinions to ourselves to avoid upsetting Aunt Cynthia, whom we genuinely cared for. Aunt Cynthia had a knack for being annoying and critical, but she could also be unexpectedly kind. One November day, Aunt Cynthia arrived in Spencervale, exuding an air of grandeur akin to a majestic ship sailing smoothly. Unfortunately, it was a day filled with mishaps. Ismay had ruined her velvet coat, my new blouse was a disaster, the kitchen was smoky, and the bread was sour. To add to the chaos, our dependable nurse Huldah Jane was suffering from a shoulder ailment, making everyone uncomfortable. Aunt Cynthia, with her sharp nose,|"[""1.

Aunt Cynthia, in a somewhat irritating manner, expressed her doubts about women truly believing they do not need a man. She mentioned how Anne Shirley and Dr. Irving seemed content during their walk. Aunt Cynthia then revealed her plan to go to Halifax for two months and requested that Sue take care of her cat, Fatima, during her absence. Sue and Ismay knew they had no choice but to agree to avoid offending Aunt Cynthia. Aunt Cynthia emphasized the importance of ensuring Fatima's safety while she was away. Sue, feeling indifferent towards Max, rejected his proposal once again. However, she appreciated Max's presence and helpfulness in their lives. Max, who had been proposing to Sue for years, continued to be a reliable and supportive figure in their household.|"[""1.

"Max thoughtfully remarked, ""That makes it eleven. Nearly at my limit, right? I can't propose to the same girl more than twelve times. So, the next time will be the last, Sue darling."" I replied flatly, feeling a bit indifferent. I pondered if things would be dull without Max's proposals, my only excitement. However, it was inevitable. Max visited daily, offering advice. Three weeks after Aunt Cynthia left, Fatima vanished mysteriously. Despite extensive searches, she remained missing. Amid the distress, Max's support was invaluable. We refrained from advertising, fearing Aunt Cynthia's notice. Instead, we searched and inquired widely for a white Persian cat with a blue tail spot. As hope waned, Max suggested placing an ad for a similar cat to deceive Aunt Cynthia."|"['1.

"""We need to use the money we saved for the new furs,"" I sadly mentioned. ""There's no other option. Losing Aunt Cynthia's favor could cost us even more. She might think we got rid of Fatima on purpose."" So, we put out an ad. Max went to town and placed it in the main newspaper. We asked anyone with a white Persian cat with a blue spot on its tail to contact M. I. through the _Enterprise_. We didn't expect much, but we were thrilled to receive a letter from Halifax four days later. It described a white Persian cat for sale matching our description. The price was $110, and it could be seen at 110 Hollis Street under the name ""Persian."" ""Don't get too excited,"" Ismay cautioned. ""The cat might not be a perfect match. But Max, you have to go check. If it looks like Fatima, buy it and take it to Aunt Cynthia. Will you do it?"" Max hesitated, ""It's risky, but if you agree to marry me, I'll do it to help you out of this mess."""|"['1.

Max behaved terribly, but deep down, I knew life would be dull without him. I felt a strong connection with him, especially with Anne Shirley around. After Max's trip to Halifax, Aunt Cynthia mentioned selling Fatima the cat. Coincidentally, I had placed an ad for a Persian cat for Sue and Ismay. Aunt Cynthia happily sold Fatima to us, and now we jointly own her. Aunt Cynthia won't be back for a month, so we can say Fatima got lost without mentioning when. Max, a dear friend, left but quickly returned, showing surprise at something he saw.|"[""1.

"""The place is full of mice,"" Max stated. ""No doubt the cat has been here the whole time. She must have followed Huldah Jane up here that day. It's surprising you didn't hear her cry. But maybe she didn't, and you sleep downstairs. To think you never thought to look here for her!"" It never bothered me that I wasn't married, though everyone pitied old maids in Avonlea. What did bother me was never having had the chance. Even Nancy, my old nurse, knew that. She pitied me for it, although she had two proposals. If anyone teased Nancy about being single, she could point to those two. I often wondered why nobody fell in love with me. I wasn't unattractive; George Adoniram Maybrick even wrote a poem about my beauty. But it wasn't my looks that kept me single. It wasn't my poetry either, as no one knew about it. I wrote it secretly in a little book. I've been writing poetry all my life. It's the only thing I've kept from Nancy. Despite this, with my flowers, cats, magazines, and secret book, I was content. Adella Gilbert pitied me for never being wanted, which stung. The Sewing Circle met at Mary Gillespie's on my fortieth birthday. Nancy, who still celebrates my birthdays, brought me breakfast in bed.

In the afternoon, I attended the Sewing Circle, a gathering where people sew and chat. As I glanced in the mirror, I pondered if I truly looked my age of forty. My brown wavy hair and rosy cheeks made me doubt it. The Sewing Circle was bustling with attendees of all ages, but I didn't particularly enjoy it. The married women chatted about their families, the young girls whispered about their crushes, and the older ladies gossiped. Feeling out of place, I smiled to myself, lost in thoughts about roses. Suddenly, I found myself caught in a moment of truth and deceit when Wilhelmina asked if I had a secret beau. Unable to bear the humiliation, I fibbed, causing a stir in the room. Despite being a truthful person, the weight of societal expectations pushed me to make a false claim that intrigued Wilhelmina.|['1.

"Josephine's words spurred me on. Seeing Mary and Adella exchange knowing glances sealed my resolve. ""In for a penny, in for a pound,"" I thought as I confidently uttered, ""Cecil Fenwick."" The name had always held a special place in my heart. Remembering a newspaper ad for ""Fenwick's Porous Plasters,"" I linked the two names in a whimsical marriage. Recalling my past, I remembered visiting an aunt in New Brunswick at eighteen, the only time I had ventured far from Avonlea. Embellishing a tale of a passionate quarrel with Cecil, I relished the newfound respect in the girls' eyes. As tea was called, I was relieved, my imagination waning. Yet, a sense of triumph lingered, and I reveled in my newfound romantic past, unapologetically embracing the fiction I had spun."|"['1.

For the next two months, everything went smoothly and happily. Although nobody mentioned Cecil Fenwick again, the girls openly shared their romantic stories with me, making me their trusted confidant. I felt so content and truly enjoyed the Sewing Circle gatherings. I received lovely new dresses and a charming hat, and I happily attended all the events I was invited to. However, it is certain that wrong actions lead to consequences. After two months, my punishment caught up with me, and I was devastated. A new family, the Maxwells, had arrived in Avonlea. They were a wealthy middle-aged couple, with Mr. Maxwell owning the lumber mills. One Sewing Circle day at Sarah Gardiner's, upon my late arrival, I sensed something was amiss. The others looked at me strangely, and Wilhelmina Mercer was the first to speak up. She revealed that Cecil Fenwick, a lawyer from Blakely, New Brunswick, who had been out West for twenty-two years and had never married, still remembered me. Despite the hopeful words, I felt overwhelmed by the unexpected news. The afternoon was a nightmare, and I rushed home feeling lost and confused.|"['1.

I faced the truth head-on. Cecil Fenwick, an unexpected presence in Avonlea, was believed by all to be my lost love. Fear gripped me, fearing he would uncover the story and shame me or simply leave, leading to pity. Praying he'd depart, fate had other plans. Despite invitations to events in his honor, I avoided them all. Wilhelmina urged me to reconcile, but I withdrew from society, even skipping church. Fretting, losing appetite, and avoiding writing, I felt punished for a lie. Nancy's pills couldn't heal my deep sorrow. Seeing Fenwick's name in the paper intensified my distress.

Rachel, a woman of forty, found herself blushing like a young girl. Despite feeling youthful, she realized the relief of having an explanation.

Miss Rosetta, with her hair still in curl-papers, rushed up the hill and down the shore road to the Wheeler Farm, a place she had never visited. The little gray house by the waves looked deserted. She pounded on the door, then tried the back door, but it was locked. Peering through the kitchen window, she saw Charlotte with Camilla Jane, dressed in new clothes. Enraged, Miss Rosetta demanded the baby back, accusing Charlotte of stealing. Charlotte, unfazed, played with the baby.

I mourned my son's passing deeply, like any father would. But my wife, Josephine, grieved differently. Time didn't ease her pain; she withered away. I hoped spring would revive her. When nature bloomed, she dreamed of our lost child, haunting her day and night. One moonlit night, I awoke to find her missing. Alone, I heard only the ocean's distant hum. She returned, tears staining her face, hair disheveled. She had followed our son's cries on the shore but couldn't reach him. Exhausted, she wept, longing for him to know she tried.

"""It was no dream,"" she answered reproachfully, ""I tell you I heard him calling me--me, his mother. What could I do but go to him? You cannot understand--you are only his father. It was not you who gave him birth. It was not you who paid the price of his dear life in pain. He would not call to you--he wanted his mother.""

I escorted her back to the house and her bed, where she obediently lay down, falling quickly into an exhausted sleep. However, sleep eluded me that night. I kept a watchful eye with apprehension.

Upon marrying Josephine, I was informed by a relative that her grandmother had suffered from insanity in her later years. She had been driven mad by grief over the loss of a beloved child, claiming to be beckoned by a white dream-child at night. Initially, I dismissed the tale. Yet now, the story haunted me, intertwining with my fears for Josephine. Was her fate to follow her grandmother's path? The thought was unbearable. Josephine, my young and lovely wife, surely this was just a troubling dream. So, I tried to reassure myself.

I held her hand as she guided me along the harbor shore under the moonlight. She followed the dream-child, pleading with him to wait, but eventually, the cries ceased. We returned home, the beauty of spring overshadowed by the haunting experience. The dream-child's calls tormented her, especially at night during storms. We searched for him by the shore, her desperation palpable. Concerned, I confided in our doctor, who advised me to care for her and protect her. As summer approached, the situation worsened, and whispers spread. When the dream-child called in broad daylight, I knew the end was near. The doctor warned me that I needed help.

I never mentioned the dream-child to my wife. The doctor advised against it, fearing it would worsen her delusion. The idea of an asylum was suggested, but I vehemently rejected it.

We found a small boat left on the shore, abandoned by the retreating tide. In it was a frightened toddler, about two years old, sitting in water, crying. His big blue eyes were wide with fear, tears streaking his pale face. When he saw us, he reached out his tiny hands, wailing. The child was alive, and my fear vanished. I felt compelled to help him. The child had brought relief to the emptiness in my heart. We took him home, just before a storm hit. The child, wet and tired, was dressed in dry clothes and fed.

I put on my pale blue muslin and styled my hair as Hester would have liked. Despite feeling tired and heartbroken, I wanted to honor her memory. Although I initially did my hair in a style she disapproved of, I changed it to the way she preferred. Hester never liked mourning, believing that true sorrow came from the heart. She wanted me to continue wearing pretty dresses and live my life as usual after she passed away. The garden was filled with roses, Hester's favorite flower. As I pinned a cluster of roses to my dress, I felt a deep sense of loneliness. Raised by Hester after our parents died, she was more like a mother to me. Now alone, I longed for human connection, especially thinking of Hugh, whom I tried to push out of my mind.|"[""1.

I lacked family pride and craved the simple joys of friendship over our exalted status. Hester, on the other hand, emphasized our Meredith superiority, hindering my connections with others. When Hugh Blair arrived in Newbridge, he saw me as an equal, unlike the townsfolk. We spent time together, and he courted me traditionally, unlike the formalities of the Meredith home. Mary Sloane encouraged his visits, hoping I'd find love. Hester disapproved of our bond, and I, weak and yielding, ended it to please her. Hugh left quietly, leaving me heartbroken.

After some time, the ache in my heart lessened. Yet, life felt dull and empty, despite Hester, my roses, and Sunday-School. I thought Hugh Blair would find a wife elsewhere, but he didn't. Years passed, and although we crossed paths at church, he never tried to approach me. Hester watched me closely during these encounters, but I didn't allow any interaction. Still, my heart longed for him. I was relieved he hadn't married, as it allowed me to cherish my thoughts and dreams of him. It may have been foolish, but it filled a void in my life. I was reminded of my mother, who, even in death, retained a look of pride and resolve that overshadowed her kindness. Despite the hurtful words from Hugh, I couldn't betray my promise to the departed. As he left in sorrow, I sat in the moonlit garden, weeping for him. Eventually, a sense of peace and warmth enveloped me.|"[""1.

One night, under the bright moonlight, a strange yet true event unfolded in the garden. The air was calm, not a single breeze stirred, and the moon shone brightly. In this serene setting, a tall woman appeared, walking gracefully. At first, she seemed unfamiliar, but as she came closer, it became clear—it was Hester. Despite the initial shock, a sense of calmness washed over, for deep down, it was known that Hester still held love. Her face bore a new expression, one of humility and tenderness, unlike ever before. In that moment, a profound understanding passed between them, bridging any previous gaps. The encounter, though eerie, brought a sense of closeness and connection that transcended any fear or confusion.|"['1.

I rose and followed her from the garden. We strolled together along our lane, under the willows, and onto the road, which stretched long and quiet under the bright moonlight. It felt like a dream, as if I was being led by a will beyond my own, a feeling of boundless content filled me. Walking past young fir trees, I caught the scent of balsam and admired their dark silhouettes against the sky. Hester moved silently, while I heard the crunch of twigs under my feet. As we passed through the Avenue, dimly lit by apple trees, I could see Hester's face clearly, her gentle smile never wavering. Just as James Trent approached, I felt a pang of annoyance at the thought of gossip. But as his horse bolted, I realized he hadn't seen Hester. We reached Hugh Blair's place, and it dawned on me why she had returned. Overwhelmed with joy, I gazed at her, speechless. Continuing our walk, we approached Hugh's house, surrounded by vines and a garden of fragrant flowers. I felt an indescribable sense of happiness and gratitude.|"['1.

We pitied Miss Emily, Mr. Leith's unmarried sister, who was insignificant in the household. Despite our sympathy, we couldn't warm up to her due to her intrusive and critical nature. She seemed resentful towards young people and their romances, likely because she never had one herself. Miss Emily was stout, with a round, red face, sparse gray hair, and a waddling gait. Her death didn't elicit much sorrow, as she passed without leaving anyone behind to mourn her. Upon receiving a trunk from her after her death, Anne and Diana opened it to find a sealed cardboard box. The atmosphere was eerie as they unraveled the mystery, with the wind howling outside.|"[""1.

"In a small box, we discovered a charming, vintage blue muslin gown with a delicate darker blue flower. Along with it, we found a sash, a yellowed feather fan, and a faded envelope filled with withered flowers. At the box's base rested a tiny brown book, reminiscent of a girl's exercise book, with blue and pink leaves now stained and faded. The flyleaf read ""Emily Margaret Leith"" in a delicate script that continued onto the initial pages. Diana and I sat on the floor, engrossed in the book as rain tapped against the window panes. The narrative within detailed a young girl's visit to Aunt Margaret in Charlottetown, where she marveled at the city's beauty and her aunt's generosity.

Sara reluctantly sewed quilts for the journey, despite her dislike for patchwork. Mrs. Eben, resigned to Sara's decision, praised Lige's character.

Mrs. Cynthia White, Thyra's neighbor, was irritated by Thyra's stillness, comparing her to a stone statue. Mrs. White believed Thyra worshipped her son above all else, even before God. As the cold autumn evening set in, Thyra sat motionless, waiting for her son, Chester, to return. She loved the harsh beauty of the darkening sky and sea, refusing to light a lamp to preserve the natural grandeur. Despite her disdain for dogs, Thyra's heart softened at the sound of Chester's dog whining outside. She harbored a fierce love for her son, wanting his undivided affection in return. Thyra's intense maternal love for Chester contrasted sharply with Mrs. White's lack of understanding, as she knit across the lane with only daughters to keep her company.|"['1.

As darkness fell, the stars twinkled above the harvested fields, but Chester had not returned. Cynthia White, across the lane, had given up watching for Thyra and lit a lamp. Thyra felt lonely, deciding to wait for Chester on the bridge when a loud knock startled her. August, a small, crippled man, barged in, delivering a crumpled newspaper. Known for spreading gossip, August was tolerated due to his disability. He harbored malice towards those who were kind to him, including Thyra and Chester. Thyra asked about Chester, unknowingly giving August the chance to sow discord. He hinted about Chester's delay, hinting at a pretty girl distracting him.

Cynthia speculated that Chester might be at the Blairs' house, not home yet. She wondered if Thyra suspected he was with Damaris.

Cynthia warned against confronting Thyra, calling her unpredictable and fierce, especially when it came to Chester. Carl defended Thyra, having once been in love with her. He worried about her pacing the bridge and regretted not intervening. Chester, handsome and mild-mannered, faced his mother's interrogation upon returning.

I watched Betty closely for about a week, traveling to Glenby every day and back at night, reflecting on what I saw. Eventually, I made a decision I never thought I would. I decided to send Betty to a boarding school for a year so she could learn to live with other girls. The next day, I went to Glenby and found Betty on the lawn, just back from a ride. She was on the mare I gave her, laughing at her dogs playing around her. Seeing her so carefree and childlike made me happy. Despite her tall stature, she still had the innocence of a child. I knew she would have to grow up eventually, but I wished she could stay a child forever. When I told Betty she had to go to school for a year, she reluctantly agreed. It was a lonely year without her, but her letters made it better. When she returned, she had changed for the better, and Sara was thrilled with her progress.|"['1.

This worried me greatly. What had happened to Betty? I discovered she had gone to the pineland for a walk, so I hurried there. When I spotted her strolling down a lengthy, golden-brown path, I hid behind a tree to observe her—I wanted to watch her without being seen. As she approached, I looked at her with pride, admiration, and surprise, but beneath it all, a strange, dreadful feeling crept in, one I couldn't comprehend and had never felt before, not even when Sara had turned me down. Betty had transformed into a woman! It wasn't just the elegant white dress hugging her tall, slender frame, or the glossy dark brown hair piled on her head in shiny coils, or the added softness and grace in her figure; it was the yearning and wonder in her eyes. She was a woman, unknowingly seeking love. The realization hit me hard, leaving me somewhat pale. I was pleased. She had become what I wished her to be. However, I longed for the child-like Betty; this mature Betty felt distant. When I stepped out to greet her, she saw me, her face lighting up. But instead of rushing into my arms as before, she approached swiftly, extending her hand. Initially, I thought she looked a bit pale, but then I noticed a beautiful flush on her face. I held her hand—no kisses this time. She didn't mention how glad she was to see me,|"['1.

As I rode back home, I reflected on my appearance for the first time in years. Staring at my reflection, I noticed the wrinkles on my face and the silver strands in my hair. It dawned on me that I had indeed aged. Betty, who once saw me as old at the age of ten, must now view me as ancient at eighteen. Despite trying to dismiss these thoughts, memories of Betty lingered, making my heart ache. True to my predictions, Glenby soon became a hub for suitors, much to Sara's delight. Betty, now a sought-after belle, received numerous proposals, causing some admirers to vanish mysteriously. Attempting to curb Betty's flirtatious ways, I failed. Determined to find her a suitable husband, I set my sights on my nephew, Frank. With his admirable qualities, he seemed a perfect match for Betty. Planning their meeting, I endeavored to fulfill my fatherly duty and bring an end to the commotion.|"['1.

I hadn't mentioned Betty to Frank. When he visited, I introduced him to her unexpectedly among the beech trees. It was impossible not to be captivated by her charm. She wore white with flowers in her hair, a vision of allure. I felt a pang of jealousy but left them alone. Frank's infatuation pleased me; it was my plan after all. The next day, Frank went to see Betty without me. I kept busy supervising the greenhouse construction but my thoughts drifted to Betty and the yellow roses she once wore. Frank's courtship progressed well until a sudden change. Worried about Betty, I visited her in the pine woods. She seemed troubled.

Betty, with her brown hair nestled on Stephen's shoulder, expressed how he had taught her everything, including love. Frank, who was left out, behaved nobly upon hearing the news.

Once, Electa struck Christopher's ears. Eunice, who was knitting nearby, rose. A likeness to her mother, previously unseen, emerged on her face like a mark. She raised her hand and hit Electa's cheek deliberately twice, leaving a faint red mark. Despite discord in the Holland household, the children matured. Caroline longed for this outcome. At seventeen, Christopher was a grown man, robust and considered attractive. He took over his mother's farm, and he and Eunice embarked on a new life in the long-uninhabited house. There was little regret when they left Charles Holland's home. Eunice felt immense relief in her heart. Christopher had been rebellious, staying out late and mingling with questionable companions. This led to clashes with Charles. For four years after returning home, Eunice faced challenges as Christopher was idle and reckless. Despite being perceived as worthless by many, Eunice never gave up on him. Her dedication paid off as Christopher reformed and worked diligently. Though he didn't reciprocate her devotion, he never mistreated Eunice. When Eunice turned twenty-eight, Edward Bell proposed. Caroline tried to arrange the marriage, but Christopher vehemently opposed it. He couldn't bear to lose Eunice and threatened drastic measures if she left.

Eunice felt hurt when she was told she might miss her chance with Christopher. When he started courting Victoria Pye, a feud between the Hollands and the Pyes erupted. Despite the family's disapproval, Christopher continued his relationship with Victoria. Eunice, consumed by jealousy, confronted Christopher but was surprised by his calm response. He reassured her that marriage was his choice and urged her to ignore the family feud. That night, Eunice waited for Christopher, reminiscing about her mother's passing. The moonlight illuminated the old-fashioned garden, filled with fragrant mint. Eunice, tired from working in the garden, pondered her feelings as she awaited her brother's return.|"[""1.

Eunice felt a sense of dread as she sat alone in the house, trying to come to terms with Christopher's upcoming marriage. Despite her efforts to accept the situation, loneliness crept in. When Christopher arrived, he shared his plans to marry in the spring and mentioned the need for Eunice to find a new living arrangement. He assured her of his care but explained that his future wife was uncomfortable living with Eunice. Christopher proposed building a separate house for her.

Eunice walked unsteadily through the hall into the room where her mother passed away. The room remained untouched, just as Naomi had left it. Sitting on the bed, memories flooded back. She remembered the vow she made to her mother in that very room. Would she be forced to leave her home and the only person she loved? Would Christopher allow it, despite her sacrifices for him? Eunice felt overwhelmed with worry. Caroline, seizing the chance to gloat, offered Eunice a place in her home. Eunice accepted, feeling indifferent about her fate. As life went on, Eunice found herself serving in Charles Holland's home, where Victoria now ruled. Despite Caroline's updates on Victoria's actions, Eunice remained aloof, except for the moment when Victoria turned her mother's room into a parlor, igniting a spark of anger in Eunice.|"['1.

The town of Avonlea was filled with whispers about Christopher Holland's troubled marriage. Eunice, unjustly blaming Victoria, harbored a deep hatred towards her. As autumn set in, Charles Holland brought alarming news home one night, casting a shadow of fear over the land. When Caroline shared a concert story with Christopher the next morning, his face turned pale. Worried, Caroline suggested checking on Christopher, who had been isolating himself at home since Victoria's absence. Eunice, stubborn like her mother, refused to visit Victoria's house. Caroline, after milking, hurried to Christopher's house, finding him with a grave expression. Christopher revealed he had been in close contact with a sick sailor at a recent concert and requested a doctor, warning everyone to stay away.

Eunice was determined and unfazed by the news that Christopher might have the smallpox. Despite her aunt's warnings, she insisted on going to him, believing he needed her care. With a strong resemblance to her mother showing in moments of tension, Eunice stood firm in her decision. She knew Christopher wouldn't get the proper care at the hospital. As her aunt realized she couldn't dissuade Eunice, she slumped into a chair, feeling defeated. Eunice's resolve was unwavering as she set out to cross the field to Christopher's house.

"Christopher sat down heavily in a chair, his selfish nature taking over as he didn't try to stop Eunice. She placed a lamp on the table beside him and examined his face closely. ""Don't worry. Many people recover from smallpox with proper care, and you'll be one of them. Charles is fetching the doctor, and we'll know more soon. You need to go to bed,"" she instructed. Eunice, feeling at ease, took off her hat and shawl and made the house orderly with disinfectants. When the doctor and Giles Blewett arrived, they found Eunice managing everything calmly.

It was a tough battle for Eunice as she cared for her ailing brother Christopher Holland. Despite his condition, Eunice showed incredible endurance, never leaving his side. She stayed awake, tending to him with unwavering patience and tenderness. Days passed, and the doctor's grave expression hinted at the inevitable. Christopher's passing left Eunice alone in the house, her devotion to him unwavering. She felt a void in her life, wondering how to face the future. One night, Eben Bell entered the room, bringing warmth and light to the somber atmosphere. The town was abuzz with the evangelist's visit, but Eunice's grief overshadowed the excitement.

Last night, Flora Jane Fletcher asked me why father never testified, especially being one of the elders. She mentioned that the minister was puzzled by it. I could feel my face turning red.""

""But Eb, everyone in town is discussing it. Mother is so upset. Since these meetings started, Father has been acting strangely. He just goes there every night and sits quietly with his head down. Almost everyone else in Avonlea has testified.""

Miriam Bell, a serious-looking girl who had recently found faith during the meetings, entered the kitchen. She was about to leave for the gathering with Major Spencer. Miriam had stood up for prayer and testimony multiple times, impressing the evangelist with her spirituality. She overheard Mollie's comments and spoke disapprovingly.

Eben had slipped away quickly, fearing Miriam would engage him in a religious conversation. Having recently dodged a sermon from Robert in the cow-stable, Eben lamented the lack of peace for the unconverted in Avonlea. Reflecting on his upbringing, Eben acknowledged his family's strong religious beliefs, despite his occasional tendency to joke about them."|"[""1.

Eben soon arrived with the family sleigh and his chubby red horse for Mollie. He hadn't yet earned a cutter of his own, leaving that distinction to his older brother, Robert, who emerged in a new fur coat and drove off with bells and sparkle. The wintry twilight descended over the snow-covered landscape as they traveled down the lane beneath frost-covered wild cherry trees. The snow crackled under the sleigh's runners, while a sharp wind whistled through the bare dogwoods. The sky shimmered with silver hues, dotted with a few stars. Mollie, nestled in furs and straw at the bottom of the sleigh, expressed her distress about her father's behavior at the evangelist's meetings. Meanwhile, Mrs. Bell, at home, fretted about her husband's mysterious troubles, feeling torn between worry and sacrilegious thoughts.|"['1.

Mrs. Bell felt a mix of anger and hurt as she was whisked away in the sleigh by her husband. He seemed more concerned with her physical comfort than her emotional turmoil. The silence between them was heavy as they passed snow-covered trees in the quiet winter night. Mary resented her husband's lack of enthusiasm for the revival meetings in Avonlea, unlike the rest of the community. The absence of Uncle Jerry, who had always opposed such emotional displays of faith, left a void in the church. The arrival of the charismatic Rev. Geoffrey Mountain stirred the parish, but Mary found herself conflicted by her husband's stoic demeanor.

David Bell felt dejected as he followed her into the crowded church. The pastor read from the Bible, while David noticed Mollie in the choir looking troubled.

She seemed more composed than I, having resolved her decision. She was set to wed Mark Foster, yet her heart lingered in France, where Owen Blair lay in an unknown grave, a victim of war. She reminisced about their shared past, from childhood to the first expressions of love, dreams, and aspirations. The only incident she omitted was when Owen defended her honor against Mark. It was all about Owen -- his essence, his potential, and the what-ifs. And there I was, consoling her, as her stepmother slumbered contentedly in the adjacent room.

After she poured out her heart, she reclined on her pillow once more. I rose to kindle the fire downstairs, feeling worn and desolate. Isabella Clark descended shortly after, looking cheerful and radiant. I had never warmed up to Isabella, not since the day Philippa's father introduced her. This morning, my dislike for her deepened.

When I was crying, a knock came at the door. I thought it was Mark Foster early, but I didn't want to see him. I tremble at the thought of sending Isabella to the door. Looking up, I saw Owen, tall and handsome, with a scar on his forehead. Though confused, I felt thankful. He couldn't believe Phillippa was marrying Mark. I explained it was her stepmother's scheme. Isabella and Mark entered, and Isabella looked devastated. Owen insisted on hearing from Phillippa herself. Isabella claimed Phillippa didn't want to see Owen. Owen defended himself, saying he did write. He refused to discuss it further until he heard from Phillippa directly.|"[""1.

Mark Foster, a man of few words, approached Owen with a stark contrast in appearance. Despite this, he met Owen's furious glare with a calm demeanor. Isabella, misjudging Phillippa, felt despair as Owen, driven by love and hope, believed he had won. However, Mark and I, knowing Phillippa well, were not optimistic. Without speaking, I hoped Owen's unexpected appearance would sway her decision. Leading her downstairs, I felt her cold hands. In the parlor, Mark revealed Owen's return, leaving Phillippa to choose between them. In a moment of intense emotion, Phillippa's love for Owen was evident. Mark, realizing her true feelings, released her from their engagement, prioritizing her happiness over his own. He then departed, leaving behind the mortgage, signifying his understanding of her true desires.|"[""1.

Elinor Blair, once a beautiful girl in Avonlea, returned from visiting her brother in the Canadian Northwest changed. She had a shadowed look and kept a distance from men. Her brother later revealed the reason for her sadness, a story about Jerome Carey, who was stationed at a trading post called the Flats. Carey found the place desolate and lonely, with a mix of half-breeds and Indians camping outside. Despite teaching Paul Dumont the telegraph code, Carey felt isolated. He blamed his transfer to the Flats on a feud with a man in Prince Albert. Carey's only solace was Mrs. Joe Esquint's cooking and her admiration for him. His handsome looks and charm made him a favorite, but his heart was burdened by the desolation of the Flats.|"['Question 1: Why did Elinor Blair return from visiting her brother in the Canadian Northwest changed?\nA) She fell in love with Jerome Carey\nB) She was homesick for Avonlea\nC) She had a shadowed look and kept a distance from men\nD) She found a new job in the Canadian Northwest\nE) She wanted to explore the wilderness', ""Question 2: What was Jerome Carey's occupation at the Flats?\nA) Teacher\nB) Trader\nC) Telegraph operator\nD) Chef\nE) Hunter"", 'Question 3: What did Carey feel about the Flats?\nA) Happy and content\nB) Desolate and lonely\nC) Exciting and adventurous\nD) Crowded and noisy\nE) Peaceful and serene', ""Question 4: What was the reason for Carey's transfer to the Flats?\nA) He wanted a change of scenery\nB) He had a feud with a man in Prince Albert\nC) He was promoted\nD) He was following Mrs. Joe Esquint\nE) He was searching for Paul Dumont"", ""Question 5: What brought Carey solace at the Flats?\nA) Teaching telegraph code to Paul Dumont\nB) Mrs. Joe Esquint's cooking and admiration\nC) Exploring the wilderness\nD) Making friends with the locals\nE) Writing letters to Elinor Blair"", ""Question 6: What burdened Carey's heart at the Flats?\nA) Lack of telegraph equipment\nB) Being away from his family\nC) His feud with a man in Prince Albert\nD) Mrs. Joe Esquint's constant attention\nE) The desolation of the place""]"|"['C) She had a shadowed look and kept a distance from men', 'C) Telegraph operator', 'B) Desolate and lonely', 'B) He had a feud with a man in Prince Albert', ""B) Mrs. Joe Esquint's cooking and admiration"", 'E) The desolation of the place']"
Mrs. Joe, an older woman, was so unattractive that even gossip from skulking breeds and Indians couldn't suggest anything improper about her relationship with Carey. However, things were different with Tannis Dumont. Tannis returned from the academy in July, bringing new excitement to Carey's life at the Flats. Despite his initial boredom, Carey found renewed interest upon meeting Tannis, a stunning young woman with a mix of Cree, French, and Scottish heritage. Tannis had a graceful demeanor and a captivating presence that drew Carey in. Their interactions included music, conversation, and horseback rides across the prairies, where Tannis's equestrian skills left Carey in awe. Despite their growing bond, Carey's perception of their relationship as a friendly flirtation was a mistake, as Tannis didn't understand flirtatious intentions due to her cultural background.|"['Question 1: How did Carey initially feel upon meeting Tannis Dumont?\nA) Bored\nB) Excited\nC) Annoyed\nD) Indifferent\nE) Confused', 'Question 2: What qualities did Tannis Dumont possess that captivated Carey?\nA) Graceful demeanor\nB) Captivating presence\nC) Equestrian skills\nD) All of the above\nE) None of the above', 'Question 3: What cultural background did Tannis Dumont come from?\nA) Cree\nB) French\nC) Scottish\nD) Cree, French, and Scottish\nE) English', 'Question 4: How did Carey perceive his relationship with Tannis Dumont?\nA) Friendly flirtation\nB) Serious romance\nC) Casual friendship\nD) Business partnership\nE) Sibling bond', ""Question 5: Why did Tannis Dumont not understand Carey's flirtatious intentions?\nA) She was not interested in Carey\nB) She was from a different cultural background\nC) She was already in a relationship\nD) She was too shy to reciprocate\nE) She misunderstood Carey's actions"", 'Question 6: What activities did Carey and Tannis Dumont engage in together?\nA) Music\nB) Conversation\nC) Horseback rides\nD) All of the above\nE) None of the above']"|['A) Bored', 'D) All of the above', 'D) Cree, French, and Scottish', 'A) Friendly flirtation', 'B) She was from a different cultural background', 'D) All of the above']
Once in a while, Carey and Tannis rowed across the river to explore the Saskatchewan valley, where they strolled among ancient pines. Carey, sharing poetry with Tannis, found her views on the long-winded nature of poetry amusing. Despite their close bond, Carey never saw Tannis as more than a friend. The locals, however, believed they were destined to marry due to Tannis being Auguste's heiress. While the priest, Father Gabriel, disapproved of their different backgrounds, the French half-breed, Lazarre Mérimée, harbored ill feelings towards Carey, who he saw as a rival for Tannis's affections. Despite the rumors, Carey remained oblivious to the expectations surrounding his relationship with Tannis, as he saw her through a lens of friendship rather than romance.|"[""1.

Carey moaned and closed his eyes. With Father Gabriel absent, there was no one available to go. Old Auguste and the doctor couldn't leave Paul, and Carey knew no one at the Flats would risk coming out on such a stormy night, fearing the law's repercussions. He realized he might never see Elinor again. Tannis gazed down at Mrs. Joe Esquint's sickly face. Her expression revealed nothing of her inner turmoil. After a moment, she left quietly, leaving the wounded man and Mrs. Joe behind. Paul's cries filled the next room as the doctor tended to him, but Tannis ignored it, rushing to old Auguste's stable.
