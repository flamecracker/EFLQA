In the bustling town of Dijon, excitement filled the air as news of an impending war with Prussia spread. The usually calm streets were abuzz with groups of people discussing the latest developments.

During the war, trains filled with cannons and deadly shells passed through Dijon, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation among the people.

However, Captain Barclay remained cautious, expressing concerns about the delay in French military action. The boys, Ralph and Percy, remained optimistic, believing in the strength of the French army. Despite their father's worries about the advancing German forces, the boys eagerly gathered around maps to discuss potential battle strategies. As news of German advancements spread, Captain Barclay contemplated the need to retreat and fortify a more defensible position along the Moselle River and the Vosges mountains.

Captain Barclay explained to the boys that the news of the German offensive was likely to be true, despite both sides claiming victories. The Prussians, having made the first move, would concentrate their forces towards Strasbourg, Metz, or Nancy. The French, aware of this, would aim to block their advance. The recent defeats had sparked outrage in France, leading to fresh troop mobilization and a renewed war spirit. Captain Barclay warned that France faced tough times ahead, especially if Bazaine's retreat failed. He suggested that only by resorting to guerrilla tactics and cutting off supply lines could the French have a chance against the victorious Prussian forces. Despite initial defeats, the French were determined to fight on, with the hope of turning the tide against the invaders.|"['1.

I believe that many young men in France will have to join the war, requiring immense courage and a complete disregard for life. The lack of discipline, weapons, artillery, and organization poses challenges. If France resists, the Prussians may advance, potentially reaching towns like Lyons. News of fierce battles near Metz caused concern, with Bazaine's army trapped. In Dijon, the urgency was understood, with Mobiles and soldiers mobilizing. Despite some trying to evade duty, true patriotism was evident, with volunteers, even among those with families. The situation is critical, and the outcome uncertain.

Most of those who signed up to join the corps were landowners or their sons from the Dijon area. Since the government hadn't made any arrangements for franc tireurs, there was no pay available. The call was mainly for those willing and able to go at their own expense. Other recruits were few, as they could join the regular forces for pay and benefits. The men who did volunteer were mostly skilled workers like foresters and woodcutters, seeking adventure and action. Subscriptions quickly came in to arm and equip those unable to do so. A meeting was held for the volunteers, including Ralph, Percy, and their school friends, all around sixteen.

Great excitement filled the air as August neared its end, with all eyes anxiously fixed on news of a battle near Chalons, where MacMahon was rallying a new army. The camp at Chalons was disbanded, and MacMahon set off to aid Bazaine. Days of anticipation followed until, on September 3rd, word arrived of the French army's defeat at Sedan. The news seemed unbelievable, with a hundred thousand soldiers surrendering. Paris then erupted in revolution, stirring mixed emotions. Captain Barclay expressed concern over the upheaval, fearing its impact on France's ability to resist the Prussians. He believed only a fierce defense by the people could turn the tide. Despite the political turmoil, the call to fight for France remained unchanged. Paris, with its formidable defenses, could withstand a siege, giving France time to resist and force the Prussians to retreat.|"[""1.

Captain Tempe addressed the corps the next morning, emphasizing their duty as Frenchmen amidst differing political opinions. He urged them to focus on being patriots and putting France first. The men were pleased with the idea of avoiding political discussions during the war. The corps turned out in uniforms, feeling proud and eager to face the Prussians. The arrival of Snider rifles was initially met with hesitation but soon accepted for their advantages. Ralph and Percy intervened in a street scuffle, saving an Irishman from a violent mob.

The police officers signaled that the prisoner, now recovered, must immediately go before the Mayor. The young Barclays went with him, serving as translators during the questioning. Tim, an Irishman, had worked as a groom for an Englishman in Lyons. When his employer returned to England due to illness, Tim stayed on with a horse dealer. As war broke out, Tim, with limited French, faced suspicion of being a spy in Lyons. After a close call with a hostile crowd, the Barclays intervened and proved Tim's innocence with his documents. The Mayor released Tim, but due to his injuries and the dangerous situation in Dijon, the Barclays offered him shelter for the night.

The farewell scene was a somber one, with Milly sobbing, Mrs. Barclay shedding tears in solitude, and their father trying to hide his emotions as he bid his children goodbye. Despite their soldierly demeanor, the boys couldn't help but cry. Tim Doyle had left earlier, taking their blankets, leaving the boys with only their guns as they rushed towards the town, tears blurring their vision. As they reached the town, the bugle called them to assemble. They composed themselves and prepared to depart, leaving their despondency behind. The Franc Tireurs of Dijon, led by Major Tempe, marched through the city in their brownish-gray uniforms with rolled-up blankets and waterproof caps.

Major Tempe decided to exceed the planned number of 120 soldiers due to concerns about food and logistics if the driver was not included. The troops embarked on a short march to the railway station where they boarded the train amid cheers from onlookers. The slow train journey through picturesque landscapes and the Vosges mountains was uneventful. At Vesoul, locals greeted them with food and support, fearing the Uhlans. In Epinal, a warm welcome awaited, with the Mayor and residents showing appreciation. The soldiers were billeted for the night, with families offering accommodation. The Barclays and Duburgs were accommodated together and conversed about the corps and the enemy's movements.

The soldiers marched towards Deyvilliers, the first village on their journey. After walking five miles, they took a brief break. While some soldiers searched for food, others enjoyed bread, cheese, and fruit by a stream. They resumed their march and reached Fontaine after another five miles. Major Tempe called for a three-hour halt to rest and eat. They set up fires, cooked meals, and enjoyed a picnic-like atmosphere with villagers offering small gifts. After the meal, they packed up and continued for another eight miles until they reached Destord. With only a few houses, they decided to camp outdoors near a stream.

The soldiers had a simple supper by the fires after a long day's march. Major Tempe decided not to set sentries that night, but warned them that it would be the norm moving forward. The next day, they reached Rambervillers and then Baccarat, where they stayed, preparing to head towards Halloville. The weather turned rainy, but they pressed on, eager for action as news of approaching Uhlans spurred them forward. However, a difficult path forced some men to stay behind. When they arrived at Halloville, the villagers mistook them for enemies at first but soon welcomed them warmly.

At three o'clock, the rain stopped, much to the delight of the group. They followed a villager down to where the forest met the road, creating a strategic defensive position. Major Tempe positioned his men in the woods, setting up a barrier called an abattis using wire and felled trees to block the road. By morning, everything was ready. Scouts reported the approach of Uhlans, enemy cavalry, down the valley. Each man took his position quietly, ready to fire. Ralph and Percy were stationed near the road. They waited anxiously until Major Tempe gave the signal. When the Uhlans approached, the hidden franc tireurs opened fire, causing chaos among the cavalry.

The Uhlans faced an unexpected attack from unseen enemies and had to retreat behind cover. The officers displayed calmness, guiding their men out of danger. The cavalry dismounted and advanced on foot, engaging in a heavy firefight. The Prussians fell into an ambush, resulting in casualties on both sides.

Two carts arrived from the village of Douteppe, near the valley where the action took place. The wounded were placed in one cart, while the other carried the arms of the fallen Uhlans. A young surgeon accompanied the wounded to Baccarat for treatment. Twenty-three captured Uhlans' horses were to be taken back to Epinal for disposal. Major Tempe decided that a slightly wounded Prussian prisoner would walk back to Blamont to inform the Uhlans to retrieve their wounded without interference. The fallen comrades were buried, and the corps planned to establish headquarters in the mountains. They faced hardships on the march but finally arrived in the village of Raon.

The group enjoyed a hearty breakfast after three days of scarce meals. Most men relaxed, smoking their pipes and enjoying a day of leisure. Village boys herded the animals into the woods for grazing. They decided to pack supplies on horses for future expeditions, finding the cart useless. While on a pleasant walk, they discussed the lack of dangerous animals in the area. The landscape was stunning, with dense forests giving way to expansive views of the countryside. The villagers were poor but resilient, speaking German but having a French spirit. The group planned to disrupt the railway and split into smaller units to cover more ground. They settled in a village, arranging lodgings and gathering crucial information while avoiding detection by the enemy.

Major Tempe expressed disbelief at the edict issued, deeming it impossible for a civilized army to do so. He recounted a similar situation during an invasion of Germany where people were called upon to defend their land. Concerned about the consequences of the war, he mentioned the risks involved in seeking shelter. Major Tempe's concerns were shared by other officers present. Meanwhile, Ralph and Percy overheard a commotion involving Tim Doyle, who was trying to find a light source for supper. Due to a language misunderstanding, a dispute arose but was quickly resolved with explanations. The boys, along with Tim, were provided with candles to illuminate the schoolroom, revealing the setup with beds, rifles, and a cozy fireplace.|"['1.

The cooks, excused from night duty, served soup to the men in bed on straw. Two boys, Percy and Ralph, proposed disguising as peasants to spy on the Prussians in Saverne. They bought peasant clothes and hid them in the woods. The boys received secret instructions from Major Tempe to keep it confidential. They started at daybreak, dressed as peasants, and walked to Saverne. In town, they eavesdropped on German soldiers, learning they expected no immediate action. The soldiers left, and locals lamented the Prussian occupation. The boys gathered minimal intel and returned safely, leaving their uniforms hidden. Their friends wished they could join but understood the need for secrecy.|"['1.

The boys eagerly absorbed the information they sought and left after paying for their drinks. They strolled to the railway station, catching sight of soldiers on guard, before heading to a spot with a view of the tunnel entrance. Two soldiers stood watch there, with others stationed along the line at intervals. Hidden in a wood, the boys observed long trains passing by every half hour, loaded with various supplies. At dusk, they witnessed Prussian soldiers relieving sentries and setting up fresh guards close together. After retrieving their uniforms, the boys rejoined the village, heading straight to headquarters where Major Tempe welcomed them warmly. Over dinner, they discussed plans to disrupt the enemy's operations, focusing on destroying the rock tunnel of Saverne. Major Tempe proposed a strategic approach involving different companies to secure the tunnel ends and execute the plan effectively.|"['1.

"Lieutenant de Maupas, a former sailor nicknamed ""Grande Vitesse,"" was admired by the men for his quick decisions and straightforward approach. Despite the challenge of destroying a tunnel within a short time, he acknowledged the difficulty due to its solid rock structure. Lieutenant Ribouville expressed concerns about the complexity of the task, noting that it would take days to create a chamber for the explosives. The men were disheartened by the realization that the tunnel's destruction was not a simple feat. However, they resolved to explore all options, including detonating nitroglycerine in the tunnel. The commandant emphasized the need for secrecy to prevent the Germans from discovering their plans. The Barclays' return sparked curiosity among their comrades, who were eager to learn about their mysterious mission. Ralph shared the details, sparking discussions and admiration for the Barclays' bravery."|"['1.

From now on, the men stopped making jokes at the boys' expense. Initially, some were against boys joining the corps, but the boys proved they could handle fatigue like the men. They performed well in action, and the Barclays' mission showed they were reliable in dangerous situations requiring calmness and courage. Afterward, all members were treated equally. Major Tempe decided to act quickly since they couldn't find a certain plan to destroy the tunnel. Four men, led by Lieutenant Ribouville, were sent in to place barrels with a timed fuse. Two companies were to create a diversion while the others carried out the plan. The boys disguised themselves and went to check the tunnel but found it heavily guarded. They gathered information in town but encountered German officers at a cafe, where they overheard discussions about their sudden deployment.|['1.

The commander received news yesterday that a group of enemy soldiers, who ambushed our cavalry near Blamont, is hiding in a village in the woods a few miles away. Their plan to blow up a tunnel was foiled, and a mission is planned to clear them out. These troublemakers must be taught a lesson. A traitorous schoolmaster offered to betray their location, but such treachery is despicable. The major, absorbed in the information, paid no heed to two boys overhearing the conversation. The boys, aware of the danger, informed the commander. The major, furious, led them to discuss the serious matter away from prying ears. The French officers were incensed, and the major, after a moment of silence, prepared for action.|"[""1.

The major addressed the men, revealing a treacherous plan thwarted by the Barclay brothers. The schoolmaster of Grunsdorf had betrayed them to the Prussians, jeopardizing a vital mission to blow up the Saverne tunnel. The Barclays, with their knowledge of German, had uncovered the plot. Major Tempe commended their courage and announced their names would be honored. The corps prepared for a new mission: to capture the traitor. As they marched towards Grunsdorf, Major Tempe outlined the plan to apprehend the schoolmaster. Caution was paramount to ensure success and prevent his escape. The men were determined to bring the traitor to justice for his betrayal of France.|['1.

In about thirty minutes, it will start getting dark. The Barclays have once again offered to help us. They will go ahead immediately, and an hour later, we will follow them and hide just outside the village until they return. The boys reached Grunsdorf later than expected, almost at nightfall. The village was quiet due to a light rain as they made their way through. They decided to enter the public house to ask for directions to the priest's house without drawing attention. While having some food and drink, a Prussian sergeant approached them, suspicious of their presence. To avoid trouble, Ralph came up with a plan for Percy to stay behind and warn their allies of the danger.

Ralph finished his drink, stood up, and addressed the sergeant, mentioning his brother's injured foot and readiness to depart. The sergeant, convinced by Ralph's explanation, patted his shoulder and expressed relief at the truth. Ralph subtly avoided dissuading the sergeant from his plans, ensuring their safety. As they reentered the room, Percy conversed with the landlord, and the sergeant's suspicions were dispelled. Ralph acknowledged the importance of the landlord's account in averting suspicion. Urging Percy to hurry, they left for the major and his men. Evading a passing Prussian soldier, they stealthily made their way to the forest, relieved to have avoided detection.|"['1.

They avoided entering the dark area to prevent making noise and alerting others. Instead, they stayed on the edge where the trees provided cover. A short whistle signaled their friends waiting nearby. Major Tempe, worried about their delay, sent someone to check on them. Ralph explained they narrowly escaped German captors. They decided against a risky crawl through unknown terrain. Two men were chosen for a stealthy mission to neutralize a sentry. They silenced and bound the sentry, assuming his post.

Major Tempe signaled for silence and gestured for the priest to open the window quietly. The priest, cautious of Prussian soldiers in the village, revealed the officer's room layout.

The follower quickly lit a lamp with a German match, often used in this part of France. They then helped the major bind the terrified prisoner, who had a letter from the colonel at Saverne in his pocket, along with ten hundred-thaler notes. The prisoner was lowered out the window with a rope onto a ladder by the men. The group quietly left the village without raising any alarm, marching down the road and turning into the forest. A fire was lit, and the prisoner was unbound and brought in front of the company. Major Tempe accused the prisoner of treason and gave him five minutes to seek forgiveness from God.

The soldiers had been on the move for days, with little rest in beds since their encounter with the Prussians. Reluctantly, they rose at the bugle's call in the afternoon. After a meal provided by locals, they marched towards Wasselonne. They camped in Casswiller near the forest of OEdenwald. The next day, they reached Still, overlooking the Rhine Valley. From there, they could see the cathedral spire of Strasburg. The village was meager, so villagers were sent to Raon for supplies. The corps split into companies, stationed in various villages, keeping watch over the plain. The first company focused on Mutzig, where they ambushed a group of horsemen from Molsheim.

During the battle, four men fell, and one was shot dead as he fired over a wall. Ralph Barclay got wounded in the arm. Major Tempe called for help from a nearby village, and volunteers came to aid the wounded. They carried the injured men back into the forest. The Germans, with more soldiers, appeared again. The fight intensified, but the franc tireurs had an advantage by lying low. As the Germans advanced, Major Tempe grew concerned about their silence and ordered De Maupas to check on them. De Maupas saw the Germans lying low and then noticed something alarming. He hurried to inform Major Tempe, indicating a potential threat.|['1.

The soldiers quickly left their firing position, rushing into the street and then sprinting towards the nearby forest. Despite the lack of immediate cover, the absence of wounded soldiers allowed for a swift retreat. However, it was clear they wouldn't reach the safety of the forest in time. Prussian cavalry swiftly pursued them, forming a line and galloping towards the fleeing soldiers. The franc tireurs, armed with rifles, slowed down, facing imminent danger from the cavalry. The soldiers were urged to keep moving towards the woods, maintaining formation and reserving their fire. A tense standoff ensued, with cavalry and infantry closing in on the franc tireurs.

The battle was over. Major Tempe praised his exhausted men, offering brandy and water as a small respite. Despite heavy losses, he commended their valor against larger enemy forces. The major's band, originally 55 strong, now only counted 31 survivors. Eight were severely wounded, and 15 were dead or missing. Among the wounded was Philippe, courageously tended to by the surgeon. The village, now ablaze, drew out its distraught residents. The invaders had left, leaving destruction in their wake. Major Tempe dispatched his men to aid the villagers, but the damage was irreparable due to the enemy's use of petroleum.

The village was left in ruins, with homeless people sitting around, gazing at their destroyed homes. Major Tempe, feeling remorseful, gathered his men and proposed to help. He handed over a sum of money found on a traitorous schoolmaster to the priest and schoolmaster. The money was to be distributed among the villagers for their necessities. The villagers, grateful for the aid, began rebuilding their homes using timber from the forest. The money provided hope and comfort, allowing them to buy blankets and other essentials. Despite the past animosity towards the franc tireurs, the villagers were now thankful for their assistance. The wounded were cared for and sent off for further treatment.

On the 28th, news arrived about the surrender of Strasburg after a brave defense. The Germans were expected to advance soon. The French forces in the Vosges mountains were growing. Unfortunately, many fighters joined to avoid other duties or on a whim. They lacked discipline and unity. Villagers sometimes mistreated the fighters, who struggled to get supplies. Major Tempe had to intervene to ensure his men received provisions. The fighters had sold captured animals and had money to pay for what they needed. Despite challenges, the corps had earned a good reputation for their courage. The boys received letters from home, bringing them joy.

As night fell, the camp fires dimmed, and the corps, except for the guards, fell asleep. At four in the morning, they were awakened and silently marched to their designated spots. By five, they were in position, waiting. The Barclays were with Major Tempe near the bridge, while Louis Duburg and Tim were at the village. The attack on the village was set for half-past five. The boys anxiously awaited the signal. Gunshots echoed, and the franc tireurs rushed forward. The Germans, caught off guard, were overpowered. The village was taken with minimal resistance.

The gun cotton barrels were opened, and men placed the contents into a hole, while rifles fired in the background. The franc tireurs exchanged fire with the enemy behind the bridge parapet. Suddenly, a distant boom signaled an explosion near the bridge, causing a retreat. The bridge collapsed, blocking traffic for a week. German artillerymen ceased fire, and the franc tireurs escaped into the forest. Despite success, villagers suffered German retaliation. The franc tireurs captured twelve Germans in reprisal for their fallen comrades. Major Tempe ensured justice by hanging the prisoners.

The way your boys endured fatigue shows how vital a nation's prosperity relies on training its youth. England's strength stems from boys engaging in active exercises and outdoor games, preparing them for challenges like wars. In contrast, our youth lack spirit and strength in emergencies.

If they had been active since childhood, like Ralph and Percy, they would have coped well. The boys' epaulets, earned through hard work, brought pride.

The commander spurred his horse and raced ahead, leaving Tim to follow slowly beside Ralph. Ralph's bleeding had stopped, and he managed to ride until they reached the headquarters at dawn. A surgeon set up an ambulance and tended to Ralph's wound, removing bandages and examining the injury. Tim felt queasy at the sight of the deep gash on Ralph's arm. The surgeon praised Ralph's luck, as the wound narrowly missed a major artery. Advising rest, the surgeon warned against riding due to blood loss. Meanwhile, the battle intensified with the Germans advancing. Percy rallied the Zouaves to charge, reclaiming a village amid heavy fire. Despite fierce fighting, the Germans gained ground, and chaos ensued among the Mobiles. Staff officers fell in the relentless conflict.|"[""1.

Percy, miraculously unharmed despite the chaos of battle, encountered two frightened children while on a mission. He assured them of safety and instructed them to pretend to play soldiers until their parents were found. Meanwhile, General Cambriels faced challenges after a tough battle. Short on supplies and with soldiers in need of rest, he decided to retreat to Besancon for reorganization. Ralph, recovering from a wound, was eager to return to duty.

"There is no chance of fighting when we're safe inside town walls. What's the point of wearing a uniform if not for battle? Will there be any skirmishes while we're back with the boys?"" Ralph said, examining his arm. ""It's like two or three fights, and even if you weren't hit, you were shot at enough, Tim."" ""I was shot at plenty, Mister Ralph; and I didn't quite enjoy it. Sitting behind the general like a statue with shells falling around you isn't pleasant,"" Tim replied. The boys laughed, and the day passed pleasantly as they rode and talked. At dusk, they met a group of franc tireurs, and the officer suggested they wait for their colonel. The boys agreed and settled by a fire with the franc tireurs.

Late at night, Ralph and his companion remained silent, unable to sleep. Ralph's sore arm kept him awake, and the windy night made it hard to distinguish sounds. The sentry, struggling against cold and drowsiness, suddenly raised concerns about strange noises. Listening carefully, they heard rustling above the wind. As dawn approached, they realized they were surrounded. The officer of the franc tireurs had already paid with his life for his carelessness. Ralph advised resistance, knowing surrender was futile. A fierce fight ensued, ending in silence. The Germans looted the houses and set them ablaze, indifferent to the destruction. Ralph noticed the major's brutality and the intense conversation with his officers. The scene highlighted the diverse nature of German officers, from kind to cruel.|"['1.

The commander, Major Kolbach, faced a tough decision. He knew following the order to execute franc tireurs and their supporters was wrong. The major hesitated, feeling the weight of the atrocity he was about to commit. The men under his command were horrified by his actions. Despite the strict discipline, they disapproved of the major's brutality. As the executions took place, some victims stood bravely, while others kneeled, begging for their lives. The young lieutenant's death shocked everyone present. The major, visibly disturbed, ordered a grave to be dug for his fallen comrade. The troops, led by the lieutenant after the major's demise, marched on somberly. The men's faces reflected the grim reality of their actions, even though they had achieved a military victory.

Ralph expressed confidence in their escape, citing their knowledge of German and youthful appearance as advantages. He mentioned the hope of being sent to Mayence or Coblentz rather than distant fortresses. The next day, they joined other prisoners, mainly Mobiles left behind in the retreat.

The sergeant joined the boys for a drink, reminiscing about a previous toast to King William. In return, they proposed a toast to Napoleon, who was now their prisoner. After a friendly farewell, the boys headed into town feeling relieved. They stayed at a hotel and then boarded a train to Mayence, a journey that lasted 36 hours. Despite the long trip, they were content knowing they were closer to the frontier and in a more comfortable position compared to other prisoners. The French officers in Mayence faced financial struggles, but the boys had enough money to sustain themselves. Arriving in Mayence, they settled into a lodging where Ralph's arm, injured during the journey, was treated. The family they lodged with took care of them, and Ralph's ability to speak their language endeared him to them.|['1.

The day was freezing, marking the start of November's second week. Despite the cold, the group felt liberated as they journeyed. Meeting few people, they exchanged brief greetings. Carrying bread and meat from Mayence, they avoided stopping at villages. To evade officials checking papers, they chose to sleep in the woods, using blankets for warmth.

The villagers warned them that they were not entirely safe yet due to Prussia's complaints. Both Dutch and Belgian authorities were arresting escaped prisoners. The boys decided to change into ordinary clothes, leaving their original ones behind, and head to Spa, twenty miles north. They spent an extra day resting due to swollen feet, then continued to Spa. After exploring the town, they took a train to Brussels, where they found relief. A good night's sleep rejuvenated them, and they departed for Dunkirk the next day.

Ralph explained his unique hairstyle idea to the hairdresser, who quickly sewed black chignon bands together for him. The hairdresser followed Ralph's instructions precisely, using shoemaker's wax to secure the band of artificial hair discreetly. After cutting and styling the long tresses, Ralph's new look was complete, with a bush of frizzly hair. Percy and Ralph then found suitable clothing in a second-hand store to complete their disguises. Percy reassured Tim, who was feeling left out, and they headed back to their lodgings. Ralph, now transformed with stained skin and in disguise, surprised Tim, who thought he was seeing an old man with a bushy head of hair.

The boys laughed uncontrollably for a while, leaving Tim bewildered. Percy finally composed himself and explained the situation to Tim. Ralph expressed his regret at not being able to take Tim with them to Paris due to the language barrier and the risks involved. Tim, deeply concerned, felt it was too dangerous for the boys to travel in a balloon. After a heartfelt conversation, Tim agreed to stay with Colonel Tempe until the boys returned, or until it seemed unlikely they would. The boys disguised themselves thoroughly, making it hard for even each other to recognize. Ralph, in particular, looked entirely different. They met Colonel Tempe for breakfast, pretending to be foreigners. Ralph's altered appearance surprised the colonel, who was puzzled by Ralph's transformed hair.|"[""1.

Percy expressed that they didn't want to eat rats and cats and requested to be sent out again by the next available balloon. The boys were up early the next day and met Colonel Tempe, who ensured they were the volunteers for the important mission. They received sealed dispatches of high importance to be delivered to General Aurelles. The dispatches were in duplicate to ensure their safe delivery. The boys were provided with horses and instructions for their journey, and they set off immediately. Upon reaching headquarters, they were admitted promptly, although their appearance had disguised their true identity. The colonel requested proof of their status before discussing further details about their mission.|"[""1.

"""Our horses will be here in five minutes,"" Ralph announced, ""and we aim to cover as much ground as possible tonight. We plan to cross the Loing at Montargis and push on to either Meaux or Melun by tomorrow evening. Melun is our preferred destination as it's the shortest route to Versailles. Our movements will be influenced by the Germans' positions.""

The colonel inquired, ""You haven't had breakfast, have you? I was just about to eat when you arrived. I head out to the front at ten, and it's already half-past nine. You won't find anything until Montargis.""

The boys accepted the invitation and joined the colonel for breakfast, where other officers were waiting. The colonel introduced the boys as Lieutenants Barclay on a vital mission. After a quick meal, the boys left Orleans, galloping alongside the Loire River towards Montargis. They rode through Chateauneuf and Bellegarde, encountering franc tireurs along the way. Captain Duprat accompanied them until Montargis, where they spent the night before continuing their journey north the next day."|"['1.

At seven in the morning, they set off on their journey. The roads were slippery from the snow trampled by the army. By five in the evening, they reached the sentries at Versailles. They were allowed to pass and continued on. Percy drove while Ralph sat next to him. Versailles was bustling with officers and soldiers, but no one paid them much attention. They struggled to find a bed but managed to park the wagon and stable the horses. They bought blankets and hoped for a cozy night. The town was filled with German invaders, making themselves at home. They explored the town and dined before settling in for the night. The next morning, they were seen sewing waterproof cloth on gloves for swimming. Ralph sought permits to go to Bellevue to purchase war souvenirs. They arrived at a villa where officers were gathered.|"['1.

There was a general interest in the room. The furniture was in a bad state, with torn papers and a chair on fire. The family portraits were riddled with holes, used for target practice. Ralph mentioned taking items to Germany, offering to transport goods to Frankfort for a fee. He haggled over prices with officers for various objects like pictures and clocks. After settling deals, he asked for cards to show his fair dealings. They stopped at Chaville before heading to Bellevue. At Bellevue, they negotiated for more valuable items. Ralph expressed interest in the garden view of Paris, but they were cautious not to be seen due to the risk of shells. The officer explained the strategic military setup to avoid detection. The house overlooked the river with a nearby island. The officer assured safety from potential attacks.|['1.

Ralph and Percy stayed back, finding reasons to delay, asking questions to learn about the area they needed to cross. They had a detailed map of Bellevue and Meudon in the wagon, marking every house. After buying supplies from French villas, darkness fell. Ralph informed the officers that he wouldn't return to Versailles until the next morning. He requested permission for them to sleep in a villa across the road to watch the forts fire around Paris. The officer agreed, and they were escorted to the villa. Once alone, Ralph discussed their plan to use life belts inflated with air to avoid drowning and deceive the sentries with a dummy in the water. They prepared their gear, including a dummy filled with corks and white calico suits for camouflage, ready to start their risky mission to the water under cover of darkness.|"['1.

"""Percy, the water will soak through, but it will stay warm from our body heat. It's better than icy water around us,"" said one of the boys. They removed their coats and put on warm clothes with rubber bandages. After donning life belts, white suits, and caps, they prepared for their mission. Carrying a ""dummy"" and revolvers, they sought protection before heading out into the dark, snowy night. Their white attire blended with the snow, aiding their stealth.

Ralph carefully instructed Percy to slip into the water quietly upon hearing a splash. He left a bag to mark Percy's entry point and tied a rope to a stone to join him later. Ralph planned to throw a stone near a dummy to create a distraction. However, as he prepared to throw the stone, he encountered a guard. In a swift move, Ralph fired his revolver, causing the guard to fall. Despite the chaos, Ralph managed to join Percy in the icy water, where they faced gunfire from the French. Percy felt his strength waning due to the cold, but Ralph encouraged him to keep swimming. Eventually, they spotted a gunboat that saved them from the perilous situation.|"[""1.

Some garments were prepared and warmed, and soon Ralph was beside his brother, Percy, who was regaining consciousness and experiencing the discomfort of returning circulation. Percy, confused, smiled upon seeing Ralph. Ralph joked about his appearance due to the cobbler's wax used to attach his beard and hair. Both brothers, Lieutenants Barclay, carried dispatches from Tours to General Trochu, receiving a warm welcome upon arrival. Despite their aching limbs and burning sensation, they were swiftly admitted to see General Trochu. The Farcey's commander recounted their rescue, and Doctor Marcey attended to Percy's high fever. Ralph, feeling the effects of the cold, fell asleep and was later informed that Percy had been moved to prevent disturbance.

Ralph was deeply concerned about his brother Percy, who was battling brain fever. Despite the doctor's reassurance, the situation was grave. Ralph was torn between staying by Percy's side and meeting with General Trochu, who wanted to hear about Ralph's daring journey through enemy lines. As he sat with Percy, Ralph observed his brother's delirium and distress. The doctor's words offered a glimmer of hope, but the uncertainty hung heavy in the air. Ralph, feeling the weight of exhaustion and worry, managed to eat a meal after a day of neglecting his own needs. As the evening wore on, he prepared to meet with the general, concealing himself from Percy's view to avoid causing further agitation.

Ralph had hardly been away for two days and had only left the hotel once. He read in the Gazette about his and Percy's promotion to commanders of the Legion for delivering dispatches from Tours to Paris through the German lines. After reading this, Ralph went out. He ordered new uniforms for both of them and bought ribbons of commander's rank at a shop in the Palais Royal. Ralph also got a haircut and removed the stain from his skin. Percy, recovering from a severe illness, was pleased with the news of their promotion. They visited the governor to secure their spots in the next balloon ride.

"Ralph respectfully agreed, ""I told you during the interview with Generals Ducrot and Vinoy that the false hair was crucial, and I'm only slightly older than my brother."" General Trochu expressed his astonishment at their accomplishments despite their young age, stating that courage knows no age. He offered them places on his staff or those of other generals, but Ralph declined, explaining that they are English and plan to return home after the war. Wanting to witness a battle near Orleans and to provide rest for his brother, Ralph preferred to leave. The general agreed and arranged for them to accompany Monsieur Teclier on a balloon journey the next morning. As they left, officers invited them to stay and chat, offering refreshments. Ralph shared their adventures and declined a dinner invitation, citing the early balloon departure. They returned to their hotel, noting the normalcy of the besieged city, with everyone in some form of uniform.

A message from the leader stated that the important papers would not be ready for another hour, which actually meant an hour and a half. This delay would make it light enough for them to be seen, and they would have to face challenges. Despite the circumstances, the group decided to pass the time cheerfully by enjoying some wine and a cigar near a warm fire. Monsieur Teclier gave instructions about the balloon, and they moved to a nearby work shed with a roaring fire. The wait was pleasant. At a quarter to seven, the dispatches finally arrived and were quickly loaded into the car along with everything else. The Barclays settled in, the signal was given, and they began their ascent over the rooftops as the dawn broke, revealing a breathtaking scene. The boys were amazed by the view, feeling as if the earth was slipping away beneath them. They marveled at the speed and direction of their journey, comparing it to a boat on a fast-moving river at night. Monsieur Teclier explained the challenge of determining their speed and direction without any fixed reference points. He emphasized the importance of spotting breaks in the clouds to gauge their progress. The boys eagerly peered over the edge, observing the ever-changing cloud formations below. Monsieur Teclier outlined their projected path and the plan to descend below the clouds in five hours to assess their position relative to landmarks like the Loire River. They were prepared to adjust their course based on what they could see.|"['1.

The aeronaut aboard the balloon noticed a change in the wind and realized they were drifting rapidly over an island. The descent was alarming due to the strong oscillations of the car. After a series of jerks and bumps, the balloon finally landed on the ground, causing the passengers to be thrown out. Fortunately, they were not seriously hurt. A doctor and some gentlemen who witnessed the fall rushed to help them. The boys, disguised as civilians, were relieved to be safe. The locals cheered as the passengers were taken to a nearby town for rest and a hot bath. The dispatches thrown out during the descent were also recovered.

The next question was about how to get to the mainland. The wind wasn't favorable for sailing, so a steamer was arranged by the Sous Prefect to cross quickly. The breakfast was a grand affair with everyone cheering as Monsieur Teclier and the Barclays entered. The guests were eager to hear about the journey. Ralph and Percy were the center of attention. Ralph avoided revealing their military status to prevent unwanted attention. The lieutenant of Mobiles was sarcastic, but Ralph cleverly responded, causing laughter. The officer, feeling challenged by Ralph's confidence, restrained himself, noting Ralph's imposing presence despite his young age. The lieutenant ended the tension with forced laughter, acknowledging Ralph's boldness.|"['1.

Half an hour after reaching Orleans, Colonel Tempe and Ralph rode out on the north road with Tim Doyle and the colonel's orderly. The frost was sharp, but the afternoon was sunny. As they trotted along the busy road, Ralph wished Percy was there. Colonel Tempe reassured Ralph, saying Percy had already done his part in the war and needed a break. After three hours, they arrived at the village where General Chanzy was stationed. The French Sixteenth Corps faced the Germans at Guillonville, Terminiers, and Conier. It was dark when they reached the chateau where General Chanzy was reviewing maps. The general welcomed them warmly and introduced Captain Barclay, praising his past bravery.

Ralph quickly followed the command, feeling happy with his new leader. General Chanzy was a young but bald man who exuded confidence. He had a calm demeanor that made him seem older than he was. With a sharp gaze and few words, he grasped the essence of any matter instantly. His smile lit up his face. An orderly guided Ralph with a lantern across the yard, with Tim and Colonel Tempe's orderly close behind. The cavalry horses were huddled together for warmth, tied near the stables. Ralph entered a stable, illuminated by the lantern, where soldiers were either chatting or resting. Tim suggested making a fire, and after a discussion about dinner arrangements, they decided to dine with the general and keep the horses ready for any sudden need.|"[""1.

Captain Barclay received advice to study the map and familiarize himself with the positions of their forces. After studying the map for a couple of hours, Ralph went for a ride to explore the area. The next day, preparations were made for an attack, and Ralph was involved in delivering orders to the troops. During the battle, Ralph's horse was injured by a shell, but he managed to escape unhurt.

Please don't delay. I will recover soon, in five minutes. I'll ride Tim's horse and rejoin you. Tim will grab a musket and fight too. Colonel Tempe swiftly rode off. Ralph mounted Tim's horse and slowly headed to the village where gunfire persisted. The French had seized control, but the fighting continued. Darkness favored the French as they seized the villages by assault at half-past five. The chaotic scene included hand-to-hand combat, pleas for mercy, and clashes of steel. General Chanzy's staff tirelessly carried out orders. Ralph finally returned to Villepani and found Tim waiting at General Chanzy's cottage, concerned about food and drink.

Tim Doyle found a spot under a hedge for the tired horse to rest. He planned to split the hay for the horse's supper, then lie down with the rest to keep warm. Despite the cold, many soldiers stayed awake, struggling to keep warm with fires or by huddling together. The lack of supplies and mismanagement added to their misery. As dawn approached, news of the German advance brought relief from the monotony of hunger and cold. The soldiers, exhausted and hungry, faced the approaching battle. Despite the French holding their ground initially, the Germans advanced, and wavering was seen among the French regiments. General Chanzy, calmly smoking his cigars, decided to retreat. Ralph, the aide-de-camp, was tasked to convey the message to General Sonis to hold the line for half an hour before falling back to a new position. Ralph swiftly rode to deliver the message as General Sonis prepared the regiments for a charge.|['1.

The brave Papal Zouaves, a group of courageous men, earned great honor during the war. They fought with bravery and magnificence in battles like Orleans and Le Mans. Their uniform, gray with red trim, resembled that of French Zouaves. Inspired by their leader, they charged fearlessly at the Prussian infantry, facing heavy fire. Despite being unsupported, they pressed on until overwhelmed, losing many men. In the midst of the chaos, Ralph Barclay valiantly fought before being injured and losing consciousness.

Ralph focused all his energy on one arm, managing to free himself from being frozen to the ground by his own blood and that of his horse. Stiff and cold, he realized the cold had saved him by staunching his wound. After rubbing his arms to restore circulation, he saw his horse had shielded him from being trampled. Spotting lanterns in the distance, likely held by Germans, he feared capture. Determined to escape, he found warmth in brandy, put on a fur coat, and walked away. Hearing approaching horse hoofs, he readied his pistol and calmly continued. Ralph explained his injuries to a passing soldier and planned to seek refuge in a nearby cottage to hide from the chaos of battle.|"[""1.

The first time he saw the English surgeon, he shared his worry. The doctor offered to send a letter to the ambulance headquarters in Versailles. The letter would reach its destination in Dijon within four or five days. On January 2nd, a month after being wounded, Ralph left for Orleans in peasant attire. He had money from a reward in Paris. Ralph's wound was concealed, and he traveled to Orleans in a cart. The town looked desolate, with the bishop kept prisoner by the Prussians. Troops occupied homes, and the streets were filled with German soldiers and carts. Ralph saw a convoy halt near a bridge, and he approached a group of distressed peasants.

The war was not destined to end peacefully for the boys, as heavy gunfire erupted near Dijon on the 21st.

Positioned in the southwest, the Barclays' house overlooked the area where the fighting was taking place. The enemy forces had strategically placed themselves on the surrounding heights, bombarding various locations with artillery fire. Captain Barclay suspected that it was a diversion to distract attention from a potential attack on Bourbaki's forces.
