Grace suddenly stopped, thinking she heard a twig snap. To her surprise, a man emerged from the shadows a few yards behind her. He aimed at the Overland camp, then swiftly turned and fired at Grace.

"Miss Briggs expressed her impatience with a ""Humph!"" and a desire to reach the desert for a clear view. Grace was eager for news about the shots and the guide, Hi Lang, had been stealthily listening nearby. The guide, after keeping watch all night, advised Lieutenant Wingate to rest. The group had a restless night, fearing danger, but nothing happened. Grace woke early feeling strong. They had breakfast, and Grace found trail signs. Hi Lang shared that there were two men involved in the shooting. The guide discovered one had left, and he planned to search further. Grace rode her pony to lift spirits.

"""Pack up and depart!"" he commanded, gesturing to Ping Wing. ""Serve the food on our mess kits first. Trail the foothills, and we will catch up with you. I abandon it, folks. This enigma has to unravel itself. It's too overwhelming for me.""

""Don't fret, Mr. Lang. If the mysterious individual keeps bothering us, we will apprehend him eventually. I wish we knew why he is troubling us,"" said Grace. ""I would rather stay here until we decipher the mystery, but we must move on, and maybe he will tail us.""

Ping and his sluggish burros set off an hour before the group continued, and when they did, they ambled slowly through the foothills, where the terrain was relatively manageable. The guide assured they would reunite with Ping before nightfall, have a meal, then proceed at a gentler pace to find a suitable campsite for the night.

As dusk fell, they finally caught up with the Chinaman, who was perched on the back of a burro trying to urge it to quicken its pace, to no avail. The horses then took the lead, a move Hi Lang said would prompt the burros to hasten to keep up, yet it was a slower tempo than the Overland Riders were accustomed to.

Hippy watched in amazement as the Chinaman effortlessly lit a fire using green sagebrush. While the guide and Hippy secured the ponies and unpacked the burros, Hi assured them the burros were too lazy to wander off. Hi explained the shifting desert underground streams and the need to find water. Hippy marveled at the desert's ways while watering the animals. As Ping made a fire for supper, the camp lit up, revealing the tents and the ponies munching on sage. After warnings about tarantulas, the group settled in for the night, comforted by the breeze and the distant sounds of nature.

After breakfast, Ping cheerfully packed up the camp while Mr. Lang and Hippy readied the ponies for the journey. Hippy held a mysterious package, sparking curiosity among his companions. As they rode, the heat grew intense, causing Emma to complain bitterly. The landscape turned desolate, with ravens circling above and tarantulas scurrying away. At noon, they rested near a barren butte, unable to find shade. Water was scarce, but each animal received a small portion. Hippy unveiled a blue silk parasol, surprising the girls. Hi Lang remained unfazed by the hardships. Grace noticed his attentive demeanor. As they continued, the guide searched for water, eventually finding a limited supply. Meanwhile, a group of armed riders approached their camp, prompting caution from the guide.|"['1.

The group of friends found themselves in a tense situation. Hippy and his friends were prepared for trouble as they faced off against the desert riders. Grace Harlowe signaled for defense, and the girls were ready with their rifles. Hippy, despite being provoked, managed to disarm the leader of the desert riders without using violence. Lieutenant Wingate and Hi Lang also played their parts in subduing the attackers. Bullets flew, but the defenders aimed to disable rather than kill.

Hi Lang's accurate shot brought down a rider, leaving him stunned on the ground. The guide and the Overlanders swiftly armed themselves with rifles, anticipating the next move of the desert ruffians. Grace and Elfreda provided backup, ensuring the safety of their group. As the ruffians attempted to escape, the team's precise gunfire caused chaos among the bandits. The wounded were tended to with care and sent off on their horses. Despite the lack of information from the ruffians, the group remained vigilant.

The guide, Mr. Lang, watched the sky with concern, sensing an impending storm in the desert. As the Overland girls prepared for bed, he tended to the ponies, calming them as they grew restless. The group had just finished a lively supper, but now a thin mist obscured the once bright stars above. Mr. Lang knew the signs of an approaching storm all too well and warned Hippy to rest, preparing for what was to come. Despite the calm before the storm, an unseen danger lingered, one that no weapon could fend off. With a watchful eye, Mr. Lang hoped for a mild night, bracing for the desert's unpredictable nature.

The mist vanished from the sky, revealing the brilliant stars. To the west, a black cloud loomed on the horizon. Preparing for an impending storm, the group secured their equipment. As the sandstorm hit, blankets and equipment were swept away, causing panic. Emma Dean struggled, buried in sand, crying for help. The girls fought to stay above the sand, their faces stung by the abrasive particles. The men, hunkered down, waited for the storm to pass.

The Overland Riders mounted their horses and rode out to their designated positions, moving slowly across the desert. The shimmering heat waves and lack of wind made the journey challenging. Elfreda marveled at her companions' endurance in the scorching heat. Hi Lang, investigating a discovery by Emma Dean, found a dry water hole and quickly returned. The riders searched for water in vain, facing disappointment at every turn. Hi Lang shared a meager supply of water with the group, emphasizing the importance of finding water to survive. The group pressed on, hoping to find water at a tank ten miles away. Hippy's sudden shots signaled the discovery of water ahead, prompting a rush towards the precious resource.

As they set off, the mirage vanished, leaving the Overland Riders parched and disappointed. Throughout the afternoon, they scanned the desert for water in vain. But as night fell, a gentle breeze brought relief. Hi called for a break around ten o'clock, revealing a spot with sparse vegetation. He advised releasing the ponies to graze on the greenery. Ping was tasked with preparing a dry supper. The guide explained the desert's hidden resources, pointing out mesquite bushes with nutritious bean pods and the fruit of the giant cactus.

A tired man rode up to the group, desperate for water. Hippy helped him off his horse and gave him some much-needed refreshment. Ping cooked bacon, and the man ate hungrily.

Looking westward, the Overlanders were surprised to see the horseman who had been watching them had vanished. Grace informed Mr. Lang about finding water in a tank, apologizing for his wasted journey. Mr. Lang had heard their signal shots an hour ago and found a tank for their next campsite. Hippy Wingate joked about the silent horseman, comparing him to desert lovers who prefer the quiet of nature. Mr. Lang explained that the desert makes people feel small, leading them to listen for familiar sounds.

Grace nodded in agreement with Mr. Lang's insights about skunks and snakes, feeling secure enough to sleep peacefully. The next morning, Hi Lang, the guide, rode out early to investigate the mysterious horseman's trail. He carefully examined the hoof-prints and other signs, hinting at possible trouble ahead. Grace, after enjoying the fresh morning air, pondered Hi's intelligence and hidden depths. The group continued their journey, with Hi's keen eyes scanning for any signs of the mysterious horseman. As they grew accustomed to the desert hardships, they found joy in the adventure. Despite occasional water shortages, they trusted Hi to lead them to safety.

Hi Lang mentioned that he suspected someone was watching them, based on the hoof-prints left by a fellow who had left the range after a shooting incident. Grace, on the other hand, was diligently practicing with her lasso, making progress in roping a pony. The group planned to rest in the mountains to cool off before deciding whether to venture into the Colorado Desert. The Overland Riders set out the next day, stopping for tea and biscuits at noon and searching for a water hole. As night fell, they found a tank and set up camp.

Miss Briggs volunteered that she recognized the box, similar to hers but weathered from sand and elements. Hippy, carrying it, piqued the Overland party's interest. Lieutenant Wingate delayed opening it, discussing the weather. The guide emphasized the desert's open property and the duty to open it, possibly holding a traveler's last wish. Hippy found a gold watch, gold coins, and a paper inside. Grace uncovered a map wrapped in protective paper, revealing a mystery. Nora admired Hippy's find, suggesting medals for such discoveries.

Mr. Lang wants to investigate if someone has been in the area. Grace warned the group not to disturb any possible tracks. Hi Lang disappeared into a water hole briefly, then emerged looking serious. He explained that the water had been tampered with by the previous party, causing it to seep away. Hi Lang suspected three men, including one who had been following them.

"""Hurry up!"" Hippy said and stood. It was now very dark, and Lieutenant Wingate stumbled over tent stakes and ropes as he walked around clumsily.
