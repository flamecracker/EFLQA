Mr. Laud Cavendish boarded the sail-boat, raised the sails, and pushed it into deep water with an oar. Captain Patterdale pondered over Laud's actions, unsure if Laud had noticed the tin box in the room. If Laud hadn't seen it, then he hadn't. If he had, Laud displayed more cunning and self-control than the captain had credited him. Captain Patterdale observed the departing boats, still contemplating Laud's connection to the tin box. Convinced that Laud wouldn't leave the box behind if he had stolen it, the captain leaned towards acquitting him. He suspected Hasbrook of taking the box in disappointment. As the Sea Foam yacht docked, Donald and Samuel Rodman, a wealthy classmate, were on board. The captain inspected the yacht, satisfied with its quality. Mr. Ramsay, the builder, crafted the yacht meticulously, utilizing every inch efficiently.

Donald sat in the standing-room, holding the tiller with his right hand. He noticed three other sloop yachts coming down the bay - the Skylark, Christabel, and a new arrival from Newport. Excited, he let off his sheet and joined the little fleet. Some from the tender boarded the Sea Foam, while the boats headed to Turtle Head. Gus mentioned the new yacht was the Phantom, bought by Joe Guilford's father. The friends discussed starting a Yacht Club and the measurer's role. Gus encouraged Donald to join, mentioning the need for funds for prizes. As they sailed, the Christabel led, the Sea Foam caught up, and the Skylark improved its position with some adjustments.

Mr. Laud Cavendish knew Donald wouldn't spend Sunday boating or fishing, so he didn't ask for his company. The Sea Foam quickly outpaced the Skylark, leaving Robert Montague slightly irritated.

They decided to form the Belfast Yacht Club, electing officers like Commodore and Vice-Commodore. The club planned a review and excursion for the following Saturday.

The young man entered the cottage where his father lay in pain. The doctors, his mother, and sister were trying to help, but the suffering was intense. Donald, the son, held his father's cold hand as he endured the agony. The physicians needed more chloroform, and Donald rushed to get it. Sadly, by the time he returned, his father had passed away. The family, overcome with grief, found it hard to cope. The neighbors and the minister offered comfort, but the reality of their loss was harsh.

Donald, still grieving for his father, who had been his constant companion in the cottage and the shop, found it hard to think about the future until his mother spoke to him. He remembered his father's last words urging him to care for his mother and sister, but it wasn't until his mother spoke that he truly understood their significance. With his father's memory close to his heart, a strong resolution grew within him. Donald wept as he thought of his father's guidance in study, work, and play. Inspired by the idea of continuing his father's shipbuilding business, he made plans to build a boat like the Sea Foam.

After breakfast, he set sail on his father's boat towards Turtle Head. He had gathered clams in the morning, planning to catch fish after the club meeting.

The captain sailed away from the boat, steering towards the bay to avoid Laud Cavendish, who was about a mile away, probably at Searsport. Donald, bewildered by the strange behavior of his recent passenger, weighed the anchor of the Juno and headed for Turtle Head. He was perplexed by the captain's actions, leading him to believe the captain might be insane. Despite this, Donald now found himself in possession of the Juno. As the boat sped through the water, Donald's thoughts were preoccupied with the events of the morning. The captain had paid him sixty dollars for a service rendered, which left Donald questioning the reason behind the payment. Reflecting on the captain's generosity towards others, Donald was certain the money was rightfully his.

Donald sailed the Juno around Turtle Head and anchored her. He inspected the boat, resisting the urge to keep it for himself. The yacht fleet approached, preparing for a regatta. Donald discussed boat models with Samuel. The club gathered to plan the race, open to yachts over twenty feet. The course was set from Belfast harbor to Stubb's Point Ledge and back. Donald measured the yachts. Dinner was served on board, and Donald was hosted on the Skylark. The fleet later sailed around Long Island. Donald discussed building the Maud with Mr. Rodman. Mr. Rodman, though cautious, supported Donald's endeavor and hoped for his success.|"['1.

Donald was on his way to Captain Shivernock's house, feeling pleased about his successful meeting with Mr. Rodman. Passing by the book and periodical store, he noticed Lawrence Kennedy, a skilled ship carpenter who was currently unemployed and considering seeking work in Bath. Donald thought of offering Kennedy a job as he was a talented worker. Wondering about Captain Shivernock's connections with Hasbrook, Donald pondered over the captain's suspicious movements. He was unsure if the captain could have been involved in a crime due to his secretive behavior. Donald decided to investigate further, determined to uncover the truth even if it meant facing danger.

"""He planned to return tonight if the wind helped him. He sailed to Vinal Haven early today, and as you know about sailing, can you say if he will be back tonight?"" Mrs. Sykes said. Donald realized Captain Shivernock had no part in the Lincolnville incident. The captain then entered, eyeing Donald suspiciously. He warned Donald not to speak of it or face consequences. Moving to a room with a writing desk, the captain wrote a bill of sale for the Juno with forceful, hard-to-read characters. The strange man interjected, calling it nonsense.

"The captain rudely replied, ""None of your business!"" when questioned by the young man. He warned him not to pry into his affairs and to focus on his own matters. Captain Shivernock's actions left Donald puzzled. Although Donald couldn't understand why the captain had given him the Juno and sixty dollars, he decided to focus on his business plans. Donald shared his encounter with Mr. Rodman with his mother, who was uplifted by the conversation. Donald felt conflicted about keeping the money from his mother but decided not to disclose the captain's secret. He tried to concentrate on his Sunday School lessons, sermons, and good books, but thoughts of the captain and the Maud lingered. Donald prepared to start building the yacht at his father's shop with the help of Lawrence Kennedy. Together they selected the timber needed for the frame, and by the end of the day, they had laid down the keelson and began setting up the stern-post and stem-piece.

After dinner, Donald decided to study in the shop instead of working. While pondering his work, he noticed Laud Cavendish sailing towards his boat, the Juno. Laud was interested in buying the boat, and Donald was open to selling it. Donald had considered keeping the Juno for himself as he had not paid for it, but he realized it would consume his time and money. He resolved to sell it to avoid distraction. When Donald rowed over to the Juno to meet Laud, he realized he couldn't sell it directly due to his ties with Captain Shivernock. Donald contemplated how Laud could afford the boat. Laud explained that the captain had provided the money. Donald accepted the payment but was puzzled by the captain's extravagant spending. He wondered about the captain's motives and the connection to recent events. Despite his concerns, Donald decided to use the money for his yacht project.|"['1.

"The next morning, Kennedy arrived with the man he was authorized to hire, and work began in the shop. Donald paid for the stock he bought promptly at noon. The lumber dealer offered him credit, but Donald insisted on paying cash for the lowest prices. He diligently recorded his expenses in his father's account book. The frame of the yacht started taking shape as the stem-piece and stern-post were set up. On Saturday, Mr. Rodman and a ship-builder friend inspected the work and praised Donald's progress.

Donald was pleased and went inside to get ready for the regatta. He quickly dressed and strolled towards the skiff that would take him to the sailboat. The sky was cloudy, and a strong wind promised an exciting race. The Juno, set for the regatta, was still anchored near the shop. Donald wondered where Laud, who was enthusiastic about the event, was. Before Donald could board, the new owner of Juno showed up. He was dressed to the nines, looking more like a fancy gentleman than a sailor. Donald's crew members were busy, and Laud noticed a young lady walking towards the city. A gust of wind blew her hat away, and Laud, trying to impress her, chased and retrieved it. The lady turned out to be Miss Nellie Patterdale, and Laud tried to charm her. Nellie wanted to attend the race and asked Donald to take her to the Penobscot in his boat. Laud eagerly rowed Nellie to Juno, where she boarded. Donald, excited to have Nellie on board, nearly crashed the boat while assisting her. As the race preparations began, the yachts lined up, and the first gun signaled the start.

During the yacht race, the crowd watched as the Skylark quickly took the lead with Commodore Montague's expert sailing. The judges observed from their yacht as the boats raced beyond Turtle Head. Each yacht had to pass the Penobscot to report their time accurately. The Skylark led the fleet, followed by the Sea Foam, Phantom, and Christabel. The Sea Foam faced challenges with her jib down-haul and swamped tender. The Skylark excelled, with Montague's skill evident in the distance between the yachts. The race was thrilling, with the Skylark maintaining its lead as it rounded the Penobscot. The Sea Foam followed suit, with the Phantom and Christabel close behind.

When the Skylark turned around the buoy and set course for Turtle Head, it was trailing behind the Sea Foam. Donald focused on adjusting the sails and steering, determined to catch up. As they rounded Turtle Head, the wind pushed the yacht forward. The skipper carefully positioned the crew to maintain balance. Both yachts battled the strengthening wind and waves as they raced towards the finish line. Despite a rain shower and a gust of wind, the Sea Foam crossed first, followed by the Skylark. The judges calculated the final results, accounting for the yachts' lengths. The Sea Foam emerged as the victor, but the commodore questioned if it was truly the faster boat.

Kennedy arrived in a small boat with a line to pull the Maud to the dock. Spectators boarded and admired the yacht, some suggesting improvements like a longer cabin or a different rig. Despite minor critiques, everyone agreed the Maud was a beautiful vessel. To celebrate, a gathering was held at Mr. Rodman's house for the Yacht Club members and others. Laud Cavendish, not a club member, joined in too. Donald was troubled by Laud's mention of inquiries about an incident, fearing he might be questioned by Hasbrook. Donald was hesitant to reveal details about a meeting he had, not wanting to betray Captain Shivernock's trust.

"""Don John, you are a true lion,"" giggled Nellie Patterdale, as the boat-builder finally sat beside her, his goal since arriving. ""You're too late,"" teased Laud Cavendish, nearby. ""I've already ordered to rename Juno, as I dislike the current name."" Nellie blushed in anger at Laud's audacity. Mr. Rodman called everyone for a meal. Donald stayed by Nellie, lacking the courage to offer his arm. Laud saw Nellie as his key to fortune. He felt Donald was in his way. ""Why interfere, Don John?"" Laud whispered angrily. ""I can win her over."" He believed Donald was too young to understand. ""You should focus on Maud Rodman,"" Laud hinted. ""You weren't invited,"" Mr. Rodman pointed out. The feast was lavish.

Donald went back to his room in the cottage and retrieved the money Laud Cavendish had paid him for the Juno. He had concerns about using this money to pay the sail-maker, fearing it might lead to trouble with Captain Shivernock or Laud. However, he decided to use the money to settle the bill. Donald handed three fifty-dollar bills to the sail-maker, Leach, who carefully examined them. One bill had been torn and mended with strips of paper, resembling the flag of Denmark. Leach was content as he left the shop, ready to pay the interest on his mortgage. He went to Captain Patterdale's mansion to settle the debt.

The sail-maker received eighty dollars and left the library content. Captain Patterdale was intrigued by a bill with a white cross, linking it to a possible criminal act.

Before the ship set sail, the deck was cleaned, but near the wharf, shavings littered the side. A basket with shavings was left half full.

Donald was relieved to be able to reassure his worried mother and sister of his innocence in the crime he was accused of. The Sea Foam yacht set sail with the light wind, reaching Turtle Head by midnight. The sheriff, carrying a lantern and shovel, led the party ashore to investigate a disturbance in the earth caused by Laud's clam-digger. After digging to a rock without finding the tin box, Mr. Beardsley pointed out the different layers of dirt, suggesting the box had been there before. The party returned to the city, and Donald went to bed early to rest before the big day. Meanwhile, Mr. Beardsley, driven by his theory, stayed up all night, determined to prove the truth behind the case. Accompanied by Jacob Hasbrook, he revisited the scene of the crime in Northport, aiming to vindicate his reputation as a detective.|"['1.

"""We will soon see how stiff she is,"" said Donald as a strong gust tilted the yacht, causing it to dip its rail into the water. The Maud sailed past the judges' yacht and anchored in position.

"For a brief moment, everyone on board stayed silent, their eyes fixed on the thrilling race unfolding before them.
