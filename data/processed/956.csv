Queen Ann of Oogaboo had a bold plan to conquer the peaceful Land of Oz. She believed that with her small army of eighteen men, she could overthrow Ozma, the gentle ruler of Oz. Ann's army consisted of various men named Jo, each appointed to different ranks like Generals, Colonels, Majors, and Captains. However, when it came to the last man, Jo Files, he was more interested in his book-trees than joining the army. Despite Jo Candy's refusal to join due to his candy crop, Queen Ann was determined to carry out her conquest.

Files generously shared his books with anyone interested, but the people of Oogaboo showed little interest in reading. He had to read most of the books himself before they deteriorated. Books from trees would lose their words and wilt once read. When Queen Ann spoke to Files, he expressed his ambition to conquer the world but insisted on being a Private due to his superiority. Private soldiers do the fighting, and officers need someone to command. Files aimed to become a hero by battling enemies. The army assembled, with officers in splendid uniforms and the Private armed with a gun from a special tree. Queen Ann, in her majestic uniform, led the army to conquer the world, promising riches and fame upon their return.|"['1.

Princess Ozma was unaware of Queen Ann Soforth's plan to conquer her kingdom with the Army of Oogaboo. Glinda the Good, the Official Sorceress of the Land of Oz, was the one who guarded the peace and happiness of the kingdom. Using her magic Record Book, Glinda discovered Ann's intentions. Instead of informing Ozma, Glinda cast a spell that led Ann's army astray into a different territory, far from Oz. Confused and lost, the Oogaboo army found themselves in a barren land. Queen Ann's temper worsened as hunger and disappointment set in among her officers. However, the Private Soldier, Files, remained cheerful and even warned them of a possible encounter with a dangerous beast called a Rak.

"Private Files shouted, ""The Rak!"" The officers fell to the ground in agony. Queen Ann, showing courage, faced the dark cloud. Files loaded his gun to fight the foe. The cloud was pitch black, but two red eyes appeared, identified as the monster's. Bullets from Oogaboo hit the Rak, causing it to fall on the officers. The Rak complained of broken jaw, wing, and leg. It threatened to eat them once healed. Files refused, bound by his promise to Queen Ann. Files led the Queen away from the Rak.

In the knapsack, Files carried a flag with Oogaboo's royal emblem, signifying their conquest. Ann felt proud seeing it flutter, deeming herself a famous conqueror. Amidst a storm, the ship hit a rock, tossing Betsy and Hank overboard. Betsy, grabbing Hank's tail, soon found a makeshift raft from wreckage. The storm raged on, but the raft kept them afloat. As dawn broke, they reached a greenhouse filled with roses bearing the faces of lovely girls. They were startled by a man in a rose-colored outfit, seeking refuge and food.

The Royal Gardener was startled to see strangers in his greenhouse. When Hank brayed loudly, the Gardener threw a watering pot at the mule and danced around in agitation, eventually falling over. A crash interrupted their conversation as a shaggy man fell through the roof, holding an apple. The Gardener, consulting a book, declared that strangers in the Rose Kingdom were to be put to death. However, Hank intervened by kicking the Gardener away. The shaggy man revealed that he was on a quest to find his missing brother, who disappeared while mining for gold.

"""No, indeed,"" said Polychrome, the Rainbow's Daughter, as the group of wanderers journeyed through the rocky trail. The Nome King, also known as Ruggedo, dwells beneath the earth's surface, beyond the reach of rainbows. Despite the challenges he has caused mortals and fairies, the wanderers found hope in their quest. The path led them to a camp by a brook, where they rested and gathered fruits.

The Shaggy Man revealed a surprising discovery to Betsy by unveiling a copper man from a bundle. This mechanical marvel, named Tik-Tok, was from the Land of Oz and possessed remarkable abilities. By winding different parts of Tik-Tok, he could think, speak, and move. However, getting Tik-Tok to stand upright was a challenge, requiring assistance from the girls. Once balanced, Tik-Tok shared his purpose of helping Shaggy find his brother, who was held captive by the Nome King. Despite Rug-ge-do's attempt to thwart Tik-Tok by throwing him down a well, the group's rescue mission brought Tik-Tok back to life.

"As Shaggy and his friends gathered together, the Army of Oogaboo approached. The soldiers' footsteps echoed on the path, occasionally interrupted by groans from officers stumbling on stones. Private Files emerged, carrying Oogaboo's banner. He planted it by a well and called out, ""I hope there's water!"" General Cone hesitated, spotting Tik-Tok and Shaggy, and fell to his knees in fear.

Shaggy was surprised by the Magnet's unexpected power, quickly hiding it in his pocket. The adventurers from Oogaboo became his friends, no longer talking about conquering. Shaggy proposed marching to the underground Kingdom of Ruggedo, explaining the need to conquer all lands. He highlighted the riches owned by Ruggedo, suggesting that defeating him would bring immense wealth. The Queen expressed concerns about her army's lack of fighting skills, but Colonel Plum suggested making the Clockwork Man the private soldier. Shaggy agreed, seeing Tik-Tok as the perfect fit due to his invulnerability. They pondered how to reach Tik-Tok, examining the paths before them in the clearing, seeking the way forward.|"[""1.

The Princess observed the flowers closely, noting the white daisies, golden buttercups, bluebells, and daffodils that lined the roadside. Among them were scattered wild roses that seemed to give her courage to ask an important question. The adventurers' path meandered through hills and valleys, seemingly aimless but drawing closer to a range of mountains. Files believed the entrance to Ruggedo's cavern lay among these rugged hills, a correct assumption. Deep beneath the nearest mountain lay a magnificent chamber adorned with jewels where the Nome King resided. Despite his wealth and power over metals and precious stones, Ruggedo was surly and unhappy due to mortals keeping treasure above ground. The King's gong echoed through the vast cavern, causing fear among the nomes working tirelessly within. Kaliko, the King's servant, used a magic spyglass to view approaching visitors, including a copper man and a fairy, raising concerns about potential dangers. As the group continued on their journey, they unknowingly traversed a Rubber Country, where everything, including the rocks and trees, was made of rubber. Upon reaching a brook with stepping-stones, Tik-Tok, Queen Ann, Betsy Bobbin, Hank, Polychrome, Shaggy, the Rose Princess, and Files crossed the water, with Tik-Tok confidently leading the way.|"['1.

The outcome was amazing. Initially, Tik-Tok sank into the soft rubber, which then bounced him up high in the air, where he performed a series of somersaults and landed on a rubber rock far behind the group. General Apple, unaware of Tik-Tok's bounce, stepped on the stone connected to Kaliko's magnetic rubber wire and shot up like an arrow. General Cone faced a similar fate. As the others noticed the strange events, they stopped and looked back. Tik-Tok continued to bounce from one rubber rock to another, gradually losing height. General Apple and General Cone also struggled with the bouncing rocks. Betsy and Polychrome found amusement in the situation, while Queen Ann grew frustrated with her officers' undignified behavior.

"The gnome nodded and twitched his ears, listening intently. After a moment of silence, he finally spoke. ""The invaders will struggle to find the Metal Forest,"" announced the King, pleased by the news. ""But what else do these strangers seek?"" he inquired. The gnome hesitated before revealing, ""The Army of Oogaboo plans to seize all your riches and jewels."" Enraged, the King lunged at the gnome, but his Chamberlain intervened, leading to a comical chase around the throne. Seizing the moment, the gnome slipped away, leaving the King fuming.

When they first tumbled into the Tube, everyone was too dazed to think clearly. The journey was long, leading straight through the earth to a place opposite the Nome King's dominions. As the adventurers traveled, they began to recover their wits. Polychrome marveled at the odd experience of journeying through the earth when her home was in the skies. They conversed, trying to cheer each other up despite the swift fall through the Tube. Files and Ozga reassured each other while falling. After what seemed like an eternity, Tik-Tok popped out into daylight, followed by Queen Ann and the Peculiar Person. The group found themselves in a beautiful garden opposite their starting point. The Peculiar Person suggested taking them to the Private Citizen, causing a stir among the group.

All the residents warmly greeted the newcomers, especially showing affection towards the Queen of Light. They fluttered around her as she led the way to her regal drawing-room, richly furnished in various tints. Betsy and Polychrome enjoyed resting on the downy divans after their adventures. The Queen chatted with her guests, while Daylight sat beside Erma. The other maidens sat modestly in another part of the room. The Queen shared about their land, ruled by Tititi-Hoochoo, a fair and just ruler without a heart but possessing reason and justice. The Original Dragon, the oldest and wisest living creature, resided there, providing wisdom. The residents wore the dragon emblem, symbolizing their right to inhabit the land. Polychrome, being a fairy, asked about the Kings and Queens of the land. The room filled with peace as Starlight and Firelight joined them. The Queen led them to a banquet hall where they were served their favorite foods. Polychrome had dewdrops, and Betsy enjoyed a lavish dinner. The Queen explained that electricity was part of the world since its creation, making Electra as old and beneficent as Daylight and Moonlight.|['1.

Quox, a young dragon lacking wisdom, disrespected the Original Dragon. The King selected Quox for vengeance, sending him with the group to punish Ruggedo. As they prepared to journey through the Tube, Queen Ann felt uneasy about their failure to conquer Tititi-Hoochoo.

The Rainbow's Daughter suggested letting Tik-Tok try, adding that if he failed, they could rely on the fire-breathing dragon. Meanwhile, Ruggedo, the Metal Monarch, struggled to find amusement in his jeweled cavern as all the nomes behaved well. Despite throwing his sceptre at Kaliko without hitting him, Ruggedo forgave him for not standing still. The King knew Kaliko's intelligence and obedience were unmatched. The nomes, under Kaliko's guidance, worked diligently, causing Ruggedo to grow bored. Seeking news from the surface world, Ruggedo summoned the Long-Eared Hearer, who informed him about the return of their visitors. The mention of eggs made everyone shudder, as eggs were feared by the nomes.

Ruggedo, the Nome King, was furious and ready to summon his army of nomes to drive out the invaders. He even threatened to harm them with needles. In a fit of rage, he threw his sceptre at Kaliko, narrowly missing him. Unfortunately, the sceptre broke off the tip of the Hearer's ear, causing him to yell in pain. Despite the accident, Ruggedo ordered General Guph and the nomes to be armed and prepared to capture the travelers as they emerged from the Tube. The journey through the Tube was comfortable, and the friends even befriended Quox, the dragon, who proved to be a valuable companion.

The nomes had gathered around the Tube to capture the invaders led by General Guph. However, the dragon emerged unexpectedly, shielding the strangers from the nome's spears with its large body. Queen Ann ordered her Army of Oogaboo, mainly Tik-Tok, to march forward. The nomes fled underground when Tik-Tok stumbled, demanding to be picked up. Realizing they needed to enter the nome's Kingdom, a council of war was called. The dragon, unconcerned, offered to wait.

The officers, including Generals, Colonels, Majors, and Captains, lined up with their swords drawn, commanding Tik-Tok to march. Despite stumbling twice on rough rocks, he managed better on a smooth path. Tik-Tok confidently led them into a cavern, followed by the officers and Queen Ann. Unaware of the danger, they fell into a pit, becoming prisoners of the Nome King. The King ordered Tik-Tok to work in the gold mines. Meanwhile, Betsy rode in on Hank the mule, unimpressed by the delay in conquering. Hungry and unafraid, she stood her ground against the Nome King's threats.

Betsy followed Kaliko into a cozy cavern furnished with care. He brought a tray of broiled mushrooms, mineral bread, and petroleum-butter.

The King was delighted with the solution to the problem. He ordered nomes with ropes to capture Shaggy. Polychrome expressed concern for Betsy and Hank, mortal beings without magic powers. As Shaggy entered the passage, ropes bound him, and nomes led him to the cavern. Files and the Princess followed to rescue him. Polychrome, seeing trouble, ran back and found Quox asleep.

Ruggedo expressed his fondness for Polychrome, offering her a luxurious life in his cavern. He proposed making her the queen of his nomes and granting her freedom to pull Kaliko's nose whenever she pleased. Polychrome, however, declined the offer, stating her home was in the sky. She questioned Ruggedo about her friends being bound with cords and chains. Ruggedo admitted his hatred towards them and his intent to make them suffer for invading his kingdom. He then proposed a deal to Polychrome, offering to set her friends free if she agreed to stay with him in exchange for various familial roles. Despite Ruggedo's attempts to capture her with the help of General Guph, Polychrome evaded them effortlessly, laughing merrily. Ruggedo then ordered the torture of the Army of Oogaboo and their Queen, as well as the search for escaped prisoners. Kaliko and his nomes were tasked with finding the escaped prisoners, with the threat of torture looming over them if they failed.|"[""1.

Kaliko objected to the King's plan to destroy Tik-Tok, emphasizing the machine's uniqueness. The King threatened to turn Kaliko into a potato if he persisted. The King then turned his attention to the Shaggy Man, intending to transform him into a dove using magic. Despite the warning not to attempt the transformation, the King successfully turned the Shaggy Man into a dove. The dove landed on the Rose Princess, who freed it. Meanwhile, Polychrome rushed to awaken Quox, a dragon, to save her friends from the King's schemes. Quox was captured by the King's chain, preventing him from reaching the King.

Quox declared that the King had lost his magical abilities due to an enchanted ribbon. Despite Ruggedo's disbelief, he couldn't transform Files into a fiddle bow as he couldn't remember the magic words. Quox informed Ruggedo that he must leave the Kingdom and wander the earth without a home or riches, only allowed to carry what fits in his pockets. Ruggedo defied the orders, but Quox opened a locket that caused panic among the nomes, leading them to flee and lock the door. Eggs rolled out of the locket, causing Ruggedo to panic and try to escape. Despite trying to throw objects at the eggs, they continued to roll towards him. Ruggedo leaped over them and ran towards the passage, where the chained dragon awaited.|"['1.

Ruggedo acted quickly out of fear. He jumped onto the dragon's nose and then squeezed through to its back, sliding along its scales to its tail. In a panic, he ran down the mountain path but stumbled and fell. Realizing he was banished from his kingdom by the Jinjin's decree, he attempted a magical charm to destroy the dragon eggs, but his powers had been taken away. Frustrated, he threw rocks at the eggs to no avail. Meanwhile, the dove witnessed everything and flew to the dragon, transforming Shaggy back to his original form. Quox freed himself from his chains and Kaliko, surprised by the turn of events, humbly approached the dragon. Betsy, Hank, and the Royal Chamberlain returned, relieved by the outcome.|"[""1.

Kaliko, the new King, decided to seek the secret passages to the Metal Forest. He summoned his chief nomes to assist in the search. Guph, now the Royal Chamberlain, was glad to be rid of the previous hard master, Ruggedo. Kaliko, wearing Ruggedo's crown, instructed the nomes to find the hidden ways. Meanwhile, Quox, the dragon, bid farewell to the group as his mission was complete. He slid into a hole, heading back home. The friends thanked Quox and the Jinjin for their help in defeating Ruggedo. The nomes searched for the missing Oogaboo officers but found no trace.

They felt like they had lost a friend, the dragon, kind and sociable during their brief acquaintance. But they knew he had to return home. Back in the caverns, they searched for hidden passages to the forest for three days with no luck. Polychrome longed to rejoin her sisters in the sky palaces, watching for her father, the Rainbow. On the third day, she saw Ruggedo creeping up the mountain, looking forlorn and unkempt. Knowing he must accept his fate, he regretted not filling his pockets with riches. Seeking help from a poor woman, she sewed more pockets on his robe in exchange for a diamond ring. Ruggedo discovered a hidden passageway and entered, unaware Polychrome had seen. She informed her friends, and they decided to throw Ruggedo out but allowed him to take as much treasure as he could fit in his newly expanded pockets. They walked through the passage, and upon reaching the Metal Forest, they were in awe of the beauty and riches it held.|"['1.

Kaliko assured Betsy that they didn't have to stay in the Metal Forest as it was only a part of the cavern. They decided to head towards the real trees with delicious fruits hoping to find Shaggy's brother there. Suddenly, they heard a scream and saw Ruggedo being captured by Queen Ann's officers from Oogaboo. The officers, along with Queen Ann, looked worn out and tattered from their journey through the tunnel. Despite their hardships, they had managed to capture Ruggedo. However, they were still trapped in the dome filled with treasures. Eventually, they learned that Ruggedo was no longer the ruler and had been replaced by Kaliko. Ruggedo, now a prisoner, began collecting jewels with the help of Betsy, Polychrome, and the Rose Princess.|"[""1.

In a cavern filled with precious stones, Ruggedo, a degraded King, left the young ladies without a word of thanks. As he departed, the jewels he took barely made a dent in the vast collection. Among golden trees, Ann and Kaliko found a hut where a prisoner hid. The man explained how Ruggedo had enchanted him, turning him ugly and causing ridicule among the nomes. The group rested in silence, with Polychrome dancing, Files and the Princess strolling, and Tik-Tok standing still. Shaggy's brother wore a polka-dotted handkerchief to hide his face, dressed in worn clothes after years of imprisonment. Despite his appearance, Betsy felt sympathy for the man's plight.|"['1.

Ugly expressed his fear of returning to the world with his dreadful face. He found solace in the natural forest near the artificial one, where he discovered the unique 'Hotel Trees' bearing 'Three-Course Nuts' that served as a complete meal. These nuts were a luxury even better than the finest hotel. Betsy shared a story about a boy longing for measles, showing that what we desire may not always be good for us. Shaggy noted that moderation is key, as too much of a good thing can diminish its value.

As they walked through the Metal Forest back to where they had entered the cave, Shaggy and his brother were happy to be reunited. Betsy, holding Hank's ear, refrained from laughing at the polka dot handkerchief. King Kaliko allowed the officers to collect diamonds. They followed a trail of jewels, leading to old Ruggedo who had scattered them. Ruggedo, tired and defeated, shared that he no longer desired wealth. Shaggy's brother, startling Ruggedo, was revealed. The group decided to help break the charm that made him ugly. Betsy proposed a plan to kiss him in the dark.

Every day, Ozma and the Wizard observed the events through a magical frame that displayed moving images of the encounters. They witnessed the journey from the moment Shaggy encountered Betsy and Hank in the Rose Kingdom. As they watched Queen Ann's struggles to conquer the world, Ozma decided that the Queen had endured enough. Ozma, with the Wizard's help, magically transported the Queen, her officers, and Files back to Oogaboo. Startled, the group in the Nome King's cavern was amazed to see the Queen and her people vanish. Shaggy, realizing that Ozma was involved, used a wireless telephone to communicate with her. He expressed his gratitude and informed Ozma that his mission was complete. He requested that Tik-Tok be returned to the Land of Oz.

Ozma, the Ruler of Oz, listened with regret as the Shaggy Man expressed his concerns. She placed a small device on her table, ending their conversation. Meanwhile, she observed a magical picture with a pensive look. Nearby, the Wizard of Oz smiled to himself. Ozma, puzzled, expressed her uncertainty about the end of their adventures.
