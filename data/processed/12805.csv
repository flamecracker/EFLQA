At that moment, Nicolas let go and fell face-first, seeming to abandon hope of defeating Ivan and now focusing on defense. Ivan was too late to stop Nicolas from turning over, but he quickly grabbed his shoulders, planted his feet, and with a mighty effort, lifted Nicolas to his feet. This display of strength amazed Stubbs, a keen observer. Nicolas then swiftly turned and landed a powerful punch on Ivan's chin, causing Ivan to stagger back. As Nicolas pursued him, Ivan regained composure, delivering strong blows. Despite a wild swing from Nicolas leaving him vulnerable, Ivan managed to counter effectively. Both men, unskilled in combat, traded clumsy blows, with it becoming clear that endurance and power would determine the winner. Ivan endured hits but showed no sign of giving up. The fight continued with both men landing blows until an opening appeared that Hal and Chester recognized as a chance to strike.|"['1.

Beyond the enemy, Hal and Chester led the way on their horses, knowing more were waiting in the barn. Shots rang out behind them, but none hit their mark. Anthony Stubbs raced ahead, with Hal and Chester slowing down. Suddenly, Nicolas snatched Hal's revolver and fired at him, but Hal was unharmed. Nicolas fell, and the group knew they had to flee. Pursuers closed in, but the friends fought back, causing the enemy to retreat. Colonel Edwards suggested Ivan go first, as his horse was slower.

The mountaineers were not willing to sit back and let the fugitives take charge. They quickly devised a plan, splitting into small groups and leaving their horses behind. Hal and Chester, hidden nearby, kept a close eye on the enemy's movements. Colonel Edwards suggested splitting up further to avoid being surrounded, ensuring they could catch the foes off guard. As they waited for the signal, a shot rang out, causing concern for all. Finally, the faint whistle signaled their retreat. The group swiftly mounted their horses and galloped away, with tears in Colonel Anderson's eyes for the fallen Colonel Edwards.

As they raced forward, Chester's horse stumbled and let out a cry of pain. Quickly, Chester halted the horse, dismounted, and rushed to its side. The horse held up one foot in distress. Chester noticed the pain in its eyes. Meanwhile, Hal, Colonel Anderson, and Nikol guided their horses with one hand, holding revolvers in the other. Chester clung to Hal with one hand and brandished a revolver with the other. They closed in on their unsuspecting foes, who were still in the same spot. Shots were exchanged, but the enemy's shots missed. Nikol took aim and brought down two foes with precise shots. The remaining enemies fled. Stubbs, reunited with his friends, expressed relief.

Stubbs and Chester observed the troops moving in different directions. In front, heavy guns were being positioned, and officers were organizing their men despite the apparent chaos. From the rear, squadrons of cavalry swiftly advanced, followed by infantry columns marching in a disciplined manner. The troops were preparing for a defensive stance against an anticipated enemy attack. The orderly accompanying them explained the strategic situation, revealing that the Montenegrin army was bracing for a battle along a vast front.

""You are now,"" said Helen, ""just across the Serbian border from Bulgaria. This house is the home of a friend of mine, Miss Thatcher, a Red Cross nurse. I met her in Belgrade where she was wounded. When it became evident that the Austrians were about to occupy the city, we came to the home of her friend here, a Serbian woman. That was before there was any talk of Bulgaria joining Germany.

""Why, I think so. Maybe there has been no declaration of war, but anyhow the Serbians and Bulgarians have been fighting across the frontier. That's why I was so afraid when you knocked at the door to-night.""

In the dark and silent house, Chester turned off the light when the enemy approached. He, Helen, Ivan, and Colonel Anderson were aware of the approaching Bulgarians through the windows.

Ivan emerged from hiding and fired at the approaching men, causing chaos. Despite a wound, Ivan stood his ground. Meanwhile, Helen and Chester had repelled the attackers at the windows.

She rushed off and returned shortly with the necessary items. She assisted Chester in cleaning the wound on the Colonel's head while Chester unwrapped the bandage. Together, they carefully dressed the wound. As the Colonel looked around, he identified Hal and Nikol among the group. The two of them were watching Ivan and Anthony Stubbs engaged in what seemed like a serious struggle. Chester observed the scene and noticed that Ivan and Stubbs were locked in a playful fight. Ivan, in a fit of rage, lifted Stubbs and tossed him away. Stubbs, a war correspondent, expressed his frustration at having to look after Hal and Chester due to their mischievous behavior.

""You sneaky fellow, so that's why you wanted to come ahead, isn't it?"" Chester decided to brush off the man's comments and shifted the conversation by introducing Hal and Nikol to Helen.

"Helen was upstairs gathering her belongings, while the others lingered in the living room. Suddenly, Hal rushed in, a look of concern on his face. The rest sprang up eagerly. ""It's true, Miss Ellison, but not exactly as Mr. Stubbs put it,"" Hal stated calmly. ""We're caught between two opposing forces. The Bulgarians are nearby and have taken my plane. The Serbians are advancing, likely leading to a battle, and we're right in the middle of it."" Hal added, ""For now, we're safe as the shells fly overhead.

The Bulgarian cavalry showed no sign of surrender despite victory being close. They fearlessly charged the Serbian infantry, fighting valiantly until many fell to enemy rifles and bayonets. The Serbians cheered briefly before the Bulgarians' massive artillery struck, causing the Serbians to falter and flee. The Bulgarian cavalry then charged again, cutting through the panicked Serbians mercilessly. The remaining Serbians retreated, battered and defeated. The Bulgarians chose not to pursue, content with the gained ground. Hal Paine, an American, along with his companions, had been aiding the wounded in Montenegro when they met Ivan Vergoff, an Albanian, who joined them.
