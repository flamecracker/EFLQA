Dr. Sandwith received a letter from a French nobleman who admired the independence and manners of English boys compared to French education. The nobleman proposed having an English boy as a companion for his sons to learn from. Dr. Sandwith considered his son Harry for this role, as he believed Harry might not excel in intellectual pursuits. The offer included generous financial compensation and the opportunity for cultural exchange.

Mrs. Sandwith's husband discussed with Harry and agreed that the opportunity to go to France was excellent. Initially concerned about Harry's diet, Mrs. Sandwith prepared his clothes for the trip.

Before leaving, Dr. Sandwith advised Harry to be open-minded and polite in France. Harry said goodbye to his friends and family, receiving advice from his father.

"As Harry entered the Lion door, the French gentleman, M. du Tillet, greeted him with a bow. Harry, unsure, mirrored the gesture. After exchanging smiles, M. du Tillet, with a scar on his cheek, offered Harry a seat in the salon. They were served a bowl of broth, which surprised Harry with its thin appearance but pleasant taste. As they dined on unfamiliar dishes, Harry pondered the difference in French cuisine compared to English fare. Despite the foreign flavors, he found some dishes to his liking. When offered wine, Harry declined and opted for water instead. Curious about the long piece of bread, he learned the French word for it, ""Pain.""

After a pleasant meal, M. du Tillet, Harry's guide, signaled for him to join a stroll through town. They explored the quays and fishing boats, with Harry eagerly learning the French names for everything he saw. The next day, they embarked on a post-wagon journey to Paris, where Harry marveled at the well-kept roads and flat countryside. Arriving at a grand gateway, they were greeted by a porter and entered a hall adorned with armor and arms. M. du Tillet welcomed Harry warmly, indicating that they would rest before joining the marquis's family at their chateau near Dijon.

The boy nodded and looked at his guide, indicating the items he needed. The guide understood and ordered four outfits: two for everyday wear, one for evenings, and another for special occasions. The coats were long and open at the front, too small to button up. Waistcoats were embroidered, and a white handkerchief with lace tied loosely around the neck completed the ensemble. Harry thought about the reaction back home if they saw him in these clothes. They measured Harry, and he tried to pay, but it seemed payment was not due until delivery. They then bought shirts with ruffles. After three days in Paris, Harry's clothes arrived. The next day, a carriage with the marquis's coat of arms fetched them. They traveled through changing landscapes and arrived at a grand chateau. Harry was greeted warmly by the family, although he struggled with the language.

Ernest, the French boy, was always exceedingly polite and courteous to his English companion, Harry, which Harry found a bit too much. Despite this, Ernest had many good qualities. He was generous with his money, always ready to help those in need. Harry was surprised to find that Ernest was clever, excelling in Latin far beyond him. Ernest's riding skills were exceptional, leaving Harry feeling inferior during their outings. However, Harry's determination to match Ernest's abilities pushed him to work harder. Harry quickly picked up French, impressing himself with his progress. The evenings were spent with dancing lessons, where Harry improved over time.

"Her father comforted her, ""Don't judge by looks,"" he said gently as she trembled. ""Older people often regret it. But I'm sure you didn't let him see you laughing, so no harm done.""

At present, all we can do is wait. Some deputies and nobles have fled France out of fear, abandoning the king. Although it's our duty to stand by him, we can't help if he won't accept it. The Assembly passing a law to confiscate emigrated estates is a positive step. The Marquise, alarmed by her husband's news, didn't question his decision, feeling safe in their quiet chateau. Despite the gloom hanging over noble families, they organized hunting parties to chase wolves in the forests. During one such hunt, Harry and Ernest were excited to participate. As they prepared, Harry expressed distrust towards Monsieur Lebat, the Mayor of Dijon's son, for his demeanor towards the Marquise. Harry's judgment wasn't based on social status but on character, illustrating his dislike for Monsieur Lebat's behavior.|"['1.

"The marquis and his hunting party were ready to track down the infamous demon wolf that had plagued the region for years. As they mounted their horses, the marquis, a seasoned hunter, signaled the start with his horn. The group set off towards the forest, where the woodmen had marked the wolf's usual haunts. Just as they were about to begin the hunt, a young forester rode up with news of the wolf's whereabouts.

Excitement filled the air as they learned that the demon wolf was in the forest. The marquis was determined to finally put an end to the wolf's reign of terror. The villagers believed the wolf to be a supernatural being, attributing all wolf-related tragedies to him. Despite numerous attempts to kill him, the demon wolf always managed to escape, earning a reputation for being bulletproof.

Ernest looked surprised when he learned that one of his family members might marry someone from a different social class.

The guardian believed that the man from a professional background would be a good protector for the family member due to the turbulent times they were living in.

As the sun began to rise, a group of men with torches and officials in red scarfs approached the house. Harry quickly led the girls, including Virginie who was crying, towards the garden. They escaped through a gate just before it was broken down. Hiding near the river, the girls were silent, still in shock from the night's events. Marie's thoughts were with her missing lover and her captured parents. She realized the English boy, Harry, was their only hope. Despite her initial doubts, she now trusted him to protect them.

Late in the evening, Harry couldn't leave early. After supper at a wineshop and a stroll on the Boulevards, he returned to the mansion. No lights, all quiet. The house was stripped bare.

The next morning, he hid the money, bought supplies, and avoided conversation to keep his disguise. He shared news with Mademoiselle Marie about her father and the Duc de Gisons.

Victor decided it was safer to stay in Paris than risk the dangerous journey to the frontier due to strict scrutiny on the roads. The city was in turmoil as arrests increased, and fear spread with the Prussian siege of Verdun. Danton incited terror against Royalists, leading to widespread arrests and conspiracy fears. As chaos loomed, a search for arms and suspects was ordered, prompting Victor and Harry to flee the city and hide in the woods. They feared for their imprisoned friends' safety and contemplated risky plans to rescue them. Despite the dangers, Harry prioritized protecting Mademoiselle de St. Caux and her sisters.

Harry and Jeanne discussed a plan to free their imprisoned friends. Harry suggested involving a fellow Royalist in their scheme. They debated which prisoner to target for release, weighing the characters of Danton, Robespierre, and Marat. Danton was seen as fierce and ambitious, while Robespierre was considered principled but ruthless. Marat, on the other hand, was described as venomous and hateful.

Harry and Victor decided to focus their attention on Marat. They planned to observe his habits and meet at their usual spot during dinner. Their goal was to follow Marat from the Assembly to the Jacobin Club and then to his home.

Harry and Victor, disguised as mechanics, prepared for their mission, also acquiring female attire for the Marquise. As tension mounted, the Assembly's power waned against the rising Commune.

"Victor and Harry were restless in the Assembly and decided to head to the Hotel de Ville. As they arrived, a group of Marseillais brought out twenty-four people, mostly priests, from the Maine prison, shouting, ""To the Abbaye!"" The ruffians forced the prisoners into coaches, threatening them with violence. The crowd remained silent, indifferent to the unfolding events. Victor and Harry protested against the Marseillais, but Harry urged Victor to stay calm for Marie's sake. They followed the coaches to the Abbaye, witnessing the brutal massacre of the prisoners. The violence displayed by the Marseillais caused shock among the onlookers, leading many to question the Revolution. The acts of tyranny by the Jacobins had turned even former supporters away, leaving the Revolution isolated. The crowd following the Marseillais consisted mainly of the most desperate and hostile individuals, incited by the bloodshed."|"['1.

Victor and Harry were horrified by the scenes unfolding before them at the monastery turned prison. The Marseillais, driven by bloodlust, murdered priests in cold blood. The Archbishop of Arles and other bishops were mercilessly slain. The Swiss officers, despised by the mob, were next. As they were brought out, the crowd cheered their gruesome deaths. Then, a makeshift tribunal sentenced prisoners to death without fair trial. Those acquitted were spared, while others met a brutal end at the hands of the bloodthirsty mob. Victor, pale and trembling, was frozen in shock, unable to tear his eyes away. Despite Harry's attempts to pull him away, Victor remained transfixed, his horror palpable. The violent events unraveled before them, leaving an indelible mark of terror and disbelief.|"['1.

After the first few prisoners were taken care of, a tall man was brought into the hall. Victor let out a loud cry, trying to rush forward in a frenzy, but Harry stopped him with a heavy blow. Victor fell to the ground. Harry explained that Victor had lost his mind due to drinking and hatred, preventing him from harming himself. The tall man, dressed as a mechanic, helped carry Victor outside. He reassured the crowd that Victor was unwell and needed fresh air. The mechanic commended Harry for his quick action.

After leaving Victor in the care of the man who helped him, Harry rushed towards the Abbaye but paused to decide whether to go there or head to the Bicetre. Unsure if his friends were at the Abbaye like the Duc de Gisons, he feared he couldn't help them if they were. The streets were empty, with fearful residents indoors due to the ongoing horrors. Despite hopes the Assembly would intervene, they remained silent. The city was in chaos, with the Commune openly orchestrating the massacre. Hearing the screams, Harry sought refuge in quiet streets. Desperate for a disguise, he bought a bonnet and shawl from a woman. Positioned near the Abbaye, he observed the crowd's movements.

At La Force, many women, including Princess de Lamballe, were imprisoned and suffered the same fate as the male prisoners, facing brutal attacks. The princess's head was severed and displayed on a pike, paraded under the windows of the Temple where the king and queen were held. Marie Antoinette, brave for herself, fainted at the ghastly sight. Meanwhile, Harry, filled with rage and helplessness, tried to intervene but was thwarted. He hoped to assist the marquise at Bicetre prison but was blocked by guards. The cruelty continued as prisoners were led out in groups for slaughter. Harry's attempts to enter were met with force, leading to his retreat and emotional outburst.

"""I'm worried that wouldn't work, Jeanne,"" Harry expressed with a faint smile, shaking his head. ""It was a risky plan for just the two of us.

Harry received an update from Elise about the plan to help Marie escape the prison. Elise had spoken to a woman who had agreed to seek help from her brother, who worked at the prison. The woman believed her brother wouldn't betray them. Elise was set to meet the woman the next morning, as she was going to the prison to sound out her brother. The woman shared that her brother was fond of money and dreamed of retiring to a farm in Brittany. Harry offered a reward of twenty louis for the woman and a hundred for her brother if they could get Marie out. Victor's condition remained critical, and the doctor prepared Harry for the possibility of Victor's recovery or demise. The next morning, Victor showed signs of improvement.

Harry expressed joy at the progress made, acknowledging the challenge ahead. The man's willingness to carry notes for their plan to secure a farm in Brittany fueled hope. After three days, Marie's response arrived. Victor, recovering from illness, showed signs of recognition but lacked full memory.

While Robespierre was speaking Harry had rapidly thought over the role which it would be best for him to adopt. Should he avow his real character and ask for an order for the liberation of Marie as a recompense for the service he had rendered Robespierre, or should he retain his present character and obtain Robespierre's confidence?

""We will talk more after supper,"" he said. ""My sister is, I see, ready with it. Indeed it is long past our usual hour, and we were just sitting down when I was called out by what purported to be an important message from the Club.""

""I know nothing about English politics,"" Harry replied with a smile; ""nor indeed about any politics.

Harry faced a challenging task when he realized securing Marie's release was harder than he thought. Robespierre's keen eye made sneaking the order past him impossible. However, Harry found some solace in discovering a list of prisoners for trial, which Robespierre signed without scrutiny.

Despite numerous interruptions from visitors, including important figures like Lebat, Harry managed to covertly save many from wrongful accusations by slipping warning notes to them. As February unfolded, Harry tirelessly worked alongside Robespierre, striving to maintain hope for Marie's release and visiting Victor, who battled memory loss.

During December, while the king was on trial, the royal family had a routine at the Temple. The princess royal wrote in her journal that her father would rise at seven for prayers, then have breakfast with her mother. Lessons followed until eleven, then they would walk until two, when they had lunch. After lunch, the parents played backgammon and talked. At four, the king napped, then gave lessons until supper at nine. The family then retired for the night. Despite their peaceful life, the Jacobins were set on taking their lives. The trial began in December, and on January 21st, the king was executed. France was shocked by the act, as the king had tried to reform without violence.

Robespierre calmly expressed his surprise at the request, explaining that the woman belonged to a race that had oppressed France for centuries. He believed it was better for them to perish altogether. Despite Harry's plea, Robespierre refused to interfere, as it would be seen as treason.

Harry quickly changed into his old blue outfit, concealing his identity, and waited outside for Lebat. He observed Lebat's suspicious behavior and decided to take action. Harry approached a coachman and explained his plan to rescue a friend from Lebat's clutches. Offering the coachman ten crowns, Harry convinced him to let him take over the coach. The coachman agreed, acknowledging that some who claim to be friends of the people are actually deceitful. They arranged to meet at the Place de Carrousel later that evening. Harry then instructed Jacques to have his wife pass a note to the warder, advising Mademoiselle de St. Caux to comply with Lebat's release order to avoid any complications.

The alternative strategy involves boarding the boat where the women and children will be placed. The plan is to hide in the boat's hold until the guards depart, then join the others. As the boat sinks, they will secure themselves to a spar and drift down the river until out of sight of the town. Pierre will row to pick them up. Adolphe expresses concern about soldiers on both sides of the river ready to shoot anyone attempting to swim ashore. Harry suggests using a hatch from the forecastle to hide them as they drift.

He observed her silently praying, and he too thanked God for the success of their plan so far. As time passed, his hopes grew as everything went better than expected. The other victims seemed unaware of his actions, which eased his worries about interference. The tide was carrying them away from danger, and he anticipated meeting their friends downstream. Finally, the sound of approaching oars signaled their rescue by Adolphe and Pierre. The girls were quickly brought aboard, and Virginie was revived with brandy. Jeanne and Harry were welcomed with cheers and warm embraces. Virginie regained consciousness as they reached Pierre's village, where they were quickly cared for and made comfortable.|"[""1.

Pierre assured everyone there was no need to fear the troublemakers, known as the _scelerats_, who had disrupted their market. He emphasized that the community would stand up against them if given the chance. Harry, feeling overwhelmed with happiness that the girls were safe, couldn't rest. Pierre shared a story of his own survival at sea, highlighting the importance of faith and perseverance during tough times. He recalled a time when he was stranded, and a woman's unwavering faith in God led to their survival.

"""It was a miraculous escape,"" Harry remarked, applying tar to the boat. ""The turtle idea was brilliant. Without it, we wouldn't have survived until the ship rescued us.""

""We were overjoyed,"" he continued, ""when we realized the plan worked. We quickly prepared the turtle shell as the rainstorm hit. With the boat overturned and oars lost, we used the mast and sail for shelter. The rain poured, filling the sail and the turtle shell with water. The following day, we set sail with the turtle, dried meat, and water. Unfortunately, luck turned against us. Days passed with no land in sight.

The woman embraced Jeanne with tears of joy, thankful to see her again. Adolphe expressed gratitude for saving his little one's life. He mentioned the notices warning against helping enemies escape.

Adolphe insisted on accepting the captain's help for Julie's future. Adolphe and his wife blessed the fugitives as they departed. The group boarded a boat with fishermen at daybreak.

Jeanne and Virginie found themselves in a tight spot, but Jeanne's comforting hand helped ease Virginie's fears. The men onboard were inspected, and the girls had to hide below deck. After a daring escape, the girls were reunited on deck, but they had to remain hidden due to the close presence of a gunboat. Virginie fainted from the stress but was revived with water and fresh air. The captain skillfully evaded the authorities, and the ship sailed towards England. The captain and crew celebrated their successful evasion, looking forward to reaching the English coast. Later, a polite invitation led to a shared supper between the girls, Harry, and the captain. Despite the motion of the ship, the girls managed to enjoy the meal before retiring for the night.

Far from the risk of encountering enemy ships, the group felt safe aboard the Trois Freres. Harry assured the others that their only concern might be English revenue cutters chasing them away from the coast, but they could easily return. Jeanne suggested staying on board in case the cutters didn't stop to pick them up, leaving them stranded far from shore. The captain planned to mislead the revenue officers by signaling a false location for the cargo drop-off, ensuring a smooth operation. As the Trois Freres approached the shore, preparations began to transfer the cargo quickly. The captain advised Harry to take the first boat with the ladies to ensure their safety on land.

""We should move aside, girls, or better yet, head up the cliff. It's best to avoid the busy workers and potential trouble with the coastguard. Let's get away from here,"" Harry suggested.

Struggling up the cliff among workers, they eventually reached the top. Finding a cart about to leave, Harry asked for a nearby farmhouse where the girls could stay the night.
