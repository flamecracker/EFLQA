"After ""The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"" was published, I started receiving letters from kids who enjoyed the story and wanted more about the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Initially, I thought of these letters as nice compliments, but they kept coming for months and years. Eventually, I made a promise to a little girl named Dorothy that if a thousand girls like her asked for more about the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, I would write a book. It seemed like magic when the letters reached a thousand, and even more arrived. This book is dedicated to David C. Montgomery and Frank A. Stone for their portrayals of the characters. In the Country of the Gillikins, a boy named Tip lived with the old woman Mombi, who was rumored to practice magic. Despite her reputation, Tip didn't work all the time, often exploring the forest or napping in the cornfields. Despite his dislike for Mombi, Tip decided to play a prank on her with a carved pumpkin head. He then crafted a man made of saplings to wear the pumpkin head."|"['1.

In the evening, Tip worked on his creation by the fire, smoothing the joints and rough spots carefully. The figure stood tall against the wall, impressing Tip, even though he forgot to give it a neck. The next morning, he completed the figure's neck from wood in the forest. Tip dressed the figure in colorful clothes he found in Mombi's chest. He then decided to place the figure, named Jack, at a bend in the road. Tip had some trouble getting Jack there, but with effort, he succeeded. However, Jack's arm fell off during the journey, but Tip fixed it. Later, old Mombi returned and sprinkled magic powder on Jack, causing him to come to life. Tip was scared at first but found it funny, bursting into laughter.|"['1.

Jack and Tip shared a funny moment where Jack's serious voice clashed with his smiling face, making Tip burst into laughter. Jack admitted he had a lot to learn about the world, unsure if he was wise or foolish. Mombi, an old woman, asked Tip to light a fire while she ate. She refused him food, so he ate nuts. Mombi brewed a strange potion, making Tip uneasy. She planned to turn him into a statue but fell asleep. Tip found the Powder of Life in her basket. He and Jack fled, with Jack's clumsy gait causing some trouble. They walked until dawn, ensuring no one could track them easily.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat caused Tip to burst into laughter?\nA) Jack's serious voice\nB) Jack's angry face\nC) Jack's sad expression\nD) Jack's confused look\nE) Jack's disappointed tone"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did Jack admit he was unsure about?\nA) His cooking skills\nB) His intelligence\nC) His bravery\nD) His wisdom or foolishness\nE) His sense of humor', ""Question 3:\nWhy did Mombi refuse to give Tip food?\nA) She didn't like him\nB) She was allergic to nuts\nC) She was too hungry\nD) She wanted him to light a fire first\nE) She wanted to keep the food for herself"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Tip find in Mombi's basket?\nA) A magic wand\nB) A key to a secret door\nC) The Powder of Life\nD) A map to a hidden treasure\nE) A spellbook"", ""Question 5:\nWhy did Tip feel uneasy about Mombi brewing a strange potion?\nA) He was allergic to potions\nB) He didn't like the smell\nC) He was afraid of Mombi\nD) He sensed danger\nE) He was curious about the potion"", ""Question 6:\nWhat caused some trouble for Jack and Tip as they fled?\nA) A sudden storm\nB) Jack's clumsy gait\nC) A wild animal\nD) Tip's forgetfulness\nE) Running out of food""]"|"[""A) Jack's serious voice"", 'D) His wisdom or foolishness', 'D) She wanted him to light a fire first', 'C) The Powder of Life', 'D) He sensed danger', ""B) Jack's clumsy gait""]"
In the Land of Oz, the Emerald City stands as the grandest town, built by the mighty Wizard Oz, where everything is green. In contrast, the Gillikins' land is purple, the Munchkins' is blue, the Quadlings' is red, and the Winkies' is yellow. Dorothy, a girl from Kansas, journeyed to Oz with the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Seeking to return home, they found the Wizard lacking real magic. When the Wizard fled in a balloon, Dorothy's companions stayed behind. Tip, a boy who accidentally brought a wooden man to life, reflected on the magical mishap. As Tip examined the saw-horse, he realized its resemblance to a real horse but acknowledged its lifeless nature, unlike a living horse that eats oats and prances.|['1.

The Saw-Horse, upon realizing he was alive, appeared more surprised than Tip. His knotty eyes scanned his surroundings with wonder. Lacking a neck, he struggled to see himself, circling awkwardly. In his confusion, he accidentally knocked over Jack Pumpkinhead. Ignoring Tip's commands, the Saw-Horse stepped on Tip's foot, causing pain. Tip then decided to tether the Saw-Horse to a tree with a strong cord. Startled by the first sounds he heard, the Saw-Horse bolted, knocking over Tip and Jack. After some mishaps, Tip crafted a makeshift ear and secured it to the Saw-Horse's head. The journey continued the next day towards the Emerald City, where the Scarecrow ruled. Upon reaching a river, they encountered a ferryman, and Tip led the Saw-Horse into the water to cross.|"[""1.

"The Saw-Horse swiftly rowed the adventurers across the river using its legs as oars. Wet and dripping, they climbed the grassy bank. Tip's trousers and shoes were soaked, but the Pumpkinhead's fancy clothes were drenched. Returning to the yellow brick road, Tip mounted the Pumpkinhead on the Saw-Horse. The Saw-Horse, upon hearing ""Go,"" raced off, leaving Tip behind as he struggled to keep up. Jack, clinging to a post, and the Saw-Horse raced onward. They reached a green stone wall studded with emeralds. The Guardian, a round man in green, emerged and led them into a room. A tall soldier with a green gun arrived. The Soldier with Green Whiskers took the Pumpkinhead to the royal palace.

The unknown man waited in a beautifully furnished room as the soldier went to inform the king. The ruler, bored and free at that moment, summoned the visitor to his throne room. Jack, unaware of worldly customs, was surprised to see the Scarecrow King seated on the throne. The Scarecrow wore faded blue clothes, a straw-filled head with painted features, and a lumpy straw-stuffed body. His heavy crown made his brow sag. The Scarecrow was simple yet majestic. The Pumpkinhead, with a carved face on a grinning pumpkin, seemed delightful to the Scarecrow. Initially, the Scarecrow thought Jack was laughing at him but realized Jack's carved smile made him unable to look serious. The Scarecrow decided to find an interpreter who could speak both languages to facilitate communication between them.|"['1.

The Scarecrow advised Tip to control his imagination since he was a wooden figure. Tip, eager to reunite with Jack and the Saw-Horse, walked halfway to the Emerald City without a break. Hungry, he found a girl with a striking outfit by the road. Her dress was vibrant with colors and buttons that matched the hues. She held a lunch basket and ate with appetite. Tip, without questions, shared her food. The girl revealed a secret army of girls ready to revolt against the Scarecrow and take over the Emerald City. General Jinjur led the army, dressed in uniforms representing different regions of Oz.

The young boy followed the group, carrying baskets and packages from the Army of Revolt. They reached the green granite walls of the City and stopped at the gateway. The Guardian of the Gate, wearing keys around his neck, seemed unaware of the rebellion. He urged the girls to go home, warning them of the danger of conquering the City. The rebels, armed with knitting needles, threatened the Guardian, causing chaos. The Soldier with the Green Whiskers fled as the rebels entered the City, digging emeralds with their needles. Tip followed the Soldier to the palace, where they found the Scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead. The Scarecrow, resigned to losing his throne, prepared for the conquering rebels. The group planned to escape through a passage barred by the Soldier. They unbarred the gate, ready to flee.|"[""1.

Several girls were guarding the palace when the Saw-Horse rushed past, knocking some over and causing chaos. Tip, the Scarecrow, and Jack Pumpkinhead were caught up in the mayhem. The Saw-Horse upset a fruit cart, bowled over people, and even toppled the Guardian of the Gate. Racing westward, the horse's leaps were so violent that it left everyone breathless. Eventually, they all ended up in the water, struggling to stay afloat. Tip managed to free them from the wooden horse, finding Jack's pumpkin head floating in the river. After retrieving it, he restored Jack's head and helped the Scarecrow dry out. The Scarecrow, undamaged but damp, thanked Tip and joked about aging.

The Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Tip, along with little Dorothy, had been captured by the Winged Monkeys. The Scarecrow assured them that the Winged Monkeys were now under Glinda the Good's command. The group decided to let Tip rest and sleep as he was hungry and tired. Tip awoke to find the Scarecrow had gathered berries for breakfast. They resumed their journey and reached the City of the Winkies, where the Tin Woodman ruled as an emperor. The Tin Woodman, made entirely of tin, excused himself to have his body polished. Upon his return, his nickel-plated body shone brightly, and he explained the significance of the star engraved on his breast, covering a patch where the Wizard had placed his heart.

The Scarecrow explained that the females who had taken over the city believed that men had ruled for too long. They had stolen the treasury jewels and were now in charge. The Tin Woodman was puzzled, noticing the Saw-Horse for the first time. Tip called the creature over, causing a bit of chaos. The emperor instructed his Chancellor to run the kingdom while he was away. The Scarecrow was cleaned, his clothes pressed, and his crown polished. Tip fixed Jack Pumpkinhead's wooden limbs, and the Saw-Horse underwent inspection. The next morning, they started their journey back to the Emerald City. General Jinjur was worried about their escape and feared the danger they posed. Mombi, furious at being tricked, went to help Jinjur defeat the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. They found themselves surrounded by giant sunflowers, each with a girl's face in the center. Tip suspected magic and illusions from Mombi.

The group noticed an extraordinary figure approaching them. It moved swiftly and silently, standing before them in minutes. The Woggle-Bug, speaking to them, claimed to be greatly magnified. Tip was captivated by this bug-like being with a round body, delicate feet, and a unique appearance. The Woggle-Bug wore a fancy outfit and a tall silk hat. The Scarecrow welcomed the stranger, who shared a tale of transformation from an ordinary bug to an educated being.

The professor planned to magnify an insect for study. Unexpectedly, a girl fell out the window, causing chaos. The educated Woggle-Bug used his magnified state to escape, while the professor tended to the girls. The Woggle-Bug shared how he saved a tailor's ninth life, earning a stylish costume. The group faced a challenge when the Saw-Horse broke a leg. The Scarecrow suggested fitting the Pumpkinhead's leg to the Saw-Horse. Reluctantly, Jack agreed to have his leg amputated to help the Saw-Horse. The Saw-Horse grumbled about the new leg but eventually walked more comfortably.

The Scarecrow gasped, the Tin Woodman stopped, and the Woggle-Bug was reproached. The Saw-Horse snorted, the Pumpkinhead hid a smile, and the Tin Woodman warned about being over-educated. The Tin Woodman called a mouse for help, and the Scarecrow hid the mouse in his straw. The Tin Woodman suggested the mouse guide them to the Emerald City. They faced illusions, crossed a river, passed through walls, and navigated confusing roads. The Scarecrow warned about magic and they reached the city gates guarded by girls.

"As they walked down the street, no one tried to stop them. Some women paused from their chatter to glance at them, but quickly turned away with a smirk. Even when they encountered girls from the Army of Revolt, there was no resistance. The soldiers simply moved aside to let them pass without a word. Upon reaching the royal palace unchallenged, they climbed the steps once encrusted with emeralds, now empty from the rebels' actions.

Inside, General Jinjur sat on the throne, wearing a crown and enjoying caramels. She boldly claimed the throne, declaring herself queen. Suddenly, the Tin Woodman was disarmed by the rebels, leaving the group surrounded and captured. Jinjur threatened to destroy them all, sparing only one. However, the Scarecrow, undeterred, devised a plan. He released mice, causing chaos and allowing them to escape as Jinjur fled in terror."|['1.

All the friends, except Jack Pumpkinhead, hurried to seal the palace doors tightly against the Army of Revolt. They gathered in the throne room for a strategy meeting. The Scarecrow acknowledged Jinjur's claim to the throne and suggested they should not occupy her palace if she was the rightful queen. The Woggle-Bug was distressed, recalling Jinjur's threats. The group discussed using the magical powder to bring inanimate objects to life for their escape. The Scarecrow proposed building a flying machine to carry them away.

Eager to end their captivity, the friends split up to search the palace for materials to build their flying machine. When they regrouped on the roof, they found a strange mix of items. The Woggle-Bug brought a Gump's head with antlers, Tip hauled a heavy sofa with the Saw-Horse's help, and the Pumpkinhead carried a broom. The Scarecrow arrived with ropes and clotheslines.

Tip held onto a chimney to avoid being blown off the roof by a strong breeze caused by the wings. The Scarecrow was carried through the air until Tip grabbed his leg to save him. The Woggle-Bug laid flat and was unharmed. The Tin Woodman, being heavy, held onto Jack Pumpkinhead to keep him safe. The Saw-Horse fell on his back with his legs up. The Gump, brought to life with a head instead of legs, circled the palace roof. The Gump, confused about its existence, agreed to serve them. They decided to visit Queen Glinda the Good in the South Country for advice. Eventually, they all boarded the Gump, and it flew smoothly towards the South.|['1.

The group found themselves in a precarious situation as the Gump's wings broke off, causing them to tumble down a cliff. Luckily, they landed in a nest built by Jackdaws, escaping serious harm. Although the adventurers were bewildered by their predicament, they discovered the nest was filled with stolen items from human homes, including a diamond necklace. The Tin Woodman proudly adorned himself with the necklace, its diamonds sparkling in the sunlight. Realizing they were at the mercy of the birds, the Scarecrow devised a plan to protect his companions. He instructed Tip and the Woggle-Bug to lie down in the nest, covered by straw, while Jack's head was removed to prevent damage.

The Tin Woodman, known for his peaceful demeanor, turned fierce when the Jackdaws attacked. With his axe, he fought off many, but the birds were relentless. They targeted the Gump's glass eyes and the Scarecrow's straw-filled body. The Woodman's swift axe and the Gump's flapping wings scared the Jackdaws away. Meanwhile, Jack's pumpkin head was saved from the chaos. Amidst the commotion, they discovered the Jackdaws had stolen money, not just any money, but bills of various denominations. The Scarecrow was stuffed with the bills, making him the most valuable member of the group. The Woggle-Bug emphasized the Scarecrow's importance, not due to education but to the mathematics of the situation. The Scarecrow, grateful for the transformation, highlighted the importance of his brains in emergencies.

"""Yes; but my mouth is painted on, and there’s no swallow connected with it,” answered the Scarecrow. “In fact,” he continued, looking from one to another critically, “I believe the boy and the Woggle-Bug are the only ones in our party that are able to swallow.”

The Woggle-Bug declared, “Of course they are. Didn’t Tip wish that he’d never swallowed one of them? Well, the wish came true, and he _didn’t_ swallow one of them. So of course they are all three in the box.”

The Woggle-Bug swallowed a pill without hesitation, and they all admired his courage while the Insect counted seventeen by twos. The silver pellet caused no pain, as Woggle-Bugs have strong stomachs.

The Gump lay before them in perfect repair, ready to fly, as the wish had been granted. The Scarecrow adorned himself with rings and bracelets, while the Tin Woodman wore a diamond necklace. Tip proudly pocketed a gold watch, and Jack Pumpkinhead and the Saw-Horse received jeweled brooches and a lorgnette. Several large seal rings adorned the Gump’s antlers.

As the Scarecrow searched for the missing pepper-box with the Wishing Pills, it was nowhere to be found. The voyagers anxiously scoured every corner of the Thing, but the precious box had vanished. Feeling remorseful, the Scarecrow admitted his carelessness and acknowledged the seriousness of losing the pills. He warned the group of potential dangers ahead. The Tin Woodman recognized they were nearing Glinda the Good's domain by the red houses and trees.

Glinda, the Sorceress, dismissed the adventurers with grace as they wandered through the beautiful gardens of the Southland. Glinda suspected the Wizard's actions, including secret visits to Mombi. She believed Mombi helped the Wizard hide the true heir, Ozma, to maintain power. Glinda, with her grand army, prepared to march to the Emerald City to confront Jinjur. The army, led by Glinda, surrounded the city at night, ready for battle. Jinjur, surprised by the army's presence, sent a messenger to negotiate.

The old witch, peering into her magic mirror, foresaw trouble. She hatched a plan to deceive Glinda, the Sorceress. Mombi transformed Jellia Jamb to look like her and herself to resemble Jellia. The trick was to hand over the fake Mombi to Glinda, who would then retreat, assuming she had the real Mombi. However, Glinda saw through the ruse and restored Jellia to her true form. Angered, Glinda demanded the real Mombi from Jinjur, who, in cahoots with the witch, tried to deceive Glinda. Mombi disguised herself as a rose, evading Glinda’s search.
