"""Let me simplify the concept of radio telephony for you,"" explained Mr. Chadwick. ""When you speak into a phone, the microphone records your voice as electrical impulses. These impulses travel along the wire to the receiver, where a metal disc vibrates to reproduce the sound. The vibrations in the disc compress or rarefy the air, transmitting the sound to the ear of the listener. The challenge in radio telephony is replicating these vibrations over Hertzian waves instead of wires. Unlike wireless telegraphy, where all energy is utilized, in radio telephony, only variations in waves can be detected, resulting in significant energy waste. To transmit the human voice effectively, high-frequency currents are needed, a task that has posed challenges in early experiments."""|['1.

Jack urged Tom to use all the power available as the Wondership swayed wildly but managed to stabilize. Jack steered upstream to avoid being carried too far downstream by the rushing water. The creek was flanked by steep limestone walls, posing a challenge. The propellers fought against the air, pushing the Wondership upstream amidst the roaring water. Quickly and narrowly, they reached the opposite side. They barely made it, but it was enough. Jack then revealed the financial turmoil faced by Mr. Chadwick. Dr. Mays suggested easing his worries by potentially recovering his fortune. Jack and Tom proposed an expedition using their share from the hydroaëroplane plant.

Dr. Mays, after being fully informed of the situation, allowed the boys to proceed with their plan to go on a trip. He assured Mr. Chadwick that the boys would be fine, as there were enough funds left from the inventor's fortune to sustain them comfortably during their absence, in addition to royalties from past inventions. However, the majority of his wealth had disappeared, and the radio telephone was not yet ready for the market. Jack intended to use the Wondership to search for Rattlesnake Island and its treasures.

""That explains it,"" said old Pete kindly. ""You can't expect Easterners to know about it. Somewhere out in the desert to the east, there are three buttes sticking up, and right there is Peg-leg Smith's lost mine where the sands are said to be made of gold.""

Who was Peg-leg? Well, that's not very well known. His name was Smith, and he was missing a leg, hence the nickname. Back in 1836, Peg-leg arrived in Yuma with a group of trappers who had worked down the Colorado River.

They decided to stop trapping and search for gold, heading up the Gila River and then into the desert. From Yuma, they traveled southeast for four days across the desert. By the end of the fourth day, they were running out of water and decided to look for a water-hole in a canyon where three lone buttes stood like sentinels against the sky.

They searched the canyon but found no water. Eventually, they reached the buttes. Climbing to the top of the southernmost butte, Peg-leg found chunks of black rock with specks and chunks of bright yellow. Peg-leg thought the yellow was copper or fool's gold.

Long ago, an Indian working on Governor Downey's ranch near Smith Mountain found gold in black rocks from the three buttes. The Indian traded the gold for alcohol. When the Indian passed away, Governor Downey tried to locate the buttes but failed. McGuire claimed he knew the location but vanished with five others. A prospector later discovered the buttes but didn't reveal the gold's location until his death. Dr. De Courcy, informed by the prospector, spent his wealth searching in vain.

Old man McGee and his team were prepared, having loaded crates onto the wagon from the freight shed. After a quick breakfast, they set off secretly. Avoiding onlookers, they commended Zeb's discretion. Dick noticed them but recognized one of the individuals. The wagon journeyed to a deserted hut by a deep gulch leading to the Colorado River. Crates were swiftly unloaded near the river's turbulent waters. Dick accompanied McGee for the last load. At the depot, Dick wired his Boston paper. Zeb, the expedition leader, inquired about Dick's role. Jack and Tom began digging trenches for shelter. Zeb prepared a campfire meal with catfish, bacon, and coffee. As they set the table, they realized the professor was missing. Suddenly, a landslide occurred, revealing the professor's figure.|['1.

The professor narrowly escaped a dangerous fall into an arroyo due to his poor eyesight in the dark. Luckily, he was unharmed, and they all enjoyed a meal together. However, a sudden heavy rainstorm flooded their camp, causing leaks in their tents. Even the professor was found hopping barefoot in the water. Despite the discomfort, they managed to make the best of the situation with a smile. The next morning, the sun returned, drying their belongings. As they unpacked the Wondership, an old Indian passed by looking for his lost burro. Later, Dick encountered Masterson in a boat, hinting at possible spies trailing them.

As the days passed, the Wondership was prepared for its most important journey yet. Zeb rode into town on a burro, while Jack's father, recovering but worried about finances, sent news. Dick, helping with the Wondership, spent free time fishing and hunting, catching a few rabbits in the barren area. Despite rumors of deer further down the river, Dick explored a bend and discovered caves once inhabited by extinct Indians. Curious, he ventured inside and found evidence of recent occupation by non-Indians. Startled, Dick realized he might be spying on Masterson, who arrived with supplies in a boat below. Unsure of his next move, Dick pondered his predicament, torn between avoiding trouble and showing bravery.|"[""1.

"Higgins suddenly suggested, ""Could it be one of those kids from the camp below? They might have seen us snooping around at night."" Led by Masterson with a pistol, they started up the pathway. Dick was unsure but decided to confront the issue head-on. As Masterson reached the cave's entrance, Dick dashed out swiftly. The pistol fired, causing Masterson to tumble into the river. Luckily, he could swim. Sam and Eph threatened Dick as he sailed away in a boat, feeling relieved. The next day, old man McGee came to retrieve his burro and a ladder left at the shanty. Despite McGee's doubts about their flying invention, he mentioned three young men planning a river trip.

The donkey, carrying a peculiar load, followed behind old McGee's horse as the boys walked alongside, listening to the prospector's tales of striking it rich one day. His unwavering faith in his dream of finding a fortune never faltered. As they approached the willow grove where Dick went rabbit-hunting, the monotony of the journey bored him. Looking for some fun, Dick used a magnifying glass from his pocket to focus the sun's rays on the donkey's back, causing it to bray and kick wildly. The commotion startled everyone, and as the donkey raced towards the trees, a yell emerged, alarming the boys. The donkey got entangled in the branches, hanging from the ladder until the boys freed it. The professor, embarrassed by the interruption, resumed his work collecting specimens.

When everything was prepared, Jack filled the gas reservoir with a special powder to create lifting vapor. After ensuring the tank had good pressure, they started the propellers and the Wondership ascended like a bird. Carrying extra weight slowed their ascent due to supplies and passengers. Bill suggested moving on and exploring the river. From above, the desert looked stunning with the Colorado River carving through it and colorful cliffs surrounding it. As they flew, the landscape changed, revealing vibrant rock colors in the canyon. They landed on an island that resembled Rattlesnake Island. While exploring, they encountered a deer, and Jack shot it for fresh meat. Zeb expertly prepared the venison for lunch, and the boys enjoyed the delicious meal on the island.|"['1.

As the plates and utensils were being cleaned, the professor ventured off to search for rocks and specimens. He assured he would return shortly, eager to find rare stones. Suddenly, he found himself stuck in a muddy hole that bubbled and steamed. Desperately, the group sought ways to rescue him. Zeb climbed a tree, reached out over the hole, and pulled the professor to safety. The professor explained he had unknowingly stepped into a mud-spring covered with alkaline earth. Grateful to be saved, they continued their journey on the Wondership, leaving the gloomy canyon behind.

One night, a loud crash of tin dishes outside the tent startled everyone. Zeb and the professor rushed out to see a peculiar animal with its head stuck in a cooking pot. It turned out to be a badger trying to lick oatmeal remains. After freeing the badger, the camp settled back down. The next morning, they packed up and took off in their Wondership. The desert mornings were cool, but the heat grew intense by noon. They spotted Rattlesnake Island with its unique features, including a dead pine tree on a rocky peak. As they landed on the island, a sense of unease crept over them due to the eerie, lifeless surroundings. The group felt a strange melancholy as they explored the mysterious island.|['1.

In the dark, swampy clearing, holes were dug but the rusty spade showed no recent use. Exploring a crude hut, they found only rusty tools and old clothes, with dust everywhere. Choosing a plateau for their camp, they enjoyed a view of the river. After setting up camp, they cooked a stew with rabbits and squirrels. As night fell, Jack awoke and saw strange white figures dancing in the moonlight. Startled at first, he realized it was just steam rising from the ground, glowing eerily. Mesmerized by the sight, he watched the twisting columns of vapor dance like ghosts, creating a mysterious spectacle on the island.|"['1.

Jack, feeling uneasy about the mysterious island, pondered the strange occurrences. He worried about his father awaiting news of their discovery that could change their fortunes. While exploring near the Wondership, he noticed no footprints, but he couldn't shake off the image of a mysterious figure he saw the night before. Keeping this to himself, he ventured into the woods and stumbled upon a trapped rabbit, writhing in pain. Shocked by the discovery, Jack realized the cruel act of trapping animals.

Someone on the island had set a trap, not the boys themselves. Maybe it was the strange man he saw near the Wondership the night before. The boy scanned the quiet woods, half expecting to spot a watcher. When he felt the urge to end the rabbit's suffering, he realized the trap was empty. Jack returned to get his rifle but found no sign of the rabbit. Instead, he discovered a torn piece of canvas on a thornbush, which added to the mystery. Feeling uneasy, Jack decided to share his experience with Zeb, who was as puzzled as him. Later, the professor arrived, upset by the odd events. Jack's detailed account, along with the canvas scrap, convinced everyone of the strange occurrences.

"""Don't move! Stop for your safety!"" shouted the short geologist, rushing forward. He dropped to his knees at Dick's feet as if they were sacred, and with shaking hands scraped off some black mud that clung to them. ""Z. 2. X.,"" the professor said gravely, gesturing towards the black barren land where a patch of moist, unhealthy-looking ground lay quivering in the sun. A faint haze hung above it, resembling a thin fog. ""Yes, that's nearly as certain evidence as an analysis of its strong radioactivity. You observed that Zeb's sample was enclosed in a lead tube. That was necessary. Such potent material could cause severe burns if mishandled."" ""That's the reason,"" the professor continued, ""and that's why we brought those lead containers. Z. 2.

They carried the heavy carboys to the stranded boat, and the professor carefully sealed and secured covers on each one. After finishing, they returned to their camp.

It was midnight, and the moon shone brightly in the cloudless sky over the Boy Inventors' camp. Three mysterious figures approached cautiously, each carrying a spade and a sack. They paused to survey the camp before heading towards the plateau where the adventurers had been working. Masterson was the first to notice signs of digging and alerted his friends. Silently, the intruders crept down the slope towards the mineral-rich barren ground. As they began digging, dark figures from the camp followed suit, observing their actions. However, a mishap occurred when Sam accidentally pushed the boat into the stream, leaving them stranded on the island.

A man, resembling a wild figure, was found injured on the rocks after missing a boat jump. The boys, ignoring onlookers, hurried along the shore. The man's ramblings revealed his struggles on the island. He lived like a savage, hunting and eating raw animals. Masterson and his group, humbled and injured, sought help from the boys. They agreed to keep the island expedition a secret. The Wondership made trips to Yuma, leaving the insane Foxy in an asylum.

Tom was surprised and quickly turned around to find the professor staring intently at a small rock under his heel. The professor abruptly moved him aside, grabbed his hammer, and added the rock to his collection. Without acknowledging Tom, he swiftly moved on to another stone. Tom's friend, Jack, suggested sending their aircraft, the Wondership, to New York and then continuing to Nestorville via air. Tom hesitated but then caught on to Jack's playful idea of using the Z.2.X. for communication as they flew closer to their hometown. The Wondership was swiftly prepared for its journey back home from its discreet location in Manhattan. Jack focused on the radio telephone equipment, and once ready, he sent a message to his father. The next day, as they flew over the countryside, the professor lamented missing out on valuable stones below. Jack, engrossed in the radio equipment, was eager to test the Coloradite. After a tense moment of no response, Jack feared a malfunction but eventually connected with his father, who was recovering well and eager to hear their adventures. Upon reaching Nestorville, the boys and the professor were greeted with overwhelming enthusiasm from the townspeople, leaving a lasting impression.|"['1.
