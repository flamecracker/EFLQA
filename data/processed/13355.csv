Tommy Tit the Chickadee visited Happy Jack every day, but this time he seemed anxious. Tommy had been to Farmer Brown's dooryard but couldn't find Farmer Brown's boy. Happy Jack, usually happy, was visibly worried. He fidgeted on the edge of the Green Forest, pretending to search for buried nuts but actually keeping an eye on Farmer Brown's house. The shadows grew longer as the afternoon waned, signaling bedtime for Happy Jack. Just when he was about to give up, Tommy Tit landed beside him. Tommy shared his adventures at Farmer Brown's, encountering a hungry Black Pussy and a feisty Bully the English Sparrow. Tommy discovered that Sammy Jay had stolen his suet, leaving him hungry.

"Tommy excitedly exclaimed, ""So many hickory nuts are cracked!"" Tommy had a feeling they were meant for him. When he saw the coast was clear, he darted over to enjoy them. The nuts were so tasty, he almost forgot about Farmer Brown's boy until he glanced through the window. The window looked like ice but wasn't, allowing Tommy to see inside. Curious things were in the house, but then he spotted Farmer Brown's boy lying down, appearing unwell. Tommy tapped on the window to get his attention and rushed back to tell Happy Jack Squirrel. Happy Jack, usually a sound sleeper, had a restless night due to worries about Farmer Brown's boy. Despite once fearing him when he carried a gun, Happy Jack now felt grateful and concerned for him.

Happy Jack Squirrel was a bit surprised. He had never been to Farmer Brown's house, and the thought of going there made him nervous. Tommy Tit, the Chickadee, assured him it was safe. He explained that the only dangers were Black Pussy the cat and Bowser the Hound, but they could easily avoid them. Tommy suggested hiding in the old stone wall until it was clear to run to the big maple tree near the house. From there, they could peek inside and see Farmer Brown's boy. Happy Jack felt a mix of excitement and fear as they set off. Tommy led the way through the Old Orchard, keeping watch for any danger. When they reached the stone wall, Tommy checked and confirmed it was safe. He encouraged Happy Jack to be brave and follow him to the tree to see Farmer Brown's boy.|"[""1.

The following morning, Tommy Tit was present as usual, but Happy Jack hesitated to visit again due to his previous scare. Eventually, they decided to go. Upon reaching the tree near the house, they were surprised to see Farmer Brown's boy inside the window. Although he looked like Farmer Brown's boy, his cheeks were puffed out like Striped Chipmunk's. Happy Jack and Tommy Tit were unsure at first but realized it was indeed Farmer Brown's boy. They were relieved when they saw a smile in his eyes. Happy Jack visited the window sill daily to meet Farmer Brown's boy, who gradually looked more like himself and smiled warmly. One day, Happy Jack found the window partly open and no nuts on the sill. Farmer Brown's boy offered him some fat nuts, making Happy Jack's mouth water.

Happy Jack swiftly hopped onto the window ledge where Farmer Brown's boy's hand held out fat nuts. He wasted no time grabbing one, perching to savor its deliciousness. As he relished the treat, he craved more. But the boy withdrew his hand, signaling the nuts were now inside. Happy Jack hesitated, fearing being trapped if the window closed. The boy reassured him, urging him to come in for more nuts. Though Happy Jack couldn't understand, he sensed he had to enter for the treats. After mustering courage, he ventured in, grabbed a nut, and scurried out to feast. The boy chuckled, offering the rest before closing the window.

Happy Jack's day was ruined because he couldn't brag about being bold. He blamed Tommy Tit for it. The next morning, they found nuts by Farmer Brown's house. Tommy Tit dared Happy Jack to go inside and get a nut. Happy Jack hesitated but didn't want to be laughed at, so he went in. He felt at home after eating the nuts and exploring the room.

He chuckled at Happy Jack's pride, knowing that true bravery comes from facing fear.

When Sammy witnessed Happy Jack settling in comfortably indoors, he was taken aback. The shock intensified when Farmer Brown's boy appeared, and Happy Jack didn't flee. Overwhelmed, Sammy flew back to the Green Forest, pondering the value of dreams. Happy Jack, the squirrel, believed a nightmare turning real was worse than an unfulfilled beautiful dream. Despite a peaceful period after escaping Shadow the Weasel, a terrifying dream of Shadow's return haunted Happy Jack. Upon waking, relief washed over him, but the fear lingered. Early the next morning, perched on a chestnut tree, he spotted Shadow hunting in the snow. The sight reignited Happy Jack's dread, reminding him of the perilous encounter with the Weasel.|"[""1.

Happy Jack raced along the stone wall by the Old Orchard towards Farmer Brown's dooryard, followed closely by Shadow the Weasel. Shadow appeared to be enjoying the chase, knowing the slim chance of encountering Farmer Brown's boy so early. Confident of the outcome, Shadow anticipated a squirrel breakfast. As Happy Jack reached the dooryard, Shadow closed in, causing him to pant heavily. Without pausing to check for safety, Happy Jack dashed across the yard and up a maple tree. Surprised by Happy Jack's choice, Shadow followed suit, assuming Happy Jack would be exhausted at the tree's top. To Shadow's astonishment, Happy Jack was nowhere to be found.

Farmer Brown's boy woke up with a loud yell and realized he was safe in his room with the morning sun peeking in. Startled by a Gray Squirrel seeking refuge, he noticed the squirrel was frightened by something outside. He then saw Shadow the Weasel lurking near.

Happy Jack knew Shadow the Weasel's persistence well. Shadow never gives up easily; he's known for his determination. Happy Jack understood this trait and knew Shadow wouldn't easily abandon his pursuit. So, instead of risking a surprise encounter with Shadow, Happy Jack stayed near Farmer Brown's house, wary of the potential danger. Mrs. Brown, not fully aware of the situation, mistook Happy Jack's anxious behavior for scolding. Despite longing to enter the closed window for safety, Happy Jack couldn't due to it only being open at night.
