Ruth had no proof to support her claim. She had kept her scenario a secret, as advised by Mr. Hammond for successful productions. However, when she accused John, the hermit, of stealing her story, she had no evidence. If Ruth had shared her plot with Mr. Hammond from the start, her accusation might have seemed more credible.

The hermit sternly refused to give away his story without proper payment. He demanded the agreed-upon five hundred and refused to share any personal history. The manager, equally firm, stated he needed to know more about the author before accepting the story. Tensions rose as Mr. Hammond accused the hermit of being secretive. Meanwhile, aboard the _Stazy_, the threat of German submarines loomed, but Skipper Phil skillfully navigated the ship.

"To be honest, Mr. Hammond's apparent uncertainty - not about her honesty, but about her judgment - had rattled the girl's self-assurance. It was a peculiar situation indeed. She remembered the disoriented woman she had encountered during the storm on the mountain, who seemed to have lost control of her nerves and mind. Ruth began to wonder if she, too, was teetering on the edge of a breakdown. Had she deluded herself about the hermit's tale? Had she dwelled so much on her own losses that she was unable to make sound decisions? These thoughts unsettled the typically pragmatic Ruth Fielding. The hospital incident in France, detailed in ""Ruth Fielding Homeward Bound,"" had deeply affected her, causing her to shudder at the memories. She feared that her friends, even Tom and Helen, viewed her differently now. The idea that her grief had clouded her judgment about the hermit's story frightened her. Despite her worries, she kept silent on the matter, even as Helen brought up the topic of the Beach Plum Point ""hermit"" during lunch with friends at Reef Harbor House. Ruth couldn't help but feel anxious as they set sail to meet the hermit on Reef Island. The hermit greeted them warmly, revealing a toothless smile and a hint of alcohol on his breath. Ruth noticed that his eyes were watery and red. The man seemed unaffected by any shortage of alcohol in the area."|"[""**1.

Mr. Hammond and the actors were clueless about the _Stazy_'s accident from Beach Plum Point. They could only observe activities on the craft and ponder the situation. Through his glasses, the manager saw Ruth Fielding at the wheel, her expression captivating him. Helpless onshore, they anxiously awaited the yacht's control. The rain poured heavily, but the _Stazy_ regained stability. Most onlookers sought shelter, while Mr. Hammond lingered to witness the yacht's safety.
