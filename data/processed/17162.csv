In the beginning, God created the heavens, the earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, plants, animals, and man. Adam and Eve were the first humans, placed in the Garden of Eden. They were happy until they sinned by eating the forbidden fruit. This act made them fearful of God as they knew they had done wrong. Sin entered the world through their disobedience. The story continues with their sons, Cain and Abel. Cain, a farmer, and Abel, a shepherd, offered sacrifices to God. God accepted Abel's offering but not Cain's because Abel followed God's instructions with faith, while Cain did not. Enraged, Cain killed his brother out of jealousy.

About fifteen hundred years after Cain killed Abel, people became increasingly evil. God saw the wickedness and decided to destroy all except one righteous man named Noah. God instructed Noah to build an ark to save his family and two of every living creature from a flood. Despite warnings, people continued in sin. When the ark was ready, Noah, his family, and the animals entered. God closed the door as rain flooded the earth, sparing only those in the ark. After a year, they left the ark, and Noah offered thanks to God. God promised never to flood the earth again and blessed Noah's descendants. People multiplied and built a tower to reach heaven, but God confused their language, scattering them across the earth. In Palestine, Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed for their wickedness by fire and brimstone.|"['1.

"Before God ruined these cities, He dispatched two angels to Lot, Abraham's relative, residing in Sodom, instructing him to escape with his family. The angels hurried him, warning, ""Get up, take your wife and daughters; don't stay or you'll perish in the city's sin."" Grasping their hands, the angels guided them out, cautioning Lot, ""Flee for your life; don't look back or linger; head for the mountain to survive."" Lot requested shelter in Zoar, a nearby town, which the angels allowed, and he swiftly departed with his family. In the illustration, we see Lot and his daughters entering Zoar, with Sodom ablaze in the distance. However, Lot's wife, who disobeyed the angel's order not to look back, stands as a pillar of salt. Abraham followed God's commandments faithfully and was greatly blessed. Despite being asked to sacrifice his son Isaac, Abraham trusted God's plan.

Rebekah's story tells of how she was chosen by God to be Isaac's wife. When the man sent to find her arrived, her family accepted God's will and allowed her to go with him. Rebekah, dressed in rich clothing and veiled, journeyed to meet Isaac. Upon their meeting, Isaac welcomed her warmly, and she became his wife. In another tale, Joseph, beloved by his father Jacob, was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers. Despite his hardships, God was with Joseph, and he prospered wherever he went. Even in prison, Joseph interpreted dreams, including Pharaoh's troubling visions.

Pharaoh had a dream that troubled him, and he sought Joseph for help. Joseph humbly told Pharaoh that it was God who could provide the interpretation. Joseph explained that the dreams were a message from God about seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine. He advised Pharaoh to store up food during the years of plenty to prepare for the difficult times ahead. Pharaoh was impressed by Joseph's wisdom and made him a ruler in Egypt. Meanwhile, Jacob and his sons faced famine in Canaan and journeyed to Egypt for food. Joseph, now a powerful ruler, revealed himself to his brothers and forgave them. He joyfully reunited with his father, Jacob, who was overjoyed to see his son alive. The family settled in Egypt, where they were welcomed by Pharaoh.|['1.

The Israelites were commanded to mark their doors with lamb's blood, sparing their homes from the destroying angel. After leaving Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea and journeyed toward Mount Sinai. In the wilderness, they grumbled for water and food. At Marah, bitter water was made sweet by a tree. God sent manna for food. In Rephidim, they found no water and murmured, leading Moses to strike a rock for water. At Mount Sinai, God gave Moses the Ten Commandments. The people promised to obey, but struggled to keep it, facing consequences. On the third day, God descended on Mount Sinai with thunders and lightnings, giving the Commandments.|"[""1.

God gave the Ten Commandments to the people, and they were in awe of the thunder, lightning, and trumpet sounds. They saw the mountain smoking and were afraid, standing far away. The law of God is sacred, and we must obey it. After this, God called Moses up the mountain for forty days and nights. During this time, God instructed Moses to ask the Israelites for materials to build a tabernacle where God would reside. Moses was shown the design of the tabernacle, the ark of the covenant, and the garments for the priests. Bezaleel and Aholiab were chosen for their special skills to work on this project.

The priests brought the ark to the middle of the river, and the people crossed as the waters stood still. Joshua had twelve men take stones from the riverbed as a memorial. The news of this miracle spread fear among the Canaanites. Joshua was then near Jericho and encountered a man with a drawn sword, who revealed himself as the Lord. Joshua worshipped and followed the Lord's instructions to capture Jericho in a unique way. The Israelites marched around the city for six days, with priests blowing trumpets. On the seventh day, after circling the city seven times, they shouted, and the walls fell. The Israelites conquered Jericho as God had promised.

God commanded the Israelites to defeat Jericho and devote all the riches found there to the Lord. Disobeying this command would bring a curse upon them. They were also instructed to conquer the Canaanites and drive them out. When preparing to attack the city of Ai, Joshua's men were defeated. Achan, an Israelite, had stolen items from Jericho, causing their defeat. Through God's guidance, Achan was discovered and punished. Before entering Canaan, Moses urged the Israelites to serve God faithfully. Joshua built an altar as directed by Moses, where the law was written. The blessings and curses for obedience were proclaimed on Mounts Ebal and Gerizim. Cities of refuge were established to protect those who unintentionally caused harm. Revenge was common, but God provided a way to protect the innocent.|"[""1.

In the picture, we see a man running towards the city gate, with someone chasing him and shooting arrows. The man is close to safety, just a few more steps to reach the refuge of the city. However, once inside, he must not leave until the death of the high priest, or the avenger may harm him. When the high priest dies, he can return home in peace. Joshua, an elderly man, gathers the Israelites and reminds them to be courageous, obey the laws, and love God. He warns them of the consequences of turning away from God. Joshua emphasizes that God always fulfills His promises and warns against straying from His teachings. After Joshua's death, the Israelites faced challenges but were saved by judges like Othniel and Samuel. Gideon, another judge, sought signs from God before leading the Israelites to victory against the Midianites.|"[""1. What is the main idea of the text?\nA. The man's escape from danger\nB.

In the Bible, the story of Gideon and Samson teaches us about faith and consequences. Gideon, with only three hundred men, defeated a vast army of Midianites through God's help. By using trumpets, lamps, and faith, they triumphed. On the other hand, Samson, known for his immense strength, fell into sin and lost his power. His hair, the source of his strength, was cut off, leading to his downfall and capture by the Philistines. Despite his mistakes, Samson's final act of strength brought down the Philistine temple, ending his life tragically. In another tale, Ruth's loyalty to her mother-in-law Naomi exemplifies unwavering devotion and faith. Ruth's heartfelt pledge to stay by Naomi's side showcases the power of love and commitment, as seen in the Book of Ruth.|"[""1.

"When Naomi returned to Bethlehem, she was poor. The poor were allowed to gather leftover corn during harvest. One day, Ruth got permission to glean in the field of a rich man named Boaz, who was a relative of Elimelech. Boaz saw Ruth gleaning and asked about her. Ruth didn't know Boaz was related to her. Boaz kindly told Ruth to stay in his field to glean. He was impressed by her kindness to Naomi. Boaz instructed his workers to leave extra grain for Ruth. Ruth gathered a lot of barley that day and took it home to Naomi. She later learned that Boaz was her kinsman. Ruth continued to glean until the end of harvest. She eventually married Boaz and became the grandmother of Jesse, David's father. Jesus Christ descended from David. Hannah, wife of Elkanah, prayed at the Tabernacle for a son. Eli, the high priest, mistook her prayer for drunkenness. Hannah explained her sorrow to Eli, who then blessed her. Hannah left the Tabernacle with hope. God granted her prayer, and she gave birth to a son named Samuel, meaning ""Heard of God."""|"[""1.

Each year, Elkanah and Hannah traveled to Shiloh to offer sacrifices. When Samuel was old enough, Hannah brought him to Eli, the high priest, and dedicated him to the Lord. Samuel assisted Eli in the Tabernacle wearing a linen ephod. Hannah visited Samuel annually, bringing him a little coat she had made. Eli, an old man, had two wicked sons whom he did not discipline. One night, while Samuel was sleeping, he heard a voice calling him. Thinking it was Eli, Samuel went to him, but Eli had not called. After the voice called Samuel three times, Eli realized it was the Lord calling Samuel. Samuel obeyed and received a message from God about the consequences of Eli's sons' sins. Later, during a war with the Philistines, the Israelites were defeated, and the ark of the covenant was taken. When Eli heard this news, he fell and died, fulfilling God's judgment.|"['1.

"In the Bible, not much is said about David's early life. He was born in Bethlehem, his father is known, but his mother's name remains a mystery. The name David means ""beloved,"" reflecting the love he received from his parents and God. As a shepherd in Canaan, David was known for his fair and open face, skilled in music and slinging stones. He bravely defended his flock by defeating a lion and a bear. An important event occurred when the prophet Samuel anointed David with oil, declaring him the future King of Israel. David's musical talents soothed King Saul, who later grew jealous and attempted to harm him. Despite Saul's jealousy, David remained unharmed. As the armies of Israelites and Philistines faced each other, a giant named Goliath challenged the Israelites, but no one dared to fight him."|"['1.

"Jesse sent David to check on his brothers in the Israelites' camp. David overheard the giant's challenge and bravely offered to face him. King Saul learned of David's courage and summoned him. Despite Saul's doubts, David trusted in the Lord's protection based on past experiences. Saul granted David permission, saying, ""Go, and may the Lord be with you."" David, armed with a sling and a stone, defeated the giant Goliath. This victory led to David becoming king, gaining wealth, and establishing his rule over Israel and Judah. However, David later committed a grave sin by taking Uriah's wife and orchestrating Uriah's death. The prophet Nathan confronted David through a parable, leading David to repent before God. Despite God's forgiveness, consequences followed, including a plague that afflicted Israel due to David's decision to count the people. David's remorse led him to make a sacrifice to God at Araunah's threshing-floor, seeking forgiveness and mercy."|"[""1.

God was unhappy with King Ahab, so He sent the prophet Elijah to deliver a message. Elijah told Ahab that there would be no rain in Israel for years. Knowing this would anger Ahab, God instructed Elijah to hide by the brook Cherith. There, ravens brought him food and water. When the brook dried up, God directed Elijah to a widow in Zarephath. The widow had very little food left, but Elijah assured her it would not run out until rain returned. The widow trusted him and miraculously, there was always enough food for them. In the Bible, there are stories of farmers and their work. Ploughing, sowing, reaping, and winnowing are common tasks. The picture shows an Eastern farmer ploughing with small oxen and a simple plough. Their method was slow, and poor harvests were common unless the land was good. Farmers often had to wait for rain to soften the ground, as mentioned in the proverb about the sluggard who refuses to work in cold weather. Elisha, who later became Elijah's successor, was called while ploughing with oxen, similar to those in the picture.|['1.

However, tragedy struck when the boy fell ill and died suddenly while working in the fields. The mother sought Elisha's help, and through his prayers, the boy was restored to life. Another tale tells of Naaman, a Syrian general suffering from leprosy. A young Israelite girl suggested he seek Elisha's help for a cure. Initially reluctant, Naaman followed Elisha's instructions and was healed after washing seven times in the Jordan River.

God instructed Jonah to go to Nineveh and warn the people about their impending doom. Reluctantly, Jonah obeyed and delivered the message. The Ninevites, upon hearing Jonah's warning, repented and sought forgiveness from God. Witnessing their change, God spared the city. However, Jonah was displeased by this outcome. In a separate incident, King Hezekiah of Judah prepared his city for an attack by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Despite threats, Hezekiah sought God's help through the prophet Isaiah. God assured Hezekiah of protection, and that night, the Assyrian army suffered a great loss. Sennacherib returned to Nineveh, where he was killed by his own sons. In Babylon, Hebrew youths Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah refused the king's food to remain faithful to God. Their commitment and wisdom earned them favor and distinction.|"[""1.

When Darius became king after Belshazzar's death, he appointed 120 princes and three presidents, with Daniel as the first. Jealous of Daniel's integrity and faithfulness, the other officials plotted against him for praying to God. They deceived King Darius into signing a law that forbade praying to anyone but the King for 30 days, punishable by being thrown into a den of lions. Despite the law, Daniel continued to pray. His enemies reported this to the King, who, regretting his decision, tried to find a way to save Daniel. However, the law could not be changed, and Daniel was thrown into the den. Miraculously, God sent an angel to shut the lions' mouths, saving Daniel. In another kingdom, Queen Esther risked her life by approaching King Ahasuerus unsummoned to plead for her people, the Jews, who were facing extermination due to a decree by the wicked Haman. Esther's bravery and intervention led to Haman's downfall and the preservation of her people.|['1.
