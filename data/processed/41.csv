"In Sleepy Hollow, Ichabod Crane was the schoolmaster, teaching in a humble log schoolhouse with windows patched with old copybook leaves. The school was cleverly secured with a withe and stakes. Ichabod was a conscientious man who believed in the saying ""Spare the rod and spoil the child."" He was fair but firm, sparing the weak and holding the strong accountable. After school, he was a companion to the boys and helped out at the farms where he stayed. Ichabod was also the singing-master and took pride in leading the church choir. He was well-liked by the community, especially the ladies, for his erudition and gossip-carrying skills.

One of Ichabod Crane's favorite pastimes was spending winter evenings with elderly Dutch women, listening to their spooky tales of ghosts and goblins. They would spin by the fire with apples roasting, sharing stories of haunted places. Ichabod enjoyed recounting witchcraft anecdotes and terrifying omens from Connecticut's past. Despite the cozy setting, his walk home was always filled with fear. The snowy night cast eerie shadows, making him dread every sound and movement. The howling wind seemed like the Galloping Hessian approaching. Amidst these nightly terrors, Katrina Van Tassel caught Ichabod's eye.

The farmhouse was a picture of abundance and contentment, with a barn bursting with farm treasures and happy animals.

"The teacher's hair stood on end with fear. What should he do? It was too late to run, and how could he escape a ghost that rode on the wind? Summoning courage, he asked, ""Who are you?""
