"""I'm glad he ventured out,"" he remarked after a pause, ""as I've witnessed many things I'd never have seen if I stayed home, and I've picked up your language. But I'm not sure if I prefer it to home. Things are different, you see. It was livelier back home. My father had a couple of apprentices I used to play with after the shop closed. Sometimes there were what you'd call commotions, but nothing serious. Occasionally, there were scuffles between apprentices from different wards. They'd shout 'Clubs!' and all the apprentices would grab their sticks and spill out of the shops, leading to a scuffle until the city guard intervened. Then there were archery contests, shows, Mayday festivities, and more. People were merrier than here and much freer. The barons, equivalent to your noble families, had no sway in the city. You're a nation of traders, and so are we; but in London, traders hold the power, ruling within their walls without regard for the barons or the king. If someone erred, they faced a fair public trial. No fear of clandestine accusations. Everyone spoke their mind freely. No Lion's Mouth, no Council of Ten.""

""See, that's it,"" his companion chimed in. ""As long as we're guiltless in London, nothing scares us, unlike here where one can't be sure they won't wake up in St. Mark's"|"['1.

The English merchant in Venice found great success beyond his expectations. He made profitable deals with ships coming from captured Genoese merchants or Eastern seaports. Prices in Venice were much lower compared to London. Despite some losses due to pirates, trading brought excellent profits. His honesty and prompt payments made him respected in Venice, where trade was esteemed. Venice had positive relations with England since 1304. Venice's rise was due to its secure island location, thriving trade, and resilient population. The government, a close oligarchy, ensured stability and wise decisions. Venice aimed to protect its interests and prevent neighboring cities from becoming too powerful. The city's success was also its downfall, as strict surveillance led to a spy-filled city and overlooked private crimes.|"[""1.

After spending some time at the Piazzetta, two boys walked into the square of Saint Mark and blended in with the diverse crowd. Nobles in luxurious clothes brushed shoulders with local fishermen. People from various coasts and islands under Venice's rule, like Greeks from Constantinople, Tartar merchants from the Crimea, Tyrians, and Aegean islanders, were present. Among them were mainland fruit and flower vendors, as well as sellers of water and drinks. Matteo Giustiniani, the English boy's companion from a prominent Venetian family, pointed out notable figures to Francis. They recognized Pisani, a respected admiral, and Fiofio Dandolo from a distinguished family. Matteo also identified Ruggiero Mocenigo, who had returned from banishment, sparking a conversation about his controversial past. Francis expressed his disapproval of the privileged being treated differently by the law, to which Matteo explained the nuances of justice in Venice.|"['1.

"""Why naturally?"" Francis replied. ""You belong to a powerful family, Giustiniani, and my father is only a trader, but I don't see that naturally you have any more right to get me stabbed in the back, than I have to get you put out of the way.""

""Naturally perhaps not,"" Matteo laughed; ""but you see it has become a second nature to us here in Venice. But seriously I admit that the present state of things has grown to be a scandal, and that the doings of some of our class ought to be put down with a strong hand.""

""Well, I shall say goodnight now,"" the English boy said. ""My father doesn't like my being out after ten. He keeps up his English habits of shutting up early, and has not learned to turn night into day as you do here in Venice.""

""I didn't think it was quite so late, father; the Piazza is crowded. I really do not think there is one person in Venice who goes to bed so early as we do. It is so pleasant in the moonlight after the heat of the day.""

""That is true enough, Francis, but men are meant to sleep at night and to work in the day.

Since arriving in Venice, Francis had maintained his English habits. His father allowed him to attend the School of Arms, where he learned swordsmanship alongside the sons of nobles. He also took private lessons from retired soldiers and practiced archery on the islets. Rowing had strengthened his muscles, and he often rowed with Giuseppi in the gondola. Despite the Venetian nobles' envy of his skill, Francis enjoyed the physical activity. One day, he joined Mr. Hammond on a gondola trip to Malamocco, where they discussed buying a racing boat. Francis's friend, Matteo, questioned his rowing, but Francis defended his passion for it. Later, he continued his studies, focusing on languages like Latin, French, Italian, and German. His dedication to physical and intellectual pursuits set him apart in Venice.|"['1.

That evening, Francis and Giuseppi inspected a gondola across the lagoon. It was light and perfect for Francis, who admired its speed and ease in the water. After a trial run, Francis bought the gondola. His father gave him money to fit in with his peers, but Francis wasn't interested in fancy things. He preferred spending time on the water with Giuseppi. They found their gondolas side by side by nightfall, secured behind painted posts. Francis' father was glad he had his own boat now, as it had been missing a few times. He allowed Francis to stay out on the water until late, as long as he promised to be back before half past nine and to be careful when coming home.|"['1.

Francis was delighted with the new agreement. Having to return by ten o'clock had been bothersome, especially when the weather was perfect and the Grand Canal bustling. The rule against being out in Venice after half past nine didn't bother him; he didn't find joy in wandering the crowded Piazza. One evening, while rowing on the Grand Canal, Francis asked Matteo about two passing ladies, distant cousins Maria and Giulia Polani. Matteo shared that their father, a wealthy merchant, had been living in Corfu. The sisters, heiresses without brothers, were likely to attract suitors due to their wealth. Matteo mentioned that Maria's choices for marriage might be influenced by family politics rather than personal preference, a common plight for those born into noble families. Francis admired Maria's beauty and wealth, noting that such qualities rarely coincided. He also shared that he and Giuseppi could row swiftly, even outpacing most gondolas, which sometimes led to interesting encounters with passengers seeking a ride.|"[""1.

The long row to San Nicolo, a sandy islet, intrigued Francis due to curiosity. A masked nobleman hired him and Giuseppi for a secretive night trip. Francis sensed an adventure and potential mystery. Despite Giuseppi's concerns about getting involved in dangerous plots, Francis was determined to uncover the nobleman's motives. As they reached San Nicolo, the nobleman hurried off, leaving Francis eager to unravel the mystery. Giuseppi worried about the risks, but Francis was determined to investigate further. The possibility of a state secret intrigued him, despite the potential dangers. Francis believed they could outmaneuver any pursuers on the water and remain safe once back in Venice.

Francis decided to explore the mysterious plot further. Despite the risks, he felt a duty to Venice's welfare. Late at night, a stranger boarded their gondola, and Francis swiftly rowed away from pursuers. Dodging through canals, they outmaneuvered the galley, impressing the stranger. The next days, Francis pondered his next move. With Giuseppi's tacit approval, he planned to return to San Nicolo to uncover the conspiracy. Francis believed that even if caught, his story would clear him of any wrongdoing. The ten ducats he earned fueled Giuseppi's dreams of a better future.

Francis and Matteo discussed the dangerous situation involving Ruggiero and Polani. Ruggiero's powerful connections could harm Polani, including hiring someone to attack him. Francis found the private feuds and potential violence detestable. Matteo argued that such conflicts were common among powerful nobles, even worse in other countries where wars caused more suffering. Francis acknowledged the complexity but still found the private vendettas in Venice unacceptable. Matteo highlighted the lack of fairness in such disputes and mentioned the possibility of hiring assassins on both sides. Despite the distaste for the Venetian ways, Francis realized they were less harmful than feudal wars. Later, while rowing a gondola, Giuseppi, their passenger, cleverly evaded questions about their living arrangements, showcasing his shrewdness and adaptability.|['1.

Giuseppi, a poor lad, couldn't write in figures but could read them to keep time with customers. He agreed to meet his employer at the base of the palace column in the Piazzetta. Francis, following him barefoot, saw Giuseppi meet two others at a deserted hut. Francis quietly made a hole in the hut's door to eavesdrop.

Francis peeked through the hole he had carefully made in the wall of the hut. Inside, twelve men sat around a table, some familiar faces among them. Francis recognized a few men from good families, including two council members. Despite straining to hear, he couldn't make out the conversation. After covering his tracks, Francis bored another hole to see the faces of those he couldn't see before. Among them was Ruggiero Mocenigo and a stranger, likely Hungarian. Realizing the danger of meddling in a plot, Francis decided to retreat to his boat. He reflected on the risks involved in uncovering a conspiracy and decided to stay away from further involvement. As he made his way back to Venice, he pondered the potential consequences of his discoveries.|"[""1.

"Francis had initially treated the matter as a mere childish whim. However, realizing the gravity of the situation and the potential danger it posed to many lives, he decided to distance himself from it. Giuseppi, relieved by Francis' choice to no longer involve himself in the conspiracy at San Nicolo, had been losing sleep over the past few nights, haunted by nightmares of imprisonment and death. He was more concerned for Francis, fearing the wrath of the conspirators on his employer rather than on himself, a mere gondolier following orders.

In the following days, Francis frequented the Piazza of Saint Mark, recognizing the individuals from the hut and gathering information about them. As a precaution, he documented the events of the meetings and stored the account securely. Francis shared his actions with Giuseppi, instructing him on what to do if anything were to happen to him. Despite the potential risks, Francis was hesitant to betray the conspirators, feeling uneasy about secret accusations. He decided to avoid late outings in the gondola to minimize the chances of being recognized. Giuseppi later discovered that inquiries had been made about a gondola rowed by two brothers, Giovanni and Beppo, offering a reward for information.

Francis Hammond felt uneasy but impressed as he entered the grand Council chamber. The room was adorned with stunning decorations and paintings depicting Venice's wars. The ceiling was beautifully painted, and the cornices were gilded. Eleven councillors, wearing scarlet robes with ermine trim, sat around a horseshoe-shaped table, with the doge leading the meeting. Signor Polani and his companions faced the table. Francis was brought forward after a gondolier testified about an attack. Francis explained how he recognized the daughters of Signor Polani during the incident. The doge commended Francis for his quick and courageous actions. The doge then accused Ruggiero Mocenigo of attempting to abduct Signor Polani's daughters and killing three of his servants.

Francis expressed his concerns, stating that he doubted there was much hope of him coming up with any new ideas that Signor hadn't already considered. He believed it was unlikely the missing individuals were in the city, speculating they might be held by Mocenigo's agents. Signor agreed, adding that Mocenigo probably intended to join them once he knew they were safe. Signor's timely arrival had likely disrupted Mocenigo's plans. They discussed the challenge of locating the missing girls and agreed to spread news of a reward in fishing villages. Signor planned to have men watch Mocenigo's house to prevent any escape attempts.

Francis spent the following week mainly in his gondola, rowing across to the mainland villages and talking to fishermen for any leads on his missing daughters. Despite his efforts, he found no clues. One evening, he spotted a veiled woman in a passing gondola, whom he recognized. With his assistant Giuseppi, they decided to follow the gondola discreetly to see where it would lead. However, the gondola they were following had disappeared by the time they tried to catch up. Francis then steered his gondola back to where he had last seen the mysterious boat.|['1.

An hour passed before any movement was seen. Francis heard footsteps, saw figures entering a gondola. The boat moved to the canal's center. Francis stayed close to the houses' shade. The boat they followed passed under the Ponto Maggiore and along the Grand Canal. The gondola went the canal's length, then near Saint Mark's, by a larger gondola. The boats paused, exchanged words. The boat they watched turned towards the lagoon. Lighter there, bordered by houses. They may be ensuring they're not followed. A gondola approached, nearly hitting them. They realized they were being chased. The pursuing gondola gained on them. They planned to outmaneuver them. When the pursuing gondola almost caught up, they turned, evading capture. Their pursuers tried to follow but headed towards the Grand Canal instead.|"['1.

The two boys rowed with all their might, pulling ahead of their pursuers by about three boat lengths. They realized they needed to row for their lives, unable to double back and facing a well-handled gondola behind them. Speed was crucial as they raced towards the church steps. Upon reaching land, they sprinted up the steps and dashed away quickly, hearing the gondola crash into their boat. After ensuring they lost their pursuers, they slowed down and discussed their findings. They suspected the girls were held in a hut on San Nicolo, realizing the cleverness of hiding them on the seaward islands.

Francisco shared with the merchant a discovery he made while taking a man to San Nicolo one evening. He revealed that a hut on the island was a meeting spot for several individuals, including Ruggiero Mocenigo. The merchant praised Francisco for his insight, suspecting that his daughters might be held in that hut. Francisco cautioned against immediate action due to potential surveillance. He proposed a plan to approach the island cautiously the next morning, avoiding suspicion. The group would land discreetly, keeping a distance from the hut, and split into teams to search for the girls. The merchant, though anxious, agreed that waiting until morning and executing Francisco's strategy was the wisest course of action.|"['1.

"""I cannot comply, sir, but I will be back promptly.

""Francisco, stay here until daybreak. You can make your way to the Grand Canal, hail a gondola, retrieve the document, and return by seven for our departure unnoticed,"" advised Signor Polani. ""Rest a few hours; we set off at seven. Our plan is to blend in with the fishermen's boats to avoid suspicion.""

At seven, they embarked. Signor Polani led the way in his gondola, joined by Francis and four men. A ship's boat with ten men followed discreetly, ensuring no boats left San Nicolo unnoticed.

Both girls cheered joyfully as they found themselves in a lavishly furnished room at the rear of the hut, adorned with Eastern fabrics on the walls and a lamp hanging from the ceiling. Two men hesitated with swords drawn, surprised by the door giving way, revealing two figures rising from a couch behind them, their heads wrapped in shawls. Overwhelmed with happiness, the figures rushed to meet their saviors. Another woman sat at the end of the couch, her head bowed. After a brief silence filled with tears of joy, the girls embraced their father, expressing gratitude and love. Francis informed the captain, who approached the sitting woman, leading her outside. The father explained that their English friend had orchestrated the rescue, saving his daughter from a forced marriage.

The father and his daughters were held captive underground by their gouvernante, who threatened the girls with forced marriage to Ruggiero Mocenigo. Despite their attempts to escape, they found themselves trapped. Fortunately, Captain Lontano and his men came to their rescue. The merchant, relieved to have found his daughters, ordered the men to secure the area until officials arrived. The girls, visibly shaken, were taken to safety by gondola.

Francis expressed his desire to remain a boy and follow English customs of respecting elders.

But who would have guessed you were hidden at San Nicolo all this time! Francisco played a key role. He used his sharp eyes and quick mind to find the hiding place and rescue us.

Several times they almost made it onto the ship's deck, but we managed to keep them at bay. We lost a third of our crew, and nearly everyone was wounded. I was injured for three months after returning home, with a deep cut on my shoulder that almost took off my arm. However, we saved the ship and its valuable cargo. Messer Polani ensured that no one suffered for their involvement. He is known for his generosity, always able to assemble a skilled crew for his ships. However, there are challenges too. Once, I and my crew were imprisoned in Azoff for six months by the Genoese, who falsely accused us of smuggling. Messer Polani had to pay a fine to secure our release.

According to my calculations, we must be close to the west coast of Mitylene. If the clouds clear, we could see the islands in the Aegean and find our way. We might be heading towards a rocky coast. Let's row to avoid it. If we reach shallow waters, we'll anchor and row to reduce the strain. If we're near Mitylene, there's a safe harbor on this side. After a while, the clouds cleared, and land appeared ahead. We found a passage to a large harbor. The captain went ashore with armed men to trade with the sullen natives. The Genoese and others have a bad reputation here. Venice tries to control the pirates, but they are everywhere. The locals prefer Venice or Genoa over Constantinople. They traded hides and wine for cloth. The island is divided between supporters of Venice and Genoa. Constantinople is weak, and the people fear the rising power of the Turks.|['1.

As the season nears its end, preparations for an upcoming war are in progress at the dockyards, though the conflict is not expected until spring. Venice is struggling to secure allies due to strong opposition, with only Ferrara offering reliable support, albeit limited. Despite a decree of banishment against him, the whereabouts of the individual remain unknown. A woman sentenced to imprisonment will be released early under certain conditions. The matter involving Mocenigo has halted official inquiries, ensuring no further scrutiny. Francis expresses a desire to embark on a sea voyage after completing his studies, preferring the sea over the gaieties of Venice. Polani arranges for Francis and his cousin to sail together as supercargoes on a vessel named Lido, bound for a new destination to procure grain in anticipation of potential wartime shortages.|['1.

The captain was concerned about the possibility of being captured by the Genoese. To avoid unnecessary risks, he decided to send most of the crew ashore, leaving only a few men on board. The captain assured the crew that they had papers as peaceful traders, but if they were captured, they would have to take their chances. Despite the crew's concerns for his safety, the captain insisted on staying on board to fulfill his duty. Eventually, they all left the ship with their arms and moved into the country to ensure their safety. The Genoese galleys approached, and the captain cleverly managed to avoid capture by explaining the situation to the Genoese officers. The crew and the ship were spared, thanks to the captain's quick thinking and strategic actions.|"[""1.

Francis and his group followed the coastline, climbing the steep hills near the sea. They camped by a cliff, overlooking the port where Genoese galleys were observed. Fires were lit, and meals were prepared as the captain and sailors joined them. The captain expressed concerns about losing the ship and being labeled unlucky. He explained the risks of trying to reclaim the ship and the consequences of being caught. After the meal, Francis, Matteo, and Giuseppi walked along the cliffs, reaching a point where rocks protruded from the bay. Matteo couldn't understand Francis's fascination with the rocks, questioning the purpose of examining them.

Giuseppi and Matteo discussed how to hide their ship, the Lido, from the Genoese by maneuvering it behind some rocks. Matteo, initially reluctant, was impressed by the plan and eager to proceed. They found a safe way down the cliff to the water and prepared to measure its depth. Using long rods, they descended easily and reached the water's edge, ready to assess if the plan to conceal the ship would work. Matteo was relieved by the simple path down, considering the advantage it would provide in case of discovery. They were now focused on determining the water's depth to finalize their strategy.|"['1.

"Matteo was astonished when he returned, ""I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't seen it,"" he said. He suspected that their companion might have fallen into a deep hole among the rocks. The three friends swam out to the rocks, which towered above the sea. The water deepened quickly, and they couldn't touch the bottom. They tested the depth at the end of the rocks and found enough water for their boat, the Lido. Satisfied, they swam back to shore. They planned to return before dark, depending on whether the Lido had been moved. Giuseppi was to light a fire as a signal. They discussed their strategy quietly, aiming to retrieve the Lido without attracting attention from the Genoese galleys."|"['1.

The expedition details were discussed and arranged. At eleven o'clock at night, the party left the bivouac and headed to the port. The town was silent as they marched through the empty streets. They chose a small boat with the captain, Francis, Matteo, and two sailors. Quietly, they approached the ship without being noticed. They seized two Genoese men on deck, bound and gagged them. Next, they secured the forecastle hatch, captured two officers in the cabins, and signaled for the sailors waiting in boats. The ship was quietly set in motion, sails raised without a sound. The captain ensured their escape by using the wind to their advantage.

The flames rose high as the captain skillfully steered the vessel behind the rocks. A kedge was dropped, and the crew rescued Giuseppi. Relieved, Giuseppi joined them on deck, explaining his initial confusion with their signal. The captain strategized about the masts, considering the grain cargo's obstacle. They decided to cut the masts shorter to fit the hold. The Genoese invaders surrendered and were secured in the hold. The crew prepared for potential pursuit, with sentinels on watch. As dawn broke, they readied for swift departure, anticipating the Genoese galleys' arrival. The captain reassured them, confident in their concealment.

"""Yes, there is a danger,"" Francis said. ""I suggest landing twenty men at once. Giuseppi will guide them up the cliff. They should hide along the edge of the bay, ready to seize anyone approaching. They must remain hidden to avoid detection by the galleys,"" Francis continued. ""Thomaso, take twenty men and follow these instructions,"" he ordered. After a while, the captain, Matteo, and Francis took over the sentries' positions. They spotted a Genoese galley rowing swiftly. ""They've sent only one galley, knowing it's strong enough to overpower us,"" Francis remarked. The captain planned to sail that night. The crew prepared to hoist the masts after the galley passed. The captain intended to row southwest after dark to escape. They had to take the men with them to prevent being caught.

Francis and the crew of the Lido successfully outwitted the Genoese and sailed back to Venice. The men rowed the boats out through the channel, hoisted them on board, and set sail. They rowed parallel to the shore to avoid being spotted by Genoese galleys. As the breeze picked up, they hoisted the sails and enjoyed song and camaraderie. The wind carried them swiftly until they reached Venice. Signor Polani was relieved to see Francis return safely, as there were fears of a Genoese fleet. The crew credited Francis for their successful escape, but he humbly shared the merit with Captain Pesoro. Polani invited them to share their adventure over wine with his daughters.|['1.

The captain shared how the Genoese fleet appeared suddenly, leaving him with only four sailors after sending the rest ashore. Polani remarked on the Genoese's behavior, noting their desire to take more prisoners. Fearing the crew might be handed over to the Genoese or fights could break out, the captain led them away from Girgenti. Francis, showing keen observation, led the captain to a ledge of rocks, saving the Lido. Venice was in turmoil as war with Genoa was declared. Vettore Pisani was entrusted with Venice's defense. Carlo Zeno, a respected noble, was appointed commissioner. Pisani set sail with fourteen war galleys. Pisani, known for his popularity and hearty manner, prepared to defend Venice against Genoa's insult. Despite being offered a position by Pisani, Francis was advised by Polani to remain in commerce for now, as Venice's citizens served the state during wartime, returning to peaceful pursuits afterward.|"['1.

The captain and Messer Francisco discussed their risky situation near Genoa. They learned that Fieschi's fleet was in the bay of Antium, a few miles away. They debated whether to sail closer to Genoa, risking capture, or to stay further out to sea. They decided to anchor near the shore due to the bad weather.

In the turbulent sea, the Bonito struggled as rival admirals sought battle. Francis proposed edging closer for a view, not to engage with their hundred men against the larger galleys. Amidst the clash of archers and machines hurling stones, the combat raged. Grappling was impossible; the ships risked destruction. With neither side gaining advantage until a Venetian galley lost its mast, the tide turned. The Bonito's crew, armed and eager, cut free to join the fray. Genoese galleys closed in on Pisani's ship, entangling in a fierce struggle. The crew, led by Pisani wielding a battleaxe, fought back against the overwhelming adversary.|"['1.

Even though he struggled with the lower fastenings of the chain, he managed to cut the rivets at the wrists, freeing one end of each chain.

Testing the stone on the wall, he saw progress. He then searched for stone pieces, finding some near the door. With these, he worked all day, dampening the stone to rub against the rivets.

Despite facing a severe frost and harsh conditions, Francis showed exceptional care for his crew.

Francis paid little attention to the officers' animosity towards him, knowing it stemmed from jealousy. Despite being a foreigner and younger than them, he had received a promotion and the republic's gratitude for his services. Even those against him pretended to be polite due to reports of his fencing skills. The search for the Genoese fleet was fruitless for three months until Doria's appearance with twenty-five ships. Pisani, hesitant to fight due to Zeno's absence and sickness among his men, was overruled by civilian commissioners. Forced into battle, Pisani rallied his men, but the fight turned against them. After a fierce conflict, the Genoese feigned retreat, then ambushed the Venetians, leading to a decisive defeat. Pisani managed to escape to Parenzo with a few galleys.|"[""1.

During the fierce battle between the Venetians and the Genoese, many lives were lost, and numerous were taken as prisoners. The Genoese, too, suffered heavy losses, including their commander Doria. The Pluto, valiantly defended by its crew, was eventually overpowered by the Genoese who took them captive. The wounded were left unattended, suffering from thirst until some water barrels were discovered in the hold. The prisoners were finally ordered on deck the next morning, with many succumbing to their wounds during the night. The young officer in command of the Pluto impressed the Genoese with his bravery and skill in battle. As tensions rose among the captors, the fate of the prisoners hung in the balance. Despite the grim circumstances, hope for escape flickered among the captives, buoyed by the solidarity of their numbers.|['1.

Francis and his comrades found themselves in a dire situation, captured and held in the hold of a vessel. Despite the challenges they faced, Francis remained determined to escape. His companions, recognizing his leadership and experience, elected him as their captain. Francis wasted no time and proposed a plan to retake their ship, the Pluto, from the Genoese captors. He was confident in their numerical advantage and the likelihood that the enemy was weakened from the recent battle. With a strategic approach, Francis believed they could overpower the Genoese and reclaim their ship. The group agreed to support Francis's plan, eager to regain their freedom.

"Paolo Parucchi, an officer on the Pluto, agreed, ""They are fifty armed men, and we are a hundred and fifty unarmed, trapped in the hold, cut off from our crew.

Two cuts were made under each bolt, wide at the base and converging towards it. The saws were kept going all day, although progress was slow, it was enough to encourage them. Just as the light faded, three young men hung their weight on a bolt, and the wood beneath it gave way with a cry of satisfaction. The iron pieces were two feet long, intended for another purpose but were driven in as pegs. They decided to continue working to get more tools. The work was fatiguing, but necessary. They planned to use the irons as levers to wrench out the planks. Despite the challenges, they made progress in the dark and used the irons to speed up the process when the crew above began washing the decks. They discussed breakfast and a method to relieve stiffness. They found a way to remove planks easily using the irons as levers.|['1.

Messer Hammond led the crew in a daring escape plan. They worked in silence, cutting through planks to free themselves. Francis, the brave captain, guided the crew with stealth.

Matteo and his fellow prisoner quietly worked on cutting through the planks of the ship, ensuring absolute silence. They waited for a stormy night when the noise of the wind and water would cover any sound they made. The sailors, armed and ready, awaited Francis's signal. With precision, the planks were removed, and the men armed themselves. Francis instructed them to stand quietly until further orders. Once the planks were removed, Francis peered into the cabin above. Seeing it empty, he knew it was time to make their move.

Francis signaled the others to raise him to the deck above. He crawled underneath the divan and waited for Parucchi and Matteo to join him. When they were all ready, they rolled out with daggers in hand, ready to confront the captain. Finding the cabin empty, they gathered more men. Francis instructed them to knock down the crew with sword hilts and avoid bloodshed. They quietly made their way to the deck. With about thirty men, they prepared to overpower the officers.

The Pluto had prisoners below deck. Once they retook the ship, the crew would return to their own ship, leaving fifty men in charge. They were to secure the Genoese and free any prisoners. The Pluto edged closer to the other ship, the crew eager to recover their lost galley. They lashed the ships together, and without much resistance, the Venetians took control of the enemy vessel.

The strong wind continued for several hours. The Pluto ship faced it head-on, using its mast as an anchor. Once the lights of the Genoese ships faded, Francis raised a lantern on his mast to signal the other ships to stay close. At dawn, they spotted the galley they had recaptured nearby and two others further away. The wind calmed down after sunrise, and the crew worked hard to bring the mast on board. Despite the rough sea, they managed to secure it in place. Parucchi's vessel joined them, and they all raised their banners in triumph. Francis expressed satisfaction but felt they could have captured more ships if not for the storm.

During the voyage back to Venice, no enemy ships were spotted. Francis was in charge of the small fleet as the other officers had been moved to another ship. They were cautious as they neared Venice, fearing Doria's fleet might be blocking the port. Fortunately, the Genoese fleet was busy capturing Venetian ports in Dalmatia. The ships entered Venice with their flags waving, causing immense joy among the people. Relatives and friends of those captured at the Battle of Polo surrounded the ships. Francis, the senior officer, planned to report to the council. Matteo suggested they reveal the truth about the recapture of the ships.

Upon leaving the ship, Messer Polani sent a boat to inform his family of Francis's return. When they returned home, Giulia anxiously awaited them. Shortly after, Matteo arrived with his brother Rufino and Maria. Maria greeted Francis more warmly than Giulia, praising his energy, determination, and steadfastness. Matteo explained how Francis's calm approach to challenges inspired them to recapture the Pluto ship. Maria admitted she had underestimated Francis's intelligence and common sense. Messer Polani informed Francis that his loyal man Giuseppi had returned. Maria teased Francis good-naturedly about his quick departure upon hearing the news.

"""I need no thanks, my lad. I am still, and shall always remain, your debtor. You have very much more than fulfilled my expectations, and I shall be glad to place some of the burden of my business upon your shoulders.""

Thus, then, the three hundred ducats, which you will receive each year from the state, may not be needed by you. Still, you are to be congratulated upon the grant, because being the recipient of a pension, for distinguished services, will add to your weight and influence in the city. And so long as you do not need it--and no man can say what may occur, in the course of years, to hinder the trade of Venice--you can bestow the sum annually upon the poor of the city, and thus increase your popularity.

""I shall be happy to do that, signor,"" Francis said, ""although it seems to me that popularity is of little value in Venice. It has not saved the man whom, a short time since, the people hailed as their father, from unmerited disgrace and imprisonment.""

""It has not, Francisco, but it has saved his life. You may take my word for it, that the proposal, absolutely made in the council, for the execution of Pisani, would have been voted had it not been for fear of the people; and it may be that you will yet see, that the voice of the people will bring Pisani from his prison, long before the expiration"|"['1.

Unfortunately, at Brondolo, the channel remained open. All arrangements were in place to close it, but the task was delayed until the last minute to allow trading ships to enter and exit the harbor. The Chioggians believed they would receive ample warning of an approaching enemy to seal off the entrance in time. However, Doria's fleet's sudden arrival disrupted these plans, and the Genoese easily took control. Little Chioggia fell swiftly, but the bridge over the canal was fiercely defended by Pietro Emo and his 3,500 soldiers. The Genoese bombarded the Venetian garrison, and a fierce cannonade ensued for three days. Despite reinforcements from Venice, the city remained on edge. If Chioggia fell, the consequences would be dire. The Hungarians had already invaded Venetian territories on the mainland, and the city faced isolation and potential starvation. Polani took precautions, hiding valuables and preparing to evacuate his family by sea if needed. Francis, with his strong belief in Pisani's leadership, urged for his return to command the fleet. He joined the crowds gathering at Saint Mark's to demand Pisani's reinstatement.|"['1.

"Anxiety filled the faces of the citizens as the doge and council appeared on the balcony. A hush fell over the crowd as the doge, Contarini, addressed them. ""Citizens, brace yourselves for the news I bring. Chioggia has fallen,"" he announced. Despite the valiant defense led by Emo, an unforeseen accident led to the town's capture. The crowd reacted with anguish, fearing Venice was now vulnerable. The council and nobles tried to reassure the people, urging them not to lose hope.

The leader addressed the Genoese prisoners, declaring they were free and would be released soon. The assembly was called, and urgent measures were discussed to defend the city. A new captain was elected, and fortifications were quickly erected. However, the people grew restless, feeling a stronger leader was needed. The crowd demanded the release of Vettore Pisani, a popular figure. After heated debates, Pisani was freed and appointed. The next morning, Pisani, with his usual cheerfulness, was carried in triumph to the palace. The council and Pisani then held discussions. The joyful crowd celebrated Pisani's freedom as he was carried home. Along the way, his old pilot, Marino Corbaro, cheered and shouted loudly in his honor.|"['1.

"Now is the moment, Admiral, to seek retribution by taking control of this city. Everyone is ready to support you. They are all prepared to declare you ruler if you so wish."" Pisani's loyalty was so offended by this proposal that he lashed out in anger, striking Corbaro with his fist. He then raised his voice to those around him: Once Pisani arrived home, news spread that he had only been made governor of Lido, while Giustiniani remained in charge of the navy. The people were outraged. A group of 600 approached Pisani, stating that no one would sail until he was appointed as the general of all the republic's forces. The Council of Ten, fearing unrest, eventually agreed. Luckily, the enemy had not taken advantage of the four days between Chioggia's fall and Pisani's appointment. Carrara and Doria disagreed on their next move. Carrara wanted to attack Venice, while Doria preferred a slower approach. Doria advanced outposts, setting up a battery near Venice.

After Pisani took command, he swiftly focused on fortifying Venice. The city's forty galleys were readied for action in just three days. The people eagerly signed up to serve, even offering their jewels to fund the cause. Pisani inspected the defenses Giustiniani had built and found them inadequate. He replaced useless wooden towers with sturdy stone ones, despite Giustiniani's objections. Pisani's determination rallied the workers, and within four days, the new towers were completed. Stone walls were then erected from Lido to San Spirito. Pisani distributed commands wisely, even entrusting Giustiniani with a fleet.

Francis had a challenging role in the office under the active admiral. He had to constantly move around to ensure everything was progressing well and report back on the work. The tasks were ongoing day and night, and for the initial week, neither Francis nor his commander rested, only grabbing bits of sleep when they could. After wasting eight days, the enemy launched an attack on August 24th. Genoese forces landed on San Nicolo, while Paduans attacked San Spirito and Santa Marta. The Venetians were prepared and swiftly gathered to defend, pushing back the enemy with heavy losses. The enemy tried to regroup, but Cornaro's galleys blocked their path, thwarting their plans. Despite the setback, the enemy persisted until early October before retreating. The suffering in Venice was severe, with the city cut off from the mainland.

Seventy-five individuals stepped up, offering various forms of support for the upcoming expedition. Efforts were immense, resulting in the preparation of sixty ships, four hundred boats, and thirty-four war galleys by December 21. The doge, despite being seventy-three years old, expressed his desire to lead the expedition, with Pisani as his lieutenant and admiral. Francis, busy with his duties, spent little time with the Polanis. Maria had returned home as her husband was stationed near the enemy. Despite the dire situation, Maria and Giulia remained cheerful. Polani's ships were aiding the state, while the repaired gondola was put to use for reconnaissance missions. Pisani tasked Francis with gathering crucial information on enemy positions, emphasizing the importance of success to boost troop morale.

Francis and Maria discussed their strategy against the Genoese galleys. Francis proposed a plan to trap the enemy by closing off the canals around Chioggia. Maria praised Pisani's leadership and expressed concerns about the risks involved. Despite the challenges, Francis was determined to carry out the mission assigned to him by the admiral. He acknowledged the importance of the task for Venice and the need for accurate information about the enemy's positions. With the help of Giuseppi and local fishermen, Francis studied the map to understand the area better. Meanwhile, the Genoese, feeling overconfident, had let their guard down, assuming the Venetians posed no threat. This negligence left them vulnerable to a surprise attack.|"[""1.

Rufino, speaking calmly, observed the lack of commotion among the ships. He noted the presence of booms in the channels after Barberigo's actions. Rowboats were constructing something, likely a boom. The plan was to pass unnoticed as Chioggian fishermen. Supper was served with freshly caught fish and good wine. They rowed silently across the water, avoiding detection by Genoese galleys.

Pisani led the first division with fourteen galleys, the doge commanded the center, and Corbaro brought up the rear with ten large ships. The night was calm and bright as the fleet departed, observed by the people of Venice. Pisani feared a scattered approach would ruin their plan against the Genoese. Fortunately, the fog lifted, allowing the Venetians to regroup and reach the channel entrances. Despite facing overwhelming Genoese forces and heavy casualties, Pisani's sailors managed to block the channels with stones and ships, thwarting the enemy's advance. The men endured harsh conditions and intense fighting, but their perseverance paid off as they successfully sealed off the Genoese galleys from the sea, achieving their goal after four grueling days.|"[""1.

A fort was under construction on the southern shore of the port of Brondolo, facing the convent turned citadel by Doria, named the Lova. The Venetians mounted their heaviest guns like the Trevisan, firing stones of nearly two hundred pounds. Despite the limitations of artillery at the time, the Venetians persevered. On the 29th, weary officers, soldiers, and sailors demanded to return to Venice. Pisani, feeling the strain, rallied them, promising to lift the siege if Zeno didn't arrive by New Year's Day. As the 30th passed with little fighting, hope dwindled. On the 31st, eyes scanned the horizon for Zeno's sails, but none appeared. Despair crept in, yet the Venetians found solace in the thought of returning home, ready to face whatever fate awaited them.|"['1.

In a few minutes, fast galleys set out towards the distant fleet. It would take some time before they returned with news. Pisani, along with the doge, encouraged the men to stay strong and not panic if the newcomers turned out to be enemies. Pisani assured them that if they acted calmly, they could retreat to Venice safely. The boats were instructed to hoist white flags if they were Venetian, but no signal if they were Genoese. After a tense wait, the boats were seen returning. Francisco was tasked to watch for the signal. When the boats were confirmed as allies, joy erupted among the troops and sailors. Zeno, intercepted by a Venetian galley, was greeted warmly by the crowd upon his arrival. His appearance was described, and his background as a scholar and adventurer was recounted.|"['1.

On February 28th, he was made the chief general of the land forces. The next day, he forced the Genoese from their positions on the islands of Brondolo and Little Chioggia. He set up his headquarters under the ramparts of Chioggia and launched a fierce attack on the citadel. As the Genoese retreated over the bridge, it collapsed under their weight, causing many to drown. The Genoese left behind a huge amount of weapons and armor, which were sold cheaply in the Venetian camp. The Venetians, not wanting to risk failure, imposed a strict blockade, cutting off supplies to the city. Despite this, the besieged were allowed to send their families to Venice. The Venetian army was reinforced by troops from Milan and Sir John Hawkwood's Condottieri. The Venetian fleet joined the siege after removing the dikes blocking the channels. On May 14th, the Genoese fleet arrived to aid Chioggia, challenging the Venetians to battle. However, the Venetians, led by Pisani, refused to engage, knowing that Chioggia's fall was imminent. Despite repeated challenges and taunts, Pisani held his ground. Eventually, the Genoese fleet retreated without a fight. Despair grew among the Chioggia garrison as their situation worsened.
