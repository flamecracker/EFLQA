For over three centuries, European trading nations faced the threat of piracy in the Mediterranean. From the fearless Barbarossa challenging Emperor Charles V to the Algerine rovers seizing prizes under the watch of European fleets, the Corsairs ruled the seas and dictated terms to all. Only the development of modern navies and the conquest of their coastal strongholds subdued them. Throughout this period, they extorted tribute from Mediterranean traders, with nations like Venice, Genoa, England, France, and the United States paying for protection. Resisting meant enslavement in Algiers. It wasn't until the Congress of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818, following the Napoleonic wars, that a united front was formed to end this menace. France's territorial ambitions and civilizing efforts finally brought an end to the age of piracy in the Mediterranean.|['1.

Pirates have a long history in the Mediterranean Sea. Even before the Turks became involved, pirates were a common sight. The Greeks, inspired by tales like Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece, were known for their piracy on both land and sea. The Moslems, however, were slow to embrace the dangers of maritime piracy. Initially, they marveled at the sea's vastness but hesitated to venture into it. Over time, they realized the need to navigate the waters to compete with neighboring powers. The Mohammedan rulers of the Barbary coast began building fleets for both military and trade purposes. The relations between the Barbary coast rulers and Christian trading nations were initially peaceful, with agreements to suppress piracy and promote commerce. However, in the 16th century, the Spanish expulsion of Moors led to retaliatory piracy in the region, marking a shift towards more aggressive maritime activities.|"[""1.

Pirates often sought refuge in the beloved Andalusia, hiding their vessels in rock crevices or buried in the sand. They had friends in Spain who aided them against oppressors and provided shelter when needed. Stealthily, they would raid villages, taking valuables and capturing villagers. Despite their skills and support, capture was a constant risk. If caught, the pirates faced slavery on foreign galleys. To avoid capture, they fortified their Barbary coast strongholds. When Spain finally acted, the pirates surrendered some strongholds but continued piracy elsewhere. Eventually, the Turkish Corsairs took over, following the Moorish pirates' lead. The Barbary region, once part of Europe, provided perfect conditions for piracy. The area, now part of North Africa, was once an island connected to Spain and Sicily. Geographically, it offered ideal conditions for pirates to thrive.|['1.

During the medieval times, the coast of North Africa was a strategic location for Corsairs, pirates who raided passing ships for wealth. The narrow straits of Gibraltar and Malta forced vessels from the outer ocean to pass through, carrying riches from the Western and Eastern worlds. The Barbary coast, forming the southern boundary of the Mediterranean, provided ideal conditions for Corsairs to operate. Natural harbors and inland seas offered shelter and escape routes for the pirates, making it difficult for pursuers to catch them. The region's geography, with steep mountains and fertile valleys, allowed the Corsairs to spot ships from afar and find refuge on land. The area's history of changing rulers, from Arab governors to Berber dynasties, created a complex political landscape that eventually led to the rise of Corsair Pashas and Turkish Beys in Algiers and Tunis.|"['1.

During the rule of African princes, the Christians were allowed to practice their faith without interference. The relations between the rulers of Barbary and European states were marked by wisdom and diplomacy. Treaties were established based on mutual benefits, with Africans providing raw materials to Europe in exchange for European goods. Despite occasional conflicts, the African princes were fair and maintained peace through treaties. Commercial alliances were formed between European states and African rulers, leading to the establishment of trading companies and consulates. The African trade was vital to the economies of Pisa and Genoa. Although piracy persisted despite being prohibited, it was mainly carried out by private individuals rather than with state support. The African and Italian governments disavowed piracy and pledged to punish any Corsair from their countries.|['1.

Until the fourteenth century, Mediterranean piracy was mainly carried out by Christians who traded in stolen goods and slaves. However, the rise of large commercial fleets discouraged piracy among Europeans. Instead, Moorish Corsairs became prominent. The Gulf of Gabes saw a rise in piracy, with Mahdiya becoming a hub for sea rovers. The practice of sending galleys on predatory cruises was noted by El-Bekri in the twelfth century. By the fourteenth century, organized pirate groups were operating in places like Bujeya. The fall of Constantinople and the expulsion of Moors from Spain fueled piracy in Africa. The weak governance in North Africa, combined with the influx of disaffected Moriscos, allowed piracy to thrive. The Barbary coast became a refuge for pirates from the Levant, with ports offering shelter and easy access to the Mediterranean.|['1.

Andrea Doria was sent by the Senate of Genoa to seek reparation for the loss of a galleot. Landing before the Goletta, he drove Kheyr-ed-dīn into Tunis after sacking the fortress. This marked the first meeting between Doria and Kheyr-ed-dīn, leading Kheyr-ed-dīn to leave and focus on shipbuilding. Urūj later joined him, and they attempted to overcome their disgrace by assaulting Bujēya. However, reinforcements from Spain thwarted their efforts. Barbarossa, enraged, set fire to his ships and sought refuge in Jījil, where he gained the support of the inhabitants and was proclaimed their king.

"In 1529, Kheyr-ed-dīn sent his trusted lieutenant ""Drub-Devil"" with galleots to raid Majorca and nearby islands. The Corsair and Sālih Reïs enjoyed capturing Christians for ransom. Hearing of Moriscos seeking to flee Spain, they helped them escape. Pursued by Spanish galleys, the Corsairs fought bravely, defeating them and capturing seven ships. This success led to Algiers' prosperity. Kheyr-ed-dīn then attacked the Spanish garrison at Peñon de Alger, forcing its surrender. He bombarded the fortress, using its stones to build Algiers' harbor defenses. Later, the Corsairs seized a Spanish convoy, gaining captives and supplies.

The rivalry between the Christian States inadvertently aided the Turks due to their jealousy and competition. Genoa and Venice, two powerful commercial republics, vied for dominance at sea. Venice controlled key positions in the Archipelago and on the Syrian coast, while Genoa had influence in the Black Sea and Marmora. The Genoese even had a colony at Galata, resembling an Eastern Genoa. The Sea of Marmora witnessed fierce battles between the rival fleets, with both cities experiencing victories and defeats. Despite initial setbacks, Venice eventually triumphed over Genoa in a decisive battle off Alghero, securing its power. However, the conquest of Constantinople by the Turks marked a turning point, leading to the decline of Genoa's influence in the East. Venice, on the other hand, grew stronger and more dominant, even in the face of Turkish advances.|"['1.

"In July 1499, the Venetian fleet was spotted near Modon, comprising forty-four galleys, sixteen galleasses, and twenty-eight sailboats. Both sides avoided confrontation, aware of the significant outcomes. The Venetian admiral retreated to Navarino, while the Turks anchored off Sapienza. Daūd Pasha, knowing the Sultan awaited him at Lepanto, decided to advance despite the risks. Turkish sailors preferred hugging the shore due to their lack of confidence in the open sea. Daūd attempted to navigate between Prodano Island and Morea, but the Venetians strategically positioned their fleet to intercept. Despite reinforcements from Corfu, the Venetians faced challenges in maneuvering their galleasses during the battle. The Turks gained the upper hand, leading to losses on the Christian side.

During the 16th century, the Ottoman Empire, under the leadership of Suleymān the Magnificent, expanded its naval power by conquering Rhodes and Algiers. The fall of Rhodes marked the Ottoman dominance in the eastern Mediterranean, making Christian ships vulnerable to Ottoman attacks. Meanwhile, the Barbarossa brothers secured control of the western Mediterranean by capturing Algiers and establishing strong garrisons along the Barbary coast. Suleymān recognized the importance of uniting the eastern and western Turkish forces to strengthen their naval capabilities. The formidable Genoese admiral, Andrea Doria, played a crucial role in shaping Mediterranean politics, switching allegiances between France and Charles V to determine the balance of power at sea. Doria's naval prowess made him a feared figure among the Turks and a symbol of Genoese freedom.|['1.

Kheyr-ed-dīn was a renowned figure among both Christians and Turks, much like his rival. He had successfully driven the Spaniards out of Algiers and caused significant damage to the Empire's ships and shores. Despite spending two decades patrolling the same waters, the two never engaged in a naval battle, possibly out of mutual respect. In the past, Doria had defeated Kheyr-ed-dīn and even rescued Christian slaves from his stronghold. However, a subsequent attempt to raid Shershēl ended in disaster for Doria's men, with many killed or captured. Despite these setbacks, Doria later regained his reputation through successful expeditions to Greece. Ultimately, Kheyr-ed-dīn was appointed to lead the Ottoman navy due to his exceptional skills and leadership, transforming the Turkish fleet into a formidable force.|"[""1.

During the 16th century, Barbarossa, a notorious pirate, set his sights on the kingdom of Tunis. The Spanish historians have conflicting accounts of his actions, but one thing is clear: Barbarossa's fleet was a force to be reckoned with. In 1534, he led a fleet of eighty-four galleys, striking fear into the hearts of those along the Italian coasts. He raided Reggio, stormed castles, and captured prisoners. His ultimate target was Giulia Gonzaga, a beautiful widow, whom he intended to take to the Sultan's harem. Despite the chaos he caused, Barbarossa's reign in Tunis was short-lived. Charles V of Spain, seeing the threat Barbarossa posed, launched a massive naval campaign to reclaim Tunis. The siege of Goletta was fierce, but ultimately Barbarossa was forced to retreat. This historical event marked the end of Barbarossa's reign in Tunis and the beginning of a new chapter in the region's history.|"[""1.

For three days, Charles abandoned the city of Tunis to the cruelty of his soldiers, resulting in days of chaos and violence. The troops engaged in brutal acts, massacring men, women, and children in large numbers. They even turned on each other in a frenzy to claim the spoils of war. The once peaceful streets of Tunis turned into scenes of horror and bloodshed. Despite Charles's attempts to establish a treaty with Hasan, the aftermath of the expedition was chaotic. The people of Tunis rejected Hasan for aligning with Spain, leading to his eventual downfall. The expedition, although celebrated in Europe, left a trail of destruction and betrayal in its wake.

When Barbarossa came back to Constantinople, he was given a new title as the High Admiral of the Ottoman fleets instead of being the Beglerbeg of Algiers. His influence had grown stronger since the execution of the Grand Vezīr Ibrahīm. Barbarossa, eager to challenge Venice, a famous maritime nation, was supported by Francis I. This led to tensions between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. The conflict escalated when Venetian galleys attacked a Turkish ship carrying an ambassador, causing war to break out. Barbarossa, with a formidable fleet, ravaged the Apulian coast and besieged Corfu. The siege was intense, but the defenders held strong, leading the Sultan to eventually call off the attack. Barbarossa then went on a destructive campaign throughout the Adriatic and the Archipelago, capturing territories and enslaving thousands. This period of conflict left a trail of devastation in its wake.|"['1.

Suleymān, a brilliant leader, was engaged in three major endeavors during that period. He was waging a campaign in Moldavia, commanding the innovative Suez fleet in the Indian Ocean, and planning to cripple Venice's naval power. In the summer of 1538, Barbarossa set sail with a fleet of 150 ships, seizing rowers and tribute from the islands under Turkish control. Despite facing a formidable Christian alliance of nearly 200 warships and over 60,000 men, Barbarossa cunningly avoided a direct confrontation. The two great admirals, Barbarossa and Doria, cautiously observed each other, neither willing to initiate a battle due to various strategic concerns. Eventually, the Christians unexpectedly retreated, allowing the Turks to seize the sea without a fight. The encounter showcased the tactical prowess and cautious approach of the seasoned leaders involved.|"[""1.

After a series of naval battles where Barbarossa, the famous Corsair, displayed his prowess, a significant victory was achieved by the Ottomans over Christian fleets. Despite Doria's reluctance to engage in a direct confrontation, Barbarossa's strategic maneuvers led to the Turks' triumph. Following this success, Sultan Suleymān rewarded the conqueror generously. Barbarossa continued to demonstrate his naval superiority by reclaiming Castelnuovo and conducting successful sieges. Despite some setbacks and alliances with France, Barbarossa's ambitions were not always fulfilled. His attempt to bombard Nice, a city in Italy, ended in chaos due to insufficient ammunition and opposition from the Knights of Malta. The winter saw the Turkish fleet anchored in Toulon, France, causing fear and unrest among the locals as Christian slaves suffered on the galleys.

During the 16th century, the Mediterranean Sea was a battleground for powerful admirals. Francis I of France and the Corsair, Barbarossa, were at odds. Doria, a Genoese Corsair, was suspected of questionable loyalty. Despite being in close proximity, the two great admirals avoided direct conflict to protect their reputations. Francis I feared Toulon's potential surrender to the Emperor, while Barbarossa exploited his position in Toulon to raid Spanish coasts. The French king had to meet his demands, leading to growing tension. Barbarossa left with riches and captives, leaving a legacy as a formidable sea captain. Even after his death, piracy continued under his successors. Charles V of Spain attempted to end piracy by attacking Algiers, facing challenges along the way.

In 1550, Dragut seized Mahdīya, a city in chaos, with the help of a traitorous chief. Christendom was impressed and aimed to outshine him. Don Garcia de Toledo led an assault with troops in June 1550. Dragut, aware of the attack, was at sea raiding the Gulf of Genoa. His nephew defended the city. Dragut's attempt to relieve the city failed, and he fled to Jerba. The siege continued until September when the Christians breached the walls. Sultan Suleymān disapproved of the storming of a Muslim fortress by Christians. Dragut was given galleys by the Sultan. Doria trapped Dragut in a strait but was outwitted by Dragut's ruse.

Sinān, a skilled Ottoman admiral, faced a setback at Malta but sought victory at Tripoli. With determination, he led his forces to besiege the city held by the Knights of St. John. Despite initial challenges, a French renegade's treachery aided the Turks in breaching Tripoli's defenses. Gaspard de Villiers, the city's defender, surrendered under duress. Sinān, unlike the merciful Suleymān, showed no leniency, putting most captives in chains. Subsequent years saw Ottoman raids along Italian shores. In response, a coalition of European powers, led by Duke de Medina-Celi, aimed to reclaim Tripoli. However, setbacks plagued the expedition, including disease outbreaks and adverse weather.

Giovanni Doria and Medina-Celi managed to escape, but the fleet was lost. The old admiral, heartbroken, sought solace in religion. The Knights of Rhodes, once spared by Suleymān, now brought trouble, preying on enemies of the Faith. They built defenses in Malta, anticipating the Sultan's revenge.

During the historic siege of Malta in 1565, the city was located on the east side of the Marsa harbor, unlike Valetta today. To grasp the heroic events that unfolded during this time, it's crucial to understand the layout of the forts. Mount Sceberras, a rugged landmass, divided two deep inlets on the northern coast of the island. The eastern inlet, Marsa Muset, lacked defenses except for the guns at St. Elmo fortress. Marsa Kebir, the main stronghold, had smaller harbors on its western side. The strategic positioning of forts like St. Elmo, Fort St. Angelo, and Fort St. Michael played a vital role in the defense against the Ottoman fleet. Despite the rocky terrain and lack of field-works, the Knights of Malta prepared for the impending attack, led by their courageous Grand Master, Jean de la Valette.|['1.

At the beginning, a serious problem occurred for the Turks; Dragut was two weeks late at the meeting point. His support would have reinforced Piāli's suggestion to land the entire force and attack the Burg and St. Michael from the heights behind. Mustafa, the Seraskier, insisted on capturing the outlying Fort of St. Elmo on the promontory of Sceberras before going for the main position. He landed his men at his convenience from the Marsa Muset and started building earthworks on the land side of St. Elmo. Ochiali from Alexandria and Dragut from Tripoli and Bona arrived to assist. Dragut realized the mistake made but knew giving up the siege would embolden the Knights. The siege continued with exceptional zeal. St. Elmo, defended by a small but elite garrison, faced a massive Turkish force. Despite the odds, the defenders, led by De Broglio and Juan de Guaras, fought fiercely. The Turks bombarded the fort, but the defenders built new defenses each time a wall fell. The Turks launched a fierce assault, but the defenders held their ground. St. Elmo was reduced to ruins, yet the defenders remained resolute. The Turks finally cut off all communication to the fort. Dragut was mortally wounded, and Mustafa took over. The final assault on June 23rd led to the fall of St. Elmo after a valiant defense by the Knights.|['1.

Dragut, a remarkable admiral and general, heard of the fall of St. Elmo as he lay dying in his tent. Despite his impending death, he was grateful for the victory. Known for his humane treatment of prisoners and his prowess in battle, Dragut was content with his life and did not seek power or honors. St. Elmo had fallen, but St. Angelo and St. Michael remained untouched. The Turkish general, Mustafa, sent a flag of truce to propose terms of surrender, but the Grand Master of the Knights of St. John, La Valette, refused. A new siege began, with reinforcements arriving to bolster the defense. Despite several assaults and attempts to breach the fortifications, the Knights successfully repelled the Turkish forces, showcasing their bravery and skill in combat.|"[""1.

On the 7th of August, nearly twenty thousand men courageously attacked the fort once more, scaling walls and breaching bastions. The battle raged for eight long hours, with the Christians fighting bravely but exhausted, lacking reserves. As the Turks almost seized victory, a small group of horsemen from the Old Town galloped down, causing panic among the Turks who mistook them for reinforcements. Despite being only two hundred men, the Turks fled in fear, abandoning their hard-won foothold. Mustafa, undeterred, planned another assault for August 20th, but well-aimed fire forced him to retreat. The Turks persisted, but mines set off by La Valette thwarted their efforts. Despite further unsuccessful assaults, news of a Spanish relief army landing led to the Turks retreating, ending the siege of Malta. The Knights of Malta, battered and wounded, were hailed as heroes upon the arrival of the new Brethren of the Order. Their resilience and sacrifice during the siege immortalized them in history as true heroes.|"['1.

"Read an excellent description of the galleys and discipline of the Knights of St. John in Jurien de la Gravière's book, ""The Last Days of the Marine at Oars,"" chapter nine. The siege of Malta was a setback for the Knights, but it did not diminish the Turks' reputation in the Mediterranean. The Turks were resisted on land but not defeated at sea. The fall of St. Elmo was a cause for celebration among the Muslims, even leading to unrest in Granada. The Turks felt some consolation despite failing to take St. Michael due to false alarms. The Knights were seen as fierce opponents, almost like devils, by their enemies. The Turks, led by Ochiali, prepared for another campaign after their losses in Malta.

In September, the Turkish and Barbary fleets, under 'Ali Pasha and Ochiali, caused havoc in Crete and along the Adriatic coast, seizing prisoners and loot. Anchoring in the Gulf of Lepanto, they awaited the Christian fleets' advance. Pope Pius V united the Christian navy under Don John of Austria, a young commander known for his successes. The fleet assembled in the Straits of Messina, with Venetian Admiral Veniero already present. Don John, delayed by preparations, eventually set sail from Barcelona, crossing the Gulf of Lyons to join the fleet. The fleet, comprising galleys from various European nations, set off from Messina in August. Each captain received specific orders to avoid confusion. The fleet, including galleasses and galleys, reached Corfu after ten days, celebrated by the castle's cannons.|"[""1.

The Battle of Lepanto in 1571 was a historic naval clash that saw the Turkish fleet nearly destroyed. The Christians, led by the young hero Don John, emerged victorious but not without losses. The battle marked the decline of the Ottoman naval supremacy and the end of the era of the great Corsairs. Despite the Ottomans quickly rebuilding their fleet, the battle shattered their prestige. The Barbary Corsairs, once feared, turned into petty pirates, no longer daring grand adventures. Ochiali, the last great Corsair, sought revenge but could not find a worthy opponent. His later exploits were limited, and he eventually passed away in 1580. The Battle of Lepanto altered the balance of power at sea, signaling a new era where the Ottomans no longer struck fear into the hearts of Christendom.|"['1.

He was a man with unconventional religious beliefs. On one occasion, a Genoese priest predicted that the devil would claim his soul, to which he cheerfully agreed. Another time, a devout Moslem sheykh requested a Christian slave for sacrifice. 'Ali, a Corsair, sent a strong Spaniard to be slain, but the Christian appeared more willing to fight than be killed. 'Ali explained that sacrificing Christians pleased the prophet Mohammed. It was noted that many of these Corsairs were renegades from Christian lands. The Corsairs were skilled at plundering ships from various Christian nations without fear, while Christians in harbors relaxed. The Corsairs raided coasts, capturing people and riches, making them extremely wealthy. Their exploits left towns and villages ruined, with captives taken into slavery.

The Corsairs used a unique type of navigation quite different from traditional ships. Their vessels, known as galleys, were long and narrow row-boats with a few sails but mainly relied on oars for movement. The number of men rowing varied depending on the vessel's size, with some galleys having up to six men per oar. These rowers were often slaves, either Turkish, Moorish captives, or Christian convicts. The galley's design included two masts with lateen sails, a short deck at the prow for fighters and trumpeters, and a deck at the stern for knights and the captain. The rowers were chained to benches and had to row for hours without rest, enduring harsh treatment if they faltered.

Galley-slaves endured a dreadful existence, chained together in cramped benches, deprived of sleep. The conditions were deplorable, with seven men confined in a space barely ten by four feet. The ship was a pit of despair, overseen by cruel boatswains armed with whips. The boatswains lashed the rowers mercilessly, creating a scene of suffering and hopelessness. The galley's structure, adorned with colorful cloths on special occasions, housed a large crew including rowers, officers, soldiers, and support staff. The Barbary galleots, smaller but equally oppressive, were favored by the Algerines for their maneuverability in battle. These vessels were constantly built or repaired, employing Christian workers who were paid meager wages. The Algerines maintained a fleet of galleots and galleys, commanded mostly by renegades, demonstrating the harsh reality of life at sea during that era.|['1.

The launching of a galley was a grand sight. After months of hard work, from cutting down trees to transporting planks, the Christian slaves who built the vessel rejoiced. The Muslim owners celebrated by hanging money and clothes on the mast for the slaves. On launch day, more gifts and a feast were given, and the ship was greased and blessed. The rowers, mostly Christian slaves, were unpaid unless they captured a prize. The soldiers were under their own commander and were only paid if they succeeded. The crew consulted saints before sailing on auspicious days. The corsairs were fearless, often returning laden with riches and captives. When a prize was taken, the booty was divided among the owners, crew, and government. The captors celebrated with gunfire upon their return to port, marking a time of revelry and wealth in Algiers.|['1.

"Admiral Jurien de la Gravière's book, ""Les Derniers Jours de la Marine à Rames,"" published in Paris in 1885, is a valuable resource for understanding historical naval practices. It provides detailed insights into the French galley system, recruitment processes, discipline, and overall management. The book also describes various types of vessels, their navigation methods, and includes an informative appendix on galley construction and rigging. Particularly interesting are the chapters on rowing and sailing navigation from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The transition from galleys to square-sailed ships marked a significant shift in Corsair tactics due to challenges in capturing Christian slaves and the need for larger vessels for raids. This change in ship design and tactics paved the way for the era of sailing ships, signaling the end of the galley's dominance in naval warfare."|"['1.

The Corsairs quickly adapted to new navigation techniques, showcasing their expertise as seasoned sailors. Familiar with the Spanish and Venetian galleasses, the Corsairs utilized a blend of rowed galleys and sailing galleons. These vessels, equipped with lateen sails for propulsion, were known for their speed and strength. The Corsairs' galleons, such as the tartana and caravel, were armed and agile, making them formidable opponents. Their raids extended beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, reaching as far as Madeira and even Denmark and Iceland. The Corsairs' tactics were cunning, using various projectiles and strategies to overpower their enemies. Despite facing formidable foes from Christendom, the Corsairs continued their successful raids across trade routes, capturing valuable goods and slaves. Their fleet, numbering over a hundred sailing ships and galleys, posed a significant threat to maritime trade, even targeting French vessels during this period.|"['1.

Father Dan described the miserable life of the shore-slaves who were driven to the Besistān or slave-market upon being landed. There they were auctioned off like cattle, paraded by the auctioneer, and beaten if deemed lazy. The buyers, often speculators, intended to resell them. The prettiest women were sent to Constantinople, while the rest were chained, placed in dungeons, or large prisons. Slaves performed various tasks like selling water, cleaning, whitewashing, and farming. The mental anguish of captivity was more tormenting than physical toil. While some were treated relatively better, instances of cruelty existed, especially for prisoners like the Knights of Malta, who endured harsh conditions and heavy chains in dungeons. Despite the hardships, some slaves preferred captivity in Algiers over facing punishment in Europe.|['1.

"During his captivity in Algiers, Miguel de Cervantes, a renowned figure in history, faced numerous challenges. After being captured by Corsair galleys in 1575, Cervantes, despite being treated harshly by his captors, attempted daring escapes. His family worked tirelessly to secure his release, but he remained a valuable hostage. Cervantes, showing immense courage and chivalry, took the blame for a failed escape attempt, earning the respect of his captors. Eventually, through the efforts of Father Juan Gil, Cervantes was ransomed in 1580 after five years of captivity. The conditions of slavery varied, with some slaves treated as family members while others endured severe hardships. Efforts to negotiate the release of Christian slaves were challenging but supported by organizations like the ""Order of the Holy Trinity and Redemption of Captives,"" founded to rescue Christian captives from the infidels."|"[""1.

In 1634, Father Pierre Dan and his companions embarked from Marseilles with Sanson le Page, the premier herald of France, to negotiate the release of captives. They aimed to exchange Turkish prisoners from Marseilles with French prisoners in Algiers. Father Dan strongly believed that the Corsairs, who were descendants of Ham, were the cruelest of all, inheriting Noah's curse. Upon their arrival in Algiers, they faced customs like surrendering their rudder and oars. Despite cordial receptions, negotiations stalled. The Mission hastily departed and ended up in Majorca, then Bujēya, and finally La Calle. Despite their efforts, they returned to Marseilles empty-handed. The Redemptionists tirelessly strived to rescue French captives, even rejecting a Lutheran captive offered by the Dey. Their zeal brought solace to Catholic prisoners, establishing hospitals and chapels along the Barbary coast.|"[""1.

This shortened story about Cervantes' time as a captive is condensed from Mr. H. E. Watts's excellent biography, included in his translation of _Don Quixote_. The primary source on this topic is Haedo, who wrote based on the accounts of witnesses that knew Cervantes in Algiers. They all praised his bravery, patience, good humor, and selfless dedication. The history of Algiers and Tunis reveals a pattern of European powers being accused of cowardice and dishonor due to their interactions with these regions. Policy decisions and distractions from other conflicts like civil wars or battles with Napoleon may have influenced Europe's responses. These powers sometimes resorted to bribing or submitting to the demands of the rulers of Algiers and Tunis out of fear. The story highlights instances where European nations paid tributes or bribes to maintain peace or secure trade agreements with these North African states.|"[""1.

During the time when Europe was in a state of decline, the Barbary Corsairs were acknowledged as civilized nations to be treated as equals. This era began shortly after the Ottomans suffered a defeat at Lepanto, diminishing their naval power but increasing the fear of the ruthless Corsairs. From 1560 until Lord Exmouth's triumph in 1816, there were no serious efforts to eradicate the Mediterranean scourge. Consuls, ambassadors, and royal messengers started visiting Tunis and Algiers. The British nation and other maritime powers were represented by consular agents in these regions. The consuls faced challenges dealing with the Dey, a common soldier, while Christian monarchs endured insults to their representatives. Despite occasional shows of force, including war threats and naval displays, the European governments often gave in to the Dey's demands.|"[""1.

During the 17th century, British consuls faced severe mistreatment in Algiers. The Deys showed increasing arrogance with each act of submission. They even forcibly took a Maltese cook from a consul's house, leading to escalating tensions. When Captain Hope arrived, he was met with disrespect, and the consul was humiliated by being forced aboard a ship without his belongings. Consuls were expelled, arrested, and even died due to trumped-up charges. The Danish consul was imprisoned and made to work alongside slaves. The consular body united to free him, but his wife tragically passed away. The situation worsened as piracy increased, with many British ships being captured. The clergy played a vital role in comforting captives, offering solace in times of despair. Despite some efforts at ransom, many remained in captivity, prompting desperate pleas for help from ruined merchants and captives themselves.|"['1.

Many Majorcans and individuals from various nations planned to escape by night with a brigantine. About seventy people gathered at a specific meeting point and descended through a sewer to reach the port. However, the barking of numerous dogs alerted the guards, who shouted for help. Despite the commotion, forty slaves managed to overpower the guards, threw them into the sea, and fled in the row-boat. They faced obstacles with ships' cables in the port but eventually made it to sea and reached Majorca. The Dey expressed concern that Christians might invade in the future. Ransoms and escapes fluctuated over the years, with some captives being freed for small sums. British ships were sometimes captured due to fraudulent passes, leading to increased slavery. Despite numerous failed attempts and treaties, the Algerines maintained the right to search British vessels, resulting in further conflicts and expeditions.|"['1.

In the past, various attempts were made to deal with the Barbary Rovers, particularly the Algerines. These efforts often lacked adequate preparation and strength, leading to ineffective results. For instance, Admiral Keppel's expedition in 1749, although memorable for having Sir Joshua Reynolds on board, yielded little beyond a few sketches. James Bruce, an African traveler, brought some improvement as a consul-general in 1763, but his subsequent travels left the situation unchanged. Even a combined fleet from Spain, Portugal, Naples, and Malta in 1784 proved feeble and ineffectual against the Corsairs. The governance of Algiers saw various transitions, from Pashas appointed by the Sultan to Janissaries electing a Dey from their ranks. The United States took a stand against the tribute demanded by the Barbary Rovers, eventually leading to the construction of a fleet after negotiations failed. This move forced Algiers to seek peace through a treaty, although it set a precedent for demanding tributes from other nations.|"['1.

Yūsuf of Tripoli declared war on May 14, 1801, by cutting down the American Consulate's flagstaff. The United States, tired of paying tribute to pirates, sent a squadron led by Commodore Edward Preble to the Mediterranean. After a skirmish with a Moroccan cruiser off Spain, the squadron demanded answers and received apologies and reparations from the Emperor of Morocco. Preble then focused on Tripoli, blockading the city with the frigates _Philadelphia_ and _Vixen_. Unfortunately, the _Philadelphia_ ran aground near Tripoli after chasing an enemy vessel, leading to its capture and the crew's imprisonment. Despite efforts to scuttle the ship, the Tripolitans salvaged it and anchored it near the Pasha's castle.|"[""1.

Preble learned of a disaster from an English ship near Sardinia on the way to Tripoli. The loss was significant, with one-third of his fighting force gone, and many captives strengthening the enemy. Despite this setback, Preble was determined. Plans were made to destroy the captured ship. Lieutenant Stephen Decatur, known for his bravery and resourcefulness, was chosen for the task. The ship, _Intrepid_, set sail from Syracuse to Tripoli with combustibles on board. The mission faced challenges, including cramped quarters and vermin left by previous occupants. After a six-day voyage, the Americans approached Tripoli.

This treaty marked a turning point in Europe's stance against the Barbary Corsairs. The power of these pirates began to decline after the treaty was signed. The older nations recognized their duty to end piracy at sea. The United States gained a significant position and strengthened its navy through the conflict with Tripoli. Despite Admiral Nelson's presence in the Mediterranean, dealing with the Corsairs was not his priority. The Americans set an example by negotiating a successful treaty in 1815, abolishing payments and securing the release of captives. This success prompted the British to send Lord Exmouth to negotiate similar terms with other Mediterranean powers. Ultimately, Lord Exmouth's firm approach led to the abolition of Christian slavery in Tunis.|"[""1.

The wife of George IV was upset when her delightful outings in Carthage and the orange groves were interrupted. The Tunisians were angry about the Bey's surrender, and piracy continued despite the Treaty. Lord Exmouth succeeded in Tunis and Tripoli but faced rejection in Algiers. His proposals were turned down, and his officers were insulted. After negotiations failed, Lord Exmouth led an attack on Algiers with a squadron of warships. The battle lasted from afternoon till late at night, with the British fleet prevailing. The next morning, the city was in ruins, and Lord Exmouth secured the release of over 1,600 slaves and forced the Dey to apologize to a mistreated consul. Ultimately, peace was restored through a treaty that prevented future enslavement of prisoners of war and liberated existing slaves.|"[""1.

The Battle of Algiers marked a satisfying victory against the robbers of Algiers, but the triumph was short-lived. Despite the damage to their fleet and fortifications, the robbers quickly recovered. The English and French admirals' efforts to impose peace were met with continued insolence. Only France's decisive actions in 1830 led to the final conquest of Algiers. The French fleet, led by Admiral Duperré, arrived in June and faced little resistance. By July, after a fierce bombardment, the Dey surrendered, and Algiers fell. The French occupation that followed, however, was marred by brutality and inhumanity towards the native population. The conquest of Algiers serves as a stark reminder of the consequences of imposing rule without understanding or respect for the people.|['1.

During the long years of intense fighting in Algeria, where famous commanders like Bugeaud, Pelissier, Canrobert, St. Arnaud, MacMahon, and others honed their skills, it was the Arab tribes that stood out with their bravery and determination. Despite the inevitable outcome, the Arabs fought valiantly, often defeating the superior French forces and reclaiming cities. 'Abd-el-Kādir emerged as a hero, blending traditional Arab virtues with modern civilization's benefits. His leadership rallied the tribes against the French occupation. Despite initial successes, 'Abd-el-Kādir faced defeat as the French intensified their efforts. Eventually, he surrendered in 1847 after years of resistance. Peace remained elusive in Algeria, with subsequent revolts and French military rule. Only with civil governance did some stability return. Today, Algeria remains relatively calm, although it requires a significant military presence to maintain peace.|"[""1.

The French occupation of Tunis in 1881 was an act of pure aggression, driven by Italy's ambitions and the timidity of the English Foreign Office. France's representative in Tunis, M. Théodore Roustan, fabricated diplomatic grievances to justify the invasion. Despite the Bey's resistance to unreasonable demands that threatened his autonomy, support from other Powers was lacking. The French army invaded Tunis under the pretext of restoring order among bordering tribes, leading to the Bey's capture and a reign of terror. The French bombarded Sfax, causing bloodshed and anarchy. The situation mirrored the history of Algiers, with brutal tactics employed to subdue the region. The French Protectorate faced open revolt, but efforts to control the chaos eventually led to a more stable environment. France's actions in Tunis were condemned as robbery aggravated by murder, echoing similar events in Algiers.|"[""1.
