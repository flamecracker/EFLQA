The shed at Hugson's Siding was empty, except for an old bench, and didn't seem welcoming. In the soft light, the child saw a horse and buggy nearby. The horse, tall and skinny, looked tired and the buggy, almost new, had shiny curtains. A boy was asleep inside. Suddenly, the earth shook, the ground split, and the horse fell into a crack, pulling the buggy with it. Darkness surrounded them as they fell. Dorothy fainted briefly from fear, while Zeb, scared but awake, held on tight. The buggy acted like a parachute, slowing their fall. They feared hitting the bottom or being buried alive. Rocks and debris fell around them, but the buggy shielded them from harm. The horse yelped as it was hit, but they all landed safely, shaken but alive.|"[""1.

Dorothy was in a state of confusion, unsure of how long the strange situation had been going on. As she looked into the dark void with a racing heart, she started to make out the shape of the horse Jim and the boy Zeb beside her. The horse was tumbling through space with legs sprawled out, while the boy remained silent. Dorothy sighed with relief, realizing she wasn't facing death but embarking on another peculiar adventure. They descended towards glowing balls in the air, emitting rainbow-like rays. Jim's ear turned violet, his tail yellow, and his body striped in blue and orange. Zeb's face turned blue, and his hair pink. The buggy tipped over, but they remained seated. As they passed the bright suns, the light dazzled them. Finally, they landed gently on a glass roof, where a pink kitten emerged from Dorothy's birdcage.|"['1.

The city's glass houses were transparent, allowing views through the walls like windows. Dorothy spotted rooms below the roof, some with odd figures in corners. The buildings had damages, with glass shards scattered around. A man emerged through a roof hole, dressed in vibrant green. He seemed calm despite the strangers' arrival. The man walked off the roof and into a glass building. The kitten mentioned having nine lives and the ability to float safely. Zeb, initially scared, overcame his fear and walked off the roof with Dorothy's help. Jim, the horse, also floated down gracefully to the glass pavement.|"['1.

As the group of people emerged from the glass doors to see the newcomers, a crowd quickly gathered. Men and women, all beautifully formed and well-dressed, with handsome faces, looked at the strangers. Despite their flawless appearance, Dorothy was unimpressed as their expressions were blank, devoid of emotion. A man with a shining star in his hair, a figure of authority, approached Zeb. The procession moved through the city streets, arriving at a grand glass palace. Inside, a strange figure with thorns all over his head and bright yellow clothing sat on a glass throne. When questioned about a recent event, the thorn-covered man defended his sorcery. Suddenly, a balloon-like object descended from the sky, captivating the onlookers.

The balloon gradually grew larger, indicating it was descending towards the Land of the Mangaboos. Dorothy was surprised by the patience of the people, as her heart raced with excitement. She hoped the arrival from the surface of the earth would assist her and Zeb. After a few hours, a basket suspended below the balloon came into view. Eventually, the balloon settled on the glass pavement, and a bald, elderly man emerged from the basket. He explained that he accidentally landed in the Land of the Mangaboos after falling through a crack in the earth due to an earthquake. The Prince mentioned a Sorcerer who sometimes made mistakes, and the Wizard, a circus performer, was invited to join them. The Wizard demonstrated a magic trick to prove himself to the crowd.|"['1.

The Wizard performed a magical trick by turning one little white piglet into nine tiny piglets. He then merged the piglets back into one, amazing the onlookers. Suddenly, a Sorcerer appeared and cast a spell on the Wizard, who swiftly defeated him by cutting him in half with a sword. To everyone's surprise, the Sorcerer had no bones or blood inside, resembling a sliced turnip. The procession then headed to the public gardens, with Jim the horse joining in. The group passed through the glass city streets and arrived at beautiful gardens filled with color-changing flowers under multiple suns.

A group of strangers followed the Prince through glass bridges and paths to a garden enclosed by a high hedge. Inside, they found rows of large plants with Mangaboos growing on them. These creatures were attached to the plants until they were ripe, at which point they gained motion and speech. The Prince explained that they needed to be picked to become good citizens. The Prince shared that they could live for about five years if well cared for. They admired a girl on a central stalk, dressed in exquisite garments. The Prince expressed sadness about the cycle of their vegetable lives, where they must give way to new growth. The Prince decided to keep the Wizard but planned to dispose of the other strangers.

With Dorothy's command, they freed the Princess from her plant-like state. Graciously, the Princess acknowledged the help of the strangers and confronted the Prince for neglecting her.

The Wizard crafted a makeshift fishing rod using a pin and string, baiting it with a bright red blossom. He cast the line into a nearby brook and quickly felt a tug. Reeling it in, he caught a fat, round fish with glistening scales. Eureka, the piglet, snatched the fish, leaving only a few crackers behind. The Wizard decided to claim the House of the Sorcerer, as the Prince had promised to keep him until a new Sorcerer was chosen. As they explored the house, they found glass-furnished rooms but no beds. After a rest, they were confronted by the Princess and her people, threatening to throw them into the Garden of the Twining Vines.

The Wizard bowed to the people and performed a trick with nine tiny piglets, then made them vanish. The Princess seemed amazed, and the Wizard lit lanterns, impressing the Mangaboos who had never seen such light. He poured oil on the floor and lit it, creating a grand flame. The Wizard challenged the Princess's advisors to step into the light; those who advised well would be unharmed. The advisors hesitated but eventually stepped in, getting scorched. The Princess spared the Wizard but banished his animals to the Black Pit. The friends explored peacefully for a few days until they encountered the Garden of Clinging Vines, a dangerous place. The Wizard's piglets wandered into a hall, causing a confrontation with the Mangaboos. Jim and Eureka defended themselves, driving the creatures away.|"['1.

The enemies overwhelmed Jim, Eureka, and the piglets, forcing them to retreat to a glass mountain. A cave halfway up the steep mountain became their dark prison. Eureka bravely escaped, leading the Mangaboos on a chase. She reached Dorothy, the Wizard, and Zeb for help. The group faced the Mangaboos but managed to rescue Jim and the piglets. They ventured through the cavern, using lanterns to guide them. The tunnel led them away from the Mangaboo territory. The Wizard suggested exploring the path for a way out.

The group journeyed through a glass mountain tunnel, encountering narrow and wide sections. Jim, leading the way, paused to rest on the steep climb. Eventually, they were relieved to see a white light instead of the tiring rainbow hues. Emerging from the tunnel, they found a picturesque valley with orchards, gardens, and quaint cottages. The valley was mysteriously empty despite its beauty. As they descended the mountain, they noticed the absence of inhabitants. Walking toward a nearby cottage, they encountered a plant with a peach-like fruit, enticing Dorothy. Jim, feeling the unseen piglets, secured them in his pocket.

Laughter filled the air as the plates clattered. A chair moved on its own, startling Dorothy. Invisible voices reassured her. They spoke of the dangers of the Valley of Voe, where bears lurked but could not see them. The strangers were offered dama-fruit, making them invisible to the bears. The children, preferring invisibility, explained the joys of being unseen. Dorothy felt the faces of the children, discovering a girl and a boy. The Valley valued kindness over appearance. They couldn't see birds or bears, but they heard them. Eureka, a pet, caused a brief scare. The Wizard inquired about leaving the Valley, learning it was possible but not easy. The group knew they belonged on the Earth's surface and would keep moving forward.|['1.

Once upon a time, a man advised travelers to cross the Valley and ascend the spiral staircase inside Pyramid Mountain. At the mountain's peak lies the Land of Naught, home to fearsome Gargoyles. These creatures dread noise; even a shout can halt their advance. The man recounted a Champion's battle with the Gargoyles, highlighting the importance of silence in the face of danger. The travelers were guided by an unseen voice to rub special leaves on their feet, allowing them to walk on water to escape pursuing bears. With the plant's aid, they crossed the river safely, evading the fierce beasts. The Wizard's sword skills saved them from a red bear, and they hurried across the water to safety.|"['1.

On the river, the adventurers were safe. Dorothy and the buggy floated downstream, and the others joined her. The Wizard used plaster to mend Jim's cuts from the bear claws. Zeb hitched Jim back to the buggy, and they swiftly crossed the water. The kitten, Eureka, was scared of getting wet at first but soon played alongside the buggy. Dorothy warned her about eating fish in the valley. After hours, they reached a point where they had to cross the Valley to get to Pyramid Mountain. They feared encountering more bears. All three got into the buggy with Zeb driving. Jim galloped towards the mountain, spooked by the thought of bears. Zeb growled, making Jim sprint faster. They reached the foot of the mountain, with the Wizard and Zeb falling out. Dorothy held on, and they laughed at the situation. They climbed the mountain through a dark stairway. They rested and continued the climb until they reached a landing with a view of the Valley of Voe. They climbed further, and at the second landing, they saw a strange scene below with a black sea and rolling clouds above. They noticed beautiful Cloud Fairies on the cloud banks.|"['1.

In the sky above the swirling sea, enormous birds with fierce eyes and sharp beaks glided swiftly. Zeb was reminded of the legendary rocs from Arabian Nights. As the children cautiously watched, a white-haired man appeared in the cave, inviting them into his shop. He offered them boxes filled with magical items like fluttering flags and rustles. The man, a former hole manufacturer, shared his sad tale of falling into the cave. Touched by his story, Dorothy gifted him a blue ribbon, bringing a sparkle to his eyes. Despite his lonely abode, the braided man found joy in creating whimsical items in his mountain home.|['1.

The braided man finished his strange tale, making Dorothy want to laugh at its absurdity. However, the Wizard signaled that he believed the man to be crazy. Politely bidding him farewell, they continued their journey in the cavern. After climbing to a third landing, they found a rift in the mountain with only clouds in sight. Resting on the rocky floor, the Wizard took out nine tiny piglets that were now visible, showing they had left the magical Valley of Voe. Eureka expressed hunger, wanting to eat a piglet, but Dorothy and Jim intervened, explaining it wasn't right. As they climbed further, the stairs narrowed, requiring teamwork to maneuver the buggy. Arriving at a wooden platform, they marveled at the wooden Country of the Gargoyles, with wooden houses, trees, and even wooden people.|"[""1.

The Gargoyles were peculiar creatures, standing less than three feet tall with round bodies, short legs, and long, stout arms. Their heads were oversized, featuring ugly faces with long noses, small eyes, and wide, grinning mouths. Some had curved noses and chins, while others had flat noses and protruding eyes. Each Gargoyle had a unique appearance, with tops of their heads carved into various shapes. They wore short wooden wings and communicated silently through signals. Despite their eerie appearance, they moved swiftly and silently, making no sounds as they flew. When faced with intruders, they stared with evil eyes but were no match for Jim's powerful kicks that sent them scattering. Although the Gargoyles regrouped, they wisely avoided another confrontation with the horse.|"['1.

Zeb quickly grabbed one of the Gargoyles nearby. It had a crown on its head, and the Wizard's bullet hit its left eye, which was a tough wooden knot. The noise and jolt from the shot knocked it over more than causing real harm. Zeb tied the creature up tightly with a strap, rendering it immobile, and tossed it into the buggy. Meanwhile, the Gargoyles kept sending a few of their group to provoke the strangers, trying to divert attention. Despite the noise, the Wizard's bullets didn't do much damage. The group decided to fight back, using whatever weapons they had. Zeb used the bound Gargoyle as a club, while Dorothy used her parasol for protection. The battle intensified, with the defenders yelling and the kitten and horse joining in. However, the wooden creatures overwhelmed them, capturing Zeb, the Wizard, Dorothy, and Jim the horse.

The captors brought the prisoners to a house with no doors or windows, just a high opening under the roof. The Gargoyles pushed them inside onto a platform and flew off, leaving them stranded. Unable to fly, the prisoners feared jumping down. Jim, the big beast, was carried by multiple Gargoyles and the buggy was tossed in too. Eureka, the kitten, was thrown in as well. The Gargoyles vanished, allowing the group to explore the wooden city below. The Wizard and the children found empty rooms below with no escape. The wooden Gargoyles in the houses nearby were observed going to bed and unhooking their wings. The group speculated about flying with the Gargoyles' wings to reach safety. Zeb climbed down carefully as Eureka clung to the house before they entered another dwelling nearby.|"['1.

When he reached the strap, he fastened the wings together and the Wizard hoisted them up. Zeb climbed up the line, followed by Eureka. Soon, they all stood on the platform with eight wooden wings. The boy was full of energy, no longer sleepy. He reassembled the harness and attached some wings to Jim the horse. It was tricky as the hinges were still attached to a Gargoyle. The Wizard found wire to secure four wings to Jim's harness, two near his head and two near his tail. The wings were a bit wobbly but secure enough. The Gargoyles began to wake up, so the group decided to leave quickly. They boarded the buggy, with Dorothy holding Eureka, and flew away as the Gargoyles pursued them. They managed to escape and set fire to the wings, creating a barrier. The group explored a mountain to find a way out, facing challenges along the way.|"['1.

The Wizard assured his companions that the Gargoyles were likely still occupied with the fire and would find it challenging to navigate the rocky terrain. They encountered perilous cracks in the floor but managed to leap over them. Pushing the buggy over rough rocks, they finally reached a vast cave with flickering lights. They overheard young dragonettes discussing their appearance and lineage, boasting of their pedigree dating back thousands of years. Dorothy retorted, proud of her humble origins in Kansas. The dragonettes, unable to harm them due to being tethered, were examined closely by the group. They marveled at the creatures' large heads, sturdy legs, and slim tails. The dragonettes hesitated to answer Dorothy's questions, fearing punishment for deceit.|"['1.

The group cautiously navigated the cavern, avoiding the dragonettes' watchful eyes. Two paths emerged, and they hastily chose one to escape the looming mother dragon. As they ascended, hope grew as the path inclined towards what they hoped was daylight. Suddenly, a massive rock blocked their way, spinning slowly. After a moment of confusion, they seized the chance to cross to the other side. The children, the Wizard, and even Jim the cab-horse made it across safely. However, their relief was short-lived as they found themselves trapped in a dead-end cave. Despite a glimmer of sunlight above, they realized they were imprisoned. Reflecting on their predicament, the Wizard and the group pondered their fate, with the Wizard revealing his true nature as a humbug wizard.|['1.

In the room, there was a luxurious bathroom with a marble tub filled with scented water. The boy, amazed by the new place, enjoyed a refreshing bath.

Despite his arrogance, the group paid no mind and engaged in cheerful conversation until bedtime. Jim the Cab-horse, accustomed to being a servant, was treated with respect in the Land of Oz, which made him a bit arrogant. He was served oatmeal for breakfast, which he enjoyed.

The cab-horse explained that he was given a magic powder by Princess Ozma, making him the only horse in the Land of Oz, respected despite his self-perceived insignificance. Jim, another horse, proudly pointed out his fine points like his ability to whisk away flies with his tail. The cab-horse pitied Jim for missing out on simple pleasures like brushing away bites or enjoying good food.

The kitten argued sensibly, explaining that it would be unwise to eat the piglet due to the trouble it would cause. However, she admitted that if given the chance, she would enjoy the taste. Despite the Tin Woodman's defense, the jury found Eureka guilty and recommended her punishment. Princess Ozma was about to carry out the sentence when Eureka revealed the true story. She had intended to eat the piglet but accidentally caused it to fall into a vase. The piglet was found, and Eureka's innocence was proven. The citizens of the Emerald City dispersed happily after the trial, and Eureka, although not guilty, was still kept in confinement due to her intentions.
