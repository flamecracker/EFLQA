"Around circled West, and he made a good gain before he was downed. Again came smashing plays--several of them, Columbia keeping possession of the ball. In vain did Clifford brace and hold. It was useless. She was being shoved right up the field. Her men were exhausted and discouraged. Columbia's were eager and triumphant.He called his signal with snap and vim. Frank got the ball and made a desperate dive for a big gap that was opened up between Roe and McQuirk. Forward he staggered while Shadduck and Oakes managed to circle around to form interference for him.""He's through! He's through!"" came the cry, and indeed the captain was through the Clifford line, and legging it toward the goal. Hastings started after him, but slipped and fell. Then, like a flash, Wentworth emerged from the tangle of players and set off after Allen. He came on like the wind, and managed to slip past Shadduck, but Oakes was on the alert and tackled off the plucky Clifford right-half.Then it was all over but the shouting. With the fall of Wentworth ended Clifford's hopes of preventing another touchdown, while as for her own hopes of making one they had vanished some time ago. Allen touched down the ball.

"There was a sharp click, and a clear ""tang,"" as of a strained wire snapping. Frank understood now what was doing. These men had fear of pursuit, and were cutting the telegraph wires in order to prevent direct communication between Columbia and Fayette! A second and a third metallic ""pink"" announced that the man up among the cross bars was indeed using his cutters with effect. At that rate, he would have the entire sheaf of wires severed in another minute or so. The matter began to assume gigantic proportions to the boy, as he sat there in the car and listened. Certainly, these men must have desperate need for delay in the pursuit if they went to such extremes to accomplish it. And they seemed to have provided against such a contingency, too, which would indicate that they were now only carrying out a part of a well-laid plan. What could he do? Half a dozen ideas thronged into his brain, but they seemed so utterly useless that he discarded them as fast as they arose. He must in some manner get away from their company before arriving in the neighborhood of Fayette; because if they were as desperate as they appeared the chances were they might see fit to tie him up, and leave him under some farmer's haystack, where he would not be found for hours.

Frank chuckled when he thought of the troublemakers left behind. He felt relieved after a tough time but traveling in the rain made him uncomfortable. Despite borrowing a coat, he began shivering. This forced him to slow down even more. He hoped to find a warm drink at Plattville. It was almost ten o'clock, and the moon was hidden behind clouds. Frank believed he was near the town. The sight of lights lifted his spirits. As he entered Plattville, people stared at him. They mistook him for a criminal mentioned in a dispatch.
