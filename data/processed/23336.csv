I visited my cousin Alice, who is three years old, and I adore her. She has toys like a ball, a rattle, and a horse. She also has a wax doll, a gift from last Christmas, which she kissed so much that the paint came off. We pretended she was my baby, dressed her up, and went for a walk. Then we had a pretend tea party, and I rocked her to sleep. She looked so sweet that I couldn't resist kissing her. Alice will come to visit me next week. Meanwhile, my brother Ben has embarked on a year-long voyage at sea. We saw him off, feeling sad. In another story, a man outwits a lion by placing his hat and cloak on a bush to escape harm. Susy Brown is a caring girl who stayed home to help her tired mother instead of going berry picking with her friends. Henry built a trap to catch a squirrel but was happy to see it escape back to the woods. Amy enjoys swinging her little brother more than herself, showing the love between siblings.|"['1.
