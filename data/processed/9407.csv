"The Colonel's usual fierce charge on the enemy was subdued this time. A little head shining like sunshine in the strawberry patch brought memories of Tom, a sturdy boy he was proud of. Tom, who had grown from a little shadow to a soldier, lost in his first battle. The Colonel, puzzled, asked, ""Who are you?"" His gaze shifted to the dog, with human-like eyes.

Halfway down the avenue, he sat on the rustic seat where he had carried Elizabeth's daughter. Warmth filled his heart thinking of the Little Colonel, glad she resembled him.

The girl, unlike the Colonel's ideal, sat on a tall chair, enjoying strawberries. Her feet played with Fritz's curls, using him as a footrest.

She marveled at the trees nodding. As they neared home, she directed the Colonel to her shoes and socks. Seeing a neighbor approaching, the Colonel swiftly changed their path. Before parting, she kissed him and promised to return. Despite family conflicts, the Colonel adored her, offering flowers, berries, and rides on Maggie Boy.

The elderly man grumbled something under his breath, unheard by the girl. He felt a surge of anger towards the man who had come between him and his daughter, despising him more as he realized the significant place he held in the girl's heart. Just before the train departure, the Little Colonel adorned his collar with fresh pink roses, marveling at the sight. His mother appeared at the door, elegantly dressed in a light blue dress with a white rose in her hair, radiating joy and beauty. A group of men from the city admired the mother and the cheerful child. Tears welled up in the mother's eyes as she saw her husband weak and pale, needing assistance. The family reunited on the platform, with the father expressing appreciation for the familiar and welcoming home setting. Despite the chaos of the neglected supper and melting ice-cream, the father noticed how much the child had grown and matured, finding comfort in her presence.|"['1.

"She quietly opened the door and peeked inside. Her mother gestured for her to come closer, holding a finger to her lips. Lloyd, feeling comforted, sat in her mother's lap.
