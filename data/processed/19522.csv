"Title: Tom Slade's Scout Journey

The old Indian scout sign in this chapter symbolizes a familiar path leading back to the same place. If you know Tom Slade, you can skip this chapter, but if you're new to his adventures, it's worth reading. Tom's past as a troublemaker in Barrel Alley changed when Roy Blakeley introduced him to scouting. Tom learned that barrel staves could be used for making Indian bows instead of mischief. Roy also taught him that smoking affected his aim. Tom's encounter with Westy Martin further transformed him. He discovered the joy of marking scout signs on rocks instead of throwing coal at streetcars. Tom's life took a new direction when he met Roy and embraced scouting, leaving behind his hoodlum ways."|"['1.

When the time was right, Mr. Ellsworth invited Tom to try archery in the field. Tom eagerly joined the scouts, but their moment was interrupted by John Temple's harsh arrival. He accused them of trespassing and singled out Tom. Mr. Ellsworth defended Tom and predicted a better future for him. Inspired, Tom embraced scouting wholeheartedly, unsure if he was more grateful to Roy Blakeley or Mr. Ellsworth. Their friendship blossomed over time. Temple Camp's origin and name stemmed from John Temple's generosity. Despite his initial doubts, John Temple witnessed Tom's transformation into a fine scout, leading him to establish Temple Camp as a haven for scouts. John Temple's wise investments and scouting values left a lasting impact, creating a thriving camp in the Catskills managed by the capable Jeb Rushmore.

A person arrived at the cabin to paint the names of animals on the doors. I politely informed them that such artwork was not needed, and neither were numbers. Understanding this, the person left. Since you funded this project, I suggest explaining that animal skins are more suitable for cabin signs than numbers, as cabins are not railway cars. The idea of using a silver fox skin on the cabin instead of a painted caricature excited the boys. They admired Jeb Rushmore, even before meeting him, for his innovative idea. The troop gathered to bid farewell to the boys embarking on their journey. Tom and Roy wore well-worn hiking gear, while Pee-wee, in his scout uniform, stood out. The trio set off in a canoe, leisurely paddling along the river, camping at dusk. Roy cooked supper, and they enjoyed each other's company by the campfire. The next morning, they continued their journey upstream, encountering the aftermath of a recent flood. The boys improvised first aid on the canoe using burlap and grass before arranging for its shipment back to Bridgeboro.

As they walked down the main street of the village towards the road leading to the Hudson River, a small crowd caught their attention near a grand house. A little girl stood under an elm tree, distressed as she gazed up into the branches where a parrot perched. While the spectators found the situation amusing, the girl's fear was evident. Despite her calls, the bird simply moved from branch to branch. The onlookers, including Pee-wee, Tom, and Roy, gathered on the lawn, trying to follow the bird's movements. Pee-wee suggested using a garden hose to entice the parrot down. As the water splashed higher up the tree, the bird became intrigued and eventually flew into the spray, allowing Pee-wee to gently capture it.

As the boys walked along the main street of Nyack towards the Hudson River at twilight, they noticed the shops closing. The sunset cast a crimson glow on the river, with hills turning from green to gray. They saw lights on the rugged heights and a white steamer majestically sailing upstream. The boys followed a road to Haverstraw by the Hudson, flanked by highlands. Soon, they encountered a muddy stretch of road near a peculiar structure in the dim light. As rain poured down, they hurried across the marshy land to find shelter in a small, cozy boat cabin. The cabin was neglected but snug, with sleeping lockers, chintz curtains, and a rusty engine.

Roy noticed the girl had wandered off and was now standing in the dimming light a few yards away, staring at the boat. The boat, once awkward-looking, now appeared sleek and elegant.

Despite his admiration for scouts' resourcefulness, he found himself in a situation where their skills couldn't rescue him. The convict's menacing grip haunted him, leaving him tired and fearful.

Roy admired Tom's abilities. Tom's tracking skills had saved Roy before, and now, kneeling on the tracks, he found Pee-wee's trail. Tom's keen observation revealed Pee-wee's footprints on the ties. They reached a siding where Pee-wee's footprints scattered. Tom carefully examined the area, drawing a ring around a footprint. He then crossed to the other rail, finding a clue. Roy watched, feeling remorseful. Tom's tracking expertise impressed Roy, who appreciated Tom's guidance in their search for Pee-wee.|"['1.

"As Tom spoke, a vivid memory rushed into Roy's mind from a dark night a year earlier. Tom, who had been a troublemaker, had stood by Roy and watched in wonder as Roy used a searchlight to send a message from Blakeley's Hill to the city below, undoing a misdeed Tom had committed. Roy turned the night sky into an open book for Westy Martin miles away to read what to do. ""Probably a million cars,"" Roy gasped. ""There's an uphill stretch to Poughkeepsie. They'll take at least half an hour. You're amazing. We'll tease Pee-wee for taking a train. Did he do it on purpose or get stuck?"" The searchlight, once on the _Nymph_, wasn't used on the _Good Turn_ as they didn't sail at night. Pee-wee had polished it, but it stayed in a locker. ""I plan,"" Roy said eagerly, ""to flash it from the hill and the river. It's a bit of luck, but someone should see it along the river. It'd be great to find him tonight, right?""

Three times, they sent the signal, then quickly returned to their boat and motored out, dropping anchor in the middle of the river. The waterway was perfectly straight at this point. The twinkling lights of Milton and Camelot towns were visible on either side; small lights dotted the railroads hugging the shores, and in the distance, the lights of the grand bridge at Poughkeepsie shimmered. Roy used the flashlight for a moment to catch attention, then repeatedly sent his message into the night sky. The long, bright beam filled the entire sky, cutting through the darkness with short and long flashes. The noise of their boat's engine echoed in the quietness as they approached the shore, and the splash of the anchor awakened a faint echo from the nearby mountains.|"['1.

The boys from the boating club were thrilled as they neared Temple Camp. They were excited about the upcoming hike to the quaint village of Leeds. The distance to Leeds was a mystery, with varying estimates from locals. The boys set out on a two-hour trek, adding to the village's charm with their scout gear and duffel bags. Along the way, they encountered curious stares and friendly greetings. Their journey became more adventurous as they followed a trail up a steep, wooded hill, navigating rugged terrain and tangled underbrush.

The boys were struck by the solemnity of the scene, surrounded by dense woods and a sheet of water that seemed to isolate them from the world. As they descended the hill, they caught sight of log cabins blending into the forest across the water. Shouting out, they were met by a man with iron-gray hair and a humorous twinkle in his eye, rowing a boat towards them. He exuded a sense of calm and self-assurance, unfazed by any situation. Tom introduced himself as a scout from Bridgeboro Troop, there to help. The boys marveled at Temple Camp, a well-organized community in the woods with log cabins, tents, mess boards, and a cooking shack.

Temple Camp was a unique place, fulfilling John Temple's dream. Scouts could stay there for three weeks without any cost by simply applying to the trustees. There was no favoritism, except for city troops receiving preference over country troops. Jeb Rushmore ensured fairness. Winning badges extended a troop's stay - a merit badge added two days, life scout badge four days, star badge a week, and eagle badge ten days. The bronze, silver, and gold cross badges granted even more time. Scouts earning a life-saving medal would have a boat named after them. The camp was bustling with various troops, including Garry Everson's troop from down the Hudson. Tom's troop, the Elks, settled in with new outfits. Garry, known for his water skills, was a favorite among the scouts.|"['1.

They discovered an old shack named Hero Cabin, a place reserved for scouts who won honor medals. The boys prepared the shack with rustic bunks and a flagpole.

A scout understands the value of sacrifice. Sometimes, it's better to let someone else win a medal if it benefits them more. This act of selflessness is more heroic than seeking recognition. In a moment of reflection, Tom wrote boldly that he despised cowardice, tearing the page out impulsively. As he gazed at a picture of the honor medal, a loud commotion drew his attention.
