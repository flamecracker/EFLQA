Next year, I have a plan that's going to make a big difference. I'm going to save most of my money and use it to help others. I'll keep just ten dollars for myself and use the rest to rent two rooms and a kitchenette. With the help of my friends, we'll furnish the place and open a Day Nursery for kids whose mothers need to work. I've even found someone to help take care of the babies. She's willing to work for fifteen dollars a month. I believe we can make it work by charging just four cents a day per child. I'm going to ask for donations and support from everyone I know. It may be a challenge, but I'm determined to try. With everyone's help, we can make a difference in these children's lives.|"[""1.

Kate shared with the group how in the Indian culture, shaking a blanket meant 'I want to talk with you,' holding up a tree branch meant 'I wish to make peace,' and holding up a weapon meant 'I am prepared to fight.' These were signals just like our own Camp Fires' signals. Little Mus-kin-gum was a bright and affectionate child who quickly learned from his father about the Great Spirit. One day, a storm frightened Mus-kin-gum, and he went missing. O-hi-o, his mother, searched for him with a group of young men. Tragically, they found Mus-kin-gum lying peacefully under the moonlight. O-hi-o's heartache was deep, but she bore her pain silently, as was the custom of her people. The young men wished they could bring Mus-kin-gum back to life for her.|"[""1.

The eldest son gently moved the child from his father's side to his mother's arms. As the child wept and embraced his mother, she led the procession down the steep path to their home. They buried Mus-kin-gum with honor, but O-hi-o lost interest in life. The child sought solace with his grandfather, visiting his father's grave daily to pray. The boy believed his father watched over them from the stars, but he developed a fear of thunder and lightning after a storm. Despite efforts from medicine men and prayers from the tribe, the boy's condition worsened. The tribe faced hardships with drought and sought a sacrifice to appease the Great Spirit for rain. They believed one life must be offered to save many, as they grappled with the consequences of the angry spirits.|"[""1.

The rain poured down heavily, unlike anything ever seen before. The cattle drank thirstily from the abundant water. After three days, the rain eased, and people emerged to find the valley transformed into a river. The wise men marveled at this miracle.

The prosperity of the land increased, with exceptional cattle, fruits, and crops. The fisheries thrived, and the Grand Reservoir became a vast body of water.
