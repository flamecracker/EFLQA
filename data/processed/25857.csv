"""Patty, you look lovely in that white chiffon dress,"" complimented Nan as they prepared for Patty's debut. Patty, with her violet eyes sparkling, was excited for the afternoon reception that marked her entrance into society.

Philip asked Nan to take a break, and she agreed. He joked about finding a quiet spot, but settled for a chair. Nan insisted on holding the fort, urging Nan to get refreshments. Mr. Galbraith admired Patty's capabilities and expressed concern about his daughter, Mona, lacking a mother figure. He wished Mona would accept a chaperon for guidance.

"""I wish she did, Mr. Galbraith,"" said Patty, earnestly, for the two were chatting alone, and no one else was nearby. ""I've thought and talked with my stepmother. Maybe I could convince Mona to do what you want."" ""I hope you can, Patty; Mona is dignified and proud. She's fond of a man named Lansing at the hotel. I've told her I dislike him, but she laughs it off. I believe Lansing is after her money. I need to talk to you more about this later. I can't keep you now, people are waiting.

Patty was upset. She thought Mona shouldn't have invited Mr. Lansing without asking her first. Nan, unaware of the tension, greeted Mr. Lansing warmly as Mona's friend. Patty managed a polite greeting but shot a disapproving look at Mona, who ignored it and whisked Mr. Lansing away. As the dancing began, Patty had no chance to discuss him with Nan. Despite feeling irritated, Patty danced with Philip Van Reypen and was in high demand due to her charm and grace. Roger's rude tone irked Patty, prompting her to defend Mr. Lansing to him, even though she knew he wasn't the right fit for Mona. Patty and Roger realized their bickering was childish, laughed it off, and continued dancing. Patty, though not openly rude, disapproved of Mr. Lansing's behavior and felt he lacked the refinement of a well-bred man.|"[""1.

Patty was taken aback by the man's informal way of speaking. Her friends used slang in a light-hearted manner, but this man seemed to use it in regular conversation. Mr. Lansing then accused Patty of being prejudiced against him and suggested someone influenced her. Patty decided to be honest and told him she wasn't used to being spoken to that way. Despite not liking him, she found Mr. Lansing to be a skilled dancer. However, his rude comment at the end of the dance made her change her mind about him. When it came time to make room on the stairs for more people, Patty hesitated. She noticed the disapproval from her friends but decided to welcome Mona and Mr. Lansing to sit with her.|"[""1.

Patty understood their message clearly. They implied that if she and Mona continued to associate with the man they disapproved of, they preferred not to be part of their group. Christine and Mr. Hepworth engaged in the conversation, and Mr. Lansing, influenced by Patty's earlier comments, refrained from using slang and became genuinely captivating. Patty was surprised when Christine expressed her approval of him. The evening passed joyfully with dancing, but Roger and Philip Van Reypen kept their distance from Patty. Despite feeling a bit hurt by her friends' behavior, Patty bid them goodnight politely. Later, over chocolate, Patty discussed slang with her stepmother, Nan, and reflected on the fairness of judging someone without knowing them. Patty then mentioned starting a proactive club with her friends, emphasizing the importance of taking action rather than just talking.|"[""1.

"Patty was determined to make a difference and bring comfort to others. With a long list of thank you notes to write for the flowers she received, she pondered over how to express her gratitude. She noticed the formality of Mr. Farnsworth's card and contrasted it with the warmth of ""Little Billee.""

"""Patty Fairfield,"" she said, reprovingly, ""you ought to be ashamed to think of sending a personal, lettery sort of a note like that, to a man who sent you the formalest kind of a message! He only sent the flowers, because convention demanded it! He never gave you one single thought after that last time he saw you,--and that's all there is about _that_!""

""No, thank you,"" and Mona tossed her head, disdainfully; ""I know what companions are! Snoopy old maids who won't let you do anything, or careless, easy-going old ladies who pay no attention to you. If I could have a companion of my own age and tastes, I'd like that,--but I suppose that wouldn't do.""

""Don't let's have too much organisation,"" said Clementine. ""Do you know, I think lots of clubs, especially charity clubs, have so much organisation that they haven't anything else. One club I joined fell to pieces before it was fairly started, because the two vice-presidents squabbled so.""

""I am,"" declared Elise, assuming an angelic expression, which made them all laugh, for Elise was really the one most likely to take offence at trifles, or to flare up impulsively if any one disagreed with her.
