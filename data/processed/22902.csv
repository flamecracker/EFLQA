"The two boys, Dick and Bob, were part of the Liberty Boys, a group of young patriots fighting for American independence. Walking along Wall Street in New York City, they noticed a man across the street who seemed to be spying on them. Aware of the British threat looming over the city, Dick suspected the man to be a spy. They led the man to Fraunces Tavern and engaged in boastful talk to throw him off. The man, displeased, scribbled a message on a pewter, which Dick intercepted. The message read, ""Follow Slater."" Realizing they were being watched, Dick instructed his friends to go to Trinity Church while he kept an eye on the spy. Bob later reported that the man had followed them to the church. To test the spies' observation skills, Dick and Bob exchanged coats at a nearby tavern."|"['1.

The man walked silently up the steps to the front door, unlocking it with a key. As he entered the dark hall, Dick felt a sudden fear. Had he made a mistake coming alone with an enemy?
