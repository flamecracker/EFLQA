Mr. Roscoe gazed out of the window at the beautiful scenery surrounding Castle Roscoe, pondering his decision about sending his son to a boarding school.

The second letter, however, offered a more reasonable rate of three hundred dollars per annum, emphasizing a nurturing and educational environment at Smith Institute.

"Dear Sir,

I have received your response regarding the school fees. I must express my concern at the high cost of five hundred dollars per year for board and schooling. This price is excessive and may limit access to education for many. I wish to clarify that my ward is not my nephew but was informally adopted by my late brother. As the estate now falls to me, I am responsible for his education and future. The fee of three hundred dollars per annum at your school seems more reasonable. I trust you maintain good discipline as I prefer Hector not to be overly indulged. He is a determined young man, and I am committed to providing him with a solid education to secure his future.

Sincerely,"|"[""1.

Socrates interrupted the silence, pressing Ben for the truth about the wallet incident. Ben recounted encountering Jim in the corridor and witnessing him planting the wallet on Roscoe.

Ben confronted Jim about a malicious plan he devised against Hector Roscoe. Jim's defeat by a smaller boy had diminished his standing among his peers, making them more willing to stand up to him. Despite his confidence, Jim found himself struggling in a conflict with two boys. Fortunately, Mr. Crabb, the usher, intervened just in time to prevent a potentially serious injury. Mr. Crabb reprimanded Jim for his disgraceful behavior and involvement in a plot against an innocent boy. Feeling dejected after the incident, Mr. Crabb discussed his uncertain future with Hector, expressing concerns about finding a new job. Hector, disillusioned with the school's leadership, shared his plans to leave due to incompetence and injustice.

"Dear Hector,

I am delighted to hear from you, but I would prefer to see you in person.

Your recommendation is enough for my father, and he will hire Mr. Crabb without further investigation; he can start immediately. Mr. Crabb will receive sixty dollars per month plus room and board, with ample time for personal study, perhaps in law or any other profession. If my cousin joins me in my studies, my father is willing to pay a hundred dollars a month, if that is agreeable.

The usher's face brightened as he heard the news. ""Roscoe,"" he exclaimed, ""you are like a blessing from above. I was feeling down, but now the future seems bright. Sixty dollars a month! It will change my life.""

The usher continued, ""No prisoner ever welcomed freedom more gratefully. To work for someone you despise, feeling like a helpless dependent, is a challenging situation. I have endured it for two years.""

Mr. Crabb's demeanor surprised Mr. Smith as the usher appeared composed and untroubled, contrary to expectations. The usher, in turn, was taken aback by Mr. Smith's unexpected overtures for reconciliation.

Socrates, perplexed by Mr. Crabb's nonchalant attitude, felt reinstatement was crucial despite his financial struggles. Mr. Smith, leaving the office content, was unaware of the heightened respect Mr. Crabb now held as a sought-after teacher in New York.
