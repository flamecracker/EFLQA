Both girls exclaimed in unison as they arrived at the end of the path and discovered a deep, rocky basin brimming with clear water gushing from above, flowing through ferns into a pool so serene and reflective that it mirrored their faces like a looking glass. Migwan, overwhelmed with delight, compared herself to mythical wood-nymphs and naiads. Mesmerized by the tranquil scene, they were interrupted by melodic piping from behind the bushes. The enchanting tune, reminiscent of fairy pipes, captivated them, evoking images of fauns and fairies. As the music abruptly ceased, leaving them spellbound, the camp bugle sounded, signaling the end of their reverie. After supper, the camp gathered for assembly and Sing-Out in the craft bungalow, adorned with rustic decorations.

"Miss Armstrong, the swimming teacher from Australia known as ""Tiny"" due to her small size, was called up to demonstrate her skills.

At Camp Keewaydin, the swimming area was split into three sections. The Minnows, who couldn't swim, practiced in the shallow cove on the left.

Just before seven in the evening, the girls from the Avenue were dancing in the bungalow. Sahwah, Hinpoha, and Agony quietly left the group and went down to the dock. There, they found Katherine, Oh-Pshaw, and Jean Lawrence waiting with others like Migwan, Gladys, Bengal Virden, and Tiny Armstrong. Miss Judy was untying the launch. The group got into the launch, and Miss Judy started the engine. They rode a short way up the river to the Whaleback, a small island shaped like a whale's back. They disembarked on the beach, where a fire was lit. Miss Judy initiated the new girls by asking them to recognize themselves in drawings. Jo Severance mimicked Carmen Chadwick, causing laughter among the girls. Agony felt embarrassed, wondering how the Lone Wolf knew about Carmen's bathing attitude.|['1.

"Miss Amesbury watched the show with joyous tears running down her face. ""This is the funniest thing I've ever seen!"" she told Mary Sylvester. ""The line 'who else _could_ it be' is just perfect."" Agony felt a bit let down that her portrait wasn't painted, wishing it would have brought her more attention. She was only a part of the crowd at camp so far, with the older girls ignoring her. After all the portraits were done, the girls were asked to do solo acts. Some sang, some spoke, some danced, and the worse they did, the louder the cheers. A girl named Noel Carrington surprised everyone by whistling a beautiful tune with her fingers. Migwan and Gladys recognized it from the woods. Noel's performance was a hit, and she received a standing ovation. The group later went for a moonlit swim, enjoying the magic of the night. Agony, watching the river alone, was joined by Mary Sylvester. The rest of the camp had gone to the village, leaving Agony behind.

Mary and Agony were enjoying the cool spring house of Mrs. Simmons when Mary shared her dream of going to Japan. The spring house, covered in vines, was a refreshing stop before their walk through the woods. Mary, accidentally falling into the water, worried about the delay it would cause to get dry clothes. Agony came up with a clever idea to split her bloomers for Mary to wear, ensuring they could continue their journey without going back. As they walked, they encountered a man in a wheelchair under a pine tree, observing a distressed mother robin trapped by a string.

Mary showed incredible bravery by climbing a tree to rescue a robin. She had to swing herself across to reach the bird hanging from a branch.

"The small group of boats had circled an island and was now paddling upstream, gliding through moonlit paths and dark shadows. As they neared a rocky ledge, a stunning sight captured their attention - a figure in white robes dancing gracefully in the moonlight, with lilies in her yellow hair. ""Gladys!"" Migwan exclaimed proudly. The dancer, revealed to be Agony, joined the girls in the canoe after her enchanting performance. Agony explained it was her idea, inspired by the evening's water supper plan. Despite Miss Amesbury missing the spectacle, the girls serenaded her with a heartfelt song below her balcony. Touched by the gesture, Miss Amesbury thanked them and invited the girls to visit her in the daytime.

The Winnebagos happily headed towards the Alley, thrilled that their plan had worked. Migwan was especially excited as she had finally been invited to Miss Amesbury's balcony.

Agony pondered whether she should reveal the truth about a certain incident or keep it hidden. The thought of the disgrace made her heart sink, but the fear of the truth leaking out through someone else was even worse.

Sahwah was thrilled and full of energy, her eyes shining and cheeks flushed with excitement.

Her love for the wilderness and its creatures set her apart from her peers. As the Winnebagos paddled up the river, Sahwah imagined herself as Sacajawea on an expedition with Lewis and Clark. The group found a perfect camping spot by the river, sheltered by tall pines and surrounded by evening primroses. After a satisfying supper cooked over a cheerful fire, they prepared for bed under makeshift shelters made from overturned canoes.

"With trembling hands, she gently removed the letter from the envelope and, with cheeks burning with embarrassment, she read Miss Amesbury's letter. It resembled the one Mary had sent to Jo Severance, filled with vivid descriptions of her travels, yet it made no mention of her or the robin. As she carefully placed the letter back in the envelope, relief washed over her, causing her fingers to shake even more. After slipping the letter between the sketches, she turned away from the table, leaning against the railing. Looking down at the sunlit river, her eyes glazed over with thoughts elsewhere.

The mention of Edwin Langham left her head spinning, the realization that she might meet her idol causing a whirlwind of emotions within her.

Agony, overwhelmed, fled to the woods, seeking solace under a towering tree. The dream she had longed for was within reach, yet her actions had made it unattainable.

Agony sat in distress, her hands clenched, avoiding eye contact. Suddenly, a bark from above caught her attention. It was Micky, the camp's pup, who had found her hiding spot. Despite her command to leave, Micky barked louder, happy to have found her. In his excitement, Micky leaped into a ravine, injuring himself on a stump. Agony hurried to tend to him, fearing the camp would hear his cries. As she comforted Micky, the steamer's whistle signaled the return of the girls. Agony, with numb feet, attempted to leave her hiding place but slipped, hitting her head. It wasn't until nightfall that she was found, after a search was launched.

"Agony basked in camp fame, with admirers flocking to her tent all day. Miss Amesbury read to her, the cook sent special dishes adorned with wildflowers, the orchestra serenaded her, and poets penned songs in her honor. Fame was swift in camps, but Agony found it burdensome. Even the book left by Edwin Langham, ""The Desert Garden,"" felt like a taunt. Despite the mocking, Agony maintained a cheerful facade. Planning for Stunt Night, where Camp Keewaydin's Avenue and Alley competed, stirred excitement.

"The Alley's performance for Stunt Night was a humorous take on Camp life, titled ""THE LAST VOYAGE OF SINBAD THE SAILOR."" The idea sparked when Migwan got inspired while listening to Dr. Grayson read the Arabian Nights. The group was excited and began rehearsing on Whaleback to avoid detection.

Agony was relieved when Migwan agreed to the assignment of parts. But when Agony noticed Bengal's mischievous look, she pulled Bengal aside to inquire.
