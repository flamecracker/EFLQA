I have many wild animals, and it was while some of my men were hunting tapirs, jaguars, and leopards that I started tracking giants. This happened about a year ago, but I haven't been able to send for the giants yet. Here's what happened: I sent Jake Poddington, one of my best men, to hunt tapirs and other animals in South America. Unfortunately, he didn't have much luck along the Amazon. The region was already depleted of circus animals, becoming more populated, and it was hard to hire native hunters like before. Eventually, Jake headed to the Argentine Republic along the Salado river, where he discovered something extraordinary. He hinted at finding a race of giant natives but mysteriously disappeared during his quest. Despite my efforts to locate him, the fate of Jake remains unknown, leaving behind a puzzling mystery.|['1.

A circus man approached Tom Swift with a unique request. He spoke of giants in the interior of South America and the mysterious disappearance of Jake Poddington. The circus man asked Tom to undertake a daring mission - to find a giant, rescue Jake if he was alive, or discover the truth if he was not. Tom, along with his friend Mr. Damon, was deeply moved by the request. The thought of the lush South American jungle, dangerous animals, and the possibility of giants stirred Tom's imagination.

To find the missing man who journeyed through the jungles, the group plans to travel on foot or by horse, slowly making inquiries along the way. An airship won't be useful in the dense jungle, but a small one might be handy as a deterrent for natives or to impress giants if they encounter any. Tom suggests taking the Lark, a powerful machine that can carry up to three people and be disassembled into sections. Once the expedition is ready, they can set off to start the search. Mr. Preston is eager to begin and offers financial support for expenses. The group discusses the logistics of the journey and the need for a detailed map of South America to guide their search.|"['1.

"""I don't know how he will know, but he will. We circus men have peculiar ways of discovering things. I wouldn't be surprised if he was already planning to send an expedition after me,"" said Tom. ""Well, we'll try to outsmart him, like we did in Mexico,"" he continued, focusing on preparations for their journey to South America.

Eradicate, the colored helper, expressed his concerns about coconuts in his mouth, fearing for his few remaining teeth. Tom reassured him that in South America, monkeys would drop coconuts with the shells broken for easy consumption, along with palm leaf fans to cool off. Tom believed South America would be a fun adventure.

As everyone busied themselves with trip preparations, Tom hesitated to confide in Eradicate due to his tendency to talk too much.

Tom was determined to head to giant land, armed with his electric rifles to save Jake Poddington. Despite initially planning for peaceful means, Tom decided to bring along the powerful but non-lethal weapons in case they needed to defend themselves against hostile tribes. Back in the library, Tom demonstrated the unique electric rifles to Mr. Preston and the others. These rifles could project concentrated globules of electricity that could be adjusted in strength, from gently putting enemies to sleep to causing significant damage. Tom had used these rifles to fight off red pygmies in Africa and even to take down elephants. Mr. Preston shared that his rival had shifted focus to finding a two-headed crocodile, leaving Tom's giant quest unopposed. With luck, Tom hoped to succeed in his mission to capture a giant.|"['1.

Early the next morning, a group of brave explorers set out for New York in search of a land of giants. Unaware of the dangers ahead, they embarked on their journey.

Mr. Preston bid farewell as the bell rang. The weather was pleasant during the first week of the voyage, and few felt seasick. The Reverend Mr. Blinderpool, despite claiming little travel experience, shared mysterious tales of distant lands. Tom and his friends grew suspicious of the minister's motives. Suddenly, smoke billowed from the hold where Tom's belongings were stored. Concerned, Tom and his friend rushed to prevent a disaster. An officer warned against panic, but Tom insisted on helping to extinguish the fire. Tom urged the officer to keep calm and prevent any commotion among the passengers.

"Tom and the officer vanished from sight, leaving Ned puzzled about the situation. He quickly reassured Mr. Damon and Eradicate that there was no danger, though Tom's actions hinted otherwise. Meanwhile, Tom and the officer navigated through thick smoke in the compartment. The officer illuminated the area with yellow electric lights to aid their search. Tom, amidst the smoke, located a box marked with his initials. He swiftly moved it away from a glowing fire amid cotton bales. The crew efficiently extinguished the fire, leaving only a few damaged items. Tom shared a secret plan with Ned, cautioning him to keep it discreet.

Tom and his friends were on a ship journey when they noticed something strange about a clergyman on board. Ned saw the supposed clergyman, Mr. Blinderpool, smoking and playing cards with suspicious men. Ned thought Mr. Blinderpool might be a gambler in disguise. They decided to stay away from him. As the voyage continued, Mr. Blinderpool tried to befriend Tom and his friends but failed. He then tried to get information from Eradicate, but Eradicate was too smart for him. The group was preparing to arrive in Buenos Ayres, and Tom planned to hire pack mules and porters for their journey ahead.

Eradicate, with a wide grin, reassured Massa Damon that nothing could hurt him more than a hard head. He thanked Mistah Monkey for the nuts and jumped off his mule to collect them. San Pedro demonstrated how to open a coconut for its refreshing juice. As they journeyed north, the monkeys multiplied, becoming a nuisance. Crossing the Parana river, they ventured into unexplored territory in search of giants. Suddenly, Ned warned of an approaching stampede of wild horses. Tom refused to flee, opting to use electric rifles to divert the stampede. The group quickly secured their mules and prepared to face the oncoming chaos.

"""Hurry!"" urged San Pedro, and Tom, Ned, and the others rushed to secure the animals. All the animals were tied down except for one carrying two light boxes salvaged from a fire. Tom decided to take the mule with the boxes to the rocks to prevent any mishaps. As the horses approached, San Pedro called for help from the natives to control the mule. Amidst the chaos, Eradicate calmly approached the mule, soothed it, and led it to safety without any resistance. Meanwhile, the electric rifles were prepared to deter the stampeding horses.

Ned and his chum were just in time to witness the stampeding animals as they nearly doubled back on their trail upon seeing the human beings. The sight completed the scare, causing the creatures to swing off even more. San Pedro decided to send a man to find the missing animal that had broken free and run with the wild horses. Fortunately, aside from a lost box, no harm was done. The group rested in a fertile valley that night. Tom planned to inquire about the location of the giant land soon, but not before traveling a few more days to ensure his men wouldn't be scared off. After three more days of travel, the group entered a region teeming with wild beasts, monkeys, and dense jungle. Tom suspected they were getting closer to their destination as they encountered more tropical flora and fauna. The evening after his talk with Ned, Tom was optimistic that a nearby village held the answers they sought. The scene took a sudden turn when a large serpent dropped from a tree and coiled around Mr. Damon, leaving him in a perilous situation. Tom quickly grabbed an electric rifle to aid his friend.|['1.

Tom learned they were on an early hunt when they found them. The giants' main town was half a day away. Tom believed in giants, citing historical records of giants up to nine feet tall.

The conversation was abruptly halted by loud voices from the large men. Oom signaled Tom, and they emerged from the woods onto a vast grassy plain, where big grass and mud huts clustered on the other side. This city wasn't extraordinary, much like others in wild South America or Africa. The natives gathered at a central market square, with huts stretching out like streets. Near the market square stood a large hut, likely the king's palace. Oom guided Tom and his group there, where they were to meet the chief ruler. The pack train with their supplies was behind them, and the townspeople surrounded them. Oom's shout was echoed by the giants kneeling down. The king emerged from his palace, towering over ten feet tall, flanked by men almost as large. The king blessed his people and beckoned Tom and his friends to sit. Tom faced the giant king fearlessly, believing showing no fear was the best approach. The king, named Kosk, questioned Oom, the chief hunter. Tom followed the narrative through gestures, even though the language was unknown. The king, accompanied by his brothers Tola and Koku, seemed to deliberate on their fate. Tom hoped to learn the language and offer to take one giant back to the United States. These South American giants were not just tall but also powerful with muscular builds, unlike historical giants. Tom noticed the king's son, a tall youth, who wore a jaguar skin as a sign of royalty|"[""1.

The show for the audience had ended, and Tom felt it was time to make a gesture of goodwill towards the king. He spotted their pack animals nearby, one carrying a phonograph and some records. Signaling that he needed to bring in his belongings, Tom left the hut, instructing his friends to wait. The king and the other giants observed him with curiosity but did not intervene. Tom set up the phonograph, playing a lively dance tune. The giants were startled at first but then cheered, calling Tom a wizard. The king, delighted, led them to a comfortable hut where they would stay. Giant women brought out a feast on wooden platters covered with palm leaves. The group found an array of food including lamb, fowl, rice, sweet potatoes, and cider. After Oom showed them where to find dishes, they enjoyed the giant's hospitality.|"['1.

The man quickly announced his arrival at the giant's village, causing a stir among the giants who were preoccupied with Tom and his friends. The circus man, unanticipated by the giants, advanced confidently. Despite their isolation and strength, the giants were taken aback by the unexpected visitors. Hank Delby, who had been following Tom's group, revealed his intentions to compete for the giants. Tom confronted Delby for his deceitful actions, leading to a tense exchange. Delby declared a rivalry, stating that it was every man for himself in this endeavor. Tom remained wary of Delby's motives but acknowledged that they might need to unite against any potential threats from the giants.

Tom was interrupted by Oom, the large hunting giant, who tapped him on the shoulder and directed him towards the king's hut. Tom, looking worried, joined his friends inside. From a window, he saw Delby being escorted to the king. The sound of a phonograph gifted by Tom played in the background, reassuring him that the king might remain friendly. Ned, hearing the music, remarked on their impressive gifts. Tom, however, expressed concern that the giants might favor Delby. As they watched Delby play a banjo for the king, Tom worried about outdoing him in gaining the giants' favor. Despite the mule drivers' different reactions to the giants, Tom believed the giants were peaceful and misunderstood due to their size.|"[""1.

Tom proudly presented a small toy circus powered by a miniature steam engine burning alcohol. As they were about to leave, a group of giant men with clubs and spears approached. The chief giant ushered Tom and his friends back into the hut and stationed guards outside. It seemed Delby had turned the king against them, making them captives. The friends discussed defending themselves if needed, suspecting Delby's false tales had influenced the giants. Tom devised a plan to counter Delby's deceit and prepare to withstand any potential attack. They fortified the hut with boxes and bales, readying their electric rifles for defense.

Tom and his friends were in a tight spot, surrounded by giant guards in a strange land. They had a plan to use fireworks to scare the giants away. Tom had brought along a variety of fireworks, including sky rockets and Roman candles. However, their original idea to use blasting powder had to be abandoned due to the changing circumstances. Despite the noise of setting up the fireworks, the giants didn't seem alarmed. As night fell, Tom and his friends set up a firing stand near a window facing the woods. They waited for the perfect moment to set off the fireworks to create a distraction. The giant guards were still outside, but they didn't interfere. Tom hoped that their fireworks display would convince the giants that they possessed powerful magic and secure their freedom.|"[""1.

"Excitedly, Ned exclaimed, ""Great idea!"" Observing the scene unfold, he pointed out, ""That's their plan."" From the palace emerged two towering figures, likely the king's brothers, escorting a circus man who appeared miniature between them. The circus man's triumphant smile was visible as he glanced towards the hut where Tom and his friends were held captive. Bright torches illuminated the giants' village as the circus man was escorted away. The sky lit up with colorful fireworks set off by Tom and his friends, resembling a festive celebration. Amidst the dazzling display, fear gripped the giants and their families, evident in their thunderous cries.

Refreshed, they eagerly awaited the meal brought by wary women cooks who quickly departed after placing the trays down. ""What if Mr. Poddington is here, able to translate for us?"" Tom pondered.

"The huge giant swiftly leaped up, letting out a loud howl that shook the hut's roof. His arms were stiff as poles, tangled in knots, unable to release the shiny handles. Despite his efforts, the giant could not free himself. He cried out in terror, while his companions watched in amazement. ""Release me from this dreadful magic!"" he pleaded. Tom, with a flick of a switch, turned off the electric current. Instantly, the giant's arms relaxed, and the handles clattered to the ground.

Despite three attempts to charge, they were repelled each time by the captives, who were always prepared. Frustrated, the men abandoned their efforts to overpower them and hurried away, some entering the king's hut. The captives felt relieved but knew they needed to escape. Tom insisted on capturing a giant for the circus. Mr. Poddington suggested enlisting the help of the king's brothers, who resented him. They devised a daring plan to involve the twins in a royal conspiracy. Despite facing challenges, they were determined to execute their bold scheme with the help of Poddington's language skills and local connections.|"[""1.

"""No, I won't try. If they agree, they'll walk through the woods. We'll meet at a landmark far from the plane. We'll take what we can, leave the rest. It's possible, Ned,"" said Tom. ""I'll saw the hut's beams quickly. We'll start the plane downhill and fly. Then we'll find the giant brothers in the woods and return to civilization."" Jake Poddington, through an old woman friend, arranged a secret meeting with the royal twins. They waited anxiously. To ensure secrecy, they covered windows and doors with canvas.

Our friends were tense, uncertain of what each day held. They toiled on the aeroplane in the hut, eager for the moment to test it outdoors. Beams were cut with Tom's carpentry tools. The royal brothers brought temporary beams to support the roof when the others were removed for the aeroplane's escape. They planned to flee, meeting in the forest at a landmark hill. The giants would lag behind, so provisions and hidden mules were readied for Tom and his friends to return to the coast after their flight. Tom ensured the aeroplane was ready for a swift departure. Suddenly awakened at midnight by a noise, Tom rallied his friends to defend against the giants, instructing to disable, not kill. Despite fear, they stood united, armed with electric rifles and Eradicate's booming shotgun.|['1.

"The bright light drew closer, revealing big men carrying torches made of blazing wood, seemingly aiming to set the prison hut on fire. ""Give 'em another taste!"" yelled Ned as the electric rifles shot blue flames, toppling more giants. Tom and his friends avoided using more torches to stay hidden from view, aware of the deadly blow guns. The giants began to retreat, meeting others with torches. Tom regretted not leaving earlier to avoid the conflict. The circus man lit Roman candles, illuminating the scene brilliantly. The outnumbered group stood their ground against the giants in the South American jungle. Despite the odds, they fought back fiercely. With giants preparing to attack, Tom saw the only escape: the aeroplane. Urging everyone to act quickly, they began to dismantle the wall to make way for their last chance at survival."|['1.

Tom and his friends agreed to a plan to create a gangplank using ropes attached to key beams in a structure. As they pulled out the supports, the wall fell outward, forming a smooth runway for their aeroplane to take off. The giants were surprised by the sudden event, but fortunately, they did not attack. The propellers of the plane spun rapidly as they prepared for departure. The group had escaped the giants' prison and was now searching for the giant brothers to return to civilization. After setting up camp, they decided to dismantle the aeroplane for transport. With provisions, blankets, and weapons, they planned to journey back to the United States. Tom communicated with the giant twins, who had hidden mules and food nearby. They prepared to start their trek with the help of the mules and their companions.|"['1.

"""What did you say?"" gasped the man. ""Am I too old? Listen here, big man, I've been with the Swift family for many years, and I'm just as agile as ever. I can take care of Mr. Tom just fine. Now, go back to where you belong, big man, and don't let me hear any more of that nonsense. Nobody serves Mr. Tom Swift but me. Do you hear me, big man?"" Koku gave the man a look, then lifted him off the mule and set him on the ground. Eradicate, with tears in his eyes, reached out to Tom, who reassured him. From then on, Eradicate rode on one side of Tom while Koku walked on the other. Tom renamed Koku to August and decided to keep him as his personal attendant. The journey back to the coast was tough, but they made it. The two giants were glad to leave their country and were simple and affectionate beings. Tom decided to keep August as his attendant."|"['1.
