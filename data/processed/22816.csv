Buster Bear encountered some puzzling muddy pools while out fishing. The water was so murky he couldn't see if there were any fish. Buster suspected mischief and thought Joe Otter might be behind it. Despite the setback, Buster found humor in the situation and chuckled at the thought of Joe Otter trying to outsmart him. Buster, being clever himself, devised a plan to turn the tables on Joe Otter. Little did Joe Otter know, his actions unintentionally led to Buster having a great breakfast. Joe Otter and Billy Mink were upset that others were fishing in the Laughing Brook, thinking it was their exclusive spot.

Little Joe was determined to teach Buster Bear a lesson for disturbing their fishing spot. The next morning, he hid near the pool where Buster usually came. As soon as he saw Buster approaching, Little Joe scared away all the fish and muddied the water. But Buster outsmarted him by waiting downstream where the fish would swim.

Little Joe Otter was furious when he realized that his plan to spoil Buster Bear's fishing had backfired. He sulked at the Smiling Pool until Grandfather Frog asked what was wrong. Billy Mink spilled the beans, causing laughter all around. Little Joe insulted everyone for finding Buster's cleverness amusing. Grandfather Frog remarked that Buster wasn't a thief but a bully. Little Joe was too proud to admit his fear of Buster. Although he was a tough fighter, he needed to learn humility. Grandfather Frog secretly enjoyed Buster outsmarting Little Joe, teaching him a valuable lesson about making friends with those smarter and stronger.

Little Joe Otter believed that making friends with Buster Bear was the right thing to do. Early the next morning, he caught a big trout, his favorite food, but instead of eating it, he left it on a log for Buster Bear to find. Little Joe hid nearby, waiting to see what would happen. A mischievous weasel named Shadow tried to steal the fish, but Little Joe scared him away. Eventually, Buster Bear arrived, attracted by the scent of the trout. Farmer Brown's boy, who also loved fishing, was in the Green Forest that morning, whistling happily as he fished for trout. Despite not catching any fish initially, he remained patient and continued fishing, hoping for a bite.|"[""1.

One day, Farmer Brown's boy went fishing at the Laughing Brook. He was patient, but he didn't catch any fish. Puzzled, he found trout heads by the pool. He suspected Billy Mink. As he walked, he found more trout heads but no fish. This puzzled him even more. Little did he know, Little Joe Otter and Buster Bear were watching and laughing at him. His hair stood on end from fear, not anger, a rare occurrence. Fear can cause hair to rise, just like anger does for animals like Bowser the Hound and Black Pussy.|"[""1.

Farmer Brown's boy had never experienced anything like it before. He was usually fearless, but this time he was taken aback by what he discovered. He stumbled upon fish heads on the bank, realizing someone else had been fishing, explaining his lack of catch. Puzzled by the thought of little Billy Mink eating all those trout, he didn't consider Little Joe Otter. As he pondered this, near the Laughing Brook, he spotted a huge footprint in the mud. Shocked, he felt his hair stand on end. Unaware of Buster Bear's presence in the Green Forest, he was spooked by the footprint. Feeling watched, he decided to head home, feeling relieved only upon leaving the forest.

Chatterer regretted not keeping quiet as he climbed to the tree's top, teeth chattering in fear. Buster Bear's approach left him stranded with no nearby tree to escape to.

The question remains: Did Buster Bear steal Farmer Brown's boy's pail? Stealing means taking something that doesn't belong to you.

Buster struggled to remove the pail, but he couldn't. Farmer Brown's boy was equally surprised and scared to see Buster Bear. Buster, usually shy around humans, was stuck and scared too.

His friends like Chatterer the Red Squirrel and Happy Jack the Gray Squirrel were there too, adding to his distress. Buster just wanted to hide and get rid of the pail, but with so many eyes on him, he couldn't find a safe place. Even timid Whitefoot the Wood Mouse was watching.
