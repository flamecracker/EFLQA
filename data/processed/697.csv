The princess, known for her wisdom, fell victim to a wicked spell cast by her aunt, a witch. The spell stripped the baby of her gravity, causing her to float towards the ceiling. The nurse, in a panic, had to use a set of steps to retrieve the baby. The king, upon discovering this strange phenomenon, tried to hold the baby but found her floating as well.

Meanwhile, even with some awkward incidents and troubles she caused her parents, the young princess continued to laugh and grow. She didn't become fat, but instead, she became plump and tall as she reached seventeen. Despite her carefree nature, the worst trouble she found herself in was being stuck in a chimney, from which a boy saved her, earning both fame and a soot-covered face. She often laughed at everything and everyone she encountered, even when faced with serious news. Her inability to see the seriousness in any situation led her to laugh at news of war and danger.

"The king and queen finally decided to address the princess's peculiar condition by calling a council with two wise Chinese philosophers, Hum-Drum and Kopy-Keck. When the princess was brought in, she amusingly flitted around the room before collapsing in laughter. Despite her antics, the king reminded her of a promise involving being flown like a kite. The philosophers, well aware of the princess's unique situation, discussed her condition, theorizing that her soul belonged to another planet, perhaps Mercury. They debated the metaphysical implications of her predicament and the practical steps to take. The king emphasized her ""infirmity,"" unknowingly making a pun, while the queen chuckled.

This includes studying its animal, vegetable, mineral, social, moral, political, scientific, literary, musical, artistic, and metaphysical histories. Starting from the Chinese dynasty to Japan, she must delve into geology and the history of extinct animal species. Hum-Drum interrupts, proposing a physical explanation for the princess's condition, suggesting her heart's motion is reversed. To cure her, he suggests phlebotomy and ligatures while in a warm bath.

How could they make the princess cry? The philosophers were at a loss. They called for a beggar, the best in his craft, to evoke her tears. The beggar was given all he needed to prepare, but his efforts were futile. Instead of tears, the princess burst into laughter, sending the beggar away empty-handed. Even the king's whipping failed to bring forth a single tear. Meanwhile, a prince set out on a quest to find a worthy princess to marry.

Early the next morning, the prince went in search of food and found it at a forester's hut. He was provided with all he needed for many days, never worrying about future needs. Whenever Care appeared, the prince dismissed him graciously. Returning to his watch-cave after breakfast, he saw the princess on the lake with the king and queen, identified by their crowns, and a colorful fleet of boats. As the day progressed, the prince longed for the cool water and the princess. At twilight, the boats departed, leaving only the princess's boat. She stayed, and the prince sang.

The princess adored the lake, but her joy turned to fear when she suspected it was shrinking. Ignoring the prince, she frantically searched the shore, confirming her worst fears as the lake slowly vanished. Distraught, she realized her life was tied to the lake's existence. Desperate to save it, a reward was offered for a solution. The old princess, jealous of her niece's love for the lake, used dark magic to curse it. Summoning a sinister snake, she plotted its demise.

Locking the door firmly, the witch-princess descended into a dark, narrow passage. She repeated this process a hundred times, unlocking and descending through each door. Finally, she entered a vast cave beneath the lake, where she untwined a snake from her body. The snake, held high, searched the cavern's roof as the witch circled the cave, muttering and knitting. For seven days and nights, they remained in this eerie dance until the snake shriveled up. The witch, startled, pocketed the snake and fled as a drop of water trembled where the snake had clung. She rushed back through the hundred doors to her cellar, listening to the water's rush. Unsatisfied, she embarked on a moonlit journey around the lake, casting water to dry up all the springs, silencing the land.|['1.

Once the princess abruptly left him, the prince never had another meeting with her. Despite glimpses in the lake, she did not return at night. As the lake dried, so did she, mirroring its decline. Alarmed by the falling water levels, the prince disguised himself and sought the lord chamberlain's help. Recognizing the prince's deeper motive, the chamberlain granted him the role of the princess's shoeblack. The prince learned of the princess's distress but could not reach her. Meanwhile, the princess secluded herself, consumed by the lake's demise. As the lake shrunk, revealing mud and creatures, a group found a golden plate at the bottom. It bore an inscription:--|"[""1.
