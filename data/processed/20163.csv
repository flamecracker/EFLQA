"In a quaint bedroom on the top floor of an old-fashioned home in a London suburb, a fourteen-year-old girl was busy rummaging through the lower shelves of a large bookcase. Her approach was far from organized; she haphazardly tossed out a mishmash of items onto the floor - books, papers, art supplies, music, stamps, postcards, knitting wool, embroidery threads, and various odds and ends.

"Irene chuckled quietly. The little girl with flaxen hair caught her attention; she felt drawn to her rather than avoiding her. Travel companions seemed more a matter of chance than choice as the crowd from the train at Dover mixed like colored glass in a kaleidoscope. Irene's focus was sticking with her family as they navigated through barriers, showed tickets, and boarded the Channel steamer to France. Her father, a seasoned traveler, secured deck-chairs for the family. Mrs. Beverley opted for the deck due to the crowded conditions below. Irene, bundled up on her chair, watched Dover's white cliffs disappear as the ship sailed into the Channel, leaving behind England. The voyage was rough, but Irene managed to avoid seasickness by focusing on a magazine. Once in Calais, they boarded a train to Paris. Irene glimpsed the little girl, ""Little Flaxen,"" and her family as they settled in a reserved compartment.

Irene was unfazed by Lorna's need for closeness as she had her own interests. She had a wonderful holiday in Naples and eagerly shared her experiences. She talked about her family so much that Lorna felt like she knew them well. Irene invited Lorna to visit, but understood if she was hesitant. The school had a plan for educational outings, like the upcoming trip to Pompeii. The girls studied Greek and Roman history, and had lectures about Pompeii. While photos were helpful, nothing compared to visiting the actual site. Miss Morley would lead a group to Pompeii, including new students and a mascot for good luck. As they gathered for the trip, Delia reminded everyone to bring their lunch and warned against bringing cameras inside the ruins.|['1.

Miss Morley has a unique permit from the government to sketch or take photos in Pompeii. No one can snap a picture or draw without this permit. Officials will check Miss Morley's ticket to prevent overcrowding by artists and to sell their own photos. The group will take an electric tram from Fossato to Castellamare, then a short drive to Pompeii. The tram runs along the coast, connecting towns and villages. Many visitors were eager for the excursion that day. At the Villa Camellia, they boarded the tram with locals like hatless Italian girls, women with orange baskets, a sailor with a child, and a stout old padre. The cheerful atmosphere on the tram, filled with smiling faces, was infectious due to the sunny weather. The journey offered stunning views of the sea, cliffs, olive groves, and vibrant flora. Residents along the way were seen doing various tasks outdoors, unfazed by the passing tram.|"[""1.

Delia leaned out of the car window, trying to take in everything at once. Her school hat flew off, lost forever as the tram wouldn't stop. Carrie joked about the hat, mentioning its significance in Italy. The girls faced beggars in Italy, a common sight there. Miss Morley warned them not to give money and to stick together. They bargained for a carriage to Pompeii. The drive was exciting, but Pompeii was the main attraction. They were assigned a polite Italian guide who spoke no English. Pompeii's ruins amazed the girls, showcasing Roman architecture. The guide led them through the streets, showing them ancient fountains, shops, baths, and theaters.|['1.

The scene at Pompeii was one of complete desolation. The ruins basked in the Italian sunshine, with Vesuvius looming above, almost as if still overseeing the aftermath of its destruction. It was hard to picture the bustling crowds that once inhabited these now silent streets. Some houses were fenced off and locked, preserving remnants of Pompeii's domestic life. The girls marveled at Casa Dei Vettii's painted walls, mosaic floors, and statues. They even joked about leaving a visiting card for the former owners. However, Irene's attempt to take a secret photo landed her in trouble with the guide and Miss Morley. Irene had to surrender her camera as photography was forbidden, a lesson learned the hard way during their visit to the ancient ruins.|"[""1.

The guide patiently waited as the girls had lunch, then hurried them to the House of Pansa, a grand Roman mansion. They admired the atrium, tablinum, peristyle, and kitchen with snake mosaics. Though fascinating, it grew tiring, and some girls found the Italian guide's explanations exhausting. Delia whispered to Irene, expressing boredom and a desire to escape Miss Morley's lectures. Irene shared chocolates to lift Delia's spirits. As they slipped away, Irene lamented the guide stealing her camera. Delia pondered ancient customs and yearned for modern comforts.

Miss Morley was engrossed in conversation with student No. 24 as she led the group. Unbeknownst to her, Irene and Delia sneaked away to catch a glimpse of the stunning city view from atop a wall. The scene was breathtaking, showcasing the city's architecture, cypress trees, and distant smoking mountains. Lost in the beauty, the girls stayed longer than planned. Meanwhile, the custodian, unaware of the girls left behind, was preoccupied with his newspaper and snack. When the group realized Irene and Delia were missing, a search ensued. The custodian was retrieved, unlocking the door with no acknowledgment of his neglect. Miss Morley scolded the girls for wandering off and stressed the importance of staying together.

The group departed Fossato early on a steamboat bound for Naples. Upon arrival, they hopped on a local train to Vesuvius. Due to limited seating, there was a chaotic rush for seats until Miss Morley, with a discreet tip to the conductor, secured a compartment for the group. They found themselves squeezed among locals and tourists from various countries, including lively Swedes and well-dressed Japanese travelers exploring Europe. The train set off after a flurry of activity, passing through Naples' poorer neighborhoods with colorful yet worn-down houses surrounded by gardens. As the train journeyed on, they traversed vineyards and orchards bursting with almond, peach, and cherry blossoms. The banks of the railway were adorned with vibrant flowers typical of March in Southern Italy. Further along the journey, they marveled at the transition of vegetation from cactuses and olives to chestnut and oak trees, signaling their approach to the volcanic region. Despite the looming presence of Vesuvius, locals continued their daily routines, cultivating the land with resilience. The group then switched to an electric railway at Pugliano for the final ascent up Vesuvius, where they witnessed the stark beauty of the landscape evolving with each passing moment.|['1.

Miss Morley explained the fertile volcanic soil that fosters splendid vine growth. People risk their lives for fruitful farms, believing the mountain's calmness makes it safe. The electric railway's operation proves safety, with daily crater checks telegraphed to Naples. The journey upward over lava fields resembled a giant's paint palette. At the observatory, they transferred to a funicular railway for the summit. A scuffle over a rosemary bouquet ensued between Irene and Peachy. As they ascended, the railway revealed breathtaking views above the clouds, with smoke and distant landscapes. Guides led the group along a cinder path to the volcano's crater, where booming sounds and smoke added to the eerie experience.|"['1.

The group was in awe of the impressive surroundings as they ventured towards the crater. The guides, in their gray uniforms with red-banded caps, provided comfort and encouragement. Delia clung to Peachy, Lorna held Irene's arm tightly, and Miss Morley reassured everyone of their safety. As they approached the crater, the mist cleared, revealing a deep rocky ravine with vapors rising like a witch's cauldron. The guides urged them forward to catch a glimpse of the fiery crater. Descending among lava and cinders, they felt the warmth beneath their boots from steam jets. At a ledge of volcanic rock, they marveled at the yellow sulfur top of the cone and a molten lava lake below. The guides even offered souvenirs of sulfur lumps and lava pieces with embedded coins. Despite the challenging climb back, the group made it safely, except for the guides' unexpected demand for excessive tips at the end, leaving the girls feeling indignant but wiser about the customs of Naples.|"['1.

Miss Morley described the locals as a mix of races, influenced by the Spanish. She advised making allowances for their different customs and temperaments. Due to their poverty, they might see tourists as easy targets for money. It's best to stay calm and not get upset, even if they seem excited. The group encountered a woman offering postcards and a shortcut to the hotel, but she led them to her own restaurant. Miss Morley was frustrated but led the group back to the hotel for lunch. The girls were excited to send postcards stamped with the Vesuvius postmark. They encountered various vendors on the platform, including a blind man singing, a woman selling oranges, and a girl offering lava cameos. Irene bargained for a mascot considered lucky, eventually getting it at half the initial price.|"['1.

The train rushed downhill, leaving ashes and lava in its wake, aiming for the sparkling bay under the sunny sky. Viewed from above against a gray backdrop of olive trees, the blossoming peaches and apricots appeared enchanting. The looming volcano still emitted smoke.

Letting off steam to vent their frustrations didn't solve their problem. The blame for the trick played by a rival sorority fell on Peachy, causing her to be isolated.

"Mabel chuckled, thinking it was just an idle threat, but she was quickly proven wrong. Two interrogators firmly held her in her chair, while others rubbed soap on her face and stuck feathers on it.

For a brief moment, the girls lingered on the roof, relishing the novelty of their secret spot, knowing they shouldn't be there. Peachy mischievously hid the towels to prank Anastasia, seeking revenge for a past incident. The girls, led by Peachy, sneaked downstairs to the safer back yard, avoiding Anastasia. Peachy, in a mischievous mood, planned to explore the neighboring Villa Sutri's garden, enticed by its lush greenery. The Count was away on a cruise, making the daring plan possible. With the Villa empty, the girls could sneak in through the garden wall. Peachy's audacious plan was fueled by the allure of the exotic garden and the mystery surrounding Count Sutri's estate.

As Peachy had predicted, it was surprisingly simple. They only needed to climb a short wall, drop onto the shed's roof, then descend into Count Sutri's garden. In under five minutes, the task was done, and three amazed yet thrilled girls were hurrying along a lush pathway in search of excitement. The garden was undeniably stunning, meticulously maintained with rare flowers, water-lily ponds, fragrant pergolas, and impressive statues. Careful not to be caught, the girls explored cautiously, relishing the stolen adventure. Peachy discovered a staircase leading to a ground-level door, speculating it might lead to the sea. With the door unlocked, they ventured into a dark tunnel, following the light at the end. Emerging at a sandy cove, they found the sea, a sight they had longed for. The girls joyfully explored the beautiful cove, collecting delicate seashells.|"[""1.

Peachy was upset that the beautiful cove belonged to just one man who rarely used it. Delia, on the other hand, was thrilled that they had the beach all to themselves until they found a man smoking calmly on the other side of a rock.

Three excited girls rushed into Villa Camellia at the last minute and answered roll-call. Peachy received a scolding for her messy hair but took it calmly. Delia vowed never to take risks again after a nerve-wracking experience. Despite her resolution, she found herself back at Count Sutri's cove, this time on a proper visit with the school. The girls explored the gardens, went down to the sea, and enjoyed treats. Peachy, known for her pranks, was to face consequences for another misdeed. A maid, Anastasia, found red water from the tap and thought it was witchcraft. Peachy, suspecting a prank, led Anastasia to the roof, where she discovered a red ribbon causing the water's color.

I shook my head, finding the riddle unreadable. As it was late, I requested my candle and suggested we continue our talk in the morning. Jack, insisting the beds needed airing, offered me his room. Left alone, I examined the room, feeling the presence of many generations. As I drifted to sleep, dreams of chasing Bessie and defending her haunted me. Suddenly, a tapping sound from behind the wall woke me. A shadowy figure appeared in the moonlight, urging me to a panel with a Tudor rose. Pulling it revealed hidden treasure, saving Jack from bankruptcy. The discovery brought joy and reconciliation, making our Christmas merry.

Just two slices per kid will do. We can save some biscuits from lunch to make it look like we're eating too. Peachy, you can persuade him."" Peachy replied, ""It's always up to me. Antonio can be difficult. Sometimes he's so strict and won't even buy me candy. I'll try my best. Those kids deserve a treat, even if it's my last dollar. We owe them something nice."" Despite Miss Rodgers' recent reprimand, Antonio, usually responsible, refused Peachy's pleas due to his fear of getting caught smuggling sweets. Undeterred, Peachy decided to leverage her friendship with the cook by offering a gift and a photo in exchange for butter and sugar. The cook, touched by the gesture and the group's sacrifice, lent them the ingredients. Peachy then crafted a clever invitation for the party."|"[""1.

Peachy excitedly wrote a note on a torn sheet and handed it to Olive, asking her to pass it around. The juniors, feeling neglected, were eager to forgive past mistakes upon receiving an invitation. The Camellia Buds decided to host the juniors and made candy in front of them due to catering difficulties. They gathered at a secluded spot, the back of the summer-house, to build a campfire. However, the flames got out of control, causing the juniors to flee in fear. Some of the Camellia Buds stayed behind to put out the fire.

Rachel, a senior at the school, voiced her concerns about the lack of unity among students. She suggested that the seniors should take on the role of elder sisters to the younger students instead of just being enforcers of rules. Sybil, Erica, Phyllis, and Stella agreed with Rachel and decided to invite juniors to dormitory teas to build trust and create a more friendly environment. They also planned to involve the Transition group in school decisions. This change in approach was welcomed by Miss Morley, who allowed the juniors to enjoy cakes and tea on the veranda. The juniors appreciated the seniors' efforts and acknowledged Irene for her initial kindness towards them.

It has become a tradition to have a nationality night at the school. The American, South African, Australian, and Scotch girls form their own groups. The Scotch girls are especially close-knit and play pranks on others, sometimes leading to almost fights. Sororities are put aside during this time. Practical jokes can escalate and get rough, causing harm. The seniors are aware of these antics but turn a blind eye. Some students want to change this culture and plan to speak to Rachel, who has been more understanding lately.

We, Anglo-Saxon girls from different continents like America, England, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, share the same language and traditions. While big schools compete with others, we have always competed among ourselves. This has led to some division among us, which isn't ideal. We should be united and appreciate the diversity among us.

"Dear Lorna,

I've finally found the time to write to you after ages! Mother shared the news of your move to Naples and also gave me your school address. I truly hope you are enjoying your time there and have settled in well. I always wished you would come to Brackenfield! Did you know that Joan is here now too? It's her first term, and she is absolutely thrilled. She's showing promise in her studies and sports; she's already making waves in the New Girls' Junior Team. We recently had a successful hockey season, with a memorable victory against ""Hawthornden"" with a score of 4-2 in our favor! It was a significant win as we had never beaten them before. How is hockey at Fossato? Or is tennis the main sport? We had a delightful gymnastic display recently, with Mona and Beatrice showcasing impressive balance-walking and side vaulting. The juniors performed country dances in costume, which always receives applause from parents. Ailsa and I are working hard for an upcoming concert where we have to sing a duet; we're both nervous but hoping for the best.

I am planning to convince my mother to let me invite Eric for part of the summer holidays. In other news, Leonard is in India, Larry is at Cambridge, Peter and Cyril are doing well at St. Bede's, and Nora's baby girl is adorable.

Lorna enjoyed the voyage, watching Naples fade and Capri emerge in a pink sunset. They landed at Marina Grande and took a skiff to Signora Verdi's. Capri, with its houses and vineyards, looked ethereal in the sunset and moonlight. The next morning, they explored the island, finding solace in its beauty. Lorna urged her dad to find a way to clear his name and end their suffering.|"['1.

Lorna was tearful as she expressed her strong hatred towards the one who had wronged her, even if it was her own father. She felt conflicted about whether it was wrong to feel such intense hatred and desired to seek revenge to protect her father's honor. As she bid her father farewell on a Monday morning, she watched his boat leave the harbor under the early sun. Walking back to Casa Verdi, the town was still waking up, with only a few people bustling about. Amidst the quiet morning, she encountered Irene, who excitedly shared news of her family's spontaneous decision to rent a place in Capri for three weeks. Irene's cousin and friends were also staying nearby, and they urged Lorna to stay and chat. Despite the early hour, the unexpected reunion brought warmth to the serene island setting.|"[""1.

Lorna expected a quiet time at Casa Verdi during her father's absence but found herself surrounded by friendly invites. Mrs. Beverley welcomed Lorna to join their group of friends, including the Camerons and the Prestons, for picnics and excursions in the idyllic Capri. The group hired boats to explore the Blue Grotto, a magnificent cave with a dazzling blue hue. The boatman skillfully navigated the low entrance, leading them into the spacious cavern where everything appeared in heavenly shades of blue. The friends marveled at the surreal beauty, dipping their arms into the water to witness the silver shimmer. The Blue Grotto's enchanting charm left them in awe of nature's wonders.|"[""1.

Captain Preston and Marjorie often found ways to spend time together away from prying eyes. They would take walks to admire the moon, search for orchids, collect shells on the beach, and enjoy each other's company. The rest of their group would rotate, but it was a rule that the two of them always sat together. Lorna, on the other hand, was often accompanied by different friends like Stewart, Angus, Charlie, or Michael Foard. Vincent Beverley, who resembled Irene, often caught Lorna's attention. The group enjoyed quiet days on the island of Capri, away from the tourists. Irene loved exploring the town and shopping for unique Italian items. Vincent, not fluent in Italian, struggled while shopping but managed with gestures and help from Lorna. Once, he mistakenly bought a plaster instead of methylated spirit, which Lorna helped him resolve.|['1.

"In Rome, Lorna explained the different names for alcohol and led the way to the right shop. Mrs. Cameron organized a trip to view the ruins of Tiberius's villa. The group gathered at the town square, some taking the funicular while others preferred the train. Irene proudly showed off her new cane, which she soon broke while searching for bee-orchises. The younger ones amused themselves with tin whistles, attempting to play ""The Bluebells of Scotland."" Mrs. Cameron scolded them for their noisy performance, urging them to save it for the hills.

The adventurers reached the ruins of a grand villa once owned by Emperor Tiberius, now in a state of decay. Nature had reclaimed the crumbling walls with ferns and flowers. A small church, built with some of the old stones, stood at the highest point. From there, a stone monument overlooked a steep cliff, offering a breathtaking view of the sea. The group marveled at the sight, using field glasses to spot Greek temples in Pæstum. Mrs. Cameron shared a humorous tale from her honeymoon, recalling a rainy journey to Pæstum by train. Despite the initial discomfort, the rain cleared, revealing a stunning sky. A mosquito bite near her eye led to a comical misunderstanding with French tourists, mistaking it for a black eye.|['1.

The tale goes that you've been sharing against me for two decades. It may be a bit stretched, but feel free to continue. I can handle it. Shall I repay malice with kindness? While I strolled through town today, awaiting your arrival on the funicular, I spotted a Tarantella dance group. I invited them to perform at our house tonight since I recall your interest. Would our companions here honor us with their presence as the audience? As twilight descended, they gathered at the Camerons' villa and settled into the parlor, which had been cleared for the occasion. The Tarantella dancers, in traditional attire, entertained with lively dances accompanied by their orchestra. The evening ended with a delightful two-step danced by the guests themselves.

Let's bring our books and head to the hillside, as we did last Sunday, the girl suggested to her father. The peaceful ledge on the crag, away from everyone, was a restful spot. Mr. Carson, lying among flowers on the cliff, found temporary peace. He read and smoked, his usual worries fading. Leafing through a book borrowed from Irene, he stumbled upon a familiar name. Shocked, he confronted Lorna about her friendship with his enemy's daughter. Lorna, torn between loyalty to her father and love for Irene, struggled with the sudden revelation. Mr. Carson, fearing discovery by Mr. Beverley, decided to leave Capri for Naples. The open sea felt safer than the island, where his past haunted him.|['1.

"She was willing to satisfy his every request because in the midst of her difficulties, nothing else seemed important. Her mind was filled with a whirlwind of thoughts, a constant stream of questions and answers. Does hate have to destroy love? Forgiveness seems to be the only solution to injury. Would seeking revenge truly right the wrong or bring any resolution? No, it would only perpetuate more wrongdoing, spreading hatred and misery. The consequences of one's actions eventually catch up, and seeking vengeance may lead to its own consequences. ""Our only hope is to leave and start anew in a different country,"" she cried. ""Even if we go far away, I won't forget you, Renie, and everything you mean to me. Your memory will stay with me forever.""
