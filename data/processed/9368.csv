"Although I never saw you, since you died in 1804, I am glad you were one of those Welshmen who opposed the policy of King George III and that you, after coming to America in 1783, were among the first sea captains to carry the American flag around the world. That you knew many of the Free Quakers and other patriots of the Revolution and that they buried you among them, near Benjamin Franklin, is a matter of pride to your descendants. That you were born in Wales and spoke Welsh, as did also those three great prophets of spiritual liberty, Roger Williams, William Penn, and Thomas Jefferson, is still further ground for pride in one's ancestry. Now, in the perspective of history we see that our Washington and his compeers and Wilkes, Barre, Burke and the friends of America in Parliament were fighting the same battle of Freedom. Though our debt to Wales for many things is great, we count not least those inheritances from the world of imagination, for which the Cymric Land was famous, even before the days of either Anglo-Saxon or Norman. Now the Welsh folks in speaking of their good teacher pronounced his name Tafid and affectionately Taffy, and this came to be the usual name for a person born in Wales. In our nurseries we all learned that ""Taffy was a Welshman,"" but it was their enemies who made a bad rhyme about Taffy. Wherever there were cows"|"['1. What is the main idea of the passage?\nA.

Once upon a time, in a beautiful land, a prince was so impressed by the noble deeds of a saint named Melangell that he gifted her a sanctuary where all seeking refuge could find safety. Melangell devoted her life to this place, sleeping on bare rocks under the night sky. The land flourished with homes, farms, and children playing, as the people cultivated vines, flowers, and tamed wild animals. The Cymric folk, known as the Welsh, transformed the landscape, driving out monsters from the swamps and making the land hospitable. The once terrifying creatures were banished, and the land became a delightful place, adorned with flowers, hills covered in gorse and heather, and the laughter of pretty maidens and brave lads.

In ancient times, the Afang creature was known for its insatiable hunger, feasting on animals like birds, beasts, and fish when fat girls and careless boys were scarce. Despite its fondness for cows and sheep, the wool and hair often got stuck in its teeth, worsening its bad temper.

During the Stone Age, men crafted wooden clubs to hunt deer and defend against wolves and bears. They fashioned javelins and arrows from hard stone like flint, sharpening them for use. These cave dwellers wore animal skins as clothing and lived in communal caves with their animals. Marrying involved a young man eloping with a girl from another tribe. The cave people despised iron, considering it a symbol of treachery. Fairies, who dislike change, abhorred iron and its use in war.

When the sun rose, a tough decision weighed on Elidyr's mind: should he endure hunger or face dual punishments - one from his father and another from the monks? The gnawing sensation inside him demanded food to silence it. Finally, he made a resolute choice to brave the beatings rather than starve. As he ventured into a dark passage with two elves, they emerged into a breathtaking land where birds sang, flowers bloomed, and children played joyfully. Elidyr found himself in the palace of the Fairyland King, surrounded by tiny, bearded courtiers. In this miniature world, filled with milk and devoid of lies or profanity, Elidyr enjoyed the company of the elves but eventually yearned for home.

Long ago, in Wales, strong castles stood tall, but no Englishman was safe outside. The Welsh people fought back, forcing the Normans to armor up like lobsters. Even on horseback, they looked like turtles. If a knight fell, he had to be cut out of his metal shell. Fairies gathered to make peace, while even reptiles lived more peacefully. But the beasts of prey approved of the Normans' harsh treatment. Eventually, a Welsh king, Henry Tudor, sat on England's throne. Welsh names often reveal family ties, like Jefferson meaning sister's son. Puck, a peacemaker, sought counsel from ancient creatures. The male eagle sent him to the stag, who lived by an ancient oak. The toad, with golden eyes, directed Puck to the wise owl, the oldest of them all.|"['1.

In Fairy Land, age was not discussed, and fairies did not age or die. The lively fairies were already playing and dancing, making so much noise that fairy policemen were sent to quiet them.

The Welsh fairy Puck challenged his fellow fairies to a magical performance to showcase his skills in spells and transformations. Despite some initial reluctance, all the fairies agreed to attend the next meeting after Puck threatened to cancel the music. The fairies loved dancing to the fiddler's tunes, a tradition in Welsh gatherings. In the old days, people believed in the hazel bush's powers, using its forked branches as divining rods to find hidden treasures. Taffy, a Welsh drover visiting London, sold his Black Welsh cattle for a good price and wanted to explore the city before heading home. While shopping, a stranger took an interest in Taffy's stick, sparking curiosity and a hint of mystery.

In this land, many stones stand purposefully, not by chance, but by human hands to mark old battles or events. Among places known for such stone work, Wales rivals Korea and China. Two individuals, sweating from toiling, unearth a flat stone revealing ancient steps leading to a cave. Inside, motionless armed men lay, as if asleep, surrounded by gleaming ancient weaponry. Beyond them, a grand round table is occupied by noble warriors, heads bowed in slumber, yet ready for battle with swords and spears close at hand. At the table's end, a majestic king sits on a golden throne, holding the legendary sword Excalibur, adorned with dazzling gems. Despite their slumber, these figures exude an aura of power and history, waiting as if only a thunderous call could awaken them.|['1.

In ancient times, King Arthur's loyal knights awaited the signal to rise and reclaim Britain from its enemies. The sorcerer, tired of answering questions, revealed the knights' names and lineage to Taffy, who grew impatient. The sorcerer then led Taffy to a cave filled with gold, where they both greedily filled their pockets. When the bell rang, thousands of warriors sprang up, armed and ready to battle.

In ancient times, castle life was filled with grand feasts and entertainment. King's officer Kaim fetched drinks to keep everyone awake while they broiled meat by the fire. The evenings were filled with music, poetry, and tales of heroes. Maidens took turns holding the king's feet during these revelries that often lasted late into the night. Prince Math of Gwynedd, Wales, grew so fond of having his feet held that he neglected his duties, leaving public affairs to his nephews. One nephew, Gily, fell in love with Goewen, the king's foot holder, and sought his brother Gwyd's help to win her over.

Queen Mab, dressed like a Welsh lady, wore a tall black hat with scalloped lace fastenings. Water sprites have vanished due to modern machinery and gasoline. The pigmies from the underground world arrived with golden balls for tenpins but were warned by a fairy about pawn shops. The fairies chatted between air and earth dwellers, exchanging news and gossip. Some fairies claimed to be Co-eds from Welsh villages, not college-educated. Another group, the anti-iron society, shunned iron tools and mining. A clique of elves complained about modern times, reminiscing about druids and mistletoes.|['1.

"President Puck, a lively and short leader, often tried to stop the long-winded speakers at their fairy session before daybreak. They rambled on about soot and the lack of soap due to factory smoke. The meeting's details were a secret, known only by an old Welshman. Welsh tales often tell of battles and castles, now in ruins as people tired of conflict. Even King Arthur realized the need for change as iron became scarce. He fought a final battle, leaving a legacy of decency and kindness. The Welsh, unconquerable and welcoming, stood against invaders and helped refugees. Their strength lies in their spirit, poetry, music, and unity, upholding the motto ""Truth against the World."" King Arthur, after many feats, returned to defeat Modred, then passed his sword to Avalon before his death."|['1.
