"""I see Tododaho,"" Tayoga said. ""His face is turned towards us, and wise serpents coil in his hair. Wreaths of vapor surround his eyes, but I see them shining through, kind and wise, as the chief who left us four hundred years ago watches over us.

It was close to midnight, and the young boy had expanded the radius of his hiding spot by fifty yards. As he reached the open spaces among the trees, he settled behind a massive oak, convinced he heard a moccasin brushing a dry leaf in the distance. He stayed hidden, blending his shadow with the trunk. Soon, the voices of Tandakora and De Courcelles, along with their band, became audible. They discussed the need to hasten their pursuit of three individuals heading to warn the fort, but not to spread out until dawn. The boy's imagination painted a vivid picture of their conversation. As the group passed by, he returned to his comrades to alert them of the enemy's proximity.

The trio curved eastward, speeding through the night with Tayoga leading expertly as a forest tracker. The Onondaga excelled in his element, unfazed by danger. As they rested at Willet's suggestion, Robert's spirit soared with enthusiasm. Resting in dense bushes after a meal by a nearby brook, they enjoyed the fresh forest. The rising sun cast a brilliant light, invigorating Robert's connection to the woods. Tayoga expressed his deep love for the forest, his ancestral home. Willet reflected on the war's unintended consequence of halting deforestation, allowing nature to thrive.

Robert understood the wisdom in Willet's advice and decided to hold back from suggesting a fresh beginning. After breakfast, he relaxed on his side, admiring the vibrant blue sky peeking through the lush foliage. Despite the forest's beauty, Robert remained wary of its hidden dangers. As they resumed their journey at mid-morning, signs of warriors passing by became evident. They proceeded cautiously, spotting traces like moccasin imprints and fallen feathers. Approaching the river, they maintained silence, alert to any lurking threats. Ready to face the challenges ahead, Robert, Tayoga, and Willet shared a moment of laughter, united in their determination to outsmart their adversaries. As they cautiously neared the riverbank, the trio remained vigilant, prepared for any lurking danger on the other side.|"[""1.

Robert, Willet, and Tayoga cautiously crept through the thickets, watching the other shore intently. They spotted Indian sentinels twice but couldn't risk passing. After waiting for two hours, the night was eerily silent. Robert began to believe the enemy had left, but he knew the warriors' patience was unmatched. Learning from Tayoga and Willet's stillness and patience, Robert settled into the same immobility. Another hour passed before Tayoga led them down the stream, whispering in surprise and satisfaction. Tayoga's unwavering faith in Tododaho, the great Onondaga, inspired Robert and Willet. As clouds dimmed the moon and stars, a sense of trust and belief enveloped the trio, guiding them through the challenging night.|"['1.

The river flowed swiftly past the high banks, and Robert, standing ten feet beyond the southern shore, peered down at the dark, deep current below. The fallen tree they stood on swayed slightly under their weight, but it felt secure. Tayoga, alert among the leaves, signaled that warriors were approaching, their calls echoing through the night. Willet confirmed the danger, cautioning about Tandakora and De Courcelles closing in on them. The trio remained hidden in the thick foliage, flattened against the tree trunk like climbing animals. As the moonlight revealed the sinister figures of the warriors on the opposite shore, the tension grew. Tandakora's menacing presence was unmistakable, but their concealed position gave them a slim chance of evading the impending danger.|['1.

Tandakora and De Courcelles cautiously approached the riverbank, scanning for any signs of danger. After a tense moment, they moved on, deciding not to attempt crossing the bridge where Robert and his companions were hiding. The group of warriors split up, some staying behind while others searched the woods. Robert, Tayoga, and Willet waited anxiously, hoping the crisis had passed. Eventually, the enemies moved on, disappearing into the undergrowth. Tayoga expressed gratitude to Tododaho for guiding their foes away. With the coast clear, the trio carefully crossed to safety, quickly retreating into the safety of the forest. As they hurried away, a distant cry echoed behind them, a sign of their enemies' frustration at missing their chance to catch them.|"['1.

The hunter's silent laughter shook his frame as he observed the chagrin on Tandakora and De Courcelles' faces. Robert's imagination painted a vivid picture of the disappointment felt by the Frenchman and Ojibway as they searched for any trace of their prey. Tandakora's fury erupted when he discovered a faint footprint in the grass. The group paused briefly before resuming their flight, wary of the enemies converging on Fort Refuge. To throw off their pursuers, they waded in a creek to hide their trail, emerging miles away to rest. Willet advised Robert and Tayoga to nap while he kept watch. The trio continued their journey through the woods, undeterred by the challenges they faced, finding sustenance in the bountiful forest.|"['1.

The two lads sat together, watching their surroundings with great caution. They had recently outsmarted their enemies, Tandakora and De Courcelles, but they knew more challenges lay ahead on the path to Fort Refuge. Arriving on time was crucial, especially as the danger heightened at night, when enemies could approach silently. They discussed the recent defeat at Duquesne, acknowledging its impact on the border and the morale of their foes.

"The Onondaga and his companions took turns standing guard in the night. Robert slept first, and Tayoga, the Onondaga, promised to wake him after four hours. Robert quickly fell asleep, and when Tayoga woke him, Robert was surprised that the four hours had passed so swiftly. Tayoga then shared his knowledge about the earth's rotation and its journey around the sun, learned during his time at a school in Albany. Robert, amused by Tayoga's jest, acknowledged the importance of such knowledge.

As dawn approached, Tayoga woke Robert, but the hunter, Willet, continued to slumber deeply. Playfully, Tayoga and Robert roused Willet, comparing his long sleep to that of a hibernating bear. They joked about how they protected Willet from bears and panthers during his extended slumber.

"""You were very tired,"" Robert said, ""and we took pity on you. Moreover, the enemy is all about us, and we knew that the watch must be of the best. Tayoga felt that at such a time he could trust me alone, and I felt with equal force that I could trust him alone. We could not put our lives in the hands of a mere beginner.""

""As I repeat, you're sprightly lads,"" he said, ""and I don't mind a jest that all three of us can enjoy. Now, for breakfast, and, truth to say, we must take it cold. It will not do to light another fire.""

They ate deer meat, drank water from a brook, and then, refreshed greatly by their long rest, started at utmost speed for Fort Refuge, keeping in the deepest shadows of the wilderness, eager to carry the alarm to the garrison, and anxious to avoid any intervening foe.

The day was fortunate, no enemy appearing in their path, and they traveled many miles, hope continually rising that they would reach the fort before a cloud of besiegers could arrive."|"[""1.

"The young Onondaga led the way in silence, moving swiftly with the others close behind. The trail was clear, and it seemed the warriors and Black Rifle were unaware of being followed. Tayoga noted that both groups were moving slowly. As the last light of day faded, they stopped on a hilltop and called out with the cries of a wolf and an owl. Emerging from the woods, they stood exposed in an open area. A whistle sounded from a nearby thicket, revealing a swarthy man approaching them. Despite his calm demeanor, Robert sensed a hint of relief in the man's eyes.

The man informed them of Braddock's army's destruction near Fort Duquesne and the urgent need to reach Fort Refuge to warn and aid the garrison. The group pushed on through the night, fueled by their mission's gravity. As they neared the fort, a thin line of smoke on the horizon signaled their approach.

Robert's melodic voice echoed through the forest and open space near the fort, captivating all who heard it. Lost in his own song, Robert was startled when Willet urged him to stop. As they entered the fort, torches illuminated a scene of anticipation. Colden and his lieutenants, Wilton and Carson, greeted them warmly. Colden eagerly awaited news of victory, but Robert's silence spoke volumes. The weight of the devastating news about General Braddock's defeat fell heavily upon the fort's inhabitants. Despite the grim reality, Willet advised Colden to evacuate the fort to avoid a siege. Colden, understanding the gravity of the situation, agreed to prepare for flight. The fort's fate hung in the balance, and Robert and his companions stood ready to assist in any way they could.|"[""1.

After the initial sorrow among the displaced people had passed, the group quickly and skillfully prepared for their journey, mostly in silence. With enough able-bodied men and boys among them to form a fighting force of a hundred, Colden and his team, now familiar with the forest, sought guidance from experienced elders like Black Rifle and Willet. As they readied to depart at sunrise, setting their homes ablaze to prevent the enemy from benefiting, Colden and Robert watched Fort Refuge burn. Despite the loss, Colden remained optimistic, planning to return and rebuild. The group, consisting of men, women, and children, marched swiftly, with scouts on alert for any signs of pursuit. Willet emphasized the importance of their time, urging them to keep moving to outpace any potential threats. As they pressed forward, the forest ahead held the promise of both danger and hope.|['1.

Robert felt a surge of strength from the Onondaga's words. He deeply respected the Hodenosaunee religion, which he believed was similar to his own. Tododaho felt almost as real to him as to Tayoga. He was filled with confidence that they could repel, or at least delay, Tandakora and De Courcelles if they attacked.

They didn't talk much as the battle raged on in the dark forest. The thirty sharpshooters were active, moving from bush to bush, firing at any movement they saw. Despite being outnumbered, they held their ground. Robert believed their small group created the illusion of a larger force, deterring the enemy from rushing them. As the night passed, the wounded fighters continued to fight with renewed vigor. Under Willet's leadership, they silently retreated, leaving the illusion of a strong defense. They regrouped by a deep creek, ready to face the enemy once more. Robert and Tayoga, partners in battle, stayed vigilant, watching for any sign of the approaching warriors.

"Circumlocution is a lengthy word, Dagaeoga. It's the first time I've heard it since leaving our Albany teacher's care. I took a roundabout way to reveal it to you. Tayoga chuckled softly. He enjoyed using grand language occasionally, a habit from his time in the white man's school. ""I'll observe the birds,"" said Robert. ""They're intelligent creatures. I bet they're not mocking their friends while singing."" ""I'm not so sure, Dagaeoga,"" replied Tayoga. They noticed a bird with a red crest singing saucily. The bird suddenly stopped singing, standing alert like a watchful soldier. Robert and Tayoga, now wary, saw a warrior sneaking towards the creek.

"""They will delay far into the afternoon,"" Tayoga mentioned. ""The warriors and the Frenchmen have great patience. It would be better for the Americans and the English if they, too, like the French, learned the patience of the Indians.""

""No, Dagaeoga, we have been lying in the thickets so long now, and have been so quiet that the birds have grown used to us. They feel sure we are not going to do them any harm, and while they may have flown away when we first came they are back now, as you can see with your own eyes, and can hear with your own ears.""

Almost over Robert's head a small brown bird on a small green bough was singing, pouring out a small sweet song that was nevertheless clear and penetrating. Within the radius of his sight a half dozen more were trilling and quavering, and he knew that others were pouring out their souls farther on, as the low hum of their many voices came to his ears. Now and then he saw a flash of blue or brown or gray, as some restless feathered being shot from one bough to another. The birds, unusual in number and sure that there was no hostile presence, were having a grand concert in honor of a most noble day.

Robert listened and the appeal to his imagination and higher side was strong. Overhead the chorus of small sweet voices went on, as if there were no such things as battle or danger.

"The melody on their left faded away, while the one on their right grew louder before fading as well. Gradually, the birds began to drift off. Robert noticed their departure among the lush branches ahead. ""I'm also picking up on the signs, Tayoga,"" he remarked. ""It seems our foes are preparing to advance or have inched closer. The birds are wary of unfamiliar movements across the creek. Although not an immediate threat, the birds sense something amiss and are cautiously retreating, ready to return if needed."" Tayoga nodded in agreement, impressed by Robert's observations. Looking towards the grassy banks, they spotted four warriors cautiously approaching. A gunshot rang out, signaling a warning.

They spoke little more as they followed Tayoga at great speed on the moonlit trail, almost as clear as day. Robert admired Tayoga's Indian instincts, completely immersed in the pursuit. Tayoga noticed warmer footprints, indicating they were close behind the fleeing band. After two hours, Tayoga pointed out a spot where the band had stopped and discussed their next move. As they approached, Robert saw a group of armed men led by a tall, powerful figure - Robert Rogers. Known for his daring deeds, Rogers greeted them warmly.

"""That's enough,"" said Rogers, ""and I'm glad to meet you, Lennox.

Robert looked at Rogers' men, the picked survivors of the wilderness, lean, tough, ready for any enterprise. After dawn, they met Tayoga with thirty-five men. The train was making great speed.

Robert contained his excitement, focusing on preparing for the upcoming battle by eating venison like Tayoga. Tayoga mentioned that Tandakora's time to perish had not come yet, but the forces of Tandakora and De Courcelles would suffer in the next encounter. The Mohawks, led by Daganoweda, were ready for war, with Robert, Willet, and Tayoga by their side. The group successfully repulsed Tandakora and De Courcelles in two attacks, causing them to retreat.

Daganoweda informed the group about the urgent need for help. While they rushed to aid, Black Rifle continued his journey north and east in search of Waraiyageh and the white troops. The group learned that Waraiyageh was stationed to the north with a significant force, vigilantly watching for French and Indian threats. The train cautiously resumed its journey, and they encountered Colonial militia uniforms in the forest. A hundred well-equipped men, led by Colonel William Johnson and the fierce Mohawk warrior Joseph Brant, greeted them. Colonel Johnson expressed relief at finding the group safe and invited them to join forces to combat the French and Indian threat.

Robert watched as Rogers and Black Rifle disappeared into the wilderness. Despite his longing to join them, he remained at the Albany camp due to delays caused by disagreements among five provincial governors managing the army. The defeat of Braddock had made everyone cautious. Robert visited Mynheer Jacobus Huysman in Albany, a Dutch city bustling with soldiers, Mohawks, and business. The diverse crowd included Colonials in blue uniforms, New Englanders of British descent, Dutch people, Germans, Virginians, Marylanders, and representatives from various European nations. Robert was struck by the variety of people and foresaw the future greatness of America through this blend of races. His thoughts were interrupted by Master Benjamin Hardy, who reminded him of their shared path in commerce and advised against the allure of military glory. Hardy's wisdom resonated with Robert, leading him to promise not to join the expedition to the lakes.|"['1.

"Willet surveyed the group thoughtfully, meeting the determined gazes of Rogers and Black Rifle. He comprehended their unspoken intentions. ""Colonel Johnson,"" he began, ""we must strike fear into the French and Indians, proving victory is not theirs until earned. Let Mr. Rogers lead his rangers, along with selected companions like Robert, Tayoga, and myself. Daganoweda's Mohawks should join us to thwart Dieskau's advance.""

Colonel Johnson praised Willet's courage and suggested leaving the younger members behind. But Robert insisted on participating, eager to face the impending dangers with his comrades. The urgency to act swiftly to secure the lakes from the enemy's grasp was palpable.

The expedition was meticulously prepared, with fifty seasoned white men armed to the teeth and fifty Mohawk warriors, all led by Rogers, Willet, and Daganoweda in a united front.

Colonel William Johnson addressed the three leaders, Rogers, Willet, Black Rifle, and Daganoweda, urging caution as they ventured into the unknown forest and lakes. He acknowledged their exceptional skills but emphasized the importance of returning safely. Willet reassured Johnson of their determination to achieve success for their people with a team of fifty white and fifty red men.

The leaders commanded a group of one hundred foresters, fifty in white and fifty in red, to venture into the vast northern wilderness extending from New York to Canada. This untamed region, though breathtakingly beautiful, was teeming with ruthless Indians and daring French partisans, making it the most perilous at that time. Despite the Dutch and English settlements along the Hudson River, the vast forest remained largely unexplored. Powerful tribes and the ongoing rivalry between the French and English colonies created a dangerous and challenging landscape. As the group delved deeper into the wilderness, the dense green canopy enveloped them, masking any traces of civilization. Robert, filled with pride to be among such valiant companions, felt the allure and grandeur of the untamed wilderness. The Mohawk warriors, led by Daganoweda, embraced their primal instincts, eager for any encounter with the enemy.

The Mohawk chief, Daganoweda, wisely suggests avoiding Lake Champlain to steer clear of French forces. Rogers agrees, opting for a safer route west of Andiatarocte. As night falls, they set up camp, Black Rifle, a mysterious figure, shows signs of restlessness. Robert, intrigued by Black Rifle's behavior, observes him closely. The group prepares for an impending encounter with the French and Indians. As Robert lies awake, his mind races with thoughts of the pending war and his role in it. He awakens at midnight, surrounded by sleeping companions. Black Rifle and Daganoweda are out scouting, while the Mohawk sentinels keep watch.

Robert fell into a light sleep where he dreamed vividly, reliving moments from his past. In his dream, he revisited his early years with Willet teaching him forest skills, meeting Tayoga, and attending school. Suddenly, he jumped to a memory of encountering St. Luc and Tandakora with his mentors. As he woke, sensing movement in the forest, he saw Mohawks led by Daganoweda and Black Rifle.

Shall we finish the night here and then follow their trail to bring them to battle on our terms?"" Haace, elated by his chief's approval, slipped away on another scout, as did Black Rifle. The camp fell silent, with only the bronze sentinels visible. Robert dreamed vividly under Tarenyawagon's spell, seeing battles and fleeing through forests. He awoke refreshed and confident at dawn, ready to follow the French and Indian leaders with Willet and Daganoweda. The men, dressed for stealth, swiftly followed the trail, wary of ambush.

At a grove of oaks and elms, Willet and the chief spoke with confidence. The warriors, proud and fierce, were ready to heed the call to battle against the French and their allies. The Hodenosaunee, seeing themselves as civilized, were prepared to defend their land. As the dawn broke, the scene was serene, with silver skies and lush green foliage. Scouts were dispatched to protect the flanks, ensuring no ambush could surprise them. The group advanced steadily, the cries of birds and beasts signaling safety from the flankers.

In the pursuit of the French and Indians, the trail broadened as more paths merged with it, indicating a larger force ahead. Willet, Rogers, and Daganoweda pressed on, following the trail leading towards Andiatarocte. As they reached a hilltop at dusk, they glimpsed the lake shimmering through a cleft. Known as Andiatarocte to the Iroquois, St. Sacrement to the French, and George to the English, the lake revealed canoes and boats belonging to their enemies. The French aimed to establish dominance over the lakes, with a fortified presence at Crown Point and boats on Andiatarocte and Oneadatote. Black Rifle and Haace reported a strong enemy force commanded by St. Luc, including Frenchmen and warriors led by Tandakora.

Robert's mind conjured vivid images, each swiftly replacing the last like changing lights, painted in vibrant hues. The vast lake nestled amidst the mountains, shimmering under the moon, sparked his imagination. It became the focal point of the fierce battles destined to unfold in North America. A belief grew into a conviction that whoever controlled Andiatarocte and Oneadatote would dominate the continent. The dense woods, akin to the lake, exuded mystery and contemplation. The silence was eerie, devoid of bird songs, as even the animals sensed impending conflict and fled. Robert discerned a faint light on a gentle slope leading to the lake, revealing St. Luc's camp nearby. As the group advanced, the forest lit up with fireflies, signaling the proximity of the enemy.

"""You're correct, Tayoga, I trust it too. There's every reason not to, but truthfully, I do. Our beautiful day is fading quickly. Look at how the twilight is creeping over the mountains.

In the narrow passage, Robert spotted the massive timber wolf, the leader of the phantom pack, lurking among the bushes. He refrained from shooting immediately, as Tayoga warned of the wicked warrior's soul possibly residing in the wolves. These creatures moved silently, embodying evil spirits with their cunning ways. Robert's steady hand and bright eyes belied the eerie surroundings as he took aim, first felling the wolf on the right with a precise shot to the throat.

"""Well done, Dagaeoga,"" whispered Tayoga. ""Two shots and two wolves slain. The skirmisher on the right and the skirmisher on the left both are gone. There will be a wait now while the living devour their dead comrades. Listen, you can hear them dragging the bodies into the bushes.""

""No, it is a great pack, and they are very hungry. In ten or fifteen minutes they will be stalking us again. You must seek a shot at the giant leader, but it will be hard for you to get it because he will keep himself under cover, while he sends forth his warriors to meet your arrows.

Yes, it must be a brother, the blood of Tandakora.""

""Then Tandakora's brother would better beware. My desire to slay him has increased, and if he's incautious and I get good aim I think I can place an arrow so deep in him that the Ojibway's wicked soul will have to seek another home.""

Robert aimed his bow at the wolf's throat, his nerves steady and his eyes piercing the darkness. With the bow of Ulysses, he shot an arrow straight and swift, piercing the wolf deeply.

The rangers and Mohawks had been weakened in the recent battle with St. Luc, but they remained a strong force due to their expertise, bravery, and leadership. Eager to advance towards Crown Point, they carefully planned their approach. Choosing a route to the west and traveling mostly at night to avoid detection, they rested in a glen before their journey. Robert, needing rest, calmed his mind and body, preparing for the challenges ahead. As dusk fell, the group silently moved north and east towards their destination.

"""It's wiser to proceed cautiously,"" advised Willet. ""I recall our hasty advance with Braddock, resulting in the loss of a capable army. The French now hold the upper hand, and we must adapt to their maneuvers,"" he continued.

Rogers then alerted the group about a fleet of Indian canoes sighted near Crown Point. The sharp air allowed them to see far, spotting the canoes as small dots on the lake. Concern arose about the unusual concentration of canoes, hinting at a significant event. Tayoga speculated that Dieskau might be preparing to march, seeking to outshine previous French victories.

Robert, anxious about potential attacks, found reassurance in the group's unity. Willet proposed a strategic approach, sending Daganoweda to scout near the fort. The Mohawk chieftain eagerly embarked on the task, ensuring a thorough and accurate report.

"""Dieskau and his army have set their sights on attacking Waraiyageh,"" he explained. ""We ventured close to the walls and overheard discussions.

""It falls upon us to reach Waraiyageh before them,"" Willet remarked calmly. ""There is a pressing need for our swift action. If Johnson's army is defeated, Albany will be at risk, the Hodenosaunee might turn against us under duress, and New York could face devastation by fire and scalping.""

Daganoweda's information was accurate. Dieskau had arrived at Crown Point with a formidable force, ready for immediate advancement. He instructed his troops to travel lightly, carrying only essential items. The orders given to the Indians were brutal, emphasizing speed over scalping in battle, but allowing them free reign once the enemy was routed.
