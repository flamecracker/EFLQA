A group of cheerful girls strolled through the streets of Compton, a rare sight for the quiet town. They attracted the attention of curious villagers who followed them to the post-office. The girls, oblivious to the stares, chatted and laughed while waiting for their mail. Suddenly, Jane noticed a man with large goggles peering at them through the window. Startled, she pointed him out, but he vanished quickly. Miss Elting, sensing something amiss, questioned the postmaster, Mr. Grubb, about the mysterious man. He professed ignorance, and the girls, undeterred, expressed their eagerness to explore the White Mountains. Janus Grubb assured them of a grand adventure, promising to show them the best trails and peaks in the area.|['1.

Janus instructed the group to plan their journey and have some luggage sent ahead to meet them in a week. The girls were used to carrying heavy packs and would bring their necessary gear. Janus mentioned the mountain they would climb, standing at three thousand five hundred feet, assuring it would be challenging enough. When asked about the starting time, Janus replied that the equipment could be sent ahead to a convenient location. Suddenly, they spotted a mysterious man with goggles near a store. The man disappeared, leaving everyone stunned. Harriet, quick to react, dashed towards the back of the store upon hearing someone climbing over a fence.

After finishing supper, Janus Grubb was troubled and mystified by the evening's events. He couldn't figure out who the man with green goggles could be, suspecting it was a prank by someone he knew. Meanwhile, Miss Elting and her group took the incident more seriously, proceeding with caution. Harriet Burrell and her friends, well-known from previous adventures, were preparing for a new journey. They packed their camping gear and essentials, ready for a long vacation in the hills. The guardian suspected the stranger in the hotel parlor to be their guide, knowledgeable about the White Mountains.

After a tense conversation with Mr. Collins, the guardian expressed satisfaction with their mountain guide, Mr. Grubb. Despite Mr. Collins' warnings about the dangers of the hills, the guardian remained firm in their decision.

"Wrong, this time. There isn't the slightest resemblance that I could observe. I thought of that, too. But let's not bother our heads about it any further. We have things of greater importance to consider this evening, and, besides, we must go to bed soon; we are to make an early start in the morning, you know."" Harriet shook her brown head slowly. She was positive that she was right in her identification of the visitor, Collins. She determined to ask some questions at the first opportunity. This she did on the following morning, inquiring of the hotel clerk about the man who had so strangely called on Miss Elting. The clerk said he had never heard of the man. In the preparations that followed Harriet forgot about the caller. Grubb had a carry-all at the hotel before they had finished their breakfast. The equipment for the party occupied little room. Janus had consulted with Miss Elting about the food supplies, and these were packed in the smallest possible space, with the exception of a few packages for their use before they got into the mountains. The drive to the point where they would leave the wagon would occupy the greater part of the day. The girls looked forward to that day's journey with keen anticipation.

The guide explained that the mountains are known as 'The Roof of New England,' with little timber on top but spruce, yellow pine, and hemlock on the sides. The granite under the subsoil supports moss, where many important New England streams originate. The girls saw the White Mountains for the first time, marveling at Chocorua's towering presence. As darkness fell, the driver decided to stop at the foot of the mountain, with plans to continue the journey to the Shelter the next day. Janus and Miss Elting agreed the girls could walk to the Shelter, starting their climb from the mountain's base.

A lantern flickered dimly from the rear axle of the carry-all, casting eerie shadows ahead but failing to light the road for the Meadow-Brook Girls. Crazy Jane marveled at the ride, likening it to a thrilling adventure in her own car. Suddenly, a crash echoed as the right rear wheel collided with the covered bridge, narrowly missing a disastrous collision with a post. The horses panicked, causing chaos as the carry-all careened through the bridge, with the girls clinging on in fear. Amidst the chaos, the vehicle struck the side again, leading to a moment of panic as the horses abruptly stopped, causing a commotion that ended with the girls tumbling over the dashboard. The dark bridge echoed with the sounds of chaos before falling silent, save for the nervous whinny of a horse.|"[""1.

"""Harriet!"" There was no answer. Miss Elting, the teacher, felt a wave of alarm. She was still in the broken carry-all, holding on tightly to avoid being thrown out like the others. Suddenly, a groan ahead caught her attention. She searched for the lantern in the darkness and managed to relight it. Running to the front, she saw a strange sight. The horses had fallen through the bridge's floor, with the driver and Janus Grubb sprawled nearby. Margery and Hazel were huddled together, and Tommy was beside Janus. Jane was trying to revive the guide. Miss Elting believed Harriet had made it to the riverbank. Everyone was working together to help the injured and unconscious."|"[""1.

"Jane lost some skin from her nose, but she can grow some more, and it will soon be better again. Tommy's reply drew a smile from her friends, but they were too disturbed to feel like laughing. They were also concerned about the suffering horses. ""If we place planks under the horses, we might lift them up a bit, then slide more planks under them one by one,"" suggested Janus, stroking his whiskers thoughtfully. Janus always consulted his whiskers when unsure, finding answers among the graying hairs. The group worked together to lift the horses onto the planks, providing them some relief. As they paused to rest, a faint reddish glow appeared at the end of the bridge, sparking curiosity and wonder among the Meadow-Brook Girls and their companions."|"['1.

"With a sudden urge, the girls and their guardian rushed to the opposite side of the bridge, a mere twenty feet away. Margery let out a terrified scream, prompting Jane to shake her vigorously. ""Keep going, girls!"" shouted Harriet. ""I'll head back to save our supplies and horses."" Ignoring the warnings, the girls hurried back to where Janus and the driver struggled to lift the horses. Miss Elting and Harriet urged them to hurry. ""Forget the packs,"" Harriet insisted. ""Let's focus on saving the animals. We must keep trying."" Suddenly, Crazy Jane ran to the wagon and returned with a hand-saw. As the girls watched nervously, the sawing began. They glanced back at the smoke billowing from the bridge's far end. Tommy's coughing reminded them of the urgency. ""Be careful not to leave the animals hanging,"" Harriet cautioned. A plank flew up, narrowly missing them, and one horse fell into the river. Harriet peered into the water. ""We need to rescue the other horse quickly,"" Janus urged, as flames neared."|"[""1.

"""I'm afraid we won't have time. The fire is almost too close for comfort,"" Harriet said. She hurried to the carry-all to grab a blanket left on the front seat. Remembering the cushions, she took those too. After a final check, she dashed to safety just as the burning bridge collapsed with a loud crash. Miss Elting, Jane, and the men on shore shouted warnings, but Harriet couldn't hear. The bridge fell into the river, sparks flying. Miss Elting and Jane anxiously scanned the water, fearing the worst. Despite the men searching for Harriet in the river, hope seemed lost. Jane tried to reassure them, believing Harriet was safe.

Miss Elting sat down, and Jane looked out over the river. Jim, the guide, whistled for the missing horses and led them to safety. Suddenly, they heard whinnies, and the girls rushed into the river, rescuing Harriet. She explained how she narrowly escaped the collapsing bridge, swimming to safety with a charred plank.

I was lost, drifting downstream, unsure of my location. I kicked until the plank turned, guiding me towards the shore. Once my feet touched the bottom, I trudged upstream, hoping to find my friends soon. Suddenly, a voice called out. Was it Jane? Worried about our exhaustion, Jane suggested we set up camp nearby for a rest. We needed warm food and a change of clothes. Jim searched for our lost packs near the river and found them in a cove. The girls helped gather the scattered items. Laughter filled the air as we worked together to secure the belongings. Crazy Jane joked that things were always moving when the Meadow-Brook Girls were around. Despite the challenges, we managed to organize the packs and prepare for the journey ahead.|['1.

The heavy packs were loaded onto the horses, and Janus led the way to the chosen campsite. It took nearly half an hour to navigate the dark night filled with obstacles like rocks and fallen trees. Finally, the guide announced their arrival, bringing relief to the tired group. Janus, taking charge, started a fire with dry leaves and began drying the wet bedding and clothes. The smell of bacon cooking filled the air, and soon everyone sat down for supper, tired but content.

"""The horses broke free from their halters,"" Janus explained as Tommy approached her friends. ""I can't figure out what scared them. Jim must be chasing them, or he would have returned by now. Do you want to give up?""

""It could have been a bird or something. Horses startle easily when they're asleep. I've seen a partridge fly up near a sleeping horse, causing it to break loose and create a mess. If we find out, it was probably something like that which scared Jim's horses.""

The tent was discovered torn badly, with the horses' hooves leaving large tears. After inspecting the canvas, they decided not to repair it that night, waiting until morning for better light.

"""No, sir. We were under the tent. We saw nothing,"" replied Harriet. ""I believe the noise of the horses woke us up. Suddenly, we were trampled on, and the tent collapsed.

"Jane nodded and replied, ""Yes, something."" She then quickly headed towards the camp, followed by her companions. Janus Grubb walked behind, his hand buried in his bushy beard.

"Harriet nodded thoughtfully as she held the goggles Jane handed her. ""These are the same ones,"" she declared. ""You've made a discovery, Miss Elting. We're starting to piece things together.""

Later that evening, Miss Elting recounted seeing the man with the green goggles at the post-office porch. Jim chimed in, having spotted the man at the station. They suspected he had fled up the mountain.

"""Yes, the challenge starts in the morning,"" agreed Janus. ""But I believe the young ladies can handle it. They are quite experienced, but they will likely feel very tired by tomorrow night."" Shortly after, the girls fell into a deep sleep and woke up an hour after sunrise. As they exited their torn tent, the inviting smells of breakfast greeted them, already prepared by the guide. Following breakfast, they began the strenuous ascent up the mountain, which the Meadow-Brook Girls approached with enthusiasm. They felt it was rewarding because they were achieving something. Packs were quickly readied after breakfast. Carrying their heavy loads, the group embarked on a decent pack trail, a shortcut to the Shelter halfway up Mount Chocorua. By mid-morning, they reached the Shelter. The girls dropped their packs, breathing heavily with flushed faces and eager eyes. Even Margery seemed more engaged, despite her complaint about the tender bump on her head from the tent pole the previous night.""No time to waste.

Behind the Shelter, there's a simple trail to the top, but climbing is the challenge. Janus, the guide, ensured the girls' safety and led them down a steep incline instead of up. The descent was tough with rocks, thorns, and slippery shale. Despite a scare, they continued. As they ascended a narrow crevasse, the real climb began. Janus urged them to reach Sokoki Leap before dark. A sudden rain shower made the rocks slippery, slowing their progress.

At the end of their challenging climb, the group faced another obstacle. They had to maneuver around a corner one by one, holding on tightly as each person made their way. Janus signaled for them to begin, and they slowly progressed, ensuring each member's safety. The guide decided some might need assistance to reach the shelf above. The girls observed the steep granite slab they had to ascend. Miss Elting led the way, climbing with ease, while Margery struggled and slipped, injuring her nose.

Janus, with Tommy's encouragement, leaned forward eagerly, grinning widely as he pulled on the line with determination. His forehead glistened with sweat as he exerted all his strength. Suddenly, Tommy swung her free foot up the slope, catching a little ledge. The abrupt stop jolted her slender frame, but she remained unfazed. As Harriet had predicted, Janus lost his balance and tumbled headfirst down the incline, caught off guard. Harriet swiftly sprang forward to prevent Tommy from being hurt, bracing herself as she caught the girl by the shoulders, halting the slide. In the chaos, Crazy Jane's exuberant shout turned to concern as Janus collided with her, sending him tumbling down to a flat rock below. After a brief moment, Janus regained his composure, realizing what had happened. With Tommy's assistance, the group safely regrouped on a level slab of granite, preparing for a meal by the fire.

Long ago, the Sokokis, a powerful Indian tribe, roamed these hills. Chocorua, their chief, faced a vengeful white man seeking revenge for his slain family. The chief, aware of the avenger, fled but was eventually cornered. With hatred in his eyes, Chocorua cursed the white man and leaped from a cliff, meeting his fate in the lake below. The settlers later grazed their animals near the lake, leading to their demise. The Indians believed it was the Great Spirit's revenge, naming it the 'Lake of the Poisoned Waters.'

Years later, scientists explained the mystery of the poisoned water in the lake, attributing it to lime in the rocks. However, the local Indian community remained skeptical. As night fell, Janus, the guide, secured the girls' ropes to his belt. The girls, including Margery and Tommy, prepared for sleep in the Indian fashion, rolling themselves in blankets. Tommy, mischievous, planned to slip her rope off later. As the night progressed, Tommy awoke suddenly, feeling nervous. An owl's hoot echoed, followed by a terrifying scream that jolted everyone awake. Amidst the chaos, Harriet was the first to free herself from her blanket, demanding to know what was happening.|"['1.

A strange sight caught Harriet's eye. Janus was sliding mysteriously on the shelf, while the party members struggled, entangled in blankets, near the edge. Harriet, quick and alert, sprang towards Janus and grabbed a taut rope. She then rushed to the edge where she saw a spider-like object hanging from a thread. It was Tommy Thompson in distress. Miss Elting tried to calm Tommy, but Harriet took charge. She instructed Tommy to stop struggling and hang limp to avoid danger. Harriet fetched a stick to help Tommy.

Jane chuckled, hinting that there might be more challenges ahead for the day. Tommy hesitated, not thrilled about the upcoming climb. Despite her reluctance, she prepared her pack resignedly. The other girls followed suit, with Janus ensuring the packs were secure. Climbing a steep mountain with a poorly packed bag could result in losing everything.

Janus rose and stepped outside to survey the surroundings. He pondered while gazing at the rocky terrain above and the faint trail snaking around the mountain's side.

"Harriet understood the situation without words. Suddenly, a heavy weight landed on her arms, almost causing her to lose balance. Her face turned red with effort.

Harriet helped Tommy gather stones for the stove, stacking them for the fire the guide would light later. With darkness setting in, Hazel found the lantern broken. Despite this, they managed to start a cook-fire. After supper, the girls, exhausted from the day's adventure, settled into their blankets for the night. Wrapped like mummies, they felt warm and cozy. Despite insects buzzing around, the girls slept soundly, oblivious to the critters and playful squirrels. The next morning, Tommy woke early, eager to explore the Slide.

Tommy groaned as the pond rose to meet her. She skimmed along the surface before beginning to settle. Opening her mouth for air, she got a mouthful of water, kicking and struggling as she went under.

Harriet's keen senses detected an approaching sound, and she remained still, wary of the intruder.

Janus quickly reloaded his revolver after ejecting the spent shells and returned to the campfire, wiping sweat from his brow.

The Meadow-Brook Girls' camp was in turmoil, but Harriet's quick thinking gave them a sense of security by capturing the intruder's rifle. With no belief that the man had another weapon, the danger of more shootings that night was minimal. Following the guide's advice and their guardian's instructions, the girls wrapped themselves in blankets and dozed off. Suddenly, a commotion erupted past midnight, startling them awake. The guide's shout was followed by rapid gunfire and a warning from Janus Grubb. Harriet saw Janus chasing after the intruder, firing his revolver. Despite the girls' attempts to call out, there was no response. An uneasy feeling settled over the camp as they waited for Janus to return, unsure of the unfolding events. Their guardian advised them to stay put, fearing any interference might disrupt Janus's plan. The night passed with anxious pacing and unanswered calls, leaving everyone on edge.|"[""1.

"Harriet Burrell took the lead, following the trail where Janus had vanished. Despite the bush's trampling, she spotted broken bushes, guiding her like a seasoned woodsman. Harriet signaled, ""I've found the trail, veering east."" The pursued aimed to quicken their escape by changing direction. As they climbed, the trail grew faint, leading to almost barren rocks. Harriet stayed behind to search, while the rest descended obliquely. Despite their efforts, the trail vanished. At lunch, they expanded their search, but the mystery lingered as night fell. The girls, uneasy, set up camp, with Harriet and Jane taking turns on guard duty. A bright fire was lit to signal Janus, hoping for a rescue. Harriet found solace in nature during her watch, awaiting any signs of their lost guide."|['1.
