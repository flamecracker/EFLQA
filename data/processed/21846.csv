"The reviewers of ""Crowded Out o' Crofield"" have found the boy and girl actors' careers realistic. The story accurately portrays historical places and people. The tale was inspired by a conversation with an American boy who faced unexpected opportunities beyond his village. In the blacksmith-shop, a sandy-haired boy, about fifteen, tall for his age, observes his father at work. The boy, with freckles and charcoal marks, shows confidence in his blue-gray eyes. His father, a grimy blacksmith, mentions tough times in Crofield. The father finishes making seven shoes and tells the boy he can go fishing after dinner.

"Maybe she had made a smart choice by hiding behind the nearby tree. It was a small maple tree, just two inches thick, recently planted, but it might have been able to halt a pair of very tiny horses. The ones on the road were big—almost too big to run easily. They were well-matched gray horses, galloping thunderously, a sight to behold; heads down, necks curved, nostrils flared, reins flapping, the wagon behind them rattling and swerving—no wonder everyone froze, except for Mary Ogden, who yelled, ""Stop them!"" Across the street, a young man stood still until the runaway horses were almost upon him. Then he dashed out into the street, not ahead of them but behind. No one could have stopped those horses by standing in front of them. They could have plowed through anything. Their hefty, furious gallop was rapid, and the boy now chasing them must have been as nimble as a young deer. ""Oh, it's that useless brother of Mary Ogden. He's the blacksmith's assistant. I fear he might get hurt,"" remarked Miss Glidden, kindly and compassionately; but everyone else cheered, ""Hooray!"" The pressure on the young runner was intense for a moment, until his hands gripped the back of the bouncing wagon. A pull, a leap, a swerve of the wagon, and Jack Ogden was inside it, and in another moment"|"['1.

"""We'll prepare you right away,"" Aunt Melinda assured. ""You can hand Jack your travel bag - he won't mind the lost key. I'll lend you my trunk to pack everything you need for a great time."" Jack was thrilled, feeling it was the first step towards his journey. His love for Crofield and his family had never been stronger than at that moment. His father, the blacksmith, expressed concerns about the family's financial situation but emphasized the importance of knowing right from wrong. After an emotional farewell, Jack headed to the stables to get his team ready. With the carriage packed, they set off to Miss Glidden's house in style.

On the journey, the road appeared safe, but to the right, the land seemed flooded. The carriage continued, the horses occasionally showing signs of fear, while the passengers, especially the older ones, displayed even more anxiety. Crossing an old, shaky bridge, the horses pranced nervously. Jack, the driver, skillfully guided them down the slope. Upon arrival, Mrs. Edwards, a tall lady with gray hair, welcomed Mary warmly. Jack planned to tend to the horses and visit the newspaper office. However, upon learning that the editor was unwell, plans changed. The stable-keeper appreciated Jack's bravery in crossing the bridge and compensated him three dollars, which Jack realized would help him on his journey to the city, even though he would arrive with no money.|"['1.

Jack and Mary were surprised by the responsibilities that came with running the newspaper. Mr. Bones, who worked in the office, thought Mary had grown taller and her eyes darker. They realized they needed to make their paper, the _Eagle_, more interesting than the rival _Inquirer_. Jack planned to gather news from around town.

Jack had a great start as he learned about the rising water in Mertonville's creek, the logs saved, and the flood prevention talks. He then gathered more details from the stable-men. With a wealth of information, he had to jot down notes in the reading-room. As he walked through the old village near the canal, he heard a sudden shriek. Startled, Jack was silenced by a group accusing him of wrongdoing. Despite feeling trapped, Jack stayed calm. The villagers debated locking him up, but Jack remained determined. He found himself tied to a chair, plotting his escape. With courage, he made a daring move, reaching for a branch from a precarious position on the roof. Meanwhile, Mary and Jack worked tirelessly, ensuring the newspaper's timely publication.

On Thursday, Mary and Jack were surprised by the unexpected impact of the _Eagle_ newspaper they had worked on. Jack efficiently printed and distributed the papers, but the content stirred up a frenzy in the town. Excited readers clamored for copies, causing chaos at the front office. However, the positive reception of their articles quickly turned sour. Angry subscribers canceled their subscriptions, and even a mob formed demanding to see the editor. Meanwhile, at a social event, discussions about the newspaper's strong denunciations and political implications caused a stir. Back at home, Mary and Mrs. Murdoch remained unaware of the commotion, with Mrs. Murdoch focusing on the upcoming Union Church Sociable.

Mr. Murdoch, the editor, received a visit from a group of men with sticks, demanding something back. However, one man, Mike Flaherty, stopped the situation from escalating by taking the lead and diffusing the tension. Mary Ogden, who had been working on the next issue, was surprised by the commotion. Mr. Murdoch, though unwell, took charge of the situation and had a discussion with Mary. Later, Jack, another worker, was sent on an errand to the other side of the village. Mr. Murdoch, feeling overwhelmed, decided that Jack should leave town for New York to avoid any trouble.

As they chatted in the supper-room, Jack observed the diverse crowd at the Columbia hotel, representing various nations and cultures.

"The moonlight illuminated the shores, revealing the villages and towns twinkling in the distance. Jack, feeling relieved when the three ladies bid goodnight, listened to the German's tales of rivers and battles. The German shared stories of the Hudson River, full of historical battles, and compared it to the Mississippi and the Potomac. He described the Danube as a river with even more conflicts. As the Columbia steamed through the moonlit night, the German humorously named world leaders as mere ""chiefs of police."" Despite his gruff tone, he lightened up, promising to show Jack some ""little kings"" in Washington.

After a long silence, the German traveler aboard the Columbia dozed off in his armchair. Jack noticed the overcrowded boat filled with tourists without proper accommodations. The sight of the bustling steamboat amazed Jack, who explored the vessel and admired the view from the stern. The noise of passing trains along the riverbank added to the excitement.

"Afterwards, Jack had a hazy memory of walking across a broad gang-plank leading to a noisy place. Miss Hildebrand gripped his left arm while the other two ladies followed Mr. Guilderaufenberg. They emerged onto a street with men on either side waving whips, shouting, and pointing at a line of carriages. Miss Hildebrand mentioned to Jack that they could reach their hotel faster by taking the elevated railway. ""This is Broadway. There's no other street in the world as long. Look this way and then look that way! So! Right? That's Broadway. There's no other city in the world where a big street stays busy on a Sunday!"" Jack nodded, taking in the bustling scene.

"""This is pretty much American,"" said Mr. Guilderaufenberg as Jack gazed out at the third-story windows of the buildings. ""You never were here before? So! Then you never feel just like now. You are very much a boy. I tell you, there are not such railways in Europe; I once felt like you now. That was when I first came here. It was not Sunday; it was a day for the flags. I tell you what it is: when that American feels good, he hangs out his flag. Stars and stripes--I like that flag!

Jack attended the church service, where he tried to focus despite his wandering eyes. He felt small in the grand church but enjoyed the sermon and music.
