"""Lead the way, Bluff. Then we'll have some light on the topic,"" said the leader, glancing around warily, still suspicious that their walk to the old barn might have been noticed by the hostile Slavin group. Ted Slavin was the known bully of Stanhope, a tough fighter who commanded fear more than respect. His closest companion, Ward Kenwood, son of a prominent banker, had joined forces with Ted due to a debt owed. Ward's rivalry with Paul led him to side with Ted, relishing in thwarting Paul's plans. Paul, eager to avoid the Slavin group, had a grand idea in mind. As they settled in, Paul proposed starting a Boy Scouts troop in Stanhope. The idea was met with enthusiasm, except for Bobolink, who hesitated due to a family tragedy involving his brother."|"['Question 1: Who is the known bully of Stanhope?\nA) Bluff\nB) Ward Kenwood\nC) Paul\nD) Ted Slavin\nE) Bobolink', ""Question 2: Why did Ward Kenwood join forces with Ted Slavin?\nA) Because they were childhood friends\nB) Due to a debt owed\nC) To start a Boy Scouts troop\nD) To avoid the Slavin group\nE) To thwart Paul's plans"", 'Question 3: What idea did Paul propose to avoid the Slavin group?\nA) Starting a bakery\nB) Starting a Boy Scouts troop\nC) Going on a vacation\nD) Playing a prank on Ted\nE) Ignoring the situation', 'Question 4: How did Ward Kenwood feel towards Paul?\nA) Envious\nB) Grateful\nC) Indifferent\nD) Supportive\nE) Hostile', ""Question 5: Why did Bobolink hesitate to join the Boy Scouts troop?\nA) He was scared of the dark\nB) He had a family tragedy involving his brother\nC) He was friends with Ted Slavin\nD) He didn't like Paul\nE) He was too busy with schoolwork"", ""Question 6: How was Paul's idea of starting a Boy Scouts troop received?\nA) With anger\nB) With hesitation\nC) With enthusiasm\nD) With confusion\nE) With disinterest""]"|['D) Ted Slavin', 'B) Due to a debt owed', 'B) Starting a Boy Scouts troop', 'E) Hostile', 'B) He had a family tragedy involving his brother', 'C) With enthusiasm']
The Boy Scout movement originated in England, where it has ties to the military, as young men there often anticipate serving in the armed forces. However, in America, the focus is on promoting peace. To become a tenderfoot scout, one must understand scout law, signs, salutes, and the national flag. Advancing to second-class and first-class scouts involves mastering skills like knot tying and earning merit badges in various activities. The idea of forming a troop excites the group, with Paul being nominated as scout master due to his knowledge of the outdoors. Patrols within a troop are named after animals like fox or wildcat, and each member should be able to mimic the animal's call. The commitment to the Scout law emphasizes bravery and helping others, rather than resorting to violence. Paul's enthusiasm to start a troop in Stanhope grows as he learns more about the movement from neighboring towns.|['1. What is the main focus of the Boy Scout movement in America?\nA.

The Boy Scouts rushed towards the town's fire department building with loud cries. They had an old engine and a hose reel drawn by men.

First is the fire test. Twelve participants are ready to compete. They all start chopping wood with their hatchets to warm up. The wood pile grows as the sound of chopping fills the air.

Paul was curious about the secret mission the agent was on for the government. The agent explained that caution was crucial to gather evidence against suspects without alerting them.
