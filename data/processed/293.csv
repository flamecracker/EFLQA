The two boys shook hands and went their separate ways. Each looked back until the other was out of sight. Paul felt a sense of sadness and loneliness creeping in after his companion left. He occasionally glanced back to ensure Mr. Mudge wasn't following him. Paul walked for another hour, meeting few people on the road.

The widow was taken aback by Daniel's confidence but needed a new broom. When he offered a bundle for sale, she purchased one without a word. She allowed him to visit again politely.

Paul wandered through the streets and stumbled upon a dimly lit building, not as grand as the theater but adorned with a towering steeple that hinted at its identity as a church. Few people trickled in, and Paul followed suit. The church's opulence dazzled him, a stark contrast to the humble meeting-house he knew. Mesmerized by the grandeur, he settled in a back pew.

Paul drifted into a deep slumber, oblivious to the hymns and the closing of the church. He awoke the next morning, bewildered by his surroundings, realizing he was locked inside.

Our young hero had a strong resolve and a lot of energy. Once he set his mind on something, he worked persistently until he achieved it. This determination is a key to success. While some people might have sudden success with one big effort, it's rare. Paul, despite facing challenges like not having much schooling, aimed to make the most of his current opportunities. He was determined to prove his capabilities to a boy who doubted him. Paul balanced his studies with play, enjoying both. Most of his friends liked him, except for George Dawkins, who harbored a dislike for Paul. George, feeling confident in his abilities, didn't study much, assuming he couldn't be surpassed by Paul. Meanwhile, Mrs. Mudge, a busy and energetic woman, was upset about her cabbages being destroyed by a cow due to a gap in the fence.
