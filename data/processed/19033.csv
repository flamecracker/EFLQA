Alice grew weary of sitting idly by her sister at the riverbank, longing for something to occupy her time. As she pondered the joy of crafting a daisy chain versus the effort of gathering the flowers, a peculiar White Rabbit dashed by. Startled by the Rabbit's odd behavior, Alice followed it down a rabbit hole, embarking on a whimsical adventure. The hole led her to a mysterious tunnel lined with cupboards and bookshelves. Despite a gentle fall, Alice landed safely in a hall illuminated by hanging lamps, surrounded by locked doors. Perplexed but determined, she began her quest to find a way out of the enigmatic place.|"['1.

"Alice discovered a small glass table with a golden key on it. She tried the key on the doors but failed. Later, she found a low curtain hiding a tiny door that the key unlocked. Behind it was a passage leading to a beautiful garden. Alice wished she could shrink to explore it but found a bottle labeled ""DRINK ME."" After checking for poison, she sipped it, enjoying its unique flavors. It neither shrank nor grew her. Then, she found a cake labeled ""EAT ME"" in a glass box. Hoping it would help her reach the key, she ate it but remained the same size. Surprised, she finished the cake and began to grow like a telescope. Despite her changing size, Alice was determined to enter the garden."|"['1.

Alice found herself in a peculiar situation as she suddenly grew to over nine feet tall. Startled by her size, she grabbed a golden key and rushed to the garden door. While waiting, she saw the White Rabbit approaching in a rush, worried about keeping the Duchess waiting. As Alice tried to speak to the Rabbit, he fled in a panic. Curiously, Alice noticed she had put on one of the Rabbit's gloves. Confused by her changing size, she dropped a fan that was causing her to shrink. Relieved to still exist, she decided to return to the garden but found the door locked and the key out of reach. In her distress, she slipped and fell into a pool of her own tears, realizing she had shrunk back to a tiny size.|['1.

"Alice pondered whether speaking to the mouse would be helpful in finding her way out of the pool. She started by asking the mouse if it knew the way out, expressing her weariness of swimming. The mouse, looking puzzled, made no response. Alice then speculated that maybe the mouse didn't understand English and attempted to speak French, asking, ""OÃ¹ est ma chatte?"" The mouse reacted with a sudden leap and appeared frightened. Apologizing for mentioning cats, Alice tried to reassure the mouse by describing her cat, Dinah.

"Alice called out gently, ""Mouse dear, please come back, we won't talk about cats or dogs if you don't like them."" The Mouse, looking pale, swam back to her. It expressed its dislike for cats and dogs and agreed to share its story on the shore. As the pool filled with curious creatures like a Duck, Dodo, Lory, and Eaglet, Alice led them to dry land. The Mouse, a figure of authority, declared they would soon be dry. They all gathered in a ring, and the Mouse began a historical tale about William the Conqueror. The Dodo suggested a race to dry off, leading to a chaotic but fun running game. After the race, they shared treats, causing a bit of a commotion, and then settled down to hear more from the Mouse."|['1.

Alice observed the Mouse's lengthy tail with amazement and questioned why it was considered sad. While the Mouse narrated a tale, Alice's mind wandered, envisioning a scenario where Fury challenged a mouse to a trial. The Mouse, in response, expressed the futility of such a trial without a jury or judge. Alice's longing for her cat, Dinah, stirred unease among the creatures present, causing them to disperse. Feeling desolate, Alice shed tears until the White Rabbit reappeared, distressed about misplacing items. Alice, in a bid to help, searched for the lost fan and gloves. In her exploration, she stumbled upon a room where she discovered a bottle. Curious, she sipped from it, hoping to grow larger but soon found herself almost hitting the ceiling. Realizing the bottle's potency, she halted, content with her current size.|"[""1.

Alice found herself growing rapidly, unable to stop. She knelt on the floor, then extended an arm out the window and a foot up the chimney. She wondered what would happen to her. Suddenly, a voice called for Mary Ann to fetch gloves. The Rabbit was coming, causing Alice to tremble. The Rabbit tried to open the door, but Alice's size blocked it. Deciding to enter through the window, Alice made a grab, causing a commotion. She heard whispers and tried again, resulting in more chaos. As she awaited the next move, she heard voices discussing using a ladder and going down the chimney. Alice pondered what would come next, wishing they could just pull her out of the window.|"[""1.

"Alice ventured into the chimney, awaiting the sound of a creature above. With a swift kick, the chorus of ""There goes Bill!"" echoed, followed by the Rabbit's call. Amidst the chaos, pebbles transformed into cakes, sparking an idea. Alice ate one, shrinking instantly. Escaping outside, she encountered a group of animals. Determined to return to her size, Alice sought a solution. Spotting a mushroom, she found a caterpillar atop it. After a peculiar exchange, the Caterpillar shared a cryptic message about growing taller or shorter. Alice broke off a piece, causing rapid changes. Amid confusion, she managed to consume another part, leading to an elongated neck and a surprising encounter with a pigeon."|['1.

The Pigeon, troubled by serpents, shared its woes with Alice. As they conversed, Alice nibbled on a mushroom, altering her height. She then encountered a small house and realized she needed to shrink further to avoid startling its occupants. A Fish-Footman and a Frog-Footman appeared, delivering an invitation for the Duchess to play croquet. The Footmen's curls tangled as they spoke. They explained the futility of knocking due to the commotion inside. Alice entered to find a chaotic scene in the kitchen: the Duchess nursing a baby, the cook stirring a peppery soup, and a grinning cat. Amidst the sneezing and howling, the cook began hurling kitchenware at the Duchess and the baby, who seemed unfazed by the chaos.|['1.

"The Duchess tossed the baby at Alice, saying, ""You may nurse it a bit if you like. I must prepare for croquet with the Queen."" Alice struggled to catch the odd-shaped baby, thinking, ""They might harm it if I don't take it."" Aloud, she pondered, ""Would it be murder to leave it?"" The baby grunted in response, revealing it was a pig. Alice let it go, relieved. She then encountered the Cheshire-Cat, seeking directions. Moving on, she spotted the March Hare's large house. The occupants claimed there was no room, but Alice sat down anyway. The Hatter poured tea on the Dormouse, who mumbled in agreement. Alice left, declaring it the silliest tea party. Spotting a tree with a door, she decided to enter."|"['1.

Alice found herself once more in the long hall, near the small glass table. Using the golden key, she unlocked the door to the garden. Eating the mushroom piece she had kept in her pocket, she grew to a foot tall. Walking through the passage, she entered the beautiful garden with bright flowers and cool fountains. She saw a rose-tree with white roses being painted red by three gardeners. When asked why, they explained it was a mistake and they risked losing their heads if the Queen found out. Then, the Queen arrived with a grand procession, including soldiers, courtiers, royal children, and guests. They played croquet with live hedgehogs as balls and flamingos as mallets, following no rules and leading to the Queen's angry outbursts.
