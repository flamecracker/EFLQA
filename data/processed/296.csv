A woman named Mrs. Fowler faced a challenging situation after her husband's death. She had a daughter named Grace and a man named Frank, who she mistakenly told was her husband. Frank, unaware of the truth, treated Grace like a sister. When Mrs. Fowler passed away, the truth came out to Frank.

In a week, we settled in a small but busy place. With some help, we saved $150 yearly in a bank. However, after five years, the money stopped due to a financial crisis. Mrs. Fowler's health worsened, and she feared the worst. Meanwhile, Frank faced challenges from a mean boy named Tom. Another family, the Pomeroy's, though not wealthy, were kinder and more generous.

Frank carefully followed the letter's instructions, locating the gold pieces and securing them in his pocketbook. He decided not to inform Grace about the letter immediately, fearing that Deacon Pinkerton might claim the money to settle his debt if he found out. Frank expressed his independence by stating he would not seek any favors and planned to leave the house to stay with Mr. Pomeroy for a few days. Mr. Pomeroy acknowledged Frank's situation, mentioning that finding employment would be beneficial for him. Despite facing insults, Frank maintained his composure until he was provoked by Tom, whom he retaliated against. The next morning, Deacon Pinkerton intended to take Frank to the poorhouse at Tom's request but was too late as Frank had already left for New York.

The housekeeper was unaware of her nephew's true intentions. She believed he cared for her, not realizing his selfish nature. She valued his help as he only earned three dollars weekly as a cash-boy to support his sister and himself. Curious about his compensation, she planned to ask Frank directly. When Mr. Wharton left for an engagement, she seized the chance to speak with Frank in the library. Alone, she pondered his motives and found his face familiar.

John Wade had been preoccupied with his uncle and didn't notice Frank until he coughed, catching John's attention. John was visibly affected, starting and turning pale, his eyes fixed on Frank. Mr. Wharton, finishing his sentence, explained that due to his weak eyes, he hired a reader. John, his nephew, refrained from asking about Frank and decided to inquire with the housekeeper later.
