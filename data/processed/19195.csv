One nice morning in the fall, when Rollo was around five years old, he sat on the porch behind his dad's house, playing. He had a hammer, nails, and some small boards, trying to build a box. Despite his efforts, he got frustrated and decided to watch Jonas instead. Jonas wheeled the barrow to the barn, got an axe, and took the sides off the wheelbarrow. Rollo felt disappointed and upset, even shedding a tear. His mom noticed his behavior and made him wait longer before going out with Jonas as a consequence. Rollo realized his mistake, decided to read for the extra time, and even read more than required to show his remorse. His mom appreciated his positive attitude and rewarded him before he set off into the woods.|['**1.

James felt a bit upset when he realized that Rollo could reach higher than him. Boys can be unreasonable when they argue. Trying to outdo Rollo, James grabbed a stick and raised it high, cautioning about throwing stones. Unfortunately, a stone fell on James's head, but his cap softened the blow. Upset, James began to cry, but Jonas, who usually rushed to help, continued working. James's crying stopped when he noticed a missing half dollar. Accusations flew between James and Rollo, each claiming ownership of the remaining coin. Jonas intervened, revealing scratch marks on the coin, proving it belonged to Rollo.
