Captain Jack Templeton of the U.S.S. Plymouth issued a secret sailing order to depart at 4 a.m. The ship's crew prepared swiftly without the usual chaos associated with such commands. The engines hummed to life, torpedoes were armed, and final provisions were made. Captain Templeton, along with his officers, oversaw the preparations. As the Plymouth slipped out of the British port, it positioned itself strategically in the Irish Sea. The fleet of four destroyers, including the Plymouth, escorted wounded soldiers on transport ships back to America. Frank, a crew member, navigated through the ship's levels to reach the furnace area, preparing for the journey ahead. The fleet sailed through the night and into the day, maintaining a vigilant watch for any dangers as they escorted the convoy to safety.|"['1. What did Captain Templeton do before the U.S.S.

Below, instead of dust, heat, the clatter of shovels, grimy, sweating fireman, such as the thought of the furnace room of a ship of war calls to the mind of the landsman, a watertender stood calmly watching the glow of oil jets feeding the furnace fire. Now and then he cast an eye to the gauge glasses. The vibration of the hull and the hum of the blower were the only sounds below. For the motive power of the Plymouth was not furnished by coal. Rather, it was oil--crude petroleum--that drove the vessel along. And though oil has its advantage over coal, it has its disadvantages as well. It was Frank's first experience aboard an oil-burner, and he had not become used to it yet. He smelled oil in the smoke from the funnels, he breathed it from the oil range in the galley. His clothes gathered it from stanchions and rails. The water tanks were flavored with the seepage from neighboring compartments. Frank drank petroleum in the water and tasted it in the soup. The butter, he thought, tasted like some queer vaseline. But Frank knew that eventually he would get used to it. The sea was rough, but nevertheless the speed of the flotilla was not slackened. It was the desire of Captain Petlow, in charge of the destroyer fleet, to convoy the transports beyond the danger point at the earliest possible moment. The Plymouth lurched up|['1.

Frank argued with Jack about the monotony of their naval duties, comparing it to a taxi driver's job. He expressed his desire to explore new places on land after having covered sixty thousand miles at sea. Later that night, Frank was on watch duty and rushed to the bridge upon hearing an alarm. He witnessed a British warship colliding with a surfaced submarine in a fog. Jack, the captain of the U.S.S. Plymouth, was proud of his command, having recently been promoted. When both the captain and first officer fell ill, Frank, an American, and Jack's close friend from their war days, stepped in to ensure the ship could sail to Liverpool as ordered. Lord Hastings, a former commander of Jack and Frank, supported their temporary service with the British navy.|"[""1.

In terms of physical strength, Jack surpassed Frank by a large margin, although Frank was not weak either. However, Frank excelled in marksmanship with both rifle and revolver, causing some envy in Jack. Both boys were skilled in self-defense and swordsmanship. The story begins with the allied fleets containing the Germans at Helgoland. Despite some attempts by the Germans to break the blockade and attack merchant ships, they were always defeated. The Germans were preparing submarines for a daring mission across the Atlantic. Despite some initial successful voyages to America, the Germans were planning a more severe blow against allied shipping near the American coast. Lord Hastings entrusted Jack and Frank with delivering crucial messages to the American navy department, bypassing traditional channels for urgency. They were given commissions aboard H.M.S. Brigadier for this important mission.|"['1.

Frank expressed his admiration for the United States, emphasizing its greatness compared to other countries like England. Inside Jack's cabin on the Brigadier, the new commander, Jack, and his friend Frank discussed ship discipline. Jack, now in command of the small destroyer, inspected the ship with Frank, noting its clean and well-maintained condition. The Brigadier, equipped with 9-inch guns and torpedo tubes, was modern and capable of reaching a speed of twenty-three knots. Jack was impressed by the ship's equipment and crew. Frank marveled at Jack's rise to command in the British Navy in just a few years, expressing his own admiration for Jack's position.|"['1.

On the ship, Jack and his crew were vigilant as they sailed through the English Channel, knowing enemy submarines could be lurking nearby. Despite British naval precautions, submarines had breached the channel before. As the H.M.S. Brigadier cruised at twenty knots, Jack oversaw preparations for any potential encounters. The crew was on high alert, especially after a recent attack on an allied transport by a German submarine. Frank and Lieutenant Hetherton discussed the submarine tactics, noting the lack of warnings given by the Germans to avoid detection. Suddenly, the crew spotted the Hazelton in distress, under attack by a submarine. As chaos unfolded, lifeboats were launched, and the Brigadier became a target. Jack swiftly navigated the ship, evading torpedoes while the crew fought back. The intense battle against the lurking submarines demanded quick action to ensure the safety of all aboard.|"[""1.

From the second submarine's deck, a machine gun relentlessly fired at the helpless lifeboats. Jack couldn't assess the damage immediately, but he sensed casualties. The submarine and destroyer continued their intense battle. The submarine commander skillfully evaded the destroyer's shells. Survivors from the lifeboats reached the Brigadier, where they were provided with dry clothes. Among them were three women saved from the Hazelton, but sadly, a dozen crew members perished in the attack. Jack confronted the German officer, labeling him a murderer and ordering him in irons. He emphasized the officer's heinous acts and vowed to ensure justice prevailed. Jack's firm stance against the enemy's ruthless actions resonated with the crew, highlighting the consequences of such despicable behavior.|"['1.

"Frank did not ask any questions. He understood that Jack would explain the change soon. Besides, it was not his concern. He gave the necessary orders. Jack then turned to the second officer. The return journey was quick and incident-free. Jack ensured the safe landing of Hazelton's victims and handed over the ship to Lieutenant Hetherton before going ashore with Frank to report to Lord Hastings.

The Hindustan, stationed at Chatham and later at the Swim, served as the main ship and training base. To accommodate the increasing number of personnel, around 350 seamen and marines were transferred to the Dominion. Captain Herbert Grant carefully selected Liverpool ferry steamers Iris and Gloucester for their shallow draft, crucial for maneuvering in shallow waters and avoiding obstacles. Vice-Admiral Sir Roger Keyes, Rear Admiral Cecil F. Dampier, and Commodore Algernon Boyle played key roles in planning and preparing the operation. Smoke screening was identified as essential for success, leading Wing Commander Brock to devise an effective system. Admiral Beatty provided additional support by sending a group of officers and men. Navigational aids were established, and forces from Swim and Dover joined to proceed to their designated stations. The operation was meticulously planned with strict communication protocols and prearranged maneuvers. Jack and Frank, along with the crew of the Brigadier, eagerly awaited their role in the daring mission.|['1.

Jack had explained that most of the operation needed to happen during the day, which increased the risk of being spotted by enemy planes or submarines. To counter this danger, Admiral Keyes' scouting escort accompanied them. When they reached a favorable position, a prearranged signal was sent to the detached forces to stick to the plan. The group stopped a mile and a half from Commodore Boyle's force to disembark extra teams and launch the coastal motor boats, following previous instructions. The Warwick and Whirlwind, along with the destroyers, advanced to clear the passage from enemy vessels. The Vindictive altered her course towards the Mole, while the Warwick, Phoebe, and North Star circled nearby until the end of the operation. The Warwick strategically placed smoke screens, especially when the wind changed direction, aiding the mission. Monitors and small craft bombarded specific enemy positions to weaken their defenses. The main goal was to divert attention from blocking the canal while capturing key batteries and causing damage on the Mole. Captain Carpenter led the Vindictive, supported by Captain Templeton on the Brigadier and other vessels for rescue and smoke screen deployment. The operation started at 11.40 p.m. on April 22, 1918, with coastal motorboats laying a smoke screen under enemy fire. As they approached the Mole, the enemy noticed them, and the situation intensified.|"[""1.

Quickly, following orders, the port 6-inch battery, upper deck pompoms, and the gun in the foretop all fired simultaneously. The Brigadier, under Jack's command, also opened fire. German shells splashed near the Vindictive and Brigadier, but none hit. Jack managed the ship from the flame-thrower hut, while Frank was ready to take over. The port anchor was dropped near the Mole, but the ship rolled due to the tide. Despite broken brows and heavy fire, a storming party led by Lieutenant-Commander Adams landed. More support was needed, and Jack swiftly responded. The storming continued despite heavy gunfire. The Gloucester assisted in securing the Vindictive to the Mole.

The assault on the Mole was meant to be carried out by a storming force to clear the way for a second force to destroy the enemy's guns. The initial landing was off target, causing disarray among the attackers. Commander Adams and Frank led the charge, facing heavy machine-gun fire. After a successful grenade attack, they regrouped but found themselves in a dangerous position between enemy and friendly fire. Frank risked his life to get reinforcements from the Vindictive, dodging bullets along the way. Upon reaching the ship, Frank briefed Lieutenant-Commander Hastings on the situation. The storming party's priority was taking a fortified zone to prevent enemy fire on incoming troops.|"[""1.

From their fortified positions, the Germans quickly emerged to face the British sailors, machine-guns at the ready. Simultaneously, Frank directed his own machine-guns to fire upon the advancing enemy. The clash of steel and the crack of revolvers filled the air as men fell on both sides. Initially, it seemed the attacking force might be pushed back by sheer numbers, but they rallied and surged forward once more, overwhelming the Germans. The enemy retreated to their fortified position, closely pursued by the British. Commander Adams then split his forces to cover different fronts, with Frank securing the landward side and Commander Hastings attacking the fortified zone.

The troops retreated in an organized manner, ensuring their wounded were taken with them. Moving from the Mole to the parapet using scaling ladders became risky due to enemy fire, destroying several ladders. Men crossed in small groups, taking advantage of the battleships' long-range fire. Rushes were timed between German attacks. Returning to their ships, they re-embarked as they had left, climbing back to the Vindictive's deck and then to their respective ships via small boats. Frank, the Brigadier, assessed his men, noting few casualties; less than a dozen killed and fifteen wounded. He reported to Jack, who remained composed despite the battle's intensity. The successful raid sealed Ostend and Zeebrugge harbors, crippling German submarine operations. The British losses were significant, with the Vindictive and Brigadier sustaining heavy damage. The damaged ships were docked for repairs, and the mission's success dealt a blow to the Germans, hastening the war's end.|"['1.

On May 10, the first ship sinking was reported off the American coast by German submarines. Following that, eighteen more vessels met a similar fate. However, as the waters were well patrolled, submarine attacks ceased. Submarines were later sighted off the Carolinas and Florida, but no attacks occurred. The next reports placed them near South America. The Essex left Hampton Roads and communicated with Admiral Sellings on the Dakota. Despite the dangerous mission, the crew remained composed, trusting their capable commander. Jack spotted a submarine near the Ventura, where a scuffle ensued on the ship's deck. As the submarine launched a torpedo, the Essex maneuvered to evade it while firing a shot. The submarine crew jumped into the sea, escaping the confrontation.|['1.

The naval officer was replaced, and a new man was brought in. Jack questioned him, but no one revealed the submarine's location. Jack decided to approach the submarine by land due to the dangerous reef. As they reached the shore, they quietly boarded small boats. Approaching the submarine, a sudden flare exposed them to the Germans on board, leading to a brief exchange of gunfire. The next morning, the Essex set sail, leaving behind the Cutlip father and son duo, now reconciled. The ambassador arrived promptly and took the boys to meet the Secretary of the Navy and then President Wilson at the White House. The President commended them for their bravery, especially Frank, whom he suspected to be American. He bid them farewell, hoping to meet them again in the future.|['1.

The Secretary expressed gratitude for their service on behalf of the American people. Jack and Frank dined with the ambassador before boarding the Essex for Newport News. The Commandant of Fortress Monroe visited to pay his respects. The Essex then joined the Grand Fleet in the North Sea for patrol duty. As days turned into weeks and months, the Germans remained in Helgoland, avoiding battle. News of an armistice signaled the war's end. Frank doubted the Germans would risk engagement, foreseeing their reluctance to face defeat. Jack agreed, noting the German fleet's vulnerability if they ventured out. The crew had occasional shore leave during replenishments. They awaited further developments as the war approached its conclusion.|"['1.

Frank explained that the German fleet was formidable and likely to remain intact until the end of the war. The Essex swiftly changed course to intercept the enemy, with several other ships joining the pursuit. Jack anticipated that this would be the enemy's final attempt, aiming to cause damage before the war's end. However, fortified coast cities were prepared this time. As the Essex engaged the enemy, the first shell hit a German vessel, causing a devastating explosion that split the ship in two. The dramatic scene unfolded with a blaze of fire and darkness as the enemy ship was destroyed.|"[""1.

The German ships formed a semi-circle, aiming their guns at the Essex. However, the British ship's accurate range caused significant damage to the German vessel. Upon hearing the British warship Lion's gun, the German admiral realized they were discovered. As more British ships joined the battle, the German fleet had no choice but to fight. The Essex maneuvered skillfully, avoiding critical hits. With the British fleet approaching, the Germans shifted their focus. The Lion targeted the German battleships, while the Essex, commanded by Jack, retaliated against the Potsdam. The Potsdam's shells narrowly missed the destroyer, but one hit caused damage. The intense battle continued as both sides exchanged fire at close range.|"[""1.

Upon examination, Frank discovered that the shell had pierced through the front walls of the ship, causing the outer compartments to flood. Fortunately, the inner sections remained intact. The ship's carpenter assured that the damage could be fixed within thirty minutes, and there were no casualties. Suddenly, a massive explosion rocked the area near the Essex as the German ship Baden erupted in flames after a shell hit its engine room. With only four enemy ships left, the British fleet of eight vessels swiftly moved to intercept them. Admiral Krauss sought an escape route and believed he found one between the British ships Peerless and Falcon to the east. The British ships, including Lion, Tiger, White Hawk, Brewster, and Southampton, chased the fleeing Germans. The Falcon and Peerless fired at the enemy, while Lion delivered a final blow to a crippled German ship. The Essex joined the fight, showcasing precise marksmanship until the order to cease fire was given.|"['1.

The final sea battle of the great war concluded as the German war machine faced defeat. The destroyer Essex witnessed the Wilhelm II being hit by a shell, leading to a swift sinking. Meanwhile, the Peerless and Falcon engaged with other German ships, while the Lion, Tiger, and additional vessels approached from behind. The smoke from the guns obscured the view, but the sounds of battle were clear. The Hamburg began to sink, abandoned by its crew who sought refuge on the Bismarck. As November approached, the war's end drew near, with Germany losing allies and seeking peace. Despite negotiations, the German delegates initially rejected the armistice terms, heightening anticipation among the fleet. Patrol work continued cautiously, as British sailors remained vigilant until the final peace agreement was reached.|"[""1.

"On every ship in the fleet that night, similar scenes unfolded. Officers and crew members stayed up late, anticipating news of the armistice being signed. However, by midnight, no confirmation had arrived. While the larger ships continued their patrol duties, the resting crew members slept, except for the officers and night radio operators who remained vigilant.

Amidst the quiet night, a surprising sight met Frank's eyes as he saw Jack, usually composed, partaking in a lively dance on the bridge with other crew members. The shrill whistle continued to echo through the ship.

Even after the armistice was signed, Admiral Beatty kept the fleet on high alert due to past German treachery. Days later, arrangements were made for the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet. Jack and his crew awaited instructions to join the British fleet for this historic event, filled with anticipation and excitement."|['1.

Throughout the day, warships continued to arrive and align in two long rows on the water, preparing for the surrender of German vessels. As the horizon filled with ships, the roar of guns signaled the arrival of Admiral Beatty's flagship, carrying King George and Queen Mary. The British and allied battleships, vigilant and ready for action, formed an impressive line for miles. Every ship was on high alert, anticipating any sign of trickery from the enemy. At the eastern end of the fleet, Jack commanded the destroyer Essex, overseeing the inspection of German submarines preparing to surrender. The submarines, flying no flags, had their crews on deck as they approached the British fleet, signaling an end to hostilities.|"['1.

The submarines were boarded by the crew of the Essex to ensure they were safe. The British fleet escorted the U-Boats towards Harwich for surrender. The German admiral surrendered the submarines to Admiral Tyrwhitt. British seaplanes and an airship appeared, adding to the spectacle. British crews took over the submarines to sail them to port.

It was a historic day for England as the German fleet surrendered to the allied forces, marking the end of their ruthless undersea warfare. Thousands gathered in Harwich to witness the formal surrender, celebrating through the night. The next day, the British and American fleets, led by the Queen Elizabeth and the New York, accepted the surrender of approximately 150 German war vessels. The German crews were transferred to smaller vessels to return home, while the British crews took control. The once proud German fleet now sailed towards Harwich under the watchful eyes of the allied forces. The surrender signified the end of the war, despite the absence of a formal peace treaty.

Jack and his friend discussed the future of the German empire, hoping it would be divided to prevent another world struggle. They conversed late into the night before receiving orders via wireless from Lord Hastings. The destroyer they were on was now on a peaceful voyage, no longer armed for war. Upon reaching Dover harbor, they reported to Lord Hastings late at night. He advised them to leave the navy for new opportunities in the consular or diplomatic services. Lord Hastings used his influence to secure their discharges, suggesting they go to the United States. Within two weeks, they were discharged and stayed with Lord Hastings in London. Frank planned a surprise return home after communicating with his father. Standing on the liner's deck, he knew his return would be a pleasant surprise.|"['1.
