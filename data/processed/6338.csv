In a dimly lit office at the Labyrinth mine, Case Canfield, the caretaker, sat with four Boy Scouts from the Beaver Patrol, Chicago. The scouts, George, Charley, Tommy, and Will, had passed exams to become Ambulance Aids, Stalkers, Pioneers, and Seamen. They were led by Scoutmaster Will and Patrol Leader George. The mine had been closed for months due to disputes between owners. Canfield mentioned rumors of two missing boys, Jimmie and Dick, who worked there before disappearing. A New York lawyer hired Canfield to find the boys, suspecting they ran away after a prank. Canfield doubted the lawyer's dedication to the search, suggesting he spent time in nearby saloons. The scouts prepared to search the mine for clues about the missing boys.|"['1.

"The caretaker chuckled, ""I've seen strange things in Tunnel Six - lights and eerie noises. But why would two boys hide there?"" Will questioned. The caretaker left the decision to the boys, suggesting they explore the mine. Will proposed camping in the breaker, a cozy spot to stay hidden. They found a small room, planning to clean it later. The caretaker arranged beds, bedding, and electricity for comfort. They cooked supper with provisions brought in. Covered windows with canvas, they settled in for the night. Tommy and Sandy stayed awake, playing pranks. They ventured into the mine shaft, exploring the eerie darkness."|"['1.

"""Okay,"" Sandy said with a smile. ""We'll sneak down quietly so that whoever's at the bottom with the light won't suspect we're close. Maybe we can catch the person behind the ghost sightings."" Tommy took a deep breath as they reached the bottom of the shaft. He shone his light up and estimated they were much closer to the earth's core. ""I recall the Labyrinth mine is only about 500 feet deep with three levels at 300, 400, and 500 feet,"" Sandy remembered. ""But how will we find our way back with all these passages?"" Tommy questioned. As they walked along the gangway, between tramway rails for coal delivery, the eerie atmosphere with dark walls, echoing sounds, and dripping water made the place seem mysterious. Suddenly, they noticed a light moving above them, seemingly floating in the air. The boys watched it, speculating if their friends were trying to scare them. Despite calling out, the response was silence. Sandy proposed they move around a rock shoulder and turn off their lights to see if the mysterious light would reappear."|"['1.

Two boys ventured through a dark passage until they reached a brattice, a screen diverting air to workers. They turned off their lights and discussed Indian signs. One boy placed a stone to signal the trail. Feeling lost, they reasoned they should have found the shaft by now. Suddenly, one stumbled on a familiar obstruction. Confused, they followed a cord but ended up back at the same chamber. They found a second trail sign, realizing they were lost. One suggested using the Beaver Patrol call to alert others. Meanwhile, Will prepared breakfast, joking about waking up his friends. George chuckled, remarking on Tommy and Sandy's knack for trouble.|['1.

The boys made a big breakfast hoping Tommy and Sandy would return hungry. They kept checking the mine's dark depths. Will grumbled about their habit of getting in trouble, especially at night. He suggested seeking Canfield's advice before searching. The caretaker and a suspicious man arrived, boasting about secret service work. They believed the boys left due to past offenses. The detective seemed relieved when they decided to stop searching. The caretaker warned about the labyrinthine mine and strange activities. Ventner got wind of their plans through the caretaker.

"""He always goes alone,"" the answer came. Once, the caretaker accompanied him partway but was asked to go in a different direction. The caretaker decided to guide two boys to the mine's bottom, ensuring they wouldn't get lost. They received instructions and split up with lights to explore. As they ventured, they heard the caretaker's concern about water flooding the mine. The caretaker mentioned boats stored in the mine but was unsure of their location. Canfield, sensing urgency, planned to call for help. The boys left a light at the shaft and rowed a boat, using flashlights to navigate. They heard mysterious sounds, heightening their tension. George remarked on the recurring mysterious adventures they always encountered on their trips."|"[""1.

George and Will were deep inside the mine, following a mysterious figure in a boat. As they navigated through dark chambers, they realized the mine was flooding rapidly. Concerned about the rising water levels and potential dangers, they debated whether to turn back. George expressed fear of the murky water, likening it to a swamp full of snakes and alligators. Will, aware of the impending danger of unbreathable air, urged George to swim despite his apprehension. As they encountered obstacles and signs of someone seeking refuge in the mine, they pondered the challenges ahead.

"""I wonder what happened to that detective?"" George asked after a pause. ""We heard him rowing ahead, then suddenly, silence. It was dull waiting in the sealed chamber.

As the boys neared the station lights, they split up, with Will and George veering off while Sandy and Tommy continued ahead. Once they were a safe distance from the tracks, they walked about twenty rods apart, perpendicular to the right of way. Tommy and his friend's path to the mine led them across various tracks, passing by the weigh-house and eventually reaching the breaker. Approaching a line of empty cars on a spur, they heard a noise from one of the cars and crouched to listen. Tommy, getting under the empty car, listened closely and heard a heavy object being dragged inside. Suddenly, a shadowy figure jumped out of the car, but Sandy, following instructions, tripped the figure to the ground. The fallen person complained of an attempted attack, warning about dangerous individuals nearby. Tommy realized they had let another person escape, causing potential trouble as their presence might be known to the mine workers.

The detective decided to abandon his attempt to enter the mine and left the area. Will and George, along with their friends Tommy and Sandy, were led down to a cozy room in the mine where they could stay hidden. The room was well-furnished with a lounge, cupboards, a table, and chairs. Electric lamps provided light without giving away their presence. The boys discussed the detective's stubbornness and the mystery surrounding the hidden boys in the mine. They listened for any signs of activity but all was quiet.

"Will chuckled as he leaned against the wooden supports. ""It'll be just as dark in the morning as it is now!"" he exclaimed. ""Let's head down tonight and find the others."" The boys swiftly descended the ladder, pausing briefly on each level. The passageways leading from the shaft were starting to dry up, but further down, they were still damp.""Maybe we can follow them to their hideout,"" George proposed. ""But I'd rather not stray too far from the shaft. These tunnels are like a maze."" The mine was chilly and damp, with a draft blowing through the passage. They pressed on until the light they were tracking veered off into a side passage and vanished. Whispers filled the air as the boys discussed their next move. Suddenly, they spotted the detective in a chamber, diligently digging through a pile of debris. They realized he wasn't searching for the missing boys but had his own agenda.

"Tommy exclaimed, ""You weren't hiding behind the door when they gave out nerve, either!"" Elmer responded, ""I haven't been looking for them tonight. I tried to follow you to the mine when you left me at the car, but lost track in the darkness."" Elmer then mentioned that someone had forced an entrance before him with a tool. He suggested bringing Jimmie and Dick up to discuss their plans. Elmer hinted at keeping their presence in the mine a secret from Lawyer Horton. He proposed going down quietly to avoid detection. As they descended, a rockfall was heard from a nearby passage. Elmer expressed concern for the boys' safety. The group proceeded cautiously, wearing rubber boots for stealth.

The boys hurried along until they reached a junction and turned right. As they left the main path, they heard footsteps and the distant sound of ladder rungs creaking. Elmer argued about the risks of someone digging in the mine. They cautiously listened for their friends' voices beyond a wall, worried they might be trapped. Peering into a chamber, they saw Jimmie and Dick surrounded by debris, frantically shining their lights. The boys yelled for help as rats closed in on them. Their friends outside threw debris to keep the rats at bay. With guns drawn, they instructed Jimmie and Dick to climb over the wall. The rats bit at their boots, but the boys managed to escape.|"['1.

That evening, during the board meeting, Will shared a tale about Stephen Carson. He claimed that Carson went to a safety deposit vault and took a large sum of money and jewelry, disappearing afterward. Later, Carson returned, mentioning he misplaced the jewelry in a mine. Elmer suggested adjusting the report to reflect that Carson withdrew a significant amount from the Night and Day bank before vanishing. Carson returned the money and hired detectives to locate the missing items. The boys, exploring the mine, encountered a detective planting dynamite. They hurried to stop him, fearing an explosion. Jimmie suspected the money might be hidden in a chamber they were investigating. Elmer doubted an explosion would occur, as the fuse was too long. The boys quickly left the tool house, hearing warnings as they descended the ladders.|"['1.

After a brief breakfast, Elmer regretted involving a detective. Jimmie expressed pessimism, foreseeing Ventner denying finding the money. As they descended, a sound alarmed them.

The plan was for Jimmie to stealthily move ahead of his friends without a light to deceive any potential traps. By doing so, he could infiltrate the enemy's position before they realized the group was split up. Jimmie discovered a stone cairn and relayed the information to Will and Elmer. As the trio cautiously moved forward, they deciphered Jimmie's messages using phosphorus markings. Jimmie's coded messages warned them of danger and instructed them to stay put.

The four boys, Will, Elmer, Tommy, and Sandy, raced down the gangway with their searchlights. Mr. Carson and Mr. Buck followed more slowly, feeling their way through the dark tunnel. Will led the way into the lighted area by the shaft, where he noticed one of the cages moving upward. He quickly pressed the button, causing the cage to drop back down. The elevator operator responded swiftly to Will's signals, bringing the elevator to the second level. Despite the bar being down, Will pushed it aside and stepped out, finding the bank cashier and miner nearby. The detective, wounded, stumbled into the light, revealing the recovery of the stolen money. The adventure concluded with the hold-up men in prison and the detective promising to stay away from illegal activities.|"['1.
