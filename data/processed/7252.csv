This small book is a tribute to the women who arrived on The Mayflower and those who followed on The Ann and The Fortune, upholding the standards of home life in early Plymouth Colony. It does not delve into family genealogy but aims to shed light on communal life during 1621-1623. The narrative includes glimpses of notable matrons and maidens who influenced domestic life and education. While some facts remain uncertain due to conflicting accounts, efforts have been made to present differing perspectives. The author expresses gratitude to various historical societies, libraries, and individuals who aided in the research. The December weather in New England posed physical challenges for the early settlers, lacking the comforts we have today. The passengers of The Mayflower endured cramped conditions during their ten-week voyage, with women making up a significant portion of the passengers. Upon arrival in Plymouth, they faced harsh conditions, but their resilience and faith sustained them.|"['1.

During the anxious days when the more capable men were searching on land for a location to settle, first on Cape Cod and later at Plymouth, there were dramatic events on the ship anchored in the harbor. Peregrine White was born, and Edward Thompson, a servant, passed away. Tragedy struck when Dorothy May Bradford, the young wife of the future Governor, drowned while he was away. Tensions rose as some crew members and others grew impatient due to the long voyage, lack of comforts, and uncertain future. Despite murmurs and threats against the leaders, most onboard, including women, silently vowed to obey the compact signed on _The Mayflower_, aiming to establish a foundation for spreading the gospel in the new world. The women at Plymouth, like Rose Standish, Katherine Carver, Susanna White, Elizabeth Hopkins, Priscilla Mullins, Mary Chilton, Elizabeth Tilley, and Constance Hopkins, showed resilience and strength, supporting the colony's establishment amidst hardships and illness.|"['1.

During the harsh winter and spring of 1621, the toll of deaths rose, leaving only a few healthy individuals to care for the sick and bury the deceased. Among the deceased were fifteen women who had sailed from England and Holland on the Mayflower. These women, including Rose Standish, Elizabeth Winslow, Mary Allerton, and others, were laid to rest on the Plymouth hillside. Despite the devastating loss, the women who remained showed remarkable courage and resilience. They faced challenges like dwindling supplies, unfinished shelters, and the constant threat of wolves. When offered a chance to return to England in exchange for tending to the sick crew, not a single woman accepted, showcasing their unwavering dedication to their new home. The women, representing various social classes, had to adjust to this new life, far different from their time in Leyden, where they had formed a close-knit community. In Plymouth, they had to navigate diverse backgrounds and learn to coexist harmoniously. Their role in shaping the fledgling settlement was crucial, as they contributed to transforming it into a place they could call home.|"['1.

"It would be unfair to assume that these women were aware of their heroic actions. They acted with bravery and determination equal to the men, but likely none of the Pilgrims had a clear view of the future. Former President Charles W. Eliot praised them, stating, ""The Pilgrims did not know the outcome, they just loved liberty, toleration, and truth."" Spring and summer rewarded them for their endurance and unconscious heroism. The women watched over Samoset, an Indian visitor, with mixed feelings. Through Squanto's influence, a treaty was made with Massasoit in 1621 for peace. Squanto taught the settlers various skills, including planting and gathering food. The children in the colony, despite the challenging circumstances, enjoyed a normal childhood. The settlement was surrounded by beautiful flowers and abundant fruits, providing joy to the women and children. The pioneers also faced challenges like mosquitoes, which they humorously addressed."|['1. What did former President Charles W.

During 1621-2, life for women in Plymouth was tough but varied with good harvests and thrilling incidents. They used Indian corn, barley, and nuts to prepare dishes in their huts. The women baked cakes and stuffed wild turkeys, making the simple fare seem like a feast after months of hardship. By the end of winter, log houses and common buildings were constructed. The houses had thatched roofs and chimneys on the outside, with fireplaces made of stones and clay. The women washed clothes and fetched water from a nearby brook. Exciting events like shooting an eagle, catching seals and a cod, and a lost child stirred up the settlement. A marriage and a duel between two servants added drama to their lives.|['1.

The Thanksgiving Day celebration was a significant event for the settlers. Ninety-one Indians brought deer, adding to the feast where over a hundred and forty people were fed. The colonists also contributed wild turkeys, ducks, fish, and clams. The Pilgrims' prayers and psalms impressed the Indians, just as the Indians' dances and beads amazed the Plymouth Colony. Although there were occasional threats, like stolen tools and a headless arrow wrapped in a snake's skin, the settlers remained vigilant. The arrival of more Pilgrims on _The Fortune_ brought new skills to the colony, such as carpentry and milling. Despite challenges like bad weather and drought, the settlers persevered, showing courage and determination in the face of adversity.|"['1.

"During the early 1600s in Plymouth colony, women like Mistress Susanna White Winslow and Rose Standish had delicate lace-trimmed slippers and embroidered caps. Some wore high ruffs over their shoulders instead of ""whisks."" Children dressed like miniature adults, with girls often in lace-edged aprons. Women had garments like ""petty coats"" mentioned in wills. The women in Plymouth didn't all wear silken or homespun clothes; many heirlooms with rich laces were brought later from England. In 1624, Edward Winslow brought not just clothing but also the first bull and heifers to Plymouth, leading to a redistribution of land and resources. Families like Standish, Alden, and Brewster moved to Duxbury and Marshfield for agriculture, fishing, hunting, and trade. Despite efforts to keep families in town for religious services, many settled in outlying areas."|['1.

The women who arrived on the early ships and settled near Plymouth experienced moments of solitude on their farms despite having large families and numerous chores. They faced threats from wolves, wild animals, and occasional Native American encounters. Severe storms in 1635 and 1638 caused destruction, but overall, peace prevailed, leading to prosperity for many families. Through wills and historical records deciphered by George Ernest Bowman, glimpses of the women's lives emerge. The Pilgrim women, like the men, exhibited qualities such as energy, faith, courage, and patience. Some women, like Dorothy May Bradford and Rose Standish, played significant roles. Dorothy, who tragically drowned at Cape Cod, left a son named John. Rose, the wife of Captain Standish, is remembered through relics like a quilt. Elizabeth Barker, Edward Winslow's first wife, is depicted in a painting with her son. These women, though not extensively documented, contributed to the early Plymouth community.|"['1.

Mistress Mary Brewster, the respected matriarch of the group of women who survived the harsh winters of 1621-2, was a devout and influential figure. Her husband, the Elder, and Pastor John Robinson both praised her for her unwavering faith and moral guidance. Despite her declining health, she continued to fulfill her responsibilities until her passing in 1627. Mistress Brewster, a mother of five, was known for her domestic skills and acceptance of help from younger women when needed. While she may not have been highly educated, she valued the Scriptures and her husband's extensive library. Her life was not without sorrow, as she faced the loss of her daughters and witnessed disagreements among her sons. In contrast, Mistress Susanna White Winslow, the mother of Peregrine White, the first English child born in New England, led a life of privilege and prominence. Her marriage to Governor Edward Winslow brought her social status and worldly comforts. Despite her husband's frequent absences due to his diplomatic duties, she managed their estate and raised their children with grace and strength.

In the early days of Plymouth colony, children were often placed in service while their parents faced punishment for trying to take them away. Francis Billington, once known for minor offenses like smoking in public, later became more stable and served on committees. Helen Billington, however, faced many troubles in the colony. Alongside these challenges, four maidens played crucial roles in household work and childcare: Priscilla Mullins, Mary Chilton, Elizabeth Tilley, and Constance Hopkins. Priscilla's lineage was noble, and though much of her life remains a mystery, she is celebrated in literature. Priscilla eventually married John Alden, a cooper who settled in Plymouth. Their story, as told by Bradford, is a tale of romance and commitment, with John choosing to stay and marry Priscilla, starting a family together in the new colony.|"['1.
