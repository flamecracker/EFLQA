This small book recounts a journey to the Arctic regions that occurred in the early 19th century. The purpose was to reach the North Pole, believed to be surrounded by ice-free water. The ship got stuck in ice, and the crew encountered Eskimos, witnessing their survival techniques and interactions with wildlife like walruses and polar bears. After being trapped for years, some crew members suffered from scurvy, a disease caused by a lack of fresh produce. Eventually, the crew abandoned the ship, which was crushed by ice. They found an Eskimo village and learned of a nearby Danish settlement. The crew's return to Europe was met with cheers and tears as they left for the far north, facing the harsh Arctic conditions.|"['1.

Many days and nights passed as the _Hope_ sailed steadily towards the coast of North America. Their first hope was to sight Greenland, followed by navigating through Baffin's Bay to reach the open polar sea. Initially, the voyage was prosperous with fair weather and a favorable wind. But one night, a deep calm descended, leaving the sea still as a looking-glass. Captain Harvey and his nephew, Tom Gregory, a young but skilled surgeon, walked the deck discussing the calm. Tom, a strapping and kind-hearted youth, had joined the voyage to explore the Polar regions and enhance his knowledge of the world. As the calm continued, storm clouds gathered, and the crew, including able seamen like Sam Baker, Joe Davis, and Jim Croft, swiftly prepared the ship for the unexpected strong breeze. The crew, a mix of individuals in size, shape, and complexion, worked together efficiently to navigate through the sudden change in weather.|"[""1.

The storm hit the brig with full force as the crew hurried to secure the sails. The waves towered like mountains, chasing the ship as if eager to engulf it. The sky darkened, the wind howled, and the canvas strained against the masts. It was a terrifying night, reminding even the bravest of their vulnerability. Mr. Dicey, however, remained calm, treating the storm like a minor inconvenience. As the night progressed, the storm intensified into a hurricane. The captain, trusting Mr. Dicey's nonchalance, retired below deck. Suddenly, a massive wave crashed onto the deck, nearly sweeping Mr. Dicey overboard. The storm raged until dawn, revealing a breathtaking sight of ice formations resembling a magical city. Young Gregory, intrigued by the icy landscape, joined Jim Croft on deck, where they marveled at the frozen spectacle.|"[""1.

The captain rushed to the deck as the ice closed in on their ship. He urgently called for all the crew to come up on deck for their lives. The crew hurriedly emerged, some even sick, holding their clothes. The ice was so close that it almost touched the ship's sides. The tension was palpable as the ice slowly squeezed against the ship. The ship started trembling, beams cracking under the pressure. The captain knew their ship, the _Nancy_, was not built for these icy waters. As the ice pressed harder, the ship's sides caved in. The crew swiftly followed the captain's orders to abandon the ship and move to the ice. The ship sank quickly, leaving them stranded on the ice. It was a close call, but thankfully, they were near the _Bullfinch_ and managed to scramble back aboard after a challenging journey over the ice.|"['1.

Gregory expressed his delight in the icy surroundings but hoped their brig, the Hope, would not face the same challenges as the Nancy. Croft, confident in the ship's strength, assured Gregory of the Hope's ability to endure harsh conditions due to the additional timbers installed. The vessel, originally sturdy, underwent extensive strengthening measures to prepare for icy battles. The hull was sheathed with hardwood planking, reinforced with cross-beams and iron stanchions, particularly focusing on the bow. Captain Harvey spared no expense in ensuring the safety of his crew, provisioned for a two-and-a-half-year voyage. As the ice closed in, the crew engaged in a game of snowball, enjoying an unexpected break. The crew then witnessed the ice shifting due to ocean currents and winds, prompting the ship to resume its journey northward.|"['1.

The ship, called the _Hope_, was navigating through icy waters. As the crew enjoyed tea in the cabin, a sudden thump threw them off balance. The ship's bell rang, and they rushed to the deck. The wind picked up, pushing the brig perilously close to ice floes. The crew faced the dilemma of charging through a thick neck of ice or reducing sail. With the ship hurtling towards the ice, it struck head-on, shattering the obstacle and surging forward triumphantly. The crew marveled at the ship's resilience, contemplating whether to name her the _Good Hope_.

In the icy Arctic, the crew of the _Hope_ faced a perilous situation as the ship was surrounded by towering icebergs. The sky was unusually bright, with three sun-like spots known as _parhelia_ or sun-dogs. Despite this fascinating sight, the crew's focus shifted to their safety as the pack ice closed in around them. The captain, with a hint of worry, consulted his mate on whether to stay put or risk navigating through the tightening ice. The mate advised caution, highlighting the importance of a small ice tongue protecting their ship. As the crew observed the ice grinding and forming hummocks nearby, Mr. Dicey emphasized the value of firsthand experience over mere hearsay.

"The crew of the _Hope_ faced a perilous situation when their ship got stuck on an ice berg. Despite their efforts, the ice kept pushing in, straining the ship's timbers. With a loud crack, the brig was forced up the side of the berg, leaving it high and dry. The crew felt relief when the ice shifted, allowing the vessel to slide back into the water. However, their relief was short-lived as a strong breeze drove them into a pack of moving ice. To avoid further danger, Captain Harvey sought shelter near a large berg. Suddenly, a massive piece of ice, known as a ""calf,"" struck the ship, narrowly avoiding a catastrophe. As the wind changed, the _Hope_ was swept into the ice pack, its cables snapping.

The ship was stuck in a dangerous situation surrounded by ice. The crew was trapped until a stroke of luck freed them. As the ship passed a large iceberg, it hit a submerged part that split the ice holding them. Quick thinking by Captain Harvey saved the day. The crew managed to anchor the ship to the iceberg, finding a momentary safe haven. After this dramatic event, the ship continued its journey through icy waters, encountering whales, seals, and even bears. However, as winter approached, the sea began to freeze, signaling the crew that they needed to find a winter shelter. The ship was near the cliffs of Baffin's Bay, the farthest point of land known at that time. The crew faced the challenges of the Arctic as they navigated through the icy waters.|"[""1.

One cold afternoon just before sunset, the sailors on deck were trying to keep warm after dinner. The captain asked Davy where he was headed as he bundled up for what seemed like a long journey. As the sun disappeared, the sky filled with stars and the Aurora Borealis painted the night with green flashes. Davy, finishing his traps, marveled at the spectacle. Suddenly, a growl broke the peaceful scene. Davy swiftly readied his pistol as a white bear charged towards him. He ran, the bear in hot pursuit. Despite Davy's desperate attempt to defend himself, the bear continued its chase. The man's only hope was to reach the safety of the ship, far in the distance.|"['1.

Polar bears are known for their curiosity, even in the midst of a chase. Davy Butts, unaware of this, used his quick thinking to distract the bear. As the bear approached, Davy threw down his cap, mittens, cravat, and even his axe, but the bear swiftly destroyed each item. Desperate, Davy discarded his heavy fur-coat, intriguing the bear momentarily. With nothing left to shed, Davy ran towards safety in just his flannel shirt and trousers, looking comical with his lanky frame. Seeing Davy in danger, Sam Baker rushed to his aid with a handspike, but the bear stood its ground. Sam's blow shattered the handspike, and the bear prepared to attack until the first mate and Gregory arrived. Gregory took aim and with a single shot, the bear was defeated. The crew celebrated that evening, grateful for their victory over the Arctic's harsh conditions.|"['1.

Yesterday, Dawkins had a funny mishap that entertained everyone but didn't hurt him. Lately, we've been collecting moss from the island in big bundles. Dawkins asked to help, tired of always working indoors. While carrying moss near the fire-hole, he slipped and fell in. The hole is kept open for emergencies. Baker breaks the ice daily for fire safety. Dawkins, soaked and frozen, was saved by holding onto his moss bundle. His clothes froze solid, making it hard to move. After a challenging effort, he was rescued, undressed, dried, and dressed again. He was unharmed and maybe even felt better. Tomorrow, we plan to experiment with boats, sledges, and kites. The captain wants to take a boat south over the ice for emergencies. We might use kites to pull sledges, a suggestion from Davy Butts. Nights are getting longer, and soon we'll have no sun. The moon has been a comforting sight, circling the sky all day and night. Baker, Davy Butts, and Gregory went hunting walruses. They heard a loud bull walrus roar and found five of them in a hole in the ice. The walrus's roar is a mix of a bull's lowing and a dog's bark but much louder. They are as big as elephants and break the ice with their heads to get out of the sea.|['1.

The three men became cautious as they observed a bear-like figure approaching the walrus. They laid low, studying the native's stealthy approach. The Eskimo cleverly imitated the walrus's diving pattern, advancing closer to the hole undetected. When the walrus resurfaced, the Eskimo seized the moment, hurling his harpoon at the male walrus, successfully hooking it. The creatures, startled by the sudden attack, surfaced to inspect the intruder. This distraction allowed the Eskimo to secure the harpoon under the male's flipper. With a swift movement, he ran back, pulling the line taut. The men watched in awe as the Eskimo skillfully captured the walrus, demonstrating his deep understanding of the creatures' behavior.|"['1.

The intense battle in the Arctic between the Eskimo and the ferocious walruses was fierce. The walruses, with their massive heads and tusks, attacked the native who cleverly used his skills to outsmart them. The Eskimo played the walruses like an angler does with a trout, using a strong line made from walrus hide. The female walrus joined the fray, showing no fear but pure fury. The Eskimo's quick thinking and knowledge of the walruses' behavior saved him from their wrath. Two other Eskimos armed with lances joined the fight, wounding the walruses, making them even angrier. The Eskimos had to constantly move and adapt to survive the onslaught of these fierce creatures in the icy waters of the Arctic.|"[""1.

It might sound unbelievable, _but it's true_, that this battle lasted a full four hours. By the end of the third hour, the sailors were uncertain of the outcome. Gregory had a plan to surprise the Eskimos. As the male walrus neared death, Gregory shot the female to prevent her escape. Sam then skillfully harpooned her, while Davy held the bull. The Eskimos, startled by the turn of events, fled. Gregory, knowing Eskimo customs, signaled peace by raising his arms. The Eskimos reciprocated and approached, exchanging greetings. They were hearty, jolly men, smiling and talking. Unable to understand each other, they laughed and then hurried to the walrus.|"['1.

The Eskimos showed great skill in pulling the huge walrus out of the water. They made four cuts in the neck, creating two bands, and cleverly used a loop and a stick to create a double purchase system. This allowed them to lift the massive carcass out of the water with ease. The walrus, with its thick hide and long tusks, is a formidable creature, resembling a giant seal. Despite its awkward movements on land, it is perfectly suited for life in the water. The Eskimos rely on the walrus for survival in their icy environment, using its hide for hunting lines. They have adapted well to their harsh surroundings, finding contentment in a way of life that might seem challenging to others.|"['1.

Necessity drives innovation, as seen among the woodless Eskimos who craft sledges from bones due to the absence of trees. These resourceful natives ingeniously piece together walrus bones and tusks for their sledges. While driftwood is sporadically found, it is a rare commodity in their icy lands. The Eskimos rely on walrus meat for sustenance, with its coarse yet nutritious flesh sustaining them in the harsh Arctic conditions. They have a preference for raw walrus meat, finding it more fortifying for their demanding journeys. When the Eskimos shared their hunt's spoils with the sailors, a gesture of goodwill was reciprocated with gifts and a barter for dogs, a valuable asset in the Arctic. Through gestures and drawings in the snow, communication and understanding were achieved, fostering a bond between the two groups.|"['1.

Their initial encounter with the Eskimos ended joyfully. The crew of the _Hope_ was astonished and pleased that evening when the hunting party returned early, with cheers, howling dogs, and a sledge full of fresh meat. One day, Joe Davis, after a walrus hunt, stood on the deck conversing with Mr. Dicey about the icy landscape of Greenland. The entire region is covered with hard, never-melting snow, up to a thousand feet thick. This snow accumulates over ages, forming glaciers that flow down valleys. When these glaciers reach the sea, they break off into large icebergs. These icebergs, some as large as islands, float in the ocean. This natural process of glacier movement and iceberg formation is a fascinating aspect of Greenland's icy terrain.|"[""1.

"During the dark polar nights, the voyagers faced challenges as the ice closed in, leaving them with only polar bears for company. Fresh provisions ran low, and the men battled the onset of scurvy, weakened by the cold and dwindling spirits. To lift morale, they engaged in a game of fox on deck, running under the moon and stars. Laughter broke the gloom briefly, with even the unwell joining in.

The race continued with Sam Baker, Joe Davis, and Butts leading the way. Their comrades cheered them on, clapping and shouting words of encouragement. The captain, seeing the crew's spirits lifted, decided to organize a play to keep them entertained. Tom Gregory wrote a short play, Sam Baker played the role of an old lady, and Jim Crofts acted as a doctor. Meanwhile, the captain planned a risky journey to an Eskimo camp for fresh meat. With only a small supply of preserved food and their guns, they set off on a sled. The expedition was a success as they encountered a bear, and with precise shots, they secured meat for the crew.

Three men set to work. They cut off a bear's hind leg, secured the rest on a sledge, and fed the dogs. The captain bid farewell, took the bear to aid their scurvy-stricken friends, and disappeared among the icy hummocks. The narrator and Sam Baker found an old Eskimo hut nearby, repaired it, and settled in. They cooked a hearty meal of bear meat over a lamp, savored it, and drank melted snow-water. They blocked the door with snow, snuggled in bear-skins, and fell asleep quickly. The wind howled fiercely outside, and the cold was numbing. The narrator's fingers were stiff, and the gale prevented them from opening the door. With the captain unable to travel, they sought solace in rest, grateful for the respite after enduring harsh conditions.|"[""1.

On a cold Tuesday night, we finally arrived among the Eskimos. What a peculiar group they are! Covered in fat and fur, they appear as wide as they are tall. Their attire consists of short fox and seal-skin coats with hoods, no trousers, and long boots that meet the coats. Surprisingly, both women and men, along with babies, dress similarly, except for the women's longer and wider boots and the tails attached to the women's coats. These tails, resembling those of cows, are considered decorative, with women buttoning them up during journeys and letting them flow behind gracefully upon return. Our journey to the village was challenging, with struggles over hummocks and icy floes in bone-chilling cold. The beauty of the village, illuminated by a stunning aurora, and the unique snow huts resembling bee-hives left a lasting impression.|"['1.

The locals welcomed us with great surprise, and I recognized my old pals, the walrus-hunters, among them. They were very kind. One sturdy, middle-aged man welcomed us into his home. I am now inside sitting next to the Eskimo's wife, who would be attractive if she weren't so overweight, dirty, and greasy! But we can't expect people living in this way, in such a place, to be very clean. Despite the hut being white on the outside, it's not clean inside. They cook all their food over an oil-lamp, which also warms the place; and it's amazing how warm a snow house can be. The cold outside is so intense that it stops the walls from melting inside. Besides Myouk, our host, and his wife, there are two of the man's sisters, two boys, two girls, and a baby in the hut. Also, six dogs. All of them--men, women, children, and dogs, are plump because they've been successful in walrus hunting lately. No wonder sweat is dripping down my face! The locals also feel the heat, as they are all half-naked--the baby completely so; but they seem to enjoy it! What a lot of talking! I'm trying to take notes, and Myouk's wife is staring at me with her mouth wide open. It's a wonder she can even open her eyes, her cheeks are so chubby|"[""1.

Upon returning from the hunt, we entered Myouk's hut, a cramped space filled with fifteen people indulging in a hearty supper. The warmth inside prompted everyone to shed layers of clothing, revealing greasy hands clutching bear and walrus meat. Each face, be it man, woman, or child, gleamed with joy but was smudged with dirt and oil. Despite the uninviting conditions, hunger and exhaustion drove us to join in the feast. The natives ate heartily, some already asleep, others munching slowly. The heat and odor were overwhelming, causing us to strip down to a bare minimum. The scene was chaotic, with Sam in trousers only, myself in a similar state, and the captain using a baby as a pillow. Despite the discomfort, it was a fascinating glimpse into the daily life of these resilient individuals, who endure extremes of feast and famine, cold and heat, always maintaining a cheerful but unkempt demeanor.|"[""1.

It is unfortunate to consider the living conditions of the northern Eskimos, devoid of a religion worthy of the name. The challenges of introducing Christianity to this community are immense due to the harsh climate and circumstances. Missionaries would struggle to survive in such extreme conditions. The doctor, exhausted from contemplating these difficulties, decided to rest. He awoke the next morning to Captain Harvey's laughter, realizing it was already late. The villagers were bustling outside, preparing for the journey to Refuge Harbour. Oomia, carrying her baby in her fur-coat hood, joined them. The peculiar sight of the baby's tail amused the group, likening it to a kite. The expedition set off amid the bright stars and clear sky, with the villagers bidding them farewell.|"['1.

When Mr. Mansell took charge of the brig, he felt the weight of responsibility on his heart. While the crew busied themselves with preparing for a theatrical performance, Mr. Mansell knew that the captain's success in finding fresh meat was crucial for the crew's survival. Many were already suffering from scurvy, and time was running out. To everyone's surprise, an experiment was conducted on deck using a large kite attached to a sled. The kite's power propelled the sled over the snow at a rapid pace, leaving the crew amazed and excited. Despite a near mishap with an ice ridge, the experiment showed promise. Mr. Mansell decided to send a team, led by Mr. Dicey, on a journey over the ice to seek help.|"[""1.

Dicey, surprised, followed the instructions. Mansell, aided by Butts, readied the second kite for their journey. Estimating its pull, he loaded the sledge accordingly. Two ropes attached to the sledge's last bar for the men to hold and control its speed. An anchor and iron-clawed poles were prepared to scrape snow and slow down. The next day, after a successful trial, they bid farewell to their comrades and headed south towards the native village. The sledge's appearance amazed Captain Harvey and his companions. Upon their return to the Eskimo camp, they rested, loaded fresh meat, and traded with the natives for supplies. The wind not cooperating, they used native dogs to pull the sledge back to the brig, reaching it safely. Their visitors, Myouk, his family, and Meetek, were astonished by the brig, receiving gifts and making a good impression. The natives were caught stealing, hiding items in their belongings, showing no remorse for their actions.|"['1.

In the Arctic, we encountered a musk ox, a creature resembling a small cow with thick horns and long brown hair. Despite its musky smell, the meat was consumed eagerly by us and our dogs. Excitingly, we embarked on a bear hunt with Myouk and his son Meetek. Approaching fresh bear tracks, Myouk and his son armed with long lances bravely attacked the large polar bear. Witnessing their courage, I stood nearby with my rifle, ready to assist if needed. The bear, standing tall on its hind legs, emitted a fierce growl.

Christmas finally arrived, but there was no bright sun to remind the ice-bound men of our Saviour on that special day. In Refuge Harbour, it was darker than usual, with a fierce wind blowing snow-drifts around the ship. The intense cold felt like sheets of fire against their faces. Despite the harsh conditions, the crew's spirits were lifted by thoughts of home and the warmth of the season. They were determined to make the most of the day, even though they were far from loved ones. Inside the ship, they celebrated with a plum-pudding and walrus-beef roast. The captain emphasized the importance of discipline and completing their tasks before enjoying the festivities.

On Christmas-Day and New Year's Day, the sailors on the ship celebrated with games, a fancy ball, and a hearty dinner. The Eskimos ate till they could hardly stand, while the sailors toasted absent loved ones. The evening was filled with songs, stories, and dancing. As the days grew darker and food ran low, the men's spirits began to sink. The captain found the Eskimo village deserted, and the men struggled with scurvy. Private theatricals and a school were started to pass the time. The men learned writing and arithmetic, and despite the challenges, they found joy in the lessons. Hunting trips yielded little, and eventually, the men resorted to eating rats to survive, though not all were willing. Those who did eat the rats fared better in health.|"[""1.

At last, death arrived for Mr. Mansell. He succumbed to a severe illness and was laid to rest on the island. The frozen ground made it impossible to dig a grave, so his comrades held a burial service over his frozen body. The loss weighed heavily on the small group, already battling disease, darkness, and bitter cold. However, with the return of the sun, hope emerged. Young Gregory's journal noted the sun's first appearance since October, bringing a glimmer of cheer to the weary men. Despite their weakened state, they found solace in small victories like shooting a bear for food. As they awaited the thaw in June, they clung to the captain's optimism about finding open waters near the Pole.

On June 15th, the crew rejoiced as the ice began to break up in Refuge Harbour, allowing them to set sail north again. They had been surviving on a diet of walrus, seals, wild-fowl, and grasses to fight off scurvy. Despite the hardships endured during the winter, they were in good health and ready for hard work.
