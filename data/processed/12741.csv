Harry's wish to become a mechanic faced initial resistance. His father, Mr. Walton, hesitated as sending a boy out to earn a living is risky. However, the small farming town offered limited opportunities, pushing Harry to seek work elsewhere. He found a job in a shoe-shop, but faced setbacks. Losing his pocket-book to a dishonest colleague and a downturn in the shoe trade left him jobless. Fortunately, he met Professor Henderson, a magician, who offered him a job as an assistant. Despite it not being his ideal job, Harry accepted the offer. He proved to be a valuable employee and managed to pay off his father's debt and even thwart a highwayman, adding to his savings.

As the two boys sat by the fire, munching on popcorn and chatting, they quickly became better friends. Harry discovered that Oscar's father was a wealthy Boston merchant, dealing in the Calcutta trade, with an office on Long Wharf.

At the Academy building, the main school was bright with light on a Thursday evening. Boys aged thirteen to nineteen gathered for the Clionian Society's weekly meeting.

Harry began by explaining ambition as a desire for superiority, affecting most people differently based on their character. He then described a commendable ambition as a drive to excel in ways beneficial to humanity. Harry cited Franklin's rise to a high civil and scientific position, driven by honorable ambition. He also mentioned Columbus's ambition to expand geographical knowledge despite facing challenges. Harry urged boys and young men to channel their ambition positively, aiming to lead useful lives that contribute to society. Although Harry's essay lacked remarkable originality, it showcased his good judgment and principles guiding his life. It took him two evenings to write the essay, which spanned about five manuscript pages. Harry signed it under the pen name Franklin and secretly mailed it to avoid revealing his identity. His preoccupation with this literary venture was noted by his colleagues, with Clapp showing resentment due to his lack of purpose in life and his association with negative influences.|"[""1.
