Betty worked hard to help Mrs. Peabody look nice in her old-fashioned outfit, adding a touch of elegance with a gray-blue silk girdle.

After the visit, Mrs. Peabody felt relieved, knowing he wouldn't return for another six months due to his extensive parish. Betty stayed up late, waiting for her brother Bob, who arrived on horseback singing joyfully in the moonlight. Betty, concerned that Bob hadn't eaten, had sardines and crackers ready for him.

Mr. Peabody, unusually talkative that morning, forbade Bob from attending the Faulkner sale. Bob, accustomed to such punishments, mechanically tried to eat the unappetizing breakfast.

As they strolled, a clattering blackboard caught up with them, pulled by a thin white horse and steered by a cheerful farmer's wife who offered them a ride, which they gladly accepted. She was on her way to the Faulkner auction, eyeing three wooden wash tubs and seven yards of carpet. Betty relished the thrill of it all, trailing Bob to the front porch where household items were up for grabs. A friendly voice called out to them, revealing Doctor Guerin bidding on a secretary.

Bob waited for about 30 minutes after tying up the bundle. It was just a precaution since the Peabody family went to bed early, except for Mrs. Peabody, who slept deeply. He quietly went downstairs, unlocked the front door, which was usually left open, and went to the bush where his tin box was buried.

Bob found the box easily, hid his digging traces, and whistled softly at Betty's window. She wished him luck and asked him to wait for her in Washington.

The woman sighed, understanding the situation well. She expressed how she would miss the company of Betty, who had been a great companion during the summer. Mrs. Peabody suddenly remembered that Joseph wanted to speak with Betty. Betty followed Mrs. Peabody downstairs to find Joseph impatiently waiting. He inquired about a gray alpaca coat from which a letter fell out earlier. Joseph asked if Betty had seen any other papers with it, suspecting that they might have been hidden. Betty denied seeing any other papers, causing Joseph to suspect Bob Henderson, a runaway, of taking an important unrecorded deed from the coat. Joseph vowed not to pay Bob and decided to confront him in Washington to retrieve the deed.|['1.

Betty defended Bob with determination. She refused to believe the accusations against him. Peabody suspected Bob of stealing a valuable deed, but Betty stood firm in her belief in Bob's integrity.

"""I understand what he's thinking,"" she mentioned flatly. ""I know more than I would like to, Betty. Joseph has purchased the Warren lots, and that implies he's obtained them for his own terms. Old man Warren is elderly, and these lots have been divided into building plots on the stone road across Laurel Grove where the trolley's arriving this spring. Joseph will likely sell them for thrice what he paid. That's why he hasn't registered the deed; Warren's children will find out, and I doubt the sale would stand in court. Everyone knows the old man isn't capable of managing his property. There were talks of appointing one of the sons as his guardian some time ago. Joseph has convinced him to sell. If he wasn't my husband, I'd say it's a clear scam.""

""No, he couldn't claim the lots,"" acknowledged Joseph Peabody's wife. ""But he could keep the deed and threaten to inform George Warren if Joseph didn't pay him a hefty sum. I'm not saying he would, Betty, but he could. That's what Joseph thinks he might do.""

The newspaper reported the discovery of illness among gypsies near Pineville, diagnosed as smallpox, leading to a strict quarantine. Betty, worried about being delayed, decided to change her travel plans to Washington via Glenside. She kept this secret from the Peabodys to avoid suspicion. The next morning, she packed her bag and prepared to leave without much sentiment for her surroundings. Unexpectedly, Mr. Peabody joined her trip to Hagar's Corners, disrupting her plans to catch the train to Washington. Despite feeling frustrated, Betty had to accept the situation as Fred, unsure how to react, complied with his father's request.

Betty Gordon, tall and slender, was described as resembling an Indian princess. As the night grew late, Mr. Littell suggested the girls get some rest. The girls were accommodated in three bedrooms, with separate beds to avoid confusion. Betty Gordon felt hesitant about staying and planned to speak to Mr. Littell in the morning to ensure it was acceptable to stay with the Littell family.|"['1.

Betty wanted to send a telegram to her uncle. Her family decided to help her, knowing it might take as long as a letter to reach him in the oil regions. They sent the message and planned to write a letter too. After handling the logistics at the station, they headed towards the Monument, a gleaming structure visible from all over the city. Betty, feeling relieved after sending the telegram, immersed herself in the beauty of the city. Despite the long line at the Monument, the girls patiently waited to go inside. As they ascended in the elevator, they were advised to watch the interesting sights on each floor they passed.

Betty struggled to look back in the crowded car, trying to spot the bride who was visibly upset. The bride, a young and stylish woman, seemed no more than twenty years old. Bobby warned Betty not to walk down the stairs, sharing his own experience of being bedridden for two days after attempting it. Instead, they decided to explore the sights together until the bride's husband would come up. Betty was curious about the bride's connection to an old bookstore owner who had shown interest in a friend's past. The group lingered to catch a glimpse of the bridegroom, described as a good-looking young man. Betty hoped he could provide information about the bookstore.

Mr. Hale and his wife kindly gave Betty their address on a new visiting card. Betty, grateful, quickly wrote her own cards before heading to a movie with friends. Later, she excitedly planned to search for Bob Henderson in Washington, feeling hopeful. After a delightful lunch, they shopped and then enjoyed a movie due to the rain. Libbie's humorous comment about brides and grooms made everyone laugh. Mr. Littell mentioned a bookshop owned by a Hale in Washington, offering to take Betty there the next day.

Betty was relieved to hear that Bob had found the old bookseller and learned valuable information. However, she was growing increasingly worried as her uncle had not responded to her telegram.

Bobby, known for his honesty and love for his younger cousin, suggested playing one last game before the family hinted he was too old for their playful antics. They decided to play in the attic, making as much noise as possible. Libbie shared a story about a bride who hid in a chest with a spring lock during her wedding and was never found. Bobby found the story gruesome, questioning the housecleaning of those days. The girls then played hide-and-seek in the attic, with Betty cleverly hiding in a built-in box.

That ended the game for the day, and the rest of the afternoon the girls were content to spend quietly.

Betty and her friend Libbie had a memorable day at the Capitol. They marveled at the colossal bronze doors, each standing nineteen feet tall and weighing ten tons. Betty was particularly captivated by the intricately designed eight panels, losing track of time until her friends threatened to leave her overnight. Reluctantly, she joined them on a tour of the three buildings, but the historical paintings once again mesmerized her.

Mr. Littell, in his calm and matter-of-fact manner, comforted the distressed girl by explaining that her uncle was likely on an oil exploration trip, possibly returning to a backlog of mail. He pointed out how in more remote areas, like where sailors often go, people can go weeks without mail. The group, including the four girls and Mrs. Littell, set out to visit the White House. They explored various rooms, including the East Room and the state dining-room, imagining the historical events that took place there. After a pleasant lunch, the girls had the afternoon free.

Bob declined Mrs. Littell's invitation for that night but promised to visit the following Saturday. Mrs. Littell, impressed by Bob, arranged for the girls to give Betty a riding lesson.

A large group had gathered on each level upon hearing the screams, rushing downstairs to be near the stalled elevator. They clustered around the gate on the third floor, while others from the street crowded around the shaft on the second floor upon learning of the accident. It was communicated that no one was injured, but a means of escape from the brass cage was needed. Suggestions were made, but most were impractical, causing tension among the passengers. Eventually, the idea of breaking out with an axe gained support until a woman's hysterics halted the plan. Pat Kelly, the friendly building engineer, attempted to fix the elevator machinery with loud hammering, prompting a call to the fire department for help and water for the stranded passengers.|"['1.

Half of the crowd waiting scattered to call the fire department, and the other half rushed to the water coolers. Their enthusiasm surpassed their judgment, resulting in a stream of icy water pouring into the car. The crash of the water cooler against the car interrupted the assurance of the person holding it. A chorus of shrieks arose from those inside. Bob helped the girls onto the seat, as the floor was soaked.

The group, relieved that no harm had come from the incident, made their way down the stairs. Two vigilant young individuals questioned each person to gather accounts from those in the stalled elevator. The operator had already provided enough material for an exciting newspaper article. Mr. Derby guided the girls and Bob to his office discreetly, contemplating how to exit the building. With the elevator out of order and the corridors still bustling, a quick departure was not feasible. Mr. Derby suggested using the fire escape to reach the street, but the girls were unfazed by the idea. As they chatted about the event, a sudden shock gripped them all.

Betty and her companions were mistaken for the police, but they were actually reporters seeking an interview. Betty explained how they had entered through a window after coming down a fire escape from the fourth floor. However, they soon realized there was an easier way out through a folding flight of steps to the ground. Bob, feeling unlucky for choosing an office with gold dust, struggled with the telephone while Mr. Matthews, amused by the situation, explained that Monsieur Brissot, a Belgian diamond cutter, was overly suspicious.
