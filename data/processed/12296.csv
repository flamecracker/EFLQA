"The American Museum of Natural History plans to explore the vast plateau of Central Asia, believed to be the origin of early human migrations. The region's role in the dispersal of mammalian life globally is significant. Despite the challenges posed by the terrain, climate, and local populations, the museum aims to conduct extensive scientific research in the area. The first step involves preliminary expeditions to understand the native fauna and conditions. The Asiatic Zoölogical Expedition, including Edmund Heller, Yvette Borup Andrews, and Roy Chapman Andrews, set out for Yün-nan, a province in southwestern China. Yün-nan's diverse climate and topography make it a unique research destination. The province is home to various non-Chinese tribes, each with distinct languages and dialects.

Mrs. Andrews, the Expedition's photographer, honed her skills in photography across Europe and New York, specializing in natural color photos, a meticulous yet rewarding craft. Wu Hung-tao, from Foochow, China, was our interpreter and field manager, fluent in Mandarin and local dialects. I oversaw the Expedition and big game hunting. To cut costs, we bought gear in New York that was scarce in Shanghai or Hong Kong. Shoverling, Daly & Gales provided guns, tents, and camp gear, impressing with their attention to detail. Our food came from Hong Kong. The Expedition's announcement sparked interest worldwide, drawing amusing applications from diverse characters. Arriving in Yokohama, we encountered Japanese journalists eager for animal insights. Japan's cherry blossom season captivated us, a visual feast for a color photography enthusiast.

Yuan was a clever leader who managed to win over many generals and became the president of the new republic in 1911 after the overthrow of the Manchu dynasty. He didn't truly believe in a republican government but used it as a stepping stone to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming emperor. Despite ruling with a firm hand and facing rebellions, he could have easily declared himself emperor but chose to wait and plan cautiously. Japan interfered with his plans by presenting demands to China during World War I. Eventually, Yuan accepted the throne in 1916 but faced immediate unrest. Provinces began to secede, and rebellion spread rapidly. Despite warnings, a group still planned to travel to the area, hoping Yuan would quell the rebellion. However, Yuan eventually canceled the monarchy and restored the republic due to mounting pressure from rebellious provinces.|"[""1.

"We had reassuring telegrams from Mr. C. R. Kellogg of the Anglo-Chinese College in Foochow, guaranteeing peace in the province. Dr. Reinsch secured validation for our passports from the Chinese Foreign Office, marked with a comical mix of seals. The seal of the Hung-Hsien dynasty, meaning ""Brilliant Prosperity,"" was followed by the stamp of the Chinese Republic. At a luncheon in Peking, we met Admiral von Hintze, the German Minister, who had voyaged from Germany to China. Amidst international tensions, social interactions were limited. Peking's cosmopolitan community buzzed with talk of horses, polo, and politics. We journeyed to Shanghai, passing through Tsinan-fu where Japanese soldiers clashed with Yuan's troops. In Shanghai, political unrest loomed, with wealthy Chinese seeking refuge in the foreign concession. Yuan's illness and passing marked a turbulent period in China's history, with his last words reflecting a desire to save face."|"['1. What did Mr. C. R.

In the temporary residence of President Li Yuan-hung, the formal transfer of power took place this morning. The ceremony included officials like Secretary of State Yuan Chi-jui and Prince Pu Lun. They wore ceremonial dress and made respectful bows to the new president. A similar ceremony will occur later in the day with military officials. This marked the end of Yuan Shi-kai's attempt to become emperor, leaving behind political chaos. Upon arrival at Foochow, the chaos continued as coolies fought over luggage, illustrating the Chinese habit of yelling to communicate. Despite the confusion, a customs officer helped arrange sedan chairs and porters to transport the visitors. The city of Foochow was described as filthy and medieval, with narrow, roofed-over streets filled with industrial activities and odors.|"[""1.

"The foreign residents, like consuls, missionaries, and merchants, live outside the city on a hill. Their homes have high ceilings and simple interiors. They rarely visit the city and use sedan chairs. They have ""punkahs"" to keep cool in summer. A telegram from Reverend Harry Caldwell asked us to his station 200 miles away. We packed while Mr. Kellogg searched for an English-speaking cook. We found a Chinese cook who stuttered, making us laugh. He once proudly showed beef, saying it wasn't from a sick cow. We started our journey at dawn in sedan chairs, followed by coolies carrying our gear. We passed green rice fields and old temples. A launch to Cui-kau was advised against due to overcrowding. The Min River was beautiful, with green mountains and boat life. We reached Cui-kau at night, where we boarded _sampans_ for an eight-day journey."|['1.

Our sleeping arrangements were in the boats called _sampans_, shared with the four river workers who formed the crew. A mosquito net was the only barrier at the boat's end, but the peculiar surroundings made it seem insignificant. Lying in our beds, we could gaze at the stars through the boat's roof and hear the river sounds fade as the crew anchored the boats for the night. Morning came abruptly as we approached the rapids toward Yen-ping. Upon reaching Chang-hu-fan, Mr. Caldwell greeted us amidst a lively welcome with firecrackers. The night was spent in a cramped townhouse with curious onlookers outside. The uncomfortable night led us to vow to sleep in the _sampans_ instead. The river workers were amiable but preferred crowded places. The journey continued to Yuchi, adding an encounter with a mythic tiger and meeting a missionary residing in isolation.|"['1.

"When we arrived at Yuchi, the conditions were very unsettled. There was a ""reign of terror"" due to a large group of bandits in the nearby hills. The soldiers sent to deal with them actually made things worse by arresting innocent people and executing them without trials. Yuchi had become unsafe, so we left for Yen-ping, a beautiful old city with high stone walls. The weather in Yen-ping was extreme, with unbearable heat in summer and damp cold in winter. The forests in Fukien had been cut down, driving out most of the wildlife. We tried trapping animals around Yen-ping, but they were often stolen along with the traps. The natives in the region were known for being skilled thieves. We visited a Taoist temple in a ravine, where we enjoyed the sounds of bamboo chickens and francolins. The walk to the temple was pleasant, with the birds calling around us."|"['1.

About a mile from the entrance, two ancient temples are nestled into the hillside. One temple sits by the water, while the other clings to the rock wall, 300 feet above the river, where our camp was set up. The old priest seemed uninterested until I gave him a Mexican dollar, then his attitude changed. We were in Chi-yuen-kang to hunt serow and had brought only a few traps. We gathered villagers and dogs to drive the mountain. The climb was challenging, delayed by the villagers' habits. When we finally ascended, the dogs found a fresh trail. Harry made a remarkable shot, bagging a muntjac, a small deer unique to Fukien. Despite fresh serow tracks, the day ended disappointingly as the villagers failed to drive the animals towards us.|"['1.

We worked hard to hunt for serow, but it was challenging due to the time of year. The natives shared that in September, when mushrooms are plentiful in the lower forests, the serow descend from the mountain tops to feed. They could be hunted without beaters during this time, but overall, it required a lot of effort with only a moderate chance of success. Despite the challenges, we found a fascinating bat cave near our temple. The cave teemed with bats of various species, living together in separate rooms within the corridors. We used bamboo switches initially to catch the bats, later switching to a gill net from New York for a more effective capture method. The bats' agility in flight made it a challenging yet rewarding experience to collect specimens.|['1.

After a discussion with Dr. Trimble and Mr. Bankhardt, we all agreed that it's best for you to come in right away. I'm sending four helpers since it will be impossible to find any tomorrow if there's trouble tonight. The city gates are shut, so you'll need to climb the ladder over the wall behind our place. Good luck. The camp was chaotic as Da-Ming, the cook, and the helpers chattered loudly. Servants quickly packed while we ate roast chicken with our hands, excited for the upcoming adventure. Within an hour of Harry's message, we set off to Yen-ping. Despite the scorching heat, we left the cool ravine, crossed the valley, and rested at a stop. We encountered weary women with bound feet carrying heavy loads, seeking refuge from the soldiers. As we climbed, we saw temples crowded with refugees. By evening, we scaled the compound wall, overhearing tales of rebellion in the city.|"['1.

We gathered for a picnic dinner on the Caldwell's porch and discussed the situation. Everyone agreed that the foreigners were not immediately threatened, but we decided it was wise to be prepared. We assigned posts to each man in case we needed to defend the compound. Many people besieged the missionaries to seek refuge inside the walls with their families and goods, but we had to decline. Allowing them in would forfeit our Consular protection and make us vulnerable to looting attacks. The next day, gunfire erupted in the city, prompting us to investigate. At the mission hospital, we learned that the rebels from Yuchi were actually bandits, and the Hunan soldiers cleverly quashed the rebellion to prevent further conflict. We assisted the wounded, witnessing the grim aftermath of the battle.|"['1.

The poor water-carrier, curious about the city wall view, fell victim to the firing. His wife, too poor to hire help, couldn't take him to the hospital. Hospital staff intervened, carrying him uphill, followed by a weeping wife and onlookers. Despite questions, some locals understood the act as a gesture of love. This act of kindness taught a lesson in compassion. The journey continued to check on wounded men, discovering a brigand left to die. Soldiers guarded the gates, revealing a grim scene of death. The group then headed to the official residence, witnessing soldiers' actions. As they returned, troops approached the city gates, leading to sudden gunfire. The situation escalated, with troops firing at each other due to mistaken identities, prompting a plea for help from the missionaries.

The missionaries acted as peacemakers and saved the _tao-tai_, preventing a potential slaughter through their understanding of Chinese culture. The next day, twenty brigands were beheaded after a trial, closing the incident peacefully. A Christian man found brigands hiding in his house, narrowly avoiding trouble with soldiers. A Chinese teacher and a mission school cook were arrested unjustly but were released after the missionaries intervened. The missionaries faced challenges during a rebellion, needing American flags on their boats to avoid being targeted by soldiers.

Mr. Caldwell, before his time in Yen-ping, worked in Futsing, close to Foochow. His job involved visiting mission stations on foot with a butterfly net and rifle. The region was home to man-eating tigers, often prompting villagers to seek his help. Over ten years, he took down seven tigers, seeing his gun as a tool for spreading Christianity. Tiger hunting was unpredictable; they lurked in ravines with dense vegetation. Caldwell's tactic involved goats as bait, leading to a successful first hunt near Lung-tao. Despite the danger, tigers were cautious and would retreat if conditions weren't favorable. The thrill of the hunt lay in the tiger's elusive nature and the need for strategy to outwit them.|"[""1.

In April 1910, I encountered a tiger in a ravine while leading a goat, hoping to lure the tiger out. The cautious tiger had recently attacked cows, showing both daring strategy and cowardice. Another time, the tiger ambushed a farmer's cow while the farmer ate, displaying its ability to strike from the rear. Tigers can be daring when circumstances favor them. They show strength by dragging a man and killing villagers gathering fuel. Tigers can swiftly kill their prey and flee. One tiger jumped from a roof to kill a cow and its calf. Another tiger carried off a hog but abandoned it when pursued by villagers. Tigers showcase a mix of courage and fear, making them formidable predators in the wild.|"['1.

I sat quietly for over two hours, alert and still, hidden behind a screen of ferns and grass. The only sounds were the goats' bleats and the mountain jay's harsh calls. Just when I thought all hope was lost, the man-eater's massive head emerged where I anticipated, only fifteen feet from the kids. With confidence in my gun, I fired, and the beast fell without a second shot. Villagers rushed in, eager to collect the tiger's blood, believed to have protective qualities against measles and smallpox. The tiger's flesh is even consumed for similar reasons. The tiger's bones are boiled and believed to be potent medicine. Despite the risks, investigating a tiger's lair yields valuable insights, like the diverse prey it consumes and the medicinal value attributed to various parts of the tiger.|"['1.

"In the wild, tigers leave their mark on trees near their lairs by clawing through the bark. These markings not only signal the presence of a tiger but also give clues about its size. Trails leading to lairs are marked differently, with grass raked away and piled up by the tiger's paw. A river journey from Foochow to hunt the elusive ""blue tiger"" at Futsing turned out to be a luxurious surprise aboard a chartered houseboat. The crew ensured a comfortable voyage, complete with a central cabin and staterooms. The night was spent discussing the blue tiger under the stars.

Tigers are often wary of human voices, so instead of shooting, I emerged from the bushes yelling and waving my arms. The large cat, poised to pounce, hesitated, then slowly slinked away into the grass. The boys were safe, but I missed the chance I had sought for a year. Yet, I had another encounter with the animal, known for its strikingly beautiful markings. Its coat was a delicate maltese hue, fading to light gray-blue underneath, with well-defined stripes like a typical yellow tiger. Before leaving New York, Mr. Caldwell urged me to join him in Futsing to hunt the elusive blue tiger, which I believed was a melanistic phase of the yellow tiger. Despite a five-week hunt in Lung-tao, the blue tiger remained elusive, evading our attempts.|"['1.

Caldwell sat quietly, his rifle ready. We waited, hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive blue tiger. Suddenly, the grass rustled, but it was not the tiger. Three woodcutters appeared, scaring the tiger back into its lair. Disappointed, we decided to explore the tiger's den. Crawling through narrow passages, we were on edge, fearing the tiger's return. Eventually, we emerged, relieved but shaken. Despite our efforts, the tiger remained elusive, slipping away each time. Another day, the tiger stole a dog and outwitted our trap, showing its cunning nature. Later, we set a trap near a village where the tiger was spotted, but it eluded us in the darkness.

"After a series of letdowns, Mr. Heller and Mr. Kellogg joined us at Bui-tao. Caldwell decided to move our camp to the Ling-suik monastery, about twelve miles away. This area was within the blue tiger's territory and offered better opportunities for collecting. Heller was in charge of small mammals, and we hoped to make our time count if we didn't encounter the tiger.

Ling-suik, a stunning temple built into a hillside, provided us with a picturesque setting. Despite the extreme heat and frequent rain, we set up camp on the porch of the highest building.

Much work remains to be done in studying the reptiles and amphibians of the region, especially in the field of herpetology. The natives are willing to help in these efforts, making it a worthwhile investigation. The language spoken in Fukien can be challenging, with the Foochow dialect being particularly difficult to learn and spoken only within a limited area. Travel in Fukien can be tough due to reliance on coolies for transport, leading to delays and uncertainties in reaching destinations. Despite the difficulties, servants are affordable and usually competent. Leaving Fukien was bittersweet, as the expedition continued to Yün-nan. The missionaries' efforts in establishing schools for native girls in Foochow and Yen-ping were commendable, contributing to the development of the people. The role of women in Chinese society, influenced by Confucianism, has started to evolve with the opening of schools like the Woman's College in Foochow.|['1.

In ancient Chinese culture, a bride had to obey her mother-in-law strictly, often living with her husband's family from a young age, enduring misery under the mother-in-law's control. A girl's worth was often disregarded until she bore a son, improving her status only when she became a mother-in-law herself. Chinese women faced dreary lives, confined by bound feet, limited to their courtyards, and rarely venturing far from home. The abominable practice of foot binding, dating back a thousand years, persisted despite efforts to end it. The suffering endured by girls during foot binding was severe, with their only relief being to numb their feet. The cruel custom affected rich and poor alike, hindering China's progress as a nation. Emancipating women from such practices and subjugation required education and reform within Chinese society.|"['1.

In Yün-nan, where bandits roamed, we anticipated resistance for our journey into the heart of the region. Surprisingly, no opposition arose.

The sun is scorching at mid-day, but the mornings and evenings are chilly. Tonight, we plan to set up a sweet-smelling fire using yellow pine and chat before bed on the porch, watching the moon rise and the stars twinkle like tiny lanterns in the sky. We've been journeying for a week since leaving Yün-nan Fu, stopping at serene temples like this each night. These temples have an indescribable allure, nestled among trees with majestic porches and charming gables pointing towards the sky. Sometimes, they're in bustling towns where we pass through crowded, dirty streets before reaching the temple gates, transporting us to a tranquil realm. Every morning, the boys are up before dawn, preparing breakfast as we pack up for the day's journey. The roads are rough, with uneven stones and steep slopes, but the breathtaking views from the ridges make the arduous climb worthwhile, despite the challenging terrain. The mist-covered peaks and deforested mountains we traverse highlight the consequences of neglecting conservation, a stark reminder of the importance of preserving nature.|"['1.

The Chinese scholar was amazed by Western knowledge that most Western children learn before they turn twelve. However, in Confucian teachings, modern science is seen as a waste of time. The scholar spent his life studying the past, neglecting the present. The valleys were green with rice fields, but deforestation led to a lack of animal life. Traps set at night caught few mammals, except red-bellied squirrels and tree shrews. These tree shrews resemble squirrels but are unrelated. Although birds were abundant, the species were not varied. In Yün-nan, Chinese villages were filthy, with pigs, chickens, horses, and cows living with people. Opium cultivation was prohibited, and China successfully replaced poppy fields with corn. The province of Yün-nan has made efforts to combat opium cultivation, unlike neighboring Burma, where opium is grown freely and smuggled into Yün-nan.|['1.

"During our journey through Tonking and Shanghai, we managed to safely land sixty cases with the help of some favors. However, the boxes were later seized due to opium smuggling, despite denials from officials. As we approached Ta-li Fu, we noticed a high prevalence of goitre among the locals, possibly linked to the drinking water in limestone regions. We also observed the use of ""mountain schooners"" by the Chinese, where a person is carried in a chair by coolies up hills. The Chinese have a preference for riding rather than walking, with haste and physical exertion being frowned upon.

On our ninth day from Yün-nan Fu, we had an unexpected event. While climbing a mountain trail near an eight-thousand-foot pass, a boy rushed to us in a panic, speaking rapidly in Chinese. It took us a while to understand that bandits had attacked a caravan close by, ransacking the goods. The first boy said there were 250 bandits and two dead, while a second person claimed 350 bandits and five dead. After some investigation, we found out there were only 40 bandits and no casualties. Our caravan, ill-equipped for defense, armed ourselves and sought refuge in a nearby village. The robbed caravan had valuable items stolen, and we learned that brigands, a result of the rebellion, made traveling in the region unsafe. Despite the risks, we continued our journey cautiously, paying our staff in advance and being accompanied by armed but somewhat comical soldiers provided by the Foreign Office.|"['1.

We were very careful to respect the land where we camped and to treat the locals fairly. However, it was hard to stop the soldiers from damaging property for firewood. When such incidents occurred, we compensated for the damage and penalized the wrongdoers by deducting from their pay. It is crucial for foreigners to respect the rights of the villagers, as their behavior sets the tone for future interactions. On Friday, September 28, we stayed at Chou Chou in a charming temple on the town's edge. After filming our journey, we left for Ta-li at eleven-thirty. By two o'clock, we arrived at Hsia-kuan, a bustling town near the lake. The day was scorching, but the evening brought relief as we rode towards Ta-li, with the sun setting behind the mountains. Upon reaching the city, we were greeted by ancient pagodas and the warm hospitality of Mr. Evans, who aided us during our stay.

In a town near Ta-li Fu, our caravan with Wu and Heller encountered a peculiar incident. Wu's horse refused to move forward after he stopped to buy mushrooms, causing a commotion. As we tried to resolve the situation, our horses ended up packed tightly together, making it impossible to dismount. We were stuck until a mafu came to our rescue, leading Wu's horse forward and restoring order. The cook we had hired at Paik-hoi, although a good cook, struggled with camp life due to his lack of experience with horses. He eventually fell ill but recovered after some persuasion. Losing a cook can greatly impact an expedition, but we were fortunate to find a competent replacement in Li-chiang Fu.

In Li-chiang, our expedition was a grand success. The town was bustling with life, and we stumbled upon three foreign ladies dressed in traditional Chinese attire. They were overjoyed to see a white woman, as they hadn't encountered one in four years. They welcomed us warmly and guided us to a beautiful temple atop a hill overlooking the city. The temple priest, a sly man, brought us various animal skins hidden under his coat. Our fame spread quickly, and locals brought us an array of creatures, from frogs to rats, even offering to sell us pets and children. Our trapping efforts were fruitful, yielding a variety of small mammals. However, we faced challenges as the natives would steal our traps, sometimes even trying to sell us animals caught in our own traps.

"Small mammals are often more scientifically significant than large ones, particularly among Insectivores, as they reveal primitive forms that shed light on evolutionary history. Li-chiang serves as a bustling fur market where Tibetans bring skins for sale. The city is diverse, with many tribes represented, notably the Mosos who have a semi-Tibetan lifestyle. The Mosos, once rulers of northern Yün-nan, are considered ""barbarians"" by the Chinese but are found to be honest and charming. They rear sheep and cattle, providing fresh milk and butter, essential for their buttered tea and _tsamba_ diet.

Shortly after setting up our camp, an Austrian botanist named Baron Haendel-Mazzetti paid us a visit. He had been in the nearby village for two weeks and had initially come to Yün-nan on a scientific mission. Due to the war, he had been living in the region for three years, surrounded by Tibet, Burma, and Tonking. He had limited resources and had been surviving on Chinese cuisine. We shared a meal with him, and his appreciation for our coffee, bread, and canned goods was evident. A week later, the Baron departed for Yün-nan Fu and eventually Shanghai, which became inaccessible due to the war. We hope that his valuable scientific collections have reached a safe location. Additionally, we hired four Moso hunters from the Snow Mountain village, each armed with unique weapons, including a gun from Tibet and crossbows with poisoned arrows. These skilled hunters relied on their dogs to corner game in the mountains. The dogs, although not affectionate, were well cared for by their owners, unlike the diseased strays found in Chinese villages.|['1.

On our temple expedition, Heller ventured up Snow Mountain, spotting a unique porcupine. Unlike American tree porcupines, this one belonged to the _Hystrix_ genus found in Asia, Africa, and southern Europe, living in burrows. During big game hunts, our dogs often trailed these porcupines, leading to chaotic scenes with the hounds yelping around burrows instead of cornering a goral. The porcupine's long, sharp quills could fend off entire dog packs, posing a threat to the hunters' companions. The locals shared insights on small mammals, bats, toads, and frogs in the region. The team explored the mountain, discovering a pristine campsite near a snow-field. Despite the high altitude challenges, the group found a hidden water source, securing a perfect camp spot for their expedition.|"['1.

As the sun set behind the mountain, casting a shadow over the meadow, we found ourselves on our way back home. By five o'clock, we were at the temple having a late lunch and getting ready for an early start. Unfortunately, three mules had wandered off in the morning, delaying our return to the meadow until the afternoon. Our camp was set up near the spruce forest at the edge of the snow stream. After pitching the tents, we climbed to the grassy slope above the timber line with Heller to set traps for voles in the forest. The hunters, on the other hand, camped close by without any shelter. Despite the freezing nights, they seemed unfazed. That night, as we dined by the campfire, surrounded by darkness, we felt the presence of the towering peaks around us. The next morning, despite the rain, I joined the hunters in pursuit of goral. The hunt was intense, culminating in a successful shot that brought down the largest ram of our trip. The hunters performed a ceremonial ritual to honor the God of the Hunt, showcasing their respect for nature.|['1.

"After every dog had a taste of the goral's blood, we climbed the cliff at the meadow's end. Nearly 2,000 feet above camp, clouds enveloped us. We waited for the fog to clear. An hour later, the fog lifted, and the men directed the hounds towards a talus slope. The red dog picked up a trail, followed by the pack. We hurried across the rocky terrain, but the dogs vanished around a sharp pinnacle. The goral ran down the valley, losing the dogs in a wooded ravine. Returning to camp, Heller had a successful trap haul. Yvette and I found various small mammals. Wu, the interpreter, confused ""shrew"" with a ""cantankerous woman."" Heller later saw two gorals, but no shots were fired. We spent a pleasant evening, avoiding war talk. The next morning, we set out early with the hunters, climbing steadily to the mountain's side.

The dogs quickly found the man lying on the shelf before we arrived. He was a large ram, almost as big as the first one I had hunted. Wanting to give the dogs a break, we decided to head back to camp with the others. On the way, a second goral was spotted, but it evaded us. The sky above was clear, but clouds covered the meadow below, hiding our camp. The view of the snow-capped mountains in the distance was breathtaking. The gorals were well-hidden against the rocks due to their color, making it challenging to hunt them. Despite the difficulties, we managed to collect valuable specimens for the Museum. The preparation of the habitat group required meticulous planning and detailed work.

We slowly climbed towards the cliffs, high above the clouds covering the camp. As we rested, the red dog barked, signaling the approach of a pack. The clouds drifted upwards, shrouding the gorge. The dogs' yelps grew nearer as the mist enveloped us. The goral leaped down the cliff, evading us. Disappointed, we hurried down the mountain, hoping to intercept the goral. A hunter spotted one running towards us. Hotenfa fired at a goral, missing narrowly. Another goral fled into the forest. The red dog's frantic barks alerted us to a goral's approach. Hotenfa swiftly leaped towards the ram, perched on a ledge below. I fired, and the majestic animal plummeted six hundred feet below.|"[""1.

Hotenfa and I were hunting when we spotted a goral. Hotenfa was so thrilled that he hugged me tightly, celebrating our successful shot. In all the excitement, I quickly realized that we had both fired at the same time but didn't hear each other's shots. Hotenfa had mistakenly fired buckshot, while my bullet had killed the goral. Despite knowing the truth, I didn't want to spoil his joy. After a challenging climb to reach the fallen goral, we rested and continued our hunt. Hotenfa then shot at a female goral, breaking her leg, but she managed to escape. I took the final shot, bringing her down.

Despite my illness, the expedition's work did not halt. Mr. Heller energetically continued collecting small mammals. The day after reaching the temple, we enlisted eight skilled native hunters from the wandering Lolos tribe in S'suchuan. They proved to be exceptional. The first serow was taken down by Hotenfa's team on the third day. Heller joined the hunters but returned alone shortly after. The dogs chased a huge serow for three miles until they cornered it against a cliff, resulting in a fierce fight. Unfortunately, one dog perished, and another was injured. The serow was brought in late that night, but our joy was overshadowed by the loss of the red dog. The next day marked the beginning of continuous rain, hindering hunting. Despite the weather, the Lolos returned on the fifth day with a fine male serow showcasing a unique color variation. The chapter ahead will delve deeper into the habits of gorals and serows.|"[""1.

The Lolos are a tall race with fair complexions and straight features, hinting at a blend of Mongolian ancestry. They are closely linked to the eastern Tibetans, who are slightly taller. The Lolos are predominantly hill dwellers in Yün-nan and are one of the most numerous non-Chinese tribes in the region. Due to prolonged contact with the Chinese, many Lolos are assimilating into Chinese culture, abandoning their language and customs. Despite their amiable nature, they are fiercely independent, preferring to hunt alone. The Lolos are just one of the many non-Chinese tribes in Yün-nan, showcasing the diverse ethnic landscape of western China. The challenging terrain has led to the development of various languages and customs among these tribes. The Gorals and serows, belonging to the _Rupicaprinæ_ subfamily, are mountain-dwelling animals with distinctive ridged horns, bridging the gap between goats and antelopes.|['1.

"The main difference between gorals and serows, aside from their size, is that serows have a short tail and a well-developed face gland opening in front of their eyes, while gorals have a long tail and lack this gland. In terms of horn shape, serows resemble some antelopes but have a build more akin to goats with heavy limbs and stout hoofs. Serows have long faces and enormous ears, leading to them being called ""wild donkey"" in Fukien and ""wild cow"" in Yün-nan. The specific relationships among serows are not entirely clear, with different color variations seen in Chinese, Indian, and Malayan forms. The study of serows by Mr. Pocock suggests they are all races of the species Capricornis sumatrensis. Individual variations in leg color have been observed, highlighting the need for extensive specimen collection for accurate study. Serows are found in Asia, including China, Japan, India, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula, living in dense forests at high altitudes and being agile and adept at defending themselves."|"['1.

Mr. Caldwell bought a female serow skin and later got a young male. The male was caught swimming below the city wall. The female weighed 310 pounds, and the male 290 pounds. Serows are rare pets and can be dangerous unless tamed young. A photo from the Berlin Zoo shows one. Gorals are like chamois and were hunted on the Snow Mountain. They have blackish brown tails and distinct horns. Gorals live in Asia and are found in India, Burma, and China. They are fierce fighters and hard to hunt due to their habitat. They live in herds and feed on leaves and grass. Gorals rest in a unique position with their legs tucked. When startled, they run a short distance and stop, making them easy targets. Their ability to hide in rocks and grass makes them hard to spot.|['1. What did Mr. Caldwell buy as a pet?\nA) A male serow\nB) A female serow\nC) A gorilla\nD) A chamois\nE) A goral', '2.

Gorals, like other mountain goats, possess remarkable climbing abilities. They can navigate seemingly impossible terrains with ease, even descending near-vertical cliffs where dogs fear to tread. Their unique foot structure allows them to achieve this feat. The crescentic horn at the front of their hooves is surrounded by a shallow concavity, providing a secure grip on rocky surfaces. The soles of their main digits and dewclaws are rubber-like, aiding in maintaining balance on narrow ledges. Gorals exhibit exceptional self-concealment skills, even at a young age. These agile creatures are adept at altering their center of gravity using their dewclaws, enabling them to traverse precarious landscapes effortlessly. Gorals are admired by hunters for their bravery and the challenging hunts they offer in the mountains.|"['1.

"The direct path to Li-chiang is shorter than through Snow Mountain village. At three in the afternoon, we saw the ""Temple of the Flowers"" on the hilltop. As we climbed, we spotted a lively gathering on the porch with laughter and chatter. The courtyard was filled with women and children of all ages. The doors were removed, revealing large cauldrons cooking. We hesitated on the porch until the young priest welcomed us to wait for Wu. Soon, we witnessed a unique ceremony. A man's grave was relocated due to ill fortune predictions. The village astrologer chose the new burial site, a common practice in Chinese tradition. Interference with such customs can lead to dire consequences, as seen in Shanghai in 1898.

In China, the tradition of ancestor worship has led to significant societal issues. Families often go into debt for generations to provide elaborate funerals to honor their deceased, fearing repercussions from angry spirits if not done properly. The obsession with leaving male descendants to worship at graves has resulted in a desperate struggle for survival, with thousands living in poverty. This blind breeding cycle perpetuates fear and self-love, hindering progress. The practice of ancestor worship binds China to its past, preventing advancement. A missionary humorously notes that the only law obeyed in China is to multiply. The struggle for survival is evident in the inaccurate distance estimates by locals, causing delays and frustrations for travelers.

"After leaving the ""White Water,"" we journeyed through a pine forest and reached a summit overlooking the awe-inspiring sight of the Yangtze River cutting through a deep gorge. The view was breathtaking, with the river flowing a thousand feet below. On the opposite side, the mountains opened up to a flat plain supporting three villages, including Taku. The only way to cross the river was a precarious ferry located in a challenging spot. The south bank was steep, requiring a winding trail to a narrow beach. The north side was a vertical rock wall, making it impossible for loaded animals to climb. The packs had to be carried up the cliff by the _mafus_. Loading the boat was difficult, with mules needing to be coaxed and lifted aboard. The ferrymen rowed the boat diagonally across the swift current, but they stopped working early, leaving us stranded with most of our belongings on the other side. Despite the risk of theft, we had to camp there for the night."|"['1.

About a third of a mile from the ferry, we discovered a sandy cornfield on a flat shelf just above the water and set up our tents. A gentle wind blew, filling our shoes, beds, and clothes with sand. After a supper of goral steak, we settled into our sandy beds, only to face a frustrating morning. Hotenfa checked the ferry and found the loads safe but one boatman missing. We tried to persuade the remaining boatman to cross, but he was too scared. Eventually, both boatmen arrived, and we got our caravan across. Heller skinned small mammals while we took photos of the mules boarding. By evening, the caravan had crossed, and we explored caves in the cliffs above the river.

We agreed to meet the villagers at dawn, but they arrived two hours late, which was considered on time for them. It was a sunny day, perfect for our expedition. However, it became clear that the villagers were inexperienced in hunting, and their dogs were not helpful. The dense cover made hunting difficult, so we returned to camp and spent the afternoon developing photographs and studying small mammals. We found various creatures, including shrews and mice, showing that the Yangtze River did not hinder the distribution of these animals. The portable darkroom was crucial for our work, allowing us to develop photographs in the field. Despite challenges like dirty water and cramped spaces, our efforts yielded excellent results. We then traveled to Phete, a village with stunning views of the Yangtze gorge. The locals were friendly but lacked intelligence, making communication challenging.|"['1.

It took a long time to find out that there were no hunters in the village where they lived. The interpreter discovered a hunter in the mountains, not too far away. The journey was challenging, with a steep trail leading up the valley. The hunter's village had three large houses and the people there were shy and had goiters. The villagers had never seen white people before. They ate a meal of cornmeal, rice, squash, and vegetables. The villagers used silver as currency. The explorers bought a sheep, eggs, and honey from them. The coolie who carried the camera left without notice. The explorers camped in a beautiful meadow above the hunter's cabin.

"Hotenfa rejoined us at the Taku ferry after leaving to gather dogs. He brought three hounds that he praised highly, but they didn't meet our expectations. Nevertheless, we were happy to have him back as he was one of the most intelligent and loyal natives we met in Yün-nan. He quickly adapted to our camp ways and became an excellent servant. Since the hunters at the ""Windy Camp"" were ineffective and traps didn't yield new mammals, we decided to cross the mountains towards the Chung-tien road to Tibet. The trail was challenging, with barriers that needed clearing. Despite the difficulties, we reached an altitude of over 15,000 feet, encountering frozen ground and snow. The cold wind made it hard to stay warm. The next morning, we caught new mammals, enduring a freezing night. We descended to a Lolo village, where the natives were fascinated by us, and we exchanged gifts. The Lolos, both men and women, were hospitable and unique in their attire. They were surprised by their own images in photographs. The Lolos, though often misunderstood, showed independence and hospitality towards us."|"['1.

When we encountered tribespeople in Yün-nan who had never seen white individuals, they reacted similarly to other locals. They were always amazed by our caravan's arrival, especially by our guns, tents, and everything else we carried. However, they were usually reserved and less intrusive in their curiosity compared to the Chinese in larger towns who were more familiar with foreigners. Our white skin, light eyes, and hair were always a source of fascination and envy for most Asians. Yvette, in particular, garnered a lot of attention, especially from women. They admired her fair skin and were curious about her hair care routine. Yvette's camera work also captivated many, leaving them in awe as she operated her portable dark room. We planned to join the Lolos to hunt wapiti, known locally as _maloo_, fifteen miles away on the Chung-tien road. Wapiti, a type of deer, is valued for its growing horns in Asia, especially in China, where they are believed to have medicinal properties. Thanksgiving morning was cold, but we set out to hunt wapiti in the beautiful mountainous terrain. Unfortunately, due to fog and snow, the hunt was challenging, and the Lolos eventually left us due to the harsh conditions. Despite the setbacks, we planned to head to the Mekong River for further exploration of the fauna.|"['1.

Caravans often paused for lunch or to rest near our camp. As the horses arrived, the loads were removed one by one, the animals set free, and the men relaxed on the cold ground after a meal of buttered tea and _tsamba_. This lifestyle has created a tough, free-spirited race that roams the vast steppes, seeking only solitude. The Tibetans, with their unique attire and weaponry, exude an air of independence and the harsh Tibetan landscape. They are robust and often tall, with striking features that differ greatly from the Chinese. Despite attempts to photograph them, Tibetans were elusive and wary, avoiding cameras and strangers. Their deep suspicion of outsiders, especially the Chinese, stems from a long history of conflict and a desire to protect their way of life.|['1.

The Tibetan people are unique due to the cold and harsh environment of their country, which deters others from settling there. Similarly, the heat in low-lying Shan states keeps the Chinese away. A snowy morning turned the landscape into a magical place, with delicate webs of snow creating a fairyland. Despite the enchanting scenery, the explorers had to leave to avoid being blocked by snow. On their journey, they encountered caravans of Tibetans heading towards mysterious lands beyond the snow-capped mountains. Despite their efforts to photograph the natives, most were shy and hurried past. The explorers met a friendly Chinese man and a Tibetan, but the Chinese man was disappointed when they couldn't provide him with a photograph. Traveling through breathtaking landscapes, they saw snow-crowned peaks and the majestic Yangtze River. The journey continued along the riverbank, where they marveled at the wildlife and the sparse use of the river for fishing and transportation.|"['1.

In Yün-nan, Heller used his .250-.300 Savage rifle to shoot the first cranes. Sneaking up on five feeding in a meadow, he aimed at two in a line. One fell immediately, while the other, though wing-tipped, ran fast across fields. Two _mafus_ chased it for half a mile, held back by its long beak. These cranes, when cooked with chestnut stuffing, provided delicious meals. The natives found it hard to hunt cranes due to their alertness. The birds usually fed near the river on rice, barley, and corn. Their takeoff was a majestic sight, forming orderly ranks in the sky. Returning to Ta-li Fu in January, cranes were plentiful near the lake. Along the Yangtze, Heller also shot mallard ducks and ruddy sheldrakes. The sheldrakes, often mistaken for true ducks, have a beautiful color reminiscent of Brahmin priests' robes. They were found feeding in fields and sitting in pairs by the water. The plaintive call of the sheldrakes evoked memories of marshes and flying geese. Mallards were abundant, while pheasants were scarce in Yün-nan, requiring a good dog for successful hunting.|['1.

After traveling up the Yangtze River for two and a half days, we changed direction towards Wei-hsi and set up camp on a picturesque flat plain next to a stream lined with trees. The night was cold and clear, and after having dinner and gathering around the fire for a smoke, we all went to bed. Suddenly, we were woken up by a chaotic uproar of angry voices and Chinese curses that echoed through the entire camp. Wu, almost speechless with anger, informed us that foolish soldiers were attempting to take our horses. They threatened to untie our loads if our stable hands, the _mafus_, didn't comply. With our permission, the _mafus_ swiftly dealt with the soldiers, leaving them bruised and battered. The soldiers later apologized for their actions, realizing their mistake. Wu explained that such incidents were common in China, where soldiers took advantage of their power to extort from the locals. This behavior instilled fear and resentment among the peasants towards the military. It is a shameful situation that must be addressed for the country to progress and foster a true sense of patriotism.|"['1.

We journeyed down to the Mekong River to explore its fauna. After a challenging climb over a snow-covered mountain ridge, we reached the river, where we camped near a village. The locals, believed to be Lutzus, greeted us warmly. Their attire was distinct from other tribes in the region. The women wore blue coats, trousers, and pleated skirts, while the men donned plum-colored outfits. The natives mentioned sightings of monkeys, but our traps only caught a tiny mouse. Traveling down the Mekong River, we faced narrow trails unsuitable for our caravan. The valley was lush with terraced rice paddies and corn fields. The locals lived in villages and cultivated crops like corn and peas. The valley's rocky sides were difficult to traverse, with occasional rope bridges crossing the river. Despite the challenging terrain, we discovered rare shrews, silver moles, and a spiny rat in our traps.|['1.

"While resting near the summit of a deep canyon, Hotenfa spotted three gorals. Excitedly, he signaled ""_gnai-yang_"" and pointed to the animals. I mistook a goral for a rock and fired, causing the gorals to vanish. Disappointed, we hurried to the other side of the gorge. Hotenfa climbed the rock wall while I followed. He fired my gun and signaled for me to join him. Peering over the edge, we saw a huge goral below. As I aimed to shoot, the ground crumbled beneath me, but Hotenfa saved me from falling. Despite breaking the goral's leg, it escaped. I shot again, causing it to plummet down the mountain. The goral landed far below, requiring effort to retrieve. The next day, we camped by a stream in a lush ravine for Christmas. Yvette surprised us with a beautifully decorated tent and a Christmas tree with gifts from Hong Kong.

Our Christmas feast was extraordinary. A few days earlier, I had hunted two mallard ducks, which were the highlight of our meal. The dinner included soup, ducks stuffed with chestnuts, currant jelly, baked squash, creamed carrots, chocolate cake, cheese and crackers, coffee, and cigarettes. On Christmas day, we journeyed through a dirty Chinese town near salt wells. The place was covered in red clay dust, and the streets were filthy. We camped in a cornfield beyond the village, but the locals bothered us by intruding into our camp. To deter them, I had to drive them away with stones. The next day, as we left, we saw caravans carrying large salt disks. Salt is a government monopoly in China, and each district has its own production sources. In Yün-nan, salt is obtained by boiling water from wells and extracting pure salt. We then traveled through a mountain range, experiencing heavy snowfall overnight, transforming the landscape into a winter wonderland.|['1.

Occasionally, a large white goose or an ibis would gracefully pass by the pond, seemingly aware that they were safe from the guns aimed at other birds. The marsh lay in absolute silence, except for the harmonious calls of waterfowl, a melody cherished by every sportsman's heart. As the day waned, accompanied by ducks and geese, we strolled back through the rice fields towards our tents glowing with yellow fires. It marked our final camp of the year. The distant Snow Mountain peaks shimmered under a silver coat against a sky of lavender and gold, bidding us farewell as we headed towards the tropics. On January 3, we set up camp early beside a spring near Erh Hai, a thirty-mile-long lake.

In China, missionaries and foreigners employ numerous servants, a luxury they couldn't afford back home. This practice is necessary due to the lack of Western democracy in China and the societal expectations placed on missionaries. The missionary's wife, often engaged in community work, requires household help to manage her duties effectively. Servants in China come at a low cost, making it feasible for missionaries to employ them. Additionally, missionaries in remote provinces like Fukien endure extreme weather conditions, necessitating a two-month vacation. Despite the challenges, missionaries dedicate themselves to providing medical care, education, and social reforms in China. They combat barbaric traditions like foot binding and the selling of girl babies, promoting Western standards of living and morality.

The missionaries faced challenges in Yün-nan Province as the Chinese locals were skeptical of their intentions. The Chinese were materialistic and suspicious, believing missionaries had hidden agendas like spying or trading. However, over time, the missionaries gained trust through their actions. In Fukien Province, brigandage arose due to a famine and betrayal, leading to violent confrontations. Despite efforts to negotiate, the government's broken promises escalated violence.

In the field, a man lay injured, pleading for help under the scorching sun. The missionary learned of his unjust suffering due to an old feud. Determined to bring peace, the missionary bravely faced the brigands, earning their trust. With him as their guarantee, they entered the city to negotiate peace. Through his efforts, the brigands were pardoned, returning to their homes as farmers. This act of courage and compassion ended the terror, earning the missionary respect and admiration.

The vast Yung-chang plain, with its paddy fields and scattered villages, welcomed us as we trotted along a dirt road. The city itself, with its clean, straight streets and temples on wooded hills, captivated us. Camping near the city, we experienced the Chinese New Year festivities, witnessing customs like feasting, colorful attire, and family reunions. The celebration included religious rites honoring ancestors and the Kitchen God. It was a time of joy and relaxation, with families coming together and taking part in traditional practices.|['1.

During the Chinese New Year festivities, family members pay respects to each other before the younger males visit elders in different houses. The days following are spent visiting relatives in nearby towns and villages until the Feast of the Lanterns marks the end of the festivities. Chinese people are known to be avid gamblers, especially during the New Year, but they also prioritize settling debts before the year ends. It is customary for individuals with surplus cash to lend it to family members in need, albeit at high interest rates. Chinese culture dictates that debts must be settled by the end of the year, leading to a flurry of activity as creditors chase debtors to collect what is owed. The Chinese New Year is a time of celebration and debt settlement, where dodges and subterfuges are employed to either avoid paying debts or secure what is owed.|['1.

"In Yung-chang, we encountered water buffaloes for the first time, but they are more commonly used in the southern and western regions. These massive creatures are gentle with local children but cautious around strangers. While water buffaloes work in rice fields, Chinese cows carry burdens in this area. These cows travel slower than mules, often with large bells on their backs, creating a melodic sound from a distance. Marco Polo once described Yung-chang as ""Vochang"" and narrated a historic battle between the King of Burma, Bengal, and Kublai Khan's general in 1272. The battle involved elephants carrying wooden castles into combat, causing chaos and eventual retreat. The clash was fierce, with arrows flying and swords clashing, resulting in a bloody and tumultuous scene."|['1.

The Tartars regrouped after defeating the enemy and headed back to the forest where the elephants had taken refuge. They discovered the survivors barricading themselves in the woods. Despite the men's efforts, the Tartars broke through their defenses, capturing over two hundred elephants with the help of experienced handlers. This victory led to the Grand Khan's decision to include elephants in his armies, expanding his territory by annexing lands from the kings of Bangala and Mien. Leaving Yung-chang on January 28, we journeyed south through barren mountains before descending into a lush valley at Shih-tien. The valley was a picturesque landscape of rice paddies, sugar cane fields, and bamboo groves. Although the area seemed ideal for hunting, we only managed to catch a few teal. At Shih-tien, we camped in a temple yard and gathered information on shooting locations from the locals. The village residents showed great curiosity about us, with crowds gathering wherever we went.|"['1.

The soldier who came with us from Shih-tien delivered a message at Ma-po-lo village. The magistrate, a Shan native, arrived with a few men and we found only one person speaking Chinese. The magistrate didn't want to be responsible for our safety and claimed there was no game or hunters in the area. The valley was foggy in the morning, but we soon climbed out of it and reached the cold mountain ridges by noon. The region we passed through was similar to what we had seen before – cultivated valleys surrounded by barren mountains. We left a large town near Gen-kang feeling discouraged after a month of unreliable native guidance. Despite the gloomy weather, we continued southward through muddy trails until the landscape suddenly changed. We entered a grassy valley with lush hills and a stream, perfect for small mammals. Setting traps, we caught several new species for our collection. The next day, we skinned and preserved the specimens for further study.|"[""1.

In camp, we salt and dry large animal skins. After removing flesh and fat, we rub salt all over the hide and roll it up. The next morning, we unwrap it, pour off the extracted water, and hang the skin to dry. If it's not too hot, we keep it in the shade, but usually, it goes in the sun. Before it hardens, we roll or fold the hide hair side in, tie it, and let it dry completely. Keeping it bone dry is crucial as salt absorbs moisture. We trained our Chinese boys to skin animals expertly, but we always checked the salted hides. Natives from Mu-cheng village helped us hunt sambur, serow, and muntjac. They lacked modern gear but showed us proof of their hunting skills. The days in camp were delightful with clear, cold nights and frosty mornings. We explored the woods, reset traps, and captured the beauty of nature through photography.|['1.

Yvette quickly runs to search for the animal as the gun goes off once more. Despite already capturing numerous squirrels from the tree, more remain. Occasionally, a small chipmunk appears on the lower branches, scavenging for grubs. After a successful hunt, they return to camp for a delightful dinner of broiled deer steak by the fire. Later, they embark on their favorite task of running traps with lanterns and a gun. The night is alive with sounds, from tiny feet scurrying to the distant barks of a muntjac and a fox. As they check the traps, they find various creatures, including a rare Insectivore and a large rat. The day ends with them back at camp, cozy by the charcoal brazier, recording their findings and enjoying some reading time before settling into their sleeping bags under the moonlit tent.|['1.

We paused on our horses until the soft sound of the bell on the lead mule signaled the caravan's nearness. Slowly, we descended the steep path amidst lush vegetation. Within an hour, we were in the warm, humid air of the tropics, crossing a flat valley. Tall grass, bamboo groves, banana palms, and majestic trees intertwined with vines dotted the landscape. Nestled near the mountain's base was a Shan village with bamboo houses resembling upturned boats. A woman spun yarn outside a small house, reminiscent of Priscilla, while John Alden, armed, stood nearby. Our arrival in this tranquil village, disrupted by our foreign presence, intrigued the villagers. We continued our journey, crossing the plain to the Nam-ting River, passing through rice paddies and witnessing flocks of cranes soaring above. Eventually, we reached Meng-ting, a village with a residential area atop a wooded knoll and shops below. After setting up camp, we met the young Shan mandarin, dressed in a peculiar mix of traditional and Western attire, along with his Chinese secretary, who guarded hunting information closely.|"[""1.

The next morning, the Chinaman assured us he would look into hunting grounds and contact us later. Back at camp, natives arrived bearing gifts from the mandarin: rice, potatoes, eggs, chickens, and firewood. We learned the supplies were customary for high officials visiting villages. We kept the eggs and chickens, returning the rest generously. Above camp, a Shan Buddhist monastery echoed with chants at dawn and dusk. Little priests in yellow robes watched us from afar, wild and curious. In the village, priests roamed, spending time under shady trees. Families sent male children to the monastery for three years to learn under the Church's tutelage. The weekly market in Meng-ting was a vibrant scene with natives from nine tribes trading goods and conversing in various languages, creating a colorful and bustling atmosphere.|"['1.

When all the plate holders were filled, we quickly returned to the market, followed by two workers carrying the cameras. Yvette continued her work while I arranged the cinematograph. Wu stood by me, and within moments, the space in front of us was crowded with locals. The street scene we aimed to capture vanished, so I focused on the mass of faces, capturing a range of expressions. Initially, the natives were hesitant to stay put for the camera, but a few brave souls paved the way for others to follow. The Kachin women, adorned in traditional attire, proved challenging to photograph. Yvette struggled, but with perseverance, she managed to expose all her plates.

"In China, opium is smoked openly in tea houses. The process involves cooking the drug over an alcohol lamp, preparing a ""pill,"" and inhaling the smoke through a pipe. Despite smoking multiple times, no immediate effects are visible, but habitual users show signs like deathly paleness and expressionless eyes. The Chinese government actively works to curb opium use, with strict inspections and officials cracking down on poppy growing.

Trapping is a fascinating challenge where the trapper matches wits with animals, often at a disadvantage. The trap might be poorly camouflaged, the area disturbed, or human scent lingering. One evening, our guide introduced a unique hunter, a tall Mohammedan Chinese dressed like a Shan. Despite his slow, deliberate movements and soft voice, he proved to be an energetic and skilled hunter. The next day, he led a group of Shans to beat a jungle patch, but they faced challenges due to dense cover. The beaters, armed with various guns, worked efficiently under his guidance. They managed to startle a sambur close to us, showcasing their hunting prowess.

The jungle fowl, believed to be the ancestor of our barnyard hens and roosters, was first domesticated in Burma and neighboring lands. Tradition suggests that the Chinese obtained their poultry from the West around 1400 B.C. The black-breasted jungle fowl, residing in various regions like northern India and the Malay Peninsula, can be challenging to hunt due to their elusive nature. These birds prefer thick cover during the day but emerge during cloudy weather and at dawn and dusk to feed in clearings. The male jungle fowl, adorned in vibrant plumage, leads a group of hens, displaying protective behavior and alerting the flock to danger. During the mating season, hens lay eggs in hidden nests, with the chicks emitting familiar sounds akin to domestic birds. The male's striking red and gold feathers may change after the breeding season. Jungle fowl are known for their polygamous tendencies, engaging in fights like their domestic counterparts. Additionally, encounters with polecat and civet animals in the area were observed during this expedition.|['1.

Checking the traps twice a day was a highlight of our camping experience. It felt like unwrapping a gift each time we strolled along the trails, as every trap held exciting possibilities. The diverse mammals in the area always kept us on our toes with surprises. Apart from civets and polecats, we caught mongooses, palm civets, and other carnivores. The smaller traps revealed a new _Hylomys_, several rats, and an intriguing shrew. We even spotted giant squirrels (_Ratufa gigantea_), one of which we managed to shoot. These elusive creatures, measuring thirty-six inches long, had coal-black fur on top and yellow underneath. They inhabited regions like India, Siam, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies islands, and Borneo. Our most thrilling activity at Nam-ting camp was hunting monkeys. Every morning, we were greeted by high-pitched calls resembling the cries of young puppies, followed by melodious wails that filled the air. The monkeys remained hidden high in the trees, making it a challenging but exhilarating pursuit.|['1.

In the dense jungle of Nam-ting River camp, we encountered a fascinating sight: a troop of monkeys of various colors and species. Among them was a rare yellow gibbon, a brown baboon, and a large gray ape. These creatures moved with incredible speed, leaping and swinging through the tree canopy. In an attempt to capture one for study, we fired shots at them, but they proved elusive, disappearing into the thick foliage. Despite our efforts, the monkeys remained out of reach, darting away effortlessly. The gibbons, with their distinctive features, proved to be the most intriguing of the bunch.

"The gibbons, known as ""tree-walkers,"" are skilled at moving through the trees. Once they grasp a branch, they swiftly swing from limb to limb, moving faster than a man can run. Their long arms, with hands longer than their feet, aid in this swift movement. Despite being challenging to hunt, they are agile and elusive. In contrast, langurs and baboons are less wild and often found in larger groups. Langurs carry their young, which are bright orange-red initially, as they leap through the treetops. As they mature, their red fur turns gray, starting from their tail. These animals, sacred in some Indian regions, can cause crop damage, leading locals to seek help in managing them. Baboons, close relatives of macaques, are commonly seen in Indian cities like Calcutta and Bombay. The Monkey Temple in Agra is a popular tourist spot where macaques are fed and interact with visitors."|['1.

"During one of our jungle expeditions, my wife and I stumbled upon a water hole teeming with animal tracks. Eagerly, we decided to spend a night there, but our companion, the ""Dying Rabbit,"" hesitated as darkness fell. Reluctantly, he agreed to join us. Although our vigil yielded no tangible results, the experience remains etched in our memories. As night descended, enveloping the forest in velvety darkness, we sat silently by the water hole. The jungle came alive with unseen creatures, their movements rustling through the leaves. The distant calls of sambur stags and wild boars sent shivers down our spines.

The Shan tribe, known for their intricate tattoos, resides in regions below 4,000 feet in Yün-nan, China. The tribe, with subdivisions, once ruled vast territories before Mongol emperors conquered them. Despite their history, the Shans now live in semi-independent states under Burma, China, and Siam. The Shans, a short and strong race with Mongolian features, have a distinct dress style varying by region. The men wear baggy trousers and large straw hats, while the women sport white jackets and blue skirts with turbans. The Shans live in semi-independent states and are known for their happy camps. The journey to Ma-li-ling, a tiny village near the Burma border, was challenging but rewarding with beautiful scenery and unique encounters along the way.|"['1.

After dinner, we spoke with a few locals who understood Chinese, but we only grew more confused. They were unaware of Ma-li-ling but knew of Ma-li-pa, a village in Burma where they mentioned foreign soldiers stationed. We suspected they were Indian troops with a possible white officer in command. Reluctant to cross the border without permits, we were perplexed by the elusive Ma-li-ling. Eventually, we discovered two villages with that name, one in Burma and the other in China, correctly marked on our map. Amid discussions, a dispute erupted between the Chinese _mafus_ and our servants. Roy intervened when the _mafus_ threatened to leave unless paid more, warning them with his rifle. The _mafus_ relented, and the next day, they were cooperative as we headed towards Ma-li-pa. Upon arrival, we encountered a diverse village with Indian soldiers, and a surprising encounter with a British officer named Captain Clive, who had not seen another English speaker in months.|"['1.

Captain Clive invited us to his bamboo bungalow for a meal and shared news of the outside world. The United States had cut ties with Germany. The bungalow was cool and well-kept, a contrast to the scorching plains. Captain Clive, a descendant of Lord Clive, was stationed at Ma-li-pa, a temporary post near the border. Messages were relayed to Lashio using heliographs. We camped nearby, awaiting clearance to proceed. The Indian government was cautious due to unrest in the region. Clive maintained a disciplined routine, drilling his diverse company in English. The British's respect for local customs aided their success as colonizers.

Every morning, at the break of dawn, we set out for our shooting expeditions and returned by nine o'clock. While the conditions were not ideal for capturing small mammals, we refrained from setting steel traps as we anticipated leaving soon. Our main focus was on collecting birds, and we managed to gather around two hundred fascinating specimens. Captain Clive joined us for our mid-morning and evening meals, living comfortably with the supplies he brought from Lashio. Despite warm days, the nights were chilly, making the warmth of a campfire quite welcoming. Captain Clive had a good relationship with the Chinese authorities, as evidenced by a visit from an elderly mandarin who showed great interest in our guns. Additionally, we encountered a wounded Chinaman seeking refuge in our camp, a testament to the dangers lurking just beyond the border.|"['1.

The valley lacks human presence, except for three ferry operators. Deserted rice fields hint at past cultivation. High up the canyon, a Miao village, a new tribe to us, resides. Likely, the valley's unhealthiness keeps natives away. Even in early March, malaria hangs in the air. The ferry operators, half-drugged with opium, claimed no mammals nearby. They admitted hearing peacocks, whose calls echoed through the valley. The ferry, a bamboo raft, floated near the surface. The men used woven bamboo mats with handles as oars. Peacocks stayed across the river in thick jungle. Stalking them was challenging due to the dry, crackling leaves. Successfully observing peacocks by the river at dawn or dusk was the best approach.|"['1.

In the dense jungle near our camp on the Salween River, we encountered elusive peafowls. These birds, with their vibrant plumage, were shy and hard to hunt. Despite their calls throughout the day, they stayed deep in the jungle, making it impossible to approach them without alerting them. The peafowls relied on their keen senses and the cover of bushes to protect themselves. They would come to the river to drink in the early morning and at dusk, avoiding loud noises. The flesh of the peafowl is considered poisonous by some cultures. The green peafowl we encountered is known for its beauty and unique features. The train of long feathers is used to attract females, and the birds molt irregularly. Peafowls are omnivorous, feeding on various things like insects, grubs, and grain. The common peafowl is native to India and is sometimes considered aggressive, especially towards the infirm and young poultry.|['Question 1: What is one reason the peafowls in the jungle near the camp were hard to hunt?\nA) They were aggressive towards humans\nB) They stayed deep in the jungle\nC) They were attracted to loud noises\nD) They had poor eyesight\nE) They had dull plumage', 'Question 2: When did the peafowls come to the river to drink?\nA) Midday\nB) Late afternoon\nC) Evening\nD) Midnight\nE) Early morning', 'Question 3: What is a unique feature of the green peafowl?\nA) It has poisonous feathers\nB) It is native to Africa\nC) It has a dull appearance\nD) It is known for its beauty\nE) It molts regularly', 'Question 4: What do peafowls feed on?\nA) Leaves and grass\nB) Fish and small mammals\nC) Insects, grubs, and grain\nD) Berries and fruits\nE) Only meat', 'Question 5: Why did the peafowls avoid loud noises?\nA) They were deaf\nB) Loud noises scared them away\nC) They were aggressive towards loud sounds\nD) Loud noises attracted them\nE) They were used to loud noises', 'Question 6: Which culture considers the flesh of the peafowl as poisonous?\nA) Indian\nB) African\nC) Chinese\nD) European\nE) None of the above']|['B) They stayed deep in the jungle', 'E) Early morning', 'D) It is known for its beauty', 'C) Insects, grubs, and grain', 'B) Loud noises scared them away', 'E) None of the above']
In southern and western China, a bird was traditionally depicted on official mandarins' attire to show their rank. This bird, found in dense jungle, is hard to locate. Monkeys, likely Indian baboons, were observed near the Salween River camp, but they were too wild to catch. The valley wasn't ideal for trapping mammals due to dryness, with jungle fowl and pigeons being common. The ferry saw few natives crossing as it was far from the main road, and the climb out of the gorge was tough. The journey to Lung-ling took longer due to malaria. The town had narrow streets filled with ragged children and curious locals. The region lacked animal life, contrasting the charming Shan villages. Lung-ling, a typical Chinese town, disappointed with no mail. The next hunting camp was near Ho-mu-shu, where gibbons were rumored to be found.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was traditionally depicted on official mandarins' attire in southern and western China?\nA) Monkeys\nB) Jungle fowl\nC) Pigeons\nD) Gibbons\nE) A bird"", 'Question 2:\nWhy were monkeys observed near the Salween River camp too wild to catch?\nA) Due to their speed\nB) Due to their intelligence\nC) Due to their aggressive behavior\nD) Due to their camouflage\nE) Due to their small size', ""Question 3:\nWhy wasn't the valley ideal for trapping mammals?\nA) Due to excessive rainfall\nB) Due to extreme cold\nC) Due to dense jungle\nD) Due to dryness\nE) Due to lack of trees"", 'Question 4:\nWhy did the ferry see few natives crossing?\nA) Due to its small size\nB) Due to its location far from the main road\nC) Due to its high cost\nD) Due to its slow speed\nE) Due to its poor condition', 'Question 5:\nWhy did the journey to Lung-ling take longer?\nA) Due to heavy traffic\nB) Due to road construction\nC) Due to malaria\nD) Due to bad weather\nE) Due to a detour', 'Question 6:\nWhy did the region lack animal life despite charming Shan villages?\nA) Due to hunting\nB) Due to deforestation\nC) Due to pollution\nD) Due to disease\nE) Due to unknown reasons']"|['E) A bird', 'C) Due to their aggressive behavior', 'D) Due to dryness', 'B) Due to its location far from the main road', 'C) Due to malaria', 'B) Due to deforestation']
We set up camp on a small hill under a massive tree at the edge of the village. Soon after, the Shan magistrate visited us. He was a lively man in modern attire, familiar with foreign customs. He even had a modern shotgun and requested ammunition before we departed. He gifted us chickens, and I reciprocated with cigarette tins. He guided us to a spot on the mountain where monkeys were said to be plentiful. The next day, we journeyed to Ho-mu-shu, a quaint village perched on the mountainside with a stunning view over the Salween valley. Despite the late arrival, we camped as the guides claimed there was no nearby water. The following morning, we found a suitable campsite close by, revealing the guides' deceit. As we reached the ridge summit, the forest echoed with gibbons' calls, prompting us to set up camp.

While exploring the forest, my wife and I encountered a thrilling sight. A large black monkey leaped from a tree, catching us by surprise. The monkey swiftly swung through the treetops, followed by a herd of monkeys. We were amazed by their agility and speed. Though we couldn't get a clear shot at them, we later managed to successfully hunt new gibbons. As we sat quietly, we heard the monkeys' calls echo through the mountains. Running towards the sound, we navigated rocky terrain until we spotted the monkeys in the distance. With careful aim, I managed to shoot down a few monkeys, including a fierce female. The intense hunt ended with a dramatic encounter where a large brown monkey faced me head-on before meeting its fate.

In the jungle, I faced a perilous climb to rescue fallen monkeys. The rocks, covered in a thin layer of earth, made the ascent treacherous. I clung to a vine that gave way, sending me sliding towards a steep drop. Miraculously, my rifle caught on a ledge, saving me from a deadly fall. After a harrowing ordeal, I made it back to safety, weak and sick. Reunited with my worried wife, we left the monkeys to be recovered and returned to camp. The male monkeys were coal black with white facial hair, while the females were light brown. Their calls were distinct, howling as they swung through the trees. Despite the dangers, witnessing their agility and speed was awe-inspiring. After a long wait, we received mail, reconnecting us with the outside world.

"After camping near Ho-mu-shu, we moved to Tai-ping-pu village, closer to Teng-yueh. The journey along the mountain's summit was delightful, passing through blooming rhododendron groves. These trees, up to thirty feet tall, had red flowers glowing like live coals among dark green leaves. Despite continuous rain at Tai-ping-pu, I fell ill with Salween malaria, limiting my work. Heller, however, made progress, hunting a horned pheasant and langurs. He even shot a huge flying squirrel, measuring over forty-two inches. Flying squirrels use a ""patagium"" to glide between trees. We later bought a live flying squirrel, hoping to tame it, but it remained aggressive. Local Lisos helped us hunt, using crossbows and poisoned darts. They guided us to a bat-filled cave, where we caught twenty-eight bats, enduring their sharp bites."|"['1.

From Lung-ling, a messenger was dispatched to Mr. Evans at Ta-li Fu to forward our specimens to Teng-yueh. The next day, our caravan carrying our belongings passed us at Tai-ping-pu. Two days later, we stood on a high mountain peak, overlooking the beautiful Teng-yueh plain, resembling a map with its vast rice fields interrupted by small villages. Teng-yueh, despite being a second-class city in China, holds immense importance as a gateway to India, facilitating trade between Burma, Yün-nan, and Bhamo. The city houses the Customs officials, including British officers like Mr. Grierson, who informed us about the US declaration of war on Germany. We were graciously hosted by Mr. Grierson in his lovely home, where we packed our specimens in airtight boxes for transport. Additionally, we acquired two bear cubs from a local, nurturing them with care.|"['1.

Two playful bear cubs had a fascinating journey. Sadly, one cub passed away, but the other thrived, traveling over 16,000 miles. The surviving cub accompanied the group to various cities, becoming a ship's pet and even journeying to Japan. Eventually, the bear found a home in New York after adventures that made him famous. Despite growing into a full-grown bear, he remained a beloved pet. His early life was captured in motion pictures, showcasing his adorable appearance with a round furry body and sparkling eyes. The story recounts a hunting expedition where two gorals were shot, marking a new species discovery. The expedition involved challenging terrains and encounters with wildlife, making it an exciting adventure.|"['1.

The other gorals had vanished, but soon a small one cautiously moved along the hill's peak. The first shot missed, but the second hit its leg, causing it to hide behind a boulder. Patiently aiming, I anticipated its move. As expected, the goral cautiously peeked out, and I swiftly fired, bringing it down. The natives, thrilled, rushed up the hill to retrieve the animal. Our joy was slightly dampened when the first goral we shot fell into the river. Despite this, our hunting day was successful, yielding one deer and four gorals. The hunting ground at Hui-yao proved exceptional, allowing us to observe the animals' habits discreetly. The following days were fruitful, with numerous successful hunts. While shooting from afar was effective, hunting on the cliffs provided thrilling sport, requiring caution due to the steep terrain.|"[""Question 1: What happened after the first shot missed the small goral on the hill's peak?\nA) The goral ran away.\nB) The goral attacked the hunter.\nC) The hunter hit the goral's leg.\nD) The goral hid behind a boulder.\nE) The goral charged towards the natives."", 'Question 2: What was the outcome of the second shot fired at the small goral?\nA) The goral escaped into the river.\nB) The goral fell off the cliff.\nC) The goral attacked the hunter.\nD) The goral hid behind a boulder.\nE) The goral was brought down by the hunter.', ""Question 3: How did the natives react when the goral was successfully shot by the hunter?\nA) They scolded the hunter for hunting.\nB) They rushed up the hill to retrieve the animal.\nC) They left the hunting ground immediately.\nD) They ignored the hunter's success.\nE) They abandoned the hunter on the hill."", ""Question 4: What slightly dampened the joy of the hunters after shooting the first goral?\nA) The goral attacking them.\nB) The successful hunt.\nC) The goral falling into the river.\nD) The natives' excitement.\nE) The exceptional hunting ground."", 'Question 5: What did the hunting day at Hui-yao yield in terms of animals?\nA) One deer and four gorals.\nB) Two deer and one goral.\nC) Three gorals and one deer.\nD) Five gorals.\nE) Two gorals and two deer.', ""Question 6: What was a thrilling aspect of hunting on the cliffs according to the passage?\nA) Shooting from afar.\nB) Observing animals discreetly.\nC) The steep terrain.\nD) The successful hunts.\nE) The animals' habits.""]"|['D) The goral hid behind a boulder.', 'E) The goral was brought down by the hunter.', 'B) They rushed up the hill to retrieve the animal.', 'C) The goral falling into the river.', 'A) One deer and four gorals.', 'C) The steep terrain.']
Achi gestured for us to climb above and circle a cliff to a promontory near the animal. After a long climb, we found the goral had vanished. We cautiously searched the meadow below and found the ram feeding. Making our way down the cliff, we reached the meadow where the goral stood. Despite searching, the goral was nowhere to be found. Suddenly, a goral leaped out of the grass, and I shot it down. Achi then pointed to another goral on the ridge above. I took aim and successfully shot it down. The thrill of the hunt filled me with joy as we celebrated our successful kills. Later, Mr. Grierson visited us, bringing news and fresh vegetables, while I also hunted and obtained three monkeys of a different species.|"['1.

While exploring near a river, I spotted two groups of monkeys on the opposite bank. The first group was climbing steep rock walls, swinging on bushes, and disappearing into tufts of grass. Despite being 150 yards away, I attempted to shoot at them but was unsuccessful due to their swift movements. Further down, a larger group played among boulders at the water's edge. I managed to shoot six monkeys, but only three were retrieved from the water. Additionally, I encountered a coal-black serow, a new subspecies, but it fell into the river after I shot it. Despite the challenges of retrieving the serow, I managed to save a woodcutter who struggled in the strong current while trying to swim across the river.|"['1.

We carefully navigated the boulders and stumbled upon a serow resting near the water. I wanted to celebrate, but the rocky terrain didn't allow it. Instead, I signaled to Achi, who grasped the situation. The men who had shouted earlier were close but separated by rocks and water. They offered a vine rope, which we used to secure the serow and safely transport it across. Achi vanished with our clothes, planning to meet us later. We trudged through dense brush unprotected. The serow was carried up with its legs tied, followed by a naked brown figure and me. Achi was missing at the rendezvous point, causing some concern. Eventually, we found him, and I felt relieved and happy. On our way back to camp, we spotted a goral across the river. Our return to camp with the serow was met with celebration. Our journey continued to Wa-tien in search of sambur, with hopes high despite past unsuccessful hunts.|[]|[]
We hired four men and three dogs to aid us in hunting, but a thick fog covered the valley and mountains early in the morning. By mid-morning, the sun dispersed the mist, allowing us to begin our hunt. We ascended a wooded ridge behind our camp and followed the edge of a dense forested ravine where the men wanted to drive the game. Heller stationed himself in a bean field while I climbed a ridge above him. The dogs soon signaled the presence of sambur, and Heller fired twice, but missed. Following the trail into a ravine, we found drops of blood indicating a hit. After tracking the deer, we discovered it lying dead in thick ferns. The magnificent animal weighed around seven hundred pounds and had twenty-seven-inch antlers. The locals were thrilled, especially when they could collect the blood for medicinal purposes. Despite our efforts, we only managed to hunt one deer due to unforeseen circumstances.|"['1.

The hills where we camped were low ridges with trees, rising from valleys into jungle-filled ravines where deer sleep. The reason for deer in this area and not nearby is a mystery, maybe due to the nearby forested mountains. In similar places close by, where there's lots of cover, locals say they've never seen deer. On May 20, we left for Hui-yao to hunt monkeys before returning to Teng-yueh. We got lost but weren't worried with a guide. The locals sometimes purposely give wrong directions to strangers. A farmer sent us the wrong way, delaying us. We had to pack specimens before the rainy season. We returned to Teng-yueh on May 24, ending our fieldwork. We developed motion-picture film and packed specimens for Bhamo. We used man-chairs for the journey, leaving with a caravan on June 1.|"['1.

"Every two hours, we were left in a dirty village while our guides disappeared into dark dens. We grumbled and fumed, peering into their huts to find them huddled over small flames, smoking opium. At mealtime, they lounged under trees, using stones as pillows, cooking opium grains over lamps. The men could work all day without food but needed opium. The road to Bhamo descended from five thousand feet to sea level, with valleys inhabited by ""Chinese Shans."" Crossing the Yün-nan border into Burma, we saw a beautiful spot with a rushing mountain stream and a splendid iron bridge. On one side was China, with flooded roads, and on the other, English Burma, with modern infrastructure. The British government provided comfortable _dâk_ bungalows for tired travelers.
