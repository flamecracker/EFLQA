Andy, feeling a bit strange about the reference to the famous Edmund Burke, promised to be truthful from now on.

Andy burst into laughter at the thought, joined by the ladies. Thanking them, he rushed home, unsure if he was happier about his own gift or his mother's. Skipping ahead to September, Andy had an encounter that changed his life. Colonel Preston, a wealthy man, owned stocks in a woolen factory in Melville.

The dinner continued, and Fairfax was unusually friendly, impressing Colonel Preston with his knowledge of stocks.

"Dear Doctor Townley,

I am overjoyed to hear of my husband's recovery. I have been filled with anxiety for the past four weeks. I have lost weight and my worries have taken a toll on me. I am grateful for your skill in restoring my husband's health. I am also pleased with the nurse's dedication, and she will be generously compensated.

Please convey my love to Mr. Preston and inform him of my arrival next week. I appreciate your care for him and will always be thankful. 

Sincerely,
Lucinda Preston

The doctor expressed his discontent, emphasizing that no amount of money could repay the nurse's selfless service and the risks she took.

He immediately recognized the boy by his appearance and voice, feeling a surge of resentment. Being outsmarted was bad enough, but being outsmarted by a boy was embarrassing.

Second, the boy wouldn't have recognized him anyway. Fairfax had cleverly disguised himself with a red wig and whiskers. Fairfax had finished his meal but waited for Andy to finish. He followed Andy to the counter, both paying at once. Fairfax was bold in his disguise, confident in his plan. As Andy went to the bank, Fairfax shadowed him.

As they waited for the play to start, Fairfax explained the exhibits to Andy. Despite a feeling of familiarity with Fairfax, Andy attributed it to chance resemblance due to the red wig and whiskers. While Andy enjoyed the play as a novelty, Fairfax pretended interest to gain Andy's trust.

Mrs. Preston was thinking about the will left by her late husband and was not happy with the provisions for Andy Burke and his mother. She felt it was absurd to leave them $5,000 and a house.

Mrs. Preston, usually cold and distant, was surprisingly thrilled. She resented her late husband's decision to leave a significant part of his estate to the town, feeling it unjust towards her and her son, Godfrey, the only person she truly cared for. As she pondered over the will, a rare flush of anger colored her cheek. Contemplating the unfairness of it all, she felt a strong urge to destroy the document to secure the inheritance for herself and Godfrey. Justifying her actions to herself, she set the will ablaze and discarded the remains. Meanwhile, Godfrey, returning home after his father's passing, struggled to process his emotions. Despite the somber occasion, Mrs. Preston couldn't help but think about the potential disappointment of others, like Mrs. Burke and Andy, who had come to pay their respects at the funeral.|"[""1.

"Even Godfrey, however, had the decency to let this thought remain unspoken. The services proceeded, and among those who followed on foot in the funeral procession were Andy and his mother. It never occurred to them that they were intruding. They wanted to show respect for the memory of one who had been a friend to them.

""I invited you to come here, Squire Tisdale,"" said Mrs. Preston, ""to speak about my affairs. Of course, it is very trying to me to think of business so soon after the death of my dear husband""--here she pressed her handkerchief to her tearless eyes--""but I feel it to be my duty to myself and my boy.""

But it was too late now. Besides, it seemed very improbable that there should be another will. Had there been an earlier one, it would, doubtless, have been destroyed on the drafting of the one she had found. She reassured herself, therefore, and awaited with tranquillity the result of the search."|"['1.

Andy and his mother moved into Dr. Townley's cottage, an upgrade from their previous home. They paid a rent of fifty dollars, which Dr. Townley would have waived if he could afford it. Despite his good income as a doctor, he had financial responsibilities, including a son in college. Andy's earnings helped the Burkes live comfortably. However, a challenge arose when it was suggested that Andy's sister needed to move to a town with milder air. Andy worried about finding work elsewhere, as his wages supported his family. He considered working for Dr. Townley but realized there were no openings. The Misses Grant, who moved away, gifted Andy an old watch, showing their appreciation. Andy struggled to find employment in the village, with limited opportunities for a young boy like him.|"[""1.

Colonel Preston handed Dr. Townley an envelope, explaining that it contained an important paper. The colonel emphasized the significance of the document but chose not to disclose its contents, reassuring Dr. Townley that it would reveal its purpose when opened. Despite the colonel's passing and the doctor's speculation that the paper might be a will, he found it puzzling why he was instructed to wait six months before reading it. The doctor ultimately concluded that it likely wasn't a will. The letter enclosed in the envelope was a duplicate of a will, expressing Colonel Preston's wishes regarding his property. The colonel entrusted Dr. Townley as the executor, expressing confidence in their friendship and requesting that the doctor fulfill the responsibilities outlined in the will. The bequest of five thousand dollars to Andy Burke was seen as a generous gesture that would positively impact the young man's future and contribute to the town's cultural development.|"['1.

Dr. Townley decided to seek advice from the town officials regarding the will, as the town had an interest in it. It was agreed that Dr. Townley and Mr. Graves would travel to Boston the following day to inform Mrs. Preston about the will. They chose not to tell Andy or his mother until after the meeting. Mrs. Preston lived in a grand house in the South End and was enjoying her newfound lifestyle. Godfrey, her son, was attending a private school, but he was more interested in enjoying life than studying hard. The next morning, Mrs. Preston was surprised to see Dr. Townley and Mr. Graves in her parlor. Dr. Townley informed her about the will, which left money for the town and Andy Burke. Mrs. Preston was taken aback but decided not to contest the will, despite her initial reluctance. Andy, unaware of his good fortune, was feeling disheartened as he struggled to find work.|"['1.
