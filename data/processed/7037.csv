My stories about England's wars are incomplete without the Roman era. The Romans were acknowledged for their discipline in conquering the brave Britons. The Roman conquest initially brought benefits by introducing civilization but later led to disaster as the Britons lost their military prowess. The Saxons then overpowered the Britons after the Roman legions left. The Danes further oppressed the Britons, erasing their civilization. The British population's fate post-invasion remains uncertain. The Britons' valiant spirit against Caesar and Boadicea's rebellion against Rome lives on in the veins of the British people. The Britons believe in their strength against the Romans, despite divisions hindering unity. The Romans' advancements impress some Britons, yet they despise Roman oppression. The Britons admire Roman civilization but detest being ruled by them.|"['1.

"Beric, your progress is commendable. I was concerned the opulence of Roman grandeur might sway your loyalty. I despise them all; change is abhorrent to me. I prefer our traditional ways,"" Boduoc remarked. ""Yet, Boduoc, we too have evolved. Our ancestors were fierce warriors, but we've learned much from Gaul and Rome.

Our hope lies in unity against Roman forces. Although they may send armies, their efforts may wane due to little gain. The Romans may tire of the expense and losses, possibly abandoning their futile mission. To rid our land of them requires unity when we rise against them and remain united. We need a great leader to unite all tribes, like the Roman legions obeying one general. However, finding such a leader seems unlikely while we remain tranquil under Roman rule. Only in battle might a leader emerge who can unite all tribes. Even the greatest hero may struggle to find support from all tribes. The challenges of uniting the tribes are immense, as history has shown with betrayals and divisions among our people. The task of freeing ourselves from Roman rule is more daunting now than it was in the past.|['1.

Beric followed his mother's instructions diligently. Romans aimed to win over their foes, and Beric was treated well under Caius Muro, a legion commander. A slave taught Beric Latin, and he dined with Caius' scribe and steward in their grand house in Camalodunum. Beric impressed his teachers by eagerly studying and training in arms. Caius' wife, Julia, admired Beric's strength and intelligence. However, tragedy struck when Julia passed away due to the damp climate. After five years, Beric returned to his tribe, accompanied by Boduoc, an older tribesman who once taught him hunting and combat skills.

The streets were filled with a diverse array of people - traders from Gaul and Italy, Roman artisans, legionaries, officials, Greek performers, artists, and local tribesmen.

Beric and Boduoc set out after a meal, embarking on a forest trail seldom used, except by occasional messengers. The road was cleared by legions during past conflicts, but now lay quiet due to the Iceni tribe's compliance with Roman demands.

As the men entered the hut and observed the damaged roof and the nine wolves lying lifeless on the ground, they realized they had arrived just in time. The owner of the hut, overjoyed to find his family unharmed, expressed his gratitude to Beric and Boduoc for leaving the secure woods to help defend the hut against the wolves. The man shared that his family was safe in a newly built stockade in the nearby village, which was fortified to protect against wolf attacks. The group then returned to Cardun, a village situated on a knoll surrounded by swamps. The village was made up of simple mud and stone huts with thatched roofs, while the chief's dwelling was more elaborate, featuring a raised dais and furnished with skins and gold vessels. The men in the village were armed and adorned with tattoos and blue body paint from the woad plant.|"['1.

Beric walked into his mother's home, greeted her with a bow, and received scolding for straying from the safety of the trees during the hunt. Parta, a tall woman, wore a garment fastened with a gold brooch and a studded belt. After a quick meal, Beric joined experienced chiefs for the wolf hunt. The tribesmen, armed with hunting dogs, formed a long line through the forest. As they moved forward, wild boars tried to break through, but many were slain for food. The tribesmen then encountered wolves near the rivers, engaging in a fierce battle. By the end of the day, hundreds of wolves were killed. The next day, they formed a new line and drove the remaining wolves towards the river. After a fortnight, the area was cleared of wolves.|['1.

The journey had been long and arduous, covering about forty miles each day as they moved from one battleground to the next. Despite the challenges, it had been a thrilling experience, especially during the second week when the men encircled a vast area, gradually closing in towards the center. While some wolves managed to escape, the majority were hunted down, resulting in over four thousand of them being slain. The men collected the valuable wolf skins for various uses. The region had been plagued by these predators, causing harm to livestock and even attacking people. The wolves had multiplied due to harsh winters and ongoing conflicts in other areas. After this successful mission, there was hope that the wolves would stay away for some time. Upon his return, Beric was surprised to find a Druid in deep conversation with his mother, discussing urgent matters regarding the Roman governor's plans to eradicate their religion and oppress their people. The Druid emphasized the need for all Britons to unite and prepare for a significant conflict ahead. Beric, despite being young, expressed his readiness to defend his homeland and faith when the time came.|"[""1.

The Druid, full of enthusiasm, disregarded the need for immediate action. He assured the tribesmen that their gods would fight alongside them, emphasizing their strength in numbers and valor. The conversation between the Druid and Parta quickly spread among the tribesmen, igniting shouts of fury and demands for war against the Romans. The Druid, acknowledging the need for a chief, appointed Beric, the son of the last prince, to lead in battle. Beric, though young, had learned Roman tactics and was deemed fit for the role. The Druid urged the tribesmen to prepare for battle, learn from Roman discipline, and obey Beric. He warned against disobedience and emphasized the importance of deserving victory through preparation and discipline. Beric accepted his new role, promising to lead with wisdom and strength when the time came.|"['1.

That evening, a grand feast was held at Cardun. Parta, the leader, ordered the sacrifice of a bullock and three swine. Large jars of mead were opened for all to enjoy. While the tribe's leaders feasted inside, others celebrated outside. The tribe's bard sang tales of their greatness. Even women from distant villages joined, relieved that the threat of wolves had passed. Parta and her son mingled with the tribesmen, ensuring everyone was cared for. Beric, feeling the weight of unexpected responsibility, pondered the looming invasion. He feared a hasty uprising would only bring ruin. He believed victory required discipline and unity, qualities lacking among the Britons. While he respected his people's faith in their gods, he doubted divine intervention in battles, relying instead on courage and strategy. Beric admired his countrymen's simplicity and bravery, contrasting it with what he saw as Roman decadence and superstition.|"['1.

The day after discussing with some tribal leaders, a hundred men were called to gather the following day. They were selected from families with multiple able-bodied males to minimize disruption to work. Beric had observed Romans training in groups of a hundred and memorized their drills. The maneuvers were to form a six-deep fighting line and move in columns. However, the tribesmen found the exercises challenging. Beric explained the importance of precise movements for unity in battle. He emphasized that Romans' success was due to their disciplined coordination. Beric appointed Boduoc as his second and ten others as sergeants. After a week of intense training, the company improved significantly. Even skeptical chiefs acknowledged the benefits. Parta supported the training by providing food from her resources.|"[""1.

When the week ended, over two hundred additional men were called upon to join the ranks. The best and brightest from the initial group were selected as their leaders. Before the training started, the first group demonstrated their skills to show the newcomers what was expected. Chiefs also joined to learn the commands and become capable leaders. Beric was encouraged by this, knowing he needed strong officers to manage multiple companies. Training moved to the forest miles away from the village to keep their activities hidden from the Romans. Upon returning to Cardun, Beric found the women in mourning. Mona had been attacked, the Druids slaughtered, and the gods seemingly silent. This tragedy sparked a fierce determination among the Britons to resist the Romans. The news reached Camalodunum, where the Romans, emboldened by the events at Mona, oppressed the Britons further, stoking the flames of rebellion.|['1.

Beric was viewed with curiosity due to his extended stay among the Romans, sparking suspicion and rumors that he was promoting Rome's power to his tribe.

Prasutagus is no more; his queen and daughters have suffered greatly. A Roman has seized our wealth acquired through cowardice. But now, the time has come. The gods allowed their altars to be defiled so that a cry for vengeance may echo across the land. Vengeance is near for the oppressors and tyrants. The land is soaked in British blood. Our possessions, lives, and the honor of our women are disregarded. Our altars are desecrated, our priests slain. The time for retribution is upon us.

Meanwhile, in Camalodunum, tension rose as unease spread among the settlers. Some praised the Roman officials' actions, while others, aware of the Britons' strength, feared an imminent attack. The sudden silence from the officials added to the anxiety, compounded by reports of defiant native behavior. Decianus, sensing the discontent, left the city, leaving behind a sense of foreboding. An eerie omen, the falling of the Victory statue in the temple, deepened the Romans' fears, hinting at impending disaster.|"[""1.

The people of Camalodunum were in a state of fear and uncertainty. Rumors of Britons plotting against the city were spreading, fueled by the mysterious fall of Victory's statue and eerie occurrences like strange noises and the sight of a sunken town in the water. The residents were on edge, feeling the impending danger but not knowing its exact nature. Decianus, the leader, sent troops to fortify the Temple of Claudius, but the tension in the city continued to rise. With no news from Norwich and the ominous warnings of the British women, the citizens felt a growing sense of dread. Plans were discussed to seek refuge at the temple in case of an attack, but as the threat loomed, no concrete actions were taken, leaving the town vulnerable to the looming barbarian horde.|"[""**1.

One evening, a message arrived for Cneius, instructing him to prepare British attire for himself and Berenice. The note warned of imminent danger, advising them to stay indoors and be ready to disguise themselves at a moment's notice. Cneius, understanding the gravity of the situation, promptly acquired the garments as instructed. The next day, preparations for a gathering of the Iceni tribe commenced at Cardun. Men arrived early, bringing food supplies for several days. The atmosphere was charged with anticipation as the tribes assembled, led by their chiefs.

The comparison between the untamed warriors and the disciplined Roman soldiers was stark. Despite being smaller and less robust, the Roman legionaries exuded a confident aura of fighting prowess that seemed to guarantee their victory. They trusted not only in themselves but in their comrades, believing in the invincibility of their legion. Clad in regular armor, shields, and helmets, their united formation stood firm, ready to repel any undisciplined attacks. Beric, proud of his own tribe's strength and training, knew they could rival the Roman veterans with their superior physical abilities. His main concern was that in the heat of battle, they might forget their training and break formation. He emphasized the importance of unity and discipline, warning that any deviation from orders would not be tolerated. The night before the impending conflict, Boadicea arrived, her regal presence inspiring the tribesmen to prepare for vengeance. Throughout the night, songs of valor and tales of past heroes echoed around the fires, fueling the warriors' resolve. In Parta's hall, tribal leaders and bards gathered, sharing chants of unity and resistance. Beric, ensuring all were cared for, learned that Britain was ready to rise against their oppressors, with tribes from all regions poised to join the rebellion once the Iceni made their move.|"['1.

Beric, holding the conch, blew three short notes, summoning the tribesmen. Amid the chaos, they formed companies, ready for battle. The sound of the conch again, and the warriors moved forward in formation, their spears gleaming. Beric led the line, commanding the soldiers to step back, hurl their javelins, and charge. The tribesmen, though not as polished as the Romans, executed the maneuvers with vigor. Beric explained the strategy, emphasizing the need for discipline in combat. The queen acknowledged the effectiveness of the Roman tactics but valued the Britons' fierce fighting spirit. As they prepared to march towards Camalodunum, scouts reported the city's vulnerability. The Iceni readied for the attack, resting in the forest before the dawn assault. The Trinobantes' women confirmed the city's lack of defenses, setting the stage for the impending battle.|"['1.

Beric explained the plan to his men. When the attack began, they were to follow him and Boduoc, guarding two individuals until they reached the chariot. Beric assured them that if anyone tried to stop them, they must defend the captives at all costs. Once the captives were safe in the chariot, they could join the sack. Beric also made sure that all other arrangements were in place. The Iceni launched their attack before dawn, with each chief leading their men to their designated positions. The Sarci tribe, led by Beric, headed for the northern gate. They carried faggots to pile against the gates for a swift entry. As the light grew, a horn signaled the attack. The Sarci rushed forward, overwhelming the town. Beric's men protected the captives as they moved through the chaos, reaching Caius Muro's house and demanding to see Cneius.|"[""1.

Hurriedly ushering them out of the house, Beric instructed the men to form a protective circle around them before heading back. Chaos surrounded them - shouts, cries, and flames engulfed the village. Beric was relieved to reach the Sarci, his fellow Iceni, before encountering others. Ignoring their own kin, they swiftly made their way to the open gate. Beric ensured the safety of Berenice and Cneius by entrusting them to a chariot driver. Handing over a torque, a symbol of his authority, Beric instructed the driver to take them to a secure hideout. Beric, torn between his national hatred for the Romans and his personal sense of mercy, could not stop the massacre unfolding.

The destruction had begun in the town. The Britons, filled with hatred towards the Romans, looted little as they did not value Roman luxuries. They saved only weapons and gold ornaments, leaving nothing else behind. As each house was conquered, it was set ablaze, and the attackers moved on to find more victims. Beric, saddened by the loss of valuable manuscripts, saw the town engulfed in flames. Gathering his men, he prepared to attack the Temple of Claudius, but the Britons faced resistance from Roman soldiers. Boadicea, eager for revenge, planned to tear down the temple stone by stone. The Trinobantes, seeking independence, attempted to storm the temple but faced a tough defense.

For a while, the Trinobantes persisted, but eventually, their leaders realized the futility of their efforts and called off their followers. Boadicea, finding refuge in one of the remaining unburned houses, convened the chiefs. After deliberation, they decided to use heavy trees to break down the doors of the temple. The process was lengthy, requiring the felling and preparation of suitable trees. As night fell, the plan was postponed to the next day. Beric, absent from the council, doubted the success of the attack. The Trinobantes and Iceni were to assault the temple doors from each end. Beric, relieved to know the safety of the fugitives, reunited with his mother and discussed the upcoming battle plans.

At midnight, the temple's roof collapsed, leaving only bare walls and columns. The chiefs commanded their followers to regroup outside the town's defenses and rest until morning. At daybreak, the force, now fifty thousand strong, marched southward, joined by more tribes. Beric expressed uncertainty about defeating the Romans, emphasizing their discipline. Scouts reported the Romans' approach, prompting a council among the chiefs. The queen praised Beric's war knowledge and offered him the Sarci's leading position.

In the ancient battle, the Britons devised a plan to attack the Roman legion. The Trinobantes would strike from the right, the Iceni from the front, and the Sarci would wait for Beric's signal. As the Romans advanced, the Britons, led by Queen Boadicea, raised their weapons and charged with a deafening roar. The Romans, taken by surprise, formed a solid defense with spears and cavalry. Despite the fierce Briton attack, the Romans held their ground. Beric, noticing the Roman's disciplined formation, strategized to break their flank. The Sarci, armed and fearless, advanced in a calculated manner. With a unified battle cry, they charged the Roman flank, overpowering their defense. The Britons, with relentless courage, pushed the Romans back until their line broke, securing a hard-fought victory.|"[""1.

In a fierce battle, the Britons triumphed over the Roman soldiers who lay dead on the field. Beric and the cavalry were the only survivors, escaping to their camp. Boadicea praised Beric for the victory and urged the chiefs to pursue the Romans before they regrouped. The Britons quickly gathered Roman weapons as trophies. Boadicea planned to seek vengeance on Catus Decianus, the Roman leader. The Britons, wearing Roman armor they had seized, marched towards the Roman camp. A council was held to discuss the next steps. Each able-bodied man had a say in decisions, reflecting the Britons' belief in equality.

The council met with lively discussions. Most chiefs preferred avoiding the challenging position and targeting easier places for conquest. The British warriors mainly fought for riches. After the initial rampage at Camalodunum, they now craved the spoils of Roman cities. The chiefs argued against risking more lives and planned to march towards Verulamium and then London. Beric supported an immediate attack, but the majority favored delaying the assault on Roman garrisons until after defeating Suetonius. Beric and Aska discussed the uncertainty of the upcoming battle's outcome. The tribes eventually captured and destroyed Verulamium, deciding to march west to gather more allies before facing Suetonius. However, they later learned that Suetonius had bypassed them, prompting a change in plans. Beric regretted not attacking the Roman garrisons individually to weaken Suetonius' forces.|"['1.

The Britons were confident of victory as they advanced towards London, expecting a battle with Suetonius. However, upon reaching the city, they found it abandoned by the Romans. Beric, who was not present during the sack of London, noticed the disarray among the tribesmen. They had abandoned military order and were no longer marching as a disciplined unit. Beric, though disappointed, understood the fickle nature of his people. He knew that they would need to be organized and disciplined when facing the Romans, who would outnumber them significantly. Beric left the army to check on his friends Berenice and Cneius Nepo. He arrived at Boduoc's mother's cottage, where he was warmly welcomed.

"""What is the news, Beric?"" Cneius inquired. ""No word has reached us.

Beric paused, considering the situation. ""We are more than one hundred and fifty thousand men against ten thousand, but the ten thousand are soldiers, while the hundred and fifty thousand are a mob. Brave and devoted, and fearless of death I admit, but still a mob. I cannot say how it will go."" Beric then assured Cneius of a plan for her safety, mentioning a ship to Gaul.

Beric and his mother, Aska, prepared for the looming battle against the Romans. Aska, determined to fight alongside her son, expressed her resolve to face the Romans head-on. Beric, however, understood the challenges they faced against the Roman forces and the importance of strategic retreat if needed. As the Britons gathered and Boadicea rallied the troops, the women and wagons formed a semicircle to witness the impending clash. Beric noticed the potential danger in the setup, realizing that retreat might be hindered by the wagons if the battle turned against them.

A loud shout rose, mixed with cheers from the women, as the Britons charged towards the Romans. The Sarci joined the rush, causing chaos. Beric, Aska, and Boduoc's commands calmed the men. The battle raged, with Britons trying to break the Roman line. Despite efforts, the Romans stood firm. Beric's attempts to break through failed. As the Romans advanced, panic spread among the Britons. Beric led his men to safety, urging them to stay together. They escaped through the wagons as the Romans closed in. Beric decided to head north to regroup. The noise of the battle faded as they trotted away. The plain was chaotic with fleeing women and men. Roman cavalry approached as they maintained their pace.

As Aska raised his arms in despair, he spoke of the dire situation they faced. The wagons had trapped them, preventing escape. Beric believed that without the wagons, many could have fled to safety. However, the carts, filled with women, had blocked their path. The Roman horsemen quickly closed in on them. Beric's band hurried into the woods, leaving behind the chaos and sorrow. As they paused in the safety of the woods, grief overwhelmed them. Beric hoped that his mother, who might have escaped with the queen, was safe. Aska feared the queen's fate. He believed she would choose her own end over Roman capture. Beric knew his mother would stand by the queen till the end. Aska rallied the men, praising their bravery and urging them to regroup.

After consuming the poison, the men were instructed to leave for an hour and return. Upon their return, they found the women deceased, encircling Boadicea. They were laid to rest in shallow graves, concealed with turf and leaves to keep their location hidden from the Romans. Beric, despite expecting his mother's passing, was deeply affected by the news. Aska comforted him, emphasizing that death is not mourned among the Britons as the departed are believed to find joy in the afterlife.

The men who often visit the village are usually familiar with the locals and can speak a bit of the language. Sometimes, young women from the village have taken a liking to these men and left with them, never to return. Although messages have come saying they are well, none have ever come back. It is believed that these traders are the offspring of women who integrated into their society long ago. The village serves as a central trading hub where women from nearby hamlets bring their woven cloth to exchange for goods. Meanwhile, the Fenmen bring fish and wildfowl for trade. Aska and Beric, the chiefs, seek refuge in the Fens for their people and offer gifts of cattle to establish friendship. The Fenmen are hesitant, fearing trouble from strangers and questioning the need to leave their land. Aska and Beric offer Roman jewelry as gifts, which the Fenmen accept gratefully.

After walking through the swampy soil for thirty minutes, Aska and Beric reached the edge of a slow-moving stream. Tied to a bush was a boat made of basket work covered with hide, equipped with two long poles. The men boarded the boat, pushed out into the stream, and disappeared among the dense grove of rushes and bushes. Aska and Beric returned to the village, discussing the mysterious swamps to the north. The Iceni had tried to explore them before but were met with fierce resistance. The inhabitants of the swamps lived in scattered pairs, surviving on fishing and fowling. Rumors spoke of monstrous creatures inhabiting the swamps, deterring intruders. Beric proposed settling in the area to clear out these creatures. They discussed the challenges of moving their cattle through the morasses and the potential for trade with the Fenmen. Later, they encountered boats carrying the chiefs of the Fenmen, leading to a conversation about the challenges of granting the Iceni's request to settle in the swamps.|"['1.

"""Swords like the ones we sent you are valuable,"" Aska explained. ""They're Roman-made and far superior to ours. With one of those, you could clear as many saplings in a day as needed to build a hut and defend against any wild beasts lurking in your swamps.

Aska agreed to the terms proposed by the Fenmen, promising them grain in exchange for swords, spearheads, and arrowheads if they fell short. The Fenmen, initially wary of allowing strangers into their land, changed their minds when offered a deal to occupy a feared area in the swamps. Legends of monsters and serpents in the region had kept them away, but the potential gains from the agreement outweighed their fears. They accepted the terms, allowing the strangers to enter and even offering assistance against potential Roman attacks. As preparations were made, Aska discussed plans with Beric, ensuring the safety of women and other refugees. The villagers also decided to join the group in the swamps for protection, while others were advised to seek shelter elsewhere. Spread the word, Aska instructed, that a refuge was being formed for those willing to fight against the Romans.|"['1.

The villagers decided to trade their stores of grain for gold ornaments with Beric, who would then buy cattle from the Brigantes. They left their swine and cattle in the woods to be fetched later. Aska, Beric, and Boduoc planned to transport the grain and cattle by boat to safety. They fortified their position near the river junction, expecting Roman interference. The women and children were to follow, with a guide leading them through the swampy terrain. The group reached the riverbank, where they prepared for the boats' arrival. Beric distributed goods to the villagers and received shields from the chiefs. After bidding farewell to the natives, Beric's party set off down the river, navigating through the waterways.

"""It's good,"" he said, ""I don't want my men scared by tales of monsters. I don't believe in them, though maybe long ago, monsters lived here. If something comes, we'll know how to fight it. But it's dark enough here to make men uneasy without anything else to shake their courage."" Eventually, they reached a spot where the bank was slightly above the water. Several other Fenmen had been shouting to Beric's boatmen, and their boats had fallen behind. So, Beric decided to land. The boats were called up, supplies were unloaded, and the men stepped ashore, while the boatmen quickly paddled downstream. A spot was chosen, bushes cleared, and a fire started. The men's spirits lifted as the flames crackled. They cooked meat over the fire, ate, and passed around jars of beer. Beric dismissed the tales of monsters, saying they were likely just legends. The night passed peacefully, and the next morning, they set out to explore the land, finding large snake bones that amazed them."|"[""1.

"Beric reassured everyone, ""Don't worry, the creature has long been dead. Its thick skin has decayed, and it likely died curled up here, the last of its kind. We'll search the island together and be ready for anything we find."" The group finished their search late, returning to camp sure there were no more creatures. As evening fell the next day, they heard shouts and saw the Fenmen's boats approaching. Beric told them of the dead serpent, keeping up the island's fearsome reputation.

Beric nodded in agreement, acknowledging the need to fortify their defenses against the advancing Romans. He advised strengthening the intrenchment and building a bank behind it to defend against any breach. Beric suggested constructing more boats, larger and sturdier, to transport men and supplies swiftly. He emphasized the importance of preparing for unexpected attacks by gathering resources like cattle, swine, and grain from abandoned villages. Beric also recommended training fighting men and organizing flatboats to carry troops efficiently.

The swamps in the area had been fully explored, leading to the discovery of another island where three hundred men settled, while four hundred remained on the main island, and another four hundred in a camp by the river. The total population included over a thousand women and children spread across these three locations. Work had been ongoing, with three hundred men completing the construction of boats. The Iceni people, skilled in fishing and fowling, traded with the Fenmen and other swamp communities for food. They also built coracles and utilized cattle skins for boat coverings. As the Romans advanced, the Iceni planned to resist strategically, engaging in small skirmishes rather than direct confrontations to tire out the Roman forces in the extensive swamplands.|['1.

Aska led a group of men up the Ouse in large boats, discovering about 2,000 men with twice as many women and children in the upper swamps. These people lacked provisions and were in dire need. Most of their cattle were lost, and they were unable to venture out due to the presence of horsemen near Huntingdon. Aska reported that these were fugitives from battle, lacking a leader and a plan. Beric decided to help them and sent twenty large boats with supplies up the river. They rescued women and children, and Beric planned an attack on the Roman camp. He split his force, with Boduoc leading one group to attack the camp from different sides while Beric's group approached by boat.

Beric advised constructing huts above wet soil using trees and lashings. The Iceni had established trade with neighboring tribes and were prepared for Roman incursions. When Roman soldiers approached in boats, the Iceni swiftly mobilized, ambushing the Romans at their camp. Beric led a successful attack, breaching the Roman defenses and seizing control of the camp.

Despite the sudden attack, the Roman legionaries stood firm under their officers' command, forming a solid defense against the Britons who fiercely assaulted them. Beric and his warriors arrived, adding to the Britons' force, overwhelming the Romans with a powerful charge. A fierce battle ensued, but the Britons' numbers and strength prevailed. The Romans were defeated, and Huntingdon was set ablaze. Beric's strategy to divide and plunder the Roman supplies succeeded. The Romans returning by boat faced taunts from unseen Britons, while the town of Huntingdon lay in ruins. The Romans realized the severity of the situation, prompting urgent messages to their commander, Suetonius. The Romans began to fortify their camp, recognizing the challenges posed by the Britons' tactics in the vast swamps. Suetonius assessed the situation, understanding the need to contain the Britons within a limited area. Orders were dispatched for reinforcements and strategic clearing of the marshland.|"['1.

When the Romans' plans became clear, the British camp near the river junction was deserted. The Romans had a massive workforce that could have easily built roads to reach the camp. Even though the British could have held out for a while, they knew they would eventually fall. The Romans also used their boats to cut off the British garrison's escape route. Over two months, thirty thousand workers, watched by Roman soldiers, cleared the swamps east of the Ouse. As winter arrived, the Romans faced challenges due to wet weather and failed attempts to set fire to the brushwood. Later, with frost and snow, the Romans entered the swamps near Huntingdon and headed north. When the Romans crossed the river, the Britons, led by Beric and Aska, were ready to fight. The Britons used shields made of wicker and ox hide to protect themselves. They cleverly defended the channels with felled trees as bridges for retreat. The Romans faced fierce opposition and suffered heavy losses. Suetonius, the Roman commander, realized the difficulty of the task ahead. He sought advice from his legion commanders on how to advance with less loss.|"['1.

"The two officers fell quiet. ""The resistance might weaken,"" one mentioned after a long pause. ""We've heard from the locals that they don't have more than three thousand fighting men, and they must have suffered losses like us."" Suetonius shook his head. ""As we moved forward,"" he noted, ""I saw one British body for every four Romans. We shoot randomly, while they can see us from their hiding spots. Even when they charge, our archers can't help much as the fighting is in the bushes. Nevertheless, we'll keep pushing for a while. The locals behind us need to clear the ground as we advance. Each step forward is progress."" Throughout the night, the British attacked the Romans thrice. The fighting went on for four days, and the Romans, despite losing over a thousand men, advanced eight miles. Eventually, they were exhausted and decided to retreat due to the challenging terrain and changing weather. The Britons were content with their success and did not pursue the Romans. In the spring, they prepared for a water attack, obstructing the channels and inflicting heavy losses on the Romans.

"""They view us as intruders in their country,"" Aska stated, ""and likely believe we will eventually rule over them. If they turn against us, they could guide the Romans straight to our islands, risking everything."" Beric disagreed, ""We have no quarrel with them now. We must act fairly and avoid conflict, or we risk inviting Roman interference. We must win their trust and show we mean no harm. However, we must stay vigilant against betrayal."" As another month passed, the Romans stayed in their forts. The locals were now on the western side, clearing the swamp with Roman protection.

For hours, a fierce battle raged between the Romans and the defenders of the intrenchments. The defenders, armed with spears, repelled the attackers trying to scale the bank, while others showered arrows and javelins. When the Romans breached the palisade, a sword fight ensued. Beric, the leader, strategically divided his force. As the conflict intensified, a Roman trumpet signaled reinforcements emerging from the bushes. Beric blew the retreat signal, and the defenders swiftly withdrew. Despite the outnumbered resistance, the defenders valiantly fought until the Romans breached the intrenchment. The women and boys, armed with makeshift weapons, joined the defense. The Romans suffered heavy losses but eventually overpowered the defenders.

Boduoc and the other prisoners were angry about being captured. The Britons were not afraid of dying, but being captured was seen as shameful. They felt it was a terrible tragedy to be spared while their comrades were killed and their families slaughtered. Beric had mixed feelings. He would have chosen death over capture, but his time with the Romans had changed his views. He didn't see being captured as dishonorable since it was not his choice. Despite feeling this way, he wondered why they were spared. He thought maybe they were kept alive to show Rome's power over the Britons. Boduoc was furious and felt they should have been killed rather than made captives. Beric, on the other hand, believed they were taken as a sign of respect for their bravery. He urged his companions to show their strength by not letting captivity break their spirits.|"[""1.

Boduoc praised Beric for his wise words by the ancient oak. The group, including Beric and Boduoc, were held captive and tended to for their wounds. They were then escorted to Camalodunum by Roman troops. Beric speculated on their fate, suggesting they might be taken to Rome as proof of Roman victory. Boduoc mused on the fate of captives in Roman hands, unsure if they would be treated as ordinary prisoners of war or turned into gladiators. Beric found solace in the thought of seeing Rome despite his captivity.

Many new arrivals were amazed at the sight of the towering natives, led by a youth named Beric, a renowned chief captured through treachery. Despite being bound, these men exuded fearless dignity. Suetonius, having suffered heavy losses from Beric's tribe, wished to take them as captives to Rome. Petronius, however, preferred a less severe approach to encourage peace. Beric, having spent time among the Romans, was seen as intelligent and tractable. Suetonius, eager to depart the island after facing constant battles, planned to sail soon. The captives, under guard but treated well, were led to a house. Beric pledged they wouldn't escape, leading to their bonds being removed. Eventually, a meal was sent to them, and they were taken to meet Petronius and Suetonius.|"['1.

Beric believed that the Romans valued freedom and independence, and he expressed how the Britons were treated unfairly by Catus Decianus. Beric mentioned the unjust deeds of Decianus, like seizing Boadicea's property and ordering her to be scourged. Petronius acknowledged the grievances and aimed to lessen them by offering an amnesty to those who rose against Rome. He sought peace and promised that surrendering Britons would be treated fairly. Beric suggested a way to convince his people to surrender by having Petronius swear an oath of peace before them. Petronius agreed to Beric's plan and decided to take an oath the next day at the temple. This gesture aimed to bring peace and reconciliation between the Britons and the Romans.|['1.

Beric was certain that the new Roman messenger had been sent to correct the harm caused by Suetonius and Decianus. He believed the Romans were sincere in wanting peace and prosperity in the land. Although Beric was a captive, he refused to accept mercy from Rome as it would be seen as betrayal by his people. He felt that accepting terms now would be seen as a sign of weakness and disloyalty. Despite being captives, Beric and his fellow Iceni warriors held their heads high, knowing they had fought bravely and with honor. Beric selected four messengers to convey the message of peace to their people, ensuring that those with no family ties would go. The Romans, led by Petronius, swore an oath of peace and freedom to the Britons, allowing them to return to their villages and lands without interference.|['1.

"""Enough blood has been shed on both sides,"" he said. ""It is time for peace. You have proved yourselves worthy and valiant enemies; let us now lay aside the sword and live together in friendship. I sent orders last night for the legions to leave their forts by the Fenland and to return hither, so that the way is now open to your own land. We can settle the terms of the tribute hereafter, but it shall not be onerous.""

After leaving the temple, Beric delivered his messages to the men, and they promptly set off under an escort for the camp, with instructions to travel alone to their countrymen by boat. That evening, Petronius summoned Beric and spoke to him in private. ""I am sorry,"" he said, ""that I cannot return you and your companions to your tribe, but Suetonius has captured you, and to him you belong. I have appealed to him to release you, but he has refused. I have also written to friends in Rome, emphasizing your efforts for peace.""

The next day, the captives were mustered and taken to a ship. There were six vessels prepared for the journey to Rome. The Britons were amazed by the size of the ships, having never seen such vessels before. ""You could sail to Rome,"" Beric explained, ""but we will travel by foot from Gaul.""

Beric and Boduoc discussed the Roman dominion over Britain. Beric admired the Roman empire's arts, laws, and wisdom but warned that too much focus on peace could weaken Rome. Boduoc preferred a life of freedom in nature, hunting, and fighting. As they journeyed towards Rome, the guards shared stories about the city. One officer befriended Beric and offered him a stay with his relatives in Massilia. The officer's uncle, a magistrate and scholar, studied religions worldwide.

Upon entering Massilia, the Britons marveled at its vastness and the diverse mix of people on its streets. Even Boduoc, who usually showed indifference towards Roman matters, was astonished to see a black man accompanying a Roman lady. Beric explained that across the southern seas, there were even darker-skinned people. He mentioned that these black men were highly valued as slaves in Rome for their good nature and obedience. The group was soon taken to a prison but later granted permission to stay at Pollio's wealthy uncle's house. Pollio's uncle expressed interest in learning about the Britons' customs and religion, sharing his observation of similar practices in Gaul.

Pollio mentioned how he had rescued Beric from a lengthy conversation about his people's religion and customs with his uncle. Lesbia, annoyed by her husband's interest in such matters, often traveled instead of staying in Rome. Norbanus, immovable in his curiosity, insisted on discussing these topics. Beric, a young Briton, impressed the Roman family with his courteous manner at the dinner table. The girls found it remarkable that Beric, known for his fierce reputation, was so pleasant. They planned to visit other Britons with Pollio the next day. Norbanus engaged Beric in deep conversations about religion, revealing his philosophical views on various beliefs. He praised the Britons' monotheistic beliefs and criticized Roman and Jewish faiths for their limitations. Norbanus believed the new sect's doctrine of equality could lead to conflict with the state due to its anti-war stance.|"[""1.

Norbanus agreed, stating that the priests' insurrection, not religion, caused issues. He mentioned Rome's temples for conquered nations' deities and the new sect's freedom. Norbanus shared his slaves' sect membership, valuing their morals. He allowed them to attend gatherings peacefully. The Romans debated Christian persecution, but Norbanus defended the harmless sect. He believed interfering would harm valuable slaves. The conversation shifted to bards and their role in preserving traditions. Beric learned much from Norbanus, impressed by his knowledge.

Beric stood firm before Emperor Nero and his court, refusing to fight for their amusement. The emperor, impressed by the Britons' demeanor, admired their bravery. Nero decided to send Beric and his men to gladiator school for training. Beric knew the importance of strategy in warfare, having learned from Roman military books. He hoped for peace but was forced to fight for survival against Suetonius. Nero saw potential in Beric and his men as gladiators, planning to train them for two years before showcasing their skills. Beric, aware of the political climate, knew that much could change before their training was complete. Despite Nero's popularity among the masses, he faced opposition from the upper classes.

Realizing escape was unlikely, he decided to focus on building strength and combat skills until the time came to face the arena. The training began gradually, with exercises to enhance muscle strength and endurance.

Beric and Pollio explored the vast wonders of Rome, including its grand libraries filled with ancient manuscripts. Pollio, a humble man, preferred the company of historians over the deep philosophical writings. As they ventured into a library, they witnessed scribes from different backgrounds diligently copying manuscripts. These scribes, some slaves and others freedmen, worked tirelessly to reproduce popular works by authors like Caesar, Tacitus, and the poets Horace and Virgil. The library was a hub of activity, with scribes from various nationalities translating texts into Latin or other languages. Beric, intrigued by the vast knowledge stored in these manuscripts, eagerly delved into the world of books, despite jests from his fellow gladiators. Lupus, a formidable Roman gladiator, harbored animosity towards Beric and his companions, resenting their camaraderie and Beric's growing interest in reading.|"['1.

Beric took the teasing well, but Boduoc, understanding the insults in Latin, intervened and threw Lupus to the ground. Lupus retaliated by grabbing a knife, but Scopus intervened and restrained Lupus, warning him against causing trouble. Lupus, feeling humiliated, challenged Beric to a fight.

It took Lupus more than a week to return to the gymnasium after his setback. Beric had asked others not to mention it, but Lupus's dominance was no more, solidifying Beric's standing in the school. While Beric focused on his workouts and studies, Boduoc and his friends were content. They learned Latin, useful for communication and gym activities. Beric advised them to learn it quickly for practical reasons. The group excelled in wrestling and boxing, pleasing their trainer Scopus. Beric preferred these sports over others, finding the caestus unnecessary. Scopus planned to pit a Briton against a skilled opponent to test their abilities.

Nero had a grand vision to transform Rome into a magnificent city with spacious streets and a majestic palace surrounded by gardens and parks. After a devastating fire, he initiated plans to rebuild the city on a grand scale. The people were temporarily housed in the emperor's gardens, and food was provided from various sources. Contributions were sought from towns under Roman rule to fund the reconstruction. Skilled workers from different regions were employed, and Greece sent artisans to assist in the rebuilding efforts. Despite the financial strain on the empire, the reconstruction progressed rapidly, providing work for all. The new city boasted broad streets and impressive buildings, filling the population with pride.

After the gladiatorial contest, a tense pause filled the arena. The audience anticipated the next spectacle - Christians facing lions. An elderly man and his two sons refused to worship Jupiter's image, choosing death over dishonor. As the lions entered, the family stood singing. The lions, hesitant at first, circled the arena, then approached the family. The crowd fell silent as the lions attacked the Christians.

Ennia stood firm, tears rolling down her cheeks, as she refused to recant her faith despite the pleas from her parents and Emperor Nero. She bravely declared her allegiance to the Lord who sacrificed for her. Nero, taken aback by her resolve, tried to reason with her, questioning her defiance against Rome's gods. Ennia, although young, remained steadfast, citing her strength in her faith. As the audience sympathized with her, a new challenge arose.

"Nero waited until the cheers stopped and then said, ""The people have spoken, let their will be done.

Beric turned pale but remained composed. ""Thanks, Caesar. I accept the conditions,"" he said firmly. He wrapped himself in a cloak, surprising the audience.

The angry gladiator leaped at Scopus, who swiftly grabbed him and threw him down with such strength that he couldn't get up until Porus helped him. Scopus then ignored him and guided Beric into the shop. A sip of warm milk revived Beric, who suggested a walk, but Scopus insisted he sit for a while.

Beric recounted to Aemilia his encounter with Ennia and the old slave, revealing the attack they faced on their way home from their secret meeting place. He expressed regret for not being able to protect Ennia due to his absence during a fire and subsequent journey to the Alban Hills. Beric admired Ennia's courage in facing death by lions rather than renouncing her Christian faith. Aemilia, feeling isolated in her grief over Ennia's fate, sought to understand Ennia's decision to embrace Christianity. Beric reassured Aemilia that time would heal her sorrow and that she would find happiness again. Aemilia expressed her desire to avenge Ennia's death, but Beric vowed to stay out of harm's way by avoiding the tyrant's cruel commands.

Beric was led to a charming room by Phaon, with no windows but beautifully painted walls and a basin in the ceiling for light. Bronze statues and elegant couches decorated the space. Phaon explained the layout, cautioning against having anyone else stay in the adjacent room, as it was close to Nero's private apartment. Next, they entered the library, where manuscripts were neatly stored in wooden cases. Beric met Chiton, a Greek man who seemed honest. Phaon detailed the proximity to Caesar's private rooms and the bell system for summoning Beric. His duties in the library would end when Nero went to the baths, leaving him free until supper. Beric would be on call at night, with his sword nearby.

Beric had a request for Caesar. He wanted his childhood friend, Boduoc, to join him as a guard in the palace. Beric believed that having Boduoc by his side would help him fulfill his duty as Caesar's guard more effectively.

Beric, a guard of Emperor Nero, was in high favor at the palace. He refused bribes and avoided meddling in others' affairs, except to help those treated unfairly. Beric enjoyed Nero's friendship and discussed art and society with him. He preferred not to dwell on Nero's darker side, focusing on the kinder aspects he observed. Beric chose to remain ignorant of political turmoil, keeping his interactions light and avoiding serious topics.

Norbanus and Lesbia agreed with Beric's rationale. Norbanus showed little interest in his surroundings while Lesbia was engrossed in current politics due to her connections with noble families. Aware of Nero's possible wrath towards nobles, she advised her friends to avoid political talks in Beric's presence.

Nero, the Roman emperor, believed that to protect oneself from danger, one must eliminate threats. Beric, a British guard, understood this and focused on guarding Nero against conspirators and assassins. Despite Nero's trust in Beric, he kept a close watch on him, noting his actions and interactions. Beric's honesty and loyalty earned him Nero's confidence. However, Beric found his restricted leisure time burdensome due to his increased responsibilities. Nero's paranoia heightened after a real conspiracy was uncovered, leading to widespread executions. Beric, although favored by Nero, felt uneasy amid the corruption and excesses of the Roman court. The lavish lifestyle and moral decay in Rome troubled many, including Beric, as they witnessed the empire's decline under Nero's rule.|"['1.

The Britons found the excessive luxury and moral decay around them monstrous. Beric, despite being a captive, found solace in studying Greek and reading with Chiton and Norbanus. Lesbia, his love interest, lived a life of dissipation against Norbanus' wishes. Norbanus, concerned about Aemilia, refused a marriage proposal for her from Nero's associate. He then turned to Beric, expressing his trust and offering Aemilia's hand in marriage when the times were more stable. Beric hesitated due to the uncertain future and danger posed by Rufinus. He expressed his love for Aemilia but felt the current state of affairs, including Nero's tyranny, made marriage risky. Beric proposed a betrothal with Aemilia, delaying marriage until a safer time, respecting her voice in the decision.|"['1.

At six o'clock, Beric came back to the house where a group of guests were gathered in the atrium. Some were Norbanus' family members, and others were his office colleagues, all respected individuals. Beric was familiar to most of them from previous gatherings at the house. After everyone was present, Norbanus left briefly and returned holding Aemilia's hand. He announced that they were there to witness the betrothal of his daughter to Beric. The notary, Vitrio, read the formal document outlining the terms of the betrothal. Norbanus relinquished his authority over Aemilia to Beric, promising a dowry and inheritance. Both parties signed the agreement, witnessed by four guests. Just then, Lesbia burst in objecting to the betrothal, but Norbanus stood firm, asserting that the matter was settled. Lesbia's threats were met with composure by Norbanus.

"A week later, Boduoc stood guard at ten in the evening. Laughter and revelry echoed from the distant banqueting hall. Annoyed, he felt out of place as a Briton guarding while festivities went on inside. Suddenly, a court attendant approached and announced, ""Caesar requests Beric the Briton's presence in the banqueting hall."" Beric instructed his companion Philo to follow him discreetly. He then entered the hall filled with people in festive attire, adorned with flowers and roses. Nero, in a drunken state, demanded to see the rumored paragon Beric guarded.

Beric, a brave British chief, stood firm against the Roman soldiers in the palace hall. Refusing to bring his promised Roman wife into such dishonorable surroundings, he defended her honor against Caesar's wishes. When faced with Rufinus, who drew a dagger, Beric swiftly disarmed him and threw him against a pillar, rendering him unconscious. As chaos erupted, Beric and his loyal follower Boduoc fought off the Praetorian guards. Despite the odds, they managed to defeat several soldiers before being outnumbered. Beric then ordered a retreat, urging his men to escape through the garden. With his sword drawn, Beric valiantly guarded their retreat as they made their way to safety.|"['1.

Beric and his companions swiftly dashed through the passage, Beric's room, a lengthy corridor, and descended stairs leading to a vast garden resembling a grand park. The commotion in the palace faded as they raced across the park, halting at a door in the wall secured with a key Beric had obtained earlier. After ensuring their safety, Beric instructed his friends to disperse discreetly towards the road to the Alban Hills, reuniting beyond the city outskirts. Relieved to escape what felt like enslavement, they armed themselves and set off for the ludus of Scopus in the Alban Hills. Beric aimed to gather a modest group, avoiding a large rebellion against Rome. With Norbanus's daughter's message to join him whenever possible, Beric received a bag of gold and set off with his companions to the mountains, planning to live as outlaws, hunting for survival.|"['1.

Beric had a dangerous encounter with Rufinus, who Nero sent to attack him. In self-defense, Beric threw Rufinus against a pillar, and it seemed that Rufinus was killed. Fearing Nero's retaliation, Beric and his countrymen fought the Praetorians, slaying around thirty of them. After the fierce battle, Beric decided to escape to the mountains. When offered help by Scopus, Beric declined to take the whole band, not wanting to endanger them. Instead, he requested to take Porus, a valued member of the troop, who desired freedom. Beric proposed a plan to safely take Porus without raising suspicion. Scopus agreed to Beric's request and offered Porus to him.

Beric and his band of escaped gladiators met a group of Gauls, also on the run. The Gauls were impressed by Beric's reputation and offered to join forces. They all headed up the mountain, eventually reaching a hidden camp in a ravine. The Gauls explained their system of lookouts to avoid Roman soldiers. The groups shared a meal of wild boar and discussed their situation. The Gauls asked Beric to lead them, recognizing his skills and experience. Beric agreed but set strict rules against harming innocent people. He wanted to live freely in the mountains, only fighting Romans if necessary.

Gatho, you will still be my second-in-command with your Gauls, while Boduoc will lead the Britons. Sometimes we may need to split up, especially when food is scarce and we grow to a hundred strong. I want no criminals or troublemakers among us, only free men willing to defend our freedom. The Gauls embraced these ideals. The next day, more men were on watch, hunting in small groups. They felt alive again, enjoying the mountains. Porus, the Syrian, suggested he go down to gather news, as he could blend in better. Beric agreed, knowing Rome would search for them.

A stack of dry wood had been placed on a rock a mile away to serve as a signal beacon for the returning hunters. Beric wanted to assess the enemy's strength to avoid unnecessary conflict. After scouting, he reported back that there were a hundred heavy armed troops and a hundred archers and slingers. Beric decided it was time to move and instructed his men to gather what supplies they could and extinguish the fire to avoid detection. He sent scouts to monitor the Romans' movements while the group prepared to relocate. The Romans were thorough in their search, and Beric knew they needed to act swiftly.

Beric, the leader, decided to head south immediately to avoid being pursued by the Romans. He was relieved they hadn't lit a fire, which could have alerted the enemy. With the moon yet to rise, they rested until it was safe to move. Beric, vigilant, ensured their safety during the night. As they journeyed through the rugged terrain, Beric kept watch for any signs of danger. The group, now larger with others seeking refuge, continued southward, seeking shelter in the wild hills of Bruttium. Beric declined command of the entire group to prevent food scarcity, instead leading a smaller force to a remote location.

Beric addressed his companions, discussing their need for supplies as they hid from the Romans. He suggested using a local farmer as their agent to procure food and goods. This farmer, with his family as hostages, would fetch supplies from nearby towns. Porus was chosen to lead this mission. The next day, Porus set out with three gladiators, resembling locals, and successfully secured a source for regular provisions. With huts built and hunting parties organized, the fugitives lived quietly. Beric had entrusted his money to reliable individuals in Rome to ensure funds were available. After four months in Bruttium, he sent Philo to Rome to check on their stored supplies and communicate with Aemilia, disguised as a well-to-do farmer's son on a mission to purchase land.|"['1.

Beric proposed a strategy of constant harassment, using the landscape to their advantage. He instilled confidence in the group, assuring them that they could hold their ground and even escape to fight another day. The group, once disheartened, now felt empowered and eager to face the Romans in battle, fueled by their deep-seated hatred for Rome.

In the rugged mountains, Beric and his band prepared for the impending clash with the Roman legions. Skilled archers and craftsmen readied their weapons, while obstacles were set up to impede the Roman advance. Beric reassured his wife, Aemilia, of his safety and resolve to resist the Romans. As the Romans approached, the gladiators launched a fierce defense, using arrows and ambush tactics. The Romans faced heavy losses as they struggled to penetrate the wooded terrain. Despite the Roman's fortified camp, the gladiators continued their relentless resistance, attacking from unseen vantage points. The Romans were met with a barrage of rocks and arrows, forcing them to proceed cautiously. The night was filled with war cries and ambushes, keeping the Roman soldiers on edge.

On the third day, the Romans marched forward after a restless night. Surprisingly, there was no resistance this time. Moving cautiously, they pondered the eerie silence. Later that day, the reason for the quiet was unveiled. Beric, aware of the Romans' custom of carrying provisions, had outsmarted them. Under the cover of night, Beric's men ambushed the Roman convoy carrying supplies. A horn sounded, signaling an attack. The Romans were outnumbered and overwhelmed by Beric's warriors. The animals carrying provisions were seized, the supplies distributed, and the rest destroyed. The Romans, caught off guard, suffered heavy losses. The Romans, puzzled by the absence of their convoy, sent troops to investigate, only to discover the disastrous outcome. The Romans faced a formidable opponent in Beric, whose tactics and knowledge of the terrain gave him a significant advantage.|"['1.

Muro, a Roman commander, faced challenges in the mountains from gladiators. The Romans struggled to advance due to constant attacks on their supplies. Muro proposed either establishing camps at the mountains' base to restrict the gladiators or clearing the forests to starve them out. He expressed concern that the gladiators might escape to Sicily. Despite Rome's belief in progress, Muro felt the war was at a standstill. He suggested using treachery to defeat the gladiators. The Romans were fatigued and demoralized, making progress difficult.

Muro's advice was followed, and the victorious gladiators watched as the soldiers descended from the mountains to the plains below. Despite losing only three hundred men, their triumphant cheers echoed through the woods, reaching the retreating Romans. The Roman strategy soon became clear. Camps were fortified in the plains on both sides of the hills, and Muro stationed himself at Rhegium with two thousand legionaries. Beric led the gladiators back to their camp, cautioning Aemilia that their challenges were far from over. Famine threatened as supplies dwindled, prompting raids for food. Beric foresaw the risks ahead, including potential betrayals and Roman advances. The villagers' loyalty wavered, and the gladiators faced increasing peril. Beric's leadership and foresight were tested as the Romans closed in, pushing the group to consider drastic measures for survival.|"['1.

In Rhegium, life was more pleasant than usual. Many wealthy Romans avoided Nero's court by staying at their coastal villas near the town. Berenice had joined Pollio at Muro's villa, enjoying the moonlit water views. Berenice shared her concerns about Beric, who had intertwined with their lives. Beric had saved Berenice in Britain and fought against Suetonius. News of Beric's actions in Rome had reached them, including his bravery in the arena at Nero's court.

To stay informed and alert, they split into small groups and established signals for enemy sightings.

The senate declared Galba as emperor just before Nero's death, but the outcome remains uncertain. Various generals and regions may support different leaders.

Galba is already supreme there, and thence you can travel as a Roman official of high rank. I will, of course, furnish you with means to do so.""
