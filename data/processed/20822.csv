""Well, we thought you might find them useful for your upcoming hike,"" Marcia said, blushing with joy. ""And I'm thrilled that you like them, if you truly do, because I helped select them.

"""We'll show her how wrong she is!"" exclaimed Marcia, passionately. ""If only she had come along, she would have seen the truth herself.

They were stuck, even though they weren't really in danger. The guards stood between them and the path, blocking any attempt to sneak past without being noticed. Bessie thought about their options. She believed they could surprise the guards and slip away to the beach safely. But if they did, the men would realize their plans were exposed, losing the upper hand. Bessie felt it was wiser to wait, hoping the guards would fall asleep together, giving them a chance to escape unseen.

"""Be still, you'll be fine,"" ordered the man holding them. Bessie couldn't cry out as his hand covered her mouth. Glancing at Zara, who had fainted, Bessie felt even more helpless. Carried up the yacht's deck, a handkerchief covered her eyes. She hoped someone on the beach saw their abduction, but doubted they could help. In a luxurious cabin, Bessie longed to be back with the girls on the beach, despite the fire aftermath. Zara was laid on a sofa, and they were left with the man who carried Bessie.
