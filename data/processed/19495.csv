Tommy Atkins' rifle was not the only inanimate object to show human qualities. Animals like Jack London's dog in _The Call of the Wild_ and the immortal _Black Beauty_ have human-like characteristics too. But let's shift our focus from animals to objects. Kipling's ocean liner has a soul, making it relatable, just like a boat with its crankiness and heroism. While some inanimate objects like steam rollers or poison gas bombs are not loved, others like guns can become friends. Davy Crockett cherished his gun _Betsy_, and even gun crews on liners name their guns. Indian warriors revered their bows and arrows, and Paul Revere likely spoke encouraging words to his horse during his midnight ride. Similarly, _Uncle Sam_, the motorcycle, became the trusted companion of _Tom Slade_, enduring challenges together in a shared journey.|"[""1.

His name wasn't Thatchy, but they called him so due to his thick, light hair resembling thatched roofs on French cottages. Originally a ship's boy who escaped a German prison camp, he now rode a motorcycle between lines. Heading west for service, the slip from headquarters didn't specify. Crossing old trenches, he saw war trophies, affecting him deeply. Children in ruins laughed at his French. Riding through villages, he circled a salient, avoiding it like a snout sniffing at Paris. At a crossroad, he watched a Red Cross procession heading south. Thundering guns in the north echoed. Passing through Meaux, he encountered silent stretchers and German prisoners. Realizing he was truly in the war, he headed towards the billet villages northwest of Montdidier.|"['1.

Tom Slade, a dispatch-rider, rode through a quiet path near the west arm of the salient. The peaceful woods reminded him of home in America where he camped and hiked with his scout friends. He encountered a German soldier crawling towards him, wounded in the foot and chained to heavy metal. Tom, with his searchlight, saw the soldier's suffering and decided to help.

Tom's quick thinking and resourcefulness allowed him to fashion a makeshift tool using his motorcycle to cut through the metal band.

Tom pondered about his former scout troop in America, reminiscing about the scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth, who had guided him, and his friends Roy Blakeley, Peewee Harris, and Rossie Bent.

Tom set off on his motorcycle towards the north, prepared for whatever lay ahead. He reached a village where General Pershing was in a meeting. Tom's arrival surprised the soldiers, and he sensed important events unfolding. As soldiers moved quietly around, Tom waited, ready to assist if needed.

The entire sight brought back memories for Tom, reminding him of the circus packing up quietly at night when he was a child. Tanks, soldiers covered in darkness, reminded him of elephants. Troops were leaving for the front trenches. Even though Tom hadn't been to the front lines, his experience as a rider gave him a good sense of the area. Dispatch-riders quickly develop this sense. Tom knew the village was right behind the trench area. He believed Cantigny village was near the German trenches. He felt drawn to the threshold of active warfare.

Tom was preparing to go over the top with his regiment, feeling a mix of nerves and nostalgia for home. Despite being a non-commissioned officer, he volunteered for a special service mission in a distant sector. His decision was influenced by a fellow soldier's comment about his level-headedness.

His advisor felt silenced. Thatchy was sent to the ever-changing battle lines in the West. Roads shifted daily, leading to Headquarters one day and into enemy territory the next. Despite the chaos, Thatchy always reached his destination and returned. His uncanny sense of direction made him valuable in the confusing terrain where maps quickly became outdated. As Tom and his companions approached a wider road filled with troops, tanks maneuvered across fields like clumsy mud turtles. Soldiers poured into communication trenches as artillery boomed.

Far ahead, a lone rider could see figures in gray coats rushing out of the trench. He believed the Americans had succeeded in their attack. The rider heard bullets whizzing past him and his machine, but he pressed on. The wire he dragged slowed him down, but he was determined to deliver a crucial message to the soldiers ahead.

Tom and his group continued on their journey, passing over the planks laid across the German trenches. The road led straight into Cantigny, where continuous firing could be heard as the Germans made a stand in the village.

Tom walked towards the woods where American soldiers guarded gasoline tanks seized in war. He lingered, then continued towards the sound of gunfire. Crossing a bridge over a stream, he paused to listen. Tom ventured deeper into the woods, following the stream towards the fighting. He saw khaki-clad figures and felt danger but pressed on. As he neared the source of the stream, he noticed movement in the bushes. A German soldier emerged, unaware of Tom. Tom hesitated to use his pistol, fearing a miss could endanger him.

In the dense forest, Tom had a sudden idea to use camouflage like the German soldier he was following. He deftly fashioned a leafy bough into a portable screen, allowing him to stealthily trail the man. Tom's agile movements mirrored those of an American scout, contrasting with the German's reliance on devices over skill. As they ventured deeper into the secluded area, the German's behavior grew increasingly suspicious. Tom observed as the man searched bushes frantically, until a sudden gunshot sent him tumbling into the brook.

There was something alluring about the freelance warfare, akin to the privateers of old, in contrast to the modern dreadnaughts. It brought to mind legendary figures like Daniel Boone and Davy Crockett, known for their stealth and resourcefulness in nature. Tom, a scout himself, found the sniper's role noble and heroic, holding back the agents of death. The sniper's cold, steady eye and precise shot struck Tom as admirable. He reflected on how others had things named after them, but not him. His friend, Roscoe, reassured him of his reputation and presented him with a small token from Uncle Sam, signifying gratitude for Tom's loyalty during the war. Tom, touched by the gesture, realized the true value of his name and the respect he had earned.|"[""1.

"Tommy Slade helped me, as usual. I beaned nine Germans in No Man's Land, got slightly wounded, stubbing my toe. Pop Clemenceau gave me a kiss and slipped me this Cross for luck,"" said Roscoe, pinning it on to please Tom. ""When Clemmy saw the name on the rifle, he asked what it meant.

Tom shared his experiences with Roscoe, hidden in a tree near a stream. They were waiting for German emissaries. Three figures approached, one a massive officer.

Tom carefully observed the ground near the bush and noticed a dark spot on a gray stone. Initially, he mistook it for blood but soon realized that the poison from a damaged container was seeping into the stream. Recalling a soldier in need of water at Cantigny, Tom understood the urgency of the situation. With quick thinking, he plugged the hole with a bandage and signaled to Roscoe, who was guarding the area.

The forest they had spent the day in stretched north of the village and thinned out to the east. By following the eastern edge, one would exit slightly east of the main settlement. A by-path mentioned by Roscoe led to the main road. Running east-west across the woods' northern end was a road where the Germans were establishing their lines. Despite a shorter route along a brook, Roscoe preferred the open country for better visibility. Tom believed they were heading south towards Cantigny village, but Roscoe was anxious about potential dangers. Tom's calm confidence contrasted with Roscoe's doubts. As they navigated the woods, Tom's instincts guided them while Roscoe worried about being captured.

Tom and Roscoe found themselves in a dangerous situation after stumbling upon a machine-gun nest in the woods. Surrounded by German soldiers led by a fierce officer, the two boys faced a perilous predicament. Despite Tom's stoic demeanor, the situation was dire. Roscoe, with his sharp aim, couldn't hide his regret for not heeding the warning signs earlier. The officer, with an intimidating presence, questioned the boys, who tried to downplay their intrusion.

Tom had a compass all along during their discussion about the right direction to take. Roscoe couldn't understand why Tom hadn't shown it to prove his point. The officer inspected their findings and spoke to his men in German. Tom watched anxiously, while Roscoe looked at him with disdain for his mistake. The officer complimented Tom's strength and then conversed in German with his men. Tom noticed that these men seemed unfamiliar with the area and might have stumbled upon it accidentally. Roscoe, feeling resentful towards Tom, took pleasure in thinking that Tom was scared. As they walked, a distant light appeared, and the officer occasionally inspected Tom's compass.

They walked straight, away from the woods, heading towards a distant light. Two Germans with bayonets searched the area, while the others escorted Tom and Roscoe, carrying all the weight. The officer walked between the groups, checking the compass. Tom worried when the officer glanced at the sky. Roscoe joked about Boy Scouts to the Germans. They neared a house with a flickering light. The officer paused, but they continued. Roscoe's bitter remarks made Tom anxious. The officer stopped again, making Tom uneasy.

The house was surrounded by shadowy figures as Tom Slade called out to them, announcing the prisoners they had captured. Roscoe Bent, still in shock, observed the scene unfold. A Prussian officer, taken aback, mumbled in German while the young American captain took charge. Tom, calm and collected, climbed a fence to join the victorious American soldiers who had secured the village. Tom's concern about poisoned hogsheads in the woods was put to rest. The commotion attracted more soldiers, and the captured Germans, except the officer, were escorted away. Tom explained his strategy with a nonchalant attitude, sharing credit with Archer for the clever deception.

Tom was determined to hold on, even as his body throbbed in pain and his arms felt like they were being torn off. He refused to let go, even as he collapsed and fell from the limb, knowing that he and Uncle Sam would go down together. As the minutes passed, their reflections in the water looked strange and upside down, clinging to each other desperately. Tom noticed a broken branch behind him that could serve as a hook to save his bike. Summoning all his willpower, he resolved not to give up, thinking of his friends back home. With his last reserves of strength, he tightened his grip on the limb, preparing for his final attempt to save the bike.

Slowly, Tom loosened his sweaty left hand, afraid to pull it away. This action added tension to his whole body. This moment felt like the most critical in his life. In a burst of desperation, he finally moved his left hand. The muscles in his tight right arm stood out, and his forearm throbbed with pain. He felt a dull ache in his shoulder blade. His sweaty hand gripped the wheel tightly, feeling his pulse racing. His fingers tingled as if they were asleep. As his hand slipped slightly, he felt a bit of relief. Carefully, he reached behind with his left arm to clear twigs that obstructed the wheel. Despite the soreness and pain, he managed to maneuver the wheel into place. Exhausted, he sat on the limb, breathing heavily. The sun smiled down on him approvingly. Hurriedly, he climbed down the tree to assess the situation below.|"['1.

Tom was faced with a dilemma as he considered the gas tank. Could the fuel have leaked while the machine was hanging up and down? This would place the supply hole underneath. Carefully wading into the water, he discovered a gently sloping submerged bank. Although he couldn't lift the machine far, he managed to guide it, preventing damage. Despite feeling weary, his previous success fueled his resolve. Tom avoided checking his watch, preferring to work in uncertainty. He strategically used branches to create a cushion near the edge, then skillfully maneuvered the machine onto it. With renewed determination, he set off on his motorcycle, the morning's tranquility boosting his spirits. The birds' songs echoed his unwavering belief: failure was not an option.|"['1.

As Tom rode his bicycle named _Uncle Sam_, he felt numb and sore from the long journey. The bike was damaged, covered in mud, and Tom's clothes were torn and dirty. Despite the pain, Tom rode on, ignoring the curious stares of onlookers. Passing through villages and over bridges, he pushed forward, feeling exhausted but determined. The uphill climb tested his endurance, but he persevered, hoping for rest at the top. Tom's tired arm ached, and he longed for a soft pillow to rest it on.

Below them, the vast sea stretched endlessly, overshadowing the landscape. The steel blue water sparkled in the sunlight, hinting at hidden dangers beneath the surface. A ship appeared in the distance, emitting a column of black smoke against the clear morning sky. Tom pointed excitedly, explaining that beyond the Atlantic Ocean lay America. Urging Uncle Sam to hurry, they raced down the hill, passing by fences, houses, and a cow in a field. As they sped through the valley, the sea disappeared from view. Riding furiously along a broad highway, they left a trail of dust behind. The surroundings blurred as they approached Teurley, causing a muleteer to move aside in fear.

"""I'm relieved I located you here,"" he concluded, as if that was the crucial part; ""because now I feel comfortable sharing an idea I have. I would have been hesitant to share it with anyone else. I don't have it fully formed yet,"" he continued, ""but maybe I can offer more help than expected. As I was riding, I had a spark of an idea."" In the Quartermaster's office, Tom sat on a bench while Mr. Conne and a few others, including two men in uniform and two potential Secret Service agents, conversed quietly. Tom felt excluded until he was eventually called upon to recount his capture of Major von Piffinhoeffer and asked if he could identify a close relative of the major. Tom believed he could ""in a special way"" due to his knowledge of breed and specie marks. He also mentioned he had another idea, but they didn't inquire further.

"""Tommy, what's your idea?"" Mr. Conne asked, moving his cigar from one side of his mouth to the other. ""There's a saying, where there's smoke, there's fire. We suspect someone, but we don't know who. Maybe he resembles someone you've seen. Perhaps he has a unique ear."" He glanced at Tom, who couldn't help but chuckle. Then, with a thoughtful expression, Mr. Conne examined the mysterious letter. ""We'd have to search all two or three thousand people on board, ask a few questions. It'll be a lengthy process and might not yield much. Family resemblances are useful when you know both parties, Tommy, but in the real world..."" Mr. Conne paused, picking up the letter.

Mr. Conne dryly mentioned that he was the one who caught someone who died on Ellis Island. The place is being abandoned for safety reasons. He received a notice not to use it after sending a letter. They plan to get a new one before the time runs out to use it through Mexico. The conversation hinted at concealing a key and credentials. The idea was L.'s, possibly referring to hiding them.

"Tom remained silent as his thoughts were slowly slipping away from him. Mr. Conne turned the kaleidoscope, revealing new patterns to Tom. ""He took L. home for the holidays,"" Mr. Conne mentioned softly. ""Old Piff and the boys."" ""You didn't ride fast enough and make enough noise,"" Mr. Conne remarked, still engrossed in the changing designs. He then licked his lip and redirected his cigar. ""That's what my idea's about,"" Tom began. ""It's not exactly an idea, but it came to me suddenly. You know what a hunch is, right? There's something about someone having a cataract, and that's related to your eyes; Mr. Temple had one. So maybe this guy L. he met again is an eye doctor. Before the war, they suggested Mr. Temple visit Berlin to see eye specialists there. Perhaps the spy is a surgeon and L. is an eye doctor.

Tom followed quietly as Mr. Conne focused on a tune, now singing the words with a significant air. Memories flooded Tom's mind of the days when this song was the anthem of the _Texas Pioneer_ transport ship. The vessel slowly maneuvered against the dock, its colorful design gleaming under the sunlight. The atmosphere was tense as workers lingered near the gangplank, sensing something extraordinary. Tom, trembling with excitement, felt conflicted about scrutinizing the American soldiers disembarking, fearing to falsely accuse anyone of treason. The fear of suspicion weighed heavily on him, making him long for the carefree days riding through France.

Tom was surprised when Mr. Conne tapped his shoulder, handing back his glasses. He noticed only one other person with glasses, a black-haired youth.
