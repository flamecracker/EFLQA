"In the distant past, the Vikings, fearless seafarers from Norway, were legendary for their daring voyages across Northern Europe. Many English ancestors had Viking heritage, and these fierce warriors even invaded England. One notable Viking, Harald Fairhair, ascended the throne at just ten years old with a grand vision to unite Norway's divided kingdoms. Through years of relentless battles, Harald triumphed, earning his title ""Fairhair."" Legend has it that Harald's quest for a united kingdom was inspired by a girl named Gyda, who challenged him to become a great king before she would marry him.

In the tales of the two Olafs, Olaf Tryggvasson and Olaf the Saint, we find stories of heroic battles and the championing of Christianity in Norway. Olaf Tryggvasson, baptized in the Scilly Isles, married an Irish princess and lived in Dublin. He relentlessly promoted Christianity in Norway but met a tragic end at sea. Olaf the Saint, on the other hand, broke down London Bridge to secure victory for Etheldred the Unready against the Danes. As King of Norway, he converted people to Christianity and was believed to work miracles. His name remains engraved in Norwegian legends. The Vikings' tales are recorded in Sagas, reflecting a history of nearly a thousand years. Today, Norway's picturesque fjords, majestic mountains, and vast glaciers make it a beautiful land to explore.|"[""1.

In Norway, most people are connected to a trade or profession. In seaports, ships load and unload, providing work for many. In towns, there are professionals like clergy, merchants, bankers, lawyers, doctors, and others. Norway isn't wealthy, but its trading ships show prosperity. Few Norwegians are rich, and nobility was abolished, ensuring equality. Most Norwegians work to maintain comfortable lives. Timber from Norway's forests is valuable, used locally and exported. Matches and wood-pulp are also traded. Hönefos town has a pulping factory, turning trees into paper. The factory, run by an Englishman, employs many locals. Ice cutting in Norway is crucial, with ice blocks sent across the North Sea. Wooden chutes transport ice blocks from mountain lakes to fjords for storage until summer.|"['1.

The chief export of Norway, besides timber, is fish, particularly cod. The Lofödden Islands on the North-West Coast, within the Arctic Circle, host extensive fisheries where around 30,000 men and 6,000 boats catch cod between January and April. The fishermen come from far and wide, living in temporary huts during the season. The work is tough and risky due to frequent storms and treacherous tides. The fish are split open, dried, and sold fresh or salted. The cod's roe and liver are valuable, with factories producing cod-liver oil. Fishing is a major industry in Norway, not just for cod but also herrings, sprats, and salmon. Fishing even continues in winter through the frozen fjords. Norwegians, being great fish-eaters, have vibrant daily fish markets.|"['1. What is the chief export of Norway besides timber?\nA) Salmon\nB) Cod\nC) Sprats\nD) Herrings\nE) Tuna', '2.

In Norway, every blade of grass is turned into hay to feed the ponies and cows during the snowy winters. Haymaking is a vital business, with Norwegians efficiently harvesting grass from their land. Even though the grass only grows about six inches tall, every nook and corner is carefully scythed and gathered. The grass is then dried on long wires stretched from the valleys to the mountaintops. Additionally, corn is dried by tying small sheaves to poles in the ground. During summer, the flocks and herds are taken to highland pastures for dairy work. Children help with tasks like haymaking and milking goats. Families sometimes move to mountain pastures for the summer, fishing in mountain lakes and hunting wild reindeer. Peasants mainly eat porridge, salted fish, and heavy rye bread. Wealthier farmers enjoy fresh meat, fish, and cheeses like _prim_ and _mysost_.|['1.

Winter in Norway is a challenging time for farmers. They work hard during the summer to prepare for the cold months ahead. The Norwegian countryman not only has to think about feeding and housing his family but also his cattle. Sundays are a time for rest and socializing. The farmers enjoy rowing across the fjord to attend church, followed by gatherings with neighbors and feasts at friends' farms. In winter, life slows down as the snow covers the land. Farmers take care of their cattle and work on various tasks. Younger men look forward to skiing and hunting during this season. Larger farmers near tourist areas combine hotel-keeping with farming to diversify their income. The Lutheran religion is prevalent in Norway, with people paying tithes and offerings willingly to support their clergy. Church services can be far, requiring boats or ponies for transportation. Weddings are festive occasions, with traditional attire and celebrations that last for days.|"[""1.

"In Norway, country children have a relaxed time as they don't go to school for most of the year. During summer, they care for animals, row, fish, or help with hay-making. In winter, like town children, they attend school from ages seven to fourteen or fifteen. They receive religious teaching from the priest until Confirmation. Country schools face challenges due to the distance between farms. Government schoolmasters travel to teach children in their homes. Some farmers provide schoolrooms. Children get only twelve weeks of schooling per year, which may increase to fifteen weeks. In towns, children attend school for twelve weeks, but private schools offer year-round education. Norwegian children enjoy winter sports like skiing and skating and engage in outdoor activities like mountain walks and fishing in summer. They play simple games and make toys from wood. Outdoor games, especially ""Ring Dance,"" are popular among children, emphasizing dancing and singing."|['1.

"Many traditional ring dances found in Norway have similarities to English games, with similar tunes and lyrics. The origins of these games remain a mystery, with shared games like ""Blind Man's Buff,"" ""Hunt the Slipper,"" and ""Forfeits"" being common throughout Europe. An example is the Norse version of ""Round and round the Mulberry Bush,"" known as ""The Washing-Maids' Dance"" or ""Round the Juniper Bush."" Children dance around an imaginary bush, acting out washing operations while singing verses for each day of the week. Another popular game is _Slængkompas_, where players gallop in a circle, spinning and clapping to a tune. Norwegian children also enjoy games like ""Hop-in-Paradise"" (Hop-scotch) and ""Cat's Cradle."" They love dressing up, holding mock weddings, and dancing to fiddle music.

"In the highlands of Norway, Norsemen enjoy sports like shooting fjeld-ryper and fishing trout in lakes. The plateau, though not flat, offers stunning views with hills and mountain peaks rising 500-600 feet above. The landscape includes lakes, swamps, ravines with rocks, sand mounds, and snowfields. Despite the desolation, it attracts people for shooting, fishing, and solitude. Norway's vast forests host various animals like lynx and wolverine, posing threats to livestock. Wolves, once feared, are now rare due to civilization. In addition to common English animals, Norway has Arctic foxes, hares, and ermines that change coat colors.

In the North, a unique animal, the reindeer, plays a crucial role in the lives of the people. These reindeer are vital to the Laplanders' survival, providing food, skins for warmth, and even materials for clothing and tools. The Laplanders rely on these reindeer to carry their belongings, draw their sleighs, and provide milk and meat. The reindeer are herded and watched over by men and dogs, and their value is immense to the Laplanders. These animals are well-adapted to the cold climate, able to find food in the snow-covered landscape by digging through the snow to reach the moss beneath. The reindeer are truly the lifeline for the people in this harsh environment, offering sustenance and resources that are essential for survival.|"['1.

Farther south, on the Hardanger Fjeld and elsewhere, herds of domesticated reindeer have been established by Norwegian companies as a new industry. Lapps are employed to care for them, and the meat is sold in large quantities in many parts of Europe, particularly in Paris. A significant trade is also conducted in the reindeer skins, used for glove-making and other purposes. It is not challenging to observe one of these herds, and any traveler in Norway near the mountains where a herd grazes should make an effort to see the reindeer. These animals are not like the deer in Richmond Park, waiting to be observed, but rather timid and restless, prepared to flee at the slightest disturbance. Only the Lapp herdsmen and their dogs can manage these untamed creatures of the wild. Norway provides an excellent environment for bird-watching, with a variety of species present throughout the year. Many British birds can be found in Norway, including golden eagles, snowy owls, ravens, and more. Additionally, Norway is a nesting ground for various migratory birds that also visit the British Isles during the summer months. Norway's protection of its bird species through laws has helped preserve many unique and rare birds, unlike the fate of the Great Auk, which disappeared due to lack of protection. The presence of diverse bird species in Norway makes it an ideal destination for bird enthusiasts and nature lovers.|"['1.

"In ancient times, birds held significant roles in legends. One tale tells of a gold-crest bird outsmarting a golden eagle. The eagle, confident of victory, soared high, but the gold-crest slyly perched on his back. When the eagle claimed the highest position, the gold-crest flew even higher, hitting the sun and burning his crest. Despite the fall, the gold-crest cleverly displayed a golden crown, earning the title of ""fuglekongen"" (king of the birds). Another legend speaks of the great black woodpecker, known as ""Gertrude's Bird,"" cursed for refusing to help our Lord. The woodpecker's red head symbolizes the cap worn by the selfish Gertrude.

Norway is renowned for its breathtaking waterfalls that captivate the senses. The country boasts a myriad of cascades, each with its unique allure. From the Rjukanfos in Telemarken to the Skjæggedalsfos and the Vöringfos, opinions vary on which is the most magnificent. The cascades, fed by rapid snowmelt in spring and heavy summer rainfall, create a spectacle that changes with the seasons. Snowfields, remnants of the Great Ice Age, give rise to glaciers like the Folgefond in Hardanger, covering 120 square miles. Local legends tell of buried valleys and ancient sins, adding mystique to these icy wonders. Visitors can explore glaciers like Buar Bræ and Bondhus Bræ, but caution is advised due to hidden crevasses.

A glacier is a river of ice found in valleys beneath snowfields. The sun melts new snow, which then squeezes into old snow, forming glaciers. Glaciers slowly move down valleys but can break off at the end, creating ice-water torrents. Rocks and stones from valley edges get embedded in the ice, forming moraines. The Jökul snowfield in the Hardanger district feeds the Vöringfos waterfall. The Rembesdal glacier near Eidfjord has caused trouble by creating lakes that burst, causing floods. Norwegian engineers built a tunnel to prevent these floods. Norway's engineers excel at creating roads, even cutting them out of mountainsides or winding through gorges with stone bridges over torrents. The Snake Road near Röldal is a famous zigzag mountain pass road.|['1.

Not far from Torghatten lies Lekö Island, where a beautiful maiden lived in the age of the giants. The Hestmand, a giant in love with her, chased her in a rage, aiming to kill her with a giant arrow. Her brother intervened, saving her but getting the arrow through his hat. The sun then turned them to stone. The voyage continues after passing Hestmand, crossing the Arctic Circle to Bodö, then to the Lofödden Islands for cod drying-grounds. The journey proceeds to Tromsö and Hammerfest for cod-liver oil manufacturing. The North Cape, the northernmost point of Norway, offers a challenging climb with a view of the Arctic sea.

In the Arctic winter, the Polar regions experience varying degrees of light. Snow covers the landscape, providing enough light during clear skies to read for hours around midday. The moon, stars, and the stunning aurora borealis, or northern lights, also contribute to the illumination. However, when snow falls or clouds block the sky, darkness prevails, creating a melancholy atmosphere. The aurora borealis, while magnificent, does not provide substantial light and rarely brightens the surroundings. Lapps, indigenous to the Far North, including Lapland in Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, are Asiatics and Mongols. Despite their unconventional appearance and nomadic lifestyle, they are hardy, enduring great hardships in the harsh environment. The Mountain Lapps, in particular, lead a rugged existence, constantly on the move with their reindeer herds, adapting to the animals' needs for survival.|['1.

The Lapp babies have a unique start in life. They are placed in a cradle called a _komse_, made of wood strips covered with leather, just big enough for the baby. The baby is wrapped in sheepskin, placed in the cradle filled with moss, and securely laced up. The _komse_ has a wooden hood and can be covered with a shawl in severe weather. Mothers carry the cradle on their shoulders using a leather thong, and they can hang it up on a tent-pole or a tree branch. As the children grow, they help with chores and learn to use tools like lassoes and snowshoes. Their toys are miniature versions of tools they will use later in life. The Lapp lifestyle is similar to gypsies but more settled. Their homes are portable tents made of poles and wool covering, with an open top for light and smoke to escape. Meals are simple, with reindeer meat, cheese, porridge, and drinks like water, reindeer milk, and coffee.|['1.

The Mountain Lapps lead a nomadic life, moving their family and herds to new grazing spots to avoid conflicts. Despite harsh weather, they thrive in their free lifestyle. The Sea Lapps live by the coast, fishing for a living. River Lapps are both herdsmen and fishermen, residing near rivers and farming the land. Many are now valuing education for their children. In winter, Norway transforms into a winter wonderland. The city streets are frozen, and everyone uses runners instead of wheels. Children enjoy sleighing, skiing, tobogganing, and skating. Skiing is a national sport in Norway, with competitions showcasing skill, endurance, and daring.
