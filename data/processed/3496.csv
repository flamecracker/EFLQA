"This project is a tribute to the retired teacher Betty Sheridan, who shared this book with her students during their study of Japan. The ocean known as the ""Pacific"" and the Happy Islands referred to as ""Japan"" hold the same significance. These are the names adults use, seen on the map in geography. The Happy Islands truly live up to their name, with sunshine that keeps people smiling and children playing outdoors year-round without quarrels or spankings. In a small town near a big city on one of the Happy Islands, there is a house where Taro, a boy, and Take, a girl, live with their family. The arrival of the Baby brought joy and excitement to their lives. Taro and Take cherished their life with their family in the serene Happy Islands."|"['1.

The Father sat on the floor between Taro and Take, holding a squirming bundle. He revealed a beautiful baby boy with long, narrow eyes and a lock of hair standing straight up. Take was overjoyed, eager to have a little brother of her own to carry. The baby let out a big squeal and squirmed in their arms. The family gathered around, enjoying the newborn's presence in a cozy room filled with thick quilts and a wooden pillow. The baby, Bot'Chan, acted like any other baby, sucking on his fist and yawning. Outside, spring was in full bloom, with flowers blooming and a new yellow butterfly dancing in the sunshine. The family then explored their garden, complete with a toy mountain, a tiny lake with goldfish, and a red curved bridge.|"['1.

"In the sunny south side of the plum tree, a low-hanging branch held a row of tiny pink buds almost ready to bloom. Take planned to show Mother how beautifully she could arrange it. They placed the branch in the ""honorable recess,"" a special alcove in Japanese homes for beautiful things. Take carefully placed the branch in a vase, following the art of flower arrangement taught to Japanese girls. Taro and Take admired the display, which included a picture of a crow on a pine branch in a rainstorm. Taro thought the sad crow didn't match the joyful mood. The family kept their treasures in the fireproof ""Kura"" house in the garden to protect them during frequent earthquakes in the Happy Islands. The Twins were accustomed to earthquakes and found solace in knowing their valuables were safe."|"['1.

Taro's kites and dolls were stored in the Kura. But let's focus on the picture of the crow! Taro's Father fetched three identical boxes and unveiled a painting of a Japanese lady in a rainstorm. He showed Taro a sword, an heirloom from his Samurai Grandfather. The Father explained the sword's significance and the honor of being a Samurai. He emphasized that being a Samurai meant acting honorably and in the best interest of Japan. Taro, as the oldest son, would inherit the sword one day and must uphold the Samurai values. The Father shared a poem penned by the Emperor's father, encouraging Taro to memorize it to understand the sword's legacy fully.|"['1.

"Take had been quiet for a long time, lost in her thoughts. As they walked back home with a picture of birds, she finally spoke up to her father. ""Am I not a child of the Samurai, too?"" she asked. Her father replied kindly, ""Yes, my daughter, but you are a girl. It's not your fault. The honor of the family is entrusted to the sons. When you grow up, you will marry and serve your husband's family."" 

One morning, Taro, Take's older brother, woke up early to the birds singing in the garden. He tried to wake Take gently, but she remained asleep. Taro then tickled her nose with a jay's feather, reminding her of their plan to take their baby brother to the Temple.

In the cozy house where the Twins lived, there were no solid walls, just delicate wooden screens covered in fine paper. These screens could slide to create a large, bright room. The Twins had to be quiet because even the slightest noise could be heard through the paper walls. Taro, with his toothbrush in his mouth, rushed to get ready, dressing quickly with clothes that were easy for him to put on. Take, struggling with her sash, asked Taro to help tie it. Taro did his best, but it ended up looking funny. Later, their Mother noticed the mistake and taught Taro how to tie a bow properly. The next morning, after a rain shower, the garden was glistening. The Twins fed their pet doves and fish, enjoying the peaceful morning together.|"[""1.

"""Ding-ding-ding!"" chimed Take as the gong sounded, signaling that breakfast was ready. She skipped up the gravel path to the house, her hair bouncing and her sash fluttering like a big blue butterfly in the wind. Once everyone was prepared, they looked magnificent in their finest silk kimonos adorned with the family crest. Bot'Chan sported new clothes tailored by Grannie and Mother for his inaugural visit to the Temple. As the Twins were about to slip into their clogs, the front gate swung open, revealing three brown men pulling small carriages behind them. The sight left Take so startled that she tumbled over, quickly getting back up and hopping with one shoe on and one shoe off. The city streets bustled with activity as they passed vendors selling vegetables, fish, flowers, and more. Observing little girls playing with baby siblings, the Twins marveled at the vibrant fruit shops, clothing stores, and artisans crafting paper lanterns. The family, led by Father and followed by Mother, Grannie, Bot'Chan, and the Twins, embarked on a proud procession towards the Temple, passing through a tree-lined avenue adorned with colorful banners and lanterns, resembling a blooming flower garden."|"['1.

The Twins were curious about their Father's interest in peas and rice. Their curiosity led them to a small stall where they found a tiny white horse, no bigger than a large dog, with white eyes. As they approached the Temple's grand door, their Father instructed them to remove their shoes. Inside, a bell rang loudly, making the air quiver. At the entrance, a white rooster perched on a box, crowing happily. The family watched as the Father prayed with a rosary while a priest approached. In the Temple, they observed people praying before a grand altar with incense burning in a brazier. The Father held Baby Bot'Chan as the priest blessed him, and incense smoke filled the air, causing Bot'Chan to sneeze, disrupting the solemn moment.|"['1.

The family quickly returned to the entrance to retrieve their clogs. Once outside, the fresh air made Bot'Chan snuggle on his Mother's back and fall asleep peacefully. Near the Temple, they discovered a beautiful orchard of cherry trees in full bloom. People were gathered under the trees, admiring the blossoms, some even writing poems and hanging them on the branches out of love for the flowers. Children played around, and nearby stood a charming tea-house. As they explored further, they encountered cages with lions, tigers, monkeys, zebras, elephants, and various other animals. Colorful birds with red and blue feathers fluttered about, adding to the lively scene. The family fed swans and fish, enjoyed the street performers, and savored a delicious treat from a friendly old woman selling cakes. Their adventure continued as they discovered a dolls' garden with miniature trees and a quaint tea-house by a serene pond.|"['1.

As the Twins stepped onto the open platform, they were greeted by a breathtaking view of the entire city. From gray rooftops to lush green trees, bustling roadways with tiny people resembling ants, and shimmering rivers and ponds, it felt like they could see the whole world. In the distance, a majestic lonely mountain peak rose against the pale blue sky, its rosy top glowing in the sunlight. The family boarded a pleasure boat, drifting over blue waters, passing rice fields and tea plantations where workers toiled in their round hats. They glimpsed quaint villages with thatched roofs and locals riding in unique baskets carried by two men. Baby Bot'Chan received many gifts, including toys, silk dresses, and a fierce-looking puppy cat, which he tried to put in his mouth. The day ended with tea and treats before heading home.|"['1.

Taro and Take shared their favorite parts of the day without revealing specifics like the little horse, tiny garden, cherry trees, animals, boat-ride, or party. The next morning, rain drummed on the roof, and the Twins, unable to see through glassless windows, crafted paper wagons with Grannie's help. They gathered by the hibachi stove, a metal box with a charcoal fire, to keep warm. The Mother set up a futon tent over the fire and placed cushions for cozy seating. The Mother then recounted stories of a young boy who protected his parents from mosquitoes and a girl who saved her father from a tiger, emphasizing the value of love and sacrifice.|['1.

Take flew to the box and untied the string. She lifted the cover to find a beautiful toy house, resembling the one the Twins lived in! The house had a porch, sliding screens, a cupboard with doll bedding, and even an alcove with a tiny vase holding a flower. Delighted, Take explored the house, moving mats and sliding screens, and setting up her stove in the kitchen. Overjoyed, she ran to her Father, expressing her gratitude. Later, she busily prepared breakfast for the Emperor and Empress, ensuring they were served first.

"A dreadful mishap occurred! Glory toppled over once more, this time plunging into the pond, only her head submerged due to her lengthy legs. Thankfully, Take swiftly rescued her to prevent a potential drowning. At the Doll Shop, numerous dolls lined the shelves, attracting hordes of girls. Take spotted a chubby baby doll with a quirky tuft of black hair and decided it was the one. After purchasing it, she declared it as Glory's new little brother. Take also bought a legless doll named ""Daruma"" for Bot'Chan. O Kiku San, Take's close friend, arrived with a large doll in a red kimono.

One day, the Mother prepared sweet rice-cakes for a special tea party. The maids arranged tiny tables, and Take set up her doll teapot and toy cups. They enjoyed real tea and sugared beans and peas. After sharing treats with their dolls, the girls politely bid farewell and went home. Another morning, Taro and Take overheard their parents discussing school. Taro, embracing the Samurai spirit, looked forward to the new experience. The Twins took nightly baths in a barrel-shaped tub with a built-in stove.

"In Japan, Taro and Take waited for their teacher's clumpty-clump wooden clogs. As he entered, the children lined up, bowing low and greeting with ""Ohayo."" The teacher then introduced them to letters, guiding them to point with sticks. Taro and Take, new to school, poked holes in their paper, eager to learn. They also practiced counting. Their big, wet letters led to an outdoor lesson and rice snack. Despite the challenges, the children enjoyed holidays and fun times, especially at the pond where lotus flowers popped open at sunrise, saluting the sun like fairy guns."|['Question 1:\nWhat did Taro and Take do when their teacher entered the classroom?\nA) Clapped their hands\nB) Jumped on their desks\nC) Lined up and bowed low\nD) Ran around the room\nE) Started singing', 'Question 2:\nWhat did the teacher introduce the children to?\nA) Numbers\nB) Colors\nC) Letters\nD) Shapes\nE) Animals', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Taro and Take use to point at the letters?\nA) Pens\nB) Pencils\nC) Sticks\nD) Crayons\nE) Chalk', 'Question 4:\nWhere did the outdoor lesson take place?\nA) Library\nB) Playground\nC) Classroom\nD) Garden\nE) Gymnasium', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the lotus flowers do at sunrise?\nA) Closed\nB) Bloomed\nC) Moved\nD) Sang\nE) Danced', 'Question 6:\nHow did the children feel about holidays and fun times?\nA) Bored\nB) Annoyed\nC) Excited\nD) Sad\nE) Tired']|['C) Lined up and bowed low', 'C) Letters', 'C) Sticks', 'D) Garden', 'B) Bloomed', 'C) Excited']
New Year's Day is a special celebration where boys and their fathers and grandfathers gather to fly kites of all shapes and sizes, including dragons and boxes. The kites fill the sky with wonder, sometimes even engaging in aerial battles! This festive occasion lasts for five days, and everyone joins in the fun, except the girls. On this day, Taro woke up early with excitement, just like Take did on the Festival of Dolls. The street was decorated with colorful fish flags and banners, symbolizing bravery and strength like the carp fish. Taro also had soldier dolls for his birthday, creating a miniature army with generals, officers, and even nurses marching in rows with toy guns and flags.|"[""1.

Taro was thrilled and barely touched his breakfast. Quickly finishing, he jumped up excitedly, nearly knocking over his table in the process. Dressed in a soldier-like uniform and armed with a wooden sword, he eagerly awaited the approaching spectacle. Soon, the sound of a drum signaled the arrival of the procession. Excitedly, Take alerted her parents, and they rushed to the gate with Grannie to watch. A man, a boy, and a monkey in a kimono performed tricks, captivating the audience. The boy climbed a ladder, hung from the top by his toes, and even fanned himself with a fan.
