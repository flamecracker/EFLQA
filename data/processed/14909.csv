Violet had a tough day. She didn't prepare for her lessons, broke a rule, and was saucy to her grandparents. As a consequence, she had to eat her dinner alone in the school-room. When she returned for supper, her plate was gone, and she had to eat in her room until she behaved better. Feeling remorseful, she remembered her father's words about the kindness of Mr. Dinsmore and Grandma Elsie. Lulu, Violet's sister, learned that their father was saddened when they misbehaved. Violet hoped this would encourage Lulu to do better and to avoid sin because it displeases God. Two days later, Max was forgiven and warmly welcomed back after his time-out. Gracie hesitated to join without her mom but eventually agreed.|"['1.

Just before they left, Mr. Dinsmore made Max very happy by returning his money and watch. He warned against gambling, and Max promised never to play cards again. Edward and Zoe took a pleasure trip in addition to their business one, so they were away from home for over two weeks. When they returned, Elsie welcomed them warmly. Zoe was amazed and delighted by a surprise - a baby! She knelt by the crib, exclaiming over the little one's sweetness. Edward teased Zoe, calling her dearer and sweeter than the baby. They visited the Oaks and the Laurels, where they heard stories about Elsie's past. Gracie, eager to see her mother, was thrilled to learn about the new baby. The family reunion was heartwarming with hugs and kisses, especially when Gracie showed her father the little one.|['1.
