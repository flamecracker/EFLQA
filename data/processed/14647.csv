Despite the danger of being lost, Fred pressed on, swinging his torch to light the way.

Fred was deep in a dark cave, his torch flickering. He worried about being surrounded by hungry creatures if it failed. The stick he carried was heavy and resin-coated. As he walked, water dripped from wet rocks above. Suddenly, he stumbled and fell into a chasm, extinguishing his torch. Bruised and disoriented, he lit a match and discovered he was in a rocky pit. He found his torch and climbed out, pondering the wolf that led to his fall. Relieved, he reignited the torch, realizing it wouldn't last long. Determined to find his way back, Fred pressed on through the cave, hoping to escape the dangers lurking in the darkness.|"['1.

Fred wished to find the wolf again, believing it entered the cave nearby. However, he reached a dead-end after a thorough search. He tried to signal his friend Mickey, but the echoes inside the cave were overpowering. Despite his efforts, Mickey did not respond. Fred realized they were too far apart for signals to work. Understanding he needed to return to camp quickly, Fred felt the weight of responsibility on his shoulders. He feared the redskins might find Mickey asleep and attack.

After escaping their enemies, the two prisoners faced a new challenge - food scarcity. With dwindling supplies, they pondered their fate. Mickey revealed a risky plan to Fred, who doubted its success. Yet, Fred's faith in Providence remained strong, recalling past blessings. As Fred prepared to leave, a rustling sound startled him, but it was just debris. Checking his revolver, he found it intact. Eager to confront the elusive wolf, Fred ventured out, unaware of the vast distance he covered. Fatigue set in, disorienting him in the labyrinthine terrain.

Fred was filled with a hundred doubts. He had abandoned the belief that Mickey could still be asleep. Fred believed the night had passed, and even though Mickey could sleep deeply, he couldn't remain unconscious forever. Fred feared that Indians might find Mickey and harm him. He was afraid that his signals might reach the Apaches instead of Mickey, as he thought the Indians were clever enough to understand their communication. Despite his fears, no one responded to his signals. Fred was anxious that he might be walking into danger. The darkness made him recall a poem by Byron that he had learned in school, which described a desolate world. Fred felt vulnerable with the torch and considered extinguishing it to avoid being an easy target. He tested his pistol, which fired loudly, creating echoes that filled the cave. Fred hoped for a response but was met with silence. He rested, extinguished the torch, and resigned to the darkness, trying to adapt to his eerie surroundings.|"[""1.

Fred had found a comfortable spot to rest. He decided to relax and enjoy the much-needed break. When a person is extremely tired, it's hard for them to think about anything else. After being tormented by fears, once Fred stopped moving, he felt a sense of relief and longed for rest. As he closed his eyes, he saw dancing lights and heard strange noises. He felt impish figures playing around him. Eventually, he fell into a deep, dreamless sleep that refreshed him. Suddenly, he woke up to an animal licking his face. Startled, he realized it was the wolf he had encountered before. Instead of shooting it, he decided to wait and see what would happen. The wolf, ready to pounce, was surprised when Fred grabbed its tail. The wolf ran off, dragging Fred along until they emerged from the dark cave into the bright sunlight. Fred was initially disoriented by the sudden light but soon felt overjoyed to be free from the cave.|"['1.

Fred, filled with relief, controlled his exuberance to avoid alerting nearby Apaches. He danced and flailed his arms, grateful for his escape from the cave. As he caught his breath, he thanked the heavens for his rescue. Surveying his surroundings, he noticed the clear sky and the promising day ahead. Realizing he needed to reach Mickey, Fred knew returning to the cave was risky. Instead, he decided to navigate the valley to find his friend. Climbing to a higher point, he scanned the landscape, trying to locate the cave entrance.

"The Apaches had discovered a valuable spot, and the boy, after careful thought, decided on the direction where the opening lay. He headed towards a small peak to confirm his calculations. Upon reaching the elevation, he spotted the clump of bushes concealing the ""skylight"" only a short distance away. Fred observed the Apaches below, lounging in various positions. One was asleep, another smoking a pipe, and a third inspecting his rifle. The remaining trio appeared to be peering into the cavern. The Apaches removed bushes around the opening, making themselves more visible targets. Fred noticed one Apache with a lasso, pulling it up from the cave. The group gathered, discussed, and then attached the lasso to a folded blanket, resembling a man. The Apaches launched it successfully, avoiding previous mistakes."|['1.

As the group cautiously lowered the bundle, they gathered close to the edge, eager to see the outcome. Fred Munson was particularly anxious, feeling Mickey O'Rooney's fate hung in the balance. He strained to hear any sign of Mickey below. The lasso descended slowly, unwinding as it went. Fred feared the worst, wondering why there was no response from Mickey. The Indians carefully examined the blanket that was brought up, satisfied that it had not been disturbed. They then wrapped one of their own in the blanket and lowered him into the cave. Fred realized their plan was to trick Mickey into not firing at the disguised warrior. The brave Apache showed no fear as he dangled in full view of the hidden rifleman. Despite Fred's impatience, the Apaches executed their plan with confidence, leaving him in despair about Mickey's whereabouts.|"['1.

The situation was tense. The Apaches had successfully infiltrated the cave, using a man in the breach. They communicated with their ally below through a lasso system, ensuring their plan was on track. As the warriors descended, one Apache remained above to provide support.

Fred carefully approached the Apache warrior, his hand ready on his revolver. He knew he needed to be silent and undetected. The warrior, standing near a ledge with his rifle close, seemed alert. Fred's heart raced as he pondered his next move. Should he shoot the warrior from a distance or risk a close encounter? He grappled with the idea of shooting from behind, feeling it cowardly.

Fred cautiously approached the Apache, his eyes fixed on the motionless figure just a few feet away. The Apache, adorned in paint and shabby clothing, remained oblivious to Fred's presence. With each step, Fred's heart raced, knowing any sound could alert the Apache to his presence. As he inched closer, Fred prepared to make his move, his hand hovering over his revolver. But just as he was about to act, the Apache shifted his attention to the cave below. Seizing the opportunity, Fred retracted his weapon and took one last careful step forward. Unfortunately, a loose pebble betrayed his approach with a faint noise.|"[""1.

After Fred's heart-pounding encounter with the Apache, he sprang forward with all his might, striking the Indian square in the back. The Apache, taken off guard, nearly tumbled over the edge, but his quick reflexes saved him from a disastrous fall. Fred, realizing the danger, swiftly positioned himself in front of the Apache, signaling for him to retreat. The Apache, understanding the gesture, chose to drop down into the pit rather than face a bullet. As the Indian descended, he tried to grab the lasso to sneak up on Fred, but his attempt failed, and he plummeted into the cave. Fred, seizing the opportunity, secured the lasso and coiled it out of reach of the Apaches below. With a sense of relief, Fred surveyed the scene and found himself alone, victorious in outsmarting the Apache warriors.|"['1.

Fred had achieved remarkable success, but now faced a dilemma on how to help Mickey. While Fred was outside the cavern with the means to assist Mickey to the surface, the presence of Indians below posed a challenge. To establish communication, Fred used a code of signals known to both of them. After repeated attempts, Fred finally heard a faint response from Mickey, indicating that he understood the situation. However, Fred realized that lowering a rope might lead the Apaches to climb up and harm Mickey. Despite feeling faint from hunger and thirst, Fred decided to delay eating until he rescued Mickey. While searching for water, Fred stumbled upon a group of mustangs, realizing they belonged to the Apaches. This discovery sparked a new idea in Fred's mind on how to outsmart the Indians and save Mickey.|"['1.

In the dark cave, the man climbing up was almost caught by an Apache warrior. Fred, thinking it was his friend Mickey, was surprised to see the fierce warrior. Fred managed to scare the warrior away with his revolver. The exhausted warrior slipped and went back down the rope. Fred was relieved but worried about Mickey. He realized the Apaches might guard the rope, making it hard for Mickey to escape. Fred thought of signaling Mickey but knew it was risky. The noise in the cave would give away their plan.

"Mickey and Fred were cautiously making their way through the treacherous mountain pass, keeping a sharp eye out for any signs of danger. The narrow canyon was surrounded by towering rocks, some rising as high as a hundred feet. The trail they followed was marked by the hooves of horses and the remains of past conflicts between various tribes and even white men.

As they rode, Fred expressed his concerns about being spotted by the Indians that roamed the area. Mickey, however, remained hopeful that they could evade Lone Wolf and his band. He believed that their horses and the element of surprise would work in their favor, allowing them to outmaneuver any potential threats.

The landscape around them was rugged and unforgiving, with vegetation clinging to the edges of the canyon walls. Human skeletons and animal remains served as grim reminders of the violence that had occurred in the pass. The two friends knew they were in a dangerous place, but they pressed on, determined to reach safety before they were discovered.

Suddenly, Mickey and Fred noticed a plume of smoke in the distance, signaling that someone else was nearby. They halted their mustangs and studied the smoke carefully, trying to determine who might be responsible for it. The fire had been strategically placed to conceal the activities of those who had started it, adding to the sense of unease that hung in the air."|['1.

The sudden appearance of another group of horsemen in front of them left the fugitives trapped between two sides. With no clear way to advance or retreat, the Irishman considered a desperate charge but knew it was too risky for the boy with him. Determined to protect the child, he grabbed an Apache blanket and led them towards a wooded crevice for cover. As they struggled up the steep slope, Mickey O'Rooney's focus was on ensuring the boy's safety. The narrow ravine offered some hope for temporary concealment, with the two climbing with the aid of vines and saplings.

Mickey and Fred took a moment to assess their situation in the fortress, noting the advantage of the sloping wall that could protect them from attacks from above. As they prepared for a potential Apache attack, they remained vigilant. Mickey, quick to react, fired a shot that deterred the approaching warriors. Despite the tense atmosphere, Mickey advised Fred to take cover behind a boulder for safety. Fred, feeling somewhat sidelined due to his lack of a working weapon, complied.

Mickey, along with his companion Fred, found themselves in a precarious situation as they sought refuge from their foes. Despite the open space above them that posed a threat, Mickey discovered that the sloping wall offered some protection. While heavy rocks could potentially cause harm, the lad was shielded by the wall. Though escape seemed unlikely, Mickey's quick thinking subdued the first Apache they encountered. As they cautiously navigated a fissure for cover, they remained wary of the lurking Apaches outside. Mickey's vigilant watch and readiness to defend against any threat kept them safe. Observing the Apaches' movements, Mickey bided his time, waiting for the right moment to act.

Some individuals seemed to prefer a bold approach, charging directly up the narrow ravine for a quick and decisive victory. Others suggested a different strategy, hinting at reaching the target from the roof, while some advocated waiting for the right moment when the fruit of their efforts would fall into their hands effortlessly. The Apaches, led by Lone Wolf, aimed to capture both prisoners alive rather than resorting to violence. Mickey observed a greasy warrior, scarred by smallpox, who appeared to notice him. As the warrior pointed in Mickey's direction, a sudden shot rang out, causing chaos among the group. Mickey suspected that the shot might have come from a party with a vendetta against the Apaches, recalling similar instances of complex skirmishes in the Southwest. Mickey took a shot at the Apache, disrupting their plans and adding to the confusion.|"['1.

The three gunshots had a strong impact on the Apaches. The shots were precise and came from different directions, signaling to the Apaches that they were surrounded. Mickey reloaded his rifle, intending to keep the pressure on the Apaches, but they remained cautious and hidden. As Mickey returned to Fred, he noticed an Apache peering over the edge above them, searching for their whereabouts. The Apache's face was painted, and his eyes darted around as he scanned the ravine. Suddenly, a warrior near the edge fell with a distant gunshot sound.

Within the next hour, night fell, and the ravine grew dark. Mickey felt it safe to leave their hiding spot and approach the pass. Fred, aware of the danger, made sure not to give them away. They moved cautiously through the rocks and vegetation until they were close enough to stop. They listened but heard nothing alarming. Just as Mickey prepared to move, he heard a faint sound nearby. Realizing someone was close, he spotted a large boulder sheltering a scout. Mickey, in a clever move, used a stick with a burning match to reveal the scout and himself. To their surprise, it was Sut Simpson, the scout. After a brief exchange, Sut instructed them to follow quietly, emphasizing the need for silence and caution.

The scout, Sut, rode fast to catch up with Lone Wolf and his warriors, noticing they didn't have the young boy with them. He decided to watch from a distance, knowing he could be more helpful that way. Lone Wolf, angered by the scout's interference, sent two warriors after him, but the scout outsmarted them. When Lone Wolf sent a third warrior, the scout swiftly took care of him too. Using his knowledge of Lone Wolf's signals, the scout signaled for backup and then rescued the young boy just in time.

I waited until it was dark, and there wasn't a bit of moon that night. Sneaking into camp, I managed to get those three animals again. Determined to head for Port Severn, I made sure to keep moving without giving them the slightest chance to catch up. The weather had calmed down, making it comfortable to travel. After getting out of earshot of the camp, I celebrated, thinking about how surprised those varmints would be in the morning. The competition was about who was the smartest. We weren't fighting each other but going after each other's horses. I had outsmarted them twice, and I still held their horses. I made sure they wouldn't outwit me, riding towards Fort Severn. Despite being exhausted, I stayed vigilant, never sleeping for long stretches. I rode through the same pass where you almost got caught, and where I got the horses wasn't far from that big cave. I had smooth sailing all the way to the fort, keeping a close eye on those varmints. I made sure they weren't anywhere in sight when I stopped for food or rest. During the next few days, I barely slept, always on the lookout. Making good time, my last camp was close to Fort Severn.

Sut, a determined scout, left camp with his friends, focused on recovering his stolen horse. He moved stealthily, following a trail with intense concentration and caution.

Despite his confidence, Sut warned his friends to remain alert and patient, assuring them of his return within hours. If delayed, they were to wait until the next day before taking action to return home. Sut's pursuit led him to his horse, unguarded by the Indians, raising suspicions.

Sut, muttering to himself as he rode along, expressed uncertainty about the reaction of Lone Wolf, the fierce Native American, to his plan. Despite the dense woods and uneven ground slowing his pace to a walk, Sut managed to rejoin his friends promptly. He assured them he would secure a horse before sunset, emphasizing the efficiency of one horse over two. The Irishman, deferring to Sut's expertise, urged swift action. Sut proposed a safer location for them to wait while he fetched the horse.

Fred was able to hide himself for now, but he couldn't conceal the horse. The horse would give away their location to the redskins below. This worried Fred until he realized it might work to their advantage. The redskins would think the whites were ready to defend themselves and would proceed cautiously. Fred hoped this would give him a chance to escape. The scout had misjudged the redskins' speed, giving Fred hope for a successful escape.

The plan was quickly decided upon to save the horse's energy. A trail led down from the pass a short distance ahead. The mustang could dash through there swiftly. The idea was to leave the pass, head into the woods and mountains to meet up with the young man without trouble.

Sut's eyes scanned the group, seeking Lone Wolf, the esteemed leader of the Apaches, but he was nowhere in sight. Despite this, Sut was convinced that Lone Wolf was nearby, aware of the events unfolding. Simpson harbored no illusions of mercy from the Apaches. Having clashed with them extensively and inflicted harm, he knew their nature precluded any leniency. The Apaches, like others of their ilk, lacked mercy as a guiding principle.

The young leader shared good news and exchanged joy with those around him before riding his mustang up the pass. He came close to the scout, who stood silently. The Native American stopped and gazed at him, unsure of his identity. There was no real boasting, just an honest acknowledgment. Sut couldn't hide who he was, so he openly declared himself, which pleased the Indians. The young chief said nothing and rode off quickly, leaving the captive with the others. Sut, although brave, felt a pang of disappointment. As night fell, the Apaches celebrated around a fire. Sut, bound and unable to escape, hoped for a chance to fight for his life. Despite the grim situation, he remained hopeful and ready for whatever came next.|"['1.

At nightfall, the moon rose, casting light into the ravine where a strange group gathered around a fire. The scout, gazing at the moonlit sky, heard horses approaching. The chieftain, accompanied by two others, rode in and placed a captive on a mustang. As they rode off, the scout hoped to overhear their plans but they remained silent. Suddenly, the chieftain cut the captive's restraints, freeing the scout's arms. After a silent ride, they halted, and the chieftain armed the scout before riding off with the others. The scout, now free, cautiously rode in the opposite direction, grateful for the turn of events. He decided to wait until daylight before continuing his journey, feeling safe from Apache interference.|"['1.

Sut's mustang had wandered off, so he secured it to a small bush and cautiously followed the sound of another mustang's whinny. Mustangs in the Southwest are keen sentinels. Sut managed to get close to the other horse, which seemed alert. As he pondered the situation, a man with a rifle appeared. Sut tried to startle him, but they recognized each other as friends. They were relieved that neither was hurt, and their horses were unharmed. They decided to wait until daylight before continuing their search for the young boy, Fred Munson. At dawn, they found Fred on his mustang, and they happily reunited. All were safe, well-equipped, and ready to head home.|['1.
