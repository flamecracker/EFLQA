In the vast northern American wilderness, there lies a small, clear lake on a dividing ridge. Its still waters reflect like a mirror on calm Indian summer evenings. Despite its serene appearance, unseen currents within the lake flow either south to the Atlantic or north to Hudson's Bay. At the age of nineteen, Miles Milton faced a pivotal moment at the crossroads of his life. Torn between right and wrong, he ultimately chose to lean towards the left, setting off a chain of events that this story will reveal. His decision was not all good or all bad, much like the relationship between him and his father, where clashes led to a heated argument about Miles joining the army. Filled with anger, Miles sought solace in a familiar quarry, diving in to cool his emotions but emerging still troubled. Eventually, he made a definitive choice to walk away from his father's house, symbolizing a new path ahead.|"['1.

"Miles Milton could have avoided much regret if he had remembered his gentle mother at that moment. Unfortunately, in his anger, he either forgot about her or pushed the thought away. His mother, unaware of the inner conflict her son was going through, would have prayed fervently for him if she had known. However, there was someone who knew and loved Miles even more than his mother did. This person watched over him throughout his tumultuous life.

On that day, a detective tracked a swindler to the city where Miles was headed. The swindler's description matched Miles in some ways. As Miles entered a crowded eating-house, the detective noticed him. A brief confrontation led Miles to act impulsively, causing chaos in the eating-house, and then flee in a mix of horror and recklessness."|"['1.

In a bustling city street, Miles found himself pursued by a persistent man. Turning into a narrow alley, Miles hoped to lose him but was met with a dead end. Spotting a pot of whitewash, Miles quickly disguised himself, causing chaos as the man chased him. Miles cleverly turned the tables by splashing the man with whitewash, pretending to be the victim. The crowd found it amusing as Miles walked away, leaving the man in a mess. Miles, feeling troubled about his actions, walked through unfamiliar streets, contemplating his next move. Eventually, he made his way to a railway station, unsure of what to do next.

Two tall, handsome men, exuding self-assured power without arrogance or fear, caught Miles' attention. One, a young private, intrigued him with his youthful appearance despite his stern demeanor. Miles, low on money, hesitated at the train station. As the bell rang, signaling departure, he grappled with returning home, torn between conscience, shame, and pride. On the train, a sergeant captivated Miles with stories of war, revealing his serious nature and respect for his comrades. The sergeant's focus on endurance and forbearance, rather than boasting, impressed Miles. During a stop, the sergeant explained how the young private's separation from his wife fueled his sorrow, diverting him with tales of war.

When Miles expressed his loyalty to the Queen and the troops, the man quickly assured him of his own loyalty but hinted at the imperfections in the army.

Miles found himself in a dimly lit public-house, surrounded by rowdy soldiers and sailors. The atmosphere was polluted, and the language foul. Despite feeling shocked by the scene, he hesitated to leave due to false shame and lack of options. Determined to carry out his plan, he reluctantly sat down at a table. As he observed the room, a large sailor caught his attention. The sailor seemed sullen and growled in dissatisfaction. When the sailor accidentally spilled a drink on Miles and Mr. Sloper, the room erupted in laughter.

"Yes, indeed, you must have heard about it. There is a grand institution in Portsmouth too, but it caters exclusively to sailors all across the kingdom. On the other hand, Miss Robinson's establishment welcomes both soldiers and sailors, although it focuses more on soldiers. She initiated the ""Sailors' Welcome"" before Miss Weston did in Portsmouth and continues to maintain it. There is no competition or rivalry between them as their goals are quite similar, and they row together smoothly. Let me share more details once we are inside. Here we are! Those are the dock gates and Queen Street, with the ""Welcome"" nearby. It's a place where no alcohol is served, you see. All of Miss Robinson's institutions are like that.

""Oh, any sailor or soldier can enter, even if they are drunk, as long as they behave. However, they do not serve alcohol on the premises or allow it to be brought in unless it's inside you, naturally. Why? Well, you can't help that, at least not without a stomach pump.

Miles, feeling hungry and tired, decided to stay for supper. As they ate, he noticed the sailors and marines heading to the reading-room for a meal of tea and coffee.

When Miles faced the Inspector the next day, shame and despair filled him. Despite Miles giving vague answers to the Inspector's questions, the Inspector took on a fatherly role, advising him to avoid bad influences like alcohol and bad friends. Miles, wise enough to hide his emotions, accepted the advice gracefully. Later, Miles encountered a recruiting sergeant who persuaded him to join the Queen's service, and he agreed, taking the name John Miles. Although he felt guilty for leaving his family, once committed, Miles felt compelled to follow through. As he trained for deployment to Egypt, Miles found himself among a group of recruits, including the kind drill-sergeant Hardy. Miles also discovered a kindred spirit in William Armstrong, a fellow soldier.

In the lobby, he met soldiers and sailors having coffee. A civilian dressed like a soldier approached them. Miles noticed their friendly interaction. Brown then invited the civilian to the embarkation jetty for coffee, discussing army and navy life along the way.

"He was aging, you see! If he had used ""sinner"" instead of ""goose,"" his aim would have been closer; all things considered, it wasn't a miss. He felt the sting of self-condemnation.

His excuse was to check on the progress of the new Soldiers' Institute. Although he landed with the intention of visiting the Drews, a family he knew, he found they were out.

Tufnell proudly showed his friend around his construction site, where he reigned as the monarch of his kingdom of workers and materials. He shared the challenges he faced, like a tragic accident where a worker was suffocated. The incident led to demands for compensation and even a sacrificial lamb to prevent further misfortune. Despite the hardships and dangers, Tufnell remained dedicated to his cause, even facing wild dogs and nightly attacks.

Waiting in front of the hotel for an hour or two was too much for our hero's nerves. He decided to calm himself with a brisk walk. He found himself in a quiet place between the Grand Square and the Ramleh Gate, with a cool breeze and a full moon above. As he walked, yelping dogs emerged from their dens, making noise. The area was littered with debris from war, but new buildings were rising. Dim oil lamps lit the way. He noticed a man and woman ahead. Suddenly, a pack of wild dogs charged at them. The man defended them with a stick until Miles intervened, using his cane, which broke to reveal a sword. With a swift strike, he scared off the dogs.

Miles felt strong enough to carry the weight of the world like Atlas on his shoulders. Marion, with a light touch on his arm, tried to help, but Mr. Drew's weight burdened him more. Miles walked slowly due to a severe ankle twist. He apologized for his limited time, influenced by duty, learned from Marion on the ship. Miles, silent and pensive, saved the day at barracks. Troops were urgently needed in Egypt to defend against Osman Digna's attacks. Miles, focused on duty in Alexandria, saw Marion briefly.

"The train's passenger accommodation was not good, described as distinctly bad. Miles found himself in a cattle-truck with the 310th Infantry, enduring the discomforts of the desert climate in Egypt. Amidst the dust and heat, the men sought relief with water and cold tea. Some smuggled strong drinks, leading to rowdiness. Gaspard sang a song, but it fell flat due to the train's motion. Simkin's robust rendition of ""Rule Britannia"" lifted spirits until a dispute broke out between Sutherland and Simkin. The argument escalated, resulting in lost helmets and a scuffle.

The soldiers arrived at Suez after a ten-hour journey covering about 230 miles. Our hero met a marine named Stevenson, with whom he later served in the Soudan. They bonded over shared memories of England, finding comfort in discussing their homeland.

Upon reaching Suez on a cold night, Sunday began with morning routines, including a service led by an officer. Some soldiers criticized the rushed prayers, preferring no service at all.

The explosion mystery from the night before was solved the next morning when a group went out to inspect the damage. Instead of finding casualties, they discovered the remains of a small hare that had wandered into the danger zone and perished.

The extreme heat made the day challenging for the newcomers, with temperatures above 110 degrees and no air movement. Even the seasoned men struggled, and the water they used to cool off was warm.

Marion's thoughts nearly overwhelmed him until a loud trumpet blast stirred the defense line. The right Water fort, guarded by marines with two Krupp guns and a Gardner, faced enemy fire. Miles and his comrades, stationed on the Sphinx Redoubt, were prepared for action without moving. Deep trenches surrounded forts, with electric lights aiding defense. Despite limited troops, including a small British battalion and Egyptian cavalry, the defenders held their ground. As gunfire erupted, our hero faced the reality of battle. He learned to minimize exposure to danger and embraced his duty. Amidst the moonlit clouds, he guarded the desert, reflecting on his homeland.

At that time, after the enemy had been completely forced out of the pits, a group was sent to check the aftermath. Surprisingly, there were few casualties despite the heavy fighting. In the first pit, they found one man fatally shot in the head. Moving him, they discovered another man beneath him with a similar fate.

The stolen cattle belonged to the people of Suakim. Each morning at six o'clock, the shepherds would take their herds and flocks out to graze since there was no forage near the town. They had to return by sunset when the gates closed until the next morning. The women, responsible for carrying water to the town, also followed this routine. The shepherds, often exposed to danger, became careless and sometimes wandered too far with their herds. Osman took advantage of this and attacked an old shepherd, resulting in the loss of cattle. The Egyptian cavalry retaliated, recapturing some cattle and engaging the enemy in battle. Osman, however, had a hidden force which tried to draw the cavalry away. Despite being surrounded, the cavalry managed to retreat safely with minimal harm. The funeral customs in Suakim were vastly different from Western practices, with loud mourning being a prominent feature. Additionally, a Soudanese youth who was friendly with the soldiers had his hands cruelly amputated by Osman's men, sparking anger among the soldiers.|"['1.

"The others were also upset, but they didn't waste time on regrets. They rushed the young Soudanese to the doctor, who tended to his wounds. The men took good care of him until he was fully healed. It's worth noting that the man was later given a job at the garrison and proved to be a valuable worker despite losing his hands. ""It always seems to me,"" said Miles to Gaspard, ""that animals become more active in hot weather. Just listen to those cats!"" The cats were causing trouble, dancing on roofs at night and disturbing the soldiers. Osman had taken advantage of the dark night for an early attack, leading to an explosion and shots fired. The soldiers found remains of enemies blown up and burnt them with the help of locals. Vigorous exercise sometimes helps more than medicine in fighting illness. The troops in Suakim suffered from the climate, with many Europeans in hospital. Miles stayed healthy, but his friend Armstrong and others fell ill. The abstainers from alcohol fared better. A general introduced athletic games, improving morale. Miles was put into training by Stevenson for the sports, despite the intense regimen.

Critics questioned the decision to send cavalry without infantry support to destroy the village of Handoub. Despite criticism, the cavalry, led by Captain Apthorp, carried out the mission. Upon reaching the village, they destroyed it and the enemy's ammunition. However, they were ambushed by a large Arab force on their way back. Captain Apthorp and his men raced for their lives towards the sea-coast with the Arabs in pursuit. Private King fell wounded from his horse, but Captain Gregorie selflessly carried him until he could no longer continue. Private Baker then rescued Captain Gregorie, showcasing acts of heroism and self-sacrifice. The group narrowly escaped capture by reaching the sea-shore just ahead of the enemy.

During the intense events on the plain, Miles and his comrades waited anxiously on the redoubt's roof for the cavalry's return. Finally, a cloud of dust appeared on the horizon in the afternoon. The men were seen racing towards the town while the enemy, on camels, horses, and on foot, raced towards the sea to cut off their retreat. The soldiers, seized by an uncontrollable burst of action, grabbed their rifles, ammunition-belts, and rushed out to the rescue, ignoring the officers' calls to return. The news spread quickly, and the men, in various attire, cavalry, artillery, marines, infantry, all hurried towards the enemy. The soldiers were saved by the ships opening fire just in time. The soldier-life in Suakim had its ups and downs, like a ripple in a river. Osman Digna kept the garrison on edge with nightly harassment. However, a change came with the arrival of a mail from England, bringing joy to the soldiers. Flynn received a letter from his grandmother, revealing personal struggles and loss, reminding everyone of the realities of war.|"['**1.

The soldier continued reading the letter, his expression shifting dramatically from sorrow to joy. Stevenson, a marine, arrived with a letter meant for Miles Milton, bringing news of his father's illness and recovery. The heartfelt words in the letter brought comfort and forgiveness. As Miles read on, he was called to join his company. The arrival of fresh troops, including the 15th Sikhs and other regiments, heightened the anticipation of battle. The soldier, overwhelmed by the news of his unexpected inheritance and the imminent action, fell ill and was deemed unfit for duty. Despite his declining health, Corporal Flynn's spirits were lifted by memories of his homeland. After being mistakenly reported dead, Flynn showed signs of recovery. Meanwhile, preparations for battle under General Graham's command intensified, with a focus on temperance among the troops.

Osman displayed courage that evening by sending a bold challenge to his enemies. He boasted of his victories and dared General Graham to fight him. In response, General Graham reminded Osman of their own victories and advised him to surrender. The troops were then deployed for battle the next day. Although Osman did not join this expedition, Miles Milton did and distinguished himself in the following events. An expedition led by Sir John McNeill faced challenges and errors. The troops, including the 5th Lancers, Berkshire Regiment, Marines, and others, set out with a large convoy of camels and mules. The force encountered difficulties in the sandy plain and thick bush. Despite the challenges, the leader pushed forward with discipline. A trooper, Johnson, rode back, and Miles noticed his stern expression.

The order to resume the march here cut short the conversation, and the force continued its slow and all but impossible advance.

Sutherland, to amuse his sick friend, shared a detailed story of his recent experience at McNeill's zereba. Afterward, he prepared to address his friend as if in a legal setting. Hardy, having no close family, wished to leave his modest savings to his comrades, Miles and Armstrong. Despite some interest and forgotten items, he decided to make Miles the main beneficiary. As Hardy recovered, he was advised to rest at the Soldiers' Institute in Alexandria, run by Miss Robinson. The Institute, by the Mediterranean Sea, offered a refreshing change for Hardy's recuperation.

Miss Robinson, a kind-hearted woman, felt deeply for her soldier friends heading to war in Egypt, who had asked her to remember them despite the vast distance from home. She took their words to heart and raised funds to build a facility for the soldiers. With the help of Mr. Thomas Tufnell, they transformed an old Oratory into a welcoming space in Egypt, providing soldiers with a place to relax, play billiards, write letters, and enjoy the view of the sea.

That night, the group stumbled upon a peculiar and lively sight. They found themselves at one of Osman Digna's mountain camps, where men were gathering from all directions to join forces with their leader against the Europeans. Camels and other animals were transporting supplies for the large army, and wounded soldiers from recent battles were being cared for. The term _captivity_ may not fully convey the harsh reality to those who have never experienced personal bondage. The captive Britons endured not just physical mistreatment but also grueling work, lack of food, and rest, leading to apathy. Despite the difficult conditions, Jack Molloy stood out for his resilience. The Arabs' cruelty towards their captives was evident, especially towards Molloy, who bore heavier burdens than the others.

In a heartwarming tale, an old man and woman refused to be separated despite the workhouse's rules. They cherished each other and their humble home, adorned with a bit of blue that held sentimental value. Attending a tea party on a bitter night, they captured the workers' hearts. Miss Robinson's team swiftly provided warm clothing, showing compassion for the elderly couple.

As the night fell, exhausted listeners, much like the poor couple, sought rest on the hard ground, reflecting on the hardships endured. Days of harsh desert travel led the captives to a city where they faced disdain from the Arab soldiers and the curious gaze of onlookers.

"""Friends,"" whispered Molloy, as he sensed his turn was near, ""shall we attempt to escape? Fight our way out, run through the town, and make a dash for freedom, or face our fate courageously?"" While the prisoners pondered their options, their chains were secured, and they were led across an open courtyard to a dark staircase. As they descended, Stevenson urged Molloy to submit, despite his rebellious thoughts. The room at the bottom was dimly lit by a small high-up window, with bare walls and a hard earth floor. Simkin's bitterness towards religion sparked a debate on faith and righteousness among the captives. The next morning, a group of Soudan warriors gathered in the square, awaiting a leader. A powerful runner caught their attention, dressed simply but exuding authority. Soldiers escorted the captives into a public building where a stern man conversed with military figures."|['1.

In a short while, an official brought the prisoners before the Mahdi, who glared at them, focusing on Jack Molloy, the most noticeable among them. Molloy met his gaze with a defiant look and challenged the Mahdi's actions. The Mahdi, angered by Molloy's response, accused him of dishonoring his country. He ordered Molloy and his comrades to be taken away for siding with the oppressor. Miles was separated from his friends and led to a grand building. As Miles was locked in a simple room, he felt a sense of despair but managed to hold back tears. He found some food in the room, mainly rice, and ate heartily. Despite the circumstances, Miles tried to stay composed, reflecting on his situation and hoping for a better outcome.|"[""1.

Thinking, like reasoning, is better accomplished on a full stomach! He had slowly reasoned himself into a more optimistic frame of mind when he was once more disturbed by the arrival of guests - two armed individuals and the impressive black runner he had seen attending to the Mahdi's horse. One of the armed men carried a small package, which he placed on the ground before standing next to his companion. Both stood ready, like guards with unsheathed swords, seemingly prepared to follow the runner's orders. Up until this point, Miles and his fellow sufferers had worn the same clothes they were captured in, day and night. Therefore, Miles was not displeased at the thought of a change. After untying the package to inspect the replacement for his uniform, he discovered only a pair of loose cotton shorts and a red fez. The three serious, strong men mentioned earlier appeared so composed, and capable of carrying out their task, that our hero wisely accepted the situation and removed his uniform, which one of the guards collected as it was taken off. He then put on the shorts, which covered him from the waist to just below the knees. Once he had donned the red fez, he found himself dressed exactly like the runner, except for a small green scarf that barely covered his shoulders, serving more as an adornment than actual clothing, although it might have offered some protection from the sun.

""You will be in my place very soon,"" replied the messenger. ""I tried - twice. I got caught both times and was beaten nearly to death. But I survived! I gained wisdom; now I submit and wait for my chance to strike. If you are wise, you will start submitting and waiting too.""

""There is truth in what you say,"" responded Miles, after some thought. ""I will take your advice and wait, but only until the chance to escape arises. I would not harm the man even if I had the opportunity.""

The messenger nodded, ""Your words remind me of the good Gordon. He was not vengeful. He loved God,"" he said in a different tone. ""But Gordon was a white man. He did not - could not - understand the emotions of the black chief.""

This was accurate, as the tough journey Miles had endured and the heavy loads he had carried had strengthened his muscles to the point where his physique was almost on par with that of the negro, and suitable for a sculptor's work.

Miles faithfully followed his friend's instructions but couldn't resist stealing a glance at his new master. The cynical smile on the master's face and the crowd's hostile looks made Miles uneasy. Despite this, he held the Mahdi's stirrup with a neutral expression. The Mahdi pushed him onto the ground, signaling the direction to run. Miles felt a surge of anger but contained it. The Mahdi tested Miles by making him run for hours, causing distress. Passing slaves, he saw his friend Jack laboring. Miles stumbled, fell, and was struck by the Mahdi. Jack intervened, toppling the Mahdi. Jack was captured, and the Mahdi was injured. Miles was dragged back to his prison. The captives were separated and forced into hard labor.

As the rope tightened around his neck, he accepted his fate. Suddenly, his feet touched the ground again, the choking feeling subsiding. Mocking laughter revealed they had only half-hanged him. Despite blaming white men in general, he directed his anger at Miles, making him run at an exhausting pace and subjecting him to public humiliation. In the dark cell, Miles pondered his situation aloud, reflecting on the endless despair. He grappled with thoughts of violence but reminded himself of his past mistakes and the consequences.

The group unanimously agreed to have a quick meal in silence. Once they were done, they hurried on, eager to distance themselves from the approaching Arab army. Molloy raised a concern about avoiding encounters with more Arabs due to their lack of weapons. Moses suggested anchoring where they were, hiding in the bushes during the day, and only traveling at night. Miles added that desert men were skilled trackers and might notice their footprints leading to the bushes. Jack proposed a plan to deceive any trackers by creating a hidden hole in the sandbank and placing a bush in front of it.

The first day passed easily for the group. The excitement of their new journey was immense, and they eagerly discussed their hopes for the future. As night fell, they prepared to leave, praying for guidance. The marine, Stevenson, offered a quick prayer aloud, leaving his companions to join in as they wished. They traveled cautiously through the dark, mistaking bushes for enemies. By morning, they sought a hiding spot but found a recent battleground instead, strewn with bodies. Despite the gruesome scene, they pressed on, eventually resting on a hill. The discovery of a fallen English soldier made them ponder the tragedy of war. Equipped with weapons found on the site, they decided to stay hidden, as cheering in the distance hinted at ongoing conflict.|"['1.

"""Agreeing with Stevenson's advice to 'bide their time,' the little band quickly positioned themselves on the hillock for defense. They watched as the fight approached, with the English and Indian cavalry chasing the fleeing natives. A breeze carried the sounds and smoke of the battle towards them. As the native spearmen advanced towards the hillock, Miles instructed his men to fire by command, then lie flat to reload, and wait for further orders. When the savages reached them, Miles ordered to form a square and fire at will. The defenders stood back to back, fighting off the attackers with precision. Despite being outnumbered, they held their ground until overwhelmed by the savage host. Miles fought valiantly until he was struck down, the defenders' cheers drowned out by the enemy's fusillade."""|"['1.

Shortly after, footsteps were heard climbing the hill. Miles clutched his gun, but his weakening hand prevented him from fully cocking it. Just as despair was setting in, a familiar voice broke through. A group arrived with a stretcher just in time. Macleod stemmed the flow of blood, and they carried Miles away from the battlefield. The skirmish near Suakim cost Miles his hand, ending his military career. The surgeons amputated his hand above the wrist swiftly. Miles, though devastated, had no choice. He was sent to overcrowded hospitals, then to Alexandria for rest. His physical and emotional wounds weighed heavily on him. Despite his dire condition, Miles found solace in his mother's teachings.
