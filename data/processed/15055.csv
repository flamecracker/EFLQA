Shif'less Sol, perched atop the hill, surveyed the forest with great care. His gaze was fixed on something unusual, evident from the furrowed brow and intense stare. Not even the grazing buffaloes nearby could distract him. A majestic stag, sensing a foreign scent, raised its head in alarm, but the figure on the hill, unlike anything the deer had seen, paid no heed. Birds and small creatures cautiously approached the young man with yellow hair, sensing no danger. Sol's journey continued southward, leaving behind distinct footprints, a deliberate trail. He marked trees with a hatchet, a unique practice for a lone traveler.

Shif'less Sol, although appearing carefree, was incredibly observant in the forest. He noticed every movement and sound, even the softest leaf falling or a deer passing by. Despite lingering for an hour, he didn't rush to leave, leaving the fire smoldering and visible from afar. He deliberately left footprints and took small tree chips as he journeyed southward.

At sunrise, Shif'less Sol left a smoldering fire and ventured into the forest, leaving distinct footprints and cutting tree bark with his hatchet. At noon, he paused to light a fire and was delighted by what he saw. Henry Ware, a tall and neat-looking figure, joined him. They cooked and ate together in silence, enjoying the moment.

"""I am from one of the little white villages in the Kentucky woods far to the eastward. There we have fought the wilderness and twice we have driven back strong forces of the allied tribes, although they came with great resolution and were helped moreover by treachery,"" Paul said with a gravity beyond his years.

The settlements are here to stay, despite any challenges they may face. Paul, speaking with the wisdom of a prophet, declared that neither warriors nor kings could defeat their resolve. Enthralled by his vision, Paul saw great states and mighty cities instead of the Spaniard and the renegade Braxton Wyatt before him. The Spaniard, though impressed, asserted the power of kings to crush their settlements. Paul, undeterred, highlighted the peaceful relations with Spain and the support from France. He urged the Spaniard to avoid plots and treachery, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy over personal conflicts.

Paul calmly suggested that they should be friends and emphasized the natural alliance among white races. He advised the Spaniard to send away the tribes' messenger seeking help to harm innocent women and children. The Spaniard, while mentioning no personal quarrels, disagreed with Paul's claims about the American settlements and questioned the validity of his title to Kaintock. He hinted at the possibility of Spain reclaiming the region due to the ongoing changes in the east. Paul, realizing his failed mission, felt the Spaniard's cold demeanor and suspected Braxton Wyatt's influence. Alvarez, the Spaniard, displayed false courtesy towards Paul, offering him food and wine, while Wyatt plotted to extract information about the settlements in Kentucky. Despite feeling trapped, Paul maintained his composure and accepted the wine, using its strength to bolster his resolve.

Paul sat calmly on the hill, his deep blue eyes peacefully gazing at the forest. His eyes were warm and sympathetic, unlike Alvarez's. Paul was part of a group of five. Henry Ware, skilled in the woods, surpassed even the Indians in craftiness. Sol Hyde, known as the shiftless one, was swift and cunning. Tom Ross, a seasoned hunter, and Long Jim, the fastest runner, completed the group. As night fell, Alvarez, confident in his strength, set up camp with sentinels. The forest's darkness and eerie sounds made Alvarez uneasy, despite his brave front. The wind's moans and twisted shadows unnerved him, creating a sense of uncanny chill in the vast, wild wilderness.|"[""1.

Don Francisco Alvarez trembled, his shiver turning into a shudder. He glanced at his captive, Paul, who seemed lost in a trance, staring ahead with a mystical gaze. The lad appeared to be envisioning a grand future beyond their current predicament. Despite his bravery, Alvarez felt a sense of awe. After tending to the fire and instructing the guards, he settled back down. Observing Paul, he couldn't discern if the boy was asleep or awake, but his serene face hinted at slumber. As the night grew colder, Alvarez, longing for silence, watched his men doze off one by one. With the forest whispering around them, Alvarez pondered his allegiance to Spain and the unfolding events in Kentucky. He knew a decisive action was needed, and he was determined to secure Spain's interests in the vast valley.|"['1.

Francisco Alvarez lay awake in the wilderness at night, feeling anxious. The dying fire's last sparks flickered before fading. The sentinels watched carefully as the rest slept. Alvarez despised Braxton Wyatt but knew he could be useful. He also observed the prisoner, Paul, sleeping peacefully. The Spaniard felt a deep silence that unnerved him until a wolf's howl broke it. Although recognizing the sound, it still made him shiver. As the night wore on, the wolf's cry sounded closer, disturbing Alvarez. Eventually, exhausted, he succumbed to sleep as the forest lulled him with its quietness.|"[""1.

At sunrise, Francisco Alvarez woke up to a chilling realization. The prisoner had vanished from the camp. Startled, he found the sentinels gagged and bound. They explained that they were overpowered by unseen forces. Braxton Wyatt hinted at the presence of four cunning foes. Despite doubts, Alvarez acknowledged the warning signs.

Several days passed with little activity. The five individuals occasionally approached the Spanish camp, reporting that the men were lounging and waiting. Sometimes, the Spaniards hunted in groups, led by Braxton Wyatt, bringing back deer and buffalo. On the fourth day, Henry and Paul went hunting. Paul noticed the landscape becoming less hilly and more open. Eventually, they reached a vast, flat prairie teeming with countless dark animals grazing on sweet grass. Henry explained that this was nothing compared to the herds on the great plains. Suddenly, shots rang out, causing the buffalo herd to panic. A young Spaniard, Luiz, mistakenly shot a massive bull, provoking a dangerous charge. In fear, he fled towards the woods with the enraged beast at his heels. Paul and Henry recognized him as one of the sentinels.|['1.

Henry, Shif'less Sol, and Paul moved quietly through the bushes, undisturbed by the sounds around them. As they reached a vantage point overlooking the Spanish camp, they saw Francisco Alvarez surrounded by soldiers near a large campfire. The Spaniards were busy tending to the fire, adding more wood to keep it blazing brightly. The rain had stopped, and the sky cleared slightly, revealing a few stars. Suddenly, Braxton Wyatt, Yellow Panther, and Red Eagle emerged into the firelight, standing tall and imposing. Paul was surprised to see the Indian chiefs so far from their territories. Francisco Alvarez, recognizing the strength and dignity of the chiefs, approached them with respect, acknowledging their presence in the wilderness. Henry signaled Paul to pay close attention, as the scene before them held great significance.|"[""1.

Braxton Wyatt, the Spanish commander, Red Eagle, and Yellow Panther gathered around a fire, deep in conversation. Braxton Wyatt revealed detailed maps of the Kentucky settlements, plotting an attack on behalf of the Spanish. The group discussed plans to use cannon firepower to overpower the American settlers. Meanwhile, three watchers, including Paul, Henry, and Shif'less Sol, eavesdropped on the scheme. They realized that a war was imminent, with the Spanish aiming to drive off the Americans. Determined to thwart the attack, the group decided to follow Alvarez back to New Orleans and deliver a message to Governor General Bernardo Galvez.

Henry and Shif'less Sol spied on the Spanish camp the next day. They discovered that the two chiefs had left, but Braxton Wyatt stayed behind, planning to go with Alvarez to New Orleans. Shif'less Sol shared a story about how he once craved hickory nuts as a child and finally went to get them, ending his suffering. As predicted by Henry, the Spanish camp disbanded the next day, heading east without worry. The five borderers followed closely, observing Alvarez's every move. They were well-prepared with supplies and followed the trail easily. They marveled at the mighty Mississippi River, finding it both intimidating and fascinating. Shif'less Sol reflected on the river's journey, emphasizing its constant movement and ability to witness various lands and cultures.

In the dark of the night, Henry and Sol cautiously approached Alvarez's camp by the Mississippi River. They spotted the increased force of Alvarez and his men, who had arrived by boats. Henry deduced that Alvarez had left a detachment at the camp while he ventured inland, likely on an exploratory mission. The two woodsmen, Henry and Sol, shared a silent laugh as they plotted to retaliate against Alvarez for trying to hold Paul captive. They skillfully navigated through the thick bushes along the riverbank, evading the vigilant Spanish sentinels. With clever woodcraft tactics, they hatched a plan to distract the sentinel by mimicking a rattlesnake's hiss to create an opportunity to take action against Alvarez's forces. Their mission was not only to rescue Paul but also to prevent a war and protect the people of Kentucky from Alvarez's treacherous schemes.|"[""1.

He did not hear a light step behind him, but he did feel a powerful arm grasp him around the waist, pinning his own arms to his side, while a hand was clasped over his mouth, checking the ready cry that could not pass his lips. Then before his starting eyes a figure rose out of the bushes whence the hiss had come. It was not that of a rattlesnake, but that of a man, a tall man with powerful shoulders, blue eyes, and yellow hair, undoubtedly one of the ferocious Americans. The sentinel felt that his hour had come, and he began to patter his prayers in his throat, but the two Americans, the one before him, and the one who had grasped him from behind, did not slay him at once. Instead they said words together in their harsh tongue. Then they tore pieces from the sentinel's clothing, made a wad of it and pressed it into his mouth. They also tied a strip from the same clothing over his mouth and behind his head, and, still despoiling his clothing, they bound him hand and foot and laid him in the bushes, where he was invisible to his comrades and could only see a sky in which a few dim stars danced. But on the whole he was glad. They had not killed him as he had expected, and the gag in his mouth was soft. Moreover, his comrades would surely find him in time and release him.

They were now far out in the middle of the river, the strong current of the Mississippi aiding them. Glancing back, they saw men on the shore firing a volley of bullets that fell short. Shif'less Sol laughed, unbothered. Henry noticed the pursuers were disorganized, not gaining ground. The night grew darker, aiding their escape. Sol, feeling like a pirate, rowed harder. Suddenly, a bullet hit their boat from a Kentucky rifle. Henry, recognizing the sound, aimed at Braxton Wyatt but hesitated, sparing his life. Sol fired a warning shot, causing the pursuers to lose enthusiasm. The river's rising waters and dense trees concealed them, leaving the pursuing boats behind.|"[""1.

"They rowed deeper into the forest until they found a hidden spot among the trees. There, they paused and listened intently, hearing only the water lapping. ""Henry,"" exclaimed Shif'less Sol, ""we've stumbled upon a real treasure ship! These fine weapons must have belonged to the Spanish commander himself."" Sol then revealed duelling pistols and other tools from the boat, including blankets for trading with the Native Americans. ""These items will be useful for us out here in the woods,"" noted Henry.

All but Paul rowed urgently towards the center of the river, while he steered the boat steadily. Shouts of victory echoed behind them as they spotted a large war canoe with savages approaching. Paul, filled with inspiration, urged everyone to row harder. The boat sliced through the water, narrowly avoiding rifle shots.

One day, while navigating the river, Henry Ware and his companions noticed a high bluff covered in dense green forest on the eastern bank, a welcome change from the low shores. As they tied up the boat at a sharp curve around a peninsula, Henry's keen eye spotted a faint, dark line to the south at sunset.

Finally, they reached the other side and saw Spanish boats tied up with soldiers cooking around fires. Francisco Alvarez, the Spanish leader, exuded satisfaction, while Braxton Wyatt, a renegade, approached him in fine Spanish attire. Henry suspected their plans to harm the Kentucky settlements.

Wyatt politely approached Alvarez, who graciously offered him a seat on a nearby hillock. As Wyatt sat down, a soldier brought him a cup of wine, which he drank while seemingly toasting to the success of their alliance. Henry, observing this, grew angry, suspecting Wyatt might be spying on them with vital maps and plans. As they crouched low, Wyatt continued his camp inspection, consumed by thoughts of revenge against his former people. Suddenly, Wyatt, lost in his vengeful thoughts, mistook a shadow for Henry, causing him to panic and retreat back to the firelight. Realizing his mistake, Wyatt covered his fear by claiming he saw a rattlesnake. Though he tried to appear composed, Alvarez noticed his trembling body and pale face, revealing Wyatt's inner turmoil.|"['1.

"The Spanish man studied him closely, his cold blue eyes revealing nothing. Francisco Alvarez doubted that a brave frontiersman like Braxton Wyatt would be so scared after a harmless encounter with a snake. ""These rebels might reach Governor General Bernardo Galvez in New Orleans and ruin our plan,"" Alvarez explained. ""Galvez supports the rebels against England. How can a Spaniard aid republican rebels and harm the monarchy? If Kentucky grows, it will threaten Louisiana. We must deal with these daring and dangerous men in buckskins!""

"Francisco Alvarez leaned forward, his usually calm blue eyes now ablaze with passion. He spoke of his devotion to Spain's true interests. Braxton Wyatt, sharp and perceptive, instantly grasped his intentions. ""Bernardo Galvez may step down as Governor General of Louisiana,"" the renegade remarked. ""A more loyal successor is needed, one who won't aid rebels against the throne."" Alvarez praised Wyatt's insight and loyalty, emphasizing their shared goal to protect Spain's sovereignty. Meanwhile, Henry and Shif'less Sol observed from the thicket, thwarted in their plan to disarm Wyatt.

I like about sixteen hours of sleep out of the twenty-four, but when it comes to staying awake just long enough to eat three meals a day, I'm not in favor of it."" That day, they passed three canoes with Indians from a distance, but the canoes didn't come near. Henry noticed that the Indians looked sprawling and dirty, unlike the alert, clean-limbed natives of the North. As they approached settled parts of Louisiana, a serious problem arose. They were getting close to a region where they might be noticed, and they hadn't found an opportunity to capture Braxton Wyatt and his plans. Henry and Shif'less Sol observed Alvarez's camp, learning that he had turned from the Mississippi and set up a base near a bayou. They believed Alvarez might have a plantation nearby and was plotting mischief against the Americans. Henry and Shif'less Sol rose before daylight to investigate further, finding that Alvarez had started to move his forces, including a mix of laborers and soldiers. Alvarez, in his splendid attire, was about to head to his own house on a large land grant from the Spanish King.

Braxton Wyatt felt proud. He was the trusted friend of a capable man with a big dream. He and Alvarez, dressed as Spanish officers, rode through a plantation to a house with a pool in the center. Henry and Shif'less Sol followed them discreetly. They saw Alvarez enter the house along with others, including a Natchez Indian known as The Cat. After observing, they returned to their hidden boat in the cypress cove, planning another investigation later. Long Jim, feeling out of place in the southern climate, expressed his discomfort. As he and Henry sat by the boat, Long Jim heard a faint sound, likely another snake, prompting him to take a cautious walk along the bank.|"['1.

Paul was about to pass a large cypress tree when suddenly, strong arms grabbed him by the throat. Despite his strength, Long Jim found himself outnumbered by The Cat and several men who came out of hiding. Hearing the commotion, Paul quickly joined the fray. Facing off against Alvarez and Braxton Wyatt, Paul defended himself, armed with a sword he had unknowingly picked up. Alvarez, seeking to humiliate Paul, prepared to engage in a sword fight.

Alvarez moved closer, his sword flashing, but Paul skillfully deflected the strike. Surprised by Paul's skill, Alvarez was stung by the taunt. Despite Braxton Wyatt's anger, Alvarez chose to silence the taunter differently. Long Jim's cry spurred Paul to leap forward, thrust, and then retreat. Although Alvarez parried, Paul's blade cut his coat. Enraged, Alvarez rushed in, and Paul, recalling lessons from the French and Indian war, fought defensively. Their swords clashed, creating tension among the onlookers. Paul, despite a cut on his arm, remained focused. He swiftly struck Alvarez, piercing his side. In pain and fury, Alvarez's sword broke. Paul, displaying chivalry, spared Alvarez and tended to his wound. Alvarez acknowledged Paul's swordsmanship but insisted he surrender to avoid his soldiers' bullets.|"['1.

Paul handed over his weapon. He knew it was unwise to resist with armed soldiers nearby, but he felt proud of his brave act. He stood next to Long Jim, another prisoner, feeling a sense of accomplishment. His wound had stopped bleeding. Long Jim whispered, praising Paul's courage. As they walked with the soldiers, they passed through fields struggling against the wild growth. The Cat, a sinister figure, tried to hurt Paul, but he defended himself. A soldier named Luiz intervened, ensuring their safety. Paul felt the contrast between this fearful place and the freedom of Kentucky. They were locked in a log building behind the chateau. Alvarez, the commander, treated them harshly. Braxton Wyatt admired the chateau's mix of luxury and simplicity.

The Spanish commander, Alvarez, relaxed in his chair, enjoying the warmth of the south. Despite his preference for the sun over the cold North, he expressed relief that the expedition was over. He poured wine for himself and Wyatt, reflecting on the monotony of the wilderness. Wyatt, secretly pleased by Alvarez's defeat, feigned sympathy. Alvarez, planning to remain near New Orleans, felt powerful in his domain. Meanwhile, Paul and Long Jim found themselves imprisoned in a small log structure.

Long Jim's worries were unfounded. As dusk approached, Luiz and another man brought food and water, using gestures to offer it. The open door allowed fresh air in, easing their tension. Long Jim longed to escape, feeling confined. Francisco Alvarez, a Spaniard, arrived, causing tension. Paul and Long Jim remained seated, showing their disdain.

His head felt heavy and his lungs choked. Jim felt likewise and made audible complaint, but the door was soon opened, and again it was Luiz and a comrade with food.

"""Which way now, Mr. Spaniard?"" asked Long Jim. Luiz, the Spaniard, remained silent and led them down a narrow path lined with magnolias and cypresses. Soldiers surrounded Paul and Long Jim, but all eyes were on Paul. As they walked, glimpses of a chateau and murmurs of voices reached Paul's ears.

Suddenly, soldiers grabbed Long Jim and pushed Paul through a gate with a sword handed to him. The gate closed behind Paul, leaving him inside a circular space. He found himself facing Francisco Alvarez and Braxton Wyatt, surrounded by a diverse crowd eagerly watching him.

The large man, reminiscent of ancient gladiators, faced Paul, a boy, with a long sword. The crowd cheered for the impending fight, but some felt uneasy. Long Jim protested, calling it murder.

The swordsman, feeling certain of victory, stepped back as the crowd erupted in cheers. Long Jim, loyal and brave, shut his eyes, anticipating what was to come. The triumphant swordsman proudly raised his weapon, a gleaming cutlass-like blade. Suddenly, a shot rang out, causing the swordsman to cry out in pain as his sword shattered. Francisco Alvarez, filled with anger, couldn't see who fired the shot, but Braxton Wyatt recognized Henry Ware. Despite the soldiers rushing in, Henry surrendered peacefully, asserting his authority. The group was taken to a log house as prisoners. Alvarez, trying to maintain his pride, ordered their confinement. Paul, with a minor injury, was cared for by Luiz. As they sat in the prison, Henry explained how they stumbled upon the commotion in the woods, ready to face any challenge together.|"['1.

The afternoon at the log prison was uneventful except for Luiz's visit, bringing water and bandages for Paul's shoulder. Henry and Long Jim skillfully dressed the wound, relying on Paul's healthy blood to heal him quickly. Luiz, grateful and understanding, extended his hand in an American gesture. Henry, perceptive, recalled Luiz's heroic act in saving Paul from a charging bull. Despite Braxton Wyatt's attempt to provoke Henry, he remained composed, a formidable figure.

When the renegade departed, Henry quietly settled into a cane chair, unwilling to confront the man who exuded an air of superiority. Francisco Alvarez, noting Henry's reaction, smiled inwardly, assured of the youth's character. With a rare display of courtesy, Alvarez expressed remorse for his earlier actions, attributing them to provocation and ill advice. He acknowledged Henry's strength and leadership among his comrades, hinting at a future alliance. Despite the flattering words, Henry sensed a hidden agenda in Alvarez's smooth speech. Alvarez hinted at his grand plans for the land and foresaw the demise of the fledgling settlements in Kaintock. Henry, recognizing the veiled threats beneath the compliments, braced himself for the looming danger.

"""It's a long way to Europe,"" he said, ""but news reaches even the deepest woods. I have friends in Spain near the court who keep me informed of any changes."" Henry disliked the condescending smile. Francisco Alvarez's mistake was assuming a superior attitude, a common error made by strong men when faced with others of equal strength. Henry's intuition put him on guard immediately.

""I value you and your abilities,"" Alvarez said slowly. ""Why join the rebels rushing into destruction? Listen carefully. Major events are unfolding on this continent. Not just the war between the Americans and the English, but more change is coming.""

Alvarez painted a picture of Spain's strategic position in New Orleans at the mouth of the mighty Mississippi River. He envisioned it surpassing London and Paris, offering a vast fertile land in Louisiana. He extended an invitation for Henry and his friends to join him, promising opportunities beyond their wildest dreams.

Alvarez's conviction was evident in his powerful words. He offered Henry a chance to stay in Louisiana and contribute to a great cause.

Henry was amazed by Alvarez's grand plan but still harbored a deep respect for the man's ambition. Although the offer was tempting, Henry remained loyal to his people in Kentucky. He refused to abandon them for the promise of a brighter future. Alvarez, angered by Henry's rejection, insulted him, calling him ignorant and unworthy. Unfazed, Henry calmly pointed out Alvarez's betrayal of Braxton Wyatt, showing that he could not be trusted. Alvarez, feeling threatened, reached for his sword but withdrew, realizing he had overstepped. Determined to break Henry's spirit, Alvarez plotted a new scheme.

"The rebel's eyes gleamed with joy, unhidden. Fear had gripped him when he was banished from the hall, afraid of Alvarez's schemes. Now, it was clear that nothing had changed. ""Put them on him,"" commanded Alvarez as soldiers closed in. Henry pushed back the first two, but others prepared to pounce when a voice halted them. A tall man in black, with a stern face and sparkling eyes, intervened. Father Montigny, calm and dignified, rebuked Alvarez for unjustly chaining Henry. The soldiers hesitated, crossing themselves.

The unexpected arrival of Father Montigny left Francisco Alvarez feeling uneasy. He knew the priest was aware of his intentions, causing Alvarez to question how much Father Montigny truly knew.

The priest stood up and pointed at Alvarez, who froze in fear. Despite his initial fear, Alvarez regained his composure. He denied any involvement in a plot against Bernardo Galvez or Kentucky. The priest warned Alvarez to treat the Kaintock prisoners humanely. In the nearby forest, a mysterious figure emerged, observing the log hut where Alvarez kept the prisoners. The moonlight revealed his features: tanned skin, yellow hair, and a strong build, unlike any local residents.

At the edge of the bushes, he paused and observed the prison for a moment. Two soldiers stood guard in front of it, wearing Spanish uniforms. They were convinced that the unarmed prisoners inside couldn't escape. The soldiers chatted about girls back in Spain, smoking cigarritos. Unnoticed, a shadow slipped past them to the rear of the log prison. A man appeared at a window slit, giving a warning hiss. The soldiers, engrossed in their conversation, didn't notice the man or the faint metallic sounds inside the prison. The man in the shadows melted away into the forest.

The moonlight shone briefly on their knives before the swift strike. One man stood unscathed, while the other fell silently, gazing at the moon. The fallen man, with a feline face and scant clothing, lay still. The unharmed one glanced back before vanishing into the woods. As morning arrived, Luiz brought them breakfast. They ate heartily, showing cheer despite recent events. Paul's arm healed quickly, a testament to his robust health. Later, Francisco Alvarez and Braxton Wyatt arrived, bearing a sealed document from the Governor General. Alvarez, displeased, cursed quietly upon reading the message. The orders were clear: bring the four prisoners from Kaintock to New Orleans immediately. Alvarez vowed to comply, eager to please the Governor General and punish those who had wronged him.

He was already planning a future project. Initially, they cleaned the boat, removing mud and debris gathered during its river journey. Shif'less Sol and Jim Hart volunteered to scrape the bottom. While cleaning, a catfish startled Long Jim, but they completed the task. Later, Henry and Paul set off to hunt deer for food. The boys enjoyed the fresh air, the lush forest, and the abundance of wildlife around them, feeling the joy of being alive in the wilderness.|"['1.

They ventured further, with Henry leading them left, away from the creek, guided by instinct or the lay of the land. The trees thinned, revealing a beautiful rolling prairie. The open space was lush with grass and wildflowers, where animals grazed in the distance. Intrigued, the boys circled the prairie, staying close to the woods, approaching a herd of about thirty wild horses. A magnificent white stallion stood out, larger and more majestic than the rest, with a flowing white mane and tail. As they observed, a stealthy cougar lurked nearby, eyeing the herd. Sensing danger, the stallion bravely defended his herd, trampling the cougar to protect his own. The boys marveled at the stallion's courage and leadership in the face of danger.|"['1.

The herd had fled in fear from the cougar's attack, but the stallion bravely defended them. After the battle, he strutted back to the herd, his mane flowing in victory. However, danger lurked as men with ropes approached. Hidden in the grass, they aimed for the stallion. The men's plan unfolded as one threw the rope, capturing the stallion. Despite their efforts, the stallion broke free, leaving the men defeated. With a triumphant neigh, he dashed away, his tail a symbol of his victory.

The group had a close call with a horse but managed to find a deer in the woods. Henry's shot downed the deer, and they returned to the boat with the catch. Concerned about Alvarez and his men nearby, they hurriedly set sail down the Mississippi. Passing boats of curious onlookers, they realized they were nearing New Orleans. Shif'less Sol advised Long Jim on city behavior, warning against unnecessary gun use. The group decided to rest in a cove to save strength for the next day. As twilight fell, they secured the boat and set up camp, relieved to be out of Indian territory and free to relax.|"['1.

Paul stirred himself, searching for wood. Soon, he discovered a dead branch at the water's edge, long enough to break into sticks. As he raised it to break it, the branch moved! One end whipped like a tail, narrowly missing Paul, while the other split open to reveal sharp teeth. Startled, Paul leaped back as Henry fired at the creature. Shif'less Sol remarked on the deceptiveness of southern creatures, and Long Jim suggested a large fire to ward off dangers. Approaching New Orleans, they marveled at the bustling river and diverse ships. The officer on the shore observed them with curiosity, impressed by their strength.

Lieutenant Diégo Bernal, a sharp officer in the bustling city of New Orleans, directed the group to the Governor General's residence for an audience the next day. The diverse crowd of onlookers included peddlers selling goods, women balancing cans on their heads, and merchants offering various items. Long Jim, one of the group, joked about being robbed due to his limited funds. The group hired a watchman to guard their boat and entered the city through the gate, encountering Spanish soldiers practicing drills. They longed to meet Governor General Bernardo Galvez immediately but found out he was busy with official matters. As they explored the city, they observed the gallows and notable buildings like the parish church and the Ursuline Nuns' convent, marveling at the architectural grandeur of New Orleans.|"['1.

"""I never smelled such smells before in all my life,"" he said, pointing to the heaps of garbage scattered about. ""A big town like this is powerful interesting, but it isn't clean. Paul, remember those great forests up there in Kentucky and across the Ohio! Remember how clean and nice the ground is! Remember all those big, fine, friendly trees, millions and millions of them! Remember all those nice little springs of clean, cold water, clear enough to be looking glasses, one, and sometimes more, every three or four hundred yards! Remember all those nice smells of the wild flowers, and the trees, and the grass, and me sitting at the foot of the biggest tree of them all, cooking on a roaring fire, fat, juicy buffalo and deer steaks for you fellers!""

They strolled back into the Place d'Armes, where the review was still in progress, and where more people were gathering. The women were bare-headed, and generally wore a short round skirt, and long overgarments, the two invariably of different, but bright, colors. All of them wore much ribbon and jewelry, but, as a rule, they were too dark of countenance to suit the ideas of the five concerning feminine beauty. At rare intervals, however, they saw a girl with light hair and light eyes and light complexion, and all these were really handsome.

"Henry, the usual leader of the group, locked eyes with Diégo Bernal and noticed a sly wink. Henry quickly assessed Diégo's character and suspicions arose. ""I can see where your allegiance lies between Bernardo Galvez and Francisco Alvarez,"" Henry remarked. ""The boat we commandeered belonged to Captain Alvarez. We took it after his unwarranted attack and his sinister plans to incite Indian tribes against us in Kentucky with Spanish forces, aiming to ally Spain with England against America."" Lieutenant Diégo Bernal, a well-dressed man, took a pinch of snuff, a habit unfamiliar to the group. ""Speak discreetly,"" he advised. ""This news is significant.

It's wise to have allies in New Orleans. I believe I have some influence, despite my usual forgetfulness.""

In New Orleans, Monsieur Gilibert, a large man from the North of France, observed five strangers with rifles. He suspected they were from the far North wilderness. Although he disliked Spanish rule, he admired Lieutenant Diégo Bernal, a Catalan. The group ordered drinks at the inn, surprising Lieutenant Bernal with their preference for mild West Indian orange water over rum or wine. Alonzo Menocal, a West Indian Spaniard, challenged Henry, a youth from Kaintock, to a strength test. Henry effortlessly lifted Menocal, impressing everyone in the inn, including Monsieur Gilibert.

Paul sat at the back of the boat, gazing at New Orleans. The city both attracted and repelled him. It intrigued him, but he had no wish to live there. New Orleans was like a gateway to the old world, with centuries of history, yet Paul's heart belonged to the New World. He watched boats on the Mississippi, heard foreign songs, and saw the city bustling at night. Paul and Henry decided to explore New Orleans, finding it uncanny in the darkness.

Henry and Paul decided not to make a fuss about being shot at in New Orleans. They suspected it was the work of Braxton Wyatt or another ally of the Spaniard, Alvarez.

To prove it! You are strangers before Alvarez, the Spanish commander in Northern Louisiana. He gained access to Galvez, the Governor General, with a plausible tale. Mr. Pollock spoke rapidly to a sentinel in Spanish, securing their reception. The ante-chamber was furnished with Spanish arms and rich rugs. They were asked to leave their rifles, a sign of the Kentucky rifle's fame. They entered a room with soldiers and found Bernardo Galvez, who greeted them warmly.

"The large door swung open once more, and the usher introduced Don Francisco and his assistant, Señor Braxton Wyatt. The five were surprised and upset by the boldness of the renegade, but they remained silent. Alvarez entered the room, calm and serious, but his demeanor did not seem to bother his superior. It hinted at a belief that the Governor General would appropriately punish the audacity of the intruders from Kaintock. He glanced at them briefly, showing his confidence in overcoming such minor opponents. Paul and Henry felt their anger rise, about to witness a remarkable display of Spanish flexibility and skill. Braxton Wyatt tried to mimic his leader's supercilious look, but the group paid him no heed. Alvarez saluted the Governor General, who returned the gesture.

""It is the plan to send him a prisoner to Spain on the galleon, Doña Isabel, as you know, but I fear that we have not heard the last of him. He is a man of fierce temper, and now he is wild with rage and mortification. Moreover, he has many followers here in New Orleans. All the desperadoes, adventurers, former galley slaves, and others of that type would have been ready to rally around him. But I have come to tell you good-bye. I go again in my canoe up the Mississippi.""

""No,"" replied Father Montigny, ""I cannot stay. You came on your task in spite of hardships and dangers because you felt that a power urged you to it. Farewell. We may meet again or we may not, as Heaven wills.""

The journey began the next day as planned. Henry, Paul, and Long Jim were in one boat, while Tom Ross and Shif'less Sol were in another nearby. The people of New Orleans gathered on the levee to bid them farewell, with mixed feelings of good and bad wishes. The French mostly supported them, while the Spanish were against them. Despite this, the group felt only joy as they set off. The breeze carried the essence of the northern forests over the mighty river, invigorating them. As they rowed away, leaving the city and its intrigues behind, they felt a sense of freedom. The fleet moved in unison, heading towards Fort Pitt, with Henry and Paul rowing alongside the others. Long Jim expressed his delight at being surrounded by untouched nature, away from civilization. The day passed smoothly, with the wilderness enveloping them, and they found a peaceful cove to rest for the night. Henry and Shif'less Sol scouted the area, ensuring their safety.|"['1.

All five travelers rested on the shore, sleeping wrapped in their blankets under the trees. At daybreak, they resumed their journey. Progress was slow due to the heavy current of the Mississippi. Henry, Shif'less Sol, and Tom Ross scouted the woods along the shore, proving to be the best hunters in the group, supplying game for the others. As days passed, they encountered fewer people, who avoided them. Despite the wild men in the fleet, led by Adam Colfax, discipline was maintained. Each night, half the men camped ashore, enjoying fires, cooking, and music. Passing near the Chateau of Beaulieu, Henry and Shif'less Sol found it occupied by Spanish soldiers. They suspected the presence of their enemies, Braxton Wyatt and Alvarez, nearby. Later, they spotted a canoe with two mysterious occupants ahead of them on the water.|"[""1.

A group of boats tried to catch up to a canoe but failed. The two skilled Indians in the canoe stayed ahead. Henry and Paul joined the chase but lost the canoe when it turned into a smaller river. Later, the group found a good campsite and set up tents despite the rainy weather. Henry, Shif'less Sol, and Tom Ross patrolled the area for danger. They heard wolf howls, signaling the presence of potential threats. Henry suspected Braxton Wyatt and southern tribes nearby. The trio split up to watch for enemies.

Henry found himself alone as Shif'less Sol and Tom Ross disappeared. His instincts kicked in, sensing danger. The wolf's howl added to the tension. Henry stayed alert, ready to spot any danger first. The sky darkened, the wind whispered eerily, and rain fell sporadically. Despite the eerie forest, Henry remained calm. He stayed hidden by an oak, scanning the surroundings. Suddenly, movement in a thicket caught his eye. An Indian warrior disguised as a wolf emerged. Henry took aim and fired, alerting the camp of the impending attack.

"""Everyone, lie down!"" shouted Henry, and everyone quickly followed the command. The night battle in the wilderness began silently. The savages surrounded the voyagers, their fire beads flashing from every bush. The men on the boats joined the land force at the riverbank to defend. The savages' war whoop echoed, but the voyagers remained silent, avoiding unnecessary noise. Adam Colfax, the leader, prevented his men from advancing further, knowing the savages' strength. Both sides exchanged fire, bullets hitting true occasionally. The Americans held their ground, with Colfax wisely avoiding a risky offensive. The cannons fired, causing chaos among the savages. Despite casualties, the Americans remained resilient, saving their bullets for strategic shots.

Adam Colfax brewed coffee on the boats equipped with cooking facilities and served it to the soldiers fighting on shore in the darkness.

"""Men, grab your axes!"" Adam Colfax yelled, and a dozen obeyed swiftly. The tree was cut down and the halves were dragged to clear a path for the fleet.

Many of the Indian canoes sank due to the explosion or the sweep of the supply fleet. Their occupants, if not seriously hurt, escaped to the land, swelling the savage numbers in the woods on the north bank of the bayou. Henry and his friends heard their warning cries and realized their skirmishers in the woods were in trouble. A determined effort was needed to hold back the horde while the men reached the fleet. Skirmishers sprang into the Mississippi, swimming swiftly for the boats, driven back by rifle fire. Despite being separated from the other men who had landed, they remained resolute, ready to defend until the last fugitive was safe. The deadly riflemen faced a growing enemy force, bullets flying around them, but they stood firm, concentrated on their task.|['1.

"A branch snapped beneath Paul's feet, and a sudden shout pierced the air. Startled, he faced Don Francisco Alvarez, the fierce leader of the attacking army. Alvarez, wounded and wild, aimed his pistol at Paul, ready to fire. Just in time, a mysterious figure in black robes intervened, saving Paul from the deadly shot.

Paul was frozen in shock, unable to move. Shif'less Sol, however, sprang into action, swiftly taking down Alvarez with a shot from his rifle. Father Montigny, lying wounded, shared a tender moment with Paul, acknowledging their deep connection. Despite the chaos of battle resuming around them, Paul knew he had to rejoin the fight to defend their crucial position.

Reluctantly leaving the priest and the fallen Alvarez behind, Paul prepared to face the ongoing conflict ahead. The priest's peaceful face gazed up at the sky, while Alvarez's motionless form lingered in the shadows. With a heavy heart, Paul turned away, ready to fulfill his duty on the battlefield."|"[""1.
