Living at Aldercliffe or Pine Lea, with their grand mansions, lush lawns, and vibrant gardens, seemed far more appealing than the dullness of Freeman's Falls. The Fernald estates boasted horses, cars, tennis courts, and even canoes by the river. Despite the wealth and luxury, Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Clarence Fernald were pitied for their crippled heir, Laurie Fernald. Laurie, with his gentle smile, evoked sympathy from all. The Fernalds' every action revolved around Laurie's condition, prompting visits from renowned doctors and causing tension. Laurie's kind nature and resilience endeared him to the townspeople, who admired his patience and sweetness. Despite his vast inheritance, no one envied Laurie's life, as his struggles were evident, contrasting sharply with his family's opulence.|"[""1.

Not far away, almost hidden by the thick branches, stood his small cabin, brightly lit! A sudden wave of alarm chilled him, and two possible explanations raced through his mind - either a fire had started inside, or intruders were plundering his home. He recalled leaving a window open that morning, making it an easy target for thieves. It couldn't be the Fernald workers; they were trustworthy. Perhaps strangers from Melton had arrived by boat and taken over his cabin for the night. Determined to confront them, he cautiously approached the window. To his surprise, inside sat Mr. Wharton and Mr. Clarence Fernald, illuminated by electric lights that had been installed in his absence. Ted was amazed by the kindness and secrecy of the Fernalds, and he entered the room with gratitude.|"['1.

Ted had few friends who shared his interests. While his peers enjoyed sports, Ted's passion lay in building a wireless device. Most of his acquaintances lacked the dedication to join him in this endeavor, leaving Ted feeling isolated. The only person who understood his enthusiasm was a slightly older assistant at school. However, when Ted's father dismissed the idea of a more knowledgeable companion like Mr. Laurie, Ted's hopes were dashed.

Eventually, Mr. Clarence agreed to tell the truth due to Laurie's persistence and the fact that Laurie had saved his son's life.

"""I'm afraid his fascination with sound vibrations cost him precious sleep,"" the tutor remarked. ""But the results were worth the sacrifice. He experimented with a piano, have you tried singing into it with the pedal down? The string tuned to your voice will vibrate while others stay silent. Alexander Graham Bell, with his keen ear and insight, saw more in these piano string experiments. He discovered that this sympathetic vibration could be replicated electrically using electromagnets under piano strings. By interrupting the electric current, different strings vibrated, akin to sending multiple messages at once using different pitches.

Mr. Hazen agreed that progress often happens slowly, with unexpected breakthroughs. Mr. Bell and his team faced setbacks in perfecting the harmonic telegraph. Despite their efforts, success seemed distant. One day in June, a seemingly ordinary moment led to a groundbreaking discovery. Mr. Bell, with his acute hearing, adjusted the instruments in the loft. In a moment of frustration, Watson snapped a spring, unknowingly creating the first telephone call. The current generated mimicked sound vibrations, transmitting a faint echo to Mr. Bell.

"""Yes, it was like magic, was it not?"" replied the tutor. ""For the speaking telephone was born at that moment. Whatever practical work was necessary to make the invention perfect (and there were many, many details to be solved) was done afterward. But on June 2, 1875, the telephone as Bell had dreamed it came into the world. That single demonstration on that hot morning in Williams's shop proved myriad facts to the inventor. One was that if a mechanism could transmit the many complex vibrations of one sound it could do the same for any sound, even human speech. He saw now that the intricate paraphernalia he had supposed necessary to achieve his long-imagined result was not to be needed, for did not the simple contrivance in his hand do the trick? The two men in the stuffy little loft could scarcely contain their delight. For hours they went on repeating the experiment in order to make sure they were really awake. They verified their discovery beyond all shadow of doubt. One spring and then another was tried and always the same great law acted with invariable precision. Heat, fatigue, even the dingy garret itself was forgotten in the flight of those busy, exultant hours.

"""No,"" Mr. Hazen admitted. ""They had lacked opportunity to make such tests since no great span of wires was accessible to them. But on October 9, 1876, the Walworth Manufacturing Company gave them permission to try out their device on the Company's private telegraph line that ran from Boston to Cambridge. The distance to be sure was only two miles but it might as well have been two thousand so far as the excitement of the two workers went. Their baby had never been out of doors. Now at last it was to take the air! Fancy how thrilling the prospect was! As the wire over which they were to make the experiment was in use during the day, they were forced to wait until the plant was closed for the night. Then Watson, with his tools and his telephone under his arm, went to the Cambridge office where he impatiently listened for Mr. Bell's signal to come over the Morse sounder. When he had heard this and thereby made certain that Bell was at the other end of the line, he cut out the sounder, connected the telephone he had brought with him, and put his ear to the transmitter.""

These experiments helped spread the word about the telephone, attracting more attention. Mr. Bell's small laboratory became a hub for scientists and curious visitors. The novelty of talking over the wire made many people feel self-conscious. Some were so overwhelmed that they could only giggle or say silly things. In April 1877, the first outdoor telephone line was set up in Charles Williams' shop, creating a buzz in the community.

The tutor mentioned that despite the fun, creating the telephone was hard work. The early telephones were large and lacked bells for signaling. People had to agree on a time to talk or use Morse code. The first calling device was a thumper inside the box, later replaced by a buzzer. Mr. Watson improved the device further, creating the magneto-electric call bell we use today. Edwin T. Holmes, who managed his father's burglar-alarm office, played a crucial role in the telephone's success. The switchboard was essential for connecting callers.

"""I wish you were,"" his grandfather said softly, patting his grandson's shoulder kindly. ""If money could buy health, I'd give you all I have. But some things money can't do, Laurie. I used to think it was all-powerful, but life's best gifts are beyond its reach. We grow wiser with age,"" he sighed. ""I sometimes wish we had two lives, one to learn and one to live.""

""Well, we live and learn; it's never too late to learn from mistakes,"" he continued. ""I've learned from Ted Turner, his father, and even from Sullivan and Cronin. Maybe I can make Freeman's Falls better. We'll see.""

The winter was harsh, with cold and ice. Despite illness and depression among mill workers, the Fernalds kept operations running, even at a loss. Ted Turner saw a new side of manufacturing, understanding the struggles of employers and workers.

Mr. Clarence Fernald, a man of wisdom from a younger generation, took breaks twice a year for leisure trips. Despite trying to escape work, he was always pursued by responsibilities. Even during family time, worries about his son's health lingered. However, his tutoring sessions with Laurie and Mr. Hazen brought joy. The boys' friendship flourished, and Ted's bond with the Fernald family deepened. When Laurie fell ill with measles, Ted was moved to a nearby shack for safety. Despite the change, Ted found comfort in the familiar surroundings. As spring approached, the melting snow caused a rush of water and ice downstream, creating a spectacle of nature's power.|"['1.

Despite the rising river levels and abnormal conditions, nobody felt anxious initially. However, the ice and water against the dam were significant. Ted, alone in the shack, woke to water seeping in. The river had surged overnight, submerging bushes and trees. Ted debated whether to warn others. Seeing debris from Melton swept by, he knew action was urgent. Ted urgently asked about lifting water gates at the mills to prevent flooding downstream. He was advised to leave immediately to avoid danger.

During the next hour, Ted was too occupied to realize the frantic rush of events he had initiated. The Fernalds and their team worked tirelessly to prevent a disaster that Ted's warning had averted. The mills were alerted, and the sluices opened to allow the snow, ice, and water to flow. The scene was chaotic as the torrent surged over the falls into the chasm below, flooding the fields. Despite the turmoil, the factories and homes at Aldercliffe and Pine Lea stood strong on higher ground. Ted watched his hut float away in the flood, feeling grateful for his escape. The teacher comforted him, reminding him of the broader impact of the tragedy on the villagers. Ted felt remorse for not helping sooner and decided to join the efforts in the town to assist those affected.|"['1.

Mr. Fernald assured that the upcoming settlement would provide better homes for those affected by the recent disaster. The burst of the Melton reservoir caused the catastrophe, and the old reservoir collapsed due to neglect. Despite the severe damage, Mr. Fernald promised new houses to uplift the spirits of the affected families. The sudden calamity wiped out most buildings along the riverfront, cutting off communication. The disaster was unforeseen, and the town faced a week of chaos. However, the Fernalds found a silver lining in the event, as it cleared the way for improvements like a new granite bridge and a potential park. In the end, the calamity brought about unexpected opportunities for positive change.|['1.
