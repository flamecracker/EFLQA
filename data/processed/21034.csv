The slender boy effortlessly climbed the tree and skillfully plucked the remaining fruit, dropping two of the largest peaches into Agnes' robe as she stood by. He then filled his own shirt and waist with the rest of the peaches. Agnes, intrigued by the boy's actions, beckoned him to sit beside her on the porch step.

"In just five minutes, Ruth joined them on the back porch, looking neat, fresh, and cheerful. Her smile was infectious, with dimples forming at the corners of her mouth and laughter sparkling in her eyes. The white-haired boy seemed to like her now that they were closer.

When school started, the girls quickly returned to their usual groups, or cliques. Miss Georgiana Shipman, a plump lady with a warm smile, had a special way of connecting with her students. Despite not having conventional beauty, her smile covered up any flaws. Even the mischievous boys, who had troubled pasts, transformed under her guidance. Miss Georgiana's influence was profound; she pushed her students to excel and showed them the right path. Girls gathered around her after school, drawn to her kind nature and guidance. Her home, with three large oak trees, was a popular spot for girls to gather. Invitations to tea at her place were highly coveted.

Trix Severn used to bother Agnes, the second oldest girl in the Corner House, by whispering irrelevant things during her recitations. This behavior annoyed Agnes so much that she finally snapped at Trix one afternoon. The teacher intervened, advising Agnes to control her nerves and not react impulsively. Meanwhile, the four kittens at the Corner House provided entertainment with their playful antics. One of the kittens, Popocatepetl, caused chaos in the kitchen while chasing a feather, knocking down kitchen tools and spilling molasses. Despite the commotion, the girls found humor in the kittens' mischievous behavior. Uncle Rufus had saved duck feathers for pillows, but the kittens' antics led to a messy situation in the kitchen.|"[""1.

The cat swiftly maneuvered through the sticky molasses on the floor, leaving paw imprints behind. In a comical turn of events, it then leaped into a box of feathers, much to the amusement of the onlookers. The girls, along with Popocatepetl, rushed out of the house, causing a commotion that caught the attention of Neale O'Neil, who was tending to Mr. Con Murphy's garden nearby. Neale quickly scaled a tree to rescue the stranded cat, Petal, from a high branch.

When the girls emerged bundled up, Neale had already crafted several large snowballs. They joined him, and their cheerful banter and laughter let the whole neighborhood know that the Corner House girls were ready for some fun. The girls and their friend had a blast building a snowman, using a bucket as a hat, coal for eyes and a nose, and Uncle Rufus's old clay pipe for his mouth. The snowman looked quite dapper for a while, but by bedtime, he was almost buried in snow. The next morning, the snow continued to fall, and a strong wind created drifts that covered the windows. Despite the blizzard, they managed to have breakfast by lamplight. Mrs. MacCall insisted on Neale staying put and even brought him breakfast in bed. Ruth and Agnes cleared paths around the house, tackling the deep snowdrifts. The blizzard had closed the schools, giving the students an unexpected break until the streets were clear.|"['1.

Sadie was assigned to write about Longfellow, and Miss Andrews used her composition as an example of spreading misinformation about famous figures. Agnes' teacher, Miss Shipman, allowed Agnes to read Sadie's work. In the composition, Sadie claimed that Longfellow was a great man who wrote both poems and poetry, graduated from Bowdoin, and taught at the same school he graduated from. She also mentioned that Longfellow went to Europe to learn to be a poet and wrote rhymes for children like 'Billy, the Blacksmith.' Tess, Agnes' sister, remarked that Sadie might not know much about poets but was good at math. The girls laughed about the funny composition, and Agnes pointed out that primary students often mix up facts and misinformation. Meanwhile, the boys at Milton High School were busy building a snow castle on the Parade Ground, with the structure illuminated by Joe Eldred and Neale O'Neil's creative use of electric lighting.|"['1.

The castle was not fancy enough for the builders, so they added a false front with towers made of ice illuminated at night. After the crowd left, some boys flooded the frozen floor for skating. The best skaters were invited for a show on Saturday. The castle's battlements were raised with lighted towers at each corner and a pinnacle with a star on top. A large crowd gathered for the event. The Corner House girls found the castle enchanting. Ruth and Agnes went skating there. Neale chose Aggie as his partner, leaving Trix alone due to her habit of criticizing others. Neale made a small skating pond for Tess and Dot. Dr. Forsyth and his wife, childless, took a keen interest in the Corner House girls.

Ruth and Agnes accompanied Trix Severn home, but they didn't go inside as Trix wanted. The next morning, Trix walked to school with Agnes.

Tess shared with Mr. Sorber how unique Neale was, able to harness Billy Bumps, climb trees, and do cartwheels exceptionally well. Mr. Sorber added how Neale had been taken into the Lions' Den at a tender age, dressed in spangled pants with a sugar lollypop to hush him. Tess defended Neale's uncle, saying he couldn't be ashamed of him. The children's warmth eventually won Mr. Sorber over, leading to a visit to the summer-house to meet the family.

"Mr. Sorber chuckled, ""But you can't satisfy some folks. Those rowdies were clamoring for their money. As I was saying, I was multitasking, selling tickets and showcasing the lions. I had the cashbox with me when I sought refuge during the chaos and even took it into the lions' den with me."" With a grin, he announced, ""Here's your money, folks.
