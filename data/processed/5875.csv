"In a previous book, ""The Rover Boys at School,"" the story began at Putnam Hall, a military boarding school on Cayuga Lake, New York. The three brothers, Dick, Tom, and Sam, were sent there by their uncle Randolph Rover. The boys' father, Anderson Rover, a wealthy mine owner and explorer, had vanished in Africa years earlier. With their mother deceased, the boys found themselves in the care of their eccentric uncle, who was engrossed in farming. When summer vacation arrived, the boys proposed a sailing trip along the Hudson River and Long Island Sound aboard the yacht _Spray_, chartered by their guardian. As they navigated the waters, they encountered friends and foes from Putnam Hall, setting the stage for new adventures. As the _Spray_ faced a potential collision with another boat, the Rover boys braced themselves for the unexpected encounter."|"['1. What is the setting of the story at the beginning?\nA. Africa\nB.

"""John is correct; you have been watching this boat,"" grumbled the old sailor named Bill Goss, who, for reasons known only to himself, was completely under his younger master's control. ""If I had my way, I'd punish all of you!"" And he shook his fist at the occupants of the _Spray_. Dick was stopped in his tracks. While Bill Goss spoke, a sudden gust of wind caught the _Spray_ and pushed her to the right. The _Falcon_ swiftly approached and collided with the Rover boys' boat. The impact made the _Spray_ tremble from bow to stern, and with a hole in her side, she began to slowly sink. ""Pull her away, quickly, Bill!"" whispered Mumps to the old sailor, who immediately stepped forward and used a long boathook to separate the two yachts. The _Falcon_ changed direction and moved away. Sam defiantly stated, ""We won't ask for your help. I'd rather drown."" But Sam didn't mean it literally. They could all swim and were not in immediate danger. The two boats were now far apart, making communication difficult. The Rover boys focused on the _Spray_. ""We are going down,"" Tom groaned. ""Steer her towards the shore, Sam."" Following the advice, they ran aground on a muddy and rocky flat near the riverbank. The mainsail and jib were lowered, and the"|"['1.

Dick remarked that they needed to get closer as they observed the sailor raising the mainsail of the _Falcon_. A light breeze carried the yacht away from the shore, disappearing into the darkening horizon. Seated on a rock, they deliberated the mysterious situation, suspecting Josiah Crabtree of scheming something deceitful. The next morning, they woke to a sunny day at half-past seven. Tom roused the group, and they headed for breakfast. Josiah Crabtree joined them, eating oatmeal in silence. After breakfast, a peculiar Italian with a bear and monkeys arrived. Tom played a prank on the monkeys, causing chaos when they discovered the spiked sugar cakes. The bear, affected by the pepper, caused a commotion, leading the monkeys to flee in fear.|"['1.

Jocko, the mischievous monkey, caused chaos at the summer house. He grabbed a lady's hairpiece, making her scream. A young man tried to help, but Jocko was too quick, snatching his hat and climbing a tree. Chaos ensued as a bear chased people around the grounds. The situation escalated when the bear cornered some individuals in the stable. Tom regretted the chaos and tried to help by closing the stable doors. A hostler attempted to scare the bear with an ax-handle but ended up fleeing in fear. The Italian man, using a thin line and a muzzle, managed to calm the bear down. Eventually, everyone boarded a yacht headed for Albany, ending the vacation. Despite the light wind, the boys enjoyed fishing on the calm river before preparing dinner aboard the yacht.|"[""1.

As the day wore on and they sailed further from Albany, the midday meal was served. Along with the food they had already mentioned, they enjoyed coffee, bread, butter, and the remains of a coconut pie bought the day before. The boys, being hearty eaters, devoured the meal quickly. After eating, the wind died down completely, prompting Sam to suggest anchoring near the shore for a swim. The others agreed, and soon they were splashing in the water. The cold water surprised them, and Sam, who had eaten a lot, felt sick. Despite feeling unwell, he kept quiet so as not to worry his brothers. While swimming, Sam got into trouble, but Tom came to his rescue, helping him recover from nearly drowning. It was a scary experience, but they managed to get through it.|"['1.

The search for the missing young man began in the tenement rooms of Girk and Baxter. The place was turned upside down, but no trace of Dick was found until Tom looked under the table. The search continued, but the writing materials and scraps of paper found on the small writing table were of no help. As the search wore on, the tired tenants returned to their apartments. Frank suggested that perhaps Dick was waiting at their house, so the trio decided to head home. Walking through the deserted streets, they worried about their missing friend. In a dark and cobweb-filled bin, Dick managed to free himself from his bonds using an empty tomato can.|"[""1.

Captain Lambert followed the request, and soon the three Rover boys were on the _Cedar Queen_. The captain was friendly and eager to hear the boys' story. The town was bustling with a circus and a real estate auction, leaving the boys with only a small room. Despite this, their focus was on Dora and the villains who had taken her.

Dick, Sam, and Tom hurried to the Searchlight after purchasing supplies from a nearby grocery. They loaded up on coffee, sugar, canned goods, vegetables, bread, salt, crackers, cake, and fruit. Setting sail down the Hudson, they were joined by Martin Harris. As they sailed smoothly with the wind in their favor, Harris sought details to avoid legal issues. Meanwhile, Dora was locked in the cabin by Dan Baxter and his accomplice. Dora, drugged through food, realized she was being taken away from home against her will. Despite her struggles, she was powerless and feared for her mother's safety. The journey felt like a dream as she was veiled and led onto a train, plagued by a haunting nightmare.|['1.

The boat ride ended, and Baxter and Mumps helped her to the river where the _Flyaway_ awaited. Bill Goss had informed his wife of her arrival. Mrs. Goss was described as coarse and unprincipled like her husband. Feeling helpless, she worried about her fate, praying for safety. Hours passed, with Mrs. Goss coming and going. Dora longed to swim to shore as they sailed close to land. A man in a flatboat approached. Despite her fear of the dark water, Dora leaped to the dock. Pursued by two boys and a sailor, she called for help in vain. Once more, Dora found herself captive on the _Flyaway_, sailing towards the ocean. She heard about a man claiming she escaped from an asylum, but she was wary after a past encounter with a troubled individual.|['1.

The farmer felt like talking back but stayed silent. He accepted his mistake, admitting he was tricked. As the _Searchlight_ changed course quickly, the city buildings blocked the wind. Martin Harris noticed the skilled sailor on the ferryboat. They passed the Statue of Liberty, wondering about Dan Baxter's next move. Dick confronted Baxter, calling him a rascal. A woman escaped and joined the _Flyaway_, looking scared. The yachts were close, stars shining until dark clouds approached. A sailor pretended to fire at them, causing Baxter to shoot the mainsail. Dick decided to land with Sam, leaving the others on the yacht. They landed in a desolate area with old boats nearby. Dick wished for a weapon as Baxter fired. They made clubs from nearby brush, ready for anything.|['1.

The policeman, feeling a bit seasick, hoped for the chase to succeed. The _Flyaway_ was ahead, sails full, with the _Searchlight_ trailing. As Sandy Hook lighthouse faded in the distance, the crew remained determined. They speculated the thieves might change course to evade capture. Suddenly, a breeze pushed the yachts closer together, reigniting the pursuit. Dick discovered an old electric light on board, and with some tinkering, he managed to get it working. Meanwhile, Martin Harris prepared a lantern and reflector to aid in spotting the _Flyaway_.

The man was furious upon seeing the lantern on the mast of the _Searchlight_. He took aim and shot at it, shattering the globe, reflector, and tin cup, causing oil to spill and ignite. Sam felt the heat of the flames on his cheek and leg. He was quickly extinguished and suffered only minor burns. The crew rushed to help, putting out fires on the sails. Despite the damage, they decided to continue the chase for the _Flyaway_. Martin Harris steered the ship towards the coast to find a safe landing spot.

"""I believe I can,"" replied his older brother. ""Yes, it's happening now!"" he continued. ""Thank goodness!"" and he suddenly lifted his arm and flexed his fingers. By morning, his injured arm was almost back to normal. This was an unforgettable experience for Dick. Sam had bandaged his burn with a cloth soaked in oil and flour, feeling much better. ""But when I catch those Baxters,"" he added, ""I won't be gentle with them."" As the sun rose, both yachts were far out at sea with no land in sight. The wind was strong but not as fierce as before, making it difficult for Martin Harris to close the gap between his boat and the enemy's. Arnold Baxter was armed with a shotgun, while Buddy Girk and Dan Baxter had pistols. Mumps stayed hidden, and Bill Goss steered the boat. Dora and Mrs. Goss stayed below deck. ""You must surrender and face trial,"" Sergeant Brown stated. ""There's no other option. If you resist, it won't end well for you."" ""I've shown them I'm not scared of them,"" Mumps said, turning away. Then he glanced back nervously. ""I hope they find it and see what's inside!"" he whispered. ""I'm so tired of this group!

"Sergeant Brown was asked about his guns, stating he and Carter each had two pistols. One pistol was given to Dick, the other to Tom. Sam and Harris were to arm themselves if needed, but mainly focus on sailing the _Searchlight_. As the ship neared, they identified it as a large ""tramp"" from South America. A tramp steamer sails without a set route, picking up cargo along the way. The fog thickened, making it hard to see. Suddenly, a collision occurred, causing chaos.
