On a crisp September morning, a faint hint of autumn lingered in the air. In the cozy dooryard of the Red Mill, two girls busily shelled dried lima beans under the shade of the old trees for the coming winter. Ruth Fielding suggested accompanying Tom to meet the evening train, but couldn't leave Aunt Alvirah with all the beans to shell. The girls discussed helping Jane Ann Hicks, who was left in the care of her thoughtless Uncle Bill. Helen mentioned that The Fox and Heavy would ensure the other girls behaved, especially after the fun they had at Silver Ranch. Tom arrived in a rush, mentioning that the railroad employees were not allowed to discuss accidents. They all quickly set off in the Cameron's car towards Applegate Crossing, passing by Uncle Jabez at the mill in their speedy departure.|"['1.

Tom continued driving without slowing down as they approached the crossroad at the Forks, which was not as well-maintained as the river highway. They covered many miles until they glimpsed the aftermath of a train collision. A freight train had delayed, causing an express train to collide with it. The freight suffered more damage than the passenger cars. A crowd had gathered around a menagerie car that was smashed, raising fears of wild animals escaping. While Ruth and Helen searched for Jane Ann Hicks, Tom noticed the commotion near the broken menagerie cars. The girls rushed towards a group of passengers, where they found a figure on the ground being tended to by a girl named Jinny. Ruth and her friends helped carry the injured Jerry Sheming to safety. Suddenly, screams erupted from the crowd near the derailed freight train, and the friends saw a cat-like creature on a branch below.|"['1.

In thirty minutes, the car came to a stop at Dr. Davison's gate, marked by green lamps. Jerry Sheming had regained consciousness and was more concerned about fainting than his injured leg. Ruth learned some of his story through questions. He wasn't on the train with Jane Ann during the accident and couldn't afford the fare between stations. Dr. Davison suggested taking Jerry to their house, believing it would benefit Uncle Jabez. Jane Ann was set to go to Outlook, the Camerons' home, before school resumed. Tom joked about her luggage, implying she might need to borrow clothes. The car reached the cottage gate, where Aunt Alvirah awaited, surprised to see Jerry being brought in.

Before dinner, a man rode up to the mill on horseback and warned the miller and his family about three dangerous beasts that had escaped from wrecked menagerie cars nearby. The beasts included a big black panther, a lion, and a lioness. The neighbor informed them that the menagerie men had lost the animals in the nearby woods. Despite being told that the lions were tame, the neighbor preferred not to take any chances. The family quickly closed up the mill and the cottage, preparing for the potential danger. As the evening progressed, the fear of the escaped animals loomed over them. Suddenly, a crouching creature was spotted outside, heading towards an open window. The young man, armed with a gun, took aim and fired at the creature, which turned out to be the black panther. Luckily, the shot hit the panther, and Uncle Jabez attended to the injured Jerry with unexpected care.|['1.

Ruth Fielding was deeply intrigued by the young man injured in the railroad wreck. At the Red Mill that evening, she made a hero of him to her friends.

Jerry was asked to stay at the Red Mill for a while. Uncle Jabez thought highly of him and wanted to hire him for the upcoming fall work. Jane Ann also left some money for Sheming's use. She was touched by Sheming's independence and how he only accepted a pair of cuff links as a gift. The girls, especially Ruth and Helen, were nervous about their second year at Briarwood. They wondered about their studies, teachers, and how they would be treated. Jane Ann requested to room with Ruth and Helen, ending their trio with Mercy. Despite being fearless in her own environment, Jane Ann was anxious about fitting in at the boarding school. Ruth, on the other hand, felt proud of Uncle Jabez's approval and received pocket money from him before heading back to school. The girls, along with other Briarwood students, embarked on their journey to Osago Lake, where they met Madge and her brother Bob.

Ruth was excited about the fall term at Briarwood but couldn't shake off thoughts of Jerry Sheming. Belle Tingley's invitation reminded her of the boy who saved Ann Hicks at Applegate Crossing. Ruth's interest peaked when she learned Jerry had ties to an island Belle's father owned for hunting. Jerry's tale of his uncle's lost treasure intrigued Ruth. Despite Aunt Alvirah's difficulty with writing, Ruth learned Jerry worked for Uncle Jabez. Ruth regretted not contacting Jerry before he left. While many girls accepted the Christmas invitation to Cliff Island, Ruth hesitated, unsure of her uncle's response.

Ann Hicks was brought into the party by Ruth. The girls who had been unkind to Ann were there. Luckily, some smaller girls needed help. Ann noticed a swing that needed fixing. She climbed up and secured the swing. Even though the rope wasn't perfect, she coiled it and threw it at a bush. The little girls cheered. Meanwhile, some older girls were trying to row a boat, but they were in trouble as they had no oars. They shouted for help, and a man ran to assist. Ann, with a coil of rope, led a group of girls down to help. The situation was serious, but help was on the way.|['1.

"Ann grunted, ""I'd ought to. I've roped enough steers. Why, you're Jerry Sheming,"" she exclaimed, peering into his face. ""Ruth Fielding wants to see you. Don't run off before she talks to you."" The punt rested in shallow water, and the girls without oars were safe until the teachers arrived. Ruth, Helen, and other students joined. Heavy took charge. ""Now, see what she did?"" the stout girl said, embracing Ann. ""If she couldn't lasso and rope a steer, she couldn't have saved us."" Cheers erupted. Girls who had teased Ann sought forgiveness. Ann, unsure of her place, played with younger kids. She pointed Ruth to Jerry Sheming. ""I love the woods. I can cook, shoot, and guide,"" Jerry told Ruth. They discussed a trip to Cliff Island.

Ann, a girl from the west, grappled with the desire for genuine friendships based on her character. Belle Tingley invited Ann to Cliff Island, where she felt included yet doubted the sincerity of the invitation. As the school term neared its end, preparations for a play and a dance kept the students busy.

The girls from Briarwood were all set for a sleigh ride into the woods to gather holly berries and cedar buds for wreaths. Ann Hicks, usually silent, joined them at the last moment. As they ventured into the woods, an unexpected accident occurred. Old Dolliver's boy fell from a tree, gasping for air but miraculously unharmed. In a bold move, Ann swiftly rode off on a mustang to seek help. She reached the physician's gate, explained the situation, and led the doctor back to the injured boy. Despite the unconventional and unladylike act, Ann's bravery earned her respect from all, including the doctor and the injured boy. This incident made her a heroine and won her admiration, even from the English teacher, who usually held strict standards. Later, the girls embarked on a special midnight train journey to Cliff Island, arranged by Mr. Tingley.|"['**1.

The boys from Seven Oaks Military Academy and the girls from Briarwood had a rare chance to mingle at a dance. Belle's mother, the chaperone, got the girls ready for a trip to Logwood. The girls quickly gathered their things and headed to meet Old Dolliver and his sleigh. Meanwhile, the boys walked into town. When Tom Cameron and his friends arrived, the girls were already settled in the car. As the storm began, the boys joined the girls on the train. Playful snowball fights ensued, causing a ruckus. Isadore got caught up in the fun and was playfully locked out of the moving train by Heavy and Ann. Luckily, he was found by the conductor and returned safely.

As the snow fell heavily outside, a group of unexpected guests found themselves stranded at a small inn near Logwood. The party, led by Mrs. Tingley and her son Ralph, had come for a vacation but were now facing the reality of being snowed in. The inn, mainly frequented by fishermen and hunters, was ill-prepared for the unexpected visitors. Plans to cross to Cliff Island were dashed due to the broken ice caused by the heavy snow. Meanwhile, a fort-building competition ensued in the open field behind the inn, with Tom leading one team and Ann the other. Despite the fun, hunger eventually drove everyone inside for a disappointing lunch. Discussions about the island's ownership and potential legal issues added a layer of mystery to their unexpected stay.|"['1.

Ruth felt embarrassed as she worried about causing trouble for her classmate's father, Jerry Sheming. Mrs. Tingley, who also wanted to meet the real estate man, shared Ruth's concern. The man, a brown, wrinkled figure with pepper-and-salt whiskers, demanded to know if Jerry had been removed from the island. Ruth believed Jerry's story about a treasure box, and she suspected that the man, Rufus Blent, wanted to find it. Ruth was determined to help Jerry and stop Blent's unjust actions. She knew she was the only one who felt as strongly about the situation. As the snow fell outside, Ruth pondered how to protect Jerry from Blent's schemes.

A dock held a steamer trapped by ice, while a railroad vanished into thick woods. Young folks were fixated on Cliff Island, miles away. Shrouded in snow, the island boasted a hunting lodge at one end. At the other, a rocky promontory soared with a lone pine atop. The western side was jagged with boulders, some bare of snow, standing out starkly. The actual cliff, for which the island was named, was hidden. The townsfolk left the inn when the sun peeked out, and ox teams cleared paths. Kids and Mrs. Tingley headed to the dock, singing. A boat with sweeps was the chosen mode to navigate the icy lake to Cliff Island. Mrs. Tingley was wary but agreed it was safe. Jerry was to be fetched back by Rufe Blent, with a constable in tow, under dubious charges. The boat edged through the ice, and Mrs. Tingley fretted for the safety of the children.|['1.

Ruth and Tom Cameron couldn't talk much until the punt neared the island. The current was faster there, and the ice was cleared. A new stone dock led to a lodge with two stories and rough log walls. The upper story had big beams and a glass-enclosed veranda. As they arrived, Jerry Sheming was missing, and the boys were whispering with Tom. Ruth suspected Tom's motives. Blent warned everyone not to help Jerry, who had fled. Blent, determined to catch Jerry, organized a search.

Tom and his friends set out on a mission to help Jerry, who was being hunted down by Blent and the constable. They carefully planned to leave food for Jerry in a tin box to ensure he wouldn't go hungry while in hiding. The group, including Ruth and her friends, navigated the island, avoiding the constable's party searching for Jerry. Tom was concerned about Lem Daggett's presence on the island and the risk it posed to Jerry. Despite the challenges and the possibility of being followed, the group pressed on to deliver the food and a note to warn Jerry of the danger.

The group had to pause frequently to catch their breath and navigate around the massive rocks along the way. Although the lodge and the lone pine were only a short distance apart, the terrain made the journey challenging. As they reached the base of the final hill, they spotted a towering old pine tree, standing dead but majestic among the other trees. The hill sloped upwards like a smooth cone, offering a view of the island's western end. Despite the snow covering the ground, they pressed on, carefully climbing the heights. Concerned about the cold and wind, they hurried to find shelter. Tom secured the food while the others made their way down the slope. Ruth, bringing up the rear, followed their tracks, until she slipped near a cliff's edge. Worried, they searched for her, but Ruth was nowhere to be seen, lost in the snow-covered precipice.|"['1.

The surprise of falling fifty feet through the air and landing safely left the girl from Red Mill momentarily speechless. Led by Jerry along a snow-free shelf, they reached a rock-wall hollow with a small fire and signs of the fugitive's camp. Ruth explained the morning's search for Jerry. He quickly wrote a message, tied it to an arrow, and shot it out of sight. Jerry shared his past success with a bow and arrow, then disappeared from view to avoid the shouting friends above. Ruth watched as the arrow vanished over the cliff's edge. Jerry revealed he might know where Uncle Pete's hidden treasure was. He also suspected Blent's deceit in claiming ownership of the island.

"The young woodsman, still suspicious, admitted, ""It's mighty nice of you."" He then guided her through a narrow passage from the circular cave to the creek, where her friends were expected. The path alternated between a tunnel and cuts in the hills, revealing the sky above. The gradual descent followed a water-course that led to a swift stream. Emerging behind thick brush, they were hidden from view. Jerry, setting down the lantern and rifle, explained how the water-trail could confuse pursuers like Lem Daggett.

After breakfast, the group headed to the lake for some ice skating. Mercy stayed back, but later, the boys convinced her and Mrs. Tingley to join by setting up chairs for them to be pushed around the ice. They then played a game of hockey, splitting into boys versus girls. Ann Hicks, who had never played before, quickly got the hang of it and they all had a great time. Ruth couldn't find the tools Jerry mentioned the day before. She sought help from Mr. Preston, who pointed out the landslide where the treasure was buried. Ruth decided to seek the tools with Tom's help. Sneaking out while others were busy with Christmas preparations, they climbed to the spot where the tools were hidden. Looking out, they saw figures approaching the island from the mainland.|"['1.

On a cheerful Christmas morning, every guest at the house party received thoughtful gifts, including Mercy, who gave heartfelt keepsakes despite her limited resources. The young friends joyfully unwrapped their presents for two hours before being enticed by the aroma of breakfast. As they gathered in the dining room, Mr. Tingley, a jovial man, arrived. Ruth, a girl from Red Mill, defended a boy named Jerry, claiming he deserved better treatment than he was receiving. Mr. Tingley, impressed by Ruth's loyalty, promised to investigate the situation further. Later, the group enjoyed thrilling iceboat races on the frozen lake, with some boats facing challenges while others sailed smoothly towards victory.|"['1.

Tom and Ruth were on an iceboat, rushing down the course, following another boat. Suddenly, a rifle shot rang out, causing Helen to scream. Ruth risked a look back and saw Mr. Tingley and Preston hurrying towards the brook, followed by several men with guns. They feared for Jerry, who was being confronted by the armed men near the stream. As the iceboat neared the shore, they all disembarked and climbed up to a plateau to witness the scene unfolding. Daggett and his men were holding Jerry at gunpoint, claiming a warrant from a justice of the peace. Tingley threatened legal action if they didn't leave the island immediately. Jerry, under duress, was forced to comply with their demands.|"['1.

The situation was quickly understood. Squire Keller authorized the warrant based on Rufus Blent's complaint. Jerry was accused of stealing ammunition and a revolver. The items were discovered in an old shed at Logwood where Jerry had stayed after leaving Cliff Island. Mr. Tingley disputed the accusation, stating that Jerry had not been to Logwood since arriving on the island. Despite the challenges, Mr. Tingley assured Jerry of his support and promised to hire a lawyer for his defense. Preston, the foreman, warned of potential threats from Blent and his associates, emphasizing the need for caution. Mr. Tingley acknowledged the risks but remained determined to stand by Jerry and protect him from any harm.|"[""1.

Mr. Tingley was determined to ensure Jerry's fair treatment in the backwoods courts. Ruth was relieved by his firm stance. Quickly, he arranged for guards and even armed them if necessary. He rushed to the mainland to prevent Blent from manipulating the situation. Ruth regretted the events that led to Jerry's arrest. However, Mr. Tingley's swift actions gave hope. He delayed Jerry's case until a lawyer could assist. Despite setbacks, the community rallied behind Jerry. Mr. Tingley's efforts paid off when a lawyer from New York arrived to represent Jerry. Excitement filled the air as they planned to attend the court session. The next day, they enjoyed snow-shoeing before heading to Logwood for the court proceedings. To everyone's surprise, the case against Jerry was dropped, and he was set free.|"[""1.

When Lem Daggett allowed Jerry to enter the jail, some of Blent's troublemakers swiftly took Jerry to the railway yard, placed him on a moving freight train, bribed a brakeman with two dollars as instructed by the real estate agent. Jerry was unlikely to disembark until the train had traveled fifty miles west unless he jumped while it was in motion. However, this information did not surface immediately. The town found humor in Mr. Tingley's predicament. Despite the laughter, Ruth couldn't shake her worry about Jerry. The following day, the group organized a fishing trip, except for Mercy. They ventured on snowshoes to a secluded cove with good fishing prospects. After setting up their fishing spots and windbreaks, they anticipated a day of angling. The fishing was a success, with everyone enjoying the competition and camaraderie while enduring the freezing weather.|"['1.

Tom and Ruth prepared a delicious dinner with fish and other food brought from home. They enjoyed their meal with thirteen friends under the shelter of a high cliff. Unaware of the snowfall at first, they later noticed the thick flakes covering the area. Despite trying to shield themselves with canvas, they decided to head back when the snow accumulated. Gathering their catch of frozen fish, they rushed to the shore as the snowstorm intensified. The group sought refuge in a nearby cave, lighting a fire to keep warm. The boys packed up their gear on a sled, navigating through the deepening snow with the girls. Everyone made it to the cave safely, where they settled in by the fire, grateful for the shelter.|['1.

The group of girls and boys shook off the snow and settled in the cave. The fire crackled, spreading warmth. Laughter filled the air as they cleaned and arranged the space. Eager for fun, they played games, sang songs, and even penned a humorous tale about George Washington. Suddenly, a cry from Tom interrupted their merriment. A heavy thud followed, and the boys rushed to the entrance, now blocked by an avalanche of snow. Tom was trapped. Realizing they couldn't be rescued from outside, Ruth suggested finding a way through the tunnel to the brookside. Remembering Jerry had left a lantern and kerosene, they set off through the passages, hoping to find a way out.|"['1.

They emerged into a narrow cut with little snow, indicating the storm still raged. The wind's moaning from the hilltop trees reached them. Ruth, determined, explored the passages with a lantern. She noticed disturbed sand, hinting at human presence. Despite her nerves, she pressed on, stifling sobs. Gathering courage, she ventured into a third passage, climbing shelves over stones. Tom, frustrated with Ralph, dug with a broken spade, revealing a cavity. As Tom flung the spade forward, it pierced through a thin layer. Ralph recalled a landslide during his father's island purchase. Tom enlarged the hole, connecting the cavities. They entered the new space, eager to explore further.|"['1.

"Ruth's keen eyes scanned the cavern, noting its circular shape with a domed ceiling and shelves high above. Some ledges tilted inward, making it hard to see. ""I wouldn't advise touching it,"" Ruth pondered. She suspected the cave contained hidden treasures, possibly related to Rufus Blent's sale of the island. Meanwhile, back at camp, the absence of Ruth and her friends worried the group. As time passed, anxiety grew. Bob hoped they would return soon, especially with the storm outside.

Jerry quickly disappeared into the darkness, leaving Helen and the others to rush back to the campfire where the worried group awaited. Meanwhile, Jerry stumbled upon a significant discovery when he encountered Ruth and her friends carrying a heavy ironbound box from a cave. Recognizing it as his uncle's chest holding money and papers, Jerry felt a sense of responsibility. Ruth suggested he hide it again, but Jerry insisted it belonged to his uncle, believing it could help him regain his memory. The group then ventured through a tunnel to keep the box a secret, agreeing only to inform Mr. Tingley.
