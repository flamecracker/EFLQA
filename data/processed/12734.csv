"Chapter I: The Cub Engineers Reach Camp

Tom and Harry, accompanied by a young driver, were on a mountain springboard wagon pulled by two slender horses.

The group was on a bumpy wagon ride, trying to avoid being heard by a stranger named Bad Pete. The wagon's noisy axles and springs muffled their voices. Bad Pete, ahead of them, seemed oblivious, smoking a cigarette and enjoying the view. The road ran along a steep cliff, with the Snake River far below. Tom suggested asking Bad Pete for directions to the S.B. & L. field camp. As they approached, Bad Pete finally noticed them, reaching for his revolver. Tom explained they were newbies joining the engineers. Bad Pete seemed uninterested, rolling a cigarette. The driver mentioned how the old days of gun-wielding outlaws were fading, replaced by modern conveniences. Tom argued that Bad Pete's gun was more for show than actual danger.|"['1.

In the old days of Gridley, six schoolboys formed a group known as Dick & Co. Led by Dick Prescott, they excelled in sports at Central Grammar School, gaining fame as junior athletes. As they progressed to high school, they became outstanding athletes in baseball and football. Despite their athletic success, none of them attended college. Dick and Greg joined the United States Military Academy at West Point, while Dave and Dan pursued the Navy at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis. Tom and Harry, fascinated by civil engineering, worked with a local engineer during school vacations. After graduation, they landed jobs in New York with the S.B. & L., starting with low pay but promising opportunities. The boys arrived at a mountain camp after a long journey, surrounded by rocky walls and equipped with engineering tools like a transit and a plane table.|['1.

Tom and Harry cautiously circled the camp until they reached a wooden building. Tom, mindful of manners, approached the open door from the side to avoid seeming like he was peeking inside. Knocking softly, they entered and were surprised by what they saw. The room contained several tables, utensils on the walls, and two stoves. A man was cooking at one of the stoves. When they inquired about Mr. Thurston, the cook's helper directed them to wait. A man, known as Bad Pete, warned Tom to keep quiet in his presence. Just then, a sun-browned man in khaki trousers and a blue flannel shirt arrived, exuding an air of shrewdness and firmness.|['1.

Tom expressed determination not to be abandoned by Mr. Thurston, stating that he, along with Mr. Blaisdell and Hazelton, would persevere no matter what. They were willing to put in the effort needed, even if it meant staying up all night to learn. The urgency stemmed from their financial constraints, as they lacked the means to return home. The assistant engineer highlighted the challenge they faced with the S.B. & L. project, which required completion by a set deadline. The rival W.C. & A. railroad posed a threat due to its substantial financial backing and political influence, making the situation even more precarious. The pressure was on to finish the project on time to avoid losing control of the railroad and the potential profits it could bring.

Bad Pete was absent from breakfast this morning, having successfully stolen from the cook's supplies overnight without being caught. Feeling frustrated by the two new boys causing trouble, Pete vowed to settle the score. The team began their survey work, with Rutter leading the way and explaining the importance of accurate surveying and leveling. Tom carefully set up his transit to begin the measurements, using a vernier to record precise angles. The chainmen started laying out the distance with a chain, guided by Tom's careful observations through the transit. Each metal stake placed marked a specific point, ensuring the accuracy of the survey. Tom closely monitored the chainmen's progress to keep the measurements on track.|"[""1.

After some time had passed, the chainmen measured the distance between Tom's stake and the rod on the next stake. The rodman signaled back the measurement. Nine sweeps of his right arm meant nine chains, then forty-four links of a tenth chain, followed by seven movements of the left hand for seven-tenths of a link. Tom noted the distance as nine chains, forty-four and seven-tenths links. Rutter nodded in approval. Tom reflected on the importance of accuracy and speed in surveying. He then navigated around an unfordable pond with precision, creating a new course and completing three sides of a square.

The gunshots echoed in the air as the tension rose. Tom, seemingly focused on his task, silently counted the shots. By the sixth shot, Reade swiftly reacted, grabbing a nearby stone and skillfully hurling it towards Bad Pete. Tom's precision surprised even his adversaries. Despite the praise, Rutter cautioned Tom about the dangers of provoking someone like Bad Pete, known for his marksmanship. Tom, unfazed, explained how his friend Harry had insisted on buying guns for their journey, a decision Tom found unnecessary and risky.

Jake Wren rushed over with a pot of boiling water as instructed. The Native American woman took it and asked for bowls and cups. When Jake returned with them, he stayed to watch. After he left, the woman took out herbs from her dress and distributed them in the bowls and cups. The chief warned that she would stop if caught being watched, as they were secretive about treating snakebites. Meanwhile, Tom started retching violently after drinking the herbal mixture. The woman then called for coffee, which helped Tom feel better. Harry, relieved, joked about Tom's snoring. Everyone had to wait and hope for Tom's recovery.|"['1.

Mr. Thurston assured Tom that he needed to rest after the shock he experienced the day before. Resting in camp for a day would prepare him for the upcoming challenges. Tom, feeling disheartened after the engineers left camp, tried to engage with the cook, but the busy meal preparations hindered their conversation. Tom expressed his talent in drawing maps with precision but lacked the artistic touch. Mr. Thurston acknowledged Tom's skills and asked him to demonstrate his abilities.

Tom and his boss were alone once more. Reade continued working quietly for thirty minutes. Suddenly, there was a stir in camp as four drovers arrived with two dozen horses for the engineering team.

Tom acknowledged dryly that he had never considered the trait of impulsiveness being linked to people with black eyes. However, he humorously noted that those who are overly impulsive often end up with black eyes themselves. After a confrontation with 'Gene Black, the other engineers made it clear that Tom was well-regarded in the group, causing Black to be treated with coldness. Despite this, Black proved to be a proficient civil engineer and was assigned to lead a squad for a critical task. Mr. Thurston commended Black's work, which indicated significant cost savings in the excavation process. Tom raised concerns about discrepancies in the field notes, prompting a thorough investigation to ensure accuracy.

Tom and Harry quickly grabbed their hats and rushed out. They instructed Trotter to prepare three ponies. While Tom selected the best leveling tool, Hazelton gathered the rods and a chain. The group then moved forward in a single file, with Tom leading the way. Leveling requires some skill and care. Tom made sure his telescope was level and took a reading at the second stake held by Harry, which showed a height of eight feet four inches. Moving on, Tom sighted back to the first stake and read two feet three inches. The difference indicated a rise of six feet one inch between the stakes. They continued this process for ten stakes, recording each reading carefully. Harry questioned why someone would make deliberate mistakes, suspecting Black might be sabotaging the project for a rival company.
