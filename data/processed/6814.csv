Janet and Teddy, known as the Curlytops, loved playing imaginative games. Janet suggested pretending to be soldiers, using red cloth to make a cross. Teddy enjoyed playing as long as he had chocolate pills. Suddenly, their play was interrupted when someone entered the room. Teddy then proposed playing horse, mimicking bucking broncos. They set up a chair corral and had a blast. However, Trouble, their little brother, accidentally tumbled down the stairs. Mrs. Martin rushed to check on him, prompting the kids to reflect on their adventures at Cherry Farm and Star Island. The Curlytops had many exciting experiences, from cherries to a mysterious blue light, and even being snowed in during a big storm.

Teddy Martin and his siblings were getting ready for a summer adventure out West at Uncle Frank's ranch in Montana.

Mr. Martin told Mrs. Newton that the goat and the little boy were missing. They suspected Baby William took the goat. They thought Trouble might have gone towards the stable.

Bob, Teddy, and Mrs. Newton went up the street, while Janet and her father went down. They asked in many houses but found no clue. Bob suggested checking the back street where it's quieter. They searched the vacant lots. Teddy realized Trouble might have wanted to take Nicknack to Uncle Frank's ranch in Montana.

The children were delighted by the candy and books sold by the boy who passed through the train. They eagerly waited for him to sell something, enjoying the colorful books he offered.

"The train engine puffed and whistled as the Curlytops watched trainmen with torches working to get it back on the rails. They used iron wedges like ""jumpers"" to accomplish this. Soon, the engine was back on track, allowing the children to fall asleep again. Some adults, however, stayed awake, fearing another collision. Fortunately, none occurred, and despite the delay, the incident wasn't serious. During the journey, the Curlytops ate, drank water, and Uncle Frank pointed out the Circle O brand on his ranch animals. As they arrived at a small station surrounded by fields, the children observed the water tank and a building with a chugging pump nearby. Uncle Frank teased them about naming his ranch ""Ring Rosy Ranch,"" which made the Curlytops curious about their surroundings after a long week of train travel."|['1.

Uncle Frank pointed to the hills in the distance and explained to the Curlytops why their ranch was located far from the railroad station to avoid scaring the horses and cattle. As they approached the ranch, they noticed a Redman named Running Horse, who often visited when hungry. Uncle Frank assured the children that the nearby Indian reservation was safe. The journey to Ring Rosy Ranch was filled with laughter as they reminisced about being snowed in. The ranch had rolling hills and various buildings, including stables and bunk houses. The aroma of cooking filled the air as they neared the ranch. Suddenly, a group of cowboys on ponies appeared, creating a festive atmosphere with loud cheers and popping sounds.|['1.

"The cowboys rode in, hollering and waving their big guns that popped like fireworks. Some wore leather ""pants,"" while others had trousers that looked like sheep's wool. They tipped their hats and even stood in the saddle like circus performers! Uncle Frank explained that the cowboys used loud noises to scare off thieves and spooked cattle. The ranch, much larger than Grandfather Martin's pastures, had few fences, so animals could wander off. Cattle sometimes stampeded, running in any direction when spooked by fires or thieves. The cowboys fired blanks to stop them. Uncle Frank teased Teddy about being a ""tenderfoot"" from the East who walked a lot.

Aunt Millie firmly declined the idea of having any Indians on the ranch, finding them dirty and not nice, despite some looking picturesque in red blankets with feathers. She then shifted the conversation to the Curlytops' trip. Aunt Millie praised the children's appetites, urging them to eat heartily to please the cook, Hop Sing.

Teddy suggested pulling grass for the horses, feeding them over the fence. The children soon tired as there were too many horses to feed. Janet noticed a big pony always pushing others for food. The Curlytops fed the horses, ensuring each got a share. Evening approached with a golden sky. Cowboys rode out to check on the animals.

Once a year, some Indians grow tired of staying on the reservation and run off. They may ride away on their horses or take some from nearby ranches. The children, Curlytops and Trouble, were promised to be taught how to ride by a cowboy. While exploring the ranch, they met an old cowboy who marveled at Janet's curly hair. The cowboy reassured the children about the Indians and encouraged them to enjoy their time on the ranch. Later, the cowboy entertained the children by riding a lively pony and letting Teddy have a ride.

Teddy and Janet spent the morning playing around the ranch. They built a sea-saw from a board and a barrel and played games learned from Cherry Farm and Grandpa Martin's camping trips. At dinner time, Uncle Frank and the cowboys didn't return. Enjoying the pleasant day, the siblings wandered farther than planned. The rolling land led them out of sight of the ranch buildings, but they knew they could find their way back by going to a high part of the prairie. As they walked, they stumbled upon a pile of rocks that seemed like a cave. Curious, they heard a strange noise from the rocks. Despite Janet's hesitance, Teddy wanted to investigate. They noticed a man on a horse in the distance but couldn't be heard due to the wind. Teddy's newfound courage from camping led him to want to explore the source of the noise, leaving Janet torn between staying and following.|"['1.

Teddy explained that if the horse was groaning due to sickness, it wouldn't kick hard. He mentioned Uncle Frank's advice to stay clear of a strange horse's feet until it gets familiar with you. Teddy headed towards the dark area among the rocks where he heard sounds of a horse or pony. Despite the scarcity of water on the prairies, the Curlytops were fortunate to find a hidden spring at Ring Rosy Ranch. Following the sound of dripping water, they discovered a rocky basin where the spring bubbled up. They quenched their thirst and filled their hats with water. Teddy excitedly shared his plans to ride the pony, which he named Clipclap, and learn from the cowboys. Janet, no longer afraid, knelt in front of the pony with water in her hat, which the pony eagerly drank. Teddy shared that Doctor Bond lived in the white house nearby and would come if they ever needed a doctor.|"[""1.

Teddy and Janet took turns sharing their adventures from Cresco out West, including their visit to Cherry Farm and camping with Grandpa Martin. They even mentioned finding a cave on Circle O Ranch, renamed Ring Rosy by the doctor. Though they clarified that Uncle Frank was their father's uncle, they felt a strong bond with him. Doctor Bond, not a vet, agreed to help the Curlytops' sick pony. They all headed to the cave, where Jim Mason suspected the pony had ingested poisoned meat. The doctor administered medicine to help the pony recover, advising them to leave him in the cave until he improved. Uncle Frank, Daddy Martin, and the Curlytops were relieved to hear the pony would soon be back on his feet.|"['1.

"""Oh, no!"" exclaimed the foreman. ""But I'll send one of the men over with some straw to make him a soft bed, and we'll see that he has water to drink. He won't want anything to eat until he gets better. The doctor will come to see him tomorrow. Won't you?"" he went on to Doctor Bond.

""No, it isn't one of my brand,"" said the owner of Ring Rosy Ranch. ""It's a strange pony that must have wandered into this cave after he found he was poisoned. I reckon the poor thing thought he'd die in there, and maybe he would if the children hadn't found him.""

""Yes, I guess he can,"" answered Uncle Frank. ""If nobody comes to claim him you children may have him. And if anyone does come after him I'll give you another. I was going to give you each a pony, anyhow, as soon as you got used to the ranch, and I'll do it. If Ted wants to keep Clipclap, as he calls him, I'll give Janet another.""

There was nothing more that could be done just then for the sick pony, so the Curlytops and the others left him in the cave. The children were glad he did not groan anymore.

"""Why don't you try something else besides a post?"" asked one of Uncle Frank's men, as he noticed Teddy. ""Throwing a rope over a post is a good start, but to be a real cowboy, you need to lasso something moving on four legs. Most lassoing is about roping ponies or steers, which don't stand still like a post,"" he explained.

Teddy, eager to practice, convinced his sister Jan to play along. He wanted to lasso a moving target like a cowboy. They went to a field, and Teddy, carrying his lasso, pretended to be a cowboy while Jan played the wild pony. Teddy practiced throwing the rope, being careful not to hurt Jan.

Baby William enjoyed his time on the ranch while his mother cared for him. This left Janet and Teddy free to ride and play. Trouble, however, found his own mischief. He watched Teddy lassoing and decided to try it himself. Trouble ended up lassoing a rooster, causing it to struggle and crow in distress. Aunt Millie had to intervene to rescue the rooster, scolding Trouble for his actions. Despite the chaos, the rooster was unharmed.

No one claimed Clipclap, the sick pony found on the ranch. Uncle Frank asked other ranchmen, but none recognized the pony. Teddy and Janet, learning to ride, sat up straight in the saddle and guided their ponies with the reins. The cowboys couldn't recover the stolen horses or find the thieves. The children enjoyed watching the cowboys work and play. They sometimes rode with Uncle Frank and Jim Mason on their ponies, Star Pace and Clipclap. Teddy often won races as Janet was tender-hearted. Uncle Frank's cattle provided security against losses. The cowboys' return without finding the thieves didn't worry the family. The cowboys' playful antics included riding bucking broncos, which Uncle Frank explained as wild horses. Jim Mason prepared to ride the toughest bronco after others failed.|['1.

The wild bronco was led to a corner of the corral and tied up. The foreman aimed to outlast his men in the saddle, as riding a bucking bronco is like holding onto a spinning swing. The cowboys hesitated, fearing for Trouble's safety. They knew how to warn a friend near a dangerous horse, but Trouble, being carefree around all horses, didn't grasp the danger. The foreman cautioned against calling out to Trouble, as it could startle the bronco. Baby William, eager to ride a horse like his siblings, wandered towards the bronco.

In this situation, Imp, the bronco, was about to kick Trouble, but Jim Mason, the foreman, sprang into action to save the little boy. Jim quickly leaped over the fence, grabbed Trouble, and moved him out of harm's way. He scolded Trouble for going near the horses, emphasizing the danger. As Imp tried to buck Jim off, the foreman expertly stayed on. Eventually, Imp calmed down and trotted as he should.

As the riders approached the children on their slower ponies, it became clear that they were friendly Indians wrapped in blankets. The group included men, women, boys, and girls, with some younger children carried on their mothers' backs. Initially, there was some excitement on the ranch, but it turned out that these were peaceful Indians who made and sold baskets. The Curlytops, Teddy and Janet, often rode their ponies, Clipclap and Star Face, exploring the prairies under the watchful eye of adults. However, trouble arose when a cowboy reported that some cattle were being driven away by a group of Indians. Uncle Frank decided they needed to retrieve the cattle and return the Indians to their reservation. Teddy attempted a daring leap over Clipclap but tumbled as his pony stumbled near a gopher hole, highlighting the dangers of the prairie landscape.|"['1.

Janet and Teddy sat next to the gopher hole, their ponies grazing nearby on the prairie grass. Clipclap and Star Face stayed close, showing their training as Western horses. These ponies were taught to stay put when their riders left them, simply tossing the reins over their heads. A pony, like Clipclap, understands this as a sign to stay put. Despite several attempts, Teddy couldn't catch the gopher peeking out of the hole. Janet called the ponies over, and they obediently approached. Teddy assisted Janet in mounting her pony, a skill they had learned from Jim Mason. Aunt Millie reassured them about Uncle Frank and the cowboys camping on the prairies. The party returned the next day after a long ride, mentioning the disappearance of some animals that might have been taken by Indians. Uncle Frank expressed concerns about the mischievous Indians. Teddy and Janet tried making a bow, but the wrong sticks made it challenging. The wood needed for a bow should be springy to shoot arrows effectively.|"['1.

Teddy and Janet were enjoying their time at Uncle Frank's ranch, a different experience from playing at home. They realized that finding playmates was not as easy here as there were no streets nearby. Janet suggested pretending to sleep on the prairie, imagining it was night even though the sun was shining. They then pretended their cookies were cowboy food like bacon and cake. As days passed, Uncle Frank and the cowboys searched for stolen cattle and horses, while Teddy and Janet improved their riding skills. One day, they watched cowboys herding ponies back to the corral. Some ponies were wild, causing a commotion. Trouble accidentally opened the gate, letting the horses out, leading to a chase to round them up again.|"['1.

Mother Martin scolded Trouble for letting the ponies out, causing extra work for Uncle Frank and the cowboys. She decided to punish Trouble by not letting him play for an hour. Meanwhile, the cowboys rounded up the runaway ponies with skill, coaxing them back into the corral. Uncle Frank locked the gate securely to prevent any further mishaps. Despite the lesson learned, Trouble soon cheered up and enjoyed sitting on the saddle with Uncle Frank. Later, news of Indians passing through the prairie sparked an adventure.

The small animals were thirsty after resting, so Clipclap and Star Face drank cool water from the spring among the rocks. A tin cup left by a cowboy made it easy to drink without kneeling. Horses and cattle had a rocky basin for water. The Curlytops realized they were far behind their father and the cowboys. They heard a whistling sound and found a gopher-like animal making the noise. They saw many more animals as they rode over the prairies. The sun started to set, casting long shadows. Riding over hills and hollows, they couldn't find the rocks.

"Ted exclaimed, ""Pooh! No!"" speaking loudly to mask his fear. Boys whistle loudly in the dark to feel brave, and if there are two boys, they both whistle. What girls do in the dark alone is a mystery. Maybe they sing. Ted, unsure of the way, led his tired pony with Janet's Star Face following. Janet, riding behind, peered through the darkness for the rocks, a sign of home. Ted, trying to find the rocks, unknowingly led them farther away. Teddy grinned in the dark, relieved Janet wasn't crying. The tired Curlytops dismounted, letting the ponies graze. Teddy noticed Clipclap wandering too far and ran after him. In the moonlight, he saw something round and black on the ground."|['1. What did Ted do to mask his fear in the dark?\nA) Sing\nB) Whistle\nC) Cry\nD) Run\nE) None of the above', '2.

Janet and her brother, Teddy, found a mysterious bundle in the prairie while out riding their ponies. With curiosity and bravery, they approached the object wrapped in a cowboy's blanket. As they unwrapped it, they discovered food and a canteen of water. The siblings, feeling relieved, enjoyed a meal and a drink, then continued their journey. Following a stream, they stumbled upon a hidden valley, sheltered by hills and enclosed by a wooden fence. Although unsure of their location in the dark, they decided to rest for the night. The children were grateful for the unexpected provisions and the shelter of the valley as they settled down, tired but safe, under the moonlit sky.|"[""1.

The children, Ted and Janet, had ventured into a hidden valley on their ponies, Clipclap and Star Face. As they explored, night fell, and they decided to camp out under the stars. Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Mrs. Martin and Aunt Millie grew worried when the children didn't return by late afternoon. The cowboys, including Baldy, set out to search for the missing kids. Baldy suspected the children might have headed towards Silver Creek for water. As the sun rose, the search continued, with the cowboys spreading out like a fan across the prairie. Eventually, they found the children safe and sound, asleep with blankets and food. Baldy's hunch about the water source proved correct, and the Curlytops were reunited with their relieved family.|"['1.
