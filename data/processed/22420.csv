In the forest lives a kind spirit who cares for all the animals. One day, he saw some white hares fighting over food. The spirit decided to teach them a lesson.

Long ago, the raven had white feathers, but he was disliked by other birds for being a thief. Despite their efforts to hide their belongings, the raven always found them and took them to his nest in a pine tree. One day, a yellow bird flew away, and a wood-worm brought twigs, moss, and birch-bark to set a fire around the tree.

The first person refused to let go of the frog, but the frog managed to break free and jump into the water, leaving its tail behind. However, the firebrand it carried stayed safe.

At sunrise, the quail found her son missing from the owl's nest. When the light revealed him, his bill and legs had grown so long that he no longer resembled her son.

The Father sadly decided to punish the lazy peetweet by forbidding it from drinking water from rivers or lakes. Instead, it must find rainwater in rock hollows when thirsty.

Once upon a time, a king transformed a hornet into a cheerful oriole, admired by all. Meanwhile, Queen Juno had a beautiful cow that the king desired. To outwit Juno, the king sent Mercury to charm Argus, the watchman with a hundred eyes, watching over the cow. Mercury's storytelling and music captivated Argus, causing his eyes to close one by one until he fell asleep. Juno, upon discovering this, was furious and transferred Argus's eyes to the tail of her peacock. The tale also tells of two tribes, one diligent in preparing for winter, and the other carefree and playful.

Long ago, a man faced a daunting task set by the king. The king demanded the man to find a lost pearl, or face dire consequences. Just then, two men named Sharp and Dire appeared, offering the pearl to the man. They revealed their true identities and gave him the pearl. The people mistook the man for a god and threw him into the sky, where he transformed into ants due to their keen sense of smell. In another tale, the Indians sought a gentler light from the sun, which then shifted to the moon. When faced with danger, they called upon the manito for help, and miraculously the threat vanished.

In a distant land, a chief's two sons were dearly loved. During a war, enemies took the younger son far away. The chief passed away, declaring no new leader until his lost son returned. Moneta, his wife, ruled wisely while waiting for their return. The older son set out but didn't return. Moneta lit a fire every night on the mountain, hoping to guide them home. One stormy night, a voice promised their return. When the tribe searched, Moneta and her sons were gone, leaving behind diamonds where her tears fell.

In ancient times, the king of India desired the most beautiful thing from earth, air, or water. His quest led him to seek the elusive emerald vase hidden deep below the sea. Consulting his wise men, they suggested various locations, but the king, a powerful magician, believed the vase lay in the sea's depths. Using his magic, he summoned the king of the underwater world who relinquished the vase to the spirits of the air. A fierce battle ensued between the spirits of the air and water, causing a tumultuous storm. Ultimately, the emerald vase shattered into countless pieces upon a mountain peak, a casualty of the otherworldly conflict.|"['1.

Once upon a time, in the land of trees and plants, a willow-tree and an aspen-tree got into a quarrel with the chatty reeds. The willow-tree complained about the reeds' constant whispering, calling them unkind chatterboxes. The aspen-tree, in its anger, insulted the reeds and the queen bee, claiming their honey was not worth having. The bees, offended by the aspen-tree's words, swarmed and stung it, driving it away from the forest. The aspen-tree fled in fear, never to return, its leaves forever trembling from the memory of the bees' stings. Meanwhile, the other plants and trees lived happily, each choosing a home where they felt most content.

"Once upon a time, in the forest, three cranberries found themselves in danger.

The eagle and the raven had a discussion about humans. The eagle thought humans were lazy because they didn't have to fly for their food. The raven disagreed, pointing out that humans couldn't fly like birds and needed help. The eagle's daughter showed the raven some strange objects in her father's lodge. The raven realized they were valuable gifts for humans, like the sun, moon, stars, and fire. He decided to share these gifts with humans, making them wiser.

In the past, the sky was close to the earth, so there was no sunshine. Trees didn't grow, flowers didn't blossom, and water wasn't clear. The earth was unaware of any other way of life and didn't complain. Then, the sky and the earth had a son named the Shining One. He dreamt of a sky far above them with a bright light that made the earth radiant. When the sky was lifted high above, the earth changed beautifully. The Shining One explained to the earth how the changes made everything more lovely.

The earth thought of sending a message through the clouds, creating the morning mist as a greeting to the sky. In a land where summer never arrived, a boy lived without knowing the warmth of the sun or the songs of birds. His father, a fisher, taught him to hunt, but the bitter cold made it challenging. One day, a squirrel named Adjidaumo dropped ice on the boy's nose, sparking a conversation. The squirrel shared that ideas could warm the heart more than a fire ever could. Despite the boy's cold and yearning for warmth, he learned that carrying an idea could provide comfort wherever he went.|"['1.

"Adjidaumo was rarely cold, but when he saw the boy shivering, he felt sorry for him. He advised the boy to go home and cry, telling his father to bring summer when asked why he was crying. The boy, though not one to cry often, followed the squirrel's advice due to his freezing hands and feet. Upon reaching home, he wept so much that his tears formed a frozen river. The fisher, his father, questioned him, but all the boy could say was, ""Boo-hoo, boo-hoo, get me summer!"" The fisher then hosted a feast for animals that might help find summer.

The wise Great Spirit decided to split the seasons between the heavens and the earth, granting summer to both. He transformed a fisher into a fish to reside in the skies but sealed the earth's entrance. An elderly man, basking in his home's shadows, pondered his mighty feats, boasting of his unmatched accomplishments. Suddenly, noises outside disrupted his self-praise. A curious young man questioned him, sparking a friendly challenge to share the grandest tale. The elder boasted of his power to make leaves fall with fear, while the youth claimed to bring forth greenery and joy. They conversed until dawn, with the elder tiring and the youth growing livelier. As daylight broke, the youth bid farewell and was greeted by singing birds, celebrating the arrival of spring. The old man vanished, leaving behind snowdrops, the first blooms of the season.|"['1.

The chief refused to let the wind marry his daughter, as the wind was seen as weak and incapable. The wind, invisible and hurt by the chief's actions, took the maiden to a new home in the north. The chief found them and struck the wind with his war-club, causing the wind to forget how to be visible. In a tragic turn, the wind accidentally capsized the canoe with the chief and his daughter in it. The daughter fell into the water and lost her life. The Great Spirit, feeling sorry for her, placed her in the moon. The wind, unaware of this, continues to roam the earth, while the daughter looks down from the moon, unaware that her husband is invisible.

Long ago, the sun, wind, and moon were invited to a feast by the star mother. The sun and wind were selfish, bringing only what they wanted. The moon, however, brought gifts from nature's creatures. The star mother praised her and punished the sun and wind. She decreed that people would turn their backs on the sun in summer and shut doors against the wind during storms. The moon was rewarded for her kindness and promised to always be loved. In another tale, a hare, monkey, and fox agreed to live together and help each other without harming any living creature. When tested by the manito in the forest, they offered him their meager food and showed kindness to strangers.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a manito was welcomed by various animals in the forest, including a monkey and a fox who brought him food. When he expressed his hunger again, a kind hare offered himself as a gift. Touched by the hare's selflessness, the manito decided to carry the hare to the moon to share his story with everyone. Meanwhile, on a hill, two children named Jack and Jill lived a simple life. Every morning, they were tasked with fetching water by the old man of the hill. One night, when they weren't called, they ventured out under the moonlight, feeling comforted by its presence.
