Lord Montague revealed his allegiance to King Henry, prompting most soldiers to follow suit. Edward, realizing he couldn't resist Warwick's approaching force, fled to Holland with a few loyal companions. Warwick liberated King Henry from the Tower of London and restored him as king. Dame Tresham arrived in London with her son, as the queen awaited French reinforcements. Sir Thomas Tresham settled in Kent, while the Duke of Clarence joined Warwick. An act passed by Parliament secured the crown for Prince Edward and the Duke of Clarence. Edward returned with Burgundy's fleet, gaining supporters as he marched south.

On the misty morning of April 14th, a historic battle unfolded. Warwick and Edward faced off, each with their armies strategically positioned. Edward, seeking a close combat battle due to his inferior artillery, made the first move. As the mist shrouded the field, the clash began. Despite initial confusion, Edward's forces gained ground, breaking through Somerset's lines. Meanwhile, Warwick's troops fought valiantly, but confusion set in when Oxford's forces were mistaken for the enemy. Suspicions of treachery arose, leading to chaos. By mid-morning, Warwick's army was in retreat, marking a turning point in the conflict. The battle was fierce, with significant casualties on both sides, including the loss of noble leaders. The day was filled with uncertainty and anxiety, as those in St. Albans awaited news of the outcome.|"[""1.

The lady at the house was summoned and quickly instructed her son to prepare the other horse for the knight. Dame Tresham readied the saddlebags while her husband ate a quick meal. Within minutes of his arrival, they departed, with Gervaise riding behind his father and Dame Tresham riding her horse led by her husband. A dense mist covered the land. The knight mentioned how the mist had caused confusion during the battle but had also helped many escape. He recounted a fortunate encounter with a local who guided him to his horse after the battle. The knight expressed his views on the Earl's ambition and the nobles' impact on England. He discussed the fierce fighting near Warwick's standard and the king's personal vendetta against Warwick. Despite setbacks, he remained hopeful for future battles. Sir Thomas Tresham rode swiftly, crossing the Thames at Reading and reaching Westbury, where he learned of the queen's arrival at Plymouth. With the majority in Wiltshire and Somerset favoring the Lancastrians, he continued his journey to Exeter without fear of York partisans.|"['1.

"""I thank you greatly, old friend,"" Sir Thomas said. ""It has taken a load off my mind. I shall leave him here with his mother when we march forward, and bid her, if ill befalls me, cross again to France, and then to keep Gervaise with her until she can bring herself to part with him. She has her jewels and a considerable sum of money which I accepted from the man who has been enjoying my estates for the last five years, in lieu of the monies that he had received during that time. Therefore, she will not lack means for some years to come. Besides, Queen Margaret has a real affection for her, and will, doubtless, be glad to have her with her again in exile.""

""When I am old enough,"" Gervaise said, suddenly looking up from a missal of the Grand Prior's which he had been examining, ""I will chop off the head of the Duke of York, and bring mother back to England.""

""You will be a valiant champion no doubt, my boy,"" the prior said, laughing. ""But that is just what your father does not want. Chop off the heads of as many infidels as you will, but leave Englishmen alone, be they dukes or commoners. It is a far more glorious career to be aiding to defend Europe against the Moslem than to be engaged in wars with your own countrymen. If the great lords will fight, let them fight it"|"['1.

The knight thoughtfully agreed that men unsuited for a monastic life shouldn't be bound to it after their usefulness to the Order ends. He believed that some, after years of warfare, would be content with such a life, but others would find it unbearable after a life of action. The knight expressed hope in the aid promised from different quarters and believed that if Edward delayed, they would have an overwhelming force. Edward, an able leader, needed to strike soon to succeed. The queen's army, exhausted after a long march, reached a river. Some wanted to cross it, but others believed they should halt and fight in their current strong position. Edward's troops camped nearby, and the Lancastrians felt confident in their numbers and position. Sir Thomas Tresham had left his family in Exeter.|"['1.

Among them were the Duke of Somerset, the Grand Prior of the Order of St. John, Sir Humphrey Audely, Sir Gervis of Clifton, Sir William Gainsby, Sir William Cary, Sir Henry Rose, Sir Thomas Tresham, and seven esquires. Margaret of Anjou fell into the hands of the victors. As to the fate of the young prince, accounts differ. Some authorities say that he was overtaken and slain on the field, but the majority related that he was captured and taken before Edward, who asked him, “What brought you to England?” On his replying boldly, “My father's crown and mine own inheritance,” Edward struck him in the mouth with his gauntlet, and his attendants, or some say his brothers, at once despatched the youth with their swords. The king, with Gloucester and Clarence, then went to the church at Tewkesbury, where the knights had taken refuge, burst open the doors, and entered it. A priest, bearing the holy vessels, threw himself before the king, and would not move until he promised to pardon all who had taken sanctuary there. The king then retired, and trusting in the royal word, the gentlemen made no attempt to escape, although it is said that they could easily have done so. Two days later a party of soldiers by the king's orders broke into the church, dragged them from the foot of the altar, and beheaded them outside|"[""1.

At the moment, it is uncertain if Mahomet's significant military preparations are aimed at capturing Negropont, a Venetian territory, or Rhodes. Unfortunately, Venice and Rhodes do not have a strong relationship. During a conflict with Egypt in '58, Egyptian merchants aboard Venetian ships were captured by opposing forces. The Venetians claimed the ships as theirs, protesting interference with their enemies. This led to a tense encounter where the Venetians attacked and pillaged Halki. Subsequently, a larger Venetian fleet demanded the return of the Egyptians and their goods, creating a division among Rhodes' council. To avoid conflict amidst threats from the Turks and Venetians, the grand master opted to comply. As Gervaise and his group neared Rhodes, they marveled at its grand structures and fortifications. Upon arrival, they were struck by the sight of numerous slaves toiling under harsh conditions. The group proceeded to the English langue's house, one of the eight national divisions within the Order of St. John, where they were received by familiar faces eager to exchange news.|"[""1.

During the early days of the Order, when Jerusalem was under Christian control, the main focus was on managing hospitals and hosting pilgrims at a large guest house. However, after the Christians were expelled from Palestine and lost Jerusalem, the Order's role shifted. They no longer rode into battle on horses but became sailors, defending against foes at sea. The knights resided in houses based on their groups, eating together and receiving supplies from a bailiff. Each group had around a hundred to a hundred and fifty knights. Sir Guy and Gervaise visited the house of the Auvergne group, where D'Aubusson belonged. D'Aubusson welcomed Sir Guy back and mentioned the need for clear-headed men. Gervaise expressed his gratitude for being appointed as a page to the grand master.|"['1.

De Lille chuckled, “You look as if you had, anyhow. It was the best thing you could do. We have brought up supper. We generally sit down and eat after the knights have done, but this is much better, as you are here.” They sat on the beds, carved the pasty with their daggers, and after they finished, Gervaise happily agreed to take a walk around the walls. “No. Still, it forms a useful place of refuge. In case a great fleet came to attack us, our galleys would lay up in the inner port, which would be cleared of all the merchant craft, as these would hamper the defence; they would, therefore, be sent round into the outer port, where they would be safe from any attack by sea, although they would doubtless be burnt did an army besiege the town.” Passing along the walls of the grand master's palace, which was a strongly fortified building, and formed a citadel that could be defended after the lower town and the rest of the castle had been taken, they came to the western angle of the fortifications. “You must know that each langue has charge of a separate part of the wall.

The official overseeing them sat at the head of the table, and the meal was consumed quietly. Once finished, they dispersed to their rooms, and discipline relaxed, allowing them to entertain themselves freely. Gervaise was spared much teasing due to his impressive display of strength and skill in the courtyard. He discovered that the pages' duties were light, with only two on duty daily, attending the grand master everywhere. During public dinners, four attended the grand master, with one serving as a taster. Six pages lit the staircase with torches if the grand master returned after dark. All pages were present at state ceremonies and religious festivals. Gervaise settled into life at the palace, where boys of noble families exemplified Order importance and courtesy.

The bailiff's role at Rhodes granted a prestigious position and paved the way for lucrative offices within their langues. The bailiffs had the privilege of claiming grand priories or bailiwicks at home, and many grand masters were chosen from their ranks due to their popularity among electors. The provincial bailiwicks offered substantial emoluments, and bailiffs often preferred retiring to these roles after their time in Rhodes. Gervaise, known for his love of physical activities, excelled in military exercises during his pageship. The bailiff of Auvergne recognized Gervaise's potential and provided him with armor and weapons upon completing his pageship. Gervaise then took his vows as a professed knight, with the bailiff of the English langue as his sponsor. His induction ceremony was attended by knights from various langues. As Sir Gervaise Tresham, he returned to the English auberge, where he quickly felt at home.

For six months, Gervaise took on various tasks in the town. He spent some time working in the infirmary, then moved to the galleys briefly, but mostly worked with slaves on fortifications. The bailiff then informed him that he was selected as one of the six knights to join a galley about to set sail. Sir Ralph Harcourt, his companion from England, was also on board. The young knight expressed hope for a successful voyage against foes. The group was to be led by Sir Louis Ricord. The bailiff discussed the necessity of using captive labor for fortifications due to threats from the Turks.

The following day, Gervaise and his group set sail aboard the galley, a vessel rowed by fifty slaves. The knights resided in the upper cabins, with a portion eating and sleeping there while the rest stayed in the lower deck. The galley cruised between mainland and island territories, some held by Turks and others by Greeks. Despite occasional conflicts, the islands maintained a neutral stance to preserve trade. The Mediterranean was plagued by pirates, prompting the Order of St. John to police the seas. Gervaise expressed a wish for sails instead of rowing slaves, noting that many ships used both methods for speed and efficiency. During their cruise, they received reports of pirate attacks led by a corsair named Hassan Ali. Gervaise and Harcourt spotted smoke on an island, hinting at trouble.|['1.

"""I agree with you, Gervaise. Let's quickly head down with the news. It might be a village attacked by pirates who landed on the island's other side overnight, as I don't see any ships in the bay."" The slaves rowed swiftly, reaching the galley near the shore. Observing the knights running down the hill, the galley crew assumed they had spotted a pirate ship. The knights were informed of smoke rising from an island southwest, suggesting a pirate attack on a village. The galley sped towards the distant island with smoke rising, indicating a village in flames. To avoid being seen by pirates, they decided to take a longer route behind islets before approaching the island from the south. Orders were given to the slaves to row cautiously near the islands.

As the galley approached the pirate ships, a fierce battle ensued. The knights of the Hospital, protected by their armor and shields, fought valiantly against the Moslem crew. The clash of swords and the war cry of the Order filled the air. Despite being outnumbered, the knights pushed forward like a wall of steel, driving the Moslems back. The combat raged on until a shout alerted them to the arrival of more enemy ships. Sir Louis swiftly organized the knights, assigning tasks to each group. The English and Spanish knights continued to fend off the attackers, while the knights of Germany and Provence held back the boarders. The knights of Auvergne followed Sir Louis as he led them into battle against the enemy.

The knights valiantly fought against the Moslems on the ship's deck. Despite their inability to guard the entire bulwark, their disciplined retreat allowed them to regroup and form a strong defensive semicircle. Sir Louis Ricord and his knights from Auvergne and Spain joined the battle, turning the tide against the pirates. The knights, reinforced and resilient, fought off the attackers who eventually retreated to their ships. The knights pursued, driving the pirates to abandon ship in panic. The knights secured a hard-earned victory, capturing four pirate vessels. Although seven knights fell in battle, the remaining knights tended to the wounded, showing the chivalrous training of the Knights of St. John. After the fight, they attended to the wounded, cleared the deck, and learned valuable information about the defeated pirate fleet.

The leader explained that their group was not strong enough to directly confront the pirates. Instead, they decided on a plan to send a boat with ten galley slaves, accompanied by two brave knights, to fetch two more galleys for support. The goal was to clear the island of pirates and secure the captured ships. The journey was estimated to take about eight hours of rowing. The commander praised the bravery of the young knight, Sir Gervaise Tresham, who fought valiantly in the recent conflict. The group discovered over 150 women and children who were rescued captives from a nearby village. Sir John Boswell, along with the two knights, embarked on the mission with the rowing boat and galley slaves, armed with a plan to outmaneuver the pursuing pirates and reach safety.|"[""1.

After an hour of rowing, the boat behind hadn't gained much ground. The rowers were exhausted, breathing heavily, and struggling to maintain speed. Three miles ahead loomed an islet, half covered in foliage. Sir John urged the rowers to pause for a moment to catch their breath. He proposed landing on the islet, giving the slaves the choice to stay hidden or remain in the boat. Knowing a battle was imminent, Sir John suggested shedding armor to move faster. As they neared the islet, the plan was to distract the pursuers while the slaves hid in the woods. Amidst the chaos, the knights and slaves scrambled up the hill, hearing the approaching pirates. The knights devised a daring escape plan to reclaim their boat and outmaneuver the pirates.|"['1.

Sir John, with a sense of urgency, ordered his companions to push down loose rocks to slow down their pursuers. The knights swiftly followed suit, sending rocks tumbling down the steep slope. The noise echoed through the valley as they quickly made their escape. Sir John, satisfied with the delay caused, urged them to move on. They crossed a rocky terrain and reached the edge of a valley filled with trees, leading to the central hill of the island. As they descended into the valley, the knights heard the shouts of their enemies growing closer. They dashed through the woods, reaching the sea shore. In a strategic move, they discarded their heavy armor and swam around a rocky point to evade the pirates. Reuniting with their hidden boat, they prepared for the next phase of their escape.|"['1.

The knight and Gervaise tried to break the boat's bottom with an oar but failed. Realizing they were outnumbered by pirates, they set the sails on fire. The pirates panicked, and the knight and his companions escaped in a boat rowed by galley slaves. The pirates tried to put out the fire but failed. The knight praised Gervaise for his quick thinking in saving them twice, first with the boat and then by burning the sails. The knight acknowledged Gervaise's bravery and intelligence, foreseeing him becoming a distinguished knight. Gervaise humbly accepted the praise, attributing his actions to common sense rather than extraordinary skill.

“Men, row steadily,” commanded Sir John to the slaves. “We have gained time from your swift rowing. We will reach the island before sunset. Harcourt, pass me the wineskin and goblet for a drink.” As the boat neared, the Spanish knight inquired anxiously about Ricord's galley. Sir John replied, “All is well, but we need your help. Pirate vessels have caused casualties. We need to assist Ricord swiftly.” The knights on board listened intently as Sir John recounted the battle's details. Don Santoval praised the victory and agreed to depart at daybreak to aid Ricord. The situation was grave as some pirates might have fled to Hassan Ali's rendezvous. The urgency was clear, and preparations began for a swift response.|"['1.

Sir John promised the men their freedom, even willing to pay for it if necessary. They rowed hard to escape pursuers and proved loyal. Sir John credited Sir Gervaise Tresham for saving his life. They planned to destroy the pirates' craft on an island. Meanwhile, another galley approached, and they decided to meet in the morning. Gervaise and Harcourt shared their adventures, including capturing pirate vessels. The Italian commander hoped to capture more pirates for slave labor.

At three in the morning, everyone on the ship was awake. The slaves were given bread and meat to eat before the boat set off. The rowers from the English knight's boat were praised and given special treatment. The knights were pleased to see the slaves rowing hard to please them. Most knights slept until daybreak, with a few on watch. The knights were excited about reaching their friends quickly. They passed the island where they had landed before. The knights spotted the landing place and hoped to catch the pirates. Suddenly, the sound of gunshots was heard, signaling a battle. The galley sped up as the slaves rowed faster. The knights were eager to join the fight, making promises to St. John. They arrived at the bay to find a fierce battle between the pirates and Santoval's galley. The knights swiftly boarded the pirate ships, surprising and defeating them.|"['1.

The knights quickly returned to their own ship and began chasing the pirates. Don Santoval joined but had to give up due to damaged oars. The pirates, aided by the wind, started to pull away. Piccolomini saw the futility of the pursuit and returned to the island. They were relieved to see Santoval's return as they were vulnerable with only twenty able fighters. The knights landed, and after confirming the absence of pirates, prepared for a possible attack. Soon, lookout men spotted five pirate ships approaching. They all gathered on Santoval's galley to unite their defense. The pirates engaged in a fierce battle, but with unexpected reinforcement, they managed to repel the attackers.

At three o'clock, the group decided to set sail early to avoid an attack. With only a few knights left and valuable prizes in hand, it was a wise choice. The leaders discussed the fallen comrades and the heavy cost of victory. They divided the knights and galley slaves among the captured ships to confront the imprisoned pirates. After a short search, the pirates surrendered due to lack of food and water on the island. The knights disarmed them and readied them for work. The knights set sail for Rhodes with the pirates in tow, ensuring a safe journey. Sir John Boswell, wounded but still in command, led the fleet. The wounded were cared for aboard the galleys. The knights were relieved that the surrender went smoothly and that the pirates were now under their control.|"[""1.

The small fleet anchored at the meeting point that evening and, after two more days of rowing, finally arrived at Rhodes. The sight of the three galleys and their captured prizes was met with cheers. However, the news of the fallen knights dampened the initial joy. D'Aubusson, upon receiving the report, expressed regret over the loss but acknowledged the importance of the victory. He highlighted the significance of the captured ships in deterring the enemy's advances. The encounter also revealed the need for the Order to avoid sailing alone near the islands due to the pirates' strength. The timely assistance from other knights, including young and valiant fighters like Harcourt and Tresham, was crucial in securing victory. D'Aubusson then decided to honor the two young knights with secular knighthood, recognizing their bravery and resourcefulness in battle.|"['1.

The grand prior knighted Sir Ralph Harcourt and Sir Gervaise Tresham, recognizing their valor and worthiness. The two young knights were congratulated by their comrades and sponsors. The prizes captured from the pirates were valuable, filled with Eastern goods. D'Aubusson freed the slaves who rowed his boat, rewarding them with money and sending them to the mainland. The English knights were proud, except for Robert Rivers, who was jealous. Rivers had been reprimanded for his behavior towards the servants and was punished with fasting and confinement.

Robert Rivers was greatly subdued by the reproof he received. He refrained from showing his jealousy of Gervaise to the other knights as he knew it could lead to serious consequences. The next day, talking to Ralph Harcourt, he expressed his belief that Gervaise received undeserved praise. Ralph disagreed, praising Gervaise for his quick thinking that saved their lives during a pirate attack. Ralph acknowledged Gervaise's skills and leadership qualities, emphasizing that age should not undermine talent. He questioned Rivers' contempt for Gervaise, highlighting Gervaise's positive traits and the respect he earned from everyone at the auberge.

When Rivers calmed down, he agreed with Harcourt's words. He did not favor the bailiff, but he held Harcourt and Tresham in high regard. Rivers knew that if he complained, it would lead to an investigation. Even if Harcourt got reprimanded, Rivers wouldn't gain favor with the knights. Gervaise mentioned how Rivers was unhappy that Harcourt and Tresham were knighted before him. Despite this, the knights were saddened to hear that the Grand Master Orsini was gravely ill. They believed that D'Aubusson should take over as he had the respect and trust of all. Orsini passed away, and D'Aubusson was elected as the new Grand Master. Gervaise realized the importance of learning Turkish and decided to start studying the language with the help of a servant.|"['1.

When Gervaise was captured as a young knight, he spent time in Egypt where he learned the Turkish language. His superior recognized the importance of this skill and allowed Gervaise to focus on learning it. With dedication and the help of a Turkish instructor, Gervaise quickly picked up the language. Despite teasing from other knights who joked about his passion for studying Turkish, Gervaise persevered. His interactions with the Turkish instructor, both during study sessions and walks, accelerated his learning. Gervaise's commitment to mastering the language paid off, as it would be a valuable asset within the Order.

After nine months of hard work, the young knight's studies were suddenly interrupted by a letter from the Pasha of Syria, offering a sum to ransom his instructor. The knights accepted the offer, as it was their practice to accept ransoms for prisoners. Suleiman Ali was to be sent to Acre on an Egyptian ship. The Turk, acknowledging the end of their teaching relationship, assured the knight he had learned enough. The grand master was impressed with the knight's progress and appointed him to accompany Suleiman Ali to receive the ransom.

A group of young knights decided to learn Turkish during the day, starting with a servant who spoke English well. Robert Rivers had left for England six months earlier to secure a position as a commander with the help of his influential friends. His departure pleased the others due to his arrogance. Gervaise was relieved as Rivers' jealousy and disrespectful behavior had tested his patience. They joked about how Rivers would have reacted to Gervaise's knighthood. Gervaise wished to settle their differences with a friendly fight, but their vows prevented it. Despite Rivers' insults, Gervaise only wanted a fair fistfight. The knights discussed the dangers of traveling on an Egyptian trader ship, warning about pirates but assuring safety from Turkish warships. Gervaise was advised on how to handle possible captures by pirates.|"[""1.

Gervaise and Suleiman Ali boarded the Egyptian ship for Acre, setting sail early in the morning. Concerned about pirates, Gervaise's friends bid him farewell with a mix of envy and worry. The dangers of the sea were discussed, with the Turk regretting the risk Gervaise faced as his escort. The Turk shared insights on the prevalence of piracy and advised Gervaise to steer clear of the coast, suggesting a southern route to avoid pirate-infested waters.

Suleiman Ali's advice was followed, extending the voyage's length. They encountered only one suspicious vessel, which emerged from the shore under the sand hills. Despite being three miles away with a north wind, the pirate ship couldn't catch up. The trader swiftly raised all sails, maintaining distance until nightfall. Under the cover of darkness, they evaded the pursuer by rowing north. Upon reaching Acre, the Egyptian captain presented the ransom and safe conduct to the governor. The governor, anticipating their arrival, had received the ransom from Suleiman's son. Grateful for the safe return, Suleiman expressed concern for the young knight's safety on the return journey.

"""Who can predict the future, Sir Giles?"" the bailiff, who had quietly joined the group, remarked. ""Not in our time - not until the threat of the Moslem power, which endangers not just us but all of Europe, is eradicated. As long as Acre remains under their control, there is little hope. While a united effort from Christendom could potentially reclaim Palestine from the infidels, history shows us that such fervor is often short-lived. Europe may stand by idly, indifferent to our struggles. Yet, for now, we are the shield against the Moslem advance. We must hold the line. But I foresee our defenses crumbling under overwhelming odds. Although we may repel attacks like at Acre, Rhodes will eventually fall if left to face the invasion alone. Our duty is to the present, to uphold our Order's banner over Rhodes for as long as we can, passing on the legacy to future generations, and entrusting the outcome to God."" 

All present listened respectfully to their leader's sobering words, accepting the reality that their fortress of Rhodes, while formidable, was but a distant outpost of Europe.

Ralph mentioned to Gervaise that he needed to write a letter to Suleiman Ali and have it sent to Acre. He preferred walking on the roofs due to the quiet and pleasant atmosphere compared to the busy and narrow streets. Gervaise agreed to accompany him but was not keen on making new acquaintances. As they strolled across the roofs, they encountered a gathering with people enjoying music and drinks. Gervaise was content observing the scene while Ralph socialized.

For the past nine months, Sir Gervaise secluded himself to study Turkish diligently. His dedication was so intense that even his close friend barely saw him, except during meals. Sir Gervaise avoided walking in the streets entirely. Despite being a conscientious young knight, his commitment to learning Turkish surpassed all else. Previously, he was seen as a younger brother, but now his wisdom commands respect. During a social gathering, the host, impressed by Sir Gervaise's achievements, seated him on his right.

As the dusk settled in, Gervaise observed a peculiar encounter on the streets of Rhodes. A group of slaves, overseen by guards and led by a knight, caught his attention. Among them, a man emerged from the shadows to converse with one of the slaves discreetly, exchanging something before disappearing down an alley. Intrigued, Gervaise discreetly followed the man, recognizing him as the Greek he had encountered before.

Sir John Kendall has devised a plan with Tresham to uncover a plot. Tresham will be in prison for ten days, and if he finds nothing, Sir John will bring him to the auberge under the guise of discussing ransom. Tresham will signal Sir John's servant Ahmet for communication. Later, Sir John and Gervaise, disguised as a slave, are taken to a galley. Gervaise is to be kept separate from other slaves. Sir John ensures Gervaise's placement with the captives. The following morning, Sir John goes ashore with the slaves. Gervaise is presented as a unique captive, potentially suited for servitude at an auberge. The plan unfolds discreetly, with Gervaise's true identity concealed for investigation.|"[""**1.

"""He is a strong young man, Sir John,"" the officer noted, ""and would be a good rower in a galley. I'll assign him to the crew of the St. Elmo. Follow me,"" he said to Gervaise in Turkish, leading the way to the prison. Inside, there was a vaulted room with rushes on the floor. In the courtyard, other slaves sat in the sun, some injured or ill. Gervaise approached them. ""You're new here,"" one said, pointing to their ragged clothes. ""When did you arrive? Any more newcomers?"" ""I was injured while quarrying stones,"" Gervaise replied. The others spoke of hope for liberation from their captors.

In the evening, everyone returned from their different tasks. The officer who brought Gervaise in spoke to the overseer of the galley slaves. He explained that Gervaise was assigned to his group as there were no vacancies for him to be a servitor. The overseer, short of hands, accepted Gervaise and noted his strength despite his sullen appearance. The slaves, exhausted, waited for their food which was rye bread and thin broth. Each had a horn for soup or water, washed after use, and then rested. Gervaise tried to engage with them, but most were lost in thoughts of their distant homes. As night fell, silence enveloped the room, broken only by occasional questions. The next day, they gathered at the courtyard fountain before starting work on the galley. The slaves, though more cheerful, carried on with their work, finding solace in the routine and camaraderie.|"[""1.

The conversation between Gervaise and his fellow slave was interrupted by the arrival of knights at the quay. The slaves quickly straightened up at the oars, ready to row. Among the knights was Gervaise's friend Ralph, who didn't recognize him due to his darkened skin and hair. Ralph, now in command of the party, seemed pleased with his new role. The galley set off from the wharf, and the rowing began. Although the work was tough, it wasn't overly demanding. Gervaise was relieved that the dye on his skin was lasting, even after breaking into a sweat. The galley's purpose was to train the young knights, so the rowing was interspersed with instructions, giving the slaves some respite from continuous labor.|"['1.

Sometimes the galley went ahead swiftly for a short distance, almost as if pursuing an enemy. Then it would suddenly change direction, with slaves rowing on one side and backing on the other to turn quickly. After a brief pause, it would back up or change course to avoid an imaginary threat. Later, the knights would practice firing a gun at a target in the sea. By eleven o'clock, they returned to port. The slaves were given bread and water before resting. A slave described the harsh conditions of rowing all day, the exhaustion, and the fear of punishment. He mentioned unsuccessful attempts to escape and the difficulty of breaking free due to vigilant guards. He believed that bribing overseers could be a way to freedom, as they might be willing to help for the right price.|"['1.

Each morning, Gervaise noticed the inn servant nearby as he left to work with his group, but he remained silent. He believed his suspicions were confirmed and that his efforts were not in vain. However, he decided it was wiser to wait until the week passed and he was taken for his routine renewal before revealing any signs that might alert his comrades. On the eighth morning, the overseer informed him, “Number 36, you will stay here. You are needed for different duties.” The overseer continued, “I am to escort you to the English inn. The knight who handed you to me upon your arrival mentioned that you might be required as a servant there. If there is a vacancy, you are fortunate. Servants have a much better life than galley slaves, and the English inn is known for its good treatment of staff. Follow me.” The English inn, located on the grand street of the Knights, was an impressive Gothic structure. Sir John Boswell greeted them in the courtyard. “Please wait here a moment,” he told the overseer. “The steward will interview the slave regarding his skills. Although he may be considered too young for the current vacancy, I believe I will find a suitable position for him soon. He appears diligent and capable, handling his misfortunes admirably.” Gervaise shared his experience with the two knights, recounting his conversation with the galley slave. “By St. George!” exclaimed the bailiff. “Your|"['1.

Three days later, as the night fell, a group of galley slaves huddled together at the far end of the room, their faces filled with excitement. They stuffed bedding into the windows to muffle their conversation. The dim light revealed their intense anticipation. While many were unaware of the details, they knew a plot was brewing. The leaders had kept it secret, but now it seemed all were involved. The slaves were cautious, making sure their voices were not heard. Meanwhile, Sir John and Gervaise were strategizing a plan involving secret signals through small loopholes in the prison.

The following day, the grand master summoned the bailiffs and knights of the grand cross for a council meeting. Gervaise was also requested to attend. Ralph expressed admiration for Gervaise's accomplishments but attributed some of it to luck. Gervaise, feeling nervous, believed luck played a significant role in his success. The knights observed a Greek man's suspicious behavior and apprehended him. Vrados, a friend of Ralph, was also implicated but was expected to explain his innocence. Gervaise was praised for uncovering a plot to overthrow the Order and was rewarded with a commandery in Lincolnshire and the command of a galley. The council acknowledged Gervaise's discernment and exceptional service. The knights under his command were expected to prove themselves in battle against infidels.|"['1.

Gervaise, a young knight, was unexpectedly promoted to command a galley by the grand master of the Order. Despite feeling overwhelmed by the honor, Gervaise was unsure if he was deserving of such a responsibility. His friend Ralph reassured him, emphasizing that age did not determine one's ability to lead. Ralph and other knights were eager to serve under Gervaise's command, seeing it as a source of pride for their generation. Gervaise, however, felt the weight of the responsibility and doubted if the younger knights would respect his authority. Despite his doubts, he understood the significance of the promotion and the impact it had on the Order. Ralph expressed his confidence in Gervaise's leadership and hoped to serve as his lieutenant on the galley.|"[""1.

Ralph expressed his contentment with the situation, mentioning that he wished he could have been the commander while Gervaise, his friend, the lieutenant. Nevertheless, he felt reassured by having Gervaise by his side, which lessened the weight of his responsibilities. The young knights in the neighboring inns were eager to join the crew of the new galley, just like those from England. The selection process was meticulous, with only well-behaved and skilled young knights being chosen. Ralph Harcourt was appointed as the galley's lieutenant, a decision that pleased both him and Gervaise. The young knights saw their selection as an honor and were determined to make the Order proud. The galley was set to launch in two weeks, and Gervaise was relieved to learn that the slaves involved in the uprising would not be punished. The plot had been foiled, and the council decided to let the matter rest without further trials. Sir John Boswell, who had taken a special interest in Gervaise, discussed with him the idea of the Order being more flexible regarding vows of celibacy and poverty, suggesting that allowing marriage could benefit the Order.|"['1.

In all matters, whether it be about interest or money, decisions are influenced greatly. Dispensations, though not common, could be obtained by knights from the Pope with the grand master's support. This would allow knights to be released from their vows, especially after serving their active duty. The idea of dispensations arose from the realization that some knights, who took their vows as young boys, might regret them later in life. The discussion included the possibility of allowing knights to marry and have heirs, as many had already broken their vows of poverty and service. The hope was to see a change in the Order, perhaps becoming solely a military one, rather than the current mix of monk and soldier. Despite these thoughts, Gervaise prepared for his last ride, as the new galley was ready to be launched. The grand master and other knights attended the ceremony, where Gervaise was appointed as the commander of the galley, named the Santa Barbara. The event was marked with cheers and celebrations as the galley took to the water.|"['1.

The next day, a group of rowers were brought in, some from other galleys and others from the fortifications. It took three weeks to train them, forming a strong crew selected for their age and strength. Gervaise, appreciated for uncovering a plot, had a lighter complexion now. The knights, already experienced at sea, prepared to sail. Gervaise met with the grand master and the general of the galleys. They granted him freedom to choose his cruising area, advising caution and prudence. He was assigned to the Tunis coast to combat pirates. The general emphasized the importance of maintaining discipline and respect among the crew, composed mostly of young knights.

During a journey, Gervaise showed kindness to the slaves on the galley, which was uncommon during those times when slaves were seen as mere beasts of burden. Gervaise's actions were met with approval by some knights, though they saw it more from a practical standpoint than a compassionate one. The slaves appreciated the unusual treatment, and one expressed gratitude, saying that if all slaves were treated this way, slavery would be more bearable. Gervaise's discussions with Suleiman Ali had led him to view faith in a different light, understanding the common ground between Christianity and Islam. He believed that showing kindness to slaves not only improved their well-being but also benefited their work performance.

The knights were divided, some in favor of pursuing the pirates to the starboard side, and others leaning towards finding Visconti on the larboard side. Eventually, Gervaise directed the galley northwards, setting a swift pace to potentially intercept the pirates before they reached Sardinia.

Four hours passed before the lookout knight spotted three dark specks on the horizon. Gervaise climbed up to join him and adjusted their course to intercept the ships. As the sun began to set, the pirate ships were clearly visible but still about ten miles away. Gervaise then ordered the slaves to stop rowing and rest. They were served a meal and wine before being allowed to sleep. At one o'clock, the galley resumed its journey quietly, with cloth wrapped around the oars to muffle any noise. After some time, a light was spotted ahead, likely from the captain's ship. The crew prepared to approach stealthily, hoping to surprise the pirates at daybreak.

When the lantern was spotted, the rowing slaves were ordered to stop. They were informed they wouldn't be needed for two hours. At the crack of dawn, they were called back to row. In the increasing light, the knights on the poop could see three vague shapes about two miles ahead. Closing in, they saw signs of life on board. The slaves were urged to row hard towards the easternmost ship. With the plan to take on the ship furthest east first, they aimed to tackle the others one by one. The pirates realized they couldn't escape and prepared to fight. The galley swiftly approached the pirate ship, breaking oars and throwing the pirates off balance.

Gervaise had instructed the knights to keep their enthusiasm in check. Despite being outnumbered, they successfully boarded the pirate ship and formed a strong defensive line. The corsairs struggled to break through the knights' defense. As the battle raged on, a third pirate ship approached, and its crew joined the fight. Gervaise led the charge and defeated the pirates on the galley. A cannon from the prize ship helped turn the tide in their favor.

Warned by the cries of their friends that they were under attack from behind, the Muslim defenders hesitated. Ralph seized the moment and leaped onto the ship, followed by his companions. A fierce battle ensued. The Muslims fought fiercely, refusing to surrender. Some chose to jump into the sea rather than be defeated by the Christians, but most fought until the end. The Christian knights celebrated their victory as the last of the Muslims fell. Gervaise praised their bravery and ordered the slaves to be freed from their chains. Among the liberated slaves were Christians from different European countries who had been captured by pirates. The joy of the freed Christians was overwhelming.

The three knights knelt at the benches where they had toiled and suffered, hiding their faces in their hands. Their silent sobs and scarred shoulders told the young knights of their deep emotion. Rising, Fabricius Caretto, Giacomo Da Vinci, and Pietro Forzi, knight commanders of the Order, revealed their changed appearance after six years of captivity. Gervaise Tresham, commander of the galley, welcomed them back, expressing gratitude for their rescue. The Italian knights, led by Gervaise, provided refreshments and clothes for the rescued captives. Urgent cases among the wounded were attended to, and the released Christians were divided among the three prizes. By noon, the ships were organized, and the knights finally gathered for a meal on board the galley.|['1.

Gervaise discovered the three knights in the cabin, clad in the traditional attire of their Order. They looked vastly different from when he first met them. They had cleaned up, groomed their tangled hair, which alone was enough to change their appearance. The sense of freedom and being knights of a respected Order had transformed them even more. Although they appeared thin and tired, their knightly demeanor returned naturally as they put on their armor and swords. The knights expressed their gratitude for being freed from slavery and now being able to fight as Christian knights. They shared their encounter with the pirates and the plan to warn coastal towns of impending danger. Gervaise proposed utilizing the knights' aid in the expedition by leading the released captives on the captured vessels to support the Order's knights in battle.|"['1.

The plan was set, and the ships were prepared for their mission. Caretto assured Sir Gervaise of their ability to aid the galley without engaging in close combat. The wind favored their journey as they set sail towards Cape Carbonara. After a long night of rowing, the fleet finally anchored near the cape. Gervaise and Ralph decided to send a boat ashore to gather information about possible pirate sightings and locations. Sir Fabricius Caretto returned with a swift sailing vessel, ideal for their needs. The crew was bolstered with rowers to ensure speed in case of calm seas. Gervaise entrusted Caretto with urgent messages for Naples, Pisa, and Genoa, warning of the impending threat of Moorish corsairs. The fleet awaited further instructions and hoped for swift reinforcements from Genoa.|"['1.

In every town you visit, try to meet the local leader and some of their advisors. Once you finish in Genoa, head straight for the Island of Madalena, northeast of here. We might be there, or a boat will have directions for you. It might be wise to skip Naples to save time. Ask for help at Ostia to send news along the coast. The pirates will likely stick to the northern waters at first. It's about 200 miles to Ostia, and if the wind is good, you could reach there tomorrow afternoon. Get information about the forces available, then sail south to Madalena. It will take about six to seven days to reach us, maybe more if the winds are against you. Consider hiring a faster boat at Ostia or getting fresh rowers for speed. Gervaise and Ralph discussed a plan to scout the corsairs without being seen. They decided to use a small, inconspicuous boat with rowers to explore the possible hideouts while the main galley followed behind.|['1.

The Italian knight embarked on the important mission to gather information about possible Moorish pirates. Fosco, a clever and agile fellow, was chosen to assist. He was instructed to row to Muravera, a village at the mouth of a river, to inquire about any sightings of pirates. If needed, he would row back to meet the galley or stay put until they arrived. Fosco was advised to disguise himself and carry minimal provisions. The next day, at Lunasei, no signs of pirates were reported. At Orosei, the coast was clear, and Fosco was to inspect the next bay. The plan was to anchor north of the cape, allowing Fosco to investigate further. The team suspected the pirates might be hiding in the deep, narrow bays to trap passing ships. Their strategy aimed to cut off any pirate escape routes and intercept ships traveling between Corsica and the mainland.|"[""1.

Gervaise suggested that the pirates might be hiding in the inlets to the north to avoid detection as they approached their rendezvous. Fosco mentioned spotting small vessels and fishing boats in the area, but they were not corsair galleys. They decided to wait until nightfall and anchor on the north side of the Island of Madalena to avoid being seen. There was speculation among the knights about the pirates' intentions, whether they had left or were planning a large-scale attack on nearby towns. By daybreak, they anchored in a bay north of Madalena, concealed from passing ships. Fosco returned after scouting the area, discovering a creek with lights and voices, likely belonging to the corsairs. Despite the fishermen's fear, Fosco urged them to continue their mission, assuring them they could escape if needed.|"['1.

We waited at the point for a few hours, observing the surroundings. Everything seemed calm after that time. A couple of lanterns were still lit, but there was no movement on the ships. After waiting half an hour more to ensure the crews were asleep, we silently rowed up the creek, staying close to the rocks. Not much was visible; the galleys were tied together. There were eight on our side and perhaps seven on the other. It didn't matter much to me, and since the men were terrified, we turned back without any issues. As we returned, we heard oars approaching and saw two large galleys row past us while we stayed hidden under the cliff. Ralph and Gervaise discussed a plan to use fire ships to combat the corsairs. They also worked on disguises for the captured Christians to confuse the enemy. They found provisions on the captured ship and prepared flour for the crew.|['1.

As night descended, Ralph and two French knights set off in a captured vessel. The next day, a sail was spotted approaching from the north, revealed to be Caretto's craft. The galley quickly rowed out to meet the boat in a bay. At dusk, they exchanged news. Genoa faced civil strife, delaying their galleys for two weeks. Pisa lacked warships, relying on the Pope's aid. The corsairs lurked nearby, growing in numbers. Sir Fabricius arrived, frustrated by delays. He warned towns and villagers of the pirate threat. Despite efforts in Genoa and Pisa, the corsairs posed a menace. The urgent situation required swift action to defend Italy's shores.|"['1.

Gervaise and the knights were disappointed but consoled by their efforts. Ralph returned with boats to aid in their mission. He had purchased coasters and fishing boats to fight against the Moorish galleys. The knights armed themselves with axes and hatchets gathered from local woodsmen. They prepared to face the corsairs, hoping they wouldn't set sail the next day. Fosco kept watch for any movements from the pirate fleet. The knights were ready to fight to the end, determined not to be captured again. They planned to follow the corsairs closely and attack any separated ships. Their resolve was strong, and they were prepared for the upcoming battle against the enemy.|['1.

Gervaise and his comrades were in a tight spot. They had a daring plan to attack a fleet of corsairs, but time was running out. The knights were restless, knowing that help from Genoa was weeks away. Gervaise, however, had a clever scheme up his sleeve. At dawn, he gathered all the knights on board to reveal his strategy. He explained that they couldn't face the corsairs at sea directly. Instead, they would use fire ships loaded with combustibles to set the enemy fleet ablaze. With the element of surprise and the chaos caused by the fires, they planned to capture the corsairs as they tried to escape. The knights, fishermen, and former captives were all ready for revenge. It was a risky plan, but their determination to protect the coastal towns from the corsairs gave them hope for success.|"[""1.

Once again, cheers erupted from the knights, filled with pride and excitement for the upcoming mission. Gervaise, their leader, instructed them to distribute materials for making mantles for the Christians held captive. Sir Ralph would provide thread and fish bone needles. The knights were to ensure the crosses on the mantles were visible. They were also to examine the arms needed and feed the slaves well. The rest were to prepare the native craft with combustibles and torches for the attack on the corsairs. Bullocks were to be killed for fresh meat. After swift preparations, the knights and the Sards were ready for battle. Gervaise emphasized caution to avoid unnecessary risks during the conflict. The knights eagerly awaited the impending showdown, eager to seek revenge and break free from captivity.|['1.

At dusk, the fleet set sail slowly due to light winds, as Gervaise planned to attack after midnight. Loaded guns and ammunition were ready. The galley led, towing fishing boats and coasters, until they neared the inlet. Fire ships were in two lines, with torches lit. The attack began with rowing boats throwing torches at corsairs, causing chaos. Fire ships were fastened to enemy vessels, engulfing them in flames. The battle intensified, with cannons firing and pirates leaping overboard to escape. Some ships managed to navigate through the chaos. The knights fought relentlessly, causing significant damage. Eventually, the pirates suffered heavy losses as the flames spread, and the battle raged on.|['1.

After a fierce battle, the knights, captives, and Sards successfully took control of the enemy ship. Most corsairs surrendered, while others fought back but were quickly defeated. The majority of the enemy crew jumped overboard to escape, leaving behind the chained slaves. The attacking party managed to capture six enemy vessels that tried to flee. They found some Christian captives on board, whom they promptly freed. Despite the victory, Gervaise felt remorse for the lives lost in the fiery destruction of the other galleys. The knights decided to sail the captured ships to Genoa to safely return the rescued captives to their homes.

The main reason for sailing to Genoa was to easily recruit sailors to take the captured ships to Rhodes. Beneath this practical purpose, there was a more light-hearted motivation that Ralph jokingly pointed out. He teased the knights for secretly desiring the admiration and attention of the noble ladies in Genoa. Despite this, the decision was made to sail to Genoa, where they anticipated a warm reception. The captives and Moors were evenly distributed among the ships. Plans were made to combat pirates and rescue captives in the hills near Tempe. The fleet set sail for Genoa, facing a light wind but with eager captives rowing to hasten their return. Upon reaching Bastia, the locals were initially wary until they recognized the Order's banners, calming their fears.|"['1.

As soon as the news spread that the knights' galley had not only captured thirteen corsairs but also destroyed eleven others, the people's alarm turned into wild enthusiasm. The population gathered on the shore as Ralph returned with supplies, and a flotilla of boats accompanied him, filled with men and women in colorful attire, carrying flags, green boughs, and gifts. Musicians played traditional island tunes as the ladies presented fruit to the galley. Gervaise, the young commander, received accolades from the amazed crowd, who were also impressed by the youth of the knights. The next day, the fleet set off for Genoa, with Caretto advising to signal the fleet to prevent a mistaken attack. While Caretto went ahead to explain, the knights and crews prepared for landing, donning armor and festive attire.

The fleet returned to the port in triumph, with the galley leading the way. Flags fluttered on every ship, and the town was adorned with tapestries and curtains.

"""But how come you're all so young, Sir Ralph?"" one lady asked Harcourt, the second in command, after he recounted the galleys' capture.

The countess, a widow with her young daughter Claudia, welcomed Gervaise warmly. She appreciated his deeds over words, mentioning Sir Fabricius Caretto's high praise of him.

Caretto interrupted, praising Claudia's words before the countess could respond. He believed the young knight would appreciate her gift discreetly. Caretto assured the countess that the young knight, leaving soon, would not boast about the favor. He mentioned that Claudia's admiration for the knight could keep her heart secure until a suitor was chosen. The next day, Gervaise was surprised to be named a noble of Genoa, an honor usually reserved for royalty. He was also gifted Milanese armor and jewels by the city.

The grand master agreed that the plan to shelter the slaves on the galley had been successful. Three days later, the Santa Barbara set sail again. While cruising along the coast, they encountered a shipwreck and decided to investigate. Gervaise, along with three knights, went ashore in a boat rowed by galley slaves. However, upon reaching the wreck, they were ambushed by pirates hidden on the ship. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the capture of Gervaise and the death of the knights. The pirates quickly retreated to their vessel, taking Gervaise as a prisoner.

As the ship set sail, the captain scolded his crew for not capturing the knights as ordered. They explained that capturing Gervaise alone was challenging and overcoming all four knights at once was impossible before reinforcements arrived. Gervaise was tied to a mast and managed to catch a glimpse of a galley approaching. The corsair fired a gun and recalled their boats. The ship couldn't reach the galley due to the wind, leaving the knights stranded. The galley disappeared from sight, and the ship changed course to evade capture. They anchored near the Morea coast and divided the loot. Gervaise, thirsty and bound, was given water by a kind sailor. He fell asleep tied up but was later freed. The captain took Claudia's gift from Gervaise, who valiantly resisted but was overpowered. The crew respected his strength and allowed him some freedom on deck.

The captain, although annoyed that only one of the four captives was caught, was pleased to have outsmarted his foes. He treated Gervaise better than most prisoners. Gervaise, pretending not to understand Turkish, overheard the crew discussing selling him for a high ransom. Disheartened, he had hoped to escape if sold at a different port. The news that he might be sold in Africa was a setback. Gervaise was determined to recover Claudia's gift and considered the corsair keeping it a stroke of luck.

"The leader approached while the man spoke. He chatted with the sailor, who then turned to Gervaise. ""The leader heard you helmed that ship; he questioned the eight men, who all shared the same tale. He's puzzled how a young man like you led a ship manned by famed warriors, even among us,"" Gervaise explained. The leader, curious, asked a freed slave from Tripoli about the strength of the crew. Gervaise, uneasy, hoped the rowers would keep silent about the corsair fleet's destruction. When the leader considered attacking again, Gervaise knew he had to dissuade him. He shared news of capturing three vessels, surprising the leader. As they sailed south, Gervaise watched for Visconti's ship. The leader's anger grew, mistreating captives.

The men rushed at Gervaise upon the captain's command, overpowering him and binding him on the deck. The captain struck him with a stick until Gervaise nearly lost consciousness. After ordering water to be thrown on him, the captain left in a boat, leaving Gervaise with ex-galley slaves who tended to his bruises. Despite his injuries, Gervaise felt grateful he wasn't whipped, considering his value as a slave. Determined to recover his lost possession held by the pirate captain, Gervaise walked to prevent stiffness. When the captain returned with an Arab buyer, they discussed Gervaise's worth.

Muley has tended to his injuries and will likely recover soon. The merchant asks his wife what she plans to do with the Christian slave he bought for her. She is unsure, thinking of having him serve coffee and work in the garden, but is surprised by the slave's capabilities. The merchant suggests the slave could still perform those tasks, as Christians treat women well. To keep the slave's identity hidden, they decide to disguise him with a turban. Muley, the steward, prepares a disguise for the slave. The merchant and the steward discuss the Christian's unusual qualities, and the next day, the slave is transformed into a Nubian to blend in.

The knights of the Order dedicate their lives to their work, residing in convents at Rhodes or commanderies across Europe to manage estates. When asked about marriage, Gervaise explains that while they do military duties in convents, marriage is restricted, but once they oversee estates in Europe, they can marry. A merchant inquired about missing corsair ships raiding Italy, but Gervaise hadn't heard of it. The merchant laments the strife caused by corsairs, hindering trade and relations with Europe.

Two days later, the merchant's family moved to his house two miles outside the town, and Gervaise stayed there for six months. His life was pleasant; he was treated kindly by the merchant and his wife, with light duties in the garden. However, he felt conflicted about escaping from such kind masters. One evening, the merchant returned with a sultan's officer and soldiers, who took Gervaise to the slaves' quarter for being a Christian slave bought against the law. Although surprised, Gervaise saw this as an opportunity to plan an escape. In the slaves' quarter, he met other miserable slaves, both Europeans and criminals.

After satisfying his thirst at a well near the mosque, he retraced his steps out of the village and into the countryside. He walked until nightfall, now fifty miles away from Tripoli. Hoping to evade pursuers, he continued eastward. For days, he journeyed through villages, stocking up on dates and acquiring a water bottle. The sea remained calm to his left, hindering any escape by boat. On the fifth day, a change in weather hinted at opportunity. Observing boats by the shore, he engaged local fishermen in conversation, feigning ignorance of the sea. Gervaise planned to seize a fast-sailing felucca, selecting the best one.

In history, sailors faced sudden storms on the sea. To survive, they lashed oars together and rode to safety. A sailor named Gervaise faced a fierce storm.

Sir John observed the mighty Turkish fleet, confident in the island's defenses and provisions. He noticed a small craft sailing towards them, suspecting it might carry late comrades. Quickly, he and other knights boarded a galley to intercept. As they rowed out, a Turkish galley fired a warning shot. The Turkish ship closed in on the small craft, which tried to escape but was soon overtaken. Despite the brave resistance, the small craft was captured by the Turks. Sir John lamented their missed chance to surrender and be retaken. More Turkish galleys were approaching, signaling a challenging situation ahead.|"['1.

"""Look, Sir John,"" one knight exclaimed, ""there's a man standing alone in the front of that ship, facing the Moors. They're trying to get to him, but he's holding them off."" 

""He's chosen his spot well, D'Urville,"" replied Sir John. ""Fire the bow guns at the galley to distract them."" 

As the assailants closed in, a man jumped overboard. The knights prepared to avenge him. 

After a brief struggle, the knights retreated. However, a familiar face, Tresham, emerged from the Turk ship. 

""It's Tresham!"" Sir John exclaimed, embracing him. Tresham explained how he escaped and the grand master's strict orders.

Gervaise arrived at the palace an hour later, dressed in armor gifted by Genoa. Despite being busy, the grand master welcomed him warmly, recognizing his bravery. Gervaise was invited to dine that evening and share his captivity tale. He recounted his adventures twice that day, once to Sir John Kendall and later to the grand master. The council members were present, including the Viscount de Monteuil, who praised Gervaise's past heroics. The Viscount also relayed a message from a noble lady, confirming her trust in Gervaise. The knights were eager for battle, but the grand master, aware of the Turkish army's strength, opted for a defensive strategy. He believed in the city's ability to withstand the siege and inflict a blow to the enemy's morale. The Turkish army, led by Paleologus, positioned themselves on St. Stephen's Hill, preparing for the impending assault on Rhodes.|"[""1.

The defence of St. Stephen's Hill in Rhodes was not fortified, indicating its perceived safety. Forty years later, the Muslims besieged the city, but the garrison felt no fear as the enemy camped on the hill. The pasha's tent stood on the summit, surrounded by marquees of other commanders. The sultan had schemed treachery by gathering intelligence on Rhodes' fortifications. A renegade German, Maitre Georges, planned to betray Rhodes. The pasha's herald summoned the city to surrender, promising safety to the population. The Rhodians, content under the Knights' rule, refused to surrender. The Turks targeted Fort St. Nicholas, prompting a response from Gervaise, who aided in the defense as the grand master's aide-de-camp. Gervaise observed and reported on the defense to ensure reinforcements were sent when needed.|"[""1.

The time needed to reload the large cannon was significant, but they continued to launch heavy missiles against the wall at regular intervals. Caretto and Gervaise ventured out through a small gate on the eastern side of the tower to inspect the damage caused by the shots. Caretto expressed concern about the wall's durability, noting cracks and signs of weakening. Meanwhile, D'Aubusson was questioning Maitre Georges, a former ally of Paleologus, who sought refuge within the city. Despite suspicions of his motives, Georges was warmly received by the grand master to gather information while keeping an eye on his actions. Georges, appearing amiable, mingled with the knights, unaware of the surveillance on him to prevent him from discovering strategic weaknesses.

"""It is worse than I expected,"" D'Aubusson said. ""When we built our defenses, we never imagined facing such powerful guns. Our walls can withstand regular artillery, but against these, we must rely more on swords than walls. Luckily, the Turks have to cross water to reach the breach, giving us an advantage."" Tresham suggested a plan to sabotage the Turkish guns, but D'Aubusson dismissed it as too risky. The bombardment continued, creating a breach.

With permission, sir, I shall head out to the watergate, swim up the inner harbor, and convert a few grounded ships into fire ships to create panic among the enemy vessels. The grand master approved the plan and wrote an order for Sir Gervaise Tresham, granting him full authority. Gervaise swiftly executed the plan, swimming to St. Michael's tower with the grand master's message. Urgent aid was requested as the knights defending the breach were in dire need. Gervaise, accompanied by knights, prepared fire ships with combustibles to attack the Turkish ships. The galleys towed the fire ships close to the enemy vessels, and the captains ignited the powder to set the ships ablaze.

The other three fire ships were quickly set adrift. Two of them succeeded, while the Turks managed to push off the third. It drifted through the vessels and eventually anchored beside one aground. With only ten knights, Gervaise couldn't attack the larger ships filled with troops. Instead, he directed the galley towards fishing boats used by the Turks. The rowers sped up upon his command. The Turkish troops panicked as they saw the galley approaching, attempting to row away but failing. The galley collided with one of the boats, splitting it in two. Gervaise then targeted smaller boats, sinking six. The Turkish fleet fell into disarray, retreating. The defenders of St. Nicholas, inspired by the chaos, drove the assailants back.

Caretto agreed, acknowledging the crucial rescue by fire ships that turned the tide of battle. The knights and Turks exchanged salutes before parting ways. As night fell, slaves worked tirelessly under the knights' direction to fortify the defenses. The next morning, a solemn service of thanksgiving was held at St. John's Church. Despite Turkish cannon fire, the attack seemed to have shifted. The knights continued to strengthen the defenses, anticipating another assault. A grand procession followed the service, showcasing the unity of the knights and the support of the townspeople.

Paleologus hesitated about the report's authenticity, suspecting it might be a ploy to push for a swift capture of the stronghold. Recognizing the grand master's pivotal role in the defense, he resorted to a common Eastern tactic - assassination. Using two men disguised as deserters, they spread false news of a massive enemy force approaching, causing panic among defenders. Some knights, fearing defeat, urged surrender. The grand master, D'Aubusson, sternly rebuked them, offering safe passage if they left or a chance to redeem themselves in battle. Foiling an assassination plot, Filelfo, loyal to D'Aubusson, exposed the traitors. As the Turks prepared for another assault, English sailors aided in fortifying defenses at St. Nicholas tower. Gervaise, overseeing the tower's defense, assigned the sailors to bolster the night watch, ensuring readiness for the impending attack.|"[""1.

D'Aubusson, a key figure in the defense of St. Nicholas, shared crucial information with his knights. He revealed that the Turks planned to silently haul a bridge across the port using a rope. This unexpected tactic aimed to catch the defenders off guard. However, thanks to the vigilance of an English sailor, the plan was uncovered. The admiral swiftly prepared fire ships to counter the impending attack. The sailor was generously rewarded for his service with two hundred golden crowns. As night fell, the Turks initiated their assault, but their plan was thwarted when the anchor holding the bridge was discovered.

As the boats approached the breach, the Turks bravely climbed up to attack despite the hail of shots. Armed with short ladders, they scaled the defenses only to face a formidable line of knights. The knights stood three deep, armed with swords, battleaxes, and spears, creating a barrier of steel points. Meanwhile, buckets of blazing pitch and Greek fire were hurled down upon the assailants. The battle intensified as fire ships and galleys entered the fray, leading to a chaotic scene of cannon fire, clashes, and screams. Despite initial setbacks, the Christian defenders managed to sink Turkish boats and galleys, inflicting heavy losses. After a fierce struggle, the Turks, led by the courageous Ibrahim, were forced to retreat.

D'Aubusson sought advice from Maitre Georges, who suggested building a battery at a spot of questionable utility. Other circumstances heightened suspicions of the renegade's betrayal. Georges was captured, confessed under torture to betraying the town, and was hanged the same day. Despite the confession, his guilt remains uncertain as torture can produce false confessions. D'Aubusson countered Turkish efforts by using a wooden catapult to hurl rocks, undermining the Turks' constructions. The Turks, noticing the diminishing materials in the ditch, prepared for an assault. The Turks attacked, using distractions and a fierce bombardment, catching the defenders off guard.
