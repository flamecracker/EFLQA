Dotty Dimple was in a dilemma about some missing rings. She debated whether to tell her aunt, who never wore them. She felt Prudy, her sister, wouldn't understand, especially after a recent argument. Prudy, with her refined manners, scolded Dotty for wearing a rosary. Later, at a fancy party in New York, Prudy struggled with her uncomfortable woollen dress among the elegant city children.
