Polly, a dedicated student, was often left alone by her schoolmates due to her intense focus on her studies. Despite being seen as eccentric for her passion for learning, Polly's determination was fueled by the need to support herself. One evening, her unusual behavior caught the attention of a teacher who allowed her to retire early due to feeling unwell. In her room, Polly lit a candle and sat at her writing desk, determined to pursue an idea. As the teakettle sang and the room exuded a cozy atmosphere, Polly played the piano and sang a magical song about fire and warmth.

Esther blushed and trembled as she greeted her guest, Polly, who had a way of making her shy with compliments. Despite their differences, they had grown closer in their new environment. Polly, looking charming in a crimson dress, expressed her hunger and longing for Esther's tea. Polly reminisced about their old campfire circle, missing their friend, the Princess. Esther sadly revealed she wouldn't be going home for Christmas due to expensive music lessons. She hesitated to inform the Princess, fearing disappointment.

Polly looked puzzled by Esther's deep admiration for Betty. She couldn't understand why Esther was so concerned about Betty's feelings. Even though they all loved each other, Polly doubted if they truly worried about each other's emotions. When Polly mentioned that she wouldn't be going home for Christmas, Esther seemed disappointed. Esther wished Betty could have Polly around during the holidays. Polly, feeling a bit hurt, asked Esther if she could spend the holidays with her. Esther, confused by the request, wondered why Polly, who had no special feelings for her, would want to spend Christmas with her in a cheap New York boarding house. Polly, with a serious expression, asked Esther not to say anything until she finished explaining why she wanted to stay with her.

"Esther crossed the room with her back turned as Polly spoke. Turning to face her, Esther's gaze made Polly look away. Esther, with dignity and sincerity, addressed Polly's plans.

Esther remained quiet, her eyes brimming with tears. She pondered the futility of arguing with Polly in such a state. Despite having much to say truthfully, one thought lingered: a mother would never deceive her as Polly was. Yet, Esther hesitated, questioning if revealing Polly's secret would be a betrayal, even if it was for her own good. Polly had confided with the expectation of confidentiality. Esther's silence only fueled Polly's frustration, prompting her to seek a way to silence Esther. Glancing around the room, Polly's eyes fell on a photograph of the Princess, contrasting their appearances.

Polly was in the middle of speaking when she noticed Esther's pale face. Concerned, she asked if Esther was feeling ill and why she hadn't mentioned it before. Putting her arm around Esther, Polly led her to a chair as Esther began to cry. Polly, feeling remorseful, knelt beside her, asking what she had said to upset her. Polly apologized in her own way, admitting she could be cross but would never reveal a secret.

Polly calmly suggested to Esther to consider staying at another boarding house for a couple of weeks. Esther, who was studying music in New York, had already performed at two church concerts. Esther chuckled at the comparison between church concerts and the stage. She warned Polly that if she continued with her plan, she would have to stay with her to prevent any mishaps. Polly jokingly agreed and abruptly left to return to school. As she left, she noticed a young boy heading towards Esther's room, likely a street child with a passion for music whom Esther was teaching. Meanwhile, Meg Everett expressed disappointment to Betty about the upcoming party, as Polly and Esther wouldn't be attending. The party was meant to be a small gathering of their Camp Fire circle to cook dinner together and enjoy each other's company.|"['1.

Betty firmly declined the idea of inviting Anthony to their parties, emphasizing that while they should support him, treating him as an equal was out of the question.

Esther's friendly nature clashed with her desire to confront Billy Webster for his unwarranted interference with Polly. Esther questioned Billy's right to dictate Polly's actions, given their lack of a close relationship. Despite their history in the Camp Fire group, Billy's protective motives irked Esther. Billy, defensive, explained his visit to New York and the theater, prompted by Mollie's concerns about Esther. Misunderstandings arose when Billy assumed Esther was at a show, only to find her performing on stage. Polly, seeking understanding, promised to reveal the truth after the play.

Despite his concerns about fitting in, he appreciated Meg's invitation, knowing it was out of loyalty to his sister, Nan.

Anthony Graham was initially unsure about accepting Meg Everett's invitation, but now he was thrilled he did. The evening was exactly what he needed. Looking around the table, his determination grew stronger. Despite moments of doubt, he knew he needed to keep moving forward in life.

Betty felt a mix of emotions as she watched her friends having a good time. Billy and Mollie's dance caught her attention; he seemed strong and decisive, while she was gentle and yielding. Despite Mollie's smile over their romance, Betty couldn't deny they made a good pair. Edith, on the other hand, danced with a new friend, Frederick, who was older and unfamiliar to the group. Concerns about his reputation surfaced among the girls. Edith, different from the rest, had confided her desire for a change from her job at a millinery shop.

Betty's faint smile caught Sylvia's attention as she bent down to see. Despite Sylvia's usual reserved demeanor, her expression softened at the sight of Betty's smile. It was rare to see Betty smile in these recent days, making it a significant moment. Sylvia's once tightly bound pigtails had been replaced by neatly braided hair framing her face. Her complexion remained pale, but her determined chin and resolute gaze often drew attention. Sylvia acknowledged her fondness for Polly but asserted that she made her own decisions, unaffected by Polly's influence. Concern for Polly's health lingered as Dr. Barton had yet to diagnose her illness.

Remember, there was a mother too, and Herr Crippen described her as an American and very lovely. Her own family distanced themselves when she married a German musician. Betty, Esther's sister, had more privileges. To make amends for separating Esther from her sister, Dick and I invited Esther to live here as Betty's companion. Esther graciously accepted. When Herr Crippen returned and revealed Esther's relation to Betty, Esther kept it a secret to protect Betty's love for us. Hearts are resilient, and love is what truly matters. Betty discovered papers in an old trunk proving she was legally adopted by us. She must understand that our love for her remains unchanged. Polly, eager to find Betty, traced her steps to the log cabin where she sought solace. Despite the chilling air and snow flurries, Polly followed Betty's trail, hoping to reassure her that nothing had changed.|"[""1.
