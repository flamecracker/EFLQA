Once supper was finished, the giant instructed his wife to bring him his harp. Jack peeked out from his hiding spot and watched as the harp was placed before the giant. The harp was beautifully crafted; when the giant commanded it to play, it produced the most exquisite music without anyone touching it.

Around this time, Mr. Fitzwarren's daughter, Miss Alice, was taking a morning stroll. Dick, dressed in fine clothes given by Mr. Fitzwarren, walked behind her. During their walk, Miss Alice generously helped a poor woman with children but accidentally dropped her purse. Dick, who was following, picked it up and returned it to her. On another occasion, a parrot flew away, and Dick bravely climbed a tree to rescue it. Miss Alice was grateful for his help. Despite the ill-tempered cook's teasing, Dick's kindness shone through.

"Once upon a time, there was a kind and beautiful girl loved by all, known as Little Red Riding-Hood. One day, her mother asked her to take a basket of goodies to her sick grandmother.

One night, I climbed a tree and heard drums and trumpets again. The next day, men from King Mihrage's court landed and were surprised to see me. They explained the island belonged to genii who let the king train his horses there. They were there to choose some horses. Others arrived and recognized me. The captain returned the bales I had lost. I gave a gift to the king, received a rich present in return, and made good purchases. After selling my goods in Balsora, I made a profit.

After forgetting my past dangers, I funded a ship, loaded it with goods, and sailed with other traders. Caught in a storm, we landed on a deserted island seeking water. There, we found a roc's egg as large as the one I'd seen before. Despite my warning, the crew opened it, cooked the young roc, and were surprised by the two adult birds. We fled on our ship, but the birds attacked, causing a piece of stone to hit the ship. I held onto wreckage, reaching a steep island with fruit and water. I met an old man who rode on my back, making me gather fruit. One day, I made wine from a gourd and the man drank it, dying. Rescued by a ship, I learned I escaped the Old Man of the Sea. I later gathered coconuts and returned home after earning well.|"[""1.
