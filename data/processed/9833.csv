Many scouts claimed I was removed from the Tom Slade Series, leading me to join the Roy Blakeley Series. Then, they said I was ousted from there too. They suggested I start my own series and enlist the author of Tom Slade's adventures. Despite warnings of potential removal from this series, it seems illogical since how can someone central to a series oust themselves? I challenge anyone to remove me from this series. Perhaps I'll end up as the sole character, but that's fine as it means more food for me. Roy Blakeley's advice to write close to the paper seems absurd. My adventures during summer vacation with my uncle will unfold in the first story, with more tales to follow. From a mistaken automobile choice to starting the Pollywog Patrol, my stories get wilder. With a hundred and fifty-two adventures planned, I'll keep writing even if I run out of paper, as scouts can write on birch bark.|"[""1.

Pee-wee Harris, the Raven Patrol mascot from First Bridgeboro Troop, sat on a tree limb in front of his house, enjoying a banana.

By the dim light of a lantern, Pepsy struggled to clean up spilled kerosene. Despite her efforts, the oily mess clung to her shoes and hands. Undeterred, she set out with her companions, the lantern and Wiggle. As they trudged down the dark road, Pepsy discarded the drenched rags near a well. When they reached Mr. Jensen's house, Pepsy, smelling of kerosene, bravely asked for a favor. She reminded Mr. Jensen of her past kindness and asked him to have the County Fair in Berryville to help her friend Pee-wee's business. Mr. Jensen, touched by her determination, praised her as a little heroine and explained why he couldn't change the fair's location.

Pepsy's head throbbed, her face burning, and her ears ringing. Feeling feverish and disoriented, she believed everyone was against her because of the bridge. Dizzy, she leaned on a rock for support, her hand trembling. Despite the darkness, she stumbled through the woods, the trees appearing to move. Finally, she found her way to a familiar path, running in a frenzy, driven by a fever-induced resolve to silence the haunting voice. Emerging onto the highway, she saw the bridge with a bright spot and smoke. A figure crawled away, appearing to have multiple arms to her feverish mind.

Pepsy had a fever all night, but Aunt Jamsiah, watching over her, later informed Pee-wee that she just needed rest. Pee-wee refrained from asking about the events of the night she was found at the burning bridge. Aunt Jamsiah seemed to handle the matter for further discussion. Meanwhile, Pee-wee went back to the spot of their failed venture. The refreshment stand only had a few items left, with Pepsy notably absent. As Pee-wee worked on a willow whistle, he soaked the bark in water. Suddenly, the sound of an approaching car was heard, bringing excitement. The roadside stand was now ready with cold ice cream and hot sausages. The arrival of the car meant a potential rush for snacks, and Pee-wee eagerly prepared to serve the customers.|"[""1.

Hungry scouts emerged from the car, craving hot dogs and doughnuts. Their motto, ""Be Prepared,"" echoed in the air, and Pee-wee realized the scouts were counting on him for snacks.

A scout group was discussing the challenges of shortages when one scout mentioned the importance of scout signs in the woods. Pee-wee interrupted with a story about eating too much food during a reconstruction period when supplies were scarce. As more cars started passing by his house, Pee-wee realized that Everdoze, the quiet hamlet he lived in, was suddenly becoming popular due to a new road sign. The once secluded area was now bustling with cars, leaving the local birds unsettled. The influx of visitors raised questions about who or what caused this sudden change.

Perhaps there is a little god of good turns after all, unseen but administering punches in the nose and repaying gifts. As Pee-wee neared the fire scene, a torn clothing fragment in the bushes caught his eye. Trampled bushes led him to a disordered path, suggesting a crawling or dragging person. Pee-wee noticed brown sticky marks, indicating stealthy movement. He examined the trampled brush carefully, realizing a prone, dead weight had crushed it. Strands of grass suggested a helpless weight had been pulled. The trampled path led to a small shack near an old bridge, once used by boys for diving. Inside, a human figure lay motionless, with wet hair, torn clothes, and a leg in an unnatural position. The eyes stared at fishing rods above, frozen in a haunting stillness.|"[""1.
