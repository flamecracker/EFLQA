Fremont, relieved he followed his friend's advice to leave the city, awaited Nestor's return. Suddenly, a familiar arm appeared at his door, bearing the Black Bear Patrol badge of the Boy Scouts. It was his friend, Frank Shaw, bringing joy and relief. The two friends embraced like black bears, overjoyed at the reunion. Frank shared his failed attempt to enlist due to being deemed too short and fat. Fremont confided in Frank about the police pursuit and the suspicion of someone tracking their movements. The mystery deepened, leaving them pondering their next move.|"['1.

One boy declared he would fight and write to his father to prove innocence. The other warned of the police's pursuit for a reward and advised fleeing.

"""I don't want to drum,"" said the boy firmly. ""I want to go to Mexico and live in the mountains. If you have any money, give it to me. I'm so hungry I could eat the Statue of Liberty."" Frank interrupted, ""We need to get out of here. I'll help Fremont escape through the window. Then I'll circle back with food for you, Jimmie."" Frank continued, ""You stay here and pretend to be asleep. If the police come, they'll think you're the only one here. We'll all cross the Rio Grande safely."" Despite Jimmie's hunger, the boys helped him get ready and quietly left through the window into an alley. As they left, they heard a knock on the door and Jimmie pretending to snore. Fremont worried that Jimmie might get arrested, but Frank reassured him that Jimmie would find a way out and be back to meet Nestor. They walked through the quiet streets, avoiding crowded places, and found a small eatery for a meal."|['1.

As they entered the seemingly empty place, the boys were relieved to have it to themselves. However, two men with long hair and sharp eyes soon joined them, ordering little food and whispering to each other. Fremont thought he recognized one of them from the Cameron building in New York. The men approached the boys, and Fremont managed to escape, but Shaw was caught by the Mexican man. Shaw used a quick ju jitsu move to free himself. They fled, followed by the police. Near the hotel, they met Jimmie, who had been in trouble with a cop but was saved by Colonel Wingate. The boys boarded a train to San Jose, as they needed to be far from the border by morning.

Before noon the next day, the boys arrived in San Jose after a bumpy train ride. Hungry and tired, they got rooms in a small hotel, had a Mexican dinner, and rested briefly. After a siesta, they packed provisions and rowed across the lake to the foot of a mountain range. They noticed rough men with muskets heading east, causing a stir in the town. Nestor, suspicious of their motives, offered a boat ride to two men who knew little English but provided no useful information. Climbing the slope with camping gear, they discussed a man linked to a mysterious assault. Camping in a valley, they spotted smoke signals, interpreting them as messages used by Boy Scouts.|['1.

"Nestor instructed, ""When you return to New York, find Mother Scanlon."" Jimmie and Frank noticed signals on the mountain. A flame moved in arcs, signaling in a code.

The two friends lay quietly together for a while, lost in their thoughts of New York City with its bright lights and bustling streets. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise like a falling stone and quickly got up, thinking someone was approaching. Jimmie whispered that they should listen, but all they heard was a bird flying overhead. Moments later, signals flashed again. They decided to hide in a nearby gully as they sensed danger. They heard steel clashing in the darkness, making them uneasy. Although there were no more signals, they felt as though they were being watched by mysterious figures. Eventually, the intruders left, and the boys returned to their tents but couldn't sleep due to the tension. Jimmie investigated the disturbance but found Fremont's revolver and cap abandoned, indicating a struggle had taken place. Worried and frustrated, Jimmie waited in hiding, concerned about his missing friend and the unsettling events unfolding around them.|"['1.

Jimmie worried that Fremont might have been arrested and taken back to New York, jeopardizing his future. While pondering this, the sound of a drum signaled approaching soldiers. Frank, true to his word, fell asleep soon after parting ways with his friend. Upon waking, Nestor discussed the mysterious events at the Cameron building. Jimmie had mentioned the night watchman, hinting that he could have been involved. Nestor revealed finding a key near the safe, speculating it might belong to the watchman.

"""He did,"" was the reply. ""He wore a blue coat with Grand Army buttons, and one of the buttons was missing from the right sleeve when I saw him in the corridor as I passed out. He probably caught his sleeve on something in the safe and ripped the button off. He either did not notice the loss of the button or had no time to pick it up.""

""Wait a minute,"" said Nestor. ""Let me tell you what else I found there.

These were taken from the Cameron suite. What do you make of that?""

""I understand,"" Frank said. ""One of the other men was this Mexican, the man with the short right leg, the fellow who tried to geezle me at the El Paso restaurant. Well, that makes two who were there that night--two who were in front of the safe--two who had no right to be there.""

""It begins to look as if the Mexican went to the building for the purpose of robbery, and that he found a tool in Jim Scoby,"" said Frank.

Frank observed the campfire below, casting a red glow on the tents where Nestor had entered earlier. The situation seemed logical - any of the three men could have committed the crime Fremont was accused of. Two men were in the tent, and the third was expected. Frank wondered about the connection between the man in evening attire, Scoby, Felix, and the firearms schedule left in the suite. How did the attack on Cameron, the hidden mine, and the international matter relate? Nestor hinted at a secret mission, seeking peace in his country at the risk of war with theirs. The diplomat's failed attempt to buy arms led to suspicions and the missing letters from Cameron.

Jimmie hesitated, unsure of how to respond. The men could be searching for Fremont. They might have crossed the river to follow Nestor into the mountains, enticed by the reward for capturing the boy. Alternatively, if they weren't after Fremont, they could help track down those who took him. It was a tough spot for Jimmie, but he decided to wait for more information on the newcomers. The officer spoke quietly with his men, showing concern. He left two to guard the tents and went down the mountain with the other four. Jimmie pulled the drummer aside, learning that the men were sent to meet Ned. Jimmie suspected the Greasers had taken Fremont, hoping they mistook him for Nestor.

In the mountains, the boy cherished the forests and campfires, but anxiety clouded his enjoyment. Eavesdropping, he overheard guards discussing Nestor's vital role. Concerned for Fremont's safety, he contemplated escaping. Signals in the sky hinted at impending conflict. Nestor emphasized the need for secrecy to avert war and foreign entanglements.

"Tonight he'll arrive, as per reports. I suspected it might be his group signaling when I arrived, unless it was my colleagues. If he delays, I'll head back to camp. The others will start to worry about our absence. While waiting, a signal rocket shot from the east, arced in the sky, and vanished. It was followed by a blue rocket from the range's base. The camp below seemed puzzled by the fireworks, much like us. The men gathered, confused by the red and blue rockets in the sky.

After a while, the boys stopped on a rock ledge and gazed across the moonlit area around them. Nestor was hopeful, but Frank felt uneasy. They could see the group with the guide below, and as they walked confidently, Nestor awaited a signal he believed he saw. Suddenly, a light flickered in a gully to the right, prompting Nestor to respond with a bird-call so realistic that Shaw looked for the bird. More lights flashed, revealing five men approaching. After some discussion between Lieutenant Gordon and the patrol leader, they instructed Shaw to head back to camp quickly while they waited for the other group. When the group arrived, they were met with revolvers pointed at them. The lieutenant explained they were under arrest for treason and robbery. Despite protests, they were escorted back, with Nestor preoccupied with Fremont's disappearance. The drummer shared how he was aided by his friends and mentioned a Boy Scout troop in the area called the Owl, hinting at a possible encounter.|"['1.

Two boys, Jimmie and the drummer, decided to sneak out of camp under the moonlit night to explore. They admired the beautiful valley below but discussed the challenges faced by the people living there. Jimmie mentioned the history of invaders coming from the North, possibly due to changes in the earth's orbit during the Glacial period. The drummer added that the people of Mexico compared favorably with others despite their challenging past. They pondered the origin of the people in the region, noting the lack of written records. The boys marveled at the ancient skeletons of animals found in the North and discussed the migration patterns that might have led people to settle in California, Mexico, and Central America.|['1.

In ancient times, the Toltecs settled in the valley where Mexico City stands today. They were known for their peaceful ways and artistic skills, keeping records in hieroglyphics. The Toltecs were advanced, with knowledge of stars and eclipses, and they built magnificent cities. Their calendar had 18 months of 20 days each, with the remaining days added randomly. The Aztecs, fierce and brutal, later displaced the Toltecs. They were cultured but ruthless, sacrificing thousands yearly. When the Spanish conquistador Cortes arrived in the 1500s, a wave of bloodshed followed. The Spaniards mercilessly killed Aztecs and tortured priests for gold. This history influences modern Mexican culture, seen in practices like bullfighting. While some Mexicans are refined, many remain tied to their primitive roots, displaying traits of selfishness and cruelty.|"['1.

Multiple uprisings instigated by corrupt leaders have ravaged the nation. Mexico's volatile populace, akin to its seismic landscape, erupts unexpectedly, defying conventional patterns. The country harbors potential, with its mineral-rich hills and fertile valleys, poised to bloom into a global paradise. However, a shift towards diligence and away from distractions like bullfights and excessive drinking is imperative. Amidst a conversation among rough locals and a menacing Englishman holding George Fremont captive, Jimmie resolves to stay undercover and signal for help discreetly. Despite the imminent danger, he vows to thwart any harm to Fremont. As the drummer descends to fetch aid, Jimmie remains vigilant, prepared to act swiftly to protect his friend. The night fades, giving way to a tense dawn as Jimmie awaits his chance to intervene.|"['1.

The soldiers, who seemed rough and unfriendly, spoke quickly in a language that didn't sound like Spanish. They seemed agitated until their leader's deep voice hushed them. Jimmie couldn't grasp why the prisoner was there. If they wanted to free him, it would be quick. If they intended harm, why wait? Hours had passed since the capture, and it wouldn't take long to realize the mistake. If the big man was a Texas officer with a warrant for Fremont, they'd rush him across the border. This worried Jimmie the most. The leader's next words revealed Fremont was in danger but held by those who didn't follow the law. This gave Jimmie hope for a rescue. The leader thought Fremont was Nestor, captured by mistake. Fremont decided to keep his identity secret to buy time and ensure Nestor could save him. The big man threatened Fremont, accusing him of taking important papers. Fremont stayed silent, showing determination despite looking exhausted.|"[""1.

The big man threatened Fremont, demanding the return of certain papers. Fremont, unaware of the papers' importance due to lack of information from Nestor, remained silent. Jimmie, hidden and ready to help, tried to signal Fremont discreetly. As the tension rose, Jimmie prepared to intervene, aiming to protect Fremont. Just as the leader was about to give a deadly order, a ragged figure emerged, causing a distraction and halting the imminent danger. The men hesitated, giving Jimmie a moment of relief.

Jimmie noticed that the renegade seemed upset when the boy's name was mentioned. The climb back up the slope was tiring. The night watchman and the Mexican wanted to know about the charges against them but were not given much information. They feared being taken back to New York before finding the hidden mine. Don Miguel stayed silent, except when he questioned the reason for the silence about the alleged crimes. The journey continued in silence under the moonlight, with the group heading towards the tents. Don Miguel seemed hopeful whenever they saw distant figures on the peaks. As they neared exhaustion, a guard challenged them, indicating a serious situation with the missing boys. The lieutenant feared they might have been captured by the men who took Fremont.|"[""1.

Nestor paused, puzzled by the disappearance of the boys and the mysterious activities in the mountains. He recognized Peter Fenton, a member of the Panther Patrol, among the missing boys. Nestor hoped they were safe together. Lieutenant Gordon suggested waiting for daylight to take action and hoped the boys would return, possibly with Fremont. Nestor agreed, emphasizing the importance of finding the boys. Don Miguel offered to help locate them through his connections, but Nestor was cautious, not wanting to risk interference with their mission. The night watchman and the Mexican listened closely, especially when the topic turned to Fremont. Nestor explained the treasonable actions involving arms and ammunition purchases, shedding light on the situation for all present.|"['1.

Nestor suspected that the arms and ammunition were intended for a plot against his country. Mr. Cameron cleverly drew out the truth about the plan. The diplomat denied the accusations, questioning how a mere child like Nestor could know such things. Nestor revealed that a junta planned to arm outlaws and send them across the Rio Grande as Mexican soldiers to provoke a war with the United States. Don Miguel, the diplomat, grew agitated at the accusations. Nestor detailed how the diplomat visited Mr. Cameron, discussed a weapons contract, and failed to retrieve compromising letters. The enraged diplomat tried to escape but was stopped. Nestor mentioned the possibility of an accomplice attacking Mr. Cameron.

After the departure of the three men from Mr. Cameron's suite, it was soon visited by others. At least two individuals entered, copying a paper from the Tolford estate envelope that described a lost mine before leaving. Later, when Fremont arrived, he found Mr. Cameron unconscious. The authorities suspected foul play and accused Jim Scoby, Felix, and Don Miguel of being involved. Don Miguel claimed he was there on legitimate business, while Jim Scoby admitted to entering with Felix to obtain the mine paper. Despite their differing stories, all three men confirmed their presence in the suite that night. While the details matched Nestor's findings, the crucial point of who harmed Mr. Cameron remained in dispute. Jim Scoby denied being there to assist the injured and hinted at Don Miguel's potential involvement.|"[""1.

Nestor observed two men arguing about a crime, each blaming the other. Don Miguel accused them of framing him for the crime. Nestor saw an opportunity to uncover the truth as tensions rose.

The journey north was winding through crags and canyons, plateaus, and perilous cliffs to avoid detection by hostile groups. Jimmie, a Boy Scout, left signs in stones for his friends. A large rock with a smaller rock on top indicated the trail's start; a stone on the left meant to turn left. He feared his friend Fenton had been captured. The renegade's group headed east towards the river, with Jimmie watching from a ledge. A rockslide startled the renegade, but it was just natural. Jimmie was surprised by the sudden appearance of his friends Shaw and Fenton. They had both got lost but coincidentally met near the camp.

The boys missed the trail and unexpectedly found each other instead of the camp. They had last met in New York, and Frank was unaware that Peter had left the city. Fortunately, they joined forces and followed Jimmie's trail after many false leads. As they discussed their next move, a growling sound startled them, making them believe it was a bear. The outlaws, armed and ready for action, were taken off guard. Meanwhile, Fremont, a member of the Black Bear Patrol, remained calm, familiar with the signal. The boys observed the outlaws' nervous reactions and decided to retreat slightly while keeping an eye on Fremont. Nestor arrived, explaining that it was their turn to rescue Fremont.

The distance to the plain below seemed short from the summit. The Sierra del Fierro peaks appear tall from the Rio Grande but not as much from the plateau. Mexico's plateaux vary from four to nine thousand feet above sea level, creating different climates. Surrounded by mountain chains, the high summits include Cofre del Perote, Origava, Istaccihuatl, and Popocatapetl. The outlaws were slowly descending the eastern slope, easier than the western side. The boys decided to wait, seeking shelter from the sun. Peter shared his knowledge of the country, mentioning the temples in Chiapas and Yucatan. The pyramid-temple of Cholulu in Mexico is massive compared to those in Egypt. The ruins at Palenque were once a grand city with various civilizations. Cortes and his group influenced the ruins left by the Toltecs and Aztecs.|"[""1.

Nestor expressed his admiration for the country but highlighted the need for population stability. He suggested resting before pursuing the outlaws camping below. Nestor emphasized the importance of caution, indicating that it was not wise to attempt a rescue or follow the outlaws in broad daylight. He mentioned misplacing a package of sandwiches. The boys followed Nestor to a sheltered spot on a rock shelf. As Shaw rushed ahead, the others heard commotion and discovered him playfully wrestling with old friends from the Black Bear Patrol. Frank was surprised to see them and inquired about food. After introductions, they all chatted excitedly.

In a remote canyon, Nestor discovered a tunnel used as a chute for discarding crushed rock from an underground mine. The canyon, hidden at the mountain's top, had been gradually filled with debris over many years. Nestor spotted a potential route down the canyon to reach their destination quickly. With the group's eagerness to rescue Fremont, they descended the heap of rocks, following a stream toward the plain below.

The pool wasn't wide or deep, and the boy was soon back on solid ground. A storm had filled a canyon depression with muddy water, causing Jimmie to fall in. Nestor remarked on their quicker journey compared to an Englishman who struggled down the hills. Nestor went to check the situation by a hut, unnoticed by a guard due to the rain and wind. As Fremont spoke with a renegade, the patrol leader listened in. Unable to figure out the motive behind the man's interest in Fremont's past, the patrol leader signaled the boys. Fremont appeared by a window, and the boys used a wolf call to communicate. Frank's bear sound signaled Fremont to escape through the window.

Doubting the loyalty of the renegade, he suspected an escape plan with the boy. Seeing Fremont and Big Bob vanish in the dark, he fired, hitting Big Bob.
