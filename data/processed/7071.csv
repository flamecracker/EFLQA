In the year 1857, the British cantonments of Sandynugghur shone brightly in the early spring. These cantonments were like suburbs, separate from the town, and included barracks, a maidan for drills, and bungalows for military and civil officers. The bungalows were charming, with rustic designs and wide verandas. The rooms were simple, with polished floors and cane or bamboo furniture. The veranda was the heart of the bungalow, where people relaxed, read, and worked. Bedrooms had attached bathrooms, and windows opened to the ground with Venetian blinds. Servants used the veranda for rest and sleep. The gardens were lush with trees and flowers due to ample water and sunlight. The story revolved around Kate Warrener, her brothers Ned and Dick, and their cousin Rose Hertford, living in Sandynugghur. They were children of the major of the One Hundred and Fifty-first Bengal Native Infantry, each with unique backgrounds and plans for the future.|"['1.

Neither his sister nor cousin responded to the offer. Two horsemen rode up to the veranda and dismounted, handing their reins to the _syces_. They brought news of wild boars near Meanwerrie, prompting plans for a pig-sticking event the next day. Major Warrener, in uniform, suggested driving the boys to the event. The girls retired indoors as the boys conversed with the _syces_ about the village's location. The major discussed unsettling rumors circulating among native troops, including mutinous behavior. He emphasized the need for vigilance and understanding to prevent further unrest. The major regretted exposing his daughters to potential danger and stressed the importance of diffusing tensions among the troops.|"[""1.

"""No, sir; I believe the regiment can be trusted; they have always been treated well and seem loyal.

"Major Warrener led a group of gentlemen on horseback equipped with boar-spears, resembling English lances but shorter. The riders wore coats, knee-breeches, and gaiters made of coarse, durable local fabric in gray or brown. They prepared to hunt wild pigs, referred to as ""pig."" Mrs. Renwick and the group joined, walking to a spot to observe the sport. Natives with dogs were stationed to drive out the pigs.

With their hats pulled tightly over their heads and their spears thrust forward about two or three feet from the ground, the hunters set off in pursuit. Some chased after the boar, others after the sow, and a few young hunters went after the squeakers. Captain Dunlop, a young ensign named Skinner, the regiment's Scottish doctor, and two civilians were among those chasing the boar. As they closed in on the boar, the young ensign on a fast Arab horse took the lead, positioning himself to the left of the boar for a strategic spear thrust. However, a sudden turn by the boar caused the ensign's horse to stumble, leading to a dangerous encounter. Captain Dunlop intervened just in time, managing to wound the boar. The sow managed to escape, but the boar met its end in a thrilling hunt.|"['1. What were the hunters pursuing in the text passage?\nA) Deer\nB) Boar\nC) Rabbits\nD) Bears\nE) Foxes', '2.

Two days later, the rebellious Nineteenth regiment was disbanded at Barrackpore. On April 3rd, Mangul Pandy, who only injured himself, was hanged. A native officer of his unit faced the same fate for refusing to command his men to help an officer attacked by Pandy and for inciting mutiny against the government. This harsh lesson did not deter further unrest. Reports of discontent spread throughout Bengal and the northwest provinces. Fires broke out in Agra and Umballah, and letters instigating revolt were intercepted. Disturbances in Lucknow led to the disarming of the Seventh Regiment by Sir Henry Lawrence. As April passed, a sense of unease and peril intensified. The looming threat felt like the calm before a storm, with uncertainty about when or how it would strike. Despite some believing the danger would pass, those with families felt deep anxiety. The British were vastly outnumbered by natives in India, leaving many feeling helpless in the face of potential upheaval. The situation seemed unsettled, yet life in Sandynugghur carried on normally. However, a sudden turn of events occurred during a pleasant evening gathering at Major Warrener's residence when a Sepoy approached, delivering dreadful news that left everyone stunned.

In just five minutes, the small group cautiously emerged from their hiding spot and crept along the wall to a side door leading outside. They quickly made their way to a cactus hedge, where they huddled under its cover before reaching a cluster of trees. As they sat among the bushes, the girls sobbed softly, while Ned and Richard remained silent, tears streaming down their faces.

Walking quickly was difficult at the base of the valley due to the darkness and scattered rocks. After a long walk, Ned led Kate and Rose through various terrains until they found shelter in a dense grove. Exhausted, they rested and had a little wine to regain strength. Upon waking, they discovered their companions had kept watch, and they planned to disguise themselves with borrowed clothes and stained faces to avoid detection. The girls washed and dressed in the new attire, ready to continue their journey. Under the cover of night, they approached a village, and after a quick scout, they decided to ride through on two horses they found, disguising themselves further.

They traveled through villages without drawing much attention, with a Mohammedan zemindar and his followers riding alongside two veiled women. After purchasing grain for their horses, they rested in a wood, pleased with their progress towards Meerut. The next day, as they entered a large village, peasants armed with sticks and guns blocked their path. In a daring move, the boys rode through the crowd, firing their revolvers. Amidst the chaos, Kate was injured in the arm, but they managed to escape. Realizing they were being pursued, they decided to press forward, knowing they might have to abandon their horses and continue on foot.

"In a short while, they arrived at the forest's edge, unable to spot the horsemen. Staying in the fields near the river's jungle-lined edge, they trekked for over an hour until they encountered a road. ""Let's follow it,"" Kate suggested. ""It leads the right way, and we'll move faster than through the fields. If we hear them, we can hide in the jungle.""""They might be seeking help or reinforcements,"" Ned speculated. ""Keep moving; we have time."" They swiftly boarded a boat as cavalry passed by. Despite rowing efforts, the strong current thwarted their progress.

The farmer, a kind soul, offered his help to the English boys, sheltering them in an old shed to keep them safe from danger. His wife and daughter tended to the sick English lady, Rose, with care and compassion. The farmer's wisdom and quick thinking ensured the boys' safety and the well-being of the injured woman. He devised a plan to deceive his servants, making them believe that his daughter was the one in need of care, thus keeping the secret of the English visitors hidden. The boys, grateful for the farmer's assistance, settled into the shed, making a comfortable bed from the fodder stored inside. With the farmer's reassurance that he would keep them updated on any news, the boys felt a sense of relief and security in their temporary hiding place.|"['1.

It will be weeks before Rose can walk again, and I will have an anxious time with her. It would add greatly to my worry if you were near, and might at any time be captured and killed. If papa has escaped, he will be in a terrible state of anxiety about us. You could relieve him if you join him at Meerut, and tell him how kindly we are treated here. Altogether, boys, it would be better for you to go; for if the Sepoys come, you could not defend us against more than two or three, and they are sure to come in a stronger party. In spite of their reluctance to leave the girls without protection, the boys saw that following the advice was best. The Hindoo friend suggested they dress as Hindoo peons to attract less attention. They stained themselves deep brown, shaved their heads, and donned a loincloth and turban. They were assured they would not raise suspicion. Their pistols were slung behind them, and they carried supplies in bags. With a farewell to their friend, they embarked on their journey, walking all day and into the night. They avoided villages and met natives in silence. The biscuits lasted for two days, and they sought more food cautiously.

"At noon, they sat, lit a fire, and cooked rice. Ned, bending to pick a stick, heard ""Look out!"" from Dick. A cobra, hood up, ready to strike, was near. Dick swiftly hit its head, killing it. Dick advised sucking the wound, cutting it, and using gunpowder to prevent venom effects. Rice was their meal. They aimed to reach Meerut in two days, walking 25 miles daily. They heard distant drumbeats. Riding officers led a regiment. They raced back for rice and a lota. Hiding near the road, they saw the regiment. If officers were white, it was safe; if not, mutineers. The column passed, and they pondered being the last whites in India. They believed England would send help. Two officers passed, unclear if they were white."|"[""1.

"""No, Ned, I am certain they are not white; they must be mutineers. Look! Look! They have three prisoners.

Every small aspect of the plan was discussed and organized. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the boys cooked rice over a fire in a ravine, eating with lighter hearts knowing their father had escaped danger. The peril of their upcoming journey was brushed aside by their carefree attitudes. Across the plain, campfires flickered, eventually fading into the night. The silence enveloped them until they estimated it was around ten o'clock. The chilly night favored their mission, as the natives would likely stay put in their tents. The moon cast a bright glow, aiding their movements. The boys noticed distant cannon fire, possibly a salute to a chief in Delhi. They waited, then one of them slipped into an Indian tent, gathering uniforms and gear unnoticed. They swiftly retreated to a cluster of trees, disguising themselves before heading back towards the camp. Under the cloak of darkness, a stealthy attack unfolded, catching the sentry off guard and resulting in a swift, silent demise.|"['1.

The native cautiously slipped behind the tent, cutting a slit in the canvas to enter quietly. Kneeling beside a sleeping man, he woke him gently to share news of safety.

The river is quite wide, especially during the rainy season when it fills up to the brim, stretching at least half a mile. At other times, the stream narrows to about half that width. After crossing the river, they would still have fifteen miles to travel to reach Meerut. It was likely that the entire area was under the control of the Sepoys. The group decided to cross the river after dark. If they couldn't find a boat, they planned to use bundles of rushes as floatation devices to carry their guns and ammunition while swimming across in the darkness. They took shelter under trees to rest until the afternoon, preparing to build a raft after sunset.

Nothing had been mentioned about the plan to bring back the runaways, as local spies might have leaked the information to the rebels, prompting a search for their hideout. On the tenth day, the men were surprised when told to prepare for an evening duty parade. Each was to carry a blanket, haversack with food for four days, and twenty pounds of horse feed. The journey was expected to take two nights, but a detour was needed to avoid detection. The squadron, led by Major Warrener and Captain Kent, set out from Meerut at sunset. They rode through the night, passing villages quietly. By morning on the third day, they rested in a grove, about fifteen miles from where the girls were left. The men slept, except for sentries.

Major Warrener and his sons expressed gratitude to the old peasant and his family for their help. The major gave the farmer money to cover his losses and promised that England would reward his loyalty. They bid farewell and mentioned that the ladies they had helped would return to thank him.

Major Warrener and his second disguised themselves in native clothes to scout the fortress. They found it challenging to attack due to its defenses and the large garrison.

During the Sepoy uprising in India, the British faced a dire situation. With the rebels controlling Delhi and most of Northern India, British garrisons were isolated and in need of urgent assistance. The loyalty of Sikh chieftains like the Rajah of Puttiala played a crucial role in supporting the British cause. As the British forces mobilized to confront the rebels, the first encounter at Ghazee-ud-deen-Nugghur marked a turning point. Despite being outnumbered, the British troops, driven by a thirst for vengeance, fought with unwavering determination. The victory at Ghazee-ud-deen-Nugghur instilled fear in the mutineers and set the stage for the eventual siege of Delhi. The British forces, led by Sir H.

The British troops marched from Alipore at dawn to take over Delhi. The British flag on the Ridge signaled their arrival, causing anxiety in the city. The flag symbolized British rule, which the rebels aimed to overthrow. As the city awaited reinforcements from England, both sides understood the significance of the flag's presence. The siege of Delhi was a test of endurance for the British forces against a larger, well-equipped enemy. The arrival of the Guides provided a much-needed boost in strength. The Ridge offered a strategic view of Delhi's mosques, tombs, and fortifications. The Jumma Musjid mosque and the king's palace were prominent landmarks visible from the Ridge. The city's gates, like the Cashmere gate, were key points for potential storming by British forces. The flat land to the river provided a route for the mutineers, who faced losses from British artillery.|"[""1.

At eight o'clock, a large group of men approached the village. When they got close enough, they fired their long matchlocks at the walls with loud shouts and gestures. Major Warrener ordered his men not to shoot back to keep the attackers unaware of the Enfield carbine's long range. Captain Dunlop explained to young Warrener that they were about to witness native artillery practice, which was different from the trained artillerymen. The attackers, riding elephants, positioned themselves on a nearby rising ground. Meanwhile, the defenders of the village gathered behind the two-feet thick wall with loopholes for shooting. Major Warrener directed his best shooters to take positions in towers and loopholes. As the attackers prepared their guns, Major Warrener ordered his men to aim at the chief elephants' howdahs and fire a volley.

Captain Dunlop informed the garrison that the enemy had been sickened by the previous volleys and were unlikely to act until it cooled down. The captain anticipated giving them a stronger volley. Fifty carbines were fired, causing chaos among the elephants and footmen. The garrison was then told to lie low until needed again. Later, a new group of elephants with guns arrived and set up camp near the village. They bombarded the village with gunfire, causing havoc. The garrison responded by firing back with sporting rifles, targeting the enemy artillery. The men were strategically positioned, with some building defenses at the gate. As the battle intensified, the gate was damaged, and a plan was devised to blow it up. The garrison was organized into different groups with specific tasks to defend the village.|"[""1.

After walking for ten minutes, they reached a point where a side road intersected. Opting for this path, they continued on, passing a few villages illuminated by the moonlight. To avoid detection by the local dogs and inhabitants, they made a detour around the villages. Their aim was to find shelter in a secluded dwelling. As dawn approached, they spotted a large building, likely belonging to a person of importance. Unfortified but surrounded by high walls, it seemed like a safe haven. They decided to climb over the wall using nearby trees for cover. Once inside the garden, filled with pavilions and fountains, they found a hiding spot among the bushes and flowering shrubs. As they rested, the conversation turned to the political climate, with the elder woman expressing concerns about the rebellion. The boys, grateful for the lady's kindness, assured her of England's strength and impending support. The woman's advisor, Ahrab, suggested a plan to disguise the boys and secure their safety. Later, under the cover of darkness, they were provided with provisions and clothing by the kind lady and her confidante.|"['1.

"The queen then signaled for them to sit on cushions nearby. ""It's too hot, and you're just boys,"" she said to Ahrab before unveiling. ""You'd pass as pretty girls if you weren't so pale."" Ahrab insisted they couldn't leave them behind. They were heading to Cawnpore the next day, and the boys must come along.

Nana Sahib, born in 1825, was adopted by the Peishwa at a young age. The Peishwa, once a powerful prince, was dethroned by the British but treated honorably. When the Peishwa passed away in 1851, Nana Sahib was denied the annuity, causing unrest among Indian princes who had adopted heirs. Nana Sahib initially appeared friendly to the British, but during the Indian Mutiny, he revealed his true intentions. The residents of Cawnpore faced hardships even before the mutiny began. The mutineers, under Nana Sahib's command, attacked Cawnpore, leading to a brutal siege. The besieged suffered from lack of water, constant bombardment, and fires.

In the city, a time of fear ruled. The native Christians were all killed, along with their families, and every white captive brought before the Nana was ordered to be killed. The suffering of those in the fort increased daily, especially among the women and children. The Nana's army grew each day, while the garrison's fighting force decreased. Despite the odds, the Englishmen defended the fort against the large enemy force. The Nana offered a deal for the English to surrender, promising safe passage.

The brothers swiftly jumped into the water, dodging bullets as they swam to the middle of the stream. Despite the Sepoys' gunfire, they remained unscathed. Floating on their backs, barely showing their noses and mouths above water, they evaded detection. As expert swimmers, they maneuvered downstream, avoiding the enemy's sight. Hours passed as they silently floated, occasionally swimming to maintain their course. By dawn, they reached the riverbank, resting in the jungle. Hungry and wary, they continued their journey, putting miles between them and Cawnpore. Seeking refuge in a peasant's hut, they received food and shelter before resuming their cautious trek under the cover of night.

The peasant offered the boys food and directed them to the rajah's house, a half-hour walk away. The rajah, a friend of the Englishmen, welcomed them warmly. Lieutenant Delafosse, a survivor from Cawnpore, shared his escape story with the boys. He described how they defended against the enemy, escaped a burning boat, and finally found refuge with the rajah. The boys, now refreshed and determined, planned to reach Allahabad to reunite with their father. The rajah provided them with native attire, a guide, and a cart for their journey. They were warned of Nana Sahib's troops and decided to press on, covering fifteen miles before nightfall. The villagers shared news of an advancing English force near Synee, boosting hopes of British victory.

"""English,"" he said. The boys looked out, and gave a shout of joy as they saw the well-known uniforms; and, regardless of their women's robes, they leaped out and ran to meet them. The advanced guard of the cavalry stopped in surprise.

The young Warreners had been mourned as dead, for no one doubted that they had been carried to Cawnpore, and had shared the fate of the garrison of that place; and the joy of their father therefore was intense, while the whole corps, with whom the boys were general favorites, were delighted.

""Then we can ride back at once,"" Major Warrener said. ""Major Renaud was on the point of marching when we started, and he will be glad to have us back again. First, though, what have these natives done for you?""

The major made them a handsome present, and sent a message to the zemindar, to the effect that his kindness would be reported to government; and Dick scribbled a few words to Lieutenant Delafosse, with the news of the British advance, and a kind message to the rajah.

The boys were taken to Major Renaud by their father, who greeted them warmly. Major Renaud commanded four hundred British troops and four hundred and twenty native troops with two cannons. After meeting Major Renaud, the boys went to their assigned tents. Major Warrener invited officers and volunteers to hear about the Cawnpore massacre, which stirred anger and a desire for revenge. The news spread, and the troops prepared to advance. General Havelock arrived with his forces, including the Warreners. The general praised the boys' courage and asked them to be his gallopers. General Havelock's total force included British regular troops and native regiments. The troops halted for breakfast but were surprised by enemy cavalry, prompting them to prepare for battle.

The battle swiftly turned in favor of the British as soon as it began. The British artillery outmatched the enemy's, while their rifles pushed back the infantry. The cavalry flanked, the infantry marched ahead, and the guns were dragged through the swamps. As the British advanced, the enemy retreated, leaving behind their guns. A well-aimed shot by Captain Maude even knocked down the enemy general's elephant. The rebels fled to Futtehpore, where they attempted to make a stand but were quickly overwhelmed by the British troops. Despite the victory, the troops were exhausted and had to rest. The discovery of English attire among the defeated rebels further fueled the troops' anger. The next day, the force advanced, encountering abandoned weapons and supplies.

The troops advanced towards the Pandoo bridge. As the artillery led the way, they were met with enemy fire. The enemy's heavy guns were accurate, causing chaos among the British guns and men. Captain Maude strategically positioned the guns for a counterattack. The Madras Fusiliers surprised the enemy with their Enfield fire. The artillery retaliated with shrapnel, silencing the enemy's guns. The infantry charged, forcing the enemy to retreat. General Havelock requested reinforcements from General Neil in Allahabad. The troops, despite the scorching heat, executed a flank movement to attack the enemy. The Highlanders bravely assaulted the enemy, capturing strategic positions. After a long battle, the British emerged victorious, reaching Cawnpore. The next morning, they discovered the gruesome aftermath of the massacre at the Subada Khotee.

On the 15th afternoon, news of the defeat at Futtehpore reached Nana, who then ordered a massacre of the prisoners. Among them were survivors from Cawnpore and refugees from Futteyghur. The soldiers, upon seeing the gruesome scene, were deeply affected. The Warreners, upon reaching Cawnpore, sought out the ranee's house, only to find it abandoned. They later met the ranee, who had shown kindness to English fugitives. General Havelock arrived in Cawnpore and restored order, hanging identified Sepoys.

When the boys returned to Colonel Warrener's tent, they found their friends Captains Dunlop and Manners, along with a few officers familiar with native customs, and all the necessary items for disguises. First, the boys enjoyed a hearty meal. Then, they were cleansed with iodine and dressed in bloody Sepoy uniforms, with Ned's arm bandaged and in a sling, and Dick's head and face wrapped up. They were also given native plaster and bandages in case their disguises were inspected. The boys had caste marks painted on their foreheads and were barefooted like Sepoys. Outside, six horses awaited them. The group set off, riding for half an hour to reach a concealed boat. After saying farewell, they embarked on their journey towards Lucknow. They passed villages unnoticed and rested in a wood before continuing their covert journey, avoiding the main road where rebels were stationed.

Preparations for an inevitable struggle were made at the Residency in Lucknow. Earthworks connected the houses forming the square, with sandbag and fascine breastworks surrounding them. Provisions and cattle were stored for a prolonged defense. The cantonments housed regiments like the Thirteenth, Forty-eighth, and Seventy-first Native Infantry and Seventh Native Cavalry, along with Her Majesty's Twenty-second Regiment and European artillery. The revolt erupted on the evening of May 30th, starting with the Seventy-first and spreading to other regiments, leading to officer casualties. Sir Henry Lawrence, with troops and loyal regiments, quelled the mutiny. The British faced insurgents at Chinhut, suffering losses but returning to the Residency. The Mutchee Bawn was evacuated, and the British consolidated defenses. The Residency, with its unique defenses and strategic location, became the focal point of the siege, with Lucknow remaining tense until the storm finally broke on the last day of June.|['1.

Near the brigade messhouse stood the Sikh Squares, with sandbag parapets on their roofs. Mr. Gubbins' house, defended by stockades and Gubbins' Battery, was at the western point. Along the northwestern side were yards, a racket-court, sheep-pens, and more. Ommaney's house, behind, was protected by a ditch and artillery. A mortar battery was north of the slaughter-house. The church, now a granary, had a mortar battery in its yard. Lieutenant Innis' house was tough to defend. The Redan Battery at the north point was strong. The hospital, Dr. Fayrer's house, and the Bailey Guard were strategically located. The Residency, surrounded by gardens, offered a view of the city. The ladies' house housed officers' families and served as a commissariat store. The Residency was a town around the Resident's dwelling, housing over a thousand women and children during the siege. Sir Henry Lawrence was fatally wounded by a shell in his room. Colonel Inglis took command after his death. The enemy intensified their attacks, making it challenging for emissaries to enter or leave the Residency.|"[""1.

Here, they faced obstacles again. Fires were lit, and guards were posted to stop anyone from passing except those with official business. A group carrying shells for the batteries on the other side of the river approached. They were from the king's magazine, a quarter mile away. The bridge was close to the Redan battery, and they needed to cross before daylight under fire. The boys and their guide decided to dive across the river to avoid the sentries. They stripped off their uniforms, surprised and overpowered a sentry, and swiftly made their way across the river. They were welcomed by British soldiers on the other side, who cheered their daring escape. The boys cautioned against raising false hopes among the residents at the Residency until they had spoken to Colonel Inglis. They were escorted to the Colonel's room, where he awaited their arrival, prepared for action.|"['1.

Colonel Inglis greeted the messengers warmly, expressing his gratitude for their arrival. The messengers, Ned and his brother, shared news that General Havelock's forces were unable to advance to Lucknow due to limited manpower. Although reinforcements were awaited, it might take a month before they could reach the garrison.

As dawn broke, Ned and Dick concluded recounting Havelock's advance, the tragic events at Cawnpore, uprisings in India, the ongoing siege of Delhi, and the arrival of reinforcements. The cannon roared, and shots crashed into the Residency. The Warrener brothers were assigned to Gubbins' house, amidst constant danger. Swarms of flies and foul smells filled the air. Captain Fellows guided them to safety. Mr. Gubbins welcomed them warmly, acknowledging their bravery. The room was small and dark, but the Warreners found a place to rest.

Mr. Johnson praised a noble woman who worked tirelessly at the military hospital amidst dreadful scenes. Despite the chaos, her family managed to maintain a sense of order and comfort. The young girls helped care for sick children, showcasing heroism and selflessness. Amidst the turmoil, a shell caused panic, highlighting the constant danger. The garrison, including the Warreners, toiled through the night repairing defenses under enemy fire. The night was exhausting, with bullets whizzing overhead. The Warreners then stood guard, armed and ready for any attack. An alarm sounded, and they repelled a fierce assault, with the enemy ultimately retreating.

During the siege of Lucknow, the garrison faced a relentless attack not just from enemy forces but also from swarms of flies. The intense heat, lack of sleep, and constant irritation from flies made life unbearable for the defenders. Despite efforts to combat the flies with powder, the nuisance persisted. The day took a tragic turn when shells hit Gubbins' garrison, causing casualties among the occupants. The Warreners, seeking a way to disable the enemy's battery, devised a plan to sneak out at night and render the guns useless.

Let's plan the mission carefully. There used to be a clear lane near the corner before the houses were destroyed. We'll head there as it's less cluttered and we can avoid making noise by knocking over stones. We'll wait for a time when there's noise elsewhere to cover any sounds we make. Mrs. Hargreaves will provide us with sponge pieces without knowing why we need them. Tonight seems like a good opportunity since Johnson is on guard duty and is more lenient. As night fell, a group set out from Gubbins' house towards the churchyard. They were joined by others, making a solemn procession to bury the victims of the day. Despite the danger of enemy fire, they carried out the burials with respect and care. The chaplain led the service, showing bravery in the face of danger. The mourners laid the deceased to rest side by side in a prepared trench. The mission to silence the damaging battery was a secret, known only to a few. If successful, it could save many lives.|"['1.

The boys cautiously navigated the rough terrain until they reached the lane, moving silently to avoid detection. Despite the guns being silent, musketry fire from the houses continued, guiding the boys towards the hidden cannons.

The boys quickly left and hurried back, running down toward the fortification. As they approached, Ned whistled twice, and hands reached down to help them over. Ned informed Mr. Johnson that the guns were defenseless and lightly guarded. Infantry from both sides would be drawn away for an attack from Johannes' house. Mr. Gubbins, surprised by the boys' actions, commended their bravery. Without delay, he instructed a plan of action to seize the guns and spike them.

Our men were determined and seized the opportunity to advance. Some engineers, always vigilant, brought barrels of powder to push back the enemy. The houses that sheltered enemy sharpshooters were blown up. Gubbins' house was in ruins, its occupants relocated for safety. The Residency was also damaged, its inhabitants seeking refuge underground. The British forces, including the Warreners, were glad to be part of a sortie on August 20th. They charged towards Johannes' house, a troublesome spot during the siege. A fierce fight ensued as they entered the enemy's territory, with the Warreners fighting valiantly. Amidst the chaos, Mr. Johnson and Ned were attacked by a dervish and his bear. In a daring move, Dick saved them by defeating the assailants. Despite the explosion that followed, the Warreners stood their ground, ready to face whatever came next.|"['1. What did the engineers bring to push back the enemy?\nA. Rifles\nB.

Upon hearing the enemy's yells, Dick knew escape was futile. He swiftly moved Ned and Mr. Johnson's body to safety in the cellar where the fakir and bear had fallen. Dick concealed the bodies and devised a plan to disguise themselves using the fakir's hair and rags. Despite the unpleasant task, he skinned the bear and cleaned the hide. After concealing the bodies, they rested. Upon waking, Ned was disoriented but willing to cooperate. He donned the fakir's rags and hair to blend in with the surroundings. Although disgusted, they knew their survival depended on it. With the town unsafe, they needed a plan to escape undetected.

Two young adventurers, Dick and Ned, disguised themselves as a fakir and a bear to travel safely through enemy territory. The duo decided to walk at night to avoid detection and seek help from villagers during the day. Ned, pretending to be a holy man, received food and cloth from the villagers by performing rituals. The pair continued their journey, with Dick wearing the bear skin during the day. They rested briefly in a village, where Ned helped a sick child with a fever. The villagers provided them with food, and the boys resumed their journey at night, with Dick disguising himself in native clothing.

The boys had a challenging journey, covering a hundred and eleven miles in three nights, nearing the town of Ferruckabad. They followed their strategy, entering the town after dark and receiving food offerings from the faithful. Ned, disguised as a fakir, encountered a confrontation but skillfully defended himself. The locals mistook him for a holy man and offered food, allowing the boys to continue their journey. Despite a setback when Dick injured his foot, they arrived near Delhi after thirteen days, approaching the British camp from the rear. The British had recently defeated a larger force, showcasing how even a small determined group can put up a fierce fight.

After crossing the Oude frontier, Dick abandoned his bear's skin and donned the attire of a local peasant, wearing a blue cloth and a white turban provided by Ned. Traveling only at night under cover, Dick managed to avoid detection due to his changed appearance. When they met an officer, he was thrilled to see them and informed them that news of their safe arrival had reached them through various sources. The boys shared their harrowing journey from Lucknow to Delhi, highlighting the dire situation in Lucknow with the mines being driven by the enemy. General Wilson was grateful for their insights and immediately sent a summary of their report to the central government and General Havelock.

At dinner that evening, the Warreners met General Nicholson, a brave leader compared to Outram. Short of staff, he wanted the Warreners on his team without weakening his regiments. General Wilson agreed. The Warreners were free until the siege started. They shared their Lucknow siege story with all regiments, becoming heroes. The officers admired their modesty. The troops worked day and night in trenches and batteries. On September 8th, the battery near Delhi's Moree gate fired the first shot. The enemies, once confident, now doubted their success. Strife and pestilence plagued the city. The king, powerless, sought peace with the British. The siege began on September 8th. The besiegers worked tirelessly, building batteries close to the walls as the enemy watched apathetically.|"['1.

The enemy fiercely fought back against us. Despite our overwhelming fire, their guns positioned on our flank and the walls continued to attack us with musketry fire and rockets. However, our gunners persisted, gradually breaking down the massive walls. On the 13th, significant breaches were made in the Cashmere and Water bastions. That night, engineer officers Medley, Long, Greathead, and Home scouted the breaches, confirming they were accessible. Orders were given for the assault at daybreak. The assaulting force was divided into four columns, each assigned to storm different points of the city's defenses. At four o'clock on the 14th, the assault began with a tremendous cheer as our troops breached the walls and entered the city, facing intense resistance but ultimately achieving success.|"[""1.

During the brave capture of the city, only two Englishmen survived to receive the Victoria Cross for their valor. General Wilson awarded the cross posthumously to the other fallen soldiers. General Nicholson led the troops to victory, taking control of the north wall. However, the enemy's strong resistance forced a retreat. The fighting continued, with the British troops advancing from house to house. The rebels were eventually overcome, with many fleeing in the face of the British onslaught. Despite the intense battle, the British soldiers showed restraint and did not harm innocent women. The rebels who were captured were swiftly dealt with, while the rest were allowed to leave the city unharmed.

Until the 20th, the palace resisted the British troops. The palace was like a fortress with cannons on its walls and surrounded by an open area. Engineers started digging a trench to set up a battery near the Lahore gate. However, soldiers from the Sixty-first Regiment, along with Sikhs and Ghoorkas, bravely advanced and fired at the gate. Seeing the weak response from inside, Colonel Jones decided to blow open the gate. Lieutenant Home led the charge, and the British forces entered the palace. They found guns ready to fire but abandoned by the Sepoys. The news of the palace's capture spread, leading to a frenzy of looting. Despite orders against looting, soldiers and locals seized valuable items at low prices. The British flag was raised at the palace, marking the end of the Indian mutiny. Rebel numbers dwindled, and native princes pledged allegiance to the British.|"['1.

This is where old Delhi once stood, with grand buildings that are the tombs of kings and great men. The smaller houses have turned to dust long ago, but these massive structures will endure for many more centuries. When you see the Kotub Minar, you'll be amazed. It's a huge tower that tapers at the top, built in different stages, each with unique features. The height, strength, and beauty of this monument are truly remarkable.

The troop quickly surrounded the building and dismounted. Soldiers were stationed at all doors with strict orders to prevent anyone from leaving. Captain Hodgson sent a loyal messenger inside to demand the surrender of the rebellious princes. A heated debate ensued inside, but after two hours, two sons and a grandson of the king surrendered. They were taken into custody, and the group proceeded to the tomb enclosure. Thousands of armed individuals gathered, ready to resist. However, as the troop approached, the mob's courage waned, and they surrendered their weapons. Over a thousand guns and many swords were collected. Captain Hodgson then rode towards Delhi with the boys, where a hostile mob surrounded a carriage. Hodgson swiftly dealt with the prisoners inside the carriage, who were responsible for rebellion and atrocities. The British flag was raised in Delhi, and General Havelock marched towards Lucknow, facing tough opposition but ultimately securing the Alumbagh. Despite significant losses, they managed to reach the Residency just in time to prevent a disaster.

One noble act connected with the relief of Lucknow remains unforgettable. General Sir James Outram, despite being the senior officer, selflessly allowed General Havelock to lead the mission to rescue Lucknow. Outram's generous gesture of fighting under Havelock as a volunteer exemplifies true selflessness. The news of Lucknow's relief brought immense joy to the troops at Delhi, especially for the Warreners who had worried about their friends in Lucknow. The Warreners joined Colonel Greathead's column, marching towards Agra and then Cawnpore to prepare for the advance to Lucknow. Despite facing rebel forces and skirmishes, the column successfully reached Cawnpore. Ned rejoined his regiment, while Dick eagerly joined the naval brigade. The arrival of reinforcements, including sailors led by Captain Peel, boosted the brigade's strength as they prepared to advance towards Alumbagh.

One day, the Warreners were exploring the town, venturing into the lower-class neighborhoods. As they strolled, Ned expressed concern about the hostile locals and the possibility of a dangerous encounter. Suddenly, the brothers encountered a commotion where British sailors were outnumbered by aggressive natives. Without hesitation, the Warreners rushed to their aid, wielding swords to fend off the attackers. The sailors, relieved by the reinforcement, rallied together and charged towards safety in a nearby house. With a coordinated effort, they managed to escape the violent mob and barricade themselves inside.

During the Indian Mutiny, a significant defeat for the British troops occurred at Cawnpore. The British forces, stationed strategically to control the city and the vital river access, faced a mutinous Gwalior contingent approaching from the opposite side. The British general decided to split his forces, leaving some to guard the intrenchments while engaging the rebels in battle. Unfortunately, the British troops were forced to retreat after advancing too far from the city, resulting in a chaotic withdrawal where valuable supplies fell into enemy hands. Despite a brave defense, the British forces were outmaneuvered, and the city of Cawnpore suffered significant losses. One heroic action during the retreat involved a daring night mission to recover a fallen gun. Ultimately, the British forces regrouped and managed to repel the mutineers in subsequent engagements, but the initial defeat at Cawnpore was a costly and humbling experience.|['1.

During the British victory march past the city, Sir Colin Campbell led a successful attack on the Subadar's Tank, capturing it after fierce fighting. This strategic move placed the British behind the enemy's left flank, causing the mutineers to lose morale. As darkness fell, the defeated mutineers fled the city they had conquered just six days prior. British cavalry pursued and captured many mutineers and their artillery. With the threat from the Gwalior army eliminated and control of Cawnpore secured, Sir Colin Campbell focused on preparing for the final campaign against Lucknow. Over the next two months, British forces engaged in expeditions, securing victories at Futtyghur and Furruckabad, sites of earlier massacres. Reinforcements arrived, including Nepalese troops.

As the news of the Kaiserbagh's capture spread, the guns fired a royal salute to celebrate the victory. Officers who could spare an hour from their regiments rushed to see the royal palace of Oude. Inside the palace, chaos reigned as soldiers ransacked the rooms, breaking furniture and searching for valuables to sell. Some officers were disappointed they didn't have money to buy the treasures the soldiers were selling for a fraction of their value. The Warreners, however, took a chance and bought jewels and other items with the little money they had. They pondered whether the treasures were real or fake but decided to keep their purchases hidden until they could ask their father about them. The looting continued, with soldiers and camp-followers grabbing items of varying value. The fall of the Kaiserbagh demoralized the enemy, who began to flee the town.

Ned poured out a bag full of shiny treasures on a barrel serving as a table, astonishing Colonel Warrener with bracelets, necklaces, tiaras, and more. They planned to secure the jewels in a chest, sending it with a convoy to Calcutta, then on to London for appraisal. The group explored Lucknow's deserted palaces and bid farewell to friends as the city underwent reconstruction. Joining a cavalry troop, they embarked on a mission to confront rebels near Furruckabad. After a day's journey, they rested in a mosque-like tomb, repurposing it for the night. Troopers fetched supplies as a fire crackled in the darkening chamber, where they shared a hearty meal and toasted to their journey.|"['1.

"""I'm sorry Manners isn't here,"" Dick expressed, ""it would have been great if we were all together again. But it's good to hear that he's recovering well from his wound and should be alright in a few months."" They chatted until ten, when Mr. Latham checked the sentries. Upon his return, they secured the door against the night chill and settled down for rest, using their saddles as pillows. Dick's mind raced as he tried to sleep, contemplating what they would do if attacked. Suddenly, they were awakened by gunshots and cavalry noises outside. Lieutenant Latham was killed, prompting the group to barricade the door. They discovered a staircase leading to the terrace above and prepared for the impending attack. The mutineers breached the door, but the defenders were ready, with a plan to climb to safety if needed."|"['1.

The next man hesitated upon seeing his leaders fall but was urged forward by those behind him. He readied his musket, preparing to fire at his enemies, but as soon as he peeked around the corner, he was struck by a bullet and fell. Despite the bodies piling up, the officers continued to push their men forward until an officer of high rank managed to halt the advance. Orders were given for the men to retreat, and after much discussion, they were instructed to clear the stairs of fallen comrades. An officer then proposed a plan to create a shield using planks from the door. The shield was carried up the stairs, protecting the men from enemy fire. After initial attempts failed, a second shield was constructed and used to advance against the barricade. The defenders attempted to burn the shield, but the men inside were prepared and stood their ground.|"['1.

It was well past noon, and the group ate and drank sparingly from their limited supplies. Smoke billowed from the stairs, heavy at first, then thinning. Attempts to descend were futile due to the dense, unbearable smoke from green wood. When the air cleared, they rushed down to their second barricade, hearing the destruction below. Planning a counterattack, they awaited the Sepoys. As the foes ascended, the Englishmen pushed against the door, causing chaos. In the ensuing melee, bodies piled up, blocking the stairs. The officers, with the boys close behind, retreated to the terrace. The Sepoys regrouped, exchanging fire until dusk. Another attempt to smoke them out was made, met with resistance. The enemy's persistence and tactics posed a continuous threat.|['1.

The group at the party noticed the smoke diminishing, but a sudden increase in smoke made them realize the enemy was still adding fuel. They stayed calm until Ned, near the door, shouted. He charged down with his sword, followed by others. As they approached the upper barricade, a shot rang out. Major Dunlop saved Ned from falling, and they retreated. Ned was unconscious from his wound. The defenders regrouped, confident the enemy wouldn't attack again immediately. Major Dunlop carried Ned up as Colonel Warrener and Dick guarded. The Sepoys, frustrated by the losses inflicted by the defenders, paused their attack. The defenders then retreated up a narrow stairway to safety, leaving the Sepoys below in anger and disappointment.|"['1.

Colonel Warrener explained that it was impossible to enter the area due to the lack of someone to lower the rope and the expertise needed to descend an 80-foot rope. He instructed Dunlop to take over guard duty from Dick. Dick was preparing to ride 70 miles to Lucknow to get help for the trapped group. He estimated the troops' progress and when they might arrive to rescue them. After bidding farewell to his family, Dick descended the rope from the dome to the terrace, where he found the area deserted. He carefully coiled the rope and made his way towards the enemy's cavalry position, moving cautiously among the sleeping soldiers.

Dick spotted four officers' horses picketed further away from the general mass of men's horses. These horses were closer to the road the English force had taken the day before, making them easier to steal and more likely to be in good condition. Dick heard snorting in the distance and found the horses he sought, all saddled but without bridles. He knew the halters would suffice for well-trained horses. Before acting, he surveyed the area and noticed sleeping grooms and troopers nearby. Dick cut the heel ropes of two horses, led them quietly towards the road, and crossed a ditch. One horse stumbled, but Dick managed to avoid a commotion. He then rode the horses towards Lucknow, changing mounts to keep them fresh. By morning, he had covered forty miles and reached the camp, where his arrival caused a stir. Dick quickly informed the commander-in-chief of the situation, leading to immediate action to rescue the officers.|"[""1.

A quarter of an hour later, bugles sounded, and by ten o'clock, three hundred British soldiers were ready in light carts, with cavalry and guns prepared. Dick, feeling tired, rested in the ambulance to avoid fatigue during the journey. Sir Colin greeted Dick warmly before the cavalry began to move. Dick fell asleep in the ambulance and was woken by the surgeon as they neared their destination. Dick was asked to guide the infantry in a surprise attack on the enemy. The infantry, led by Dick, approached the enemy from an unexpected direction. As the sun rose, the infantry engaged the enemy, causing confusion and retreat. The cavalry joined the pursuit, leading to a rout of the enemy forces. Dick's group stormed the tomb, engaging in fierce combat to secure the area and defeat the enemy leaders.|"[""1.

The battle was intense, with the soldiers rallying together with a cheer to confront the Sepoys. In just five minutes, the conflict was resolved, leaving many Sepoys defeated. Dick, injured from a severe cut, suggested a plan to lower Ned safely down a terrace, ensuring his comfort and care. Despite the challenging circumstances, the soldiers remained vigilant, taking turns to guard and protect Ned. The enemy's relentless fire was met with strategic defense, with shots narrowly missing their targets. Thirst and heat added to the tension, but the soldiers persevered.

On the third morning, the group resumed their journey. After traveling forty miles in two days, Colonel Warrener and Major Dunlop left Dick to continue to Agra. The farewell was emotional, and Dick shed many tears. His father promised to return to England if the Lucknow jewels were genuine after the war. Arriving at Lucknow, Ned fell seriously ill but eventually recovered. Dick, having also suffered from fever, accompanied Ned to Calcutta. They boarded a steamer to Calcutta and were reunited with family. The Lucknow jewels were valuable, and the group decided to share the fortune. Ned, no longer a soldier, sold his commission due to his health. Dick excelled in the service and was promoted. General Sir Henry Warrener retired with honors and reunited with Mrs. Hargreaves, becoming Lady Warrener.
