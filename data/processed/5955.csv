While he was engrossed in his hunt, something sudden startled him. Without warning, a loud bang echoed through the woods as Johnnie Green, hunting grouse, fired his gun.

This is how Tommy Fox caught crickets. He stood very still in the tall grass, watching carefully. Whenever he noticed the grass moving, Tommy would leap onto that spot, pressing his two front paws tightly against the ground. Under his paws, Tommy almost always found a plump cricket. However, there was a drawback to this hunting method. He could only catch crickets on calm days without wind. On windy days, the grass moved everywhere, making it hard for Tommy to distinguish between the wind and the crickets. One day, while Tommy was proudly catching crickets, his mother observed him. She realized that Tommy needed to learn more than just catching crickets to survive on his own. So, she brought back a woodchuck for Tommy to hunt. Tommy eagerly chased the woodchuck with his mother guiding him, eventually pouncing on it successfully.|"[""1.

Tommy Fox ventured into Farmer Green's back-pasture, closer to Blue Mountain than his home field. As he prowled among rocks and stumps, he relied on his senses to spot prey. His mother's advice echoed in his mind: always hunt with the wind in your face to catch scents ahead. Tommy's nose led him to a woodchuck, making his mouth water. He crept closer, ready to pounce.

Tommy Fox and Spot, Johnnie Green's pet dog, had an unusual friendship. Initially, Spot was wary of Tommy, but eventually, they started playing together. Spot, being larger and stronger, would sometimes play rough, causing Tommy to retreat to his underground hideout. However, Tommy never got angry because he knew Spot meant no harm. Johnnie Green was proud of Tommy and even took him to the village market tied to the wagon. Tommy was scared at first but enjoyed the ride, seeing many new things. Despite Farmer Green's occasional complaints about Johnnie playing with Tommy instead of helping on the farm, he secretly enjoyed watching the young fox.
