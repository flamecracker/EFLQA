During the early 19th century, there were tensions between the British and the Burmese. The British faced challenges in maintaining order among fugitives and arresting their leaders after a conflict. Despite efforts to assure the Burmese of friendly intentions, the situation remained tense. Raids by insurgents caused further trouble, which was eventually suppressed in 1816. The Burmese government demanded the surrender of captured chiefs and fugitives, but the British refused, citing principles of justice. Subsequent demands for cession of British territories led to threats of war. The Burmese later took possession of Assam amidst ongoing civil strife. This shift in power disrupted trade along the river, prompting the British to protect Cachar from Burmese incursions. Despite trade challenges, hopes were high for better prospects in the protected region.|"['1.

In the early 19th century, tensions between the British and the Burmese were escalating due to aggressive actions by the Burmese in various regions. The Rajah of Aracan showed contempt towards Indian government remonstrances. The Burmese were seizing elephant hunters near British territory, mistreating and imprisoning them. This aggression indicated a desire to control the hill country for potential attacks on cultivated areas. Stanley's uncle predicted an imminent conflict with the Burmese due to their arrogance and aggressive behavior. The British government tried to avoid war but eventually had to take a stand as the Burmese continued their acts of aggression, leading to the reoccupation of Shapuree by British forces.|"['1.

The Burmese quickly gathered troops in Aracan and Assam, prompting Bengal's government to fortify the frontier. The Burmese advance toward Dacca, Moorshedabad, and Calcutta was a serious concern. Units of the 10th and 23rd Native Infantry and local forces were deployed to Sylhet. Meanwhile, Tom Pearson, after securing Chittagong, sailed north to safeguard his depots. Stanley, fluent in Burmese, accompanied him. News of Burmese forces in Cachar caused panic in Sylhet. Despite the disruption to trade, Tom planned to observe the conflict. As Major Newton's forces confronted the Burmese at Jatrapur, Tom and Stanley offered to assist as aides-de-camp. The Burmese resistance was fierce, but Major Newton's strategic divisions pushed them back.|"[""1.

Captain Rowe took control of the village and moved his troops to assist another division. The Burmese, demoralized by their defeat, retreated as they were attacked from two sides, leaving a hundred dead. Only six sepoys were killed on the British side. The Burmese fled to the hills too fast to pursue, regrouped, and joined forces with another division from Manipur. Major Newton returned to Sylhet, and Mr. Scott, the commissioner, arrived later to communicate with the Burmese. The Burmese had about 6,000 men and had built strong defenses near Jatrapur. Captain Johnston led a small force that bravely drove the Burmese out of their stockades. Despite a setback, the British forces eventually forced the Burmese to retreat from Cachar.

A reckless act of aggression by the Burmese displayed their strong desire for conflict. Due to the unhealthy conditions on the islet of Shapuree, the stationed sepoys were withdrawn, and the Company's pilot vessel, Sophia, was directed to join the gunboats near the island. Four Burmese officials invited the Sophia's commander ashore at Mungdoo for a friendly discussion. However, upon arrival, the commander and his party were captured and detained in Aracan for a month before being sent back to Mungdoo. This unwarranted act led to a formal declaration of war from both India and Ava. Troops were reinforced in Sylhet and Chittagong to prepare for potential hostilities. The conflict began in the north, with forces moving into Assam, forcing the Burmese to retreat. Despite initial successes, the onset of the wet season halted further advances.|"['1.

The next day, the prisoners set off under the guard of twenty soldiers led by a high-ranking officer to safely reach Ava. The journey to the Irrawaddy River took two weeks. Along the way, the Burmese officer conversed with Stanley, asking about England and India. Stanley tried to keep the sepoys' spirits up by sharing news of the British expedition's progress.

The officer expressed disdain at the thought of the approaching ships posing any threat. He believed that the enemy would have to retreat once the army advanced. However, he was warned that the troops might put up a fight, especially with the presence of white regiments. Despite the officer's confidence, the imminent rainy season was seen as a natural obstacle. The officer predicted that diseases and fever would decimate the invading troops, leaving few survivors. Stanley, having experienced the harsh conditions of the wet season, knew the dangers of the swamp fevers. The expedition's timing was heavily criticized, as the wet season was the worst time to engage in military operations.

At twelve o'clock, the Liffey ship stopped near the main battery and the water gate, with the other ships lined up behind her. A notice had been sent the day before, promising safety to the people if they didn't resist. When the fleet's guns were ready, there was a moment of silence. The town seemed unable to fight back, hoping to surrender. The Burmese soldiers hesitated, shocked by the massive fleet and threatening cannons. Eventually, they fired at the ships, prompting a swift response from the frigate. Soon, the shore guns fell silent, and the Burmese fled. Troops landed, finding the town empty as the residents had been forced out. British and American captives were taken to prison but narrowly escaped execution due to a stray shot.

In just four days, they reached Ava after traveling day and night. The officer left the prisoners under guard and hurried to the palace. Soon, the town erupted in celebrations with guns firing, drums beating, and bells ringing to announce a supposed victory over the English by Bandoola and his soldiers. The officer came to take the prisoners to jail, and Stanley noticed the town's humble bamboo houses contrasting with the grand pagodas. These pagodas were considered a mark of merit, with each person building one according to their means. Stanley was granted special treatment and a Burmese officer's attire to explore the city under guard. The town was divided into inner and outer sections, surrounded by a massive brick wall, showcasing a unique layout with scattered houses and small population.|"['1.

A significant part of the enclosed region was taken up by the royal area, which included the palace, the court of justice, the council chamber, arsenal, and the residences of the ministers and top officials. This section was separated from the rest by a sturdy wall, twenty feet tall, with a matching stockade outside. The total population of Ava was only 25,000. The officer decided not to guide Stanley to the royal quarter, as it might cause offense, despite having permission to roam the town. Instead, they visited a few of the eleven markets in the town, consisting of thatched huts and sheds, offering various local products like rice, maize, fruits, and vegetables. The people were generally lighter in complexion than the Hindoos, with many tattooed faces. The men wore kilts and tunics, while the women donned wrapped garments.

In the morning, as he continued his journey, a sudden scream pierced the air from the nearby woods. Alarmed, he sprinted towards the sound, fearing someone was in danger. Upon reaching a small clearing, he spotted a menacing scene - a leopard had attacked two men. With quick thinking and bravery, he sprang into action. Silently approaching the beast, he plunged his knife into its side, then swiftly fired a gun to save the remaining man. The Burman, in awe of the rescue, pledged his gratitude.

A man, Stanley, had a close encounter with a leopard while trying to escape from captivity. The leopard had attacked his comrade, but Stanley managed to escape the beast's grasp. Fortunately, a Burman man came to his aid and killed the leopard. The Burman offered Stanley refuge with his group of outlaws in the forest. They crossed a river using a hidden boat to reach the safety of the forest headquarters. The Burman assured Stanley of his safety, as the outlaws were well-hidden and unlikely to be disturbed.

"""The man explained that his village was located five miles beyond the forest. He felt it was safe to visit his friends there now since most able men were away. He invited me to come along, and since I had no other plans, I agreed. Recently, a convoy of traders had passed through, making it unlikely for anyone to come again soon. The man mentioned that the mines belonged to the emperor, and gems were sent down every two months under heavy guard. However, some traders still managed to bring rubies from there secretly.

Stanley and the Burmese men had a deep conversation about saving lives and brotherhood. The Burman praised Stanley's brave act of risking his life to save another. The men showed their appreciation by building an arbor for Stanley and including him in their group. The men then went out to monitor the roads for traders. They encountered a group of merchants and took some of their goods without causing harm. Meinik explained to Stanley the strategy of posing as farmers to trade goods in the town without raising suspicion. The men planned to intercept the traders on their return journey to take any silver or goods they acquired. Meinik emphasized that they avoided taking all the goods to prevent retaliation and maintain their safety. The men preferred to avoid conflicts to protect their community and way of life.|"['1.

During peaceful times, a group of outlaws moved frequently to avoid being discovered by strong parties of villagers. They settled near trade routes but had to leave when authorities raised the villagers against them. The outlaws, led by Meinik, had recently captured a group of traders and their armed guards. They found hidden gems among the traders' belongings and decided to gift them to Stanley, who had helped them earlier. The outlaws, though robbers, showed gratitude for Stanley's assistance. Stanley, appreciating their gesture, accepted the rough gems as a present. The outlaws explained that the gems were of little use to them as they feared selling them due to the risk involved.

The group decided to hide their valuable treasures like silver and lead to avoid any unwanted attention. They believed that trying to sell rubies would put their lives at risk, so they kept their wealth hidden in a secret spot. When the war ended, they planned to return to their villages and use the money from their recent goods to start a new life. Stanley, grateful for their kindness, bid them farewell and set off with Meinik to his village. Meinik's return caused a stir among the villagers. Despite the uncertainty of having to join the war effort, Meinik was considering settling down. The villagers warned him of the frequent recruitment by the war canoes, which had already taken eight men.|"['1.

Meinik and Stanley decided to embark on a fishing journey to avoid the war canoes during a conflict in Burma. Meinik, following the local custom, left his family as a guarantee of his loyalty in battle. They settled in an empty hut, prepared a meal with rice, snakes, and pepper pods, and then Meinik went to buy a boat. After a rest, they purchased supplies like a pot, spices, fruits, and tobacco. At dusk, they set off in a pine log canoe with nets, a fire, and provisions. Meinik had hidden some money before their departure. Stanley expressed concern about encountering war canoes, but Meinik reassured him that they would likely be safe fishing at night. They paddled into the river, ready for their fishing adventure.|['1.

Many of the young men do not return to their villages during the day; instead, they work in the fields to ensure the crops grow. The headmen turn a blind eye to this as they understand that without cultivated fields, the people won't be able to pay their taxes. To avoid war canoes, the group stays in the middle of the river where the current is strong. They paddle until the first light of day, then hide the canoe behind bushes to rest. They continue their journey every night, covering about 40 miles each time. The river, once wide, now narrows in some parts. They fish at night to replenish their food supply. After ten days, they reach a point where the river splits into different directions. Meinik suggests they disembark due to the risk of encountering troops.

They forgot that even though the disguise as a native was convincing in the dusk or from afar, it would draw attention if traveling together by day. Accustomed to seeing each other, Meinik appeared ordinary, but to strangers, his face would seem peculiar. To avoid suspicion, they decided to journey eastward, following a river towards the hills. Crossing to the other side was impractical due to swamps and troops heading to Rangoon. Instead, they opted to travel among hills with villages and cultivated lands for sustenance. Meinik obtained supplies in a nearby town, and they paddled up a river, eventually trekking on foot towards a ridge between rivers. Navigating through cultivated fields and villages, they reached a high point, with a river leading towards Pegu, their intended destination.|"['1.

Stanley and Meinik climbed a hill, about 500 feet above the lowlands, covered in trees. As they entered the forest, they chopped firewood and built a large fire for safety. Meinik shared his fear of leopards, recalling a past encounter. They discussed the ongoing conflict near Rangoon, with the Burmese forces preparing to attack the British. Despite setbacks, the British retaliated, capturing a strategic stockade. The Burmese, underestimating the British, faced defeat as the British advanced with a naval and land force. The Burmese general, initially dismissive, joined the battle but was killed along with other leaders.

The British army had made a significant impact by capturing ten stockades in a single day, armed with thirty cannons. This victory had a profound effect on the villagers nearby, who were witness to the wounded soldiers. The villagers shared with Meinik the deep depression that had settled over the army due to the defeat. The Burmese soldiers, accustomed to individual fighting methods, were shaken by the realization that their strong stockades were ineffective against the British's coordinated attacks. Despite occasional skirmishes and failed attempts by the invaders to gather supplies, no major battles had occurred since. Reinforcements had arrived, including the king's brothers and a special corps believed to be invulnerable. As the Burmese army prepared for a decisive attack, Meinik and Stanley stealthily navigated through the forest towards the Woondock Snodee corps, seeking to gather information.|"[""1.

The quartermaster general assigned Stanley Hitchcock's quarters, a small but watertight room on the upper floor. Stanley had rubies and other stones acquired from men in the forest, unsure of their value. The quartermaster advised caution when seeking appraisal, as valuable gems could attract thieves. Stanley decided to consult Parsee merchants for evaluation. The quartermaster suggested a committee to assess the stones and saddlery, authorizing the paymaster to receive Stanley's extra pay. Stanley examined the stones the next morning, finding rubies, sapphires, and emeralds. He estimated their rough worth at a hundred rupees each. A trader valued them at five thousand rupees, offering to send them to a gem expert in Madras for a second opinion.|"['1.

Siam chose to navigate a middle path amidst the tensions. An army was ready for any situation. Siam was cautious of joining either side, fearing British retaliation if siding with Burma or British naval threats if aligning with them. The king assured both powers of his friendship. The Siamese army moved towards the province of Martaban, near the Salween River, causing concern for the British. A British force set sail against Martaban but faced obstacles due to defensive works. They decided to navigate the river despite challenges. After intense battles, the Burmese retreated, and the locals welcomed the British due to past oppression by the Burmese.

In late November, signs of activity in the forest alarmed villagers who sought refuge from Bandoola's advancing army near Rangoon. Approximately sixty thousand troops, including thirty thousand armed with muskets and jingals, gathered around the area. The Burmese army had cavalry, elephants carrying cannons, and infantry with swords and spears. They began constructing stockades, preparing for a confrontation. Stanley, part of the garrison, monitored the situation and interacted with refugees and the sick. General Campbell strategized to deliver a decisive blow to deter further attacks. The army awaited the Burmese to complete their fortifications before engaging. As musketry erupted from Kemmendine, the garrison prepared for the impending conflict.|['1.

Soon large clouds of dense white smoke rose above the forest near Kemmendine, obscuring the view. The fire raged relentlessly, indicating a fierce and persistent attack. Although confident in the fort's ability to defend itself, the thick smoke caused some anxiety among the defenders, given their small numbers. Amid breaks in the gunfire, the native yells and British sailors' cheers could be heard distinctly. After two hours of intense fighting, the noise gradually subsided, revealing the ships' masts. The garrison cheered as a sign of successful defense. Subsequently, enemy columns emerged from the forest across the river, marching towards Dalla in an orderly fashion, preparing to engage the British. The British forces, led by Tollemache, advanced against the enemy in the jungle, destroying their stockades, capturing weapons, and killing several foes. Throughout the day, the Burmese attempted to send fire rafts down the river, but the British sailors managed to tow most of them safely to shore. The Burmese diligently fortified their positions with earthworks, impressing Sir A. Campbell with their speed and organization.|"[""1.

The Burmese soldiers have a unique strategy of not rotating their troops in the trenches. Instead, fresh soldiers dig and occupy new lines, gradually advancing towards the target. This method minimizes casualties, as a shell falling into a hole only harms two soldiers, unlike in continuous trenches where many could be affected. The British forces faced constant skirmishes and artillery fire near Rangoon, with the Burmese entrenching themselves strategically. A decisive attack was planned, with gunboats diverting enemy attention while two columns of troops led by Major Sale and Major Walker launched a successful assault. Despite initial resistance, the British forces prevailed, capturing enemy positions and equipment. The Burmese regrouped in the forest, prompting another British offensive that involved heavy artillery fire and coordinated attacks from multiple columns. Ultimately, the British emerged victorious, forcing the Burmese to retreat into the jungle, securing a significant victory.|"['Question 1: What is the unique strategy employed by the Burmese soldiers in the trenches?\nA) Rotating troops daily\nB) Having continuous trenches\nC) Gradually advancing towards the target\nD) Using decoy tactics\nE) Engaging in constant skirmishes', 'Question 2: How does the Burmese strategy of not rotating troops minimize casualties?\nA) By increasing the number of soldiers in the trenches\nB) By using decoy tactics to confuse the enemy\nC) By continuously engaging in skirmishes\nD) By allowing fresh soldiers to dig new lines\nE) By retreating into the jungle for cover', ""Question 3: What was the outcome of the British forces' decisive attack near Rangoon?\nA) They faced heavy casualties\nB) They were forced to retreat\nC) They captured enemy positions and equipment\nD) They surrendered to the Burmese\nE) They engaged in a ceasefire"", 'Question 4: How did the British forces divert enemy attention during the attack near Rangoon?\nA) By retreating into the jungle\nB) By launching gunboat attacks\nC) By engaging in constant skirmishes\nD) By rotating troops in the trenches\nE) By fortifying their positions', 'Question 5: What prompted the British forces to launch another offensive against the Burmese in the forest?\nA) The Burmese surrendered\nB) The British forces faced heavy casualties\nC) The Burmese regrouped in the forest\nD) The British forces ran out of ammunition\nE) The British forces retreated into the jungle', 'Question 6: How did the British forces secure victory over the Burmese in the final offensive?\nA) By engaging in a ceasefire\nB) By retreating into the jungle\nC) By facing heavy casualties\nD) By using heavy artillery fire and coordinated attacks\nE) By rotating troops in the trenches']"|['C) Gradually advancing towards the target', 'D) By allowing fresh soldiers to dig new lines', 'C) They captured enemy positions and equipment', 'B) By launching gunboat attacks', 'C) The Burmese regrouped in the forest', 'D) By using heavy artillery fire and coordinated attacks']
During the ongoing firing, the four groups were already moving. One group went into the jungle on the enemy's left, another on the right. A central group advanced from the pagoda hill while the 38th Regiment descended from the north gate. The Burmese, momentarily bewildered by the multiple advances, soon retaliated with heavy fire. As the British troops charged, the Burmese were forced into the forest. The remaining British force at Dalla embarked in boats under Colonel Parlby to confront the Burmese. In a surprise attack, the British took over the enemy's entrenchments. The Burmese suffered significant losses while the British casualties were low. The British then planned to confront Bandoola's fortified position near Donabew to disperse his army and prevent further attacks on Rangoon.|"['1.

The challenges were significant. Only a couple of light field cannons could accompany the troops on their march. They had to navigate a narrow, winding path through a dense forest, vulnerable to an enemy ambush at any moment. Leaving a substantial defensive force in Rangoon was vital, as Bandoola's spies would likely discover the plan. The General, however, deemed it crucial to launch the attack promptly. On the morning of the 15th, 1500 soldiers moved towards Kokein. They traversed the forest without incident and approached the formidable enemy fortifications. As they emerged from the woods, the enemy opened fire from the flanks and rear. The 13th Light Infantry and the 18th Madras, supported by cavalry, were directed to attack from the left rear, while the main force assaulted the front. The assailants swiftly breached the Burmese defenses, surprising the enemy and capturing the works. The British forces suffered casualties but ultimately secured victory, driving the Burmese into retreat. The successful operation allowed civilians to return to Rangoon, kickstarting the town's recovery.|"['1.

Stanley explained that he had never met someone with the same name before, as he had spent most of his time trading up the rivers with his uncle and had limited interactions with white men until the incident at Ramoo.

Harry and Stanley discovered they were cousins and that Stanley would inherit Harry's uncle's title if anything happened to Harry. Colonel Adair praised Stanley's bravery and multilingual abilities, including saving a man from a leopard with just a knife.

The army then split into two columns to advance against Donabew. The first column marched by land, while the second, led by Brigadier General Cotton, traveled by water in a flotilla of boats armed with guns.

Major Sale commanded a force to advance towards Bassein with 600 soldiers and some artillery. Meanwhile, the rest of the force, mainly native regiments and Europeans, stayed at Rangoon under Brigadier General M'Creigh. The water force was tasked with capturing Donabew across the Irrawaddy River, while the general's force aimed for Tharawa. General Cotton's force would join after Donabew's capture, and they would advance towards Prome unless the court of Ava sought peace. Stanley was appointed to accompany the boat column, ensuring communication and a strategic view.

To ensure the safety of the flotilla from potential attacks by war canoes and fire rafts, a strong guard was left aboard the ships. This left the general with only 600 men for the assault. The enemy's guns controlled the river, so the troops had to disembark below the enemy's position on the 7th. They landed with two six-pounder guns and a rocket detachment. Dividing into two columns, they advanced towards the lower stockade. After a brief exchange of fire, they breached the stockade and took 280 prisoners. However, a subsequent storming attempt failed, resulting in the loss of commanders and casualties. General Cotton decided not to renew the attack due to the heavy losses and lack of reinforcements.

In this region of Burma, the Carian tribe resided, known for their hard work in agriculture. Despite heavy taxes, they produced surplus grain for Ava. Forced to work on stockades, they lived in small forest villages on tree branches or strong poles to avoid tigers. The villagers, fearing more Bandoola's men than the English, guarded the stockade gate at night. Stanley paid some to keep watch and stationed his own sentry. A war boat brought news of Bandoola's supposed victory. Passing a night with tiger howls, they rode to open fields the next day, where they encountered Burmese burning houses and attacking women. Stanley and his men swiftly intervened, killing six attackers and chasing the rest into the river.|['1.

Stanley waited on the riverbank until he saw that the group had safely started crossing. Then, he returned to the village. Meinik reassured the frightened villagers that it was safe now. He explained that the attackers had left their weapons behind, so the villagers could defend themselves if needed. They continued their journey and arrived at Tharawa. There, they learned that Sir A. Campbell had moved on after being told Bandoola had retreated. Concerned about supplies and the Burmese resistance, they decided to turn back to help Cotton. The troops retraced their steps, and Colonel Adair organized efforts to secure boats and supplies. The soldiers worked tirelessly to construct rafts and transport the army across the river. Eventually, they reached Henzada, prepared for any opposition from Bandoola. It was a challenging but necessary journey to support their fellow soldiers and capture Bandoola's stronghold.|"['1.

Colonel Godwin led a surprise attack on the Burmese force, but they fled upon sensing danger. The army then set up batteries near Donabew, facing resistance from the Burmese who made sorties to disrupt the work. When Bandoola's elephants approached, the cavalry and artillery fought back, causing chaos among the enemy. The heavy guns started firing the next day, forcing the Burmese to abandon the stockade. Bandoola's death led to their defeat. The army captured the fort, finding supplies and guns. They continued up the river, reaching Yuadit without opposition.

No soldiers were present in the town as the governor and troops had abandoned it, leaving only a small group setting fires. The troops hurried in and found the town ablaze with smoke rising. The flames destroyed nearly half the town, but they managed to save the grain stores. The locals shared that the negotiations were just a delay tactic until reinforcements arrived. The army hoped taking Prome would lead to Ava's surrender. However, the court called for more troops. The British aimed to restore order and invited the locals back.

The markets in Prome were well-stocked with various foods. Despite the Burmese religious prohibition against killing cattle, they had no issue with foreigners doing so. Labor was plentiful, and canoes were made to transport supplies. Troops cleared forests of bandits before the wet season. General's aides were busy with orders and negotiations. Stanley and his cousin, Harry, developed a close bond while working together. Meinik, Stanley's companion, adopted a more Western attire to blend in. He expressed contentment with English rule, preferring it over the oppressive Burmese government. Stanley predicted that the English would likely retain control of the region up to Prome, benefiting the locals.

In early September, Stanley was tasked with buying cattle from nearby villages and investigating a group of marauders. Accompanied by four troopers and Harry Brooke, they sought information. Prome's healthier location reduced illness compared to Rangoon, but many were still sick. Harry, recovering from fever, joined Stanley for a change of scenery. Stanley's daily trips were short, stopping at villages to check on the locals. Harry praised Stanley's language skills, enabling his freedom. Harry shared his recent appointment news and offered financial help. They discussed the lack of riches in the region and Harry's plans to take his helpful native servant along.

A man on horseback rode away quickly, leaving a worried fellow behind. The man warned the fellow that seeking help in Prome might lead to trouble instead of help. As the man rode on, he grew more anxious about what he might find in the village ahead. Upon arrival, he was shocked to see the village destroyed by robbers. The fellow explained that the robbers had attacked suddenly, causing chaos and destruction. The man and his companion decided it was too dangerous to search for the robbers in the dark forest.

I believe it's likely, Meinik. We stand a better chance of saving my cousin in Toungoo than searching in the hills. Finding him among the trees would be tough, especially if he's hurt. So, heading straight to Toungoo is best. We'll ride on horseback as far as possible, as Mr. Brooke might not be able to walk. Paying the men will motivate them to help.

I told the villagers that if they needed to fight, they must be prepared, as some of their people were already with the English and faced danger from their own countrymen.

The ancient ruins were vast, carved into a steep rock face resembling Hindu temples.

Concerned about tigers lurking in the deserted caves, Stanley suggested lighting a fire to keep the group safe. One Burmese man volunteered to stay with the boys while others gathered firewood. The group planned to take the horses to the river later. As they headed back to town, they learned about two prisoners held in the local jail.

Stanley had a plan to rescue his cousin, Harry Brooke, who was being held prisoner. He suggested using two rope ladders to get over the fence and into the compound where Harry was being kept.

Stanley suggested a plan to rescue his cousin, who was too weak to travel. He proposed creating a litter to move him from the bed.

He agreed immediately, mentioning the good treatment of wounded prisoners by the whites. There was a window at the back of the hut where the prisoner lay, making it easy to pass things unnoticed.

Four days later, Meinik informed Stanley that a man had agreed to assist them and both would be on duty behind the hut between nine and midnight. Stanley, accompanied by Meinik and two villagers, arrived at the palisade at ten o'clock. Meinik, cautious of a potential betrayal, insisted on joining Stanley to ensure his safety in case of an attack. Stanley, prepared with only a spear and a knife, left his pistols behind to avoid any unnecessary conflict. Meinik proposed a plan to approach quietly and communicate through a specific signal to identify their allies. If no alarm was raised, Stanley could advance and speak to his cousin. However, if there was trouble, Stanley was to climb back over the palisade to safety. The success of their mission relied on caution and strategic thinking to avoid any potential dangers that could jeopardize their plan.|"[""1.

Stanley and Meinik planned an escape for Harry, the prisoner, from the governor's stronghold. Stanley suggested carrying Harry on a litter through a secret passage behind the hut. Despite Harry's concerns about his health, Stanley assured him they would try to escape without harm. Stanley quickly organized the plan, informing the trooper and preparing the men for the rescue. The next morning, Stanley scouted a temple as a hiding place, considering its defensibility against pursuers. Meinik, confident in Stanley's abilities, accompanied him without fear. They explored the temple, seeking a secure chamber for defense. Stanley's strategic thinking and Meinik's unwavering support set the stage for a daring escape plan to free Harry from captivity.|"[""1.

Stanley and Meinik entered a mysterious chamber, holding their torches high. The room was spacious, with a dark object moving in the corner. Meinik identified it as a large boa constrictor. Stanley prepared to confront the snake, knowing its bite was harmless but wary of its powerful embrace. As Stanley cautiously approached, the snake sprang into action, thrashing wildly. They then ascended narrow, well-preserved steps in the chamber, leading to a small room with only a narrow window. Stanley speculated on the purpose of the chamber and stairs, pondering if there was a hidden exit. Upon inspecting the window, Stanley discovered it was actually a passage to a ledge outside, indicating it was once part of a temple's roof structure. This finding hinted at a possible escape route from the chamber.|['1.

Stanley carefully navigated the ledge until it abruptly ended, revealing a solid wall below. Confirming his suspicions about the ledge's purpose, they retraced their steps. Meinik, leading the way, halted before a flight of stairs. Hopeful about finding an escape at the top, Stanley suggested using it as a safe haven. However, the staircase had collapsed near the top, possibly due to a fallen roof or building. Undeterred, they planned to investigate further. Stanley proposed using noises to scare off intruders, recalling the fear induced by a mysterious sound in another chamber. They decided to gather reeds to create eerie sounds at night. Meinik was tasked with procuring food for a potential siege while Stanley explored the ruins. Despite the challenges, they remained determined to make the shelter secure and defendable.|['1.

The staircase leads up to a temple where priests once lived. The chambers likely belonged to the principal priests, giving them easy access to the temple roof. Stanley had prepared for a long journey, bringing silver to buy provisions. The Burmans fetched water in large skins for the temple shelter. The men and boys from the village had cooked rice and venison, enjoying a break. Meinik learned that the white captive, Stanley, was to travel to Ava soon. They prepared a litter using bamboo poles and a blanket for the journey. The plan was to leave quietly at midnight, with the second watch taking over guard duty. The escape was carefully planned to fit through a narrow opening in the palisade.|"['1.

Late in the evening, they arrived in the town and sat in a quiet spot until it was time to start working. Meinik noted that it was past midnight by the stars. They went to the place where they had climbed the palisade before and began cutting bamboos. Five bamboos were cut at ground level and six feet above. Meinik and Stanley led the way, followed by three Burmans carrying a litter. Two Burmans and the boys stayed guard. They approached the window silently, and the guard let them in. They carefully moved Harry onto the litter. The group left the building quietly, passed through the palisade, and headed out of town. They lit torches and waved them to scare off tigers in the forest. They reached the temple chamber, laid Harry on a bed of reeds and leaves, and lit a fire. Stanley thanked the guards and promised them their reward.|['1.

Meinik assured the party that spirits wouldn't harm them due to the presence of a white man. Despite uneasiness, they had a successful meal and lit cigars. The soldiers were disappointed about a prolonged stay to aid the wounded man's recovery. Stanley strategized defense in case of pursuit, emphasizing the temple's narrow entry points. They fortified the upper chamber with supplies. Harry, waking up bewildered, was informed of their location and plan. Stanley decided to wait for Harry's recovery before moving on to avoid being overtaken by pursuers. The group prepared for potential search, barricading the temple entrance to deter discovery.|"['1.

The group had fortified their position in the chamber, situated ten feet above ground level, with superstitions deterring their enemies. Despite the risks, they were well-prepared for defense. Armed with guns, pistols, and spears, they felt confident in their ability to withstand any attack. Additionally, they had provisions for a month and a strategic advantage with a narrow staircase to the chamber. As the pursuers approached, the group remained hidden, waiting for the right moment to act. Stanley, disguised in a peculiar outfit, shared the plan with his companions.

He positioned himself strategically in the doorway, hidden by the thick wall that cast a shadow over the room. From this vantage point, he observed as an officer and his men emerged from the trees, hesitating at the sight of the temple. Despite the officer's orders, the men were reluctant to advance. Soon, a superior officer on horseback arrived with more soldiers, commanding a search of the temple. Inside, they found signs of horses but realized it had been weeks since anyone had been there. Suddenly, a haunting sound filled the air, causing even the high-ranking officer to pause in awe. As eerie laughter followed, the soldiers, ignoring orders, fled in fear. The villagers and guards hidden inside the temple burst into laughter at the soldiers' reaction.

Stanley and Meinik discussed the dangerous task of clearing stones blocking an escape route from a besieged area. Meinik used a reed to scare away intruders with loud noises.

Stanley assured Harry that with good food, a strong appetite, and the cool cave air, he would recover quickly. He emphasized the importance of being vigilant and having two men on watch at all times. Stanley went down to check on the guards during the night to ensure their safety. The next morning, the governor and his men approached the temple, ready for a confrontation.

Led by officers of rank, the Burmese made repeated but unsuccessful attacks on a temple defended by brave men. After many fell, a high stockade was built. Two men cleared a passage of fallen comrades, taking the risk of being shot. They lit a fire in a hidden chamber above. The English officer planned to clear a staircase for escape.

The governor and his troops were relieved to bury the fallen soldiers with honor, preventing a potential outbreak of disease. The Burmese worked diligently to clear the land and fortify their defenses with a second stockade. Meinik believed the second line was to distract the men from their fears of evil spirits guarding ancient treasures. The temple, once a grand place, was now cursed, with stories of priests' mass suicides to protect the treasures. Kings sent troops to search for the temple, only to face mysterious deaths and impenetrable darkness. The legends of the cursed temple instilled fear and caution in those who dared to seek its hidden riches.|"[""1.

"""Meinik, we won't search for the treasure. The spirits seem to mean us no harm. I feel grateful to them. The soldiers may blame their misfortune on the spirits. Tonight we'll inspect the stairs and plan how to clear them. There's no rush, but sooner is better. The troops behind the stockade kept firing at the entrance all day. The defenders were in the next chamber and bullets couldn't reach them. They spread dust in the passage to hide the blood. After dark, Stanley, Meinik, and villagers went to the ledge with torches.

The Burmese villagers unanimously agreed to start working on the project immediately. They began by cutting the bamboos into sections and firmly wedging them from side to side using an axe and wedges. The supports were placed irregularly but had to touch the stones. They filled the spaces behind the bamboos with rubble to strengthen the structure. Stanley instructed Meinik and three others to clear small stones and rubble without moving the fixed stones. They secured a blanket to block out light. Stanley then heated iron rods to make chisels to chip away at the stones. He rested for a few hours and woke to a faint light, signaling the start of their work. Stanley investigated the passage and found a flat slab blocking their way.|['1.

Stanley and his team faced a challenging task in a narrow passage. They attempted to dislodge a stubborn stone blocking their way. Despite their efforts using heavy axes and chisels, progress was slow. After several failed attempts, they devised a new plan. By modifying the axes and using leverage, they finally managed to move the stone. Meinik, impressed by their perseverance, joined them in clearing the obstacle. The team's hard work over six days, taking turns to work, rest, and keep watch, paid off as they steadily made headway. Sharpening their tools near the fire helped speed up the process.

At the end of the week, there was only one large stone blocking their path. It appeared to be a massive pillar or gate post, about twenty inches on each side. The stone was inclined towards them, making it difficult to chisel. The group working on it felt disheartened until Stanley took over. He realized the usual methods wouldn't work due to the stone's angle. They hammered a small indentation into the corner and used a long ramrod as a drill. With constant sharpening, they managed to create a hole two inches deep. Stanley instructed the new team before heading down. He planned to blast the stone if drilling failed. With careful calculations, they aimed to weaken the block to break it off. Stanley hoped one blast would be enough, using a dozen cartridges. They needed to try the shot soon to plan their escape.|"['1.

Stanley decided to leave the next day and with the help of men, they managed to remove a large stone blocking their passage. They prepared to depart that night, taking precautions to muffle sounds and ensuring Harry's safe passage through the narrow path. Meinik and Stanley cleared the path, allowing them to reach the temple ruins undetected. They readied their supplies and fired shots to alert the enemy before departing.

Harry was cautioned about the risks of moving through a narrow passage due to his weak head. With the help of Stanley and Meinik, he carefully navigated the ledge. The challenging part was yet to come, where he had to be dragged through a two-feet-high passage. The group worked together to move Harry inch by inch, ensuring his safety. Once out in the open air, they continued their journey through the forest, taking breaks to rest and cook. The villagers welcomed them joyously upon their return, relieved to see them safe. The troopers, who had stayed behind, were glad to hear of the rescue mission's success. Harry was finally able to rest in a hut after the long and arduous journey.|"['1.

Fortunately, Meinik has already slaughtered a chicken and will concoct broth for you, providing a welcome change from your rice-based diet. The initial cooking was superb for the first few days but deteriorated afterward. This is one reason why I agreed to your request to depart promptly. While you have made remarkable progress, a monotonous rice diet is not ideal for a recovering patient. I will inform the general that you have safely descended but will require another week before mounting a horse. The air here is healthier and more invigorating than in Prome. Stanley's brief message confirmed the successful rescue of you and the trooper from the Burmese, emphasizing your continued weakness. He plans to remain with you for an additional week before heading to Prome. Congratulations on rescuing your cousin. Remain until he fully recuperates. Stanley stayed for two more weeks, during which you regained enough strength to undertake short horse rides. The villagers were rewarded, and defenses were fortified against potential attacks. The Burmese expressed regret at the party's departure, appreciating the kindness and generosity shown. They rode off, bidding farewell to the grateful villagers.|"['1.

In the morning, Stanley visited the 47th lines. Harry's story had spread among the regiment, and as Stanley rode in, the men cheered. The officers warmly welcomed him despite his downplaying of the danger he faced. One officer joked about Stanley risking his life to avoid inheriting an earldom. Stanley laughed, comparing it to Banquo and Macbeth. The colonel praised Stanley, saying many in the regiment admired his bravery. The troops had withdrawn after a failed expedition, but now they were ready to strike the enemy. The general planned to attack Maha Nemiow's division, known for its strong jungle defenses. The Burmese had 70,000 troops against Sir Archibald Campbell's 6,000. The Burmese had Shans and noblewomen believed to have supernatural powers. The English prepared to attack the next day, with the flotilla bombarding the enemy's works. General Cotton led the main attack, engaging the Burmese forces.|"['1.

As the British troops emerged from the jungle into the open area in front of the fortification, they quickly organized themselves despite heavy gunfire and charged forward. The elderly Burmese general, too frail to walk, was carried in a litter, encouraging his soldiers. The courageous Amazons braved the enemy's fire. Ladder teams advanced unchecked, scaled the stockade, and gained a foothold on the earth rampart behind it. A fierce battle ensued as the British forces pushed through the stockades, overwhelming the Burmese. The Shans fought bravely but couldn't withstand the British onslaught. The Burmese suffered heavy casualties and were scattered, many perishing in the forests. The British achieved victory, capturing the entire position.

The soldiers advanced to the base of the initial hill, where two sturdy forts stood. The fleet fired, but the troops paused, waiting for sounds of General Cotton's forces engaging. Yet, no noise came as they struggled to move through the dense forest. Finally, General Campbell ordered the assault. The 47th and 38th Native Infantry, led by Colonel Elvington, charged through the jungle to attack the enemy's outposts. They swiftly seized the outworks, creating an opening for the main attack. The 13th, 38th, and 87th Regiments then ascended the hill, capturing the redoubts and pushing forward with bayonets. They overran the enemy's positions, capturing around forty to fifty guns and causing significant casualties. The flotilla also secured victory by capturing boats and supplies.

On the 18th, the troops joined General Cotton's column and entered Meaday the following day. The town was a dreadful sight with dead and dying from wounds and cholera. Some men were crucified for desertion attempts. The air was foul, and the force was relieved to march on the next morning. For fifty miles, dead bodies were encountered frequently. They camped within four miles of Melloon, where a peace treaty was proposed. Negotiations failed as the Burmese leaders stalled for time. The troops advanced towards Melloon and were met with a fortified town and war boats. After some back and forth, a truce was agreed upon, but the Burmese were stalling.

The assault on the Burmese works lasted for two hours. Troops prepared to attack were divided into four brigades. The first brigade, led by Lieutenant Colonel Sale, landed below the stockade, while the other three landed above it. A strong northerly wind and the river's current delayed the assaults. Despite challenges, the first brigade, with Colonel Sale wounded, bravely advanced and breached the stockade. The other three brigades, landing above, completed the defeat. The British forces then advanced towards Pakang-Yay, meeting a few prisoners sent to negotiate peace. However, the British general remained cautious, knowing the Burmese were assembling another army.

The British forces faced the Burmese army in a semicircle formation. The British united their columns and charged the Burmese center, ignoring the fire from the flanks.
