His courage faded briefly, then surged back stronger. His guide's encouraging note spurred him on, increasing his pace to avoid being trapped.

He knew the lake's shores were low, planning to hide in dense foliage at the water's edge. Uncertain how, he'd adjust as events unfolded. The bird hinted safety, easing his mind. To evade warriors, he sprinted. Reaching the final crest, the lake's beauty captivated him, even in peril. The bird sang, then vanished. Crouching on a ledge, he scanned for pursuers.

Robert waited patiently near the lake, listening to distant cries that gradually faded away. Despite the chilling cold creeping through his body from the lake, he remained still, knowing the danger of revealing himself too soon.

After a while, he ate venison and hominy from his bag, feeling content. Dressed in dry clothes, he was ready to face any danger. The darkness was thick, the lake a faint gray. The cliff was a black silhouette. Eager to leave, he waited patiently, knowing haste could be risky. Resting in tall grass, he decided to set off at midnight. Before he knew it, he fell asleep. Waking up, he felt calm. He heard a familiar call, realizing it was Willet and Tayoga. They were on the lake, answering his signal. Relieved, he knew Tandakora would search in vain.

The canoe changed direction slightly, heading towards the bushes where Robert, the hunter, and the Onondaga warrior, Tayoga, stepped onto the shallow water. In the dim light, Willet's imposing figure and Tayoga's strong, bronze-like appearance exuded courage. Robert felt empowered just by their presence. Tayoga explained how he had eluded pursuing warriors led by Tandakora. The trio reunited after a scouting mission, using a hidden canoe to navigate the lake while searching for Robert.

The wind picked up, causing the lake to ripple and the canoe to sway. The two skilled youths handled the craft expertly, keeping it steady. The hunter, silent and watchful, was grateful for the reunion with Robert, whom he cared for deeply. As they scanned the surroundings, they spotted a distant light on the mountain. The trio, stronger together, prepared for potential danger from French and Indian forces. The hunter warned of the impending battle at Lake George or Ticonderoga.

"""Manitou can perform wonders for those he favors,"" mentioned Tayoga, ""but he often refrains from doing so, lest we grow dependent on him when we should rely on ourselves.""
""You speak the truth, Tayoga,"" replied the hunter. ""It's like saying that heaven aids those who aid themselves, and tonight, we must rely on our own efforts. The Indian canoes are likely searching for us on Andiatarocte.""
Robert sensed danger, unknown and lurking, waiting to reveal itself. ""I suggest we remain here for now,"" proposed the hunter. ""We must wait until we understand the situation before acting. Manitou wants us to fend for ourselves, as the night brightens, making it tough for fugitives.""
As the clouds cleared, stars emerged, illuminating the lake. Willet advised anchoring near a small island for cover. Amidst the silver radiance, they rested in silence, watching a distant fire, likely set to expose them.
""We must move,"" said Willet, as the red glow approached. Paddling swiftly, they sought refuge on another island, evading detection as the firelight closed in."|"['1.

The large bonfire blazed on the western shore, casting light on tiny figures Robert identified as warriors or Frenchmen. He scanned the dark waters for Indian canoes, fearing danger. Soon, dots appeared on the horizon, growing into a fleet of Indian canoes led by St. Luc. Willet admired the strategic move, acknowledging St. Luc's skill. They quickly hid their belongings in a canoe, slipping into the water to evade detection. As they swam toward safety, Robert hoped they would reach the next island unseen, escaping the approaching threat.|"['1.

The journey felt endless to Robert as they hurried towards the new, vast island covered in dense forest. A distant war cry echoed from the west, signaling danger. Warriors in canoes approached, forming an arrowhead formation, while bonfires blazed on the cliffs. Realizing they were trapped, the group devised a risky plan. They emptied the canoe, pushed it southward on the swift waves, hoping to mislead their pursuers. The canoe seemed alive, leading their enemies astray. Observing its movements, they believed it was guiding them to safety. The group watched as the pursuing warriors fell for the decoy, thinking the exhausted travelers were still aboard.

"""I think they're leaving us, but it's too early to tell,"" said the hunter. ""We must hide deeper in the island to avoid being seen. Let's not rely only on the canoe for deception."" They moved back and sat on a bushy hillock, hidden but able to see the water all around. Unless the Indians landed and searched thoroughly, they wouldn't be found. The canoe continued its task faithfully, seeming alive and clever. Robert agreed with Tayoga that it might have a spirit. The canoe danced on the waves, teasing the pursuers. Robert steeled himself, ready to fight rather than be caught by Tandakora. As they watched the fleet approach in silence, the lake glowed from bonfires, and the wind sounded ominous.

Closer drew the canoes, illuminated by the fires, revealing their occupants clearly. In the leading boat, the Ojibway chief, a formidable figure, sat bare-chested and adorned with fierce paint designs. Despite his already imposing stature, the night's darkness and fiery glow made him appear even larger, emphasizing his menacing features. Following closely behind Tandakora were two familiar French officers, Auguste de Courcelles and François de Jumonville, known adversaries from past encounters. The presence of the French confirmed their suspicions, with Robert certain that St. Luc held command. Despite the temptation to confront Tandakora, Tayoga cautioned against it, emphasizing the need to bide their time. As the fleet neared the island, a sense of urgency gripped them, driving them to pursue a distant, seemingly empty canoe with unwavering determination. The chase intensified, with paddlers exerting themselves to catch the elusive prize, while the hidden trio within the island's sanctuary breathed a sigh of relief, grateful for their miraculous escape.|"['1.

"""The imagination of Dagaeoga has been ignited,"" Tayoga remarked, ""and he can now speak freely without tiring, as is his habit."" From their vantage point, they observed the fleet swiftly heading south, while the fires in the north dimmed as they were no longer needed by the Indians. The red hue on the water faded, turning the lake a solemn gray. ""It's fortunate those fires dimmed,"" the hunter noted, ""as we can't stay on this island forever. We need to reach the mainland without being seen."" As they watched a distant canoe disappear, the hunter expressed his hope that it would elude their enemies. They decided to swim to the mainland when the fires dimmed further, using a tree as a makeshift raft to carry their belongings and ensuring it didn't capsize.

As the canoe approached, the four Indians scanned the lake intently, their eyes darting from tree to tree. Robert, feeling the weight of their gaze, remained still, submerged in the water up to his eyes, alongside the hunter and the Onondaga. The trio relied on the gentle breeze to guide their tree, blending in seamlessly with the other drifting trees nearby. The darkness provided cover, shrouding them in secrecy as the warriors inspected the area. Willet cautioned against any sudden movements, emphasizing the need for patience and stillness to avoid detection. Robert's vivid imagination painted a picture of both triumph and danger, testing his nerves as they evaded the probing eyes of their pursuers.

"The four individuals approached the canoe cautiously, but the hidden tree remained a mystery. Its gentle drift seemed innocent, blending seamlessly with the dark surroundings. After observing for a brief moment, they maneuvered the canoe away towards another tree. ""Let's nudge the tree to the right slowly. Robert, stay steady. We must be gentle. If we stray too far from the wind's path, they might track us down,"" cautioned one of them. As they surfaced, they rested on the trunk, feeling the chill after being submerged.

They pushed the raft off and watched it float on the lake, carried by the wind. After quickly drying themselves, they put their clothes back on. The hunter, feeling reinvigorated, held his rifle, his trusted companion for years, ready to defend against any approaching danger. As they climbed the cliff, covered in bushes, they kept an eye on the canoes searching for them in vain below. About three-quarters up, they paused to admire the moon and stars reflecting on Lake George. Robert, feeling a sudden weakness, leaned on a bush for support. Despite trying to hide it, the hunter noticed and stopped. Robert admitted his exhaustion, and they decided to rest in a hollow a few hundred feet from the top.

The small hollow in the cliff was a safe haven for Robert, Tayoga, and Willet. Hidden from view by evergreens and vines, it provided a moment of respite for the weary travelers. Tayoga, with his disciplined mind, quickly led them into a peaceful sleep while Willet, a man of refinement despite his life in the woods, found solace in the contrast between the wilderness and the city life he once knew. The hunter, ever watchful, ensured their safety in the precarious crevice, shielded by the darkness and the evergreen cover. As the night passed, the tranquility of the stars above and the shimmering lake below brought a sense of gratitude and protection to Willet's heart. Hidden in plain sight, the trio remained undetected by passing warriors, a source of comfort and amusement in the face of danger.|"['1.

In the bright morning light, the hunter, Willet, observed an eagle disturbed by their presence. Feeling a kindliness towards nature, he hoped the eagle would return to its nest. As the day progressed, the sun illuminated the lake and mountains, making escape by water impossible due to the presence of French and Indian canoes. Willet, always quick to make decisions, realized they were trapped. Despite the perilous situation, he remained calm and made the best of it, finding a hidden spot with Robert and Tayoga. The trio rested against the cliff, waiting patiently, as the intense light of day revealed the precariousness of their shelter. With the warriors nearby, attempting to pass them in the open would be futile, prompting Willet to devise a plan while the others slept peacefully, undisturbed by the unfolding events.|"['1.

The large hunter grinned. He had assured the Onondaga he would wake him at dawn, but decided to let nature take its course. He shifted slightly for comfort and reclined. Willet was thankful for the evergreen curtain shielding them from the warriors' watchful eyes. He remained watchful as the morning passed. Suddenly, he heard faint whispers and footsteps above. Peeking, he saw Huron warriors peering over the cliff. Willet readied his rifle, but they moved on. The warriors' voices faded, but Willet knew they would return. He waited, patient and vigilant. Robert and Tayoga slept peacefully, lost in dreams. Willet let them rest, knowing the importance of their youthful slumber.

The sun rose slowly in the east, painting the day in vivid colors. The waters of Lake George shimmered in gold, silver, purple, and blue hues. Despite his anxieties, Willet found solace in the beauty around him. Living amidst constant danger without a family of his own, he cherished the land he called home. Suddenly, shots echoed from the cliff above, likely from Indian hunters. As the afternoon dragged on, Robert's thirst grew unbearable, the lake's cool waters taunting him. Despite their discomfort, they ate a meager supper to sustain themselves. As evening fell, shadows brought relief, signaling the end of a long and arduous day.|"['1.

The dusk turned to night, and the trio waited patiently, battling their thirst. Tayoga proposed scouting the cliff's crest for an escape route. Willet agreed, and the Onondaga ascended noiselessly, vanishing among the bushes. Tayoga, a skilled tracker, reached the top without a sound, spotting a nearby bonfire where warriors feasted. Although Tandakora was absent, Tayoga suspected he was close by. As the warriors relished their hunt's spoils, vigilant sentinels guarded the camp. Hearing a triumphant shout, Tayoga, intrigued, observed four warriors leading a bedraggled man in a red uniform - Grosvenor, the young Englishman, now a captive. The warriors, jubilant, menaced Grosvenor with their weapons, a savage display that stirred pity in Tayoga, who recognized Grosvenor's exhaustion and resolve amid the perilous situation.|"[""1.

When Grosvenor was pushed into the fire by one of the warriors, he fell amidst cruel laughter. Despite this, he stood up bravely and then sat on a hillock where his captors left him alone for the time being. Tayoga, observing the situation, knew that Grosvenor's presence complicated matters in the Indian camp. He understood that Robert would never leave without attempting a rescue, and Tayoga's own compassionate nature inclined him to the same. However, extracting Grosvenor from the heart of the Indian camp seemed nearly impossible. Tayoga also realized the sorrow Grosvenor's capture would bring to young Lennox, who shared a strong friendship with him. Despite Grosvenor's lack of wilderness experience, he exhibited courage and resilience, earning Tayoga's silent admiration. Tayoga believed that Grosvenor possessed the qualities of a great warrior, ready to face his challenges with dignity and valor.|"['1.

Tandakora, the chief, sat down to eat deer meat, and Tayoga, after observing, descended carefully to join Robert and the hunter. They discussed Grosvenor, their captured comrade, and the urgent need to rescue him. Thirst led them to the water's edge, where they drank deeply, rejuvenating their spirits. Despite uncertainty, they were determined to save Grosvenor. Returning to the cliff, they surveyed the Indian camp. Tandakora brooded by the dying fires as Grosvenor slept, unaware of his peril.

Willet whispered to Robert that they might be watched by warriors in the forest to the north, but they decided to proceed. Nature was calm, and their movements went unnoticed. When a stick snapped, alerting the sentinel, they sprinted away, provoking pursuit. The hunter led Robert through familiar terrain, luring the warriors on a chase.

Grosvenor rested on the ground until his chest pain eased. Tayoga, the Onondaga, had the foresight to bring an extra rifle and ammo. Willet fetched water for Grosvenor, who drank eagerly. Grosvenor recounted his capture by Tandakora's warriors. They hurried south through the woods, hoping to evade pursuit. Grosvenor's strength returned, and they traveled swiftly. Robert prayed they would find friendly territory soon. Running low on supplies, they couldn't hunt while fleeing.

Willet signaled for the group to slow down as Grosvenor seemed tired. After three hours, they rested on fallen timber in the dense forest, catching glimpses of Andiatarocte Lake through the foliage. Tayoga, the Onondaga, noticed footprints indicating a tall, heavy man with moose hide strips on his moccasin heels had passed by recently. He deduced it was Black Rifle, likely searching for St. Luc or Tandakora. The trail led toward the lake, suggesting Black Rifle sought canoes. Tayoga's keen observation skills revealed details like a strand from Black Rifle's shirt caught on a log.

In the forest, Tayoga and Willet examine Black Rifle's trail. They notice small details, like a bone picked clean and a crumb hidden in a log crack. Tayoga explains that Black Rifle sat, ate, and thought hard before turning back to scout. They find his footprints leading to a hillock where he surveyed the land.

"""We have to learn it to live,"" said the hunter seriously, ""but with Tayoga, it's an art taken to the highest level. He was born with a talent for it, a remarkable one. He inherited all the knowledge gathered by a thousand years of ancestors, and then he enhanced it through his own exceptional efforts.""

""I believe this would be a suitable spot for all of you to stay while I backtrack a bit on the trail,"" said the hunter. ""If Black Rifle found it necessary to guard the rear, it's an even more urgent task for us, knowing that Tandakora has been trailing us, to do the same.""

He stretched out on the grass and relaxed completely. Knowing how to make the most of each passing moment, Grosvenor and Robert followed suit. The hunter had vanished into the foliage, leaving the three in silence.

Grosvenor felt immense peace. Despite his bravery, the overwhelming experiences had taken a toll on him, but the unexpected rescue had lifted his spirits.

Tayoga listened keenly, understanding more than just the hunter's return. He sensed that Willet had not found anything, the danger was distant, and their safety was assured. The calm, unhurried pace of Willet's steps revealed all this to Tayoga. Willet's unworried demeanor put Tayoga at ease. Soon, both were asleep, except for the hunter. Willet, despite fatigue, was optimistic. The recent rescue of Grosvenor by Tayoga was miraculous. They were in good spirits after overcoming many dangers. The discovery of Black Rifle's trail hinted at more luck. Willet's main concern was food for their small group. Grosvenor joked about becoming a scout, but the reality of their dwindling supplies was not lost on Willet. The group's hope remained strong, even in the face of hunger.

"Certainly! Here is the refined passage for middle school students:

""And he didn't,"" Robert added as they entered the thicket. ""Look at the marks where the bear fell, the blood spots, and the path where he dragged the body. It's all clear.""

""It was a hefty bear,"" Tayoga noted. ""He must have feasted well on roots and berries. Black Rifle likely cleaned the bear nearby. Bears are too heavy to carry far. I see buzzards circling above that oak tree. They must have known he left them a feast.""

Black Rifle must have had a good reason for carrying so much bear meat and not eating it all himself. Perhaps he expects us to join him. Grosvenor suggested that maybe Black Rifle plans to cook some of the bear meat, as it would be foolish not to use it after hunting the bear. The Onondaga agreed, saying that Black Rifle is cautious and would have checked for enemies before lighting a fire to cook the bear meat. He explained that warriors endure pain without flinching, a sign of bravery. Black Rifle's enjoyment of the meal was evident from the bones and shreds of flesh left behind, attracting forest creatures. A wolf approached, and Black Rifle threw a stone at it, hitting the wolf. The bloodstains indicated the wolf's retreat, driven by hunger like us now.|"['1.

Black Rifle led them to his hidden shelter in thick bushes. They shared a bear they had hunted, each getting an equal portion stored in their knapsacks. Grosvenor kept his knapsack safe from the Indians. With enough food for days, their worries eased. They discussed St. Luc's strategy to veil Montcalm's movements. Willet urged caution and staying focused. Grosvenor embraced his new role as a scout. Black Rifle planned to outsmart St. Luc by hiding their trail. They walked along a brook to cover their tracks and gain a strategic view from higher ground. The group settled in a thicket on a hill, ensuring safety and rest for Grosvenor.|"['1.

As the sun dipped below the western horizon, the forest was cloaked in darkness. But soon, the moon and stars illuminated the sky, turning it silver. Grosvenor and his companions, led by Willet, waited patiently for most of St. Luc's forces to sleep. Finally, under the cover of night, Willet signaled to advance towards the campfires that served as their guide. They observed St. Luc, the French leader, standing regally by a fire, a striking figure in his officer's uniform. Tandakora, a formidable presence, remained alert, signaling potential danger. As they cautiously navigated around the camp, they anticipated reaching friendly forces by the lake the next day. Despite the dangers lurking in the forest, their spirits remained strong as they ventured further into the unknown wilderness.|"['1.

They rested well, ate plenty, and made good progress. Walking in a line, Willet led, Tayoga followed, and Grosvenor was ahead of him. The young Englishman's ambition grew as he aimed for a successful night trail. Following Robert's steps carefully to avoid noise, he passed the test. As they moved south, Tayoga heard two warriors behind them. The Onondaga listened, confirming they were tracking their trail. They decided to wait, hidden in the shadows, as the warriors stopped nearby. Prepared for a possible fight, they trusted in Manitou's guidance. Grosvenor felt the thrill of impending battle, confident in their group's abilities for the challenge ahead.|"['1.

Willet hoped for dark skies, but the moon and stars persisted, casting light on the forest. Aware of the danger, they crept away slowly. Suddenly, a rifle shot whizzed past, prompting them to take cover. The eerie cry of a night bird signaled approaching danger. Despite the tense atmosphere, they remained vigilant. A bullet narrowly missed Grosvenor, causing a brief scare. The tension mounted as they awaited the enemy's next move. Another shot was fired, met with a swift response from Willet. A cry of pain echoed through the woods, followed by an ominous silence. The group braced themselves, ready for whatever came next. Robert, though unnerved, steeled himself for the looming threat, his imagination running wild amidst the stillness of the wilderness.|"[""1.

Black Rifle was hit in the shoulder by a bullet, but it was just a minor wound that fueled his determination to face his foes. Grosvenor also got grazed by a bullet, feeling proud of the small injury as a mark of bravery. As shots were exchanged, the group strategized to escape the impending danger. Willet and Black Rifle discussed the need to evade the enemy's main force at daybreak. Tayoga sensed movement to the north, hinting at more warriors approaching. The group decided to move quietly, listening for signs of danger. Despite gunfire nearby, they managed to slip away unnoticed, with Tayoga's keen senses guiding their escape.|"[""1.

In the dim light of dusk, Grosvenor couldn't see the sparkle in Tayoga's eye, but he gathered his courage and determination to continue his mission. Despite the discomfort of his aching elbows and knees, he pressed on with his rifle, determined not to complain. The distant hoot of an owl signaled the presence of nearby Indian groups. Willet sensed their suspicion and urged the group to move swiftly. As they crept around a hill, they rose to their feet, relieved to stand tall again. Listening to the owls' calls, Tayoga deciphered the Huron signals of doubt and worry. The group encountered ten Mohawk warriors led by Daganoweda, allies who engaged the Hurons in battle. They hurried south, the lake's shores drawing near through the trees.|"[""1.

"""I believe we can relax now,"" Willet stated confidently. ""I'm sure none of those warriors could have passed the Mohawks, and it's unlikely that any enemies are close by. Can you hear anything, Tayoga?""

Grosvenor's blanket, still strapped to his back from his time as a prisoner, provided a welcome rest. They wrapped themselves in the blankets and drifted off to sleep, only to be awakened at dawn.

Robert observed a distant column of smoke rising from the lake's edge, speculating it might be a British or American post. Despite the dangers they faced, they were determined to deliver their message in time.

Tayoga, smiling, noted the urgency in the distant sounds of axes and saws. The noise indicated the construction of boats for the advancing army, reinforcing their mission's importance."|"['1.

From the top of a hill, Robert and Grosvenor gazed at a bustling scene below. Despite the early hour, over fifty men were hard at work in the forest with axes, while a sawmill buzzed near the water's edge. Boats were being crafted along the shore, soldiers in uniform patrolled the area, and the air was alive with energy. The sight of their own people and the industrious activities lifted their spirits after the dangers of the forest. Spotting their friend Captain Colden by the water, Willet hailed him, and the group was warmly welcomed into the camp. Colden swiftly prepared for defense upon hearing news of an approaching French and Indian force led by St. Luc. Despite the looming threat, the group found comfort in a hearty breakfast and the camaraderie of their fellow soldiers.|"['1.

Willet stood up from his breakfast and looked around. There were no real buildings, only sheds. The largest one covered the sawmill, while the others protected tools and sleeping men from the weather. The trees had been cut down, preventing ambush by hostile Indians. The men were building breastworks, turning the area into a fortified point. Colden thanked Willet for the warning. Grosvenor, refreshed and neat in his uniform, joined the preparations. Robert and Tayoga worked on the breastworks, keeping watch. The lake behind them was peaceful. St. Luc would have to come up a narrow slope, making it a good defensive position. Colden kept the men working despite doubts. Black Rifle scouted the enemy.

The evening darkened as expected, with the campfires casting a warm glow amidst the guards and crude yet effective fortifications. Willet, Black Rifle, and Tayoga stood vigilant near the camp's defenses, ensuring no enemy could hide in the night. Wagons formed a protective circle within the camp. Grosvenor and Wilton discussed the imminent attack, reflecting on their unexpected roles in the forest. The atmosphere grew tense as they awaited the enemy's move. Willet decided to lead his men outside for better defense. Black Rifle's silhouette emerged from the shadows, ready to join them. The night was filled with anticipation and uncertainty, with the young captain feeling the weight of the impending danger.|"['1.

"""I hear footsteps close by,"" he finally spoke, ""and they sound like warriors. They are approaching cautiously, believing we are not beyond the line of logs. Yes, they are warriors, all of them. They lack the metal jingle the French have on their gear. They are scouting our position. They are about to pass by on our right. I also hear steps, but further away on our left, likely Frenchmen.""

""There's a larger force heading straight for us,"" the Onondaga added, ""possibly a mix of French and warriors. This could be the attack, and it might be wise for us to retreat.""

They moved back slightly, staying hidden among the stumps. Robert now heard the larger force approaching and pondered St. Luc's battle strategy. Black Rifle stealthily moved to the right, anticipating an encounter. A Huron warrior rose, but before he could cry out, Black Rifle swiftly silenced him. The forest echoed with shots and yells as the warriors retaliated.

Wilton gazed at the lake, the gentle wind blowing and the water rippling like a lullaby. The cliffs across looked imposing but not menacing. The darkness crept in, the moon and stars vanishing. The campfires blazed, lighting up the faces of the men. Willet ensured there was enough ammunition, easing his fears. Tayoga saw no movement from St. Luc's force but they had lit a large fire. Robert, choosing to stay with Wilton, watched the darkness encroach. The defenders fired back defiantly.

In a moment of crisis, Robert and Wilton sprang into action, firing their weapons at the oncoming warriors. The battle intensified as more enemies joined the fray, armed with tomahawks and knives. The defenders, including Grosvenor, fought fiercely, exchanging gunfire and engaging in close combat. Despite the relentless attack, the borderers stood their ground, even as more foes emerged from the lake. The air filled with the sounds of war cries and shouts as the fierce struggle unfolded. Willet and Tayoga, recognizing the imminent threat, joined the fray at the water's edge, where the battle raged most fiercely.

The brave hunter urged his comrades to push the attackers back into the water, using his weapons to fend them off. Tayoga, wielding a tomahawk, fought fiercely alongside the soldiers and borderers, preventing the savages from entering the camp. The line of defense held strong, and the shouts of encouragement from Willet boosted the morale of the troops. With Willet's guidance, the men launched a coordinated attack that overwhelmed the warriors, forcing them to retreat into the lake and swim away into the darkness. Despite the intense combat, Willet calmed the young soldiers, preventing them from pursuing the fleeing enemies. As the battle abruptly ended, Robert felt the adrenaline fade, and the sudden silence left him disoriented. With his pistol empty and his senses overwhelmed, he wiped his face, trying to clear his mind. Grosvenor, too, was in a daze, staring at his sword.|['**1.

The assault was thwarted, but it came at a cost. Fifteen soldiers had fallen, and many more were wounded. Seventeen Native Americans who had attacked from the water were laid to rest in the waves. The rest, along with their French allies, were lost in the forest. Colden and his troops emerged victorious, yet the threat lingered. St. Luc remained a danger, possibly planning a stronger strike. A council was held, led by Willet and Black Rifle, deciding to fortify their defenses and remain vigilant. The wounded were tended to by those skilled in frontier medicine, enduring their pain in silence. As rain fell, soldiers stood guard, molded bullets, or rested, ready for their next watch. Robert, still on edge, confronted the looming danger, preparing for what lay ahead.|['1.

The three friends walked along the beach, listening to the sad sound of the waves and the rain. They felt heavy and sad after the excitement had passed. They could only see a short distance over the lake and had to rely on their ears to warn them of danger. Tayoga, with his incredible hearing, joined them, creating a listening post. Wilton felt stronger with him there, and Grosvenor was completely confident. Tayoga heard a faint but regular sound of a paddle stroke, indicating a canoe passing by.

Manitou still holds the secret, Dagaeoga, but with patience, it may be revealed soon. The canoe barely moves, the man inside watches, and his paddle splashes as he turns right, clearly alarmed. The spy senses being spied on, growing more uneasy, moving aimlessly, trying to see what's near. Suddenly, a powerful stroke sends the canoe left too late! The man falls into the water, disappearing. Someone swims to the canoe, grabs the paddle, and heads towards land. It's Daganoweda, the Mohawk chief, a powerful and striking figure emerging from the mist. He steps ashore, a proud salute in hand, a giant in the dusk, with only a tomahawk and knife, a warrior who wields his weapons well.|['1.

The entire line slowly moved ahead and stopped behind another row of stumps. A sudden volley of shots greeted them, finding shelter just in time. Bullets hit the stumps or the ground near them. Robert knew the shots were mostly random or drawn by a slight noise. There was a strong urge to shoot back, but he held back, waiting for a clear target. The battle in the fog intensified as more skirmishers from St. Luc's forces arrived. The Indians joined in, making the combat more chaotic. Willet's band was reinforced, extending their line to meet the enemy's. Rifles fired continuously, filling the fog with smoke and sounds.

In the heat of battle, Robert faced a familiar foe, Charles Langlade, known as the Owl. Despite his previous kindness towards Robert, Langlade now aimed to take his life. Robert's initial instinct to show mercy was quickly replaced by a sense of vengeance when he recognized De Courcelles, who had once tried to deceive him. As the skirmish intensified, Robert's emotions shifted from gratitude to a determination to eliminate his adversaries. In a tense exchange of gunfire, Robert's resolve to protect himself overrode any previous feelings of goodwill.

Robert was able to see through the thick fog that De Courcelles had only been wounded, not killed. The bullet had struck his shoulder, causing pain but likely not fatal. Despite this, Robert was relieved he hadn't killed him, content that the wound would drive him away from the battle. As the fighting intensified, the fog grew thicker, obscuring the combatants from each other. With a mutual agreement, the forces separated, ending the conflict. The camp settled into an uneasy peace as the night fell. Colden decided messengers needed to be sent for help, and Robert and Tayoga volunteered. Equipped with supplies, they set off in a canoe, disappearing into the fog-covered waters, guided only by their instincts and determination.|"['1.

Robert strained to hear the canoes ahead, distinct in the fog. A large one with Frenchmen seemed to be strategizing. With precision, they spread out, anticipating unseen passers. Tayoga, swift and silent, vanished into the mist, leaving Robert to wait anxiously. Suddenly, a splash broke the stillness, prompting Tayoga's swift return.

The soldiers cautiously approached the creek, ready to pursue the warriors who had fled into the forest on the other side. Strong held them back, allowing the cannons to do their work. The cannons, powerful twelve pounders, boomed through the woods for the first time, causing echoes to reverberate. As the soldiers crossed the creek, the cannons cleared the way, driving away the warriors with their gunfire. The soldiers, proud of their cannons, crossed the creek victoriously. Robert admired the cannons, acknowledging their importance in the forest. Tayoga scouted ahead and warned of a potential attack from the French and Indians. Strong remained calm, prepared for any challenge. Robert and Tayoga led the scouts into the forest, approaching a quiet ridge cautiously, aware of the potential ambush by their enemies.|"['1.

Tayoga, speaking in his usual precise manner, explained his plan to draw the enemy's fire. Robert watched with intense interest as Tayoga crept forward, stumbled, and then stood upright, exposing himself to the hidden enemy. A shot was fired, but Tayoga dodged it swiftly. Robert tried to aim at Tandakora, the Ojibway chief, but missed. The battle intensified as the scout's forces advanced up the ridge, facing heavy fire from the enemy. Elihu Strong's men held their ground, supported by the cannons and rifles. After a fierce two-hour battle, a shout from the north signaled the arrival of Willet and his reinforcements. The French and Indians retreated, and the united forces celebrated their victory. Robert expressed admiration for Tayoga's skills and pondered St. Luc's next move near Champlain or Ticonderoga. Willet suggested following St. Luc's trail to stay ahead.|"[""1.

Willet led the group tracking St. Luc, which included Tayoga, Robert, Grosvenor, Black Rifle, and Adams. Daganoweda and his Mohawks had left earlier for their own mission. The trail was clear, and the Onondaga could easily follow it. He identified the footprints of Sharp Sword, Jumonville, Dubois, and Tandakora. Sharp Sword seemed disappointed by a recent failure and walked alone to plan his next move. De Courcelles was absent, likely wounded from a previous encounter. Willet spread his team out to avoid ambush, suspecting Tandakora might try to set a trap. The group continued north, cautious of potential dangers ahead based on the Onondaga's analysis.|['Question 1: Who led the group tracking St. Luc?\nA) Tayoga\nB) Robert\nC) Grosvenor\nD) Black Rifle\nE) Willet', 'Question 2: Who had left earlier for their own mission?\nA) Tayoga\nB) Robert\nC) Grosvenor\nD) Daganoweda\nE) Black Rifle', 'Question 3: Who identified the footprints of Sharp Sword, Jumonville, Dubois, and Tandakora?\nA) Willet\nB) Tayoga\nC) Grosvenor\nD) Black Rifle\nE) Adams', 'Question 4: Who seemed disappointed by a recent failure and walked alone to plan his next move?\nA) Sharp Sword\nB) Jumonville\nC) Dubois\nD) Tandakora\nE) De Courcelles', 'Question 5: Who was absent, likely wounded from a previous encounter?\nA) Tayoga\nB) Robert\nC) Grosvenor\nD) De Courcelles\nE) Adams', 'Question 6: Who spread his team out to avoid ambush, suspecting Tandakora might try to set a trap?\nA) Tayoga\nB) Robert\nC) Grosvenor\nD) Black Rifle\nE) Willet']|['E) Willet', 'D) Daganoweda', 'A) Willet', 'A) Sharp Sword', 'D) De Courcelles', 'E) Willet']
"Tayoga exclaimed, ""I've found the Ojibway chief's footprints again. He's halted and his warriors are likely with him, plotting.

Willet suggested turning back, yet couldn't resist outsmarting Tandakora. The group veered off the trail, circling to approach Tandakora from behind. Moving silently, they aimed to catch him off guard. After two cautious hours, they returned to the trail, confirming St. Luc's progress. Tandakora's ambush awaited to the south. Mimicking a crow's call, Tandakora responded, revealing his location. Willet planned a strategic strike, relying on Tayoga to flank the enemy.

They disposed themselves in good order for battle, and then sank to the earth. Light waves of air registered delicately but clearly on those wonderful eardrums of Tayoga's. Faint though the sound was, he understood it. It was the careful tread of men. Tandakora and his warriors were on the way, called by the crow.

His ambition to excel as a tracker was ignited, and he pursued it energetically. Although he lost the trail a few times on hard and rocky terrain, he always found it again after a brief search, renewing his pursuit with even more determination. Moving over a hill and into a broad valley filled with thickets, he pushed through the bushes in search of traces and was startled by a sound near him.

The three soldiers walked quickly, and Robert had to match their pace. They showed they knew where they were going, hinting a hostile camp was near. Determined to stay strong, Robert held his head high as they approached. After about three miles, he spotted uniforms through the trees.

Robert found himself in the midst of a French camp, led by the talkative Langlade. As they journeyed through the forest, the French force moved swiftly. Nights were spent by the fire with food from their knapsacks. Robert slept peacefully, knowing escape was futile. The next day, they continued north-east, reaching the main French camp. Robert was in awe of the French power in North America. He observed the camp's layout and estimated their numbers. Despite Abercrombie's larger army gathering at Lake George, Robert believed Montcalm might retreat. Langlade, in charge of Robert, ensured his compliance.

In the camp, a dispute arose over a captive named Lennox. Tandakora claimed him, but St. Luc defended that Lennox was rightfully his. Robert, feeling left out of the upcoming battle, pondered escape but found it challenging. As a prisoner, he was confined by the French army. Despite the gloomy atmosphere among the captives, Robert tried to engage them, but they remained despondent about their uncertain fate in Canada.

Robert sat alone on a rock, thinking about the French army's movements. He believed they might retreat, leaving control of the lakes to the Anglo-American forces. Seeing no signs of withdrawal, he thought it was delayed. The French seemed relaxed, and the absence of Indians surprised him. Captain Louis de Galissonnière approached, hinting at their strategic silence. Robert, optimistic, felt the tide turning in favor of the English. He noticed the missing Indians, interpreting it as a sign of their foresight. De Galissonnière, though curious, remained silent. Robert, realizing his enthusiasm, apologized, but De Galissonnière dismissed it. Robert observed the absence of Indians, confirming his theory. Later, he spotted Achille Garay, the spy he and Tayoga had confronted in the forest.|"[""1.

Garay's angry stare at Robert made him shiver, feeling helpless as a prisoner. He remembered Garay's attempt on his life and anticipated revenge. Despite the danger, Robert remained calm. As he turned away, Garay vanished, leaving Robert uneasy. Robert observed the French and Canadians in the camp, realizing they were likely messengers spying on the Anglo-American army. He expected the French to retreat but was surprised when they stayed. As days passed, Robert saw less of Garay, assuming he was spying on the enemy. Restless as a prisoner during significant events, Robert sought escape but found none. Despite his frustration, he acknowledged his decent treatment and familiar faces among his captors.|"[""1.

Robert pondered the French army's unusual decision not to retreat. Despite attempts to glean insights from De Galissonnière, the young captain remained vague on military details. As night fell with threatening weather, Robert anticipated seeking shelter in tents but was relieved when the rain veered westward. The warm night prompted him to prefer sleeping under the open sky. Despite the darkness and distant storm, the camp remained dry and peaceful. Robert found solace in the distant lightning and thunder, lulling him to rest. Observing his fellow captives asleep, he admired their ability to let go of worries and embraced the idea of conquering sleep through sheer willpower. Although the hunter nearby appeared stoic, Robert acknowledged his humanity and resolved to emulate his peaceful slumber despite the challenging circumstances.|"['1.

Tilden remained motionless, unresponsive to the second call. Robert realized his mistake in trusting the man, finding him dull and uninterested in their dire situation. As Robert lay with his eyes closed, a faint sound caught his attention, alarming him. Opening his eyes, he saw Garay looming over him with a knife. With a quick dodge, Robert narrowly avoided the blade. Garay, frustrated by the miss, swiftly fled into the darkness. Robert, shaken but unharmed, pondered his next move. Knowing he lacked evidence against Garay, he resolved to stay vigilant. As dawn approached, Robert braced for future attacks, convinced Garay sought revenge.

The night grew brighter as the lightning faded, the storm passing into the distance. A clear moon and countless stars emerged, illuminating the camp. Feeling that Garay's threat had subsided, Robert closed his eyes and slept until morning. De Galissonnière returned, and Robert, staying silent about Garay, sensed the captain's anticipation. Abercrombie's advance seemed imminent, hinting at Montcalm's retreat. Later, Robert spotted Montcalm conversing with St. Luc and Bourlamaque, joined by the urgent French partisan, Langy. Langy shared crucial news with Montcalm, sparking excitement for impending battle. With British and American forces approaching by boat, Montcalm, St. Luc, and Bourlamaque brimmed with valor and readiness, aware of the impending clash.|"['1.

Langy informed St. Luc that the enemy's guns would arrive after their army landed, believing they wouldn't need artillery due to their overwhelming force. Langy expressed hope in a glorious chance to outmaneuver the enemy, as their strength had led them to underestimate the defenders. St. Luc agreed, emphasizing the opportunity to hold the earthworks against the enemy without cannons. The engineers, Lotbiniére and Le Mercier, were eager for battle and began fortifying Ticonderoga. Robert sensed victory approaching as the French hastily prepared defenses against the advancing Anglo-American army. Montcalm, swayed by veteran officers, decided to retreat to avoid being dominated by nearby heights. The army repositioned, anticipating an imminent attack.|"[""1.

Robert and his friends were taken by the army on land to the fort. There he got separated from the others and stayed in the back, but luckily, he could see most of what was happening from a high point. He was at Ticonderoga, a rocky peninsula. Behind him was the vast lake, Champlain, extending far north and south. To the west, the ground sloped gently up half a mile and then down again. On each side of the ridge was low ground, forming a defensive line. Hugues, one of his officers, had suggested it to Montcalm, and men under engineers Desandrouin and Pontleroy were working there. The final defense line was started at dawn, and Robert watched as the French army put in a huge effort to build it. The scene was full of activity with men cutting trees and building defenses. Robert thought the attacking army's artillery would destroy it, not knowing the cannons were left behind. Despite his frustration at being idle, he was absorbed in the dramatic setting around him.|"[""1.

Robert stayed quiet as St. Luc resumed his tasks. Throughout the day, the men worked tirelessly, even as the sun set, the sound of axes and falling trees echoed in the darkness. Some soldiers cooked while others continued working. In the night, De Levis and his troops arrived, welcomed warmly by Montcalm. A crucial meeting took place late into the night among trusted officers. A significant event had taken place earlier, resulting in the death of the brave Lord Howe.

Robert was awakened by a feeling of impending danger, and as he opened his eyes, he noticed Garay approaching cautiously. Unsure of the spy's intentions, Robert stood up and stared at him intently, causing Garay to retreat into the camp.

A red patch emerged on the crest, signaling the scouts' presence. The rangers, clad in forest green, outnumbered the English, hinting at an imminent attack. Suddenly, a shot from Ticonderoga pierced the air, followed by a volley. The French, unscathed, realized it was the Iroquois allies, not the English, firing. The forest fell silent as the French resumed their tasks. Robert sensed more was to come. As the sun climbed, a distant crash marked the beginning of battle.

"Robert paced nervously in his confined area. The smoke filled his eyes, throat, and nose, making his brain feel overheated. However, his confidence remained unshaken. ""They'll come! They'll come! Nothing can stop them!"" he repeated to himself. The Colonial soldiers on the flank advanced, intertwining with the regulars and charging forward. Despite facing a barrage of fire and climbing over fallen trees, both British and American forces reached the wooden wall, enduring the harsh elements. The French leaders, including Montcalm, St. Luc, De Levis, and Bourlamaque, exerted their utmost efforts. St. Luc encouraged his men with both words and actions, while Bourlamaque and Bougainville sustained injuries but continued fighting. As more troops approached the wooden barrier, the battle intensified, with the center of the conflict focused on the valiant battalions of Béarn and Guienne.

The battle raged for hours, feeling like days to Robert as British and Colonial forces relentlessly charged the wooden wall, only to be thwarted by French fire. The field was littered with the fallen, a testament to France's military triumph in the New World. Twilight descended, casting a scarlet glow over the victors and the fallen alike.

He woke up and rubbed his eyes to block out the image of the battlefield and his disappointment. The memory was still vivid and haunting. He decided to avoid dwelling on it to prevent feeling too gloomy. He stood up and headed south, but the forest grew denser and the terrain rougher. Feeling weak, he couldn't think clearly and lost his sense of direction. He aimlessly wandered until he felt hopeless. Alone and unarmed in the wilderness, he was in a dire situation. Looking around for guidance, he noticed a bright blue flash from a small bird. Remembering a past experience of following a bird to safety, he wondered if it was luck or intervention. The bird led him south, filling him with hope and strength. As dawn approached, the bird disappeared, and he heard footsteps. An unexpected voice nearby revealed familiar faces, bringing comfort. They decided to focus on future victories rather than past defeats, surrounded by a peaceful forest awakening to a new day.|['1.
