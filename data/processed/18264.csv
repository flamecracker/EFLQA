Corny disagreed with Mulgate's plan to take Florry on the sailboat, stating that she had no interest in Mulgate. They all walked to the boat in the dark. Captain Carboneer believed that Mulgate was causing trouble and endangering their mission. He insisted that women couldn't be on naval vessels during wartime. Captain Carboneer was disgusted with Mulgate's romantic intentions during a patriotic duty. The tide was rising, allowing them to move the boat. Captain Carboneer refused to let Florry be a passenger on the war vessel. He planned to drop them off at Bermuda or Nassau and wouldn't risk running the blockade. Captain Carboneer believed Mulgate's plan was absurd and that he couldn't handle the ship without his help.

Mulgate appeared lost in thought, likely pondering the repercussions of his failed plan due to involving a woman. Captain Carboneer, a composed naval officer, headed towards the road, half a mile from the river. He swiftly decided to abandon the scheme upon Mulgate's change of heart. The captain suggested a visit to the Bellevite to gather information. Mulgate suggested sending Corny back to keep watch. Corny, familiar with the yacht, prepared to set sail. Captain Carboneer, with a crew ready, aimed to seize control of the Bellevite promptly.

"He was likely thinking of the beautiful Miss Florry in the elegant mansion up the river. He was Major Pierson, known by the naval officer. He had met Miss Florry at Glenfield Plantation and his visit to the North might have been with her in mind. He was very interested in her, despite her being a ""Yankee"" and a millionaire's daughter. Major Pierson was taken aback when the naval officer hinted at capturing the Bellevite that night. He seemed dissatisfied with the officer's promptness. He pondered how to manage Miss Florry, possibly waiting in the estate grounds. Corny delivered a message about measuring a gun-carriage, and the Florence was secured to the ship.

The major acknowledged that the person they encountered mistook him for Christy Passford, whom the major had dealt with before. The major recalled his past efforts to prevent the Bellevite from escaping Mobile Bay, describing Christy as clever and fortunate not to be present.

Mrs. Passford assured her daughter, Florry, that her father was safe on his boat, confident he was occupied with the steamer situation. Suddenly, a navy chief engineer entered, familiar with the family. Dressed in uniform, he greeted the ladies. Florry blushed, catching his eye. Christy, the boat owner, had cleverly designed the boat's cabin to serve as a parlor, bedroom, and dining area. The cabin was a marvel, with double doors secured by a mortise-lock. Despite the cabin's allure, Captain Carboneer didn't attempt to enter, focused on his own mission. The skipper, Christy, cleverly hid in a compartment under a cook's box, waiting for developments regarding the Bellevite. The yacht's fuel locker, though empty, held spare sails and charcoal. Christy, in his boating attire, patiently waited, observing a boat with three men rowing nearby.|"[""1.

The gentle breeze pushed the Florence along the river as Christy lounged on the cushioned seat near the wheel. His return from the Bellevite cruise had left him unusually idle. Spotting a boat with two oarsmen, he barely moved to avoid them. As the boat neared, he recognized a gentleman from Nassau who had shown interest in the Bellevite for the Confederate navy. After a brief encounter, Christy steered away. Later, he beached the Florence near his father's estate, observing two familiar figures on the shore. Eavesdropping discreetly, he learned of their plan to take control of the Florence and visit the Bellevite. Alarmed, Christy secured the boat and hid, overhearing their intentions to seize the Florence. When his cousin Corny appeared, Christy realized he was involved in their scheme.

When Christy finished his preparations, he felt confident he wouldn't be discovered. The three plotters came aboard, unaware that Christy could hear every word through a small opening. He learned their intentions but remained hidden. When they planned to capture the ship, Christy, alarmed, crept up to the deck and locked himself in the cabin to think. Hearing the furnace roar below, he feared the ship might sail under a Confederate flag. To save himself, Christy decided to jump into the river if needed. He avoided the plotters, saw them leave on the Florence, and warned Sampson about the conspiracy. Sampson, confused, had mistaken another person for Christy.

"The midshipman explained his plan to his friends, who now called him ""middy."" He had a gun aimed at a spot on the river where Captain Carboneer's steamer would pass.

Christy instructed Paul to gather the crew members needed for their mission aboard the Bellevite. They rode fleet horses to the town where they met the quartermasters and other essential personnel. After securing their services, they were cautioned to keep quiet about their mission. Mr. Watts was eager to participate and was directed to meet the group at the designated spot. Christy and Paul rode along the river, planning their strategy to defend the ship against potential enemies. Christy carefully positioned fireworks along the shore to signal the arrival of the enemy's steamer. Mr. Watts was tasked with igniting the fireworks when the time came. The group prepared for the impending confrontation, ensuring they were ready to defend the Bellevite.|"['1.

After Christy explained the plan to the steward, they set out on their mission down the river. The steward was to light a signal to confirm the approaching steamer was indeed the Vampire. Christy was cautious not to harm any innocent citizens onboard. As they waited, the sound of the approaching steamer indicated it was about a mile away. Christy knew the river well and assessed the distance accurately. He was concerned about the potential consequences of engaging with Captain Carboneer's party and risking the safety of the Bellevite's crew. Christy understood the dangers of a possible encounter and the limitations of his crew. Despite the risks, they waited anxiously for the Vampire to come into view around the bend, hoping to avoid a confrontation that could lead to dire consequences.|"[""1.

After securing his horse, Christy lit a match to check the time - it was a quarter past one. The Vampire, though slow, appeared around the bend, moving at a mere four miles per hour. Despite the darkness, Christy discerned no men on board. The steward, uneasy, hid as Christy positioned himself by the water's edge. The noise of the approaching Vampire indicated it was unsuitable for the conspirators' plan. Christy observed the ship closely. He overheard conversations, gathering crucial information. When asked about the crew, Christy cleverly inflated the numbers. After a brief exchange, Christy rode back to the Roman candles' location, urging Mr. Watts to follow instructions precisely.

Christy, the acting commander of the ship Bellevite, was preparing for a decisive event. He had arranged signals with Mr. Watts to take down the steamer Vampire. As the crucial moment approached, Christy aimed the long gun towards the bend in the river where the Vampire would appear. He had confidence in his skills but was open to advice. Christy sought the opinion of Boxie, an experienced sailor, on his plan. As the clock ticked past two, the Vampire was expected to show up. Christy, nervous about the delay, wondered if the enemy had encountered trouble. The crew was on high alert, ready to fire the gun at the right moment under Christy's command. Despite his confidence, Christy remained humble and willing to learn from others.|"['1.

The quiet on the ship was heavy and tense as everyone braced for the impending danger. The Bellevite faced capture with a determined enemy ahead. The fate of the ship lay in the hands of a young boy, who everyone trusted. Suddenly, a faint light caught Christy's eye, signaling the impending attack. As fireworks illuminated the night, the conspirators were taken aback by the sudden exposure. Christy acted swiftly, firing a shot that caused a massive explosion, shaking the surroundings. The smoke obscured the view momentarily, but as it cleared, Christy noticed Roman candles at the signal station. Despite the victory, there was a lingering threat of the enemies regrouping. The situation was tense, and the safety of the passengers hung in the balance.|"[""1.

"""Get ready, Paul, we're leaving now!"" Christy exclaimed, energized. ""Boxie, release the cable. You marked it, right?"" he directed, hurrying to the pilot-house with Beeks and Thayer. The signal lights were out at the river bend, concealing any view. The Vampire wreckage had drifted downstream, with limited details known besides the damaged walking-beam. Christy, uncertain of the enemy's status, felt uneasy about the journey ahead. Despite doubts, he ordered the ship to move. With his family onboard, he prepared to face any challenges. As the Bellevite approached the bend, Christy hoped to avoid confrontation with the disabled Vampire. The enemy's potential boarding attempt loomed, but Christy was determined to defend his ship.

Shortly after, the ship changed course to pass by the Vampire. Christy left the pilot-house to get a better view of the enemy's actions. It wasn't too dark for him to see what was happening on the enemy's deck as they were passing close by. Sampson and the crew gathered near Christy, armed as instructed by Paul Vapoor. The enemy was loading a boat on the port side of the Vampire, appearing to be in a hurry. Christy ordered to place solid shot on the plankshear. As the Bellevite approached the wreck, the enemy's boat darted out. Captain Carboneer was seen in the boat, and they began shooting at the Bellevite. Christy, standing on the rail, drew his revolver. The enemy's boat approached, and Boxie fired a shot that missed. The enemy's boat was held by a bowman, but it drifted astern. A man climbed aboard using a rope attached to Sampson's boat. Christy, targeted by the enemy, lifted and threw a solid shot into the enemy's boat, causing damage and taking down an enemy.|"[""1.

Christy shouted to lay hold of the man climbing aboard with a weapon. The crew secured the man, believed to be Haslett, tying his hands and fastening him to the rail. Christy praised Boxie for his effort. The ship had repelled the boarders trying to take control. Christy, elated with the victory, assured his mother of their safety. He explained the attack and the enemy's failure. Christy then left to steer the ship. The crew took a prisoner, likely to provide more information. Christy moved his mother and sister to a comfortable spot, checking the ship's position. The steamer was heading to New York at a moderate speed. Sampson brought the prisoner, still bound, to Christy, who was focused on his family.|"['1.

"As soon as he laid eyes on the prisoner, he stepped back in amazement, though there was no real reason to be surprised. It wasn't Mr. Haslett or Captain Carboneer, but Major Lindley Pierson, the former commandant of Fort Gaines. Christy was taken aback because he hadn't expected to encounter Major Pierson. ""And equally unexpected for me, especially meeting the ladies,"" the prisoner remarked, bowing to Mrs. Passford and her daughter. ""I had hoped to see Mrs. and Miss Passford before heading back South."" The young officer added, ""Captain Carboneer is quite stubborn and opposed to having women aboard a warship. I respect his views, though they might not matter to you. I hold Captain Carboneer in high regard as a solid and respectable man. By the way, Major Pierson, who is he?"" The prisoner frowned at the midshipman but restrained himself in the presence of the ladies. ""I am your captive, Captain Passford, and the tables have turned. I can't provide information to aid my country's enemies,"" the prisoner expressed. ""But I don't think you will try to take over this ship after I have treated you fairly. I plan to treat you honorably, despite the circumstances. Now, can you answer a couple of questions that won't be considered treason?""

The boat from the ship was lowered into the water, and a few experienced sailors got in. The women were helped to their seats, and Christy, after telling the engineer he was in charge, jumped in and went to the nearest pier. A carriage was called, and they all went to the hotel. Christy found his father still getting dressed. Excitedly, Christy shared his dream where they captured a high-ranking prisoner on board, guarded by Sampson. His mother and sister were waiting in the parlor. Christy mentioned others dreaming too, like Mr. Watts and Paul Vapoor. After dressing quickly, Captain Passford joined the ladies in the parlor. They discussed an attempt to take control of the ship. Later, they headed to the pier, bringing food for the crew. On board, Christy explained the situation, and the captain arranged for a military officer to take the prisoner. They decided to return to Bonnydale on the ship. The investigating party on the Alert recognized the Bellevite and followed her to the anchorage. Captain Passford warned them to keep their distance until he understood their intentions.|['1.

A boat from the Alert arrived with two men, and Captain Mainhill, a wealthy and patriotic man, boarded the Bellevite. Captain Passford was cautious at first, fearing they might be from the Southern Confederacy. They discussed the enemy's actions and the damaged boat, Vampire. They decided to return home. Captain Passford requested to be shown to a wounded man's house. They found Corny there, in pain but glad to see them. He was moved to Bonnydale for treatment. Major Pierson, still on the Bellevite, was treated well but not welcome. Captain Passford, trying to be polite, informed Major Pierson that he couldn't hold him as a prisoner.

On the Bellevite, additional crew had returned, ensuring constant watch to prevent escape or capture by Captain Carboneer. After being treated by Dr. Linscott, Corny recovered slowly and was eventually paroled. The missing crew intended for the Bellevite remained a mystery. The ship was taken to the Navy Yard for preparations, with familiar officers and crew appointed. The vessel underwent significant alterations, including a heavier armament. Various crew members were appointed to key positions, with Captain Breaker reinstated as commander. Captain Passford withdrew his application for service to support the cause from home. Christy Passford received a letter from his father, detailing a mission regarding an iron steamer from Ireland bound for the Bermudas, which he eagerly anticipated.|[]|[]
Before the Bellevite set sail on a secret mission, Christy, a young officer on board, handed his father's letter to Captain Breaker. The captain revealed that they were to hunt down blockade runners approaching the coast. As the ship neared the Bermudas, they spotted the Killbright, a fast steamer. To avoid detection, the Bellevite stopped its engines and waited. The crew, well-trained in naval tactics, stood ready for action. Despite the challenges of the mission, Captain Breaker was confident in his skilled crew. Christy, determined to prove himself on merit, was prepared for whatever dangers lay ahead, having already faced enemy fire. As the tense standoff with the Killbright unfolded, the crew of the Bellevite remained vigilant and prepared for the unfolding events.|"['1.

Every man stood at their post on the ship, ready at the midship gun, with Christy taking command like a seasoned sailor. The other guns were loaded simultaneously, while Paul Vapoor worked diligently to increase the speed of the Bellevite. The captain estimated a rival steamer five miles ahead, possibly the swift Killbright. The crew was determined to catch up, despite the challenging weather and the rival ship's speed. As night fell, the chase ship turned off its lights, adding to the mystery of the pursuit. The crew remained vigilant, doubling the lookouts, but the changing weather and the chase ship's maneuvers made the situation tense.

As the wise ones had predicted, the shower was brief. Once the fog cleared, a lookout was kept for the chase. Captain Breaker was confident she hadn't outsailed them. Several officers climbed the rigging to spot the sail, about ten miles away. The ship was turned southward towards the reported steamer. A streak of black smoke was spotted, heading for the U.S. coast. The Bellevite sped up, closing in on the rival steamer. Boxie anticipated a showdown soon. The chase, a sleek vessel with two masts and smokestacks, was like a pirate ship. It was clear the rival captain intended to fight. A shot was fired but missed. The Bellevite closed in, aiming to capture the valuable steamer intact. Christy, ready for action, ordered to fire at the rival ship. The Bellevite closed in, prepared to overpower the chase.|['1.

The Bellevite was chasing a damaged vessel, aiming to capture it. The crew prepared to board the enemy ship in three divisions. Each officer led a group of men armed with muskets, revolvers, and cutlasses. As they neared the enemy, the engineers on the damaged ship tried to repair their engine. The Bellevite slowed down, ready to board. Christy Passford was the first to jump onto the enemy's deck, finding only about thirty men. Suddenly, the damaged ship, the Killbright, unexpectedly sped away, firing its guns at the Bellevite. The two ships were enveloped in smoke, and the situation was unclear. The crew of the Killbright reloaded their guns, signaling that the battle was far from over.|"['1.

The Killbright sped away from the Bellevite, firing its guns with untrained crew. Christy, a lieutenant on the Bellevite, noted the chaos on the Killbright. Despite the Bellevite causing damage, it did not close in for boarding. Christy and his quartermaster felt like prisoners as the Killbright, a Confederate ship, kept its distance. The Bellevite, unmoved, was shot at but remained unharmed. Christy pondered the situation, feeling uncertain about their fate. As officers inspected the Killbright, Christy recognized the commander, Captain Carboneer. The Bellevite, repaired and approaching, fired a shot. Captain Carboneer allowed Christy to move freely on the Yazoo, knowing the Bellevite's firepower. Christy realized that defeating the Yazoo would require extreme measures, unsure of the outcome as the chase continued.|['1.

Christy and Beeks sat in the ship's wardroom below deck. The room seemed converted from a passenger ship's dining area, indicating the vessel was originally a British steam-yacht. Despite being smaller than the Bellevite, the pursuing ship, the Yazoo, was struggling to escape. The Bellevite was closing in, firing shots that damaged the Yazoo. As the situation grew more hopeful for Christy and Beeks, a hand-to-hand struggle ensued on the Yazoo's deck as the Bellevite attempted to board. Captain Carboneer, injured and pale, was assisted to his cabin. Christy expressed gratitude to him for preventing Florry Passford's abduction.

Christy hurried to the deck and was warmly greeted by his fellow officers. He promptly reported to Captain Breaker and was congratulated on his safe return. He quickly resumed his duties. Paul Vapoor was so pleased to see him that he almost hugged him. The captured ship was inspected and deemed fit for travel, with Mr. Blowitt appointed as the prize-master to sail it to New York. After making necessary repairs, the Bellevite patrolled for a month before being stationed at Mobile Bay. The crew captured a few vessels, but the officers were disappointed by the lack of action. Christy learned from his father that the Bellevite might soon be tasked as a cruiser, lifting the crew's spirits.

The lieutenant carefully studied the charts and Coast Pilot, learning that the Teaser might not be able to navigate Santa Rosa Sound due to its shallow depth. Even during spring tides, the water only rose a few inches above two feet. Realizing the Teaser's limitations, he shared his findings with Captain Breaker. Flint, known for minding his own business, accompanied him as they explored Santa Rosa Island. The desolate island led them to Pensacola Bay, where they could barely see through the mist. After a two-mile row, Christy directed the crew to head back slowly, aware that heavy work might lie ahead.

The mate lay on the sand, puzzling Christy. He wondered if Flint was unwell. Christy listened closely, hearing distant noises but couldn't discern them.

In just thirty minutes, the expedition team heard sounds from the island ahead. The noises indicated work happening at the entrance. The workers were too loud to notice the approaching boat. Apart from the familiar sounds, they heard steam escaping, confirming a steamer's presence. Christy used his ears to detect more than one steamer. As the boat neared, they heard hammering and orders. Christy suspected they were water guards expecting a different route. Approaching the Teaser, they saw a sleek, fast steamer. Christy urged the crew to prepare for any confrontation.

As soon as Beeks heard Captain Westover's name, everything became clear to him. He realized that the Chinese lingo was part of their plan. The army and navy officers had been discussing something important when they arrived on the island. Now, Beeks understood their intentions.

Christy suggested a plan to Captain Breaker to capture some men arriving on the island. The Captain appointed him as prize-master for the mission. Christy, though a bit disappointed, accepted the role with dedication. The Teaser was prepared with forty men, including Mr. Blowitt, to head towards the island. The group was unsure about the firing sounds from the island. Christy believed the enemy might attack Fort Pickens.

Christy, a second lieutenant, found himself in a perilous situation as he realized he had fallen into a trap set by Lonley, a privateersman. Lonley's plan was to recapture the Teaser, a steamer, and he had successfully captured Christy and his colleague, Flint. Christy understood the gravity of the situation and tried to resist, but Lonley and his men overpowered them. The privateersmen swiftly took control and aimed to deceive the Union forces by sending boats away from the Teaser to create an opportunity for recapture. Christy, despite being a victim of the scheme, remained optimistic that the plan would ultimately fail. Lonley's cunning leadership and strategic planning were evident as the boats silently disappeared into the darkness and fog, leaving Christy and Flint as prisoners, hoping for a chance to turn the tide in their favor.|"[""1.

Christy watched from the shore as the Teaser was under attack, regretting not being on board. Despite being a prisoner, he maintained his composure, reflecting on the art of deception in warfare. Meanwhile, Lonley, the privateersman, believed his men would succeed in overtaking the Teaser. However, to his dismay, news arrived that the steamer had been captured. Christy, though tied up, expressed a desire to help, but Lonley took a canoe to assist those in need. As Lonley returned to shore with two survivors, the reality of defeat sank in.

Flint, not as daring as Christy, was hesitant about their escape plan. However, Christy, the midshipman, was determined to lead the way. Christy convinced Flint to join by taking off their shoes and positioning themselves under a scuttle on the roof. Christy climbed on Flint's shoulders to reach the scuttle and carefully opened it. But when Christy tried to pull Flint up, he couldn't do it quietly due to the fear of making noise. So, they used a box and handkerchiefs to lift Flint onto the roof without a sound.

Christy gained recognition for aiding the Bellevite in May. The loss of the Teaser would soon be in the newspapers, and the Bellevite would not be pleased. Christy decided to head there to address two issues at once. They set out on a long walk, avoiding their uniforms to remain inconspicuous. They explored the roof, seeking access. Using a lever made from a joist and bricks, they opened a scuttle. After descending, they navigated through the building and exited to find a boat.

Flint cautioned Christy about the danger of being there, but Christy planned to board the schooner loaded with cotton to run the blockade.

But this was all he was allowed to say. At that moment, a handspike wielded by Flint struck his head, causing him to collapse on the deck. Simultaneously, Christy leaped to the wheel, preventing the schooner from veering. Ignoring the hails of a nearby boat, the vessel surged forward, picking up speed. In the darkness, the real Mr. Fetters on the boat couldn't see how Captain Lonley was dealt with, as the crew was occupied upfront. Mr. Fetters presumed the Judith was gathering supplies, unfazed by the situation. The imposter Mr. Fetters maintained his position at the wheel, steering accurately towards the bay entrance. With a sense of duty, he felt no guilt over taking control of the ship and its cargo. He then moved Lonley's unconscious body to a cabin, securing important papers and revolvers. After ensuring Lonley was alive, he prepared to navigate the Judith through enemy lines towards Fort Morgan.|"[""1.

In a short while, Christy anchored near the Bellevite and sent Flint to check on Lonley's condition. Christy then reported on board using a boat they had captured, towed by two of the crew. The surgeon was sent to the Judith. When Paul Vapoor saw the third lieutenant return, he warmly greeted him. Captain Breaker commended Christy for his bravery and skills, assuring him of recognition. Lonley was taken on board the Bellevite for medical care. Christy was appointed prize-master of the Teaser, and Flint of the schooner. Both ships were headed to New York, with the Teaser expected to tow the Judith. Christy had a brief break and shared news of his escape with his family. He advocated for Flint's promotion to his father, who also remembered Sampson for a new role. The government took possession of the prize-steamer for repairs and upgrades.
