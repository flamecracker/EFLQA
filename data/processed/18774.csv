Robert expressed his opinion to Mr. Huysman, acknowledging that they seemed to be allowing the Marquis de Montcalm to dictate the battles. He felt that they were dancing to the Marquis's tune by letting him choose the fields of battle. Robert respected his superiors and hesitated to share his thoughts openly.

Mr. Huysman busily moved around, his large red face shining as Caterina brought more food.

Robert expressed his joy at the prospect of not having a seat at the council for another twenty years, relishing in the freedom and action that awaited him.

Grosvenor felt better as he mingled with a lively group of Virginians and others who shared his English background. He had adapted well to the New World, making friends and leaving dangers behind.

He was surprised by the stranger's bold entrance into Albany, but upon reflection, he realized there was no evidence against him, only Robert's word against his. In the midst of a war, his own tale would sound far-fetched while the stranger's would ring true. However, he was certain of his recognition. He saw the familiar spare, clean-shaven face and the piercing eyes that were etched in his memory. Walking lightly through the crowded room filled with chatter and smoke, he approached the small table where the man sat. Their conversation continued calmly, neither raising their voices. Unperturbed, he rejoined his comrades, observing the slaver's nonchalant exit. A flicker of recognition hinted at a second man, possibly the spy Garay.

Robert was seated with his companions in the inn, listening to Stuart talk about life in the Southern colony of Virginia. Stuart described the grand houses, vast tobacco fields, exciting horse races, and the strong sense of family ties that made Virginia feel like one big clan. As the discussion turned to the merits of Virginia and Pennsylvania, a teamster burst in with alarming news of French advances and attacks on settlers. Robert, drawing on his experience at the Battle of Ticonderoga, calmly corrected the teamster's exaggerated claims, reassuring everyone that while defeated, the colonial army remained strong and Albany was not in immediate danger.

"""Mr. Dobbs, let's seek peace,"" urged Robert. ""Sometimes, a young boy's eyes see clearer than a man's. The Marquis de Montcalm won't reach Albany from Ticonderoga. Wise men stay put, not flee to New York. Remember, don't let panic rule you. Rumors grow with each telling. Let's learn from our losses. The French won't come closer to Albany. The war's path leads to Quebec. Courage, not fear, guides us. Things aren't as dire as they seem."" The crowd cheered, and Robert, blushing, sat down.

"""The Royal Americans are great soldiers,"" Robert remarked. ""Even though they are from the colonies, they are as skilled as the British regulars. I had a close friend in one of their regiments, Edward Charteris from New York, but he got captured at Ticonderoga by the French. I think they're holding him in Quebec now."" The group split up, planning to meet in Albany. Grosvenor and the Pennsylvanians headed to camp, Cabell and Stuart back to the George for quarters, and Robert and Tayoga towards Mynheer Jacobus Huysman's house.

Robert emphasized the importance of prudence to his companions. He explained how any insult to a man who is a friend of a great Indian chieftain is seen as a double insult to the chieftain. This often leads to swift retaliation, even if just a glance is perceived as a provocation. As they explored the bustling river port of Albany, they observed the increased activity due to the pressures of war. Many boats were ferrying supplies and goods, reflecting the city's thriving trade. Despite their search for a suspicious slaver's ship, the river locals were forthcoming but couldn't identify any vessel matching the description. Tayoga suspected a deeper plot involving hidden motives, while Robert acknowledged the spy's potential for vengeance. The trio decided to seek refuge at Mynheer Jacobus's house, where they were warmly welcomed. Tayoga's keen observation skills revealed the recent presence of heavy men in the room, deducing their restless movements from the faint traces left on the polished floor.|"['1.

They moved occasionally during their important conversation, taking breaks to smoke and think. Even though Caterina opened the windows to clear the smoke, traces of it lingered low in the room's corners and under the chairs. Some ash from their pipes remained on the table, indicating the room still needed cleaning. Master McLean, a heavy smoker, used potent Virginia tobacco, leaving a distinct scent. The aroma of Mynheer Jacobus's tobacco was strongest by the mantel, suggesting he frequently stood there during the discussion. The Onondaga detected the scents of both men's tobacco on a locked chest of drawers, indicating they had visited to share papers. Robert respected their privacy, believing the papers might concern him but refraining from prying. He concluded that the papers likely didn't relate to the council's discussions, as the strong tobacco scents of Jacobus and Hardy suggested they had spent more time in the room after the others had left.|"['1.

Robert and Tayoga, in their room, found their clothes stored in camphor and swiftly changed. Standing by the window, gazing out at the delightful estate where they had shared many joyful moments, both felt a warm glow.

"""We often believe that today's youth is not as good as when we were young,"" Mr. Hardy remarked. ""This is a common human tendency. But Master McLean has a unique perspective. With forty years of experience guiding young people, he surely has insights. What do you think, Alexander?"" 

""Youth is youth,"" the schoolmaster responded thoughtfully. ""I mean exactly that. I believe it remains consistent across generations. The youth of today resembles that of ancient Babylon. In my classroom, I see similarities between this year's youth and that of ten, twenty, or even forty years ago.""

""Generally, I see it as self-centeredness. Youth's world revolves around itself, not looking beyond,"" he continued. ""We adults exist to serve youth. We are secondary to the main fact, which is youth itself."" 

""It's a timeless truth,"" the schoolmaster added. ""This self-absorption defines youth, giving it charm and simplicity. I wouldn't change it if I could, as it adds to youth's appeal.""

""Age is a mindset,"" Mr. Hervey chimed in. ""Beliefs vary at different ages, and each age considers its beliefs true. We can't judge the wisdom of different ages by the same standards. I agree with Mr. McLean that youth's character shouldn't be altered. Looking back at my youth, I find humor in it, but back then, it was real and valid.""

The sachems we sit with are not chiefs leading battles but rather planners like sachems and makers of charms like medicine men, influencing warriors' and leaders' souls. The English's wise policy of honest dealings with native people has earned the great League credit. While the French excel at winning over indigenous groups, the English have managed well with the Six Nations. The Chevalier de St. Luc, a dangerous foe, is highly regarded for his gallant nature. Known for his mastery in forest warfare and devoted following, he advised Montcalm during battles.

A faint light seeped through an uncovered window into the room. Robert intended to wait for Tayoga but halted at the doorway, struck by a surprising sight. A figure, resembling the spy Garay, moved silently in the room. Garay knelt by the chest of drawers, attempting to open the third one. Startled, Robert watched as Garay swiftly vanished through the window upon hearing a noise Robert accidentally made. Unsure if it was a ghost or an illusion, Robert checked the drawer with new scratches on the lock, evidence of Garay's intrusion. Though tempted to inform Mr. Huysman, Robert hesitated, fearing disbelief. He decided to discuss the incident with Tayoga instead. Tayoga suggested the papers in the drawer were significant, possibly related to a plot against Robert. Despite the mystery, Tayoga advised patience and caution.|"['1.

To be a successful spy, one must possess skills in lockpicking and swift movements, as demonstrated by Garay's actions. Despite scratching his hand while escaping through a window, he left behind blood drops and footprints that Dagaeoga and his companion followed northward. The soft ground from yesterday's rain aided in tracking Garay's path as he navigated through fields and forests, trying to avoid detection. Garay's frustration at the failed attempt was evident in his actions, leaving behind broken splinters and knee imprints near a brook where he stopped to drink. Tayoga's keen tracking skills led them through fields and woods, eventually nearing the river where Garay's trail seemed to head next.|"['1.

The Onondaga swiftly pulled Robert down to the ground as a bullet narrowly missed him. Tayoga realized that the slaver and Garay were hidden in a boat among the bushes near the water's edge. Another shot was fired, this time from a rifle, indicating they were under serious threat. Tayoga advised Robert to crawl to safety behind the trees, but Robert insisted on taking a shot at their attackers. Despite the danger, Tayoga refrained from firing back.

The river's surface shimmered in the moonlight, revealing shades of silver and deep blue. Across from Robert, the clump of bushes concealed the slaver and spy. As Robert scanned for enemies, a rifle shot rang out, narrowly missing him. Startled, he realized the danger. With no weapon, he relied on moral support from Tayoga. The night grew quiet, tempting him to sleep despite the looming threat. Suddenly, a pistol shot jolted him awake. Tayoga had fired at the bushes, prompting the hidden foes to flee.

They rowed into the middle of the river and drifted downstream. Robert felt confident on the Onondaga, believing they had overcome past dangers and would conquer future ones. The gray skies cleared as dawn painted the river in rose and gold hues. Albany's buildings emerged under the morning light. Tayoga suggested returning to the wilderness, deeming it safer than the town. They reached Albany, where Caterina welcomed them joyfully. Mr. Huysman and Mr. Hardy were relieved to hear their tale.

Despite his efforts, the shadow remained just out of reach, taunting him with its presence. Just as Robert thought he had the spy cornered, a sudden blow to his head sent him spiraling into darkness.

Robert felt ill. The plan was to sell him as a slave in the West Indies. Kidnapping was common in both the Old World and the New.

He was an excellent sailor, and the increasing wind was in his favor. Despite being wounded, the schooner had managed to outmaneuver the pursuing ship.

Robert remained silent, acknowledging the captain's words as true. A sudden strong gust of wind propelled the schooner forward swiftly, leaving the sloop behind. The gap widened between the two ships, with the sloop's flag disappearing into the dusk. The captain, bloodied and energetic, urged his men to clear the wreckage and dispose of the fallen. Despite the grim scene, the captain exuded confidence, pointing to the unscathed black flag as a sign of luck. Robert, previously unnoticed, joined the crew in clearing the debris, realizing his survival depended on cooperation.

The captain looked worried and turned away, focusing on saving the ship. Robert saw that the schooner was in bad shape after being attacked by the sloop. It was clear she was sinking fast. The captain talked with Stubbs, the second mate, and they both saw the dire situation. Robert felt the weight of his own fate, not wanting to die or be sold into slavery. Despite the storm and sinking ship, he held onto hope, believing that Tayoga's Tododaho was watching over him. The captain decided they needed to abandon the ship soon. One boat capsized, and all aboard were lost. The others hesitated but had to take the risk, knowing the water was rising on the sinking schooner.|"[""1.

The captain, a skilled seaman and leader, despite being wounded, ensured the boats were provisioned with water, arms, and food. In a daring move, Stubbs and his crew were lowered into one of the boats, braving a great wave that threatened to capsize it. Miraculously, they righted the boat and disappeared into the darkness. The unwounded men cheered faintly as the long boat was launched with care. Robert, feeling a newfound comradeship, helped lower two wounded sailors into the boat before joining them. With the captain steering towards a distant island, the crew battled the stormy sea, clinging to life. As the storm subsided, the crew took turns rowing, relieved that the danger of overturning had lessened. Robert, sore and weary, found solace in the thought of reaching the tropical island ahead, a beacon of hope in the darkness of the sea.|['1.

"Always fearless, his main trait was igniting within him. He appeared to have earned the respect of the leader and was unafraid of the crew. Stranded together, chances to flee the island would arise.

A faint light broke through the dark clouds at dawn, but it didn't bring hope. The sea was rough, no land in sight. A wounded man, worse than they knew, passed away. His body was solemnly cast overboard. Robert understood the necessity but was still shocked. Another man, disoriented by danger, claimed they were doomed. The captain, determined, assured them they would reach land. As they approached the island, the captain steered through treacherous rocks.

An opening appeared in the line of reefs, and the boat swiftly moved towards it. The captain yelled, but the message was lost. Suddenly, a strong current pulled them leftward. Black rocks loomed overhead, and the boat scraped against them, tearing a side off, throwing them into the sea. Acting on instinct, Robert fought the water, struggling towards a sandy beach.

Robert emerged from his trance, a mix of mental and physical effects, and rose to his feet. The air was heavy with clouds and the wind howled in anger. Rain fell, but Robert paid it no mind, already drenched by the sea. The wild waves crashed onto the shore, creating a desolate scene.

Robert found the remnants of their boat, shattered and half-buried in sand. Despite hoping to repair it, a closer look revealed it was too damaged to fix, forcing him to abandon the idea of escape. As he ventured south, he discovered wild banana groves with ripe fruit. Moving inland, he crossed low hills covered in thick vegetation, staying alert for wild animals. Hearing heavy footsteps, he readied his rifle, only to find a herd of wild cattle. Pleased by the potential food source, he decided to let them graze undisturbed. Robert then stumbled upon a blue lake with fish, but left them be for now.

The boat leaned to the side, missing its sails and spars, held in place by sand and rocks. Robert, driven by curiosity, boarded it, carefully navigating the slanted, slippery deck. Discovering a potential treasure trove, he scavenged the captain's and mates' cabins for supplies, hauling them to the beach. He then raided the carpenter's tools, the cook's galley for provisions, and even the ship's armory. Working tirelessly until midnight, he transported his findings ashore, securing them under a tarpaulin. Using a dinghy found on the ship, he ferried his precious cargo to his house across the island, making multiple trips. Reluctant to abandon the vessel completely, he continued to strip it of valuable tools, weapons, clothing, and ammunition, leaving behind items that could be useful in emergencies.|"['1.

He carried his newfound treasures across the island and safeguarded them in the boat, which he found invaluable. After weeks of hard work, he rarely felt lonely during the day but struggled at night. Despite his solitude, he focused on his survival essentials - shelter, food, and weapons. He pondered deeply about his identity, convinced that certain individuals held answers. He planned to unravel the mystery of his past after the war. Observing the conflict from a distance, he believed in England's victory due to its superior might.

Fishing brought some enjoyment to Robert on the island. He used the ship's supplies to catch fish in the large lake and tried deep-sea fishing from a dinghy, but the big fish bit too quickly to hold his interest. The fish added variety to his meals, and he also gathered shellfish along the shore. Robert often climbed the island's highest hill to scan the sea with binoculars, hoping for a rescue ship. He considered lighting a bonfire for rescue but feared attracting pirates common in the area. Despite the pleasant weather, Robert remained cautious, opting to swim within the reefs after spotting a fin in the water. One day, he mistook a cloud for a sail, signaling an approaching storm, prompting him to seek shelter in the house.|['1.

Robert managed to secure the door just before a fierce storm hit. The powerful winds and rain lashed against the sturdy house, causing it to tremble and shake, but it held its ground. Despite the howling storm outside, Robert found solace in watching the chaos from a small window on the eastern side of the house. The hurricane raged on, with thunder and lightning adding to the spectacle. Trees and bushes were uprooted and debris struck the house, yet it remained standing. As the storm gradually subsided into a steady rain, Robert, feeling safe and dry, drifted off to sleep. The next day, he discovered the wreckage of a ship that had been destroyed by the storm. Determined to preserve his belongings, Robert returned to his makeshift shelter, where he encountered a shark and successfully hunted it down. Inspired by the hunt, Robert decided to face the challenge of hunting the wild cattle on the island for both fresh meat and excitement.|['1.

Robert knew he would likely find cattle near the big lake. As expected, he spotted a herd of nearly fifty grazing by the eastern edge. Two fierce old bulls with long, sharp horns guarded the outskirts while the rest grazed near the water. Robert, skilled from his time with Willet and Tayoga, crept down through the woods, eyeing a fat young cow. The bulls sensed danger, but Robert aimed carefully. He shot the cow, but it didn't go down. Determined, he chased the wounded animal, only to face the angry bull. In a sudden attack, the bull knocked Robert out. Thankfully, he woke with just bruises, grateful for surviving the thrilling hunt.|['1. What did Robert expect to find near the big lake?\nA) Horses\nB) Cattle\nC) Deer\nD) Sheep\nE) Pigs', '2.

The herd had vanished, but the cow Robert had picked lay lifeless. Realizing he had been out for only a few minutes, he decided to use the fresh meat. With his strength returning, he skillfully prepared the cow, hanging the meat in a thicket to keep it safe from scavengers. He cooked some tender steaks over coals and baked bread from ship flour to enjoy a satisfying meal. Despite being grateful for his survival, he missed his companions, Willet and Tayoga, who were likely searching for him. Robert's desire to join the war against Canada weighed heavily on him, feeling left out on the island. To keep busy, he embarked on a hunt for wild cattle, eventually finding the bull that had injured him. Despite having the opportunity for revenge, he chose not to harm the bull, feeling it was not at fault. Robert's sense of dignity and righteousness were upheld, and he returned to his house to organize his belongings with care.|"['1.

In a small chest, Robert discovered a treasure trove of books that included Shakespeare's plays, works by Beaumont and Fletcher, Congreve, Marlowe, and classics like Virgil, Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, and Ovid. With ample time on his hands, Robert immersed himself in reading, contemplating the themes of gods' cruelty in Homer's epics and the flawed characters in Virgil's tales. Despite finding solace in Monsieur Rollin's historical accounts, he also engaged in action-packed pursuits like hunting wild cattle and sharks. While Robert found comfort and inspiration in the books, the relentless isolation weighed heavily on him, leading to moments of despair and frustration.

Despite being alone on his island, Robert's mind remained healthy and sane, always returning to normal. He eagerly awaited the arrival of a ship, certain that it would come like the rolling tide. However, as time passed with no sign of a sail, he began to suspect his island's isolation. Despite his comfortable life with abundant supplies from a schooner, Robert delved deep into books, broadening his mind and body.

The strong leader returned peacefully to his feeding grounds, and Robert felt that he had been understood. The old bull seemed to realize that Robert meant no harm and they reached a silent understanding. Robert often saw him after that, greeting him from a distance with words of friendship. The old bull would acknowledge him without hostility before resuming his grazing. Robert found solace in these interactions, confiding in the bull from afar. His dinghy became a valuable asset, providing safe harbor during storms. Although he considered sailing to other islands, he deemed it risky due to his boat's size and his lack of sailing experience. Instead, he used the dinghy to retrieve supplies. Grateful for his health and the island's provisions, Robert found comfort in his faith, feeling a connection with the spirits around him.

After the thought of a Christmas dinner was abandoned by his imagination, Robert began to prepare a feast. Ducks were hunted, a young wild cow was slaughtered, and supplies from the ship were used generously. Robert found a pudding among the provisions that he could make delicious. Skilled in cooking, he meticulously attended to every detail. He set a table for four, including plates for his absent friends, Willet, Tayoga, and Grosvenor.

At almost midday, he finally reached the top of the hill. Feeling warm from the climb, he sat on a rock, gazing at the vast horizon through his binoculars. The sea shimmered blue, with a gentle breeze blowing from the southwest. Having brought food, he ate his lunch there. With no specific plans, he decided to spend the afternoon enjoying the view. While relaxing, his mind wandered to Tayoga's belief in spirits in the air, a concept rooted in Indian traditions. He closed his eyes, focusing on evoking sensations in his body through imagination. As he envisioned friendly spirits surrounding him, his senses heightened, and he fancied hearing whispers.

He used the glasses to scan the horizon, watching a ship slowly emerge on the water. The vessel was heading towards the island, a sign of possible rescue.

This was a significant moment in his life, and it needed to be executed properly with attention to every detail. Dressed in an English naval officer's uniform found on the ship, he ventured through the forest towards the inlet. The night was ideal for a rescue and escape from the island, with stars lighting the way. As he approached the beach, he noticed the schooner's mast peeking through the bushes, indicating a boat was being sent ashore.

The welcoming door closed abruptly, and he hurried to secure it from the inside. His intuition warned him urgently. These men must not enter the forest or discover his home and treasures. Luckily, the dinghy was hidden up the creek under the boughs. The outcome relied on chance. If they found the water they sought, they might leave with the schooner by morning. He hoped fervently for this outcome. The boy, once lonely and longing for company, now wished them gone. The men spoke in a foreign language, searching the forest edges.

It was difficult for Robert to distinguish the captain among the group of men who had come ashore. The leader who arrived first appeared to hold the most authority, yet all the men seemed to do as they pleased, accompanied by lots of talking and swearing. Despite this, they efficiently filled the water casks, making Robert hopeful they would leave soon. However, near midnight, one of the boats returned loaded with food and spirits. Robert felt his heart sink as he realized they were planning a feast or a wild party on the beach, likely staying until the next day. The men's behavior filled Robert with horror and disgust. As the storm approached, Robert hoped it would drive the men back to their ship, but they remained unfazed.

The rough men on shore paid no mind to the changing weather. It seemed they hadn't set foot on land in a long while and were enjoying themselves. They feasted and passed around bottles of liquor. Robert, having heard tales of piracy, found himself close to it for the second time. The storm threatened, but the men were unconcerned, planning to stay ashore until the next day. The night grew eerie with vivid lightning and distant thunder, stirring something strange in Robert. He despised the men's actions and wished for Tayoga's presence to instill fear in them. Seizing on their superstitions, Robert imitated an owl's call, causing the men to grow fearful. He felt a connection to the wilderness and embraced a sense of justice, slipping away like a spirit of the woods.|"['1.

Robert, a clever trickster, used his skills to terrify the leader and his men. By imitating the cries of various animals like the owl, bear, panther, and wolf, he instilled fear in the pirates, making them believe in supernatural forces seeking revenge for their crimes.

The brave leader of the ruffians encouraged his men to stand firm against the mysterious dangers lurking nearby. Despite their fear, he rallied them to reload their pistols and face any threat. Robert, inspired by the dramatic, used his skills to instill terror in his enemies. With a chilling groan, he convinced the ruffians of an unseen enemy's presence. Startled, they prepared to flee, but the leader calmed them, dismissing the sounds as mere tricks of the wind.

Robert shivered. He never meant to end the leader's life. Just moments before, he would have said it was impossible. It was only the strong instinct of self-defense that made him strike so fatally, and he regretted it. The man was undoubtedly a criminal who had deserved death many times over, yet Robert was remorseful. To him, taking a life, no matter how wicked, was a tragedy. He returned to the house, fetched a shovel, and buried the body where the waves couldn't reach. Exhausted from the emotional night, he cooked and ate breakfast before falling into a deep sleep. He awoke, grateful for his escape, and spent the day cleaning the island, feeling content in his solitude. He marveled at the beauty of his domain, now free from the pirates.

He walked along the shiny beach, feeling content. After some time, he undressed and swam in the refreshing sea, staying within the safe area away from sharks. Sunbathing on the sand, he then took his boat from its hidden spot and rowed out to sea. He admired his island, a perfect place without dangers, with wild cattle, fish, and supplies from a ship. He felt fortunate to be there, away from pirates. As he rowed back, he saw the wild cattle and the old bull. Startled by a gunshot, the bull ran with the herd.

His reading of the books in the slaver's chest taught him that foolishness and wrongdoing always have consequences, whether immediate or eventual. He recalled the ancient Greek plays he studied under Master Alexander McLean, which emphasized the inevitability of fate. The truth in these old writings endured over two millennia, a testament to their lasting impact. The contrast between Quebec and New York also struck him, noting Quebec's dependence on the state while New York thrived independently. Despite the disparity in courtliness, New York exuded strength and vitality, a promising metropolis. Through solitude and reflection, he gained a mature perspective, recognizing the interplay between a healthy mind and body.

Night fell, and the army, as predicted by Willet, was still on the water, with many feeling seasick. The tall green shores, now shrouded in mist, showed no signs of the French or Indians, but it was certain they were watching from the dense forests. Robert suspected St. Luc's presence and anticipated another clash. They moored their canoe to a long boat and rested briefly on board.

After a short but fierce battle, the American forces heard the silver whistle, signaling the retreat of the French, Canadians, and Indians. The enemies vanished, leaving behind the fallen soldiers.

Tandakora, an Ojibway warrior, slowed his pace and engaged in a tense conversation with Sharp Sword, a notable figure. The Onondaga observer noted their standoff, suspecting unfriendly dialogue. Sharp Sword emphasized unity in defeat and hope for future victories, while Tandakora seemed unconvinced, hinting at retreat. Tandakora's warriors followed him westward, while Sharp Sword aligned with the French and Canadians toward the fortress. Meanwhile, the army advanced towards the formidable Ticonderoga, finding it abandoned. The French had fled to Isle-aux-Noix, leaving a few to defend the fort. After a brief artillery exchange, the French ultimately evacuated, causing a massive explosion as the victorious army took control. Subsequently, the Anglo-American forces discovered the deserted Crown Point, a significant French stronghold.

In the dark forest, Tandakora and his warriors faced a chorus of eerie sounds. The cries of panthers, owls, and bears surrounded them, making the chief shudder with fear.

"""Montcalm and his troops made extensive preparations to defend against General Wolfe,"" Charteris explained. ""I was in Quebec at that time and witnessed their efforts. They constructed earthworks, bastions, and redoubts from Quebec to Montcalm's camp at Beauport. Montcalm's headquarters were initially in a large stone house at Beauport. They blocked the St. Charles River mouth with a log boom secured by chains and two ships with cannons. Forces crossed the river on a boat bridge, guarded by earthworks. The city gates were fortified except for the Palace Gate. They had over a hundred cannons on the walls, a floating battery with twelve guns, gun-boats, and fire ships. About fifteen thousand men were at Beauport, along with militia and Indians. De Ramesay commanded two thousand in the city, making their force nearly twenty thousand, double ours. Despite their militia, we have a strong fleet. Our task is daunting, but I believe we will succeed.""Robert gazed at Quebec, the heart of French power in North America, with great emotion.

Among them, Robert spotted the spy, Garay. He fired at him in the dark but missed. Garay vanished with the others. Robert was relieved that the spy didn't recognize him, preferring to be seen as deceased, thus avoiding danger. After a brief silence, the Château de Chatillard's door reopened. Father Drouillard held a lamp, revealing a dying François de Jumonville, a French officer. As he passed, Father Drouillard prayed for him, while Robert felt compassion, realizing he harbored no hatred. The dying Jumonville's soul departed as the priest finished his prayer. Father Drouillard invited Robert and Willet inside, where they found M. de Chatillard had also passed away, his soul journeying back to a distant past memory. Willet offered assistance with the burial, showing respect for the deceased.|"['1.

Montcalm's army swiftly advanced to the battlefield, passing through Quebec's narrow streets and ancient gates. The seasoned veterans, along with brave Canadians fighting for their homes and beliefs, were eager for another victory. Led by the fierce Tandakora, the Indians thirsted for battle and spoils. Despite divisions in the French councils and lack of support, Montcalm, full of fiery resolve, prepared to face Wolfe's army on the Plains of Abraham. Forming his men into three divisions, Montcalm led the center with Languedoc and Béarn battalions. The British army, aligned and ready, faced the advancing French.

Robert's attention shifted to St. Luc, who rode a white horse, assisting Montcalm in organizing the attack lines. St. Luc held a sword but rarely brandished it. Raindrops hit Robert's face, unnoticed. Sharpshooters intensified their fire, targeting the British, yet Wolfe's army stood firm, awaiting Montcalm's move. French cannons joined rifles and muskets, with Indian war cries piercing the air. Robert sensed a shift in the French lines, shared by Willet. The French army surged forward, veterans and militia united, while Indians flanked them with war cries. Robert, composed, observed the impending clash, the French nearing. Willet noted the French's disarray due to the terrain and their swift approach. The French unleashed a volley, met by a thunderous response from Wolfe's army.
