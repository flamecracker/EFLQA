A king had a lovely daughter who foretold her own death. She gave her father three choices to prevent it: a deadly pestilence, a bloody war, or to guard her body for a year. When she died, the king honored her request, placing her in a wooden chest in the church. Every night, a sentinel was posted, but they all disappeared mysteriously. People believed the princess's ghost haunted the chest. The king offered a reward, but no one dared to guard it. One day, a bold young smith named Christian arrived in town seeking work. He boasted he was fearless and accepted the challenge. That night, Christian stood guard, and unlike the others, he did not vanish.

Once, a man had three sons and a house he wanted to leave to one of them. To be fair, he sent them to learn trades and return with their best work for a chance to inherit the house. The eldest became a blacksmith, the second a barber, and the third a fencing-master. Upon reuniting, they showcased their skills. The barber shaved a hare mid-run, the blacksmith reshod a horse on the move, and the fencing-master kept dry in the rain with his sword. Impressed, they stayed together, prospering in their trades. Sadly, when one passed, the others followed from grief. Their unity and skill led to a shared grave. Separately, a wicked hobgoblin created a mirror distorting beauty and good, causing chaos worldwide. In a town, two poor children shared a deep bond and cherished moments under rose trees.|['1.

In the evening, as little Kay prepared for bed, he hopped onto the chair near the window and peered through a small hole. Outside, a few snowflakes drifted down, with one of them, the largest, resting on the window-box's edge.

Gerda floated along the river, hoping it would lead her to Kay. Eventually, she arrived at a cherry garden with a peculiar house.

Young men arrived in groups, crowding and mingling together. Despite their ability to speak well on the street, once inside the palace, their wits abandoned them. The sight of guards in silver and footmen in gold, and the grand hall lit up, left them speechless. Standing before the princess, they could only echo her words, which did not impress her. It seemed like they were sleepwalking until they left the palace. A few clever ones brought bread and butter but kept it to themselves, fearing hunger would displease the princess.

In a village, there was a poor smith named Basmus who had many children. To support his family, he would fish and gather wreckage. One day, he went out to fish and didn't return for two days. When he finally came back, his boat was filled with large fish. It was later revealed that he had been with a mermaid for those missing days. The mermaid's son, Hans, came to live with Basmus. Hans had incredible strength, easily breaking iron rods. The squire put Hans to work threshing grain. When Hans found the flails too weak, he made a new one from beams and horse-hide.

The squire woke up when he heard the news and went to confirm it. Indeed, his crops had been threshed, but he was disappointed with the mixed grain.

The men set off early, leaving Hans behind. He took his time, found an old cart and horses, and caught up by carrying trees back. The other men were surprised by his strength and skill.

Hans was a strong man who could easily lift and move heavy objects. Once, when he encountered a large stone blocking his way, he effortlessly lifted it and tossed it aside.

Once upon a time, a young man worked for a wizard, dusting his books. Secretly, he read the books and learned magic. Eventually, he became as wise as the wizard. He could transform into any animal or object. Feeling he had learned enough, he returned home. At a market, he showed his mother his newfound ability to transform into a horse. The horse fetched a high price, but the wizard recognized its magic. The wizard tried to trap the horse but failed as it turned into a dove. The wizard transformed into a hawk to chase the dove. The dove turned into a gold ring, then a grain of barley. The man turned into a hen, but the grain became a pole-cat, defeating the wizard. Later, the king offered his daughter's hand in marriage to anyone who could find her. The young man took up the challenge, but after eight days, he failed and lost his head.

Once upon a time, a young king named Souci was raised by the fairy Inconstancy. Despite her kind heart, the fairy was indecisive, causing chaos at Court. She vacillated between keeping the king ignorant of his duties and suddenly abdicating control. The king, lacking proper training, faced disorder.
