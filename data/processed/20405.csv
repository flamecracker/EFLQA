A professor once shared a fascinating idea about the power of concentration. He believed that with enough focus and determination, one could achieve almost anything. He even mentioned that a person, through intense concentration, could move a house if they truly wished. Grace and her companions were on a journey through the Kentucky mountains, facing challenges along the way. Despite the obstacles and a tense encounter with a mountaineer, they pressed on towards their destination. Grace's boldness in confronting the mountaineer, who had shot at them, showed her fearless spirit. With determination and courage, they continued their journey, navigating the narrow trails and unknown territory, driven by their curiosity and thirst for adventure.|"['1.

Nora bravely confronted the mountaineer, but her friends were quick to intervene. Grace, Lieutenant Wingate, and Elfreda pointed revolvers at the mountaineer to keep him in check. With a tense standoff, they made it clear that they were not there to cause trouble but demanded to be left alone. Hippy, in a commanding tone, instructed the mountaineer to back off and hand over his weapons. Lieutenant Wingate disarmed the mountaineer, and Nora made sure to pick up the discarded revolver.

"""Why didn't you focus on him and save us all this trouble?"" asked Hippy. ""Nora, I'm proud of you,"" he said, turning to her with a smile. ""But don't do something crazy like that again. Even Emma Dean couldn't do worse. What's next, Grace? Should we continue or camp here?"" ""I agree, J. Elfreda,"" replied Grace with a laugh. ""I suggest we take a detour to the right, head over the ridge, and into the mountains where we might not be disturbed. What do you all think?"" ""Yes, let's seek refuge in the mountains and have Emma concentrate all night. If she can move a house with her concentration stunt, she should be able to move that touchy mountain savage further away,"" suggested Hippy, amusing his companions. ""Shouldn't we leave someone here briefly to see if that fellow returns and tries to follow us?"" asked Nora. The Overlanders then retraced their steps until they could climb to the ridge. After reaching the top, they followed the ridge trail for half a mile before venturing into the mountain wilderness. To conceal their trail, they rode their horses up a small stream for a mile until they found a suitable camping spot. They set up camp, with Washington cooking supper while the others tended to the horses. The tents were pitched while they ate.

The Overlanders agreed with Grace's reasoning. After dinner, they gathered around the campfire, now glowing with embers, occasionally adding twigs to create flickers of flame. Before bedtime, Grace checked the camp surroundings, ensuring the ponies were securely tethered. She had confiscated Washington's harmonica to avoid drawing attention to their camp. Grace remained vigilant, suspecting trouble from their mountain foes. Lieutenant Wingate extinguished the fire, staying alert with his rifle. In the night, Grace noticed Hippy awake, sitting near a rock. Later, she sensed movement near the camp, spotting a mysterious figure. Grace calmed the situation by firing a warning shot. The intruder fled, and the camp settled back to sleep. Grace kept watch, revealing the incident at breakfast. They found traces of the visitor but decided not to pursue. Following a challenging path, they continued their journey.|"[""1.

The dense foliage concealed the girls from each other as they chatted, with most of the banter aimed at Hippy, who was leading the way. Elfreda joked that Hippy had fallen asleep on his horse, sparking laughter. Grace found Hippy's rifle and revolver in his saddle, suggesting he hadn't left willingly. Grace decided to investigate, leaving Anne in charge. As they searched, Grace noticed trampled bushes off the trail, hinting at a struggle. Grace and Elfreda followed the trail, discovering a trampled area and hearing a nearby stream. Grace deduced that two men had faced off here, leaving distinct boot imprints. The mystery deepened, raising suspicions.|"['1.

They removed Hippy from his horse, and it's likely they struck him on the head with a weapon, possibly a club or a revolver handle. The dense foliage along the trail would have hidden this act. They then dragged him back a short distance, leaving marks on the soft ground where his heels dug in. Grace pointed out evidence of a blow to Hippy's head, indicating a serious situation. Elfreda suggested being honest with Nora about the situation, except for details about the hat. They believed Hippy was mistaken for someone else by his captors. Emma comforted Nora, assuring her that Hippy's resilience would help him prevail.

The girls agreed to stay put for the time being, though Nora wanted to search for her husband immediately. Grace Harlowe thought it wiser to remain where they were. Grace explained a plan to outsmart any pursuers by riding into a stream to throw them off. She believed the captors may have left a false trail to mislead them. The group set up camp, and Grace investigated the area where Lieutenant Wingate was captured. She found a rocky clearing where she suspected the captors had planned their escape. The girls took turns keeping watch outside the camp to avoid any surprises. Grace and Elfreda sat together, discussing a mysterious message found in the bushes, hoping it might unravel some of the mysteries.

After dark, Hippy was taken from the cave by two men, thrown over a pony, and blindfolded. They rode for over an hour until they reached a campfire. Hippy overheard a conversation about him and was warned to speak up or face dire consequences. Despite the threats, Hippy dared the captors to do their worst. Left tied to a tree, he watched them eat breakfast, feeling miserable and hungry. The men were rough and kept a close eye on him throughout the night.

"Hippy found himself in the midst of a mountain feud, set to begin on the twenty-third of the month. Names like ""Bat Spurgeon"" and ""Jed Thompson"" were mentioned, but meant nothing to him. Exhausted, Lieutenant Wingate fell asleep, only to be rudely awakened later with water. As darkness fell, marking his second night of captivity, the smell of coffee and bacon filled the air. A mysterious voice whispered instructions to Hippy, promising to cut him loose once it was safe. Despite the tension, Hippy managed to eat hardtack, reminiscent of wartime in France.

In the dark of night, the Overlanders faced a dilemma. They were unable to search for Washington until morning. Elfreda believed the captors took Washington to protect themselves from his cries, not for his knowledge. Hippy decided they must stand guard through the night. Each girl armed herself and took her post. The hours passed slowly, filled with worry and tension. Suddenly, a voice pierced the silence. It was Washington, freed from captivity.

Emma, determined, said, ""Listen, Wash! When I was focusing on you, did you feel a strange sensation?""

After breakfast, the two girls rode along a trail next to a rustling cornfield. At the end of the cornfield, they found a cabin in a clearing on rugged mountain land. A woman with three children came out suspiciously as they approached. The girls introduced themselves as Mrs. Grace Gray and Miss Briggs, asking to camp nearby. Mrs. Thompson agreed, mentioning they could have milk from her. Concerned about the children's health, Grace noticed their red faces and listless appearance. Later, a young woman named Julie emerged from behind a bush, resembling an Indian squaw with striking eyes.

Grace noticed a figure slowly rolling towards the cornfield and thought it was their guest, Jeremiah. However, upon closer inspection, she realized it was just blankets folded to look like a person.

Elfreda, feeling victorious and full of adrenaline, held onto the rope tightly, wrapping it around her arm and pulling with all her might.

Anne had a sudden idea and hurried to where they had hidden their supplies. The stones blocking the opening were moved, and their provisions were scattered around.

All the Overlanders, except Nora Wingate, were quickly gathered and informed of the good news. Nora was missing, but Hippy mentioned she was picking mountain berries not far from the camp. He decided to search for her. Meanwhile, Nora sat enjoying the mountain scenery in the early morning light. The mountains looked beautiful in the soft light. Suddenly, she noticed a sombrero below her. Jokingly, she threw a rock towards the man below, but to her surprise, it hit him. The man turned out to be Lum Bangs, who fired his rifle towards Nora. Startled, Nora ran back to the camp with Lum in pursuit. Once back, she shared the incident with her companions. Grace suggested finding a safe place, and they settled in a cave that Hippy had found earlier. They moved their belongings and settled in, with Hippy keeping watch. Despite Grace's worry for Tom, the night passed without any disturbances.|"['1.

A few minutes later, the Overland girls quietly left their camp for the cave. Hippy, with a rifle, stopped just outside and waited. Soon, rifle shots echoed, but Hippy stayed safe. After a while, the shooting stopped, and Hippy returned to the girls unharmed. He shared that their tents were shot but not damaged. As they stayed alert, more gunfire erupted, making sleep impossible. They suspected the attackers were shooting blindly. Bullets started hitting the cave, forcing them to huddle against the walls. Despite the tense situation, they planned to wait for nightfall to possibly retaliate safely. The day passed with dodging bullets until an unexpected lull in the firing at precisely three o'clock caught their attention, prompting Hippy to listen intently.|"['1.

From their high vantage point, the Overland Riders watched a fierce battle unfold below. Men on the opposite mountainside fired shots at figures in the valley. Hippy noted the strategic attack by Jed Thompson a day early. The Overlanders witnessed the intense fight, seeing men fall and rise to join the fray. The supposed Spurgeons dashed down the valley, returning fire at the Thompsons. As the shooting subsided, the girls decided to investigate. Unbeknownst to them, the Thompson fighters had spotted them. Washington, initially terrified, raced back to camp only to find it ransacked. Hippy suspected Bat Spurgeon's gang was behind it.
