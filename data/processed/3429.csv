Master Ward, I have sad news to share with you. I recently visited Lady Alice to thank you on her behalf for your kindness. She arrived in poor condition after a difficult journey, not accustomed to such wet and hardships. The stress and grief have taken a toll on her, and she fell ill with a fever. She is delirious, reliving the storming of the castle and pleading for her husband's life. The situation is dire, and the chances of her survival are slim. If she passes, Bertha and I plan to care for her son as our own. There is a disagreement between us on how to raise him - I suggest keeping his lineage a secret to avoid discontent, while Bertha believes he should be raised as a man-at-arms to reclaim his family's honor. Regardless, I promise to teach him swordsmanship and archery, skills that may serve him well in the future. The news of potential war with France has boosted my trade, and I am busy preparing arms for the possible conflict.|"['1.

Giles Fletcher's expectations about his guest's illness were correct. The fever lessened but left her weak. She lingered for a while, showing little attachment to life. She passed away, entrusting her son to Bertha. The boy, Walter Fletcher, grew up under Bertha's care. He spent his time playing sports with other boys in Moorfields. As the war with France raged, the boys mimicked battles. Walter, known for his strength and courage, became the leader. Geoffrey Ward, a bachelor and an armorer, taught Walter how to use arms. Walter's skill with arms made him a formidable opponent in the boys' games. Giles Fletcher advised Walter to play more peacefully due to complaints about injuries caused by him. The Common Council considered regulating the boys' fights to prevent further harm.|"['1.

Giles warned Walter about his behavior, urging him to adopt a more peaceful demeanor. Walter expressed his desire to apprentice with Master Geoffrey in ironwork rather than bow-making.

The prince marveled at Walter's prowess with a club, likening his actions to those of a seasoned knight leading an assault.

The attackers were overpowered; only a few managed to reach the top of the heap, and those who did were pushed back by the defenders. They exchanged heavy blows, and blood flowed from many wounds. In those times, boys valued toughness, and bravery was highly regarded. Despite being surrounded, their leader stood his ground skillfully wielding his club, impressing the prince. Ignoring calls to surrender, the boy bravely fought back, holding the flag high. After a fierce battle, he was struck on the head and fell unconscious. The prince, concerned, called for help. A leech gave the boy a potent drink, reviving him. The prince praised the boy's bravery and offered him a place among his men-at-arms. Walter, recovering, shared the prince's offer with his friend Geoffrey, who helped him become an apprentice to a skilled armorer.

Walter, an apprentice to an armourer, grew skilled in various fighting styles and excelled in cudgel and sword-and-buckler play. Despite being only fifteen, he outperformed older soldiers, earning their admiration or envy. On Sundays, he spent time with Giles Fletcher and his wife, attending mass and strolling through the fields. Walter avoided fights and revelries with former friends, preferring to rest after work and listen to war stories from old soldiers. The region was plagued by robbers, often ex-soldiers, who terrorized travelers. The severe laws against plundering led to sympathy for the criminals, making it challenging for authorities to catch them. Walter, adventurous and skilled with a bow, encountered a knight in the marshes one evening, recognizing him from a recent visit to the armourer's shop.|"['1.

Walter overheard the knight's mysterious conversation with a fugitive in the swamp. The knight mentioned a boat arriving at dusk, with a lady wearing a white mantle as a signal. There was talk of a reward of fifty gold pieces, of which ten had already been given. Walter, intrigued by the secrecy, waited patiently outside the hidden hut. The fog thickened, making it harder to see. As the conversation continued, Walter hoped to uncover more about the clandestine meeting. He marveled at the cleverness of the hideout, well-concealed among the bushes and stagnant pools of the swamp. The knight and the fugitive discussed a plan, hinting at a boat rendezvous and a mysterious lady. Walter listened intently, eager to unravel the unfolding mystery.|"[""1.

"""You may consider it as good as done,"" the other replied. ""If the boat is there the matter is settled. Now I will lead you back across the swamps. I would not give much for your life if you tried to find the way alone. Who would have thought when you got me off from being hung, after that little affair at Bruges, that I should be able to make myself useful to your worship?""

""You may be sure,"" the knight replied, ""that it was just because I foresaw that you might be useful that I opened the doors of your cell that night. It is always handy in times like these to be able to lay one's hand on a man whom you can hang if you choose to open your mouth.""

""Certainly it did,"" the knight replied; ""but as I happen to be able to make it for your interest to serve me, that matter did not trouble me. I knew better than to bring money into this swamp of yours, when I might be attacked by half a dozen ruffians like yourself; and I took the precaution of informing Peter, the captain of my men-at-arms, of the spot to which I was going, bidding him, in case I came not back, to set a hue and cry on foot and hunt down all who might be found here, with the especial description of your worthy self.""

One day, Walter and his friends were rowing on the river when they heard a cry for help. Without hesitation, Walter jumped into the water and swam towards the source of the distress.

They rowed to Westminster, where the mother was taken to the Earl of Talbot's residence for care. Walter's friend, Geoffrey, advised him to be cautious about revealing all the details of the incident, especially regarding the knight involved.

Geoffrey, the chief magistrate, took Walter aside to hear his account. Walter admitted his regret for not sharing the information sooner, believing it was about a damsel's abduction, not murder. The magistrate acknowledged Walter's efforts but pointed out missed opportunities to prevent the crime. He then tasked Walter with identifying his comrades involved. Geoffrey planned to dispatch constables under Walter's guidance to capture the marsh pirates. They arranged to meet at Kennington Common to confront the outlaws. The magistrate arrived with reinforcements, including Geoffrey's men armed with cudgels. They advanced cautiously toward the pirates' hideout, where a scuffle ensued.

After the skirmish, nine prisoners were captured, some injured from the struggle. They were marched off the marsh with their hands tied behind them. The justice planned to take them to Richmond's jail. On Monday, they were brought before the justice for questioning. Walter Fletcher testified about the attack on the boat but couldn't identify the assailants. Other apprentices gave similar accounts. Lady Alice Vernon's representative, Sir William de Hertford, mentioned she would testify later. The prisoners were committed for trial due to suspicions of their involvement in the attack. Dame Vernon might help identify the mastermind. Walter was summoned by Lady Vernon to the Earl of Talbot's residence.

Geoffrey was rather confused as he explained the historical events. Bertha Fletcher, once dependent on Sir Roland Somers' family, faced turmoil when the king took control, leading to Sir Jasper Vernon gaining Sir Roland's lands. King Edward II was weak, controlled by favorites, and his ambitious queen, Isabella of France, sought power. After dethroning the king with her son's aid, Edward III took the throne at fifteen. Isabella and her favorite, Mortimer, ruled, but the government was oppressive. The people turned against Isabella, and Edward married Philippa of Hainault. Edward's visit to France and a rising against Isabella led to his decision to take control. With difficulty, Edward planned Mortimer's arrest during a parliament meeting at Nottingham to seize power.|"[""1.

The castle gates closed at sunset, and Sir William Eland, the constable, handed the keys to the queen. Sir William, a loyal knight, assisted in arresting Mortimer, who was found surrounded by friends in the castle. A fight ensued, resulting in injuries and deaths. Mortimer was captured, tried, and executed for treason. Queen Isabella remained a prisoner at Castle Risings. Walter, a young apprentice, visited Earl Talbot's mansion to see Dame Vernon. Despite feeling uneasy, Walter was praised for his bravery in saving Dame Vernon and her daughter. Led to Dame Vernon by a man-at-arms, Walter met the lady and her daughter in a grand room. Walter, a sturdy lad of sixteen, impressed with his respectful yet independent demeanor.

"""I must thank you, young sir,"" she said, extending her hand. Walter, following the custom of the time, raised it to his lips and bent on one knee. ""For saving our lives. I am grateful for your help,"" Walter replied. ""But I should have warned my master about the danger to prevent the attack. I feel I am more at fault than deserving praise."" ""Despite your modesty, you saved us. Can I assist you in any way? Earl Talbot, my uncle, would welcome you into his service,"" she offered. ""I am content as an armourer for now,"" Walter replied. ""I will seek a new path when I am ready."" As the lady's daughter looked out the window, she asked Walter to share more about what he overheard. Walter hesitated, suggesting it might be better for her not to know everything. The lady insisted on knowing the truth to protect herself. Walter revealed that a dark-faced knight had plotted against them, causing the lady distress. Walter assured her that he would keep the secret if she wished, but warned of the risk if the knight was tortured.

Walter smiled and shared his experience at the grand mansion. The lady there made him feel comfortable and even gifted him a chain from the queen. His master, Geoffrey, was not pleased and planned to complain about the lady's influence on Walter. Geoffrey encouraged Walter's dreams of becoming a knight and winning the hand of the young Lady Edith Vernon. He explained the complex royal lineage of France to Walter, showcasing the rivalry for the French throne between King Edward and Phillip of Valois.

During the time of the last king's death, Edward was still a young boy under his mother's care. Phillip, being a man, quickly gained support in France and was declared the rightful monarch. In England, at a parliament in Northampton, Edward's rights were debated, and bishops were sent to Paris to protest Phillip's nomination. However, as England couldn't enforce Edward's claim, Phillip solidified his rule in France. Phillip then demanded Edward to do homage for certain French estates, putting Edward in a difficult position. Edward ultimately did homage but left terms open for his council to consider. After some time, Edward's acknowledgment of Phillip as King of France became evident. Edward later engaged in military sports, hosting tournaments that showcased England's chivalrous court. The tournaments stirred the people's spirits, preparing them for war with France. Subsequently, conflicts with Scotland arose, leading to a period of unrest and battles that would shape the history of both nations.|"[""1.

During the conflict between England and Scotland, Edward Baliol, son of Robert Bruce's rival, claimed the Scottish throne. With the support of English nobles holding land claims in Scotland, Baliol was crowned but later defeated and driven out. Meanwhile, tensions between Edward and the French king, Phillip of Valois, escalated. Phillip's support of Bruce fueled Edward's suspicion that Phillip was amassing an army to attack England. Edward demanded Phillip's neutrality in Scotland and the restoration of Aquitaine's castles. Phillip agreed but insisted on David Bruce's restoration. This refusal hinted at a French alliance with Scotland against England. To provoke Edward, Robert of Artois presented a heron, symbolizing cowardice, at a banquet, insinuating Edward's lack of valor in relinquishing French territories. The situation worsened as Edward suspected Phillip's true intentions and prepared for potential conflict.|"[""1.

In 1337, King Edward of England decided to wage war against France after a heated exchange with Phillip. The king, along with his knights, made preparations for battle by enrolling men, crafting arms, and raising funds through various means. Meanwhile, Phillip of France gathered support from Italian maritime states, Spain, and his vassals in Normandy and Brittany. King Edward, after delays, finally entered France in 1339, ready to face Phillip's forces. The ongoing war has taken a toll on the people, doubling taxes and causing a drain on resources. Despite the hardships, the conflict has brought out noble qualities in men, showcasing valour, fortitude, and honour. While some yearn for peace, others find purpose and meaning in the midst of war, where deeds of valour are admired and celebrated.|"[""1.

There was a fierce battle on the bridge. The armor was strong, and the fighters were young. Some fell into the moat and had to withdraw. Walter and Ralph led their men, holding their ground against Pembroke's forces. The apprentices rained arrows from the side. Pembroke retreated into the castle, closing the gates. The drawbridge chains were cut, and stones were thrown from the tower. The king praised the apprentice leader's strategy. The attackers tried to bridge the moat but failed. They then attempted to scale the tower. A bridge was lowered, but it was too short. The defenders repelled the attackers on the wall. A counterattack from the sortie gate pushed the defenders back.

Four days after the French arrived at Hennebon, Don Louis, who had been wounded near Quimperle and lay in Rennes for six weeks, joined them. Sixteen engines cast stones at the walls, but Sir Walter protected them with sandbags, frustrating the attack. The garrison taunted the assailants, enraging the Spaniards and Don Louis. The Spanish prince, furious, demanded the execution of two English knights. Charles of Blois and his nobles tried to dissuade him, but he remained resolute. The prisoners, Sir John Butler and Sir Hubert Frisnoy, were informed of their fate by Don Louis. The garrison, upon learning of the impending executions, took action. Almeric de Clisson led a force to the enemy's camp, causing chaos and rescuing the knights. Meanwhile, Sir Walter Manny freed the knights and returned to Hennebon.

Shortly after, news arrived that the Earl of Northampton and Robert of Artois, along with their troops, had set sail. Simultaneously, Don Louis, with the Genoese and other Italian mercenaries, moved to intercept them with a large fleet. The fleets clashed near Guernsey in a fierce battle that lasted till nightfall. Amidst the darkness, a violent storm struck, causing the combatants to disengage. The English managed to reach Brittany and landed close to Vannes. The Spaniards seized four small ships lost in the storm but were blown south to Spain without regaining Brittany's coast. The Earl of Northampton besieged Vannes, and Sir Walter Manny hurried from Hennebon to support him. The French army was expected to rush to relieve the town, prompting an immediate assault plan.

They began their daring escape by climbing the rope with surprising ease. Swapping positions a few times, they rested briefly. In less than two hours, Walter's head and shoulders emerged above the courtyard. Hearing the sounds of revelry inside, they decided to sneak out during the feast. The courtyard was empty as they made their way to the main yard, where drunken men lay about. Walter devised a plan to disguise themselves by taking steel caps and cloaks from the inebriated men.

In October, King Edward sailed with a large army, landing in Brittany in early November. He marched through the country, capturing several towns like Ploermel and Redon. Meanwhile, the Earls of Norfolk and Warwick scouted the area towards Nantes. Negotiations with Breton lords led to many switching sides in support of the Countess of Montford.

Ralph expressed readiness to fight but suggested devising a plan for when the mob attacks. The house lacked defense, with broad ground-floor windows. The duo decided against using a plank to escape due to the mob below. Instead, they planned to jump across the narrow lane onto the opposite windowsill. They joined the defense against the rabble, knowing mercy was unlikely. As the mob broke in, Van Artevelde's attempt to address them failed. The defenders fought valiantly, repelling the attackers.

Hastily pulling their hoods down to cover their faces, the two figures emerged from the narrow street into a bustling main thoroughfare. The street was alive with weavers, butchers, skinners, and others celebrating their recent victory. Meanwhile, the city's burghers whispered anxiously about the potential consequences of the recent violent act. Determined to escape, the two friends split up to find a rope for their plan. After an hour, they reunited, and Ralph had successfully secured ropes from a nearby inn's cattle yard. With the ropes hidden under his cloak, they hurried to the city wall.

Walter shared with his acquaintance the unfortunate news of the events in town, worrying about the impact on the king's plans. The death of the king's ally, Van Artevelde, jeopardized England's hopes of gaining control over Flanders. Reflecting on the missed opportunity for a strategic entrance into Ghent, they discussed the implications of the recent turmoil. The king's initial anger subsided as wiser decisions prevailed. Understanding the delicate balance with the Flemish people, the king chose not to retaliate. Instead, he returned to England, where his strategic silence and diplomatic finesse paved the way for reconciliation. The Flemings, realizing the benefits of aligning with England, sought to strengthen ties through marriage alliances and military cooperation. Despite historical biases, Jacob van Artevelde's legacy as a visionary leader and patriot endured, shaping the future of Flanders.

A small army was left behind to defend the Scottish frontier while England had forces in Guienne and Brittany. Lionel, Edward's son, was the regent during his father's absence. On Edward's ship were Godfrey of Harcourt and the Prince of Wales, with Walter, one of the prince's personal squires. The fleet was supposed to go to Guienne but changed course for Normandy due to Godfrey's influence. Normandy was rich and prosperous, untouched by war. The expedition landed at La Hogue in Normandy without opposition. They spent six days disembarking and pillaged towns. The Prince of Wales was knighted, and Walter Somers was recommended for the honor. The army was divided into three, capturing towns and advancing towards Caen. Phillip of France sent forces to oppose Edward. Edward's army attacked Caen, resulting in a fierce battle with many casualties. The plunder covered the expenses of the expedition. Edward declined truce negotiations and continued to gather loot as he marched forward.|"[""1.

During his march, Edward faced a growing threat from a gathering army led by the Count of Harcourt in Normandy. The English king found his retreat cut off and was forced to consider his options. He decided to march towards Paris along the Seine, but faced resistance as the enemy destroyed bridges and blocked his path. Edward's troops engaged in skirmishes, burning villages and causing terror. As they reached Poissy, a strategic bridge was destroyed, but Edward planned to cross. Godfrey of Harcourt led the advance, defeating local forces. The French king, Phillip, attempted to intercept Edward's army, offering battle but was declined.

"The English were in a critical situation. Rivers blocked their path on one side, and a much larger enemy army threatened them from the rear and flank. The country was marshy and sparsely populated, making it hard to find food. Edward's army couldn't find a way across the river until a peasant named Gobin Agase revealed a ford called ""La Blanche Tache"". The English finally crossed the river, facing a fierce battle against the French forces. Despite the French resistance, the English, led by King Edward, prevailed. The French were defeated, leaving thousands dead. The English then captured Crotoy, securing supplies for their army. Although they could have returned to England triumphantly, Edward decided to stand and fight in Ponthieu. The battlefield was carefully chosen, with the Black Prince leading the charge.

On the night of the 25th, King Edward entertained all the main leaders of the British host. The next morning, Mass was celebrated, and the king, the prince, and many knights and nobles received the Sacrament. The army then marched to take its position. Estimates suggest it comprised around 30,000 men. The Black Prince's division included 800 men-at-arms, 4000 archers, and 6000 Welsh foot. The archers were placed in front, supported by Welsh troops and men-at-arms. The French, with a force exceeding 100,000 men, marched towards Cressy. Phillip, accompanied by various nobles, heard Mass and moved slowly towards the English position. The French, eager for battle, pressed forward in confusion, leading to disorder in their ranks. King Edward, observing the chaos in the French lines, refrained from ordering an immediate charge. The English army, dismounted, awaited the French onslaught.

The Genoese soldiers advanced with loud shouts towards the English archers, who remained calm and ready for the attack. As the sun set in the west, its rays shone brightly on the French soldiers, making it hard for them to see. The Genoese fired their crossbows at the English, but the archers retaliated with a storm of arrows, causing chaos among the attackers. The French cavalry charged in, but the English knights stood strong, repelling each assault. The battle intensified as more French forces joined in, but the English held their ground.

During the fierce battle, King Phillip of France, despite being blind, showed great courage and led his men into the thick of the fight. His loyal followers tied their horses together to prevent losing him in the chaos. Meanwhile, the Black Prince of Wales held his ground against the French forces, gradually pushing them back. The next morning, as fog blanketed the field, English forces encountered a large enemy group. The English swiftly defeated them, with the Grand Prior of France among the casualties.

Shortly before dawn, Walter and his men devised a daring plan to sabotage the enemy's battering machine. Armed with axes, they stealthily approached the wagon. A fierce battle ensued as they destroyed the machine and repelled the enemy's attacks. Despite being driven back at first, they managed to delay the repairs on the machine. Using ropes, Walter and his men swiftly retreated, evading the pursuing French forces. Back at the castle, the defenders prepared for the impending assault. They erected a formidable barrier at the breach, lined with spikes and nails. As the French army charged, Walter and his men valiantly defended the narrow gap, utilizing tactics like oil and tar to impede the attackers.

The battle was fierce and desperate as Walter and his small group fought valiantly against the French attackers. Despite the slipperiness of the ground and their own determination, the defenders were gradually pushed back. Walter ordered the archers to stop firing and retreat to the keep to continue the fight from there. With only a few men left, Walter made a daring move, attacking the French and forcing them down the slope before retreating to the courtyard. As the French breached the barrier, a fierce fight ensued. Walter and his men managed to defend the narrow passage leading to the keep, but the barriers were weakening. Quickly, they retreated into the keep just as the barriers collapsed. Inside, they prepared for the next wave of the French assault.

Their leader is skilled, and the plan is strong. The wall's strength will determine how long they can resist. The wall is weak, and without help, they face death or surrender.

Ralph managed to push the bottom of the bar with some effort, then struggled to free the upper end. After successfully removing it, he pulled himself up and squeezed through a narrow loophole. Walter followed, climbing up with less difficulty due to his smaller build. The two men found themselves by the western side of the castle, near a stream they would swim across. Ralph instructed Walter to stick close to the wall to avoid getting lost. They successfully made it past the castle's defenses and into the forest, where they rested after a long night of travel.

The shed was cozy, and they fell asleep quickly. By daybreak, their clothes had dried a bit. As they continued their journey towards Calais, they encountered few people who greeted them casually. They rested near the ruins of Pres Castle and reached the English camp at New Town the next day. The prince was shocked to see Walter, as he had received news of Walter's capture.

The French king's decision to fight the English at Calais without mercy remains a mystery. Despite having a larger army, he chose a path that seemed irrational. Some believe his actions were driven by temporary madness, supported by his history of erratic behavior. The governor of Calais, faced with the harsh terms of surrender, offered himself and five other notable citizens for execution to save the town. The citizens, in a heartbreaking display of sacrifice, followed suit. Sir Walter Manny and the nobles pleaded with the king for mercy, highlighting the nobility and selflessness of the citizens.

Sir Walter Manny, a noble knight, led a group of soldiers to occupy Calais, a town. Although the king was initially angry, he soon showed kindness by providing food to all citizens. Those who chose to leave were allowed to take their belongings and safely escorted to a nearby French town. Eustace de St. Pierre, a brave man, was given back his possessions and a pension. Many citizens decided to stay, becoming subjects of the English king. King Edward invited English traders to settle in Calais, offering them the houses and lands left by the departing French. The town flourished as an English settlement for centuries. A truce was brokered between England and France, and Edward returned to a grand court in Westminster. The Black Prince arranged a marriage for his ward, Edith Vernon, with Sir Walter Somers, a loyal knight.

In England, the march of the pestilence westward was viewed with deep apprehension. The approaching danger was brought home by the death of the Princess Joan, the king's second daughter. She was betrothed to Peter, the heir to the throne of Spain. The young bride, not yet fourteen, was sent to Bordeaux with a train of attendants to marry her promised husband. Tragically, she succumbed to the pestilence shortly after arriving in Bordeaux. The disease rapidly spread through seaports in England, devastating the population. The plague caused terror and despair, with no remedies proving effective. Flight was futile as even remote villages suffered.

The news quickly spread throughout the village, causing a commotion as the alarm-bell rang from the castle. Men armed themselves, ready to confront the impending danger.

During a truce between France and England, tensions rose as both sides prepared to resume hostilities.

The Spanish fleet sailed north, capturing English merchantmen on the way, and prepared to return to Spain with the prizes. Edward, aware of their plans, gathered his forces on the coast to oppose them. The Spanish armada, well-equipped and outnumbering the English, confidently advanced towards the English fleet. In the ensuing battle, the Spanish ships, larger and stronger, had the upper hand. The king led the English forces, engaging in intense combat. Despite the odds, the English fought bravely. Walter, aboard the ship with the Black Prince, faced a sinking vessel but managed to capture a Spanish ship after a fierce struggle.

The prince and his knights scouted the area to find the best spot for battle. They chose a high ground near Poitiers, defended by a vineyard. The only way to access it was a narrow road from Poitiers, making it hard for cavalry to maneuver. The French king divided his army into three parts, each with 16,000 men, led by different commanders. De Ribaumont suggested most men dismount due to the terrain. The Cardinal of Perigord tried to negotiate peace, but both sides prepared for battle. The Black Prince fortified his camp, facing a larger French army and dwindling supplies. The cardinal's attempts at peace failed, leading to an inevitable battle. The British army fortified their position while negotiations broke down, forcing them to prepare for the fight ahead.|"[""1.

After examining the ground, it was discovered that the hill on the right side of the camp was easier to climb than expected. The Dauphin's men-at-arms at its foot would face little difficulty in the assault. The prince ordered 300 men-at-arms and 300 mounted archers to flank the Dauphin's division from the rear. The Captal De Buch led this maneuver, concealed by the terrain. As the French army advanced, the Black Prince, with Sir John Chandos and Sir James Audley by his side, prepared for battle. Audley, eager to fulfill a vow, led the charge. The French cavalry charged through a narrow way but were met with a barrage of arrows from English archers. Audley and his squires fought bravely, causing chaos among the French ranks. The Captal De Buch's surprise attack on the Dauphin's flank added to the confusion.

Rumors spread among the French soldiers at the back, causing panic and some to flee. Sir John Chandos urged the prince to seize the day and face the King of France in battle. The English cavalry charged down the hill, clashing with the German and French forces. The English overpowered the Germans and drove them back, causing chaos among the French. The Dauphin's division was also attacked and thrown into disarray. The French nobles tried to protect the young princes by retreating, but this led to further confusion.

The fight was nearly finished. The French flags were gone, leaving behind the wounded, prisoners, and fleeing soldiers. Chandos advised the prince to stop. His banner was raised on a small hill. Trumpets sounded to call back the troops, and the prince, with a few knights, drank wine. The two marshals returned first. They were sent to find King John, who was not seen leaving the battlefield. They found a group quarreling over the king's capture. The earls saluted the king and led him to the prince. The English won with fewer troops. Many French soldiers were captured, including a king, a prince, and other nobles. The English shared their riches with the captives. The prince gave a helmet as a gift to his father. Many prisoners were freed on the condition of returning for ransom or captivity. The prince rewarded a knight for his bravery. A feast was held for the French prisoners.

Soon after arriving in the city, negotiations for peace began between the Cardinal of Perigord, another legate, and the prince. Despite the prince's moderate demands, a final peace agreement could not be reached, leading to a two-year truce starting from the following Easter. During the winter, many prisoners paid their ransoms, enriching the army. The prince returned to England with King John, receiving a grand welcome in London. Meanwhile, the king had limited success in Scotland, with David Bruce as a prisoner and Baliol on the throne. Negotiations led to a truce with the Scots for ten years and the release of Bruce for a ransom. In France, disorder reigned after the king's capture, culminating in the Jacquerie uprising by peasants seeking revenge on the nobility for centuries of oppression.|"[""1.

During a time of great unrest in France, the peasants rose against the nobles, committing acts of extreme cruelty. Many noblewomen sought refuge in Meaux, guarded by a small group of men-at-arms. Upon hearing of the dire situation, three knights, including Sir Walter Somers, rushed to their aid. Arriving at Meaux, they found the town besieged by a massive peasant army.

History has no record of such a vast slaughter by so few men. This devastating punishment swiftly ended the Jacquerie rebellion. In other regions, several groups had already been defeated, including their leader Caillet and three thousand followers near Clermont. However, the decisive defeat at Meaux crushed the uprising. Upon their return, knights executed burghers who had joined the peasants, burning most of the town as punishment for collaborating. The knights and ladies then headed to Paris, finding it under threat by the Dauphin's forces. Marcel and the King of Navarre defied royal power, but the King of Navarre ultimately betrayed Marcel, leading to a violent confrontation. Loyal knights thwarted a treacherous plan to seize Paris, ensuring the city's safety and earning recognition and honors for their bravery.|"[""1.

During this period, King John of France was held captive by the English. The French nobles were too busy with internal conflicts to raise the ransom money. Languedoc was the only region that made efforts to help. Meanwhile, war continued between the Dauphin and the King of Navarre. After a truce, Edward of England led a well-equipped army through France without facing much resistance. He even passed by Paris without besieging it, showing he didn't seek to conquer France. Eventually, a peace agreement was reached where France ceded Aquitaine and Calais to England. In return, England gave up its gains in Normandy and Brittany, and the claim to the French crown. Edward's son, the Black Prince, became Prince of Aquitaine. The French king, John, returned to France after four years of captivity but faced challenges with his sons breaking oaths.|"[""1.

"During the Battle of Auray, forces led by De Montford and Charles clashed in a deadly struggle. Sir Robert Knolles and Oliver de Clisson commanded De Montford's side, while Du Guesclin led Charles's army. The ducal arms of Brittany were displayed on both sides as the two armies closed in combat. The English forces fought on foot with shortened lances against the French. De Montford was initially driven back, but Sir Hugh de Calverley's advance turned the tide. Clisson, despite being wounded, continued to lead his men against the Count of Auxerre. Chandos, aiding De Montford, attacked the rear of Auxerre, causing the French division to crumble. Charles was slain, and Du Guesclin surrendered, marking the end of the conflict between the houses of Blois and Montford.

The disagreement between Pedro and the clergy led to his downfall. Summoned by the pope in Avignon to address the accusations against him, Pedro refused and was excommunicated. Subsequently, the pope declared the Castile throne vacant, appointing Henry in his place. France, plagued by marauding groups, sought the companies' support for Henry's cause. Du Guesclin, held by Chandos, was released after a ransom was paid by the pope, the King of France, and Don Henry. The companies, along with French knights, marched to Spain, supported by John of Bourbon but led by Du Guesclin. Passing Avignon, they coerced the pope into paying them. The English, despite orders from their king, joined the expedition. Pedro sought refuge with the Black Prince in Bordeaux, promising him Biscay and payment for the British troops. King Edward sent an army under John of Gaunt to aid his son. The Black Prince, supported by English knights, reclaimed the English companies, advancing through Navarre despite treacherous delays.|"[""1.

On the 17th of February, the English army, consisting of 30,000 soldiers, arrived at the pass. It was divided into three sections. The first group was led by the Duke of Lancaster and Lord Chandos, the second by the Black Prince, and the third by the King of Majorca and the Count of Armaguac. The soldiers faced challenges due to heavy snow and difficult terrain. Despite a storm on one of the days, they managed to cross the pass. By the 20th of February, all troops had safely crossed the Pyrenees. Du Guesclin, who had returned to France to gather an army, was nearby. The Black Prince sent a message to Don Henry, urging him to resolve their differences peacefully. However, Don Henry, confident in his forces, prepared for battle. The two armies were vastly uneven in numbers, with the Black Prince commanding 30,000 troops compared to Don Henry's 90,000 soldiers.|"['1.

"Walter confidently stated, ""We will do it tomorrow. I hope to face Du Guesclin. I am stronger now than at Cressy and want to test myself against this champion."" Don Henry split his force into three parts. Du Guesclin led the first division with 4000 knights and 8000 foot-soldiers. The prince's brother, Don Tillo, led 16,000 horse in the second division, while Don Henry commanded the third with 100,000 men. The English army, like before Poitiers, didn't eat before battle. At sunrise, they saw the Spanish army approaching. The battle began with the English charging Du Guesclin's division and the prince defeating Don Tillo's. The English archers dispersed the Spanish slingers, and a fierce fight ensued. Don Pedro fought bravely alongside his troops. The battle raged on, with both sides showing great courage.

About 8000 soldiers perished in the fierce battle, with casualties almost evenly split among the English, French, and Spaniards. Many Spaniards died in the pursuit, and others drowned while trying to cross the Ebro River. Don Henry, fighting bravely until the end, sought refuge in Avignon after escaping to French territory. The day after the battle, Don Pedro, seeking revenge, asked the Black Prince for all Castilian prisoners to execute them. However, the prince, opposing cruelty, convinced Pedro to spare the prisoners' lives, except for one who had betrayed them. Even Pedro's brother, Don Sancho, who fought on the opposing side, was pardoned. Burgos surrendered, and the country resumed its loyalty to Pedro. Walter, fighting valiantly alongside the Black Prince, earned praise despite not facing Du Guesclin. He defeated the notorious Knight of the Raven, revealed to be Sir James Carnegie, a dishonorable foe. Walter, wounded but victorious, later participated in tournaments near Burgos. The treacherous King Pedro failed to fulfill his promise to pay the troops, leading to tensions as the prince awaited the funds.|"['1.
