"Sally is very kind. She praised our laundry and even took Victoria's dress to wash it again. She was right to say, ""A week's laundry isn't all fun."" Our backs ache, our faces are red, and our hands are wrinkled from all the hard work. We feel sorry for Sally every week and promise not to dirty our dresses as much. My father is building a new house, but I have my own now. It's brick red with a white window and a yellow chimney. My brother made me shelves, a table, and a pestle-and-mortar. My mother gave me a jam-pot, the only one that can hold water. It's a Doll's House, and Jemima, my doll, lives in it. Jemima is thin and wooden, so she can lie on the roof without breaking it. I wish I had a drawing-room for her. My Doll's House doesn't have a front door, so I have to play outside. My father is adding a wing to his house, and my brother nailed my Doll's House on top of an old tea-chest. Bill says he'll paint it inside and out when he paints his boat. There's a hole in the floor, and the wood is rotten. Bill says we should make a new Doll's House with proper rooms. All my doll things are in a box now, except Jemima and the pestle-and-mortar.

Once upon a time, there was a brave Elf who set out on an adventure carrying a thimble on his back and a rose-twig as his weapon. One sunny spring day, he ventured into the woods to find a Bumble Bee's nest. As he tried to grab some honey, the Bee returned, leading to a fierce battle.

Once we part ways, what should you bring back to me? Not riches or fame, just a pure heart like mine. I don't seek treasures, only you, as you are. My love, return to me as you are. You mention foreign riches, but I seek only your eyes, not your hands. Glory and pride don't matter, just unbroken faith. I dream of seeing you at home, not in grandeur. May God reunite us, not with wealth but with you. If you remember me, may it be with love. Time may guide us apart, but bring you back to me. Flowers bloom, hopes dance, but love's vows are fragile. Seasons change, but memories remain. Life fades, but friendships endure. Let's cherish the golden love that lasts. Embrace the call to endure, for victory is certain. Rise to the Christian conflict, the time is now. Soldiers of Jesus, stand firm in battle. Take up the daily cross and follow His path.|"['1.
