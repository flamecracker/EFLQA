Johnny and Ned were playing with a ball when it accidentally hit Johnny's hand, making him very angry. He chased Ned and started beating him until a man intervened, giving Johnny a box on the ear. This made Johnny release Ned, and he began to cry. The man pointed out that although Johnny hurt Ned, he didn't like being hurt himself. On the other hand, Jane was a lazy girl who preferred playing with her doll over reading her lessons. When her doll was taken away until she read, she did so poorly and refused to learn to write, growing up as a dull person. In another story, two girls left their dolls unattended, and a cat tore them apart. When they returned, they cried and wanted to scold the cat, but their mother explained they should have been more careful with their toys. Ann, a kind girl, once gave a poor child money for bread when she had none. Tom, who thought he knew better than his friends, caught a cold after going out without a coat and learned to follow instructions. Lastly, a child named Fanny didn't listen to her mother's warning about standing on the fender and ended up falling into the hearth, catching fire. Her mother managed to put out the flames and save her.|"['1.
