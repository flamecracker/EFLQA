Betty used to attend school regularly until her mother passed away. In the year that followed, she hadn't focused on her studies, losing her ability to concentrate.

Norma confirmed that Grandma Macklin was known for her exceptional estate management skills, despite not being extravagantly wealthy. After becoming a widow at a young age, she inherited a substantial fortune in bonds and jewels, including magnificent diamonds, emeralds, pearls, rose topazes, and more.
