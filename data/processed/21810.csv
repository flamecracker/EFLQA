John gave clear instructions to Muro before they set out on a scouting mission. While scouting, the natives intercepted Uraso, prompting them to prepare for a potential attack. They used a signaling instrument, which led to a shot being fired. A scout rushed back with a report, and a messenger was sent to Muro. The puzzled natives were then met with an attack, and Muro found himself in danger. Despite making a demonstration, the weird drums signaled an ambush. As the natives approached, attempts to be friendly were met with the Chief's refusal. However, Uraso appeared and used a clever ruse to confound the savages, allowing Muro to escape. The savages eventually retreated, and Muro shared his story of making efforts to befriend the natives. They were eventually driven from the woods towards the sea in the east, where a runner was sent to the landing. The peculiar drums and the Marimba added to the mysterious atmosphere, along with the sighting of a mountain deer.|"['1.

The night was challenging as the group ventured forward. Education without selfishness was emphasized during their evening discussions. They delved into astronomy and its importance to early humanity, where savage rituals were guided by star signs. The origins of the Zodiac and universal superstitions were explored, hinting at a common beginning for all continents. The theory of a mid-Atlantean landmass and the unity of races through language were discussed. The mysteries of the pyramids and tales from Egyptian priests were shared. Evidence from deep sea soundings and native beliefs in witch doctors added to the intrigue. As they neared a village, drums beat ominously, causing a captive situation with a huge Chief and witch doctors in elaborate attire.

Tarra was freed when captured by the fallen witch doctor, causing surprise and a warning from Uraso. Exorcising the bad spirits showed the influence of noise on savage minds, leading to the use of gun silencers. Despite the savages insisting on aiding their fallen witch doctor, a shot with the silencer produced awe. John, the white Korino, instilled terror among the natives, causing the Chief to retreat. Upon entering the village, the Chief and people fled as reserves came up. The sick and wounded in the village were found in a prison stockade, prompting the rescue of prisoners in their terrible plight. A white captive was discovered, and the stockade was burned. Learning about the tribes on the island, a messenger was sent to the Chief with John's bold march to see him, astounding the Chief at John's bravery. A peace pact was made between John and the Chief, assuring the Chief of their friendship. Further learning revealed another tribe to the north, with the Chief understanding the white Chief's power through wisdom and John's practical example.|"['1.

The ancient ceremony of fasting before a feast was a great success. It included flower rites that held significant importance. These customs, like the practice of scalping, had origins in ancient rituals. Head hunters were known for their hair token customs. The Druids performed ceremonies involving mistletoe as an antidote. The oak tree was revered as sacred. After the ceremony, a grand feast with special table implements took place. The Korinos were imprisoned but attempted to escape, leading to a series of events involving the Marmozets and a tall native with a unique garb and knotted club. The Chief's anger led to the guards being condemned to suffer instead of the Korinos, culminating in a procession to the sacrificial altar.|"['1.

John, a peerless Korino, made a bold suggestion to the Chief to become the executioner. Uraso addressed the culprits, striking terror with mysticism, hypnotic influences, and mesmerism. The natives fell under a spell, influenced by mystic numbers and constant repetitions. The Chief, rigid under the mesmeric influence, made threats against witch doctors. Victims were brought back to life, amazing the people. A feast followed, with a mystic third dance at the festival's end. The fate of the Korinos was settled, and the white captive's faculties were restored. His story, including the identity of a skeleton found on Venture Island, was doubted by John. Rescued natives, the Maloses, and Ta Babeda from the tribe to the north were given gifts, delighting the Chief, who was told about Wonder Island's wonders and invited to visit.|"['1.

In the north, the Umbolos, believed to be cannibals, intrigued John. Chief Ta Babeda warned about Chief Rumisses. John sought permission to bring the Korinos. The Chief agreed if John entered the caves with them. They journeyed to the cave, the Chief by John's side. Superstitions surrounded the caves, only the Korinos dared enter. Near the ocean, a hill overlooked the cove by the cave entrance. Flashlights illuminated the caverns, revealing signs of life. The Korinos fled, leaving a trail southwards. Uraso and Muro pursued them to the cannibal tribe. John and the boys revisited the cave, discovering new chambers. Four rooms led to a large circular chamber with a mound.

The copper box was brought aboard the ship. Updates arrived from Uraso and Muro. Discussions on mesmerism and hypnotism ensued, emphasizing concentration and their impact on receptive minds. The Korinos were in the care of a cannibal tribe. John recommended sailing north for twenty miles and waiting for their arrival. The journey continued, passing by a cinnamon tree and discussing cinnamon suet, minerals like sulphates, and copper ores. The significance of omens across cultures was explored. A shelter was prepared for the night, signals were exchanged, and the cannibal village was spotted. Earthenware cooking tools were observed. The group encountered the first natives, including the feared Chief and a peculiar hunchback with a smile. A surprising discovery awaited them—a white man.

A group of boys found themselves facing a challenging situation on an island. Determined to uncover mysteries and protect themselves from a large group of natives, they devised a plan. John suggested moving to a sheltered spot on the island's eastern ridge, which could be easily defended. This strategic move aimed to buy time to communicate with their ship for reinforcements. The boys understood the importance of diverting the natives' attention while they established their new base. With caution, they set out along the hill's southern crest to avoid detection, leaving a few companions behind as a decoy.

John suggested a location two miles away. Muro and a trustworthy tribesman scouted ahead, sending the runner back to report the path was clear. As they neared the site, the runner rushed back, warning of approaching natives. They paused, sending a message to Uraso. Suddenly, shots rang out near Muro. John quickly planned to assist him. They advanced quietly, diverting attention from Muro. John led a small group towards Muro's location while the others hid. Shots from Muro and a volley to the right caused chaos among the natives.

The natives were amazed as Tarra tried to communicate with them, but they remained silent. Tarra then turned to Harry, showing a sign of friendship. The leader, seemingly a chief, demanded the wounded man be handed over to them. Harry assured the chief the man would be returned safely once healed. The chief accused them of planning to sacrifice the man, but Tarra clarified they didn't believe in such acts. Threatening to kill them all, the chief was surprised when Tarra revealed they had guns. The chief's men disappeared, and Uraso and his group arrived, sharing their experience of tricking the savages.

He told the group they were friends, not foes, and tried to persuade them with promises of rewards. When they refused to negotiate, he resorted to using his rifle to demonstrate his power. The sound of the shots startled the boys, but it didn't have the desired effect. Unfazed, he confidently walked away, daring them to follow. His boldness left them stunned, unable to act against him. Sensing danger, he concealed himself, anticipating John's next move. His intuition was correct as John's signal cleared the area of the lurking natives. The boys accompanied John partway up the hill, where they spotted the natives trying to surround Muro. They quickly devised a plan to seek shelter and communicate with the locals. John identified the distant drum sounds as instruments used by various tribes.

John encouraged the men to seek answers themselves, promoting discussion that encouraged independent thinking. The evenings were enjoyable for both the men and boys. John emphasized the importance of caution to avoid surprises, especially since the natives might be alarmed. The clear night sky revealed the Southern Cross and bright stars like Sirius and Canopus. John discussed the Babylonians' division of the heavens into twelve parts based on the Zodiac, suggesting a common origin for similar beliefs across different tribes. He also mentioned the theory of the lost continent of Atlantis, pointing out evidence of landmass changes and similarities between structures in different parts of the world.|"[""1.

At night, the boys heard drums beating on Wonder Island. Muro and Uraso went scouting after the evening fun. Early the next day, the boys found out about their adventures. The main village was three miles north of a rocky point, housing around five hundred people who believed in Hoodoos and witch doctors. Despite difficulties in communicating with the natives, John, Muro, Uraso, and the boys were eager to learn more. They heard drums before nine o'clock and prepared to head to the village with some warriors. John instructed the boys to stay back and only join if they heard heavy firing. Uraso went to investigate an unusual gathering nearby. The group cautiously made their way towards the village, observing huts and signs of farming along the path.|['1.

Muro's observation was correct. It was evident that some villagers had captured a man, causing the commotion. John speculated about the possibility of another tribe on the island. The announcement had a significant impact on everyone present. The large man in the center, believed to be the Chief, was surrounded by men in distinct attire. John explained that the Chief and his witch doctors were there to intimidate them. As the Chief and his men advanced, John, Uraso, and Muro stepped forward to address him. Despite being accused by the Chief, Uraso remained composed. When the Chief ordered Tarra to kneel, a confrontation ensued, leading to a surprising turn of events. The Chief and his men were left bewildered by the unexpected outcome, highlighting the mysterious power at play on Wonder Island.|"[""1.

Exciting events unfolded on Wonder Island as the witch doctor hesitated when ordered by the Chief. Noise can instill fear, even in the most intelligent, as seen in reactions to thunder and lightning. The drums used by savage tribes to drive away bad spirits demonstrate the power of loud noises. John returned from the United States with Silencers to muffle gun sounds, using smokeless powder for added effect. The islanders were awestruck by the white Korino's thunderous voice and the weapon he held. When the Chief stood firm against the white man's power, the witch doctor obeyed, leading to a pivotal moment. The use of the revolver with a silencer showed John's intent to avoid lethal force.

They saw the target of the volleys, a signal for their party members at the rocky cove. They also spotted the Korinos watch. Remembering the witch doctors on Wonder Island, they searched for caves. In their excitement, they forgot about their treasure hunt. John thought of the treasure and the limestone formations hinting at caverns. They decided to observe and map the entrances. Their rear guard appeared, surprised by the village and the bodies. John tended to the wounded, gaining the villagers' trust. They found injured villagers and treated them with care, earning respect. George and Harry helped, finding a mysterious enclosure. Curious, they opened it, revealing prisoners. The group was thrilled and eager to explore further.|"['**1.

"When the Chief entered the village, he first saw the broken stockade. He gazed at it silently. Some elderly men approached, sharing stories of kindness. Back at his own home, untouched and unharmed, the Chief couldn't comprehend the White Chief's actions. Learning that Uraso and Muro were Chiefs of tribes on Wonder Island surprised him even more. They mentioned the White Chief's desire to show him their village, where people and Chiefs lived happily. John, with Uraso's diplomatic help, showed kindness to a poor woman and her child, leaving the Chief astonished. The villagers and warriors from Wonder Island mingled peacefully, exchanging stories and gifts. John, knowing the Chief's thoughts, suggested not mentioning the gifts to avoid any vengeance.

Muro, on John's behalf, expressed gratitude for the invitation and confirmed their willingness to participate in the ceremonies. He mentioned leaving gifts at the seashore on the other side of the island for the host and requested assistance to retrieve them. The villagers watched in awe as Muro and his group departed. Following instructions, Muro left a message at the landing and returned swiftly with the packages. They found the ship anchored nearby, and after a brief exchange with Stut, they set sail around the island. The villagers were hesitant to board the vessel until they were presented with gifts, which changed their minds.

The boys reminisced about their time on Wonder Island, where they survived on clams and built a water wheel and a shop. As they watched people preparing for a feast on the shore, they realized the islanders prized clams, unlike those on their previous island. They signaled a passing ship and were overjoyed to see their friend Muro onboard. The villagers were amazed as the ship anchored and goods were unloaded. The boys helped carry the packages to the Chief's house. The feast that followed was reminiscent of their first night on Venture Island, with an array of food but a shortage of fruits.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the boys survive on while on Wonder Island?\nA) Fruits\nB) Fish\nC) Clams\nD) Coconuts\nE) Seaweed', 'Question 2:\nWhat did the boys build while on Wonder Island?\nA) Treehouse\nB) Bridge\nC) Boat\nD) Water wheel\nE) Lighthouse', 'Question 3:\nWhat did the islanders on Wonder Island prize according to the passage?\nA) Coconuts\nB) Fish\nC) Clams\nD) Seaweed\nE) Fruits', 'Question 4:\nWho did the boys see onboard the passing ship?\nA) Chief\nB) Villager\nC) Muro\nD) Merchant\nE) Sailor', ""Question 5:\nWhere did the boys help carry the packages to?\nA) Shop\nB) Ship\nC) Chief's house\nD) Village square\nE) Beach"", 'Question 6:\nWhat was reminiscent of their first night on Venture Island during the feast?\nA) Shortage of food\nB) Abundance of fruits\nC) Lack of seafood\nD) Array of food\nE) Lack of villagers']"|"['C) Clams', 'D) Water wheel', 'C) Clams', 'C) Muro', ""C) Chief's house"", 'D) Array of food']"
The island natives were skilled at roasting meat, especially ground hog caught by the boys on Wonder Island. They used a long stick to skewer the animal and roasted it over a fire. Unlike Venture Island, where stews were common, the Wonder Island natives roasted all their vegetables. They also found wild potatoes and taro roots to eat. The boys learned about the medicinal properties of the taro root from John. The women served the food while the men prepared it, following a traditional family arrangement. The next day, the boys witnessed a ceremonial spectacle where the natives wore colorful cloth weaved from plant dyes.

When the group stepped out of their hut in the morning, they were greeted by strange figures all around the village. Despite the bizarre sight, everyone was joyful, and they couldn't help but smile and laugh along with the rest. Each man carried a spear, but what caught their attention was that the spear-points were covered with colored material, symbolizing peace and no harm. The boys noticed the American colors on the spears and wished they had a flag to match. The idea brought laughter and dancing. The boys, along with the Chiefs, embraced the festive spirit. The village was filled with music, thanks to the boys bringing band instruments from the States.

The Korinos followed, indistinguishable from the day before. John signaled Uraso and Muro to join as chiefs. The White Chief advised on marching to the forest, placing the band and flags in front. The procession began, led by the tall man and John. They circled a magnificent magnolia tree, where the tall man struck it thrice, followed by the Korinos.

A fire was quickly lit, and a man knelt by it, placing two stones on opposite sides. He then took a powder from a small container and dropped it into a bowl. After lifting a flower and dropping it into the bowl, the people resumed their natural positions and started dancing. The Chief spoke to Uraso, and the band played a lively tune. The dance began with the music, and everyone twirled around, some becoming frenzied. The Chief joined in, spinning around. Each person danced individually, not with partners like in civilized dances. When the band paused, the people rested but continued the merry party when the music resumed. The grand dance lasted until noon.

In ancient times, many tribes had specific rituals they followed religiously. For instance, the Druids, a group of priests among the Celtic people, revered plants and considered the mistletoe a cure for all illnesses. They believed it grew more on the oak tree, making it sacred. The Druids would cut it with a golden knife in elaborate ceremonies. These rituals were seen as sacred traditions. The people would return to a delicious meal after their morning adventures. The Chief invited his companions to a feast where they were surprised to find each place set with a couch and ample food. Despite the simple utensils, the meal was enjoyed immensely. The Chief, like many savages, indulged in the feast, a practice that might seem excessive but was a source of joy for them.|"['1.

They went on a tour and wandered through the village. No one seemed to notice them as they strolled past the huts. The village resembled a massive picnic area with all the food being consumed outdoors. On their way back to the Chief's house, they spotted the hut where the Korinos were kept. To their surprise, two of them were sneaking out, led by a prominent figure peeking from the hut's side. Later, in the afternoon around five o'clock, the village transformed. The boys explored the surroundings, fascinated by the monkeys in the trees. They were especially amused by a small creature with a beard-like feature. John identified it as a Jacchus, related to Marmozets and Tamarins, active like squirrels and surviving on nuts, seeds, roots, and fruit. The natives gathered around the Palace, and a striking native with a large knotted club appeared. He wore a loin cloth made of various animal skins, with decorative bands on his ankles, a leaf collar, and a unique headpiece made of fish scales and streamers. His weapon was a long club with a gnarled knot at the end. The Chief, on the other hand, was adorned in colorful clothing and wore a crown of thorns with human hair braided around them.

The villagers quickly became aware of the situation, causing chaos to erupt. They lost all sense of order and started running around. The Chief's angry expression was evident, and he didn't bother to hide it. With great force, he gave an order, and three men were brought forward, looking terrified. These men were the guards who failed to prevent the escape, as the boys realized. The guards couldn't defend themselves as they were as surprised as the Chief. Uraso and Muro updated John on the conversation. The careless guards were chosen to replace the Korinos as sacrificial victims. The Chief led the procession towards a rocky area where a stone table stood. The Chief was about to execute the victims when Uraso intervened, claiming that the Great Spirit would disapprove. The Chief was pleased and spared the men, allowing them to live.|"[""1.

The boys observed their surroundings, feeling a mysterious enchantment they couldn't comprehend. It was an extraordinary sensation for them. The crowd remained motionless. The Chief stood frozen, pale-faced, with wide eyes fixed on the scene before him. Suddenly, John leaped forward, raising his arms high, causing the three men to collapse and lie motionless on the rock. John then gestured, but there was silence despite the numerous onlookers. As John signaled for the men to be raised, the Chief and the people realized they were lifeless. John's gestures brought the men back to life, stunning the audience. The Chief acknowledged John's power and ordered the destruction of those who deceived them. The wives of the men rejoiced, but John commanded them to descend the rock. The Chief, speechless, agreed to follow the White Chief's guidance.|"['1. What was the initial reaction of the boys to their surroundings?\nA) Fear\nB) Joy\nC) Confusion\nD) Awe\nE) Disgust', '2.

Late in the night, the natives stopped dancing, marking the end of the festival. Uraso and Muro discovered that this festival was different from previous ones after speaking with the locals. The next day began with a rainstorm, preventing any excursions. John intended to resolve the fate of the Korinos before further exploring the island. Due to the storm, John spent the day tending to the sick and wounded. They visited a white man found in the village stockade, who had conversed with John previously. The man mentioned a large man with brown hair, an ex-navy officer, and an exploration companion. The boys were eager to learn more about the island's tribes from the rescued natives.

While exploring the island, the boys and their friends were summoned to the Chief's house by John. Upon arrival, they discovered that the gifts meant for the women and children had been unpacked and were ready for distribution. The presents included lace, cotton fabric, beads, ornaments, and dresses, which delighted the recipients and the Chief. John proposed to organize the gifts so that everyone received items of equal value. The boys, along with Uraso and Muro, worked diligently to prepare the gifts. As they continued their preparations, plans for an expedition to the north, where the Umbolos tribe resided, began to take shape. The boys were intrigued by the prospect of uncovering the secrets of the caves in the north, especially the one associated with the Korinos.

The group set out to free the Korinos that afternoon. As they marched up the street, a band played a lively tune. Led by the Chiefs and John, they headed towards the cave on the eastern slope of a high hill overlooking the ocean. Inside the cave, the darkness was daunting. John explained they needed to move further in before using flashlights. They searched for signs of the Korinos, finding warm food scraps but no living beings. Following a hidden path, they discovered another cave entrance to the north. John, Uraso, and Muro decided to split up: the boys would investigate the cave while Uraso and Muro pursued the fleeing Korinos. The exploration revealed abandoned tools and guns, hinting at a mystery surrounding the Korinos' sudden disappearance.|['1.

The boys explored a mysterious cave and stumbled upon ancient copper vessels, possibly left by buccaneers. As they ventured further, they discovered a hidden chamber with a strange mound in the center. Upon closer inspection, they found a metallic box buried beneath the stalagmites. Excited yet cautious, they decided to open it later. The chamber's walls were smooth, leading to speculation about its purpose. With the box in tow, the boys returned to the village, where they learned of a trail leading to a tribe in the north. Concerned, they sought advice from the Chief, who shared their surprise.

After returning to the village, Uraso and Muro quickly shared news that the Korinos had reached the tribe to the north. They decided against pursuing them further, a wise choice commended by John. Mesmerism, once thought to be a force from the mesmerist, is now known as hypnotism. To induce a mesmeric state, one must focus the mind on a specific thing while making gentle passes. Catalepsy can be triggered by fear, excitement, or excessive joy. John planned to visit the northern tribe but rejected taking many warriors to avoid a hostile perception. Instead, he set out with a small group, choosing to follow the eastern hills to stay connected to the sea. The journey was rugged, with gullies and jagged rocks, evidence of the island's geological history.|"[""1.

During their journey, the group encountered various superstitions among the native people, like believing in the significance of seeing three black birds. John pondered whether these beliefs were any different from superstitions in civilized societies. He shared examples from England, where encountering specific numbers of magpies held different meanings. The conversation led to discussions about lucky and unlucky signs prevalent in different cultures, including Scotland. As they continued their march, they found a suitable camping spot near a brook.

A group of people, including John and his family, took on the task of giving out gifts to the locals. The most alluring items were decorative pieces, a choice John had foreseen. He believed that material wealth like gold and silver wouldn't bring true happiness. Instead, he valued the importance of providing employment and teaching kindness to foster happiness. John also pondered on the significance of understanding human history and evolution, emphasizing the value of selflessness and caring for others.

In 1816, Davy made a significant discovery during his experiments. He found that a flame could not pass through a fine wire gauze. This led him to invent a lamp surrounded by gauze, known as the Davy lamp. By enclosing the flame in gauze, it prevented explosions.

John explained to the boys about a Spanish navigator who discovered a cave in 1620 with remains of hundreds of people and a vast amount of treasure, mostly in solid gold. The discovery led to fights among the adventurers. Only one man survived, Juan Guiterez, who was imprisoned for nearly twenty years. He left a chart in prison with many details but no location of the island. The boys examined the chart and found similar marks to those on a skull at Wonder Island. They explored the cave, finding skeletons, tablets with hieroglyphics, tools, and metal implements. Despite no treasure, they were content as John achieved his lifelong goal. They discovered another cave outlet to the north but decided not to explore further. They discussed the findings on the islands, marveling at the products and skills of the natives.|['1.

John expressed his agreement with the idea of helping others. He believed that while treasures like gold and silver are valuable, the true treasure lies in assisting those in need. He compared the superstitions of some societies to those of savages, highlighting how misconceptions can lead to unusual beliefs. John also discussed the connection between genius and insanity, citing examples like Blind Tom, an illiterate musician with exceptional talent. The discussion then shifted to the discovery of two islands, with plans to explore them thoroughly. John emphasized the importance of providing for the future and educating the villagers. The narrative concluded with a tale of Chief Beralsea's unique views on theft and punishment on the southern island.|"['1.

We were told that a dreadful place awaited us, where a man's sentence extended to his entire family, and escape seemed impossible. However, upon arrival, we discovered a picturesque village with advanced inhabitants ruled by a kind chief. The ruler graciously cared for a white man who had lost his memory and mobility. Ephraim and his family were warmly welcomed aboard the _Pioneer_, where they marveled at the luxurious cabin, musical instruments, and entertainment. Overwhelmed with joy, Ephraim shed tears, touched by the experience. John comforted him and introduced him to the ship's library. The villagers warmly greeted the visitors, eager to learn from them. Plans were made to establish regular sailings between the two islands, fostering friendship and trade. John invited the leader to visit Wonder Island to learn and share knowledge with his people.|"['1.

"When the news reached Retlaw, he felt conflicted. ""I'm a prisoner here, bound by Chief's law,"" he lamented. John reassured him, ""I've arranged everything. You're needed in Unity, the Capital of Wonder Island. Hutoton isn't as dreadful as Chief Beralsea painted it. He seeks your help."" It's crucial to note that their time unit was different; three suns equaled three years for them. Retlaw denied ever visiting the island before, creating doubt. As they sailed near the village, George reminded them of a pending task. Ephraim suggested naming the island, recalling the natives called it Rescudada. The log officially named the island Rescue. The villagers, led by Chief Ta Babeda, greeted them warmly at the landing. The Chief was intrigued by Ephraim's unique appearance and accepted the token. Ephraim humbly explained his background and mission. The group convinced the Chief to join their voyage to Wonder Island, sparking a new chapter of adventure."|['1.

Ta Babeda, a native, marveled at the wonders aboard the ship. The ship's band enchanted him, but the piano and music box fascinated him more. The kitchen, where food cooked without fuel, captivated him. Ta Babeda puzzled over the electric lights and cooking switches. When he touched the wires, a spark scared him, making him think the wires were mad. Despite this, he was eager to learn about the new world and asked many questions. Ephraim reveled in sharing the world with his children. John saw the impact and invited the whole family to visit the city. A storm forced an overnight stay on the ship, making the journey to Wonder Island adventurous.|"[""1.

The vast sea, devoid of any sight of land, captured the interest of the locals who admired the native sailors. They observed every action on the ship, from lowering the sails to adjusting the angles of the sheets and steering with the tiller. The _Pioneer_ relied on its sailing capabilities rather than its small engine. The boys mentioned plans to install a larger engine upon their return to the island. As the storm subsided at dawn, a change in direction was welcomed. Many natives fell ill, and John administered Atropine, a new remedy. They spotted Wonder Island's eastern end, the mountain range, and the headland with the skull and inscription. Excitement grew as they neared the dock and the landing stations of different tribes. The steamship _Wonder_ was spotted heading towards Enterprise River as the _Pioneer_ led the way. The sight of flags and the city square stirred emotions among the travelers. Upon docking, the first to disembark were Sutoto and Cinda, reuniting with their families. The boys greeted everyone warmly, appreciating Cinda's fashionable attire. The arrival sparked excitement, especially with the anticipation of Blakely's visit to the magnificent island.|"['1.

The Chiefs, in this new plan, were to get a share of the land, with the rest split into a state fund for schools and administration, and the rest given to the people to choose their own plots. A survey of the islands was done to ensure proper land deeds. To encourage building homes on the farms, Blakely and John provided lumber at a low cost, paid for by the land's produce. They also arranged for farming tools, seeds, and training. Many Americans arrived to invest in the island, but after some were found cheating the locals, the Professor intervened to ensure fair deals. The people were encouraged to keep their land and farm it themselves. Schools were founded, and English was taught. The state funds were used to bring teachers from the US to educate the islanders. The Korinos and Krishnos became efficient teachers, and the island's exports grew significantly in just six months.|"['1.

John expressed his happiness with Ephraim's decision, suggesting that Ephraim's daughter should also stay for educational benefits. Ephraim agreed, seeing the value in his wife and daughter staying. Ta Babeda followed suit, allowing his children to continue their education. Meanwhile, the boys remembered their factory and the old water wheel. They were determined to keep it despite its age. The boys had been preoccupied with new developments and visitors, forgetting about the copper box and the paralyzed man found at Hutoton. The man was showing signs of improvement despite his paralysis. The boys and Sutoto discussed a matter that required the Professor's presence. They passed by the schoolhouse and entered a beautiful street lined with trees and flower beds. Sutoto mentioned having trouble with the carburetor of his car, which he had brought back from his wedding trip. The boys were known by their first names, George and Harry, on the island.

The parade of the vehicles drew a crowd from all directions to see the self-moving wonder wagons. The old Chief was particularly excited by the unusual sight. Sutoto and Cinda had kept the surprise of the autos a secret, planning a grand reveal. The Professor, the boys, and Sutoto were absent that morning, leading to the disclosure of the surprise. The Chief hesitantly got into the Professor's vehicle, and they slowly set off. The speed gradually increased to fifteen miles per hour, astonishing the Chief. Impressed, he decided he wanted one for himself. Sutoto then entertained the Chief, showing him the country's beauty and the work being done.

"""There must be no more commotion now,"" the Professor stated. ""Let's transfer the box to the next room."" John carefully lifted the skull from its place, along with other brownish material. The skulls were nearly identical, with inscriptions on each side. Beneath the box, John found more material which he unwrapped eagerly. The parchment revealed hieroglyphics that intrigued the Professor and John. In the adjoining room, an old man awaited their return. He seemed lost in thought.

Perhaps this man held the key to the enigma that began with the note in their boat. As they returned to the island, Retlaw's health improved, and he began visiting the Professor frequently.

I decided to join him on the adventure and fund the trip due to the intriguing stories he shared, aligning with the information provided by Blakely. It felt like a thrilling escapade, and I also wanted to reconnect with old friends on the island. We set sail five months after the _Juan Ferde_ departure, reaching the island where I had been stranded years ago. Facing challenges with the locals who were at war, we eventually explored a second island southward, where a sudden storm wrecked our ship. Stranded, we made our way to the southern shore, encountering high mountains. As we journeyed along the eastern coast, we found remains of a fire, hinting at possible inhabitants. Despite setbacks, we pressed on, eventually reuniting with companions and discovering clues that rekindled hopes of finding hidden treasures.|"['1.
