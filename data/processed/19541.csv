Susan Blue, how do you do? May I walk with you? Let's go to the meadow where cowslips grow! Little Blue Shoes, don't go far alone, you might fall or lose your way. Better hold your sister's hand. When you're older, you can go alone. Hear the trumpets blow, come see the show. The Cat runs up a tree, the Bird flies away. Peggy and Susie, naughty you are, going too far and high. It might be a Giant or a Princess up there. No prying into others' affairs or houses. Come back before it's too late. Be good and never naughty again. Posies and Roses for our heads, good wishes we bring. Sailing in a big ship over the sea when we grow up. Belinda prefers the orchard with flowers. I love my Green House in the country. Baby, what will you see today? Quack-Quack, Peacock, or Lambs at play? Baby, a young Petsy, a sweet Dear, growing older.|"[""1.
