"Four Boy Scouts from the Beaver Patrol, Chicago, were camping on Moose River. They were athletic teenagers in khaki Boy Scouts of America uniforms. Moose River spans nearly 300 miles of wilderness from Lake Missinale to Moose Bay. The boys - Sandy Green, Will Smith, George Benton, and Tommy Gregory - had traveled far from civilization. Their camp was 50 miles upriver from Moose Factory, a historic trading post. These boys had explored the Pictured Rocks, the Everglades, and the Continental Divide. They were chosen by Mr. Horton, a Chicago lawyer, for a dangerous mission to the Hudson Bay area. Traveling by Canadian Pacific to Missanabie, then to Lake Missinale, they bought a ""Mackinaw"" boat for their journey. They faced challenges with mosquitoes and ""bull-dogs"" in the swampy Hudson Bay region. The boys prepared to combat the pests and settle in for their stay."|"['1.

"As the sun dipped below the horizon in the vast wilderness to the west, the boys hurried to add more wood to the crackling fire. The forest echoed with the calls of birds, and curious eyes peered from the undergrowth. ""This is way better than Chicago,"" exclaimed George, setting a sizzling skillet of ham on the fire. ""In the city, we're stuck indoors with dishwater smells. Out here, our dining room is a thousand miles of nature."" Tommy chimed in, ""In Chicago, you can't catch fresh fish from the river like this. Here, you just run out, grab one, and voil√†!"" With a head-net in hand, one of the boys dashed to Moose River's edge, returning in minutes with a hefty whitefish. The wilderness north of Lake Superior offers year-round fishing, from cutting through ice in winter to various fishing methods like nets, spearing, and fly-fishing. The boys marveled at the Indian tradition of stringing fish like beads on sticks for winter sustenance. While cooking and sharing stories by the campfire, the sound of approaching paddles prompted a cautious investigation. Armed with a revolver and a searchlight, two boys ventured into the dark, only to return breathless and disheveled after a mysterious encounter."|['1.

The boys were unfazed by the incident and eagerly devoured their meal. After clearing the dishes, Will turned to his friends with a serious expression. He explained the reason for their presence in the Hudson Bay country, linked to the theft of the Little Brass God from Mr. Frederick Tupper's house in Chicago. The boys were on a mission to locate the stolen item, believed to hold a secret will. The Little Brass God was a mysterious object that could only be opened by someone who knew its secret, raising questions about the motives behind the theft.

"""How did the French Canadian manage to take the Little Brass God out of town?"" Sandy inquired. ""Well,"" explained Tommy, ""if you give a French Canadian trapper enough brandy, he'd sell anything for another drink. Maybe he pawned the Little Brass God."" Tommy added, ""But if he really wanted the will, he'd have taken it out of the Little Brass God and carried it away. He could have destroyed it in a minute!"" Just as Tommy was about to ask more questions, Will signaled for silence. The fire's light illuminated the surroundings, casting shadows everywhere. Suddenly, they heard a soft footstep nearby. George rushed to the back of the tents and discovered a mysterious figure peering inside. The intruder, dressed in woodsman attire, fled into the forest. George followed, but the fugitive's woodcraft skills made it challenging to keep up. George eventually lost sight of the figure, who seemed to believe the pursuit had ended. George cautiously approached a log cabin and peered through a glass pane, seeing a blazing fire inside. Shivering from the cold, he continued to explore the cabin, hoping to find more clues."|"['1.

The boy, George, knocked on the door of the log mansion, hoping to return the owner's call promptly. Finding no response, he entered the empty room and discovered a frightened boy hidden in the lower bunk. The scared boy, Thede, explained a story involving a Little Brass God that the owner of the mansion, Finklebaum, was eager to sell for a high price. Thede was sent to retrieve the idol but realized Finklebaum might cheat him out of the reward. Instead, he befriended a man with rings in his ears, hoping to find the Little Brass God. However, after searching the man's room, they found nothing. George and Thede shared a laugh at the absurdity of the situation.|"[""1.

Thede adamantly denied knowing anything about the hidden Little Brass God, claiming innocence and insisting that he was only interested in becoming a trapper. George, on the other hand, tried to play off his presence in the wilderness as a misunderstanding, saying he had followed Thede out of curiosity. Pierre, the trapper, remained suspicious of Thede's intentions. George pondered the situation, realizing that both Thede and Pierre seemed to be after the same mysterious object. He wondered if Pierre was actually on a mission from a pawnbroker to retrieve the Little Brass God. This revelation made George question Thede's honesty and made him consider the possibility that Thede might not be fully aware of the true nature of the situation. The mystery of the Little Brass God deepened as the three individuals found themselves entangled in a quest for the elusive artifact.|"[""1.

The boy pondered whether the Little Brass God had been robbed of its treasure before reaching the pawnshop. He dismissed the idea, reasoning that the thief would know if the will was still hidden inside the toy. While the boy thought, Pierre and Thede had dinner. George declined, having eaten recently. After dinner, Pierre left with his rifle, giving George a stern look. The boy wanted to discuss the situation with his friends who were also searching for the Little Brass God. Concerned about Pierre, they ventured through the wilderness. George used his flashlight cautiously to avoid being followed. The night grew colder, and snow began to fall. Thede identified their location as Bear Ridge, eight miles from the cabin. Worried about the boy's safety, they decided to search for him.|['1.

Will argued that the Little Brass God was stolen from a house on Drexel Boulevard, containing a will worth millions. The toy was then sold to a pawn-broker, who passed it to a trapper in the Hudson Bay district. Mr. Horton and Sigsbee are aware of the toy's final destination. Will mentioned that if a burglar took the toy, the will might be inside it. Tommy expressed suspicion about the trapper visiting their camp. The boys waited by the fire for their missing friend, George, thinking he sought shelter due to the snowstorm. Will stayed up to keep watch, ready to fire a signal if needed. Meanwhile, Tommy and Sandy navigated the wilderness with electric lights as the snow deepened. They lit a fire with dry bark and built a makeshift shelter to keep warm.|"['1.

"""I hope George shows up soon,"" Sandy remarked. ""I might go check the thicket once I warm up. I thought I heard a call nearby."" The boys were cozy in the cave, watching the bears growl. Thede joked about the bears regretting not fighting them. George spotted an opening under the hill. He noticed a light coming from another cavern and saw someone by a fire.

In the wilderness of India, a valuable Little Brass God has gone missing, sparking fears of violence from a delegation of East Indians seeking its return. As Will and Pierre investigate, they encounter a mysterious half-breed who inspects their camp with suspicion. Following tracks in the snow, they uncover a tale of lost boys caught in a storm.

The boy realized the half-breed knew the hills well and had a plan. Pierre likely knew other entrances to the cavern and would block them. The boy worried about his missing friends, suspecting they might be in a trap like him. He didn't know why Pierre was being brutal. Unaware of Thede's suspicions about the Little Brass God, the boy hurried to the south end but found a dead end. He heard voices and recognized Tommy's. Calling for Thede, he got no response. Gathering wood to warm up, he searched for his missing friend. Despite losing his revolver, he still had his search-light. Reflecting on the strange events, he questioned Thede's loyalty and innocence, wondering if he was manipulated by someone cunning.|"['1.

George shared the tale of the adventures from the night before, leaving out any mention of the Little Brass God. While speaking, a vague feeling crossed his mind that the face of the man by the fire resembled the man before him. He dismissed the thought, doubting the man who abandoned him in the cold cave would be the same who saved him. Antoine deftly skinned the animals with a sharp knife, crafting two bear rugs. They ventured through the snow to a fur-lined cavern with a chimney for smoke. After tea, the trapper's face distorted, and the boy fell into a deep sleep. Cracks widened, connecting chambers. The boys recounted the night, mentioning the mysterious Little Brass God. Tommy speculated about the hidden exit, prompting a realization about the cave's purpose.|"['1.

Thede suggested the Little Brass God might be the cause of their troubles, hinting that Pierre may be involved. Thede proposed a plan to outsmart Pierre by trapping him in his own prison. As they discussed their escape, a gunshot was heard, followed by rocks falling. Will suspected another trapper was involved, not Pierre. Thede mentioned a wounded boy missing from the bear cavern. Antoine, their host, prepared a meal of bear steaks and tea. While pouring the tea, a strange sound caught Will's attention. Suddenly, the boys overturned the table, spilling the tea, suspecting foul play. Antoine's initial anger turned to a smile, leaving the boys puzzled by his behavior.|"['1.

Antoine, instead of dropping the knife, seemed ready to pounce. It was clear he hadn't given up on getting his gun. Will swiftly flung the weapon he had grabbed, causing the knife to clatter to the ground as Antoine's wrist broke. Tommy followed, holding Will's gun, but Antoine had vanished towards the cavern. The boys circled the chamber, tapping the walls and listening closely. Behind a bear skin, they found George, weak from blood loss and drugs. George whispered about Antoine having the Little Brass God and suspecting their quest. The group agreed to stick together, wary of Antoine's motives. They pondered over Pierre's involvement and vowed to bring the Little Brass God back to Chicago. Will urged unity, emphasizing the danger of wandering off alone. Thede mourned Pierre and suggested a proper burial.|"['1.

"""Sure, we'll do that!"" agreed Will. ""But what is puzzling me just now is this,"" the boy continued, ""how are we going to get out of this hole with Antoine watching our every move? He'll shoot us down just as quick as he shot Pierre if he gets a chance."" The boys searched for Antoine but found only tracks leading to the caverns they remembered. ""I don't think Antoine will bother us,"" Thede said. ""He might take the Little Brass God and disappear until he thinks we've left."" Will disagreed, fearing Antoine might stay hidden in the hills. Sandy suggested moving to the cabin after crafting a sled for George. The journey to the cabin was tough, and they found footprints and smoke from the chimney. Inside, the cabin seemed deserted, but recent footprints puzzled them. Thede wished to find the Little Brass God to claim a reward.

In thirty minutes, Sandy and Will returned to the cabin with supplies from camp. They mentioned finding tinned goods hidden in the snow halfway between the cabin and the old campsite. After a satisfying meal, they tidied up and gathered by the fire, chatting until ten o'clock. Securing the cabin, they settled into their bunks, well-covered with blankets and bear skins. In the dead of night, Will stoked the fire quietly. He then noticed a figure resembling the Little Brass God peering through the window. The next morning, they discovered footprints in the snow, leading them to suspect an East Indian connection. Will shared his theory of an intruder using hypnotic tactics to disturb their peace. Determined to protect themselves, they vowed to confront any further disturbances head-on.|['1.

"Will exclaimed, ""We read about such events in the papers daily! People get hypnotized and follow orders, not just in private but even on stage. Sometimes, the hypnotic effect is aided by exotic scents. It's not strange at all! There's only one word for it, uncanny.""

Tommy interjected, ""There's a broken window, blood in the snow, and we found Thede on the floor. That's solid circumstantial evidence!""

Sandy chimed in, ""This Little Brass God is irritating! We've faced smugglers, rattlers, and train robbers, but ghosts? That's too much!""

The boys spent the day hunting near the cabin, bagging rabbits and squirrels for a stew. They anticipated another visit from the mysterious figures but kept silent, pondering Antoine's fate and the hidden provisions. Tommy joked about adding wild animals to the stew, while Thede suggested owl meat for a change."|"['1.

The friends trudged through the marsh, heading towards their camp. Thede mentioned the possibility of finding ducks by Moose River for Tommy's stew and perhaps spotting wild geese. Signs of woodland creatures were everywhere, with tracks crossing their path frequently. Thede recalled Pierre mentioning the cold weather affecting the animals. As they neared the old campsite, well-trodden snow and tracks hinted at recent activity. Tommy speculated about the mysterious Little Brass God and the pursuit it had sparked. Will suggested staying put to search for Antoine and the enigmatic Hindu. They gathered game for provisions, planning to explore the hills. Will teased Tommy about his bedtime habits, and the group split up, ready to embark on their individual journeys.|"[""1.

While they chatted, a dark figure cast a shadow over the rectangular beam of light at the entrance. A tall man with a bandaged wrist leaned on a rifle, glaring at them with hatred in his eyes. Antoine stared at the boys motionless. Will and Tommy feared trouble, debating if they could draw their guns before he aimed his rifle. The boys had wondered if Antoine had left, but his sudden appearance answered that. Will pondered whether to mention finding the idol. Antoine shared about George's injury and a sleeping potion. Will debated sharing a midnight visit but decided against it. Antoine mentioned strange footprints in the snow. The boys left, and Antoine fled upon seeing them. Oje, a fisherman, joined them.

As they walked past where the hidden supplies were kept, Sandy glanced at the Indian, wondering if he had taken the food. The Indian, however, paid no attention to the empty cache or Sandy's suspicious looks. At the river, the Indian tested the ice, then moved to a small island to fish. The boys watched as he prepared his fishing gear meticulously, cutting fish-line and attaching hooks with fat pork bait. It was a cold but sunny day, perfect for fishing. After a successful catch, they headed back. Oje, the Indian, led them differently, observing tracks and finding footprints of two people, one in moccasins and the other in regular shoes. Thede then explained a plan to use fire to lure out bears, while Sandy lit a fire successfully despite initial struggles.|"['1.

To the boys' surprise, the Indian didn't return to the safety of the branches but stayed behind the tree trunk, as if expecting wild animals. The fire grew, making the boys uneasy. Soon, three figures emerged in the light - the boys realized the bear had eaten the fish. Sandy suggested they could have escaped during the feast. As they reached for their weapons, they noticed the limb they were on was burning. Trying to move to safety, they fell, landing on a bear. Suddenly, Antoine appeared exhausted. Oje, without a word, led them through the snow towards the hills. In the dark forest, they followed Oje blindly. Spotting three fires, Oje signaled. The boys saw flames and smoke rise as they trudged on, hoping to reach safety soon.|"[""1.

The Indian seemed wary of the campfires ahead until the boys assured him that their friends had built them and good news awaited. Bathed in moonlight, the hills made the Indian cautious, sticking to shadows. Encouraged by the boys, he moved towards the fires where they spotted Will and Tommy adding green boughs for smoke signals. Sandy speculated that someone chased the Indian, while hunger drove them all to find food. Exploring caverns, they found two men who vanished when Antoine appeared, leading to a search for an escape route. Tracks in the snow led them to a hidden opening in the cavern floor, hinting at an escape path. As the moon shone bright, footprints disappeared, leaving the cabin quiet but lit from within.|"[""1.

Will recounted the events to his friends. Antoine, after shooting Pierre, seized the cabin and hid the Little Brass God there. The boys discovered Antoine's fear of the East Indian, who kept returning to the cabin. They suspected the Brass God was hidden there. After a restless night, they searched and found it in a log. Inside, they found Simon Tupper's will. The boys embarked on a wilderness journey to reach Chicago, enjoying hunting and fishing along the way.
