The French Revolution can be viewed in two ways. One perspective focuses on the dramatic events that shocked Europe and America, such as the storming of the Bastille, the march on Versailles, the September massacres, the Terror, and Napoleon's restoration of order. Historians often hurried over the peaceful times that separated these tumultuous events, attributing the upheaval to a supposedly rotten social fabric and the suffering of the French people. However, another viewpoint sees the Revolution as a culmination of ideas that had been brewing for a century, fundamentally altering the civilized world. While these ideas had flaws, they were necessary for the stage of civilization at the time, emphasizing induction and sensation as the sole methods of reasoning and idea origin. Recent studies on French society in the late 18th century have shed new light on this historical period, with scholars like M. Albert Babeau contributing significantly to our understanding.|"[""1.

In the study of history, various researchers and writers have contributed valuable insights. Authors like M. Bailly, M. de Lavergne, M. Horn, M. Stourm, and M. Charles Gomel have provided essential information on the financial history of France. Similarly, works by M. de Poncins and M. Desjardins shed light on the cahiers, while M. Rocquain delves into the revolutionary spirit pre-revolution. The Comte de Luçay and M. de Lavergne offer perspectives on ministerial power and provincial assemblies. Moving into the world of philosophy, thinkers of the eighteenth century introduced new ideas that challenged existing norms. They questioned why a select few should govern the masses and why labor and sorrow were prevalent. These philosophers sought to reform society based on logical principles, paving the way for democracy to emerge as a powerful force. France became a battleground where old traditions clashed with new ideologies, shaping the course of history.|['1.

In history, new ideas often take time to blossom fully. The beliefs we hold in our youth are the ones we cling to most. In the time of Louis XV in France, thinkers like Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau planted seeds of change. But it was Louis XVI who faced the challenge of implementing these ideas. When he ascended the throne in 1774, he wielded vast power, seemingly absolute. Yet, the landscape was complex. The old ways of governance were being challenged by new philosophies. The king was expected to provide strong leadership, but the old structures were not easily dismantled. The Parliament of Paris, disbanded by Louis XIV, was reinstated by Louis XVI, showing the delicate balance of power. While the dream of democracy loomed on the horizon, the French people still looked to their king for guidance and reform.|"['1.

The king's councils were the heart of the state's governance, totaling five in number. They were interconnected, with the king expected to participate in all and attending three regularly. The prime minister joined the most crucial three, while the finance controller and chancellor were pivotal members, ensuring unified actions across the boards. Each council had a limit of nine members, except for the Privy Council, which was larger and acted as a training ground for the others. These councils, including State, Despatches, Finance, Commerce, and the Privy Council, played essential roles in legislation and judiciary matters. They initiated laws and held appellate jurisdiction over private cases, reflecting the king's duty to administer justice. The king's involvement in decision-making showcased the monarch's sovereignty and the tradition of seeking justice from royal judges.|"[""1.

During the ancient regime in France, the executive power was mainly controlled by the councils, particularly the Council of State. This council, also known as Conseil d'en haut or Upper Council, was responsible for making decisions on significant foreign and domestic matters. The administration became increasingly centralized over time, with even minor details requiring approval from the king and his council. The Council of Despatches oversaw disciplinary actions and managed various aspects of governance, from infrastructure projects to educational institutions. To handle the vast array of administrative tasks, the king relied on bureaux and secretaries of state. Local matters were often decided by officials in Paris or Versailles rather than in the regions where they arose, leading to a bureaucratic system that hindered local autonomy. The intendants, appointed by the royal councils, played a crucial role in governing the provinces, overseeing legal matters, religious affairs, agriculture, commerce, military issues, and more. They acted as direct representatives of the king, contributing to the centralization of power in France and the erosion of local freedoms.|['1.

During the time of Louis XVI, the French administrative system faced challenges due to corrupt practices. The intendants, who were lawyers by education and not administrators, lacked full knowledge of their duties as they were frequently transferred between provinces. They resided mainly in Paris or Versailles, making brief visits to the provinces they governed. Their power was vast, with minimal oversight, and they controlled the flow of petitions to the king. Subordinate officers called sub-delegates managed smaller districts but were often tempted to misuse their authority for personal gain. The royal governors, once powerful, had diminished influence compared to the intendants. The centralized government, if well-managed, can be efficient, but corruption and incompetence can lead to widespread issues. The French administrative system was plagued by corruption, favoritism, and inefficiency, requiring significant reform efforts.|"['1.

In old France, the court symbolized a ring where power circled among those seeking favor. This system governed countries with weak or indifferent leaders, be they monarchs, chambers, or the masses. Louis XVI of France lacked assertiveness and social grace, often seen chasing servants with dirty laundry. Despite his clumsiness, he possessed education, memory, and reasonable judgment. He admired Henry IV and aimed to make his people happy but lacked the firmness to support good policies. His conscientiousness and courage were commendable, yet his inability to stick to a course of action made him a weak ruler. His advisors changed frequently, as he was reluctant to cede authority. Ultimately, his indecisiveness overshadowed his good intentions, making him a poor king.|"['1.

The French court during the reign leading up to the French Revolution had a significant impact on the country's direction. Comprising individuals close to the king, such as the royal family and high-ranking nobles, access to influential positions was often granted through favor rather than merit. The court held sway over appointments, influencing the flow of benefits from the king. Louis XV was influenced by his mistresses, while Louis XVI was easily swayed by the last person he spoke to. Courtiers formed factions, engaging in intrigues, bribes, and alliances, with court ladies playing a prominent role. Wealthy families like the Noailles and Polignacs wielded considerable power, while poorer nobles resented their dominance. The courtiers considered themselves a class apart, with strict social hierarchies and distinctions. Despite public disdain, the court was viewed as a legitimate power, with its legitimacy ingrained in diplomatic language. The court's extravagant expenses and perceived self-importance often clashed with the needs of the state, leading to tensions and power struggles within the court itself.|['1.

In the 18th century, the French government was a complex mix of administration and useless courtly traditions. The ministers of state, upper civil servants, and even the king's military staff were considered part of the court. Various departments like hunting, buildings, royal journeys, guard, police, and ceremonies added to the bureaucracy. The royal household had about fifteen thousand members and cost forty-five million francs annually. Many officials served only three months a year, requiring multiple officers and salaries. The administrators were often self-serving politicians, with only a few like Turgot and Malesherbes being conscientious. Necker and Calonne were dismissed for trying to reform finances, while Vergennes kept his post by staying subordinate. The French government's inefficiency and corruption led to frequent changes in leadership.|['1.

"The palace of Versailles was a hub of activity, drawing in courtiers and curious visitors who adhered to a strict set of rules known as ""Étiquette."" While some may view etiquette as unnecessary, it plays a crucial role in regulating social interactions. Etiquette is a universal code that guides behavior in all societies, ensuring smooth communication and understanding among individuals. For instance, Americans remove their hats in churches, Englishmen shake hands, and Africans greet by rubbing noses. Etiquette provides a sense of order and predictability in social settings, preventing confusion and misunderstandings. However, the elaborate etiquette at the French court during Louis XVI's reign was criticized for being outdated and restrictive. As society evolved, privacy became valued, and the need for excessive formalities diminished.

Madame Campan, a former attendant to Marie Antoinette, detailed the intricate rituals of the queen's daily toilet. The Lady of Honor and the Lady of the Bedchamber led the service, following strict rules. The Lady of the Bedchamber dressed the queen, while the Lady of Honor assisted with washing and undergarments. When royalty attended, roles shifted accordingly. During one incident, as the Queen was dressing, unexpected visitors interrupted. The Duchess of Orleans and the Countess of Provence arrived, leading to a humorous mishap with the chemise. Despite her aversion to court etiquette, Marie Antoinette maintained regal elegance and charm, excelling in public appearances.

The country faced deep debt during a costly war in the queen's reign. Despite the need for financial prudence, the queen spent extravagantly, often incurring debts. She favored expensive court offices and showed generosity to undeserving favorites. Her influence on the king's decisions leaned towards extravagance over the nation's welfare. While she acknowledged private charity, she neglected the taxpayers' concerns. Marie Antoinette's preference for certain ministers over others, like Choiseul, who had the country's interest at heart, led to her unpopularity. The privileged orders of Clergy and Nobility, though numerically small, held significant wealth and power. The Clergy, criticized for being a state within a state, owned vast lands and were relatively fair landlords.

During the period, the clergy of France faced financial challenges. They had accumulated a debt of around 134 million livres by borrowing money instead of taxing their members directly. To cover expenses and debt interest, they taxed themselves over 10 million livres annually, despite being exempt from many regular taxes paid by French citizens. The clergy's income, if distributed fairly, would have been sufficient for all members. However, the funds were unevenly divided among the clergy hierarchy, with bishops receiving varying salaries. Most bishops were nobility, and they could hold multiple benefices, leading to accusations of worldliness. Yet, some bishops were dedicated to their spiritual duties, living modestly and engaging in charitable acts.|"['1.

Some noble houses were transformed into prestigious chapters where the ladies living there were exempt from the vow of poverty. They dressed in fashionable attire, welcomed guests, and could leave to marry if they wished. An example was the chapter of Remiremont in Lorraine, led by an abbess who held a high position. She had luxurious possessions and traveled widely, even attending theaters. The canonesses in the chapter followed similar lifestyles, some traveling frequently while others entertained guests at the convent. To join, a lady needed to prove her noble lineage dating back nine generations.

The parish priest's status was quite favorable aside from material considerations. He enjoyed a level of independence and legal protection for his livelihood. His home size varied based on his resources, but his influence within the community was significant. With more education and exposure to the outside world than most parishioners, he often provided information to the provincial intendant about village affairs. The priest's connection to his fellow villagers was strengthened by his shared experience of tending to a piece of land, be it a garden, orchard, or vineyard. The priest's servant, a robust young woman, handled tasks like milking and weeding. The priest played a vital role in village life, offering support to the sick and grieving, as well as sharing in the joys of weddings and funerals.|"['1.

During the 18th century, the Catholic Church in France faced a significant challenge from Philosophers who vigorously attacked its doctrines. This assault drew widespread attention due to the rapid intellectual movement in France at the time. The Church's close alliance with the civil power made it nearly invincible, with the Pope wielding immense authority. The Church's assumption of infallibility and its control over various aspects of life led to a lack of tolerance towards differing beliefs. The Church's strict control extended to matters like marriage and property rights, creating an environment where dissent was met with persecution. The Church's power was upheld by a complex system of governance and the use of spiritual and temporal sanctions, like excommunication, to maintain authority.|"['1.

During the sixteenth century, Protestant churches broke away from the Church of Rome, carrying some of its intolerance. People often wrongly claim that religious tolerance has only been advocated by the weaker side. However, this is not true. Tolerance has been most sought after by those who needed it the most. It was a significant step forward when people began to see religious tolerance as valuable. In the eighteenth century, the idea that the state could treat all religions equally was not widely accepted. Slowly, influential thinkers like Locke, Bayle, and Fénelon started promoting religious tolerance. They believed in absolute liberty for all, regardless of their beliefs. While there were still limitations and exclusions, the concept of tolerance was gaining ground in society, paving the way for a more inclusive and peaceful coexistence.|['1.

During the mid-18th century, the harsh treatment of French Protestants by the Church began to lessen. The last known execution for heresy in France occurred in 1762, and in 1767, soldiers attacked a Protestant meeting. By the late 1700s, the last prisoner for religious beliefs was freed from the galleys. Despite this, only the Roman Catholic religion was officially recognized, leading to legal challenges for Protestants. Marriages had to be performed by Catholic priests, and only Catholic clergy could conduct essential functions like recording births. This led to issues where faithful Protestants couldn't legally marry, and their children were considered illegitimate. Over time, the Protestants made progress, and attempts were made to advocate for their rights, but faced resistance from the clergy and government.|['1.

"The significant change was imminent. During the final day of the initial session of the Assembly of Notables in the spring of 1787, Lafayette suggested a petition to support the Protestants. The proposal was met with overwhelming approval by the committee, and the Count of Artois, who presided over the committee, presented the petition to King Louis XVI. The king agreed to the proposal, and a decree granting civil rights to Protestants was included in a set of bills for approval by the Parliament of Paris. The relief provided was limited, not allowing followers of the Protestant faith to hold public office or conduct public worship. Despite this, there was strong opposition, fueled by some nobles and clergy. The debate in the Parliament on January 19, 1788, was intense. D'Espréménil, a counselor, vehemently opposed the tolerance, invoking Christ's image on the wall and asking, ""would you crucify him again?""

"The group of writers who followed this path are commonly referred to as the ""Philosophers."" It's challenging to consistently use this term when talking about French thinkers from the 18th century. Sometimes, it was used for anyone advocating changes in church or state. In a stricter sense, it refers to a specific group among them, like Voltaire and his close supporters, particularly the Encyclopaedists. Voltaire once said in his ""English Letters"" that their philosophers would never form a religious group as they lacked zeal. However, this turned out to be untrue as they did form a sect during Voltaire's time, although it wasn't exactly a religious one. The key figures were like leaders in this sect. The beliefs included materialism, fatalism, and hedonism. The sect continues to exist, and its members have always shown intense passion for their ideas. They value tolerance but openly show disdain for those who disagree with them. The group has had both admirable individuals and those with strong, unwavering opinions. Among the opponents of the French Church, Voltaire stands out as a significant figure. He was a respected poet, a skilled historian, and a brilliant writer known for his wit. However, above all, he was an adversary of the Catholic Church and all forms of religion. For over four decades, he led the Philosophers' faction and was a prominent figure in French literature.

"When Voltaire was released by his tormentors, he sought justice from the Duke of Sulli, but to no avail due to the powerful Rohan family. Despite appealing to the court, he found no redress as his enemies falsely accused him of writing an offensive epigram. Frustrated by the lack of support, Voltaire turned to fencing and rowdy companions. Though he was not one to engage in physical altercations, he was eventually locked up in the Bastille after a challenge. After a brief stay, he was exiled to England in 1726. During his three years in England, he immersed himself in the language, associated with prominent writers, and studied influential thinkers.

Voltaire criticized the priesthood, especially in France and England. He noted that the Anglican clergy in England were more disciplined than the French clergy in morals. English ecclesiastics were educated at universities, away from temptations, and entered church positions at an older age. Unlike in France, where young men could quickly rise to high positions, English priests had to earn their promotions through long service. Most English priests were married, leading to more reserved behavior. Voltaire also compared the debauchery of French clergy to the more reserved English priests.

"John Locke, a renowned thinker born in 1632, revolutionized French thought in the 18th century with his theories. He spent 20 years developing his ""Essay on the Human Understanding,"" which challenges the notion of innate ideas. Locke asserts that all ideas come from sensation and reflection, rejecting the idea of pre-existing knowledge. He believed virtue is valued for its benefits, not intrinsic qualities, and that conscience is our judgment of moral actions. Memory recalls past experiences, while wit and judgment involve idea assembly and discernment. Locke delves into the concepts of substance and spirit, arguing that both lack clear definitions. While he leans towards materialism, he acknowledges the limitations of human understanding in discerning the nature of these concepts.

During the 18th century, the Church of France faced challenges from writers like Voltaire, causing both anger and concern among its members. The clergy struggled to respond effectively, as skepticism was already prevalent. A satirist once described the difficulties priests faced when trying to correct or approve of worldly men. The Church lacked influential figures like Bossuet or Fénelon, relying instead on weaker defenders. Responses from figures like Archbishops Lefranc de Pompignan and Elie de Beaumont, as well as Jesuit Nonnotte, were often inconclusive. The Church's objections to Locke's teachings on metaphysics and innate ideas were met with differing perspectives, hindering fruitful debate. Despite attempts to reconcile conflicting views, discussions often devolved into vitriol between the Church and philosophical opponents like Voltaire and Rousseau.|"['1.

"During the reigns of Louis XVI. and his predecessor, the Church of France faced a battle of words between its clerical writers and the Philosophers. The Philosophers critiqued the church's inconsistencies, with Rousseau and Voltaire even contradicting each other. Pompignan discussed the Philosophers' worship of science and doubts, while Chaudon cleverly criticized Voltaire's thin-skinned nature. Palissot mocked Diderot and friends in a comedy, and the Archbishop of Paris condemned Rousseau's ""Émile."" The church's arguments, like those of Chaudon and Nonnotte, sometimes presented Catholic doctrine clearly. However, in that era, the champions of Catholicism were not as skilled in debate as their adversaries. The strength of a church, it was noted, lies in its saints rather than its debaters.

In France, the Nobility was a significant social class, but different from the English peerage. While English nobility passed to the eldest son, creating more of an office-like system, French nobility included all those not engaged in daily work, along with many lawyers. The nobility, totaling about 100,000 people in 25,000-30,000 families, owned a fifth of France's land. They often leased their land to farmers, receiving rent or a share of crops. The nobles also obtained payments, labor, and other services from tenants. Despite their privileges, many nobles spent time on their estates, managing farms and tenants, though some absenteeism existed.

In old France, there were distinctions among nobles based on wealth and family prominence. The nobility was divided into the very rich, with prominent families, and the moderately well-off. Wealth was often a prerequisite for acquiring titles and status, as it was necessary to shine at court. Court life cultivated both good and bad qualities, with the French nobility known for their manners and sometimes questionable morals. French society emphasized politeness, grace, and amiability, with mothers playing a crucial role in educating their sons on social etiquette. French society valued distinguishing between different social interactions and expressing courtesy with lightness and grace. Frenchmen of that time were courteous, especially towards ladies, showing respect and using proper language and behavior. These customs, though fading, have left a lasting impact on social interactions in France and beyond.|['1.

Friendship among men used to be so strong that it could sometimes overshadow family bonds. Even if someone faced misfortune like a fallen minister or disgraced courtier, their friends stood by them with kindness. Unfortunately, in today's fast-paced world, this virtue is fading. People are too busy to show constant care and attention to those around them. It's often believed that friendships are only formed in youth, but in the past, friendships were valued at all ages. French people may be irritable, but they excel in social graces, making others happy. In the 18th century, Paris resembled a small town where intimacy was valued over mere acquaintanceship. Family ties were stronger back then, with benefits and consequences shared among relatives. French court manners were mostly impeccable, but exceptions existed, especially with Louis XV and Louis XVI.|"['1.

During the time of the French nobility, eccentric behavior was not uncommon despite the emphasis on etiquette and manners. For example, the Count of Osmont had a habit of fidgeting with objects and would use a snuff-box in a rather messy manner, much to the chagrin of those around him. Even in the midst of elegant surroundings, such as at Madame de Vassy's house, he would disregard social norms. The French nobility, especially the upper echelons, had ample leisure time compared to others. While English gentlemen engaged in various activities like farming and hunting, French nobles often found themselves with leisure to spare. They indulged in society and romantic pursuits, excelling in the art of conversation and intrigue. Adultery was somewhat accepted, with illicit relationships governed by their own set of rules. Despite occasional lapses in morality, the French nobility of that era were known for their refinement in social interactions.|"[""1.

Not all nobles in the army had the same opportunities. There were two distinct classes among the officers. The lower ranks like ensigns, lieutenants, and captains were usually from poorer noble families. They earned little, served long, and had slim chances for advancement. On the other hand, colonels and second colonels were often young men from influential families who obtained their positions through connections. These wealthy officers spent lavishly and were promoted easily. The nobility at court also had exclusive privileges, with only the highest nobles allowed to become general officers. While the poorer nobility served diligently, the courtier colonels enjoyed rapid promotions. Despite regulations requiring age or service, the court families always secured the best positions, leaving little room for advancement for hard-working officers.|['1.

The soldiers' uniforms were snug and closely fitted, likely inspired by the Prussians. The notion of the army as a well-oiled machine probably originated in Germany. This concept was a natural outcome of the military practices of that era. Frederick the Great's troops were not all native to his land; many German rulers recruited foreigners. The French army also had regiments of foreign soldiers. Soldiers were poorly paid and treated, leading to high desertion rates. To maintain control, strict discipline and precision were crucial. The soldiers were tightly bound by rules and uncomfortable uniforms to limit their freedom. Despite these constraints, French soldiers excelled in elegance and poise. Some officers prioritized appearance over effectiveness. Criticisms were common, but underestimating the French soldier proved to be a grave mistake. Soldiers had meager food and pay, with most funds going to uniforms and basic needs. Barracks were cramped, with soldiers sharing beds. In sickness, military hospitals offered better care than public facilities.|['1.

During the years before the French Revolution, efforts were made to reform the French army due to lessons learned from defeats in the Seven Years' War. The soldiers were well-formed and well-clothed, though not better fed than before. The Duke of Choiseul, an able minister, made improvements, but progress was reversed when the Duke of Aiguillon took over. Louis XVI inherited a disordered army and navy and attempted reforms through the Count of Saint-Germain, an old soldier. However, the count faced challenges due to his foreign ideas and opposition to certain military practices, such as flogging with a specially made sword. While some saw this punishment as efficient, others found it degrading. The reaction to such disciplinary measures varied among different nations, with the French soldiers having a harder time accepting it compared to their English and German counterparts.|"[""1.

"Some foreigners in the French service found the soldiers' sensitivity to be ridiculous. The Count of Saint-Germain sought advice from a seasoned major in the Nassau regiment. The major, who had worked his way up from the lower ranks, shared his perspective: ""Sir,"" the veteran began, ""I have endured many beatings, and I have delivered many, always to my benefit."" The era was marked by a spirit of change, with young officers eager to experiment.

The French army's discipline relied more on the leaders' personal characters than on rules. During Louis XVI's reign, France was mainly involved in a war in America. Lafayette praised the French discipline, mentioning how even animals roamed freely in the camp without disturbance. Rochambeau shared stories of soldiers respecting apple trees in their camp. The army's discipline was upheld by dedicated generals, officers, and soldiers' good morale. However, the French army's discipline was not always consistent, especially during times of change and unrest. Besenval noted that the troops' actual lack of discipline exceeded his expectations. The French army's discipline varied depending on the leadership and circumstances, and discontent during the monarchy's final years weakened it further.|"[""1.

During the late 18th century in France, the Calotte society, formed by French army lieutenants, aimed to groom young officers in manners and behavior. Led by the senior lieutenant of each regiment and a general chief for the entire army, the Calotte enforced politeness and discouraged misconduct. However, as tensions rose between France and England in 1778, discipline within the Calotte society began to waver. When two colonels offended Breton ladies by claiming their seats, the Calotte ordered a public punishment, narrowly avoided by a quick-thinking aide-de-camp. As the French Revolution loomed, dissent spread through the army, with younger officers rebelling against traditional discipline, inspired by English officers as models of freedom. This shift in attitude ultimately led to insubordination among soldiers, notably the French Guards, who later played a role in the early stages of the Revolution.|['1.

The French militia of old, comprising around sixty to eighty thousand men, played a key role in wartime garrison duties and occasional drills during peacetime. With a service term of six years, only about fifteen thousand men were enlisted annually, a small number compared to the population of twenty-six million. However, militia duty was unpopular due to conscription and numerous exemptions, placing the burden on the poorer peasants. In contrast, the French navy during Louis XVI's reign boasted around seventy ships of the line and an efficient fleet, although materials and construction did not always match the design. Despite some losses in naval battles, the French navy held its own, benefitting from broader ships that allowed them to fight in rough waters. French naval officers, mostly noblemen, received thorough training, but some lacked true seafaring experience. Overall, the navy faced challenges with administration and supplies, leading to epidemics on fleets.|"['1.

In the 18th century, the French navy faced less public unrest compared to the army due to their specialized focus on marine affairs. A significant part of the French nobility were involved in legal matters, with the Parliaments playing a crucial role. The Parliament of Paris, comprising members of high nobility like Peers of France, held judicial power and political influence. The magistracy, including various courts and tribunals, carried great importance. The church and the Parliament engaged in political struggles, with the Parliament having limited powers like the right to remonstrate against the king's edicts. The method of passing laws involved the king issuing edicts for registration by the Parliament. Conflicts between the Parliament and the king could lead to severe measures, including imprisonment or exile of judges. The Parliament of Paris had a prolonged dispute with the church, reflecting theological differences between Jansenists and the Church of France.|"[""1.

In the eighteenth century, France was a kingdom divided into diverse provinces and cities, each with its unique customs and laws. The legal system was a complex mix of feudal customs and Roman jurisprudence. Legal experts sought to align feudal laws with Roman principles. In England, Lord Mansfield adapted common law to Roman ideas. Similarly, in France, jurists like Domat and d'Aguesseau worked to unify legal principles. However, the multitude of courts and conflicting jurisdictions, along with the varied customs across regions, led to confusion and frustration among the people. Voltaire questioned the inconsistency in legal judgments across different provinces. This diversity in legal rights and the desire for uniformity shaped the legal landscape of the time.|"['1.

In the past, the judicial system had its flaws. Higher court judges were generally honest, but in lower courts, unfairness was common, especially in tribunals tied to lords. Bailiffs in these courts often favored lords they worked for. Even in Parliaments, judges were influenced by personal connections, unlike English and American judges who act as neutral arbiters. French judges, on the other hand, were more involved in cases, which could lead to bias and corruption. Bribery allegations were not uncommon, and powerful individuals could manipulate the system to their advantage by changing trial venues. Criminal proceedings were harsh, with prisons being overcrowded and unhygienic. Convicts were transported to the galleys, some serving decades in captivity. Despite better conditions in the galleys, long-term imprisonment was common.|['1.

Torture was a common method used to extract confessions from individuals suspected of crimes in various regions. Techniques such as applying fire to the body, pouring water into the mouth to distend the stomach, and using devices like thumbscrews, the rack, and the boot were employed. Accused individuals were interrogated in private without the presence of a defense counsel. Witnesses against them were only confronted once, after giving their testimony. Death penalties were common for many offenses, and thieving servants could face execution. The public would witness brutal executions, like being struck with an iron bar to break bones before being left to die on a cartwheel. These gruesome spectacles aimed to desensitize the public to the more humane guillotine executions.|['1.

Beccaria's book did not immediately change laws, but it influenced advanced thinkers. In 1766, La Barre was convicted in Abbeville for disrespect during a religious event. Despite popular outrage over a damaged crucifix, La Barre was not involved. The judges' bias led to an extreme sentence: public confession, tongue removal, beheading, and burning. The Parliament of Paris upheld this sentence, with King Louis XV refusing a pardon. La Barre's execution sparked anger and fear among liberals in France. Some defended torture, claiming it was necessary to find stolen goods. However, progress was made in the late 18th century with the abolition of preparatory torture in 1780 and the improvement of French prisons.|"[""1.

During old times, the Parliament of Paris had the authority to condemn books believed to be dangerous. The accused book was brought to court, objectionable parts were read, and it was labeled as heretical, blasphemous, and more before being burned publicly. This event drew street children and onlookers. In some cases, the author faced direct action, while in others, they were targeted through a royal order known as a _lettre de cachet_, leading to arbitrary imprisonment without trial. Though Anglo-Saxon societies find this practice outrageous, it was common in many nations until recently. The _lettre de cachet_ was a sealed royal order used for private purposes, resulting in long imprisonments without conviction. This method was seen as a means of preventing public harm and protecting families from disgrace, especially in France where family reputation held great importance.|['1.

"During the 18th century, the French Nobility faced criticism from common people due to their privileged status. Philosophers of that time aimed for equality and liberty, looking down on the past and its teachings. The term ""gothic"" was used as an insult for buildings, laws, and customs. The education of the Dauphin was discussed, with Lafayette suggesting starting French history from 1787, showing a tendency to belittle the past. The idea of equality was explored, with philosophers like Rousseau favoring a small republic with equal wealth distribution. They believed in natural laws applying to all, rejecting privileges for certain classes. This period marked a shift towards equality in civil rights, challenging the existing hierarchy in France."|"['1.

In ancient times, a great leader emerged, bringing laws and customs to a once barbaric nation. These rules were believed to have divine origins and led to the nation's prosperity. The reasons for the tribe's sudden transformation under one man's guidance are often unclear. Today, it is understood that each race's institutions evolve with them, shaped by their nature and history. While some believe in a sudden change of customs, others argue for a gradual evolution. The clash between liberty and equality is explored, with the idea that true equality requires external control. French thinkers like Rousseau championed liberty but inadvertently established systems contrary to individual freedom. Montesquieu, a prominent philosopher, emphasized the careful approach to societal change, recognizing both the benefits and risks of civilization's progress.|"['1.

The Pope, leader of Christians, was once a feared figure who could depose princes. Now, he is more symbolic. Bishops, under the Pope, create faith articles and grant dispensations. The Christian religion's complexity leads to debates among scholars. In French society, religion is a topic of dispute, with people challenging ecclesiastics without thorough examination. Montesquieu suggests having multiple sects for mutual oversight but advocates for tolerance over equality. He values morality over dogmatic religion, emphasizing obedience to law and love for others. The diversity of religions highlights the potential for misinterpretation.

"The French Philosophers of the eighteenth century had a unique view on sexual morality. They believed in two systems: one based on natural morals and the other on positive law or church ordinances. They argued that breaches of natural morals carried a greater stigma than those of positive law. For example, smuggling was seen as less disgraceful than theft. While some Anglo-Saxons and the French Philosophers categorized sexual crimes differently, emphasizing chastity, the philosophers criticized celibacy over marital fidelity. They observed various practices worldwide, such as divorce and polygamy, and criticized the church's emphasis on celibacy. The philosophers believed that civilization rested on sexual self-restraint, making chastity essential. While the ""Persian Letters"" discussed divorce and celibacy, later writings by Montesquieu avoided indecency. Despite their focus on virtue, chastity was not always considered a top virtue by these philosophers."|"['1.

Montesquieu, a French philosopher, embarked on a three-year travel journey after resigning from the Parliament of Bordeaux. He shared his experiences from different countries, stating that in France he makes friends easily, in England he doesn't, in Italy he compliments everyone, and in Germany, he drinks with everyone. He arrived in England in 1729, where he studied the country's liberty and equality. Montesquieu admired England as the most free country at that time, emphasizing the importance of limiting the power of both the crown and the parliament to protect liberty. His observations in England greatly influenced his views on government. Montesquieu's admiration for England and its political institutions contrasted with Voltaire's focus on philosophy and social life in England, contributing to the spread of English ideas in France during the mid-18th century.|"['1.

"""The Greatness and Decadence of the Romans"" is a philosophical history study similar to Machiavelli's Discourses on Livy. Both Machiavelli and Montesquieu valued republics but differed on monarchy. Montesquieu believed in the importance of property equality for a successful republic, while both authors criticized the Roman Church's rule. Montesquieu emphasized the danger of a republic's indifference to the public good, contrasting it with a prince's tyranny. He also noted that kings are less envied than aristocracies, praising republics where birth doesn't grant privileges. Montesquieu cautioned against disrupting established forms and customs, as they are rooted in a nation's spirit. He warned against imposing new laws on conquered people, as subjects can adapt to any form of government.

"Here is the refined version of the passage using the provided vocabulary for middle school students:

Montesquieu's ideas on the division of power were crucial and found in his book about the Romans. He believed that dividing public power among many offices would prevent abuse and maintain freedom. Although his ideas were not widely accepted in France, they greatly influenced the American colonies. The American colonists embraced the concept of checks and balances in government, leading to the successful establishment of new states. Montesquieu's work, ""Spirit of the Laws,"" further explored the relationship between laws and various aspects of society. He emphasized the importance of laws being tailored to fit the specific circumstances of a country. Montesquieu's ideas challenged the belief in a universal standard of justice and instead advocated for laws that consider the unique conditions of each society. His teachings had a lasting impact on the development of government systems in the United States."|"[""1.

Law, according to Montesquieu, is the application of human reason to govern nations. Each nation's laws should align with the government's nature, physical environment, people's way of life, liberty, religion, wealth, and customs. These laws must also consider their origin, purpose, and how they relate to each other. Montesquieu emphasizes that laws should match the people they govern. While he acknowledges general principles of justice, he highlights the importance of laws being tailored to fit the specific characteristics of each society. This idea was revolutionary in his time, challenging traditional views. He believed that factors like climate, religion, and historical examples shape a nation's laws. Despite criticisms, Montesquieu's teachings underscore the significance of laws reflecting the unique qualities of the societies they govern.|"['1.

"It is crucial to understand that Montesquieu, the author of ""Spirit of the Laws,"" had specific historical examples in mind when discussing different types of government. He referred to ancient Greece for democratic republics, early Rome and Venice for aristocratic republics, France and England for monarchies, and the East for despotisms. Education and laws should align with the principles of each form of government to strengthen its core values. In republics, virtue is essential, requiring selflessness and prioritizing the common good over personal interests. Equality and frugality play key roles in democracies, promoting a love for the state and limiting ambitions to serving the republic. It is advised to maintain old laws and customs in democracies to prevent degeneration, while moderation is key in aristocratic republics to avoid offensive distinctions and promote simplicity among the nobles."|['1.

Honor is a key principle in a monarchy, and laws should uphold it to support the nobility. Nobility, which is both born from and nurtures honor, should be passed down through generations with privileges and rights. It acts as a vital connection between the ruler and the people. While a monarchy allows for quick decision-making due to centralized power, there should be mechanisms to check the ruler's authority. This balance can be achieved through bodies like courts with defined rights, such as the French Parliaments. Montesquieu, a thinker of his time, favored monarchy over republics like France, believing it suited the era. He acknowledged the benefits of a republic's fairness but saw monarchy as more fitting for the circumstances. It is essential to temper power with moderation, as unchecked authority can lead to tyranny.|['1.

In every state, there are three types of power: legislative, executive, and judicial. A citizen's political liberty is the peace of mind they feel from being secure. To ensure this liberty, the government should separate these powers so that no citizen fears another. Monarchies in Europe usually limit the government's power, with the prince handling legislation and execution while appointing judges. In Italian republics, all three powers are combined in one body of magistrates, making it as despotic as an eastern prince. Montesquieu suggests that the judicial power should not be permanent and should involve citizens. He praises representative government and the freedom given to English Parliament members. He views the people as better at choosing representatives than deciding on issues. Montesquieu also supports the existence of a second chamber with distinguished members to prevent the common liberty from becoming their slavery.|"['1.

Montesquieu admired the English government, which influenced other countries. The modern English constitution, where power mainly rests in the House of Commons, has been imitated by many nations. In America, the division of powers goes even further, a principle highly valued by intelligent Americans. Montesquieu critiqued the church, especially in his youth, but later adopted a more philosophical approach. He argued that different religions are suited to different forms of government. Climate influences religious practices. Montesquieu believed in religious tolerance and warned against harsh penal laws in religious matters. He advocated for moderation in legislation, stating that political and moral good lies between extremes.|"['1.

"Montesquieu's ""Spirit of the Laws"" was disliked by some Philosophers due to his moderate approach. While sharing the distrust of the church with his peers, he avoided their extreme views. In his chapter on Uniformity, Montesquieu questions the idea of complete sameness in laws, religion, and practices. He argues that uniformity may not always be beneficial and that genius lies in understanding when it is necessary. Condorcet criticized Montesquieu's views, claiming they protected outdated beliefs. Montesquieu believed that laws should be based on fundamental principles but should also consider the differences among people. While some sought radical change, Montesquieu emphasized the complexity of human life and the need for thoughtful governance.

During the time of Louis XVI, the city of Paris was a bustling hub of activity, attracting people from all walks of life. The Third Estate, which included everyone not of noble blood, was a diverse group ranging from wealthy bankers to beggars. Within this order, there were privileged bodies and individuals, such as corporations, guilds, and cities. Paris, the capital of France, was flourishing with a population estimated between six to nine hundred thousand. The city was expanding rapidly, with new houses being built constantly. The public buildings and gardens were impressive, with many still standing today. The Luxembourg palace, once the residence of the king's brother, remains relatively unchanged, while the Louvre has undergone significant expansion. The Place du Carrousel, now a grand square, was once surrounded by houses and streets. Paris was a vibrant city, drawing in visitors with its charm and allure.|"['1.

The Palace of the Tuileries has a rich history dating back to Louis XVI's reign, eventually being demolished in recent years. However, the gardens, still called by its name, have remained largely unchanged. The gardens featured long terraces then, much like they do now, with sunny walks and shady horse-chestnut trees. Well-dressed individuals strolled or sat under the trees, while the common folk were only allowed in on select holidays. Respectable women would visit in sedan-chairs, alighting at the gate. The Place de la Concorde was once the Place Louis Quinze, with an equestrian statue of the monarch. The Champs Elysées, though rough, attracted people to watch carriages. The boulevards were fashionable, and the streets were narrow and shady, with irregularities and occasional squares. Despite complaints, Parisians enjoyed the uneven streets with gardens and bridges offering scenic views.|['1.

The tall, dark houses and narrow, muddy streets of the city lacked adequate water supply. Most residents relied on wells or buckets from the Seine. The absence of proper drainage led to overflowing street gutters during rain, creating obstacles for pedestrians. Houses lacked proper water conduits, resulting in torrents of water cascading down from roofs, causing chaos below. Manure spread on streets added to the muddy mess. Heavy snowfall overwhelmed the city, causing slushy pools. Despite the chaos, the streets bustled with carriages, threatening pedestrians. Nobility's carriages, now dog-led, sped through, causing complaints of accidents. Street cleaners occasionally cleared some mud, while signs and placards advertised shops and theaters. Musicians and ballad-singers added to the lively atmosphere. Amid the commotion, nimble citizens navigated carefully, avoiding the need for shoe-cleaning services.|['1.

In the late part of King Louis XVI's reign, the citizens of Paris were known for their elegant and colorful attire. Men wore striped coats in light blue and pink, paired with pale yellow waistcoats and breeches. Their hair was powdered and tied with a black ribbon, topped with a jaunty cocked hat. Accessories like handsome snuff-boxes, rings, and two watches were common, with lace cuffs adding a touch of sophistication. Women, on the other hand, sported stiff and elaborate dresses with long waists and large hoops. Their most striking feature was the towering hair structures, sometimes reaching up to three feet in height, often requiring skilled construction and even being rented out for practice. Fashion in Paris during this period was a blend of grace and extravagance, with vibrant colors and intricate designs setting the trend for the era.|"[""1.

During the time of Louis XVI, the common people in France dressed in bright and varied clothes, though not always clean. Bathing was not a common practice among the poor. The rich were fond of dressing up and spent money on elaborate clothing. The stark contrast between the rich and poor was more visible back then than it is today. The wealthy enjoyed luxurious dishes that were prepared by a team of servants. Bread was purchased from bakers and accounted for using notches on a stick. In Paris, there were extravagant food shops offering delicacies from various regions. Despite the appearance of simplicity, the nobility still indulged in opulent lifestyles. Today, the gap between the rich and poor is not as pronounced as it was during the reign of Louis XVI.|"['1.

In the past, the wealthy often entertained guests with open invitations for dinners and suppers a few times a week. Guests were free to drop in whenever they pleased after being invited once. This led to a group of well-dressed individuals who dined daily at the expense of their hosts. The middle class had simpler meals with meat included once or twice a day. Markets were unclean, and fish was expensive and of poor quality. Taxes at the town's entrance increased food prices, including wine. People bought provisions in small amounts, often bringing home just enough for one meal in old letters or printed paper. Coffee was a popular drink sold on the streets, while the poor drank liquorice water from mobile vendors. Richer individuals enjoyed punch and ices, contrasting with the less fortunate who opted for more affordable options.|"['1.

In the past, the poor sometimes had to settle for second-hand food, leftovers from the wealthy. In Paris, even the rejected scraps were sold, but at Versailles, where the king and nobles resided, people were eager to buy untouched dishes from royal tables. A pot with capons boiling in it was a common sight near the Paris poultry market, offering a boiled fowl with broth. The food variety was expanding, with the number of fruits and vegetables doubling in forty years. Society was divided into various classes, with some mobility for the able and ambitious. While financiers grew rich, they faced jealousy from others. The aristocracy frowned upon those with similar wealth, especially the revenue farmers. Despite this, some, like Necker, a foreign-born financier, gained popularity. Merchants in Paris held a lower status, often seen as mere shopkeepers or hucksters due to the lengthy bargaining process. Women were actively involved in managing shops, a practice that continues in France, uniting couples in business but sometimes leading to neglect of children, contrasting with Anglo-Saxon customs.|"['1.

Marriages in society were largely decided by parents, especially in lower classes, often based on financial rather than personal factors. While this arrangement may seem burdensome, it is widely accepted. Loyalty may suffer more than love between spouses, as seen in England and America where breaking marital vows is frowned upon. In contrast, French lower and middle-class couples exhibit strong unity, working together diligently and sharing simple joys. The French society values togetherness, unlike the separation seen in other cultures. In the late 18th century, Parisians enjoyed family outings to suburban retreats, fostering community bonds. Paris boasted skilled artisans and artists, but competition led to a decline in quality. Despite efficient policing in Paris, London faced security threats. Parisians lived peacefully while Londoners feared crime. Paris remained stable until internal government and military issues sparked the revolution.|"['1.

During this time, improvements in Paris began to show in various areas. While the fear of arbitrary arrests affected only a few citizens, safety on the streets, efficient fire services, and fair civil case resolutions were more crucial to most Parisians. The era also saw a rise in compassionate practices within hospitals, poor-houses, and prisons. Hospitals, like the Hotel Dieu, faced challenges with overcrowding and unsanitary conditions, but gradual enhancements were being made. In the medical field, surgeons were gaining recognition despite their humble origins. Surgery education thrived, with over 800 students enrolled. Inoculation was gaining acceptance among the upper class, while outdated medical practices like excessive bleeding were on the decline. The poor often turned to quacks or cheap remedies from grocers. Foundlings, brought to asylums tightly swaddled, faced high mortality rates but were sent to the countryside for care.|['1.

As the Revolution approached, a slight decline in religious fervor was observed, yet the church ceremonies remained grand. During Corpus Christi, a splendid procession moved through the streets adorned with carpets and tapestries. While some artworks on display were more decorative than pious, the procession continued with dignitaries and priests leading the way, even representing absent lords. The streets filled with kneeling crowds as soldiers escorted the sacred Host. Similar processions with elaborate displays occurred throughout the year, including one honoring Saint John the Baptist and another with Swiss guards. Despite occasional controversies, such as a procession involving a wicker figure representing a Swiss soldier, the events were marked by a mix of reverence and festivity.|['1.

In October 1785, a procession took place in Paris to raise funds to free prisoners from Algerian slavery. Three hundred and thirteen captives were led by brothers of the Redemption orders, each accompanied by two angels with ribbons and scrolls. The streets were filled with banners, music, and palm branches. The march included breaks for refreshments, leading to some captives and religious individuals indulging too much. Sundays saw shops closed, and people attending mass, especially during Easter. Simple processions with priests carrying the Host were common, with passersby kneeling as they passed. The city woke up early, with market gardeners heading home and clerks rushing to work by nine. Barber-surgeons and waiters were busy, while dandies on horseback tried to emulate English fashion on the boulevards.|['1. What was the purpose of the procession in Paris in October 1785?\nA.

"At noon, the Exchange buzzes with activity, while the Palais Royal gardens attract those seeking news and gossip. Bankers' antechambers overflow with anxious clients, and by two o'clock, the streets teem with diners-out, leaving no cab unclaimed. These cabs, often dirty and driven by drunken coachmen, contrast with the elegant cabriolets carrying clerks and upper servants. Scandalized onlookers criticize women riding unescorted, some even in pairs, in these frivolous vehicles. Dandies prefer the high-built English ""whiski,"" navigating through a chaotic mix of carts, drays, and wine casks. Travel options vary from comfortable traveling chaises to cramped _carrabas_, accommodating up to twenty passengers at a sluggish pace of two to three miles per hour.

In the late afternoon, around 5:15 PM, the streets become lively again. People are heading to the theater or taking a leisurely drive while others gather at coffee-houses. As darkness sets in, groups of carpenters and masons make their way to the outskirts of town. By 9:00 PM, the town is bustling with people going for supper, making the streets more chaotic. Disorderly scenes, once common in Paris but now rare, were allowed early in the evening in the past. However, by midnight, the police had cleared the streets of troublemakers. At 11:00 PM, the coffee-houses close, and the town grows quiet. Occasionally, the peace is interrupted by the rich returning home from late suppers or the sounds of the peasants bringing goods into the city. During the 18th century, French provincial towns were starting to modernize, with walls being torn down to create broad, straight streets and public spaces.|['1.

During the 18th century, houses were changing. They were getting taller, with rooms divided differently. Beds were moving out of kitchens and parlors, and more beds were being used. Walls were being painted or papered instead of tapestries. Houses were built thinly, and doors and windows were rattling. In France, most rooms were only heated by open fires. People wore thicker clothes inside, with wadded slippers to keep their feet warm. Chilblains were a common problem in the winter. Working-class clothing was becoming more colorful again. People were dressing similarly regardless of social class. Families in smaller towns practiced great thrift but lived comfortably. They grew their own food and made their own clothes. They pressed oil from walnuts and made bread from their own grain.|['1.

In small country towns, young boys and girls enjoyed freedom with moonlight walks and singing parties, leading to love matches. However, in larger towns, parents arranged marriages, focusing on pleasing elders over young men. Simple amusements like amateur music and recitations were popular in the middle class. Provincial society had a literary touch with people writing verses and making quotations. Dancing and card games were common, with balls lasting until the early hours. Social gatherings at balls included nobility, officers, and civil functionaries, promoting social equality in France. The journeyman lived with his master or in a separate room, dressing modestly and enjoying bread, vegetables, and wine. Wages were around twenty-six sous a day for men and fifteen for women, with long work hours but plenty of holidays filled with song, dance, and wine.|['1.

During the time of Louis XVI, the chances for a worker to advance in their trade were brighter than they are today. The number of journeymen did not exceed that of masters, leading to more opportunities for progression. Capital needed to start a business was modest, but fees for licenses were high. Guilds controlled all trade and manufacturing, enforcing strict monopolies. Only guild members could work as masters in a craft. Disputes between guilds were common, like shoemakers opposing cobblers for selling new and used shoes. Regulations even dictated the number of threads per inch in fabrics. Despite obstacles from guilds, inventors like Le Prevost succeeded by persisting against opposition, as he did with silk hats. Guilds maintained quality but sometimes favored masters over workers, leading to secret worker unions and strikes.|['1.

"In the 18th century, schools were set up in towns with different guilds like the schoolmasters and writing-masters. The clergy usually appointed town schoolmasters, while municipal authorities had some control. Boys were often taught by Brotherhoods, and girls by Sisters. Primary education was theoretically free and compulsory, established under Louis XIV to convert Protestant children to Catholicism. In northern France, there were evening and Sunday schools for adults and working children. Religious instruction preceded the ""first communion."" Secondary schools were more abundant in the 18th century, with 562 establishments in France in 1789, a third run by Brotherhoods. Boys at school lived modestly, as described by Marmontel.

In the 18th century, France experienced significant changes. Artisans in 1789 lived more comfortably than townspeople 50 years prior. The middle class enjoyed luxuries akin to nobility but still faced barriers. Common citizens, unless nobles, were excluded from top army, administrative, and legal roles. The nobility held prestigious positions that appealed to vanity and profit. Before the Revolution, French classes were merging, fostering jealousy. France's diverse landscapes and favorable climate provided abundant resources. Despite some portraying pre-Revolution French peasants as destitute, they were hardworking and resilient. Writers like Voltaire and Rousseau praised rural life and believed peasants were content and intelligent. The French nation's progress over a century doesn't mean it emerged from savagery. Peasants, though sunburnt and living in humble conditions, could still lead fulfilling lives.|"['1.

In 1789, an English traveler shared his surprise with his family about the French people's appearance. He noted their strength and well-made physique, observing scenes of industry and happiness as they passed through the country. The traveler admitted to having misconceptions about the French being insignificant and oppressed. Contrary to his beliefs, he found the men strong and the women, especially from the lower class, engaged in hard labor. The women carried heavy loads to the market, showcasing their strength and dedication. The traveler noticed the difference in lifestyle between France and England, with France seemingly more industrious and content.

Not all peasant women in France fit the glamorous image of powdered hair and earrings. Many worked hard in the fields, leading to bent figures and worn appearances, making them seem older than they were. Some even went barefoot, carrying their shoes on sticks to market. Thriftiness was crucial, as they gathered weeds to feed their cows. France wasn't all riches; there were vast wastelands with wolves and bears. Famine struck, worsened by government rules hindering food movement. In despair, some young people avoided marriage, not wanting to bring children into hardship. Despite challenges, most rural folks were diligent, content with their daily needs, often cheerful, akin to pre-Puritan English rather than modern Anglo-Saxons.|"['1.

In the past, France faced hardships due to wars, internal conflicts, heavy taxes, and poor governance. However, with Louis XV taking the throne in 1715, a period of recovery began. Over the next seventy years, the population grew from sixteen to twenty-six million, and land values increased. Despite this progress, not all regions thrived equally. For instance, Lorraine suffered setbacks after joining France in 1737. Moreover, a unique custom worsened the situation for small farms. When a landowner passed away, instead of dividing the land equally among heirs, each plot was further subdivided among children. This led to excessive fragmentation, with farms becoming extremely small. This practice was criticized by various scholars for its negative impact on agricultural productivity.|['1.

In rural France, the peasants face challenges due to strict game preservation laws that harm their crops. Poachers are punished severely, leaving the peasants defenseless against wolves. Laws exist to protect against landlords and gamekeepers, but enforcement is lacking. Those near hunting grounds face even more restrictions, like needing permission to build a wall to protect cabbages from hares. Crops can't be harvested early to avoid disturbing partridges. Deer and rabbits freely damage fields, causing animosity. The feudal system imposes rents and fines on peasants, limiting their land ownership.

In the past, peasants faced many restrictions. They had to use the lord's mill to grind corn and the lord's oven to bake bread. Additionally, they had to take their cows to the lord's bull. Sometimes, they were required to work on the lord's land for days. Certain customs, like making newlyweds jump over churchyard walls, were enforced. In some areas, peasants had to quiet frogs by beating water in castle ditches on specific nights. These practices were burdensome for the peasants and criticized by democratic writers. These customs originated from an old form of society that no longer exists. Feudalism started with military conquests, dividing land among chiefs' followers, creating a hierarchy where everyone had obligations to superiors. Peasants, who held no feudal duties, paid for land use or crops and services to lords. They accepted feudal lordship, viewing it as a divine order.|"[""1.

The kings of France had a long struggle to transform the loose chain of allegiance into an almost absolute monarchy from the tenth to the seventeenth century. The feudal lords lost power but retained wealth and privileges. Dukes and counts, once powerful, now served the king. Old customs persisted, like peasants working on lords' lands. Peasants believed in fair rent but found services degrading. Their homes were humble, with thatched roofs and no glass windows. Furniture was better, with large bedsteads as family hubs. In the 18th century, towns improved, but rural life remained unchanged. The peasants' discontent grew due to suspicions of unfair treatment, leading to stronger feelings of injustice.|"['1.

The village communities used to gather for public meetings on certain Sundays after church services. These meetings were held in front of the church or inside it, where the men of the village, led by their elected leader, discussed and decided on community affairs. Sales, land leases, and public repairs were approved, and the syndic, similar to an American selectman, presided over these gatherings. However, as the Revolution approached, these meetings began to transition to more formal boards. The syndic, along with tax collectors, had crucial roles in the community but received little pay or recognition. Serving the community was seen as a duty, and sometimes, less educated individuals were forced to take up these roles. This system of governance gradually changed as France aimed to balance the responsibilities and rewards of public service.|['1.

"In medieval villages, the lord's steward, known as the ""bailli,"" held judicial power and was considered above the common peasants, with his wife addressed as ""Madame."" The steward and the parish priest were highly regarded in the community. The schoolmaster, however, was below the priest and under his supervision. Schools were overseen by the communities, with clergy-approved candidates becoming masters. The village schoolmaster's position was modest, living in a two-room house with limited books and clothing. Students paid a small fee for education, and sometimes a parish tax supported the schoolmaster. School terms were seasonal, with scholars helping in the fields during breaks. Girls faced additional challenges in accessing education compared to boys, with mixed-gender schools being viewed unfavorably by higher authorities."|"[""1.

The determined young man sought ways to advance in life. Despite the burdensome taxes, he aimed to amass wealth, expand his father's land, and achieve a level of comfort and respect in his community. He realized that success was not limited to agriculture alone. Opportunities in law and medicine were within reach for a peasant's son. Even if reaching the highest positions required generations of effort, many paths to success were open to ambitious individuals. For those content with simpler joys, the village offered dances, weddings, fairs, and celebrations. Holidays provided a break from toil, allowing peasants to enjoy carefree moments.

The Provincial Estates in various provinces had members from three orders: the Clergy represented by bishops and abbots, the Nobility by nobles with titles over a hundred years old or fief possessors, and the third estate by mayors and town deputies. These orders sometimes sat together or separately and had powers delegated to small commissions between sessions for current affairs. The Estates were not democratic, with even commonalty representatives being privileged. They mainly negotiated taxes with royal intendants and divided them among territories. Despite limitations, the Estates were valued for local knowledge and patriotism. They had the right to petition, crucial for good governance. In old France, citizens expressing opinions were seen as troublemakers. The Estates' complaints were sent to the king through a _cahier_, influencing legislation. Louis XVI attempted local self-government reform in Berry and Haute Guyenne with assemblies for administrative tasks under close supervision.|['1.

"Eight years passed between the start of these experimental gatherings and the first Assembly of Notables at Versailles. These years were crucial in French history. Necker was removed from power, but the two new groups survived the changes made by his successors and did some valuable work. Even after losing his position, Necker remained popular and influential. His book on the ""Administration of the Finances"" was widely read, with eighty thousand copies sold quickly. In the book, he talks about his idea of Provincial Assemblies and praises the two that were formed. The Assembly of Notables in 1787 and Minister Brienne partially adopted Necker's ideas, establishing provincial assemblies across France. The assemblies were to have members chosen by the king and through elections. However, due to events in 1787, the elections did not happen. The assemblies met twice, showing promise for future usefulness.

Taxes in the past were shared among villagers, with each person contributing a portion. If someone couldn't pay, the others had to cover for them. This system made it beneficial for individuals to appear poor, as taxes took a significant part of their income. People hid their wealth and enjoyed luxuries in secret to avoid higher taxes. In a story, Jean Jacques Rousseau experienced this firsthand when a peasant initially offered him only skimmed milk and barley bread. But after realizing Rousseau was trustworthy, the peasant revealed hidden wheaten bread, ham, and wine. The peasant feared being exposed to tax collectors. It was common for villages to purposely seem impoverished to avoid increased taxes. This practice even troubled the Marquis of Argenson, who noted how villagers' well-being led to higher taxes, causing distress among the people.|"['1.

In the past, people in the countryside became wary of government officials. Necker recalled an incident where an official wanted to boost beekeeping but asked for hive statistics, leading to the destruction of hives due to suspicion. Tax payments were delayed out of fear of seeming wealthy. Peasants paid taxes slowly, even selling furniture to cover debts. During Louis XV's reign, entire villages faced consequences for unpaid taxes, but this changed under Turgot. The land tax had inconsistencies, with some provinces having better assessment methods. The Twentieths were income taxes, with the clergy exempt. Louis XVI's reign saw taxes of eleven percent, aiming to raise millions annually. An additional tax in 1782 aimed to fund the American Revolution. Exemptions reduced the revenue from this tax. Individual taxpayers were liable for the Twentieths, ensuring fair distribution of tax burdens.|"['1.

An effort was made to impose taxes on different types of earnings. The profits from farming bore the heaviest burden, while a portion was withheld from government salaries and retirements, and the earnings of public officials earning fees were approximated. Despite attempting to include all incomes in this tax, there was a widespread belief that valuations were often undervalued, leading to unfair treatment. Some regions were believed to be unfairly taxed, but attempts to correct this were met with resistance from the courts, arguing that income valuations for tax purposes couldn't be legally increased. This highlights the concern for the upper classes in tax payments compared to the indifference towards how common people were treated in collecting the Land Tax. The poll tax was essentially an income tax divided into twenty-two classes based on perceived financial capability, resulting in complex rules and disputes. The tax, along with additional charges, amounted to around thirty-six to forty-two million livres yearly.|"['1.

One of the most feared indirect taxes in history was the Salt Tax, also known as the Gabelle. Salt, being a necessity, was chosen by some governments as a good item to tax since everyone needed it. In certain regions of France, each household had to purchase seven pounds of salt annually for every family member over seven years old from government warehouses. Despite this tax, the French people learned to use salt sparingly. The revenue collected from this tax was significant, with a large portion taken from specific provinces. Smuggling salt became a common practice due to the vast difference in salt prices across regions, leading to severe penalties for those caught. Similarly, tobacco, although a popular stimulant, faced challenges with taxation and monopolies in France, affecting millions of consumers.|['1.

Taxes on wine and cider in 18th-century France were burdensome for both producers and consumers. Revenue officers would intrude into private homes, penalizing peasants who diluted their cider with water. Giving away wine was prohibited, making it difficult for vine-dressers to share their produce. Import and export duties were severe, leading to smuggling between France and England. A commercial treaty in 1786 improved trade relations, benefiting French wines and manufactured goods. However, the transition caused business confusion. Internal tolls and duties hindered commerce on roads and rivers, with complex local charges. Food taxes at city entrances favored wealthy burghers over the poor. In Paris, high gate fees led to expensive and poor-quality food.|['1.

During the French monarchy, the peasants faced various burdens like the taille, gabelle, and villein service (corvée). The corvée was a feudal obligation imposed on farmers and laborers to provide services for road-building and transporting soldiers' baggage. This duty, enforced by lords and state authorities, was arbitrary and often led to harsh treatment of the peasant workers and their draft-cattle. The burden was distributed among the peasants by political officers, sometimes accompanied by soldiers, making the process even more challenging. Despite attempts by officials like Turgot to abolish the corvée, it persisted until the end of the monarchy. The heavy taxation system under Louis XVI's government, as estimated by Necker, significantly impacted the French population's income, leaving them with little to survive on.|"['1.

In France, the practice of selling public offices dates back to the fourteenth century. Initially, Louis X sold judicial positions to the highest bidder, and over time, this expanded to include various minor roles sold by the government. This method of revenue generation persisted despite objections from the estates general and promises from kings. By the sixteenth century, offices became transferable and inheritable, akin to property. The revenue from these sales was likened to a loan or tax, with office-holders benefiting from salaries, fees, and privileges. However, the treasury's handling of this revenue was unfair, often creating and abolishing positions without compensating buyers. Despite the lack of faith in the system, people from all walks of life eagerly purchased these offices, leading to a complex and flawed practice.|"['1.

During the 18th century in France, a group of thinkers known as the Physiocrats emerged, led by Quesnay, who laid the foundation for modern political economy. Quesnay believed in natural laws governing society's most advantageous order, focusing on the importance of agriculture as the source of wealth. He advocated for the freedom of agriculture and commerce, emphasizing that agriculture yields a surplus, unlike manufacturing. Quesnay proposed that taxes should be directly based on land income, abolishing indirect taxation. He divided society into three classes based on productivity, ownership, and non-agricultural labor. Quesnay's ideas of liberty in agriculture and commerce influenced the modern school of individualism, promoting competition and property rights. The Physiocrats' belief in applying simple rules derived from natural laws to solve economic complexities shaped the principles of political economy in the 18th century.|"[""1.

The changes made were significant, causing concern for powerful groups. The Parliament of Paris stood up for established rights, rejecting the laws created to enforce the minister's changes. Despite the king's efforts to push through the laws, he grew weary of the conflict due to his indecisiveness. Turgot, though caring for the people, faced opposition from all sides and eventually resigned. The financial state of France was dire, not just due to debt but also from corruption in public services. Turgot proposed cuts to court expenses and pensions, which were often unjustified. However, King Louis XVI struggled to implement these changes fully due to his reluctance to upset those close to him. Ultimately, his inability to make tough decisions led to Turgot's dismissal, and his successor, a courtier, proved ineffective.|"[""1.

"During the reign of Louis XVI, the financial troubles of France worsened as subsequent controllers after Necker sank deeper into debt. The government's indecision and resistance to reform discouraged patriotic hopes and emboldened those benefiting from corruption. Louis XVI, though well-meaning, was unable to bring about change. The Enlightenment era saw a surge of new philosophical ideas challenging traditional beliefs. Philosophers like Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Locke, along with the ""Encyclopaedia,"" questioned established norms. Legal restrictions failed to stifle radical opinions, allowing new philosophies to flourish. The ""Encyclopaedia,"" inspired by Bacon and Chambers, aimed to organize human knowledge. Diderot, the driving force behind the project, expanded its scope. This intellectual revolution paved the way for thinkers like Rousseau to challenge the status quo."|"[""1.

This distinguished man, born in 1713 in Langres, was the son of an honorable cutler. He was taught by the Jesuits but declined a career in law or medicine, causing his father to cast him out. Diderot struggled in Paris, sometimes sleeping in a friend's room or his own garret. He briefly tutored a financier's children but preferred freedom, quitting the job. Over time, he rose above poverty to become a leading literary figure, known for his eloquence and generosity. Diderot enjoyed helping struggling writers, offering money and guidance. Despite being deceived by a young man, he remained gracious, even aiding the individual in turning a libelous manuscript into a gift for a prince.

"Diderot's main source is Nicholas Saunderson, a blind mathematician who taught at the University of Cambridge from 1711 to 1739. Diderot quotes Saunderson's atheistic beliefs, supposedly from a book by ""Dr. Inchlif,"" which was never real. Saunderson's views were actually Diderot's own. This deception damages Diderot's credibility. In one instance, Saunderson challenges the idea of God's existence based on nature's order. He questions whether life's complexity implies a creator. Saunderson suggests that at the beginning of time, many imperfect beings existed, but only those with functional designs survived. This notion hints at the survival of the fittest, a concept later linked to evolution. Diderot's ""Letter on the Blind"" led to his imprisonment, partly due to political reasons. Despite this, he continued his influential work on the groundbreaking ""Encyclopaedia"" with notable collaborators like D'Alembert, de Jaucourt, Voltaire, and others, shaping the Enlightenment era."|"[""1.

"The creation of the ""Encyclopaedia"" faced numerous challenges over several years. Starting in 1751, the first two volumes were met with opposition from the church and conservative French citizens. A royal decree in 1752 banned the reprinting and distribution of the volumes due to perceived threats to authority and religion. Despite this setback, the work continued. By 1757, seven volumes had been released, expanding the subscription list. However, in 1758, the publication faced renewed criticism following the release of Helvetius's controversial book ""De l'Esprit."" This led to the condemnation of both works by the Parliament of Paris. The ""Encyclopaedia"" was suspended pending further review and was eventually banned by the Council of State.

"Helvetius tried to extend the ideas of the French followers of Locke to their fullest extent, but it was Baron Holbach who truly achieved this.

Unlike Helvetius, Holbach was serious and sincere, as seen in his book ""System of Nature,"" which presents a profound argument from a genuine and clear perspective.

Differences among individuals, whether physical or moral, are what create the need for human society. If everyone were the same, there would be no need for cooperation. Inequality is not a flaw but a fortunate necessity that drives us to work together. When people come together, they implicitly agree to provide mutual aid and avoid harm. However, since individuals tend to prioritize their own desires over others, laws are established to guide their behavior. These laws reflect the collective will of society and aim to serve the common good. Governments, formed by the society, play a crucial role in ensuring the welfare of its citizens. A just government works for the benefit of the majority, and any rulers who harm society lose their authority. By upholding these principles, nations can avoid unhappiness and corruption in politics. The government's actions influence the physical and moral well-being of a nation, impacting everything from labor and health to customs and manners.

Men's wickedness and corruption stem from being governed contrary to their nature. They are not inherently bad but are molded as such. The powerful oppress the poor who seek to retaliate against the injustices they face. The poor revolt against a society that favors some over others. Authority over others should be based on the happiness one brings or promises. No one has a natural right to rule. The father's control over his family rests on the benefits he provides. Social hierarchies are rooted in actual or perceived usefulness. The wealthy have power over the poor due to the well-being they can offer. Virtue lies in making others happy.

Nature has created humans as neither inherently good nor bad, but rather as machines. Human virtue is only evident when driven by self-interest. Morality is rooted in our approval of actions that benefit the community. When good deeds benefit others and not just ourselves, our admiration mirrors that of appreciating a beautiful painting that belongs to someone else. A good person is one who understands that their happiness lies in a path of behavior that others are naturally inclined to like and endorse due to their own interests. Through virtue, we gain the goodwill of our neighbors, and true happiness cannot be achieved without it. Our self-love becomes far more fulfilling when combined with the love others have for us. It is essential to remember that the most unattainable goal is that of being happy in isolation.|"[""1.

Every person has a philosophy and a theology, a foundation for their beliefs and thoughts on the divine. Avoiding these leads to shallow opinions. Rousseau's theology will be discussed later. He leaned towards intuition, believing justice and virtue are innate, not taught. He sometimes thought people act out of self-interest, other times from a natural aversion to seeing others suffer. He separated from thinkers who saw pity as self-love. Rousseau advocated for a simple life, critiquing society's artificiality. He valued nature, a forerunner of 19th-century writers who cherished natural beauty. His genuine love for nature, from grass to mountains, inspired many to appreciate the world's natural wonders. His influence on simplicity and nature appreciation endures today.|"['1.

Jean Jacques Rousseau, born in Geneva in 1712, faced a challenging childhood. His mother passed away at his birth, and his father, a clockmaker, struggled to guide him. Rousseau moved between the care of a minister and his uncle before facing difficulties as an apprentice. His employer's harsh treatment led him to steal, ultimately fleeing his master. At sixteen, he left Geneva, embarking on a journey that led him to a Catholic priest and Madame de Warens, a woman who would play a significant role in his life. Madame de Warens, a complex figure, welcomed Rousseau and influenced his path, leading him to a brief stint in a monastery before returning to her care in Annecy.|"[""1.

The academy's question challenges civilization, but Rousseau's response marked a new era in thought. He believed true strength lies in laborers, not courtiers. In simpler times, manners were rustic yet genuine. Civilization, however, breeds corruption. Constantinople, a beacon of learning, was plagued by crime. Rousseau contrasts primitive societies untouched by vain knowledge, like the Persians and early Germans. He questions the value of arts and sciences rooted in vices. Rousseau's First Discourse explores these themes, reflecting his longing for a different world. His sensitivity contrasts sharply with Socrates' resilience. Rousseau's theories appeal to the disheartened, promoting unattainable ideals over practical progress. While some luxuries hinder progress, others drive labor. Nations with knowledge thrive, while those without lag behind. Rousseau's works speak to emotions rather than practical change, urging reflection on human nature and societal improvement.|"['1.

"Rousseau's First Discourse, though flawed in its teachings, does contain eloquent passages and sensible insights on education. He criticizes the education system of his time, where children are taught everything except their duties. He argues that they learn useless skills while neglecting virtues like courage and humanity. Rousseau believes that children should focus on practical knowledge that will serve them as adults. His ideas gained attention and controversy, leading to a distinguished place among intellectuals. In his Second Discourse, Rousseau explores the idea of the ""happy savage,"" a primitive man with simple desires and natural compassion. He contrasts this with the indifference of civilized society, where people ignore suffering and resort to arguments instead of action.

Love, according to Rousseau, has two aspects: physical and moral. The physical side involves a general desire leading to the union of sexes, while the moral side focuses on fixing that desire on one exclusive object. This moral aspect of love is a learned feeling influenced by societal norms, often used by women to establish power. In the absence of civilization, the savage man lacks abstract ideas of beauty and regularity, making him free from the imagination that troubles civilized individuals. Rousseau argued that in a state of nature, inequalities among savage men would be minimal, mostly caused by physical hardening or an effeminate life. Without societal relations, these inequalities would not trouble them significantly. In such a state, oppression, domination, and servitude would be foreign concepts as individuals would have little to gain from subjugating others.|['1.

In the second part of his essay, Rousseau discusses the development of human society. He argues that the first person who claimed ownership of land and convinced others to believe him was the true founder of civil society. This act led to crimes, wars, and inequality. Rousseau suggests that if someone had warned against this deception, humanity could have been spared from much suffering. However, as land became divided among a few, those without land were forced into slavery or theft, leading to civil unrest. Rousseau believed that the happiest stage of development was when humans lived in small communities, before the establishment of complex societies. He concludes that inequality and moral injustices arise from the evolution of human faculties and the establishment of property laws. Rousseau's ideas were met with criticism from Voltaire, who acknowledged the flaws in human society but doubted Rousseau's proposed solutions.|"['1.

"This passage discusses the reception of Rousseau into the literary community and his views on property rights. Rousseau's shift in beliefs is highlighted, particularly his assertion that property rights are more crucial than liberty itself. Despite his eccentricities and struggles with mental health, Rousseau continued to write passionately, aiming to enlighten society about their true interests. One of his most influential works, the ""Social Contract,"" outlines his ideas on the principles that should govern a legitimate government. Rousseau believed that any rule not based on these principles is unjust and lacks a true association among its citizens."|"[""1.

Rousseau emphasizes that the general will, which always aims for the public good, is not always reflected in the decisions of the people due to deception. He argues that the people are not corrupt but can be misled, especially by political parties. Rousseau believes that sovereignty, embodied in the general will, cannot be represented by deputies but only by direct participation of the people. He advocates for frequent popular assemblies where citizens directly engage in decision-making to uphold the general will. According to Rousseau, the social compact requires unanimity, and once formed, citizens must abide by the laws passed, even if they initially opposed them. He warns against the dangers of delegating power to representatives, stressing that the people should always retain the ability to revoke authority from their agents.|"['1.

Rousseau emphasized the significance of sovereignty over the form of government. He categorized democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy as suitable for small, middle-sized, and large states respectively. Rousseau believed that democracy, while challenging to manage, thrives in a small state where citizens know each other personally, promoting simplicity, equality, and little luxury. He favored aristocracy, a government of the wise and experienced, similar to the governance of early societies and American Indians. Rousseau criticized hereditary aristocracy as the worst form of government. He proposed elective government as a favorable option, emphasizing the importance of federation for smaller countries against foreign threats. Additionally, Rousseau highlighted the need for the separation of church and state to avoid conflicts and proposed a civil profession of faith with essential principles for societal harmony.|['1.

In his essay on the Social Compact, Rousseau presents dangerous ideas that have affected modern society. He believes the people are always powerful and righteous, never corrupt. He questions why the community should be better than its individuals and allows for the tyranny of the majority. Individuality is banished, and security is not guaranteed. Rousseau's system allows for capricious rule, where laws can change at any moment, leaving citizens no room for protest. The general will, once decided by popular vote, becomes the individual's will. Rousseau's concept of universal and inflexible laws is contrasted by his allowance for the state to be capricious. Rousseau also connects intolerance to religion, where those who doubt or deny religious beliefs are exiled. Despite these controversial ideas, Rousseau's influence through his writings on government, life, and education cannot be denied.|"['1.

"Not all the land is used for practical purposes. The main character has a special place called ""Elysium."" It's close to the house but separated by a thick hedge. This area is filled with native plants providing deep shade, grass like velvet underfoot, and flowers all around. Vines climb the trees, sometimes rooted in the trunks. A stream flows through, splitting into channels and reflecting the sky. Birds sing undisturbed. Nature thrives here, tended with care by the mistress. This garden is detailed in the ""New Heloisa,"" advocating for nature over artificiality. The eighteenth-century readers were inspired to imitate this natural setting.

However, the tutor's constant interference in Émile's life raises concerns about the effectiveness of the education system.

Here we find ourselves in a situation where a gardener is upset by the accidental destruction of his precious Maltese melons due to the planting of beans. The gardener expresses his disappointment, explaining how the melons were a treasure he had planned to share with the gentlemen. Despite the misunderstanding, the gentlemen apologize and promise to make amends by getting new seeds for the gardener. This incident highlights the importance of respecting others' work and property, as each person values their efforts and possessions.

"Émile's eagerness to learn is truly inspiring. He seeks understanding in every step he takes. A good teacher knows how to make their student enjoy the learning process. It's important to let Émile think and reflect on his own. He shouldn't be overwhelmed with too much reading. Starting with ""Robinson Crusoe"" as his primary book is a great idea. Alongside his studies, Émile will also learn a valuable trade, ensuring he always has work. Learning to draw is not just about art but also about training his eye and hand. Rousseau believed in the importance of clear thinking and physical health from various studies. As Émile grows, finding a suitable wife becomes necessary. Rousseau's approach to relationships between men and women was quite insightful. He believed in the coordination and mutual support between the sexes rather than competition. Sophie, his chosen partner, is depicted as a more attractive and true-to-nature character than Émile. The author's theories about girls, like Sophie, are as distinct and progressive as those about boys. Rousseau's ideas on girls' education align closely with modern customs, encouraging a balanced approach to social activities and responsibilities. Sophie's composed demeanor contrasts with Émile's emotional outbursts when they part ways for two years of travel to mature and gain control over their emotions. The separation scene is filled with Émile's dramatic expressions of sorrow, while Sophie remains calm and collected, highlighting the differences in their characters."|"['1.

Rousseau's theism differs greatly from Voltaire's. He is more of a prophet than a philosopher, speaking with authority above argument. He believes in innate ideas like love of self, fear of pain, and conscience. He advocates for a just heart as the true temple of Divinity and emphasizes moral duties over religious institutions. He warns against those who spread desolating doctrines under the guise of explaining nature. Rousseau's influence stemmed from his consideration of human nature in its entirety, unlike the rationalism of his contemporaries. The era of Louis XVI saw significant social and legal changes, with the rise of the middle class and the influence of philosophers like Voltaire and Rousseau. The teachings of these philosophers shaped the beliefs of society, leading to differing ideologies among the people.|"['1.

During the reign of the final absolute king of France, there was a sense of optimism and faith in the improvement of humanity. Various reformers proposed ideas for societal change. Economists believed in the benefits of free trade and tax reform, though their methods were unclear. Army reformers aimed to instill Prussian discipline, struggling to balance discipline with compassion. Calls for Equality and enlightened governance were made, despite their conflicting nature. Philanthropists, genuinely seeking change, worked in hospitals and prisons, alleviating suffering in France. These shifts in mindset led to action, such as the reforms by Turgot, Necker, and the Notables, including the abolition of the _corvée_ and judicial torture. Public opinion emerged as a significant influence, guiding decisions and shaping societal norms.|"['1.

"Human nature often surpasses its own expectations, as seen in the higher moral standards of individuals like Quesnay and the magistrates compared to the general populace. Each group shapes its own public opinion, seeking validation from those they respect. The thinkers of the eighteenth century, while valuing public opinion, were also willing to defy it if necessary. However, the French faced consequences for blindly worshiping public opinion, allowing the unruly mob to dictate decisions. The Parisian populace, always seeking entertainment and quick-witted, influenced the political climate. The satirical play ""The Marriage of Figaro"" by Beaumarchais, though politically significant, shines for its witty dialogue and memorable characters like Cherubin and Figaro.

"In the play ""The Marriage of Figaro,"" Beaumarchais uses the character Figaro to criticize the nobility, court, and government of France. Figaro, a clever man from the middle class, mocks the aristocrats for their inherited wealth and undeserved privileges. He satirizes the absurdity of the social hierarchy, where birth determines success rather than merit. Figaro's witty remarks challenge the restrictions on freedom of speech and the censorship imposed by the authorities. Despite facing opposition from the king, who found the play disrespectful, Beaumarchais managed to stage the play at the prestigious Comédie Française in 1781. The success of the play and the uproar it caused among the nobles and the court highlighted the power of satire and the importance of freedom of expression in society."|"['1.

"As the Estates General meeting approached, political reading became crucial in late 1788 and early 1789 in Paris. A flood of pamphlets flooded the city, surpassing any other time. Despite limited newspapers controlled by the government, French citizens were brimming with ideas. Efforts to curb the press were futile as everyone, from royalty to obscure writers, rushed to publish. Bookstores were packed, printing costs doubled, and one collector amassed 2500 pamphlets. The main focus was the representation in the Estates General, with debates on a single chamber versus three chambers. Pamphlets covered law reform, feudal issues, and various topics with intriguing titles like ""Detached Thoughts"" and ""The Forty Wishes of the Nation."" Despite police restrictions, pamphlets were bold, even criticizing the king personally and politically."|"['1.

During the late 18th century in France, there was a significant debate between writers who challenged the existing system and defenders of traditional institutions. While some sought peace and harmony, the reality was that France operated as a despotism with deep-rooted customs. The people desired a more liberal government, although opinions on its exact form varied. Despite the political turmoil, no strong leader emerged to unify the factions and maintain order. One influential figure, Abbé Sieyes, questioned the role of the Third Estate, arguing that they did the majority of the work across various sectors. He believed that removing the privileged classes would strengthen the nation. Sieyes emphasized that the Third Estate encompassed all essential aspects of the nation, highlighting the disparities in privileges and rights among different social classes.|"['1.

What does the Third Estate demand? It seeks representation in the Estates General that truly reflects its wishes and defends its interests. The people ask for fair representation from their own order to have a say in the government. To achieve this, the Third Estate must have equal influence as the privileged classes and at least half the representatives. Voting should be by heads to ensure equality. Sieyes argues that the Third Estate should choose representatives only from within its own ranks, emphasizing that individuals from one order cannot truly represent another. He criticizes the Provincial Assemblies and the Assembly of Notables, dismissing them as ineffective due to their composition of privileged individuals. Sieyes advocates for a government based on the Social Compact, where representatives are delegated to exercise common power, with the constitution guiding their actions.|"['1.

In the past, society was divided into three main groups: the Clergy, the Nobility, and the Commons, also known as the Third Estate. Each group was to conduct their elections separately in every region, unless they agreed to merge through individual votes. They were expected to create petitions, complaints, and remonstrances to guide legislation. These documents, known as Cahiers, outlined the desires of each group. The Clergy's Cahiers were often influenced by parish priests who outnumbered other ecclesiastics. The Nobility's Cahiers reflected the views of the poorer nobility, who wanted equal rights and opportunities. Local assemblies were summoned for both groups, with parish priests and Frenchmen over 25 years attending for the Clergy and Nobility, respectively. The meetings aimed to address societal concerns and shape future laws.|"['1.

A complex system was established for the Third Estate during the French Revolution. All French subjects, excluding clergy and nobility, who were 25 years old and listed on tax rolls, were granted the right to vote. Each town, parish, or village created a list of grievances called a cahier, which was sent by representatives to district or intermediate assemblies. These cahiers were then consolidated and refined before being presented to the Estates General in Versailles. The cahiers of the Third Estate varied widely, with some focusing on local issues like broken infrastructure and lack of justice, while others addressed broader concerns such as financial disorder and the need for peace. The cahiers from rural areas often highlighted feudal problems, while urban cahiers emphasized political and social reforms. Some cahiers were extensive and detailed, covering legislative proposals and specific requests for legal reviews. Additionally, models of cahiers were distributed from Paris to influence elections in various regions, showcasing different agendas and tactics to sway voters.|['1.

During the French Revolution, the people of Essy-les-Nancy in Lorraine created their cahiers, or lists of grievances and suggestions, for the district assembly. They selected deputies to represent them, including Imbert Perrin and Joseph Jacques. The priest, who understood their concerns well, was asked to draft the final report. Despite delays in the assembly meeting, the priest helped refine the cahier. In other districts, there were protests against proposed changes. Some wanted noble privileges restricted, while others objected to increased taxes. Peasants felt their voices were suppressed by lawyers and urban deputies. In Nemours, economist Dupont faced a hostile crowd but cleverly defused the situation by using a fat man as a shield, gaining support for his ideas.

During the French Revolution in 1789, the Estates General were granted the exclusive right to make laws, maintaining France as a centralized monarchy. Provincial Estates were to be set up nationwide, with significant administrative powers. These Provincial Estates would handle tasks like tax assessment, road construction, licensing, and promoting trade and industry. Many proposals from the cahiers, or notebooks of grievances, suggested that offices and titles should only be given with the approval of the Provincial Estates. Some cahiers also called for elected local authorities and the removal of old government officials who were seen as oppressive tax collectors. The focus on political reforms was just as important as social and economic changes, with all groups emphasizing the need for a new constitution before addressing issues like national debt and taxes.|['1.

When moving from the possessions of individuals to those of religious groups like churches, the call for change becomes even more pronounced. Parish priests, feeling unjustly treated regarding church property distribution, sought radical reforms. They proposed increasing salaries for clergy working in parishes by taking from the wealthier clergy members. The aim was to provide more fairly for those who actively served in communities. While some wanted to eliminate compulsory fees for religious ceremonies, most agreed that a reasonable tithe was acceptable. The general consensus among the people was that all citizens should share the tax burden equally. This desire for fair taxation was a key aspect of the Estates General discussions, emphasizing the need for financial reforms to benefit all citizens.|['1.

Attacks on luxury have been criticized throughout history, but proposals for progressive taxation have gained more attention. The Third Estate of Rennes, known for its revolutionary ideas, suggests a tax system where the wealthy pay more based on their income. Bellocq proposes a tax on those who have profited quickly from the nation's resources, followed by a tax on those with high incomes and toll collectors. If needed, luxury items could be seized for additional funds. The financial plan in the cahiers involves examining government expenses and making necessary cuts, especially in extravagant pensions. A strict process for approving expenditures and addressing the state's debts is outlined. The clergy, nobility, and Third Estate generally agree on governance, but differ in emphasis on religious and moral issues.|"[""1. What is the main focus of the proposals mentioned in the text?\nA.

In France, the Roman Catholic and Apostolic Religion is the state's official religion, and no other public worship is permitted. The clergy strongly supported this, while other orders generally agreed. They believe that granting civil rights to non-Catholics has already gone too far and should be limited. Some nobility suggest honoring Protestant officers, but not allowing them to be elected. In certain areas, there are calls for the property of exiled religious individuals to be returned to their families. Some Parisians advocate for the freedom of worship for all religions. Although there are expressions of support for recent concessions to Protestants, the country remains predominantly Catholic. The clergy also wants stricter observance of Sundays and holidays, while the Third Estate in some regions believes there are too many holidays and suggests transferring their religious significance to the nearest Sunday.|"['1.

When it comes to the freedom of the press, there is disagreement among different groups in society. The clergy believes in stricter censorship to control immoral content, while the nobility and the Third Estate lean towards allowing freedom for the press but with accountability from authors and printers, suggesting that publications should be signed to prevent anonymous harmful writings. The clergy emphasizes the importance of education and wishes to have control over it. They also demand reforms within their own order, advocating against absenteeism of bishops and abbots, pluralities, and promoting the clergy based on merit. The laity supports these reforms and even suggests the suppression and consolidation of monasteries in some cases.|"[""1.

In the spring of 1789, the French nation united in seeking to regulate the practice of quack doctors and forbid lotteries, showing a desire for protection against fraudulent practices. The people requested legislation to safeguard themselves, emphasizing the importance of competent healthcare providers. They aimed for a government with shared power between the nation and the king, maintaining a limited monarchy. While advocating for a reduction in the privileges of the upper classes, the French populace intended to preserve the role of the clergy in religious matters. Additionally, there was a collective push for fairer distribution of public burdens and benefits, striving for more equitable taxation and opportunities for social advancement. The populace also sought to curb the influence of corrupt courtiers and implement reforms in various sectors like the judiciary, military, and finances.|"['1.

What were the dangers facing France at that time? The risks lay in the significant changes proposed, which would startle and alarm all of Europe. They were evident in the resistance of the nobles, who were hesitant to give up more than they already had. The biggest fear was having a weak monarch and a flawed administration that could be destroyed by the first reform attempt. France had shifted from anarchy to despotism, seeking security from external threats and good governance internally. While the country was respected and feared externally, internally, the government struggled to keep up with the advancing civilization. The focus on external affairs was common in despotisms, where protecting and expanding the country is a priority. Improving internal governance is a challenging task, often leading to mistakes and displeasure. Courtiers, who surrounded kings, were more interested in maintaining abuses. The lack of information and will to govern effectively led to discontent among the people. France would have been different in 1789 if the kings had been stronger and more capable.|"['1.

The French government was not aristocratic. The nobility held significant administrative positions, including secretaries of state, judges, and army officers. While the nobility was perceived to have political rights, these were mostly outdated. To ensure stability, a government should represent the true forces of the state. In a homogeneous country with property and education widely distributed, numerical strength should influence governance. Democracy relies on the agreement that decisions by a majority are binding for all, fostering peace and unity. However, in old France, the conditions for democratic governance were only partially met. The populace lacked political experience necessary for a successful democratic compromise. The concept of majority rule with its limitations was not clearly defined. A government should reflect a nation's moral duty, striving for improvement and fairness through just laws that align with societal ideals.|"[""1.

In 1789, the French valued qualities like patriotism, loyalty, liberty, equality, and humanity. Patriotism, a deep love for France, was widely embraced. Loyalty to the king was also important, with many believing in his good intentions despite being misled by courtiers. Liberty, though mainly political power, and equality of rights were ideals, but not everyone sought complete equality. The rise of humanity, a concern for others' suffering, showed a shift towards improving the world. Faith in progress and happiness on Earth led to charity and better care for the sick and oppressed. The government lagged behind public goodwill in these efforts, reflecting the people's desires for a more just and compassionate society.|"['1.

In old France, the government and people had different virtues in mind. While the government valued loyalty and a centralized despotism, the people sought liberty and equality. The country wanted a reformed Catholicism with provincial councils and resident bishops. The monarchy didn't always align with the moral values of the nation. For a government to succeed, it must correspond with the national conscience. The government needs experts in various fields to carry out its policies effectively. King Louis XVI's administration had its strengths and weaknesses. The people of France were better than their government, with improvements in education, honesty, and industry. Material progress had made life better for both the poor and the rich. France saw advancements in wealth, education, and living standards over time.|['1.

France in 1789 was facing challenges in governance compared to other European countries before the Revolution. While Prussia under King Frederick was better administered, smaller states like Holland had more efficient governance. Despite some tyrannical lords, France provided better safety for life and property. French intellectual leadership was evident across Europe, with renowned figures like Voltaire and Rousseau. The French discontent stemmed from the realization that their government did not match their level of civilization. The deficit in finances became a focal point for criticism, leading to calls for reform. The lack of experience in popular assemblies posed a challenge during the Estates General, where delegates lacked the necessary expertise. The French Revolution was not just a response to financial issues but also a call for comprehensive reform in governance.|['1.

A governing body, though not as smart as its best members, has an advantage over an individual. It can deliberate slowly due to its own rules. This means that impulsive decisions today can be reconsidered with a cooler head tomorrow. For major changes like constitutional amendments, a careful approach is needed. Changes should be made one at a time, debated thoroughly, and elections should be held throughout the process. The French assembly during the revolution lacked the time and caution needed for such significant changes. They were sincere but lacked experience, calmness, and patience.
