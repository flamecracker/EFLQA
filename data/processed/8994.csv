"We argued often but made up quickly, cried but laughed too. We had our small troubles, bumps, and bruises, but Mother always kissed and made them better. One day, I sat in the meadows by a brook on a hot day. The sky was blue with white clouds drifting like swans. Across from me, stood green rushes with a single tall red cardinal flower leaning over the brook. The scene was so delightful that I sat there for a long time. Suddenly, I heard two small voices close by. They were having a dispute, repeating, ""Katy did"" and ""Katy didn't."" I found two tiny pale-green creatures with black goggles on a bulrush.

Katy Carr lived in the growing town of Burnet in a white house with green blinds. The house had a porch covered in roses and clematis, and locust trees shaded the path to the front gate. Behind the house was an orchard, wood piles, barns, and an ice-house. Katy's father, Dr. Carr, was a kind and busy man who cared for sick people. Aunt Izzie, Papa's sister, looked after Katy and her siblings since their mother had passed away. Aunt Izzie found the children puzzling as they were not like her when she was young. She preferred them to be neat and quiet, unlike Katy, Clover, and Elsie who were more adventurous and playful.

I want to introduce you to the Carr family. One day, five out of the six Carr children were perched on the ice-house, a favorite play spot for them. The ice-house was a low roof over a hole in the ground in the side-yard. The children loved climbing up and sliding down the slopes. Clover, the second oldest after Katy, sat in the middle. She was a cheerful girl with pigtails of light brown hair and blue eyes. Next to her was Phil, a pretty little boy. Then came Elsie, a thin, brown child who often felt left out among her siblings. Elsie longed to be included in her older siblings' games and secrets, but they often excluded her. Despite this, Elsie was observant and clever, always finding their hidden post-offices. Katy, the oldest, was unaware of Elsie's loneliness and missed the chance to comfort her.|"['1. What was the ice-house described as in the text?\nA. A tall building\nB.

Dorry and Joanna sat at opposite ends of the ridge-pole. Dorry, a six-year-old boy, had a serious face and molasses stains on his jacket. Joanna, known as Johnnie, was a cheerful child with big eyes and a ready smile. Despite their differences, they were close friends. When Katy appeared at the window holding a pile of stockings, the children rejoiced. They quickly gathered their belongings as Katy announced they could go. Clover fetched baskets, Elsie grabbed her kitten, and Dorry and John carried green boughs. Cecy, another friend from next door, joined them. She was neat and prim, unlike Katy, who was tall, careless, and always tangled. Despite her height, Katy was loving but often forgot her good intentions.

"The children were off to a marshy thicket at the field's bottom near their house. The thicket seemed vast because of its dense trees and bushes. In winter, it was soggy, only cows ventured there. But in summer, it turned lush with wild roses, sassafras, and bird nests. They called it ""Paradise,"" a place full of adventure. The entrance was through wooden bars. Katy and Cecy hopped over while the younger ones crawled underneath. Once past the bars, they raced into the field and halted at the wood's entrance. It was always thrilling to visit Paradise after winter. Katy led the way, suggesting they explore Pilgrim's Path first. As they journeyed, they passed by Rosary, a tall stump with a rose bush that the children believed was protected by fairies. The Path of Peace was a shady, cool trail where they picked white flowers called Pollypods. They spent the morning exploring Toadstool Avenue, Rabbit Hollow, and more until the sun reached its peak at noon."|"[""1.

"""Dorry, don't be hungry until the bower is ready!"" exclaimed the girls, worried about Dorry's impatience for meals. They quickly constructed the bower using boughs and skipping-ropes tied to a poplar-tree, where a fairy that recommended sassafras tea lived. Once completed, they all gathered inside with the kitten. The bower was cozy, just big enough for them and the baskets. Katy opened the largest basket filled with ginger cakes, buttered biscuits, slices of cold lamb, hard-boiled eggs, and sandwiches. The delicious food was enjoyed in the bower, with the wind rustling the leaves and birds singing. The second basket revealed molasses pies, bringing immense joy to the group. Cecy and Clover shared their dreams of the future, imagining lives filled with beauty and luxury."|['1.

Dorry envisioned having turkey and delicious baked pudding every day. Clover, the peacemaker, calmed Dorry down, promising no more laughter.

Mrs. Knight's school, where Katy, Clover, and Cecy attended, was located at the far end of the town, opposite Dr. Carr's. It was a single-story building with a yard where the girls played during breaks. Unfortunately, next to it was Miss Miller's equally popular school, separated only by a high board fence. Mrs. Knight was a kind, slow-moving woman, resembling a gentle cow. In contrast, Miss Miller was brisk with black eyes and curls. A feud between the schools arose over the teachers and education quality. The Knight girls considered themselves refined, while the Miller girls were seen as vulgar. They taunted each other through the fence during recess. One morning, Katy struggled to find her belongings, causing Aunt Izzie to scold her.

Katy, in a daring move, freed herself from her assailant's grasp with a powerful kick.

Miss Izzie, noticing Katy's distress, reluctantly agreed to her request to invite a friend over. However, she warned Katy not to repeat this without permission, as her father, who was very particular about her friends, would not be pleased. Katy had a habit of becoming overly attached to new people, leading to trouble. When Katy was young, she befriended Marianne O'Riley, a girl from the neighborhood, and planned to hide her in the attic.

It was Mrs. Spenser, lying in a messy room, sick and lonely. Despite the unkempt house, Katy visited Mrs. Spenser daily, offering comfort by brushing her hair and sharing stories.

One by one, the other children left Katy and Clover to entertain their guest, Imogen. They tried playing with dolls and suggesting a poetry game, but Imogen didn't like dolls and couldn't remember any verses. So, they all ended up in the orchard, where Imogen enjoyed eating plums and apples. However, after the fruit was gone, boredom set in. Katy, unsure of what to do, eventually led them to the parlor, a room rarely used and kept dark and tidy by Aunt Izzie. Despite feeling uneasy, Katy wanted to be polite and not have Imogen think poorly of her.

None of them had ever met her. Philly was convinced she had no legs because she never left home, always resting on a sofa. But others knew it was due to Cousin Helen's illness. Papa visited her twice a year, sharing stories about her sweetness and patience. The children, especially Katy and Clover, had imagined her for so long that they were both nervous and excited to finally meet her. The anticipation grew until the next afternoon when Cousin Helen was due to arrive. Aunt Izzie, in a flurry, gave the children strict instructions on how to behave. They were to be on their best behavior. When Cousin Helen finally arrived, she was accompanied by her nurse and carried by Papa. Her appearance surprised the children, as she was nothing like they had imagined. Despite the initial disappointment, Katy found herself drawn to Cousin Helen's cheerful and lively demeanor.|"['1.

At the tea-table, Katy eagerly offered to take the tray from Aunt Izzie, who was preparing Cousin Helen's delightful supper of cold chicken, raspberries with cream, and tea in a lovely pink-and-white cup. Aunt Izzie placed a snow-white napkin over the tray, and Katy proudly carried it across the hall, passing a table with a bowl of flowers. Inspired, she added a rose to the tray, creating a charming display. Unfortunately, as Katy hurried upstairs, she tripped on her boot-lace, causing a commotion that ended with the tray, cream, raspberries, and rose spilling onto the carpet in Cousin Helen's room. Despite the mishap, Cousin Helen was incredibly kind and understanding, comforting Katy and even requesting her to bring up another tray with a rose.

The children woke up early the next morning, thrilled that it was finally vacation time. They eagerly awaited Cousin Helen, who was still asleep. Aunt Izzie had to shoo them away from her door as they kept checking on her. Katy, impatient but excited, picked some beautiful flowers from the garden to give to Cousin Helen. When they were finally allowed in, they found Cousin Helen looking lovely in a fresh blue outfit. The room was adorned with pretty things, making it look different from Aunt Izzie's usual neat but plain rooms. Cousin Helen explained why she brought a special vase with her. She shared that even though pretty things aren't worldly, they can make a sick person feel more comfortable. The children, including John and Dorry, Clover, and Elsie, had a delightful morning playing games and listening to Cousin Helen's stories.

Katy was upset when a mishap with the swing-glass ruined Cousin Helen's gift of blush-roses. Her aunt scolded her for being careless, but Katy felt misunderstood. The real issue was that the swing was broken and unsafe, but Aunt Izzie didn't explain. Instead, she ordered Katy to fix her messy drawer and stay out of the sun. Feeling hot and tired, Katy grudgingly followed orders, dragging her feet and feeling unappreciated. Despite her frustration, Katy wished for more understanding and kindness from her aunt.|"[""1.

Miss Izzie was correct about the messy bureau-drawer. It was a chaotic mix of items like books, paint-boxes, scribbled papers, lead pencils, and brushes. Stocking-legs tangled with pocket-handkerchiefs and ribbons, while ruffles peeked out from under the mess. Little paper boxes lay empty, their treasures lost beneath the jumble. Katy worked hard to tidy up, knowing Aunt Izzie would inspect it later. Exhausted, she met Elsie, who hid a secret letter to Cousin Helen on her slate. A scuffle ensued, causing Elsie to fall. Aunt Izzie scolded Katy for her behavior, comforting Elsie and tending to her injuries.|"['1.

Katy felt a mix of emotions as she sat in the swing in the wood-shed. She was upset about hurting Elsie but was too proud to admit it after Aunt Izzie's remarks.

Aunt Izzie is a person, and just like her, the children are unique individuals too. People are not all the same like red flower-pots. We need to understand others by feeling and guessing before we can truly connect with them. It's fascinating and helpful to learn how to approach and help others. There's a lesson in being hopeful, like the Sun teaching us to look forward to each day. Even in sickness, we can choose to make our surroundings beautiful and pleasant. Just like a young girl who faced an accident and had to adapt to a new way of life, we all have challenges to overcome.

Katy had a wish for a book like one Aunt Izzie and Cousin Helen enjoyed. She had spent all her money, but the absence of the children and their mysterious activities occupied her mind. After supper, the children returned, cheerful and ready for a holiday tradition. They wrote their wishes on paper bits, hoping they would fly up the chimney as a sign that Santa Claus had received them. Clover cleverly ensured her wish flew up by creating a draft. The children hung their stockings, and in the morning, they found surprises from Santa Claus, including a lovely evergreen tree with fruits, nuts, and gifts. Elsie was thrilled to find a desk with a note from Katy. The room sparkled with joy and festive decorations.|"['1.

Aunt Izzie's precise routines were so well-known to the servants that the house practically ran itself. After breakfast, Debby would come for instructions, but Katy, initially enjoying the novelty, soon found ordering meals tiresome. Faced with the same dishes, she sought new recipes but struggled to invent variety. Poor Debby endured Katy's experiments, trying odd recipes from books until the family revolted. Katy then fixated on healthy eating, pushing plain food until her family rebelled. Finally, in spring, she became overly anxious, checking on cooking and children's attire excessively.

Elsie was determined to follow Katy's advice of not sitting for more than half an hour at a time without taking a break. She decided to walk briskly to the gate and back twice to rest. On her way, she noticed Bridget flapping things out of Papa's room window. Elsie found out that the girls were both cleaning the dining room and taking up the carpets while Papa was away. They were having a simple meal of bread, butter, milk, and cold ham in Katy's room to save Papa from the fuss.

Katy called Clovy over, worried that Bridget might disturb Papa's table. She asked Clovy to remind Bridget not to touch anything. After the carpet is laid, Katy requested Clovy to dust the table to ensure everything is back in place. Elsie mentioned her nearly finished mats and asked to crochet near Papa's washstand. Just then, Dorry, a tall lad with a sensible face and a clock, entered. Dorry checked the time, suggesting he should stay to hear the clock strike to ensure it's correct. Katy appreciated Dorry's help and asked him to place a drawer in Papa's room. Dorry examined the clock, trying to stop it after 130 strikes, leaving everyone amused. Katy suggested Dorry discuss the clock with Wetherell's for the best solution.|"[""1.

"""Oh, Katy!"" she exclaimed, ""could you ask Philly not to wash the chickens in the rainwater tub? He's already washed all of Speckle's and is starting on Dame Durden's.

Imogen chatted away while Elsie admired Katy's dress. Imogen's attire was flashy with flounces and jewelry that jingled. She even had curls stuck to her cheeks. Imogen mentioned receiving lovely letters from someone special. She searched her pocket and found a letter, making Clover suspicious. Reading aloud from the letter, Imogen shared details of a lonely Christmas dinner. Katy, trying not to laugh, changed the subject quickly. Meanwhile, Mrs. Worrett, an old friend of Aunt Izzie's, was coming for lunch. Katy, unprepared, asked Bridget to inform Mrs. Worrett of the dining room's state and offer her a fan.

Katy listened to Papa's advice and took cautious steps, feeling the excitement of her newfound mobility. Her progress was slow, just as Dr. Carr had foreseen.

Clover, Katy's cousin, seemed to be hiding a secret that brought her immense joy.

Elsie and Johnnie entered, dressed in their finest clothes, as was Clover. It was clearly a special day for everyone in the house. Cecy joined them, specially invited to witness Katy descending the stairs. Even she wore a new dress. Papa made his appearance. Slowly, they descended the stairs, Katy leaning on Papa, Dorry by her side, and the girls following, with Philly leading the way. Debby, Bridget, and Alexander peeked from the kitchen door, while Mary cried tears of joy. As they proceeded, Papa opened the parlor door. Katy took a step inside, then paused. Her face flushed, and she grasped the doorknob for support. What did she see? Not just the room itself, but also Cousin Helen lying on the sofa, her arms outstretched towards Katy.
