Once upon a time on Christmas Day morning, the tailor faced a dilemma. The Mayor of Gloucester needed a cherry-colored coat for his wedding by noon, but the tailor had only enough strength and time to sew one buttonhole. However, to his surprise, on the table lay a beautifully embroidered coat and satin waistcoat for the Mayor. Meanwhile, in another tale, Nutkin and his squirrel friends brought gifts to Old Brown, including fat beetles and sweet wild honey. Old Brown tried to catch Nutkin, but the clever squirrel escaped by breaking his tail. Benjamin Bunny, on the other hand, went to visit his relatives in the woods behind Mr. McGregor's garden.

Peter and Little Benjamin went to Mr. McGregor's garden, where they found Peter's coat and shoes on a scarecrow. Benjamin led the way to the other end of the garden, walking along a plank walk under a red brick wall. Old Mr. Bunny didn't like cats and jumped on top of one, kicking it away. When Peter returned home, his mother forgave him for losing his coat and shoes. Mrs. Rabbit and the bunnies hung onions and herbs in the kitchen. Meanwhile, Lucinda and Jane went for a drive, leaving the nursery quiet. Hunca Munca found beads instead of food in canisters. Lucie climbed a hill and discovered a small kitchen where Mrs. Tiggy-winkle ironed clothes.|"[""1.

"Lucie quickly climbed the stile with her bundle, wanting to thank the washer-woman, Mrs. Tiggy-winkle.

Duchess opened the top oven door and found a delicious veal and ham pie with a tin patty-pan peeking through the crust. She realized she might have been eating a mouse instead! Feeling ill, she decided to hide the pie in the back-yard to avoid explaining to Ribby. After Ribby and the doctor left, Duchess put the pie outside and pretended to be asleep. Later, she sneaked back to see Ribby's reaction. Ribby was surprised to find the patty-pan in the yard, realizing it wasn't hers.

Once upon a time, Mr. Jeremy, a fisherman, sat by the water with his red float, grass rod, and horse-hair line.

Benjamin Bunny emerged from a dark tunnel, brushing off sand and cleaning his face. The sun's warmth grew as he reached the hilltop. In the valley, mist covered the trees.

Mr. Tod's curtains were neatly folded and stored away as the house was empty. Tommy Brock, covered only with a blanket, was fast asleep. Mr. Tod, standing on a wobbly chair, observed him closely. He attempted to lift a heavy pail of water to hang it over Tommy Brock for a shower, but struggled due to his thin legs. After much effort, he emptied the water into a basin and jug, then slung the pail over Tommy Brock's head. Tommy Brock, pretending to sleep, quickly replaced himself with Mr. Tod's dressing-gown under the pail. When Mr. Tod returned, he gnawed a tight knot to free himself, only to find a wet mess on the bed. Determined to clean up, Mr. Tod planned to disinfect the room thoroughly.

Flopsy and old Mr. Bouncer argued during supper, leading to a restless night and more quarrels at breakfast. Mr. Bouncer admitted inviting company into the rabbit hole but stayed silent to Flopsy's questions. The day dragged on with Mr. Bouncer sulking in a corner barricaded with a chair.

Aunt Pettitoes sighed as she spoke to her little pigs, deciding that some of them must go to the market. Pigling Bland and Alexander were chosen for the trip. Aunt Pettitoes reminded them to mind their Sunday clothes, blow their noses, and walk on hind legs. She warned them about traps, hen roosts, and to always be cautious. Aunt Pettitoes handed them licenses and peppermints with moral sentiments. Pigling Bland listened carefully, but Alexander was easily distracted. As they started their journey, Alexander's mischievous behavior caused trouble. He teased Pigling Bland and mixed up their papers.

The policeman questioned the two young boys, Pigling Bland and Alexander, about stealing a pig and asked for their licenses. Pigling Bland showed his paper, but Alexander handed over a crumpled one. The policeman allowed Pigling Bland to walk with him since his paper was in order. Pigling Bland, hesitant to go alone, asked if he could come back too, but the policeman insisted he could not. As Alexander was taken away by the policeman, Pigling Bland felt uneasy about being alone and the rain starting. He realized he had both his paper and Alexander's. In a rush to catch up, Pigling Bland was startled by the scolding of the cockerel and the clucking of the hen. Feeling alarmed, Pigling Bland decided to leave at daybreak. Later, he fell asleep with the hens as he planned his escape.|"['1.

Pigling Bland found himself in a strange situation as he was taken down a hill with a heavy hamper containing fowls and a young pig. Despite being scratched, Pigling managed to hide papers and peppermints in his clothes. Mr. Piperson, the man in charge, checked Pigling's pockets and then prepared porridge. Pigling, feeling hungry, paid no mind to the strange noises in the kitchen. The next morning, Mr. Piperson hinted at Pigling leaving soon. Before Pigling could respond, a neighbor arrived, prompting Mr. Piperson to rush out with the hamper. Pigling was left alone in the cottage, where he cleaned up and sang while working. Mr. Piperson, surprisingly affable, made plenty of porridge and forgot to lock the meal chest. Pigling, feeling puzzled by the situation, asked Pig-wig why they didn't run away.|"['1.

Pigling Bland and Pig-wig were on their way to the market. Pigling, feeling confused, mentioned that he had two pig papers and suggested going to the bridge, to which Pig-wig eagerly agreed and asked many questions. As they walked hand in hand, Pigling noticed the three little piggies they left behind were not doing well. The sun rose, casting a beautiful light over the hills and valleys of Westmorland. Pig-wig, in high spirits, started singing and dancing, while Pigling, feeling a toothache, grumpily declined a peppermint. They encountered a man ploughing and hurried towards the county boundary, with Pigling cautioning Pig-wig to keep quiet and ready to run. Despite Pigling's discomfort, they continued their journey towards the bridge.|"['1.
