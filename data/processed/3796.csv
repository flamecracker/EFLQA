Doc, the handsome cat, had a regal presence on the veranda, resembling an Egyptian sphinx. However, when a storm approached, his demeanor changed drastically. His eyes transformed, gleaming with an eerie light, and his fur darkened. This shift brought a sense of fear to those around him, except for Rilla, who defended his prowling nature. Dr. Jekyll enjoyed milk, while Mr. Hyde growled at it. Mr. Hyde's heavy footsteps scared Susan, who felt his menacing gaze for hours. Susan, in awe of Mr. Hyde, never interfered with his eerie behavior, unlike with Dr. Jekyll. The return of Faith, Gerald, and James from Redmond College delighted their friends, with Susan relishing their names. Miss Cornelia admired Faith's beauty and noted the mischief the children used to cause, now softened by Rosemary's influence. Norman Douglas humorously claimed Bruce was meant for him and Ellen, not the manse.|"['1.

The heroic doctor lost both his legs in the field, yet he selflessly tended to wounded men until his last breath. His final act of tying a bandage on another man's leg saved a life. This selfless sacrifice embodies the best of human nature, a godlike action that inspires awe. The beauty of such stories reminds us of the power of selflessness. Despite the warmth of the evening, a shiver runs through one of the characters, perhaps due to an old superstition about someone walking over their future grave. Yet, the charm of living in the countryside brings solace, especially on beautiful nights like this. The youth and dreamlike quality of the night evoke both fear and admiration. The conversation shifts to Kenneth, a young man recovering from a football injury, who is the subject of Ethel Reese's infatuation.|"[""1.

Rilla despised Ethel, who had always hated her since a past incident. Rilla was determined not to be overlooked because she was a country girl. The evening was filled with boats racing and laughter, with lanterns lighting the way. Rilla quickly changed into silver slippers and joined the dancing. The music was enchanting, the sea breeze refreshing, and the moonlight magical. Rilla felt like she had wings on her feet and her soul. The evening seemed like a triumph until Ethel pointed out a stain on her dress, but Irene's compliments made Rilla feel special.

"Rilla felt her heart skip a beat when she saw Kenneth approaching her at the pavilion. She had thought he wouldn't come, but there he was. She wondered if he would notice her, although she knew he wouldn't ask her to dance. Kenneth was tall, good-looking, and rumored to be very clever. Rilla, usually composed, suddenly found herself lisping like a child, feeling embarrassed and wishing he would leave.

"Rilla, determined not to lisp, blurted out a bold ""Yes"" when asked about her ankle. She felt self-conscious, wondering what Kenneth would think of her eagerness.

Despite her insecurities, the magical night with the moonlit sea, gentle waves, and sweet music was unforgettable. Rilla wished she could talk more cleverly and confidently.

There was a commotion among a group of boys near the door; a young man entered and paused, looking somber. It was Jack Elliott, a McGill medical student from across the harbor, not one for social gatherings. Although he was expected in Charlottetown that day and not due back until late, here he stood with a folded paper. Gertrude Oliver shivered, having enjoyed the party with an older acquaintance from Charlottetown. She had forgotten her earlier misgivings until Jack's arrival. The room fell silent as Jack stood without speaking, holding everyone's attention. The sound of revelry outside ceased, and the distant moan of the approaching storm filled the air. A girl's laughter faded, and the room buzzed with light surprise and curiosity. Gertrude and Allan Daly whispered anxiously, while Walter Blythe left pale-faced. Jem arrived with news of the Piper's call for volunteers, signaling England's support for France in the war.|"[""1.

Mary Vance and Miller Douglas were sitting on a lobster trap, content but unaware of Jem's urgency to hoist the lighthouse flag. Mary dismissed the idea of a war in Europe affecting them. Walter warned Mary of the impending global impact of the war, predicting tears and heartbreak for all Canadians. Mary, uncomfortable with Walter's words, found them odd. Harvey Crawford believed the war would end swiftly, but Walter passionately argued otherwise, foreseeing a prolonged conflict with Canada at risk of becoming a German colony.

"""I think all you boys talk the craziest stuff,"" Mary Vance said in disgust, dragging Miller away to the rock-shore. Mary was determined not to let Walter Blythe's silly blather about Pipers and Germans ruin their rare chance for a talk. Meanwhile, Rilla felt lonely and unhappy as Kenneth seemed distracted after Jack Elliott's announcement. She pondered the fleeting nature of joy and youth, wishing she were home. Rilla was startled by the idea of Jem and Jerry going off to the war. Despite feeling ignored by Kenneth, she tried to enjoy the dance with Mark Warren, who proved to be a clumsy dancer.

Rilla attended her first party with excitement, but it turned out to be disappointing. She danced with others, feeling the pain in her slippers and missing Kenneth. As the evening progressed, she found herself sitting by the rock-shore with over-harbour friends, feeling tired and out of place.

Rilla and her friends went hiking, but it wasn't enjoyable for her. She wore fancy shoes with high heels that hurt her feet. Eventually, she had to take them off and walk barefoot, which was painful too. She felt humiliated and started crying. Her friend Mary noticed and scolded her for sitting in the wind earlier, predicting that she might catch a cold. Mary also shared some advice about dealing with men, which Rilla found irritating.

Susan claims she doesn't believe what the papers say, yet she always sneaks to listen at the kitchen door. She's constantly upset but still cooks Jem's favorite dishes. She didn't even make a fuss when Monday napped on Mrs. Rachel Lynde's bed. Shirley calls Susan half angel, half cook, and the only one she never scolds. Faith Meredith seems engaged to Jem now. She shines with bravery, but her smiles are stiff like mother's. I wonder if I could be as strong as her if I had a lover going off to war. Bruce Meredith even cried all night when he heard Jem and Jerry were leaving. Mrs. Meredith shared that he thought the 'K of K' his father mentioned was the King of Kings. He's such a sweet child.

Susan, I keep recalling a night when my baby cried, just a few months old. Gilbert opposed comforting him, fearing it would create bad habits. Yet, I held him close, feeling his arms around my neck. If I hadn't done so twenty-one years ago, I couldn't face tomorrow. Determined, I'll send my boy off with a smile, not as a weak mother. Despite uncertainties, I hope not to cry. Everything changes suddenly, even the old cat passed away. Jem and Jerry left next morning, amid a dull day. The Blythe and Meredith families, along with many others, bid them farewell.

Rilla hesitated at the sight before her. The woman's words were harsh, but there was a baby, fragile and alone, in need of care. Mrs. Conover's callousness was unsettling as she spoke of the baby's mother passing away and the baby's uncertain future. Rilla felt a surge of compassion for the tiny, abandoned child. Mrs. Conover seemed indifferent, already resigned to the baby's fate. Rilla approached the cradle cautiously, gazing at the red-faced infant wrapped in worn flannel.

"When I arrived home and tried on the hat once more in my room, I felt uncertain. It looked very nice, but it seemed too fancy for church and our simple activities in the Glen—too noticeable, in short. It didn't feel this way at the store, but here in my small white room, it did. And that expensive price tag! And the hungry Belgians! When my mother saw the hat and the tag, she just stared at me. Mother is good at giving looks. Father claims she won him over with her gaze years ago in Avonlea school, and I can believe it—although I've heard a strange story about her hitting him with a slate when they first met. Mother was spirited as a girl, I've heard, and even until Jem left, she was full of energy. But back to the point—my new green velvet hat.""That's not the issue. Your allowance is meant to cover what you need reasonably. If you overspend on one thing, you must cut back on something else, and that's not ideal.

Susan was deeply concerned about recent events, fearing that something terrible had happened. She noticed Mr. Pryor smiling after arriving from Charlottetown, a rare sight that worried her. The news of the sinking of the Lusitania spread quickly, leading the Glen boys to break Mr. Pryor's windows in anger over the Kaiser's actions. Susan, although not condoning the boys' behavior, admitted she wouldn't have minded throwing a few stones herself. Norman Douglas expressed strong feelings, believing those responsible for the Lusitania's sinking deserved punishment. Bruce Meredith, a thoughtful boy, pondered the tragedy and prayed for the souls lost. Mary, on the other hand, was resolute in her stance against the Kaiser's actions and decided to take a stand. Despite the turmoil, Susan found solace in the fact that President Wilson would address the issue. Mary, however, was determined to stand firm against the injustice, even if it meant going against Kitty Alec's indifference to the situation.|"[""1.

Rilla sighed, feeling apprehensive about apologizing to Irene. Despite Irene's love for singing publicly, Rilla anticipated a negative reaction. She contemplated the task ahead, comparing it to the bravery of her brothers facing the Huns. Despite her reluctance, she felt compelled to seek Irene's help for the Belgians' benefit. After supper, Rilla reluctantly made her way to Irene's house, dressed in her best attire to appease Irene's critical eye. As she waited in the parlour, Rilla mentally rehearsed the encounter, regretting the past quarrel. When Irene finally arrived, Rilla's embarrassment peaked as she realized she had mismatched her boots and stockings.

Susan affectionately recalled an incident involving Rilla, a well-behaved child who once got into trouble. Rilla and a friend almost swallowed pills as a dare, but her father intervened just in time.

Rilla had a dream that left her anxious about the war. The Ingleside family lived in fear as the Germans advanced towards France. Susan, ever vigilant, kept her thoughts with the soldiers at Verdun.

"""Where are you wandering, Anne o' mine?"" asked the doctor, who even yet, after twenty-four years of marriage, occasionally addressed his wife thus when nobody was about. Anne was sitting on the veranda steps, gazing absently over the wonderful bridal world of spring blossom. Beyond the white orchard was a copse of dark young firs and creamy wild cherries, where the robins were whistling madly; for it was evening and the fire of early stars was burning over the maple grove.

""I was just taking relief from intolerable realities in a dream, Gilbert--a dream that all our children were home again--and all small again--playing in Rainbow Valley. It is always so silent now--but I was imagining I heard clear voices and gay, childish sounds coming up as I used to. I could hear Jem's whistle and Walter's yodel, and the twins' laughter, and for just a few blessed minutes I forgot about the guns on the Western front, and had a little false, sweet happiness.""

The doctor did not answer. Sometimes his work tricked him into forgetting for a few moments the Western front, but not often. There was a good deal of grey now in his still thick curls that had not been there two years ago. Yet he smiled down into the starry eyes he loved--the eyes that had once been so full of laughter, and now seemed always full of unshed tears."|"['1.

Rilla, I've always had premonitions. Once, in Rainbow Valley, I saw the Pied Piper with a shadowy host behind him. Last night, I saw him again, marching with boys in khaki. I know he'll pipe me 'west' tomorrow, but I'm not afraid. I've found freedom from fear here. I feel satisfied. I may not write the poems I dreamed of, but I've helped make Canada safe. We fight for the future of mankind. We'll win, never doubt that. The dead fight with us. When you hear I'm gone, remember laughter and courage. Ken will return to you, and happiness will come. Teach our children the Idea we fought for. Live for it, not just die for it. That will be your work, Rilla. If you do it, we'll know you haven't 'broken faith' with us.|"['1.

Rilla intended to write to Una that night, but time slipped away. She asked for her letter to be read to Una, assuring them both of her deep affection. As they faced the upcoming challenges, Rilla thought of Una's steadfastness and her own laughter, finding solace in their bond. Rilla promised to keep faith, inspired by Walter's sacrifice.

Mrs. Dr. dear, I had every intention of having a civil conversation with Mr. Pryor, but his comment pushed me over the edge. Let me recount the whole encounter. Whiskers sat down, Doc lying nearby pretending to sleep, though I knew better. Hyde, the cat, was on edge all day. Have you noticed how he's more Hyde than Jekyll lately? The more Germany wins, the fiercer he gets. Whiskers tried to win me over by praising Hyde, but when he stroked the cat, Hyde attacked and fled. 'A peculiar creature,' Whiskers remarked. I agreed but kept my cool. When he proposed, I firmly declined. He was shocked, but his true colors showed. 'You'd want to marry me,' he assumed. That's when I lost my composure. 'Go,' I commanded, brandishing the dye-pot. He left hastily, realizing I was not one to trifle with. I doubt he'll be back anytime soon.|"[""1.

Susan, however, was more concerned about setting a kettle on the stove to prevent little Kitchener from getting croup after British victories.
