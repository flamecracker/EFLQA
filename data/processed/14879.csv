The boys from Hilltop Academy, Billy, Harry, and Arthur, were close friends and ready for any adventure except seasickness. They were on a tour of the Spanish Main islands, invited by a shipping merchant, Mr. Smith. The boys, along with Dr. Wise, instructors, a coachman turned cook, and the crew, were on a steam yacht for a learning vacation. Despite fears of seasickness, the boys were excited to explore the islands, study geography practically, and learn from the experience. Jack and Dick, leading spirits at the Academy, discussed the value of hard work over searching for buried treasure. As the yacht sailed towards warmer waters, the boys enjoyed the pleasant weather and the anticipation of new adventures among the islands.|['1.

"""That was supposed to be Alexander Selkirk, the original Robinson Crusoe, Dick,"" said Jack. ""The line is 'I am monarch of all I survey.' You must have recited it more than once in your younger days. That is not altogether a safe place for young Jesse W., though. That rail is not very high, and if we should happen to give a roll----""""No, but I will go down and----"" and Jack started to go to the main deck and speak quietly to the boy. But before he had hardly said the words there was a sudden startled cry and Jack, looking down quickly, saw that the very thing he had feared had taken place.""H'm! pretty clever of Sheldon,"" sneered a stout, unprepossessing boy, who seemed to be always scowling. ""Knocks the kid overboard, and then goes to his rescue to make himself solid with the father. Very clever stroke, that, and just like him!""Herring, who was by no means a favorite in the Academy, quite the reverse, in fact, had not supposed that Percival had heard his uncalled for and utterly false assertion, and now hurried away with a snarl, evidently fearing that Dick would carry out his threat.The captain, as soon as possible, gave orders to stop the engines, and to hold the yacht near to the place where the boys had gone down, being ready to turn and go to their assistance when they should"|"['1.

Percival overheard Herring accusing Jack of pushing a boy overboard to appear heroic, but Percival defended Jack, explaining that Jack was on the bridge at the time. Both Jack and Percival witnessed the incident where young Jesse fell overboard. Despite Arthur's negative comments about Jack, the boys were unharmed after falling into the warm Caribbean waters. Young Smith expressed his gratitude to Jack for saving him and promised to speak to his father about helping Jack with his schooling. Jack humbly downplayed his heroic act, stating that anyone else could have done the same. Young Jesse acknowledged Jack's quick actions and dismissed the false rumors about Jack pushing him overboard.|"['1.

Jack observed Dr. Wise conversing with the ship's captain and the first officer, while a seasoned sailor chatted with Bucephalus nearby. Percival mentioned that Jack had tried to warn someone about the danger before an unexpected storm hit. Dick argued that warnings were pointless if not acted upon. The sudden storm caused chaos on the ship, with thunder, lightning, and howling winds. Despite the terrifying ordeal, some boys remained calm, like Jesse W. Smith, who believed the storm was a learning experience. Eventually, the storm subsided, and the ship found itself beached in a tranquil bay. The boys, relieved and curious, awaited daylight to determine their location. The moonlit night brought a sense of calm after the tumultuous events at sea.|"[""1.

"""We are currently at the bottom, sir, and it's uncertain how long we'll remain here,"" Captain Storms remarked. ""The next high tide might lift us, or it might not. I believe we've been grounded since we entered the bay. Lightening the ship is necessary, but I'm unsure how to do so.""

""No, there are no leaks or water intake. The sandy bottom is likely the reason we're stuck, not sharp coral. The moon isn't quite full, so we might get higher water levels when it is. We can check tonight. In the meantime, the boats are available for exploration on the island. It seems uninhabited, as many islands in this area are.""

""This island is in the Spanish Main, known for old pirates,"" mentioned the sailor Ben Bowline. ""Boys, don't waste time looking for buried treasure. There's more to life than that.""

After breakfast, two boats were launched for the boys to explore the island while the captain sent a group to find the bay's exit. The island showcased various plants and flowers, but Jack and Percival focused on navigating rather than sightseeing. They trekked through different terrains, understanding that climbing a mountain involves ups and downs."|"['1.

As they continued their journey, the boys found themselves on a rocky shore with immense rock formations flanking them. The white surf crashed over reefs in the distance, giving the appearance of an uninhabited and inaccessible place. Jack speculated that the island's lack of people was due to its small size and challenging accessibility. While observing the surroundings, they noticed a peculiar object resembling a flagstaff. The boys discussed the yacht's situation, stranded due to the reefs blocking the bay's entrance. Despite the predicament, the doctor assured them of safety with the yacht's wireless service for communication. The boys returned to the yacht, where plans were made to wait for rescue.

"He sailed until he found a spot with woods and a narrow white beach. ""This looks good,"" he said, tying the boat to an old stump. The group rested and then climbed to a higher point for a better view of the bay. With trees and rocks aiding their ascent, they reached a larger resting place with a clearer view. Jack and Dick helped Jesse up the bank, cautioning him to watch his step. As they descended, they noticed a light and a vessel submerged in a hole. ""This must be the sunken ship,"" Dick exclaimed.

"""We might end up in the water sooner than we think,"" whispered Jack. ""No, I believe it's safer to stay put. Venturing into that place seems risky. Let's wait for another opportunity."" ""It's wide enough,"" Percival remarked. ""Indeed, these are ship's timbers. The vessel must have hit hard to create such a gash. We're on the lower deck level. Although I don't see much cargo, there seems to be a way aft. This area is likely the steerage, with the lower hold below us. We could probably walk to the after bulkhead, and if there's a door, we might enter the after cabin."" ""If we had a torch, I'd join you,"" Jack added, ""but it's too risky. Let's wait. We'll have time to explore later. We'll revisit the site,"" Percival suggested. ""Let's keep it to ourselves for now to avoid unnecessary risks."" They returned to their boat, rowed back to the yacht, and shared about their reef visit without mentioning the mysterious ship discovery. ""We'll need to stay here until I can seek help.

"The boys had classes and a talk that day, and the following morning and afternoon were free for them to explore the island or go out on the water with some sailors. ""I want to check out that old ship again,"" Percival told Jack after dinner. ""I've got a strong rope, an axe, and a flashlight. Will you come with me, Jack? We should bring J.W., but he's small and it might be risky."" ""We can take him next time if we find something,"" Jack replied. ""I don't want any harm to come to him.

As they advanced, they noticed boxes, bales, and barrels on both sides, with obstacles blocking their path at times. ""Wait a second, Dick,"" Jack whispered. ""I hear water. We don't want to get flooded. There might be water in the after hold and cabin, and we don't want to get swamped."" ""There's no water here,"" Dick assured. ""Let's keep going; I believe we can reach the cabin. I think there's a passage on one side of the companion leading to the after cabin.""

"Jack chuckled, ""Remember the panel where you can watch the fish through the glass? Verne wrote about it, and now we're seeing it for real."" The cabin the boys were in was small, likely the commander's room. A skylight above a table hinted at writing and dining activities. Lockers, a chest, and scattered items filled the space.

Some rocks fell, causing a noise. With a rope, the boys found themselves stuck. They suspected foul play. Percival believed Herring and Merritt were involved.

Captain Storms assured Jack that the sunken treasure they found belonged to him under the law of treasure trove. The cabin where the treasure was hidden seemed secure with iron doors, likely watertight, and built like a strong room to protect the valuables from any crew members who might get greedy.

Jack discovered a spot where Jesse W. could descend, but not himself, Percival, or the large captain. He cautioned Jesse W. not to burden himself with gold, as it had been the downfall of many.

Returning to the yacht first for the captain to get aboard, Jack and Percival then took the boat and went to the outer bay on a little exploring trip of their own, the rest not caring to make any more explorations at that time. There was a hatchet to cut their way through the thicket if necessary when they went ashore, and Percival had a rifle to shoot any game they might come across, both placed on one of the forward thwarts. Jack had his pocket flashlight in case they went into dark places, and Dick had a revolver in his pocket, declaring it might be useful if they encountered an enemy. As they rowed slowly, Jack steered the boat toward an opening in the rocks, entering a water cave with plenty of room. Suddenly, Jack spotted a devil fish, an octopus, at the farther end of the cave, glaring at them with blood-red eyes. The octopus seized Jack, drawing him underwater. Percival used the hatchet to fend off the creature, but Jack was pulled deeper into the cave. After a harrowing escape, the boys reflected on their thrilling experience and continued exploring the island.|['1.

"""It startled me to think there might be others on the island,"" Percival said as they walked through the dense vegetation, unable to see the sky. ""It's pretty dark here.""""He's a dangerous snake, either a fer de lance or a close relative, both deadly. Their bite is almost always fatal due to the fast-acting venom.
