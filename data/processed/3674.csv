In the days of King Alfred, England was overrun by pagan barbarians who brought slaughter and destruction. Imagine if, during the great mutiny in India, the English were outnumbered by natives and the mutiny was successful everywhere. This was akin to the suffering the Saxons endured at the hands of the Danes. King Alfred, a remarkable figure, rescued his people with his wisdom, courage, and patience. His reign shaped England's future, yet many know little about it. This story aims to fill that gap, drawing from trustworthy accounts like the Saxon Chronicles.

In a cozy hut, a large wolf-hound lay near the fire. The boy spoke to the hound, who howled softly in agreement. The boy reassured the hound, promising to go hunting together once they leave. The hound lazily wagged his tail. As the boy left for the water, the hound stayed to guard the hut. The boy paddled a unique boat made of woven rods and hide to catch fish and eels.

"Almost silently, as the boy dipped his paddle in the water, the hound's keen ear picked up the sound. The dog stood at the swamp's edge, wagging his tail in a dignified welcome as his master stepped onto dry land. ""There, Wolf, what do you think? A good catch of fish, eels, and wild ducks. Bones for your meal tonight, not to fill your stomach, but to add flavor. Let's light a fire, pluck the birds, and bake cakes for father and Egbert,"" the boy said. As the sun set, the flames brightened the hut. After preparing supper, the boy sat beside the dog. Suddenly, Wolf perked up, ears alert. ""Do you hear them?"" the boy asked, jumping up.

"""It's a shame, father, that the Saxons aren't united under one leader; then we could defend England against the Danes. If the people rose against each band of Northmen as they arrived, they wouldn't gain a foothold among us,"" the son lamented. The father agreed, blaming the divisions between Saxon kingdoms for the Danes' stronghold. He placed hope in the West Saxons, who had recently united with Mercia through marriage alliances. The father proposed relocating to Croyland Abbey in Lincolnshire to monitor events.

Ethelbald, Ethelwulf's eldest son, acted as regent during his father's absence. He was so upset by his father's marriage to Judith that he rebelled against him. Judith was crowned queen at her marriage, which was against West Saxon customs, causing the people to support Ethelbald. When Ethelwulf returned, a division of the kingdom was agreed upon. Ethelbald received Wessex, the main part of the kingdom, and Ethelwulf took Kent. Ethelwulf later died, leaving Kent to his second son, Ethelbert. Ethelbald married Judith, causing outrage, but he died shortly after. Ethelbert, King of Kent, then united Wessex with his own dominions. The Danes invaded Mercia, and the West Saxons, along with the Mercians, besieged them at Nottingham. A treaty was made, allowing the Danes to leave unharmed. The Danes are expected to return, and every Saxon must be ready to defend against them. Edmund, the youngest brother, is preparing for battle. His father discusses abolishing serfdom to strengthen the fight against the Danes. Edmund ponders this idea, finding it both strange and intriguing.|"[""1.

Messengers were immediately dispatched throughout the nearby area, summoning every man to gather the next morning at Croyland. At daybreak, they started arriving, armed with swords, sickles on poles, and makeshift pikes. Although rough and ragged, Eldred was pleased to see the hardy and robust men who were used to hard work and likely to stand strong in battle. Most carried shields made of woven osiers covered in skin. The abbey's armory provided swords and axes to those poorly armed. With determination in their eyes, the band, led by Eldred, set off, followed by eighty monks from the abbey under lay brother Toley. The monks, well-fed and robust, were aware of the Danes' merciless nature and were prepared to fight for their religion and country. Algar, Eldred, and other leaders moved among the assembled force, inspiring and encouraging them to stand firm against the enemy. The priests also motivated the men, emphasizing that God would be on their side. Edmund observed the diverse scenes in the camp, where harpers sang of their fathers' exploits and priests appealed to religious and patriotic sentiments. Men sharpened weapons and prepared for battle, while priests heard confessions. The armies eventually faced each other near Kesteven, with the Danes presenting a formidable appearance with their shields and weaponry.|['1.

The warriors of Saxon and Danish descent clashed on the battlefield, their fierce shouts echoing as swords clashed against shields. The Danes, dark-skinned and formidable, led the charge with a rain of arrows, met with equal ferocity by the Saxons, fair-haired and resolute. As the conflict raged, young Edmund, armed with a spear, sought to find openings in the Danish defense, supporting his kinsmen in the fray. The Saxons, under the command of Algar, stood firm against the onslaught, pushing back the Danes who began to falter. Despite initial victories, news of a massive Danish army approaching forced a strategic retreat, leaving the Saxons to regroup and prepare for the impending battle.

In the morning, the Danes held funeral ceremonies for their fallen kings, while the Saxons, solemn and resolute, received the holy sacrament and readied for battle. Algar strategically positioned his troops on higher ground, dividing them into wings led by commanders like Eldred, Toley, and Morcar. The Saxons formed a solid mass with linked bucklers, while the Danes, outnumbering them, attempted to break through but failed. After a day-long struggle, the Danes feigned a retreat, tricking the Saxons into pursuing them. However, the Danish horsemen and infantry swiftly turned back, overwhelming the disordered Saxons.

"Edmund, with a heavy heart, saw his kinsman Egbert approach, wounded and weary. The young Saxon, determined to aid his relative, quickly tended to Egbert's injuries, using torn strips of fabric to staunch the bleeding.

His uncle decided that they must leave before the Danes arrived. They prepared the relics and valuables to be taken to safety. As smoke rose from nearby villages signaling the Danes' approach, they rowed away to safety. The abbot and monks who stayed behind were brutally murdered by the Danes in search of treasure.

Fish was served first, then venison, wild boar, chickens, and other meats. Confections, mainly honey-based, were placed on the table. The king and Prince Alfred toasted their guests during the meal. No forks were used; instead, bread was used to pick up the meat. A harper played and sang during the feast. After dinner, warm water with lavender was offered for guests to wash their hands. Later, Egbert recounted the details of the battle at Kesteven to Prince Alfred. After spending a week at Reading, they left for the lands assigned to Edmund. Upon arrival, they found a newly built, spacious house. The thanes of the district paid their respects to the new ealdorman. Edmund emphasized the need to prepare for a potential Danish invasion, proposing the construction of a fort at Moorcaster. The fort was to utilize the existing Roman fortification by reinforcing the earthen banks with stone walls and turrets. Edmund suggested that half of the serfs from each estate contribute to the construction, with fifty freemen assisting with stone cutting and laying.|['1.

Edmund and Egbert worked tirelessly on constructing a new fort. The Roman fort was a rectangular shape, with sides about 200 yards long and ends half that length. It was surrounded by two earthen banks with wide ditches. The inner bank was widened to 15 feet, and a 4-foot thick wall was built on top of it. Towers were raised every 30 yards, each 10 feet above the wall. The entrance had solid masonry buttresses supporting high gates. The outer bank's opening was 50 yards away from the inner gate, making it challenging for intruders. Despite the hard work of 500 men, news arrived that King Edmund had been defeated by the Danes. Edmund was ordered to assemble his men to join the king near Devizes due to a Danish threat at Reading.|"['1.

Edmund fought bravely alongside the men of Sherborne in Alfred's division. The Danes attacked fiercely, forcing Alfred's men to defend. Alfred, eager to counterattack, sent a messenger to his brother for support. However, the king was at mass and couldn't be disturbed. Alfred, realizing the urgency, led his men into battle. The Saxons fought fiercely, pushing through the Danes. Eventually, Alfred's brother joined the battle, turning the tide. The Saxons, fueled by patriotism and determination, defeated the Danes. The Danish king and many of his men were killed, and the Saxons emerged victorious, claiming spoils of war. Edmund, though young, fought bravely, earning praise from Alfred and his mentor, Egbert.

After a recent victory, the Saxons faced a setback when the Danes, under Somerled, attacked Reading. Despite initial success, the Saxons suffered a defeat at Merton due to disarray after prematurely celebrating. King Ethelred was fatally wounded, and his son, Prince Alfred, took the throne. Alfred, known for his wisdom and courage, instilled hope in the Saxons. Despite initial challenges, Alfred led a small force against the Danes at Wilton. The Saxons fought valiantly, initially gaining the upper hand. However, their lack of discipline led to a defeat as they scattered in pursuit of the retreating Danes, who regrouped and counterattacked. King Alfred emphasized the importance of order and discipline for future success against the Danes, drawing inspiration from the Roman troops' tactics described by Julius Caesar.|"['1.

If only we had more time to train our soldiers in discipline and order, but unfortunately, there is no time for that. The Danes keep receiving reinforcements and launching fresh waves of attacks, while the Saxons are losing morale despite their valiant efforts in battles. The king tried to raise an army again, but the people did not respond. Many battles were fought in Wessex, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. The Danes kept growing stronger, while the Saxons were dwindling. The devastated country saw its people dispirited and refusing to fight further. King Alfred proposed buying off the Danes to save Wessex. Negotiations were successful, and the Danes agreed to retreat in exchange for a large sum of money. The country enjoyed a brief period of peace under Alfred's wise rule, but he knew the Danes would return. Alfred suggested building a fleet to intercept the Danes at sea, a strategy he believed could turn the tide in their favor.|"[""1.

"""I am willing to construct a ship,"" said Edmund. ""The fort is complete, and with the land's income, I can start building a ship right away. If the Danes grant us time, once the first ship is done, I will build another. I am eager to do this because if the Danes take over completely, we may have to take to the sea and become plunderers. The ship will be large and sturdy, serving as my home if I am forced out of England. With it, we can sail to ports in France and hidden spots in England, refitting as needed and seizing Danish ships laden with loot. With a strong crew, including Egbert and our best fighters, we can defend ourselves against Danish galleys.""

""The plan is sound, Edmund,"" the king remarked. ""Living freely at sea, even if eventually defeated by the Danes, is better than hiding in the woods. Unfortunately, I must stay with my people to fight the invaders. For you, it's a different story.""

""I won't act on this plan until all is lost here,"" Edmund explained. ""I will defend the fort to the end. But if the Danes conquer our lands, having a refuge like a ship will be beneficial.""

Edmund pledged all his land's earnings to build a grand ship, hidden in a secluded wood by the river Parrot to evade the Danes. The shipwright's plan included digging a dock away from the river to launch the large vessel. Edmund, along with his serfs and craftsmen, began the construction. King Alfred admired the ship's progress, likening it to Noah's ark. As the Danish threat loomed again in 875, Edmund faced resistance from his tenants, who doubted the fight's worth. They argued that continued battles would deplete their forces while the Danes grew stronger. Some suggested surrender to avoid further devastation.

Edmund and Egbert discussed a plan to defend against the Danish invasion. They proposed exempting married men from service and forming a band of youths and unmarried men. These men would be trained and kept permanently armed to defend the earldom. Landowners who did not contribute men to the levy would pay an additional assessment. Edmund pledged to pay the men in the band wages and cover their expenses. The proposal was agreed upon, bringing gladness to the earldom. Ninety young men assembled for service, inspired by the victories of the men of Sherborne. Edmund trained the men in a formation resembling a wedge, based on ancient Theban tactics.

Edmund and his band were trained for battle. Egbert, armed with a battle-axe, led the wedge formation. Edmund, on horseback, commanded from the center. The men practiced diligently for three weeks, mastering their movements. They could swiftly switch from pursuit to formation, each knowing their place. The men were eager, confident in their ability to break through the Danish lines. Armed with pikes and swords, they were ready for combat. When Edmund joined the king, they found few allies willing to fight. Edmund was cautioned to avoid large Danish parties. Instead, they set out to ambush smaller groups. As they neared the Danish territory, they witnessed villages burning. A plan was devised to surprise the Danes at Bristowe. Under the cover of darkness, they approached the village, ready to strike.|['1. What was Egbert armed with during the battle training?\nA) Sword\nB) Pike\nC) Battle-axe\nD) Bow\nE) Spear', '2.

The Saxons silently approached the Danish guards, each bowman ready with an arrow. Edmund's signal unleashed a flurry of arrows, swiftly taking down the sentries. Meanwhile, some men opened the pen towards the village, while others mingled with the cattle, driving them towards the Danes. The thundering herd charged at the village, with the Saxons close behind, creating chaos. Startled, the Danes tried to redirect the stampede but failed. As the herd passed, more attackers emerged, catching the Danes off guard. The Saxons inflicted heavy casualties before retreating. Edmund believed in these night assaults to wear down the Danes, causing them to fear and eventually leave the land. Despite successful strikes, the Danes retaliated with spies and a large force led by Haffa, prompting a showdown in the woods.

The Saxons, led by Edmund, formed a wedge and charged at the Danes with a fierce war cry. The assault was powerful, breaking through the Danish line like twigs. The Danes, surprised, closed in around the Saxons, hindering their movement. Edmund's triangle formation advanced, sweeping away the Danes with archer support. Haffa, a Danish leader, was slain in the battle. Despite fierce fighting, the Danes retreated after losing many men. The Saxons pursued, cutting down fleeing enemies. Edmund's strategic commands kept the Saxons organized, ready to face any Danish attacks. The Saxons triumphed, defeating a larger force without losing a man. Edmund's success earned praise from King Alfred. The Saxons rested and trained after the battle, preparing for future encounters.

In the early hours of the morning, the Saxons spotted smoke rising in the distance, a grim sign that the enemy was pillaging their homes. Women wailed, and men cursed as they realized their villages were under attack. Later, mounted Danes circled the fort, assessing its defenses before departing. Throughout the day, the enemy kept their distance. The Saxons, vigilant and determined, sent scouts to monitor the Danes, who were reveling in stolen goods from the Saxons' cellars. Edmund and Egbert decided to confront the Danes head-on. Under cover of darkness, the Saxons ambushed the sleeping Danes, sparking a fierce battle. Despite the odds, the Saxons emerged victorious, dealing a heavy blow to the invaders. The Danes retaliated, but the Saxons, swift and strategic, outmaneuvered them.

The impressive sight of the large Danish army struck fear into many defenders of the fort. However, the young ealdorman's confident demeanor and the sturdy walls reassured them. The Danes stopped about a quarter of a mile away, and a few of their chiefs rode forward, displaying their grand helmets and shields. One of them, King Uffa, threatened the Saxons for their actions the night before. In response, the brave ealdorman, Edmund, boldly declared their readiness to defend the fort. The Saxons, inspired by his words, shouted in defiance. The Danes then began setting up a camp, preparing for a possible attack. The priests within the fort encouraged the soldiers to resist and sought divine protection. The following morning, the Danes organized for an assault on the fort, dividing into groups to attack from different sides.

The Danes launched an attack on the gate, but the Saxons defended themselves fiercely. The Saxons had a strategic plan, with archers positioned on a raised mound behind the gate. As the gates gave way, the Saxons unleashed a barrage of arrows, decimating the Danish forces. The Danes tried to breach the gate but were met with a wall of spears and arrows. The Saxons held their ground, and the Danes, unable to break through, suffered heavy losses. The Danish king, enraged by the failed assault, called off the attack. The Saxons celebrated their victory, holding a solemn mass to give thanks. Stones were then piled up in the gateway to prevent any surprise attacks.

The entire army was busy all day with this task. The following day, many trees were cut down and taken to the camp. For the next two days, the Danes focused on making war machines to attack the walls. Meanwhile, Edmund and Egbert taught the other soldiers how to defend against the Danes' attacks. The oxen skins were saved and greased for defense. The Danes set up their war machines and started attacking the walls. The Saxons fought back with arrows, destroying the machines. They then used ladders to surprise the Danes, causing a delay in the siege. The Saxons built defenses behind the walls, making it hard for the Danes to breach. Despite the fierce battle, the Saxons successfully defended their walls, causing heavy losses to the Danes.|"['1.

Loud cheers erupted from the triumphant Saxons as the Danes retreated. Their leaders worked hard to restrain the Saxons from pursuing, knowing that the Danes could overpower them with their superior numbers if they lured them into the open. The Saxons wisely stayed put, allowing the defeated Danes to leave without interference. The following day, the Saxons rejoiced as they saw the Danes had left their camp. Scouts confirmed the departure, and the Saxons buried their fallen foes. While the Saxons were relieved in this area, the Danes continued to advance in other parts of the kingdom, causing despair among the Saxons. Many fled to the coast, hoping for peace in France. King Alfred called for action in 877 as the Danes threatened Exeter. Edmund, with a crew, set sail to block the Danes' reinforcements. Despite rough seas and a looming storm, the Saxons prepared to face the approaching Danish fleet.|"['**1.

During a storm, the Saxons bravely faced the Danes at sea. The Saxons, with their skilled archers, caused chaos among the Danish rowers. The rough sea made it impossible for the Danes to board the Saxon ships. The Saxons used their spears to repel any attempts to climb aboard. The Danes, overwhelmed and fearing the storm, tried to flee to the shore. However, the rocky coast proved fatal, as their ships were wrecked. Those who made it to land were met with fierce resistance from the locals. The Danish fleet was completely destroyed. Meanwhile, in Mercia, King Burhred's attempts to buy off the Danes failed, leading to his pilgrimage to Rome. The Danes installed a puppet king in Mercia, who they later betrayed and stripped of his wealth. The Danes settled in England, causing fear and destruction.|['1.

During the Danish invasion, panic spread among the West Saxons, forcing many to flee to the woods. When the Danes moved on, leaving destruction in their wake, the Saxons returned to till the land. Edmund, realizing the futility of resistance, prepared a ship named the Dragon. With a crew of ninety men, they practiced rowing until they moved swiftly through the water. Equipped with oars and sails, the Dragon set out to confront the Danish galleys. As the Danes approached, the Wessex standard was raised, and the Dragon advanced to meet them. This marked the beginning of a daring voyage to confront the enemy and defend their kingdom.|['1.

The Saxons on the Dragon ship were amazed to see a large ship flying the Saxon flag. The Dragon quickly overtook the smaller Danish galleys, and a fierce battle ensued. The Saxons unleashed a volley of arrows, swiftly boarded the enemy galley, and defeated most of the Danes. The remaining Danes either jumped into the water or fled to the shore. The Saxons captured the galleys, looted them of valuable treasures, and set them on fire. The Dragon then pursued and captured more Danish galleys. Edmund and Egbert strategized for an upcoming battle against six large Danish war-ships. The Dragon, a strong and agile ship, prepared to engage in combat, using its height advantage to rain arrows down on the enemy. The Saxons were determined to defend their ship and continue their successful raids against the Danes.|"['1.

Ignoring the struggling men in the water, the Dragon continued its course. The next boat tried to avoid her path, but was struck a few feet from the stern, cutting it in two. The Saxons quickly fastened their oars and readied their weapons. The Danes struggled to board the Dragon, but the Saxons defended themselves by forming a thick hedge of spears. After a fierce battle, the Saxons managed to repel the Danes who tried to board. As the Dragon sailed away, the Danes tried to lash themselves to her sides but failed. The Saxons, with some casualties, were content to see the Danes retreat. The Dragon then sailed to Sandwich to repair and recruit new crew members.

The Saxon galley, led by Edmund and Egbert, encountered a fierce storm off the coast near Yarmouth. With the wind blowing strongly, they made a daring move to enter the river to seek shelter. The crew worked tirelessly against the violent sea to navigate the galley through the river's bar. Despite facing arrows and threats from the Danes on the shore, the Dragon managed to anchor safely. As a fleet of Danish galleys approached, the crew swiftly hoisted the sail and advanced to meet the enemy. With exceptional strength and speed, the Dragon plowed through the Danish boats, leaving a trail of destruction in her wake.

Running swiftly before the wind, the Dragon neared the grand Roman fort, its towering walls leaving Edmund amazed. The sail was lowered, and the ship anchored by the bank. The crew disembarked, securing the vessel. The walls, mostly intact, enclosed a vast area. They quickly blocked the gateway, guarded by Saxon defenders against the Danes. Sentries were posted, and feeling safe, Edmund and his group returned to the Dragon for the night. The storm raged on, deterring any Danish attacks. The next day, Danes approached but retreated upon seeing the Saxons' preparedness. As the storm calmed, the Saxons readied to head seaward. With oars ready, they aimed to slip past the Danish ships. Approaching Yarmouth, they encountered a barrier of trees across the river, planning a strategic approach to overcome it.|"['1.

Edmund agreed to drop a light anchor, and the Dragon floated quietly in the stream. The Danes showed great animation, crossing the river in large numbers. They gathered a strong force at both ends of the boom and in boats close behind it to stop the Saxons from cutting the lashings. The Saxons onboard the Dragon were confident in their ability to break through the enemy lines with their close formation and fire from the forecastle. As the tide turned, the anchor was raised, and the Dragon rowed to the bank. Sixty fighters led by Egbert landed, while Edmund and the rest positioned themselves on the forecastle. The Saxons advanced steadily, shielded by long shields, and repelled the Danes with arrows. The Saxons cut the cables of the boom, allowing them to board the ship and escape down the river. Despite the Danes' efforts, the Dragon outmaneuvered and defeated them, capturing several ships along the way.|['1.

The Northmen's resistance was quickly subdued, but their leader valiantly protected the ladder to the poop. Struck by arrows and wounded, he knelt as Edmund prepared to climb. Suddenly, a young Norse maiden emerged from the cabin, pleading for her father's life. Moved by her plea, Edmund spared him, explaining their fight against oppression. The girl, grateful, tended to her father's wounds. Eventually, they allowed the Northmen to sail to Norway with their plundered goods. The Danish leader, Jarl Siegbert, acknowledged Edmund's tactics and vowed not to return. The Dragon sailed home, wary of a Danish fleet's pursuit.

During their absence, nothing significant had occurred. The Danes controlled the land, and King Alfred was in hiding. Most Danes were at Chippenham, with some scattered around. Disguised as locals, Edmund and Egbert went to Exeter and traded the less valuable part of the Dragon's cargo. They sold clothing, wine, arms, and more at low prices due to scarce money. The rest was sent to Exeter. The profits were divided among the crew, with shares for the king and leaders. They used the money to help their families.

"As the light brightened, the danger ahead became more evident. A tall, iron-bound coast loomed in front of them, stretching as far as they could see. The waves crashed violently against the base, spraying high up the cliffs.""We're heading for disaster,"" said Edmund. ""If we turn into the wind, we might follow the coast and find a place to land before it's too late."" The ship, Dragon, struggled as each wave hit, pushing it closer to the coast. The crew feared the ship would be wrecked soon. As they neared a headland, hope seemed lost until they spotted a gap in the cliffs. They steered into it, finding shelter in a calm inlet.

Edmund, accompanied by a few followers skilled in archery and armed with spears, disembarked from the Dragon, which was moored near a fishing village. Unbeknownst to the Dragon's crew, the villagers had observed the strange ship and sent messengers to nearby settlements. The next day, a force gathered to attack the Dragon. As the Norsemen advanced through the forest towards the ship, they were ambushed by a group of Saxons. A fierce battle ensued, prompting Edmund to blow a whistle and shout for help. The Saxons on board quickly joined the fight, defending the ship against the Danes.

It was decided to take him to the jarl of the area, who would surely want to know why the strange ship had arrived. The Northmen were certain the Dragon was a Saxon vessel. Despite the Saxons' conquest of England, it was odd to see their warships in a northern fiord. Edmund, understanding the Norse language, pondered his fate. Carried by twelve men through the forest, he eventually felt well enough to walk. Upon reaching Jarl Bijorn's rough timber dwelling, Edmund faced the massive jarl and his son. The neigh of the jarl's war-horse signaled a favorable omen. Bijorn, impressed, decided to spare Edmund from a sacrifice to Odin. Edmund revealed his identity as an ealdorman of King Alfred and explained how he ended up on their shores due to a storm while chasing Northmen ships.|"['1.

A young Saxon named Edmund stood proudly before the Northmen, led by the jarl Bijorn. The jarl admired Edmund's stature and strength, acknowledging his bravery in battle against the Northmen. Despite being a formidable foe, Edmund humbly credited his victories to the valour of his comrades. Impressed by Edmund's courage, the jarl considered offering him as a sacrifice to Odin for good fortune. The group then journeyed to a temple of Odin to consult the omens using a bag of marked sticks. The priest revealed that the outcome would determine whether Edmund's presence brought luck or if he was to be a sacrifice.

In ancient times, a jarl sought to keep a young Saxon leader, Edmund, as his slave. The jarl used a ritual involving sticks to determine Edmund's fate. The priest drew three sticks, and the last one decided Edmund's future. The jarl was pleased as the stick favored keeping Edmund, causing tension with Sweyn. Edmund's new role involved serving the jarl and his family. The jarl's wife, Ulfra, and daughters were strong and respected. Edmund's daily tasks included gathering firewood and serving during feasts where plans for a voyage were discussed. As the group moved south for a conference, tensions arose between Sweyn and his father regarding marriage. Edmund planned an escape with other slaves at the gathering near the shore where many galleys were docked.|"[""1.

The chief and his family received a warm welcome from their fellow warriors. The following day, Bijorn invited Edmund to a banquet where they were to meet. At four in the afternoon, they headed to a large tent. Edmund waited outside until the food was brought in, then joined them and stood behind his master. Edmund noticed that the man dining with Bijorn was the father of the maiden he had encountered before. As the meal began, Edmund saw the girl looking at him. She spoke up, recognizing Edmund as the one who spared their lives. The father, Siegbert, expressed his gratitude and offered to buy Edmund's freedom.

Freda went about her tasks while Edmund strolled to see the galleys on the beach. The sailing ships were big and heavy, while the rowing galleys were light and elegant. They had low hulls and either a swan-like neck or a sharp prow. Some had seats for twenty rowers on each side and both sails and oars. When it was almost time for dinner, Edmund returned to Siegbert's tent, where he found the jarl upset. The council had discussed an expedition to France and decided to consult the gods through a combat between a Dane and a captive. Sweyn, Bijorn's son, was to fight Edmund.

In a meeting between the leaders, the crowd favored the young Saxon, seeing Jarl Siegbert's words as just. Eric spoke with Sweyn, supporting the Saxon. Sweyn challenged Edmund to a fight, not to the death but to determine the victor. Edmund accepted, emphasizing that Saxons fight for their homes, not personal glory. The Northmen agreed with Edmund, and the combat began. Both fighters, bare-chested with shields and helmets, wore brass-covered garments and sandals. Edmund wielded a lighter sword with a prayer to Woden, while Sweyn used a heavier weapon. Despite Sweyn's strength, Edmund defended well, impressing the spectators.

"The Danish gods, Thor and Woden, had become the divinities of the land, and the Saxons, in whom Christianity had but recently supplanted the superstitions of paganism, were fast returning to the worship of the pagan gods. Edmund and his companions were shocked at the change. On reaching home they found that the ravages of the Danes had here been particularly severe, doubtless in revenge for the heavy loss which had been sustained by them in their attack upon Edmund's fortification. His own abode had been completely levelled to the ground, and the villages and farmhouses for the most part wholly destroyed. His people were lying in rude shelters which they had raised, but their condition was very much better than that of the people in general.

The news of Edmund's return spread like wildfire, and excited the most extreme joy among his people, who had long given him up for lost. He found to his delight that the Dragon had returned safely, and that she was laid up in her old hiding place.

Edmund wanted to explore the island, even without the king. A fisherman offered a small boat that could fit four people. Edmund, Egbert, and one follower boarded, instructing the rest to stay. The fisherman steered through narrow channels in the swamp. The journey was eerie with snow-covered trees and rustling rushes. Eventually, they reached higher ground, Athelney. The fisherman mentioned it as a safe haven from the Danes due to its marshy and secluded nature. Edmund decided to stay, and they encountered a cottage. The resident mentioned that the island was home to Saxons in hiding, living off fishing and woodcutting.

From sunrise to sunset, Edmund and Egbert, with the help of the Somerset thanes, trained the soldiers to swiftly shift from chaos to order. The men were amazed at how quickly they grasped the tactics, thanks to Edmund's bugle calls. Eager and confident, they prepared to face the Danes. In April, messengers spread the word for the Saxons to be ready. Alfred led his troops from Athelney to Egbertesstan, now Brixton. The Golden Dragon flew high as they marched. By May 12, a vast Saxon force had gathered. Armed, they awaited Alfred. Cheers erupted as he arrived, inspiring loyalty and determination. Arms were distributed, and groups were formed. The next day, they set off towards the Danish camp at Chippenham. The Saxons approached Ethandune, where the Danes, led by King Guthorn, awaited. Despite the Danish confidence, the Saxons, under Alfred's command, executed a strategic attack. The Saxons, driven by hatred for their oppressors, fought fiercely. Alfred's plan, with Edmund's crucial role, led to a decisive victory. The Danes were overwhelmed, fleeing in defeat.|"['1.

King Alfred's army achieved a significant victory over the Danes at Chippenham. With fresh reinforcements arriving constantly, the Saxons felt empowered to secure a complete triumph. Alfred, confident in his growing forces, chose not to attack the Danish camp but waited for them to surrender due to scarcity. The Danes, exhausted and weakened by hunger, offered their submission after fourteen days, promising to leave the kingdom swiftly. Despite the desire for revenge among his people, Alfred, considering the long-term benefits, spared the Danes. The news of Guthorn's intention to convert to Christianity brought joy to Alfred and the Saxons, as they saw it as a pledge of peace and alliance between the two kingdoms, ensuring a more secure future.|"[""1.

The victory at Ethandune was a turning point for the Saxons. It prevented the Danes from dominating England and preserved Christianity and civilization. King Alfred's wise laws and institutions raised Saxon England to new heights of civilization. After the victory, Guthorn and his warriors were baptized, marking a significant shift. The treaty between Alfred and Athelstan established boundaries and rules for commerce. The Danes gradually left Mercia, with some choosing to depart rather than convert. Edmund and Egbert focused on rebuilding their lands, aided by plunder from their voyages. Prosperity returned to Wessex, especially in the district governed by Edmund. Despite a brief return of the Danes, England enjoyed relative peace for two years as the Danes focused on other regions.|"['1.

The Northmen's swift ships gave them a huge advantage, allowing them to raid without hindrance. They would suddenly appear, plunder, kill, and abduct before the Franks could react. Alfred restored his kingdom during this time of peace, passing laws, rebuilding churches, and welcoming back exiles. Alfred's rule expanded as Kent rejoined Wessex, and Mercia was governed by Ethelred under Alfred's command. Edmund, less scholarly than Alfred, aided in battles against lingering Danish threats. One day, the English ships led by Edmund faced off against Northmen pirates. The Saxons fought fiercely, and Edmund's strategic horn call turned the tide, leading to a decisive victory against the Danes.

Alfred and his fleet faced a fierce battle against the Danish ships, resulting in the capture of four vessels. Alfred then urged Edmund to continue patrolling the coasts to thwart Danish raids. Edmund's ship, the Dragon, encountered many Danish galleys laden with spoils from France. During a storm, the Dragon navigated perilous waters near the French coast, seeking refuge in Havre. Upon docking, armed men approached cautiously, but Edmund reassured them of their peaceful intentions. The governor welcomed them, expressing regret over the Viking raids plaguing Europe. Edmund shared his desire for a united front against the marauders, lamenting the widespread devastation caused by the pirates. The conversation turned to the need for a collective effort to combat the common enemy and protect the lands from further plunder.|"['1.

The next morning, Edmund, who had slept on his ship, was woken by loud shouts on deck. Rushing out, he saw a large fleet of ships approaching the river mouth. The ships varied in size, from massive sailing ships to rowing galleys. A quick glance confirmed they were the feared Northmen's ships, marked by the Black Raven on many mast-heads. From the town, horns blared and shouts rose as the fleet came into view. With no time to escape by sea, Edmund and his kinsman decided to head upriver to Paris, the capital, seeking refuge from the approaching Danish threat. They swiftly set sail, leaving the pursuing Danish ships behind. Reaching Rouen, they found chaos and a council discussing whether to resist the Danes or surrender. Edmund's news of the Danish fleet at the river mouth sealed their decision to head to Paris where they hoped for safety.|"[""Question 1: What woke Edmund up on his ship the next morning?\nA) The sound of horns blaring from the town\nB) The council discussing whether to resist the Danes or surrender\nC) The loud shouts on deck\nD) The sight of the Northmen's ships approaching\nE) The chaos in Rouen"", ""Question 2: How did Edmund confirm that the approaching fleet was the Northmen's ships?\nA) By seeing the chaos in Rouen\nB) By hearing the horns blaring from the town\nC) By noticing the council discussing the situation\nD) By spotting the Black Raven on many mast-heads\nE) By observing the ships varying in size"", 'Question 3: Why did Edmund and his kinsman decide to head upriver to Paris?\nA) To join the council in Rouen\nB) To escape by sea\nC) To surrender to the Danes\nD) To seek refuge from the approaching Danish threat\nE) To resist the Danes', ""Question 4: What sealed the council's decision to head to Paris?\nA) The chaos in Rouen\nB) The news of the Danish fleet at the river mouth\nC) The sight of the Northmen's ships\nD) The horns blaring from the town\nE) The approaching Danish ships"", 'Question 5: What did the fleet approaching the river mouth consist of?\nA) Rowing galleys only\nB) Sailing ships only\nC) Ships marked by the Black Raven\nD) Ships of all sizes\nE) Ships heading to Paris', 'Question 6: Where did Edmund and his kinsman leave the pursuing Danish ships behind?\nA) Paris\nB) Rouen\nC) The river mouth\nD) On their ship\nE) The council discussing the situation']"|['C) The loud shouts on deck', 'D) By spotting the Black Raven on many mast-heads', 'D) To seek refuge from the approaching Danish threat', 'B) The news of the Danish fleet at the river mouth', 'D) Ships of all sizes', 'C) The river mouth']
My name is Edmund. I am a nobleman of King Alfred of the Saxons. While battling the Northmen at sea, a storm blew me along your coast, and I sought refuge in the harbor of Havre. Recently, a large Northmen fleet entered the river. We rowed to Rouen hoping for shelter, but the citizens, aware of the impending attack, surrendered upon my news. We have come here seeking to assist the Franks against our common enemy, the Danish invaders. Count Eudes welcomed us, acknowledging the dire situation. He offered his support and shelter, inviting us to stay at the castle. A banquet was arranged where we shared our tales.

The stream's entrance was widened and lined with grass, bushes, and stakes. The group sailed back to Paris on boats towed by the Dragon. Before their journey, they secured captured treasures in the castle and later sold them in the city. Soon after, news arrived of a massive Northmen fleet approaching Paris. The citizens, alarmed by the sight of hundreds of ships, prepared for defense. King Siegfroi of the Danes requested a meeting with the Archbishop of Paris. Siegfroi, adorned in gold armor, and his warriors arrived, seeking permission to pass through the city peacefully. However, the Archbishop, loyal to Emperor Charles, refused, citing his duty to protect the city. The tense encounter between the Archbishop and the Danes unfolded in the palace chamber.|"['1.

In the historical battle between the Norsemen and the French, Siegfroi made a solemn vow before the impending siege. The Norsemen threatened the city with darts and poisoned arrows, promising hunger and ruin. As the Norsemen attacked, the French defenders, led by Eudes and Abbe Ebble, bravely resisted. The walls, though not as strong as later fortifications, were fiercely defended. The Norsemen relentlessly worked to breach the walls, but the French fought back valiantly. After a night of intense fighting, the French reinforced the tower with makeshift fortifications. The next day, the Norsemen resumed their assault, but the French defenders, despite being outnumbered, held their ground. Abbe Ebble's heroic actions stood out, as he fought off the attackers. The battle raged on, with both sides suffering heavy losses, but the French resilience prevailed against the Norsemen's onslaught.|['1.

The fires set by the Danes on the fortification were extinguished by a sudden storm, giving hope to the defenders of Paris. The Danes, after losing three hundred men, withdrew temporarily. Meanwhile, they constructed three large towers on wheels to breach the city walls. Edmund devised a plan to destroy the towers using boats filled with combustibles. Under the cover of darkness, Edmund and his band floated down the river, boarded the Danish ships, and set them on fire. The flames from the burning ships surprised the Danes, who were feasting and sleeping, leading to their defeat. The citizens of Paris were unaware of the plan until they saw the towers in flames.

The Saxons were thrilled to hear about the upcoming expedition. They were eager to retaliate against the Danes after being unable to join the recent battles. The group prepared wine skins as floats and armed themselves with spears and swords. Under the cover of night, they set out towards the Danish camp across the river. The dark night and rain provided them with the perfect cover. Stripping down to avoid the cold, they floated down the stream towards the enemy camp. After drifting downstream, they landed safely and changed into dry clothes. Edmund instructed his men to warm up before the attack. As they approached the Danish camp, Edmund and Egbert scouted ahead and observed the layout of the enemy ships.

The Saxons swiftly advanced and repeated their actions until all the vessels supporting the towers were adrift. The Danes on the lower ships became alarmed and shouted in wonder and anger. Nine Saxons in small boats rowed out, while the rest charged across planks to the platforms. The Danes, taken by surprise, were overpowered. The Saxons, with spears in hand, forced the Danes into the water and then defeated those below. Torches were used to set the ships ablaze. As the Danes rushed to the scene, the Saxons cut the ropes and rowed away. The uproar grew as flames engulfed the ships, causing chaos among the Northmen.

Edmund and his kinsman successfully destroyed the towers that threatened Paris, causing half of the Danish fleet to perish. Count Eudes hailed Edmund as the town's savior, praising his bravery. The sight of the fire-ships engulfing the fleet in flames was magnificent. Paris celebrated with bonfires and festivities, thanking Edmund and his Saxons for their heroic act. Despite the Danes' recovery and resumption of the assault a month later, the citizens rallied to defend the walls. The archbishop, along with the Counts and the valiant abbe, led the defense. Edmund and Egbert commanded the tower's defense, facing a fierce attack from the Danes. The defenders repelled the onslaught, using strategic archery to counter the enemy's assault.|"['1.

During the siege of Paris, Eudes and his men bravely defended the walls against the Danes. The defenders faced arrows, boiling liquids, and huge stones hurled by the attackers. The Danes tried to fill the moat but were met with resistance from the defenders' stone-throwing machines. The Danes then attempted to use fire-ships to destroy the bridge, but the defenders, led by the archbishop, prayed for protection. Miraculously, the fire-ships were thwarted by the bridge's structure. The Franks celebrated this as a victory and the Danes retreated. The defenders, including only twenty men, fought valiantly, even when outnumbered, and were able to repel the Danes' attacks.

The fire quickly spread from the gates to the wooden walls, engulfing the defenders. Edmund and Egbert, skilled swimmers, dove into the river to escape the Northmen's arrows. The flooded river concealed them from the enemy's sight, allowing them to reach safety. The citizens cheered their return to the town. The Abbe Ebble led a successful attack on the Danish camp, forcing the enemy to retreat. The Danes, facing a plague among their cattle, left the church in ruin. The valiant defense of Paris bought time for France to prepare. Henri's forces defeated the Danes and supplied Paris with provisions. Eudes bravely faced the Northmen, driving them back with Edmund's Saxon warriors. Despite heavy rain and rising waters, the Danes were forced to retreat, ending the siege.|"[""1.

During a time of pestilence in Paris, many prominent figures succumbed to the illness. On the 16th of April, a mock procession organized by the Northmen was thwarted when their wagon filled with grain could not be moved despite multiple attempts. St. Germain, a church figure, was said to have performed miracles, including shrinking a defiant Dane to the size of an infant. Another miracle saw a weakened warrior restored to full health by St. Germain. Further miraculous events included a man surviving a stone blow and a successful defense against the Danes with the help of St. Germain. With the city facing scarcity and plague, Count Eudes sought aid from King Charles. Meanwhile, Abbe Ebble and Edmund led successful raids against the Danes, keeping the garrison's spirits high.|"['1.

The additional soldiers triumphantly entered Paris over the repaired bridge, but the siege continued. Upon hearing of Eudes' victory, the Danes regrouped and launched a fierce attack on the city, using catapults and mangonels. The defenders were overwhelmed by the massive assault, causing fear and chaos. The relics of St. Genevieve were paraded along the walls as the Danes breached sections of the city. Women screamed in terror, bells tolled mournfully, and the Danes grew bolder. Edmund and Egbert led a daring charge, turning the tide of battle in favor of the Franks. The French believed a miracle had occurred as they joined the fight, driving the Danes into retreat. Reinforcements from Emperor Charles arrived, securing victory over the Danes. Negotiations led to the Danes leaving Paris for Burgundy, only to return later. A treaty was broken, leading to more conflict, but ultimately peace was restored under Eudes' leadership.|"[""1.

Edmund and Egbert weren't involved in the second siege of Paris. Once relieved by Emperor Charles, they got ready to leave. They found the Dragon safe in its hiding spot after nearly a year. It was repaired and redecorated in Paris by Count Eudes' order. The Franks, grateful for the Saxons' bravery, showered them with gifts. Edmund's horn signaled the crew to board the Dragon. Edmund learned that Siegbert was wounded and his daughter Freda possibly abducted. Edmund, deeply concerned, hurried to Siegbert's side. He had always planned to find Freda again. Despite many potential Saxon brides, Freda had captured his heart. Edmund believed he could guide her to Christianity. He rushed to Siegbert's village upon hearing of Freda's disappearance. Edmund found Siegbert wounded but relieved to see him. Siegbert had heard of Edmund's heroic deeds in Paris.|"['1.

The leader Edmund was recognized by his name shouted in battle and his daring escape from a burning tower. Siegbert, wounded and unable to walk, seeks Edmund's help to rescue his daughter Freda from Sweyn, a viking who seeks to claim her against her will. Sweyn, known for his valor, had been rejected by Freda, leading to a conflict with Siegbert. Now, Freda has been abducted by Sweyn, and Siegbert implores Edmund to help. Sweyn's band consists of six ships with fifty men each, and their whereabouts are unknown. Siegbert warns Edmund of the dangers posed by other Danes in the region and advises against traveling with a large group to avoid conflict.

"""I believe Sweyn will not resort to violence to make Freda his wife,"" Siegbert remarked. ""Kidnapping a maiden for marriage is not uncommon, but forcing her against her will goes against our customs and would anger the nation. Sweyn may consider taking her away by ship to a distant land as a last resort. However, he will likely try to wear her down until she agrees to wed him out of despair.""

After leaving the cottage, Edmund updated Egbert on the situation. They discussed the plan to rescue Freda. Edmund suggested taking only a small group disguised as Danes to avoid detection. He planned to have two of Siegbert's men gather information on Sweyn's actions. Egbert proposed that Edmund command the Dragon while he sails to strategic locations to await messages about Sweyn's movements. If Sweyn's ship is identified, they will take action to rescue Freda.

Siegbert advised Edmund wisely, acknowledging that force wouldn't work against the Saxons. Siegbert explained that most of his followers left after he was injured, leaving only ten men with him. Edmund decided to take two of Siegbert's men, one to spy and the other to pose as a leader if needed. Edmund carefully selected four of his own men, all strong fighters, to join the mission. They disguised themselves in Danish attire to blend in. The group quickly prepared to depart, with Egbert providing valuable information. Edmund learned Sweyn had moved towards Champagne. The journey began, encountering groups of Danes on the way. Despite the risks, they pressed on towards their goal, hoping to rescue Freda and reunite her with Siegbert.

They avoided towns and large Danish camps, asking about Sweyn's whereabouts. They found his deserted camp but no one knew where he went. Edmund and his group searched the area in different directions but found no trace. Sweyn might have gone south to cross mountains to the Rhine or north through the Ardennes forest to reach rivers flowing to the North Sea. They decided to search through the forest, gather information from locals about nearby rivers, split into groups, and set a rendezvous point. They stocked up on provisions before entering the vast Ardennes forest. They were cautious due to the presence of French refugees and traveled on foot after selling their horses. They moved silently, avoiding encounters, and after six days emerged from the forest, reaching a cottage.|['1.

The villager was shocked and amazed by the arrival of seven Danes, but he soon realized they sought information about the rivers, not harm. Edmund, after gathering details, deduced Sweyn's plan to descend via the Moselle or Maas rivers. Choosing to follow the Maas, Edmund took a Dane and two Saxons, while the others searched the Moselle. Disguised as locals, they set out, leaving their old attire behind. They reached the river, hearing axe sounds nearby. Edmund was thrilled, suspecting they found Sweyn's shipbuilding site. Proceeding cautiously, they spotted the Northmen working on galleys. They retreated, planning to camp by the river. Edmund's group built a hidden shelter and awaited the return of the Saxons with provisions, preparing for further investigations the next evening.|"['1.

Edmund was anxious to gather information but knew it was best for the Northman to go alone. In the fading light, the Northman's features would be hidden, and he could listen unnoticed. Siegbert had praised the Northman's cunning, and Edmund trusted him to gather intel. From his hiding spot, Edmund watched as the Northman entered the clearing and sat by a fire with other Danes. When they all slept, the Northman quietly left. He returned to Edmund, sharing that Lady Freda was a captive but determined. Sweyn planned a long voyage to the Mediterranean, causing concern for Freda's safety. Edmund decided to rally against the Danes, but the people feared them. Despite the potential riches in the Danes' camp, the villagers were hesitant to act. The news of the Danes building ships and leaving for the sea brought relief to the villagers.|"[""1.

Edmund's plan to seek help in the town of Liege was met with skepticism and suspicion. The council of the town refused to send men to attack the Northmen and decided to defend themselves within the walls. Disheartened by the lack of support, Edmund sent messengers to his friend Egbert, asking for assistance. He then purchased a fast rowing-skiff and, with his remaining followers, rowed up the river towards the Northmen's camp. After days of rowing, they reached the forest edge and prepared to approach the Northmen's galleys. Edmund observed the progress on the galleys and realized they were built for speed. Concerned that they might outpace his own ship, the Dragon, he strategized on how to catch them. As they watched, a tall maiden emerged from a hut, catching Edmund's attention.

"Freda did not try to avoid her captor but stayed calm until he neared her. They talked for a while before she went back into her hut. Sweyn watched her leave and then, frustrated, returned to the galleys. ""I wish I could warn her that I'm here and will save her from Sweyn,"" said Edmund. The next day, disguised in Danish clothes, Edmund hid near the hut. When Freda came out later, Edmund approached her boldly. He assured her of his presence and plan to rescue her. The guards interrupted, but Edmund escaped into the woods. The Danes were puzzled by the encounter. Freda informed Sweyn that Edmund was a messenger from her wounded father, promising rescue.

"Freda paused before responding. Although the chance of being rescued seemed remote, she decided to offer Sweyn a glimmer of hope that she might change her mind in the future. ""I have always been clear, jarl, that I will never marry you, and I doubt that will ever change. Perhaps the sunny skies you mention could alter my feelings, but we shall see,"" she said. Satisfied with her less confrontational tone, Sweyn left. Unaware of her father's message, he dismissed it. Three days later, the galleys set sail after preparations. While rowing downstream, they encountered a boat speeding past them, ignoring their calls to stop. Sweyn was annoyed, realizing they had missed chances to resupply. Villages were deserted as they passed, and when they reached Liege, the gates were shut. Sweyn sought provisions for their voyage, avoiding unnecessary conflict. Eventually, they halted near the sea, gathering supplies after skirmishes with locals.

Edmund assured his companion that Freda was safe and determined not to marry Sweyn by force. They discussed their risky journey on the Dragon ship to find Freda. As they awaited Sweyn's galleys, Freda overheard his plan to avoid a confrontation due to the Saxon ship's reputation for speed and skill in battle. Sweyn ordered his men to use the incoming sea-fog as cover to drift past the Dragon unnoticed. Freda, hoping for rescue, felt her hopes fade as the fog obscured their chances.|"['1.

Edmund and the Saxons were alarmed by the approaching sea fog. They quickly rowed towards the Danish vessels, hoping the fog would help them sneak up unnoticed. As they listened for any signs of the Danes, a woman's voice was heard in the distance. The Dragon turned towards the voice but ran aground due to the falling tide. After hours of waiting for the tide to rise, they floated again but were still surrounded by dense fog. Edmund and Siegbert were disappointed by the Danes' escape. Egbert suspected the Danes recognized them and fled. Edmund decided to sail out to sea despite the fog. They drifted cautiously, dropping anchor as the tide turned. The next morning, the fog lifted, revealing the coast. They rowed westward, determined to catch up to the Danish galleys despite the unfavorable winds.|['1.

They had not yet spotted the galleys, and it was disheartening to know that these ships were likely catching up to them each day. The galleys, even without wind, could row faster than their ship, the Dragon, especially with a full crew rowing. Against the wind, the galleys would have a significant advantage as they could maneuver swiftly while the Dragon struggled. The crew, led by Edmund, decided to head towards the mouth of the Thames to wait for the wind to change. They aimed to intercept the galleys as they entered the Mediterranean by sailing west to the tip of England, then south along the coast of Spain. After a fortnight delay due to unfavorable winds, a change in the wind direction allowed them to set sail towards Spain. They encountered friendly natives along the way, traded for supplies, and anchored near the straits, ready to confront the approaching galleys.|['1.

Edmund gazed across the straits at the hills on the opposite side, wishing the passage was narrower. Sweyn's ship might have sailed ahead with experienced men, making progress faster. Edmund feared Sweyn might have already passed. Determined to reach Rome to find Hasting's fleet, they sailed east. The wind veered southeast, altering their course. They coasted along Spain, stopping at ports but unable to communicate. In Marseilles, they hired a pilot and learned of Hasting's raids in Provence and Italy. The Danes were now in Sicily, threatening Rome. Edmund sought help in Genoa, impressed by the city's splendor. The crew's strength amazed the Genoese, who offered hospitality. Edmund, after a brief stay, continued the voyage with three Genoese nobles joining the crew.|"[""1.

Edmund agreed to the request, knowing the utility of his presence in various ports where the Dragon might stop. In Genoa, he got clothes for his men resembling Italian soldiers' attire. He sold valuable items taken from the Danes and gifts from Count Eudes and Parisians. The Dragon looked like Genoese galleys, and Edmund planned to pass as one near the Northmen to avoid alerting Sweyn. They anchored at the Tiber's mouth and stayed in a grand palace with Genoese nobles. The Pope invited them after learning they were Saxons, praising their bravery in Paris. He wished to help against the Northmen and offered some ships. Edmund aimed to disguise the Dragon as a Genoese vessel to pursue a Danish damsel taken by Vikings. The ship was transformed into a Genoese galley, and they set sail for Palermo, seeking to gather information on Sweyn's fleet.|"[""1.

Edmund and his group quickly set out to return to the Dragon after gathering the needed information. The Dragon swiftly sailed off once they reached her. Passing Palermo during the night, the ship continued along Sicily's western coast. To avoid detection by Danish galleys, they anchored each night. Soon after passing Palermo, they spotted several galleys near a small port. With light winds, Edmund decided to pretend to flee, hoping to lure the Danes into chasing them. The group learned that Sweyn was ashore at the Count of Ugoli's mansion. The people in the area were rebelling against the Danes, and the situation was tense. Edmund planned to scout the area and possibly negotiate with the locals. The group disguised themselves as Danes and landed near the town to assess the situation under cover of darkness.|"['1.

"""The Danes, known as the sea-wolves, are feared for their destructive ways,"" Edmund stated. ""They plunder not just for gain but for the joy of causing harm. Why does Europe allow these raiders to roam freely?"" The Genoese, after the interpreter conveyed Edmund's words, echoed the sentiment. ""It is a shame that Christendom does not unite against them,"" he added. ""Italy alone could clear the seas of their pirate ships if only our cities could set aside their rivalries."" Amidst their discussion, an attack ensued. Peasants wielding weapons emerged from the woods, mistaking the group for Danes. Despite attempts to clarify their identity, the three men found themselves in a fierce battle. The Genoese's display of a cross, signifying their Christian faith, momentarily halted the onslaught.

The prisoners were cared for by the peasants, with the Count of Ugoli realizing the mistake. The Count instructed the peasants to help the prisoners, who were really Christians and friends, to recover. Wine was given to Edmund to quench his thirst. The peasants tended to their wounds and revived them with care. The Genoese recovered first and explained their presence and plans to the Count. Edmund, feeling better the next morning, set off to reconnoiter the town. He sneaked in at night, avoiding Danish guards. He found a grand mansion with Danes feasting inside.

In the distance, lights suddenly appeared at several points, and faint cries could be heard. The lights grew brighter, flames shot up, and guards shouted outside. Startled, some revellers went to the windows and saw fires in the outskirts. Sweyn, realizing they were under attack, ordered a horn to sound for assembly. Oderic led the women to safety on the galleys. Sweyn and the Danes rushed to the town's outskirts, finding the peasants had withdrawn after a brief fight.

After discussing various plans, they decided to rescue Freda immediately. They believed Sweyn and his men would seek revenge at daybreak. The plan was to sail along the shore and attack the Danish galleys if they didn't pursue. Despite the Danes' superior numbers, the group thought success was possible due to surprise. The Dragon set sail the next morning, luring the Danes into pursuit. As the Danes closed in, the Saxons ambushed them. A fierce battle ensued, with the Saxons gaining the upper hand until more Danish reinforcements arrived. Despite the odds, the Saxons fought bravely against Sweyn's men.

Sweyn led his men in a fierce attempt to push back Edmund's group. However, his men fought with less courage than usual. They were shocked to find the ship, which they thought would be an easy target, manned by Saxons. Seeing Siegbert, whom many of them knew, fighting with the enemy, added to their confusion. Sweyn, upon recognizing Edmund, attacked him with a heavy axe. Edmund, skilled as he was, struggled to defend against the Northman's strikes. The battle took a turn when Siegbert threw his javelin at Sweyn, piercing his body. Disheartened by their leader's fall, the Northmen hesitated and fled to another galley as the Saxons pursued. The Saxons quickly rowed away, leaving the Danes behind. Later, Freda embraced her father, Siegbert, reuniting with him.

A few days later, the Dragon sailed back to sea and reached England without any trouble due to good weather. Edmund's return home was celebrated with joy. The Dragon's involvement in defending Paris had been heard of in England, but her fate was unknown. After months without news, it was assumed she was lost. Upon Edmund's return with Freda, Alfred happily welcomed her as his bride. Alfred stayed at Sherborne for three days before leaving Edmund in charge of his earldom. The Dragon's successful plunder enriched all aboard and improved prosperity in Edmund's region. Alfred had made changes in Edmund's absence, introducing judges for fairer justice. Edmund approved, as it avoided partiality. In 884, Alfred learned of possible Danish disturbances and ordered preparation for conflict. Edmund was appointed to lead a fleet against the Danes. The winter of 884 was spent preparing for the invasion that took place in May 885 near Rochester. The Saxons valiantly defended the town, forcing the Danes to retreat.
