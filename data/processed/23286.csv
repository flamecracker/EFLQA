"""Come on, friends, let's move those boxes to their proper places!"" shouted Jack. Leading the way, he lifted a packing case, and the rest quickly followed suit. They marched out, leaving Codfish puzzled. ""I don't have anything!"" he claimed. Suddenly, he grabbed his overcoat from a box, reaching into a pocket and pulling back in pain. Meanwhile, the school sneak danced around, trying to shake off a snapping turtle. The turtle clung on tightly, causing panic. Codfish, scared, held the turtle away, asking for help. ""Let it swim in a bathtub,"" suggested Randy. The janitor, Plunger, accidentally collided with Codfish, causing chaos. Plunger demanded Codfish pick up magazines, warning him to be careful.

The cartons were quickly placed on the bonfires, and the boys joined the other students for a fun time. They sang, danced, and had an impromptu parade along the riverfront. After discussing, Jack, Fred, Spouter, and Gif decided to rush to Haven Point for goodies. They collected eight dollars for the feast and headed to town. Using a truck, they reached the stores fast, buying chicken salad, sandwiches, cakes, ginger snaps, soda, and ice-cream. They spotted a man with a car, the owner of a theater, who gladly offered his chauffeur to drive them back to school. The boys sneaked the treats into their rooms as the celebration wound down.

Ned reassured everyone that Codfish was on board and content after the celebration. They needed to stay quiet to avoid trouble. The cadets devoured the treats quickly, but singing was off-limits. Spouter was thrilled to give a speech, praising the baseball team's recent victory. Suddenly, a telegram arrived for Jack, announcing that Uncle Sam and his dad had joined the army with commissions. Jack shared the news with his friends, and they were proud of their family's decision to serve. Uncle Tom would handle business matters, and Colonel Colby would provide more information. Randy felt his dad, who never became an officer at Putnam Hall, would relish the chance to fight the enemy.|"['1.

"Andy responded, ""All right,"" before expressing confusion as to why his dad did not volunteer like Uncle Dick and Uncle Sam. Jack and Fred quickly freshened up and headed to Colonel Colby's residence. They found the night watchman on duty. The colonel lived a distance away, and the boys saw a light in his library. They knocked and excitedly presented a telegram, eager for details. Jack was surprised to hear that Hans Mueller, a German-American acquaintance, volunteered. Colonel Colby explained that Mueller joined the heavy artillery. The colonel also shared that Andy's father, Uncle Tom, would stay behind to manage the family business and oversee the kids.

Jack mentioned that they would receive more information in a day or two, as the telegram was more of an icebreaker. It was now their responsibility to inform Mary and Martha. Spouter and Gif left the room, leaving the four Rover boys to discuss the situation for an additional hour. Jack and Fred felt the weight of their fathers joining the army during the ongoing war, knowing they might soon be sent to France to confront the enemy. Mary expressed pride in her father's decision not to be seen as a slacker and to contribute to the war effort locally. The group decided to wait for further updates before taking any action. The girls shared the news with Miss Garwood and their friends, while the boys headed back to Colby Hall. They recounted a comical incident involving a snapping turtle at the school, adding a lighter mood to their day amidst the serious news about the explosion at the Hasley Shell-Loading plant. The boys read about the accident in the local papers, discovering that while there were injuries, no fatalities had occurred.|"['1.

An intense investigation began involving three groups: the plant owners, local authorities, and the national government's Secret Service. Suspicions arose that the explosions were caused by spies or suspicious individuals seen near the plant. Meanwhile, after a victory, some cadets encountered former troublemakers, Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell, in town. The Rovers were concerned about their presence. Later, Jack and Fred received letters from their fathers, who volunteered for service in France. The fathers were soon departing for Camp Huxwell, joined by old friends. Jack and Fred, along with their sisters, embarked on a train journey to New York City. During a meal on the train, Fred noticed something alarming at the other end of the dining car.|"['1.

Andy and Randy, along with their friends, noticed Brown and Martell approaching in the dining car. Martell began staring at Martha, which made her uncomfortable. Jack, Martha's brother, warned Martell to stop or face consequences. Martell heeded the warning and focused on his own meal. The group arrived at Grand Central Terminal in New York City, where they were greeted by their mothers with cars. The young group was driven to their families' homes. Concerned about their uncles joining the army, Andy suggested finding someone to run their business. However, their uncles explained that with important deals at stake, they couldn't risk losing money. Despite the uncertainty of war, they needed to ensure their business remained stable.|"['1.

The young folks were hungry when they got home and enjoyed their mothers' cooking. Mrs. Tom Rover returned from meeting her husband, who was busy with Liberty Loan work. He was asked to speak at meetings and guide bankers on the loan. Mr. Rover felt overwhelmed by the responsibilities and the need to trust someone to manage their business deals while they were away. He considered Mr. Allen Charter and Stanley Browne, but both were unavailable. Tom Rover sighed heavily, feeling left behind as his family and friends joined the war effort.

A group of volunteers gathered at the train station, bidding farewell to friends and family. The Rovers exchanged handshakes and hugs before boarding the train. As the train departed, a somber atmosphere settled among those left behind. Even Andy and Randy were subdued, with Martha appearing the most affected. The annual encampment of Colby Hall students was discussed, where cadets experience military life through drills, marches, and a thrilling sham battle. The Rover Company's bustling office on the fourth floor was described, with the brothers' private offices and the employees' busy workspace. The boys visited their father's office, where they overheard a conversation between Mr. Brown, Slugger, and others. Andy discreetly signaled the boys to stay out of sight, avoiding detection as they left the building.|"['1.

The two strangers, appearing around forty years old, were tall and stout with clean-shaven faces and sandy hair. Andy felt uneasy due to their shifty, snake-like eyes. As they approached the Martell offices, they heard muffled voices mentioning supplies, canned goods, machinery, and cash payments. Nelson Martell discussed an advance of a thousand dollars. The boys then saw Nappy Martell and Slugger Brown exit an office. Randy inquired about his father, but the clerk confirmed he hadn't been there. The boys left, spotting the strangers hurrying away. Tom Rover suspected Nelson Martell's shady dealings and decided to investigate further with the Secret Service. It was wise to keep an eye on these suspicious men.|"['1.

After finishing work, Tom Rover and his sons headed back to Riverside Drive. That evening, the twins' father had plans, leaving the boys with their mothers and sisters at home. The next day, at the railroad terminal, Jack informed the group that due to military shipments, they would need to change trains twice to reach Haven Point. Despite the absence of a dining car, the young travelers managed to sit together. At a small village called Raymonton, they had a short break for lunch in a modest eatery. The Irish waitress served them sandwiches, cake, pie, and hot chocolate. The girls browsed postcards while the boys observed Asa Lemm, a troublesome figure from their past, causing a scene before leaving empty-handed. The newsstand owner shared his own unpleasant encounter with Lemm, highlighting the man's difficult nature.|['1.

Shortly after, the driver of the auto-stage honked his horn to signal the impending departure. Instantly, a group of individuals dashed from different directions towards the stage to board. Asa Lemm was the last to arrive, holding a valise and a bundle, standing at the back waiting for his turn to get on. The newsstand resembled many others, with rows of magazines clipped to wires. Andy slyly unhooked one end of the wire, signaling his twin to do the same. With mischievous intent, Andy looped the wire around Asa Lemm's coat button, causing a commotion as the stage began to move.

Randy reminded the group of a past incident involving a swindle on Snowshoe Island, highlighting a lack of sympathy for a character. The journey to Haven Point was uneventful, with the boys and girls arriving at Colby Hall. They split up, with the girls heading one way and the boys the other. Concerns arose about their father not joining them due to military service. The students received news of their academic performance and prepared for military training at Camp Huxwell under Captain Dale's leadership. Elections for student officers were announced, emphasizing the importance of experience at Colby Hall for holding positions of authority.

Gabe Werner's desire to be Company C's captain was evident. He felt entitled to the position and made it known to his friends. Despite his laziness, he understood the need to work hard for it. To gain support, he treated thirty cadets to a movie and dinner. Meanwhile, Dan Soppinger, initially uninterested, was persuaded by friends to run. When the votes were counted, a tie emerged between Gabe and Jack Rover. However, a discrepancy was found in the number of votes cast. It was revealed that some cadets had voted more than once.

Randy retired early and woke around half-past eleven at night. He dressed, grabbed some hot chocolate prepared for the sentries, and joined the guard detail from midnight until 4 a.m. The post he took over from Ned Lowe was on the far side of the camp near cliffs overlooking the bay. It was a lonely night with overcast skies and moaning winds. Randy patrolled his post slowly, meeting other guards at each end. One guard, Codfish, seemed scared and avoided walking close to the trees. As it started to rain, Randy put on his raincoat, only to see someone stealing it. Convinced it was Werner or Glutts, Randy chased after the figure and struck them with his gun. As the rain passed, the morning stars appeared, signaling the end of Randy's watch.

The cadets quickly reached the spot where Randy had seen the two strangers. Surprisingly, they found a faint trail leading north and south through the forest. Following the path was challenging, weaving among trees and bushes, and sometimes over rough rocks. They stumbled upon a steel bar that appeared to be part of an airplane. Carrying the bar, they continued along the trail to a larger path with wagon tracks and horse hoofs. The road led to rocks overlooking Barlight Bay. Returning, they found themselves on the highway they had marched to camp on. Despite searching for footprints, they found none. Local authorities and a Secret Service agent examined the steel bar.

Fred was puzzled as he approached the flat rocks, expecting to find their knapsacks and wraps left behind. To his surprise, they were nowhere in sight.

The girls approached in a group, curious about the commotion. After a quick check, it was clear that Werner and his friends hadn't caused any trouble. Werner grumbled about not being able to control everything, but due to the girls' presence, they let it go for now. The encounter dampened the mood temporarily, but they soon forgot and returned to the cliffs. The boys let the girls set up while they made a fire and prepared chocolate. Everyone enjoyed the outing, but it eventually came to an end. The boys looked for Werner later, but he and his group avoided them. The next morning, the Rovers, along with Gif and Spouter, headed to Camp Huxwell to meet the girls. Soldiers were seen practicing maneuvers in the distance, creating a military atmosphere. The group eventually found Dick and Sam, and a pleasant surprise awaited Andy and Randy: their father was on his way.

On a quiet Sunday, the Rover boys and their friends spent the day attending open-air religious services. Fred and Jack went for a walk with Gif and Spouter while the twins stayed back to write letters. During their walk, they discovered a cavern near the water's edge, with nesting birds as the only inhabitants. While exploring, they heard mysterious sounds and encountered Gabe Werner tampering with tent ropes. Jack swiftly confronted Werner, leading to a scuffle as a storm approached, causing chaos in the camp. Meanwhile, Gif dealt with Bill Glutts cutting tent ropes in another part of the camp, resulting in a commotion among the cadets.|"[""1.

Captain Dale went down to the bay shore to check the tent ropes and prevent them from blowing away. He found Werner had tampered with them and endangered the campers. Upset, Captain Dale ordered Werner to report to the guard. Concerned about the storm, he inspected all tent fastenings and ensured extra ropes were secure. Bill Glutts and Werner faced consequences for their actions. Jack intervened in a fight involving a pocketknife, leading to Werner leaving camp.

Spouter noticed the lack of progress in the investigation of the explosion at the Hasley Shell Loading plant. The boys, including the Rovers, went for a swim and heard a strange knocking sound underwater. They decided to investigate and encountered a man with a mustache carrying a bundle. The man disappeared suddenly, leading the boys to believe he might have entered a hidden cave. They marked the spot and continued through the forest until they reached a gully with an overhanging cliff. Using a flashlight, they ventured into the cave-like opening cautiously, unsure of what they might find.|['1.

As they descended the rocky path, a sudden rumbling filled the air, startling each cadet. The sound of blowing, hissing, pounding, and clanking echoed around them in the confined space. Uncertain of what awaited them, the boys continued down into the opening. Eventually, they reached a damp passageway, leading to an underground pond. On one side, a sandy slope, on the other, jagged rocks. Around a bend, they spotted bright electric lights, machinery, and busy workers. Fred connected the workers to the mysterious duo seen near the ammunition plant. Andy speculated that the submarine might have encountered trouble from warships or rocks. Jack suggested the strange noises came from the underground or nearby. The cadets planned to inform Captain Dale and authorities promptly. Observing the workers' activities, they strategized their next steps cautiously, aware of the ongoing noises from the submarine.|"['1.

Andy, Randy, and Spouter were tasked with returning to Camp Barlight promptly to inform Captain Dale of their findings. Meanwhile, Jack, Fred, and Gif remained vigilant in case the Germans attempted any sudden movements. The group suspected the Germans were preparing to depart but were curious about the other end of the passageway. As the twins and Spouter left to report to Captain Dale, Jack and his companions observed the Germans, heavy-set individuals who spoke in German. The Germans worked on the submarine for nearly an hour, causing a racket that eventually ceased, leaving an eerie silence in the cavern. The Germans emerged from the submarine, changed into street clothes, and the cavern grew dim as most lights were turned off. Fred speculated that the entrance was underwater, explaining why the location remained hidden for so long. The group noticed the smell of gasoline and the distant sound of waves breaking nearby.|['1.

The three cadets waited for ten more minutes, but seeing no one around the deserted submarine, they cautiously moved closer. Eager to explore the U-boat, they crept up to where the Germans had their repair station. Some equipment lay scattered, while other parts had been taken inside the submarine. With curiosity driving them, they crossed the gangplank and peered down the hatch, revealing a lit interior below with a steel ladder leading down. Jack descended first, followed by the others, entering the main chamber with various compartments. They observed ongoing repairs and supplies being loaded. Suddenly, a stern German voice startled them, ordering them to surrender. The cadets quickly fled the scene, navigating the rocky terrain and reaching a split in the land, leading to a road where they debated which way to go to return to camp.|"['1.

While the young cadets were discussing their next move, they stumbled upon a surprising find. Wisps of smoke were rising from the trees nearby, leading them to discover a hidden cabin nestled among the foliage. One of the cadets expressed suspicion, believing that the occupants of the cabin might be in cahoots with the Germans they were investigating. As they cautiously approached the cabin, they noticed two young men seated in a car nearby, engaged in a hushed conversation. The cadets overheard mentions of Mr. Brown and Mr. Martell's involvement with the Germans, discussing supplies and machinery related to a mysterious submarine affair. The cadets decided to stay hidden, observing the cabin closely as they listened to a conversation inside involving Nelson Martell and others, hinting at a pending transaction.|['1.

A few more words passed before Mr. Brown and Mr. Martell emerged from the cabin to find Slugger and Nappy in the touring car. They all set off, Slugger driving. As they headed towards camp, Randy suggested notifying Captain Dale to organize a surprise for Brown, Martell, and the Germans. Suddenly, the boys were confronted by an armed German who ordered them to surrender. Startled, they raised their hands as the German brandished his pistols. Seizing an opportunity, the boys overpowered the German and subdued him. They bound and gagged him before deciding to sabotage the submarine to prevent the Germans from escaping. After swiftly disarranging some machinery, they left the scene, ensuring the captured German couldn't alert his comrades.|"['1.

"""I will signal to them and find out!"" exclaimed Fred. Without waiting for the others to respond, the young lieutenant dashed over the rocks and through the brushwood towards the bay shore. Waving his handkerchief wildly and shouting, he caught the attention of the motor boat cruising close by. The boat, with three officers and a crew of eight aboard, drifted towards the shore where Fred stood. Upon landing, Fred saluted the officers and shared his story, leading them to where he left his friends and the prisoner. The officers revealed that they suspected a German base in the area and were on a mission to locate it. After a brief discussion, it was decided that the Secret Service men would take charge and sail to the nearest town for additional help. The group then set off towards the cabin where further developments were awaited. As the plan unfolded, soldiers surrounded Slugger and Nappy, surprising them and prompting a plea for mercy."|"['1.

In the main cabin room, an intense discussion unfolded between the German leader, the motorcyclist, Slogwell Brown, and Nelson Martell. Documents laid out on a table revealed a dispute over money, with the New Yorkers claiming over eleven thousand dollars owed, countered by the Germans insisting on less than ten thousand. Cash emerged from the motorcyclist's valise for Brown and Martell, who preferred it to checks. A confrontation escalated, with the Germans and the two men searched, disarmed, and handcuffed. Simultaneously, a Secret Service operation led by Mr. Blarcomb apprehended the U-boat's associates after a skirmish. The evildoers were subdued, the submarine and the workshop secured, and the culprits detained. Ruth expressed shock over the involvement of Martell and Brown's fathers, while Jed Kessler identified two culprits from the ammunition plant explosion. The reward was shared among the captors.
