In London, people usually dine around six or seven in the evening in their private parlors. One night, after dinner, Rollo's father, who was not feeling well, went to get a map and a railway guide. Rollo and his cousin Jennie watched from the table as their father planned the trip from London to Paris. They learned about different routes, train schedules, and costs. The English Channel separates England from France, and the shortest crossing is between Dover and Calais. Rollo's father, focused on his health, considered the most comfortable way to travel. Rollo, having successfully navigated a previous journey, was eager for another adventure. Eventually, it was decided that Rollo and his uncle George would travel to Paris together.|"[""1.

Rollo's uncle suggested reasons for taking the New Haven route, influenced by his past experiences. Rollo, having his own secret motive, knew the importance of presenting compelling reasons. Soon, Rollo's family discussed their travel plans. Mr. Holiday mentioned the late departure time from New Haven, but Rollo found excitement in the idea of setting out at midnight. Despite this, Mr. George thought the late departure would suit them well. Jennie, torn between adventure and staying with her mother, ultimately chose to sail at midnight with her parents. The next day, Rollo and Mr. George headed to New Haven. Upon arrival, Rollo explored the harbor, observing the ships and the water. He found a steamboat painted black and few people on board. Excited, he decided to wait to go on board until after dinner with Mr. George.|"[""1.

Rollo explored the pier briefly before entering the hotel. Inside, he walked through a grand hall and a passage with glass walls that offered a view of a large room. The room had shelves, tables, and desks where people moved about. It appeared to be the hotel's office. Rollo found a beautiful dining room with tables set for dinner, silverware, and glasses. Mr. George explained that Rollo's father would cover all travel expenses, allowing Rollo to keep any savings from frugal choices. Mr. George cautioned Rollo about potential accidents but assured him his father would cover such costs. He showed Rollo a large silver coin and explained the dining arrangements in Paris. Rollo burst into laughter at the thought of budgeting for brandy and cigars. Mr. George advised Rollo to be prudent with meal expenses to afford treats like cakes and candy abundant in Paris.|"['1.

Rollo and Mr. George sat down for dinner at a table with a silver tureen of soup between them. They put away their writing materials and purses to focus on their meal. Mr. Holiday had two reasons for letting Rollo handle his expenses. Firstly, it would make Rollo feel more independent and responsible. Secondly, Mr. Holiday wanted Rollo to learn about managing money early in life. Many young adults only learn about financial responsibility once they are older, often relying on their parents for money. Mr. George's straightforward approach may have seemed harsh, but Rollo appreciated being treated more like a young adult. After their meal, they went to explore the pier behind the hotel, where Mr. George contemplated the harbor and the ships docked there.|"[""1.

A young man, who appeared to be the boat clerk, came down the cabin stairs and asked Mr. George and Rollo if they had chosen their sleeping spots. The boat had cushions covered in crimson velvet for sleeping, with a long cushion for each sleeper and a round one for their head. Mr. George selected two spots for himself and Rollo, marked by the clerk. Afterward, they went back on deck and then to the pier. As they strolled along, they found a man in a boat offering to row them across the water. They accepted and explored the area on the other side. Mr. George had to return, but Rollo stayed behind, ensuring he kept his ticket safe. He enjoyed a walk by the smooth road alongside the harbor, taking in the views. When the evening approached, Rollo headed back to the ferry, where the ferryman took him back to the hotel. With three hours left before embarkation, Rollo was eager to explore the pier and its surroundings.

Intrigued by children speaking fluent French, Rollo listened attentively. As he lay in his berth, the soothing sounds around him led to a peaceful nap.

"""Thank you,"" said the clerk as he handed Rollo his ticket and replaced two others in his wallet. Rollo paid with a five-franc piece and received change, but found it confusing to count due to mix-ups between francs and shillings. He put the change in his purse, laid back down, and fell asleep. Upon waking, Rollo saw the coast of France from the deck as the steamer approached a town with piers and cliffs. The vessel entered a harbor with quaint buildings along the water, known as a quay. Passengers, including Mr. George, gathered on deck as the steamer docked. Soldiers secured the ship with ropes while customs officials prepared to process passengers through the custom house. The scene was a new experience for Rollo, observing the unique customs and architecture of the French port."|"['1.

"Mr. George and Rollo arrived at a custom-house in France where they needed to show their passports. A passport is a document that allows travelers to enter a country. The passengers lined up to have their passports checked by an officer who copied their names. Afterward, they exited the custom-house onto the quay. There, they saw an omnibus labeled ""For the Iron Road,"" which is the French term for a railroad. Despite the quiet atmosphere, everyone seemed to be waiting for something. Mr. George and Rollo were advised to have breakfast but decided to stay put. Soon, the sailors began unloading the trunks from the ship, and the passengers' baggage was examined.

In the bus sat a newly married couple, on their honeymoon journey. The lady, in plain but neat travel attire, carried a stylish leather bag. Her husband was burdened with shawls, boxes, and umbrellas, while the lady fretted over a trunk left behind, holding her fancy dresses. As they approached the station, the bus passed through a grand entrance guarded by a soldier. Inside, confusion reigned with partitions, signs, and timetables. The passengers disembarked, greeted by a bustling room filled with fellow travelers. Among them, Estelle stood worried about her trunk, constantly checking for its arrival. The ringing bell signaled the departure of the train, adding to the anxious atmosphere in the station.|"[""1.

Estelle was certain that English-speaking men were present due to the number of English travelers on the roads. She pointed out a man in livery within an enclosure. Mr. Charles, noticing another man in uniform, attempted to ask him a question. The porter's limited English led to an awkward exchange, leaving Mr. Charles embarrassed. Rollo and Uncle George observed the situation, with George expressing confidence in the French railway system. Estelle later rushed in joyfully, informing her husband that the cart with their trunks had arrived. The porters efficiently weighed the trunks, charging for any excess weight. Mr. Charles offered to accompany Estelle to the train, but she stayed to oversee her trunk. Rollo and George swiftly handled their trunks, receiving their checks promptly.

The man checked the ticket, noticing it was for first class. He gestured and spoke rapidly in French, leaving Rollo puzzled. Rollo followed the man's gesture, leading Mr. George to the waiting train. Attendants in unique uniforms checked Rollo's ticket and guided them to a first-class compartment. Each compartment resembled a large coach with two seats facing each other, accommodating four passengers. Rollo and Mr. George sat by the window as an Englishman read the London Times. Estelle and her husband later joined, causing Mr. George to express his discomfort with Estelle's behavior. The train departed, offering picturesque views of the countryside.

Suppose you're in a bustling city and step out of your hotel onto a long street. If you walk half a mile along that street, you could easily find your way back, right? Mr. George agrees, explaining that as long as you keep the route in mind, you won't get lost. But what if you reach a church, turn right, and wander down another street? Even then, you can still navigate your way back by remembering key landmarks. Mr. George shares a story of helping a lost girl in Paris who forgot her hotel's name. By staying cautious and aware of your surroundings, you can explore new cities without losing your way. As they approached Paris on a train, Rollo and Mr. George discussed the sights they'd see.

The train came to a stop, and an attendant opened the door. Mr. George and Rollo stepped out, amazed by the grandeur of the station. It was vast and splendid, bustling with people moving in all directions. Despite the crowds, there was order and no chaos. Carriages were neatly lined up, and the coachmen patiently waited for passengers. Baggage was carefully examined before entering Paris, with each passenger claiming their own belongings. Mr. George and Rollo easily retrieved their trunks after a brief inspection. They were then escorted to a carriage. The French are known for their expressive gestures and words. The journey to the hotel was swift, with Rollo catching a glimpse of a towering column before arriving at their destination. The hotel was welcoming, with a polite girl assisting them to their rooms.

Rollo went to church with his parents in the morning and returned home around one o'clock. He and his sister Jennie waited for their uncle George to arrive, who was out somewhere. While waiting, they sat by the window in their parlor, which had a strong iron bar to prevent them from falling out. They could see the Place Vendome square from the window, where a large column made entirely of brass, obtained by melting enemy cannons, stood. The column was adorned with bas-relief figures depicting battles. Rollo wondered about the gate and door at the base of the column, guarded by soldiers. At the top of the column was a statue of Napoleon, and people were visible on a small gallery around it.

At the base of the tall column and beyond the railing enclosing the pedestal, there was a wide, smooth area elevated like a sidewalk above the street. It served as a passage for people moving through the square from north to south. On the east and west sides, there were continuous rows of houses and palaces with soldiers guarding some doors marked by tricolored flags. Rollo and Jennie, intrigued by the surroundings, sought permission from their mother to take a walk. After consulting their fatigued father, who advised them on a safe route, the children were allowed to explore. They were instructed to head north towards the Street of Peace, a broad and beautiful street lined with trees, leading to the famous Boulevards encircling the city. These boulevards were distinctive for their grandeur and spacious sidewalks, ensuring the children could wander safely and return home easily.|['1.

Mr. Holiday instructed Rollo and Jennie to head south from Place Vendome, guiding them to the Grand Alley at the Tuileries garden. Rollo used a map to show Jennie the route, pointing out landmarks like the obelisk and the Grand Avenue. As they left the hotel, the children noticed elegant carriages and pedestrians. They encountered a man shining shoes and ladies with dogs, dispelling Jennie's notion that they were all blind. Approaching the garden entrance, they saw iron palisades and soldiers guarding the gates. Despite initial hesitation, they followed others into the garden, where they walked on a gravel terrace overlooking the street and a broad alley lined with orange trees in movable green boxes.|"['1.

The wide pathway, known as the Alley of the Oranges, led the children through the garden towards the center. Instead of the expected fruit and flower beds, they found themselves in a forest of trees neatly arranged in rows. As they walked, they glimpsed the Grand Alley in the distance, bustling with people strolling about. Rollo and Jane spotted children speaking fluent French and playing with hoops. After a brief rest on a stone bench in the Grand Alley, they continued their walk, marveling at the magnificent views around them. Eventually, they reached a large octagonal pond where children watched goldfish and sailed miniature ships. Feeling uneasy about engaging in such activities on the Sabbath, Rollo and Jennie decided to move on. Exiting the garden, they were met with grand buildings and bridges, signaling the end of their garden adventure and the beginning of a new chapter in the bustling square.|['1.

The square, though not empty, was a sight to behold. In the center stood an obelisk on a tall pedestal, surrounded by two grand fountains and colossal marble statues. The place was adorned with bronze and gilt columns for gaslights, smooth sidewalks made of artificial stone, and bustling roadways with carriages and horsemen passing through. The fountains were a marvel, with three towering basins stacked on top of one another. Water spouted from the top basin, cascading down into the middle basin, which overflowed into the lowest basin. Bronze figures of men holding fish spouted water into the middle basin. At the foot of the obelisk, the children marveled at its towering height, as tall as a steeple. Suddenly, they were surprised by the arrival of their uncle George and his American friend, who explained the engineering feat of the solid stone obelisk and its massive pedestal.|['1.

Mr. George explained the fascinating history of the obelisk to the students. The obelisk was not originally meant for its current location but was crafted in Egypt thousands of years ago. It was a challenging task to transport it to Paris. The French king sent a large team to dismantle and ship it. They constructed a special vessel for its transport and had to clear Arab huts and houses in its path. It took immense effort, with 800 men working for three months to move it to the river. The obelisk was carefully encased in wood to protect it during the journey. Once in Paris, it took nearly a year to set up the machinery to raise it onto a pedestal. The grand event attracted over a hundred thousand people, including the king and his family. The obelisk was adorned with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics, adding to its mystique.|"['1.

As the group continued their walk along the Grand Avenue, Mr. George suggested that they follow him and his friend up the avenue of the Elysian Fields to avoid getting lost in the bustling crowd. Jennie was relieved by the idea, feeling a bit overwhelmed by the increasing number of people around them. Rollo, however, felt a tinge of disappointment as he was confident in his ability to navigate with the Triumphal Arch in sight. Despite his initial reluctance, Rollo and Jennie followed their uncle and his friend. The Grand Avenue was wide and filled with carriages and horsemen, while side avenues were designated for pedestrians with rows of trees for shade. The children were captivated by the various sights and sounds, from a young boy on a pony distributing papers to a man selling stockings on the ground. As they walked, they encountered a boy baking griddle cakes and an elegant little omnibus drawn by goats, filled with joyous children enjoying their ride.|"[""1.

Jennie was thrilled with the omnibus, but what came next delighted her even more. A carriage, resembling a real one, was large enough for several children. It was open like a barouche, allowing the riders to see all around. Inside were two seats and a high one for the coachman in front and another for the footman at the back. The carriage, like the omnibus, was pulled by goats, four in this case. As the carriage passed, Rollo and Jennie searched for Mr. George and the other man to no avail. Nearby, a little girl read a card posted on a tree with a clear, silvery voice. She turned to Rollo and Jane after reading, smiling pleasantly. The square was bustling with booths selling cakes, toys like hoops and kites, and colorful pictures. A man with a can on his back sold drinks, using a bell to attract customers.|['1.

As Rollo and Jennie strolled along the avenue, they noticed a growing crowd all heading in one direction, which Rollo assumed was towards a church. Following a tip from his father, they joined the flow of people, a method they had practiced before and enjoyed as a little adventure. They decided to walk with a family ahead of them, a mother and father leading, followed by two children named Adrienne and Antoine. The kids chattered in French, captivating Rollo and Jennie. Along the way, they passed various amusements like an electrical shock machine and a miniature theater with dancing figures. Despite the distractions, Rollo and Jennie stayed focused on their goal, a church near the Triumphal Arch at the Neuilly Barrier, marveling at its grandeur as they approached.|['1.

Rollo and Jennie wanted to explore the arch longer, but they stuck with Adrienne and Antoine, who were heading to the Hippodrome, not a church as Rollo assumed. The Hippodrome, like the Coliseum in Rome, is an oval arena with rows of seats rising around it. Balloons couldn't fly if there was a roof, plus the open space enhances the shows. The central area has a hidden water canal covered with planks, canvas, and sand for horse-riding acts. There are horse troops, girl riders, chariot races, and pony races with monkeys. The Hippodrome can hold ten thousand spectators, and Adrienne's family, including Rollo and Jennie, were going there. They mistakenly thought it was a church. At the entrance, Adrienne's father bought tickets, including full price for his kids, leading to a mix-up where they all entered together.|"['1.

Rollo and Jane were swept by the current to a section of seats and settled in, taking in the grand and spacious interior. The area was vast, with elegant arrangements of seats and a raised platform that Rollo guessed was for the choir. Spotting a balcony with a canopy opposite the musician's gallery, Rollo speculated it was for the emperor and his guests. Their musings were interrupted by martial music as a stunning group of horse riders entered the arena. After the spectacle, they left the venue, maneuvering through the crowd to exit. Feeling tired, Rollo hailed an omnibus for Jane. The ride back was pleasant, passing through the Elysian Fields and the obelisk square. Upon reaching the hotel, they joined their family for dinner, sharing their adventure.|"['1.

Mr. George burst into laughter, finding it amusing that the Parisians were mistakenly led to a camp meeting instead of church. Rollo and his family found humor in the situation too. Mr. George explained that in France, following the crowd on Sunday afternoons won't lead you to church. Despite this, Rollo and Jennie felt uneasy for not spending the afternoon as they usually would, dedicated to rest and religious contemplation. To make amends, Rollo invited Jennie to read the Bible together in her cozy room, filled with beautiful decorations. They set up a comfortable spot with cushions and a footstool, delving into stories from Samuel and Kings, finding solace and enjoyment in the sacred text.|"[""1.

Rollo and Jane, together with their mother and uncle George, visited the Hippodrome one Tuesday afternoon to watch the performances. Among the acts, one in particular caught Rollo's attention. A man came forward and the assistants lifted a large pole, which the man balanced on his apron secured to his hips and shoulders. At the top of the pole, a boy of about twelve years climbed up and performed amazing stunts, hanging in various positions and swinging back and forth. The boy's acrobatics left Rollo and Jane in awe. The man holding the pole skillfully kept it balanced as the boy showcased his incredible agility. The performance was a spectacle that amazed Rollo and Jane, making their visit to the Hippodrome a memorable experience.|"[""1.

One day, Rollo and Jennie watched an incredible performance where a man ascended a mast using a unique method. The man rolled a large ball up a spiral plank, reaching the top of the mast standing on it. The daring act left spectators in awe, with some children even crying out of fear. Despite the tension, the man successfully reached the top and descended back down. Later, Mr. George took Rollo and Jennie on a carriage ride through Paris to explore new parts of the city. They passed by intriguing sites, including a mysterious building that caught Jennie's attention. As they ventured into the building, they encountered a courtyard with a fountain before proceeding up a grand staircase, guided by a uniformed guard.|"['1.

Mr. George led the children through a series of grand rooms filled with bookshelves and books. The rooms had windows only on one side, facing a courtyard, and doors connecting them were all on that same side. The vast collection of books amazed the children, neatly arranged from floor to ceiling behind wire netting. They walked through the library, observing statues, coins, and gems on display. While Mr. George examined ancient printed books, Rollo and Jennie admired the garden outside.

After observing the readers and students through a glass partition, the children followed Mr. George back through the rooms they had traversed. Instead of exiting the way they came, they descended through new corridors to a room filled with people looking at engravings. The room was adorned with bound volumes of prints, some colored and others plain, all very beautiful. Mr. George informed the children that they could request any book from the attendants to peruse the prints. The room had a fountain in the center surrounded by a basin of water. Outside, the square was paved with asphaltum and shaded by trees where children played. Upon returning to the hotel, the children watched other kids playing in the square from Mr. George's room. Among them was a boy in unique attire, playing with a ball. Rollo and the boy communicated through gestures, as they spoke different languages. Despite the language barrier, they enjoyed playing together and attempting to understand each other.|"['1.

After playing with the ball for some time, the two boys began to feel familiar with each other. Rollo wanted to know his new friend's name, so he asked him. The boy smiled and replied in a language Rollo couldn't understand, mentioning that his father bought the ball for two francs. Rollo then gestured for the boy to follow him to his uncle's room. There, Rollo showed the boy a map of Paris, pointing out the Garden of Plants. Through gestures, Rollo conveyed they were going there with his uncle and sister. The boy seemed pleased and nodded. Shortly after, a well-dressed man entered, and the boy spoke to him. Rollo beckoned Carlos to follow him, speaking to him as if he understood, even though they couldn't communicate verbally. Eventually, they decided to take an omnibus to their destination, passing by children playing with a toy chapel.|"[""1.

Rollo decided to give the girl a coin after stopping to admire her chapel. He and Carlos strolled down the Boulevard, chatting in different languages without listening to each other. They enjoyed the companionship of the conversation, much like birds singing to their mates. They boarded an omnibus, noticing the unique sign indicating when it was full. After a series of adventures and bus changes, they arrived at the garden gates, passing by soldiers who allowed peaceful visitors to enter. Inside, Rollo was amazed by the vast and diverse landscapes. The garden was a maze of winding paths bordered by various enclosures with exotic animals. They saw turtles sunbathing, ostriches strutting majestically, and giraffes grazing. The boys were captivated by the extraordinary sights before them.|['1.

Rollo and Carlos explored the Garden of Plants, captivated by the sights around them. They chatted excitedly, pointing out various animals in their enclosures. Walking towards a row of iron-grated buildings, they peered into immense cages holding ferocious beasts like lions and tigers. Mesmerized by the beauty and power of these creatures, they paused at a lion and lioness in one cage. Suddenly, a chilling scream-roar echoed through the air, startling them. The garden's winding paths led them to a crowd gathered near a stone castle housing elephants, giraffes, and more. The boys marveled at the animals behind the sturdy palisade, especially the elephants reaching out their trunks to the onlookers. Amidst the enchanting scenery, Rollo admired the rustic cabins for the animals, planning to replicate one as a playhouse.|['1.

At the zoo, Rollo and Carlos had an exciting day exploring the various animal exhibits. They first witnessed the majestic elephants being fed by visitors through a protective barrier. The elephants eagerly accepted treats like nuts, cake, and gingerbread. Moving on, they encountered a group of playful children in the garden, some building with gravel stones and others jumping rope. The boys then observed bears in sunken yards, delighting in watching them catch gingerbread thrown from above. After feeding the bears, they came across a fascinating monkey palace, a large round cage where the monkeys showcased their acrobatic skills with impressive agility. The boys marveled at the monkeys' playful antics and enjoyed their time exploring the diverse attractions at the zoo.|['1.

Rollo and Carlos observed the monkeys with keen interest. They found a great spot to watch from, as the land sloped up, allowing those farther back a clear view over those in front. Chairs were scattered under the trees at the top of the slope. Rollo noticed some empty chairs and gestured for Carlos to sit with him. As they rested and watched the monkeys, a lady approached speaking French, surprising Rollo about the chair fee. Despite being tired and hungry, Rollo was content to pay for the rest. They later stumbled upon a charming restaurant under ancient trees. They ordered coffee, bread, and butter, enjoying the treat immensely. Meanwhile, Mr. George, his friend, and Jennie explored other sections of the vast garden, including houses, a museum, and colorful flower beds, while Jennie worried about not seeing Rollo.|['1.

One day in Paris, Rollo returned from a walk to find his mother and sister getting ready to ride with Mr. George. Rollo, showing maturity beyond his years, decided to stay with his father instead of joining the ride. He was diligent in his French lessons, always writing them in advance to have time for excursions. When his family left, Rollo seized the opportunity to work on his French exercise. As he finished, his father, feeling better, offered to go for a ride with Rollo anywhere he wished. This gesture showed Rollo the importance of making decisions that align with his responsibilities and priorities, even when presented with tempting alternatives.|"[""1.

Rollo was thrilled with the idea of going to see a balloon ascension at the Hippodrome. He saw a notice about it that morning and quickly told his father about the event. Excited, they got ready and headed to the Hippodrome. They arrived in time to get great seats and witnessed the breathtaking sight of the balloon ascending into the sky. The aeronauts on board seemed calm and even threw down flowers as they rose higher. The event continued with equestrian performances that amazed Rollo. Men on horses engaged in mock battles with lances, followed by girls elegantly jumping over hurdles on white horses. The day ended with a grand spectacle of carriages and officers passing by, leaving Rollo in awe.|"['1.

The commotion caused by the emperor's passing soon settled, and Alfred's horses sped up. The carriage journeyed through a lively scene: trees, booths, lampposts, fountains, and a variety of vehicles and pedestrians. Eventually, they reached the Place Vendome and turned towards the Boulevards. After a half-mile ride, they arrived at the hotel. Rollo, Carlos, and Uncle George joined the ride, exploring the Elysian Fields. Rollo and Carlos excitedly spotted a whirling machine with boats and horses. They rode it twenty times, enjoying the thrill. Later, they tried a vertical whirling machine, swinging high above the ground. Laughter and screams filled the air as they spun around. The boys had a fun-filled adventure at the amusement park, trying out different rides and enjoying the lively atmosphere.|"['1.

As the boys wandered through the crowd, they spotted various attractions - from gingerbread stalls to picture displays and singers under a canopy. Their curiosity led them to a young boy performing acrobatics for coins. Soon, the sight of older boys shooting peas from spring-loaded guns caught their attention. Moving along, they discovered a game involving pitching quoits into a box with brass plates. Despite the seeming simplicity, covering a plate proved challenging. Mr. Holiday cautioned Rollo about the distinction between harmless play and gambling. Rollo tried his hand at the game, failing to cover a plate but enjoying the experience. The lesson learned was clear - engaging in skill-based activities for fun is acceptable, but gambling for prizes is not.|"['1.

Rollo explored many stalls and stands, fascinated by the sights. Eventually, feeling weary, he returned to the carriage, ready to head home. On another occasion, after a day out with his uncle George, Rollo dined at a restaurant on the Boulevards. Excitedly returning to the hotel, he found his mother preparing for a ride with friends. She couldn't take him along due to the invitation's nature. Instead, Rollo decided to follow in their carriage, alone but thrilled by the idea of a scenic ride. Back at the hotel, Rollo and Jennie enjoyed looking at French picture books together. They chatted about the images, making the time pass joyfully. Later, Jennie, feeling tired, asked Rollo about his day with Uncle George, which he happily recounted.|"[""1.

Uncle George and Rollo explored the vast workshops in Paris, where artisans crafted an array of exquisite items by hand. These workshops, stacked up to six or eight stories high, displayed beautiful creations like purses, watches, jewelry, and more in glass cases along the streets. Rollo learned that these were the places where items were made, not sold. They visited a workshop producing artificial flowers, marveling at the intricate designs. They also visited a place where working mothers left their babies in the care of nuns during the day. The babies were gently cared for in high cradles, then placed on a carpeted area to play. The room had high windows and rows of paintings, creating a splendid and spacious environment for the babies.|['1.

Rollo described his visit to a famous gallery with his uncle George, which had grand rooms, marble staircases, and ancient marble statues. He found the paintings more appealing than the statues. They also visited an excellent school where students learned to draw and paint, which felt more like a palace than a school. The students were given a subject to paint, like an old chestnut tree by a stream with cows in the foreground at sunset. Each student interpreted the subject differently. Rollo and his uncle explored a picturesque place by the water with floating houses for baths, flower gardens, and boys fishing along the wall. They even considered renting fishing equipment to try their luck.|['1.

"Rollo chuckled, deeming the idea of spending his time fishing in the Seine during his Paris visit absurd. He mentioned that his European trip cost him a dollar per hour. ""His transatlantic voyages alone will total three hundred dollars, with additional expenses amounting to five hundred more,"" Rollo explained. With just about a hundred days for sightseeing, his daily cost was eight dollars. Although he couldn't justify fishing during the day, he did show Jennie his fishing gear. The equipment included a net and sinkers for securing the line. Rollo detailed how the net worked, illustrating how to catch fish with it. Later, they strolled along the quay, passing bridges until they reached the Notre Dame Cathedral. Inside, they observed elderly women engaged in various activities amidst the grand columns and soaring arches."|"['1.

Rollo and his uncle explored a grand church with high ceilings and numerous pillars. They discovered chapels with intricate stone sculptures and observed people praying and reading. As they wandered, they encountered a congregation and witnessed priests at the altar. Exiting the church, they crossed a bridge to a bronze column marking the site of the Bastile prison. Rollo's uncle shared the history of the prison's destruction during an insurrection. Later, they encountered a street performer attempting to fit himself into a small box for money. The performer's family accompanied him, and a crowd gathered to watch. The man entertained the crowd with jokes and collected coins for his act.|"['1.

Once all the fifteen sous were collected, a man brought out a soldier from the crowd to stand by a box. The man then entered the box, which was not much taller than his knees. He knelt down, crossed his legs, and curled his body into the box. Just as he was about to close the cover, Rollo's adventures in Paris took an unexpected turn. His uncle George invited him on a sudden trip to Switzerland. Despite his love for Paris, Rollo eagerly accepted the invitation. With only a day's notice, Rollo took charge of getting the passports stamped for the journey. Despite some challenges, he successfully completed the task. To celebrate, Rollo, his uncle, and Carlos dined at a luxurious restaurant in the Boulevards. The room was adorned with mirrors, gilded pilasters, and a beautifully painted ceiling. The guests were served by elegant waiters, and two young women managed the accounts with grace. Mr. George and the boys enjoyed a delightful dinner from a vast selection of dishes listed in a book on their table.|"['1.
