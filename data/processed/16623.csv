I have recently acquired land and am now a proud landowner. I waited a long time to even set eyes on the land in the reserve, but the snow is still too deep. Since they only have three months of summer and spring combined, and I wanted the land for a ranch, I decided to stay in the valley. I have filed for land next to Mr. Stewart, and I am very happy with my decision. There is a grove of twelve swamp pines on my property, where I plan to build my house. I initially thought it would be romantic to live on the peaks among the whispering pines, but I realized it might be uncomfortable. I am content with my twelve pines whispering to me. Additionally, I have access to plenty of nice snow-water as a small stream runs through the center of my land. A neighbor and his daughter invited me to Green River, the county-seat, where I could file at the land office. The trip was an adventure, taking a whole week with camping along the way. The journey was filled with fun and excitement, and we encountered various landscapes, including sage, sand, and sheep. At one point, we met a herder with whom we shared a delightful meal. The sagebrush in some areas was too short to make a fire, so we had to drive until late to find a suitable camping spot. As the day ended, we drove through a beautiful ca√±on with shadows falling and the last rays of|"['1.

On a stunning night, I gazed at the moon and stars above the mountain. The moon seemed disheartened, and the stars flirted with the hills. A coyote passed by, struggling to find food. I felt pity for it, but then heard sage chickens startled. As a cloud covered the sky, I drifted to sleep. The next morning, I awoke to snow. While dressing, I daydreamed of being warm by a fireplace. Later, I encountered a stern man at the office. After a comical misunderstanding, I filed my paperwork. Despite the distance from town, I enjoy riding to the office. Even in the snow, I love sharing stories.|"['1.

This summer has been my busiest and happiest one yet. I've been working hard, but I've enjoyed every moment of it. Mr. Stewart, who usually helps, didn't have enough men for haying, so I stepped in to run the mower. I learned to do many tasks since my parents passed away, leaving us six siblings to fend for ourselves. I even made jelly and jam from wild fruits. After a long stretch of hard work, I decided to take a day off. I saddled the pony, packed essentials, and set out with Jerrine, our baby, for a day of adventure. We rode through the mountains, surrounded by the fresh scent of sage and pine. We saw wildlife but were content just to enjoy the beauty of nature. It was a day of pure joy and freedom.|"['1.

Around midday, we reached a small grassy dell beside a creek, bordered by hills on one side and groves of trees on the other. We stopped to have our lunch. I gathered some grasshoppers and made a fishing rod from a birch pole. The trout in the creek were stunning, with silvery sides, speckles of black, and a hint of rose and orange. I easily caught eight of them. After making a fire, I cooked the trout over the coals. We enjoyed our meal with service-berries and cold water. As we rested, the aspen trees started turning yellow, casting playful shadows on the grass. The sound of the rushing water tempted me to fish more, but we decided to head back home as the sun began to set. The locusts' song signaled the approaching fall. Riding back, we witnessed a beautiful sunset and the valley darkening with twilight. Finally, we arrived home, tired but content.|"['1.

"The next day, all the men went for the roundup, leaving for a week. I knew I couldn't stand being alone for that long. Soon after, the ladies passed on their way to Ashland, laughing and happy. I wished I could join them, but they went on, and I felt the need to go somewhere. Feeling reckless, I decided to do something bold. I saddled Robin Adair and ""Jeems McGregor,"" and with Jerrine, we set off on a camping adventure. Riding until late afternoon, I released Robin to find his way home.

As the sun rose over the hilltops, we woke to a stunning sight. Despite the barrenness, everything was beautiful. The frosts had painted the quaking aspens in a shimmering golden hue along the stream. From our elevated vantage point, we could see across the valley, admiring the silver-gold willows, russet currants, and patches of green from the pines. The splendor of nature was complemented by the gray-green hills in the background, adorned with streaks of yellow rabbit-brush. After a refreshing breakfast by the spring, we embarked on our journey without a set destination. Our day was filled with climbing, encountering meadowlarks, sage chickens, and grouse in the timber. We savored a meal by a lake, catching fish and squirrels for sustenance. Despite the challenges of navigating fallen trees and dense forests, the grandeur of the snowy peaks and awe-inspiring landscape reminded us of the vastness of nature and our place within it. We eventually found a safe campsite nestled among towering trees, where we enjoyed a cozy night under the stars.|['1.

"I wish you could experience the comfortable bed we had that night, soft yet firm with a pine scent. The warmth from our crackling fire kept us cozy.

"Finally, everything was set, and Jerrine and I both got on our horses. Riding a pack-horse in a snowstorm over roadless mountains isn't as cozy or safe as you might think. Snow from trees kept falling on us, and ""Jeems"" kept stumbling. After navigating down the mountain, new dangers loomed, like losing sight of smoke or riding into a bog. Eventually, we reached a clearing with a log house and a fireplace, a rare find in Wyoming. A friendly old man, a Southerner, welcomed us with hounds barking in the background. He was all worked up about his suspenders. After some amusing banter, he realized I was just a lost lady in the snow. We bonded over stories and a meal of deer and corn-pone by the warm fire. Zebulon Pike Parker, a cheerful and sprightly man, shared tales of his family and life in Yell County.

Mary Ann drowned in the bayou while trying to pick water-lilies. She always wanted a white dress, so they made her a shroud from white curtains.

We visited a corral with thirty sheep, some looking very old. The owner never sold any because he didn't need money. He knew each animal by name, cared for them lovingly, and cooked a delicious breakfast of venison steak, hoe-cakes, and coffee. We rode back home on mules, passing through canyons.

Finally, the justice of the peace arrived, and I hope they lived happily ever after. To celebrate, a dance was held that night. We hurried through dinner after the wedding to make it in time, as dances are never hosted at home but in the community hall. Each settlement has one, and invitations are simple announcements posted everywhere. Our dinner was a success, with contributions from every woman for miles around.

Mrs. Louderer had planned a special Christmas Eve trip to visit twelve camps with twenty-four men. They packed a feast with roasted geese, hams, hens, meat-loaves, sausages, rye bread, doughnuts, coffee-cakes, and fruit-cakes. The treats were beautifully decorated with icing in brown, pink, and white. They also had butter, jelly, and small cakes with seeds, nuts, and fruit. The group set off early morning in a sled filled with straw, hot rocks, and blankets. Despite rough terrain, they sped across hillsides without slowing down. The sheep-men they visited were thrilled with the feast, as they usually only had canned food. Each camp had one person cooking and the other herding. The journey ended at Frau O'Shaughnessy's for a cozy supper.|"['1.

"Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, a widow, has a fascinating tale. She's a small, cheerful woman with bright blue eyes and a sharp mind. Her cozy cabin welcomed us with a delicious roasted chicken for supper.

"When the day of vaccinating the calves arrived, my friend came to the kitchen and asked for my help to name them. We gathered in a safe spot and took turns naming the calves as they were vaccinated. The first two he named were the ""Duke of Monmouth"" and the ""Duke of Montrose."" I named mine ""Oliver Cromwell"" and ""John Fox."" To seek revenge, he named the next calf the ""Poop of Roome,"" which turned out to be a heifer calf.

Your card just to hand. I wrote you some time ago telling you I had a confession to make and have had no letter since, so thought perhaps you were scared I had done something too bad to forgive. I am suffering just now from eye-strain and can't see to write long at a time, but I reckon I had better confess and get it done with. The thing I have done is to marry Mr. Stewart. It was such an inconsistent thing to do that I was ashamed to tell you. And, too, I was afraid you would think I didn't need your friendship and might desert me. Another of my friends thinks that way. Grandma Edmonson's birthday is the 30th of May, and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy suggested that we give her a party. I had never seen Grandma, but because of something that happened in her family years ago which a few narrow-heads whom it didn't concern in the least cannot forgive or forget, I had heard much of her. The family consists of Grandma, Grandpa, and little Cora Belle, who is the sweetest little bud that ever bloomed upon the twigs of folly. The Edmonsons had only one child, a daughter, who was to have married a man whom her parents objected to solely because he was a sheep-man, while their sympathies were with the cattle-men, although they owned only a small bunch.

Mrs. O'Shaughnessy went to get Cora Belle's parents, who were eager to come. Cora Belle's mother passed away a day after Cora Belle was born, leaving the baby in her mother's arms. Cora Belle's home is in the butte lands, where she lives with her grandparents. Cora Belle is a hardworking young girl managing the household and livestock. She started with sheep, raising them for profit instead of chickens. She sheared her sheep with the help of a sheep-man, sold the wool, and earned sixty dollars. Cora Belle is resourceful and responsible, ensuring her earnings are used wisely for supplies.

After dinner, Cora Belle and I washed the dishes while Mrs. O'Shaughnessy prepared the tiny clothes. Cora Belle's outfits were a surprise. The postmistress, who also runs a small store, sent up hair ribbons for Cora Belle upon hearing about our plans. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy then called us into the bedroom where Cora Belle was. The child was overwhelmed with emotion, thinking the ribbons were for someone else. Despite her tears, she tightly clutched the ribbons, refusing to let go. Grandma, hearing her sobs, rushed to the door in concern. Cora Belle explained they weren't for her or Grandma. The following day, Cora Belle brought a load of wild irises for Decoration Day. Despite the flowers wilting, we all rushed to help gather more. Cora Belle wanted to wear her best dress to visit her mother, and with the help of Gale and Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, she got ready. At the cemetery, Cora Belle lovingly adorned her parents' graves with pine boughs and iris blossoms, speaking to her mother as if she were there.

It was like being enveloped in the scent of lavender and rose petals as I carefully folded the aged, yellowed shirt, a labor of love, and placed it in the container. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy returned, and we embarked on a journey to Zebbie's abode with a wagon and a brimming mess-box. We traversed a new, longer path to accommodate the wagon. Dandelions blanketed the ground in gold, while larkspurs bloomed tall in shades of blue. The landscape was adorned with white service-bushes and wild cherries. Birds chirped melodiously from the branches under a gentle blue sky, with fluffy clouds drifting lazily.

After a delicious supper prepared by Gavotte, including trout, delectable biscuits, crisp lettuce with potato salad, peach preserves, and firm butter, the group gathered inside. As darkness fell, a faint brass lamp illuminated the cabin, while a roaring fire provided warmth. Zebbie led them outside to listen to a distant, eerie wail signaling an approaching windstorm.

The Edmonsons' home was surrounded by red buttes and a serene blue lake. The charming house with a clay roof and a hop-vine on the porch made it a cozy retreat.|"['1.

I went to my room with Jerrine for a rest after a tiring drive. Suddenly, Aggie burst in, furious that they charged us fifty cents each for the rooms. Aggie paid but argued she should only pay a quarter as she'd use it until midnight. When denied, she demanded a refund, but the clerk refused. Aggie was livid, feeling robbed. She left to get revenge. That night, I rushed to prepare for the train, leaving without Aggie. Later, I saw her at the depot, selling eggs and butter, waiting for the night train to Rock Springs. Aggie stayed the whole night in her room despite missing her plans. We headed home, and Aggie quarreled with Archie. Clyde claimed they were devoted, so we switched seats to compare notes.

Jerrine seems destined for the law, always resolving questions to her satisfaction. She prayed for her brother and puppies, dancing with joy when the puppies could walk. Disappointed when her baby brother couldn't, she questioned why God made babies so helpless. Eventually, she understood that babies learn our ways, and we learn to love them. Zebbie's family took him back, and the Lanes and Pattersons are off to Idaho. The room, filled with familiar items, is a treasure trove.

In the night, a noise startled me, conjuring tales of danger. The moonlight revealed the source: a pine bough scraping the wall. Fear dissolved as I saw the serene face of the Blessed Virgin by the dim firelight. After a breakfast of tortillas, cheese, and coffee, we set off for a stocking-leg dinner. Carlota Juanita waved goodbye as Manuel P.F. guided us. He carried a polished horn from Mexico. Our spirits lifted as we journeyed, enjoying the feast at Zebbie's. Venison, antelope, porcupine, beaver-tail, grouse, sage hen, and trout filled our days. Zebbie, his old self again, made our visit delightful.

We journeyed north toward the desert and the buttes, aiming for the mouth of Dry Creek where it meets Black's Fork. This was not the route to Mrs. Louderer's ranch as I had assumed. We were led to the spot where the punchers held five hundred steers. Despite the lack of lunch provisions, we continued our adventure. By noon, we were surrounded by the warm sands of the desert. We encountered horned toads and remnants of the past like buffalo skulls and elk antlers. Upon reaching the camp by the river, disappointment struck as it was deserted. Mrs. Louderer's loud calls echoed in the empty space. Eventually, the cook, Herman, arrived with sage chickens and an antelope, facing Mrs. Louderer's wrath for the lack of food and the antelope's fine.|"[""1.

Two cowboys chatted restlessly, bothered by Tex's constant singing. One complained about feeling homesick and wished Tex would quiet down. The other urged them to shake off the rainwater from the tarp to avoid a leak. As I dozed off, I heard a commotion. Startled awake, a voice demanded to know whose camp it was. It turned out to be Ward's posse looking for Meeks and Murdock. The sheriff and Mat Watson inspected our camp with a lantern, searching for any sign of the fugitives.

The cowboys gathered around the fire, savoring hot coffee and cold beef while rain dripped off their slickers. The fire struggled to blaze high, leaving some men in only ordinary coats to battle the drizzle. Suddenly, a shot rang out, followed by distant booms. In a flash, the men mounted their horses and disappeared into the night. Silence fell, broken only by the occasional revolver shot. As the rain ceased, a star peeked through the clouds. The cook and boss hurried to bed, leaving a peaceful stillness. A breeze carried Tex's song, signaling morning. The cook's energetic wake-up call for cackle-berries and antelope steak stirred everyone. Breakfast was served, with steaming coffee in enameled cups.

The camp was filled with commotion and anticipation. It became clear that one of the outlaws had hidden on N'Yawk's bed while the sheriff was present, then fled after saddling a horse. The outlaw's own horse was discovered in the willows, abandoned with its saddle and bridle removed, showing signs of never being ridden. By sunrise, the exhausted search party returned, too tired from a full day in the saddle to continue the pursuit. The wounded outlaw had likely escaped towards the forests and mountains of Utah. The tension in the camp grew, with only Herman and Mrs. Louderer remaining calm. N'Yawk, visibly shaken, expressed his desire to leave, to which Mrs. Louderer calmly agreed. The boss, frustrated and suspicious of a traitor, diverted his attention to finding his valuable horse.

In the past, when our baby passed away, there was no doctor to assist or a minister to console us. Filled with a deep need to convey a message to our grieving community, we held a funeral service based on a chapter from John. Our neighbors from miles around joined us, uniting in love and shared sorrow. Little Jamie, our first child, left a legacy of love. Despite the initial heartache, with God's blessings, we welcomed two more sons. Today, I find joy in my home nestled among the blue mountains, caring for my children, husband, cows, garden, flowers, and animals. Surrounded by kind neighbors and cherished absent friends, I am truly content. Sharing my happiness with you brings me great joy, and I look forward to writing to you again soon.|"[""1.

We were joyfully making plans for a unique Christmas celebration when a loud stampede of snow announced the arrival of Gavotte. We were thrilled to see him as we knew he would bring some excitement to our evening. Gavotte, unaware that the deer hunt had been canceled, shared stories of his hunting adventures in Canada. Inspired by his tales, he suggested organizing our own Christmas hunt. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy volunteered to drive, and we set off early the next morning towards Phillipeco Mountain, where deer were known to roam. After a long journey, we reached an old mill camp where we settled in for the night. Gavotte treated us to roasted potatoes, sausages, and coffee over a campfire, creating a cozy atmosphere. As night fell, we listened to stories by the fire before retiring to our improvised beds, grateful for the simple joys of the wilderness.|"[""1.

"The moonlit night among the pines was a strange and beautiful sight. The snow sparkled, and the silence was deep, broken only by a distant wail that seemed to hold all the sorrow of the world. Unsure of its source, we were chilled to the core. Gavotte, our guide, ventured out to investigate and found two loggers' wives and children in need of help. One woman was in distress, soon to become a mother. We followed Gavotte through the snow to their camp, where we provided assistance. Despite the inconvenience, the moment we met the young Southern girl, Molly, our hearts were touched. She shared her story of love, loss, and hope, naming her newborn ""Star.""

After a challenging time, Molly's spirits revived. Despite feeling hopeless before, a cup of hot milk and holding her baby made her happy again. We chatted about various things until she fell asleep. As day broke, we stepped outside for fresh air. Another woman joined us, inviting us into her cabin where her children, in poor condition, were waiting. They had little to eat, as their men had not returned. The woman, accustomed to disappointment, shared their story. Suddenly, gunshots rang out, and Gavotte arrived with a deer for them. We headed back to camp for breakfast, where Gavotte brought more food. We decided to help those in need and spent hours sewing clothes and preparing for Christmas.

At ten in the morning on the 24th, we started our journey up the mountain with shovels in case we needed to clear a path. After having lunch at the old camp, Gavotte guided us to the new one, where we secretly moved our belongings into Molly's cabin to surprise the children. Sadly, their future seemed bleak. While Gavotte prepared a cabin for us and tended to the horses, we set up a beautiful Christmas tree with your largest bell and decorations. The children, sent to water the horses, were kept busy while Gavotte set up the tree. When it got dark, we lit candles and called the children. Their joy at seeing their first Christmas tree was heartwarming. The evening continued with gifts and a concert that delighted everyone. Finally, the children, exhausted but happy, hung up their stockings filled with treats before going to bed.|"['1.

Homesteading can be a solution to poverty, but it requires the right temperament. Those afraid of coyotes, hard work, and loneliness may not thrive in ranching. However, a woman who enjoys solitude, appreciates nature's beauty, loves gardening, and is willing to work hard can succeed. By requesting seeds from the Department of Agriculture in Washington for free, homesteaders can experiment without extra cost. Accessing bulletins from the Department and State Experiment Stations can provide valuable information. It's important to gain hands-on experience and share practical advice. Despite the challenges, homesteading offers independence, a constant food supply, and eventually, a place to call home. The writer's personal experiences highlight the rewards of homesteading and the importance of determination and courage in achieving self-sufficiency.|"['1.

"Dear Friend,

I received your letter and wanted to reply quickly before you depart. Balancing my duties with my family, including three children, a garden, chickens, cows, and housework, leaves me with very little time. My maiden name is Pruitt, and when I want to sound fancy, I sign as Elinore Pruitt Stewart. Despite my busy life, I'll share how I met my husband, Clyde. It all started when I had a stitch in my side while tending to the furnace at the Nursery. Feeling unwell, I went to see Reverend Father Corrigan, who encouraged me to place an ad in the paper, leading to Clyde's offer. After some initial apprehension, we met at the Sunshine Mission, and I'm proud to say that he has brought immense joy into my life. Our children are doing well, and Jerrine sends her regards. I've also been working on a project to share indoor outing ideas for invalids based on your suggestion. It's late now, so I must bid you goodnight.

Tears of frustration clouded my vision as I struggled to steer the team away from the unsettling noises and shouts emanating from the house. As I hurried to escape the unpleasant surroundings, my spirits lifted at the thought of meeting Kate Higbee, who I believed would be an intriguing individual. Despite my guide omitting details about the buttes, I pressed on, navigating around them and through ravines, eventually feeling disoriented.

Sometimes a woman may become too angry to speak. It may be hard to believe, but it does happen. I experienced this once when a man did not offer to help me. Without responding to him, I got out of the wagon and started to untie the horses. He asked if I was planning to camp there, to which I replied sharply that I was. Despite my initial frustration, I tried to find something positive about the situation. I realized it was better to be with him than with a drunken person. After taking care of the horses, I made the children comfortable. Surprisingly, the man shared what little food he had with us, leaving nothing for the baby's breakfast. Later, he cooked a delicious meal, and we all enjoyed it together by the fire. It goes to show that good food can bring people together and improve the mood.|"[""1.

Under the wagon, I made our bed while Hiram K. set up canvas for shelter. Feeling relieved, I chatted happily with him. As he secured the canvas, he asked if I initially thought he was a troublemaker. I admitted I did, and he confirmed it, saying I guessed right. After putting the kids to bed, we sat by the fire. He shared stories of the past when danger lurked everywhere. Nowadays, he lamented, only animals like bears and antelopes provide excitement. I was tired and soon went to bed. In the morning, we had a simple breakfast of pork and beans cooked on a campfire in Wyoming. Afterward, Hiram guided us to the stage-road and bid us farewell, reminiscing about old times.

As the sun set, painting the sky in shades of crimson and gold, we arrived at the village where the Bishop resided. Driving through the quaint settlement past the store and meeting-house, we reached the Bishop's more grandiose home, a frame building with paint and shutters. Despite knocking and searching, the Bishop was not there. A friendly boy directed us to his mother's house for shelter for the night.

Our hostess, a Mormon, shared insights into her polygamous upbringing, believing it prepared them for the afterlife. She recounted the challenges faced by polygamous families, where the first wife held authority. Despite her husband's casting her off to protect himself, she harbored no ill feelings. Mrs. D---- acknowledged discord with her sister-wife but remained optimistic, believing things would eventually be set right. As we departed, she bid us farewell warmly, concealing her trials behind a cheerful facade. Upon reaching the railroad, delays allowed us time to refresh before boarding the train. During the journey, we overheard a cowboy's tale of unrequited love for a waitress, seeking advice from his English companion.

"We were eager to see the outcome of our friend's advice and were among the first in the dining-room the next morning. A girl was setting up the tables, and a boyish man in bat-wing chaps stood by the stove. It was Johnny, and ""'Attie"" blushed when their heads bumped while fixing her caught skirt. After breakfast, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy went to see Cormac O'Toole, the only one who could lend us a team for our journey. A drummer at breakfast was frustrated with the cold and snow, unable to find a ride. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy tried to invite him along, but he declined, calling her bold.

Mrs. O'Shaughnessy spoke to a friend and mentioned our destination. Shortly after, we grabbed our suitcases and left. While passing the freight depot, a stranger we had noticed earlier approached us and asked for a ride. Despite feeling scared, Mrs. O'Shaughnessy, confident in her abilities, allowed the man to join us. As he drove, we nestled under the blankets and listened to the sled's runners screeching on the icy ground. We had lunch with a new settler and later encountered a man named B---- walking home after his horse had escaped. He chattered a lot during our brief journey. When we passed the Bishop's residence, the stranger revealed it as his home and invited us in, but we declined. The next day, we learned that the Bishop had been shot the previous night near Mrs. Belle B----'s house. Mrs. O'Shaughnessy comforted Mrs. Belle, and I was relieved to return home.|"[""1.
