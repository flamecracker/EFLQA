Acknowledgments are due to esteemed writers like Sadakichi Hartmann, Muther, and others who have contributed to the understanding of art. The history of art dates back to man's desire to decorate his possessions, a sign of early civilization. From simple markings on clay and wood, art evolved to include crude coloring and drawing. The first serious attempts at drawing were seen in Egyptian art, depicting square and pointed figures, animals, and men. As artistic skills developed, artists moved from mere representation to idealized expressions, glorifying the ordinary with graceful lines and beautiful colors. In America, Indian pottery marked the beginning of art, leading to the creation of metalwork, drawing, and portraiture. The Centennial Exhibition of 1876 in the United States marked a turning point, introducing real art to a broader audience and sparking a newfound appreciation for refined art across the nation.|"['1.

The head of the Metropolitan Museum in New York believes that portrait-painting can save modern artists from artistic sins. He explains that while an artist can paint a green cow without consequences, when painting portraits, people prefer to be depicted accurately. This preference limits an artist's creativity but also prevents them from being labeled as mad. The curator warns against extremes in art appreciation, advocating for a balanced, open-minded approach. He emphasizes that true art lovers appreciate beauty where it genuinely exists and avoid being misled by imagination. The passage also recounts the life of Andrea, an Italian painter born in Florence, who faced challenges due to his wife's materialistic demands, leading him down a troubled path despite his artistic talent. Andrea's early life as a goldsmith apprentice was marked by his inclination towards original designs, which clashed with the traditional expectations of the trade.|"['1.

"The first mentor, Barile, was stern and incapable but fair. He guided Andrea to better help. Under Piero di Cosimo's tutelage, Andrea and his friend, Francia Bigio, started their own studio in Piazza del Grano. They painted the ""Baptism of Christ,"" a modest beginning that caught attention in a time dominated by Titian and Leonardo. Andrea, a shy youth with a brilliant imagination, painted swiftly and accurately. Despite his success, tragedy struck when he fell for a hatter's wife, Lucretia, who was vile and drove him to his grave. His work gained fame in France, away from Lucretia's influence, and he found peace to pursue his art with ambition. Andrea's story teaches the importance of surrounding oneself with positive influences and staying true to one's artistic vision."|"['1. What type of mentor was Barile to Andrea?\nA.

"The artist Andrea del Sarto yearned for kindness and support from his wife but never received it. He died alone during a plague in Florence, abandoned by his wife who feared falling ill. Even in death, few mourned him. Years later, a woman claimed to be his widow, proud of her connection to the deceased artist. Andrea's painting, ""Birth of the Virgin,"" is admired for its beauty, although some details lack softness. His serious portrayal of religious figures differs from the playful style of his contemporaries. Andrea's works include ""Charity,"" ""Madonna dell' Arpie,"" and ""Joseph's Dream."" He was a versatile artist, much like Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, but faced a tragic and restless life.

While Rome indulged in pleasure and extravagance, Michelangelo stood apart, disapproving of the frivolity around him. Despite his inner turmoil, he continued to work diligently, even fighting for Florence's freedom. Michelangelo supported his family financially, shouldering their burdens while withdrawing from society. His dedication to his craft was evident in his monumental projects, like the tomb of Julius II and the colossal statue of Moses.

"Julius commanded Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling, which he strongly opposed. Despite protests, he accused those around him of plotting against him. He wanted to carve a mountain instead, claiming the work belonged to Raphael. The Pope suggested filling spaces with saints for payment, but Michelangelo, a dedicated artist, refused. He crafted a makeshift helmet with a candle and worked tirelessly on his back. This intense labor caused him to struggle to look down afterward. Subsequently, Pope Paul III also enlisted Michelangelo's talents, leading to the creation of the ""Last Judgment.""

Arnold Böcklin, a renowned artist, embarked on a journey to discover his artistic path at a young age. Dissatisfied with the sentimental and anecdotal art in Düsseldorf, he sought inspiration in Brussels and later in Paris.

Böcklin's artistic journey led him to Rome and Zürich, but it was Italy that left the most profound mark on his work. He found solace in the Campagna of Rome, painting landscapes with a mysterious and solemn character.

During the time Albrecht Dürer was growing up, Nuremberg was a hub of intellect and art in the North. Augsburg also followed art trends but was less significant than Nuremberg, where various art forms were pursued with sincerity and originality. The craft of the goldsmith was closely linked to painting, requiring talent for designing. Dürer's father, a goldsmith, intended for him to follow in his footsteps due to the family's large size. Despite being proficient in all he undertook, Dürer found craftsmanship tedious and yearned to join a studio. After apprenticing under Wolgemuth, Dürer honed his skills in painting, engraving, and woodwork. His intellectual approach to art set him apart, making him a versatile artist.|"[""1.

"After this period, Dürer created his tiniest artwork, barely an inch in size. On this small canvas, he depicted the entire crucifixion story, now housed in the Dresden Gallery. While Italian art may lack depth in facial expressions, Dürer's German art, though sometimes featuring unconventional models and precise details, shines through with sincerity. His works display genuine emotions and intentions that resonate with viewers, evoking both admiration and affection. Dürer's Madonna may be described as a typical German mother with a cheerful boy, yet the portrayal exudes motherly love and a child's innocence, surpassing some Italian renditions. Notably, Dürer's ""Praying Hands"" painting tells a poignant tale of a friend's humility and acceptance of defeat, inspiring its creation. Despite financial struggles, Dürer dedicated years to crafting intricate woodcut engravings, including a monumental arch detailing Maximilian's lineage and life events. His diary entries during travels reflect his keen observations and strong opinions, capturing historical events and personal experiences.

In the past, artists like Cimabue had studios that were more like workshops. They had to make their own colors, prepare panels for painting, and do many other tasks. Apprentices, usually boys, crowded the studio to learn from the master by watching and receiving occasional advice. Giotto, a talented artist, joined one of these studios in Florence and surpassed his master. Despite his greatness for his time, Giotto's paintings may seem crude and stiff compared to later art. Apprentices had to master color grinding and other skills before using a brush, which took about six years. Giotto's perseverance paid off, leading him to become an original painter and architect. His kindness and talent made him unforgettable, as seen in amusing anecdotes about his life. Giotto's perfect circle drawing earned him a significant project decorating Roman buildings.

"During the 19th century, a group of three men, Hunt, Rossetti, and Millais, formed an alliance known as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (P. R. B.), signing their paintings as a symbol of unity. Despite facing initial challenges, the Brotherhood received unexpected support from the influential critic John Ruskin. Ruskin's endorsement elevated the Pre-Raphaelites' status in the art world, paving the way for their recognition as exceptional artists. The Brotherhood even attempted to publish a monthly periodical called the _Germ_ to express their ideas, but financial constraints limited its success. Notably, Hunt's dedication to authenticity led him to extreme lengths to capture the essence of his subjects, like painting in the desolate Dead Sea region for his piece ""Scapegoat."" His meticulous approach also shines through in his iconic work ""Christ in the Temple,"" which Ruskin eloquently described, emphasizing the profound symbolism within the painting.

The idea is that by placing small dots of basic colors close together on canvas, without blending them, just individual dots of red, yellow, blue, etc., the illusion of motion is created. While this technique has not achieved that effect, it has resulted in bizarre, unattractive pictures that have drawn attention. The first artist to paint this way was a Frenchman named Seurat, inspired by experiments in light and color by Professor Rood of Columbia University. Following him were Pissarro and Monet. Monet, born in Paris but raised in Havre, learned from Boudin, a painter of harbors. Monet's work was influenced by his observation of light and color, leading to discoveries like green appearing yellow in strong sunlight. Monet's art aimed to capture the essence of light's impact on objects, transcending concrete reality. His unique style, though criticized, aimed to evoke the spiritual influence of light.|"['1.

Adopting his aunt's surname, Murillo was raised by her alongside his sister Therese.

During a remarkable period in Rubens's career, he painted forty church ceilings in Antwerp, but tragically, they were destroyed by fire. Fortunately, copies made by De Witt in watercolors were later turned into etchings, preserving the memory of Rubens's work. This marked the first instance of foreshortening by a Flemish painter. Rubens, like Michelangelo, favored painting large pictures on expansive surfaces, believing it allowed artists to express ideas freely and realistically. Apart from his artistic achievements, Rubens also engaged in diplomatic services to foster friendship between Spain and England. Despite initial skepticism about his diplomatic abilities due to his artistic background, Rubens successfully negotiated with England alongside Gerbier, another artist-turned-diplomat. The two men met in Holland and discussed matters, leading to Rubens being knighted by Charles I in England and honored by the University of Cambridge.

"Turner was known as a rugged, small man who didn't mind his appearance. He wore baggy clothes and carried his belongings in a handkerchief tied to a cane. He enjoyed hunting and fishing and traveled extensively to be alone in nature. Turner walked 25 miles a day, observing every detail and sketching in his book. His love for solitude earned him the nickname ""the Great Hermit of Nature."" One day, he sketched Norham Castle, which later became famous and brought him much work. Turner's life changed when his love married another man, turning him into a frugal and solitary figure. He cared for birds and made intricate ship paintings, while his father helped with his artwork.

Long ago, the artist witnessed the arrival of Nelson's fleet at Portsmouth after the victory at Trafalgar. The _Téméraire_, a brave English battleship, had captured two French frigates during the battle. Decades later, he saw the same ship being towed down the Thames to be dismantled. Inspired by its heroic past, he painted a poignant scene of the ship's farewell under the setting sun. Anthony Van Dyke, born into a silk merchant family, grew up believing he belonged to high society. He became known for his elegant and fashionable portraits, setting a trend with his style of painting. Apprenticed to a painter at ten and later a pupil of Rubens, his early works were so strong that some were mistaken for his master's.

When Van Dyck was around thirty-six years old, he married Lady Mary Ruthven, a noblewoman. Before this, he was in love with Margaret Lemon, whom he painted in various artworks. When he married Lady Mary, Margaret Lemon became extremely jealous and even attempted to harm Van Dyck's painting hand out of jealousy. Meanwhile, Rubens passed away, leaving unfinished paintings for the King of Spain. Van Dyck was asked to complete these works and was also requested to create an independent painting for the series. Ferdinand of Austria mentioned Van Dyck's erratic behavior when he hurried back to London to arrange his move for the project.

In Madrid, there was a great chance for the talented artist Velasquez. His master encouraged him to go there and seek his fortune. Velasquez embarked on a journey on mule-back with his slave. However, without gaining the king's favor, advancing in Madrid seemed impossible. After several failed attempts to meet the king, Velasquez had to return to his old master. But fortune smiled upon him when the king, Philip IV, saw and admired one of his paintings. Impressed, the king summoned Velasquez and offered him gold to cover his expenses. Eventually, Velasquez moved his family to Madrid with the king's support. Over time, a strong friendship blossomed between Velasquez and the king, who shared a love for art.

"Jean-Antoine Watteau, a renowned French painter, faced a delicate health condition that led him to seek solace away from his close friends. The Abbé Haranger, however, insisted on caring for him and secured a peaceful lodging in Nogent for Watteau, where he could enjoy fresh country air. Tragically, Watteau passed away shortly after moving to Nogent in July 1721. Before his death, he generously bequeathed nine thousand livres to his parents and his cherished paintings to his dear friends, including the Abbé, Gersaint, Monsieur Henin, and Monsieur Julienne. Watteau, though of Flemish origin, is celebrated as the ""first French painter."" His unique painting style, characterized by delicate colors and a creamy, opalescent white hue, set him apart. One of his masterpieces, the ""Fête Champêtre,"" housed in the National Gallery at Edinburgh, captures an elegant scene of ladies and gentlemen engaged in a refined outdoor dance.
