"In a quaint village in Switzerland, a doctor's daughter, Johanna Spyri, listened intently to her father's tales of his journeys to tend to the sick. With no modern conveniences like phones or cars, he rode his horse to far-off places for days to help those in need. Johanna grew fond of the stories and the people her father cared for. As she grew older, she visited these places herself. Eventually, she wrote beloved stories like ""Erick and Sally."" These tales, translated by Helene H. Boll, brought joy to children in America. In a bright schoolhouse in Upper Wood, as the sun streamed in, children eagerly awaited the end of the day. Ritz, the minister's son, remembered his aunt's strict bedtime rules. Lost in thought, he shared his thoughts with his teacher, who gently guided him to improve his sentence structure."|"['1.

Marianne was deeply troubled as she pleaded with Mrs. Dorn not to leave her little boy, Erick, without any support. Mrs. Dorn, looking at her sleeping son, explained that while Erick had no earthly father, he had a heavenly Father who would always care for him. She expressed regret for past mistakes but found solace in the love and compassion of their heavenly Father. Later that night, Mrs. Dorn passed away peacefully, leaving Marianne to care for Erick.

Sally and Kaetheli, the top students, whispered like a gentle stream. Kaetheli had so much news that she distracted Sally during arithmetic, causing confusion. Edi, the best student, was lost in thought about his troops' bravery. The teacher asked Edi about Upper Italy's main productions, triggering memories of his war strategies. The teacher noticed the students' distraction and gave them homework. After school, Kaetheli shared more news with Sally. Sally, overwhelmed with sadness, couldn't eat at lunch, thinking about Erick, who was now alone in the world.

Sally cried loudly as she was led out of the room by her mother, causing a disruption during lunch. The father sat silently, and the aunt animatedly pointed out how children get agitated when they don't sleep on time. Edi felt uneasy about his father knowing of his school inattention. Ritz expected a scolding but received none. Sally's outburst was linked to a story she told her mother about events at Marianne's cottage. The mother suggested investigating the strangers, but the pastor disagreed, saying the matter was for the Lower Wood pastor. Sally's vivid emotions were discussed, with the mother defending her warm-heartedness. The mysterious death of the strange woman led to speculation among the villagers.

Marianne bravely defended the memory of a woman everyone else spoke ill of. She knew the woman to be kind and gentle, despite her aristocratic appearance. When the woman passed away, leaving behind little for her son, Marianne stepped in to care for the boy. She offered to look after him until she moved away in three weeks. The officials were grateful for her help. The boy, named Erick, was deeply saddened by his mother's death. Marianne noticed his quiet tears and decided he should go back to school to find happiness again. Erick, although still somber, gradually began to return to his old self. However, a newfound shyness seemed to have taken hold of him. Marianne believed that the love and protection of his mother had been like a strong wall around him, and now that wall was gone. Despite his sorrow, Marianne encouraged Erick to play with other children and slowly return to his studies.|"['1.

"Today, Erick watched the Middle Lot children play in the meadow with surprise. As they played ""Catch me if you can,"" Big Churi chased Kaetheli. Knowing the consequences of being caught, Kaetheli ran towards Marianne's garden, nearly knocking over Erick. Just as Churi was about to catch Kaetheli, Erick intervened, allowing her to reach her goal safely. Grateful for his help, Kaetheli invited Erick to join the game. Reluctantly, Erick joined and played with enthusiasm until he suddenly ran away after hearing music from a blind man's barrel-organ. This pattern repeated each evening, with Erick leaving abruptly during the games. Despite attempts to engage him, Erick often wandered off to listen to music or follow wandering journeymen.

Kaetheli was puzzled by Erick's sudden disappearances during their evening fun. Annoyed, she confronted him at Marianne's cottage. Erick explained that he longed to hear a special song his mother used to sing, but no one knew it. Touched by his sadness, Kaetheli offered to help.

However, Sally's search proved more challenging than expected. After a long discussion about the song's emotions and themes, Sally attempted to guess but none matched the description. Suddenly, Kaetheli had to leave as the evening bells rang, fearing her father's scolding for being late. Sally promised to find the song and bring it to school to avoid disappointing Erick. Rushing home, Kaetheli left Sally to search through a pile of books to find the missing song. Despite her family's curiosity about the books, Sally was determined to locate the song.

The pastor emerged, and Sally's mother led her towards the church. Kaetheli headed inside, and Sally followed, but fear and anguish made her tremble. Inside, she couldn't focus on the organ festivities; she only saw Erick's distressed image in her mind. Meanwhile, Churi and his officers gathered as planned. They carried baskets to collect grapes quickly and enjoy them later in the woods. Churi, feeling suspicious, ordered the baskets hidden until the churchgoers were inside. Erick, curious about the baskets, received no answer. As they approached the church silently, the congregation's singing startled Churi, who feared exposure. Mistaking his companions for pursuers, he fled in panic. Erick found himself amidst a crowded church, where a hymn, including his mother's favorite, moved him to tears. A kind woman comforted him, and he sat through the sermon, deeply touched by the music.|"['1.

"Weeks had gone by since Erick had moved into the parsonage, but 'Lizebeth remained firm.
