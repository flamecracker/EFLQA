The young white boy named Robert Lennox stood beside his red-skinned companion, Tayoga, a young warrior of the Onondaga tribe.

David Willet refrained from attributing the French adaptation to the Indian ways as the reason behind their success, out of respect for Tayoga. The wilderness ranger held Tayoga in high regard, always viewing him as a nobleman of the forest.

"The three carefully brought the canoe to the shore to let it dry. The bank wasn't steep, and deer at the water's edge hinted at an easier slope ahead. ""This seems like a good spot for game,"" Willet remarked. ""There must be more deer in the woods. This is wild land, with few warriors and white men around."" Tayoga playfully bantered with Willet about his strength, recalling a past encounter with a moose. Willet, unfazed, moved the canoe effortlessly. He was a giant, perfectly built for the wilderness.

Tayoga and Robert quietly ventured into the woods, the white youth carrying his rifle as a precaution against the stirring tribes influenced by the French. They moved stealthily to avoid alarming any potential game. Although no other people were around, the forest teemed with life. Rabbits and chipmunks observed them, while squirrels chattered from the trees. Birds filled the air with their songs, and a wildcat watched them warily. Tayoga felt a deep connection to the wilderness, knowing the trees and their uses intimately. As they moved through the forest, Tayoga keenly observed every detail, from the trees to the terrain, ensuring he would recognize the landscape on his return.

Tayoga paused and signaled to Robert, pointing out a stag grazing peacefully nearby. The Indian, respecting the deer as a gift from Manitou for sustenance, readied his bow with a perfectly crafted arrow. With ancestral hunting instincts guiding him, Tayoga took aim at the stag's heart, unleashing the arrow with deadly precision. The deer fell swiftly, and the two companions efficiently dressed the carcass. As they worked, they heard the ominous sounds of approaching wolves, prompting Tayoga to share a belief from his people about the souls of the wicked inhabiting these creatures.

Robert and Tayoga were in the forest, discussing religion. Tayoga believed his religion was similar to the white man's, but Robert respected his pride. As they prepared a deer for transportation, they were surrounded by hungry wolves. The two men cooked the deer meat and decided to take it with them. Robert, contemplative by nature, sat back while Willet and Tayoga scouted the area. Robert felt the tension between England and France, sensing that a crisis was imminent.

Robert stated that merchants still engage in trade and contribute to the nation's growth more than soldiers. Tandakora, a formidable Ojibway chief, reacted to the arrival of Monsieur Lennox's friends, showing the French's influence over the Indians. St. Luc, Dubois, Tayoga, and Willet joined the gathering.

"It was a significant speech, and Robert looked at Tayoga, but the young chief's eyes were hidden. If he resented the French claim to the lands where the Hodenosaunee hunted, he did not show it. St. Luc paused, waiting for a response, but when none came, he continued: ""He came among us when the Six Nations were the Five, burned our homes, and killed our warriors! Our elders passed down the stories. We lacked guns then, and our bows and arrows were no match for the French muskets. But we have guns and rifles now, the best available."" Tayoga's expression remained neutral, but his words were clear. Robert glanced at St. Luc, who understood. The chevalier remained composed.

"""Willet pointed to a cove on the right,"" he said. ""Let's paddle the canoe into the trees and wrap up in our blankets. It's good we have them, as the night will bring a chill,"" he added. The Onondaga took in deep breaths of the fresh air, his eyes gleaming as he gazed over the vast wilderness of mountains, lakes, forests, and rivers. The twilight was tinted with the red of the setting sun, making the world glow. Tayoga spoke of the land between the Hudson River and the western lakes, created by the Divine Being, Hawenneyu. He explained how the Iroquois, guided by Tododaho and Hayowentha, formed the great League of the Hodenosaunee and rightfully claimed the land. Willet admired Tayoga's beliefs and entrusted the first watch to himself. As the night fell, Tayoga, with reverence for the sun, unfolded his blue blanket, embroidered with warlike designs, and lay down to rest. The hunter watched over the boys, feeling grateful for their company in the wilderness. He woke Robert for his turn to keep watch, while Tayoga, following forest discipline, slept soundly."|"['1.

Robert, despite feeling safe, remained vigilant on the riverbank. His wilderness expertise and acute senses allowed him to detect danger even in the dark. Concealed between bushes on a fallen tree trunk, he could see far through the leaves. Thoughts of St. Luc, a charismatic Frenchman, occupied his mind. Robert pondered the impact St. Luc would have on his life and the Iroquois sachems. Concerned about the delicate balance between the English and the Iroquois, Robert questioned the sachems' reaction to St. Luc's persuasive French charm. As he gazed at the lake, a shadow caught his eye, but he dismissed it as a mere reflection. Despite his initial alarm, the tranquility of the forest comforted him, and he returned to his sleeping companions, Tayoga and Willet, grateful for their loyalty. Sensing an impending event, Robert remained watchful, relying on his keen senses to detect any threat lurking in the forest.|"['1.

His initial instinct was to return to his companions in the hollow and wake them up. However, he decided to remain still, crouching in the undergrowth with his hand on his rifle, waiting for the danger to pass. The forest fell silent, the wind calmed, and the leaves stopped rustling. He patiently scanned the surroundings, alert to any movement or sound. After a while, he heard a faint sliding noise, like a serpent in the grass, sending a shiver down his spine. Convinced it was just his imagination, he stood up, only to quickly kneel again as a glint caught his eye. A tomahawk embedded in a tree trunk where his head had been moments before revealed a close call. With a French-made weapon identified, the group realized the danger lurking nearby and prepared for a potential ambush.|['1.

The Ojibway warrior showed cunning by swiftly leaving after throwing his tomahawk to avoid Lennox's retaliation. He even abandoned his prized weapon, a sign of his shrewdness. They traced his path towards the lake but lost it on the hard ground. Robert mentioned a shadow he saw near the far bank, likely Tandakora in a canoe. Tayoga explained that the Ojibway acted alone, driven by the desire for scalps. The group felt relieved knowing the Frenchman, St. Luc, was not involved in the treacherous act. The hunter speculated that St. Luc might not reprimand Tandakora to avoid angering the Ojibways. They decided to scout the woods, finding no threats, and enjoyed a peaceful breakfast by the lake. Then, they continued their journey by canoe, navigating a swift stream, encountering wildlife in the untouched wilderness. They remained cautious, altering their route to throw off potential pursuers and to reach their destination safely.|"['1.

They lived comfortably, understanding the need for strength preservation. Tayoga hunted deer and fished, ensuring an abundance of food. They lit fires cautiously in sheltered spots, extinguishing them quickly. Robert observed Tayoga's view of non-Hodenosaunee tribes, seeing them as inferior. Tayoga expressed increasing danger due to Tandakora's pursuit for scalps. They noticed signs of danger on the riverbank, prompting them to hide in the woods until nightfall. Willet found more footprints leading north, suggesting a band ahead. Confident in their wilderness skills, they decided to follow under the cover of darkness, prepared to face any challenges.|"['1.

At twilight, the three adventurers paddled swiftly down the river, but dark clouds rolled in, covering the sky. A strong, damp wind blew, making the water appear black. Distant thunder rumbled, creating an eerie atmosphere in the wilderness. Robert scanned the dense forest on both sides, feeling a sense of foreboding. The lightning illuminated the river, revealing the impending storm's intensity. The wind howled, causing waves to form, challenging their canoeing skills. The storm approached rapidly, with trees crashing and branches breaking. The lightning painted the water red, highlighting the danger. The group paddled desperately, avoiding rocks and staying afloat. Willet's warning about an imminent deluge of rain and powerful waves proved true. The adventurers narrowly escaped a falling tree, realizing the peril they faced.|"[""1.

Robert, the foremost in the canoe, noticed the cliff ahead, hollowed at the base by water erosion, projecting over the stream. He realized it was the haven Tayoga had in mind. Tayoga nodded, and they paddled with all their strength, racing toward the much-needed sanctuary. As they neared, Robert observed the cave-like hollow beneath the cliff, offering a smooth, windless pool. Tayoga directed them to a broad ledge where they safely landed the canoe. The natural harbor provided comfort as the storm raged outside. Willet reminded Robert of the importance of staying calm in adversity.

Willet praised a beautiful hymn sung by Tayoga, comparing it to his people's best. After a long day's work, they settled down to sleep on a stone shelf with the canoe nearby. Despite the storm raging outside, they were safe and dry. Tayoga, the last to fall asleep, awoke before dawn. His keen senses picked up subtle warnings in the sounds of the storm and river. Feeling a looming danger, he prepared himself, alert and ready. Though his companions slept peacefully, Tayoga sensed a threat approaching. With his knife in hand, he cautiously stepped into the rising water, straining his eyes and ears to detect the source of the danger lurking in the darkness.|"[""1.

Tayoga focused intensely, concentrating all his senses on one point, making the darkness fade and revealing new sounds of the water. Debris floated by, and when a tree approached, he struck it with his knife, turning it red. Letting out a victorious war cry, he revealed how he thwarted an ambush by enemy warriors. The group huddled against the rock, knowing the attackers were nearby. Despite a brief respite, they anticipated more danger. The hunter acknowledged Tayoga's vigilance, ensuring their safety. As bullets whizzed past, they remained hidden, their canoe providing hope for escape. Despite a volley of shots, their shelter felt secure, like an impregnable fortress. The enemy's random firing posed little threat, with only one bullet coming close. The group braced for more attacks, their refuge offering a sense of safety as the storm raged on.|"['1.

Willet and his companions gathered logs and smaller pieces to build a hidden shelter on a stone shelf. As they waited for daylight, they ate deer meat and rested briefly. The rain lessened, the river rose, but soon the rain stopped. The clouds cleared, revealing stars in the dark blue sky. Willet expressed concern about potential danger from unknown enemies. Tayoga discussed the deceitful ways of the Governor General of Canada, while Willet praised the straightforwardness of the English and Americans. Despite acknowledging the bravery of the French, they highlighted the French's willingness to ignore atrocities committed by their allies. The group reflected on encounters with the French, particularly St. Luc, acknowledging the complexities of friendships and enmities in times of war.|['1.

"""Don't try it, Tayoga. We're on the defense, and we'll let 'em make all the beginnings. The sooner they shoot away their ammunition the better it will be for us. I think they'll open fire pretty soon now, because the night is growing uncommon bright. The stars are so big and shining, and there are so many of them they all look as if they had come to a party. Flatten yourselves down, boys! I can see a figure kneeling by a bowlder and that means one shot, if not more."" They lay close and Robert was very thankful now for the logs they had dragged up from the water, as they afforded almost complete shelter. The crouching warrior farther up the stream fired, and his bullet struck the hollow above their heads. More shots were fired, and one buried itself in the log in front of Robert. He heard the thud made by the bullet as it entered, and once more he was thankful for their rude breastwork. But it was the only one that struck so close and presently the savages ceased their fire, although the besieged three were still able to see them in the brilliant moonlight among the bowlders. ""They're getting a bit too insolent,"" said the hunter. ""Maybe they think it's a shorter distance from them to us than it is from us to them, and that our bullets would drop before they got to 'em.

In the forest, one must act as the locals do, the hunter explained thoughtfully. The indigenous people learn patience from a young age, a trait that sets them apart from white men. Uncertain of how long they would remain in their current situation, they savored the deer meat, ensuring they maintained their strength throughout the day. Despite the flood's murky water being their only drink, they refreshed themselves, enduring the warriors' sporadic shots with minimal impact. As the afternoon progressed, the warm air weighed down on them, making it challenging to stay alert. Observing the besiegers' lack of significant movement, Willet expressed concern over the extended delay.

Three individuals decided to embark on a daring adventure. They undressed and carefully arranged their belongings in a canoe, making sure their rifles were easily accessible. Despite their caution, they sensed danger lurking nearby. The trio, led by Robert, boldly chose to navigate the river, believing it to be the best course of action. With Tayoga's help, they gently guided the canoe downstream, hugging the cliff for safety. The canoe, named Gasna Gaowo, was a masterpiece crafted by the Onondaga tribe, adorned with scarlet eagle eyes. As they floated, the canoe seemed to have a mind of its own, exploring the mysterious river. Despite the darkness and the threat of unseen dangers, the canoe continued its solitary journey, guided by an unseen force, moving swiftly downstream.|"['1.

"""It's not often that I fight an Indian with my fists, and the chance having come I made the most of it,"" said the hunter. ""He may have been a sentinel set to watch for just such an attempt as we are making, but it's likely they thought if we made a dash for it we'd be in the canoe."" ""It was great wisdom for us to swim,"" said Tayoga. ""Another sentinel seeing the canoe may also think it was washed away somewhere and is merely floating on the waters. I can see a heap of underbrush that has gathered against a projecting point, and the current would naturally bring the canoe into it. Suppose we let it rest there until it seems to work free by the action of the water, and then go on down the river."" A spit of high ground projected into the river, and in time enough driftwood brought by the stream had made a raft against which the canoe lodged. The current continually pushed and sucked at it, causing the light craft to quiver and sway. The three hid in the vegetation, staying quiet.

Tayoga let out a fierce war cry, piercing the air like a sword slash. The cry held various emotions - satisfaction, triumph, and a taunt for their foes. As the cry faded, a sinister note lingered like a warning to any pursuers. Willet chuckled softly, pleased with Tayoga's bold move. The enemy responded with a cry, but the trio paddled on, their muscles straining with effort. Hours passed, miles fell away, and as dawn broke, they landed safely on the left bank. They rested, catching their breath, grateful for their escape. Willet, relieved, praised their successful evasion. After ensuring their gear was in order, they enjoyed a breakfast of deer meat.

The Onondaga spoke with authority, his words hitting like a bullet. Tayoga, proud and defiant, questioned the credibility of the Ojibway's words against his own. Tandakora, the Ojibway, reached for his tomahawk, but the hunter's watchful eye prevented any sudden moves. Tayoga denied the accusations, stating they acted in self-defense against attackers. De Courcelles suggested the matter be taken to the Marquis Duquesne in Quebec for resolution. Tayoga, Robert, and Willet defended their innocence, refusing to be tried for crimes they didn't commit. Tandakora's hand tightened on his weapon, but the threat of retaliation from the hunter kept the peace. Jumonville intervened, promising justice from Onontio for any wrongs suffered. Robert noted the presence of St. Luc, indicating a change in course from their original mission to the vale of Onondaga.|"['1.

The hunter, after a fierce battle, assured his companions that the danger had passed. They continued their journey on the river, seeing distant smoke from campfires but paying it no mind. That night they camped by the river, and the next day they reached the St. Lawrence River. Willet pointed out that they were in Canada, where the French held long occupation. They planned to reach Montreal by night, get a bigger boat, and head to Quebec. They marveled at the vast river flowing toward the sea under a clear blue sky. Tayoga mentioned the wild tribes north of the Great Lakes trading furs. Willet shared stories of vast lakes beyond the Great Lakes, suggesting an unknown expanse across the continent.|['1.

"They paddled close to the southern shore, shielded by the tall banks from the strong wind. In the middle of the river, the water swelled like ocean waves, and a distant boat with rowers rocked violently. ""You're right, Tayoga. They've spotted us. Let's paddle out slowly along the shore,"" whispered Robert. With a few strokes, the canoe glided down the St. Lawrence near the calm waters on the southern side. The approaching boat seemed to be observing them, but Robert, Tayoga, and Willet remained composed, continuing their journey as if unperturbed by the large vessel's presence. As the boat drew closer, a young man in a white uniform hailed them in French and then English. He introduced himself as Louis de Galisonnière, a captain from the Languedoc battalion stationed in Montreal.

Robert quickly agreed to board de Galisonnière's boat, eager to impress the Captain and enjoy the safety and comfort it offered over the canoe. Willet and the Onondaga also consented, and soon they were all aboard the sturdy craft. Captain Louis de Galisonnière proved to be a gracious host, proud of his vessel, the _Frontenac_, named after a former Governor General of Canada. He shared French wine, but Tayoga declined, citing the harmful effects of alcohol on his people. De Galisonnière boasted about Quebec, a grand city he called impregnable, guarded by valiant troops. Tayoga, stoic as ever, mentioned the Mohawks' claim to the land. De Galisonnière praised the French Chevalier Raymond de St. Luc, a paragon of chivalry. As they sailed toward Montreal, de Galisonnière regaled them with tales of the St. Lawrence, Montreal, and Quebec's splendors, hoping to return there soon. Robert admired the Canadian landscape, observing the log houses and church steeples that dotted the shores.|"['1.

"""The church wields great power among us,"" de Galisonnière remarked, observing the strength of his companion's gaze. ""Our Canadian French find solace in it. Our patriotic priests stand as a force in our interactions with the Indians."" As they strolled through the streets of Hochelaga, de Galisonnière hinted at the looming war between England and France, a conflict that would extend to their colonies. He expressed his hope for his companion's safety on the battlefield. The canoe was entrusted to reliable hands for sale, as they planned to upgrade to a larger boat. Tayoga, adorned in the regal attire of an Onondaga chief, commanded attention, evoking both admiration and animosity from other indigenous groups. Despite the enmity directed at him, Tayoga remained unperturbed, embodying the spirit of the Hodenosaunee League. Willet noted the resentment towards Tayoga, especially from a formidable warrior named Tandakora, whose hostility was palpable. As they passed by, Tayoga's dignified indifference to Tandakora's presence further fueled the Ojibway warrior's animosity.

On a steep hill slope, the travelers found the inn recommended by de Galisonnière. Monsieur Jolivet, the innkeeper, welcomed them warmly, having hosted important guests before. He was eager to accommodate the trio, knowing they were trustworthy. Monsieur Jolivet offered to have their weapons kept safely, but Willet declined, showing his attachment to his rifle. The group soon encountered a young French-Canadian officer who inquired about their mission. With their credentials in order, they received assistance for their journey to Quebec. Later, the innkeeper treated them to a splendid supper in a garden with a breathtaking view.

"He talked openly about the native people as ""savages"" in front of Tayoga, knowing Tayoga would not consider himself that way. Willet had always treated the Hodenosaunee people as equals. He then collected their three rifles and placed them on the grass next to a path, admiring the vast view of mountains, forests, and rivers. Willet remarked on the contrast between their recent life-threatening situation and their current peaceful one. They were now dining elegantly at an inn in Montreal, enjoying a meal prepared by Lizette and Marie. Tayoga, having learned table manners in Albany, ate with precision.

A man of influence in Quebec, deeply involved in church councils and corresponding with the Pope himself, is not favored by many high officials in the city, including François Bigot, the Intendant. Despite the glamour of Quebec's court circle and the grand Chateau Bigot, there are underlying tensions and complexities. Father Drouillard expresses disapproval towards the lavish lifestyle of Count Jean de Mézy and Intendant Bigot. As Robert gazes at Quebec's stunning architecture and the Bourbon lilies adorning the city, he senses the fortress-like presence of the Old World.

No person from New York or New England could view it without a mix of strong feelings. It was like Carthage to their Rome. They admired it, yet they desired to conquer it. They believed that lasting safety could only come to the northern border if the Bourbon lilies stopped flying over the grand fortress that overlooked the St. Lawrence. Robert and Tayoga felt intense emotions, while de Galisonnière felt pleasure. Father Drouillard, with a different perspective, looked at Quebec with his own emotions. As the _Frontenac_ docked, Robert marveled at the immense strength of Quebec, admiring the earthworks and redoubts with heavy cannons.

Captain de Galisonnière suggested that they stay at the Inn of the Eagle in Upper Town, managed by Monsieur Berryer, a host as good as Monsieur Jolivet in Montreal. Robert thanked the captain for bringing them from Montreal and hoped to repay his kindness. As they bid farewell and headed up a steep street, Tayoga's proud demeanor caught attention. Robert understood Tayoga's feelings toward the French in Quebec. The city's mix of French, French-Canadians, soldiers, priests, civilians, and Indians fascinated him. The unique blend of people and architecture sparked his curiosity. They encountered a young man, de Mézy, known for his revels with Bigot, and Father Drouillard's disdain for him. Willet shared his respect for Father Drouillard, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect between different churches. They arrived at the Inn of the Eagle, where Monsieur Berryer welcomed them and shared news of the absent Governor General, Marquis Duquesne, returning soon.

Robert, Willet, and Tayoga secured a spacious room with three beds. They dressed in elegant three-cornered hats, coats, waistcoats, knee breeches, and buckled shoes, completing their attire with handsome small swords. Robert admired his reflection in a small mirror, feeling proud of his splendid outfit. Tayoga, however, remained true to his identity as a young Indian chief, embodying the spirit of the forest. Monsieur Berryer welcomed them to the dining room with oak floors and shelves adorned with china and glass.

At an inn, Robert and his companions were served by a quiet waiter. They were prepared for any challenge and aimed to uphold their people's honor. Although some were unfriendly, they remained vigilant. Robert hoped de Galisonnière would join, but it was a young man, Count Jean de Mézy, who entered with officers. De Mézy boasted about the French and belittled the English colonies, unaware that Robert and his friends understood French. When de Mézy insulted the English, Robert, unable to tolerate it, responded in French, surprising everyone. The Onondaga also shared wisdom in French, highlighting the folly of boasting.

""It's true, Tayoga. The Hodenosaunee chiefs are wise and great. They have witnessed much and remembered. They understand that speech is meant for conveying thoughts, not for making a mockery of oneself.""

An angry outburst interrupted as de Mézy and his companions reacted with contempt. Monsieur Berryer, attempting to intervene, quietly moved aside to avoid the escalating conflict in his inn. Tayoga continued, ""In our village, when a man speaks foolishly like a jay bird, the chiefs don't send warriors but hand him to the old women to beat sense into him.""

Robert, with remarkable eloquence, apologized for the lack of acquaintance and proposed a duel with de Mézy, who was provoked by Robert's words but eventually agreed to the duel with small swords at sunrise the next day.

"""We have beds here at the Inn of the Eagle,"" stated Robert calmly, displaying more confidence in his speech. ""You can send your seconds this evening to see mine, and they will arrange everything. I prefer small swords, and I hope that suits you."" ""It is my choice too,"" replied de Mézy, eyeing his opponent with intrigue. De Mézy was surprised by Robert's composure, unusual for a young American unaccustomed to swordplay. Doubts crossed his mind about Robert's skill with a sword, but he dismissed them quickly. Despite feeling dismissed, de Mézy lingered with his companions to observe the unfolding events. Meanwhile, Tayoga engaged Robert in a game using elk's horn buttons and beans.

Monsieur Berryer's eyes were wide as Robert deliberately spoke. Robert aimed to impress Jean de Mézy with his swordsmanship. The innkeeper, acknowledging the trouble, mentioned the power of Count Jean de Mézy and his connection to Monsieur Bigot. Robert assured Monsieur Berryer that they could handle themselves and suggested retiring for the night. Only a few men remained in the inn, likely friendly individuals known as honnêtes gens. Robert considered speaking to them but refrained. Instead, he proposed a walk before the seconds of de Mézy arrived. As they strolled through the streets, Robert's admiration for Quebec grew.

Lennox requested Captain de Galisonnière to be his second in the duel with de Mézy, seeking peace over war. The captain agreed and promised to bring a trustworthy friend, Armand Glandelet.

Nemours took a step back, and Robert was determined not to let de Mézy's offer go to waste.

De Mézy started to fight back, his breath getting shorter as he gasped. His cheeks turned red, and fear consumed him. Even though he had fought and laughed before, he had never faced such a skilled swordsman as the young man from the woods. Nemours and Le Moyne grew pale, realizing their leader was struggling against the strong opponent. The youth seemed to outmatch de Mézy, effortlessly breaking his defense.

In the evening, two new guests arrived at the Inn of the Eagle, Colonel de Courcelles and Captain de Jumonville. Monsieur Berryer showed them great respect as they had been on an expedition for King Louis. Robert, Tayoga, and Willet were having dinner when the Frenchmen entered. Despite his distrust, Robert greeted them politely. The Frenchmen suggested delivering their urgent letters to Monsieur Bigot instead of the absent Marquis Duquesne. Robert, wary of their intentions, declined, not wanting to risk giving the letters to the wrong person. The conversation shifted to Paris, a city both Robert and de Courcelles admired. De Courcelles invited them to meet Monsieur Bigot later, but Robert politely refused. Afterward, de Courcelles and Jumonville left to report to the garrison commandant, and the three friends retired for the night. Tayoga, feeling uneasy about Quebec's history with his people, stayed vigilant, remembering the conflicts between the Hodenosaunee and the French.|"['1.

Tayoga, a young warrior of the forest, found himself in Quebec, a city heavy with an unfamiliar air. While the European ways intrigued his companions, Tayoga remained unmoved. He sensed a plot brewing between the French colonel, de Courcelles, and the Ojibway, Tandakora. Vigilant, Tayoga observed their secretive meeting from a window, the cold north wind a welcome contrast to the city's stifling atmosphere. When the Ojibway slipped away, Tayoga decided to keep watch, determined to uncover their conspiracy. The next morning, a dinner invitation from the Intendant of Canada diverted their attention from the city's intrigue. Despite Robert's eagerness for adventure, Willet cautioned against drawing unnecessary attention.

The Intendant held significant power in Canada, overseeing courts, finance, commerce, and civil matters. De Courcelles and Jumonville, favorites of Bigot, were to be approached cautiously due to their influence. After much consideration, Robert and his companions decided to explore Quebec during the day.

"The night was dark as the three in the carriage neared the palace. Torches lit the way, with a crowd gathered to watch the lavish entertainments of François Bigot.

He spoke in a very proud way, and when he finished, he looked boldly at everyone around the table, then sat down in a deep silence. The French guests understood that he was issuing a challenge not just to them, but also to the English if the Hodenosaunee rights were not respected. The speech appealed to their brave instincts. After a brief silence, applause erupted. Robert wanted to reply that the English were included out of courtesy as friends of the Hodenosaunee, but he held back. The conversation resumed with music playing in the background. A man across the table, with a fierce appearance, spoke provocatively to Robert. The youth, respecting his sworn brother Tayoga, responded about the power of the Hodenosaunee. The man subsided into silence, and a meaningful look passed between them, making Robert alert.

"It was done by Mr. Willet, as you see, sir, and if ever a man had justification he has it.

Tayoga, a wise chief, found peace in the harmony of his beliefs. He saw no difference between Manitou and God, praying to both. As dawn broke, he felt a kinship with the forest creatures. Protecting them, he embraced the beauty of his wilderness home. Alert to danger, Tayoga thwarted attackers, ensuring his friends' rest. The trio continued their journey, learning of escalating tensions between English and French forces. Despite the looming conflict, they pressed on, relieved to find their canoe for a smoother voyage ahead. Willet foresaw the inevitable clash, doubting diplomatic efforts.

Robert and his companions embarked on a grand canoe journey. The vessel was larger and more luxurious than the one they had previously used. Tayoga, the Onondaga, skillfully paddled against the river's current, allowing Robert and Willet to relax and enjoy the ride. They spotted distant smoke signals from potentially hostile Canadian Indians but chose to press on towards their destination, the Long House in the vale of the Onondaga. Robert pondered the Chevalier de St. Luc, a Frenchman he admired, and looked forward to matching wits with him in front of the Iroquois chiefs. As they stopped for a meal, Tayoga ventured into the woods and swiftly caught a deer to replenish their dwindling food supplies. The group settled by a fire to cook supper, eager to continue their journey.|"[""1.

"""We're nearing Hodenosaunee lands,"" he mentioned, ""but the warriors haven't been around. The outlying bands have returned to Canada or moved west into the Ohio region. This area is deserted.""

""Still, we need to be cautious, Tayoga,"" the hunter advised. ""That savage, Tandakora, is after our scalps. I don't want to be a target just before a war.""

That night they dressed as much deer meat as they could carry. The next day they entered Lake Champlain, displaying its finest colors. The waters shimmered in blue, green, and silver as the skies shifted, and the mountains were cloaked in dark green. Robert marveled at the grand lake, over a hundred miles long, set amidst magnificent scenery. The lake held stories and legends, used by generations of Indians as a route between north and south, a path of peace and war.

""It's our lake,"" said Robert, determined. ""We can't let the French take it. If we lose this lake, we might lose the war.""

""We don't yet control Champlain,"" the hunter cautioned. ""The French claim it, and they're advancing towards Lake Saint Sacrement, which we call George. We need to be watchful.""

Tayoga, in his scholarly tone, added, ""We must be vigilant. The French and their allies may be here. We're just three in a canoe.""

The water churned into huge waves, threatening to capsize the canoe. The three occupants skillfully maneuvered with their paddles, narrowly escaping disaster. As the wind howled and the storm raged, they fought to keep the canoe steady against the violent elements. Lightning illuminated the dark sky, while thunder boomed like cannons. Seeking refuge, they found a cove, sheltered by the shore and dense woods. Huddling under the canoe, they weathered the storm as rain poured down. After an hour, the tempest subsided, leaving behind a serene landscape. As they resumed their journey, they spotted a large Indian canoe pursuing them. With a dozen warriors closing in, they paddled with all their might, knowing that their lives depended on it.|['1.

"""Don't lose your temper,"" he said. ""We've escaped tight spots before. Our rifles will speak for us."" After a war whoop, the warriors paddled expertly, closing in on their prey. The sky darkened, lightning flashed, and the wind picked up. As the storm hit, they fired, hitting one warrior. The long canoe pressed on, but the storm slowed them all. They chose a risky path, aiming to land behind the long canoe. Skillfully navigating the rough waters, they reached safety, hiding on a wooded hill. Exhausted, they waited out the storm, then continued on, dry rifles in hand. The lake sparkled in the light as the long canoe drifted south, and Tayoga chuckled."|"['1.

"""They rage and seek us in vain,"" he said. ""They will continue pursuing us to the south. They do not know that Manitou sent the second storm especially to cover us up with a darkness in which we might escape.""

""So will I,"" said Robert, and the Onondaga nodded his own concurrence. They took off their garments, wrung the water out of them, and hung them on the bushes to dry, a task soon to be accomplished by the sun that now came out hot and bright. Meanwhile, they debated their further course.

""But they will hunt along the shore a long time,"" said Willet. ""They're nothing but a tiny speck now, and in a quarter of an hour they'll be out of sight altogether. Suppose we cross the lake behind them--I think I see a cove down there on the western side--take the canoe with us and wait until they go back again.""

In another hour, their deerskins were dry, and reclothing themselves, they returned the canoe to the lake, the Hurons still being invisible. Then they crossed in haste, reached the cove that Willet had seen, and plunged into the deep woods, taking the canoe with them, and hiding their trail carefully. When they had gone a full three miles, they came to rest in a glade, and every one of the three felt that it was time.

Tayoga nodded, and the three, although hampered somewhat by their packs, began a slow approach through the bushes. Half the distance, and Tayoga, who was in advance, putting his finger upon his lips, sank almost flat. Placing his fingers to his lips, he blew between them a soft and low but penetrating note. A half minute later, a similar note came from a point in the dense bush about a hundred yards away. Then Tayoga blew a shorter note, and as before, the reply came, exactly the same. The three stayed motionless and silent, but soon the bushes shook, and four tall Mohawk warriors emerged. The youngest and tallest spoke, recognizing Tayoga. The Mohawks were few, but they were determined to face the Hurons and Caughnawagas who were encroaching on their territory. Daganoweda, the Mohawk chief, led the way towards the source of the smoke. Robert and the hunter felt compelled to join the Mohawks in the battle. Daganoweda's band quickly approached the enemy, engaging in a forest struggle. The Hurons and Caughnawagas were defeated, fleeing the scene, leaving casualties behind. Two Mohawks sustained minor injuries. Tayoga, examining the trail, suddenly raised his head and spoke.|"['1.

"""They thought we were close, planning to trap us,"" Willet said. ""Daganoweda, your Mohawks arrived just in time. Are the smoke rings from the second fire still rising? They can't hear our rifles from here."" Tayoga replied, ""Only one or two rings rise now. They wonder what's happening since no reply. Look how those rings wander away and vanish, as if useless, with no more following."" Daganoweda, the leader, agreed with the hunter's advice, setting up an ambush. The second band, equal to the first, cautiously approached, then swiftly retreated with two wounded, thinking the enemy strong, leaving the Mohawk chieftain victorious. Robert felt satisfaction, knowing the French-led hostile Indians invading Hodenosaunee territory could strengthen the alliance with the English. St. Luc wouldn't be part of such treachery. Robert praised the English's friendship, evoking memories of Frontenac, igniting the Mohawks' anger. Willet mentioned their journey to Onondaga, where St. Luc would speak for the French, and Dagaeoga for the English. Dagaeoga's eloquence impressed, ready to debate St. Luc in Onondaga."""|"['1.

They found the main trail, _waagwenneyu_, and moved quickly. The following day, six Mohawks from Ganegahaga joined them near the Mohawk river. They continued with speed, venturing into the heart of the Hodenosaunee's land. Robert marveled at the vast forests, blue lakes, silver rivers, and countless creeks. The land was rich, and he understood why the Iroquois protected it fiercely. Robert began to think like the Iroquois, feeling a connection to their ways. As they journeyed, he realized the significance of the impending battle on their land. The Hodenosaunee needed to decide their course of action. The journey was smooth, with no storms, abundant game, and blooming flowers. Near the valley, they met Oneidas and received news from an Onondaga runner. St. Luc and Dubois were in Onondaga, earning the respect of the Hodenosaunee. The council was delayed due to the Maple Dance festival. The group moved swiftly through the beautiful land, filled with the spirit of the Hodenosaunee. They gazed at the valley of Onondaga, a peaceful and picturesque scene.|['1.

"""Daganoweda spoke solemnly, 'We stand before the dawn,' he said. 'We may not see the Maple Dance again for many years. War looms over the Hodenosaunee. When spring returns, the fate of the great League will be uncertain. We are but children, ignorant of what Manitou holds for us.'

Robert overheard, glad for the bond formed with the Mohawks. He understood the gravity of the crisis, knowing the Hodenosaunee's decision could shape the coming war's outcome. The group reached Onondaga's vale, where Tayoga, Willet, and Robert parted ways temporarily.

In the Iroquois mythology, Gaoh was an old man with a bent figure and a weazened face, imprisoned by Manitou in the west. Gaoh's struggles for freedom caused gentle breezes or fierce storms. Tayoga spoke of the Three Sisters - spirits of Corn, Squash, and Bean, guardians of abundance. The spirits of nature surrounded them, symbolizing elements and powers. Tayoga whistled, and fourteen tall, keen-eyed sachems emerged. The great chief Tododaho welcomed Tayoga, Robert, and Willet. Robert expressed his deep respect for the Hodenosaunee's prosperity. The chiefs' approval uplifted him. The trio bowed to the council fire keepers and retired to the Long House, guided by young warriors.

On the walls of the house, there were platforms where warriors slept on furs and skins. Overhead, a bark canopy held their possessions. About a dozen warriors greeted the three visitors. Berths were assigned, food and water provided. Robert, tired from the journey, decided to sleep. Tayoga left, and Robert and Willet soon fell asleep on the bark platforms. The next morning, they found the valley more excited. Tayoga informed them about the upcoming council of repentance. The sachems of the Onondagas and allied nations gathered in the council grove. The Mohawks were called first, followed by the Onondagas, Senecas, Oneidas, Cayugas, and Tuscaroras. The Onondagas were priests of the Hodenosaunee, and Tododaho led the council.

"""But little will be done today,"" Tayoga remarked. ""It is just a preliminary, similar to what you call at the Albany school. The significant meeting will follow the Maple Dance, revealing the Hodenosaunee's stance in the upcoming conflict."" Robert turned and faced St. Luc. Knowing the chevalier was around the vale of Onondaga, he had neglected this fact due to his focus on the Iroquois rituals. Now, he acknowledged that he had come to confront the Frenchman and measure his abilities. Despite this, he felt a sense of relief upon encountering St. Luc's open and cheerful demeanor.

The three friends became five as St. Luc and Dubois were warmly welcomed into their group. Dubois, the quieter of the two, seemed to see himself as St. Luc's shadow. The following day, the group witnessed a religious ceremony where confessions were made in the council grove before the Maple Dance. Tododaho, a respected figure, spoke about repentance and the need to do better in the future. Robert noticed similarities between this sermon and those he heard in his Protestant upbringing. The ceremony was moving, especially when Tododaho asked for forgiveness, passing a white wampum belt around for others to confess. The day ended with a grand banquet, athletic games, and the Feather Dance. Despite their differences, Robert and St. Luc found common ground and a growing friendship. Their shared courage, optimism, and chivalry bonded them, with Willet and Tayoga silently approving.|['1.

Robert and the hunter conversed on the third morning after their arrival. Robert suggested showing hostility towards St. Luc, who aimed to thwart their plans. The hunter disagreed, emphasizing that their enmity was with St. Luc's nation, not him. He advocated for fair dealings and potential friendship between Robert and St. Luc. Meanwhile, the festival continued, and Corlear and Onontio's agents faced delays. The sachems remained silent, foreseeing a looming conflict between France and England that would embroil their colonies. Reports from various sources hinted at war preparations in Albany, Massachusetts, and Virginia, while Quebec and Montreal brimmed with military activity. The sachems, aware of the impending storm, deliberated cautiously. On the fourth night, Father Philibert Drouillard, a French missionary, arrived, aiming to sway the Onondagas to support France.

Robert remembered that some Onondagas had converted to Catholicism, a detail he had forgotten. He realized that Father Drouillard, supporting France, would be a strong ally against him. Robert, Mr. Willet, and the Chevalier de St. Luc were waiting to address the council of fifty sachems. Robert hoped Father Drouillard wouldn't see him as an enemy but as someone trying to help his country. Despite religious and national differences, Father Drouillard assured Robert they were not enemies. The French army and church's close bond became evident, influencing some Onondagas. Father Drouillard's influence was strong, especially among converts. The Mohawks, except for one, rejected the French influence due to past conflicts.

The speaker focused less on the friendship with the English and more on the enmity with the French.

He painted a grim picture of French victory, predicting the destruction of the Hodenosaunee nations. The Mohawk sachems erupted in a rare display of emotion, reflecting the crowd's growing support. The orator warned of the French's true intentions, revealing a tomahawk stained with the blood of an Onondaga killed by the French ally, Tandakora.
