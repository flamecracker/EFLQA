"""Dad, it doesn't matter. It was still a wire. But let's not focus on that now. Later, I might want to send photos through a wire. What I'm aiming for is to create a device so that when you use a phone booth to talk to a friend, you can both see each other on a special plate attached to the phone.""

""Somewhat, yes. I'll likely use a metal plate instead of glass. It'll be like talking on a phone in an open field, where you can see each other.""

""I haven't fully decided. I might use selenium, a metal sensitive to light, as it can be a good or poor conductor based on light exposure. A photo is just lights and shadows on light-sensitive paper.""

"""That feels better,"" said the birdman, as he stretched out on a couch. ""Now if you can look my machine over, and tell me what's the matter with it, I'll be much obliged to you, and I'll get on my way.""

""Not quite so fast as that!"" laughed Tom. ""I wouldn't want to see you start off with your lame leg, and certainly I would not want to see you use your aircraft after what she's gone through, until we've given her a test. You can't tell what part you might have strained.""

""Now you needn't do anything of the kind,"" spoke Tom, hospitably. ""We've got lots of room here, and for that matter we have plenty of autos and airships, too, as well as a motor boat. You just rest yourself here. Later, we'll look over your craft.""

After dinner, when Mr. Halling said he felt much better, Tom agreed to go out with him and look at the airship. As he feared, he found several things the matter with it, in addition to the motor trouble which had been the cause for Mr. Halling's call on the young inventor.

""Well, I'll be glad to do that, for I know she will be all the better when you get through with her. But I think I am able to go on home now, and I really ought to. There is some business I must attend to.""

As they spoke, the airship's motor grew louder. Dark figures involved in the scuffle with Koku hurried toward the airship, now moving on bicycle wheels across the grass, ready to ascend. Six men boarded the airship, leaving only two behind. Those two, stunned by Koku, eventually rose and disappeared into the dark. Tom and Ned followed them, but the dense foliage made it impossible to track them. The airship vanished into the night sky, leaving no trace. Disappointed, they returned to Koku, who was still processing the events. Tom suggested searching inside for clues. The intruders had broken in, swiftly taking the airship. Tom acknowledged the situation and focused on recovering the stolen craft. Koku didn't recognize the men, leaving them with no leads.
