Mr. Rover had urged the boys to avoid danger, knowing they had faced peril before. Unaware of the adventures ahead, they invited an old schoolmate, Larry Colby, who knew the lakes well. Unable to join immediately, Larry would meet them in Sandusky later. Accompanying the boys was Alexander Pop, their loyal servant and friend. The boys planned an exciting trip, starting at Cleveland, then Sandusky, and onward to Detroit through various lakes. The _Swallow_, a sturdy yacht, was chartered for six weeks. The journey began smoothly with fishing and music from Aleck Pop's banjo. But as the wind picked up, signaling a storm, the boys' excitement turned to concern as they sailed towards Cleveland.|"['1.

Tom shouted for help as a strange sound and a jolt shook the boat, causing chaos. With lanterns in hand, Tom and Sam rushed to the deck to see Dick missing. Tom threw a life-preserver into the stormy sea and lit rockets to search for Dick. The storm raged on, drenching them all. At dawn, the storm calmed, but Dick was still missing, and they anxiously scanned the waters. Amidst the chaos, the crew tried to keep warm and dry, knowing that finding Dick was crucial. The tense situation tested their courage and unity as they faced the unknown.|"['1.

"At 7:30, Tom saw smoke on the horizon. ""I bet it's a steamship,"" he told his brother. It turned out to be the freighter, _Captain Rallow_, traveling between Detroit and Buffalo. As the ship neared, they called out to it. Tom explained they were caught off guard, and it was too dark to see much. The freight captain listened intently. Tom worried about Arnold Baxter, a dangerous enemy to their family. He and Sam were distressed. Tom recalled their past clashes with Baxter at Putnam Hall. Suddenly, a chain on the raft broke, scattering lumber. A lumberman in his forties with a black beard and a loud voice joined Dick. He looked surprised at the situation."|['1.

The lumberman heard Dick's tale with interest. The story was short and often interrupted by high waves that nearly swept them into the lake. They clung to lumber and chains, strained but holding. By around two in the morning, the storm peaked. Waves crashed over the raft, testing their strength. Suddenly, the chains snapped, and the lumber began to drift apart. In the chaos, the lumberman clung to a log, warning Dick. Dick struggled to hold on, fearing for his life. The storm raged on, with timber crashing all around. As the sun rose, Dick, exhausted and delirious, slipped into the water. Weak and hopeless, he thought it was the end until he heard a cry, a mix of reality and imagination. They had recovered from past injuries and were now heading East for a new scheme against the Rovers.|['1.

"Dan was in the coach, holding poor Dick. Arnold Baxter joined and shut the door. The coach moved from the water front towards the hotel. ""No vacant rooms,"" Arnold said, returning. ""I might take him to a private hospital,"" he suggested. The coach driver was asked about Dr. Karley's place. The coach continued to Dr. Karley's Private Sanitarium. Arnold Baxter rang the bell at the old-fashioned building surrounded by a high fence. ""A young friend almost drowned,"" Arnold explained to Dr. Karley, requesting care for a day or two.

Arnold Baxter had all his savings on him, a bit over three thousand dollars, from his failed West expedition. Determined to bring the Rovers to justice, he planned to use every dollar. He aimed to seize Dick Rover, then force Anderson Rover to hand over rights to the Eclipse mine. Arnold found a schooner, the _Peacock_, and hired it for a month, with a crew, for a thousand dollars. Despite their fears of the Rovers foiling their scheme, they managed to get Dick on board. Arnold disguised himself with a wig and beard, while Dan hid in the carriage. They struggled to find the _Peacock_ and get Dick on board unnoticed. Captain Langless planned to set sail at dawn. Meanwhile, the Rovers searched for Dick, but the police found no leads. Arnold escaped, leaving the horse to run towards Dr. Karley's institution.|"['1.

Arnold Baxter, realizing the consequences of capture, ran towards the dock where the _Peacock_ was moored. The doctor, hesitant but allowing entry, expressed concern about Arnold's actions. Dr. Karley, feeling innocent, showed Tom around the sanitarium, denying any involvement in Dick's disappearance. Meanwhile, Luke Peterson, recovering from his injuries, received aid from Tom and others on deck. Pursuing the _Peacock_, the _Swallow_ set sail northwest. Luke shared details of Arnold Baxter's whereabouts, confirming Dick's presence on the schooner. The Baxters, familiar to the Rovers, awaited the arrival of their unsuspecting friends near the dock.|"['1.

Tom found himself on deck, feeling the danger in the air. As he moved towards the cabin, ill-looking sailors stared but stayed silent as ordered by the captain. Arnold Baxter, armed, leaped at Tom from behind, while Dan attacked from the front. Handcuffed and led to the hold, Tom cried for help that Sam heard. Despite Sam's protests, he too was handcuffed and thrown into the dark hold. Meanwhile, Aleck managed the sails on the _Swallow_ as Peterson drank from the medicine chest. Night fell over Lake Erie, with the _Peacock_ and _Swallow_ sailing apart. Peterson feared losing sight of the _Peacock_ in the dark. The boys struggled in their bonds, and rats briefly caused chaos before disappearing.|['1.

The storm and their many adventures had exhausted the boys, and one by one, they fell into a light sleep. The rest did wonders for all of them, especially Dick, who felt almost back to normal upon waking. Quietly, he entered the cabin to find it empty, with breakfast leftovers on the table. He grabbed some bread and boiled eggs. Everyone gathered in the compartment and quickly ate. Tom discovered a bunch of keys in an adjacent stateroom. As they heard Captain Langless approaching, the boys hurried to the hold door and were surprised by Arnold Baxter and Dan. Baxter urged them to surrender, outnumbered ten to three. The situation was tense with rough sailors joining in. Arnold and Dan retreated, leaving the boys feeling uneasy. Captain Langless offered a truce, promising fair treatment if they surrendered. Despite the circumstances, the boys' bravery impressed him, and he saw a chance for a peaceful resolution.|"['1.

"Captain Langless responded, ""You will be treated as such. Come into the cabin and stack those weapons in the corner. They were never meant for anything but wall decorations,"" and he chuckled nervously. The sailors left, and the owner of the Peacock sat down near the door, looking somewhat relieved. Arnold Baxter then appeared. ""I think we've gained a point,"" Dick remarked. ""It's good to be treated decently, even as prisoners. The question is, how long will we be confined on this schooner?"" The boys' appetites were hearty as the cook brought coffee and food. They enjoyed the sunshine on deck. The Peacock sailed swiftly on Lake Erie towards the Detroit River. Dan Baxter approached them but couldn't cause trouble per Captain Langless' orders. At noon, they dined with the captain, discussing the Baxters' criminal past.

Captain Langless's eyes sparkled at the mention of a thousand dollars. The sum, though modest, piqued his interest. Having already received three hundred dollars from Arnold Baxter, he pondered the potential for more. If he could secure a total of thirteen hundred dollars and safely exit the situation, it could be a success. Tom reluctantly agreed to go along, insisting on taking dessert. As they settled in the hold, the captain locked them in. The brothers, hopeful of winning over the captain, dined on rice pudding in the dim light. Hours passed with no significant developments. They heard passing vessels and the _Peacock_ anchoring near the Detroit River. A surprise greeted them upon waking - a tray of food, water, and reading material. As time passed, they pondered their circumstances, unable to reach the hatchway to escape.|"[""1.

As night approached, a noise at the door startled the trio. Expecting the Baxters or Captain Langless, they were surprised to see the cook from the schooner, accompanied by two sailors, bearing trays of food. Tom, fueled by a desire to escape, hurled a water pitcher at the mate, knocking him down. Seizing the opportunity, the boys sprang into action, taking the sailors by surprise. Tom bravely engaged the men, while Dick and Sam swiftly followed. In a spontaneous act of bravery, they overpowered the sailors and made a break for the cabin. Despite the sailors' protests, the boys raced up the companion way to freedom. Sam suggested swimming to safety, and without hesitation, they plunged into the water, outsmarting their captors. With quick thinking and teamwork, the Rover boys outwitted their adversaries and made a daring escape to the nearest dock.|['1.

Sam was almost tired, his wet clothes weighing him down. He thought of diving, but it was risky. Half-conscious, he managed to get on the boat with Tom. The mate tried to explain, but Captain Lawless was in a hurry. They set sail towards Lake Huron, covering 75 to 80 miles. The captain was worried about being caught. Later, the mate and sailors shared a story of a fight with the boys. The captain, remembering his talk with the Rovers, saw a chance for compromise. A tug was hailed for a quick tow to Port Huron. Meanwhile, Dick, unaware of his brothers' capture, was hit by a lighter and taken to the hospital. He planned to inform the authorities, but it was too late. Captain Langless had a head start of thirty-six hours, leaving their pursuers behind.|"[""1.

"""We are puzzled,"" sighed Dick when news arrived from Port Huron that the _Peacock_ had already passed that point. ""The schooner has the whole of Lake Huron ahead, and who knows where it will head. Maybe the Baxters will end up in Canada.""""Ah, that's a concern, Rover. The lake is vast, with over twenty-five hundred islands. It's a perfect hiding spot for a ship, right?""""I'll rent one. I've wired my dad for the money,"" Dick said truthfully. Larry Colby was informed too.""I know the perfect steam tug,"" Larry assured. The _Rocket_ was found, and a deal was made with Jack Parsons.

When the pair arrived at the _Rocket_, they held a meeting and agreed to set off for Needle Point Island the next morning. Jack estimated the journey would take five to six hours. Eager to follow up on the information he received, Dick had a restless night. While waiting for news from his father, Dick learned unsettling news from Larry about Mrs. Stanhope and her daughter Dora. They discussed Josiah Crabtree, recently released from prison, and his suspicious behavior towards the Stanhopes. The next morning, the group boarded the _Rocket_, a tugboat with a young and armed crew. They sailed towards Needle Point Island, but Dick's excitement was overshadowed by his worry for his brothers. As they neared the island, the tension rose, and the boys found themselves in a perilous situation on a schooner, bound and unable to move.|['1.

Time was not a concern as they finally cracked the issue. Initially, Tom held the jug for Sam to drink, followed by the youngest Rover doing the same for his brother. The water, although warm and somewhat stale, tasted sweeter than anything they could recall. After consuming half the jug, they saved the rest for later. The _Peacock_ sailed at a speed of seven or eight knots, with the creaking blocks indicating the urgency to reach their destination. Hours passed, and hunger loomed until Captain Langless arrived with Arnold Baxter, offering bread and beef stew. The prisoners, Tom and Sam, devoured the meal. Led ashore to Needle Point, an island surrounded by cedar trees, they trudged through a rocky path. Uneasy but curious, they followed Captain Langless into the island's interior.|"['1.

They found a cliff jutting out from the hill, with rocks forming a steep wall over 30 feet high. At the bottom, there was a spring and a small pool. Next to the spring, there was a cave-like opening partly blocked by brush. Suddenly, the captain fired two shots, hitting a snake that had coiled around Sam's leg. The group hurried into the cave, which was about 15 feet wide, high, and 200 feet long. Inside, there was evidence that the cave had been used as a meeting place. A fireplace, old boxes, and an overcoat hung on a stick were visible. The captain suggested making a fire to make the cave more comfortable. He instructed the mate to bring blankets and supplies from the ship. Tom and Sam were left in the cave under guard while the others discussed plans.|"[""1.

The mate of the schooner agreed to help the boys escape. He wanted them to promise not to tell Captain Langless if the plan failed. That night, the mate would prepare a small boat for their getaway. Once ready, they would use the boat to reach the mainland. The boys engaged the mate in conversation to distract him. Suddenly, they pretended to spot a snake, causing the mate to turn around. Seizing the opportunity, the boys disarmed the mate and aimed the gun at him. After the encounter, they continued their journey through the woods, eventually reaching the shore. There, they saw a ship anchored in the bay to the west. Excited by the find, they cautiously approached the beach, navigating through the wet and boggy terrain.|"['1.

Hiding behind a bush, the boys observed a ship where a man and a lady were conversing. The lady sat in an easy-chair while the man leaned on a railing. The boys crept closer to overhear the conversation. Mrs. Stanhope seemed troubled, mentioning a vow she made never to attend the man's wedding. The man, Josiah Crabtree, spoke harshly about the Rovers, blaming them for ruining his plans. Mrs. Stanhope expressed her confusion, torn between Dora's advice and Mr. Crabtree's influence. Despite feeling weak, she struggled with conflicting emotions. The boys listened intently, intrigued by the unfolding drama on the ship.|"['1.

The situation was clear. Tom accused Mr. Crabtree of trying to manipulate Mrs. Stanhope into marrying him to access Dora's trust fund. Tom wanted to avoid a public scandal and urged Mr. Crabtree to leave the Stanhopes alone. Mr. Crabtree, feeling thwarted, reluctantly agreed. Tom and Sam showed their determination by brandishing a pistol and an iron bar. As the situation escalated, the tugboat experienced mechanical issues, causing a commotion. Eventually, the boys found themselves in a cave after a sudden collapse in the ground. Larry's ankle was injured, but they managed to treat it with water. Determined to explore, Dick and Peterson ventured further into the dark cave while Larry stayed behind to tend to the fire and his injury.|"[""1.

"Not far ahead, the cave split into two paths. Dick went right, and Peterson went left. Dick held a torch and a pistol for protection. As they explored, they found signs of past human habitation: an old bag, a sailor's cap, and a rusty pistol. Dust covered a map with strange markings and letters. Their torch dimmed, so Dick called for Peterson. Together, they discovered a chamber with dusty boxes and casks. Opening one box, they found canned vegetables, another had dress goods, and a cask held ""Cognac."" They found a hidden opening that led them outside. Returning to Larry, who had injured his ankle, they planned to capture the ship Peacock. Peterson wanted to pursue, but Dick advised waiting for daylight.

It was a challenging task to find the way back to the treasure cave, and they got lost several times. Upon returning, the dense bushes made it hard to locate Larry, so they had to call out to him. Suddenly, a bright light was illuminated on the schooner, revealing the crew to Captain Langless. Josiah Crabtree, unsure if Tom was teasing him, searched for a life preserver, proving wiser than expected. As the wind shifted, the ship's structure groaned, prompting frantic actions by the crew. Despite the old ship's deteriorating condition, the Canadians managed skillfully. With the ship taking on water, everyone prepared for the worst. The sailors navigated the sinking ship to shore, and Josiah Crabtree finally reached safety on land.|"[""1.

The Canadian placed the longest plank from the boat to the shore, creating a makeshift bridge. Josiah Crabtree, looking bedraggled, crawled ashore. The boys, now safe, realized they were hungry and enjoyed a meal with Mrs. Stanhope. Crabtree had to eat with the sailors. Tom warned him not to bother Mrs. Stanhope or use hypnotism. After supper, the boys took turns watching and sleeping in a stateroom. Tom chatted with the Canadian sailor, learning about his honest nature. The boat was stuck in the mud, and repairs were impossible. Crabtree thought the boat was bewitched. He rushed to inform Tom about the situation. The Baxters and Crabtree left the boys tied up and went to assess the boat's condition. Arnold Baxter was disappointed with the damage and the repairs needed.

After the Baxters disappeared, Josiah Crabtree spoke with Mrs. Stanhope and stationed the Canadians to watch for passing ships.

A sloop with a friendly crew approached, explaining their boat sank. Tom warned the crew about Arnold Baxter's criminal past.
