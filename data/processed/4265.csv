In ancient times, there were two princes, Acrisius and Proetus, who were twins. They lived in Argos, a beautiful valley in Hellas. Despite having everything they needed to be happy, they were miserable because they were envious of each other. They quarreled from the moment they were born, each trying to take the other's share of the kingdom. A prophet warned Acrisius that his own blood would rise against him, and his daughter, Danae, would have a son who would bring about his downfall. Fearful but unrepentant, Acrisius imprisoned Danae and her son in a brass-lined cavern and cast them into the sea.

They drifted aimlessly on the vast sea, the chest bobbing gently on the waves while the exhausted mother cradled her sleeping baby. She sang a soothing lullaby to her child, hoping for a better tomorrow. As the endless sea surrounded them, Danae's eyes searched desperately for land, but none appeared. Hunger gnawed at her, tears streaked her face, yet the horizon remained barren. Finally, fatigue overcame her, and she drifted into a troubled sleep. Suddenly, a jarring noise awoke her. A tall, majestic man appeared, casting a net over Danae and the chest, drawing them to safety. Grateful and fearful, Danae pleaded for mercy, revealing her royal lineage. The kind stranger welcomed her and her son, Perseus, into his home, offering them shelter and kindness. Years passed, and Perseus grew into a remarkable young man, known for his bravery and skills.

Perseus embarked on a remarkable journey with his winged sandals guiding him swiftly. He traveled over land and sea, untouched by water. His path led him to the Unshapen Land, a desolate place where the everlasting night reigned. There, he encountered the three Grey Sisters, shrouded in cold and loneliness. These sisters, lost in the past, sought to regain their sight and hunger for flesh. Perseus, seeing their pride and folly, pitied them no more. He outwitted them, taking their eye and tooth, and learned of his next destination. Heading southward towards Atlas the Giant, he was advised to seek the Hesperides. Perseus journeyed on, leaving the icy land behind, greeted by the sea's creatures and the sweet songs of the sea nymphs. Day by day, he soared over the waves until he spotted the rose-red mountain of Atlas, the bearer of heavens and earth. As he approached, the voices of the Nymphs filled the air, inviting him to join their eternal dance around the golden-fruited tree guarded by Ladon, the ancient dragon. Perseus, unable to understand their words, watched in wonder, ready to embrace the mysteries that awaited him in this enchanted garden.|['1.

Perseus and the Nymphs sought the help of the giant Atlas to find the Gorgon. Atlas, holding the heavens and earth apart, directed them towards the hat of darkness needed to approach the Gorgons. The giant's nieces, being immortal, retrieved the hat from the depths of Hades. Perseus promised to show Atlas Medusa's head upon his return, fulfilling the giant's wish to be turned to stone.

Once his ears were opened, Perseus heard the gentle sound of running water. His heart filled with hope as he saw a beautiful glen with marble rocks, date trees, and a lush green lawn. A streamlet meandered through the lawn and disappeared into the sand. Perseus drank from the cool water, ate dates, and rested on the grass. Refreshed, he soared through the night like an eagle, witnessing the wonders of Egypt below him. As he descended, he encountered the hardworking people of Egypt tending to their fields with skill. Mistaking him for an immortal, they offered him food and fruit. But Perseus, a hero of the Greeks, declined and continued on his quest. In another part of the story, Perseus encounters Andromeda, a maiden chained to a rock as a sacrifice to a sea monster. Andromeda, innocent and frightened, tells Perseus her tragic tale.

Andromeda gazed at Perseus with new hope as he stood proudly with her, holding a glittering sword. She wept, questioning why he, so young and noble, should face death. Despite her plea, she pointed to the sea, signaling the arrival of a promised fate. Perseus, filled with pride and joy, had saved Andromeda from a monstrous beast. The city rejoiced, welcoming their daughter back as if from the dead. Cepheus offered Perseus to stay a year, and upon agreement, they went to the palace. Inside, they encountered Phineus, who threatened them. Perseus unveiled the Gorgon's head, turning Phineus and his men into stone.

Long ago in Greece, Alcmene and Amphitryon lived happily. Amphitryon owned many cattle, causing disputes with Alcmene's father, the King of Mycenae. Amphitryon fled after a quarrel, and Alcmene gave birth to Hercules. Zeus adored Hercules, angering his wife Hera. When Hera sent serpents to kill the babies, Hercules strangled them. Hercules grew under various tutors and at eighteen, killed a lion terrorizing Nemea. Hera's wrath led Hercules to perform labors for Eurystheus, starting with the lion's invincible skin. Hercules failed to harm the lion with arrows but subdued it with a club, ending its terror.|"[""1.

Hercules had to complete two challenging tasks. The first task was to defeat a fierce lion and present its body to King Eurystheus. The second task was to conquer a deadly hydra, a water snake with nine heads, where one head was immortal. With his nephew Iolaus by his side, Hercules faced the hydra near the marsh of Lerna. Using his strength and bravery, Hercules fought the hydra, crushing its heads with his club. The hydra's heads multiplied until Iolaus helped by searing the necks with fire to prevent regrowth. Hercules finally defeated the hydra by burying the immortal head and using its poisonous gall to coat his arrows.

In ancient times, Arcadia was a picturesque land of lush forests, crystal-clear streams, and gentle meadows dotted with hunter's cottages and shepherd's huts. It was a place beloved by Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, and home to animals cherished by her. Among them was a stunning hind with golden horns, a gift from Artemis to mark her as sacred and protect her from harm. When King Eurystheus demanded that Hercules capture this hind alive, the hero embarked on a year-long pursuit. Through mountains, rivers, forests, and fields he chased the hind, until finally, he wounded her with an arrow and carried her back.

"In ancient times, there was a young shepherd named David who showed great courage and faith. When a giant named Goliath threatened his people, David stepped up to face him. Despite his older brother's doubts, David believed that the Lord would protect him. Armed with just a sling and stones, he confronted Goliath, declaring his trust in God. With a single shot, David defeated the giant, showing that faith and bravery can conquer any challenge.

Similarly, in a later era, a soldier named St. George stood up against injustice and persecution. Despite the risks, he defended Christians and stood firm in his beliefs. His courage and selflessness inspired many, and he became a symbol of hope and righteousness.

Both David and St. George teach us that with faith, determination, and a strong sense of justice, we can overcome obstacles and make a positive impact on the world around us."|"['1.

Deceived by Hagen, many knights volunteered to aid Gunther against supposed enemies. Before leaving, Hagen asked Kriemhild how he could assist Siegfried.

Once, a noble knight named Siegfried showed great respect by waiting for the King to quench his thirst before drinking himself. However, his kindness was met with betrayal. As Siegfried knelt to drink, Sir Hagen treacherously struck him on a vulnerable spot between his shoulders. When Siegfried realized he was wounded, he sought his weapons, but they had been cunningly taken by Hagen. With only his shield, Siegfried hurled it at Hagen, knocking him down. In his final moments, Siegfried warned of the consequences of his murder. Despite the treachery, he even asked for protection for his wife, who was the King's sister. As Siegfried passed, the army continued its journey to France.

When Roland regained consciousness, he surveyed the devastation that had struck his army. Only two remained by his side - Turpin the Archbishop and Walter of Hum. Walter, just returning from a fierce battle where all his men had perished, pleaded for Roland's aid. Despite his own injuries, Walter expressed his loyalty and need for help. Roland, acknowledging Walter's bravery, inquired about the thousand men who had left with him. Walter sadly revealed that they had all fallen in battle against the Saracens. Despite the losses, Roland, Walter, and the Archbishop valiantly fought against the enemy. Roland, Walter, and the Archbishop stood strong against the heathen, with Roland slaying twenty-five, Walter six, and the Archbishop five foes. The enemy, in fear, kept their distance and attacked from afar. Walter fell in battle, and the Archbishop, though wounded, remained resolute. As Roland sounded his horn, a weak signal reached King Charles, signaling impending doom. The King, realizing Roland's dire situation, ordered a swift advance to aid his nephew.

Roland bravely faced the enemy, refusing to yield or flee. He mounted his loyal steed Veillantif and rode towards the foe, accompanied by Archbishop Turpin. Despite the Archbishop being on foot, Roland vowed to stand by his side against the heathen attackers. The enemy, seeing their unity, hesitated but ultimately attacked fiercely, breaking Roland's shield and killing Veillantif. The Archbishop fell, leaving Roland alone. Overwhelmed by sorrow, Roland prayed for the Archbishop and prepared for his own demise. As he lay on a hill, a Saracen approached pretending to be dead, attempting to steal Durendal. Roland, realizing the deception, struck down the thief, lamenting the fool's boldness in challenging him.|"['1.

Count Roland knew that death was near. He raised himself, weak but determined, holding his sword Durendal. With ten powerful blows, he struck a rock, pleading for help from Mary. The sword remained unbroken. In despair, he lamented the thought of leaving his loyal sword behind. Despite his efforts, the sword remained intact. Roland, with a heavy heart, praised the sword's holiness and vowed it would not fall into enemy hands. As death approached, he lay down with his face towards the enemy, showing his victory. He prayed for forgiveness, recalling his conquests and homeland. With a final plea for salvation, Roland passed away, his soul carried by angels. And so, the great Count Roland met his end.|"['1.

In 868, Alfred married Ealhswyth, daughter of Aethelred the Alderman of Gainas, and Eadburh of the Mercians. On his wedding day, Alfred fell ill with a strange disease that plagued him for twenty years. Despite his illness, Alfred faced the Danish invasion of England. The Danes entered Wessex in 871, engaging in nine battles that year. One notable clash was at Ashdown in Berkshire, where Alfred and his men fought against the heathen forces, including five Earls. Alfred's brother, King Aethelred, delayed joining the battle to finish a mass, allowing Alfred to lead the charge. Despite being outnumbered and fighting on lower ground, Alfred's forces prevailed, slaying the five Earls. In 875, Alfred achieved a naval victory against Danish pirates, marking an early English triumph at sea. Alfred's efforts to bolster the English fleet aimed to defend against future invasions, highlighting the importance of naval power in safeguarding the realm.|"['1.

In 876, the Danes returned to Wessex, marking a turning point in Alfred's life. Despite facing his lowest luck, his spirit remained high. The Danish army, led by Guthorm, suddenly arrived in Wareham. Alfred, seeking peace, accepted Danish hostages and their promise to leave the land. However, the Danes broke their oath, fleeing with their horses to Exeter. The year 878 brought great challenges when the Danish host captured Chippenham, forcing Alfred into hiding. Yet, within months, Alfred rallied an army to confront the Danes. During this time, Alfred stayed in disguise with a neatherd. When the neatherd's wife scolded Alfred for neglecting burning cakes, Alfred revealed his identity. The neatherd later became the Bishop of Winchester. Alfred also negotiated with King Guthrum, who eventually converted to Christianity.|"[""1.

During the time when King Don Alfonso resided in Toledo, he received news about the departure of the Cid Campeador and his victory over King Bucar. The Cid was brought to San Pedro de Cardena in a grand procession upon his horse Bavieca for his funeral. King Don Alfonso was astonished by the sight of the noble Cid and his horse. The Cid's body was so well-preserved that he appeared alive, and the King decided not to bury him in a coffin. Instead, they placed the Cid's body on an ivory chair adorned with gold and azure. The Cid remained in this state for over ten years until he was finally buried. Gil Diaz, who took care of the Cid's horse Bavieca, continued to care for him after the Cid's death. The horse lived for two and a half years more and was buried with honor by Gil Diaz. The story then shifts to the tale of Robin Hood, an outlaw who lived in the greenwood and was known for his deeds. Robin Hood and his band of merry men lived in the forest, providing refuge for the poor and challenging the rich and powerful. Robin Hood once had a confrontation with a stranger on a narrow bridge, where they fought until Robin was knocked into the river. Despite his defeat, Robin Hood's bravery and honor were acknowledged by the stranger, who called for his companions with a horn blast.|"[""1.

Once upon a time in the forest, a stranger named John Little was welcomed by Robin Hood and his band of outlaws. Little John, a tall and strong man, was given his name at a feast held in his honor. Robin Hood explained their ways to Little John, instructing him to be kind to the common folk but to take from bishops and the Sheriff of Nottingham. Little John was made second in command and sent on a mission with Will Scarlett. They encountered a knight in distress, who shared his story of misfortune. Robin Hood generously provided the knight with a meal and even helped him with money troubles. Little John, noticing the knight's worn-out clothes, used his bow to measure out some rich garments for him.|"['1.

Robin instructed his companion to take the grey horse and equip it with a new saddle. He also advised taking a good palfrey, a pair of boots with gilt spurs, and assigned Little John as a squire for the journey. The knight had to reach the Abbey of St. Mary in York promptly to redeem his lands, as a delay risked losing them forever. The Abbot eagerly awaited the knight's arrival to claim the four hundred pounds owed. The knight, determined to pay his debt, sought the Abbot's help. Despite initial hostility, the knight proved his honesty and loyalty, returning the borrowed sum. In gratitude, the knight gifted Robin Hood a hundred bows and arrows, adorned with silver heads and peacock feathers.

The King was determined to capture Robin Hood and his merry men. He called his knights to plan in Nottingham. They heard stories of Robin's wrongdoings, especially how the deer in the forest were disappearing. The King swore to punish Robin. An old knight advised caution, but the King was eager. A forester told the King to come with five knights to see Robin. Robin intercepted them, asking for charity and taking money. Robin then invited the King to dine with him in the forest. They had venison and bread, and the archers tested their skills. Most failed, except Robin and Gilbert. Robin lost and took a blow from the King. The King bought green cloth from Robin, and they rode to Nottingham. The townspeople feared for their safety as the group approached.|"[""1.

Robin Hood, a legendary figure, lived in Sherwood Forest for twenty-two years, known for his skill with the bow. He ran away from the King's court to live freely among his men. Over time, he fell ill and went to a priory to be bled. The Prioress took so much blood that Robin suspected foul play. As he weakened, he signaled for help with his horn. Little John, his loyal companion, rushed to his aid. Robin, knowing his end was near, asked for his bow and arrow. He shot an arrow, deciding where he would be buried.

King Richard, along with his top nobles, arrived at Acre just before noon on June 8, 1191. I was fortunate to catch a glimpse of him, thanks to a kind harbor official. The King, a remarkable warrior, exuded courage and strength despite not being the tallest. His arms were said to be long for his height, a boon for a swordsman. With a ruddy complexion and piercing blue eyes, his presence commanded respect. However, shortly after his arrival, King Richard fell ill during the Feast of St. Barnabas. Despite his stubbornness, he eagerly took my medicine. His sickness worsened due to the summer heat, but his unwavering determination to lead the siege persisted, even on his sickest days. His relentless spirit and focus on war strategies hindered his recovery, showing his exceptional willpower.|"['1.

On a particular evening, when King Richard was recovering from his fever, an English knight named Hugh Brown visited his tent. The knight brought news that the French King had ordered a general attack on the town the next day, leaving King Richard curious about the sudden decision. The English knight explained that the Turks had destroyed two of King Philip's machines, causing the French King to retaliate. The machines, known as the cat and the mantlet, were intricate structures used in warfare. The cat was like a tent made of hides, while the mantlet was smaller and served as a shield for the soldiers. Despite the destruction, King Richard was not overly concerned, as he believed towns could not be conquered solely by shooting bolts. The passage illustrates the strategic elements of medieval warfare and the interactions between different kingdoms during that time.|"[""1.

On the thirty-fourth day after King Richard's arrival, the town was surrendered to the Christian army. Before the Turks left, a proclamation was made respecting their safe departure. The departing Turks displayed great courage and dignity, dressing in their finest attire before leaving. They then piled their clothes in the market and walked out in only their shirts with cheerful expressions. As the Turks departed, the Christian army entered the town. The spoils and prisoners were divided equally among the French and English kings. However, a dispute arose over the agreed terms. The Caliph did not fulfill his promise of delivering the Holy Cross, money, and prisoners. The disagreement led to mistrust between the two sides, resulting in the breakdown of the agreement.|"[""**1.

There were many delays and much talk, causing tempers to flare on both sides. The Christians had taken Acre but had a whole land to conquer, making it hard to march with prisoners. The English King did a shameful deed by ordering between two and three thousand prisoners to be slain. The Caliph and his Turks were not broken by losing Acre and watched the King's army closely, ready to plunder or slay. The Turks were swift and fit for the task, unlike the heavily armored Christian knights. The Turks were close by, waiting for an opportunity to attack, but King Richard was watchful. The army was arranged for battle at Arsuf with the sea on the right, Templars in the van, Frenchmen in two divisions, King Richard with the Englishmen, and the Hospitallers in the rear-guard. The rivalry between the Templars and Hospitallers worked for the common good, with both companies holding the most perilous positions.

King Richard's order was clear: the Christians must defend, not attack. Standing firm against the enemy was tough, even for seasoned soldiers. The crossbowmen, out of bolts, struggled with short swords. Some fled, seeking refuge among the men-at-arms. The assault was fierce; missiles darkened the sky. The Knights Hospitallers, renowned for bravery, pleaded to charge but were denied. The King's plan was to strike when the Turks weakened. The soldiers grew impatient, burdened with waiting. When the time came, the King led the charge with great vigor. The battle of Arsuf dealt Saladin a severe blow, yet the Christians' hope waned. Despite Richard's valor, his ambitions tainted his motives. The army faced skirmishes, often victorious due to the English King's skill. Nonetheless, progress seemed elusive.|"[""1.

Around this time, the King initiated peace talks with the Caliph Saladin, exchanging envoys. However, the King demanded more than what the Caliph intended to give, and the Caliph promised more than he planned to deliver. Despite this, they exchanged courtesies and gifts. King Richard sent hawks and received lavish gifts from the Caliph, including a tent of gold cloth, exquisite horses, rare animals, and snow from Lebanon. While this display of goodwill seemed genuine, the Caliph's forces continued to ravage towns and lands. The King, ill-informed due to poor news sources, attempted various peaceful resolutions. After a month of negotiations, realizing force was necessary, the King led his army towards the Holy City, facing challenges such as storms, sickness, and food scarcity along the way.

For a while, King Richard and his army stayed peacefully in Ascalon, gaining strength and recovering from sickness and fatigue. However, progress towards taking the Holy City was hindered by internal conflicts among the Christians. The French, led by the Duke of Burgundy, quarreled with King Richard, causing division. Meanwhile, distressing news from England reached the King, prompting him to consider returning home. Despite initial plans to leave immediately, a wise priest advised him to stay and fulfill his duty to reclaim the Holy City. Ultimately, after much deliberation, King Richard decided to postpone his departure and lead the army towards the Holy City once more. Although faced with challenges and doubts, the army's spirits were lifted, and they set out on their journey with renewed determination. Yet, upon nearing the Holy City, doubts arose again, leading to the decision to retreat once more, leaving the mission unaccomplished.|"['1.

When the leaders decided to turn back, a man-at-arms familiar with the land approached King Richard. Having journeyed as a pilgrim to Jerusalem multiple times, he offered to show the Holy City from a nearby hill. The King humbly declined, feeling unworthy due to his sins. He turned westward back to the sea-coast. King Richard, known for his courage and leadership, left a lasting legacy in the land. His name was so renowned that mothers would hush crying children by invoking his name, and startled riders would jest about seeing him in the bushes. On October 9, 1192, King Richard set sail for his homeland but faced misfortune. Separated from his friends, he was captured by a duke and imprisoned for over a year until a hefty ransom secured his release. Years later, he perished from a chance arrow during a siege. King Louis, sailing to Egypt in 1249, encountered a setback when a strong wind scattered his fleet, delaying his plans to besiege Damietta.

The King was determined to act without delay, and his nobles and knights had to obey. They quickly prepared for battle, filling small boats with men who rowed to the shore. Unfortunately, some men slipped or were swept away by the waves, causing casualties. The King, seeing the flag of Saint Denys on the shore, leapt into the sea, ready for combat. When he spotted the Saracens, he was eager to charge but was advised against it by his counselors. The enemy, upon realizing the King's arrival, tried to alert their Sultan, who was ill and did not respond. Believing their leader was dead, the Saracens fled Damietta. The King's army rejoiced, and with 30,000 men, they debated their next move. Despite the King's eagerness to attack, the unfavorable timing of the Nile's flooding led to a decision to delay until the floods receded. In December, the King marched towards Cairo, where the Turks, underestimating the King's caution, provoked the Knights Templar into a successful counterattack, resulting in the defeat of 500 Turkish knights.|"[""1.

The King set up camp between two Nile branches, one near Damietta and the other to the west. The Sultan's army blocked their path across the river. A Bedouin approached, offering to reveal a ford for a price. The King agreed, and the Bedouin showed a risky ford. The King and his knights crossed, engaging the Saracens in battle. Despite outnumbering the Saracens, the Crusaders struggled due to disarray and fatigue. A messenger from Mansoura sought aid. The Saracens pressed on, driving the Crusaders back to the river. Some Crusaders swam back to camp, but many horses drowned. Eventually, the Crusaders rallied, forcing the Saracens to retreat. The King and his chiefs returned to camp, weary but relieved. That night, the Saracens attacked the camp, but the Christians defended bravely.|"[""1.

The Saracens were preparing a stronger attack on the Crusaders' camp, focusing on the Count of Anjou, who was closest to Cairo. The Count faced a fierce assault, prompting him to seek help from the King. The King swiftly led his men to repel the Saracens, driving them back. However, the army faced severe shortages of food and water, worsened by the Saracens' blockade preventing supplies from reaching the camp. As conditions deteriorated, the King decided to move the army to Damietta for safety. Amid negotiations for peace, the Saracens demanded the King as a hostage, which the Christians refused. With the situation becoming dire, the King ordered the sick to be embarked on ships for evacuation. When the Saracens breached the camp, the King chose to stay with his people, eventually seeking refuge in a village after a loyal officer's suggestion.

The Sultan and the King debated over a ransom. The Sultan demanded the castles of the Knights Templars and Hospitallers, which the King refused, as they were not his to give. Angered, the Sultan threatened torture, but the King remained resolute, stating it was the Queen's decision. A ransom of a thousand gold pieces was proposed, but the King deferred to the Queen. Eventually, an agreement was reached for the King's release. However, a conspiracy arose among the Sultan's emirs, leading to the Sultan's death.

The King and the Saracen chiefs renewed their covenant, keeping the same conditions but changing the ransom payment. Half was to be paid before the King left, and the other half in Acre. They both swore binding oaths. The King stood firm in his Christian faith, refusing to swear in a way he found unseemly. The emirs respected him more for it. They even offered him the title of Sultan of Cairo, which he considered. The ransom was short, and the Templars reluctantly covered the difference. The King ensured the Saracens received their due. He then consulted his advisors about returning to France due to unrest with England. After deliberation, the advisors urged him to return to gather a new army for vengeance.

While the King stayed in Acre, messengers from the Old Man of the Mountain visited him. The first messenger, a spokesman, stood in front, the second held three daggers to show the danger of ignoring the message, and the third carried a shroud for those who did not heed the warning. The King asked the spokesman to speak. The envoy asked if the King knew the Old Man. The King admitted he had only heard of him. The envoy questioned why the King had not sent gifts to gain his favor, like other rulers. The King remained silent and asked the envoys to return later. When they returned, they found the King with the leaders of the Templars and Hospitallers. The envoys were alarmed. The Templar leader advised the envoys to return with gifts for peace.

During a time when King Robert Bruce had only a small group of men with him, he heard the barking of a bloodhound approaching. The hound was leading two hundred Galloway men who planned to attack Bruce by surprise. Bruce, always alert, positioned his men near a deep river with a narrow ford. He chose to defend the ford alone, allowing his men to rest. As the Galloway men crossed the river one by one, Bruce used his spear to defeat the first attacker and his horse, blocking the path for others. In the chaos, Bruce managed to kill some attackers and drive the rest back until his men arrived to support him. The Galloway men, initially confident in their numbers, retreated upon facing Bruce's brave defense.

The King tried to escape a large group of pursuers by scattering his followers in different directions. He kept only his foster-brother by his side.

My father always cherished children, not just his own. In a letter to my mother, he described seeing a group of little girls playing joyfully. He wished he could have them all as his own. As the Superintendent of the Military Academy at West Point, he often hosted social events for cadets. My brother and other relatives attended the academy. On Saturdays, cadets were invited to our home for a meal. Some were nervous, but my father's warmth quickly put them at ease. In 1853, my grandmother, Mrs. Custis, passed away. She was greatly admired and loved for her virtues. Bishop Meade praised her as a woman of deep piety and kindness. Her death was the first in our family, and we found solace in knowing she was in a better place.|"[""1.

"During my father's time at West Point, his family and friends convinced him to sit for a portrait painted by R. S. Weir, a Professor at the Academy. Only one sitting took place, and the artist had to rely on memory or brief glimpses of my father at ""The Point"" to complete the painting. The portrait depicted my father in the undress uniform of a Colonel of Engineers, a rank he temporarily held as the Superintendent of the Military Academy. Despite many considering it a good likeness, I felt it lacked the strength and sweetness of his true expression. My father disliked having his picture taken, as he found it hard to look pleasant. In 1855, he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the Second Cavalry and moved to Arlington with his family. He took charge of my mother's estate after her father's passing, showing a keen interest in farming and improving the land.

"Dear Mary,

I arrived yesterday around noon with four groups from Fort Monroe. I spent the evening and night organizing accommodations for the men and setting up sentinels to watch for the enemy. The night was quiet, and the community seemed calmer, welcoming me with kindness. Mr. Fry and other officers are here. Tomorrow might be the end for Captain Brown, with less interest in the others. I'll likely be here until after the 16th. Custis may have told you about my trip to Baltimore for troop arrangements. I met Mrs. Brown this morning, along with others from Philadelphia.

In the spring of 1830, Abraham Lincoln, at the age of twenty-one, embarked on a new chapter of his life. Leaving behind his family in Indiana, he set out for Illinois with thirteen relatives. Guiding oxen and selling small items along the way, Lincoln reached a spot near the Sangamon River where they decided to settle. There, he showcased his skills as a rail-splitter, known for his expertise with a broad-axe. Determined to make his own way, Lincoln left home to work independently. He became renowned in Illinois for his hard work and integrity, eventually taking on a job to sail a flat-boat down the Mississippi River to New Orleans.

Your recent letter was a source of comfort during my distress.

The wounds on my hands are healing, a sign of impending death. My eyes too reveal the approaching end. Despite my condition, I am grateful for the priests and Sisters of Charity by my side. Their presence marks a peaceful conclusion to my life's work among the lepers. Though weak, I find solace in their care and the knowledge that the mission will continue without me.
