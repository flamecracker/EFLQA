One day, a boy named Button-Bright found a magical umbrella in the attic. When he held it up and wished to fly, the umbrella lifted him into the air and took him on an unexpected journey. First, it flew him over the city, making him dizzy with the speed. When he landed in Buffalo, he was hot and thirsty but couldn't make the umbrella grant his wishes for an ice-cream soda. Then, when he accidentally wished to go to Chicago, the umbrella took him on a long flight. Landing in Chicago, tired and hungry, he realized he was in trouble for running away. Despite trying to return home, the umbrella wouldn't listen. Button-Bright decided to make the most of his adventure and see the country while he had the chance, knowing he wouldn't be allowed to do it again.|"['1. What did Button-Bright find in the attic?\nA.

The group was descending rapidly, the wind making their eyes water and obscuring their view below. Suddenly, the basket struck something, causing an angry outburst.

"Jimfred explained, ""It doesn't hurt, but it's nerve-wracking. They place you under a large knife that neatly slices you in half. Your half is then matched with another person's half. The challenge is, you're unsure which half belongs to you. It's a harsh punishment in a land where one can't die until they've lived for six hundred years. The Boolooroo, a mean ruler, invented this punishment. Everyone hopes his rule ends after three hundred years. Ghip-Ghisizzle suspects the Boolooroo has reigned longer, but without access to the Royal Book of Records, they can't prove it. To avoid being patched, you must obey the Boolooroo's commands.

They went with their new friend through the palace's maze of passages, which was vast, and emerged through a tall, arched gateway into the City's streets. Their descent had been so swift when the umbrella landed them in the royal garden that they missed seeing the Blue City. Now, they marveled at the magnificent sights before them. The Blue City was extensive, with broad streets paved in blue marble and lined with splendid buildings of the same material. There were houses, castles, and shops, all elegantly designed with slender spires and grand turrets reaching high into the blue sky. Everything was blue, just like the Royal Palace and gardens, with a blue haze hanging over the entire city.|"['1.

While strolling through the Blue City, the sailor and the boy attracted attention due to their peculiar appearance. The Blueskin inhabitants, with egg-shaped heads atop long necks and short round bodies, looked comical to the strangers. The Blueskin children tended to blue goats for milk, adding to the unique atmosphere. Despite the natives' initial dislike towards the newcomers, the friendly protection of Ghip-Ghisizzle kept them safe. As they gazed at the Arch of Phinis and the Fog Bank, they learned about the Sunset Country from the Book of Records. The Boolooroo's fear of revealing his reign's length led to secrecy, guarded by Jimfred Jinksjones and the Blue Wolf. Later, at dinner in the palace, Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright faced envious scowls from the Blueskins, eagerly awaiting Trot's arrival. The luxurious rooms of the Six Snubnosed Princesses left Trot in awe, adorned in blue and gold decor.|"['1.

Princess Azure and her sisters lounged in the reception room, their blue chins held high in disdain. Trot, annoyed by their rudeness, boldly took a seat. The Princesses whispered amongst themselves, asserting Trot's status as a slave for intruding. Trot, unafraid, expressed her desire to leave and criticized their manners. The Princesses retaliated, shaking and slapping Trot until she pretended obedience. Seeking refuge, Trot found a blue dog, a friendly blue cat, a chatty lamb, a surprised parrot, and a peacock in subsequent rooms, showing kindness to each. The animals, unaccustomed to such care, followed Trot, forming an unusual but endearing entourage. In the last room, a noisy blue rabbit startled Trot, who quieted it with a blue carrot, showcasing her gentle nature.|"['1.

The rabbit enjoyed the food, playing with Trot and the other pets. Suddenly, Princess Indigo burst in angrily, accusing Trot of wasting time. She tried to push Trot out, but the pets rebelled, defending her. The little blue dog bit Indigo, the blue cat scratched her, and chaos ensued. The princess was overwhelmed and howled for help. Trot laughed and thanked her loyal pets for protecting her. The Snubnosed Princesses, shocked by the rebellion of their pets, quarreled among themselves. Before dinner, Cobalt threatened Trot with punishment. Trot joined the Blueskins in the servants' hall, accompanied by her faithful pets, much to the surprise of the onlookers.

Ghip-Ghisizzle corrected the sailor, emphasizing the importance of not mixing neckties but being a nectar mixer instead. He warned them to stay quietly in the room until his return, as the Boolooroo was in a foul mood. The Boolooroo's daughters and wife had upset him, leading him to test the stolen umbrella's magic powers. When the umbrella failed to obey him, he grew furious and planned to march the strangers through the Arch of Phinis. Meanwhile, the prisoners, Cap'n Bill, Button-Bright, and the little girl, strategized on escaping but realized they needed the Magic Umbrella.

The Majordomo assured Trot and her pets that the palace was the safest place on the island. He separated them into different rooms, keeping Cap'n Bill and Button-Bright in separate chambers. Button-Bright was led by the Majordomo towards the King's bedchamber, passing various rooms along the way. They encountered a guard in front of the Royal Treasure Chamber and another before the King's apartments. Button-Bright dodged objects thrown by the King and managed to escape back to his room.

Fredjim left to guard the Princesses, leaving Button-Bright with the key to the Treasure Chamber. Remembering the Blue Wolf inside, Button-Bright grabbed a pillow for protection. After nervously unlocking the door, he faced heaps of treasure but also the fearsome Blue Wolf. The boy quickly subdued the wolf by stuffing the pillow in its mouth. Searching for his Magic Umbrella, Button-Bright found a Royal Record Book instead. Disappointed not to find the umbrella, he noticed the wolf struggling with the pillow. Button-Bright left the chamber, locked the door, and heard the Boolooroo's cries for his stolen key.

The Pinkies carried rosewood sticks as weapons. The strangers clarified that they were not Blueskins but escapees from the Blue Country. The Pinkies, skeptical, decided to take them to Tourmaline for judgment. The captives, now dry from the fog, followed the Pinkies through the charming pink city, where the citizens, armed with sticks, observed them cautiously.

In the pink marble-paved open space, stood life-size statues of Pinky men and women on pink pedestals, adorned with pink metal bands and glistening jewels. At the center, a plain pink stone house served as the meeting place. Inside, Tourmaline, a slender seventeen-year-old girl, sat darning pink stockings. Unlike others, she wore a simple pink robe with a rose gold band and a luminous jewel. The Queen, Tourmaline, listened to the strangers' tale of escaping the Blueskins. She explained her role as a servant to the people, emphasizing the importance of protecting and serving her subjects. The visitors, impressed by her humility, suggested she deserved a grander life and more respect from her people.|"['1.

"Tourmaline quickly responded, ""That would indeed be very wrong. Too much should never be given to anyone. If, with my great power, I also possessed great wealth, I might be tempted to be cruel and overbearing. In that case, my subjects would justly grow envious of my superior station. If I lived as luxuriously as my people do and had servants and costly gowns, the good Pinkies would say that their Queen had more than they themselves, and it would be true. Our way is best. The Ruler has absolute power to rule, but no riches, no high station, no false adulation. The people have the wealth and honor, for it is their due. The Queen has nothing but the power to execute the laws, to adjust grievances, and to compel order.""

""I did not choose to be the Queen,"" answered Tourmaline simply. ""A misfortune of birth placed me here, and I cannot escape my fate.

"""I know of a witch,"" Tourmaline pondered, ""but she's not very helpful. She says witchcraft gives her a headache, so she rarely practices it.

The Sunset Tribe believed they were favored as the sun set in a blaze of glory in the west.

"When they entered, they found both Button-Bright and Cap'n Bill ready for a walk before breakfast. No one stopped or bothered them. ""They know we can't escape,"" said the sailor, ""so they don't need to keep an eye on us."" They strolled freely around the circular street, taking in the sights of the Pink City, and then headed back to Coralie's house for breakfast. Coralie was absent as she had been called to the Queen's palace. Her husband hosted the guests, and after breakfast, he informed them, ""I will escort you to Tourmaline, who will decide your fate today. I am curious to see what she will do, as we have never had strangers intrude upon us before."" Tourmaline welcomed them in and had them sit on a pinkwood bench. She sat on a simple rocking chair, flanked by members of the Sunrise and Sunset Tribes. Despite her plain attire, Tourmaline's beauty and humble demeanor stood out. She had pink eyes, dark golden-red hair, light-pink skin, and a slender form, making her unique among the Pinkies. She then addressed the strangers, explaining the process of deciding their fate.

Coralie argued that it was unfortunate for the strangers to be on Sky Island. The parrot suggested keeping them to help find a way back home. The Pinkies pondered deeply. The Queen asked the strangers to step outside while they discussed. After examining statues, they returned to vote on the strangers' fate. The options were to stay as guests or be thrown over the edge. Cap'n Bill was determined to fight for their lives. With a tie in the vote, Tourmaline sought Rosalie the Witch's deciding vote. Rosalie, taller and slender, appeared in a pink cloud of smoke. She held a staff with a pink jewel. The Pinkies bowed respectfully as Tourmaline explained the situation.

In the attic of his house, Button-Bright discovered the Magic Umbrella. His initial flight and journey across the United States were revealed, ending where Trot sat on a bluff. Scenes quickly changed, showing trial flights with Trot and Cap'n Bill, the trip to Sky Island, and their encounter with the Boolooroo. Despite no sound, Pinkies followed the strangers' adventures through gestures. Button-Bright was amazed to witness the Boolooroo's test of the Magic Umbrella, leading to its angry disposal. The vision concluded with their passage through the Fog Bank, aided by a friendly frog. As the vision faded, Rosalie smiled triumphantly. A death sentence seemed imminent, surprising Trot and worrying Button-Bright, who sought to comfort her. Cap'n Bill watched the Witch with curiosity. The Witch suggested fairies protected the Earth visitors, voting to expel them from the island. Pinkies prepared to escort them, despite the rain, anticipating the fairies' defense.|"['1.

In a distant land known as the Pink Country, our friends embarked on a perilous journey under the guidance of Tourmaline. Battling the rain and treacherous terrain, they faced a looming crisis. Traversing private gardens and muddy paths, they encountered a rainbow bridge where the enchanting Polychrome appeared. With grace and wisdom, she questioned the Queen's decree to harm the travelers, advocating for their stay to enrich the Pinkies' world.

"""Does it indeed?"" questioned the Rainbow's Daughter. ""Let's go back to your City and check your Book of Laws. I'm sure I can find absolute protection for these wanderers."" They obeyed Polychrome's request and walked back to the City. Polychrome placed a cloak on the ground for them to walk on, protecting them from the mud. In Tourmaline's palace, Polychrome found a Law stating that anyone in the Pink Country, except Blueskins, is entitled to protection, a home, and good living. Another Law revealed that the person with the lightest skin should be the Ruler, making Trot the rightful Queen. Tourmaline passed her circlet to Trot, acknowledging her as the new Queen.

Polychrome smiled at Button-Bright, explaining the country's laws. She then focused on the Pinkies, asking if they were content. Polychrome kept only a few close by, including Button-Bright and the new Queen. Tourmaline rushed off to change into a beautiful gown, relieved to be free of her queenly duties. Polychrome discussed customs with the Witch, advising her to protect the new queen. The excited crowd gathered outside as Trot, now dressed in pink, was led by Polychrome to meet her subjects. The Pinkies were thrilled to have the Rainbow's Daughter as their new Queen's friend. As the parrot perched on Cap'n Bill's shoulder, the Rainbow appeared, and Polychrome bid farewell, promising to watch over them.

The bow suddenly lifted, carrying the dancing maidens into the sky. The colors faded, the arch dissolved, and the sky cleared. Trot turned to the Pinkies, suggesting a holiday. As they dispersed to enjoy themselves, Trot, Cap'n Bill, Button-Bright, and Rosalie discussed ruling the country. Rosalie revealed her plan to make Polychrome her ally to increase her power as a Witch. Trot contemplated her newfound role as Queen and the potential to lead the Pinkies to conquer the Boolooroo and reclaim the Magic Umbrella. Button-Bright mentioned Ghip-Ghisizzle as a potential ally among the Blueskins. The Pinkies, eager for excitement, readily agreed to the adventure. Coralie and Tintint were appointed as captains for the Sunset and Sunrise Tribes, respectively, leading a force of 100 warriors each.

Meanwhile, Cap'n Bill gathered the army in the Court of the Statues. Queen Mayre appointed Cap'n Bill as the Commander in Chief, instructing all Pinkies to follow his lead. Cap'n Bill advised the army to wear raincoats over their pink clothes to stay dry in the Fog, assuring them of the harmless creatures within. He warned them about the Blueskins in the Blue Country, urging them to be cautious. The army, led by Cap'n Bill, Trot, Button-Bright, and Rosalie, rode on the backs of the frogs through the Fog Bank.

The Boolooroo suspected the Majordomo of stealing the Record Book but kept it to himself to maintain his deception. To prevent the Majordomo from becoming ruler, the Boolooroo planned to have him patched with another Blueskin. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Boolooroo accused Tiggle of a minor offense to justify patching him with the Majordomo. Just as the operation was about to begin, news arrived that the Pinkies had breached the Fog Bank and were approaching the city. Fearing the Pinkies' sharp weapons, the Boolooroo ordered the gates closed and soldiers to defend the walls. The citizens armed themselves with cords to entangle the invaders.

The six Princesses gathered in a circle in front of the captives. Cerulia proposed a deal to Ghip-Ghisizzle, offering his freedom if he agreed to marry one of them once the Pinkies were defeated. Ghip-Ghisizzle declined, feeling unworthy of their beauty. The Princesses then untied his legs but kept his arms bound, leading him away. Meanwhile, Cap'n Bill and the Pinkies camped outside the City gate, preparing for battle. The Boolooroo, eager to attack, ordered his soldiers to charge. The Pinkies, armed with sharp sticks, stood their ground, forcing the Blueskins to retreat. Cap'n Bill suggested making longer sticks to counter the Pinkies' weapons.

"Rosalie pondered, ""I possess a single magic charm that can aid our army, but I can only use it once every three days. Perhaps I might need it for other purposes."" The sailor suggested capturing the Blueskins as the top priority, believing they could manage without magic if successful. Rosalie agreed and enchanted the Pinkies' weapons, making them powerful against the Blueskins. The Pinkies, elated by their newfound strength, prepared for battle. As the Boolooroo's army armed themselves with long lances, the enchanted weapons of the Pinkies proved formidable, deflecting the Blueskins' attacks.

The Witch crafted a long ladder from ropes to scale the wall. Under the moonlight, Rosalie, Trot, and Button-Bright sneaked to the wall's shadow. With Blueskins inattentive, they aimed to toss the ladder's end to catch on a projection. After several attempts, they secured it on a broken flagstaff. Rosalie entrusted Trot with a magic ring for invisibility, a gift from the Queen of the Mermaids. Trot climbed the ladder unseen, removed it, and descended into the Blue City. The city was quiet, with only a few sleeping Blueskins. Trot navigated towards the palace, believing Cap'n Bill was held there. She marked the ladder's location for a safe return and set off towards the palace, determined to find Cap'n Bill.|"['1.

Once or twice, the young girl wandered off track in the confusing streets but eventually spotted the grand palace. Approaching the entrance, she encountered a pair of guards named Jimfred Jonesjinks and Fredjim Jinksjones. The guards, usually distinct, were now oddly patched together. They mentioned the upcoming patching of an Earth man to Tiggle, as Ghip-Ghisizzle had mysteriously vanished. Feeling sorry for those to be patched, the guards shared their experience of the strange combination. Meanwhile, the girl sneaked into the palace and navigated through dimly lit halls to find Cap'n Bill. Upon reaching the Room of the Great Knife, she discovered Tiggle bound. After freeing him, they plotted an escape by distracting the guards outside.|"['1.

Trot went to the door, leaving Tiggle behind. Tiggle was surprised when she disappeared but listened carefully. He heard a noise from one end of the corridor. He opened the door and ran the other way as instructed. The guard couldn't find the source of the noise. Trot made sure not to be touched by Tiggle. She then searched for Cap'n Bill but decided to wait until morning. Tired, she found a vacant room opposite the Six Snubnosed Princesses' suite. She unlocked the door and entered. It was the room where Ghip-Ghisizzle was held. He had managed to open a window and planned to escape by leaping onto the wall. When Trot arrived, he leaped out and ran along the wall. Guards and people chased him. Ghip-Ghisizzle decided to trust the Pinkies and leaped down, escaping the Blueskins. Captain Coralie captured him and took him to Rosalie the Witch's tent. Trot watched the escape and then fell asleep on the bed.|"['1.

At daybreak, the girl woke up in the Royal Palace, finding everyone still asleep. Quietly, she washed up and realized she was invisible due to a magical ring. She decided to play a prank on the Snubnosed Princesses, causing chaos. While searching for Cap'n Bill, she discovered him tied up in the Boolooroo's chamber. Untying him, she freed Cap'n Bill from the clever trap set by the Boolooroo. The girl's quick thinking and bravery helped her outwit the cunning king and reunite with her friend.|"['1.

Cap'n Bill was bewildered when Trot, who had used a magic ring to render herself invisible, suddenly became visible to him. She explained that she was alone and had to capture the Blue City. Trot then devised a plan to help Cap'n Bill escape the Boolooroo's den by using a rope ladder. She led him through the sleeping Boolooroo's room and past a guard to the chamber opposite the Six Snubnosed Princesses. Trot decided to stay behind to find the Magic Umbrella while ensuring Cap'n Bill's safe return to the Pinkies. Cap'n Bill used the rope ladder to descend the wall, but the soldiers awoke and chased after him. Despite his efforts, the Blueskins caught up to him and captured him.|"[""1.

Cap'n Bill and Trot faced disappointment when he was recaptured. While Trot shed a few tears, Cap'n Bill, a seasoned philosopher, accepted his ill fortune with grace. Meanwhile, Button-Bright and Coralie, along with the Pinkies, attempted to assist Cap'n Bill in his escape but were too late. Ghip-Ghisizzle, having discovered evidence that the Boolooroo had no rightful claim to the throne, planned to confront him with the Royal Record Book. With the support of the people, Ghip-Ghisizzle aimed to dethrone the tyrant and take his rightful place as ruler of the Blue Country.

The commotion in the City upon Cap'n Bill's rescue woke up the Boolooroo, who discovered his prisoner had escaped. Enraged, he threatened to punish everyone if Cap'n Bill wasn't recaptured. After breakfast, they marched to the Room of the Great Knife. Trot, unseen, followed, hoping to save Cap'n Bill. The room had benches for spectators and a derrick-like knife that could cleanly slice a person in two. The Six Snubnosed Princesses entered, adorned in blue and haughty. Cap'n Bill politely greeted them. Trot, observing the dreadful machine, searched for a way to help.

The soldiers rushed in to report that Tiggle and Ghip-Ghisizzle had vanished from the City, causing the Boolooroo to erupt in anger. He ordered the soldiers to capture the first living being they encountered to be patched to Cap'n Bill. Meanwhile, Trot, unseen by all, found a rope and waited quietly. Soldiers dragged in a blue billygoat, to the amusement of the Boolooroo. The soldiers tried to patch Cap'n Bill and the goat, but Trot cleverly prevented it twice by moving the frame at the last moment. The Boolooroo, puzzled and furious, attempted a third time to drop the Great Knife on Cap'n Bill, but Trot foiled his plan once more.|"[""1.

In the grand hall, chaos erupted as a mischievous billygoat launched a daring attack on the King and the soldiers. The goat's fierce butts sent everyone into a frenzy, causing the soldiers to flee in fear. The Six Snubnosed Princesses were not spared either, as the goat toppled their chairs, sending them into a panic. Amidst the commotion, quick-thinking Trot managed to tie up the goat and secure the Boolooroo, the mischievous ruler of the Blue Country. With the enemies subdued, Trot confidently prepared to release the Great Knife, signaling a shift in power.

I'm the Queen of the Pinkies and the Booloorooess of the Blues."" Just then, footsteps echoed in the corridor. The soldiers, afraid of the Princesses' warnings of severe punishment from the Boolooroo, cautiously returned to the room. The Captain of the Guards peered in first, but the goat's attempt to charge was thwarted by its rope. ""Stop!"" commanded Trot. The soldiers, relieved to see the sailor free and the Boolooroo captured, followed Trot's orders to guard the palace.

In the end, they returned to the grand throne room of the palace, where they sat on the throne and pondered the whereabouts of the precious umbrella. As they conversed, the Captain of the Guards entered and informed them of the Pinkies' plans to attack the City. Trot swiftly ordered the Pinkies to leave and instructed the soldiers to prepare for a celebration in the Blue City. She declared peace between the Pinkies and the Blues, much to the surprise of the Blue people. The Blue Bands gathered outside the palace, ready to march.

Trot listened attentively to the Majordomo's speech and reassured everyone that things would be alright soon. The Pinkies and Blues then joyously entered the City for a grand feast. Trot, along with her companions, enjoyed a lavish dinner at the Royal Banquet Hall. After dining, Trot shared her adventures and returned Rosalie's magic ring to her. She then discussed the future leadership of the Pink and Blue Countries with Ghip-Ghisizzle. Despite Ghip's request to punish the former Boolooroo, Trot decided against further retribution. Instead, she chose to exile the old Boolooroo and the Snubnosed Princesses.

Trot, the new Queen of Sky Island, took charge and dethroned the old Boolooroo, appointing Ghip-Ghisizzle as the new ruler. The Princesses were sent to live in Ghip-Ghisizzle's cabin, causing a ruckus. The Room of the Great Knife was dismantled and burned, symbolizing the end of the old regime.

"""When you marry someone, you commit to both their inner and outer selves,"" stated Ghip-Ghisizzle firmly. The Witch, Rosalie, cast a powerful charm on Princess Indigo, revealing her deceitful intentions. Indigo, hoping to marry Ghip-Ghisizzle and become Queen, had misled them about the umbrella's whereabouts. Despite their efforts, the group couldn't find the crucial umbrella. Trot, the leader, decided to seek out Tiggle, who had hidden due to the former Boolooroo's rule. Tiggle remembered tossing the umbrella-like object into a palace alley.

Cap'n Bill detached the seats from the umbrella's handle, coiled the ropes around the boards, and bundled them under his arm. Trot took the empty lunch basket, and Button-Bright clung to the precious umbrella. They headed back to the palace to bid farewell to Ghip-Ghisizzle and the Blues. The new Boolooroo seemed regretful to part ways with his friends, but the people were secretly relieved to see the strangers, especially the Pinkies, leave. Despite the sullen silence from the crowd, Coralie and Captain Tintint organized everyone for departure. Trot asserted her authority as the Queen of Sky Island before the Pinkie Band played a triumphant march, leading the Army out of the Blue City towards the Fog Bank. Upon reaching the edge of the Fog Bank, the Pinkies donned raincoats, Button-Bright opened his umbrella, and they ventured into the fog, seeking aid from the Frog King and his subjects. But an unexpected turn of events occurred when the umbrella transformed into a giant elephant, causing the frightened frogs to flee in panic.|"[""1.

The boy marveled at the incredible change as they followed the elephant through the fog. The frogs scurried away, hiding until the giant beast passed. Cap'n Bill, in his excitement, rambled about witches and magic. Finally, they reached the Pink Country, exhausted and wet. The elephant transformed into a Magic Umbrella, symbolizing their return. The Pinkies rejoiced with a pink anthem as they reached their beloved land. Trot and Button-Bright, along with Cap'n Bill and Rosalie the Witch, settled in the palace. Trot proposed a law to treat the Queen as well as her people, ensuring fairness. The Pinkies welcomed Rosalie as their new Queen, and the Earth friends prepared to depart, leaving behind a reminder of their time in the Beautiful Land.|"['1.

Trot knew she wouldn't go back to Sky Island but kept it to herself. She thanked Coralie and the Pinkies and invited them to watch as she and her friends flew away through the sky after dinner. Queen Rosalie conjured a magical dinner table, and they all enjoyed a feast, reminiscing about their adventures. They packed leftovers for the journey ahead. Cap'n Bill prepared the seats while Button-Bright checked the umbrella. The group bid farewell to the Pinkies and boarded the Magic Umbrella. As they soared through the sky, they saw marvelous sights, including the Daughters of the Rainbow dancing on a rainbow. The journey was thrilling, passing stars and encountering giant birds. As hunger struck, they enjoyed pink food from the lunch basket. Eventually, they spotted Earth, flew over the ocean, and landed near Trot's house at dusk, ending their magical adventure.|"['1.
