In the woods, an owl's cry broke the silence. Tory suppressed a shiver, trying to stay calm. The sound reminded her of when she first found Kara after her accident. Kara was lying at the base of a small cliff, covered in rocks and dirt, but thankfully not seriously hurt. Kara explained how she had slipped and couldn't walk back, so Tory had to figure out how to help. They managed to reach a clearing for a better signal fire. As the night passed, Kara slept, and Tory prepared to signal for help again. She set up smoke signals on a distant hill, hoping someone would see them.

Along the lake's edge, six girls and their two guests sat. The water mirrored the sky's blue, still and serene, save for a shadow cast by pine-covered hills. Beyond, a forest of beechwood trees stood tall. A rustic log cabin, nearly hidden by vines of woodbine, honeysuckle, and wistaria, exuded an ancient charm.

At camp, Tory practiced a dance inspired by young beech trees, aiming to capture their grace and freshness. Despite feeling unsure about her dance, she eagerly shared it with Kara. As Tory danced, she portrayed the elements - from light winds to a storm passing and the sun shining again. Kara was captivated, suggesting they invite Tory's mother to teach them outdoor dancing. The girls, Louise and Teresa, found solace at camp, with Louise often misunderstood due to her quiet nature. Dorothy, a beacon of joy, brought warmth to those around her, including Louise.

Louise was not the kind of girl who easily won over her teachers or strangers. She wasn't considered pretty, didn't enjoy household chores, and her school performance was just average. However, Louise excelled in certain classes and had a unique bond with her Girl Scout troop, especially with her friend Dorothy. Louise found solace in nature, often carrying a nature book and getting lost in her thoughts while her friends chatted. She confided in Dorothy about her deep spiritual and mental musings, feeling like she was awakening for the first time in her life during that summer in the woods. Louise believed that the outdoors held something special for her, a feeling that set her apart from the rest.

Teresa's complexion had darkened from the sun, her cheeks rosier, and her eyes a mix of maturity and innocence, looking slightly sad. The camp was a hub of activity, with chores like laundry and dishwashing done there. Nearby, a pebbled shore led to the bathing area. Drinking water came from a spring up the hill. The legend told of a maiden who appeared at midnight with a silver bowl for wishes. Teresa wished for more excitement at camp, feeling the days were too similar. Louise, more intellectual, viewed Teresa with a mix of pity and envy. Teresa, though gentle, had a strong will, especially in pursuing her desires.

Teresa's nature seemed complex to Louise, who felt she could cause trouble unintentionally. Tory and Kara weren't alone; Edith stayed to help. Despite being urged to join a hike, Tory declined, feeling too tired. Edith had gone to get supplies, leaving Kara sleeping peacefully.

Tory had a challenging winter after returning from abroad with her artist father. Making friends in Westhaven wasn't easy, but she managed.

Kara's room had transformed from the Girl Scout living room to a cozy space filled with memories. Each Girl Scout had knitted a square in their favorite color to create a rainbow scarf for Kara, symbolizing good fortune. Sunlight cast a warm glow through the pale yellow curtains, illuminating the room with a sense of peace. A stuffed American eagle perched above the fireplace, a gift from Mr. Richard Fenton to the Girl Scouts of the Eagle's Wing in Beechwood Forest. Kara, once cherished by the village, now seemed indifferent to the gifts and care she received. Tory, feeling a sense of duty, decided to protect Kara from the truth of her past abandonment. Mr. Hammond, who had rescued Kara, had not visited since her accident, leaving Tory frustrated by his absence. Lucy, the girl Mr. Hammond had chosen to adopt instead of Kara, had also been distant.

Tory, lost in thought, believed Kara deserved better after a challenging childhood. As she daydreamed, Tory left the room, having found only a slip of paper with Kara's name. Seeing Edith approaching, Tory anticipated her return. Following troop rules, girls should not be alone in the woods. Tory hoped Miss Frean would return with Edith to discuss Kara's idea of outdoor dancing lessons. They considered asking Evan's mother to teach them in Beechwood Forest. Lance's unexpected arrival interrupted Tory's thoughts. Despite his questionable behavior, Tory felt compelled to protect him.

Tory, you are not failing, but you are trying to do too much, which can also lead to failure. Miss Mason mentioned that the other Girl Scouts have expressed their concerns about your relationship with Kara.

You are drawn to Kara's mystery and her lack of family, wanting to be her fairy godmother. However, trying to be Kara's savior is wearing you out and preventing her from enjoying her friendships with others. Remember your plans for outdoor sketching and painting this summer?

Tory wasn't used to criticism, having been shielded by her father after her mother's passing. Despite her aunt's attempts at discipline, Tory remained rebellious.

Mr. Hammond expressed his concern for Kara's lack of interest in activities since her fall at the summer camp. He assured her that her current state of mind was temporary and attributed it to the shock she had experienced. He encouraged Kara by praising her courage and good sense, believing she would overcome this phase. Mr. Hammond then shared a peculiar feeling he had upon entering the room, feeling a connection to Kara. He recalled a past encounter with a little girl in a deserted farmhouse in the vicinity and asked Kara if she remembered the incident. As Tory Drew's senses returned, she realized the significance of Mr. Hammond's story and the possible connection to Kara's past.|"[""1.

"""Is there anything else you could tell me, Mr. Hammond?"" Kara inquired. ""You need not regret having spoken before the other girls. They are my friends and really know as much of my history as I do. There is so little information I have ever received.""

""No, I am afraid not, Kara. I am sorry,"" Mr. Hammond replied. ""Now and then I have considered that possibly we did not make a sufficiently thorough investigation. Yet I do not honestly believe this. At the time I searched the room thoroughly. I waited, thinking that in all probability someone would come back for you. Then, when I gave up this idea and took you with me to Westhaven, we did not fail in making another effort.""

The room fell silent as the grave and dramatic conversation unfolded between Kara and Mr. Hammond. Mrs. Hammond gently took Lucy's hand, hoping that Lucy would one day forget the Gray House and consider herself their own child. Sheila Mason, having finished her conversation with Mr. Fenton and Miss Frean, turned towards the center of the room, indicating it was time to bid farewell. However, the intensity of Kara's expression and Mr. Hammond's words prevented any interruption.

""I am afraid I have said too much or too little and perhaps tired or worried you, Kara,"" Mr. Hammond spoke softly. ""If you like, suppose we have a long, quiet talk some day alone.

Tory felt a bit embarrassed about neglecting the young English girl, but she didn't mean to be rude or indifferent. She was more focused on Katherine Moore. After a talk with Martha, she offered an apology. The English Girl Guide was understanding and appreciative of the situation, not showing any resentment. She found the experience of meeting American Girl Scouts wonderful. The other girls were friendly and interested, talking about Tory's care for Kara. The English girl was eager to learn about American woods and fields, different from her cultivated country. Martha and Edith, with practical outdoor knowledge, were friendly and helpful. Edith came from a simple background, working-class parents, and was learning a lot from her time with the Girl Scouts.|"['1.

Tory knew that social differences were more important in England than in the United States. She wondered if the Girl Guides aimed for true Democracy like the American Girl Scouts. Tory often entertained herself by drawing, even if her human figures were not perfect. She envisioned a small figure in a crumpled green dress and a hat with a green ribbon, holding a yellow suitcase. The little girl calmly mentioned she was going to Kara. She expressed her love for Kara and her dislike for others. Tory offered the child food and rest, planning to take her to Kara later.

Mr. Fenton, a passionate Greek scholar, believed in sharing the historic legends of Greece with the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in Westhaven. He saw Greece's history as vital, especially for its early democratic government and the influence of the Olympian games. To broaden the young people's horizons, Mr. Fenton proposed a series of tableaux and recitations from Homeric poems. However, a debate arose among the Scouts about casting for the roles. Teresa felt slighted when Joan was chosen to play Penelope instead of her. Despite the disagreements, the group aimed to focus on the upcoming poetic drama and meeting with Mr. Fenton and the boys to finalize the location.|"[""1.

Louise often found it hard to understand Teresa's love for pleasure and admiration due to their different temperaments. Kara, unable to move from her chair, hesitated to participate in the Boy Scouts' play. Despite her reservations, her friends, Tory and Miss Mason, encouraged her to play the 'Goddess of Wisdom' in the Greek tableaux. Kara's friends, Margaret and Tory, agreed to help her get to the dancing grounds for rehearsal. The characters for the tableaux were decided, with Kara portraying Pallas Athena.

Tory, will you join us? I know I'm selfish, but I hate being away from you. If there's time before Mrs. Phillips comes, why not sketch Lucy again? Your first drawing of her was great, even if you weren't satisfied. Lately, Tory had followed Memory Frean's advice and let the other Girl Scouts help with Kara. They seemed happier together, and Kara felt better for many reasons. At 4 o'clock, Mr. Fenton sent a car to take Kara, Miss Mason, Lucy, and other girls to the site for the Greek pageant. The water was deep, the stream not wide. A clearing with trees nearby was on one side. The open space where they stood was larger. Miss Frean thought it might be the right place, despite being far from Westhaven. They'd need to transport scenery and costumes and arrange seating. But the spot itself was beautiful. They planned to have tableaux across the water and the audience on their side for the illusion. The Palace of Odysseus would be in front of the trees, where most scenes would happen. Odysseus would arrive on a Greek galley, and the maidens would wash clothes by the banks. The players would be hidden until their entrance. Some couldn't see the vision, but Tory could.|"['1.

Three members from the Boy Scout Council and three girls joined Mr. Fenton on a trip. It was unusual for both boys and girls to participate in the same event, and the idea was being seriously considered.

He explained to Lance and the gathered young crowd, including Memory Frean, Sheila Mason, Captain Curtis, and others, that the Greek spirit encompasses the pursuit of Beauty, Adventure, and Freedom. Mr. Fenton, once a recluse, found unexpected connections with Tory, now known as Victoria Drew.

The lecture emphasized the importance of not pursuing beauty, adventure, and freedom at the expense of others, but rather sharing these values with everyone. The speaker sought a hammer to help build a footstool for Penelope's maids, admitting he was not a skilled carpenter. The transition from summer to early autumn was evident in the vibrant colors of the fields and forests. A pageant was held with American and Scout flags, honoring the origins of the Scout movement. The performance depicted Odysseus overcoming a storm to reach a safe harbor. Princess Nausicaa and her maidens washed clothes by the river, unaware of the sleeping Odysseus. The scene was brought to life with colorful costumes and intricate details.|"[""1.

In studying the ancient Greek costumes, Miss Frean and the Troop Captain discovered that color, not just white, played a significant role in their attire.

Mr. Hammond found a package of old letters in an abandoned Dutch oven. The Girl Scouts, including Tory and Dorothy, were eager to read them. The letters were carefully examined and found to be of little importance, except for a few signed with the initials O. M., possibly linked to Katherine Moore. Since no one else claimed them, the letters were given to Kara, the girl found as a baby in the cabin. Dr. McClain, who saw Kara daily, was entrusted with delivering the letters. The group waited anxiously to see how the letters would impact Kara once she received them.|['Question 1:\nWhat did Mr. Hammond find in the abandoned Dutch oven?\nA) A lost treasure\nB) A package of old letters\nC) A mysterious map\nD) An ancient artifact\nE) A hidden key', 'Question 2:\nWho among the Girl Scouts were eager to read the old letters?\nA) Tory and Kara\nB) Dorothy and Dr. McClain\nC) Kara and Katherine Moore\nD) Tory and Dorothy\nE) Mr. Hammond and O.

"Dear Tory, did our discovery not disappoint you? Do the letters hold significance for you? Do you believe that something important to you will come from them one day? I trust it if you do.

Beloved Tory, if you, with all your imagination and romantic sensibilities, could not find value in the old letters, why expect a practical, matter-of-fact person like me to do so? The letters seem absurd to me, especially if they are supposed to relate to me.

Please promise not to expect too much or be overly disappointed if things do not turn out as hoped. I am happier today than any letters proclaiming me an heiress could ever make me.

There is nothing more to share, except that I am to go to New York City for treatment and to spend the winter. Mr. Fenton, Mr. Hammond, Dr. McClain, and others have arranged and will cover all my expenses.

Tory, I hope you know that even when I seemed ungrateful, I truly cared for you. I won't dwell on it now, but as an artist, you understand better than I do how one's perspective can be skewed. My view is clearer now, regardless of the outcome.

Kara and Tory spent every spare moment together. In the final days, Miss Victoria Fenton invited Kara to stay with them in the village to make farewells easier. Dr. McClain would accompany Kara to New York for medical consultations, with Mr. Jeremy Hammond"|"['1.
