Long ago, the mysterious Spark of Electricity was discovered by the Greek sage Thales, hiding in amber. Over time, this wild force was found lurking in various substances like sulfur and glass. In 1745, Dutch philosophers captured Electricity in a Leyden Jar, making him a useful servant. Despite being tamed, Electricity can still escape when given the chance. He can perform wonders like transforming base metal into gold and lighting up our streets. This volatile force is a swift messenger, carrying news across lands and even under the deep sea. By coating wires with gutta-percha, he can be kept in check for underwater telegraphic communications. Electricity, once untamed, now serves mankind with his incredible powers.|['1.

"In the process of building, the main wire of the copper core was first enclosed in a semi-liquid mixture of gutta-percha and tar, known as ""Chatterton's Compound."" This layer excluded all air when other wires were wound around it. The core was then solidified with more compound, followed by a coating of pure gutta-percha, a fantastic insulator. Afterward, the core was coated with Chatterton's Compound and gutta-percha alternately until four layers of each were applied. The completed core underwent rigorous electrical tests submerged in water. Robin Wright meticulously documented the process and later shared a detailed lecture with his family. The core was further tested, received a jacket of tanned jute yarn, and was submerged in water for insulation testing.

"""Yes, sir,"" replied Robin, with a tired grin, ""I've been pondering the cable so much that I even dreamt about it when I dozed off. In my dream, it transformed into a sea-serpent and nearly choked me. That's when I woke up and decided to get up and check on it.""

""Ah, my boy, you're not alone in losing sleep over the cable. We have two teams of electricians on board, both very alert. One group is from the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company, led by Monsieur de Sauty. The other team represents the Atlantic Telegraph Company, under Mr. Varley and Professor Thomson. They will be testing the cable's electrical state and maintaining contact with the shore every hour, day and night, during the voyage. Any faults will be immediately noticed.""

""Indeed, my boy,"" continued Smith. ""The cable in the tanks has been joined into one length and tested continuously since we left Ireland. We must ensure the insulation, continuity, and resistance of the conductor for successful communication. Messages travel through the entire 2400-mile cable, requiring increased electrical power over distance. It's a complex process, Robin, but vital for our mission."""|"['1.

During the following fifteen minutes, the crew hurried to lower the raft by releasing the cable. Some crew members dashed below to retrieve important items, but the ship was sinking fast, leaving little time. The captain urged everyone to hurry. Sam, responsible for the telegraph, felt the heroism of staying until all were safe. Determined to be the last one off, Sam hesitated. As the captain was occupied with others, Sam's friends, Robin, Slagg, and Stumps, stood by him. Suddenly, Sam remembered his mother's Bible in his berth.

When the raft was launched from the ship, the carpenters joined the crew, leaving their tools on the deck beside piles of unused materials. Sam, skilled with an axe, quickly fashioned a sturdy frame from four spars. As the ship began to sink, urgency filled the air. Sam barked orders, directing his comrades to secure the frame with ropes and planks. With swift and precise movements, they assembled the raft, ensuring it was sturdy and well-equipped. Sam's energy and focus were unwavering as they prepared for a possible dive into the sea. As darkness crept in, they worked efficiently, knowing time was of the essence.

In a few moments, they all reached the end of the yard-arm, slid down the rope, and landed on the raft. It was tough to stay on as the ship's movements made the raft rise and fall violently. Sam quickly asked Robin to cut the rope with his axe to free the raft. But just then, the raft was nearly vertical in the air, and Robin clung to the rope for dear life. The ship's stern suddenly shot up and then went down, causing a whirlpool that pulled them in. Sam was the first to resurface, followed by Robin and Slagg, and finally Stumps. Sam swam to save Stumps from drowning, cautioning him not to grab him in panic. Sam held Stumps afloat until he calmed down, shouting instructions to keep still and look for the raft.|"['1.

The sailors were cautious as they prepared to rest, each tying a rope around their waist and securing themselves to the ship's flooring. They clung to the binding-cable, embracing it tightly for comfort. Despite the challenging conditions for sleep, the men tried to find rest. As they awoke to the sound of water, they realized their predicament. A series of accidental kicks and punches among the sleepers brought them fully awake. Sam, having undone his lashings, observed the calm sea and the rising sun, bringing a sense of peace. Reflecting on a verse from a book, they found solace in the idea that God's presence was with them. Despite their dire situation, they sought hope and comfort in the face of uncertainty.|"[""1.

"""Very good,"" said Slagg, surveying his friends and speaking loudly as if addressing an audience. ""Since we're all equal here, I propose we have a meeting of this free and, if I may say so, easy Republic.

As the group settled into their roles, they turned to preparing breakfast. The newly appointed captain scanned the horizon, hoping to spot their missing shipmates but to no avail.

They were quietly moving along with a gentle breeze filling their sail as they rested. Suddenly, a shark approached Stumps, mistaking his foot for sea-worms. Stumps unknowingly avoided a disaster by pulling his leg back just in time. The commotion woke up the others, causing a stir on the raft. As they sailed closer to an island, they speculated on its inhabitants and discussed their approach cautiously. Upon reaching the island, they discovered a hidden vessel and decided to land discreetly. Using a makeshift oar, they navigated towards the coast, evading detection by the men on the vessel.

In a brief moment, the voices approached nearer, causing alarm among the watchers. Suddenly, a group of armed men emerged from the bushes on the other side, armed to the teeth with swords, pistols, and carbines. Dressed in Eastern attire, some appeared of Malay descent while others resembled the Chinese. Their appearance and weaponry hinted at ill intentions. A fierce fight erupted on the vessel where captives had freed themselves and were battling the guards. The slaves, desperate and armed, fought bravely but were eventually overpowered and met a grim fate. Among them was a European sailor who valiantly fought until he was subdued. Despite the grim situation, the sailor's cheer as he was taken below deck left a glimmer of hope. The pirates, preoccupied with their escape, sailed away without noticing the hidden raft.|"[""1.

As they stared in shock, completely unable to decide what to do next, a sudden event changed everything. The pirate ship transformed into a massive black-and-white cloud, hurling broken spars and wreckage into the sea. Moments later, a deafening roar filled the air as the ship exploded, leaving only scattered debris. Among the wreckage were the lifeless bodies of the pirates, attracting circling sharks. A brave sailor, bound and unconscious, was found floating. His rescuers managed to revive him, and he awoke, bewildered by the ordeal. After ensuring no other survivors, they returned to land.

The group had made their way to the valley where a small lake was nestled, surrounded by lush palm trees casting soothing shade. The tropical vegetation was a vibrant display, with sunlight streaming through the foliage. Ducks and other birds frolicked in the lake, and fish could be glimpsed beneath the surface. While some of the party explored further, they found the valley to be even more abundant in plant life than expected, with coconut palms, breadfruit, bananas, and more. They gathered fruit to bring back to Johnson, who was resting. Along the coast where their raft had washed ashore, they found shellfish and sea birds, providing a welcome food source. As they returned, tragedy struck when Robin, carrying their hunt, slipped and fell over a precipice, leaving Letta in shock at the edge.|['1.

Robin's fall was cushioned by trees and bushes, leaving him unconscious but unharmed. Letta, in a panic, tried to wake him to no avail. She rushed to get help, leaving Robin alone. A small monkey nearby, curious and alarmed, cautiously approached Robin. After a sneeze woke Robin, the monkey comically interacted with him, leading to a surprising friendship.

The boy felt comforted when he heard the endearing words, but his joy turned to worry when the monkey responded and leaped into his arms. Sam found it hard to believe that shrubs and trees were grown on a distant island to save an English boy. He kept his doubts to himself, saving them for a future discussion. Meanwhile, Robin and his friends sat outside their cave in the cool evening, discussing various topics. Johnson expressed confusion about electricity, prompting a discussion with Sam. Sam explained that electricity is not a substance but a manifestation of energy resulting from atoms in motion.

Sam and his friends were enjoying a quiet evening meal when Letta burst in, eyes wild with excitement. She revealed a ship approaching the harbor, similar to the one they had seen destroyed earlier. Sam proposed a daring plan to blow up the pirates and their hideout. They armed themselves and set off into the palm-grove, with Letta revealing that the pirates wouldn't harm Meerta or blind Bungo. Meanwhile, the pirates arrived at the cavern, armed and ready for a fight. They discussed seizing the pirate ship and leaving the villains behind. As they prepared to leave, Letta ran to them, seeking refuge.

Silent as they moved, they were not entirely unnoticed. Letta was being watched by two bright eyes all through her night's journey, and two nimble feet followed her when she fled from the pirates' base. The group was caught before reaching the harbor, but to their relief, the pirate ship was still there. Smaller than the previous ship, it was close to the rocks with a gangway for boarding. Sam, Robin, and the others cautiously approached the ship. Sam, skilled in swordplay, swiftly took down the sentinel. Engaging in fierce combat, they fought off the pirates, ensuring they did not use firearms to avoid alerting others.

Stumps, a slow and timid character, fell victim to a larger and fiercer pirate. However, Robin, despite his small stature, displayed remarkable strength and bravery. In a fierce struggle, he used all his might to fight back, finally managing to knock out the pirate. With Letta's fate driving him, Robin's determination prevailed as he freed the captives and engaged in a daring escape. Despite facing a perilous situation with pirates closing in, the captives rowed with all their might to keep the vessel moving. As the pirates swam towards the ship, a tense race against time ensued.

"""Let's give them a few shots, boys,"" shouted Sam, pulling out his own gun and firing back. The others did the same, but the pirates kept advancing. A loud cheer from the British ship scared off the pirates, who turned back towards the shore. Sam decided to leave the pirates on a small rock islet, where they could be found by their friends. The pirates, although alive, were no longer a threat. The ship they had captured was a pirate ship from the Malay Archipelago, carrying exhausted slaves. Some slaves were kept in chains, while the sick ones were cared for by Letta and Sam. The group decided to sail to Sarawak, where Letta might find her parents. The journey was full of adventures and dangers, but they finally reached Sarawak and were welcomed by the deputy. The group's main focus became finding Letta's parents, setting aside thoughts of returning to England or modern inventions like electricity.

That evening, Robin tried to comfort Letta, who was upset about not finding her mother, while Sam consoled Stumps for losing his treasure. Letta continued to cry despite Robin's efforts, and Stumps adamantly refused any comfort. The talk of the town in Bombay revolved around a significant event - the direct connection of India to England through a deep-sea cable. This was crucial as the existing land telegraph system was inefficient due to passing through multiple countries, causing delays. The presence of a massive ship added to the excitement, attracting large crowds. Sam mentioned meeting a friend who worked on the cable, and they headed to the cable landing-house near Back Bay. The house overlooked the bay and was being prepared for the cable's arrival. Native workers were busy assembling the house for future telegraphic needs.

Sam mentioned a steamer full of Hindu and Parsee women and children who came to see the ship, creating a colorful scene with their vibrant clothing and jewelry. The interest from the locals in the Great Eastern was immense, with unexpected crowds flocking to see the ship despite high entry fees. The ship was swarmed by Parsees, Hindus, and Muslims marveling at the vessel. Amidst the excitement, a young boy fell into the water, prompting a swift rescue by Robin. The incident led to a discussion about the challenges of land-based telegraph lines, contrasting them with the reliability of submarine cables. Despite the boy's rescue, concerns lingered about the safety of communication lines in the region.

Robin and Sam were blindfolded and led out of the house by their captors, who seemed eager to obey their superior. Despite thoughts of resistance, the sharp instruments near their necks and the tight grip on them deterred any attempts. Eventually, they discovered that their captors were none other than themselves, using their own handkerchiefs as blindfolds. Lost in the night, they sought help from a guardian, explaining they were lost. Guided towards the port, they stumbled upon a scene of engineers laying a mile of land-line to connect a cable, surrounded by soldiers and locals working through the night with great enthusiasm and noise. The completion of the task marked the first link in the submarine telegraphy chain between India and England. The cable was carefully transferred to a barge, with men guiding its every movement to ensure a successful deployment into the sea.|['1.

A grand procession took place at the shore. First, a Government steam-tug led the way, adorned with flags fluttering from top to bottom. Following closely was a barge carrying precious cargo, trailed by two boats filled with cable-hands. An official gig, pulled by a Chinaman, and the vigilant steam-launch Electric completed the procession. The tug and Electric worked together to draw the barge safely to shore. Cable-hands then hauled a hawser to the shore, attaching it to the cable. The cable was pulled to land, tested by electricians, and secured for use. The Great Eastern ship was prepared for its voyage after a few more days, culminating in a celebratory luncheon onboard with prominent figures from Bombay. The merchant shared insights on the history of ocean telegraphy, highlighting the challenges and triumphs of laying the first transatlantic cable.|['1.

When I think of all these things and more, I believe the toast I propose is worthy of celebration. Let's raise our glasses to the Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company. This remarkable company has laid numerous cables and is now embarking on connecting India with England. Robin and Sam were captivated by the plans, noting milestones like the cable's construction starting just nine months ago. Captain Halpin successfully laid the French Atlantic cable, and soon, Bombay will be linked to Malta, then England. By 1871, India will be connected to China, Australia, Europe, and America through submarine telegraph lines. Sam, a renowned electrician, shared his excitement for this groundbreaking project, envisioning messages reaching destinations within minutes. Sam even sent a telegram to aid in recovering stolen property.|"['1.

Sam, feeling a bit concerned, mentioned that the situation couldn't be changed now. He believed that the accused person couldn't be put on trial until they testified as witnesses. However, dear reader, we won't go into the intricate details of laying a deep-sea cable again. The process of laying this cable was quite similar to what was previously explained, but with improvements in machinery based on time and experience. The laying of the Indian cable was notably successful, lacking any exciting incidents. We will briefly touch on a couple of interesting aspects and then move on to the more crucial events of our tale. Robin and his friends approached a large ship surrounded by native boats selling various goods like bananas, parrots, monkeys, and more. The Great Eastern lifted its anchor on February 14, 1870, and connected the cable on board to the shore-end, with the Governor of Bombay present for the occasion. The ship smoothly began its journey towards Aden, with the cable-laying process going well. Sam mentioned that the ship had two gongs that were only used in emergencies, ensuring a quick response to any issues. The crew was vigilant, and even a false alarm caused a commotion, showcasing their alertness. The deck of the Great Eastern was a bustling scene, with various activities and animals like goats, chickens, and monkeys roaming around. The machinery worked flawlessly, and the cable was laid into the sea with precision and efficiency. The electrician in Bombay once complained about a|"[""1.

The cable-laying operation on the Great Eastern ship was a tense affair. The after-tank was a deep pit lit by swinging lamps, resembling a church underground. The crew worked diligently to manage the massive cable coil. The captain gave quiet instructions as the engineers and electricians stood ready. As the cable unraveled smoothly, disaster was narrowly averted. The cable's tendency to tangle was a constant threat, but the crew managed to avoid any serious mishaps. The successful voyage concluded in Aden, marking the completion of the cable-laying project. The crew, including our hero and his companions, prepared to return to England.
