"Polly Brewster grew up on a ranch in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. Until she was fourteen, she had never ventured beyond Oak Creek, the local railroad station. One summer, Eleanor Maynard, daughter of a wealthy Chicago banker, joined Polly, her sister Barbara, and their teacher Anne Stewart at the ranch. Their adventures are chronicled in ""Polly of Pebbly Pit."" After discovering a gold mine on Grizzly Slide, Polly and her friends sought help from John Brewster and Tom Latimer. The success of the mine led Polly and Eleanor to accompany Anne to New York. In the third book, the girls navigate school life, theatrical performances, and encounters with new friends.

The radio message informed Tom and Polly's close friends in New York had secured passes to visit the quarantined ship aboard Mr. Dalken's yacht at eight o'clock that evening. Despite the delay in explaining Polly's situation, the five girls continued their lively conversation. Dorothy suspected Polly had a secret admirer but admired her friend's discretion in keeping it private. Eleanor, eager to uncover the mystery, agreed to Dorothy's plan to visit the wireless room. There, they learned from the operator that the Inspector General of Quarantine had facilitated the visit. The girls were surprised by the revelation and joked about Polly's admirers. Eleanor shared that Tom, a family friend, was Polly's brother's college mate, and they anticipated a gathering of old friends on the yacht that night.|"[""1.

Dorothy was astonished as Eleanor confidently spoke, unaware of Eleanor's upbringing in Chicago's elite social circles. Eleanor's precocious nature stemmed from her upbringing before meeting Polly at Pebbly Pit. Their habits were deeply ingrained. The operator suggested the message should have been sent to an adult. Eleanor and Dorothy pretended to read the wireless message to deceive their friends. The girls prepared for a yacht party to welcome them home. Mr. Fabian announced the yacht invitation from their old friend Dalken. The girls, in their elegant gowns, enjoyed a festive dinner. Later, a white yacht arrived, carrying young guests. The Fabian group watched eagerly as the boat approached the steamer.|"[""1.

"Polly responded sharply, ""I saw yours! And now I get why all you talk about is beaus and Fate! You're so absorbed in your own dreams that you think everyone must be dreaming the same stuff!"" She quickly joined Mr. Fabian in greeting the visitors, with the other girls following suit. Among the first arrivals were Tom Latimer, his brother Jim, Kenneth Evans, Paul Stewart, and John Brewster with his bride Anne. Happy greetings were exchanged, but Polly intentionally avoided showing extra attention to Tom, despite his deserving it more than Jim and Kenneth. Eleanor openly favored Paul, separating from the group for the evening. Anne explained the boat's return for the second group, bringing Polly's parents, the Stewarts, Latimers, Evans, and Mr. Dalken. The family and friends formed a joyful group on the boat, creating envy among other passengers. The moonlit evening added a romantic touch to the gathering. Eleanor and Paul's affection was evident, and Polly observed them before engaging with her brother John and encountering Tom, who shared news about Grizzly Slide. Tom misunderstood Polly's behavior, sulking as she joined her friends. Mr. Dalken, noticing the situation, tried to ease Polly's unease and encourage Tom. Polly firmly asserted her dedication to her profession of interior decorating, inspired by her European travels. Her parents admired her determination, while Tom struggled with his feelings towards Polly's career focus."|"['1.

When Mr. Dalken noticed that he had brought up a risky topic for Polly and Tom, he had a clever idea. He promptly acted on it. He excused himself from his group of friends and went to find the Captain. Shortly after, the passengers heard lively dance music playing, and quickly, many of the younger passengers rushed to the Grand Salon. Dancing came naturally to Polly, and she moved gracefully, just like when she rode horses on the ranch or hiked in the Rockies. Kenneth Evans, the youngest man in the group, guided Polly through the dancers, drawing much attention. Meanwhile, Tom sulked as he watched Polly dance, refusing to join in despite being a sought-after dance partner. Eleanor, dancing with Paul, was thoroughly enjoying herself, forgetting about others' romantic entanglements. An impish resistance overcame Polly, leading her to tell Tom to engage in conversations about work and money with other men, as she preferred youthful fun. Tom, hurt by her words, left without a word, feeling shattered. Meanwhile, Kenneth was puzzled by the situation, not understanding girls' subtleties. Tom, feeling miserable, sat in the smoking room until a friend, John, told him Anne wanted to speak with him. Anne, perceiving Tom's disappointment, advised him on understanding Polly's behavior.|"['1.

Anne spoke to Tom, cautioning him about Polly's focus on her studies and her lack of interest in romantic relationships at the moment. She emphasized that Polly's priority was her education and that any thoughts of love or marriage were premature for her age. Anne advised Tom to be a supportive friend to Polly and not to rush into any romantic gestures. She explained that Polly's upbringing in the mountains had shaped her into a young woman with a passion for art and learning. Anne highlighted that Polly's current aspirations revolved around her studies and creative pursuits, and that any romantic distractions would only hinder her progress. Tom understood Anne's perspective and acknowledged the importance of respecting Polly's ambitions and not pressuring her into a relationship. Anne, John, and Tom then assisted the girls in moving their belongings to the yacht as they prepared to depart from the steamer.|"['1.

As the group prepared to depart, their fellow passengers gathered around to bid farewell. The young friends left first on the boat, while the older members followed shortly after. However, as the yacht sailed back up the River near 72nd street, a thick haze turned into a dense fog, obscuring everything beyond a few feet. The Captain and crew worked swiftly to navigate through the fog, with fog-horns blaring and lights guiding the way. Amidst the chaos, Tom and Polly found themselves at the side of the craft when a larger vessel collided with their yacht, causing them to fall into the dark sea. Polly, terrified of the water, fainted, but Tom, a skilled swimmer, held on to her and remained calm as he prepared to save them both.|['1.

In a swift turn of events, Tom found himself in a perilous situation after a collision at sea. With Polly unconscious, he used all his strength to swim away from danger. Despite the obstacles of his clothing and shoes, Tom managed to keep Polly afloat and swim towards safety. The fog that caused the accident also shielded them from further harm. As Tom navigated the changing tide, a glimmer of light and the sound of a bell-buoy gave hope. Eventually, a motorboat rescued them, bringing them to safety. Tom's quick thinking and determination led to their rescue, with Polly receiving the necessary medical attention. The ordeal ended with Tom and Polly safe on solid ground, thanks to the timely assistance of the guards and the boatman.|"['1.

When the doctor rushed in, his wife followed. Tom sat up and recounted the accident. He asked for the Wharf Police to be alerted about a possible yacht in trouble. If inquiries were made, they were to be told that both Polly and he were safe on Liberty Island. A Corporal delivered the messages, and Tom was taken to a cot in the Barracks. He was given warm blankets and hot lemonade, soon falling asleep. Polly was cared for by the doctor's wife at their cottage. Both slept in, and when Tom woke, he found his suit ready. The doctor informed them that their families were safe and coming to take them home. Tom and Polly laughed with relief. Tom felt stiff but dressed quickly, eager to check on Polly.|"[""1.

"Polly was relieved to hear him speak in such a way, but her next act was the outgrowth of spontaneous gratitude. She flung both arms about his neck and being too short to reach his cheek, kissed him on the chin as she would have done had he been John. Tom trembled, but realized at the same time, that Polly's kiss meant nothing. Still he was humbly grateful for even that token of gratitude from the reserved girl. Then he hurried on to say that no one on the yacht had been injured by the collision, but they were hours in reaching their dock. He said that they (Polly and Tom) were not missed at first, and not until conditions had calmed down somewhat, did Eleanor call for Polly. Then it was found that neither Tom nor Polly were to be found. ""It was Eleanor who remembered seeing us promenade along the side where the rail was detachable, and it was Eleanor who said we must have been thrown out where the steps came up.

When Tom arrived home, he was full of energy and rebelled against being told to stay quiet. He felt better than he had in months, and his happiness was evident in his lively spirit. Tom believed that Polly's kiss that morning signaled the beginning of love, not just gratitude. Unable to focus on anything else, he repeatedly called John to inquire about Polly, who was resting. Despite Tom's eagerness to visit, John insisted that Polly needed more rest. Anne teased Polly about Tom's interest, suggesting he seemed more like a brother than a potential suitor. Tom anticipated a warm reception from Polly, hoping for a romantic connection he thought he saw in her eyes at the hospital. However, Polly's friendly but indifferent demeanor left Tom disappointed. Anne unknowingly kept Tom's heartfelt message hidden, leading to misunderstandings.|"[""1.

Tom attempted to engage Polly in conversation but failed, so he let Anne take the lead. However, even she found it challenging to entertain two quiet individuals. When Polly finally spoke, Tom felt guilty for doubting her. He jokingly mentioned how his brother viewed him through a critical lens. Polly then shared a story about a run-in with thieves who aimed to steal gold from their mine. Rattlesnake Mike thwarted the thieves' plans, leading to their imprisonment. Meanwhile, a deceitful former clerk conspired with criminals to rob the mine while the family was away. Mike, sensing trouble, gathered men to protect the mine. They camped out, vigilant for any signs of an impending raid. Jeb, another watchful ally, took precautions to safeguard the mine until the family returned.|"['1.

The following day, Mike felt reassured as the men mocked his suspicions. The remote location and the silent mountains boosted their confidence in peace. That night, while the men played cards by the fire, Mike and his loyal hound were vigilant. The wooden flume nearby caught their attention. The hound's alertness and Mike's keen senses detected unusual sounds. Investigating further, they discovered someone tampering with the flume, trying to gain access to the mine. Despite being ridiculed by the men, Mike took action, assigning guards and planning a defense. When the intruders attempted an attack, Mike and his men, aided by the fierce hound, thwarted the raid.

Mike, along with his companions, managed to restrain the trespassers after a fierce struggle. Despite the others' desire to take harsher actions, Mike prevented them from seeking retribution by washing the culprits down the river. The following day, they handed the captured raiders to the constable for trial. However, the troublemakers caused chaos in Oak Creek, leading to further vandalism and violence. The sheriff intervened to stop a planned attack on Pebbly Pit, resulting in a dramatic confrontation at the Cliffs. The culprits were eventually subdued, facing lengthy jail sentences.

Polly chuckled, feeling fortunate for the unexpected turn of events. She expressed relief at not leaving Eleanor behind in Europe and missing out on their exciting tour. Tom, on the other hand, mentioned his upcoming journey to the West to prepare for winter storms at the mines. Despite his initial plans, Tom admitted that unforeseen events had stalled his progress since leaving Pebbly Pit. He shared his decision to work at Mr. Ashby's shop, gaining experience in textiles and interior decorating. Tom's new schedule meant limited time for correspondence, focusing on work, exhibitions, and school. Polly and her friends settled in New York, with the Fabians living nearby. Meanwhile, the Alexanders adjusted to a routine life in their apartment, with Mrs. Alexander feeling discontented about the change.|"['1.

Mrs. Alexander was tired of listening to Dodo talk about columns and piers while Ebeneezer was impossible to get along with. To escape, she spent her evenings at theaters and clubs, shopping around the city. The girls received their antiques from abroad and visited Mr. Ashby's shop to admire them.

Mr. Fabian then romanticized the antiques, renewing the girls' interest. Mr. Ashby suggested the girls take trips to find antiques in New England.

After a few more miles, the passengers in the car spotted a small one-story farmhouse surrounded by land. Attached at the back was a two-story addition that seemed to make up for the modesty of the main house. The car stopped, and the ladies peered out to explore the old place. A ten-year-old girl emerged and watched the visitors. She then leaned on the picket gate, inviting them in as her mother was busy kneading bread. The guests got out of the car, and Mrs. Fabian expressed interest in buying a dozen. Inside, the woman shared a story about her husband and their old furniture. Mrs. Fabian offered to buy a brass lamp in exchange for the old candlesticks and a glass pitcher. The guests were surprised by the valuable glass jug and left with their new acquisitions.

Mrs. Tomlinson agreed to let Sarah go and then proudly guided her guests through the house. She warned them not to mind the dirt, although the corners were spotless and the furniture meticulously arranged. The parlor was a source of pride for Mrs. Tomlinson, reserved for Sundays when Sarah played the melodian and hymns were sung. In the winter, neighbors would gather for quilting-bees, but the room was too cold for casual visits.

Polly and Eleanor were unfamiliar with back-farm auctions, having only been to city auctions in Paris. Carl drove them to the rural auction, with Mrs. Fabian in tow. The sale was delayed, and the girls observed farmers chatting about crops while their wives discussed canning and neighbors.

Mrs. Fabian and the girls quickly explored the old house, stumbling upon a hidden attic. Excitedly, they discovered a treasure trove of antique items.

Oddly, the warning about the crowded room seemed to draw more people in. The girls, being early, found good spots. Mrs. Fabian suggested they climb on tables or chairs to see above the crowd. The country folk found this amusing. Polly, eager for more treasures, smiled and nodded at the salesman, indicating she would bid. A man inquired about the items for sale. The women were unaware of bedding in the kitchen, focusing on the blankets in the adjacent bedrooms. The girls made surprising purchases, causing them to lose their composure temporarily.

The two small bedrooms were too crowded, so Abner was told to move the items for sale outside onto the lawn. This allowed everyone to see them clearly. Thanks to this wise decision, Polly found a beautiful set of Staffordshire toilet-ware for only four dollars. The set included a unique ewer, a basin that could double as a punch-bowl, a soap dish, a mug, and a commode. The rich colors and good condition of the china pieces impressed Polly. A young man shared that the set had been in his family for over a century, used only for special occasions. Despite facing criticism for his spending habits, he had to sell his farm due to financial troubles. Polly hoped his move out west would bring him a fresh start. Mrs. Fabian allowed the girls to watch the sale until the house was empty, then they headed back home with their bargains.

Mrs. Fabian expressed her gratitude and went back to the girls to share the conversation she had with the shopkeeper. They all agreed to visit the old church and cemetery, so Carl drove them there. At the ancient burial ground, they read unique inscriptions on the headstones, and the girls even copied some down. Afterward, they returned to the car, and Mrs. Fabian suggested stopping at the Public Library to inquire about notable historical spots nearby. The librarian mentioned places like Mendham, New Vernon, and Baskingridge known for antiques from Revolutionary times. The girls then decided to visit Van Styne's old auction rooms and explore old farmhouses in the area. Van Styne, an auctioneer, had a store filled with second-hand furniture and antiques. When they arrived, they found Van Styne napping in his office, and he welcomed them to browse around.|"['1.

The girls followed Mrs. Fabian, trying not to burst into laughter at the enthusiastic salesman. They searched through old items, getting their gloves and dresses dirty, but found nothing valuable. Polly then found an old chest of drawers pushed away from the wall. Behind it, she uncovered dusty framed pictures forgotten by the auctioneer. Eleanor cleaned one frame revealing a dusty engraving of Independence Hall and the Declaration of Independence. The girls joked about finding bargain frames. When Mrs. Fabian removed the back of one picture, she discovered a yellowed newspaper and a letter to Paul Revere, signed by a famous Revolutionary figure, hidden inside. The group was amazed by this unexpected historical find.|"['1.

A historic discovery was made by Mrs. Fabian and the girls while exploring an old letter found in Paul Revere's home in Morristown. The letter, which turned out to be an advertisement from a Squire in Baskingridge selling a young negro wench, led them to a rare newspaper with news of George Washington's death. As they marveled at the old newspaper, they stumbled upon a valuable color-print of the famous Bridge at Avignon from the sixteenth century. With clever tactics, they decided to bargain for the valuable picture by disguising it among less valuable frames.

Orders were given to pack up camp quickly. The men toiled through the night, stowing gear, tools, and movable machinery inside the cave.

The horses grazed on Buffalo grass, and a fire was started for cooking. Tom and John tried fishing when thunder rumbled. Suddenly, a massive avalanche on Grizzly Peak startled them. The men were amazed as the snow-capped peak disappeared, replaced by a cloud of debris. The avalanche thundered down the mountain, uprooting trees and boulders, filling ravines along the way. The ranch below narrowly escaped being buried under the tons of debris. Despite the danger, the miners finished their meal and rode back to assess the damage. Anne at the ranch witnessed the peak's top break off and the avalanche unfold. The ranch shook, prompting fears for the safety of the miners.

However, Eleanor shared this information in confidence, without explicitly stating that it should be kept secret.

Young Baxter pondered as Eleanor hesitated before responding.
