""Absolutely. I am truly the Slave of the Master Key and must obey anyone who is wise and brave enough – or, as in your case, lucky and daring enough – to touch it."" ""I-I never knew there was a Master Key or a Demon of Electricity, and I'm really sorry I called you up!"" stuttered the boy, feeling embarrassed by his companion's imposing presence. ""I'm not sorry,"" he said more kindly. ""Waiting for centuries for someone to command my services hasn't been much fun. I've often felt my existence was unnecessary since Earthlings are so ignorant about electrical power."" ""You are wrong to think they are amazing,"" replied the Demon. ""They know little more than you do about electricity. Their inventions are small compared to what could be achieved by someone who truly understands how to control electric power. I've stood by Edison for months, hoping he would touch the Master Key, but it seems he never will."" ""Many believe that Mars is home to advanced beings. Some think Martians have been trying to communicate with us, but we don't understand. Yet, I know all about Mars and other planets. Mars is not inhabited, and neither are the other planets.

"""The lives of people are busy,"" said the Demon, ""they need to move around a lot. But the machines they have like trolleys, cars, and trains are slow and often break. Men haven't realized that the air can be a fast way to travel, like birds do. There are forces in nature that can help with this. One force is gravity, which pulls things down. Another force, repulsion, can push things up. Then there are the Polar electric forces that attract things to the poles. Opposing these is centrifugal electric force, pulling things from east to west. These forces are available for people to use, if they know how. The Demon showed a small machine that can be attached to the wrist to control these forces for flying. He gave the boy this machine to use for a week. The Demon promised to return with more gifts next week."""|"[""1.

"The Demon replied, ""Probably not. If you could achieve that, you might command my services forever. But since you have succeeded once, you are entitled to nine gifts, three each week for three weeks, so there's no need to summon me again. I shall appear on my own."" With a bow and a spread of his hands, there was a blinding flash, and the Demon of Electricity vanished. A grown man might have trembled or felt fear, but a boy like Rob took it in stride. Delighted by his good fortune, Rob decided to keep the Demon and the Master Key a secret. He felt a sense of pride and planned to surprise his friends with his new electrical abilities. After taking a tablet from a silver box, Rob's hunger was satisfied, and he felt a pleasant glow and mental clarity. His parents discussed his pursuit of knowledge and health, but Rob assured them of his well-being and readiness for his scientific journey."|"['1.

"The feeling was amazing. He glided effortlessly, outpacing a rushing train. ""This is fantastic!"" he mused. ""Traveling without a fare and food for a month in my pocket. Electricity is incredible! The Demon is truly something. Whee-ee! Everything looks tiny below. People like bugs, houses like soap-boxes, trees like grass clumps. Passing over a town, he descended to observe but found nothing intriguing. Rising again, he headed east. By 2 o'clock, he landed in Boston, unseen, exploring for hours. The dog attacked with a growl, but Rob swiftly subdued it with his electric tube. An officer threatened, but Rob immobilized him too. Escaping, Rob reflected on the narrow escape, relieved the policeman would recover soon."|"[""1.

As the sun began to set, Rob pondered his next move. Lacking money, he chose to travel through the night. He recalled it had been a day since he last ate, so he consumed another tablet, relieving his hunger and energizing him. Eventually, fatigue overcame him, and he drifted off, unaware he was heading southeast over the ocean instead of southwest to Cuba. The next day, he found himself over a vast sea, realizing he was off course. He reasoned he would eventually reach land and could return to Boston by adjusting his direction northwest. Unbeknownst to him, he was nearing the island of Brava. Landing on a grassy hilltop, Rob marveled at the untouched surroundings. After resting, he explored the island, cautious of its inhabitants. As night fell, he slept peacefully, ready to continue his adventure in the morning.|"['1.

Rob kneeled down to drink water when suddenly a rope coiled around him, trapping him. Surrounding him were natives with a frightening appearance, armed with spears and clubs. Their long, curly hair was adorned with shark teeth and metal ornaments. Helpless, Rob was led away by the captors. Determined, he rubbed the rope against a sharp stone to free himself. Just in time, he broke free as the captors prepared a fire. Unfazed, Rob used an electric tube to subdue a native, surprising the others. The chief, astonished, reacted in their language.|"['1.

Laughing with amusement at the chubby figure, Rob followed the leader and found himself in the heart of the native village. A large fire crackled cheerfully as the villagers busily prepared for a feast. Surrounded by a group of locals, who chattered fiercely and made threatening gestures, Rob remained calm. The chief's warning kept the crowd at bay, allowing Rob to make a quick escape. Rising into the air with his traveling machine, Rob's relief turned to panic as the mechanism malfunctioned, leaving him stranded near the glowing embers of the fire. The fat chief, suspicious of white men, attempted to help but ended up falling in fear. Rob, now seen as a god by the villagers, made a dignified exit, planning his next move to outsmart the cannibals and escape the island.|"[""1.

"""He thought they might starve me into surrender,"" he pondered. ""But as long as my tablets last, they won't succeed. Even if they starve me, I'll be too tough to eat. I'll outsmart them."" He lay down to inspect his electrical machine. Not daring to disassemble it, he noticed two dents on the edge from the rope's pressure. Trying to fix it with a knife failed. He pressed it between stones to reshape it. As he flew over the ocean, natives below shouted and threw spears. Dodging obstacles, he neared a ship with a menacing crew. When they attacked, he used the electric tube, rendering them motionless. Exploring the ship, he found stolen goods. Concerned about his damaged machine, he accidentally dropped it, fearing it was ruined. After a frantic search, he found it, slightly damaged but salvageable.

Rob was on a ship with dangerous pirates. The pirates tried to steal from him, but Rob used a special machine he had to rise into the air and escape. The pirates tried to grab him, but the machine lifted them too. Rob soared into the sky, carrying the pirates dangling from his leg. They were scared and shouted as they flew through the air.

Rob was amazed by his success, attributing it to a jar that had relieved pressure on the machine. Gliding through the air, he observed a storm below while the sun shone above. As the storm subsided, he descended towards the ocean. Despite irregular machine motion, he continued towards land. Anxious nights followed, fearing machine failure. Doubts arose about his direction, but he eventually neared his village. Landing in his backyard, he recounted his adventures, met with doubtful looks. Enjoying a meal with his family, he savored the taste, realizing the tablets lacked flavor. Returning to his workshop, he reflected on his inventions and the missed potential to benefit mankind. The Demon lamented the missed opportunity to advance electrical engineering.|"['1.

The Demon chastised the man for wasting his gifts on ignorant natives instead of showcasing them to the world's advanced minds. The Demon then offered a new protective garment that repels projectiles like bullets and swords. The man was advised to wear it underneath his clothes for safety. The Demon also introduced an incredible electrical device that could show real-time events in any country. This device was operated by turning a wheel to select the country of interest and then opening the top cover to view the events.

The Demon opened a cover, revealing a moving picture like a mirror. A regiment marched in Berlin, with the Emperor leading. The people cheered as a band played. Next, a warship entered a harbor with officers and men eagerly awaiting. In an underground room, desperate men plotted against the Emperor.

Goodness, wisdom, and kindness are natural forces that shape character. People may not always be at fault for having a bad character since they can unknowingly acquire it. Character emits electrical vibrations that can be concentrated and seen through special spectacles. With these abilities and the ones acquired recently, one can amaze the world and awaken people to the wonders achievable by natural forces. It is crucial to use these powers wisely for scientific purposes and only reveal them to those who can understand. Rob, a typical American boy, possesses average intelligence and a keen interest in electricity. He is full of youthful recklessness but is now more thoughtful due to possessing electrical marvels.

Late at night, Rob quietly prepared for his journey. He marked his route on a map under the starlight, set his compass, and soared into the air. As he flew, he fell asleep and awoke to a vast ocean below. Approaching a ship, he sped away to avoid being seen. Rising above the clouds to escape a rainstorm, he watched a battle in the Philippines and a play production. Upon awakening from a nap, he found himself over land. Descending, he accidentally dropped an electric tube that could shock people. To prevent harm, he landed and removed the tube. The curious villagers gathered below, amazed by his presence.|"['1.

The villagers turned against the boy, pelting him with stones and sticks, but his magical Garment of Repulsion shielded him. Realizing he was in Ireland, he consulted his map to head towards England. After a series of direction changes, he landed in London discreetly, seeking refuge in a church bell tower. Descending, he emerged into the city and witnessed a fierce battle in South Africa through a magical Record of Events.

Hemmed in by much larger numbers, the English bravely resisted the enemy, fighting for every inch. Despite their leader falling, the king witnessed a miraculous sight: a line of English soldiers appeared over the hills, running to rescue their comrades.

The force pushing him was strong, making the landscape blur past him quickly. Rob had traveled far from Vienna, but his lack of geography knowledge left him disoriented. As he flew over Turkestan, he encountered a group of armed men on the desert below. Deciding not to engage, he continued towards a walled city. The city, Yarkand, was serene and deserted, surrounded by sandy plains. Rob, feeling drowsy, rested under a tree, awaiting the approaching warriors.

The sun shone on the shiny surface of the travel device linked to Rob's wrist, making the metal sparkle like silver. The tallest Turk noticed and slyly removed the device from Rob's arm. Rob stirred as the Turk tied his hands behind his back with a rope, waking him. The Turk took Rob's belongings, including the electric tube, but couldn't figure out how to use it. Rob, realizing his situation, felt fear creeping in. The Turk leader tried to attack Rob, but the Garment of Repulsion defended him. The other Turks then shot at Rob, but he laughed at their failed attempt. They were puzzled by his defense. Eventually, they cut his bonds and led him to their chief, a fierce warrior riding a black camel. Rob, feeling helpless, faced the imposing chief without fear.|"['1.

Rob, unable to communicate verbally with the chief, resorted to using sign language. He displayed the bruises on his wrists caused by tight cords and gestured angrily towards the town. The warriors were setting up tents for a siege. Following orders, Rob was given weapons to fight the Turks. Despite the fierce appearance of his companions, he saw them as allies compared to the Turks. When the Turks attacked, Rob bravely joined the battle, impressing his new friends. Despite feeling vulnerable without his gadgets, he fought courageously. The Tatar chief rewarded Rob with a ring for his bravery.

The boy was filled with excitement, desperate to regain the valuable weapon from the Turk. Despite trying to communicate that he would show the Turk how to use it, the man wouldn't release it. Rob then noticed his ruby ring and offered it in exchange. The Turk agreed, but when Rob handed over the ring, the man tried to flee. In a moment of anger and self-defense, Rob used the weapon, causing the Turk to fall motionless. Searching the Turk's pockets, Rob found his food tablets.

After that, everyone avoided the boy. Soon, the Turkish forces were conquered, most unconscious except a few who hid. Rob searched for the thieves who robbed him but found none.

The sailors showed no interest in the relation. Witnessing their awful disappointment, one sailor even wept on his comrade's shoulder in unrestrained grief due to their suffering.
