After a brief silence, the group finished their meal and sat down to rest. Each lost in thought, pondering until they had something important to say. Henry's mind wandered but always returned to one topic. In Pittsburgh, they had heard tales of a renowned Mohawk chief named Thayendanegea, known to the Americans as Brant. Filled with animosity towards the encroaching white settlers, Thayendanegea's intentions were clear. Henry suspected a meeting between Thayendanegea and Timmendiquas, a formidable warrior. Believing Timmendiquas was heading east to a council house of the Six Nations, the group decided to follow. As they journeyed cautiously through the wilderness, signs of Indian presence heightened their vigilance. Camping by a creek, they prepared for the night, aware of the potential dangers ahead. Long Jim kept watch, while the others speculated on the brewing conflict between White Lightning and Thayendanegea, anticipating trouble on the horizon.|"[""1.

The small lodge stood on an island in the swamp, surrounded by tall vegetation dripping with cold water. Despite the dismal surroundings, Henry discovered the abandoned hut and felt relief. The lodge, made of poles and bark, showed signs of weathering but still stood. Inside, he found old Indian items like a woven basket and a carved wooden spoon. Henry deduced that the hut was likely used for hunting, providing shelter and comfort for a warrior who once frequented it.

Henry, a strong and skillful boy, took shelter in a dilapidated lodge made of poles and bark. Despite the leaky roof, he patched it up with bark and wood, then lit a fire using flint and steel. The flames warmed the lodge, drying his wet clothes and providing comfort. Henry luxuriated in the cozy warmth, feeling the heat seep through him, drying every nook and cranny. Satisfied that he was prepared for the night, he hung his blanket to dry and sat by the fire, content despite his hunger.

In the last hour or two, Henry stayed motionless near the fire, feeling the warmth sustaining him. Outside, the rain and hail continued to fall relentlessly. Henry felt like he was alone in a dark world. Yet, within the small hut, he found comfort and warmth. Ignoring his hunger pangs, he slept deeply. As dawn broke, the hunger became unbearable, driving him to seek food despite the risks. Henry ventured out into the rain, hoping to find game, but the animals were scarce. His intense hunger consumed his thoughts as he searched in vain. Time passed slowly as he trudged through the wet woods, his determination unwavering.|"['1.

Gazing at the dark horizon once more, he spotted a thin, dark line of smoke, signaling an Indian camp nearby. Despite the danger, he headed towards it, relieved to find others in the wilderness. Approaching cautiously, he saw around twenty Mohawk warriors cooking various meats over fires. The aroma, though enticing, only intensified his hunger. Envious of their feast, he contemplated a daring plan to steal food but wisely retreated, realizing the risk. Frustrated and famished, he reluctantly turned away, pondering how to ease his gnawing hunger. As he left, he watched a warrior devour meat, fueling his anger.

The boy, Henry, had been on a long journey back, growing weak as he made his way through dense bushes. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a dark opening under fallen trees. Thinking it might be a wild animal's lair, he cautiously aimed his rifle inside. A growl echoed, and a black bear lunged out. Henry, startled yet brave, fired his rifle swiftly, hitting the bear on the head. The bear fell lifeless. Henry, now transformed, realized he had food for many days. Despite the weight, he carried the bear back to his hut. There, he skinned and cooked the bear, relishing every bite with deep gratitude. As he slept, a panther approached, lured by the scent of food. Henry, alert even in slumber, scared it away with a fiery stick.|"['1.

The boy skillfully struck the panther's eyes with a stick, causing it to yelp in pain and retreat. Feeling safe in his hut, he laughed at the forest joke. Determined to find his missing comrades, he made the swamp islet his base. After securing his food from prowling panthers, he set out to search for his friends. The rain and gloomy clouds provided cover as he observed Indian hunters. Despite the danger, he pressed on, confident his comrades were alive.

At dusk, the rain stopped, and Henry readied himself for a nighttime journey. He checked his dry powder and counted his bullets, then glanced at the moonlit sky. With just enough moonlight to guide him discreetly, he left the islet for the Indian camp. Confident that the hunters had returned, he moved swiftly through the forest. Approaching the camp, he noticed an increase in its population, evident from the new trails and lack of concealment. Despite the camp's security, Henry worried about dogs alerting the Indians. Observing the warriors in the camp, he noted their war paint and diverse appearances, suggesting a gathering of various Iroquois tribes. As Henry observed the chiefs conversing near him, he realized they anticipated someone significant. Hidden in the shadows, he closely watched the camp's activities, intrigued by the chiefs' expressions and attire.|"['1.

The group fell silent as a distant wailing note from the west reached their ears. A figure emerged from the forest, entirely naked except for a breech cloth and moccasins. It was a Wyandot warrior, known by his paint. The chiefs awaited the arrival of Timmendiquas, head chief of the Wyandots, who approached with his companions. Timmendiquas, a splendid figure, met the representatives of the Six Nations. Henry, though hiding, admired Timmendiquas and was pleased by the admiration he garnered. The chiefs, including Timmendiquas, sat before the fire in silence, smoking a ceremonial pipe. Another warrior arrived from the east, signaling the arrival of a man of great importance. The chiefs awaited this new arrival with anticipation. When the man, dressed in fine blue cloth with silver adornments, emerged from the forest, followed by several others, it was evident he was a great chief.

The new leader moved confidently into the clearing, breaking the silence that enveloped everyone. Timmendiquas stepped forward to greet him. The eyes of all present were fixed on these two figures as they met in the middle, acknowledging each other's presence with a solemn salute. Henry suddenly recognized the stranger as the renowned Mohawk war chief, Thayendanegea, also known as Brant among the white settlers. His imposing demeanor and the blend of military and tribal attire gave him away. Thayendanegea and Timmendiquas, both young and proud, returned to the fire where a pipe was passed around. The council was significant, bringing together delegates and chiefs from the Six Nations to meet the warlike Wyandots. Thayendanegea, a key figure, spoke of the Iroquois' deep-rooted beliefs in nature and the Great Spirit, captivating the audience with his allegorical tales.|"['1.

The meeting between Timmendiquas and Thayendanegea held great significance. Thayendanegea spoke of uniting the tribes to defend the land given by Aieroski. Timmendiquas agreed, proposing a joint effort to push back the invaders. Henry, hidden nearby, observed the intense conversation. He recognized Braxton Wyatt, a renegade who had betrayed his own people. Henry felt a deep repulsion towards Wyatt for his treachery. As the two chiefs discussed their plans, Henry remained focused on rescuing his comrades and uncovering their fate.

Henry was not surprised to see Braxton Wyatt, as such a chance was sure to draw him. The war seemed to be moving towards the northeast, bringing many stormy petrels. Henry watched as Wyatt walked towards a fire and sat down with the warriors, seemingly on good terms. Soon, Blackstaffe and Quarles joined them. Henry believed the Iroquois and Wyandots would form a fortified camp for sudden attacks on settlements. He saw them cutting saplings for lodges and a palisade. Realizing the danger, he slipped away into the forest, returning to his shelter on the islet. Content with his day's work, he planned to invade the Indian camp, a perilous task he was determined to accomplish. As he rested, a gentle wind reassured him, whispering courage and hope.|['1.

Henry listened as the wind rustled the leaves around him. A feeling of triumph filled him, a sense of connection to nature and the world around him. Suddenly, a black bear emerged from the bushes, drawn by instinct to the islet where Henry sat. Despite needing food, Henry couldn't bring himself to harm the bear.

There was a sudden change in the light breeze, carrying a strange scent that made the black bear uneasy. It was a new smell, filled with fear, alerting the bear to danger. Henry, understanding the bear's instinctual fear, retreated to his hut for the night. The next morning, he ventured towards the Indian camp, but the woods were teeming with hunters. Realizing the risk, he decided to return to the safety of his islet. However, he heard distant cries, signaling that the warriors had discovered his trail.

The event continued as the young forest runner encountered a stray warrior in the darkness near the swamp. A sudden confrontation ensued, leading to a fierce struggle. Henry, determined to defend himself, grappled with the warrior, each exerting immense strength.

He concealed the Indian's weapons and his own raccoon-skin cap in the bushes. Then, he respectfully buried the fallen warrior at the swamp's edge. His intent was not just to hide but also to honor the Wyandot. As the body sank from view, he headed towards the vast Indian camp. Pausing at a moonlit pool, he glimpsed his Indian reflection. Despite doubts, he pressed on, ready for the risks ahead. Approaching the camp cautiously, he was astonished by its expansion and the increased presence of warriors, women, and children. Amidst the bustling village, he planned to pass as a Shawnee warrior to avoid suspicion, especially from Timmendiquas.

The leaders emerged from the Council House, also known as the Long House. The Onondaga chiefs, including Atotarho, Skanawati, Tehatkahtons, Tehayatkwarayen, and Hahiron, took the lead due to their historical significance in the Six Nations. Following them were the Mohawks, represented by Koswensiroutha and Satekariwate, known as the Keepers of the Eastern Gate. The Onondagas, Mohawks, and Senecas were considered the senior nations, with the Oneidas, Cayugas, and Tuscaroras following in order. Each chief had assistants, often relatives, who could succeed them. The ceremony continued with a fire kindled by young warriors in a glen called Deyuhnyon Kwarakda, where the chiefs gathered to speak in low tones.

Timmendiquas, the White Lightning, was moved by the ancestral call to defend against the encroaching Americans. The solemn ritual continued with mourning rites symbolized by draped skins.

Three of the huts revealed their occupants after their bonds were loosened, but the fourth hut was mysteriously empty. The one who spoke slowly and the most dangerous one were missing. Henry and Sol had taken the severed thongs with them, leaving no trace of the vanished prisoner except for the cut withes on the door.

She had deerskin leggings, moccasins with heads, a red European cloth dress, a red shawl, and bright feathers in her long black hair. She held a large sharp tomahawk, swinging it fiercely to her song. Her face had a rapt, terrible expression, showing a fiery and powerful demeanor. Henry and Shif'less Sol shuddered, feeling fear like never before. The woman was Catharine Montour, known as ""Queen Esther,"" a chieftainess of the Iroquois. A dozen warriors followed her, acknowledging her as their leader. Queen Esther, once treated as a white woman, had turned savage, married a chief, and had children. She entered the camp, greeted by Thayendanegea, showing her influence among the Iroquois. Henry and Shif'less Sol, filled with curiosity, followed to witness her entry. Queen Esther commanded attention, her presence dimming the lights in the village.

In Pittsburgh, a powerful woman was rumored to have control over the Iroquois, believed to cast spells. Two nights later, Henry and Tom observed the arrival of white men in green uniforms, Sir John Johnson's Royal Greens, led by the infamous John Butler, known for his savage and cruel nature. They witnessed an extraordinary council with prominent chiefs like Timmendiquas and Thayendanegea, preparing for a major campaign. The Iroquois dismantled their village, except for a few structures, signaling their march. Henry and his comrades shadowed the Indian army, observing their movements closely. They saw reinforcements join, including Senecas and Tories, as the army camped at Tioga before descending upon the Wyoming Valley.

The alarm quickly spread among the settlers, causing panic as they rushed towards Forty Fort on the western side of the river. Henry and his companions arrived at the fort at dusk, summoned to meet Colonel Zebulon Butler, the military leader. Despite their rugged appearance, the five hunters showed no signs of subservience. Suspicious glances were exchanged by the officers present, questioning the newcomers from Kentucky. Henry, sensing the doubt, explained their journey from New Orleans to Pittsburgh, where they learned of a significant war movement. Having been captives of the Iroquois, they shared valuable insights about the Wyandot chief Timmendiquas and Thayendanegea.

The group of five friends sensed a clear shift in the air. No longer were they just ordinary folks; now they were relied upon as scouts and fighters. As they huddled together in the dimly lit room, each took a turn to speak, describing the dangers they had witnessed in the forest. The listeners, Wyoming men, were visibly shaken by the harrowing tales. Colonel Butler acknowledged the gravity of the situation, urging the five to assist with scouting and protecting the fort. The friends pledged their unwavering support, having already come prepared for this purpose. Stepping outside into the darkness, they found refugees seeking safety at Forty Fort, fleeing from the horrors of the Indian attacks. Throughout the night, the five helped ferry families across the river, ensuring their safety with vigilant watchfulness.

In the dark of night, Tom Ross and Long Jim rowed their boat along the river, wary of lurking dangers. Henry, alert at the prow, signaled the rowers to stop as they heard voices. Peeking through the bushes, Henry saw Braxton Wyatt and seven warriors planning an attack on a nearby farmhouse where a family resided. Determined to save them, Henry shared the plan with his comrades. Shif'less Sol recognized the family and regretted not convincing them to flee earlier. Now, united in their mission to protect the innocent, Henry and his friends set out to thwart the impending raid.

Henry and his companion swiftly guided the boat downstream until they reached a spot pointed out by Sol. They quickly landed, pulled the boat to shore, and hurried towards a log cabin nestled among trees. As they neared the house, a barking dog approached, only to be subdued by a swift blow from Henry's companion. Inside the cabin, Standish hesitated, torn between opening the door to potential danger or staying put. Henry urgently urged Standish to flee with his family to safety, warning of an imminent attack by renegades and Indians. Convinced by their sincerity and the cries of his family, Standish finally relented. With haste, they all embarked on the boat, rowing towards safety at Forty Fort. Meanwhile, Henry and his companions returned to the cabin, securing it against any impending threat, their eyes vigilant in the dim light of dawn.|"['1.

He was not cruel, he never enjoyed violence, but only the borderer truly understood the suffering of the border. The Standish house had new occupants, as a sudden change took place. The careless one cleared the ashes and kindled a fire. Henry observed the cabin, typical of the frontier but larger. The children's beds were behind a curtain, and dried herbs hung over the fireplace. Clothing lay scattered, unfinished breakfast on the table. Signs of a rushed departure were evident. Henry, resolved, hardened his heart, cutting a door bar hook. The group, silent, grasped his intentions. As dawn approached, they waited, rifles ready, facing the door.

Ten quiet minutes passed, and Henry approached the window once more. He didn't open it, but a small gap allowed him to peer through. The group remained silent, observing his expression. When he turned away, they understood the moment was near. Suddenly, a loud knock sounded at the door, but no response came from inside. The knock grew more insistent, and Henry, altering his voice, called out as if startled awake. Wyatt demanded the door be opened, threatening to break it down. Henry and the others remained still. After a brief pause, they heard light footsteps outside. Henry went to the door, listened, and returned. As tension mounted, the door burst open, revealing Iroquois warriors. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in the warriors' defeat. The group, unmoved, watched as the fallen warriors' tomahawks glinted in the firelight.|"['1.

They left the house and headed to the riverbank. As daylight flooded the area, they reached Forty Fort where they met Standish and his family. Henry briefly answered the man's questions, but soon a scout arrived with grim news from the Standish home. Despite needing rest, they set out again before noon, encountering more refugees. It became too risky to proceed up the valley, so they climbed the mountains for a view of the enemy. The day was brilliant, with clear blue skies and lush green hills. From a high point, they spotted boats on the river. The group observed the enemy forces approaching, outnumbering them greatly. Despite the odds, they decided to fight to protect the valley.

At three o'clock, the fort's gates opened, and a small army of only three hundred, including seventy old men and young boys, marched out to face the fierce Iroquois warriors and white rovers. Despite their small numbers, the army displayed courage and unity. A banner waved, and a boy drummed a steady beat. Henry and his comrades stood on the left flank, with the river on their right. The women and children remained safely within the fort. As they advanced, the older officers, initially against fighting, led the way. The army moved forward cautiously, keeping the river to their right and extending left onto the plain. Henry and four others scouted ahead, approaching a swamp and highland. Suddenly, they heard the chilling chant of Queen Esther, rousing the enemy for battle. They spotted her with chiefs and warriors, including the ruthless Senecas, ready for combat.

As the five saw the devastating scene unfold, they retreated deeper into the forest. Despite being unharmed, their faces paled with shock. The Indians, fueled by triumph and bloodlust, scalped the dead, killed some wounded, and prepared others for unspeakable tortures. Even their white allies joined in the merciless onslaught.

Paul and Shif'less Sol were hunting when they were ambushed by a strong force, making them prisoners. Braxton Wyatt, a cruel man, threatened them. Shif'less Sol bravely faced him, comparing him to a mean dog. Wyatt tried to hit Sol, but a tall figure intervened, preventing the violence. It was Timmendiquas, a respected warrior. Despite being wounded, Timmendiquas commanded respect and halted the aggression. Paul and Sol were taken to the battlefield, joining other captives in a grim scene of suffering. The setting sun cast an eerie light on the chaos around them, with burning houses and distant cries. The captives endured their plight, surrounded by enemies reveling in their pain.|"[""1.

As the sun dipped behind the mountains, darkness fell over the land. Fires lit up in the distance, some with sinister intentions. The victorious Iroquois, painted in bold colors and brandishing weapons, engaged in a fierce dance captured in Paul Cotter's memory. Chanting war songs, they were joined by equally savage white men. The scene horrified Paul, tied up and unable to look away. Queen Esther, a figure of great ferocity, led the dance to an even darker place. Shif'less Sol, a stalwart man, was also shaken by the cries of burning prisoners. The horror of the night's events was too much for Paul, who sensed a grim fate awaiting them. As they were led by their captors, the sounds of the night haunted them, leaving an indelible mark on their souls.|"['1.

"""Quiet!"" shouted Braxton Wyatt. The two had spoken enough, their senses dulled from their experiences. The path was dark, lit only by distant torches and fires. They recognized the chilling chant of the hyena woman, knowing they were being brought to her, uncertain of her intentions but expecting the worst. As they neared, the woman's frenzied chant intensified, sending shivers down Paul's spine. ""Move!"" ordered Braxton Wyatt as the Senecas pushed them forward towards Queen Esther. She stood on a rock, performing a ghastly dance with a war hatchet in hand. In front of her lay twenty bound Americans. The scene was terrifying, with Iroquois and their allies surrounding them. The woman continued her chant, gesturing for the warriors to bring forward a prisoner. The tomahawk struck, and the gruesome ritual continued. Paul and Shif'less Sol struggled against their bonds, witnessing the horror unfold before them. Braxton Wyatt's laughter echoed, revealing his true nature. The savage queen's bloodlust was insatiable, claiming victim after victim. Paul could only listen in horror as the massacre continued, until a stern voice interrupted."|"['1.

"The woman fixed her fierce look on the young chief. ""Timmendiquas,"" she declared, ""we are the Iroquois, and we are in charge. You are a visitor in our homes, far from your own land, and you cannot dictate to the victors how to use their triumph. Step aside!"" A loud laugh erupted from the Iroquois. The fierce old chiefs, Hiokatoo and Sangerachte, along with a dozen warriors, shielded Timmendiquas. The woman resumed her chant, and a hundred voices joined her in song. She signaled again. The ninth victim fell, followed by the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and so on, with sixteen bound men meeting their end in under fifteen minutes. Amidst the chaos of fleeing prisoners and pursuing Indians, two men, Joseph Elliott and Lebbeus Hammond, managed to escape thanks to a mysterious figure who freed them from their bonds.

"Their escape took them on a slanted path towards the mountains. Just once did the chasers make noise. Paul stumbled over a root, and a victorious shout came from the Mohawks. However, it only fueled him further. He regained his footing swiftly and sprinted faster. Yet, it was incredibly strenuous. He could hear Shif'less Sol's heavy breathing beside him, mirroring his own. The terrain grew rougher as they ascended slightly. The glow of the Indian campfires faded behind them, and a dense thicket loomed ahead. A movement in the thicket caught Shif'less Sol's eye, revealing a figure. Dread filled him; the Indians were in front of them. Fearful of capture and facing the tomahawk, a Mohawk fell behind them. The remaining two hesitated and then fled as another shot rang out, downing another Mohawk. After a brief rest, Paul and Shif'less Sol angled away for safety. Armed with pistols, they hid in the thicket, watching the distant Indian camps. The warriors they thwarted did not return, but distant cries hinted at lurking dangers.

"""Yes, we will help,"" Shif'less Sol agreed, but he expressed doubt about the Wyoming fort's ability to withstand the impending attack. With fewer than a hundred able men inside and over a thousand enemies outside, the situation looked grim. The group, hidden in the bushes, regained strength before attempting to reach the fort and its cabins protected by palisades. Paul, weakened by shock, and Shif'less Sol, fully recovered, prepared for the journey. As they approached the fort from the west, they witnessed the enemy's destructive triumph.

Some women stayed awake the whole night, enduring unimaginable hardships on the American frontier. They witnessed the loss of their loved ones in battles and suffered the horrors of Indian camps.

Henry and Paul, facing danger on the frontier, felt a burning desire for vengeance. They knew they couldn't leave until justice was served.

Henry agreed to call off the marksmen's turns. Shif'less Sol fired first, and the sounds ceased. The Iroquois sensed danger, not unarmed women and children.

Henry aimed his gun at Braxton Wyatt, but before he could shoot, Wyatt dodged behind a bush, and a Seneca warrior took the bullet instead. Henry spotted Blackstaffe, but couldn't get a clear shot.

Henry confidently approached the swamp's edge, where the young chief met him. Henry extended his hand in peace, and the chief accepted it. Hidden eyes in the swamp watched with hatred. The chief, Timmendiquas, spoke with dignity, explaining that he didn't lead the attack on women and children. He and his Wyandot warriors were ready for battle but not to harm the innocent. Timmendiquas revealed that others of Henry's race had caused the bloodshed. He assured Henry that they would cease pursuing them and return to their valley. Henry and his companions trusted the chief's word and followed the fugitives' trail, confident in their safety.

A fresh grave, just made, hid a woman under bushes. They passed quietly, grateful for Timmendiquas's mercy. He knew the five and Carpenter couldn't fend off the chief with his Wyandots and Iroquois. In an hour, they saw Carpenter, vigilant with his rifle. He counted the approaching figures—relief washed over him. He led on, whispering, “We beat them back; Timmendiquas won't pursue.” News spread, lifting spirits. After more loss in the swamp, they reached Fort Penn, greeted with food and shelter. That night, the Iroquois celebrated their victory at Wyoming. Chiefs, white men, and warriors danced around a great fire, chanting victory songs. The red and black-painted warriors circled the fire, tomahawks raised, chanting the League's praises. The scene was eerie, faces distorted by firelight, celebrating their triumph.|"['1.

The warriors leaped higher and higher, consumed by an intense frenzy. Sweat glistened on their faces and bodies, painted in red and black. As they danced, a chilling scalp yell pierced the night, led by a formidable woman named Catharine Montour. She proudly displayed scalps taken from their enemies. The eerie chant echoed through the forest as more warriors joined in. Prisoners, bound and marked for death, were paraded before the revelers. The night wore on with relentless dancing and singing under the watchful stars. Exhausted, the dancers eventually collapsed, marking the end of the Festival of Thanksgiving. The scene closed with a ritual involving a white dog, roasted and shared among the chiefs.

While at Fort Penn, two exhausted parties arrived, having faced death along the way. Other groups made it to the Moravian towns, welcomed kindly by German settlers. The five helped some parties, but the once beautiful Wyoming Valley lay in ruins. Savages and enemies had mercilessly destroyed everything, leaving the valley desolate. The invaders, led by ruthless figures like Butler and Queen Esther, moved triumphantly northward, laden with spoils and scalps. The woodsmen, including Henry, Paul, Sol, Tom, and Jim, watched from afar, keen on avenging the cruelty. As they followed the enemy's canoes, they spotted Braxton Wyatt and Walter Butler, plotting mischief. Despite the destruction, the woodsmen were resolute in their pursuit of justice.|"['1.

During a hot period in America, a group of five boys took refuge in an old outhouse on a cool, rainy night. They were well-prepared with two light blankets each, one beneath their bodies for warmth. After a successful deer hunt, they feasted and felt comfort and rest they hadn't known in days. Henry, feeling safe for the first time since a dangerous mission, found solace in the rain's rhythmic patter on the roof. As darkness enveloped them, the wind and rain created a melodious symphony. Henry's mind drifted, envisioning past battles and future hopes. The boys sensed danger as wolves howled nearby, each gripping a rifle, ready to defend against the eerie cries.

In the dark, the group heard light footsteps and saw gleaming eyes approaching. At least thirty hungry wolves circled, eyeing the five silent figures near the unburned house. Caution was instinctive as the wolves cautiously approached the human shapes. Suddenly, the figures raised long tubes and flames shot out, felling five of the boldest wolves. The next morning, under a golden sky, they cooked venison and savored rare coffee. They journeyed through the valley, now reclaimed by nature, witnessing the aftermath of the tragic conflict. Determined to aid the American army against the Iroquois, they scouted the wilderness, knowing the importance of intelligence in the face of ambush. The hunters understood the peril settlers faced in Indian conflicts and vowed to prevent future tragedies. Their keen eyes would serve as invaluable assets in the coming campaign.|['1.

They left the valley behind and ventured into the dense woods. The trail revealed that a large group of Native Americans had split into smaller parties after disembarking, each laden with plunder heading back to their village. Silent Tom Ross noticed tracks near a creek bank: about eight Indians, along with what seemed to be a white woman and several children, likely captives. Tom, deeply moved, shared this with his companions - Shif'less Sol, Paul, and Long Jim - who agreed to follow the trail. They found traces of a child's shoe and cloth shreds, evidence of the captives' passage. The trail led towards the Seneca territory, and the group grew anxious as they neared the camp where the captives had rested.

In the hilly forest, five cautious travelers came upon a camp of resting warriors at sunset. Among the group was a worn woman and her four children, weary and hopeless. The travelers, Paul and Henry, knew they had to act with care. The warriors seemed at ease, their guard down. They ate, talked, and displayed their gruesome trophies.

After waiting for three hours in the dark night with only a faint moon shining, the group cautiously descended into the valley towards the Indian camp. It took them almost an hour to reach a point where they could see the campfire's dying embers and the silhouettes of the sleeping figures around it. The Indians, feeling secure, had not posted any guards and were all asleep. Aware that any sudden noise would awaken them, the group huddled in the bushes for a whispered discussion. Henry, armed with his rifle, bravely decided to infiltrate the camp alone. He moved like a serpent, inching closer to the woman tied up nearby.

The lady shifted slightly and glanced toward the noise's origin. It could have been a rattlesnake's hiss, but she felt no fear, too exhausted to be alarmed. Seeing a shadow approaching, she recognized it as a man, not an Indian. A voice, comforting and unfamiliar, assured her of rescue. The woman, Mary Newton, felt a surge of hope and strength as the stranger cut her bonds. She believed a supernatural force had intervened.

In the forest, the frontiersmen heard a victorious cry and quickly rushed to the camp. Two Senecas charged at the woman and children with tomahawks, but Mary Newton bravely defended them. She shot the warriors with her pistol, forcing them to flee. Henry and the others also fought back, causing the Senecas to retreat. Mary collapsed from exhaustion after the battle, but the group was safe. They decided to head towards a river where a hidden boat awaited, planning to escape down the river to the Susquehanna.

The man shouted angrily at Braxton Wyatt and Walter Butler for dropping back in the race. He accused them of being cowards and murderers.

Mary Newton and her children were on a boat, feeling safe with their friends Paul and Sol. Mary had great faith in their skills and success. Despite the sound of shots, she remained peaceful, believing everything would turn out well with such friends by her side. Paul and Sol took over rowing from Long Jim and Tom, keeping the boat moving away from the pursuing Iroquois. As the sky darkened, a storm approached, forcing them to seek shelter on the eastern shore. They eventually reached a fort where they were warmly welcomed.

"The Iroquois, the Butlers, the Johnsons, and Braxton Wyatt were all furious. This flaw in their victory started affecting their allies' superstitions. Braxton Wyatt suspected the raiders' identity but stayed silent. Timmendiquas likely knew too but didn't speak up. The raiders' influence grew, with their extraordinary deeds becoming exaggerated by superstition. Their acts were heard of far and wide, from the Susquehanna to Oneida Lake. In late September, a significant event unfolded when a group of Tories from the Wyoming incident was attacked near Otsego Lake. Only two survived, leading to revenge-seeking war parties.

I've thought more than once about that old town, Troy, that Paul tells us about, and I've about made up my mind that it wasn't destroyed because Helen ate too many golden apples, but because old King Prime, or whoever built the place, put it down in a plain. That was surely a powerful foolish thing. Now, if he had built it on a mountain, with a steep fall-off on every side, there wouldn't have been enough Greeks in all the earth to take it, considering the miserable weapons they used in those times.

In late summer, as the leaves turned to autumn hues, the five avoided Indian war parties while on a mission. They joined Colonel William Butler's force to avenge the Wyoming attack. The little army, with only 250 strong and brave men, marched toward Oghwaga, an important Iroquois village. The five, ahead of the column, approached cautiously at night. The autumn air filled them with energy as they crept closer to the village. They encountered a fierce dog, but Henry subdued it without raising an alarm.

The dog jerked uncontrollably, then hung lifeless. Henry discarded the carcass, grabbed his rifle, and all five of them sank quietly among the grapevines. An Indian warrior cautiously approached, investigating the dog's snarl. The five hearts beat faster as he prowled nearby, but he soon moved on. Unseen by the Indian, they peeked out and spotted Timmendiquas, a prominent Wyandot chief, pacing thoughtfully. Another chief, Thayendanegea, joined him, followed by three white figures. They all entered a wooden house after a brief discussion. The scouts hurried back through the wilderness to inform Captain Gray of their findings. The group, led by Henry, met the colonial force at dawn, sharing news of the enemy's movements.

As the evening grew colder and twilight enveloped the sky, the autumn leaves danced in the wind. The group, now seven in number, neared Oghwaga once more. Cornelius Heemskerk surveyed the Iroquois village meticulously, while Colonel Butler and William Gray led the troops forward cautiously. At nine o'clock, the colonial force approached Oghwaga stealthily, but found the village deserted. The Iroquois had fled upon receiving warning of the white men's advance. The soldiers entered the empty village, witnessing the abandoned houses and belongings left behind. Henry felt a mix of emotions, understanding the retaliation for the atrocities at Wyoming but also lamenting the destruction of the ancient town.

Colonel John Butler asked bitterly, “Where is your great king now, Joe Brant?

The Native American and British leaders quietly marched north. Henry and his friends laid down near the forest's edge after a long night. They rested on the outskirts, away from the smoldering coals and charred wood. Henry, wary of ambush, asked William Gray to keep watch. He knew the recklessness of their group could lead to losses. As the fire dwindled and the air turned chilly, Henry struggled to sleep. He dreamt of spiraling smoke and sensed an Indian spirit. Upon waking, the group prepared to march on Cunahunta, led by skilled scouts. The vanguard spotted an ambush across the creek, likely set by Iroquois and Tories.

Henry and Heemskerk led a group of skilled veterans on a mission to outwit the Iroquois. The team split into two groups, with four men staying behind to distract the enemy with sharpshooting. The remaining ten executed a strategic plan to flank the ambushing party. As the group crossed the creek and approached the Iroquois, they engaged in a forest battle. Despite being outnumbered, the frontiersmen's superior marksmanship and knowledge of the terrain allowed them to gain the upper hand. Braxton Wyatt, seeking revenge, urged the Seneca chief Hiokatoo to encircle the frontiersmen. Hiokatoo, a formidable warrior, led the fierce Iroquois in battle. Wyatt, recognizing the chief's merciless determination, realized the grave threat they faced.

Hiokatoo devised a plan with twenty warriors, mainly Senecas and Cayugas, to carry it out immediately. Henry, with four men from across the creek, anticipated the move and positioned his group to counter it. Shif'less Sol and Heemskerk noticed figures sneaking away, prompting Henry to prepare for an attack. The flanking force charged, but the white riflemen's rapid and accurate shots pushed them back. In a close encounter, Taylor faced a ruthless Tory from Wyoming. Despite having a loaded rifle, Taylor used the stock to defeat his enemy. The skirmish continued, with the Iroquois facing heavy losses. The winter's approach led to a pause in the campaign, disappointing Henry and his allies, who had hoped for a more extensive mission.

Henry's knowledge was vague, but he noticed tracks earlier than expected.

Alone in the wintry forest, he moved swiftly on his snowshoes, resembling a skilled skater. Standing tall on a hill, dressed in deerskin, he spotted a distant campfire, likely belonging to his foes.

Henry moved away from the window and found a sheltered spot near the wooden wall. He placed pine dust on the snow, covered it with pine splinters, and added larger pieces of pine on top. He repeated this process against the second house. The most delicate part of his task was next, requiring luck to succeed. Despite his anger, he continued, steady in hand and eye.

One of the Native Americans, a fast Mohawk, had come dangerously close—close enough to shoot a bullet that barely missed the fleeing man. This infuriated Henry. He saw it as an insult more than a threat and decided to retaliate. Although he was at a disadvantage in shooting, needing to stop and turn around while the Mohawk could shoot without slowing down, Henry took the risk. He swiftly turned, shot at the Mohawk, saw him fall, then turned back and continued running. Despite losing ground, he earned respect. Henry pushed himself to his limits, trying to distance himself from his pursuers. He leaped over the snow, gaining ground, but the strenuous flight took a toll.

He lay still for hours, his ankle barely bothering him when he didn't move. The sun shone brightly but without warmth. The lake's icy surface stretched endlessly. He saw the steep hill he slid down, now white and towering across the lake. Grateful for his escape, he glanced at his swollen ankle. Around noon, he piled up snow like an Eskimo's house and covered himself with a blanket. Despite hunger, he tried to ignore it. Hunger grew stronger, and he imagined feasting on various meats. Desperate, he hoped to shoot a wild animal. As night fell, he slept, and a little snow fell, hiding his trail.

He felt feverish, his lips dry, back stiff, and shoulders tense. Despite the discomfort, he tightened his belt and checked his ankle. The swelling had lessened, allowing a bit more movement, but walking was still out of reach. Contemplating his situation, he realized hunger might overcome him before he could hunt or reach safety. Frustration grew as he grappled with his predicament, feeling weakened by the ankle injury. Determined to push forward, he attempted to stand, but excruciating pain forced him back into the shelter. The day passed with him tending to the fire for comfort rather than warmth. Watching the snow-covered landscape, he longed for a chance at prey but lacked the means to fish.

Henry, the forest runner, ventured out from his shelter under the cliff, rifle in hand, eager to hunt. The snow-covered wilderness seemed barren, but Henry knew better.

Henry and his comrades, unharmed, reloaded and unleashed a deadly barrage on their foes, forcing them to retreat further. The enemy, overwhelmed, began to flee, marking a significant victory.|"['1.

The American army fiercely attacked the Indian camp, forcing them into a frantic retreat. The battle was chaotic, with the sound of rifles mixing with war cries. Smoke filled the air as the victorious army pursued the Iroquois along the Chemung River. The Iroquois, facing a ford, plunged into the water, shedding their weapons in a desperate attempt to escape. Braxton Wyatt and his men tried to halt the pursuit, but the riflemen pushed forward. Despite Wyatt's efforts, the Iroquois were overwhelmed, their attempts at resistance futile. The pursuit continued deep into the forest, with the scouts leading the charge, wary of ambushes. After hours of intense action, the army regrouped, victorious but prepared for the next day's march.|"['1.

Henry, Paul, Tom, Jim, and Shif'less Sol retraced their steps over the battlefield, where fallen soldiers still rested. Dusk approached, casting a solemn atmosphere over the scene. The earthworks, shrubs, and trees bore the scars of cannon fire. Tory tents lay in ruins, and dark stains marked the ground. The army had moved on, leaving a silent and desolate battlefield. Twilight turned to night, and eerie sounds echoed from the forest. Wolves, drawn by the scent of battle, communicated with haunting howls. As fiery eyes glinted in the thickets, the men acknowledged the victory but felt no joy in the defeat of their foes. Returning to camp, they heard the wolves' cries grow louder. The next morning, the army, invigorated and determined, set out to dismantle the power of the Six Nations, sparing civilians but destroying enemy strongholds.|"['1.

Thayendanegea's words before the Battle of the Chemung proved true as the Iroquois faced defeat despite promises of victory. The British and Tories' assurances failed them, and now they were fugitives in their own land. The army pressed on, well-protected against ambushes by scouts and riflemen. Despite lurking Indian bands, the army's progress was relentless. As night fell, the scouts approached Kanawaholla, finding it deserted except for a few fleeing figures. The town was abandoned, left to the mercy of the army, and soon it was set ablaze along with its fields. The army continued its destructive path, laying waste to more Iroquois towns, leaving behind smoking ruins and fleeing inhabitants. The once powerful Iroquois now sought aid in vain as their lands burned.|"['1.

In late autumn, as the nights turned cold and the forests blazed with colors, Henry and his comrades were in the midst of the action. They marched into the Genesee Valley, witnessing the destruction of Indian villages. Despite the sadness it brought, they knew it was necessary. Henry, a young leader, commanded a group of scouts who advanced ahead of the army. They aimed to reach the Seneca village, where notorious figures like Thayendanegea and Braxton Wyatt were rumored to be. The riflemen set out on a crisp morning, surrounded by the beauty of the land, yet feeling the desolation brought by the ongoing conflict. As they journeyed through the misty Indian summer, they were reminded of distant homes and pondered the possibility of returning one day.|"[""1.

That evening, the group set up camp in a thick forest, not far from the Seneca Castle. Henry believed the Senecas still occupied the castle and might join forces with other tribes to defend it. Knowing the Senecas likely had sharpshooters and sentinels, the group refrained from lighting fires, braving the cold night wrapped in blankets. As darkness enveloped them, Shif'less Sol expressed his desire to confront Braxton Wyatt for his cruel actions. Henry, planning a night mission, ensured the group rested. Dutchman Heemskerk guarded the camp, silently patrolling to protect the sleeping Kentuckians. Heemskerk's faith and vigilance kept them safe through the night, listening to the natural sounds of the forest. The next day, they cautiously approached the Seneca Castle, observing signs of occupation and preparing for their mission ahead.|"['1.

When the night enveloped them in complete darkness, the trio emerged from their hiding spot. They ventured a short way through the forest before veering towards the river. Henry hoped to spot signs of Native American activity along the water, which could lead to valuable discoveries. However, the river appeared desolate upon their arrival. Not a single canoe glided across its surface. Undeterred, they cautiously followed the riverbank towards the town. Their path transitioned from forest to a vast field where the Senecas had cultivated corn, tended to by the women of the tribe. Beyond the field, fruit trees and wisps of smoke marking the Seneca Castle's location came into view. As they stealthily traversed the field, they discerned the mournful rustle of dry cornstalks in the wind. Suddenly, they halted in unison, alerted by the sound of paddles slicing through the water. Peering through the foliage, they witnessed a peculiar sight. A line of Iroquois canoes floated up the river, each carrying a motionless figure - the body of a fallen chief. The lead canoe, however, held a striking woman, her sorrow and anger palpable. Despite her anguish, the scouts harbored no sympathy, haunted by past atrocities. As the canoes approached the shore, a group of warriors awaited them, led by the Seneca chief, Little Beard. Engrossed in the impending ritual, the Iroquois remained oblivious to the|['1.

As the canoes reached the shore, Catharine Montour, a once-beautiful woman of mixed heritage, let out a mournful cry that echoed through the dark forest. Standing tall and strong, she grieved for fallen chiefs, singing a lament that spoke of the League of the Ho-de-no-sau-nee. The procession of bodies moved towards the town, followed by the onlookers. Among them were white men, including Tories, who showed no signs of preparing for defense. Squaws fled in despair, carrying heavy loads. Henry and his companions cautiously navigated through the town, exchanging brief words with the Tories they encountered. Their ultimate goal was to find Braxton Wyatt, a renegade they sought to confront.|"[""1.

Henry and his friends found themselves in a tight spot, surrounded by enemies. Acting on instinct, Henry landed a solid punch on Wyatt, knocking him down. Shif'less Sol and Tom Ross quickly took down Coleman and dashed away, knowing their survival depended on speed and cunning. A group of men, led by a traitor, scoured the area, but confusion reigned as they mistook others for the scouts. The trio, skilled in evading capture, outsmarted their pursuers by hiding in a dark Council House. Concealed behind mats, they listened to the commotion outside. Sol couldn't help but chuckle at their advantageous position, safe inside the enemy's own sanctuary. As they sat quietly, they could hear the chaos of the search party outside.|"['1.

Shif'less Sol chuckled softly, and Henry couldn't help but smile in the dark. Shif'less Sol was partly right. It would be tough on Braxton Wyatt. Yet, where they sat was pleasant. The hard floor felt soft, and leaning against the wall allowed them to relax. Outside, the hunt noises continued. War cries echoed, mingling with the shrill sounds of women and children, and the thud of many feet. Gradually, the commotion lessened, hinting at an imminent abandonment of the town. Henry contemplated facing Braxton Wyatt, even though the army might not catch up with his band. Suddenly, the door of the Council House creaked open and shut, and footsteps approached. Shif'less Sol and Tom Ross peered under the mats, recognizing the two figures instantly. Timmendiquas and Thayendanegea stood side by side, gazing out the window at Seneca Castle. Thayendanegea spoke first in Wyandot, bidding farewell to the Wyandot chief, acknowledging their shared battles and the impending American threat. The White Lightning and Joseph Brant of the Mohawks lamented their defeats and the impending loss of their lands.

As thoughts weighed heavily, a sense of foreboding settled upon him, realizing the impending doom of their cause. With a heavy heart, he left the council house, followed by the others.

Henry heard the whistle and recognized it as Wyatt's. Glancing back, he saw Wyatt and his men pursuing. Shots were fired, but the three managed to stay out of harm's way. Leading them through the cornfield, Henry guided them towards the riflemen's camp. As they approached, Henry fired his rifle and let out a loud forest runner's shout, joined by his companions.
