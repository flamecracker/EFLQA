At Plum Beach, there's a sandbar outside the cove that has grown, creating another beach with real surf. This means we can enjoy different types of bathing experiences. One day we can relax on the calm beach, and the next we can ride the waves. The idea of having both options excites me. Reading books used to get me in trouble with Maw Hoover. She thought I was loafing and always found more chores for me. But books are so much fun! You should try reading the right kind of books, Dolly. When we return to the city, let's read good books together. Plum Beach is not your typical seaside spot with hotels and boardwalks. It's wild and beautiful, just ten miles from Bay City.

"Bessie and Dolly found themselves in a tricky situation, trapped with no easy way out. They contemplated sneaking past the guards to reach safety but feared alerting them to their knowledge of the situation.

Eleanor Mercer, relieved to see them, praised their cautious approach. The girls discussed the mysterious ""boss"" they had overheard and speculated about Mr. Holmes's arrival.

Eleanor and Dolly were discussing the safety of their campsite. Eleanor believed they were safe until Mr. Holmes returned, but Dolly feared the dangerous men lurking around. As night fell, the campfire flickered on the beach while the yacht remained peaceful. Despite Eleanor's attempt to reassure everyone, she was also uneasy. They decided to set a guard for the night, with Margery and Mary King taking the first watch. Suddenly, a fire broke out in the big tent, causing chaos. The girls sprang into action, forming a line to pass water to douse the flames. The men from the yacht rushed to help, but their presence added to the confusion. Amidst the chaos, Bessie witnessed Zara being abducted, and before she could react, she too was taken aboard the yacht. They found themselves unexpectedly captured.|"[""1.

"""Stay still,"" ordered the man firmly as he held them captive. Bessie was silenced by his hand covering her mouth, rendering her unable to cry out. Glancing at Zara, she noticed her unconscious state, intensifying her own peril as the man focused solely on her. Helpless and on the verge of despair, Bessie was carried up the small ladder to the yacht's deck. Blindfolded, she heard muffled voices, hoping one was Mr. Holmes, her adversary. Her only solace was the possibility of Dolly or others witnessing their capture. However, she doubted their ability to intervene. Taken below deck, the blindfold removed, Bessie found herself in a luxurious cabin, longing to return to her friends on the beach. Zara, still unconscious, was placed on a sofa.

""I shall not go ashore until I have found my girls,"" said Eleanor. There were tears of baffled anger in her voice, and Bessie thrilled with indignant sympathy at the idea that she was within a few feet of her best friend without being able to let her know that she was there. 

""Then you'll be put ashore--gently, but firmly, as the books say,"" said Jeff. ""You're dead right, ma'am, kidnapping is a bad sort of business in this state, and I don't aim to give you a chance to say we carried you off with us against your will. Sail we will--and you'll stay behind. This is my boat, and I've got a right to put off anyone that is trespassing.""
