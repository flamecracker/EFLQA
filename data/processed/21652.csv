"""But it ain't Californy,"" he interrupted once more; ""it's the Klondike country. No use of talking,"" he added with enthusiasm, ""there's richer deposits in Alaska and that part of the world than was ever found hereabouts.

The husband and wife looked at each other in surprise. They had not imagined anything like this; but if the truth were told, Mr. Palmer had been so excited by the amazing stories that were constantly coming from Alaska and British Columbia, that he was seriously thinking of joining the northward-bound procession.

Startling as was the announcement of Jeff Graham, a discussion of the scheme brought out more than one fact to recommend it. The youths were in perfect health, strong and athletic.

The elderly miner, seated at the Palmer home, discussed traveling light with the group. He suggested using sturdy carpet bags instead of trunks to avoid losing items. Each person was advised to pack essentials like thread, buttons, and patches for clothes. Toothbrushes, soap, and combs were deemed unnecessary. The miner emphasized the importance of practical items like quinine and pain-killer, while luxury items like violins and dress suits were discouraged.

When the task was finished, everyone praised Jeff Graham's excellent judgment. The three boys were dressed in thick, warm clothing, each carrying a heavy overcoat. Packed in their bags were underclothes, shirts, and handkerchiefs. The mothers expertly packed every nook and cranny, fitting in extra supplies like medicine and soap. The next day, the boys bid tearful goodbyes and set off for Seattle, then Juneau in 1897. On the journey, they made acquaintances and speculated about success in the gold regions. They met three lumbermen from Maine, all named Brown, who entertained with songs and violin tunes. The boys observed diverse passengers, including a San Francisco policeman, a New York newspaper correspondent, and a hopeful but ill man. They marveled at the motley crew on the ship, a mix of hope, ambition, and daring. Arriving in Juneau, they encountered Tim McCabe, an Irishman grateful to Jeff Graham for past kindness.|"['1.

A group of friends prepared for their journey to the gold fields. They bought essential items like a raft, tools, rope, sleds, and camping gear. They planned to start the trip in April from Juneau to Dawson City. The route involved a challenging journey through mountains and rivers. They explored different paths like the Chilkoot Pass and the White Pass. While waiting for their steamer to Dyea, the boys roamed the muddy streets of Juneau. They visited curio shops and saw totemic carvings in a nearby cemetery. A stranger approached them asking for help, but the boys were cautious. The man's intentions seemed suspicious, and the boys were alert. Despite the man's angry reaction, the boys stood their ground and returned to their hotel. The man hesitated to cause trouble due to the law in Juneau and the boys' strength. Ultimately, he decided against any wrongdoing and returned to his seat, realizing the futility of his plans.|"['1.

Dyea, a village with only one log store and some movable tents, was the destination for our friends and fifty other passengers on a crowded steam launch heading to the gold fields.

Jeff and Tim, after their Arctic ordeal, became skilled cooks. They ingeniously used three long poles to support the stove on the snow, preventing it from sinking. With flair, Tim whipped up light, flaky biscuits using baking powder and transformed hard butter into a spreadable delight. The amber coffee, paired with condensed milk and sugar, would have impressed any chef. They savored fried bacon and canned corn, relishing the flavors, especially in the cold. The boys, exhausted, made a cozy bed with hemlock branches, canvas, blankets, and robes. As they dozed off, a sudden roar jolted Frank awake, signaling an incoming avalanche.

"""Take my advice and go to sleep,"" Tim reassured his friends after the close call with the avalanche. The snow, like a monster, had stopped just short of their tent. The group, grateful for their providential escape, marveled at the vast pile of snow that nearly engulfed them. The next morning, they surveyed the snowy mountain, amazed by the chunks of ice scattered nearby. The treacherous climb up Chilkoot Pass, with its blinding snowstorms and fierce winds, had claimed the lives of many gold-seekers.

As they neared the summit, the terrain grew steeper, resembling a house's roof in the final five hundred feet. Struggling under their heavy loads, the group often found their noses nearly touching the snow, with rocky outcrops making the journey even more challenging. Working together, they managed to get one sled to the top, leaving one behind and then pushing and pulling the second sled with frequent breaks for rest. Hours of intense labor paid off as they finally reached the peak. After a brief rest, they began their descent for the other sled. Despite their efforts, all five stumbled several times. Roswell nearly slid into a ravine, but Jeff Graham skillfully threw a rope to save him from disaster. Exhausted but safe, the group marveled at the stunning views of the Pacific and the Yukon Valley, grateful for their progress and the unexpected help of an old Indian with a scow at Lake Lindeman.|"[""1.

Game is scarce in the valley of the Upper Yukon and the Klondike region. Many gold-seekers go without firearms as there is no fear of hostility from the Indians. Instead, they are hired to help carry loads through the passes. Jeff carried his own pistol and a Winchester rifle. The Indian guide was old but experienced, navigating the scow through the ice-lined shores of Lake Lindeman. Three mysterious men joined the group, one of whom was recognized by Ike Hardman. Frank noticed a secretive exchange between Hardman and one of the strangers, hinting at a hidden plan for that night.

Hardman felt content as the boat neared the shore. His friend smoked until the boat hit the ice projection. The old Indian leaped out, anchored the boat, and unloading started. The Indian offered help for a high price, but it was declined. Frank discovered something unsettling about Hardman, and he shared it with his friend. They decided to keep an eye on him. The group reached Lake Bennet, a starting point for the Yukon journey. They had to build a boat, and Jeff and Tim started cutting wood. Hardman joined in despite his lack of experience.

Despite his nervousness, Frank started feeling drowsy when a bird-like whistle startled him. He sensed Hardman rising silently. Frank nudged his sleeping friend, Roswell, but got no response. Frank, alert, saw Hardman leave the tent and signal someone. In the starlit night, Hardman met a shadowy figure near the water. Frank wished to eavesdrop but couldn't risk moving. He heard murmurs but couldn't make out words. The meeting was brief, and the stranger disappeared into the woods. Hardman returned to the tent, and Frank pretended to sleep.

"Looking at the trees, they noticed their friend handing his axe to Hardman, who was chopping nearby. Frank called out and signaled for Jeff to come over. Jeff, curious, approached. He listened intently as they shared a story with him. After hearing it, he calmly said, ""Don't tell Tim about this, kids."" Adding, ""I'm armed and ready; I might need them soon."" The men worked hard to gather enough timber for a raft in two days. Although a boat would have been better, they lacked the materials. They planned a sturdy double-decker raft with pine logs and a raised deck to protect their supplies. The boys fished during breaks, catching plenty of fish for their journey. On the third day, they loaded their goods onto the raft and set sail for a 28-mile trip. The strong north wind made sailing impossible, forcing them to wait out the gale."|"['1.

The men and boys on the raft were filled with hope as the wind calmed, allowing them to resume their voyage. Ike Hardman, usually reserved, was suddenly in good spirits, cracking jokes and showing a willingness to help. Despite his efforts, the others remained wary, unable to trust him fully. As they sailed, Jeff skillfully concealed any misgivings he had, steering the raft with precision. Suddenly, they spotted a body floating in the water, a grim reminder of the dangers of their journey.

"Tim McCabe, deeply affected by the melancholy incident, voiced the unspoken concern: ""There be five of us: will we all see home again?"" The question hung heavy in the air, met with silence. The group dispersed, somber and contemplative. As the afternoon waned, a decision loomed - to drift, land, or press on despite encroaching darkness. Jeff, the leader, advocated for sailing on, utilizing the deep waters and steady wind. Night fell swiftly, the raft carried by the wind. Hope for a safe night journey was tempered by Tim's warning of an impending storm. Restless, the group settled on the lee side, shrouded in rubber blankets.

The group faced a severe storm but found a safe spot to wait it out. They set up camp beyond Chilkoot Pass, surrounded by timber. The days were dreary, filled with monotonous hours. To pass the time, the men smoked pipes, while the boys played outside in the snow. They cut fuel from the woods, read pocket Bibles, and shared moments of reverence. When the storm subsided, they continued their journey through Caribou Crossing and Marsh Lake without trouble. Jeff's careful attention to the raft's stability proved crucial.

The group was on a raft in the Yukon's network of lakes, using poles to navigate. As the summer approached, the weather warmed, melting snow and ice. They advanced towards the Klondike ahead of many others. Passing through Miles Cañon, they faced dangerous rapids. The river was swift with rocks, causing the raft to hit obstacles repeatedly. At one point, the raft struck a rock but managed to continue. Approaching the perilous White Horse Rapids, Tim pretended to attempt the passage for amusement, alarming his friends.

"Navigating White Horse Rapids is extremely dangerous, and it is advised not to attempt to take a boat through it. One option is to let the boat drift down the rapids with a rope guiding it. If the boat survives, it can still be controlled below the rapids. Another approach is to use roller-ways on the western side to transport the boats overland. White Horse Rapids and Box Cañon are treacherous spots along the river, with the latter earning the nickname ""The Miners' Grave.""

Tim, Jeff, and Hardman navigated the raft towards the gold country. The journey was smooth, with clear weather and a promising summer ahead. As they passed Rink Rapids and Fort Selkirk, Tim's excitement grew. The group encountered other gold-seekers, exchanging greetings along the way. Jeff preferred to travel until dusk, hoping to spot wildlife, but the barren land disappointed him. They discussed the native people of Alaska, including the Thlinkets and Tenneh tribes.

"As Jeff spoke, he glanced at Hardman, who sat by the fire, silent and moody. The boys were puzzled by Jeff's sudden warnings, but the old miner had been observing Hardman closely and sensed trouble. Jeff's words were a caution to the rogue in their midst.

Despite the tense atmosphere, Jeff and Tim bantered playfully until bedtime, with no need for a watch as they were safe from wild animals or danger. The only threat was from within their own group, and they were wary of any betrayal.

The boys, missing the comforts of home, quickly learned to care for themselves under the guidance of the older members. As the weather warmed, the raft journeyed down the Yukon, passing the Milk River with its milky waters.

In his youth, Jeff Graham faced tough challenges that toughened him. His robust physique handled the strain better than his peers. Jeff's endurance and strength often shamed others. Having avoided destructive habits, his constitution was strong. The hardships of the journey through Chilkoot Pass and the Yukon region only reinforced his inner strength. Roswell Palmer and Frank Mansley, raised well, avoided harmful habits, maintaining excellent health. Tim McCabe and Ike Hardman struggled with drinking but abstained during the journey, benefiting from enforced temperance. Dr. George M. Dawson's 1887 report confirmed vast gold deposits in the Yukon, leading to the town's establishment. Dawson City, with a population of four thousand, is a well-governed hub with various denominations' churches. The region's gold riches drew worldwide attention in 1896 and 1897, with millions extracted in just three months. Dawson City's mining claims, including El Dorado and Too Much Gold Creek, promise significant wealth. Placer mining is the primary method used in the Klondike, with little quartz mining.|"[""1.

At Dawson City, the atmosphere was bustling and hurried as our group of friends arrived in late May, exactly two months after bidding farewell to their parents in San Francisco. Tim McCabe had gained valuable practical knowledge in the region, while Jeff drew on his experiences from the days of '49 and the wisdom he had picked up en route to the Klondike. After a meal together at the main hotel, a surprising turn of events unfolded. The old miner confronted Hardman, insisting he leave the group due to past misdeeds. Despite initial resistance, Hardman eventually departed. Jeff then explained the situation to Tim, detailing Hardman's suspicious behavior. The group, now down one member, continued their journey eastward on foot, equipped for placer mining. As they studied maps and gathered information in Dawson City, they set their sights on Too Much Gold Creek, encountering fellow gold-hunters and even grizzled miners on the way.|"[""1.

Two miners, in high spirits, set off on their mules. Within a week, both struck it rich and headed home wealthy. To the east and south rose a spur of the Rocky Mountains. The leader aimed to explore the region, akin to California. They continued their journey, encountering others with the same story of all land being claimed. They camped under a rock, then resumed early, heading east among the vast mountains. They followed a stream, alone in the wilderness. The climb was tough, but they persevered.

The group searched eagerly for more gold nuggets along the stream, but none were found. Eventually, they returned to their camp where Tim and Jeff awaited them. Upon examining the nugget, the leader was certain of its authenticity due to its weight. He inspected it closely, even testing its hardness by biting it. After tossing it in the air and catching it, he confirmed its value. With limited tools, they constructed a temporary home among the rocks using branches and dirt for shelter. They prepared to wash the pay dirt they found, ensuring they had enough supplies for a few weeks. To stake a claim, they needed to register it in Dawson City within sixty days. The claim could not exceed five hundred feet along the stream and had to be marked with specific stakes and initials. Their makeshift dwelling provided protection from the weather and potential intruders, offering a unique experience during their stay in the gold region.|['1.

In the old house, the walls had many jutting points used as hooks for hanging clothes. A ledge served as a bed for the boys, while the men laid their blankets on the floor. The mining tools and cooking utensils were neatly arranged against the back wall. The man mentioned the freezing temperatures and how they'd turn into icicles if they stayed. They followed him to a valley with a clear stream and green grass. The man gathered soil from the stream, washed it in a pan, and found gold particles. He quickly decided to head to Dawson City, forty miles away. They cleared gravel and stones to start mining for gold, using a pan to separate the gold from sand.|['1.

The boys watched closely as Tim skillfully separated the yellow and black particles, a sign of gold. Excitement lit up their eyes at the sight of the precious yellow grains. Tim then added mercury to extract the gold, forming an amalgam. The process involved using a bag to filter out excess mercury, leaving behind pure gold. Despite initial setbacks, their hard work paid off when they discovered sizable gold nuggets. The boys, filled with hope and joy, continued digging, uncovering even more riches in the gravel.

Jeff Graham made a surprising return during supper, riding a burro he bought for $500. Excited about their success, Jeff was confident they would strike it rich. He shared that he had filed their claims early to protect their find. Despite the cold, they discussed their success outside. Jeff revealed they had neighbors nearby, causing concern about potential theft due to the allure of gold. The next morning, they set up a rocker to wash the gold efficiently. The rocker separated gold from sand using water and a blanket. After a week, they estimated their gold to be worth nearly $100,000. They took Sundays off, but their minds were on their newfound wealth. With about 400 pounds of gold, they were eager to distribute the fortune among themselves.|['1.

"""It's important to be brave, Frank,"" Roswell said in a hushed tone. ""But sometimes, it's wiser to avoid unnecessary risks.

Frank was near where the gold was hidden, trying not to be seen. He crouched behind a rock too late. Hardman saw him and ran off. Frank chased him, but Hardman vanished. Frank kept running, determined to catch him. Suddenly, he saw someone ahead and aimed his gun. It was his cousin Roswell. They exchanged stories. The Klondike area was safe, so few carried weapons. Hardman and his friend only had one gun, which was empty. They left their weapons behind, a big mistake. Disheartened, they walked down the trail silently. They saw Hardman ahead, but he ran off.

To their surprise, Jeff was missing. The recent event reinforced their decision to guard the nuggets and dust diligently. While some worked in the diggings, one person always remained at the cavern to watch for any dishonest visitors. Tim and Roswell were to return to the valley to continue working, while Frank stood guard armed with a Winchester rifle. Just as they were about to leave, Jeff arrived with two well-dressed middle-aged gentlemen. After a brief conversation, the gentlemen bid farewell to Jeff and quickly departed. Jeff instructed everyone to get ready to follow. Within the hour, the party, along with the donkey, was on the road. They spent a night in camp but reached Dawson City safely without any trouble or loss of gold. Jeff sold the gold for $120,000 and his claim for $180,000, totaling $300,000.
