Frank pointed out the wildcat fleeing from the tree, leaving the ham behind in sudden fright. The cook, Will, explained that the cat desired the ham more than Uncle Toby did, so he let it have it. Frank marveled at the wildcat's unusual taste for smoked pork. They managed to salvage most of the ham for supper. Bluff expressed determination to retrieve his gun from Andy's camp. Jerry successfully skinned the game following Jesse Wilcox's method. Frank prepared the skin by stretching it on a frame to dry. He shared his method of boiling the meat before frying it with salt pork. Will explored the area and captured some beautiful pictures.

In the dark forest, the heavy timber made it hard for Jerry to tell which way was which. The storm was brewing, thunder booming, and rain about to pour. Luck led him to a tall stump with a gap just his size. Crawling inside, Jerry found refuge from the storm. Talking to himself for comfort, he settled in for the night. The wind howled, trees fell, and the night felt endless. Jerry blocked the opening, but a wild animal tried to barge in.

"The trail near our camp is getting closer. It seems like it's been used recently, indicating that someone has been coming and going. They probably want to make things difficult for us while we're here. Let's turn left and keep going this way,"" Jerry directed his friends.

"Old Toby was clever. If I had to act like a monkey as much as he does, I'd have a ladder too. It saves a lot of trouble and keeps his clothes in good shape. But wait, didn't we leave Bluff at the camp? I can't see our friend anywhere, can you, guys?

Suddenly, there was a sharp ""click"" near Frank's ear, indicating that Will was up to his usual mischief. He had managed to take a photo of the shaggy visitor enjoying the canned corn from the open kettle. The bear was relishing this rare treat and making the most of it.

Jerry, excited at the sight, mentioned that he saw movement behind the tent, hoping it was Bluff. He was eager to take a shot at the bear, even with bird-shot, as it would be effective at close range. Frank, however, had a feeling that there might be another surprise in store. Just then, another shot rang out, causing the bear to roar in anger and attempt to climb a tree to escape. Uncle Toby warned Frank to be careful as the bear was furious.

"There goes one more; and the bear still lives. Talk to me about that, will you, if he didn't shoot its stub of a tail off that time! What next, I wonder? Why not execute the poor beast scientifically, and not murder him by inches?

""Wait, I say; give Bluff one more chance. Make allowance for his excitement and his position while the bear is shaking that tree so. If he misses again we will both fire together and put an end to the comedy before it turns into a tragedy.""

A sixth roar drowned Frank's last words. This time Bluff must have steeled his nerves, and covered the side of the bear, for with the report the animal keeled over, made a vain attempt to get up again, gave a few kicks, and then lay still.

""Come down here and stand over the fallen beast while I immortalize you as the mightiest Nimrod of them all,"" called Will, rushing up with his camera ready to do the business with neatness and dispatch.

Jerry said nothing. He looked a bit dejected as he stood there and surveyed the dead bear. It was not envy that gripped his soul either, for Jerry was generous by nature. Something else had seized upon him, and Frank smiled as though satisfied with the way things had come out.
