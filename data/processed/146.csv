Sara, a young girl working hard to earn her living, hoped her efforts would soften the hearts of those around her. However, she soon realized her willingness only made others more demanding. Despite her pride in not accepting charity, her situation worsened. Instead of being taught like the other girls, Sara was given menial tasks. She felt isolated and no longer a part of the group.

Before dawn, Sara's handmaid quietly entered her attic to help her dress and light the kitchen fire. At night, a humble knock on Sara's door signaled her maid's readiness to assist once more. In the midst of Sara's grief, she and her friend Ermengarde drifted apart. Ermengarde, dull but affectionate, clung to Sara, bringing her lessons and seeking stories. Sara, lost in her troubles, unintentionally neglected Ermengarde. When Ermengarde returned from a brief absence, she encountered a changed Sara, burdened with mending tasks. Sara's altered appearance surprised Ermengarde, who could only manage a short, awkward laugh. The girls' friendship suffered as a barrier grew between them, exacerbated by Miss Minchin's actions that further distanced them. Ermengarde's awkwardness intensified, and Sara's wretchedness clouded their interactions. Eventually, they barely acknowledged each other, with Ermengarde appearing more listless and unhappy than ever.|"[""1.

"That evening, Sara arrived at her attic later than usual. She had been held back at work past the usual bedtime for students and then had gone to her lessons in the quiet schoolroom. Upon reaching the attic, she was surprised to notice a faint glow of light peeking from beneath the door. Someone had lit a candle, not the one from the kitchen as expected, but one from the students' rooms. It turned out to be Ermengarde, sitting on the old footstool, clad in her nightgown and a red shawl. Ermengarde's tone stirred emotions in Sara. She explained her situation, revealing that Miss Minchin forbade her from talking to the other girls. Feeling lonely and misunderstood, Ermengarde expressed her longing to reconcile and be friends again. Overwhelmed, Sara confessed her pride and admitted her fear of not being a nice child. Ermengarde, intrigued by Sara's storytelling skills, whispered ""The Bastille,"" recalling Sara's vivid tales of the French Revolution."|"['1.

"""Yes,"" she said, hugging her knees, ""that will be a good place to pretend about. I am a prisoner in the Bastille. I have been here for years and years--and years; and everybody has forgotten about me. Miss Minchin is the jailer--and Becky""--a sudden light adding itself to the glow in her eyes--""Becky is the prisoner in the next cell.""

""And will you tell me all about it?"" she said. ""May I creep up here at night, whenever it is safe, and hear the things you have made up in the day? It will seem as if we were more 'best friends' than ever.""

The third person in the trio was Lottie. She was a small thing and did not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the alteration she saw in her young adopted mother. She had heard it rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she could not understand why she looked different--why she wore an old black frock and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place of honor and learn lessons herself. 

There had been much whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that Sara no longer lived in the rooms in which Emily had so long sat in state. Lottie's chief difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked her questions. At seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand them.

"Sara turned around at the sound of her voice, surprised. She wondered what would happen next. If Lottie started crying and someone heard, they would be in trouble. Sara got off her table and hurried to Lottie. ""Isn't it?"" gasped Lottie, looking around nervously. Despite being spoiled, she cared enough for Sara to try and compose herself. Lottie whispered, ""Why isn't it, Sara?"" She described the view from the attic window, feeling like it was a different world. The sparrows outside seemed fearless, hopping around on the slanted rooftops. Sara wished someone lived in the adjacent attic so they could talk and visit each other. Looking out from the attic window made the world below seem unreal to Lottie. When they tossed out crumbs, a sparrow hesitated but eventually took one, realizing Sara and Lottie meant no harm."|['1.

Sara was thrilled when her friend Lottie visited the attic. They enjoyed a meal together, chatting happily. Sara pointed out the beauty of the room to Lottie, who was amazed by the cozy space. Sara described how the slanting ceiling and small window made it feel like a nest in a tree. She envisioned a lovely room with soft rugs, a comfortable sofa, and a warm fire in the grate. Despite the room's current state, Sara's imagination painted a picture of a beautiful space. After Lottie left, Sara was left alone in the attic. As she sat pondering, a rat appeared, drawn by the crumbs on the floor. Sara's vivid imagination had transformed the attic into a magical place, despite its flaws.|"['1.

Sara was intrigued by the peculiar appearance of the rat, resembling a gray-whiskered dwarf or gnome. As she observed him cautiously approaching the crumbs, she pondered on the hardships of being a despised rat compared to a beloved sparrow. Despite his fear, the rat's hunger pushed him to risk approaching Sara, who sat quietly and non-threatening. Miraculously, a silent understanding passed between them, and the rat sensed safety in Sara's presence. He cautiously nibbled on the crumbs, glancing apologetically at Sara, who watched with bated breath. When the rat finally gathered the courage to snatch a larger crumb, he fled back to his family, leaving Sara touched by the unspoken connection they shared.|"[""1.

After a week, Ermengarde cautiously crept up to the attic to visit Sara. When she tapped on the door, Sara took a few minutes to respond. Ermengarde was surprised by Sara's soft laughter and coaxing words to someone unseen, making her nervous about ghosts. As their friendship grew, Ermengarde watched Sara interact with a rat named Melchisedec. Sara fed the rat and explained how he shared the food with his family, each having a unique squeak.

Sara spoke of the man as if he were a person just like them, with hunger, fear, a family, and possibly even thoughts. She believed his eyes showed a person within. Sara's attic was her refuge, where she could talk freely with Ermengarde. Despite Sara's lonely life, she found solace in imagining the lives of families she passed on the street. Sara was once a princess, but now, dressed in shabby clothes, she felt invisible among the bustling crowds. She found joy in watching the Large Family and had given each member romantic names. One day, as the Montmorency children prepared to go to a party, Sara paused to admire the youngest boy, Guy Clarence, with his rosy cheeks and curls, momentarily forgetting her own troubles.|['Question 1: How does Sara view the man she spoke of in the passage?\nA) As a prince\nB) As a beggar\nC) As a person with emotions and a family\nD) As a ghost\nE) As a magician', 'Question 2: Where does Sara find solace and freedom to talk with Ermengarde?\nA) In the park\nB) In the library\nC) In the attic\nD) In the market\nE) In the garden', 'Question 3: What does Sara do to find comfort despite her lonely life?\nA) She goes to parties\nB) She imagines the lives of families she sees\nC) She isolates herself\nD) She ignores everyone around her\nE) She travels to different countries', 'Question 4: How does Sara feel about her own visibility among the crowds?\nA) She feels like a princess\nB) She feels like a ghost\nC) She feels invisible\nD) She feels like a celebrity\nE) She feels like a superhero', 'Question 5: What brings joy to Sara as mentioned in the passage?\nA) Watching the Large Family\nB) Going to the market\nC) Reading books\nD) Watching movies\nE) Playing with toys', 'Question 6: What momentarily distracts Sara from her troubles in the passage?\nA) The party preparations\nB) The attic\nC) The market\nD) The library\nE) The garden']|['C) As a person with emotions and a family', 'C) In the attic', 'B) She imagines the lives of families she sees', 'C) She feels invisible', 'A) Watching the Large Family', 'A) The party preparations']
"During the Christmas season, the Large Family heard touching stories about poor children without parents to celebrate with. These stories inspired Guy Clarence, who wanted to help a poor child.

Sara felt a peculiar connection to her doll, Emily, who sat silently observing everything. In moments of loneliness, Sara wished Emily could understand and sympathize with her, even though she knew it was just a pretend. Sara would often sit across from Emily, imagining her to be a protective witch. Late at night, in the quiet attic, Sara's fanciful thoughts would almost make her believe Emily could respond. Sara found solace in staying calm when faced with insults, believing it showed strength. Despite her efforts to console herself with these thoughts, there were times when the harshness of her day made it hard to find comfort in her imagination.

Sara's emotions surged as she gazed at Emily, her doll. Overwhelmed by a mix of sadness and anger, she impulsively knocked Emily off her chair, unleashing a flood of tears. Through sobs, Sara lashed out at the doll, accusing it of being heartless and filled with sawdust. Despite her outburst, Emily remained calm on the floor, gazing back at Sara with an almost sympathetic look. Sara's remorse grew, and she gently picked up Emily, realizing that the doll couldn't change its nature just as some people couldn't alter their traits. Reflecting on the empty house next door, Sara imagined a friendly face appearing at the attic window, sparking a hopeful curiosity.

"Sara observed the grand furniture being unloaded from vans outside Miss Minchin's house. She imagined the personalities of the owners based on the furniture—fat armchairs for the Large Family. Sara felt a connection to the Oriental pieces, reminiscent of her time in India. She noticed a rosy man, likely the father of the newcomers, showing familiarity with the house next door.

Becky preferred to imagine the new neighbor as an exotic and mysterious individual, rather than a regular church-goer. She envisioned his potential family to be unique and different.

One day, a carriage arrived with the father of a large family, accompanied by a nurse and servants, to assist the frail man.

Sara heard an unusual sound and turned to see a native Indian man-servant with a monkey on the attic window. The man seemed homesick, longing for the sun. As Sara smiled at him, his face lit up, and the monkey, feeling mischievous, leaped onto Sara's shoulder and into her room. Sara, recalling her Hindustani, spoke to the man. He was overjoyed to hear his language and explained that the monkey, though good, was hard to catch. He offered to retrieve the monkey if Sara allowed.

Ram Dass quietly entered Sara's attic through the window, moving with the ease of someone accustomed to such maneuvers. He skillfully closed the skylight after a brief encounter with a mischievous monkey. Grateful for Sara's kindness, he expressed his appreciation in a dignified manner, despite the humble surroundings. Sara, reflecting on her past life of luxury, contrasted it with her current situation as a servant girl. She pondered her future under Miss Minchin's strict rule, realizing that her only hope for improvement lay in her own dedication to learning. Sara found solace in the idea that true nobility comes from within, recalling the strength of Marie Antoinette during her darkest hours.

This was a familiar idea, not new but old. It had comforted her through tough times, giving her an air of mystery that puzzled Miss Minchin. Sara seemed to live in a world apart, unaffected by harsh words. Even when scolded, Sara's eyes held a proud defiance. She imagined herself a princess, above the petty cruelty around her. This fantasy amused her and gave her strength. When mistreated, Sara responded with grace and politeness that surprised even the staff. Sara's daydreams of royal life protected her from becoming bitter like those who mistreated her. In class, Sara's mind wandered to stories of disguised royals, like Alfred the Great burning cakes. The idea of being a real princess both thrilled and frightened her. When Miss Minchin punished her, Sara's laughter revealed her inner strength and resilience, much to the fascination of her classmates.|"['1.

Sara had a clear vision of her future, speaking in a way that even impressed Miss Minchin. It almost seemed that there was a hidden power behind her boldness. Sara enjoyed imagining what went on beyond the walls of the Select Seminary, especially next to the Indian gentleman's house. She hoped the thick wall would shield him from noise. Sara felt a connection to him, watching and caring from afar. Ermengarde shared her dislike for her relatives.

"Sara often imagined herself as a soldier on a long and tiring march, finding solace in the phrase ""long and weary march."" She had a whimsical notion of being a hostess in the attic, dreaming of grand castle scenarios. Despite their hunger, Ermengarde admired Sara's unique eyes. Unbeknownst to them, a dark face peered through the skylight, but Sara's keen ears caught a noise on the stairs. Sara, anticipating Miss Minchin's anger, quickly extinguished the candle. Sara raged at the injustice done to Becky, defending her friend's innocence. Witnessing Sara's tears, Ermengarde was taken aback by this new side of her usually composed friend.

Sara shared a heartwarming tale with her friends about a kind little boy who gave her a sixpence for charity. The boy, part of the Large Family, noticed Sara's need and selflessly shared his Christmas sixpence with her. Ermengarde, excitedly, mentioned a box full of delicious treats her aunt sent her. Despite having a full stomach, she was eager to share the goodies with Sara. In a moment of luck, Becky, another friend, joined them in the attic. Overwhelmed by gratitude, Becky dropped her shawl in a rush. Sara, touched by the simple act of kindness, felt a spark of hope in her heart.

One of Sara's favorite ideas was that thoughts were waiting for people to call them. Becky had seen her do this many times and knew that soon Sara would uncover an enlightened, laughing face. Sara found a package in the attic, forgotten but containing a dozen small white handkerchiefs. She arranged them on the table with lace edges curling outward, using her Magic to transform them into something special. Sara explained to Becky what each item was, turning simple objects into a banquet hall with her imagination. Ermengarde was amazed when she entered the room to find a festive table set with red, white napery, and flowers. Sara's ability to turn ordinary things into wonders left everyone in awe.|"['1.

Sara shared her magical vision with her friends, making them almost see the splendid feast laid out before them: golden platters, vaulted spaces, blazing logs, and twinkling tapers. As they unpacked the hamper filled with frosted cakes, fruits, bonbons, and wine, the feast transformed into a magnificent sight. Sara then cleverly suggested lighting some paper to create the illusion of a real fire, adding to the enchantment. She playfully instructed Ermengarde and Becky to imagine minstrels playing in the corner as they began their feast. However, their joy was interrupted when Miss Minchin burst in angrily, accusing Sara of orchestrating the banquet.

The dream had ended abruptly. The once lively scene had faded away, leaving only remnants of the grandeur. The room was now bare, devoid of the golden plates and elegant decorations that had adorned it. Emily sat against the wall, lost in thought. Sara, noticing her distress, approached her with concern. What would have transpired if Emily had not hidden at that moment and glanced up at the skylight? The chapter's outcome might have been altered. A mysterious face lingered outside the window, unnoticed by Emily in her weariness. As she drifted into slumber, she imagined a cozy setting, eventually succumbing to a deep sleep.

She was certain she hadn't returned to earth when she opened her eyes. The room was transformed into a magical place. A glowing fire crackled in the grate, a little kettle hissed on the hob, and a crimson rug warmed the floor. A cozy chair with cushions sat before the fire, accompanied by a small table covered in white cloth holding dishes, a teapot, and more. New coverings adorned the bed, and a luxurious robe and slippers waited nearby. The room was bathed in warm light from a bright lamp with a rosy shade. Sara felt like she was in a dream, but everything felt real. She touched everything, confirming its reality. Becky awoke to find Sara in a crimson silk robe, exuding a radiant presence.

Sara and Becky sat by the fire, overwhelmed with joy. Sara assured Becky that the magical feast wouldn't vanish as dreams do; she could taste the muffin and feel the warmth of the coal. The cozy drowsiness of childhood comfort enveloped them. Sara and Becky cherished every detail of the transformed room, savoring the soup, sandwiches, and muffins. The next morning, rumors spread about Sara's disgrace and Becky's punishment. Despite this, Sara's rapid growth and intelligence spared her from immediate dismissal. The older girls speculated that Sara's talents would soon lead to her teaching classes for no pay.

"Miss Minchin was quite anxious. This event hinted at peculiar things to her grim mind. Could it be that she had erred, and the neglected child had a potent yet unconventional ally in the shadows—perhaps an unknown relative, who had suddenly traced her location and decided to care for her in this mysterious and extraordinary manner? Relatives could be quite peculiar—especially wealthy old bachelor uncles who preferred to keep children at bay. Such a man might opt to oversee his young relative's well-being from afar. However, such a person would likely be irritable and easily offended. It would not be pleasant if such an individual discovered the truth about the meager clothes, the sparse food, and the arduous labor. She felt very strange and unsure, giving Sara a sideways glance. ""Well,"" she said, using a tone she hadn't used since the girl lost her father, ""someone is very generous to you.

The tale held a unique charm, for it had actually happened to Sara and the mysterious Indian gentleman next door. Becky, having also heard the story, hurried upstairs earlier than usual, seeking solace in the magic room once more. Uncertain of its fate, she anticipated its likely removal by Miss Minchin, leaving the attic empty. Despite her happiness for Sara, climbing the stairs with tears in her eyes, Becky lamented the loss of the cozy fire, the warm lamp, the shared suppers, and the enchanting stories with Sara. The joy that filled the Large Family nursery was unparalleled. Everyone clamored to hear Sara's adventures repeatedly, finding delight in the contrast between their warm surroundings and Sara's cold attic. The attic, once overlooked, now held a special place in their hearts, especially when they remembered Melchisedec, the sparrows, and the view from the skylight.
