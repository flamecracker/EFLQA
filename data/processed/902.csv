The Swallow recounted stories of the King of the Mountains of the Moon and the pygmies at war with butterflies. The Prince, moved by the Swallow's stories, asked him to observe his city. Flying over, the Swallow saw stark contrasts: merrymaking rich and starving beggars. The Swallow selflessly plucked gold leaf from the Happy Prince to aid the poor during winter, enduring the cold to show kindness.

At a grand celebration, a Fire-balloon excitedly plans to share the news with the stars. The Rocket, however, dismisses the occasion as trivial and predicts a tragic scenario involving the Prince and Princess losing their only son. The Rocket's pessimism is met with criticism from the Roman Candle and Bengal Light, who call it humbug.
