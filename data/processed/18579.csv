Percy, feeling disheartened, suggested being dropped off at Key West to find a boat to Nassau. However, Captain Passford explained the risks due to the Bellevite being near a U.S. naval station. To avoid trouble, they decided to stay fifty miles from Key West. As they approached Mobile Bay, they prepared for potential conflict by mounting guns. The owner hoped to avoid using them, especially when passing Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines, garrisoned by Confederates. To enter the bay safely, they planned to navigate the Middle Channel during high tide. Percy, worried about being forced into service, found solace in Christy's company.

Christy, the most knowledgeable aboard, was busy instructing Percy, his companion, on their plan to save him from military duty. Percy, wearing a naval uniform, was to act as a Confederate agent guiding the ship into the bay. As the Bellevite neared the Middle Channel, a tug-boat approached, armed with a heavy gun. Captain Breaker, wary but non-confrontational, aimed to avoid conflict. As the vessel navigated shallow waters, Percy, playing his role convincingly, awaited the critical moment. The success of their scheme relied on Percy's confident performance. Captain Breaker, cautious yet hopeful, steered the Bellevite towards Dauphine Island, ensuring they stayed in deep waters. The plan was risky, but with Percy's commitment and the crew's discretion, they hoped to pass the forts undetected.|"[""1.

The second officer moved forward, while the first officer went aft, each to carry out their assigned tasks from the captain. The speed of the Bellevite had been decreased, and she was moving at a slow pace. The tug was spotted at a distance beyond Fort Gaines, struggling to go faster than six knots per hour. The steamer had loaded all the coal possible in her bunkers and hold, but had used a lot during her journey, leaving enough for the return trip. Suddenly, the Bellevite grounded, and Mr. Vapoor in the engine-room stopped the machine. After a delay, the ship moved forward again, but faced challenges navigating the channel. The captain of the tug warned about the forts' firepower, while Percy hinted at the steamer's armament, causing tension as the major arrived, surprised to see his brother in a Union uniform.|"[""1.

"""I am pleased to see you back,"" the major stated, not extending his hand. ""You abandoned like a coward, and I've been ashamed since. An eighteen-year-old who won't defend his country should lose respect, even from his brother.""""You weren't? You fled to New Orleans against your father's wishes.

The ship's commander showed signs of acting, and all onboard followed suit, albeit finding it amusing to take orders from an eighteen-year-old. Despite this, he acknowledged the young agent with a slight nod. The interaction between the ship's authority and his sibling left the major bewildered, rendering him speechless momentarily. Captain Breaker, the sole pilot, had to leave the guest to steer the ship. Trying to cross the bar proved futile, so the vessel was directed towards the main ship-channel, risking shots from Fort Morgan. Percy, with newfound courage, declared the vessel's allegiance to the Confederate States. The major, visibly perturbed, retreated from his stance against his brother, abandoning the idea of sending him to the fort.

Horatio and his brother, Homer, sat down in the library for a serious conversation. Horatio, the owner of the Bellevite yacht, planned to use it to take Florry back to her mother. However, Homer was concerned about the risks due to the ongoing war and blockade. Horatio, despite being aware of the dangers, was willing to give up the Bellevite to the Union for the greater good. This decision shocked Homer, who supported the Southern Confederacy. The brothers engaged in a heated debate, each unable to comprehend the other's political beliefs.

""It pains me to see us on opposite sides,"" expressed Homer earnestly. ""I stand by the South to the end, ready to give my all."" Horatio, equally steadfast, retorted, ""I came to ensure Florry's safety and support our country as a whole."" The tension rose as they defended their beliefs. ""Let's not quarrel,"" proposed Horatio, sensing the futility of further debate. ""Your loyalty to the South disappoints me,"" Homer lamented. ""And your allegiance to the North troubles me,"" Horatio countered. As emotions ran high, Homer chuckled, finding irony in their dispute. Horatio foresaw a bleak future for his brother, predicting financial ruin due to the war. Despite their differences, Horatio offered Homer refuge at Glenfield.

Horatio quietly expressed his concerns, stating that if his brother, Homer, had indeed betrayed him by possibly handing over his steamer to the enemy, he would have to prioritize his own safety.

"""The water is too cold this morning, Percy,"" Christy said. ""You should credit your brother for caring about your family's reputation. I'd rather my brother drown than desert from the army."" Christy, an able-bodied eighteen-year-old, had little sympathy for Percy, who seemed spoiled and unfit for duty. The steamer, short-handed, had soldiers helping out. Major Pierson appeared, surprised to see Percy with Christy, quickly untying him. Major Pierson apologized for the mistake, explaining that Percy's actions had disgraced his family. The major assured Christy he would make amends. Christy stayed silent, cautious about revealing more.

Major Pierson assured, ""I'm sure everything with the steamer is fine. Though your father is Northern, I believe he'll choose wisely in this conflict."" Christy agreed, knowing there were two sides to the issue. The tug altered course eastward, serving breakfast to the major and Percy.

The major was growing impatient due to the delay caused by Captain Pecklar's illness, which left him unable to steer the steamer. Offering the command to Christy, the major observed him closely, concerned about his ability as a steamboat captain. However, Christy skillfully navigated the boat towards another vessel with confidence. The major was impressed by Christy's competence, considering him for a possible army appointment. Lieutenant Dallberg, exhausted from his duties, boarded the steamer. He shared information about Captain Passford's family, including Miss Florence's sudden departure. This news deeply affected the major, hinting at his feelings for Miss Florry. Despite the uncertainty about her departure, the major's emotions were clearly stirred.|"[""1.

"""I regret to go against your wishes, Major Pierson; however, I must resign without your consent,"" Christy responded promptly. He understood his actions and refused to aid the enemies of the Union. ""Who do you mean by the enemy, Major Pierson?"" Christy asked, looking at the Bellevite approaching. The major explained the steamer was an enemy of the Confederate States. ""The steamer didn't come here as an enemy; she came on a peaceful mission. Now it seems my uncle betrayed my father,"" Christy said emotionally. The major argued that the steamer should not be handed to the Yankee navy. Christy opposed, stating his father's steamer was not engaged in war acts. Realizing his situation, Christy refused to assist in capturing the Bellevite. Major Pierson was puzzled as the tug lacked a pilot to capture the steamer.

The young Unionist noticed that the major was eager to learn about the Bellevite's strength but failed to get any information from the guarded son of the owner. The major expressed concern for the sick captain of the tug, hoping to aid him. Christy, feeling pity, was willing to help without compromising his beliefs. The major blamed Christy for delaying assistance due to his refusal to steer the boat.

As the Leopard sailed ahead, the acting captain noticed that most of the crew had vanished, except for one. The major was likely tending to the sick captain or preparing for the meeting with Bellevite's crew. Soon, Percy Pierson took the vacant spot on the forecastle. A voice called from the stern, and Percy headed aft. Later, he joined Lieutenant Dallberg in the pilot-house, who had dozed off after sharing his findings. Christy sensed something brewing below deck, possibly a plan to seize the Bellevite. Despite Percy's eagerness to steer, Christy doubted his skills. The major's group huddled under the hurricane-deck, discussing orders. Christy overheard the major instructing the crew to ignore the engine bells and only stop when commanded. The major emphasized the importance of not starting the engine without his orders, even if the Leopard seemed in danger.|"['1.

Percy steered the tug well for a beginner, but the waves made the boat sway without a skilled hand at the helm. The Leopard was half a mile from the Bellevite. Christy saw the water was too shallow for the Bellevite where the tug was heading.

The wind was picking up from the south, making the long-boat from the Leopard struggle in the sea. The soldiers rowed poorly due to lack of experience. Christy, on the Bellevite, was in no rush to act on his plan. He showed his revolver to Percy, but hoped not to use it. He closely watched Percy, as they were on opposing sides. Percy's loyalty was shallow, and he had shared enough to be understood. Christy had a deep interest in ships and engines, having spent time in the pilot-house and engine rooms.

Christy created a new path for the tug, considering the approaching steamer and the long-boat's altered movements. He instructed the pilot to head straight for the Bellevite, ensuring a safe distance from the soldiers in the long-boat. Christy then checked on Captain Pecklar, who seemed in good spirits. The captain expressed his desire to leave the country. Observing the Bellevite and another vessel, Christy noticed the Bellevite starting its engine. The situation escalated as the Bellevite changed course towards the tug. Major Pierson's men rowed energetically towards the tug, while the Bellevite's intentions remained unclear.
