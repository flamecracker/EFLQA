Tom chuckled in response, feeling a mix of excitement and apprehension about his upcoming journey. He hurried back home, contemplating the risks ahead, including encounters with head-hunters. Upon returning, he found his friend Ned meticulously checking the supplies for their gold-hunting expedition. Meanwhile, Mr. Damon was settling in at the Swift house until their departure. Tom learned that their rivals, the Fogers, had abruptly left town, possibly embarking on a ship journey. Despite trying to push aside thoughts of the Fogers, Tom couldn't shake a sense of impending trouble. As they readied for their trip to an underground city, Tom hinted at potential dangers. The group focused on packing essentials, with their balloon and supplies sent ahead.

"Tom pondered, ""How big?"" He learned that there was a creature larger than three men and many smaller ones. Excited, Eradicate decided to join the adventure for gold. He joked about being safe from head-hunters. Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and Eradicate were all set for their journey to Mexico.

The trip to New York was calm, but upon arrival, they faced their first letdown. The ship they were to board had been delayed due to a storm. While Tom and Ned explored theaters, Mr. Damon opted for museums and historical sites. Eradicate spent his time in restaurants, enjoying chicken and pork chops, funded by Tom. He also marveled at jewelry store displays, envisioning his golden images. Excitement peaked when they received a message stating their ship, the Maderia, bound for Mexico, would set sail at high tide that night. Eager to embark, they arrived early, witnessing the bustling dock activities.

Ned observed a heavy man struggling up the steep gangplank with a valise. The tide was rising, making it challenging for the man to board the ship. As Eradicate assisted the man, two others behind him, a man and a boy, seemed anxious. They covered their faces and hurried to their stateroom, evading detection by Tom and Ned. The commotion of the ship's departure added to the confusion. Lights illuminated the deck as farewells were exchanged between passengers on the boat and those on the dock. Amidst the excitement, Tom and Ned suspected that the mysterious duo might be following them to uncover the secret of the city of gold. Rushing to the purser's office, they learned that there were no passengers by the name of Foger onboard, heightening their suspicions.|"['1.

"""Yes, sometimes people use false names,"" explained the ship's officer, glancing at the boys. ""Criminals do it to evade the police, or famous folks to dodge reporters. But I doubt--""""I don't think they'd do that,"" Tom interjected quickly, sensing the purser's growing suspicion. If the Fogers were hiding under aliases, they might hear about inquiries and cause trouble. ""You can check the passenger list later,"" the purser offered. ""Describe who you're looking for, and I might help. I've met most passengers."" ""They're not here,"" Ned concluded. ""We must have been wrong,"" Tom agreed, relieved. As they dined, Tom felt uneasy, associating it with the Fogers. He scanned for the mysterious passengers but found empty seats. The thought lingered, making his sleep restless.

"""The sharks are excellent divers,"" Mr. Sander explained. ""The porpoises can't escape that way. Their only hope is to scare the sharks away, or they'll keep killing until they're full, which won't be anytime soon."" Excitement grew on deck as passengers, crew, and officers watched the intense scene. The porpoises desperately tried to escape the hungry sharks. The sharks were relentless, darting among the porpoises and attacking with their jaws. The captain provided rifles to Mr. Sander, who fired to scare off the sharks. The sharks eventually disappeared, leaving behind some dead fish. Despite efforts to catch a glimpse of mysterious passengers in Stateroom No. 27, Tom was unsuccessful.

Tom was the first to leave his room and hurried through the bright passages to reach the deck, eager to find out what was happening. As he passed Eradicate's room, he noticed the confusion growing on deck but realized the ship was stable. Amidst the chaos, he heard panicked voices searching for life preservers and fearing the worst. Tom paused by a door, which suddenly flung open to reveal a surprising sight. Mr. Foger looked different without his moustache, and Andy's red hair was now black, disguising their identities. Tom suspected their presence on the ship might be connected to the city of gold. Despite the urge to question them, Tom decided to focus on the current situation and headed to the deck to join the crowd.

Three friends returned to their state-room, and Eradicate also went to rest. The ship resumed its journey after a brief pause due to engine damage from the shock. Despite the storm, the ship navigated well. The next morning, curious onlookers saw a hole in the bow covered with canvas. The focus shifted to preparing for landing as they neared their destination. The Fogers remained secluded in their stateroom, arousing Tom's curiosity. After five days of preparations, including hiring ox carts and unloading the balloon, the group set off with a caravan. During a meal break near a stream, Eradicate's spicy beans caused a commotion, inadvertently revealing their mission to the Mexican drivers.

"Tom quickly interrupted, ""We're not looking for gold mines!"" He didn't like the greedy look in Delazes' eyes when gold was mentioned, so he directed Rad to pack up. Tom wanted to cover a good distance before camping. The Mexican, shrugging, called the Americans alert and always on the move. Tom wanted to keep the colored man busy to avoid more questions. The Mexicans reluctantly prepared their ox teams. Tom insisted on skipping the siesta to keep moving. Armed and ready, they continued their journey towards the cool woods in their padded-seat cart, driven by Eradicate. Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon talked freely in their cart, away from the Mexicans' ears.

Tom and his group were being followed by the Fogers as they traveled through the trail. To throw off the pursuers, they devised a plan to confuse them by splitting their caravan. Ned was concerned about explaining this to Delazes, but Tom wasn't bothered. He believed Delazes might think they were on a mission for historical relics, just like other expeditions in the area. The Mexicans agreed to continue after supper upon hearing about double pay. As they traveled by moonlight, they aimed to be discreet to keep the Fogers unaware of their night journey.

All were happy when Tom chose to set up camp, so they slept in the next morning. The trail was now hard to follow, making it impossible for anyone, like the Fogers, to track them closely. They journeyed for two more days without any sign of the Fogers. Passing through Mexican villages, they stopped to eat, and Tom asked about the ancient city of Poltec and the ruined temple plain, but no one knew. Even after a week, they found no clues. Tom decided to use a balloon for a better view. As they camped one night, Tom heard a noise and saw green eyes staring at him from a wild animal.

Tom had almost concluded that the creature was a mix between a cougar and a mountain lion. He pondered if anyone else in the camp was awake and could help. Every move he made seemed to provoke the beast more. Tom considered the old tales of subduing a wild animal by staring into its eyes. Though armed with only light sticks, his gun was out of reach. As the fire flared up, he saw the fierce beast clearly. With no other soul awake in the camp, Tom knew he had to face the creature alone. Feeling the imminent danger, he dropped the sticks. The beast growled and advanced stealthily. Tom's heart raced as the creature closed in on him. Desperate for help, Tom began calling out to his friend, hoping to draw the beast's attention away long enough for his friend to act.|"['1.

"A loud crack pierced the darkness, followed by a cannon-like sound and an eerie scream. Tom, the young inventor, instinctively jumped back as he witnessed the dying cougar's greenish eyes change color. Dirt showered over him, but he was safe. Rushing back to camp, he found Ned and the group erupted into commotion. As fires blazed in the primitive village, they attracted curious stares. Running low on cornmeal, Tom and Eradicate stopped at a house where Tom spotted a golden image resembling one from Africa.

"""Ah!"" exclaimed Delazes, and there was a world of meaning in his tone. His small dark eyes glittered as they shifted from the image to Tom and back again. ""Ah!"" muttered the contractor. ""So the senor has found what he was searching for? It IS gold after all, but such gold as never seen before. The senor hopes to get many relics like that for his museum, is it not?

The contractor agreed, and the conversation was in English, leaving the Mexicans unaware of its content. Tom understood the risky situation, suspecting Delazes might manipulate the Mexicans to inflate the statue's price. The contractor planned to stay the night in the village, instructing Delazes and his crew to settle in with locals. They would set up camp and discuss the relic the next day. Mr. Damon expressed surprise at the unexpected turn of events, prompting Tom to seek information about the statue's origin. Despite the challenges of conversing in Spanish, Tom aimed to uncover the truth about the golden image. He intended to eventually leave Delazes behind and navigate towards the temple ruins. After a night's rest, Tom visited the aged Mexican's home in search of the statue, noticing a mysterious glint in the old man's eyes. Delazes was absent, prompting Tom to converse in Spanish to inquire about the golden image.|"['1.

The Mexican paused, then called for someone in the next room. Soon, an old woman entered, carrying a stunning golden statue. Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon marveled at the exquisite craftsmanship of the eight-inch statue. It depicted a man in regal attire, seated with a crown on his head and holding a globe in one hand and what seemed to be tablets in the other. The Mexican explained that the statue had been in his family for generations, bringing bad luck when lost. Reluctantly, he allowed Tom to examine it closely. To everyone's surprise, Tom discovered a faint map engraved on the base, pointing due west to the ruins of the temple they sought.

Tom and his team embarked on a daring adventure to locate a mysterious temple. Despite the skepticism of the contractor and his workers, Tom was determined to find the truth. The journey westward presented challenges, with Tom cautious of revealing their destination to the superstitious Mexicans. As they prepared a dirigible balloon for their expedition, Mr. Damon's eccentricities and the laziness of some workers added to the difficulties. Tom's strategic thinking became evident as he anticipated Delazes' pursuit, ensuring they were well-prepared for any eventuality.

Tom was almost certain that the Mexicans were up to something, especially Delazes, who was trying to trick him into revealing their destination. The sight of a golden image had stirred the greed in Delazes and his men, making them a threat to Tom's group. Tom was cautious, keeping their true goal a secret. Despite the looming danger, Tom was relieved that their secret was safe for now. The next day, a storm prevented them from testing the balloon. After enduring three days of rain, the sun finally came out, lifting everyone's spirits. Tom and Ned began preparing the balloon, closely watched by the Mexicans. Tom had a unique gas-making method that allowed for a smaller balloon size. Once the balloon was ready, Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon took a test flight, astonishing the Mexicans with their airship. They then spent busy days stocking supplies for their journey to find the ruined temple. Tom paid off Delazes and his group, instructing them to wait in camp. With everything set, Tom signaled for everyone to board the balloon, marking the beginning of their adventure.|"[""1.

In an hour, Tom realized his balloon would no longer be visible to the Mexicans. He then steered west, flying low to use trees as cover while maintaining good speed. Tom and his friends were en route to the city of gold, sailing for three days over vast plains and dense jungles impassable by ox carts. They crossed rivers, halting each night with the airship secured to trees. Tom efficiently managed the lifting gas on board, minimizing wastage during descents. Despite challenges like rain and strong winds, they persevered westward. Meals were prepared in the tiny kitchen, and they scanned below for a plain with a ruined temple. After a week of searching, they spotted a vast plateau with a white stone temple ruin at sunset. As they landed near the ancient structure, Tom marveled at its immense size and ancient history, speculating about the lost city of Poltec that once surrounded it.|['1.

Eradicate and his friends were on a mission to find a tunnel entrance inside an old temple. Despite the bats flying out, they were determined to locate it before breakfast. They searched the temple's interior, which was in ruins, with fallen roofs and gaping holes. The temple had two circular buildings, one within the other, with living quarters for priests. Inside, they found a vast room with stone altars and statues, hinting at past worship activities. However, after days of searching the temple's perimeter, they couldn't find the tunnel entrance. It wasn't until they realized it might be inside the temple's central chamber that their search strategy changed. The group decided to explore the inner chamber next, hoping to finally discover the hidden tunnel entrance.|"[""1.

Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and Eradicate ventured into the ruins without breakfast to explore. Navigating the debris to reach the inner chamber was challenging. The sacrificial chamber was solid, but disappointment struck as they found no tunnel. Upon closer inspection, Tom noticed a bundle on the altar. To their surprise, the altar moved, revealing a dark hole with steps leading down. Cautiously peering into the abyss, they hesitated to descend due to safety concerns. The odd man warned of potential dangers and advised waiting for clearer air. Tom suggested returning with electric flash lamps before descending. As they left the temple, the group felt relieved yet alert, wary of encountering others in the desolate ruins.|['1.

The boys were well-prepared for exploring the dark tunnel with their electric lamps. Tom had a special lamp with tungsten filaments that provided a powerful light, and they had batteries that were designed to last a long time. They made sure the lamps were charged and ready before heading back to the opening to check the air. Tom tested the air by dropping a match down, which burned clearly. As they descended into the unknown darkness, their bright lights illuminated stone walls and steps, creating an eerie atmosphere. Suddenly, they encountered a stream rushing between two stone walls, filling the tunnel with a roaring sound.

Ned and Tom faced a daunting river blocking their path to the city of gold. Tom suggested building a bridge, but the challenges seemed insurmountable. Ned, however, noticed the river flowed along smooth stone banks as if it were a man-made canal. Tom realized the river could be controlled by a mechanism like the altar they had seen. They set out to find a lever or handle to divert the water. With determination, they searched for the valve that could change their fate and lead them to the legendary city of gold.|['1.

Everyone felt relieved now that there was a way to solve the problem. They eagerly used their lamps to search for a way to stop the water in the tunnel. Initially, they were worried that Ned's theory might not work. The walls were smooth everywhere, including near the river's edge. Rushing to Ned, they found a black stone in a niche, similar to where he found the golden image. Tom examined it and declared that the water was about twenty feet deep. They drained the water, revealing a cave with golden streets and statues. Excited by the wealth, they decided to take some gold, statues, and move their balloon to the temple for safety. They planned to return with better lighting to explore further and collect gold before potential dangers arose.|"['1.

In the underground city of gold, the group ventured deeper, surrounded by the precious metal. The golden structures weren't just practical but also ornate, indicating a focus on beauty. The city's layout was organized with straight streets paved with gold plates. Golden statues adorned every corner, possibly representing deities or revered figures. The houses held solid gold utensils, likely used in rituals. The group couldn't explore fully but gathered gold items and statues to bring back.

Tom and Ned revisited the underground river but found it dry. They discovered a mechanism that controlled the flow of water. Tom suggested using it to hide the entrance to the underground city in case they needed to escape. They built gas torches from empty food tins to explore the city. They planned to bring back gold and hide their airship. While exploring, they found a golden statue in the central plaza. Tom decided to take the head as a relic. They marveled at the city's beauty and richness in gold. Tom's quick thinking and resourcefulness helped them navigate the underground city safely.|"['1.

Tom and his companions decided to take down the golden statue that stood in the underground city. They pulled it down with a rope, revealing that it was hollow and fake. Tom then chopped off the head, which resulted in a booming noise throughout the city. As they tried to leave, they discovered that a massive stone blocked their path, trapping them in the underground city of gold. Tom's voice trembled as he revealed the situation to the others. They were now stuck in the city with no way out.|"['1.

"""We need to find another way out,"" Mr. Damon said as they returned to the fallen gold statue. Tom looked back at the barrier that trapped them in the city of gold. Tom managed to climb up to the flat area where the statue stood, but it was smooth like a billiard table. He realized the statue's weight had shifted, causing the stone to fall, and there was no way to reset it. Ned suggested looking for a mechanism at the stone gate to raise the slab. Tom hoped for another exit and they explored the vast underground city. The city resembled an overturned bowl with solid stone walls blocking any escape. Despite finding food made of gold, they longed for freedom. Mr. Damon speculated they might be the first in thousands of years to set foot in the abandoned city."|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Ned suggest to help them escape the city of gold?\nA) Climbing up the smooth statue\nB) Finding food made of gold\nC) Searching for a mechanism at the stone gate\nD) Resetting the fallen gold statue\nE) Exploring the vast underground city', ""Question 2:\nWhat did Tom realize about the fallen gold statue?\nA) It was made of billiard table material\nB) It had shifted in weight\nC) It was impossible to climb\nD) It was the only way out of the city\nE) It was blocking the underground city's entrance"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did the city of gold resemble according to the text?\nA) A billiard table\nB) An overturned bowl\nC) A vast underground maze\nD) A golden statue\nE) A smooth stone gate', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Mr. Damon speculate about their situation in the abandoned city?\nA) They were trapped forever\nB) They were the first visitors in thousands of years\nC) They were in a city of gold\nD) They were lost in a maze\nE) They were surrounded by solid stone walls', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Tom hope for as they explored the underground city?\nA) Finding more gold statues\nB) Finding a way to reset the fallen statue\nC) Finding a mechanism to raise the stone slab\nD) Finding food made of gold\nE) Finding another exit', 'Question 6:\nWhat did the group long for despite finding food made of gold?\nA) More gold statues\nB) A way to reset the fallen statue\nC) Freedom\nD) A mechanism to raise the stone slab\nE) Another exit']"|['C) Searching for a mechanism at the stone gate', 'B) It had shifted in weight', 'B) An overturned bowl', 'B) They were the first visitors in thousands of years', 'E) Finding another exit', 'C) Freedom']
"While the man of color was away, Tom, Ned, and Mr. Damon returned to the stone gate. They realized attacking it without proper tools or blasting powder would be futile, but their situation was dire, and action was necessary. ""Let's try chipping away at the base of the stone,"" suggested Tom. ""It's not very hard rock, more like soft marble or sandstone. We might be able to create a passage under the slab door with our knives."" Suddenly, Tom had an idea. ""We should focus on cutting through the stone slab itself. It can't be too thick. I'll use the gas torches to heat the stone, making it brittle and easier to break."" Despite their efforts, progress was slow. With dwindling supplies, they rationed food and water, surviving on meager portions. Days passed in a grueling cycle of stone-cutting, sparse meals, and restless sleep. Water became scarce, but they found a trickle that kept them alive. As hope waned, they continued to search for an escape from their golden prison, but the days blurred together in a desperate struggle for survival. After about eight days, their provisions were depleted, and they could barely continue their efforts against the stone barrier. With revolvers drawn, they stood ready on the brink of a revelation, uncertain if what lay beyond would bring salvation or further despair."|['**1.

Slowly, the heavy stone gate rose, revealing Andy Foger and his group on the other side. Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and Eradicate found themselves facing a horde of wild-looking men. Tom quickly realized they needed to fight to survive. As the tension rose, Tom raised his revolver, ready to defend themselves. A savage threw a spear towards Tom, but Mr. Damon pulled him out of harm's way just in time. Tom fired back, causing one of the attackers to cry out in pain. The group hurried through the gateway, with their pursuers close behind. Ned's fading electric torch provided minimal light as they navigated the dark tunnel. The echoing shouts and war-cries of the head-hunters fueled their escape. Despite the danger, Tom resisted the urge to flood the tunnel, unwilling to condemn even their enemies to such a fate.|"['1.

Mr. Foger and Andy, who were at the back of the group, had just come out of the hole near the large stone altar when suddenly a tall column of water shot out from the same spot. Everyone was amazed at this strange sight. A geyser was now erupting right in the middle of the temple floor, causing the head-hunters, Mexicans, and Fogers to run away in fear. Tom realized that the underground river was flowing in the wrong direction, flooding the tunnel and the underground city. The group narrowly escaped with their lives and the city of gold was lost forever. Despite finding some gold, it was mixed with other metals. Eventually, they returned home safely, reflecting on their incredible adventure.|['1.
