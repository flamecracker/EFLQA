"Tom spent many late nights planning and refining his new explosive, which he named ""Swiftite"" after his father. After weeks of work, he designed a safe gun on paper. The gun's construction involved digging a deep hole in the earth as long as the gun would be. A core of asbestos and concrete was placed in the center, and molten steel was poured around it. The steel would be reinforced with sleeves, wire windings, and more jackets to make the gun strong. Finally, the molten steel was poured into the hole, creating a series of explosions as the air bubbles burst. The manager ensured only the necessary workers were present during the casting.

Tom had big plans for his giant cannon, but for now, he needed to test it. The gun had been moved to a remote area in New York State for safety. Tom and his friends eagerly waited for a break in the rainy weather to secure the gun on its carriage and fire the projectiles. The gun was aimed up a valley towards a mountain, ensuring no harm. Tom planned to fire different types of cannonballs to test the range. By adjusting the gun's elevation, he estimated a maximum range of thirty miles. The test location was deserted, with a dam at one end and a village at the other. The valley was desolate, with wooded areas and a large hill dividing it.|"['1.

Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, Koku, and some steel company workers rented an empty farmhouse near the gun mounting site. They stayed there while Tom oversaw the work. When the rain eased, Tom and Ned, wearing raincoats, checked on the progress. The steel workers were strengthening the gun and preparing to dynamite it. The foreman assured Tom that they were safe on the hillside even if the dam burst. Tom mentioned he had extra supplies in the village. He expressed his eagerness to fly his airship but was held back by the rain. Tom confirmed that the gun was ready for a test shot the next day.

Some high-ranking officials in the government had gathered at Colon in anticipation of a test that had garnered more attention than expected, delighting Tom but also making him a bit nervous. Plans were in place for a ship to be stationed near the firing zone to relay information about each shot's characteristics, distance, and proximity to the target via wireless. Tom meticulously inspected the gun, made minor adjustments, and prepared for the final trials. On a platform nearby, the ordnance board, invited guests, officers, workers, and foreign representatives had assembled. Tom explained the gun's operation modestly, answered questions, and fired the first shot with a practice charge, stunning many with its range of over fourteen thousand yards. Tom, confident in his invention, loaded a heavier shell for another shot, causing a deafening report and impressive results, leaving the audience in awe.|"[""1.

Cannon shots follow a curved path known as a trajectory due to the forces acting upon them. The upward curve is caused by the force of the powder, while the downward curve is due to gravity. Without these forces, projectiles would travel in straight lines. Elevating the cannon is necessary to ensure the shot reaches its target. During an experiment, a young inventor faced nerves but proceeded with a heavy charge. The blast caused a commotion, with the gun recoiling from the shock. Amidst the chaos, a wireless operator received a message as a projectile shot through the air. A sudden disturbance arose as a man rushed out in distress, followed by a German officer, leading to a mysterious turn of events.|"['1.
