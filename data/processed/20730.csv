Eight girls, including Ulyth, gathered brushwood and built a bonfire. The chief lit the fire, casting a scarlet glow. The scene was picturesque, with tree trunks like ancient temple pillars and a cascade of white water nearby. The harvest moon rose as an owl hooted.

Merle expressed her delight at attending the party in Porth Powys, favoring it over Pontvoelas and Aberceiriog for its lively atmosphere and superior blackberries. Despite being the last to sign up, she felt lucky. Ulyth agreed, having signed up first while rushing to her music lesson. The girls, carrying baskets, began their journey up a narrow path beside a stream in the glen. Some paused to pick blackberries, but Miss Moseley urged them to move on to a more fruitful spot near a ruined cottage. Following her lead, they climbed over a stile, crossed a wooden bridge, and ascended a steep track to reach a hilltop overlooking the Craigwen Valley.

In the Craigwen Valley during winter, the weather was mild, unlike the frosty conditions expected. Snow only capped the mountain peaks, leaving the lower areas snow-free. By January, The Woodlands garden bloomed with snowdrops, polyanthus, and jessamine, defying the winter chill. The glade by the stream remained untouched by winter, with green ferns, moss, and evergreen foliage. The glen's beauty shone through the alders' bare branches, displaying shades of purple, grey, and amber. Rain occasionally flooded the valley, creating stunning cloud effects and swelling the river.

At this moment, Winnie and Hattie were holding onto Rona's arms, enjoying her company but also wanting to take a shortcut. Rona suggested cutting through the fields to save time.

As Rona diverted their attention, they swiftly crossed a gate and scaled a wall, finding themselves in a gorse-covered pasture.

The sturdy pole across the stream had its advantages. Firmly anchored on both banks, it provided stability and grip with its bark-covered surface. Rona cautiously made her way across, inch by inch, until she triumphantly reached the far side. Despite a moment of imbalance, she safely reached out to her waiting friend. Winnie, initially scared, followed suit until a sudden cow's moo startled her, causing a splash into the water. Meanwhile, Rona shared her plans to send flowers home, feeling the pang of loneliness.

The spring season at The Woodlands was a time of beauty and freedom. March winds carried away the violets but left behind Lent lilies and primroses. The larch forest was a green tangle, the hedgerows bloomed with blackthorn, and the _Pyrus japonica_ tree outside the dining room window was covered in pink blossoms. With longer days came rambles and more time outdoors. Rona had invitations for Easter, but Ulyth was relieved when Miss Bowes decided she should spend the holidays with Winnie Fowler instead. Ulyth cherished the time with her mother and felt grateful for their close bond. After the Easter break, everyone returned to The Woodlands ready to enjoy the term. The girls took advantage of the warmer weather, spending time outdoors in the glade by the stream. Bathing was allowed, and the girls eagerly participated in morning swims and runs.

Upon reaching the plateau beyond Cwm Dinas, progress became smoother, though still uphill. They traversed the open moors, following a faint sheep track under the crag of Glyder Garmon. Apart from sporadic whitewashed farms, they were far from human dwellings. The only signs of life were the agile Welsh sheep, half-wild ponies grazing in the summer, and a pair of carrion crows. Trekking over vast stretches of grass and whinberry bushes, they eventually caught sight of the distant Llyn Gwynedd, their campsite. The group's spirits lifted upon spotting the tents from afar. After a brisk walk, they arrived at the lake, where they announced their arrival with cheers. The camping ground, carefully selected on the lake's far side, was shielded by mountain ridges and had a pristine water source. The girls quickly settled into camp life, with Mrs. Arnold taking charge as the leader. Each member had assigned duties, from cooks to sentries. The evening by the lake was magical, with the sun setting behind the peaks, and the girls exploring the vicinity under the watchful eyes of their Torch-bearers. The night concluded with a ceremonial gathering, songs, stories, and cocoa-making. The camp was a buzz of activities but maintained strict discipline, with sentries posted for security.

The lights flashed towards the kitchen, and the girls were determined. They were ready to confront the intruder, capture him, and demand an explanation. They felt confident in their ability to apprehend him and tie him up if necessary, especially if he was a burglar. The news spread quickly, creating a sense of excitement and anticipation.

After the show ended, everyone went for a walk around the lake while dinner cooked. Only the cooks stayed behind, keeping a close eye on their pots. Ulyth, Rona, Lizzie, and Gertrude strolled past the farm and up the hill to a crag with a stunning view of the water below. Lizzie shared a tragic story about Lord Glyncraig's eldest son, who had a fishing accident. Despite the sad tale, the group decided to head back to the lake's edge to search for wildflowers. Dinner was served promptly, and everyone praised the cooks and servers for their efficiency. Mrs. Arnold, an avid angler, planned to fish that afternoon and enlisted the help of Kathleen, Ruth, Gladys, and Evie to row the boat.

Mrs. Arnold and Miss Bowes went for fresh clothes. The girls had to rest while servers dried their clothes by a bonfire. They sipped cocoa, propped up with pillows.

Rona sat on her bed and began her story. She revealed that her father was seen as the black sheep of the family and was sent away to the colonies in disgrace. In Melbourne, he met and married a talented opera singer, which angered Rona's grandfather. After her mother's passing, Rona's father moved to New Zealand to start farming. Rona was left in the care of Mrs. Barker, who was not ideal but the only option in their remote location. One day, when Rona was alone, her grandfather and his new wife arrived unexpectedly. Scared by strangers, Rona locked them out, unaware of their identity. Her grandfather, discouraged by the reception, left without meeting her father.
