On Sunday mornings in the summer, I draw back the curtain to see the sunrise on a steeple across from my window. The weathercock gleams first, then the spire, and the tower starts to shine. As the sun moves, the whole steeple lights up. The church seems alive, with a spirit of calm and reflection. The steeple stands tall, like a giant overseeing the town, reminding everyone of their daily lives. On weekdays, the church stands lonely, disconnected from the bustling town below. But on Sundays, it comes alive with worshippers and children heading to Sunday school. The sunlight on Sundays feels special, marking a day of peace and reflection away from the usual noise and business.|['1.

About fifteen minutes before the bell rings for the second time, members of the congregation start to arrive. The first to appear is usually an elderly woman dressed in black, her hunched figure suggesting a heavy burden she seeks to lay at the altar. One can't help but wish the Sabbath came more frequently for her sake. Alongside her is an older man who arrives early, standing with a somber expression near the tower. Surprisingly, the old woman seems to carry a lighter heart. Others gradually join, entering the church or gathering nearby. Suddenly, the bell in the steeple rings, signaling the start of the service. The street fills with people converging towards the church, a mix of wealthy and humble worshippers. Despite their colorful attire, once inside, earthly distinctions vanish. The minister, in simple attire, exudes reverence, though not warmth. As the congregation settles in for prayer, a sense of missed opportunities tugs at the observer, prompting reflections on prayer and connection with the divine.|['1.

From my window, I hear the hymn echoing from afar. The music, distant yet powerful, touches my soul more deeply than if I were inside the church. I lack knowledge of music theory, but the simple melodies resonate with me. As the music fades, my mind lingers on its echoes until I snap back to reality, realizing the sermon has begun. I often struggle to focus on spoken sermons, finding printed ones more engaging. The preacher's words spark thoughts that lead me on mental journeys. I am content by the open window, catching snippets of the sermon like breadcrumbs. The fragments of this service will inspire many reflections, guided by my Mind and Heart, who preach to me in their unique ways. Later, as the afternoon service ends, the congregation exits the church, bringing life to the once-quiet street. Couples stroll home, young ones arrange evening walks, and the Sabbath eve fills with the promise of love.|"[""1.
