In penning this story, my aim was to delight my young audience and offer them a genuine glimpse of present-day life at sea, contrasting it with the past. I also sought to introduce the boys and girls to the wonders of the oceanic realms, often foreign to us. The boys encounter new and fascinating elements like exotic fruits, flowers, and animals, requiring their resourcefulness to navigate challenges and ensure their well-being. The scene unfolds on a bright spring day in San Francisco, where the Rover boys, led by Dick, with Tom and Sam in tow, embark on a carriage tour, reveling in the city's sights. The trio, sons of Anderson Rover, have braved numerous escapades, from Putnam Hall Academy to African jungles, and even a quest for buried treasure. As they journey westward, the prospect of reuniting with friends and uncovering new adventures beckons, setting the stage for their next thrilling chapter.|"[""1.

The morning flew by, and by noon, they reached a quaint harbor on an island for a picnic-style lunch. After packing up at one o'clock, they set sail on the Old Glory towards the west, eager for an ocean adventure.

"The Old Glory yacht sailed bravely through the storm, battling wind and rain. Captain Jerry steered with all his might as the boys clung to the rail. Suddenly, a loud hum filled the air, followed by a crash as the mast began to fall. In a frantic effort, the boys worked to clear the wreckage. With the danger still looming, they fought to keep the yacht afloat against the raging waves. As night fell, lanterns were lit to guide them through the dense fog.

The wind picked up, and the girls sought shelter in the cabin to stay dry. Meanwhile, the boys hoisted a flag upside down on a plank, eagerly awaiting the steamer's approach. Tom and Sam took the wheel, while old Jerry and Dick checked for leaks. They discovered two open seams at the bow and a stern break that would soon affect the rudder. As the steamer neared, the Old Glory showed signs of sinking, prompting everyone to don life preservers. The small boat rescued Sam and Tom, then retrieved Dick and Captain Jerry. Once aboard the tramp steamer, Captain Fairleigh offered dry clothes and a warm meal. The group learned they were bound for Honolulu, with a chance to sail to San Francisco in a week.

A fierce storm hit the Tacoma one night, making it impossible to stand on deck. The boys and girls gathered in the cabin, holding on to the posts and seats. Thunder, lightning, and heavy rain added to the chaos. The storm worsened, throwing the boys to the floor as the ship seemed to collide with something. Panic ensued as cries filled the air. Efforts to launch a lifeboat failed, and a nearby schooner showed damage from the storm. Together, the group prepared for the worst, donning life preservers.

Tired from their recent experiences, the boys fell into a deep sleep on the ship, unconcerned about their whereabouts. With everyone occupied with the ship's wreckage, they were left mostly to themselves. Captain Blossom had two reasons for not dropping them off near Honolulu - it would take time and could lead to inquiries about the steamer incident. Reluctantly, the boys and old Jerry were assigned to work with the crew in the forecastle. Despite the sailors being fairly clean, the boys were unhappy about being separated from the girls. While working, Sam noticed a familiar face - the young man was none other than Dan Baxter, a troublemaker who had stolen from them in San Francisco.

The funds were missing, most handed to Captain Blossom for Baxter's trip to Australia, the rest spent before departure. The wallet held only two hundred and thirty dollars. Captain Blossom accused, offering a choice: sign on as a sailor or face imprisonment. The group negotiated, agreeing to pay a portion now and the rest later.

Tom couldn't sleep, so he decided to go up on deck for some fresh air. As he leaned over the rail, watching the waves, Dan Baxter, a bully on the ship, noticed him. Baxter attacked Tom, hitting him until Tom was partly dazed and pushed against the weak rail. The rail broke, and Tom fell overboard. Luckily, a rope had fallen overboard and Tom grabbed onto it, getting entangled in the rudder chain. With the help of a rope ladder and Dick, Tom was rescued and brought back safely to the ship.

The captain had promised to lock Baxter in the ship's jail, and he kept his word. Surprisingly, the bully, Lesher, received better treatment than expected. A peculiar friendship developed between Lesher and the first mate. Lesher hinted at a possible partnership with Baxter once they reached Australia, hoping to exploit Baxter's wealthy relative. Despite this, the days passed calmly until disaster struck. The ship suffered damages, leading to chaos on deck.

"""The captain is missing!"" cried Dora, her voice barely heard over the crashing waves as the ship hit the rocks. The boys and old Jerry kept rowing, unsure of what to do. Eventually, they left the dangerous spot and found themselves on the vast Pacific Ocean in darkness, with only the sounds of the wind and waves around them. Luckily, they had some dry clothes and warm water. As the sun rose, they ate and drank sparingly, then rowed southward guided by the sun. By noon, they estimated they had traveled six to eight miles. As the day wore on, fatigue set in, and the girls rested while the boys rowed. The night brought a peaceful moonlit sky, with the Southern Cross shining brightly. With old Jerry's guidance, they rode the waves safely to shore, where they rested and discussed their situation on the tropical coast."""|"[""1.

Tom's suggestion was followed, and everyone settled in comfortably given the circumstances. They had matches in a waterproof container, so they started a campfire to dry their clothes. After eating some remaining provisions, they rested without disturbance until sunrise. Upon waking, the girls found the boys and Captain Jerry preparing breakfast. Tom had gathered oysters and shellfish, which were being cooked. They had a bit of tea and coffee, with the captain brewing a pot that smelled delightful. Sam brought down coconuts and ripe bananas. Captain Jerry and Dick then set out armed with ship biscuits and sticks. They faced challenges climbing the hill but surveyed the area from the top. Suddenly, Dick encountered a snake, but with Captain Jerry's swift action, they managed to defeat it.|"[""1.

"""Yes, that's the best side,"" stated Captain Jerry. ""Building here could be risky during a strong storm. The other side is more sheltered and safer. Additionally, there is more fruit and better fishing in the bay, which is important."" The group had been successful in hunting and fishing, cooking their food over a campfire.

The ship had survived the storm with only minor damage. Old Jerry found that cargo had wedged into a hole, preventing the ship from sinking. Stranded on an island, provisions from the ship would last a year. They built a raft to transport supplies to shore. The crew was relieved to see each other safe and planned a feast to celebrate. The captain was grateful for the company, and they were thankful the ship had not sunk.

Tom and Sam were stranded on a raft after a shipwreck. Sam fell overboard but was saved from a shark by Tom's brave actions. Together, they salvaged supplies from the wreck to build a comfortable shelter on the shore. They planned to construct separate rooms for the girls and boys, a common living area, and a storehouse for provisions. They also raised a distress flag on a hilltop for potential rescuers to see. On Sunday, they held religious services led by Captain Blossom. As the days passed, they worked hard to establish their new home, utilizing the resources from the ship and the surrounding area.

Building the house was quite challenging, but the Rover boys found it more enjoyable than laborious, especially with the girls watching. By the end of the second week, the house looked quite nice. They finished two bedrooms and brought over berths, bedclothes, and furniture from the wreck. They also built a large porch outside for dining and relaxing on fine days. To avoid fire risks in high winds, cooking would be done in a shed away from the house, close to the rocks and spring. They decided to take turns cooking and doing housework so the men could hunt, fish, and garden. The exploring party consisted of Captain Blossom, Sam, and Tom, while Dick and old Jerry stayed with the girls. They took a rowboat and provisions for a week, each carrying a pistol, with the captain also having a rifle. They planned to return in four days, using three shots fired as a signal if they were in trouble.|['1.

On the island, they discovered many large land crabs and fierce spiders with hairy legs and bulging eyes. There were numerous ants and fifteen anthills as big as beehives in one spot. Insects of all kinds buzzed around, including a bothersome red fly they had to keep swatting away. Suddenly, a ferocious beast leaped into view, causing the captain and the boys to ready their weapons, but the creature vanished before they could shoot. The captain warned them about the danger of gorillas in the area. As they made their way back to the seashore, they spotted four goats on a hill. They decided to try and shoot two of them for food. After a tiring walk, they reached the boat. Meanwhile, the girls were busy with cooking, washing, and sewing. Later, Dick and Jerry set out for the wreck to gather tools for house-building. Dora encountered Dan Baxter and Jack Lesher, who had been stranded on the island and had a rough time surviving. The girls were wary of the newcomers and listened to their story cautiously.|['Question 1: What did the captain warn them about in the area?\nA) Gorillas\nB) Spiders\nC) Ants\nD) Goats\nE) Bees', 'Question 2: What did the captain and the boys do when a ferocious beast leaped into view?\nA) They shot at it immediately\nB) They ran away in fear\nC) They readied their weapons\nD) They called for help\nE) They tried to capture it alive', 'Question 3: What did the girls do while the boys were exploring the island?\nA) Fishing\nB) Hunting\nC) Cooking, washing, and sewing\nD) Building a shelter\nE) Swimming', 'Question 4: What did the boys decide to shoot for food on the island?\nA) Spiders\nB) Ants\nC) Goats\nD) Gorillas\nE) Bees', 'Question 5: Who did Dora encounter on the island?\nA) The captain\nB) Dick and Jerry\nC) Dan Baxter and Jack Lesher\nD) The girls\nE) The goats', 'Question 6: How did the girls react to the newcomers on the island?\nA) They welcomed them with open arms\nB) They were cautious and wary\nC) They ignored them\nD) They ran away\nE) They asked for their help']|['A) Gorillas', 'C) They readied their weapons', 'C) Cooking, washing, and sewing', 'C) Goats', 'C) Dan Baxter and Jack Lesher', 'B) They were cautious and wary']
Captain Blossom, old Jerry Tolman, and the three Rover boys were split into two groups. Old Jerry and Dick went to the wreck on an errand while the others explored the seven islands. Lesher, feeling comfortable, settled into a hammock with a bottle of liquor. Despite the girls' discomfort, Dan Baxter defended Lesher's actions, explaining their rough living conditions. As they unpacked items from the wreck, they found a large block of ice for lemonade and orange ice. However, Baxter and Lesher's arrival disrupted the peace. A scuffle ensued between Dick and Baxter, ending with Dick defending himself. The next morning, Baxter stirred first, tending to his cuts. He confided in Lesher about the others' intentions and the need to rely on the sailors for support. Lesher asserted his authority, demanding obedience from old Jerry for the liquor, hinting at potential mutiny.|"['1.

Lesher and Baxter locked Dick and Jerry in the brig. They left them with some food and water. The group was tense as they explored the wreck. Lesher's violent actions caused chaos.

"Tom shouted, ""We are going over!"" The wind swiftly carried his words away. A huge wave hit, flipping the rowboat over, plunging all three into the bay. ""Help! Help!"" Sam yelled as he surfaced. ""Our boat is sinking. Help!"" Tom echoed the cry. Clinging to the overturned boat, they found it wouldn't support them. As they reached shallower waters, they rushed ashore, nearly colliding with the girls. After changing into dry clothes, they listened to Baxter and the girls. The captain was relieved to hear many sailors were saved and asked for names. Baxter struggled to explain his actions, realizing his plan had failed due to the storm.

One night, it was Dick's turn to guard the open doorway of the house. Around 2 a.m., the moon vanished, and the stars hid behind clouds. The night was calm, except for insects buzzing in the jungle and the gentle waves on the beach. Suddenly, Dick spotted a dark figure creeping close to the ground near the bay. Unsure if it was real or a shadow, he grabbed his gun and stepped outside. As the figure circled back towards the house, a low growl revealed it was a wild animal preparing to attack. Captain Blossom arrived with a shotgun, firing the shot that brought down the beast. It measured five feet, had sharp teeth, and a menacing look.

A campfire was lit, and all except Jerry went to bed, agreeing that the old sailor would join them for breakfast. Everyone slept well except Dick, the eldest Rover, who still felt rested. The next morning, they skinned the wild animal, a challenging task for those inexperienced in hunting. Old Jerry attempted to cook a steak from the animal but found it too tough. They disposed of the carcass in a hole between rocks. After breakfast, they worked hard to move supplies from the beach to the cave, including water, torches, matches, and weapons. By sunset, the work was done, and they returned to the house, waiting for Baxter, Lesher, and their group. The next day, the captain, Dick, and Jerry rowed to the wreck, encountering two exhausted sailors. The sailors shared how the mate had taken control of those left on the ship.|"['1.

Most of the sailors became furious with the talk that was going on. Lesher convinced them to stick with him no matter what and not let Captain Blossom rule over them. He offered them unlimited liquor and the chance to claim they found the wreck abandoned for a better salvage share. Lesher even distributed liquor and weapons to seal the deal. Marny and Gibson didn't agree but were overruled. They were given pistols and extra clothing but kept silent to avoid confrontation. Captain Blossom worried about potential conflict if the sailors approached while intoxicated. A fire broke out on the ship, likely caused by a drunk crew member dropping a lantern. The ship burned down, leaving the crew stranded without tools to build a raft.|['1.

Tom expressed his willingness to help those in need, especially if Lesher and Baxter were involved. After much discussion, it was decided that Dick, Tom, and old Jerry would take a rowboat with supplies to investigate the situation near the fire. They approached stealthily, wrapping the oars to move quietly. Armed with medicine and pistols, they cautiously navigated through the bushes towards the wreck. They found a burnt and deserted scene. Bostwick, injured and in pain, revealed that Lesher and Baxter accused them of starting the fire and threatened retaliation. The trio quickly rescued Bostwick and rowed back under the cover of darkness, witnessing a flash of fire and hearing gunshots from the shore.|"[""1.
