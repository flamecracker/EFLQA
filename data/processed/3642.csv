"Jan and Marie stood tall when their mother commanded them. Together, they marched towards the city gate to the tune of ""Le Roi, la loi, la liberte."" Mother Van Hove hummed the melody softly. The journey back to the farm was tiring, and upon their return, the animals greeted them with protests. Bel mooed, the pig squealed, the rooster crowed, and faithful Fidel guarded the door. Mother Van Hove swiftly prepared breakfast for the twins - bread and milk. She tended to the animals, milking the cow and feeding them. Exhausted, they all retired early. The next day, Jan and Marie woke to find their mother missing. They decided to surprise her by preparing breakfast. Jan took charge of feeding the pig and hitching Pier to the cart, eager to finish the wheat harvest. Marie, on the other hand, started the morning chores by boiling water and setting the table.

The bells rang as Mother Van Hove stood proudly at her home's threshold, singing about the Lion of Flanders. Days passed in Meer, filled with work in the garden and caring for the animals.

The people quietly entered the small church, dimly lit by candles on the altar, and knelt on the hard floor. The priest left to don his robes, returning to lead them in prayer. That night, Mother Van Hove gave her children a locket each, with a message of hope and bravery. She emphasized their Belgian identity and the importance of courage. The children, comforted, went to bed. Mother Van Hove, unsettled by distant sounds of war, prepared for the day ahead.

As the invaders approached, Mother Van Hove hurriedly hid Jan and Marie in the earth-covered vegetable cellar, instructing them to remain silent. She closed the door from the outside, concealing their presence with straw-covered milk-pans. The village was soon engulfed in the enemy's march, but the children, along with their loyal dog Fidel, stayed hidden in the darkness. After what felt like an eternity, the sounds of the invaders faded, and Jan cautiously peeked out, causing a clatter. Fidel then burst out joyfully into the sunlight, signaling it was safe. The children emerged cautiously, finding the farmyard marked by the invaders' presence. With their mother missing, Jan remembered the priest's advice to seek refuge in the church. They raced through the deserted village, only to find the church empty. Alone and scared, they clung to each other, comforted by Fidel's presence.|"['1.

"""Do you recall what Mother said when she gave me this locket, Jan?"" she inquired. ""She promised to find us, even if she had to cross the sea! She told us to never lose hope, yet here we are feeling hopeless."" The siblings discovered the invaders had ransacked their home, taking not just the grain but also the food from the cupboard. With only a meager breakfast, they embarked on a journey with uncertainty. Carrying essentials in a bundle, they headed toward Malines, avoiding the devastation caused by the war.

When the cathedral bells rang early for mass the next morning, the children were still fast asleep from exhaustion. It wasn't until the bells stopped and the door from the sacristy creaked open near them that Fidel, their loyal dog, growled softly, jolting Jan and Marie awake with a bump. Confused and fearful, the children sat up rubbing their heads, staying silent as Fidel calmed down. As a tall priestly figure entered, the children stayed hidden behind the railing, watching him conduct the mass. When the priest passed them, they felt a sense of loneliness and yearned for help. As the service ended, the children fled the cathedral and faced the harsh reality of German soldiers in the square.

Jan and Marie were running for their lives through the war-torn streets of the city. As they turned a corner, a young soldier named Fidel, who was furious, almost caught up with them. However, the children were too quick, and he couldn't keep up. Meanwhile, the children encountered a burning section of the city, blocking their escape. Desperate and hungry, they stumbled upon a familiar street that led to the Antwerp gate. Remembering their father marching away with soldiers, Jan pointed to the gate, suggesting it as their escape route.
