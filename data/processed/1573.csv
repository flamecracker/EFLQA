The Town Hall in Rossville is situated on a small hill, overlooking the main street. It's usually open for town meetings or special events like lectures on various topics. Because Rossville is too small for regular lectures, the townspeople rely on these occasional gatherings for intellectual stimulation. The majority of residents are farmers, so the town is spread out, with houses scattered around. One Wednesday afternoon in September 1862, a group of men and boys gathered at the Town Hall in response to a call for a meeting to discuss raising twenty-five men for the war effort. The meeting attracted a hundred and fifty people who engaged in discussions about the war and criticized the administration. One man, Mr. Holman, expressed his opinions strongly but declined to volunteer, claiming he could manage the war better than the current leaders. Another attendee suggested that if Mr. Holman had a clear plan, he should share it with the authorities. The meeting concluded with the need for a clerk to assist in organizing further proceedings.|['1.

A short distance across from the Town Hall stood the Rossville Academy, led by the knowledgeable James Rathburn, A. M. who was both a scholar and a skilled teacher. He made learning engaging for his students, with three Latin language classes. Among them, one class was delving into the Aeneid of Virgil, preparing for college. Frank Frost, our main character, was a fine-looking boy of sixteen, diligent in his studies. In contrast, John Haynes, the son of Squire Haynes, was more concerned with flaunting his wealth and status. Alongside them was Henry Tufts, a respectful student with a mild demeanor. Despite financial challenges, Frank aimed for a college education, showing remarkable scholarship.

The father and son sat together in their humble living room, surrounded by simple furniture and a warm kerosene lamp.

The teacher commended Frank for his courage and self-denial in practicing his right ideas of duty. Despite facing insults from John Haynes, Frank remained undisturbed, focusing on his studies.

Frank had not been lazy. He had worked with his father on the farm, learning about farming practically. He was a quick learner and now felt motivated to prepare for his new responsibilities. His main reason was to help his family after his father's departure and to prove his capabilities to those who doubted him. The time had come for Mr. Frost to leave for the army. On the last evening together, the family gathered around the fireplace. Frank sat next to his mother, already taking on the role of her advisor and protector. They felt somber realizing the impact of Mr. Frost's departure. There was uncertainty about his return due to the war. Despite feeling responsible for his father's departure, Frank thought about how it would affect their family. Charlie, the youngest, shared his innocent perspective on the situation. Mr. Frost expressed his desire for letters and newspapers while away.|"['1.

After the children went to bed, Frank and his parents stayed up late. They all knew there was much to discuss, but the impending separation weighed heavily on their minds. The idea that they would be miles apart the next day lingered, and they knew it would be a while before they were reunited. Frank's father then shared that he had put four hundred dollars in the Brandon Bank, half of which came from selling crops. He advised Frank to use it for groceries, paying Jacob, and other needs. Additionally, his father gave him fifty dollars to keep safe with his mother. This responsibility made Frank feel important and trusted. The family hardly slept, consumed by thoughts of the next day. The morning of departure was serene, with the road home passing through lush green woods under the soft October sun.

As they were almost home, a cry rang out from a small building. A young black boy dashed out, yelling that his mother had hurt herself badly. Chloe, a former slave who had escaped to Pennsylvania with her son Pomp, had burned her foot while doing laundry. Mrs. Frost, a kind woman, examined Chloe's injury and assured her it wasn't severe. She decided to take care of Chloe and Pomp until Chloe recovered. Pomp, a lively boy, was thrilled to hold the reins of the horse carriage. He jokingly mentioned how Chloe would playfully call him a little devil and hit him with her shoe. Mrs. Frost and Frank helped Chloe onto a bed, ensuring she was comfortable.

Pomp, a mischievous boy, almost caused a carriage accident by trying to run over a pig. Mrs. Frost, alarmed, refused to let Pomp drive again. Meanwhile, Frank, Mrs. Frost's son, helped with chores like milking cows and feeding animals. He also studied in his free time, missing having a teacher. One day, he saw Pomp in a scuffle, where Pomp cleverly made John, another boy, fall. John was too aggressive, forgetting fairness. Frank wished he could study better and sometimes envied his schoolmates' freedom. Despite challenges, he stayed focused on his duties, like gathering wood.|"['1.

John's cruel intentions towards Pomp were halted by Frank's intervention. Frank, standing up against John's unjust actions, prevented the abuse. Despite his lack of interest in fighting, Frank's courage and skill in wrestling gave him the upper hand. John's anger and lack of experience led to his defeat as Frank skillfully tripped him. The old farmer, disapproving of John's behavior, highlighted the inappropriateness of such brutality. Although John harbored resentment, he refrained from further violence under Mr. Maynard's watchful gaze. Frank, concerned for Pomp's safety, ensured no harm befell the young boy.

Traveling all day by rail was tiresome, with little freedom due to strict military discipline. A Canadian member of our group tried to evade service for which he enlisted by sneaking off at a station between Hartford and New Haven. He was caught and put under guard, receiving no sympathy from us. Passing through cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Washington mostly at night, we had little chance to see them. In Washington, I saw the President, a tall, thoughtful man with a shrewd and benevolent look. Our camp, known as 'Hut Village,' consists of log huts with mud-filled gaps for warmth. My hut, floored unlike most, houses six of us. I've bonded with Frank Grover, a cheerful eighteen-year-old and an only son of a widow.|"['1.

"Dear Mary,

I am practicing military drills and exercises diligently, aiming to improve rapidly. Besides my regular drills, I am receiving private lessons from my comrade Frank, who has been in the service for six months. This additional training will hopefully help me perform well in my evaluations within a month.

Writing this letter is challenging as I use my knapsack for a desk, sitting in an uncomfortable position. My comrades usually play cards for stakes, but I convinced them to stop to avoid any negative consequences. I miss you all greatly and look forward to your letters updating me on everything. Even small details will be a source of joy for us here.

Please ask Frank to send me Harper's Weekly regularly and newspapers a few times a week. The camp eagerly shares and reads every newspaper that arrives. The children, including Charlie, are writing letters to me, and I wish to share Charlie's first letter with you. Despite some spelling mistakes due to his inexperience, it's heartwarming.

Dick was unsure about the plan to help John with a pig-chase. He knew it would cause trouble for his friend Frank, who had always been kind to him. But the promise of two dollars from John, crucial for Dick's cigar habit due to his limited pocket money, convinced him to go ahead. Under the bright moon, Dick decided to wait for darker nights for the scheme. Sneaking out at eleven, he cautiously approached Mr. Frost's house.

Frank asked. ""He used a cat to avoid burning his paws. I felt terrible coming here, but the money tempted me,"" Dick admitted. Frank suspected John Haynes, the only boy with money and a possible grudge. Frank quietly began fixing the wall, realizing it's easier to cause trouble than fix it.

One day in November, a young man named Henry Morton arrived at the Wellington station with a large black trunk.

The evening passed quickly for Frank, who enjoyed his time with Mr. Morton. At half-past nine, Frank expressed his wish for Mr. Morton to stay in the village for the winter. Frank easily convinced his mother to agree to Mr. Morton's proposal. She believed he would be a pleasant addition to their family and provide valuable knowledge. Additionally, the extra income would help pay off their mortgage held by Squire Haynes. Mr. Morton planned to decorate his room with items from the city to make it cozy. He had engravings of foreign scenes, including one of a family in Rome and a unique engraving of a wagon with wine casks pulled by an ox and a donkey. This engraving intrigued Frank and added to the mystery surrounding Mr. Morton.|"['1.

Mr. Morton instructed Frank to be discreet about his employment to Squire Haynes, emphasizing health as his reason for being there. Frank, aware of the squire's animosity towards his father, expressed his discomfort with their business ties. Meanwhile, dinner was served with a perfectly cooked turkey at the center, flanked by chickens and an array of seasonal vegetables.

After six months, Tubbs had earned five thousand dollars from the profits. Despite his wealth, he felt unhappy without his family.

Later, he even became a lawmaker. During his free time, Frank studied with Mr. Morton's help. He also taught Pomp, a mischievous but bright student.

The morning of the next day was warm and pleasant, and it was hard to believe that a fierce battle was looming ahead.

One man, bitter about his past, shared his struggles of seeking education and freedom. Despite facing harsh punishments and failed escape attempts, he remained loyal to his responsibilities.

The third day was beautiful, but our anxiety overshadowed any enjoyment. The rebels were on high ground behind the town, and we had to take those heights.

We were helpless, and many of our comrades fell, including the captain and lieutenant. I thought I was doomed, but a surge of determination pushed me forward. Suddenly, a numbness in my left arm revealed a wound. A fellow soldier leaned on me as we struggled forward, only to face a wall where rebel sharpshooters attacked. Forced to retreat, we lost more comrades. Among them was the lad I had helped, struck down while uttering 'mother.'

One of the standout students in the recent school election was Dick Bumstead, who had notably turned his behavior around for the better. Previously known for avoiding work, Dick had shown a newfound dedication and work ethic that impressed his father.

On April 1st, Frank received a letter from his father after a long silence. In the letter, his father shared that he had been a prisoner of the enemy for two weeks but managed to escape. The letter detailed an incident where his father, now a sergeant, was assigned to guard a lady's estate. The lady, Mrs. Roberts, had requested protection for her property, and Frank's father sensed danger. His instincts were right as they were ambushed by rebel soldiers at Mrs. Roberts' mansion. The rebels were welcomed by Mrs. Roberts, who had orchestrated the trap. Frank's father and his men were disarmed and made captives.

Once, Mrs. Roberts passed through our dim, cramped room. I questioned her conduct, asking if it was honorable to deceive us with false promises and then hand us over to our foes. She retorted fiercely, claiming that we had no right to invade their territory. She expressed her disdain, mentioning her son held captive in a Yankee prison, vowing revenge. The next day, she falsely reported to our colonel that rebels had attacked her home and captured us. Suspicion arose, but her complicity was only confirmed upon our return to camp. We, along with a few others, endured a dismal time in captivity, with meager food and plans to be sent to Richmond. Deciding to escape before the transfer, we meticulously loosened floor planks and foundation stones, slipping away undetected on the designated night.|"['1.

I must not linger on the next day. We had to be very careful to avoid the enemy's guards. Finally, after nearly a whole day without food, we returned to camp, exhausted and hungry, much to the relief of our comrades who hadn't seen us for two weeks. Our leader quickly sent me with a group to arrest Mrs. Roberts and her daughter upon learning how we were captured. Mrs. Roberts was shocked to see me, thinking I was safe in Richmond. She remains in custody. The campaign is set to begin when the roads dry up. The mud in Virginia is a significant obstacle. I hope General Grant succeeds in capturing Vicksburg, a blow to the rebels. I've spoken with some contrabands, including a bright man who had traveled with his master. I believe slavery is on its way out, and I trust that all African Americans will soon be free.

I found the man I was searching for in Detroit. He had moved there from St. Louis and was very ill with typhoid fever. I helped him by providing better living conditions, food, and medical care. He was grateful as I possibly saved his life. He was hesitant to testify against his old boss, fearing he might be charged for hiding a crime. I assured him he wouldn't be punished if he spoke up. He agreed to testify. We are leaving Detroit soon for New England via New York. I asked for a meeting in New York on the 18th to get his confession. My goal is to clear my father's name.
