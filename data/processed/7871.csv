Once upon a time in Dutch Fairy Land, there was a young mermaid who lived near the sea with her family. Her home was a unique pool of half salt and half fresh water on an island by a river mouth. The mermaid enjoyed playing and swimming in the pool when the tides were out and frolicked when the salt water rushed in. Her family, including her father, a gray-bearded merryman, and her mother and two aunts, were all merfolk who kept their pool clean and peaceful. They welcomed well-behaved water creatures but shooed away the rude ones. The mermaids held picnics and parties on an island in the pool, adorning themselves with seaweed and sea berries.

He wore timber shoes and bell trousers, enjoying rye bread, fresh milk, boiled potatoes with butter, and cheese.

Long ago, a little princess loved to admire her reflection in the water since mirrors didn't exist. She was adored by her father, a powerful king. Despite her beauty, she could be naughty, tangling her hair and calling her nurse names. Once, she even compared her governess to a buffalo, making the maid fear she was growing horns. The nurse, tired of the princess's behavior, complained to her mother, which only made the girl act worse. The princess would play in the sand and bushes, making her hair a mess, causing her governess much frustration.

Once, a majestic aurochs charged into the forest, its aged gray mane flowing. The king readied for a battle, but the beast spoke, revealing an enchantment binding them.

Long ago, in a land where forests were cut down to make room for meadows and houses, there lived cruel men and bad people. Floods sometimes swept through, drowning cattle and covering fields with sand or saltwater, making food scarce. Families would hold councils to decide if babies should live, especially baby girls who were often left to die. If a baby was given even a drop of milk, it was allowed to live. Mothers were not allowed to feed their babies if the elders forbade it. Grandmothers ruled the household, and if a baby was not a boy, it was often met with anger. But when missionaries arrived in Friesland, families like Altfrid's embraced Christianity.

When the flood struck and the house collapsed, the baby was peacefully sleeping. The cat, leaving behind its nearly grown kittens, jumped onto the cradle, and the two drifted away together.

Once during autumn, feeling lonely, a girl wandered into the garden. The chilly winds blew, and leaves fell like a yellow carpet on the ground. As she stood there, a leaf fell into her hand, almost as if it carried a friendly message. However, despite waiting, none of the leaves whispered to her. She had never received any word from her family. The blue flower had withered, leaving behind a rough black stalk. Suddenly, a tempest howled, trees fell, and the air darkened. When the storm calmed, a handsome youth appeared, dressed in exquisite white attire. He handed her the black stalk, instructing her to plant its seed and weave the blue flowers into wealth. With his guidance, she created delicate lace. Together, they left the forest, transforming the land with flax flowers and creating prosperous cities like Courtrai and Bruges.|[]|[]
Long ago in Holland, people believed food only came from trees and bushes like berries, acorns, and honey. They didn't know about seeds or bread. The fairies felt sorry for them, so they sent a creature with tusks to show them the riches of the earth. This creature, named Gullin, could travel as fast as lightning. Fro, a fairy lord, rode Gullin and used him to help men learn to farm. Gullin also taught his sons, the wild boars, to root up the ground for planting. With the help of Fro and Gullin, the earth became fruitful with farms, gardens, and more. The fairies and elves were happy to see men learning to grow their own food.|['1.

In the past, wild boars had long, sharp tusks that could rip open animals like dogs, wolves, bulls, and bears, or plow the earth. The boars' tusks were unique, allowing them to create soil where plants could flourish. People were amazed by this, especially the children, who marveled at the sight. The birds benefited from the boars' actions by feeding on worms in the soil. As a result, the birds and boars became friends. The loose earth turned over by the boars made it easier for women and girls to break up the soil with sticks. Eventually, new plants grew from seeds dropped by birds. The Dutch people learned to bake bread and cakes, and they even made sandwiches. Despite the boars' contributions, the people believed they were superior because they could hunt and kill the boars.|"[""1.

Long ago, our ancestors, inspired by the fairies, set out to beat the boars and birds by inventing something remarkable. Through careful planning and hard work, they crafted the plough. Men and women joined forces, pulling the iron-shod wood through the earth to prepare it for planting. Over time, they refined the plough, adding a knife, a coulter, a beam, a mould board, and even a wheel. Eventually, they harnessed horses to pull the plough, making farming more efficient. As the boars vanished, their legacy lived on in brave knights who adorned their shields with the boar's head. Meanwhile, the memory of the fairy Uller, patron of winter and inventor of skates and sleds, was cherished by boys and girls. His sacred yew tree symbolized the importance of archery.|"['1.

Long ago, powerful giantesses roamed the world, untamed by men except by Woden, the sun god. In winter, Woden left, and Uller ruled in his place, residing in the North Pole or the Alps with his wife. Uller's daughters joined them, enjoying the cold and playing happily until they grew older. Trouble began when a young giant fairy named Vuur courted all six sisters, causing chaos. Eventually, Uller made Vuur marry his daughters, turning them into one named Regen. Their child, Stoom, inherited their power but caused mischief, often escaping and creating chaos, like causing earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Stoom's unruly nature led to many disasters due to its explosive tendencies.|"['1. What was the name of the sun god in the text?\nA) Uller\nB) Woden\nC) Regen\nD) Vuur\nE) Stoom', '2.

In the olden days, farmers believed that mischievous elves were behind strange occurrences on their farms. If a horse's mane was tangled or cows had their tails tied together, it was blamed on the elves. When animals fell ill or died, farmers thought the elves were responsible, believing they shot arrows at the creatures. One particular elf named Styf, known for his pranks, enjoyed causing chaos at parties. He would mix up the wooden shoes left outside, making it difficult for people to find their own. Another group of elves called the Staalkaars lived in stables and among cows, assisting Styf in his tricks. They even played pranks on those who were greedy, leading them into swamps on dark nights, hoping to catch elusive lights that turned out to be mischievous elves.|['1.

Old Styf, a mischievous elf, loved to play pranks on a stingy man in the village who scolded children for spending money. One day, Styf offered the man a thousand guilders for four striped tulips from his garden. The man eagerly accepted, thinking it was real silver, but later found only leaves in his strongbox. The Moss Maidens, other elves, laughed at his misfortune. Despite their cleverness, the elves also did good deeds like making shoes for cobblers and clothes for tired mothers. When the blue flax flower bloomed, Styf saw an opportunity to help. He taught Dutch weavers to make fine linen, which became famous worldwide. The lady elves were surprised to see white meadows turned into linen bleaching grounds but admired the humans' intelligence. They planned to show humans that elves could do even more to impress them.|"['1.

The following day, a group of beautiful elf maidens and mothers approached Styf with a request to create something even better than linen, which had been inspired by spiders. Styf, known as Haan-e'-kam, agreed and sought the help of Fro, the spirit of sunshine and rain. Fro, who wielded a sword that fought enemies on its own, shared a secret with Styf after a day's wait. Styf then embarked on experiments for seven days, assisted by kabouters, who shared alchemy secrets. He then organized a grand exhibition for all elves, showcasing a magical laundry system.

Elves and fairies, tiny creatures of folklore, worked together with their friends, the kabouters, to create a magical invention. The elves demonstrated the power of this invention by transforming dusty and stained clothes into white and resplendent garments. This substance, a mix of powder and white lumps, was used with hot water to wash and bleach clothes to perfection. Soon, the Dutch people embraced this innovation, turning their linen closets into snowy piles. Women across the Low Countries made intricate caps and ruffs using this new starch, bringing forth a wave of fashion and style. The success of this invention brought wealth to the nation, with kings and nobles adorning themselves in elaborate ruffs. The kabouters, dark elves who live in forests and mines, played a vital role in mining precious minerals.

Long ago, the Dutch land had no church spires or bells. When teachers came from the South, they taught the people better manners, nicer clothes, and healthier food. They urged them to abandon cruel gods and vengeful habits, instead sharing the story of a loving Father in Heaven. Some foreign teachers were rude, hurting feelings daily by cutting sacred trees and mocking holy wells. However, wise teachers used kind words to wean the people from old customs. Those who listened built churches, and their lives improved mysteriously. The gnomes and kabouters, hearing the teachers' wish for church bells, decided to create a carillon, a concert of bells, to hang in the air.|['1.

One group of the strongest gnomes, called kabouters, were working in the forest near a village. Men, instructed by a foreign teacher, were cutting down some of the oldest trees. The kabouters, at night, took the men's axes and quickly leveled all the trees except the sacred ones. The timber was then brought to the mine to be used for bells. The gnomes chose a wise bell player, or klokken-spieler, to test the bells for a carillon. Each bell was hung on trestles in a row for practice. The kabouters, including parents, children, and babies, were lined up to sing. The bell player selected the best voices to match and tune the bells.

Once upon a time, in the heart of Holland, there was a magical place where music filled the air like never before. The bishop, astonished by the heavenly sounds, heard a carillon, a symphony of melodies that only a choir of angels could match. This enchanting music was made by the kabouters, fairy-like creatures who toiled through the night to create this masterpiece before the break of day. The light elves thrived in the sunshine, but for the dark kabouters, sunlight turned them to stone. The sweet tunes of the carillon spread throughout the region, making the Netherlands a land of harmonious melodies and tinkling bells. Every town had its own carillon, playing hymns and songs every quarter-hour, marking the passing of time and bringing joy to all who heard it.

In the past, a lord built a castle in a forest of oak, beech, and alder trees where game was abundant. The area was enclosed by a hedge, earning it the name The Count's Hedge, now known as The Hague. The city still boasts the ancient forests and the Vijver fish-pond with swans and their cygnets. Storks, whose ancestors lived there before America was discovered, also reside in the town. The lords and ladies used to go hawking in a grand procession with falconers and dogs. However, among the wealthy, there was a childless and ill-tempered Countess who was envious of mothers. One day, a poor widow with twin babies begged for food, but the Countess, believing the woman's story was a lie, rudely dismissed her.|"[""1.

The mother cried out to the rich lady, accusing her of being wicked and cruel. The babies were hungry, but the lady was indifferent. She ordered her servants to remove the beggar woman, who held her children up to the lady as a form of protest. The lady, in her grand mansion, paid no heed to the woman's words, as she was wealthy and had many servants. She lived luxuriously and had a grand church where she worshipped.

None of the tiny creatures were bigger than a mouse. From dawn onwards, one after another emerged - first a girl, then a boy. By the forty-eighth, the nurse struggled to name them all. It was impossible to keep the babies apart. The thirty-one servant maids were called to help sort the girls from the boys. After hours of trying, they realized it was futile. The babies, Peter from Henry, Catalina from Annetje, were all mixed up. Attempts to distinguish them failed. With the supply of ribbons exhausted, and clothes too big, the babies were baptized en masse by Bishop Guy. The Count, strict in customs, insisted on this. The babies were carried to church in various items, including a Turk's Head dish. The procession to the Great Church was a spectacle, drawing crowds in a unique event never seen before in The Hague.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a Count and a Bishop had a peculiar event with a group of babies. Initially, the babies were calm in the fresh outdoor air, but chaos ensued once they were inside the church. A maid tripped over an old crusader's helmet, causing a commotion that led to babies being spilled out. Thankfully, an old lady's gown cushioned their fall, saving them from harm. The Bishop, exhausted at the thought of naming all the infants, decided to baptize them more efficiently. He used holy water to sprinkle the babies, each named John or Elizabeth. Unfortunately, the babies, too fragile for the process, all passed away by sunset. A monument was later erected in their honor, commemorating the brief lives of these tiny souls.|"[""1.

Once in Japan, the Tycoon wanted to gift the Dutch Prince. Curiosities from all over Japan, from sweet potato fields to seal waters, were collected. Japanese goods, from warm indigo fields to cold bear lands, were sent as gifts to the Dutch. The Dutch were believed to like cheese, wooden shoes, forks, and wear many petticoats. While packing, a young Oni sneaked in and played with the gifts. He dressed in silk, danced, and leaped around. The next day, the Dutch ship sailed to Rotterdam with the gifts. At The Hague, the presents were displayed for the Prince and Princess. The Oni, accidentally packed, jumped out in The Hague, scaring the maid and servants.

In the story, the Oni, a mysterious creature, sneaked out of the house wearing wooden klomps to hide its tracks from the dogs. It ran into the fields and hid among the cows when it heard men approaching. The Oni then jumped on a cow's back to escape the men with pitchforks, causing chaos in the cow stable.

Once upon a time, beneath the birch tree, lovers pledged their love, carving two hearts joined as one on its smooth bark. The forest provided shade in summer and warmth in winter. Spring brought wonder with new leaves, while autumn fattened the pigs on acorns. As more cows, sheep, and horses roamed, open land was needed for pastures and crops. Fruit trees blossomed, and fields of grass, wheat, rye, and barley flourished. Gardens and orchards replaced dark woods, welcoming sunlight. Yet, the carpenter Eyck feared the loss of oak trees. But a message from the ancient oak assured him that generations to come would benefit from the land's abundance.

Van Eyck was visited by two elves who instructed him to saw two pieces of oak wood, each a foot long, and leave them on the kitchen table overnight.

Once, Dutch hunters journeyed to Africa to capture a lion family successfully. Using hounds and natives, they herded a male lion, his mate, and four cubs into a pit. The lions were then transported to Holland, where the baby cubs were adored by sailors. Lions were revered for their strength, dignity, and courage, symbolizing kingship. Before lions, wolves and bears were esteemed for their fur and bravery. Lions were known for their loud roars, shaggy manes, and long tails with a nail at the end. They were considered the kings of beasts, depicted on flags and armor. A Dutch artist observed how kings preferred fierce creatures on their banners, leading him to use lions as models for coats of arms, making them pose in various positions.|['1.

In the past, lions were made to pose in various ways, even standing on two legs for hours, to be drawn on flags, shields, and other items. The lions, particularly the father lion, were forced to hold unnatural poses, with the threat of punishment if they refused. The artist demanded the lions to take different positions, from standing on hind legs to curling their manes like mythical creatures. The lions, especially the father, had to endure this treatment to satisfy the demand for lion images in the country. The lions became a popular symbol, appearing on various objects from flags to shop signs.

The lion family's father looked freshly groomed, prompting Mrs. Leo to lick her cubs until they shone like him. She combed her fur with her tongue and polished her skin, even using her tail's nail for a final touch. Despite his efforts, the artist wanted a circle of hair on the lion's tail. Unfortunately, a spill of a beard-growing potion caused the daughter to sprout facial hair, which was eventually shaved off. The artist then sold the potion, and soon young men were growing beards and impressing their love interests. The artist, eager for success, applied the potion to Daddy Lion, causing the lion great distress. Ultimately, the lion nearly perished from exhaustion due to being restrained for a week while the potion was applied to his tail.|"['1.

Unfortunately, Leo met a tragic end due to a strange ointment that was meant to promote hair growth but ended up causing his demise. Following Leo's passing, a talented artist who specialized in grooming lions also passed away. His son, determined to continue his father's legacy, raised a lion cub with a unique curly tail. This cub, after growing into a majestic lion, became the ancestor of all curly-tailed lions in the Netherlands. The lion's distinctive features, including a crown, a sword, and a bundle of arrows, became symbols of pride and heritage for the people of the land. The descendants of this lion continue to honor their ancestor to this day.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a wicked giant built a castle by the river and demanded toll from passing ships. If the captains refused to pay, he would cut off their hands and throw them into the river. The giant's cruel actions caused the city to lose trade and prosperity. Foreign merchants avoided the city, fearing the giant's punishment. The city became known as Hand Werpen by the Germans and Antwerp by the Dutch. Even when the Duke of Brabant tried to stop the giant, Antigonus, the giant, remained unfazed.

In the province of Brabant, a brave young man named Brabo lived with a deep love for his country and its flag of yellow, black, and red. He devised a plan to defeat the giant, Antigonus, who terrorized the land. Brabo promised to confront the giant while the soldiers stormed the castle. He cleverly outwitted the giant, who turned out to be a cowardly bully. Brabo climbed into the castle through a window and defeated the giant by cutting off his head and hands.

In Antwerp, the people were proud of Brabo's bravery. The city lit up with candles in every house, celebrating their hero. Maidens in white, led by one in the colors of the Brabant flag, sang praises for Brabo. The citizens decided to keep the name 'Antwerp' and adopted a new symbol: two red hands above a castle. The Duke of Brabant granted the city new privileges for Brabo's valor. Ships from around the world came to Antwerp, making it a wealthy port once more. A monument of Brabo stands in the square, triumphantly holding the hand of the defeated giant Antigonus.

Ryer, once a wealthy man from Drenthe, was never satisfied with his riches. He cared more about gaining more land and wealth than the well-being of his animals. His greed led him to deceive his neighbors by feeding his cows green spectacles and mixing straw with hay to make it seem like fresh grass. He even stole bits of land from his neighbors and added it to his own farm. However, his ill-gotten gains proved to be his undoing. After heavy rains caused the land to become waterlogged, Ryer's farm began to sink. In a moment of irony, while trying to work his horses near the edge of a ditch, Ryer fell in, and his land was on the brink of floating away. Only his son, Pete, saved him from drowning.

"Meanwhile, the farm and ""the Queezel,"" as the neighbors called her, were floating away. The mainland was getting farther away as the farm moved northward towards Friesland.

"Long ago, when meat or fish was scarce, people in Holland enjoyed toasted bread with cheese, known as ""geroostered brod met kaas."" They laughed and playfully named dishes after whatever they imagined. Grown-ups also loved to pretend like children. Cheese parties became popular, where folks nibbled on cheese-topped toast by the fire. But after eating, some had unsettling dreams. These nightmares, or ""nacht merrie"" in Dutch, involved a large she-horse sitting on their chest, making it hard to breathe. These dreams were caused by goblins, mischievous creatures with big heads and green eyes, who could turn to stone if seen in daylight. They would play tricks, like mimicking words as echoes.

"In the old days, the Dutch people lived in common, sharing almost everything they had. They traded items like salt for furs and fish for iron. But when they encountered stronger tribes, they needed more than what nature provided. Pedlars and merchants from the south brought new goods like mirrors, jewelry, and clothes that the women desired. For men, they offered iron tools and improved traps. With the arrival of traders, coins made of gold, silver, and copper appeared in towns and forests. The coins were mysterious and shiny, known as money after the Roman goddess Juno Moneta. The wise explained that honesty and justice were keys to never lacking money. Over time, the word ""gold"" became synonymous with money, but some sought quick riches, forgetting the goddess's teachings."|"['1.

Some saved coins, teaching their children about money. Families started having names with ""penny"" in them. Saving coins in a home bank was seen as wise and virtuous. On the contrary, some hoarded coins, becoming misers. Three types of people emerged - the thrifty, spendthrifts, and misers, with the latter disliked the most.

"""It's amazing how foolish humans can be,"" remarked the first creature. ""Take old Vrek, for instance. He spent fifty years amassing a fortune in gold coins, but lost his true self in the process. His soul has shrunk to the size of a shrimp. I warned him to keep his money safe, but his greed consumed him. Now, he's passed away, and few care to bury him. When someone asked what he left behind, the response was 'Nothing - he took it all with him, as he had so little to leave.'

He preyed on those who hoarded their riches, turning them into shadows of their former selves. These miserable individuals, known as 'Schim,' were believed to have lost all compassion.

At a gathering of kabouters underground, each shared their mischievous deeds on Earth. The chief kabouter proudly announced, 'I've trapped a young Schim.

Long ago, when vast forests blanketed the land and wild creatures roamed freely, the people of Friesland had no churches. They worshipped Woden, also known as Fos-i-te', under sacred trees. Illnesses were laid at the feet of these trees, hoping for a cure. If someone passed away under the tree and its leaves fell on them, it was seen as a sign of peace. But everything changed when a singer arrived from the south, playing sweet melodies at the royal court. The king's daughter, Fos-te-dí'-na, was captivated by his songs of love, kindness, and forgiveness.

Three days earlier, a group of Christian Danes were captured in the woods by the Frisians. They had entered peacefully, unarmed, to share news of their new religion. Unknowingly, they had cut branches from a sacred tree to make a fire. A spy reported this sacrilege to his chief, and the Danes were taken as prisoners. The Frisians, influenced by Roman practices, planned to release hungry wolves and other fierce animals on the captives as a form of entertainment. However, Fos-te-dí-na, moved by compassion, freed the prisoners under the cover of night. The next day, the angry crowd demanded her punishment for defying their traditions.

Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a brave girl named Fos-te-dí-na faced a great trial. The king's daughter knelt as an angry old man pressed sharp thorns onto her brow, causing blood to trickle down her face and hair.

In the past, the city of Stavoren was prosperous but soon faced a decline. The population shrank, trade vanished, and surviving residents had to settle for rye and barley bread instead of wheat. Floods devastated the area, leading to the construction of dykes to protect what remained. The ocean waves further wreaked havoc, destroying cities and farms.
