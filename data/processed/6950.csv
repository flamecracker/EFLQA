Bert suggested sending the peaches over instead of taking them in the small cart, fearing Freddie might cause trouble. Reluctantly, Freddie left the peaches and went with the others to meet Aunt Emily and Mrs. Bobbsey. Excited to show Harry around, Bert and Freddie noticed Downy, mistaking him for someone in trouble. The life-saver rushed to rescue Downy, a duck swimming peacefully. After the misunderstanding was cleared, Downy was returned to Freddie, causing laughter among the crowd. To prevent further mishaps, the boys decided to build a fence to keep Downy safe. They hid from Freddie to plan this while ensuring Downy's comfort in the barn until the fence was ready.|"['1.

Hal shared that he overheard an old farmer talking about Native Americans near Berkley. The boys, engrossed, didn't notice the darkening sky or the twists in the woods.

As darkness fell, they found a lost cow with a bell. Its owner, grateful, offered them milk, fresh eggs, and butter.

Mrs. Minturn's boat came in second place during the competition, right behind the Mayor's boat. Following closely was Mrs. Bingham's boat, creatively designed to resemble a car.

However, upon seeing the drifting boat, a farmer took charge, realizing the children needed help. He ferried them back, refusing any reward for his assistance. Meanwhile, the worry over the twins' disappearance caused delays in Aunt Sarah and Harry's trip to Meadow Brook. Later, the girls huddled together, plotting mischievous pranks.

Around midnight, Bert heard what he thought were a dozen clock chimes. A strange pecking noise at his window woke him. Thinking it was a dream, Bert called Harry, and they listened.

Dinah, from above, teased them about disturbing her sleep. Bert and Harry decided to go back to bed. The boys couldn't locate the source of the sound. Bert thought it might be a ghost or banshee.
