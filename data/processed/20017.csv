A young girl with hair as golden as Josie's caught her attention. They shared smiles and showed each other their dolls. However, Josie grew tired before reaching Boston and dozed off. Upon waking in Boston, she saw her new friend leaving. Josie waved goodbye and then closed her eyes tightly. During her stay with her auntie, Josie's cousin Bess became her companion. As they boarded the train to Newport, Josie's thoughts turned back to finding a friend. Back home for lunch, Josie excitedly recounted her visit to her sister. Suddenly, she spotted a butterfly on a wild-rose spray and joyfully exclaimed that it was a gift from God. The child's carefree demeanor contrasted with the butterfly's envy of her freedom. The monkey in a suit amused onlookers by playing the fiddle, showing off his scholarly spectacles, and bowing graciously for the pennies thrown his way.

Amy enjoyed her summer vacation at Grandma's, surrounded by nature and fun activities. She had her bicycle to explore the area and even rode alongside her cousin Jamie on the Shetland pony, Gypsy. On rainy days, when they were stuck inside, Grandma entertained them with lovely stories, often about Amy's father when he was young. One story Grandma shared was about how little Harvey, Amy's father, loved fruit and flowers. When he was just three years old, he filled his hat with tulips by pulling them off their stems.
