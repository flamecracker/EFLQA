"Chapter I: The Ride

In a gleaming car, Maida Westabrook, a delicate little girl, sat with her father, Buffalo Westabrook, Dr. Pierce, and her friend Billy Potter.

"Dr. Pierce pointed to the old house on the corner where he grew up, reminiscing about the swing that used to hang from a tree where he broke his arm. Across from the school was a wide court with beautiful trees casting shade. Wooden toy houses lined the court, hidden by climbing vines. Pigeons flew around, and children played, creating a sweet, earthy smell in the air. Suddenly, a girl in a scarlet cape and hat appeared, climbing over a fence. As they entered a big red-brick house, Billy Potter hinted at an imaginative task he was working on. The door opened to reveal a silver-haired woman in black-silk attire, Granny Flynn, who had cared for Maida since her mother's passing. Maida affectionately called her ""Dame"" for her fairy-tale resemblance."|"['1.

Granny Flynn, a petite and elderly woman, was always coy about her age, claiming to be a thousand and nine years old. Despite her bent figure and wrinkled skin, her eyes sparkled with youthfulness, and her sweet smile shone through. Maida, excited by her father's plan to have her run a shop, eagerly accepted the challenge. Her father, emphasizing the need for secrecy, explained that Maida would work in disguise as Granny Flynn's grandchild to avoid attracting attention. He assured her that Billy Potter would be available for assistance if needed but encouraged her to try solving problems independently first.

Early one morning, a week later, Granny Flynn, Billy, and Maida set out to the subway after Mrs. Murdock declared she only needed a week to fix the whole place.

"As Billy admired the uneven floors, Petronilla needed to walk carefully to avoid tripping. Granny Flynn tried to open an old door, reminiscing about Ireland.

Maida and her family were busy preparing for the opening of their toy store in Boston. Maida visited wholesale places with Granny Flynn to choose new stock, while Billy always joined them.

"The room transformed magically, with white woodwork, walls adorned with red roses, curtains of snowy muslin at the windows, and golden cages with canaries. Pots of scarlet geraniums lined the sills. A cozy fire crackled in the fireplace, with chairs for Granny and Maida. Granny's cherished clock and a spidery-legged spinet gleamed. Maida's favorite books filled a little bookcase, a desk with blank-books stood ready, and Granny's ""Book of Saints"" lay nearby. The bedrooms were simple but bright, one with flowered chintz walls and the other with panels telling a hunting tale.

Two identical little girls stood at the entrance. They were twins, dressed in matching red sweaters and caps, with round chubby bodies and faces. Their big round eyes and golden curls made them look like mirror images. They whispered to each other as they debated what to buy from the one-cent case. Despite the candy on display, their gaze was fixed on Maida, who felt self-conscious. Eventually, Dorothy chose two large pickles, and Mabel picked two large chocolates. As they left, they exchanged their treats. Maida found their payment endearing, as the coins felt warm from their hands. She savored the moment, thinking it was more valuable than even the gold coins her father had gifted her. Just then, the bell rang, announcing the arrival of a disheveled boy with dark eyes demanding a blue top from the window. His impatient demeanor made a penny fly off the counter as he slammed down his money.|"['1.

As the school bell rang, children filled the streets, playing games like tag and leapfrog. Maida, busy in her shop, hurried as the bell rang.

"""Oh, yes, I do remember,"" Maida said excitedly. She remembered leaving a few sheets of tissue paper in a drawer, unsure of what to do with them.

Laura grinned. Raising both arms overhead, she glided across the room, twirling on her tiptoes. Spinning around with a smile, she gracefully moved and posed. Maida was captivated by her performance. Shortly after, Laura returned in a stunning red dress with a black velvet jacket adorned with jingling coins. Maida noticed the delicate clapping sound from Laura's tiny wooden clappers and the musical clink from her shoes' metal plates. This was the first hint at Maida's limp in Primrose Court. Laura, fanning herself lazily, shared her experiences of dancing at parties and a grand May celebration. Maida, recalling her own joyful times in Primrose Court, felt a deep connection to the children there. Laura's mention of Maida's extravagant birthday party sparked doubt among the adults.

Hard work was evident in every corner of the room. The oilcloth gleamed brightly, the stove sparkled like a freshly polished shoe, and the rows of pans on the wall twinkled in the light. The air was filled with delicious smells, indicating that Dicky was preparing one of his famous Irish stews. Dicky showed Maida a small truck that Arthur Duncan had made for him to transport coal from across the room to the stove, making his job much easier. He also demonstrated a clever soap-shaker made from a tin can with holes punched in the bottom. Dicky's baby, named after his grandmother in Ireland, was chubby and mischievous, keeping them on their toes. As Delia played with her dolls, Dicky read a fairy-tale to Maida, showing great improvement in his reading skills.|"[""1.

Maida and Dicky were captivated by the beauty of peacocks with their vibrant feathers shining in the sun. Maida found them so breathtaking that she even cried the first time she saw one.

Maida listened to Granny's advice but the frustration lingered, making her dread twilight. She decided she needed to resolve it soon. Maida believed she could seek help from Billy Potter to end it, but she hesitated, preferring to handle her issues independently. When Laura visited the shop one afternoon, Maida remained silent, feeling unable to interact after their last encounter. Laura, too, stayed quiet, displaying a haughty demeanor. Granny comforted Maida, praising her shop despite Laura's criticism. Overwhelmed, Maida expressed her worries about meeting her father's expectations and making the store profitable.

Rosie and Maida were busy in the kitchen, preparing a variety of candies. Rosie shared her knowledge about dulse, a purple salty treat, and the art of making apples-on-the-stick, mollolligobs, and corn-balls. With Rosie's help, Maida learned to create these sweet delights. The two girls worked together efficiently, with Rosie moving around the stove expertly. Maida, on the other hand, was busy popping corn by the fireplace. Together, they crafted fifty apples on skewers, thirty corn-balls, and twenty-five mollolligobs. Impressed by Rosie's skills, Maida felt a bit inadequate compared to the talented children in Primrose Court. As they worked, Maida confided in Granny about her feelings of uselessness.

Two days later, Arthur Duncan returned to the shop. Maida had just sold some pretty striped pencils with blue stones on the end. Three pencils were left on the counter. Arthur asked to see some penholders, and Maida showed him three. He bought one, and after he left, Maida noticed there were only two pencils left. She searched but couldn't find the missing one. She remembered a previous incident and felt troubled. Later, Arthur came back, and Maida played with Dicky, who had items matching the stolen ones. Maida realized Arthur had taken them.

"Arthur stared at her, speechless. ""If you think you can scare me—"" he began, then abruptly left the shop. To Maida, his bravado seemed like a facade for deeper emotions. Feeling weary, she longed for Granny Flynn's return. She yearned for Granny's comforting embrace and whimsical tales of Irish fairies. However, the bell interrupted her thoughts as a new customer entered. While attending to the customer, Maida noticed a figure peering into the window and quickly ducking out of sight.

Klara lived in a house perched on a cliff by the sea. One night, as she gazed at the rising moon, she was captivated by its unusual appearance—a large, deep orange sphere. To her amazement, the moon kept growing bigger as it ascended the sky, eventually halting midway. Suddenly, a peculiar old lady emerged from the moon's doorway, accompanied by a black cat and a broomstick. The old lady tossed a golden carpet-like object into the sea, which unfurled rapidly towards Klara's window. As the golden trail rose to meet her, Klara felt compelled to touch it.

Klara quietly opened her window and stepped onto the Wake of Gold. The cool, hard path gently sloped from her window to the sea. As she ran down to the water's edge, she hesitated before the path of gold leading to the moon. Remembering her mother's instructions, Klara steeled her heart and bravely walked out. The journey to the moon seemed short from her window, but the doorway kept moving farther away. Despite the long walk, Klara found the path beautiful. She saw a school of colorful fish swimming gracefully in the water, each more stunning than the last. Further along, she discovered a magical sea-grotto with vibrant sea life and playful sea-horses.

Further ahead, Klara encountered an even more astonishing sight - a village inhabited by mer-people. The village was nestled deep in the water, appearing distant yet visible due to the crystal-clear water. The mer-houses were crafted from sparkling white coral, with wide windows allowing the tide to drift through. Streets paved with pearl and sidewalks lined with gold led to towering mer-trees where melodious fish perched on branches. Little mer-boats, adorned with pink coral and mother-of-pearl sails, glided through the streets. Mer-maidens with green scales and golden hair, accompanied by mer-boys playing harps, filled the scene. At the village's end stood a grand palace, where the mer-king and queen resided with their royal offspring and enchanting pets. As Klara approached the moon, she glimpsed a mesmerizing garden beyond a door, with silvery paths, fountains, and vibrant flower-beds. The garden was a paradise of singing birds, precious stones, and delectable treats. Just as Klara was about to step inside, a mysterious old lady with an unsettling presence appeared.|['1.

Klara found herself in a vast, desolate wasteland filled with heaps of old trash, as far as her eyes could see. Despite the discouraging and dirty work of searching through the dump-heaps for weeks, she persevered. Klara endured pain from insect bites, scratches from vines, and pricks from thistles, with bleeding feet and hands. Through this challenging task, she reflected on her past behavior, realizing she had been naughty and caused her mother worry.

During a fun game, Rosie and Maida explored ways to discover their future spouses. Rosie threw apple parings over her shoulder to find her future husband's initial, while Maida walked down dark cellar stairs with a candle and mirror to see her future spouse's face. Excited children watched as Rosie and Maida took their turns. Rosie's laughter filled the room after her attempt, and Maida, despite her lameness, bravely completed the task. Maida saw a jack-o’-lantern behind her in the mirror, causing a playful scare. Afterwards, they enjoyed activities like blowing bubbles and roasting chestnuts. Laura later apologized to Maida for her past behavior, explaining that she was unwell at the time. They ended the day with a dance by Laura.|"[""1.

"Laura admitted her jealousy towards Maida, confessing that she spread hurtful rumors out of envy. However, she assured Maida that she never believed those lies herself, trusting Maida's honesty. Despite Maida's father being absent due to business, they kept in touch through letters, though it couldn't fill the void of his absence. Billy, sensing Maida's loneliness, visited her more often. One night, the group played a captivating game-story called ""The Crystal Ball"" in the dark, transporting them to a magical world inside the crystal ball. Although Maida longed for her father to join them for Thanksgiving, it was not possible.

Dicky continued his reading lessons with Maida, even though she could tell he was becoming a proficient reader. Granny Flynn adored the quiet, studious boy. One day after Thanksgiving, Maida went to Dicky's house to borrow pink tissue paper. She heard crying from inside. It was Dicky. When she entered, she found him upset. Dicky shared that the doctor said he would be a cripple forever. Maida comforted him, sharing her own story of overcoming a similar prognosis with the help of a great physician.

Maida sadly admitted that there might be other doctors as good as the one Dicky needed. She assured Dicky not to worry because her father could fix everything. Dicky, while setting the table, shared that he wanted to cry when he first heard the news but couldn't as he didn't want to upset his mother or Doc O’Brien. Maida then made extra efforts to be kind to Dicky, even brainstorming new ideas for his school projects. The group, including Rosie and Arthur, stayed busy. One snowy morning, Maida was thrilled to see the world covered in a blanket of snow, making everything look magical. With the storm intensifying, school ended early, and the children marveled at the winter wonderland outside. Trade in the shop slowed as the storm kept customers away.|['1.

It snowed all night and the next morning, with fewer kids going to school. When the sun came out at two o'clock, the children filled the streets with shovels, brooms, and snowballs flying. Maida watched as Rosie's red cape and hat turned white with snow, her black hair and brows adorned with flakes. Rosie's cheeks were coral-colored, her eyes like velvety moons. Billy gathered everyone in the yard and instructed them to pile the snow in one corner. With Billy and Arthur swiftly shoveling, Maida, Rosie, and Dicky hopped around. The snow-pile grew, reaching the fence top. Billy warned about the roof caving in and began digging a room. The roof collapsed on him, but they rebuilt the structure, creating a snow dwelling. Billy poured water to freeze the house, and they made snowballs for a fun battle.|"['1.

Billy carefully assembled the snowman, placing the legs in one corner and rolling the big round body onto them. Adding the arms proved tricky, but after some effort, they were attached just right. Everyone pitched in to create the snowman's features. Maida used dulse for hair, Rosie found a clothes-pin for the nose, Dicky used coals for eyes, and Arthur crafted teeth from orange peels. The snowman was dressed in an old coat, a tall hat, and even had a pipe in its mouth. As the finishing touch, Billy added a cane and gave the snowman a jaunty tilt to its head. The group then went coasting down Halliwell Street, with Maida bursting with excitement and joy.|"[""1.

Maida and her friends climbed the hill again, watching kids sled down the coast in various ways. Some went alone, others in pairs, and a few even used unconventional items like shovels and brooms for sledding. Rosie generously lent her sled to those without one. The smooth ice allowed for all kinds of makeshift sleds. One boy even slid down on his feet, landing in a heap of snow. During one ride, their sled hit a stray sled, causing a tumble, but everyone was okay. The cold weather brought continuous snowstorms, leading to extra days off school. Mr. Chumpleigh, a tall and jolly neighbor, became a neighborhood favorite despite his battered appearance from snowball fights.|['1.

On a Monday morning, Maida rushed to the window filled with worry about what she might witness. Instead of the expected thaw, a breathtaking scene unfolded before her eyes. The previous night's cold weather had caused everything that had begun to melt to freeze once more. The sidewalks resembled frosted cakes, adorned with long icicles framing the rooftops. The trees and bushes were coated in a layer of crystal. Sunlight danced through this icy wonderland, turning the world into a treasure trove of diamonds. By the afternoon, Mr. Chumpleigh appeared to be drooping, and by nightfall, his head was sadly resting on his shoulder. The next morning, all that remained in the corner was a heap of snow with scattered items like an old coat, a hat, gloves, a pipe, and a cane. A sign made by Billy, with red and gold lettering, hung in Maida's window for a week, depicting a charming Christmas scene that captured the attention of children and adults alike. The sign brought joy to Maida, who noticed a decrease in her trade as children saved their coins for the fair. Arthur worked tirelessly on a more intricate project, the sound of his hammering echoing into Maida's room early in the morning and sometimes late at night. Granny praised the hard work of the children, drawing a heartwarming parallel to her own daughter, Annie, who was always busy with Christmas preparations.|"['1.

Maida quickly clarified to Rosie that her inability to buy presents wasn't due to a lack of desire but because she had been unwell and confined to bed. Despite her illness, people still gifted her lovely items. Rosie, in her practical tone, pointed out that Maida, despite being a regular girl, was running a shop, almost like affording an automobile. Maida, feeling the need to explain, shared that her father didn't have a valet like some affluent families. Rosie, intrigued by the idea of a razor that works like a lawnmower, contemplated buying one for her father.

Rosie's expression changed as she shared that her missing friend had not returned, yet she was prepared with a Christmas gift for her if she did. Maida eagerly agreed to help with the gift, finding it a thrilling prospect to pick out presents without any adult interference. The night before the fair, the children worked diligently to set up their displays, overflowing with various items. Maida suggested using the long kitchen table for Arthur's items, while Dicky's and Rosie's would be placed on shelves and in show cases for safekeeping. They admired the treasures and arranged them neatly. Maida saved the best for last, revealing beautifully decorated candy-boxes she had ordered for Rosie's treats.

The tall tree reached toward the ceiling, adorned with a beautiful Christmas angel just above. It sparkled with silver and gold ornaments, strings of popcorn and cranberries, and glass icicles. Candles flickered, casting a golden and silver glow. At the tree's base, tiny figures told the Christmas story. Gifts appeared magically for each child: a golden cage with canaries, a chest of tools, a bookcase of books, sashes, ribbons, dollhouses, and more. Maida received a special set of paper boxes, a necklace, a recipe book, bed-shoes, a locket, and a book dedicated to her. Her father gifted a miniature portrait of her mother. Granny worried about Maida's upcoming journey, but Mr. Westabrook assured her that Maida was capable and that they should all remain together.|"['1.
