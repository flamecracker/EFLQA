On a quiet summer afternoon, Elinor Pomeroy heard the loud barking of dogs. She set aside her knitting and strolled outside. The three large dogs were excitedly greeting a young man racing up the driveway. He explained how he had invented a gas that could put people to sleep temporarily without harm. The man proposed using it in battle to capture enemies without casualties. Despite initial skepticism, Mr. Leffingwell, a man in the group, suggested testing the gas on his cows.

Beany reminded the group about the papers they found near the spot where his clothes had been.

"As Asa pondered the situation, he decided it would be a good idea to have someone join him. When he spotted the Potter twins' bright red wheels up ahead, he knew they were the ones. Asa called out, and the twins stopped for him.

""Sure thing!"" Beany agreed. ""We figured you might need a reminder of what you wanted to say, and we always remember better than the others. So, we set off. We knew you'd catch up.""

""Alright, let's go!"" Asa exclaimed, and they pedaled swiftly down the picturesque country road. Upon reaching the Farm, they discovered that the Colonel, who was staying in Syracuse, had not yet arrived. The men were tending to the horses, preparing the gear, and laying out saddle blankets.

""Wait! Let him finish speaking first,"" Asa urged, feeling a rush of nerves. ""He's in charge of all the patrols, and he's probably giving out orders. The spies must really dislike him!""

Just then, a sleek racing car glided up silently, halting in front of the boys seated on the stone wall. The Colonel, without acknowledging the newcomers, continued with his instructions.

"As night descended, three men sat quietly in a plain, dusty room. A peculiar scratching at the door caught their attention. They exchanged glances. ""It must be the Weasel, don't you think?"" remarked a tall man with a scar on his cheek. The scar, usually inconspicuous, turned white when he was upset, stark against his dark complexion. The third man, buried under newspapers, remained silent. He exuded an air of education, with a brutish jaw and panther-like golden eyes, his slender hands resembling those of a thief. ""Adolph, the door!"" he interrupted. Adolph, a burly man, clumsily rose, spilling his cards. The third man shot him a piercing glare. ""Clumsy!"" he muttered in a foreign language.

"After watching the boys ride away, the Colonel turned to address them, but they had disappeared. Sadly, they had wandered off to the cow stables and sat on a bale of hay feeling dejected.

The spy tied Porky's wrists and ankles with a cord, gagged him, and gave him a pill to make him sleep. Porky pretended to be asleep but secretly worked to remove the pill.

"""That's correct,"" exclaimed the Colonel enthusiastically. ""Just imagine the opportunity to receive a quality education for four to six years in a reputable school and college. Think about how many students would eagerly seize such a chance!""

""Indeed, sir,"" replied Beany earnestly. ""I wish more students had the opportunity. Here is your destination."" With that, he exited the car. Beany, exhausted, dirty, and pale under the grime, hadn't eaten supper and felt disheartened. The idea of college weighed heavily on his mind, overshadowing the enjoyment of his spy hunting.

As he dwelled on the notion of a college education, his frustration grew. Suddenly, he encountered two men on the sidewalk. One of them paled and exclaimed, ""It's him! What did you give him?"" The man then collapsed in a convulsion, causing Beany to flee in fear. An ambulance was called, but Beany sat quietly, unnoticed by the commotion.

Pop Potter observed his wife quietly as he read the paper, not uttering a word.

The boys had a perilous mission ahead as they maneuvered through the dark night to reach the ominous old brown stone house. With caution and stealth, they climbed the sturdy fire-escape attached to the neighboring private sanitarium. Despite the pitch darkness, they navigated the treacherous path to the roof. As they tiptoed over the pebbled surface, they faced the challenge of crossing to the adjacent building. With nerves of steel, they made the daring drop to the lower level, sustaining only minor injuries. Inside, the room was shrouded in darkness, save for the faint sputter of a wireless machine. With bated breath, they illuminated the room, revealing a chilling scene. A muffled scream pierced the air, sending shivers down their spines.

The Chief quickly gathered the small papers that fell to the floor, carefully placing them in his pocketbook. Below, the sound of an approaching ambulance echoed loudly. Doctors rushed up the stairs, examining the injured Wolf and applying a bandage to stop the bleeding. As the unconscious Wolf was carried downstairs, a detective attempted to pick up Asa to follow, but Asa resisted, showing his determination. Despite his pain, Asa managed to speak. Timmins then carried Asa downstairs to a waiting car. The group left a guard and proceeded to Mr. Leffingwell's house. Inside, Asa was made comfortable with pillows as they awaited another doctor. As the Leffingwell cook prepared food, Porky and Beany shared their day's events with an eager audience. The doctor later reported that Asa was resting well and suggested he stay for a few days. Timmins agreed, and the group enjoyed ice cream in the shape of little tents.|"['1.

The boys were pleased to see the spacious tents. They focused entirely on the task at hand, setting aside the day's excitement. The Colonel shared a story about two boys similar to Porky and Beany, eager to go on a mission. He believed they would be valuable aides, handling important tasks behind the lines. The Colonel had arranged for them to accompany him. While he had work in Washington delaying his departure, he planned to travel with the boys on a passenger boat soon. Mrs. Potter mentioned that Colonel Bright thought the boys would be useful. Meanwhile, in the hospital, the Wolf and the Weasel slowly recovered from their injuries. The Wolf, discovering the Weasel was his neighbor, worked hard to regain his strength, surprising everyone with his quick progress. When the nurse left him unattended, the Wolf would push himself to move around the room, showing determination in his recovery.|"[""1.

The nurse carefully arranged the Wolf in his chair near the window, checked his bandages, placed a bell within reach, and left magazines on the window sill. After advising him to rest, she departed. As soon as he heard her shoes fade away, the Wolf stood up, tied his robe, and cautiously approached the door. Listening intently, he noticed silence and cracked the door open. Observing a nurse and doctor exit the Weasel's room and enter another, he seized a blue vial from the table. With a sense of urgency, he entered the room, only to find a peaceful, well-made bed.

For the final time in his wicked life, the Wolf's heart was filled with black murder, but the Weasel had managed to escape. The Wolf covered the Weasel's face with a sheet and, grinding his teeth, quietly made his way to the door. As he entered the hallway, he overheard hushed voices and decided to head up a staircase instead of towards his room. Unfortunately, the stairs led upward, not down. Slowly and silently, he ascended, but he thought he heard a faint sound from below. The nurse and doctor, checking on the Wolf, found his room empty, prompting a search. Cursing his luck for being dressed only in underwear and a bathrobe, he knew he had to escape. With the Weasel and Adolph dead, and Ledermann drowned, the Wolf felt trapped. Desperate, he entered a large hall used as a gymnasium for nurses, but found no place to hide. Spotting a fire-escape outside the window, he wasted no time and climbed down, his strength failing. Hearing a commotion above, he saw the nurse and doctor pursuing him. With a sneer, he hurried down the ladder, but dizziness overcame him, and he fell into darkness as the pursuing figures vanished.|"[""1.

Rescued from a tragic fall, the Wolf and the Weasel were placed in the hospital, side by side in the chamber of death. The nurse, knowing the Weasel's fate, moved his stretcher away, refusing to let him rest near the Wolf, even in death. Porky assured the others they would soon return home with tales of their adventures and possibly some treasures. Mrs. Potter expressed her wish for the safe return of her boys.

The boys found the open sea endlessly fascinating. By Sunday, they had thoroughly explored the ship Firefly and befriended the crew, learning a wealth of new information.

"""That's strange,"" pondered the Captain. ""You did a great job saving the ship this time, young man. It seems like you should be on deck when we get to the dangerous area. Come down now for supper. It's not wise to face danger on an empty stomach."" He patted Beany on the back and moved on. The boys realized they had missed dinner. Beany was too anxious to eat, feeling he should keep watch on deck. The Captain sat silently at the table, sharing statistics. Porky and Beany listened, lost in thought. They shared silent conversations, finding comfort in their connection. ""It's quite thrilling, isn't it?"" whispered Porky as they peered over the rail. ""I hope we don't get attacked!

He hurriedly dressed and was soon prepared, just like Porky, who prided himself on being quick. Together, they stealthily navigated through the dim corridor and ascended to the deck. The Firefly swiftly sailed through the turbulent sea, resembling a wild creature. Advancing towards the bow, they spotted the lookout, peering into the vastness. Storm clouds gathered in the east, hinting at an approaching tempest. Walking along the ship, they peered over the stern, watching the churning water from the propeller. Nearby, another crew member scrutinized the sea's surface. As dawn approached, their spirits sank. Suddenly, Beany noticed a swift object approaching the ship. Alarmed, they realized it was a torpedo heading towards them. They rushed the Colonel to safety as the Firefly was struck, causing chaos and prompting the crew to abandon ship in lifeboats.|['1.

The boys nodded, then vanished behind the cabin. The men paused, then rowed away from the sinking ship. They reached safety before the ship sank. The Captain worried about how to tell the boys' families. He found clothes with a belt full of snacks the boys had saved. He wondered why they didn't jump. They rowed hard, avoiding a submarine in the distance. Rain fell heavily, hiding them. They rowed for hours, sharing chocolate. The Colonel remembered the lost boys. The next day, they saw a distant boat. Thirst set in, but the snacks helped. The sun dried their clothes. They spotted one boat, unsure where the others had gone.|"['1.

At daybreak, a miraculous sight unfolded. Emerging from the dawn haze, a large ship materialized in the distance. While initially appearing colossal to the weary eyes of the stranded crew, relief soon arrived in the form of motorboats racing towards them. The captain of the Firefly quickly coordinated with the young officer in charge of the rescue boats, and the exhausted crew was towed to safety.
