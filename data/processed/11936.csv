Mother Goose sat quietly among the red hollyhocks, away from the noisy barnyard, pondering about her precious dozen goslings. She cherished them for being not only adorable but also smart and capable. Unlike Red Hen's chicks, Mother Goose's goslings could find their own food and loved their morning bath in the brook. However, a mysterious threat loomed over the barnyard. Each night, a chicken disappeared without a sound. Little Bantam Rooster blamed the hawk, but Mother Goose doubted it. Even the wise white cock seemed troubled, his once proud comb now drooping. The absence of old Fido, the faithful dog, added to the unease. Mother Goose feared for her goslings and the safety of the barnyard.|"[""1.
