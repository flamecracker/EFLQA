"Longlegs the Blue Heron watched Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter disappear down the Laughing Brook. As long as they were in sight, he sat without moving, his head drawn down between his shoulders just as if he had nothing more important to think about than a morning nap. But if you had been near enough to have seen his keen eyes, you would never have suspected him of even thinking of a nap. Just as soon as he felt sure that the two little brown-coated scamps were out of sight, he stretched his long neck up until he was almost twice as tall as he had been a minute before. He looked this way and that way to make sure that no danger was near, spread his great wings, flapped heavily up into the air, and then, with his head once more tucked back between his shoulders and his long legs straight out behind him, he flew out over the Green Meadows, and making a big circle, headed straight for the Smiling Pool.

All this time Billy Mink and Little Joe Otter had not been so far away as Longlegs supposed. They had been hiding where they could watch him, and the instant he spread his wings, they started back up the Laughing Brook towards the Smiling Pool to see what would happen there. You see they knew perfectly well that Longlegs was flying up to the Smiling Pool in the hope that he could catch Grandfather Frog for his breakfast.

Longlegs the Heron and Grandfather Frog both possess the virtue of patience. Longlegs believes in waiting for what is worth having, a trait passed down from his fishing ancestors. He stands still for hours, waiting for the perfect moment to catch his prey. Grandfather Frog, on the other hand, pretends to be asleep, patiently waiting for his meal while observing Longlegs' every move.

Whitetail the Marsh Hawk soared back and forth above the Green Meadows, searching for a meal. Despite his sharp eyes, the little creatures seemed to have been warned about his presence. Even Mr. Green Snake and Danny Meadow Mouse managed to stay hidden. Only a few grasshoppers were foolish enough to be caught. Determined, Whitetail continued his hunt until he decided to check the Smiling Pool. There, he spotted Longlegs the Blue Heron watching Grandfather Frog on a lily-pad. Whitetail saw an opportunity for a filling meal. However, just as he swooped down, Jerry Muskrat's warning slap alerted Grandfather Frog, who swiftly dived into the pool, leaving Whitetail empty-clawed.

Longlegs the Blue Heron was hungry, waiting for Grandfather Frog to become his meal. But just as he thought he had his chance, old Whitetail the Marsh Hawk swooped in to snatch Grandfather Frog away. This made Longlegs lose his temper. Whitetail, equally hungry, was angered by Jerry Muskrat teasing him and calling him names.

"One sunny morning, Grandfather Frog had a belly full of foolish green flies when Little Joe Otter arrived, carrying a big fish from the river. ""I thought you might like a fish,"" said Little Joe, offering it to Grandfather Frog. Despite being full, Grandfather Frog's eyes sparkled at the sight of the plump fish. He managed to squeeze in a small one. Little Joe, knowing Grandfather Frog's appetite, teased him and gave him the largest fish. The greedy Grandfather Frog gulped it down, but the fish got stuck in his full stomach. Frantically trying to swallow, Grandfather Frog choked.

Grandfather Frog found himself in a tricky situation when he tried to catch a fish but ended up with it stuck in his throat. Little Joe Otter, Billy Mink, and Jerry Muskrat found this hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. They laughed so hard that tears rolled down their cheeks.

With a swift move, Spotty grabbed the fish's tail and, together with Grandfather Frog, pulled it out, causing both of them to fall into the Smiling Pool.

Grandfather Frog was feeling adventurous and decided to explore the Great World beyond the Smiling Pool. He thought he was as smart and agile as Mr. Toad. As he hopped through the Green Meadows under the warm sun, he grew thirsty and longed for the cool waters of the Smiling Pool. Despite the discomfort, he was determined to see the Great World. However, the journey became tough as he encountered tall grass and rough terrain. Exhausted and scared, Grandfather Frog heard footsteps and the sniffing of Bowser the Hound approaching.

Farmer Brown's boy was strolling down the Long Lane when a sudden gust of wind, filled with dust and leaves, startled him. His hat flew off into the garden, and he dropped Grandfather Frog in his confusion. The mischievous Merry Little Breezes were behind this chaos, trying to distract Farmer Brown's boy from Grandfather Frog, who was tied up and in need of help.

When the playful breezes tossed dust in Farmer Brown's boy's face and stole his hat, he accidentally dropped Grandfather Frog without noticing where. Despite this, he was confident he could find him nearby. Just as he began the search, the dinner bell rang. Hungry and worried about missing his meal, he decided to delay the search knowing Grandfather Frog couldn't move far with his legs tied. Meanwhile, the Merry Little Breezes, unaware of this, frantically sought help for Grandfather Frog from his friends who were all out that day.

For a few moments, Striped Chipmunk observed the strange string from atop the weathered fence. Carefully, he descended and cautiously approached the string, taking small steps and pausing to inspect it. The peculiar behavior of the string puzzled him, but as he circled around it, he discovered one end disappearing beneath an old board. Realization dawned on him that someone was hiding under the board, manipulating the string. Curiosity and mischief sparked in Striped Chipmunk's eyes. With a mischievous grin, he seized the string and tugged, revealing Grandfather Frog's bound feet. Startled, Striped Chipmunk released the string, causing Grandfather Frog to retreat under the board. However, upon hearing Grandfather Frog's plight, Striped Chipmunk swiftly gnawed through the string, freeing the grateful frog.

Grandfather Frog boasted while lost in the Long Lane, far from the Smiling Pool. Striped Chipmunk, respecting Grandfather Frog, suggested he return home due to dangers. Grandfather Frog, stubborn and afraid of being laughed at, refused. Chipmunk guided him to a spring, but Grandfather Frog hesitated, thirsty and hot. Accustomed to instant water access in the Smiling Pool, he hurried towards the spring. Grandfather Frog, heedless and foolish, jumped into trouble. His swift jumps towards the spring showed his desperation for water. If Peter Rabbit had witnessed, he would have envied Grandfather Frog's impressive leaps.|"['1.

"Finally, the ground started to feel damp. The further he went, the wetter it became. Soon it was quite wet, with lots of soft, cool, wet moss. Grandfather Frog's tired feet felt so good on it. ""I must be close,"" Grandfather Frog thought to himself as he climbed up a large mossy mound to get a better view. From there, he spotted a small path from the Long Lane. It passed right by the very mound he was on, and he noticed that old boards had been placed where the ground was soft and wet. This puzzled Grandfather Frog a lot. He loves soft, wet mud and couldn't understand why anyone, even Farmer Brown's boy, would prefer a hard, dry path. As he pondered this, he heard a whistle, Farmer Brown's boy's whistle! Grandfather Frog recognized it instantly from the Smiling Pool. The whistle was coming from the Long Lane. Farmer Brown's boy had finished his lunch and was returning to search for Grandfather Frog where he had been left. Grandfather Frog couldn't help but smile, thinking about how surprised Farmer Brown's boy would be when he couldn't find him. But then, the smile disappeared as the whistle drew closer.

Grandfather Frog had always shared wise advice at the Smiling Pool. But when he ventured into the Great World, he forgot to heed his own wisdom.

Farmer Brown's boy discovered a spring long before Farmer Brown did. The boy made the water clear and cold by clearing the area around it. He placed a barrel in the ground, allowing the water to bubble up through clean sand. A hole in the barrel let the water flow out, creating a barrier too high for Grandfather Frog to escape. Feeling trapped, Grandfather Frog despaired of ever returning to the Smiling Pool. The Merry Little Breezes searched for help but found no one. Striped Chipmunk claimed he freed Grandfather Frog, which cheered the breezes. They tried to assist by lowering grass and sticks into the spring, providing Grandfather Frog some comfort.
