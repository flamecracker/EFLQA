"Mr. Cobb carefully guided Rebecca out of the stage and handed her to her aunt Miranda. Rebecca, in turn, presented a bunch of flowers to her aunt, who graciously accepted them. Miss Sawyer, however, disapproved of the term ""lively"" used to describe Rebecca. She believed children should be seen but not heard. Despite the awkward situation, Mr. Cobb left, pondering on a better word to describe Rebecca. Aunt Miranda then directed Rebecca to her room, advising her to keep the mosquito net door closed to keep flies out. She instructed Rebecca on the proper way to hang her belongings and navigate the house. Rebecca, unfazed by the new environment, shared a light-hearted moment with her aunt before settling into her new room, feeling a mix of emotions but eager to explore her new surroundings."|"['1.

"Dear Mother, I have arrived safely. My attire wasn't much wrinkled, and Aunt Jane helped me smooth it out. I find Mr. Cobb quite likable. He chews tobacco but delivers newspapers accurately to house doors. I rode outside with him briefly, then moved inside before reaching Aunt Miranda's house. Even though I didn't want to, I thought you would prefer it. ""Miranda"" is a long word, so I plan to refer to Aunt Miranda and Aunt Jane as Aunt M. and Aunt J. in my Sunday letters. Aunt J. gave me a dictionary to look up challenging words. It's time-consuming, and I'm grateful people can talk without needing to spell. Speaking is easier than writing and more enjoyable. The brick house looks just as you described it. The parlor is magnificent and gives you shivers when you peek through the door. The furniture is elegant, but there aren't many comfortable spots to sit except in the kitchen. The same cat is here, but they don't keep the kittens, and the cat is too old to play with. Hannah once mentioned that you ran away to marry father, and I can imagine it must have been lovely. If Aunt M. were to run away, I think I'd prefer living with Aunt J. She doesn't dislike me as much as Aunt M. does. Please tell Mark he can have my paint box, but I'd like him to keep the red cake in case I return home. I"|"['1.

"Dear Mother,

I am feeling very unhappy this morning. I read about Cora, The Doctor's Wife, in a book. Cora's husband's mother was like Aunt M. to me, cross and unfeeling. I wish Hannah had come instead of me, as Aunt M. wanted her. Hannah is better than I am and doesn't talk back quickly. Are there any pieces of my buff calico? Aunt J. wants some to make a new waist, button behind, so I won't look outlandish. The styles in Riverboro are pretty, and the ones at Meeting are elegant, more than in Temperance.

School is good. The Teacher can answer more questions than the Temperance one, but not as many as I can ask. I am smarter than all the girls but one, not as smart as two boys. Emma Jane can add and subtract in her head quickly and knows the spelling book well but lacks thoughts. She is in the Third Reader but dislikes stories in books. I am in the Sixth Reader, but Miss Dearborn threatens to put me in the baby primer class with Elijah and Elisha Simpson, the little twins, because I can't say the seven multiplication Table.

I am trying for the spelling prize but fear I won't get it. I wouldn't care, but wrong spelling looks terrible in poetry.

"Dear John,

I am reminded of the time when we tied the new dog in the barn, and he bit the rope and howled. I feel just like him, except the brick house is now my barn. I can't bite Aunt M. because I must show gratitude. Education will shape me and help us pay off the mortgage when we're older.

Rebecca's first day at the school in Riverboro Centre was on a Friday. By Monday, she started her education journey at the school, about a mile away. Miss Sawyer drove her there, meeting the teacher, Miss Dearborn, and organizing her books. Rebecca enjoyed walking to school, especially through the woods, with its surprises like colorful mushrooms and waxen Indian pipes. She cherished her lunch and recited her next Friday afternoon piece with joy.

The little schoolhouse on a hill had a simple setup with wooden desks and benches. Rebecca's classroom had twenty students, and she aspired to sit in the back like the advanced students.

"In the school, Rebecca's classes were a mix of different subjects and study partners. She struggled with writing due to spelling and punctuation challenges but excelled in history. Despite her clever thoughts, she faced difficulties in expressing them freely. Rebecca's interactions with Seesaw Simpson, a boy who had trouble making decisions, added a layer of complexity to her school days. Seesaw was fascinated by Rebecca's strong character, even though she often snubbed him. A humorous incident involving a water pail led to Rebecca and Seesaw being reprimanded together. The day ended with a curious choice of song, ""Shall we Gather at the River?"" that seemed to reflect the day's events."|"['1.

"Miss Dearborn glanced at Rebecca's lowered head with concern. The child's complexion was pale, except for two bright red spots on her cheeks. Tears clung to her lashes, her breathing was rapid, and her hand trembled as she held her handkerchief. ""Rebecca, you may return to your seat,"" Miss Dearborn instructed after the first song. ""Samuel, stay put until the end of school. Scholars, I asked Rebecca to stand by the pail to curb her habit of constant drinking, which is merely mindless and aimless wandering. Every time Rebecca requested a drink today, the whole class flocked to the pail like a unit. She is genuinely thirsty, and perhaps I should have reprimanded you for following her lead rather than punishing her for setting it. Alice, what shall we sing next?"" Rebecca settled back in her seat, feeling a weight lifted from her heart by Miss Dearborn's explanation. As the class sang, gestures of sympathy were discreetly offered to Rebecca. Living Perkins, unable to sing, discreetly placed a piece of maple sugar in her lap, while Alice Robinson rolled a new slate pencil to her. The atmosphere lightened, and when Rebecca was alone with the teacher for her grammar lesson, she felt her confidence returning. Miss Dearborn, however, was still uneasy. As the last footsteps faded, Seesaw's penitent glance was met with cold disdain. ""I saw that you couldn't, which is"|"[""1.

Rebecca, a diligent young girl, prepared herself meticulously every day at four o'clock to sew a star on her dress. While sewing, she composed rhymes in her head, dreaming of a role in the upcoming event. Despite others' beauty and wealth, Rebecca's talent shone through, earning her a prominent part. Her humble nature and prayers reflected her disbelief at being chosen. Meanwhile, the town buzzed with gossip about Clara Belle's return and Abner Simpson's thieving ways, which were oddly considerate. Riverboro mourned the loss of Mrs. Simpson's influence over her husband, who was known for his peculiar thefts and rumored habit of selling his wife. Despite the town's colorful characters, Rebecca's quiet determination and talent set her apart.|"[""1.

The Simpson children were known in the area, especially Rebecca, who had a peculiar taste in friends that worried her aunt. Despite Aunt Miranda's disapproval, Rebecca cherished her friendship with Clara Belle. Mrs. Fogg, however, saw potential in Clara Belle and invited her to live with her part of the year to keep her out of trouble. Concerned about Clara Belle's safety, Mrs. Fogg arranged for her to travel by train and stagecoach. Meanwhile, the town of Riverboro was in a frenzy as Mr. Simpson planned to drive Clara Belle to town the night before a flag-raising event. Rebecca, after a meeting, visited the minister to share a poem she had written called 'My Star,' inspired by Mrs. Baxter's words about unity among states.

Rebecca explained that the stars on the flag represent the states and that they had to be placed somewhere, so she chose 'breast' for the West. As she walked, she saw Abner Simpson's wagon with a suspicious bundle that turned out to be the flag. Worried about the flag's safety, she asked Mr. Simpson for a ride to the Centre to discuss Clara Belle. Excited and nervous, she planned to sit on the flag in the wagon to protect it. She also thought of a clever plan involving Mr. Robinson to avoid a confrontation between Mr. Simpson and him.

Rebecca was determined to retrieve the flag from Mr. Simpson, fearing a diplomatic misstep might result in losing it. She remembered Mr. Simpson fondly, especially when he joined the schoolchildren in a Revolutionary War reenactment. To approach him delicately, she mentioned a planned village rally where she would represent Maine. Despite her nervousness, she pleaded with Mr. Simpson not to take the flag to Acreville, emphasizing the effort put into making it. When Mr. Simpson denied having the flag, Rebecca boldly confronted him, revealing she had seen it in his wagon. Overwhelmed by emotion, she clutched the flag tightly, ready to fight for it.

Mr. Simpson, a rather shady character, spotted a bundle on the Meserves' steps and snatched it up, thinking it might contain something useful.
