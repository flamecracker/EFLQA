"I can't wait to see my loyal roommate and chat endlessly. I plan to bring lots of snacks to Wellington for a big celebration. Any small contributions you bring will be greatly appreciated. I'm heading to college a week from next Tuesday. I might get there before you, so I'll have everything ready in our room when you arrive. I have so much to share, but I hate writing letters. You'll have to wait until we're together. If this letter doesn't reach you before you leave El Capitan, you'll probably receive it later after it travels around. Jane chuckled as she reread the letter from Judy, knowing she'd hear funny stories about Judy's absent-mindedness. Judy's letter began with ""WICKED ONE:"" and mentioned their recent experiences posing for a picture. They had to deal with quirky directors but were relieved it was over. Judy was excited to return to Wellington and reunite with friends, especially Jane. She also mentioned Norma finishing her acting engagement and possibly traveling back with them.

"""Alicia Reynolds has returned,"" Judith announced excitedly. ""I saw her arriving with her bags about an hour ago.

""I can't help it. I have to do this,"" Judith replied firmly. ""As Jane's roommate, I feel I have a duty. If Jane decides to room elsewhere, that's fine. But if she's been treated unfairly, as I suspect, then I'll follow her wherever she goes, even if it's off-campus.""

Miss Noble started causing trouble at the beginning of her freshman year. She was bitter because Mrs. Weatherbee gave her room to someone else, thinking she wouldn't return. Miss Noble was upset and even made a scene in front of others. She tried to turn people against her roommates, Adrienne and Judith. Jane and Alicia discussed how Miss Noble's actions were causing problems. Alicia suspected Marian Seaton was behind it all.

Jane was certain that she wouldn't get a response. With a scornful smile, she explained that she only wanted to draw attention to both incidents. Apologizing for not being able to resolve the matter quietly, she asked Alicia to unlock the door. Overwhelmed with emotion, the other girl burst into tears, accusing Jane of being mean and a bully. Despite the outburst, she handed over the paper but vowed to hate Jane forever. As she wiped her tears, she retrieved the paper from a drawer and tossed it towards Jane.

The council approached Miss Rutledge the following day with an extraordinary request - they wanted to play basketball that year but only if Dorothy Martin served as the referee. Dorothy had resigned from the position, not due to being busy, but because she felt Judith Stearns had been treated unfairly during the try-outs.

Jane nodded in agreement, expressing her understanding of the situation. She reassured Dorothy that Firefly and Midnight could share a stall, emphasizing the importance of looking after Midnight's well-being as their father depended on it. Dorothy was thrilled and grateful for the kind gesture. Jane, too, was happy and hoped for more days like this one. She envisioned enjoyable rides with Dorothy.

Suppose we decide on only two treats each month among ten of us. We could each contribute a dollar monthly to a shared fund, totaling ten dollars for the two treats, five dollars each. Throughout the month, we'd aim to save as much of our allowances as possible. Any remaining amount at month-end would go back into the fund. Contributions would be voluntary, given with goodwill. A treasurer would manage a toy bank where we could deposit our contributions discreetly. At the start of each month, the treasurer would tally the funds and deposit them in the Chesterford Trust company. Jane suggested establishing a fund to assist less fortunate Wellington students, as there is no existing College Aid Society. The fund would offer loans without interest, to be repaid at the borrower's convenience, inspired by the 'Beatrice Horton' books where a similar initiative was undertaken at Exley College.|"['1.

Adrienne cautiously turned the door knob and silently opened the door, stepping into the empty room. Three girls followed her quietly, mimicking her stealth. As they peered into the closet, a figure suddenly moved and spoke, startling them. The figure turned out to be a frightened girl, Elsie, who had been eavesdropping. Adrienne sternly commanded her to come out, revealing that she had been caught listening. Elsie, embarrassed and humiliated, emerged from the closet, unable to meet Adrienne's gaze. Adrienne accused her of spying and questioned her lack of shame. Seeing Norma's disappointed expression, Elsie crumbled in guilt, storming off to her bed.

Maizie simply shrugged at the news and continued on her way calmly. She was stronger than her roommate and had decided to face her punishment bravely. Meanwhile, Marian spent the morning in her room feeling sorry for herself, then went for lunch alone, returning to weep in her room. She tried to come up with a defense if Mrs. Weatherbee told Miss Rutledge about their wrongdoing but couldn't find one.
