The first time Johnnie tried to catch Twinkleheels, his playful new pet refused to cooperate. When Johnnie approached with a halter, Twinkleheels snorted and dashed away, teasing Johnnie as he chased him across the pasture. Johnnie's father advised him to entice Twinkleheels with oats. Following his father's suggestion, Johnnie shook a measure of oats and called to Twinkleheels with short whistles. Intrigued by the sound of the oats, Twinkleheels trotted over and eagerly ate from the measure. This approach worked, and Twinkleheels allowed Johnnie to come closer.

Twinkleheels was a well-behaved horse that Johnnie Green had no trouble catching in the pasture. The sight and sound of oats made Twinkleheels forget all about the halter. One day, in a rush to go play with friends, Johnnie grabbed the halter and a grain measure. When he whistled, Twinkleheels knew it was treat time. Excited, Twinkleheels ran to Johnnie, expecting oats. However, this time, something was off. Twinkleheels blew into the measure and snorted, realizing it was empty. He almost got away from Johnnie, grumbling about being rushed to a ball game. Despite feeling mischievous, Twinkleheels assured Johnnie he wouldn't cause any harm, hinting at a harmless prank.|"['1.

Johnnie Green had a pony named Twinkleheels. Even though Twinkleheels was well-behaved, he loved to play tricks. Johnnie discovered that Twinkleheels loved to kick when he threw currants at him. This became a fun game for Johnnie and his friends. They would take turns throwing currants at Twinkleheels and even at the old horse named Ebenezer in the next stall. But Ebenezer was too lazy to kick back. Even Old dog Spot would join in the fun, but his barking would give them away. Despite the noise, Johnnie and his friends always tried to be quiet and sneaky when playing this game behind the barn.|"[""1.

Johnnie Green used to dislike picking currants, finding it dull and boring. However, one day he had a change of heart. When his mother announced that he had to start picking currants after breakfast, Johnnie didn't object, even though he had planned to go swimming. Three boys joined him, and after a hearty breakfast, they set off to pick currants. Farmer Green, suspecting mischief, peeped around the barn and caught the boys flicking currants at each other. Although he appeared stern, Johnnie could tell his father was amused. They worked diligently while Farmer Green watched, but once he left, they got distracted and started playing around. Despite the fun, they managed to pick the currants, just like busy squirrels.|"[""1.

Johnnie Green was busy with work, so his helpers left him to pick currants behind the barn. Twinkleheels, the spry horse, wished for a livelier neighbor than the dozing old horse Ebenezer. Twinkleheels wanted to race Ebenezer to show him some speed. Twinkleheels was quick and lively, while Ebenezer was slow and sleepy. When Twinkleheels tried to chat with Ebenezer, the old horse often dozed off. Despite Twinkleheels' efforts to liven things up, Ebenezer preferred his slow pace. During a race to the bars, Ebenezer surprisingly beat Twinkleheels. After the race, Johnnie Green led them down the lane without a word, with Twinkleheels following behind.|"[""1.

"""Twinkleheels complimented Ebenezer as they neared the barn, admitting he wasn't as slow as he thought. Ebenezer welcomed a rematch, suggesting it would be good practice for Twinkleheels even if he won. Farmer Green's oxen, Bright and Broad, were slow but strong, always ready for hard work. Twinkleheels, although admiring their strength, found them too serious and slow for his liking. He preferred a challenge, like racing Ebenezer.

Twinkleheels was warned by the other animals that Bright and Broad might be faster than he thought. Farmer Green often took them when in a hurry, leaving the others behind. Curious, Twinkleheels approached Bright and Broad the next day. While he shared what the bays had said, they listened with a calm demeanor. The following morning, a snowstorm hit the farm, making it hard to see the barn. Twinkleheels expressed his eagerness to play in the snow like Johnnie Green. Despite doubts about the oxen's speed in the snow, Twinkleheels was surprised when Farmer Green chose them over him. This left Twinkleheels wondering why he was not picked, confident in his ability to navigate the snow better than Bright and Broad.|"['1.

The snowfall finally ceased, and the weather became clear and chilly. Johnnie Green emerged with Twinkleheels, but their journey was short-lived due to the deep snow. Despite Twinkleheels' spirited attempts, he ended up toppling Johnnie into a snowdrift. Farmer Green advised returning Twinkleheels to the barn due to the challenging conditions. Johnnie grumbled about Farmer Green's decision, believing he was more agile than the other horses, Bright and Broad. However, Twinkleheels disagreed, recognizing the older horses' strength. Later, as Johnnie led Twinkleheels out again, he found a path cleared by Farmer Green for Bright and Broad. Eager to prove himself, Twinkleheels rushed into the snow, only to realize the challenge ahead.

Ebenezer and Twinkleheels arrived at the blacksmith shop for new shoes. Familiar with the place, Ebenezer remained calm, but Twinkleheels, a newcomer, felt uneasy.

Twinkleheels, a pony with a mealy nose, faced criticism from the bays for being lazy. The old horse Ebenezer defended Twinkleheels, explaining that mealy noses were common among horses. The bays insisted Twinkleheels help with thrashing, accusing him of being a loafer. Despite the commotion, Twinkleheels tried to communicate with the bays, but the noise from the thrashing machine drowned his whinnies.

Twinkleheels was unlike Ebenezer. He was lively. Johnnie sometimes rode him without a saddle. After the circus men put up posters, Johnnie enjoyed bareback riding.

One sunny day after school, Johnnie Green decided to go fishing at Black Creek. His mother packed him a lunch, he gathered worms for bait, and the hired man lent him a long fishing pole. Johnnie wanted to ride his pony, Twinkleheels, to meet his friends at the creek. Despite his father's suggestion to take the buggy for a more comfortable journey, Johnnie insisted on horseback for a possible race. As he rode Twinkleheels, the pony rarely needed urging, but a shake of the whip could make him jump. On this day, Twinkleheels unexpectedly bolted, breaking only Johnnie's suspenders.
