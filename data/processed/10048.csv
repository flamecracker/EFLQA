"Billie confidently stated, ""I'm not scared,"" as she scanned the dim corners of the room, comforted by the fact that she had locked the door. Around three in the morning, Violet woke up from haunting dreams of being chased by a ghost in a green motor car. As she gazed into the darkness, a strange purring noise startled her.

Billie feared it might be a ghost, while Laura laughed nervously, dismissing it as a machine.

"""That sport seems to belong to the rich,"" Mrs. Gilligan chuckled. ""But let's not skip breakfast. How about bacon, eggs, and biscuits?"" Billie found the room gloomy, with old woodwork and eerie paintings. She hoped to sell the furniture to pay for a statue. The smell of bacon lured them downstairs. They explored the house, avoiding the cellar. After failed attempts at writing, they stumbled upon the attic and found a tiny creature with wings. They enjoyed the farm, picking cherries and exploring the woods. Mrs. Gilligan made pies from the cherries.

Billie hurriedly boarded the train with her friends, worried about being late. Surprisingly, they had plenty of time to spare when they arrived at Roland.
