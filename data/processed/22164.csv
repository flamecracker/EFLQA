Lucy and her friends, accompanied by Mr. Singleton, the father of the fair-haired girls and the parish rector, entered the church porch. Lucy noticed Rosamund's beaming face and asked why she was smiling after church. Mr. Singleton invited Rosamund to spend a day with his daughters. Rosamund, determined and frustrated, planned to disobey her mother and spend the day with Lady Jane. Lucy, curious, asked about her conversation with Lady Jane. Rosamund decided to spend the day alone in contemplation. Jane agreed to keep others away as Rosamund retreated to her room. From her window, Rosamund observed the group dispersing for various activities. Teachers went for a walk, girls went to the river or relaxed in the garden, and the professor stayed in his study with Mrs. Merriman.|"['Question 1: Who invited Rosamund to spend a day with his daughters?\nA) Mr. Merriman\nB) Mr. Singleton\nC) Lady Jane\nD) Lucy\nE) Rosamund', ""Question 2: What did Lucy notice about Rosamund's face when they entered the church porch?\nA) She was crying\nB) She was frowning\nC) She was laughing\nD) She was smiling\nE) She was sleeping"", ""Question 3: What did Rosamund plan to do despite her mother's wishes?\nA) Spend the day with Lucy\nB) Spend the day with Lady Jane\nC) Spend the day with Mr. Singleton\nD) Spend the day alone in contemplation\nE) Spend the day with the parish rector"", 'Question 4: Where did Rosamund decide to spend the day?\nA) At the river\nB) In the garden\nC) With Mr. Singleton\nD) With Lady Jane\nE) Alone in contemplation', 'Question 5: What did Rosamund observe from her window as she spent the day alone?\nA) Teachers going for a walk\nB) Girls relaxing in the garden\nC) The professor staying in his study\nD) All of the above\nE) None of the above', 'Question 6: Who agreed to keep others away as Rosamund retreated to her room?\nA) Lucy\nB) Mr. Singleton\nC) Lady Jane\nD) The parish rector\nE) Jane']"|['B) Mr. Singleton', 'D) She was smiling', 'B) Spend the day with Lady Jane', 'E) Alone in contemplation', 'D) All of the above', 'E) Jane']
She changed her outfit for one of her nicest dresses—a light-blue muslin, expertly crafted. She donned a large, black hat for shade, grabbed her gloves and parasol, and set off on foot towards Lady Jane's home. Unsure of the way, she relied on asking for directions. Once away from the unpleasant girls she referred to as odious, she thought the rest would be easy. She reached the dusty main road sooner than expected, which didn't suit her delicate patent-leather shoes. A kitchen-maid who recognized her mentioned Lady Jane's spirited daughter, Irene, warning her of the challenges she might face. Despite the warnings, she was intrigued and determined to enjoy herself before facing the consequences of her absence from the Merrimans'. Following the maid's directions, she found herself at The Follies, a grand estate with impressive gates leading to a tree-lined avenue. The cool and inviting atmosphere contrasted the hot and dusty road she had traveled. She tidied her appearance and made her way up the driveway, looking elegant and far from an ordinary schoolgirl. She was well aware of the importance of appearances and was keen on making a good impression.

Rosamund was intrigued as Irene passionately spoke. Lady Jane observed from the French window, her expression signaling approval. Rosamund pondered her mission: to help the wild Irene. Despite disapproval, Rosamund found Irene's beauty captivating. She suggested a chat that might change Irene's perspective. Tea with Frosty by the boat was planned for a good time. Irene boasted about her influence at home, not fearing anyone but enjoying unsettling Frosty. Frosty, though scared, stayed due to financial constraints.

Father and I met a governess, Miss Carter, who was leaving The Follies due to Lady Jane's anger. She felt faint and we brought her back to the Rectory.

A month felt like years to me. I was thrilled to get the job, as I am poor and support my elderly mother. Lady Jane offered a generous salary to teach her only child at their country house. However, upon arrival, it was a reign of terror. The child was mischievous, performing somersaults in front of guests and showing no fear of authority. Despite her wild behavior, she was forgiving and not a liar. I advised against trying to reform her due to her wild nature.

""I wonder where she can be?"" Lucy hadn't expected little Agnes to disappear. ""She must have gone to one of the other girls' rooms. We will go to all the others and find out. Of course, I am sorry for you, Irene; but really you went too far when you made use of a hedgehog--such a horrid, frightening thing.""

Each room was searched, and each girl was asked about little Agnes. Phyllis Flower, in excitement and pallor, started from an uneasy dream.

The whole house was awakened, and the alarm given. The Professor was worried and annoyed. He directly told Irene that he believed she was guilty of giving her little companion a fright.

""Suspect me or not as you please,"" she answered, ""but let us find little Agnes. The night is cold; there is sleet falling outside. It will turn to snow before morning. Where is the child?

Irene felt a sudden calm before she remembered Agnes was missing. Despite the cold and desolate shrubbery, Irene rushed to the bower where she found Agnes terrified.

Alas, it is true. But her wrongdoing against Miss Frost seems innocent compared to this. This timid, gentle girl is devoted to Irene, who has changed.
