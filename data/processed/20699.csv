"""Dotty Dimple, also known as Alice, compared the fields to her Aunt Maria's green velvet toilet-cushion full of pins. The spiders had woven gauzy webs over the grass, sparkling like jewels in the sunlight. Dotty thought they would make perfect tablecloths for fairies if they existed. As they arrived at the church, Dotty admired the neat and peaceful people passing by. However, when Jennie Vance approached with her elegant feathered hat, Dotty felt a mix of admiration and envy. Jennie's vanity was evident as she ascended the steps gracefully. Dotty felt disheartened by her own dress, a hand-me-down from Prudy, with a darn in the skirt and lacking accessories. During the sermon, Dotty struggled to focus, counting nails and pipes, observing Mr. Gordon's red silk kerchief for warmth. Joining her class, taught by Miss Preston, Dotty listened to Bible verses, though her understanding sometimes faltered."""|"[""1.

Miss Preston told a story about two little girls in a beautiful house. A poor man asked for help, and one girl gave cheerfully while the other grudgingly shared. Dotty, one of the girls, later encountered a beggar at her home. The man seemed different from the one in the story. Dotty and her friends were puzzled. The man handed a greasy note asking for help. Susy found it amusing. Grandma Parlin suspected the man was not genuine. Dotty, determined, gave all her saved money to the beggar.

None of the little girls responded, not even Prudy. Dotty watched her money disappear into the man's wallet and realized it might not have been a wise decision. The man complained about not being offered any food despite helping them. Feeling upset, Dotty fought back tears, thinking about how others perceived her. Meanwhile, Charlie Gray politely asked Mrs. Parlin if they could use Deacon the horse to go to the mill and if they could have a quart of milk every night. Mrs. Parlin agreed to both requests, pondering Mrs. Gray's nosiness. The children didn't like Mrs. Gray much, finding her overly curious and intrusive. Katie eagerly prepared to fetch Deacon, and Ruth poured more than a quart of milk, prompting Dotty to question the excess.|"[""1.

One evening, Dotty asked her sister Prudy to accompany her to request duck eggs. When they arrived at the acorn tree, Dotty did not pause, as she was hesitant to engage in games with Prudy. Despite promises of hen eggs in return, Mrs. Gray, unsure about Dotty's sociability, was reluctant to grant the eggs due to high demand. However, she couldn't refuse Prudy and handed over thirteen eggs with a warm gesture. The eggs were carefully placed under the white hen, initiating a test of patience for the children as they waited eagerly. On another day, Dotty and Katie blew bubbles, creating beautiful reflections of the surroundings.

"""I heard something that made me very angry,"" said the girl, following her friend into the pantry. ""Mrs. Grant says Mrs. Gray is surprised that your mother doesn't give proper measure when she sells milk!"" ""Ruthie gives too much; almost two quarts,"" replied Dotty, fixing her apron. ""When Katie and I ask for some in our cups, Ruthie says she must make butter. I was thirsty too, grandma, and I thought Mrs. Gray wouldn't mind; I was wrong."" Matters were resolved with Mrs. Gray, who regretted not speaking directly to Mrs. Parlin first. Dotty and Katie resumed carrying milk but stopped playing under the acorn tree. Dotty felt remorse but stood by her honesty. At school, Dotty was upset by Jennie's comments about wealth.

"Jennie sighed as she glanced at her gold ring, feeling less joy than usual. She used to twirl it around her finger, boasting to the girls that it was made of genuine ""carrot gold."" But now, she didn't care much for it. Dotty's bare hand looked nice without any rings. Jennie wondered if people had judged her for wearing the ring, thinking it was a sign of her father's wealth preventing him from entering heaven. Distracted by little Katie's misbehavior, they left without thinking of the ring. On the way home, Dotty reflected on God's love, realizing material wealth didn't matter.

"Jennie complained, ""Oh dear! We've wasted so much time! Why do you always get us into trouble? We won't have many berries left! I wanted to ask my mom for a party."" Dotty limped from a thorn stuck in her foot. They reached the orchard, but the boys had ruined the strawberries. They only found a few. Suddenly, dark clouds gathered, hinting at a storm. Jennie scolded Dotty for not knowing about conductors in storms. Dotty, in pain, kept quiet about her fear of lightning. Jennie then scared Dotty with a tale of a boy sinking in a deep bog.

Dotty had a sudden pleasant thought as she wandered through Mr. Gordon's pasture, realizing it was where Johnny brought the cow every night. Seeing the familiar red and white cow, Dotty chuckled to herself, noting the ground wasn't as soft as she had imagined. Her friend Jennie, following behind, was surprised by the firmness of the ground, having thought there was a swamp in the field. As they approached Mr. Parlin's gate, Jennie hurried home, leaving Dotty to face her grandmother's surprise at her drenched state.

Ruth thought her sister was peculiar as she brewed beer, pondering the odd behavior of her niece. The child, Prudy, was distressed after losing her boots and basket, getting caught in the rain, and stepping on a thorn. Prudy's distress continued as she recounted how her companion, Dotty, behaved unfairly during their outing. Despite the challenges, Prudy managed to light a lamp with some difficulty. The conversation shifted to making up poetry, with Dotty expressing her love for verses. Dotty shared her imaginative plans for the future, envisioning a life with eight obedient daughters. The girls, dressed in finery, would heed her gentle reprimands. The girls would be far from proud and always quick to obey.

Katie was sent to the kitchen for a towel and a basin of water; and very soon Dinah's clothes were removed, and she was rolled up in a pack; like the boy in the swamp, with ""not a bit of her out but the end of her nose."" The child had seized her knitting-work. Her face was flushed and eager. She thought she felt brave enough to open her heart to her grandmother; but when Mrs. Parlin entered the nursery, her face beaming with kindness, Dotty was not ready.
