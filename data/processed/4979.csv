""Must be something the matter with you when you start talking about new-laid eggs, with everything covered in snow and ice. Foolishness is no name for it. Who ever heard of such a thing as a new-laid egg this time of year."" ""Nobody, I suppose,"" answered Blacky. ""I mentioned I was just talking foolishness. You see, I'm so hungry that I started thinking about what I'd have if I could pick anything I wanted. That led me to think of eggs, and I tried to imagine how I'd feel if I suddenly saw a big egg in front of me. I guess I must have mentioned something about it."" ""I guess you must have.

Not long after, Blacky spotted a sight that filled him with joy for keeping a lookout. A swiftly moving black line above the water far down the Big River caught his attention. It was approaching. Blacky recognized it immediately. Glancing over at the hunter concealed behind nearby bushes by the water's edge, Blacky noticed the hunter crouching with his gun aimed, watching the black line. The hunter, too, knew what was approaching - a flock of Ducks in flight. Blacky trembled with excitement rather than fear this time. The Ducks, enticed by the corn scattered in the rushes by the hunter for days, were flying in early without waiting for the usual cover of darkness. Blacky, eager to warn them, let out his danger cry, causing the Ducks to soar high out of the hunter's range. The Ducks circled back and flew off, safe from harm.

Blacky the Crow was perched on a tree, astonished to see Farmer Brown's boy hunting ducks with a gun. Alarmed, Blacky flew to a safer tree but couldn't resist peeking. As he rushed back to the Green Forest before dark, he heard gunshots. The hunter, hidden in a blind, warned Blacky not to disrupt his hunt again. Meanwhile, Farmer Brown's boy was also hiding nearby, ready to take his shot. As the sun set, the hunter awaited the ducks' arrival.

Dusky and his flock swiftly took flight up the river, leaving a disappointed hunter in his blind. The hunter suspected another person hunting nearby had scared off the ducks he was aiming for. As the sun set and the stars appeared, the hunter hoped for better luck next time. The ducks returned, but the sound of another hunter's shots sent them flying away once more.

Early in the afternoon, Blacky the Crow perched in his favorite tree by the Big River. His heart sank upon spotting Farmer Brown's boy with a gun heading towards the river. Instead of his usual hiding spot, Blacky found a new one further down. The hunter arrived earlier than usual and went straight to Farmer Brown's boy's abandoned blind. Disappointed, the hunter returned to his own spot to wait for the Ducks. Just as the Ducks approached, another shot scared them away.

Blacky the Crow flew out of a tall pine-tree silently and headed towards Farmer Brown's cornfield. He perched on a fence post and waited. Soon, Farmer Brown and his boy arrived. Blacky observed them before flying towards the Green Forest to ensure he wasn't being watched. He then flew over to the Old Orchard to scan the area for any danger. Once he felt safe, he sneaked into the henyard, pretending to peck at corn. Slowly, he approached the open door of the henhouse, hesitated, but then decided to go in. Inside, he found two eggs and hesitated again. After a moment of contemplation, he flew up to the box and saw the eggs.
