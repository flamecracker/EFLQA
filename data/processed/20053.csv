"""Bi stands for two,"" explained Dick. ""A bicycle means two cycles, or two wheels. A biplane means two planes, or two surfaces of canvas. This biplane of ours, as you can see, has two surfaces, or decks, an upper and a lower. A monoplane has only one plane, and a triplane has three. Now you understand, don't you, Aleck?""

""I don't reckon I do, Massa Dick. But look here, boys, take my advice and don't try to fly through the air in that bicycleplane, or whatever you call it. It ain't safe at all! Stick to horses, automobiles, and boats on the river. Boys weren't meant to be birds!""

""Huh! An angel, huh? Well, if you go up in that bicycleplane, maybe you will be an angel after you fall out, even if you aren't one when you start.""

Tom responded, ""No, I wasn't. If I did that, Sam might come along and want to name it the _Grace_. Let's call her the _Dartaway_, that is, if she really does dart away when she flies.""

""All right, Tom; that's a great name,"" replied Dick. ""And _Dartaway_ she shall be, if Sam agrees. Now, let's fill that gasoline tank and warm up the engine. It might need some adjusting."""|"['1.

"""Oh no!"" exclaimed Dick, ""But we might race someday, and it's good to know these things."" He headed to the garage with a barrel of gasoline sunk in the ground. Filling a can, he poured it into the biplane's tank. After preparing the engine and lubricating parts, the brothers rolled the biplane to a level field. Staking it down like a circus tent, they started the engine. Suddenly, a rope snapped, releasing the biplane towards their homestead. Tom, knocked down, saw Dick hit by the machine. Worried, he rushed to his brother's side, forgetting about the runaway biplane.

"Tom assured his friends, ""I know we can handle this."" As they sped around a sharp bend, the car lurched, startling Sam and sending Dick tumbling. The foot brake had failed, relying now only on the shaky hand brake. With no time to fix it, they hurtled down a hill, the road hemmed in by rocks and trees. Dick grabbed ropes with hooks, meant for emergencies. Approaching a dangerous turn, Tom steered carefully as the car veered towards a treacherous gully. Miraculously, Tom managed to swerve back onto the road, narrowly missing a carriage. A grinding noise and jerks brought the car to a halt, caused by the hooks getting tangled in the wheels. After a struggle, they freed the car, relieved that the only damage was a flat tire and a broken brake rod."|"['1.

Tom explained how a small fallen tree tied to the rear axle of the car helped slow it down on a hill. After fixing a broken brake rod in Carwood, they continued to the Marley farm. They had to slow down for cows on the road. At the farm, the farmer suggested riding horses to Rocker's Woods. They set off on horseback, with Sam driving.

With care, the three Rover boys cautiously moved through the ancient mill. Despite the brightness outside, the closed doors and dirty windows made the place gloomy. They listened closely, but only Mr. Marley's voice talking to the restless horses could be heard. Carrying barrel staves, they ventured deeper into the mill, exploring room after room. They stumbled over debris left behind when the mill was shut down, with rusty machinery scattered around. A confrontation ensued with Mr. Crabtree, who accused them of false actions. Dick stood firm, warning Crabtree and Tad Sobber to cease their threats against the Stanhopes and the Lanings.

At noon, the group finally finished building a raft to transport the biplane. Hungry from their hard work, they enjoyed a hearty lunch in the shade of the woods, washing it down with water from a nearby spring. As they ate, they discussed their enemies, including Josiah Crabtree and Tad Sobber. Dick then bravely guided the raft down the river, maneuvering carefully to avoid rocks and shallows.

"""Be cautious and take it slow, staying over the cornfield,"" advised the captain. ""And if you turn, make a wide circle."" He believed that a fall in the corn wouldn't be as bad as on hard ground.

Tom and his brother didn't want to wait, so they quickly inspected the flying machine to fix the issue. Once repaired, Tom hopped in, and with the propellers started by his brother and Hans, he soared off, leaving the German lad in awe. Upon returning to the Rover homestead, they were warmly welcomed by the others. Captain Colby, who was inspecting the biplane, stayed for a week to give flying instructions. The boys took flights over Dexter's Corners and Oak Run, causing a stir at the railroad station. Hans shared news about Putnam Hall and encounters with Tad Sobber and Josiah Crabtree. As Hans departed, old Ricks, the stationmaster, was agitated, hinting at a fence dispute. Tom teased him about false news, leaving Ricks flustered.|"['1.

I have been diligently asking about sock colors, Thomas. Storekeepers are unsure about the popular shades. Some suggest Rambler Red, others like Nile Green, and a new shade named Baby's Breath. I prefer Baby's Breath and bought a dozen. I'll wire you if I learn more. Max Spangler and Stanley Browne are heading to Brill. Just before the boys left, Songbird Powell wrote a letter full of joy about their upcoming reunion. The boys left for Brill a day early, with the biplane and luggage sent ahead. Mr. Sanderson met them to drive them to his home. Songbird, a talented college student, will join them soon.

The girl mentioned they only had bundles that didn't resemble a flying machine. She shared about keeping a secret and pretending the bundles were machinery to Mr. Powell. He thought it was for a windmill. Minnie remembered Mr. Flockley's insult but appreciated the Rover boys' help. They stayed at Sanderson's homestead, enjoying dinner and preparing the biplane for assembly. The boys, along with the farmer, worked on the biplane until it was ready. After a delicious meal prepared by Minnie, they had the biplane ready for flight. With a final check, Dick flew the _Dartaway_ into the air, surprising the onlookers below.

The Rover boys were exhausted after a day full of work and excitement. At ten o'clock, they were in their rooms, ready for bed. As Tom and Sam began to take off their shoes, there was a quiet knock on the door, and Bob Grimes appeared. He warned them in a cryptic manner to guard their biplane closely to prevent any harm. The eldest Rover, Dick, had already taken precautions by hiring Abner Filbury to watch over the biplane with a shotgun. The next day, the boys were too busy to do more than check on the biplane. They later took a flight to the Sanderson farm, where they surprised Songbird and Minnie. Minnie treated them to apple pie and milk before they returned to order a new engine for the biplane.

Poor Tubbs got in, and suddenly his hat was replaced with a tall, white beaver. Medals of tin and brass were pinned to his coat, and the crowd cheered loudly. ""Let's go! Everyone, get in!"" Tom exclaimed. With a crack of a whip, the strange carriage started, with Tubbs looking more confused than ever on the seat. The students in the carryall behind him were yelling and singing.

During a carriage ride, poor Tubbs faced a surprising and chaotic reception from a mob. Flowers and vegetables were hurled at him, causing a commotion. Tubbs, overwhelmed, leaped out of the carriage and dashed away, seeking refuge in a dormitory. Mistakenly believing he had been knighted, Tubbs thanked his friends for the unexpected honor. Meanwhile, the Rover boys, including Tom and Dick, were focused on their studies at Brill. A football game brought excitement to the college, and the Rovers celebrated Brill's victory with a carriage ride and a festive evening with Dora, Nellie, and Grace.

During a sunny afternoon, the three Rover brothers planned a trip to Hope Seminary in their aircraft, the _Dartaway_. The weather was calm, and despite the dropping temperature, they were prepared with warm aviation gear. Sam and Tom had recently tested the biplane and confirmed it was ready for flight. They reminisced about their previous adventures, including a visit to the Dawson farm where they encountered Dan Murdock, who shared a sighting of two suspicious individuals, Koswell and Larkspur, near Hope Seminary. The boys' father, Mr. Anderson Rover, received threatening letters from Josiah Crabtree and Tad Sobber demanding money, leading to heightened security measures on the farm. Despite the tension, the boys remained hopeful and vigilant, awaiting updates from their father while staying determined to assist in any way they could.|['1.

"The boys wasted no time. Dick and Tom dashed towards the aircraft, and soon the motor's loud roars filled the cool fall breeze. All the boys hopped aboard. Dick steered the _Dartaway_ swiftly. Sam glanced back, spotting Grace rushing towards Hope Seminary. ""Maybe they are!"" exclaimed Dick. ""It's just like them to team up with Crabtree and Sobber. They're desperate for cash and all expect a big cut.""""I agree, Tom. They must've realized they couldn't reach the farm or Mrs. Stanhope and Mrs. Laning.

Si was crossing when zoom! bang! whoosh! that auto flew past him like lightning!

The journey led the boys through dense woods, where they sailed cautiously to avoid missing the car they were tracking. Mistakenly spotting a carriage, they pressed on. A man mentioned seeing the elusive vehicle on a rough road, sparking concern about foes tampering with their aircraft. Determined to secure their machine, they rushed back, braving strong winds that threatened their flight. Battling gusts, they struggled to stay on course until a fierce wind forced a rough landing near trees. Securing the aircraft, they ventured through challenging terrain to reach the road, facing obstacles along the way.

"All listened intently, hearing a farm wagon's slow progress over the rocky road, concealed by trees. The wagon appeared, carrying freshly-cut wood, drawn by two white horses. An elderly colored man rode, explaining fearfully, ""I saw something, but I didn't do anything wrong. One man threatened me not to talk."" He mentioned the distress of some people on the wagon. Determined to help, the boys decided to use the horses to save two girls and bring the men to justice. The old man, astonished, watched as they took the horses and rode towards a deserted village.

Three shots rang out as the boys aimed at the car. One hit the back lamp, shattering the red glass, while another struck the differential case. The car sped away, leaving the boys behind. Hearing screams from the girls, the boys decided to cross the stream. Finding a way across the shallow water, they promised the colored man, Ike Henry, good pay to wait for them. Climbing over the sunken bridge, they reached the other side and raced after the car. They managed to ride horses to catch up. As they ventured into the woods, Dick led the way with a lantern. They encountered mud but managed to pull Tom out. Moving forward cautiously, they left the swamp behind and continued their pursuit.|['1.

Once again, the three Rover boys turned around and carefully examined every inch of the trail. They passed the swamp once more and realized where they had taken a wrong turn. They quickly moved ahead, navigating through the trees and bushes. The night had fallen, enveloping them in darkness, with only the dim light from the lantern and a few stars peeking through the treetops. The surroundings were quiet, except for the occasional sounds of tree toads and frogs in the swamp. They hung the lantern on a tree branch and illuminated the lights on the biplane to prevent any accidents in the dark. After positioning the biplane in a clearing, they boarded the craft, with Dick at the wheel. The _Dartaway_ soared into the starlit sky as Sam guided them using a pocket compass. As they approached Fremville, they searched for a safe landing spot, eventually touching down unnoticed in a field behind the town's houses.|['1.

The boys quickly left the man in charge of their plane and dashed to the town's main street and then to the barber shop. Despite the busy barber, Jim Hickey, he paused to help the Rover boys. A customer mentioned that the bridge was closed for repairs, indicating that the abductors might be nearby. The boys, armed and determined, set off in pursuit, guided by the moonlight and stars. As they scanned the road to Plankville and Bulltown, they spotted bright lights approaching. The boys landed their plane and readied their pistols. The men in the approaching vehicle cheered as the boys continued their chase, circling back whenever they reached a side road.

With a lantern in hand, Dick led the way, followed by the others. They covered several hundred feet until they halted and stared at each other. The tracks of a touring car led from the road into a big field backed by what seemed to be a dense woods. Tom's advice was heeded, and the three Rover boys hurried back to the _Dartaway_. With no wind, they easily rolled the machine on its wheels to a field where the fence was down. They ran the biplane across and into some trees and bushes. Ready to continue the search, Dick led with a stick and lantern, followed closely by Tom and Sam. They had to bend low to follow the car tracks. The trail led through the trees to a road used for timber hauling. After about a quarter-mile, they found a dark object near the road's end. With ears strained, they listened for any sound of the people they were after but only heard night bird calls and an owl's hoot.|"['1.

After the chauffeur revealed the plan to the Rover boys, they felt a sense of urgency to find Dora and Nellie. The girls were in trouble for insulting a teacher, and the boys knew they had to act fast. The old professor wanted to hide the girls with a relative to avoid any scandal. The boys were determined to rescue their friends, despite the chauffeur's protests. As they hurried through the woods, they stumbled upon an abandoned stone mansion. The decaying structure seemed like the perfect hideout for the culprits. The boys watched as the villains nailed slats across a window, unaware of being followed.

Dick and Sam quickly headed back to where they had parked the chauffeur and the large touring car. They dashed through the dark forest path, tripping over rocks and roots. Sam fell once, but he got up without a word of complaint. Once they found the chauffeur, they secured him in the car and adjusted the lamps. Sam was to watch the prisoner while Dick drove. They sped towards Plankville at thirty miles per hour. Upon arrival, the sheriff's office was quickly reached. The chauffeur was interrogated and placed in custody.
