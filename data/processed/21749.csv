Long ago, ships were not known to men, and the vast oceans were left to the sea-gulls. However, boats have a long history, likely crafted by the earliest humans. These boats might have been simple, made from fallen tree stumps or bundles of rushes. Imagine our ancestors using these primitive vessels to cross rivers and small lakes. Ships, on the other hand, are a more recent invention. If you ever find yourself drawn to ships, remember that loving ships doesn't necessarily mean you'll love the sea. Some do, and some don't. Think carefully before setting sail; it's a decision that should not be taken lightly. Boys, especially, have a fascination with boats and ships. They build them, sail them, and sometimes even graduate from toy boats to real ships. So, if you ever dream of the sea, remember to approach it with a philosophical mind and only set sail if you truly can't resist its call.|"['1.

Long ago, people faced discomfort with wet feet during long voyages. To improve this, they bound logs together with twigs, creating rafts. As time passed and tools advanced, they flattened the rafts and hollowed out logs to make canoes. Eventually, they crafted light wooden frameworks covered with bark or skin. With the invention of saws and iron tools, planks were formed, and the first boats were created. These boats, although clumsy, marked a significant advancement. From small coracles to larger boats, people began exploring rivers and oceans. War-galleys were built for protection, and mariners ventured further from shore using stars for navigation. The ark, built by Noah under God's direction, saved his family and animals from a great flood. This biblical event is echoed in traditions worldwide, showing the enduring impact of this ancient mode of transportation.|"['1.

"The ark, although not built for sailing, was a remarkable vessel designed to float on water. It weathered turbulent waves for seven months before resting on Mount Ararat. Built of gopher-wood, it was around 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet deep. The ark had three stories, a window, a door, and was pitched inside and out. It lacked masts and a rudder, relying on divine guidance. The Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Hebrews were early mariners, with the Phoenicians trading across the Mediterranean and possibly reaching the Atlantic around 1000 B.C. The Phoenicians' voyage around Africa predated modern explorers by centuries. The ancient _Argonauts_ embarked on a quest for the ""Golden Fleece"" in 1250 B.C. using the ship Argo.

"The rafts used on the large rivers of America are unique. Many of them transport logs, not goods, to market. These ""lumber-rafts"" are massive, with navigators spending weeks on them. They build huts, cook on board, and live comfortably. When approaching rapids, logs are released and reassembled after passing the rough waters. Some daring individuals even built solid ships from logs, crossed the Atlantic, then sold the ship as timber. Rafts have saved lives but also prolonged suffering. Canoes, possibly invented after rafts, were used by North American Indians, made of thin wood covered with birch bark, sewn with pine roots and gum. They are light and propelled with paddles. A tale recounts fur-traders narrowly avoiding a waterfall in the backwoods. Their canoe teetered on the edge before they escaped the perilous current."|['1.

The entire event unfolded in mere moments, yet the intense rush of emotions experienced by the voyageurs was indescribable. The abrupt shift from calm safety to the brink of imminent danger, only to be saved in the end, was a profound experience. Such incidents are common in the wilderness, often overlooked once the peril has passed. These moments serve as reminders of our mortality, awakening us to the fragile thread that suspends us over the abyss of eternity. Eskimos in the Arctic employ canoes made of wood frames covered in seal-skin, with a hole in the center for the paddler. These kayaks are waterproof and agile, allowing Eskimos to navigate icy waters with ease.

"The large double canoes owned by the chiefs of the South Sea islands are impressive vessels. They can reach lengths of nearly seventy feet, yet are only about two feet wide and three to four feet deep. The sterns are notably tall, standing fifteen to eighteen feet above the water. These canoes, whether for war or trade, are propelled by paddles. They are often capsized in rough seas, but the skilled islanders can right them and climb back in. Despite their swimming abilities, their main concern is shark attacks. An account from ""Polynesian Researches"" tells of a group of chiefs and people who, after their canoes were destroyed in a storm, were attacked by sharks while adrift on a makeshift raft. The survivors eventually reached shore, having narrowly escaped the jaws of the predators.

The South Sea islanders had distinct types of canoes, with the fishing boats adorned with ugly faces and shells for eyes, while the war canoes were magnificently decorated with black feathers. The canoes were propelled by small, oval-shaped paddles, allowing them to move swiftly on the water. Single canoes were deemed safer for long voyages than double canoes, as they were less likely to be torn apart during storms. Despite being capsized, the islanders were skilled swimmers and could quickly right their canoes by bailing out the water. In a particular incident involving Europeans, a canoe overturned, and the passengers were rescued by the natives and the queen of the island. The South Sea islanders were known for their savagery, practicing cannibalism and wearing minimal clothing.

"In an earlier section, we discussed the growth of commerce and maritime activities by the Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Hebrews in the Mediterranean. These ancient seafarers used boats and ships for their trading ventures. Initially, simple boats like rafts and canoes were used, which later evolved into larger vessels resembling small ships as trade expanded. These ships were propelled by massive oars requiring many rowers for speed. While detailed information on ancient ship structures is scarce, historians have gathered diverse data to paint a picture of how these vessels operated. Homer's ""Odyssey"" sheds light on shipbuilding practices around 1000 B.C., offering insights into the geography and ship technology of the time. Notably, the story of Ulysses showcases the construction of a ship to aid his journey back home, illustrating the shipbuilding knowledge of that era. The ancient Greeks and Romans classified ships based on the number of rows of oars, with elaborate vessels like Ptolemy Philopator's massive forty-tiered ship. These ships utilized square sails and simple rigging, steering with large oars and employing beaks for naval combat."|['1.

The Corinthians were early adopters of triremes in their navy around 700 B.C., pioneering naval strength. Athenians followed suit, building a robust fleet for both war and trade. Ancient ships were light; Greeks even dragged them ashore at Troy's siege. Mariners feared the deep sea and relied on stars for navigation, lacking compasses. Sails were linen or hemp, dyed in colors. Romans, initially weaker at sea, built a fleet to rival Carthage, using a captured ship as a model. They innovated with towers for warriors and baskets for javelin throwers. Romans enjoyed sea-fight displays, with captives battling to death. Crusades spurred maritime advancements, leading to Venice's rise as a maritime hub after barbarian invasions in 476. Veneti settlers evolved into skilled sailors, transforming marshlands into the iconic city of Venice.|"['1.

During the Crusades, Christians fought against the Turks for two centuries in the name of peace. This led to Europeans developing a taste for Eastern luxuries. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, and Florence saw their fleets loaded with jewels, silks, and spices. Nations like the Normans, Danes, and Dutch also joined naval activities. France's navy emerged under Philip Augustus. This sparked a mingling of nations, exchanging arts, languages, and knowledge. The West's demand for Eastern goods grew, fostering wealth and expanding knowledge. Northmen, like the Angles, Saxons, and Vikings, were renowned navigators and warriors, establishing naval power. King Alfred laid the foundation for Britain's maritime dominance. These early seafarers, lacking modern tools, still explored and discovered lands like Iceland and parts of America. Adventurous travelers like Marco Polo further unveiled the East, shaping modern geography. The invention of the mariner's compass revolutionized navigation, marking a new era in mankind's history.|"['1.

"The sailor's compass is a small steel bar magnetized to point north and south. A card above or below the needle shows the cardinal points, like north, south, east, and west, with subdivisions for precise directions. The mystery of why magnetized steel behaves this way remains unsolved. ""Boxing the compass"" means naming the points correctly, like north-east and south-west, which sailors can recite easily. For instance, north, north-east, east, and so on. The sea language drops the ""th"" in north and south when combined with other points, like nor'-east.

The invention of the compass, known to the Chinese before 121 AD, revolutionized maritime navigation. The Chinese utilized magnetized needles, floating them in water to find direction. They even observed the needle's slight deviation from true north. By the 14th century, the compass had a significant impact on sea travel. The Chinese also used iron fish-shaped needles. Arabian sailors substituted needles with a magnetized iron fish, which floated in water pointing north. Ships used the compass for navigation by aligning the compass with their true course. Despite obstacles like wind, currents, and leeway, sailors kept track of their course using dead-reckoning, noting hourly progress and adjusting for external factors. The compass, a simple yet vital tool, transformed the way ships navigated the seas.|"['1.

In the past, sailors had no ocean charts for guidance. They relied on the stars to navigate. By observing stars' positions relative to their course, sailors could estimate the direction to return to their starting port. The compass showed their current course, the log determined their speed, and chronometers kept track of time. Sailors used dead-reckoning to successfully complete long sea voyages. The log, a simple triangular device attached to a line, measured the ship's speed. Every hour, the log was thrown overboard, and sailors counted knots on the line to calculate the ship's speed. Despite advancements in navigation tools like the quadrant and chronometers, dead-reckoning remains essential as it doesn't rely on visible celestial bodies. The quadrant helps determine latitude, while chronometers aid in finding longitude.|"['1.

When a ship's latitude and longitude are determined, a line drawn through the parallels and meridians pinpoint the ship's exact location. As ships improved in size and design, seafarers grew braver with advanced tools like the compass, cannon, and gunpowder. The Portuguese began maritime exploration, rediscovering the Canary Islands in 1330 due to a French ship's stormy mishap. By the fourteenth century, Spaniards ventured further, discovering new lands like the Azores and the Madeira Islands. Prince Don Henry of Portugal led expeditions, uncovering the Cape of Good Hope in 1486. To build a model boat, study various boat shapes and make detailed drawings from different angles.

To start building a model boat, first, draw a straight line down the center of the deck and continue it to the stern, along the block's bottom where the keel will be, and up to the bow. This line is crucial for accuracy. Use compasses to find the center of each surface. Draw lines on each side of the center line to outline the keel and stern-post thickness. On the block's upper surface, draw the boat's shape based on a bird's-eye view diagram. Create a pattern for half of the stern on thin cardboard, cut it out, and apply it to both sides of the stern-post for symmetry. Repeat this process for the bow. Carve the boat's sides and bottom until the bow and stern resemble the diagrams. Saw off parts of the bow and stern for the right slope, following marks on the keel. Use molds for precise symmetry between sides. Finish one side before the other to ensure uniformity. The keel can be made by pouring melted lead into a groove cut into wood or nearly dry clay. Fishing boats, known as luggers, are prevalent in Norfolk and Suffolk for herring-fishing. They use nets with corks and leads to catch fish.|"[""1.

"A model boat is best rigged with just one mast and lug-sail, or at most two masts and sails. Three are unnecessary and cumbersome. Each sail should be attached to a yard that can be raised or lowered using a block or pulley near the top of the mast. The positions of these yards and the sail shapes are better understood by looking at an illustration. Sprit-sails, which are fore-and-aft sails, are sometimes used in boats. These sails are kept taut by a sprit instead of a yard. The sprit is a long pole that extends diagonally across the sail from the lowest innermost corner near the mast to the highest outermost corner. While convenient for tacking, sprit-sails can be risky in squally weather. For model boats and pleasure boats, a main-sail like that of a sloop or cutter without a boom, and a triangular fore-sail extending from near the mast to the bow or bowsprit are recommended. Racing boats are long, low, narrow, and light, some requiring extended iron rowlocks for oars. The ""Rob Roy"" canoe, a popular racing and pleasure boat, can hold only one person but has seen numerous improvements in construction. Its design is akin to the Eskimo kayak but made entirely of wood and equipped with a mast, lug-sail, and jib.

In the world, there are many interesting boats. Some have lateen sails, which are big triangular sails. Inflatable boats made of India-rubber can support several people when inflated and can be carried easily when deflated. Lifeboats are essential for saving lives during sea disasters. Grace Darling, a brave young woman, became famous for her heroic act of rescuing shipwrecked individuals. She lived on a remote island managing a lighthouse with her family. Despite the dangers of the sea, Grace showed incredible courage and strength. The Farne Islands, where she lived, were treacherous, with strong currents and sharp rocks. Grace Darling's selfless act during a storm in 1838 saved many lives and earned her lasting admiration.|"['1.

The sailors on the boat faced a perilous situation as they battled the wind and tide. Despite their efforts, they couldn't reach the anchor and had to make a tough decision. The coxswain decided to cut the cable and steer the boat across the treacherous Goodwin Sands. As they waited for the tide to rise, the anchor began to drag, forcing them to hoist the sail and attempt to navigate away from the Sands. Despite their best efforts, the boat was struck with great force by the powerful waves. The crew, determined and resilient, held on as the boat was tossed from one sandbank to another by the relentless waves.

Lifeboats play a crucial role in saving lives and preventing disasters at sea. In a notable incident in 1858, the Southwold lifeboat capsized in rough weather, but the crew, equipped with cork belts, managed to swim ashore safely. In another case, a self-righting lifeboat from Dungeness set out to rescue a crew that had abandoned their wrecked vessel. However, the lifeboat itself capsized in treacherous waters but quickly righted itself, allowing the crew to return to shore. These lifeboats, operated by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, are vital in saving lives and property along the coasts of the United Kingdom. Additionally, lightships equipped with lanterns and distinctive balls provide warnings to passing vessels, helping to prevent maritime disasters. The crew on lightships work on a rotation basis, ensuring continuous monitoring of the waters.|['1.

We spent a week aboard the _Gull_ lightship and witnessed a dramatic event one night when the lifeboat was called out. Here is a letter we wrote about the experience. On March 26, 1870, I saw the _Germania_ of Bremen wrecked on the South-Sand-Head from the _Gull_ lightship off the Goodwin Sands. The distress signals were spotted from the _South-Sand-Head_ lightship, prompting us to fire rockets to warn others. Despite the distance and gale, our signals were not initially seen by the look-out on Ramsgate Pier. We continued firing rockets until finally, we received a response from Ramsgate. The intense cold and strong wind made the rescue efforts challenging, but we persisted in our attempts to alert and assist those in need.|"['1.

The crew of a wrecked vessel, seven men, had successfully reached the _South-Sand-Head_ lightship after their ship was wrecked. They were then rescued by the Deal lifeboat and brought safely to Deal. The crew of lifeboats in the region near Goodwin Sands often face challenging situations, being called out multiple times in a night to rescue crews of wrecked ships. The steam-tug plays a crucial role in these operations, being able to tow lifeboats repeatedly to reach ships in distress. The crews work tirelessly to save lives and salvage materials from wrecks.

In a shipyard, various vessels are under construction or repair. Dry docks, which can be closed off from the tide, are used to repair ships' lower hulls. Small ships can be beached during low tide, but for larger vessels, dry docks are essential. These docks are flooded when the tide is high, allowing ships to enter. Once inside, the water is drained, and the ship is propped up for repairs. When ready, the ship is refloated to continue its journey. Docks are not just for repairs; they are also for loading and unloading ships. The keel, the first part of a ship laid down, is crucial for stability and structure. The stem-post and stern post are then added, forming the front and back of the vessel.|"[""1.

The stern-post, rising from the keel, holds the planking and the vital rudder. The rudder, a small but crucial part, guides the ship at the mariner's will. Despite its size, the rudder's impact is immense. It's likened to Scripture, where ships, steered by a small helm, follow the governor's direction. A tiller on deck moves the rudder, but in larger ships, ropes and pulleys connect to a wheel for easier steering. Ribs, like bones, support the ship, while planks, fastened by tree-nails, form the hull. Beams bind the sides, decks serve as floors, and bulwarks protect the upper deck. In warships, bulwarks double as hammock-nettings for airing hammocks and shielding crew from musketry.|['1.

The wheel, typically found at the stern or sometimes amid-ships on an elevated platform, helps steer the ship. The binnacle, located in front of the wheel, houses the compass for navigation. The capstan, situated on the main-deck, is used for tasks requiring great tractive power, like drawing in cables or warping the ship. The galley, the ship's kitchen, is small but functional, with a cook overseeing operations. The ship's hull is coated with tar for weather protection, and some vessels have copper sheathing for added defense. Ships are launched stern-first and later equipped with masts and sails. The launch involves sliding the ship on cradles down an inclined plane into the water. Lower-masts are installed using a shear hulk, a floating crane-like structure. Rigging is then set up to complete the ship's construction.|['1.

Ships have different sizes and shapes of masts that all serve the same purpose of supporting the sails. Large vessels have lower masts made up of multiple pieces for strength, fastened together with iron hoops. Masts are divided into three parts: the lower-mast, top-mast, and top-gallant-mast. Most large ships have three masts: the main-mast, fore-mast, and mizzen. Each mast has three parts, and they are named in order: Fore-mast, Main-mast, Mizzen-mast, Fore-top-mast, Main-top-mast, Mizzen-top-mast, Fore-topgallant-mast, Main-topgallant-mast, Mizzen-topgallant-mast. The parts of the masts are secured by cross-trees and caps. The tops of the masts have trucks with pulleys for hoisting flags. Shrouds and stays are thick ropes that keep the masts in place, and they are connected to the chains on the ship's sides. These ropes prevent the masts from falling sideways, forward, or backward.|['1.

"Sailors use ""reef-points,"" small ropes on sails, to reduce sail size during storms. Phrases like ""taking in a reef"" mean reducing sail size. Further reduction is ""furling,"" folding the sail close to the yard. Reefing is dangerous work during storms, with sailors climbing masts. Yards, except the largest three, are hoisted with halyards. The bowsprit is a mast projecting from the bow, holding jib-sails and flying-jibs. Ship deck openings are ""hatches,"" staircases are ""companions,"" and pulleys for hoisting are ""blocks."" ""Braces"" secure sails, ""taut"" means tight. The ""weather"" side faces the wind, ""lee"" side is sheltered. ""Starboard"" is right, ""port"" for left to avoid confusion. ""Heaving the lead"" measures sea depth. The forecastle is for sailors, called ""foge-s'l."" Coasting-trade in the British Islands is risky but active, transporting goods between regions.

"A sloop is a type of boat with only one mast and sails that are spread fore-and-aft, parallel to the sides of the vessel, not across it. The term ""fore-and-aft"" comes from the front and back of the ship. Sails on a sloop are spread along the length of the ship, not across it like on a square-rigged ship. A sloop typically has four sails: a mainsail, fore-sail, gaff, and jib. The main-sail is the largest and is behind the lower mast, reaching from near the deck to the top of the mast. The gaff is a smaller sail used in lighter winds. The fore-sail is a triangular sail on the fore-stay, and the jib is on the bowsprit. In stormy weather, sails may be reefed or taken down. Vessels can lie-to or scud under bare poles in severe storms."|['1.

Sailing vessels use the wind to move in different directions. By adjusting the sails and the position of the masts, ships can sail against the wind or with a side wind. Lighters are small vessels used for unloading cargo in harbors. They have a sloop rig and are not decked, making them more like boats than ships. Cutters are elegant pleasure yachts that are faster but less stable than lighters. Schooners have two masts and carry various sails like the main-sail, gaff, fore-sail, and staysail. Their design allows them to be efficient with fewer crew members. Understanding how sails and masts work together helps ships navigate in different wind conditions, enabling them to sail close to the wind and even against it.|['1.

In our study of ship designs, we now focus on the brig. This vessel typically surpasses schooners in size and often rivals full-sized ships. Brigs are characterized by having two masts, both equipped with square-rigging. This rigging design makes brigs highly functional, especially in foreign trade. The advantage of square-rigging lies in the ease of sail management with smaller, numerous sails that require fewer crew members. As ships grow in size, the necessity for square-rigging increases. The main-sail is positioned on the aft mast, followed by the main-top-sail and main-top-gallant-sail. Additional sails like the royal, boom-main-sail, and try-sail enhance the brig's maneuverability. Studding-sails are auxiliary sails used in fair and light winds. The fore-mast carries fore-sails, fore-top-sails, and fore-royals, complemented by fore-stay-sails, jibs, and flying-jibs. Brigantines combine square and sloop rigging, while barques feature three masts, with the main mast being the central one.|['1.

"The term ""clipper"" refers to a sharp and sleek design that ensures high speeds, seen in various vessels like sloops, yachts, and ships. A clipper barque is known for its speed. Clippers have sharp bows and sails that are cut precisely to be flat for optimal sailing. The masts of clippers lean backward to enhance speed. Full-rigged ships have all three masts square-rigged, with additional fore-and-aft sails. The mizzen-mast is smaller and carries sails like the spanker, mizzen-top-sail, and mizzen-top-gallant-sail. The British Navy began under King Alfred, who had a fleet to fight the Danes. England's maritime strength grew during the Plantagenet period. Edward III's navy had many ships for an invasion, mostly merchant vessels converted into warships.

During the reign of Henry the Seventh, the English navy saw significant advancements. The construction of the Great Harry marked a new era as the first large ship built directly for the Royal Navy. Prior to this, England relied on vessels from maritime towns for defense. The Great Harry, completed in 1488, introduced port-holes for cannons on the lower deck, a groundbreaking feature. Subsequently, King Henry's Grace de Dieu surpassed the Great Harry, boasting a massive size of one thousand tons, with a crew of seven hundred and up to one hundred and twenty-two guns. This period marked England's rise as a dominant naval power, facing challenges from the French, Spanish, and Dutch. The transition from wooden ships to ironclads signaled a new chapter in naval warfare, with advancements in ship armor and weaponry shaping the future of maritime combat.|"[""1.

The construction of ironclad warships faces numerous challenges. Balancing invulnerability against enemy fire, crew protection, speed, and maneuverability at sea presents a complex dilemma. Building a ship impervious to enemy guns may render it unmanageable and unsafe. Achieving a balance is crucial, yet challenging. New armor-plated warships emerge each year, but their seaworthiness remains a critical question. Steam-rams and turret-ships are among the most formidable types, armed with steel beaks or shot-proof turrets. The American civil war saw the debut of these vessels, with the Merrimac and Monitor becoming iconic. The Merrimac, converted from a wooden frigate, demonstrated the power of iron-plated steam-rams in combat. The ongoing evolution of warship design emphasizes iron construction, compartmentalization for damage control, and turret-mounted weaponry.

The initial documented evidence of steam navigation dates back to 1665, in a text by the Marquis of Worcester mentioning engines on boats. Various attempts were made by creative individuals over time. While Papin of France created a steamboat in 1690, it was destroyed by jealous watermen. Jonathan Hulls and M. Genevois made successful models in the 1700s, but no significant progress followed. Mr. Miller, Mr. Taylor, and Mr. Symington played crucial roles in advancing steam propulsion just before the era of steam navigation began. However, the credit for introducing steam navigation goes to Mr. Fulton of America.

In 1812, Henry Bell launched the first passenger steamboat, the _Comet_, on the Clyde River, following America's example. The _Comet_ was a small vessel with engines of three horse-power, but it proved its worth over two years of regular service. Soon after, in 1813, the _Argyle_ was launched, becoming the first European steamer to navigate the open sea-coast. Despite facing skepticism and surprise, these steamboats demonstrated their value and success. During a journey to London, the _Argyle_ encountered challenges with its paddle-wheel blades but managed to navigate through rough seas with the power of its engine.

"The saying ""Many men, many minds"" emphasizes how diverse people's thoughts can be. Similarly, each nation's ships reflect its unique identity, just like its clothing, homes, and food. Even in Europe, where cultures are blending, marine architecture varies greatly. For example, Dutch galliots are sturdy sea vessels with a rounded hull, bright yellow color, and clean, cozy living quarters for the captain's family. These ships are equipped with square and fore-and-aft sails, showing a blend of tradition and practicality. Off the coast of Portugal, trading schooners stand out with their broad beams and unique rigging, making them capable sea vessels despite their unusual appearance. Among Portuguese boats, the Lisbon bean-pod is described as the most distinctive, resembling a bean-pod turned on its edge with masts and sails.

"Crafts on the waters vary across different continents, each with its unique features. In Europe, the gondola is renowned for its romantic allure. Africa boasts the diabiah, a cozy boat ideal for warm climates. Asia showcases a diverse range of vessels, including the dhow, known for its sharp bow and distinctive sail. The catamaran in Madras, made of logs, serves as a crucial link between ships and the shore. Chinese junks, with their yellow sails and ornate cabins, present a picturesque sight. These junks often house a temple, where crew members offer incense for safe voyages. In China, a significant portion of the population lives on boats, creating floating communities anchored along the riverbanks. The river lifestyle in China is akin to the aquatic tales of old, reminiscent of stories like ""Jacob Faithful"" by Captain Marryat, depicting the unique existence of those who call the waterways home."|"['1.

River-folk living in China have unique customs that set them apart from the land community. They have their own set of laws and rarely intermarry with those on land. Women often navigate boats, including the egg-boats, where these families lead peaceful lives, free from disputes. In contrast, American and Canadian river steamboats are known for their grandeur and uniqueness. These long, narrow paddle-boats feature luxurious saloons and sleeping quarters, with a focus on chivalrous treatment of unmarried female passengers. Cargo is piled amidships, while time-saving amenities like onboard barbers reflect Americans' efficiency. The flying-proa of the Pacific stands out for its speed and agility, with a triangular sail and bamboo construction. Fijian canoes, known for their twin-canoes with platforms and large sails, are propelled using sculling methods.|"['1.
