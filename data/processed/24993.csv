When Rollo, a seven-year-old boy, was sitting on the doorstep, he heard a noise in the street. A carryall approached with his family inside. Rollo's father and mother, along with his little brother Nathan, got out of the carriage. His father tied the horse to a post and joined them. Rollo had been thinking about the sun shining into the barn door as he sat with Jonas, his father's hired boy, husking corn. They planned to mark the sun's reflection each day with chalk. As Rollo pondered the sun's movement, interrupted by his family's arrival, he realized he couldn't discuss his thoughts at that moment. Later, Rollo shared his observations with his cousin Lucy, leading to a friendly dispute about the sun's position at different times of the day.|"['1.

Lucy and Rollo ventured into the garden to find the perfect spot to conduct an experiment. As they explored, Rollo's mother joined them, intrigued by their idea. She suggested a more precise method involving a pin and a card indoors to track the shadow's movement accurately. By placing the pin through the card on a window sill, they could mark the shadow's position daily. Rollo's mother advised them on the setup, emphasizing the importance of positioning the card north-south for accurate readings. She encouraged the children to complete the project themselves but offered guidance if needed. Excited by the plan, Lucy and Rollo set out to gather materials and implement their shadow-tracking experiment.|"[""1.

Rollo's father explained how a tree can cover a nail driven into it over time. Rollo was intrigued and decided to try it to never run out of money. With his father's guidance, he made a small cleft in the bark and inserted a cent. As they worked, Rollo asked questions, but his father was sometimes silent, lost in thought. They discussed the concept of satiety, where too much of a good thing can lead to exhaustion. Rollo's father cautioned against rushing through enjoyment, comparing it to viewing pictures in his library slowly to truly appreciate them. Rollo insisted he wouldn't tire of beautiful gardens quickly, prompting his father to ponder the value of savoring experiences at a measured pace.|"['1.

Rollo was heading home one morning after running an errand when he noticed a sizable wood pile near Farmer Cropwell's door. This sight brought back memories of a journey he took into the countryside with Jonas, who had shared stories with him and Lucy. On that trip, Jonas had shown Rollo the sweet sap of a maple tree. Intrigued, Rollo decided to check the woodpile's logs for sap. However, he soon realized that the logs were dry and not maple trees. Witnessing one of Farmer Cropwell's boys attempting to split a log using an axe, wedge, and beetle, Rollo observed how the log cracked open after the wedge was driven in. Despite the walnut being crushed during the process, the boy successfully split the log and then used a wooden wedge to widen the cleft further.|"[""**1.

Rollo examined the log carefully to understand why it crushed the walnut. He noticed that the log was not split entirely but had a crack that started from one end and almost reached the other. At one end, the log remained solid and whole. Rollo realized that the two halves were firmly held together at one end, making them spring back when separated. He saw splinters binding the sides tightly. The boy explained how a wedge works to split the log by spreading the wood apart. Rollo suggested widening the back of the wedge to open the wood further. They tested the theory by using a wooden wedge, but it failed. The boy demonstrated how a sharp iron wedge easily entered the crack to separate the log.|['1.

Boys often have a habit of calling out for people instead of looking for them quietly, which can disturb others. Rollo learned this when looking for Jonas. He realized that calling out might be faster, but it disturbs everyone. So, he quietly searched for Jonas and found him near the barn. Jonas then gave Rollo advice on making a wedge from hard wood instead of iron. Rollo tried to make the wedge but faced challenges due to the wood's hardness and short length. He went back to Jonas feeling frustrated. Rollo learned that it's important to plan and consider the best approach before starting a task.|"[""1.

Rollo was uncertain whether to be pleasant or not. Eventually, he chose to be good-natured. He realized that by sharpening his wedge uniformly, it would be more effective. He took the advice to heart and decided to make a perfect wedge. Even though he was eager to finish quickly, he understood the importance of taking his time to do it right. Rollo carefully smoothed the sides of the wedge with the hatchet and then sawed it off at the correct distance. After trimming the rough edges with his knife, he presented the well-made wedge to Jonas. Jonas advised Rollo not to rush and to complete his apparatus entirely before testing it. Rollo, understanding the value of patience and thoroughness, chose to make a new wedge first before moving on to other tasks.|"['1.

"Rollo carefully crafted a little mallet, which he named a ""little beetle,"" for splitting wood with wedges. He explained to Nathan how he would use the beetle and wedges to split kindling wood. Rollo selected a board and sawed it into short pieces, neatly piling them up. He then used a knife to create a small opening in one piece of wood and drove in a wooden wedge. Nathan watched with great attention as the wood began to split. Rollo then used a second wedge to further split the board, successfully splitting it in two. Nathan was delighted with the process and Rollo's craftsmanship."|"['1.

In the same way, Rollo divided a few more pieces from his board, and then Nathan asked if he could also try splitting one. Initially hesitant to let go of his beetle, Rollo decided to allow Nathan to give it a go, knowing it would make his brother happy. Rollo made a small split with his knife and inserted the wedge for Nathan to pound. Although Nathan couldn't hit as hard as Rollo, he managed to split the wood wider with each strike, much to his delight. Rollo was pleased to see Nathan enjoy using the beetle and wedges. After successfully splitting the piece, Nathan was thrilled with his accomplishment. However, a disagreement arose when Rollo wanted the wedges back, and Nathan held onto the beetle. Nathan, feeling guilty, reluctantly threw the beetle on the floor, displaying ill-natured behavior. It's essential for children to give up things they shouldn't have graciously. Nathan's actions showed he still had room to grow in being a good boy.|"['1.

Shortly after, Rollo's mother hurried downstairs to check on the commotion. Rollo was quick to explain how Nathan got hurt, but his mother gestured for silence. She assessed Nathan's injury and realized it wasn't severe, judging by his cries. Comforting Nathan, she gently advised him to stop crying. Nathan knew his mother expected him to control his emotions and obey her. After soothing him, she applied a small plaster to his forehead, then took him to bed. Rollo hesitated when asked if he should forgive Nathan or punish him for misbehaving. His mother explained the importance of calming Nathan down before understanding what happened. She emphasized the tendency for children to misrepresent events during heightened emotions and advised waiting until things settled before seeking the truth. Nathan, feeling better, joined them, and Rollo decided to make him his own beetle and wedge as a gesture of forgiveness.|"[""1.

Rollo found Nathan splitting a board the wrong way. Nathan was trying to drive a wedge into the side of the board instead of the end. Rollo corrected him, explaining the concept of grain and how wood splits along the grain. They made wedges and a beetle for Nathan to split the boards. The next day, they split the boards into kindling wood, impressing Dorothy. She promised to bake them apple turnovers using the kindling wood. Jonas later explained why wood splits along the grain and not across, due to the channels and fibers in the wood. After studying, Rollo played with Nathan in the autumn weather, pretending to be asleep and playfully growling at Nathan.|['1.

Rollo and Nathan were playing in the yard until Nathan accidentally hurt Rollo with his whip-handle. Instead of calmly addressing the situation, Rollo abruptly decided to stop playing and left. They then found themselves in a corner of the yard where they had once built a sand-garden. The neglected garden was covered in autumn leaves and dried plants. Rollo began to clear the leaves and started digging in the sand. Nathan, on the other side, was fascinated by a tin dipper with a small hole that allowed sand to flow smoothly. Rollo remembered an hour-glass he had seen and decided to make one using the dipper. However, the sand was dirty, so he sought Dorothy's advice on how to clean it using water.|"['1.

Rollo decided to make an hour-glass for which he needed sand. He filled a basin with sand and water, stirring it to separate the sand from sticks and leaves. Rollo was amazed at how the water separated the light and heavy particles. After cleaning the sand, he spread it out to dry. Jonas saw Rollo's project and shared his own time-keeping method using a noon mark on the barn floor. By marking the shadow of the door post at noon, Jonas could always tell the time. He explained that shadows point north at noon, making it a reliable way to mark time accurately. Rollo was fascinated and wanted to create a similar noon line at his house. Jonas suggested using a compass needle to draw a north and south line for accurate timekeeping.|"['1.

Jonas wanted to make a sundial to tell time accurately. However, his father explained the challenges of exactness. The clock isn't precise, and shadows vary with the sun's position. Even the post's upright position isn't exact. To make a reliable sundial, one must align it with the North Star. This ensures shadows fall consistently, marking time accurately. Although Jonas didn't fully grasp the concept, he was eager to try. His father encouraged him to experiment and learn more about astronomy to understand the intricacies of making a sundial. Jonas and Rollo set out to create a sundial using the North Star as a guide, excited to see how it would work.|"[""1.

A few days later, Jonas decided to conduct an experiment. He gathered two narrow boards from an old picket fence, ensuring one end of each board was sharp to be driven into the ground. Choosing a spot in the yard away from the usual path but still visible from the barn, Jonas planned to create a sundial using the North Star. Understanding that a single stake might not stay in position, he opted for two boards. By driving the second board perpendicularly from the first and nailing them together, he aimed to keep the setup stable. In the evening, the boys set out under the starry sky. Jonas taught Rollo about the Dipper and how stars appear to move in circles around the North Star. They began aligning the boards towards the North Star to create their sundial, a task they would continue the next evening.|['1.

The following day, Jonas trimmed the stakes to the junction. Rollo decided to track the shadow's movement hourly. He planned to use the stakes as a sundial. Jonas explained that the North Star remains fixed while other stars move. The bright sun cast clear shadows from the stakes. Rollo's father suggested using a board for accuracy. They placed the board between the stakes and marked the hour lines. The board's smooth surface made it easier to read the shadows. They secured the board to short stakes for stability. The boys painted the hour lines for a functional sundial. Meanwhile, they observed tall hollyhocks in full bloom. Rollo trapped a bee in a flower to hear its buzz, delighting in the garden's wonders.|"[""1.

Rollo and Henry were on a mission to capture bees for Rollo's new hive. They carefully lured the bees into a flower-pot, sealing them in with a stone. Despite their success in capturing seven bees, Rollo was worried about not finding a queen bee. The next morning, they checked on the hive and found everything in place. Rollo was hopeful about the experiment's success but still concerned about the missing queen bee. Just then, Jonas called out to Rollo, drawing their attention. They were contemplating using a bumblebee as a substitute when Jonas arrived. Together, they observed the flower-pot with anticipation, eager to see if their beekeeping venture would flourish.|"[""1.

Rollo, with a confident tone, explained his plan to use a flower-pot as a beehive. However, a mishap occurred when he slid the pot off its seat, unknowingly harming the bees inside. Despite their efforts to save the bees, only one managed to fly away. This incident made Rollo realize the consequences of his actions and decided never to attempt such a hive again. Later, after finishing his book, Rollo pondered his next activity and decided to check on Nathan in the kitchen.

Rollo and Nathan were excited about the plan. Rollo's father listed the items needed for a magnetism lecture: needles, thread, water, cork, sand-box, and paper. Rollo's mother helped gather the items. Nathan, eager for the lecture, tried to secure a good seat. Rollo kindly assisted him. Nathan spilled water in the struggle, and both boys were punished by facing the wall until the mess was cleaned. The boys learned not to touch things without permission.

Rollo's father conducted an experiment to demonstrate the magnetic properties of a bar magnet to Rollo and his family. He showed that the attractive power of the magnet is concentrated at its ends, known as poles. By using a needle suspended by a thread, he illustrated how the needle only moved when the magnet's end was brought close to it. The experiment continued as sand was used to show how the magnetic force accumulated at the ends of the magnet, forming a cluster of sand. Rollo's mother observed that there was a slight difference in the accumulation of sand at each end, indicating that the magnetism at the two poles was of opposite natures. This experiment highlighted the distribution of magnetic power in a magnet and the unique properties of its poles.|"[""1.

Rollo eagerly grabbed the bar and tried to brush the sand off the paper. Despite his efforts, most of the sand remained stuck. When he rubbed one side, it just moved to the other side, making it hard to clean. He then asked Jonas for the tongs by the fire. With the tongs, he tapped the magnet's end gently on them, letting it hang slightly over the edge. This action cleared all the sand, leaving the bar clean. Next, he cut a flat piece from a cork and made a groove to hold a needle. Placing the needle on the cork in a saucer of water, he explained that it's called a float, allowing the needle to move freely. Nathan found this experiment fascinating and watched the needle move about with keen interest. Rollo's father demonstrated how the needle reacted to the magnet's different ends, showing a distinct difference in their magnetic properties.|"['1.

Rollo's father explained that the needle floating on water was magnetic, having two poles, while the sand, nail, and other needle were not magnets. He demonstrated how the touched needle attracted sand at both ends. Placing an untouched needle on the float, he showed how both ends were attracted by the magnetic needle. Using a new saucer, he compared a magnetized needle with a regular one, showing their magnetic differences. By bringing the bar magnet close to the needles, he illustrated repulsion and attraction between like and unlike poles. Lastly, he magnetized two new needles and demonstrated repulsion between like poles and attraction between opposite poles. This experiment showcased how touching a steel piece with a magnet makes it magnetic, leading to repulsion or attraction based on the poles' alignment.|"[""1.

Rollo's father decided to teach him about magnetism. He used needles on floats in water to demonstrate the attraction and repulsion forces of magnets. Rollo was fascinated by the experiment. His father explained that magnets have poles with opposite powers that attract or repel each other. Later, Rollo tried to make a needle point north using a cork and water basin, but it kept pointing towards the garden gate. Mary noticed the water's unusual behavior around the basin's edges, causing bubbles and the needle to move strangely. After Mary adjusted the setup, the needle finally aligned itself with the north. This experiment helped Rollo understand how magnets align with the Earth's magnetic field.|"[""1.

Mary observed the needle's movement attentively as it swung back and forth slightly past the meridian before gradually decreasing its distance each time until coming to rest, not exactly aligned with the meridian. She discussed dreaming during sleep with Rollo, suggesting that despite dreaming for hours, one might actually be sound asleep without any dreams. Mary proposed conducting experiments to explore this concept. Rollo decided to test this idea and asked Mary to study while he prepared for the experiments. They found a suitable spot under a tree where Mary tied pebbles to strings, demonstrating how the earth's attraction causes objects to fall in a curved path due to the string's constraint. Mary's experiments illustrated how gravity influences the motion of objects, leading to a better understanding of the phenomenon.|"['1.

Mary explained the concept of a pendulum to Rollo by demonstrating an experiment. She held a pebble stone to stop it at the lowest point under the tree branch where a string was fastened. After releasing the pebble, it swung back and forth through an arc, propelled by the force it acquired. Mary noted the rapidity of the oscillations and proposed further experiments with different sized pebbles, strings, and arcs to observe the effects. She emphasized the importance of unbiased observation and conducting multiple experiments to understand the impact of different variables. Mary then set up two pebble stones, one large and one small, hanging from the tree branch to compare their oscillations. Rollo watched with interest as Mary carefully prepared the experiment.|"['1.

After a few swings, the big stone started to move faster than the small one. Mary noted that even though they tried to make the stones identical, there might be hidden differences. To test if the stone's size affected the swings, Rollo picked a stone as big as an orange and suspended it. Initially, the stones swung together, but soon the differences became clear. They concluded that size didn't affect the speed of swings. Mary then chose two pebbles of almost the same size, tied them to strings, with one twice as long. When released, the shorter string swung faster, confusing their counting. They tried different lengths, from very short to very long, observing the varying swing speeds.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Mary and Rollo initially try to make identical?\nA) The size of the stones\nB) The length of the strings\nC) The speed of the swings\nD) The weight of the stones\nE) The color of the stones', ""Question 2:\nWhat did Rollo do to test if the stone's size affected the swings?\nA) Suspended a stone as big as an orange\nB) Painted the stones different colors\nC) Tied the stones to longer strings\nD) Used different weights of stones\nE) Threw the stones in the air"", ""Question 3:\nWhat did Mary do after Rollo's test with the orange-sized stone?\nA) Chose two pebbles of almost the same size\nB) Used a stone as big as a watermelon\nC) Tried swinging the stones at different times of the day\nD) Decided to paint the stones different colors\nE) Gave up on the experiment"", ""Question 4:\nWhat did Mary observe when she released the pebbles with different string lengths?\nA) The longer string swung faster\nB) The shorter string swung faster\nC) The strings swung at the same speed\nD) The pebbles didn't move at all\nE) The pebbles collided mid-air"", 'Question 5:\nWhat did Mary and Rollo conclude about the effect of size on swing speed?\nA) Size greatly affected swing speed\nB) Size had no effect on swing speed\nC) Size made the swings unpredictable\nD) Size only affected the color of the stones\nE) Size made the swings go in different directions', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Mary and Rollo experiment with after observing the swing speeds of the pebbles?\nA) Different lengths of strings\nB) Different sizes of stones\nC) Different colors of stones\nD) Different locations for swinging the stones\nE) Different times of the year for the experiment']"|['A) The size of the stones', 'A) Suspended a stone as big as an orange', 'A) Chose two pebbles of almost the same size', 'B) The shorter string swung faster', 'B) Size had no effect on swing speed', 'A) Different lengths of strings']
