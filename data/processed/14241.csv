In the study of folk-tales, there are differing views on their origins. Some believe that tales originated in the places where they were found, attributing significance to the exact form and locality of birth. However, others, like myself, believe that tales likely originated elsewhere and were brought to different places. This perspective questions the anthropological value of tales with foreign origins and challenges rigid distinctions between tales from different regions. When it comes to how English folk-tales should be told, there are also varying opinions. I lean towards preserving the traditional storytelling styles, embracing dialects and archaic words that add charm and authenticity to the tales. By retaining these elements, we can capture the essence and richness of the folk-tale tradition.|"['1.

Once upon a time, in the County of Cumberland, there lived a nobleman with three sons. Two were clever and handsome, but the third, Jack, was a fool who spent his time with the sheep.

The famous tale of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, popularized by Browning, is well-known to many. Before Browning's version, the story was recounted in English in various books such as Verstegan's _Restitution of Decayed Intelligence_ and Howell's _Familiar Letters_. Browning is believed to have drawn inspiration from Wanley's _Wonders of the Little World_. The Grimms also included the legend in their collection, and in Germany, it inspired a poem by Julius Wolff and an opera by Victor Nessler. Mrs. Gutch explored a similar legend from Belfast in her study, suggesting a connection to the Pied Piper myth. Mr. Baring-Gould viewed the Pied Piper as a wind myth, while Mrs. Gutch speculated on a factual basis for the legend. The English adaptation of the tale, as presented by Elder, may have been influenced by Verstegan's work. The story's parallels in folklore, such as the magic piper theme, are evident in other English tales like Tom the Piper's son.|"[""1.

The tale of Cinderella, or in this case ""Rushen Coatie,"" is drawn from Miss Cox's collection of 345 versions of the story. Variants like ""Ashpitell,"" ""Rashin Coatie,"" and ""The Red Calf"" offer diverse Lowland Scots adaptations. Gaelic renditions such as ""The Sharp Grey Sheep"" and ""Fair, Brown, and Trembling"" showcase the tale's breadth. The parallels in each language group reveal distinct storytelling traditions.

"The origin of Cinderella as a Celtic tale is not definitively proven.

"The story of Catskin, a tale of a heroine who is transformed into a cat, has many parallels in folk-tales. The incident of Perseus and Andromeda is a common theme, as is the test of prowess through ""cheese squeezing,"" seen in stories like ""Jack the Giant Killer."" Catskin, or the Wandering Gentlewomen, is a story that exists in English through chap-book ballads and variants like Rashie Coat. The full Catskin formula includes elements like a death-bed promise, an unnatural father desiring to marry his daughter, helpful animals, magic dresses, and a lovesick prince. While the chap-book versions lack some of these motifs, they still contain archaic touches hinting at Catskin's transformation into an animal. The origins of the Catskin story are debated, with some scholars suggesting an English origin due to the prevalence of hero-tales with similar motifs. Others point to Italy, where a nearly perfect version of the formula exists. The relationship between Catskin and Cinderella is also discussed, with some proposing that Cinderella was derived from Catskin as a softened version."|"['1.
