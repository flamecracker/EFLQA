In India, a brewing uprising threatened the British rule. The discontent spread as messengers of the plotters fueled hatred and urged rebellion. The people believed the British were scheming against their religion. The seeds of revolt found fertile ground, growing rapidly. The plan was for a widespread revolt on May 31, 1857, but impatience led to early violence. The first major incident occurred in Meerut on May 10, where regiments clashed over starting a massacre. The Eleventh Native Infantry hesitated but eventually joined, sparking chaos. Amid the turmoil, the Emperor of Delhi was proclaimed the Great Mogul. Meanwhile, in the east, Dr. Hugh Marlowe, an American physician, lived with his daughter Mary and servant Mustad. Mary's love interest, Jack Everson, awaited her father's approval. As they conversed, Jack stepped forward to meet the doctor.|['1.

Jack Everson sat facing the broad Ganges River, with its low, green banks in the distance. As the sun dipped low, he spotted a group of horsemen on the opposite shore, causing him to stand and alert the others. The doctor and his daughter joined him, noticing the approaching party. These nomadic tribes were known as brigands and robbers, feared for their merciless ways, especially in times of revolt. As the horsemen neared the river, Jack prepared his rifle and took aim. With precision, he shot two of the horsemen, causing chaos among the group. The remaining horsemen quickly retreated, realizing the danger.

Jack hurriedly reloaded his weapon, worried that the group would escape before he could shoot again. Unfortunately, despite taking the shot, it was rushed and missed. The group quickly rode out of sight without concern for their companions. Jack, reflecting on the situation, felt three out of four shots were decent given the circumstances. They decided to leave the house, gather essentials, and find a safe place for the night. However, they were surprised to find their servant, Mustad, missing. They suspected he had been called away due to recent events. The group packed essentials, focusing on defense. Jack had his gun ready, and Dr. Marlowe ensured they had enough ammunition. They extinguished the lamps, left the door unlocked, and prepared to leave. As they were about to depart, a stranger approached, informing them about a mutiny in Meerut where native soldiers rebelled, killing many Europeans and heading to Delhi.|['1.

A group of families, including Dr. Marlowe and his wife, fled from Meerut to escape the turmoil of the insurrection. They found a boat, without sails, and decided to paddle up a navigable stream towards safety. Mr. Anderson, a long-time resident, suggested a route through less settled areas to avoid the chaos. As they prepared to embark, they met new acquaintances - Anderson, Turner, and Wharton - who shared their plight. Despite the looming danger, the group found solace in their newfound camaraderie. With a mix of hope and apprehension, they boarded the boat, aware of the peril that awaited them if discovered by hostile forces. Dr. Marlowe, armed with only a revolver, set off with his companions towards an uncertain but hopeful future.|['1.

In that moment of profound stillness following the young man's disappearance among the trees surrounding the lawn, the people on the boat felt a thrill of terror at the sound of oars from the river. The physician suggested moving to the shaded riverbank to avoid being detected. Using long poles, Wharton and Anderson skillfully guided the boat to the bank. As they worked, the others scanned the surroundings for signs of danger. Soon, they spotted a shadowy craft on the river, prompting fear among the group. The enemies seemed to be searching for them, causing heightened tension. Dr. Marlowe believed they needed to abandon the boat and seek refuge in the woods to evade their pursuers. However, they hesitated due to the absence of Jack Everson, who might get lost without the group's guidance. The looming threat kept everyone on edge as they weighed their options.|['1.

As Jack hurried towards the house, a sense of unease crept over him. Despite having been there recently, the sight of a light in the room and the partially open front door raised his suspicions. Determined to act, he cautiously entered the house, revolver in hand, ready for any threat. His goal was clear - to retrieve Miss Marlowe's revolver, not just for its scarcity but for the looming danger he sensed. Moving silently through the dark hall, he stumbled upon an object, shattering the silence.

The young man, Jack Everson, found himself in a tense situation. He suspected an intruder in the house after noticing the lamp had been relit mysteriously. With his sharp eyes, he saw the door to the rear of the house move slightly, revealing a pair of eyes in the darkness. Jack swiftly aimed his revolver at the lurking figure, ready to defend himself. The intruder, an East Indian named Mustad, stood before Jack, caught off guard and submissive. Mustad claimed loyalty to Jack's master and mistress and professed innocence, but his suspicious questions revealed his true intentions.

Jack Everson was certain of the man's betrayal. He knew about recent events in the cities mentioned and lost his usual cleverness when trying to deceive. As he spoke, he swiftly picked up a revolver, ensuring none of its chambers were fired. He put it in his coat pocket, holding his own gun. A misstep over a walking cane saved him from a deadly attack. Mustad's yataghan narrowly missed him, thanks to the stumble. Jack attempted to retaliate but Mustad vanished. Jack decided to retreat, not wanting to risk his life. He heard whispers and sensed movement in the house. Jack deduced the attackers were cowards. To mislead them, he changed direction towards the river, then abruptly veered towards the Ganges to throw them off.

Jack was on his way to the river bank after changing his course to mislead his enemies. As he searched for his boat, he heard a noise and realized he was being followed. Two natives were sneaking up on him, but he turned the tables by running towards a tree where they were hiding. Startled, the natives fled, and Jack fired at them. He recognized them as Mustad and his companion. Jack then heard sounds of paddles on the river, indicating that another group was out searching for them. Jack approached the boat where his friends were waiting, and they welcomed him aboard. He recounted his encounters, including with the treacherous Mustad.

Now that everyone was back together, they were eager to move. Wharton and Turner skillfully used poles to guide the craft down the Ganges, alert for enemies. The women were advised to stay in the cabin for safety. They needed to head north, away from the turmoil in Calcutta, Bombay, and the insurrection in the south. Their goal was to find a remote community where their medical knowledge would be valued. Despite their interest in toxicology, they were wary of their surroundings. As they approached a tributary, they heard paddles. Another boat appeared, slowly moving upstream. Tension rose as the boats drew closer. The occupants of the other boat stopped paddling and the figure at the prow stood motionless. The white people held their breath, fearing they had been discovered.

The event was a complete surprise for the people in the other boat. In times of chaos, brave individuals often become passive and accept defeat, but in this case, the Asians decided to fight back. The attackers were taken aback when they were fired upon before they could even shoot. The Caucasians continued to defend themselves, and the assailants were soon on the losing end. The attackers retreated downstream, firing shots blindly, while the defenders aimed accurately. Dr. Marlowe's quick actions and the strong resistance of the group caused the attackers to panic and retreat. The group managed to navigate the boat against the current and found a refuge in a tributary. The doctor considered abandoning the boat and trekking on foot, but the slow flow of the tributary allowed them to progress easily.

As the boat traveled up the narrow tributary, the passengers hoped they had evaded their enemies. The dense vegetation along the shores provided excellent cover. They navigated carefully, hiding beneath overhanging branches. Dr. Marlowe suspected the stream would soon become impassable. It was nighttime, and the women retired to the cramped cabin to rest. The men took turns poling the boat, conserving their energy. Jack Everson was awakened by his friend Wharton, who alerted him to their hidden position near the shore. Jack stayed vigilant, armed with a gun, as the others slept. He understood the danger they were in and chose to keep watch alone.|['1.

In the jungle, Jack Everson and his companion, Wharton, faced a sudden peril. Amidst the eerie cries of the night creatures, a royal Bengal tiger stealthily approached their boat. Jack, alert and armed with his rifle, spotted the glowing eyes of the beast in the darkness. Without hesitation, he aimed and fired, hitting the tiger with deadly precision. The impact of the bullet caused the tiger to leap further than intended, overshooting its mark and plunging into the stream. The massive creature met its end swiftly, disappearing into the water's flow. Jack's quick thinking and accurate shot saved them from a potentially fatal encounter with the formidable jungle predator.|"['1.

In the night, the sound of a rifle shot did not wake any of the women. Dr. Marlowe and Anderson were the only ones who sat up, concerned about the noise. The elder praised Jack for his watchfulness and then dozed off. Jack wanted to ask about a distant sound but found the doctor asleep. Jack stayed alert, wary of jungle visitors. As dawn broke, they were relieved the night had passed safely. With enough food from Meerut, they were prepared. Jack asked about the mysterious sounds, but opinions differed. Some wanted to stay on the boat for safety. Dr. Marlowe warned against it. They parted ways, knowing they might not meet again. Dr. Marlowe led the group through the jungle towards Nepaul.|"['1.

No; for two or three days while traveling over it we shall be in constant danger; our task will be to make our way over it without attracting the notice of any of our enemies who are scouring the country for us. That is what I mean to do after reaching the more plainly marked path, which connects with the highway. I see no risk in pushing through the jungle by day, since the only foes we are likely to encounter are four-footed ones. If we meet any such we must refrain from firing, since the reports of our guns will be sure to draw attention to us. I mean, of course, explained the doctor, that our weapons are not to be appealed to unless there is no escape otherwise, as was the case with the tiger. While he was speaking, Mary gave a faint gasp and caught his arm. She and Jack were facing the point toward which his back was turned. Seeing that it was something behind him that had startled both, the doctor turned his head. As if to emphasize the words just spoken, he saw an immense spotted leopard, motionless in the trail not more than fifty feet away. Evidently he was trotting to the stream, when he caught sight of the three persons, stopped short, raised his head and stared wonderingly at them. The leopard shares the reputation of the tiger for deadly ferocity and daring. When more than 20,000 persons are killed in India every year by wild animals and serpents,|"['1.

Mary Marlowe, a dutiful daughter, obeyed her father's command not to help those in danger on a boat. While waiting, she noticed five menacing men, Ghoojurs, armed with guns and yataghans. The leader spoke in Hindustani, signaling danger. Mustad, one of the Ghoojurs, had conflicting feelings due to Mary's kindness. The men expressed hatred towards the English and their intention to eliminate them all. Mary cleverly decided to stall the Ghoojurs until her father and Jack returned. Mustad led the group, with Mary following, through a dense jungle path. Mary, relying on her absent friends, anticipated a clash between them and the Ghoojurs. The Ghoojurs seemed solely focused on her, unaware of the impending danger from the rear. Mary was trapped, hoping for her friends' swift return to confront the Ghoojurs.|['1.

She had no doubt that her house and belongings were destroyed by the attackers, but she was not overly worried about it. She believed they were taking her to the nearby town of Akwar, where she hoped to find friends who would protect her from the anti-Christian sentiment. Her captors suddenly stopped when a pistol shot was fired from behind them. Everyone turned to look, including the young woman, thinking it might be her father or Jack. As they looked back, Dr. Marlowe appeared, flushed and excited, signaling the Ghoojurs to wait. Almos, the leader of the Ghoojurs, suddenly yelled and leaped in the air, having been bitten by a cobra. One of the men killed the snake, saving Almos from its venom. The group was shocked, and Almos calmly accepted his fate, knowing he was doomed. Dr. Marlowe, now in his professional role, prepared to treat Almos' snakebite but demanded payment before administering the antidote.

Almos, the Ghoojur chieftain, demanded that Dr. Marlowe and his daughter be left unharmed. Almos agreed to guide them to safety through the jungle. Dr. Marlowe, suspecting Almos would break his promise, prepared to defend his daughter. Suddenly, a shot rang out, and Almos fell to the ground, dead. Jack Everson, hidden on a rock, had taken the shot to protect them. The Ghoojurs, unaware of the sniper, attributed Almos's death to the cobra bite.

Once again, a faint sound echoed through the jungle, marking the accuracy of the young American's shot. Mustad fell to the ground, motionless, as the doctor's wrathful actions caused panic among the Ghoojurs. They fled in fear, disappearing from sight. Meanwhile, Jack Everson hurried to his friends, relieved to find them safe. As they journeyed towards Nepaul, danger lurked, but luck was on their side. Eventually, they reached a region where peril was no more. Dr. Marlowe, the elderly physician, joined them on their trip back to the United States.

During a period of slow business, Superintendent Bradley reduced everyone's wages, including his own, promising to restore them once business improved. This prevented a strike. After a month, wages were restored, but employees had to work an extra half hour without pay. While a strike was avoided temporarily, the relationship between employer and employees suffered. Discontent grew until Chief Foreman Hugh O'Hara and worker Thomas Hansell met with Mr. Bradley to request fair compensation for the extra work. Despite their willingness to compromise, Bradley refused. This led to 200 employees leaving the Rollo Mills in protest. Bradley remained firm, leading to a standoff. O'Hara and Hansell warned of potential violence, but Bradley dismissed their concerns. The repairs were completed, but only O'Hara and Hansell returned to work, requesting a slight pay increase for overtime. Bradley refused, leading to further tension and no employees returning to work.|"[""1.

Harvey, on a quest for shelter, followed a trail that led him to Hugh O'Hara and Thomas Hansell, two men he did not wish to encounter. Hugh, of Scotch descent, was well-educated and influential but had a sorrowful past that left him reserved and shaggy in appearance. Tom, less educated, followed Hugh's lead. Despite Hugh's tragic losses, they were plotting mischief in a cabin on a blustery night with only their hound, Nero. Harvey, displeased with the situation, found himself in a trap.

The cabin door swung open, revealing a man's silhouette against the fiery backdrop of the flames. His shadow stretched towards Harvey, who worried about being followed through the unfamiliar woods. Harvey, vigilant, checked behind him often as he navigated the dim forest. He approached a wide creek with a precarious tree trunk bridge. Another man, Jack Hansell, recognized Harvey from the opposite bank. Jack hurried away without a word. Harvey cautiously crossed the unstable trunk, nearly losing his balance. On the other side, he spotted the village lights, hastening towards home. However, upon arrival, he found his niece, Dollie, missing, causing distress to Aunt Maria.

It was only after a stern conversation that the frantic woman managed to reveal that the child had been missing for hours with no one aware of her whereabouts. Dollie had sulked when she discovered her older brother wouldn't return until night without informing her. She reluctantly ate dinner and then went out to play. Hours later, her aunt called for her, but Dollie was nowhere to be found. Search efforts proved futile, as Dollie had been spotted heading into the mountains, seemingly fleeing from someone. Harvey, her brother, realized she was lost and in danger. Determined to find her, he set out alone, believing the villagers wouldn't help. Fearing the worst, he vowed to confront those responsible if any harm came to Dollie. Harvey resolved to bring her back and seek justice for her disappearance.|"['1.

The sky had cleared further since he descended the mountain, allowing him to see clearly and spot objects in the distance. With most leaves gone due to the late season, he stayed on course easily. Pushing through the undergrowth along the bank, he reached the rocks where the waters cascaded down. Stepping just a few feet from the creek, he found a child's hood, recognizing it as Dollie's. Harvey regained his composure and pondered two theories: Dollie got lost searching for him or was abducted by his enemies. He suspected Hugh and Tom's involvement. He considered gathering help from the village to search for her. Upon entering the cabin, he found only Jack, Tom's lookalike.

Science has not yet understood the laws governing cyclones. These intense storms are thought to result from highly charged electric conditions in the atmosphere. Cyclones, previously seen mainly in the Pacific and Indian oceans, are the most destructive storms, surpassing monsoons and tornadoes. Navigators caught in a cyclone can escape by sailing perpendicular to the wind, moving beyond the storm's outer edge or reaching its calm center. Ocean cyclones range from fifty to a thousand miles in diameter. Professor Douglas from Ann Arbor University creates miniature cyclones using a copper plate charged with electricity and arsenious acid gas. Cyclones, also known as hurricanes, typhoons, or tornadoes, are caused by conflicting wind currents. They carry winds up to 140 miles per hour and can cause immense destruction. Cyclones never touch the equator and are marked by their terrifying force and concentrated power within a small area.|"[""1.

The local tornado, like a cyclone, is a revolving force with unique phenomena. Each tornado behaves differently, sometimes causing terrible disasters and other times just heavy thunder showers. Tornadoes can be unpredictable, leaving destruction in one area but sparing others. They can level forests in straight lines or create pockets of damage off track. Tornadoes can act like enormous scoops, carrying objects for miles or dumping them abruptly. Settlers in tornado-prone areas build deep cellars for refuge. However, tornadoes can still be deadly, lifting roofs and causing tragic accidents. Some tornadoes show strong electrical activity, magnetizing metal objects and even stopping clocks. The force of tornadoes can be seen in the speed at which objects are thrown, piercing trees like spears.|['1.

Tornadoes can cause significant changes in the landscape by scooping up water or objects and depositing them elsewhere. In one instance, a large pond's water was lifted and dropped on a hill, creating gullies. In another, a tornado diverted a river's course towards a lake. Stories abound of objects being carried away and left in unexpected places, like the accordion found entangled in a tree. Despite their power, tornadoes offer a chance of escape and are short-lived. In contrast, blizzards can be relentless and isolating, as experienced by a man caught in a snowstorm in Kansas. Loneliness and uncertainty loom large in the face of nature's fury, highlighting the need for preparation and companionship in challenging times.|"['1.

"""The key to success in lassoing,"" explained Mr. Ohnimus, ""is having a top-notch riata. A riata must be perfectly stretched, oiled, and in excellent condition for accurate work. Here's how a good riata is crafted: rawhide is cut into thin strips, half tanned with the hair on, soaked, and braided tightly. The finished riata is buried in sand for a week or more to retain moisture. Burying the riata is crucial; soaking in water won't do. Vaqueros bury and stretch their riata every six to eight months. The riata is never tied to the saddle but hangs ready for use. A vaquero must be able to release the rope instantly in case of danger, like a bull pulling with force. When a vaquero spots his target, he grabs the riata, usually with his left hand, to prepare for a throw. Being ambidextrous is an advantage in this trade, allowing for quick throws from any position. The noose is kept small to prevent tangling with the horse's legs, and the riata is held with precision for a successful lasso throw."""|"['**Question 1:** What is the main focus of the text passage?\n- A) The importance of having a good horse\n- B) The process of crafting a riata\n- C) The history of lassoing\n- D) The dangers of being a vaquero\n- E) The benefits of being ambidextrous', '**Question 2:** Why is burying the riata in sand important according to the passage?\n- A) To make the riata look shiny\n- B) To keep the riata cool\n- C) To retain moisture\n- D) To make the riata smell good\n- E) To make the riata stronger', '**Question 3:** How often do vaqueros bury and stretch their riata?\n- A) Every day\n- B) Every month\n- C) Every two months\n- D) Every six to eight months\n- E) Every year', '**Question 4:** Why is being ambidextrous an advantage for a vaquero?\n- A) To show off their skills\n- B) To impress others\n- C) To prevent accidents\n- D) To allow for quick throws from any position\n- E) To make the job easier', ""**Question 5:** What is the purpose of keeping the noose small according to the passage?\n- A) To make the riata look neat\n- B) To prevent tangling with the horse's legs\n- C) To make the riata lighter\n- D) To make the riata easier to handle\n- E) To make the riata more visible"", ""**Question 6:** Why is it mentioned that the riata is never tied to the saddle in the passage?\n- A) To emphasize the importance of the riata\n- B) To show the vaquero's skill\n- C) To highlight the dangers of lassoing\n- D) To explain how the riata is stored\n- E) To demonstrate the riata's strength""]"|"['** B) The process of crafting a riata', '** C) To retain moisture', '** D) Every six to eight months', '** D) To allow for quick throws from any position', ""** B) To prevent tangling with the horse's legs"", '** D) To explain how the riata is stored']"
Representing the cowboy, I hold the remaining coils in my hand, adjusting my forefinger for better control. The next step is enlarging the noose, crucial for roping a steer from a distance. By swinging the noose until it reaches the desired size through centrifugal force, the lasso hand must maintain a loose grip. Then, keeping the noose open without entangling it requires skill. A precise twist of the wrist and judgment to avoid obstacles are vital. Successfully circling the noose overhead, the key is to release it at the right moment. Throwing the riata accurately demands practice. Timing the cast and aiming at a specific point are essential. Gauging distances and releasing the correct number of coils are critical. After roping the steer, securing the rope around the saddle horn swiftly is crucial to prevent being pulled off the horse. Using a secure hitch method ensures safety.|['1.

The journalist positioned himself twenty feet behind Mr. Ohnimus, completely hidden from view. Ohnimus skillfully swung the loop over his head and without looking back, flung it behind him. The loop encircled the newspaper man perfectly, and with a swift pull, Ohnimus had his arms tightly bound to his sides. This technique, known as a backthrow, has been favored by Mexican bandits for its surprise factor. The lasso can swiftly immobilize a target from behind, as demonstrated by Ohnimus. The reporter, now captured by the rope, learned firsthand about the defensive capabilities of the lasso. Ohnimus shared his experiences using the lasso to catch sea lions and hogs, highlighting its effectiveness as a tool for control and defense.
