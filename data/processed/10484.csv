Ancient governments and laws varied in their approach to justice and welfare for all classes. Oriental laws and priestly jurisprudence often favored the ruling elite rather than the people. In contrast, Greek and Roman laws, developed through centuries of experience, aimed to benefit all citizens. The laws in free Greek city-states and among the Romans were more enlightened, balancing societal relations with reason and justice. Unlike the absolute monarchies of the East, where kings' edicts ruled, Greece and Rome had laws shaped by the needs of the people. These ancient laws, especially those of Rome, influenced modern legislation, emphasizing equal rights and social regulations. The legislation in Greece and Rome, born from the struggle for justice and rights, laid the foundation for the civilized legal systems we have today.|"[""1.

Solon, an influential Athenian lawmaker, had a significant impact on shaping the laws that governed individuals in ancient Greece. Before Solon, Draco, another Athenian, had established harsh laws in 624 B.C., including severe punishments like death for minor offenses. Solon, born around 638 B.C., came from a noble family and rose to power during a time of turmoil in Athens. He abolished Draconian laws, introduced reforms like debt relief, and empowered the people by allowing them to bring legal actions. Solon's reforms aimed to balance power between the rich and the people, laying the foundation for Athenian democracy. He also made advancements in inheritance laws, industry regulations, and social practices. Despite some controversial laws, Solon's legacy as a founding father of constitutional government and advocate for social justice endures in ancient Athenian history.|"[""1.

The laws of Athens saw significant changes after the democratic party, led by Cleisthenes, gained power. The political rights were extended to all free native Athenians. The military command was now in the hands of ten generals, one from each tribe, instead of one archon. The Ecclesia, a formal gathering of citizens, met more often. Citizens served as jurors, and all were eligible for magistracy. Ostracism, a form of exile without disgrace, was used to prevent the rise of demagogues. In Rome, constitutional liberty began with the struggle between patricians and plebeians. Initially, Rome was ruled by kings or aristocrats. The patricians were from original Latin, Sabine, and Etruscan families, while the plebeians were common folk. The senate, controlled by wealthy patrician families, held power after kings were expelled. Consuls, the highest magistrates, were annually elected by the people but mostly belonged to great families. Rome's early constitution was aristocratic, based on wealth, with power held by nobles.|"['1. What significant changes were made to the laws of Athens after the democratic party gained power?\nA.

"The Roman Senate was a powerful and esteemed body, composed of aristocrats who held both judicial and legislative authority. Senators were required to be wealthy and wore a purple stripe as a badge of distinction. They oversaw religious matters, foreign relations, troop levies, tax regulations, and the appointment of governors. The Senate also had the power to declare war, appoint dictators, and grant triumphs to victorious generals. The balance of power between the aristocratic Senate and the plebeians gradually shifted with the institution of tribunes, leading to a mixed constitution. The Roman constitution, evolving over centuries, was a remarkable example of human wisdom, with checks and balances preventing absolute power. The people were able to secure and retain rights, gradually gaining more privileges until they became a significant political force. Despite challenges from demagogues like Catiline and Caesar, the Roman Republic stood strong for centuries, symbolized by the proud ""SPQR"" on their standards."|"['1.

During the Roman Empire, the constitution was undermined, leading to a consolidated despotism. The emperors held all major offices and controlled the senate, army, law courts, provinces, and taxation. Despite this, the emperors maintained some legal structures and improved jurisprudence. Roman legal science aimed at justice and fairness, and the laws created by the Republic and Empire greatly influenced civilization. The Twelve Tables formed the basis of Roman law, later expanded by the praetors, consuls, tribunes, and senate decrees. The legal system became complex, with lawyers using subtleties and fictions in court. Notable jurists like Gaius and Ulpian laid the groundwork for Roman jurisprudence, which was further developed under imperial rule. Julius Caesar and Augustus introduced just laws, with Augustus focusing on slave manumission and marriage regulations. Ultimately, the emperors replaced the senate as the primary source of legislation.|"[""1.

"During a prosperous era of Roman law, many writings were crafted on legal matters, but most have been lost over time. Among the surviving works, the Institutes of Gaius stand out as highly valuable, shedding light on previously obscure legal aspects. Notable jurists like Gaius, Ulpian, Paulus, and others from Trajan to Alexander Severus left enduring contributions that became legal cornerstones. Following a period of stagnation, Theodosius II compiled constitutions from Constantine to his time, known as the Theodosian Code, influencing early Germanic laws. However, it was Justinian who revolutionized Roman jurisprudence. He consolidated diverse laws into the Code, then tasked Tribonian to compile the Digest, a collection of legal extracts. The Institutes served as an introduction to these works, while Justinian's Novels introduced new legal ordinances, collectively forming the ""Corpus Juris Civilis."""|"['1.

During the Middle Ages, Roman law influenced European legal systems. The _Corpus Juris_ of the Bologna school became widely accepted, shaping legal practice. After Justinian, only the Code, Pandects, and Institutes were recognized. While opinions on Justinian's collection varied, it impacted moral and political thought. The rediscovery of Roman law in Italy during the Middle Ages led to its revival. The study of Roman law spread from Italy to France and other European countries, with notable figures like Cujas and Grotius contributing to its study. Pothier systematized Roman law in the 18th century, and Savigny further advanced its study in Germany. Roman law influenced principles like citizenship, rights, and slavery, emphasizing equality under the law.

The Roman legal system had specific rules regarding the transfer of property. For property to change ownership, the owner needed to consent to the transfer for a valid reason and physically deliver the item to the new owner. Possession of movable items was considered proof of ownership unless proven otherwise. Ownership of movable items could be acquired through possession for one year and immovable items for two years. Inheritance laws dictated that when a Roman citizen passed away, their property was inherited by their heirs according to a legal order if no will was left behind. The testator, the person making the will, had to be of a certain age and mental capacity, and the will had to be witnessed by Roman citizens. Over time, laws were introduced to limit extreme bequests in wills. The Roman legal system also covered contracts comprehensively, influencing modern legal systems like those of France and Scotland.|"['1.

In ancient times, contracts were perfected by spoken words or writings. Verbal agreements were binding when certain formal words were spoken by one party and answered by the other. In England, all guarantees had to be in writing. Written acknowledgments of debt were used, especially for borrowing money. However, a creditor couldn't sue on a note within two years without proving the money was actually paid. Acts causing harm obligated the wrongdoer to make amends, even for damages due to negligence. In cases of libel or slander, truth could be used in defense. If damage occurred maliciously, the responsible party had to provide compensation. Professionals working beyond their expertise were liable for any resulting harm. Owners were responsible for damages caused by their slaves or animals. Legal claims could be transferred, but the assignee couldn't demand more than they paid for the debt. The king initially decided civil cases, later delegated to consuls and praetors. The praetor, assisted by a council, presided over civil courts. Judges were appointed to determine facts and give judgments based on the law. The centumvirs, a tribunal elected annually, decided property disputes. The Romans lacked modern judges, with magistrates serving judicial duties. Legal assessors were introduced to assist in legal matters. Under the empire, the Emperor became the supreme judge, assisted by various magistrates and senators.|['1.

In ancient Rome, the burden of proof lay on the party making a claim, requiring evidence like written documents or witness testimony. Certain individuals like pupils, lunatics, and slaves were not allowed to testify due to biases. Witnesses had to swear an oath before giving their testimony, with two witnesses usually enough to prove a fact. Conflicting testimonies were resolved by considering the credibility of the witnesses rather than their number. In criminal cases, the _comitia centuriata_ had the power of life and death during the republic. The senate lacked jurisdiction over Roman citizens in criminal matters. Over time, courts like the _quaestores perpetui_ were established to handle criminal cases with judges and juries. Treason was considered a severe crime, punishable by death and confiscation of property. Under the empire, disrespect towards the Emperor was also considered treason.|['1.

In ancient Rome, crimes against individuals led to severe punishments. Acts like wilful murder, poisoning, and parricide were punishable by death. Adultery resulted in banishment and loss of property, with Constantine even making it a capital offense. Rape was met with death and property confiscation. Forgery, coining base money, and perjury carried arbitrary punishments. Robbery, theft, and damage to property were private matters not penalized by the State. The Romans believed crimes were extinguished after twenty years without accusation. The Roman laws evolved over time, with emperors increasing punishment severity. Fines were common, and imprisonment was rare. Banishment was a frequent penalty, and death penalties included hanging, scourging, and beheading. Slaves were crucified, and under the emperors, execution methods included burning alive and exposure to wild beasts. The criminal justice system became more just and enlightened with time, with the principles of equity gaining importance.|['1.

Delays and formalities in administering justice were balanced by the intricate legal system that prevented rash decisions. The Romans were ahead of their time in legal precision, especially in property matters. Their laws on property, contracts, and wills were remarkably clear and fair. They ensured equal rights and protection, unlike some outdated practices. The Romans valued natural justice, punishing false witnesses and corrupt judges. Personal freedoms were respected, with strict punishments for libel and injustice. Despite flaws like paternal power abuse and slavery, Roman laws were a model for modern codes.

In ancient times, the Romans had strict laws to punish those who were careless or ignorant with property. Similarly, in England, severe penalties existed for hunting on private lands. While harsh punishments might deter crime, they can also hinder general prosperity. In England and France, where laws were enforced, citizens felt secure. The Roman legal system, although complex and costly, provided protection and safety. Despite restrictions on political rights, people enjoyed civil liberties. However, the legal system was often uncertain and expensive, favoring the wealthy. Material wealth sometimes overshadowed justice and morality, leading to societal decline. Scholars like Lord Mackenzie and George Long have extensively studied Roman law, shedding light on its complexities. Studying ancient law can provide insights into modern legal systems and societal structures. Architecture was the earliest form of art, focusing on practicality before aesthetics.

The earliest impressive structures were the temples of priests and the palaces of kings, seen first in Egypt and Assyria. The Tower of Babel, possibly built of brick, was a significant post-Noah flood monument, though we know little about its actual height or design. Ancient Egyptian architecture, noted for its grandeur and massiveness, focused on constructing massive stone palaces and temples. The ruins, like those at Karnak, showcase the architectural advancements during the reign of Sesostris and Rameses the Great. Egyptian temples featured colossal structures, like the Karnak temple with its towering stone blocks and pillars. The architecture aimed to inspire awe and wonder, evident in the enduring Pyramids and the majestic ruins of Thebes. The Egyptian temples were marked by grand entrances, colonnades, and chambers, with intricate columns, ornate capitals, and sculpted decorations. The Pyramids, particularly the Pyramid of Cheops, remain a marvel due to their immense size and ancient origins, possibly serving as royal tombs.|['1.

While details of Babylonian architecture are limited, historical texts suggest grandeur in a city with massive walls, gates of brass, and structures like the tower of Belus and the Palace of Nebuchadnezzar. The Tyrians excelled in architecture, as seen in the Temple of Solomon, known for its splendor and decoration. In India, architectural art focused on temples, with Buddhist temples carved from rock and adorned facades. Indian stupas, resembling domes or pyramids, were ornate structures with excessive decoration. Over time, Indian temples grew in magnificence, with some reaching impressive heights and adorned with precious substances.

In ancient India, architectural wonders like the _chaityas_ and _viharas_ were carved into rock, showcasing intricate details that have stood the test of time. These temple-caves boasted facades in the form of arches, adorned with sculptures that adorned both the interiors and exteriors. The _viharas_ were monasteries with central halls surrounded by monk cells, each with an image of Buddha. These edifices, some housing thousands of priests, were adorned with elaborate pillars and sculptures. The Nalanda monastery, for instance, accommodated ten thousand priests and was a hub of learning and art. Later, during the Mohammedan conquest, India saw the rise of mosques, minarets, and palaces that reflected a blend of Greek and Indian influences, showcasing a unique splendor. However, it was the ancient Greeks, particularly the Dorians, who perfected architectural art with their Doric temples, characterized by grandeur, simplicity, and harmony.|['1.

The Doric order of architecture was favored in European Greece and its colonies for a millennium. It was primarily used in temple construction, with examples like the grand structures in Paestum, Sicily, and Athens showcasing its magnificence. Each Doric temple, while following a general style, was unique in its own right. The earlier Doric style was more massive, while later versions became more elegant and adorned with sculptured decorations. The Parthenon, a prime example of Doric architecture, still stands as a testament to its beauty and grandeur. The Ionic order, more graceful and intricate, was invented by the Asiatic Greeks and is exemplified in the Acropolis. The Corinthian order, introduced later, surpassed both Doric and Ionic in refinement and elegance, featuring columns with foliated capitals inspired by acanthus leaves.|['1.

Greek architecture is known for its elegance and beauty, particularly in the design of mouldings with graceful curves. The temples, a significant application of Greek architecture, were grand structures adorned with columns and sculptures. They were often rectangular or circular in shape, with entrances from the west or east. The cella, where the deity's statue was kept, was the central part of the temple. The exterior of Greek temples was likely ornamented with colors and decorations, although the specifics are now unknown. Despite not being as large as some other ancient structures, like Roman amphitheatres, Greek temples are revered for their proportions, symmetry, and enduring beauty. The Parthenon, in particular, stands out as a model of architectural perfection that continues to influence modern buildings.|"['1.

During the flourishing era of Greek architecture from Pericles to Alexander, lasting 113 years, the art evolved through various conquests. The Macedonian conquest brought more grandeur and less simplicity. Subsequently, the Roman conquest hastened a decline in taste, mixing different architectural orders. The Romans, influenced by the Greeks, adopted the Corinthian style, adding more ornamentation. They combined Etruscan arches with Greek columns to create a new architectural style. The Romans, enamored with novelty, lost the simplicity of the Doric style. They altered the Doric columns, used bases, and changed the capitals. Roman temples often had porticos on one front only, projecting three columns. They favored circular temples like the Pantheon with unique internal columns. Roman architecture was criticized for excessive ornamentation and a focus on interior decoration over exterior. Despite these criticisms, Roman architecture showcased grandeur and magnificence through massive structures with columns and arches.|['1.

The Romans did not invent new architectural principles, except for the arch, which was known but not used by the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Greeks. The Romans, being practical and needing to save material, used the arch to build structures efficiently. It is considered one of the greatest architectural inventions, allowing them to construct various buildings economically. Its first known application was in the Cloaca Maxima and may have been of Etrurian origin. The arch enabled the Romans to build vast structures like bridges, aqueducts, and temples with simple materials. The arch's versatility extended to domes, cupolas, and various parts of buildings, making it an essential element in Gothic cathedrals. The Romans' knowledge of the arch led to the construction of a greater variety of structures compared to the Greeks and Egyptians. Their architectural achievements, rooted in the arch, reached a level of perfection rarely matched in later times.|"['1.

Ancient sculpture, particularly that of the Greeks, stands out for its genius and skill. While the Greeks perfected sculpture, its origins date back to the earliest civilizations, with references found in the Old Testament. Assyria and Egypt boast relics showcasing the early cultivation of this art form. The Egyptians, in particular, made significant strides in sculpting statues, with colossal figures like the Sphinx and the statues of Memnon at Thebes displaying grandeur. However, Egyptian sculptures lacked emotional depth and intellectual force, characterized by calm and impassive expressions. It wasn't until the Greeks took up sculpture that a remarkable excellence in grace and expression emerged. Greek artists, with a keen eye for beauty, meticulously studied nature to create idealized forms. The Greeks revered beauty, and their sculptures reflected this adoration, embodying grace and perfection.

During the Persian wars, Greek art flourished, especially in Athens under the rule of Pericles. Phidias, a renowned sculptor, created masterpieces like the statue of the goddess Minerva, adorned in gold and ivory. His colossal bronze statue of Athene Promachos and the seated Zeus in Olympia were also awe-inspiring. Phidias excelled in ideal beauty and grandeur, setting a standard for ancient art. Another famous sculptor, Praxiteles, focused on grace and sensuality. His undraped statue of Venus in Cnidus attracted visitors from all over Greece. Praxiteles' works, like his statues of Dionysus and Eros, emphasized physical beauty and emotion. While Phidias aimed for sublime grandeur, Praxiteles captured the softer, more graceful aspects of the human form, leaving a lasting legacy in the art world.|"[""1.

The Romans did not invent sculpture but adopted it from the Greeks. During Hadrian's era, they created many stunning statues, with busts of emperors and monuments adorning Rome. Although Roman sculptures lacked the grace of the Greeks, they were well-crafted. Greek art peaked under Lysippus, with no room for improvement. However, Roman art declined morally over time, leading to crude works during the reign of emperors. The Arch of Constantine's reliefs pale compared to Marcus Aurelius's column. The decline of art is evident in ancient bath ruins, showcasing a shift from idealism to base appeals. Modern sculptures often imitate ancient works, showing the enduring influence of Greek artistry.

Polygnotus, a renowned painter from Thasos, was a contemporary of Phidias, known for his exceptional talent and generosity. He painted on panels that were later embedded into the walls of public buildings in Athens and the grand temple of Delphi. His works adorned the Propylaea, overseen by Phidias, displaying statuesque painting with ideal expressions, precise drawings, and rich colors. Polygnotus used a limited color palette, focusing on facial and figure expressions, drapery grace, and character depiction in repose, often inspired by Homer and the Epic cycle. His paintings were mainly mythological, created with an epic spirit and religious fervor. Polygnotus worked with wax and watercolors, and his technique of encaustic painting was highly durable and revered. The ancient artists used various materials like wood, clay, and plaster for their artwork, with fresco being a popular method for wall paintings. The painting process involved meticulous preparation of the walls and layers of plaster to ensure durability and vibrancy of colors. The artistry of Polygnotus and other Greek masters in both painting and sculpture was greatly admired in ancient times for their exceptional skill and creativity.|"[""1.

Dionysius and Mikon were famous painters who lived during the same time as Polygnotus. Dionysius was known for his portraits, which lacked idealism but excelled in expression and elegant drawing. Mikon, on the other hand, was skilled in painting horses and was the first to use light Attic ochre and black made from burnt vine-twigs as colors. Apollodorus of Athens, a painter around 408 B.C., added dramatic effect to Polygnotus' style while maintaining his influence. Apollodorus aimed to create realistic depictions, focusing on proper gradation of light and shade. He also introduced chiaro-oscuro and the concept of _tone_ in painting. Zeuxis, a pupil of Apollodorus, excelled in giving ideal form to rich effects, especially in his female figures. He was known for his attention to detail and the illusion of the senses in his paintings. His works were perfect in their execution, emphasizing accuracy and sensuous beauty.|['1.

During the peak of ancient Greek art, renowned painters like Parrhasius and Zeuxis from Ephesus and Athens, respectively, created masterpieces that influenced generations. Parrhasius excelled in drawing accuracy and expression, setting the standard for proportion and detail. He even outshone Zeuxis by painting a curtain so realistic it fooled his rival. Other notable artists like Timanthes and Eupompus were known for their inventive styles and advice emphasizing nature as the ultimate model. Apelles, a pupil of Pamphilus and Melanthius, reached the pinnacle of painting with his rich colors and sensuous charm, particularly evident in his masterpiece, the Venus Anadyomene. However, after Apelles, the decline of Greek painting began due to political turmoil and the migration of artists seeking patronage elsewhere.|"['1.

Ancient Rome had an abundance of remarkable paintings, yet they did not contribute to the advancement of the art. Sir Joshua Reynolds believed that Greek art had already reached its pinnacle in painting and statuary. Despite this, the Romans greatly valued the works of Greek artists, similar to how the English appreciate the paintings of old masters from Italy and Flanders. The Romans did not innovate in art but provided significant support, leading to a flourishing art scene during the time of the emperors. The Greeks focused on historical and mythological themes, portraying gods, heroes, and emotional human figures to achieve ideal beauty. In contrast, the Romans favored portrait, decorative, and scene painting, which drew criticism from some scholars. Mosaic work eventually replaced painting in Rome, showcasing intricate designs and colors.

Astronomy, the study of celestial bodies, has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The Chaldeans and Egyptians, among others, were early astronomers who observed and recorded the movements of the stars and planets. The Chaldean shepherds, under the clear skies of Chaldaea, tracked eclipses and established cycles that laid the foundation for astronomy. The Egyptians, through their observations, determined the length of the year and studied the courses of planets. While the Chinese and Hindus also made significant contributions to early astronomy, it was the Greeks who elevated it to a true science. They learned from the Babylonians and Egyptians but surpassed them in developing astronomy as a systematic field of study.

The early Greeks had primitive and inaccurate astronomical beliefs until the time of Hipparchus. Homer viewed the earth as a flat circle with a solid dome-like heaven above. This belief persisted until Herodotus' time, five centuries later. They thought the sun, moon, and stars moved on the inner surface of the heavenly dome, and the ocean encircled the earth. The Greeks personified the sun as a divine charioteer. They lacked an understanding of the ecliptic and had no common era for dating. Thales, an early Greek philosopher, made significant astronomical contributions, including determining the year's length and calculating eclipses. Anaximander, another philosopher, focused on planetary magnitudes and distances. While their ideas seem outdated today, they laid the foundation for future astronomical knowledge.|"['1.

In ancient times, Greek astronomers made significant contributions to the field of science. Anaximenes of Miletus and other early thinkers speculated about the movements of the sun and stars, but it was the construction of sun-dials that marked a step forward in their scientific endeavors. However, their understanding of the universe was limited, with beliefs that heavenly bodies orbited the Earth and that the Earth was flat. Socrates, a philosopher, focused on human actions rather than celestial bodies, viewing speculations about the stars and planets as futile. Pythagoras introduced the idea that the sun was the center of the universe, although his theories lacked scientific rigor. Despite their shortcomings, these early astronomers laid the groundwork for future scientific exploration.|"[""1.

Aristarchus, an ancient astronomer, challenged the common belief that the Earth was at the center of the universe. He proposed a heliocentric theory, suggesting that the Earth orbits the Sun. Although he lacked concrete evidence for his theory, he made significant contributions to astronomy. Archimedes and Eratosthenes, other prominent figures, further advanced astronomical knowledge. Eratosthenes accurately calculated the Earth's circumference, a remarkable achievement for his time. The School of Alexandria, where these scholars resided, became a center for astronomical discoveries. Hipparchus, a key figure from this school, laid the foundation for modern astronomy by developing methods to predict eclipses and accurately determine the positions of stars. His work on the Precession of the Equinoxes remains a significant contribution to astronomy.|"['1.

Astronomy did not advance for three centuries, despite improved methods. Posidonius built an orrery showing the daily movements of the sun, moon, and five planets. He calculated the earth's circumference differently than Eratosthenes. From Hipparchus to Ptolemy, little progress was made due to lack of precise timekeeping tools, imperfect tables, and no telescopes. Greek astronomers' theories were grand but limited without telescopes. Julius Caesar reformed the Roman calendar, adding days to correct it. He worked with astronomer Sosigines to make the calendar a civil matter, based on the sun. Romans used sun-dials and water-clocks to measure time until the twelfth century when clocks were invented. Ptolemy, the last ancient astronomer, believed in a stationary Earth within a rotating celestial sphere. He did not support the heliocentric theory.|"['1.

The great civilizations of the past left behind incredible material achievements, many of which were later destroyed by invading barbarians. This decline in ancient glory can be attributed to the internal state of these empires, particularly under the rule of the Roman emperors. The works of historians like Herodotus, Pliny, and Livius shed light on the geography and resources of these ancient nations. The perpetual wars of antiquity were fueled by personal and tribal conflicts, with military art being an early focus of society. The Iliad of Homer provides one of the earliest depictions of war, highlighting individual heroism and battles fought with swords, lances, and shields.

The ancient Egyptians were skilled in military tactics and weapons, with a focus on chariots, horses, and engines for reducing fortified towns. Despite their ingenuity, they preferred peace and agriculture. The Assyrians and Persians were more warlike, excelling in cavalry, unlike the Egyptians. The Greeks, known for their warlike nature, had no standing armies but relied on patriotic citizen militias. The Spartans introduced the phalanx formation, making their army nearly impregnable. Philip of Macedon improved the phalanx, increasing its depth and adding heavier spears. He also transitioned to standing armies and emphasized cavalry. Alexander the Great further refined tactics, concentrating forces and utilizing disciplined troops to defeat enemies.

The Roman legion was an efficient military organization that sustained fierce attacks through discipline and strategy rather than just patriotism and spirit. It evolved over time, starting with Roman citizens exclusively and later incorporating various populations. The legion's main strength lay in its infantry, heavily armored with helmets, breastplates, and shields. They wielded spears and swords, carrying provisions and tools on marches. The legion was structured in ranks, allowing for agility and effectiveness in battle. Each legion also had a cavalry unit and a train of military engines for artillery support. The infantry served for twenty years before receiving a discharge. This military system helped maintain the vast Roman Empire for centuries, adapting to different challenges and enemies.|['1.

The Roman legion, whether comprising four thousand or six thousand men, was organized into ten cohorts. Each cohort had Hastati (new troops), Principes (seasoned troops), Triarii (veterans), and Velites (light troops). The Hastati, the first line, were young soldiers in fifteen groups, each with sixty privates, two centurions, and a standard-bearer. The Principes, in the second line, were heavily armed and splendidly equipped. The Triarii, the third line, were trusted veterans armed with the pilum. The Velites were light troops. In the empire, infantry wore cuirasses, helmets, swords, and daggers, while cavalry wore helmets, cuirasses, and carried broadswords and javelins. The artillery used tormentum for hurling stones and darts, balista for throwing stones, and aries for battering walls. The Romans also employed vinea, helepolis, and turris in sieges.|['1.

In ancient times, fortified cities were crucial during sieges. When defenders were few or provisions scarce, attackers often succeeded. Cities like Tarentum, Carthage, Numantia, and Jerusalem resisted fiercely. Larger cities like Rome and Tyre fell due to blockades. Cyrus outsmarted Babylon with a surprise attack. Famine weakened Jerusalem's defense, leading to its fall. Fortified camps protected Roman legions, delaying enemies. Tribunes led legions, appointing centurions who oversaw soldiers. Centurions were chosen for merit and had authority over soldiers, even inflicting punishment. The hierarchy in a legion was strict, with tribunes holding significant power. The system aimed to reward merit, ensuring capable leadership. In contrast to modern armies, ancient Rome lacked aristocratic distinctions, focusing on merit for leadership roles.|"['1.

During the Roman Republic, significant changes occurred in the organization of the legion. Marius initiated reforms that allowed men of all social ranks to join the legions, leading to a more standardized equipment and armament. The legion was structured into two lines with cohorts spaced between them, eliminating the distinctions between Hastati, Principes, and Triarii. The Velites were replaced by foreign mercenaries, and the cavalry became a separate entity from the legion. The Auxiliaries were troops from allied states, outnumbering Roman infantry and having three times more cavalry. Soldiers were paid a minimal daily wage, with praetorian cohorts receiving higher pay. Praetorian Cohorts were elite troops established to protect the emperor, with special privileges and rewards. Roman camps were meticulously planned, with each soldier having an assigned area. Camps were fortified with ditches, ramparts, and palisades, and soldiers took oaths to maintain order and security. Morning routines included cleaning and watering the camp, receiving orders, and preparing for potential battle.|['1.

The Romans were renowned for their military prowess, which was a blend of art and heroism. Their soldiers were paid in glory rather than riches, and the military was held in high esteem. With exceptional organization and spirit, the Romans achieved remarkable victories with relatively small armies. Battles were fought with swords and lances in hand-to-hand combat, showcasing the soldiers' bravery and discipline. The conquest of various regions over two centuries established Roman supremacy, culminating in the conquest of the world. However, these conquests also brought about luxury, inequality, and civil strife. Great generals like Caesar and Pompey emerged, leading to civil wars and the eventual decline of the Roman Republic.

In ancient Rome, rising to power was challenging. There were three paths to eminence: making money, military service, or practicing law. Cicero, a _new man_, chose law, unlike Caesar, a patrician. With few influential friends, Cicero struggled initially. His fame grew when he defended Roscius against Sulla, Rome's powerful man, showcasing his logical prowess. Cicero's health suffered from the strain, prompting a tour of Greece and Asia Minor. He returned at thirty, married Terentia, and focused on his law career. To enter the Senate, Cicero needed political office. As a Roman lawyer, he didn't charge fees but received gifts and legacies. His success prosecuting Verres in Sicily marked the start of his public career, surpassing Hortensius, the bar's former leader.|"['1.

Upon returning to Rome, Cicero faced a troubling situation. Caesar and Pompey were at odds, forcing Cicero to align with one of them. However, he found both to be untrustworthy. Caesar, while talented and noble, was also ruthless and posed a threat to the nation's freedom when he crossed the Rubicon.

Cicero reluctantly sided with Pompey as the lesser of two evils, although his vacillation drew criticism. Ultimately, Cicero's loyalty to Pompey led to his downfall after the Battle of Pharsalia, where he ended up pleading to Caesar for mercy.

These women, along with others, were celebrated for their social charm and intellectual gifts, despite their questionable morals. The society back then valued bright and witty women who held sumptuous banquets and engaged in demoralizing pleasures. Modest and virtuous women were confined to domestic duties and lacked influence in society. The women who were most sought after were those who captivated men through their physical and intellectual appeal. Saint Paul's teachings emphasized the importance of modesty and sobriety in women's appearance and behavior. Under Paganism, women's influence tended to pull men down rather than uplift them, especially those who excelled in society.

In ancient times, the concept of home under Paganism lacked the warmth and charm that we associate with it today. For the poor, homes were often dirty and uninviting, while the rich lived in flashy yet uninspiring spaces. Women, in particular, suffered in this environment. Without education or respect, they were seen as mere decorations or servants, unable to rise as equal companions to men. Paganism perpetuated the idea of women's inferiority, leading to their neglect and mistreatment. Women were valued for their looks and domestic skills but had no means to thrive beyond these roles. This lack of education and equality not only dimmed the radiance of homes but also kept women from reaching their full potential. Paganism focused on earthly desires and pleasures, neglecting the soul's immortal nature. While some individuals rose above these limitations, the majority, especially women, were confined to lives devoid of spiritual fulfillment and lasting joy.|"['1.

Paganism, an ancient belief system, did not consider the soul's future, neglecting human aspirations. It failed to nurture virtues, morals, or affections. It rejected gentleness, warmth, and empathy. Womanhood suffered, devoid of spiritual depth and noble sentiments. Paganism stifled enthusiasm and poetic fervor, leaving women cold and indifferent. Without soulful connections, society lacked real depth. Stripped of spiritual essence, women were reduced to mere adornments, seeking only physical beauty and indulgence. Their true worth and potential were overlooked, leading to shallow lives focused on trivial pleasures. Paganism's disregard for the soul's depth left women unfulfilled, trapped in superficial pursuits. Women, denied recognition of their inner strength, were confined to domestic roles, devoid of purpose beyond physical appearance.

In ancient times, men sought excitement in the circus and theatre, forsaking the sanctities of married life and the companionship of women. Society, as we know it today, was born among German ancestors and thrived in the glories of chivalry. Only with the influence of Christianity did noble women like Paulas and Marcellas rise to dignify human friendships and inspire reunions of cultivated women and gifted men. Society was transformed into a place where the brilliance of the mind and soul surpassed physical beauty. However, even with these advancements, women's loftiest aspirations were not fully met. The soul of a woman craves intellectual companionship, friendships, and religious fulfillment. It is through the teachings of Christianity that women found true social banquetings, and only this divine influence can keep their souls alive amid life's burdens and duties. Women should be grateful for the dignity and blessings Christianity has bestowed upon them, triumphing over the heartless slaveries of Paganism.|"[""1.

The Roman Empire once stood as a beacon of glory but now is clouded in oppression and injustice. The once noble virtues have been replaced by vice, and the masses suffer while the fortunate bask in false glory. Laws meant for good are twisted for selfish gain, and art is tainted. Noble aspirations have vanished, and the wise retreat in despair. Poets praise tyrants, and pleasure-seeking rules. While Rome enjoyed stability under imperial rule, liberties were crushed, and voices silenced. The emperors' whims dictated life, and dissent was punished. Despite the facade of order, corruption and cruelty thrived. The people were kept content with distractions while their rights eroded. The empire's descent into despotism marked a tragic loss of freedom and noble ideals.|"[""1.

In ancient Rome, rulers like Titus, Hadrian, and Marcus Aurelius were known for their virtues and talents, promoting public prosperity. However, the imperial despotism of the Emperors, whether good or bad, led to the degradation of the people and the extinction of patriotism. The aristocracy, with their enormous fortunes and moral decline, widened the gap between social classes, leading to a pursuit of money and power. Rome became a city of extreme wealth and extravagance, with senators owning whole provinces and freedmen amassing fortunes in the hundreds of millions.

Slavery was a destructive force in the Roman State, more damaging than political misrule. It led to the downfall of the empire by destroying the character of its people. Slavery made men weak, cruel, and idle, depriving them of their natural rights. Paganism, the prevalent belief system, failed to recognize the equality and brotherhood of all people. Women suffered greatly under this system, losing their rights and being confined to domestic roles. Their education was poor, and they were treated as inferior to men, leading to a lack of respect and dignity. Women were often married without consent and could be easily divorced. They were valued for their household labor and were seen as objects rather than equal partners. Their pursuit of happiness often revolved around material possessions and superficial pleasures, lacking depth and genuine connections. Women resorted to deception and cunning to navigate their restrictive lives, with little opportunity for personal growth or noble pursuits.|"[""1.

In the ancient Roman society, women were often depicted negatively by Juvenal, painting them as deceitful and degrading. While his portrayal may have been exaggerated, it highlighted the lack of virtue in many women of that time, except for those who embraced Christianity. The virtues of notable Christian women like Perpetua and Felicitas contrasted with the common behavior of most women who were often victims or slaves, seeking revenge through betrayal and deceit. Additionally, the gladiatorial shows and festivals in Roman society were a major source of entertainment but also desensitized people to violence and cruelty. These events, such as gladiator fights and animal hunts, captivated the public's attention and diverted them from more intellectual pursuits, contributing to a culture of excess and bloodshed. The grand spectacles in arenas like the Circus Maximus and the Amphitheatre of Titus attracted massive crowds, further fueling a society obsessed with violent entertainment and lavish displays.|"[""1.

In ancient Roman society, the pursuit of pleasure took precedence over industry and hard work. The rich were financially supported by contributions from conquered lands, while the poor were sustained by public funds. This led to a society where people indulged in leisure activities without concern for labor. Public baths, initially intended for health purposes, became hubs of idleness, intrigue, and vice. The emperors and nobility frequented these baths, engaging in excessive bathing and lavish practices. The baths were adorned with luxurious decorations, paintings, and sculptures that encouraged debauchery and excess. Money-making and material wealth became the primary focus of society, leading to widespread corruption and a decline in moral values. The pursuit of money overshadowed all other aspects of life, causing a deterioration of societal foundations and values.|['1.

The ancient Greek philosophers celebrated their poverty, but in Roman society, poverty was a disgrace. Juvenal remarked that a man's wealth determined the trustworthiness of his word. People were more interested in a person's income than their character. Poverty made individuals objects of ridicule. In Rome, a person's estate and possessions were more important than their virtues. The wealthy were revered, while the poor were disregarded. Acts of charity were rare, and the sick and suffering were abandoned. Success and prosperity, regardless of how attained, commanded respect and influence. Roman society was marked by extreme inequality, with the rich holding all power. The moral fabric of the empire was deteriorating, leading to its inevitable decline. The decadence and moral decay of Rome were beyond redemption, paving the way for its downfall.|"['1.
