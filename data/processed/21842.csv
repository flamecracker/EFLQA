At Dock's place, the boys found a modest home due to his father's drinking and his mother's struggles to provide for the family.

Carl's chum reassured him, saying it wouldn't hurt to outbid Mr. Culpepper for the paper. They discussed how Dock might react, possibly trying to scare Mr. Culpepper into lowering his price. Carl worried when a new boy came from the grocery, fearing Dock and Mr. Culpepper might strike a deal. Carl sought information from Mrs. Joslyn, who shared Dock's recent late-night activities. She mentioned Dock's father's change in behavior and speculated on Dock's future actions. Carl felt relieved after learning about Dock's family situation. He thanked Mrs. Joslyn, emphasizing the importance of keeping their conversation secret. Mrs. Joslyn promised to keep quiet and expressed her interest in the unfolding events.

Tom presented a thrilling plan to his friends, sparking excitement about an upcoming hike to Big Bear Mountain. The group anticipated a cash-based adventure akin to foraging, with no member of the Black Bear Patrol willing to miss out. The hike was set to begin with a march out of town, and the return trip by water promised a relaxing end to the journey. As the days passed and school came to a close, the scouts eagerly discussed their plans. Despite potential trouble from another group of hikers, the boys remained determined to embark on their adventure. The scout master, Mr. Witherspoon, looked forward to accompanying the boys, hoping to share in the joy of the anticipated hike.|"['1.

"""What did you do to them?"" asked Mr. Witherspoon, with an amused smile, for he liked to see these alert boys figure out their own plans and was greatly interested in listening to their discussions as they worked them out.

""Cooled 'em off, eh?"" chuckled Josh, whom the account seemed to amuse very much. ""Well, that isn't a bad idea, fellows. Frog ponds have their uses besides supplying messes of delicious frog-legs for eating. Anybody know of a pond that's got a nice green coating of scum on the top? That's the kind I'd like to see Tony and his bunch scrambling around it.""

""I don't believe in knuckling down to any ugly lot of fellows that chooses to knock up against us,"" and Josh must have expressed the feelings of most of those present when he said this, for there was a chorus of ""my sentiments exactly,"" as soon as he finished.

Then, somehow, all eyes began to turn toward the scout master. They had come to think a great deal of Mr. Witherspoon. He seemed to have a great love for boys implanted in his heart, and was thus an ideal scout master; for there was always an exchange of sympathy between him and his charges.

Tom and Carl were preparing for a camping trip. They carefully planned their supplies, ensuring they had enough for everyone. Each scout was assigned a specific task, like carrying a frying pan or looking after the coffee pot. The boys organized two messes, each with its own set of cooking utensils.

As they anticipated a lunch break, Tom shared that a cold spring was nearby for a refreshing drink. Eager to rest and eat, the scouts showed renewed energy. Felix mentioned how scouting had opened his eyes to the world around him. Later, when a dog approached, Felix and Rob grabbed clubs to protect their friend, Billy, who got caught in a wire fence.

Thirty minutes before sunset, both fires crackled vigorously, signaling the start of supper preparations. The aroma of coffee brewing and food cooking filled the air, exciting the hungry boys. Surrounded by towering trees in the woods, the scouts were eager yet some felt uneasy about spending the night in such solitude. As the boys enjoyed a delicious supper, the scout master, Mr. Witherspoon, watched with pride. He cherished his young charges and marveled at their growth since joining the troop.

Tom and his friends ventured into the wilderness, facing challenges without a clear path. As they rested at noon, a storm approached. Tom warned against seeking shelter under a tree during a thunderstorm, explaining the danger of lightning strikes. Mr. Witherspoon suggested finding a safe spot away from isolated trees to wait out the storm. The group listened to the growing thunder and watched the lightning, preparing for the impending rain. They scanned the surroundings for a secure place, seeking refuge under an overhanging rock ledge to shield themselves from the storm's fury. Despite the discomfort and fear, they remained vigilant, prioritizing safety above all else in the face of nature's power.|"['1.

Mr. Witherspoon was amazed by what he saw. He immediately told his group to rush to the spot. As they arrived, the rain started, and they found ledges of stone sticking out. The wind howled, trees fell, and lightning struck with a deafening roar. Horace, trembling, admitted his fear of lightning but vowed to face it. The storm made conversation impossible. Josh noted they kept their jackets dry, unlike others. The scout master explained the storm's rotation. They left the ledges and saw a shattered oak where the magnificent tree stood before. They were grateful for their shelter and safety. The rain would soon stop.|"['1.

Around nine o'clock, the group decided to resume their hike. Mr. Witherspoon suggested they avoid going further up the mountain after the avalanche, opting to circle the base instead. Consulting the map, they realized they were close to a pond. Excited about the idea of fishing, they planned to return in the morning. Setting up camp by the water, they enjoyed a comfortable night. The next day, they fashioned a makeshift canoe and paddle to explore the pond. While fishing, they heard dogs approaching, likely chasing game. Paddling quickly, they marveled at the log's speed. The boys caught several fish, enjoying the thrill of the moment.|['1.

Tom gave instructions as if he were the pilot. The deer saw them coming but feared the hounds more. Josh was thrilled and guided the paddler to intervene between the deer and the dogs. Felix paddled to block the hounds, and the boys waved and shouted to keep the dogs at bay. The buck fled, leaving the dogs baffled. The boys discussed the cruelty of hunting deer with hounds, which was now banned. They suspected the wild pack was once domesticated. Fishing resumed, and they found success near the water grass.

A peculiar group left the camp. Stanley snapped a photo of the litter bearers for a keepsake. Walter, recovering, lifted his head to be part of the scene. The journey with the injured boy would last about two hours, taking care to find the easiest path. The return would be quicker. The litter bearers cautiously navigated the trail, with one leading to avoid rough spots. Every step was deliberate to prevent jolts for Walter. The progress was slow but steady. They reached a house where a man, for his health, offered help. The scouts' efficient care impressed him. Mr. Witherspoon decided to stay overnight. The boys were relieved the hike could continue.

Tom estimated that the intruders may have lingered around the camp for a while before plundering it.
