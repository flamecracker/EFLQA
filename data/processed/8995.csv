There, to be sure, Mrs. Redding was found sitting in a wicker-work chair under the shade of the grapevines, with a big basket of mending at her side. It looked so homely and country-like to find a person thus occupied in the middle of a busy city, that Katy's heart warmed to her at once.

During their time in the historic city of Rouen, Katy and her companions observed the French manners closely. They marveled at how politely the locals interacted with each other, especially the courteous way they treated service staff. This experience prompted Katy to adopt the same polite behavior, bowing and speaking softly with respectful prefixes. As they explored the city's landmarks like the Cathedral and Palace of Justice, Katy's gracious demeanor influenced Mrs. Ashe and Amy. The guides and locals appreciated their efforts to embrace French civility. Transitioning to modern Paris, the group settled in a pension near the Arc d'Étoile. However, the dampness of the rooms dampened their spirits. The gloomy November weather in Paris, with its fog and wet streets, made exploring the city less enjoyable. Amy's cold confined her indoors, adding to the subdued atmosphere. Despite the challenges, Amy found solace in teaching French to their English maid, Wilkins, who struggled with pronunciation. As they prepared to leave Paris, Katy, although appreciative of some aspects of the city, was ready to move on, feeling that there were more captivating places to explore in Europe.|"['1.

The next day, while driving down the Champs Élysées, a bright red wagon caught their eyes, carrying bundles from the Bon Marché. They journeyed southward, passing through bustling towns and vineyard-covered lands. They glimpsed ancient Roman ruins and snowy mountain peaks in the distance. As they woke from their slumbers, they found themselves in a transformed world. Autumn had given way to a vibrant summer scene. The Mediterranean Sea appeared, its blue waters dotted with white sails and gulls. They reached Marseilles, a paradise with green woods, blooming flowers, and a picturesque coast. Their journey ended in Nice, a lively city bathed in sunshine. The Promenade des Anglais bustled with people enjoying the warm December sun. Mrs. Ashe hoped to find her brother, who was with the United States Navy squadron in the area. Excited by the prospect of his company, they set out to explore the beach, marveling at the stunning scenery around them.|"[""1.

Katy and her friend strolled along the beach, admiring a stone building that looked like a mix of a house and a castle. They crossed a shallow river where women were washing clothes by pounding them on stones. Katy wondered if people lived in the building. Her friend suggested checking out the Pension Suisse for rooms. Inside, the thick stone walls created cozy window seats with red cushions and beautiful views of the sea and mountains. They decided to stay in a charming suite with a balcony and a garden. Katy felt thrilled to be there, grateful for the experience despite some doubts during their journey. As they chatted, they unexpectedly encountered Mrs. Page and Lilly, who seemed less enthusiastic about their visit.|"['1.

"""Why do you think Katy Carr came to Europe?"" Lilly asked, gazing out the window at the three figures strolling along the beach. ""She's the last person I thought would show up here. I thought she was stuck in that awful place... what was it called?... where they live, forever.""

""I wish they were staying somewhere else,"" Lilly sighed. ""If they were at the Rivoir or one of those places at the far end of the beach, we wouldn't have to see them at all. It's annoying to have unexpected visitors, especially relatives. I'm afraid Katy will be hanging around us all the time.""

""Don't worry, we can handle it. We just need to be polite,"" replied Lilly's mother. ""But we must treat her with respect; after all, her father is my cousin.""

""I won't bring her along every time we go out,"" Lilly declared. ""I won't subject Lieutenant Worthington to a country cousin. I won't let her ruin our fun. So, be prepared, Mom, you'll have to figure it out.""

Unaware of the plans to keep her at bay, Katy returned to the hotel feeling content and thoughtful. Finally in Europe, it was living up to her expectations from maps and books, and Nice seemed like the most wonderful place on earth.

As they reached the Hotel des Anglais, they were greeted by a tall, handsome man in uniform, Ned Worthington, Mrs. Ashe"|"[""1.

The move to the Pension Suisse happened the following morning. Mrs. Page and Lilly were absent, giving Katy the chance to organize without any disruptions. Katy found comfort in knowing they would be staying for a whole month, motivating her to make the place cozy. She rearranged the furniture, decorated with items from their travels, and brought in flowers. After setting up the room, Katy's efforts were praised by Mrs. Ashe. They then prepared for breakfast, with Mrs. Ashe and Katy dressing up while Amy, accompanied by her uncle, joined them.

Katy paused unsure. There wasn't much space on the balcony for three, but she didn't want to leave. Lilly had turned away, engrossed in a seemingly confidential chat. Katy, after waiting, retreated to the sofa and joined Mrs. Ashe and Cousin Olivia in conversation. Lilly's behavior didn't bother Katy, but Mrs. Ashe was less forgiving.

Katy's day started with glimpses of Corsica, followed by French lessons and beach time. Lieutenant Ned joined them for outings, although Lilly was annoyed by Mrs. Ashe's attention to him.

Mrs. Page was correct. Katy was not preoccupied with Lieutenant Worthington's attention. She appreciated his candid demeanor, found him attractive, and admired his affectionate behavior towards Mrs. Ashe and his kindness to Amy. Although she realized he barely noticed her beyond basic politeness, it didn't bother her much. Katy's mind was occupied with intriguing thoughts and plans. She wasn't used to being the center of attention, so she felt no distress from being overlooked. When Lieutenant Worthington engaged her in conversation, she responded openly. However, when he didn't, she engaged in other activities without feeling embarrassed or disappointed. As December neared its end, a grand ball was hosted by the officers on the flagship, a significant event in the lively social scene of Nice. Lilly Page, adorned in elegant white lace with turquoise accents, was the most attractive among the American girls present. She received numerous compliments and invitations to dance. Encouraged by her success, Lilly chose to snub Lieutenant Worthington due to her perceived neglect. Surprised and peeved by her behavior, Lieutenant Worthington turned to Katy, who gracefully declined to dance due to her lack of expertise and height.

She described a game she and Amy were playing, pretending to be fairies. Amy was worried about being turned into an owl if she didn't find red pebbles.

Amy is collecting fifty snow-white pebbles to bury them together on the shingle. If she fails, she might turn into an electrical eel. However, she becomes attached to some pebbles and finds it hard to bury them. We enjoy cozy breakfasts in the salon with coffee and rolls served by a witty garçon. The company at the table is entertaining. Cousin Olivia and Lilly are on their best behavior because of Mrs. Ashe, who is related to Lieutenant Worthington, Lilly's admirer. Lilly hints she might be engaged to him, but Polly might not approve. The young Austrian student next to me is impressive, speaking eight languages fluently. I hear gossipy stories from a woman on the floor below about romantic tales in the house.

Ned Worthington sat next to her on the cloak. The sea displayed shades of gray, violet, and vivid blue like peacock feathers. Katy, grateful, bid the sea good night silently. She had grown fond of the Mediterranean. The day before Christmas, a bundle of laurel, holly, and fruit arrived, transforming the room into a festive paradise. Photographs were adorned with ivy, windows draped with garlands, and flowers filled the air. Mabel and Mary Matilda, with their dolls, enjoyed a feast served by Katy in an Irish accent. Lieutenant Worthington brought parcels for the Christmas tree. Katy playfully scolded the girls for eating too much cake. The small tree bore exotic gifts, including Turkish slippers and a dagger for Katy.

"The following day, they arrived in Genoa, staying at a grand hotel that was once an archbishop's palace.

The guide created echoes in the Baptistery. As they left, they encountered beggars from the Order of Mercy, frightening Amy. The children in the streets were fascinated by Mabel. A little girl showed her wooden doll, making Amy smile. The children giggled and followed them to the hotel. Overnight, the ship sailed past Ulysses' coasts. Katy glimpsed Elba and approached Ostia.

Despite Katy's exhaustion from inventing endless details about the two girls, Amy's appetite for their adventures never waned. Amy even offered to tell Katy a story, but her version lacked excitement, involving mundane activities like having meals and playing. Frustrated, Katy decided to end the tales of Violet and Emma once and for all. She narrated a story where the girls, along with a pony and a basket of goodies, met a tragic end in a snowstorm. Amy's emotional reaction led Katy to regret her actions, realizing she had been unkind. After Amy locked herself away in tears, Katy tried to make amends, but Amy remained upset until late in the day.|"[""1.

"""Come here, my dear,"" she said, reaching out her hand; ""come and sit on my lap and forgive me. Violet and Emma will not be gone. They will keep on living, because you care so deeply for them, and I will share stories about them until the end of the chapter."" She was too sad to enjoy Katy's tales of Circe and her swine as they passed Cape Circello, and the islands where the sirens sang did not capture her interest. As the ""Marco Polo"" sailed into the Bay of Naples under the moonlight, with Vesuvius in the distance, the passengers disembarked. The next day, they woke to a sunny summer day. Flower sellers filled the streets, offering fragrant blooms. Katy marveled at the inexpensive flowers, but soon realized they lacked stems and were wired. Beyond the city, she found satisfaction picking roses and wallflowers. Naples, though beautiful, held a sense of danger with whispers of illness.

Mrs. Ashe bought many things for herself and Amy, enjoying the beauty of Naples despite a sense of danger. Rumors of brigands added to their unease, but the drive to Sorrento was safe and stunning. The cliffside road offered views of olive groves, lemon trees, and the Bay of Naples. Fearful of the driver, they reached Sorrento unharmed. Their hotel overlooked the sea, with a garden of roses and an orange grove. They explored the town, admired the gorge, and took walks along the coast. Excursions to Pompeii and Capri were highlights, with Katy declaring the boat ride back from Capri as the best part of her birthday. The moonlit sea and rhythmic songs made it a magical experience.|"['1.

One day in early February, Mrs. Ashe spoke to Katy about the fast-filling city of Rome and the upcoming Carnival. Concerned about securing rooms in time, Mrs. Ashe shared the urgency with Katy. Despite Katy's nonchalance about her cousin Lilly, she still wished to make arrangements promptly. The conversation took place in their hotel room at the top of Hotel del Hondo in Rome, providing a cozy space despite the Carnival rush. In their short stay, they had explored various historical sites and experienced the charm of Rome. Katy was captivated by the city's ancient allure, finding delight in its fountains, architecture, and picturesque streets. Amidst the excitement, Katy noticed her sister Amy's declining health, prompting thoughts of relocating to Florence for better air.

Amy explained that the cold marble and broken things made her sad. She disliked beggars for being dirty, and the stairs caused her back to ache. She preferred staying with Maria and playing on the roof. The roof was turned into an upper-air garden with gravel, ivy trellises, and tubs of flowers. Amy's playmate was a tame fawn named Florio. Katy, Amy's caretaker, always found Amy happy to see her and would talk about the garden and house. Amy found solace in her fawn companion, preferring it over visiting old churches with fleas. Katy later experienced a moment watching the Carnival from a balcony, where she was surprised by a lime-dust shower. An Englishman threw confetti at her, but a nimble American boy retaliated, sparking a playful exchange.|"['1.

Across from them on a balcony draped in white silk sat a lady of distinction. Officers and officials adorned with medals would enter, bow respectfully, converse briefly, and then kiss her hand before leaving. The lady, with black eyes and dark hair adorned with diamond stars, wore pale blue with white flowers. She reminded Katy of the princesses they used to pretend to be. The lady tossed bonbons towards Katy, some hitting the mark and others falling astray. Katy received a variety of gifts, including a gilded box, a silvered horseshoe-shaped box, and a tiny cage with orange blossoms. The lady even bought caged birds to set them free, which Katy found angelic. Katy marveled at the lady's sweetness and the enchantment of the carnival.|['1.

""She's been feverish all night and complaining of a terrible headache. What should I do, Katy? We need a doctor immediately, but I don't even know any here."" ""I'll write to Mrs. Sands,"" she suggested. Mrs. Sands, the American Minister's wife, was a familiar face in Rome. ""She can guide us to a good doctor. I'll write the note now,"" she assured. Mrs. Ashe, relieved, agreed. Katy swiftly penned the message, and within half an hour, the recommended physician, Dr. Hilary, arrived. Amy's condition was uncertain, but the doctor promised to return later for a clearer diagnosis. Despite the looming uncertainty, the family's plans for the day were overshadowed by Amy's illness. Instead of attending the Carnival, Katy focused on gathering supplies and comforting Amy, who demanded a softer pillow.

Mrs. Ashe was completely shocked by the decision and felt lost at first. However, Katy remained calm and had thought ahead about what to do in such a situation. She consulted with the doctor and then spoke to the innkeeper to secure rooms away from others for Amy. Katy prepared the rooms for Amy's comfort and health, following guidelines from a nursing book. The next day, they realized they needed a nurse, so Katy went out to find one. Along the way, they encountered a festive Carnival crowd that seemed out of place given the somber mood.

Katy, absorbed in the present moment, paid little attention to her appearance. Despite her daily neatness routine, she wore an old gray gown that others would find unattractive.

Little Amy's progress at Albano was impressive. Mrs. Swift closely monitored her like a hawk, ensuring she followed a strict routine. This regimen, along with the fresh air, worked wonders. Amy visibly improved daily, even gaining weight, as noted by her mother.
