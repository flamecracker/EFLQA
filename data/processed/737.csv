Nan's brother Bert asked if she was tired, offering to switch seats to watch the passing scenery. Their father noticed Bert's consideration for his sister. Mrs. Bobbsey, leaning in, asked Nan if she wanted to rest her head on her lap. Bert, gazing out the window, wished they were back at the seashore. The train passed fields where a boy herded cows. Bert wondered if a cow might chase the boy. The Bobbsey family consisted of two pairs of twins, Bert and Nan, and Flossie and Freddie, each with their unique characteristics. Mrs. Bobbsey mentioned that Freddie and Flossie would start school soon, possibly sitting together. Freddie, enthralled by a galloping horse outside, was cautioned by his mother. Dinah, the Bobbsey cook, accompanied them on their trips. Flossie showed Freddie a silver cup, a cherished gift from their first birthday. The siblings interacted with their pet cat, Snoop, and observed a large lady on the train.|"['1.

"After some confusion, Flossie's hat was placed on her head, and she and her brother continued toward the water cooler. It was getting dark, and lamps in the car were being lit. Freddie, holding the cup, filled it with water and politely offered it to his sister first. Remembering his manners, Freddie believed in ""ladies first,"" a rule his mom taught him. He spilled water on his coat, catching the attention of a fat lady who smiled at them. The train abruptly stopped, causing chaos. Freddie, being kind, fetched water for the fat lady, but before she could drink, the train jolted. Passengers were thrown off their seats, but the fat lady remained seated due to her size. Looking out, Bert saw camels, elephants, horses, and wild animals on the track."|"['1.

"""There's no danger,"" he assured. ""Please stay seated. A circus train ahead derailed, freeing some animals. We almost collided with an elephant, causing the sudden stop. We'll continue soon."" Bright lights illuminated the scene as circus and railway workers handled the situation. Mr. Richard Bobbsey and his wife Mary, parents of the Bobbsey twins, lived in Lakeport by Lake Metoka. Mr. Bobbsey worked in lumber, near the lake where the twins boated. Their home had a lawn and a garden tended by Sam Johnson. The twins, Bert and Nan, were tall and thin, while Flossie and Freddie were short and chubby.

The task of rounding up the escaped animals was progressing quickly. While some passengers observed, the Bobbseys remained seated, with Mr. Bobbsey deeming it wise. Capturing the monkeys proved to be the most challenging, but eventually, even this was achieved. The wait became tedious once there was nothing left to see, prompting Mr. Bobbsey to seek information on the duration of the delay from a railroad employee. The conductor informed them that due to a severe circus train wreck blocking the track, they might be stuck for another two hours. Mrs. Bobbsey suggested walking to the nearby trolley line to get home faster. Despite searching for their missing black pet, Snoop, he was nowhere to be found. Mr. Bobbsey learned that the circus fat lady had safely continued with another part of the circus train. While unsure about Snoop's whereabouts, they decided to head home and would return the next day to inquire further.|"['1.

With everyone in the small group carrying items, the Bobbsey family walked through the fields toward the far-off trolley line leading them closer to home. The moon shone brightly overhead, casting a clear path through the fields. Nan and Bert chatted about the circus wreck, reminiscing about the amusing moments of capturing the circus animals. Mr. Bobbsey briefly pondered the possibility of a wild circus animal escaping. Mrs. Bobbsey gathered her children protectively as they heard a noise approaching. The group noticed a large white dog, wagging its tail happily. Mr. Bobbsey reassured the children and attempted to deter the dog from following them, but the friendly canine persisted, joining them on their journey.

Freddie and Flossie walked with their newfound dog friend towards the trolley car. Mr. Bobbsey, puzzled by the valuable dog's presence, wondered what to do if the children insisted on keeping it. As they approached the road, they saw an oncoming trolley and an automobile, driven by their neighbor Mr. Blake. He kindly offered them a ride home in his empty auto, which they happily accepted. The strange dog eagerly jumped into the car. The Bobbsey family enjoyed the short journey, sharing stories of their adventures. Arriving home, they were greeted by Sam and Dinah, who helped with their belongings. Grateful for the ride, they bid Mr. Blake goodbye, reflecting on their delightful summer and looking forward to the children returning to school.|"['1.

Mrs. Bobbsey mentioned that Dinah was a great help without any complaints. Flossie and Freddie tried kindergarten for a few days but didn't like it. Flossie suggested naming their new dog Snap and not Snoop, in case their cat returned. Excited, they used a hoop for Snap to jump through, showing off his circus tricks. The family realized Snap might have escaped from a circus train wreck. Later, a small fire broke out near Mr. Bobbsey's lumber yard. Mrs. Bobbsey rushed downstairs upon hearing the alarm. Freddie didn't want Snap to get lost, so he didn't mind when Snap was locked in the stable. The fire was contained, and the children were fascinated by the firefighting efforts.|"[""1.

Freddie had a wonderful time helping a real fireman put out a small fire with a hose. Even though the fire was almost out, Freddie was thrilled to assist. The following day, Mr. Bobbsey wrote a letter to the circus manager about a lost silver cup and a circus dog they found. The Bobbsey twins and their friends enjoyed various games and activities in town. Bert and his friend Charley rowed a boat on the lake, while Flossie, Freddie, and their friends watched Snap, the circus dog, perform tricks. One day, Danny Rugg claimed Snap belonged to Mr. Peterson from Millville. When Danny approached, Freddie dropped the hose, spraying water at Danny. Bert bravely faced Danny, spraying him with water as well. Despite Danny's rough behavior, Bert stood his ground, defending his family and friends.|['1.

Danny and Bert were in a heated moment, with Danny threatening Bert with a water hose. As tensions rose, Freddie ran towards the house to avoid the conflict. Sam, the colored man, intervened, preventing further trouble. Meanwhile, Freddie returned and helped water the flowers, pretending to be a firefighter. Flossie attempted to make the dog jump over the water but ended up getting wet along with Freddie. Despite the mishaps, the children enjoyed their time outside, playing with water and their dog.

"""Yes, but no news,"" replied her spouse. ""The circus has moved to Cuba and Porto Rico for the winter, and I'll have to correspond from there. It might take a while to hear back since the show will be traveling, and mail down there isn't as efficient as it is here. But we may find the fat lady and the cup one day."" The Bobbseys found solace in a response from Mr. Peterson regarding their lost pet and cup. Mr. Peterson had lost a small poodle, not Snap. No one had claimed the trick dog yet, so the children could likely keep him. The Bobbseys returned to school after a long vacation. The school bell rang, signaling the start of classes. Many students were still reminiscing about their summer adventures, but Principal Tetlow and the teachers were ready to guide them back to their studies. Nan observed Freddie and Flossie helping new classmates during recess, showing their kindness."|['1.

Flossie and Freddie had a great time in kindergarten, building fairy cities and caves. The teacher was patient, guiding them to work together.

Flossie and Freddie were determined to make the paper hoop themselves, but they ended up with sticky hands and faces. Nan stepped in to help with the pasting to prevent them from dirtying their clothes. Even Nan found it challenging to cover the hoop with paper, especially when the wind kept blowing it away. Grace and Nellie assisted, but the paste ended up on their hands. Bert and Charley, working on their project in the barn, decided to fetch a plank from Mr. Bobbsey's lumber yard. They planned to use it to help Snap, the dog, jump through the hoop held by Freddie and Flossie. Meanwhile, the twins shared their school projects - Flossie made a paper house, and Freddie crafted a paper lantern and chain. The principal surprised the students with a picnic in the woods the next day, ending school early due to the warm weather.|['1.

Snap, the adventurous dog, ignored Freddie's warnings and bravely approached the hidden snake. Freddie, worried about Snap's safety, threw a stone to scare the snake away. Instead, Snap's curiosity grew, and he charged at the snake, tumbling down the hill in the process. To everyone's surprise, Snap emerged victorious, carrying the black object towards the children. However, the object turned out to be harmless. Relieved, the children returned to their group, where they enjoyed games and fun activities.

When the Bobbsey twins, both small and big, left school, the snow fell heavier. The flakes were smaller but more abundant, dancing in the wind and forming piles that would be tough to shovel the next day. Danny Rugg, still holding a grudge against Bert, threw a snowball at Freddie. Quick to react, Bert caught the snowball and retaliated, hitting Danny on the neck. Other kids joined in the snowball fight, some using hard snowballs, but it was all in good fun. The girls not only played but also rubbed snow on each other's faces, giving their cheeks a rosy glow. Some children brought out their sleds, but the snow wasn't ideal for sledding. Bert and Charley made a homemade sled, adding a carpet cushion for the girls.
