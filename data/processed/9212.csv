Let's return to the cozy fireside and listen to the wind's whispers. It might sound like a voice guiding us to write about a New England winter. As Winter nears, the shrieking winds of late autumn signal his arrival. People bundle up, knowing Winter is coming. The woodcutter's axe echoes in the forest, coal prices rise, and peat smoke fills the air. Children see snowflakes dancing outside, signaling Winter's icy grip. Winter, cloaked in white, rules New England, turning hearths into altars. Despite his harshness, Winter shapes the character of New Englanders. We appreciate sleigh rides and warm fires, knowing Spring will eventually chase Winter away. Amidst these thoughts, a storm rages outside, blanketing everything in snow. Passersby struggle through drifts, while a hearse carries a soul to a cold resting place. Burials in winter are somber, as the frozen ground offers no warmth.|"[""1.
