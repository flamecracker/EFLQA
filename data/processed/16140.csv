Once the world was complete and the glistening water shimmered, the Lord gathered the birds to express gratitude for their hard work and dedication. However, when addressing the Woodpecker, the Lord expressed disappointment, calling the bird vain and lazy. The Lord pointed out that the Woodpecker's pride in its appearance was unwarranted, unlike the humble Dove, the majestic Bird of Paradise, and the charming Grosbeak. As a consequence of the Woodpecker's disobedience and refusal to assist in creating water basins, the Lord decreed a punishment. The Woodpecker would wear black stockings instead of silver ones, forever peck at dusty wood, and never drink from the water sources it failed to help build.

Mother Magpie, the cleverest bird of all, set out to build her nest while the other birds were clueless. She gathered materials and built a fence of thorns to protect her home from intruders. Mother Magpie then gathered the other birds around her and taught them how to build their nests. Some birds, like the Oriole, quickly learned and started building beautiful homes. However, some birds were lazy and pretended to know everything already, which annoyed Mother Magpie.

Once upon a time, the birds faced a dilemma. Mother Magpie was the master nest builder, but many birds struggled to follow her example. The Wood-Pigeon, in particular, faced a nest-building crisis. Only managing a basic platform of sticks, she lacked the finesse of Mother Magpie's nests. This led to haphazard nests in the woods, with no protection from rain or safety for the eggs. Despite Mother Magpie's expertise, the other birds blamed her for their own shortcomings. In another tale, the Goldfinch missed the chance for a colorful coat because of tardiness. When finally painted by the Father, the Goldfinch sported a vibrant mix of crimson, black, brown, yellow, white, and gold feathers, making him a standout among his peers.|"['1.

Long ago, a sad tale turned into a story of joy as the first kingfishers found happiness in reunion. These royal birds, with their crests, still grace the waters, building nests of fish bones that float like sturdy boats. Their babies, the Halcyons, rest peacefully in these nests for seven storm-free days in winter, thanks to King Æolus, who chains up the mischievous Winds.

In ancient times, a Peacock with stunning plumage and a melodious voice lived in paradise. Satan, envious and cunning, flattered the vain Peacock to gain entry to tempt Eve. Deceived by Satan's disguise, the Peacock unknowingly helped in the fall of Adam and Eve. As a consequence, the Peacock lost its beautiful voice and was banished from paradise. The Crow, wise and humble, comforted the Peacock's cousin, a Pheasant, who felt inferior. When the Peacock encountered them, he scorned his shabby relative, offering old feathers to freshen up but warning not to wear them in his presence.

Once upon a time, a Hen went down to the river every day to pick up bits of food. Little did she know that the river was home to the biggest, fiercest Crocodile in Africa. One day, mistaking the Crocodile for a mossy log, the Hen hopped onto it, only to find herself in the jaws of the hungry Crocodile. The Crocodile, amused by her mistake, declared she would be his fifth dinner that evening. However, to everyone's surprise, the Crocodile did not eat the Hen. According to the Black Men of the Congo River, the Crocodile does not harm Hens. Despite being a voracious eater, the Crocodile spares the Hen, leaving the reason a mystery.

The Crocodile sighed as he returned to the Congo's banks, finding the Hen plump from feasting in his absence. Unable to escape, she squawked weakly as the Crocodile approached.

As the sun disappeared below the horizon, the Phoenix eagerly began its task. It had to build a nest for the first time atop the tallest palm tree to catch the first rays of the morning sun from the East. Strengthened for the job, its crimson and gold wings carried the Phoenix all over the earth to gather precious materials. The nest was no ordinary one; it was made of silky leaves, grass, and sandalwood splinters. The Phoenix meticulously placed sweet-smelling gums like cinnamon, myrrh, and frankincense inside. As dawn approached, the Phoenix settled on the nest, waiting for the Sun. When the Sun's rays hit the nest, the Phoenix fanned the materials, creating a fragrant smoke.
