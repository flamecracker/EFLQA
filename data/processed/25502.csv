The concept of heroism changes over time and varies among individuals. While one may see central heroism, another might focus on inartistic details of medieval life. The heroes selected may not seem heroic to all, but they were revered in their time. These tales reflect the medieval mind's basic values of honor, loyalty, devotion, and duty. The stories were altered minimally to present them fairly to modern readers, considering the changed circumstances and intellect of today. The selection and retelling of these stories were greatly aided by Mr. F. E. Bumby, B.A., and Mr. W. B. Yeats' permission to adapt ""The Countess Cathleen.""

The English race is a blend of many ancestries, including Frank, Norman, Saxon, Dane, Roman, Celt, and Iberian. Early inhabitants of Britain were cave-men, followed by Iberians resembling Basques. It's believed that the Celts, tall and fair, overcame the Iberians with their advanced civilisation. The Celts contributed significantly to British culture, including tales of Arthur and the Holy Grail. The Romans subdued the Celts, paving the way for the Teutons like the Anglo-Saxons. The Anglo-Saxons faced threats from the sea-faring Danes, known for their ruthless nature and love for the sea. The Viking spirit brought daring action and initiative, shaping England's colonising prowess. The Danish influence extended to Normandy, Isle of Man, and even the English royal family. The fusion of Danish and English cultures was eased by the adoption of Christianity. Ireland, too, faced Danish invasions, with legends recounting the terror they instilled.|['1.

During the Norman Conquest, a second wave of Norse invasion swept over England, submerging the native English population. The chivalrous Norman knights, descendants of fierce Vikings, followed William of Normandy's banner. The Normans, still deeply influenced by their piratical instincts, engaged in sea-fights in the English Channel. The Norman Conquest revitalized England, unifying its people and infusing them with Norman energy. The admixture of races in England, from Iberians to Celts, Danes, Saxons, and Normans, created a diverse nation with varied ideals of heroism. Beowulf, the legendary hero, embodies the ideal of English heroism with his boldness, loyalty, and self-sacrifice against evil forces. The Norman Conquest and the subsequent fusion of races shaped England's history and literature, reflecting the evolving ideals of heroism through different epochs and nationalities.|"['1.

Long ago in Denmark, the mighty monarch Scyld Scefing founded the great dynasty of the Scyldings. Scyld arrived mysteriously in Denmark as a babe, drifting ashore in a vessel filled with treasures. His origins were unknown. As he grew, Scyld expanded Denmark's power and fame until his peaceful passing. The Danes honored him by setting his body and treasures on a ship, sending him off to sea. Scyld's descendants ruled until Hrothgar, a renowned warrior, built the grand hall Heorot. Festivities in the hall attracted the wrath of Grendel, a monstrous foe. Grendel, a descendant of Cain, terrorized the Danes, leaving Hrothgar desperate for a hero to end the nightly attacks. The hall stood empty, a haunting reminder of Grendel's reign of terror.|"['1.

In the land of the Geats, a hero named Beowulf emerged, destined for great deeds. Raised in the court of King Hygelac, Beowulf was a lad of impressive stature and appearance. Although initially seen as lazy and unwarlike, his strength and character began to show as he defeated a renowned champion in a swimming match. Hearing of the monster Grendel's attacks, Beowulf sought permission to aid the Danish king. Sailing with fourteen comrades, they landed in Denmark, catching the attention of the Coast Warden.

The group of Geats, donned in gleaming armor and led by their Warden, followed the stone-paved path to the grand hall, Heorot.

Hrothgar recounted how he shielded Ecgtheow from the Wilfings' wrath, paid the wergild for his crime, and received his oath of loyalty. Despite the challenges faced by Grendel's attacks, Beowulf was determined to confront the monster. Amidst the feast, Hunferth, filled with jealousy, taunted Beowulf about a past swimming contest.

King Hrothgar, full of joy and youth, quickly got his horse ready with Beowulf by his side.

Among the timid Geats, there was one who found it dishonorable to run away - Wiglaf, the son of Weohstan. He was young but a courageous warrior whom Beowulf had honored with gifts and respect. Wiglaf, seizing his yellow linden-wood shield and ancient sword, rushed to aid Beowulf. He scolded his fearful comrades for abandoning their king in battle. Despite Wiglaf's efforts to inspire them, his companions trembled in fear. Undeterred, Wiglaf bravely faced the dragon alongside Beowulf, vowing to stand by his king to the end. As the battle raged on, Beowulf's sword shattered, and the dragon fatally wounded him. Witnessing his king's peril, Wiglaf attacked the dragon, ultimately slaying it. Beowulf, mortally wounded, passed his armor to Wiglaf, expressing pride in his reign and the peace he brought to their land.

Constantine swiftly called for his mother, the British Princess Elene, who, upon learning the truth and converting to Christianity, was urged by her son to journey to Jerusalem in search of the sacred Cross. Elene, inspired by a vision of a radiant Cross adorned with gold and gems, shared her desire to find the Holy Cross hidden from humanity. As Elene embarked on her journey to Jerusalem with regal pomp, she arrived in Judea after a prosperous voyage. In Jerusalem, she summoned a thousand wise Jewish rabbis to answer her questions about the location of the Cross. After reproaching them for their perversity and demanding answers, the rabbis deliberated and selected five hundred representatives to respond.

Once upon a time, Queen Elene sought the True Cross where the King of Angels had suffered. She turned to Judas, hoping he would reveal its location. Judas, torn between revealing the secret and facing death, hesitated. Elene, angered by his reluctance, had him imprisoned in a deep pit for seven days. Starving and weakened, Judas finally relented and disclosed the Cross's hiding place. They found three crosses buried under twenty feet of earth at the hill of Calvary. To determine the True Cross, Judas prayed for a sign. A sweet-smelling vapor rose from the hill, guiding them.

A decree spread worldwide offering rewards to anyone who could cure the emperor's leprosy. Physicians, philosophers, and sorcerers from far and wide attempted remedies, but nothing worked.

King Havelok of Denmark was honored by his people in a grand festival after being acknowledged as their ruler. He sought vengeance against the treacherous Jarl Godard, who was captured during a hunt. Godard's men tried to defend him but were defeated by Havelok's knights. Godard was brought before King Havelok for a fair trial presided over by Ubbe. Found guilty, Godard faced a traitor's death. Meanwhile, Earl Godrich of Cornwall, fearing Havelok's rise, gathered an army to invade England. He rallied his troops, urging them to fight against the Danish invaders who threatened their land. A fierce battle ensued between Havelok's forces and Godrich's army, resulting in Godrich's capture. The English, realizing their mistake, pledged allegiance to Queen Goldborough.

In ancient times, King Havelok and his wife sought to reward their loyal supporters after overcoming many challenges. They arranged marriages for Grim's daughters, one to the Earl of Chester and the other to Bertram, a cook who became the Earl of Cornwall. Additionally, Ubbe was appointed Regent of Denmark. Havelok decided to rule England while rewarding his Danish warriors with gold, lands, and castles. After a grand coronation feast, King Havelok bid farewell to his Danish companions, who returned home. Havelok and Goldborough ruled England peacefully for sixty years, blessed with fifteen children who became powerful rulers.

The men from Icefirth had a tradition of taking their sheep to the mountains for the summer and bringing them back in the autumn. One year, many sheep went missing, including sixty of Thorbiorn's. Olaf Howardson, a brave man, ventured alone into the hills and found all the lost sheep. He returned them to their owners and then took Thorbiorn's to Bathstead. When Olaf arrived, he was met with hostility by Thorbiorn, who accused him of trying to woo Sigrid, the housekeeper. Despite Olaf's good deeds, Thorbiorn's jealousy grew. The following year, more sheep went missing, mostly belonging to Thorbiorn. Again, Olaf found and returned them. However, Thorbiorn's nephew spread rumors that Olaf had stolen the sheep. This led to a confrontation where Olaf was unjustly accused. Later, a widow sought Howard's help to rid her house of a ghost.|"['1.

Olaf went back with the widow and slept in the hall that night. The dead wizard appeared, tore the rug off Olaf, and they wrestled fiercely in the dark. Olaf defeated the wizard outside, breaking his back. Men tended his wounds, praising him as a hero. Thorbiorn, however, harbored hatred. A dispute arose over a whale stranded on Howard's land, unjustly awarded to Thorbiorn. Olaf, for Sigrid's sake, helped Brand the Strong with his sheep, confronting the ghostly wizard again. Olaf defeated the wizard, sinking his body at sea. Brand thanked Olaf, causing tension with Thorbiorn. Thorbiorn, despite his ill-will, decided to marry with Guest's condition of renouncing evil ways. Sigrid, angered by the marriage, left Bathstead, causing Thorbiorn's wrath.

One day, Olaf sought lost sheep and ended up at Sigrid's house. She warned him of Thorbiorn and Vakr approaching with weapons. Sigrid feared they planned evil due to Thorbiorn's hatred towards Olaf. She urged Olaf to leave, knowing the odds were against him. Olaf, brave but outnumbered, bid farewell to Sigrid and faced Thorbiorn and Vakr. Despite Thorbiorn's sword, Olaf defended himself until Vakr's surprise attack. In the end, Olaf valiantly fought but succumbed to his foes. Thorbiorn, dishonourably, took Olaf's teeth as a trophy. The news saddened many, including Olaf's father, Howard, who grieved deeply.

Howard, upon returning to Bathstead, learned that six of Thorbiorn's men had perished while he had lost only one servant.

"The ""Song of Altobiscar"" recounts the tale of Roncesvalles, a day of honor shared by Spain and France. While Roland was actually slain by Basques, Spain elevates Bernardo del Carpio as a national hero who defeats Roland in legend. The French ""Roland Saga"" portrays Roland as a hero of feudalism, evolving over time to include epic battles and treachery. Charlemagne, now a majestic emperor, seeks vengeance on the Saracens for Roland's death. The ""Song of Roland,"" possibly originating from an Anglo-Norman poem, reflects the heroism that inspired William the Conqueror's soldiers.

Peace be with you all, my students, as we embark on a tale of valor and treachery. Charlemagne, the wise and cautious king, received an offer of peace from King Marsile, who sought baptism and vassalage. Roland, the valiant hero, warned against trusting Marsile, citing past betrayals. Ganelon, known for his cunning, advised accepting Marsile's offer to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. The council deliberated, with Duke Naimes suggesting sending a baron to negotiate terms. However, Charlemagne hesitated, torn between trust and suspicion. The fate of Spain and the honor of the Franks hung in the balance as the king weighed his decision. Would Marsile's offer bring peace or lead to further deceit and conflict? The answer lay in Charlemagne's choice, a decision that would shape the course of history.|"['1.

Ganelon rode off and caught up with the Moorish king's messengers, who were delayed by Blancandrin. The two envoys engaged in a cunning conversation, each trying to decipher the other's thoughts. Blancandrin praised King Charles's vast conquests but questioned his intentions in Spain. Ganelon blamed Roland for provoking conflict by presenting an apple symbolizing kingship to the king. Blancandrin subtly suggested Ganelon betray Roland for rewards from King Marsile. Ganelon, initially shocked, eventually agreed to the treacherous plan.

When the Countess heard of the latest tragic event, a sudden realization dawned on her, illuminating a path to help others, even if it meant sacrificing her own well-being. She saw this as a divine response to her plea for guidance and resolved to act upon this newfound inspiration. The Countess made a firm decision, radiating a selfless determination that left her attendants in awe. Despite their silent concerns, she proceeded with her plan. The following day, the merchants continued their soul-buying activities, offering provisions to the desperate villagers in exchange for their souls. However, when the Countess Cathleen arrived, the peasants dispersed, leaving the merchants alone with her. The merchants, driven by greed, inquired about her intentions, boasting about their thriving business amidst famine and fear.

Adam Bell and Clym of the Cleugh devised a cunning plan to deceive the gate-keeper of Carlisle. Adam quickly penned a forged letter to the Justice of Carlisle, sealed it with a false seal, and the two outlaws approached the town gates.

Threatening the gate-keeper with dire consequences for delaying the king's messengers, they flashed the forged letter with its false seal. The gate-keeper, convinced by the seal and writing, opened the gates in reverence. Seizing the moment, Adam and Clym overpowered the warder, took his keys, and locked him away.

During the medieval times in England, King Horn bravely revealed his true identity and defeated the treacherous Fikenhild, reclaiming the castle for King Ailmar. Sir Arnoldin was chosen as the heir, and Horn and his wife sought the steward Sir Athelbrus to accompany them to Suddene. Along the way, they stopped in Ireland, where Sir Athulf won the heart of Reynild, the king's daughter. Sir Athelbrus took charge of King Modi's land, and Horn and Rymenhild finally settled in Suddene, bringing joy to the people. In the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, England learned the importance of strong governance. Initially, peace and justice were maintained by private efforts, evolving to royal authority under the Normans and a growing influence of burghers and clergy. This era saw a rise of men like Robin Hood, who upheld justice in a time of changing social dynamics.|"['1.

Sir Richard returned to Uterysdale to protect outlaws, and Robin Hood lived in the greenwood, helping the poor and opposing oppressors. Hero-legends often mix real history with mythical elements from various eras. People create myths around popular heroes, drawing from folklore to elevate their own national heroes. Hereward, a Saxon patriot, was shrouded in mystery and legend despite being a real hero. His mother, Lady Godiva, tried to guide him towards monkhood, but he preferred physical pursuits. Hereward's wild nature led him to lead a band of youths, causing clashes with his father, Earl Leofric. Despite his wild deeds, Hereward's actions lacked malice, and he was known for his strength and beauty. His defiance against the king and Normans led to his outlawry by his father, Earl Leofric, due to the political tensions of the time.|"['1.

The brave Hereward, son of Leofric, a nobleman in England, refused any help from Godwin's family. He decided to seek his fortune elsewhere, away from his homeland. His father warned him, but Hereward was determined to follow fate wherever it led him. He left for Northumbria to train under his godfather, Gilbert of Ghent, to become a knight. In Northumbria, Hereward proved his bravery and skill, earning respect from his peers. One day, a polar bear escaped, threatening a young girl. Without hesitation, Hereward saved her by defeating the bear with a single blow. The girl, Alftruda, grateful and admiring, asked Hereward to be her champion, sealing their bond with a kiss.

The young noble, Hereward, devised a clever plan to teach the cowardly knights a lesson. They had abandoned Alftruda, a child, to face the dreadful Fairy Bear alone. With the help of Martin, they staged a prank by placing the bear at the bower door to scare the knights inside. When the knights refused to open the door, fearing the bear, Hereward revealed the trick and showed them how he had slain the beast. This act made Hereward a hero in the castle, except for the jealous foreign knights who plotted against him. To avoid their threats and suspicions, Hereward decided to leave Gilbert's castle for a new adventure. He set sail for Cornwall, where he encountered a princess betrothed to a Pictish giant. Out of chivalry and pity for the princess, Hereward challenged and defeated the giant, only to find himself and Martin imprisoned by the vengeful Pictish tribe and the princess herself. Martin, however, slyly freed them from their bonds, and they planned their escape from the prison.|"[""1.
