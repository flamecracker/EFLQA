Lawry acted without hesitation to fulfill his duty, but as he prepared to release the rope, a sudden storm hit the sloop. Mr. Randall, caught off guard, clung to the rail, fearing the worst. The squall tore the sail to shreds, leaving the boat at the mercy of the wind and rain. Despite the chaos, the crew and vessel remained safe. Captain John, however, was displeased with the outcome. Lawry, a skilled waterman, helped navigate the sloop to safety. As the storm subsided, Lawry enjoyed a meal and soon spotted his father's ferry at Port Rock. His father, John Wilford, ran the ferry and struggled to make ends meet despite his wife's efforts to support the family.

After the shower, the sun shone brightly, and the wind calmed down, barely stirring the lake. It was hot, and Mr. Randall had removed his coat, but kept it on his arm. When the ferryman arrived, he boarded the boat, followed by a waiting vehicle. John Wilford, the ferryman, used a pole to push the boat and adjusted the sail for propulsion. The ferry was a large flatboat with sloping ends to allow wagons to drive on and off easily. The slow-moving boat tested Mr. Randall's patience as he aimed to reach Shoreham by five o'clock. Frustrated by the delay and lack of wind, he paced back and forth. As he stepped onto a platform, it unexpectedly dropped into the water, narrowly avoiding a mishap. Near Port Rock was Mr. Sherwood's summer home, offering stunning views of the lake and mountains. Mr. Sherwood, a wealthy man, enjoyed the lake's scenery and aquatic activities. His wife, Bertha, had invited Miss Fanny and Fanny Jane for a visit, promising exciting adventures on their new steamboat, the _Woodville_.|['1.

Lawry had searched everywhere for the missing money but couldn't find it. His father, Mr. Wilford, suggested giving up the search. Lawry checked the ferry-boat thoroughly but found nothing. Mr. Wilford advised Lawry to row up the lake to meet the steamer. Lawry decided to search one last time before leaving. He looked under the boat and found the pocketbook hidden between the planks. This discovery shocked Lawry, realizing his father had hidden it there to make it seem lost. Conflicted, Lawry decided to return the pocketbook to its rightful owner, Mr. Randall. As Lawry was about to act, his father appeared, indifferent to the situation. Mr. Wilford's actions left Lawry torn between exposing his father's wrongdoing or letting him keep the money.|"['1.

Mr. Sherwood fulfilled his promises, but the ferryman, after being examined and committed for trial, refused to provide bail, expressing a desire to avoid returning to Port Rock. Two months later, at the court session, he admitted guilt and received a three-year prison sentence at Sing Sing. Despite the sentence, he had a poignant final meeting with his family, offering comfort to Lawry and his mother. Taking responsibility for his family in his father's absence, Lawry focused on caring for the ferry and farm to support his mother and siblings. With hope in the steamboat he owned, Lawry aimed to settle debts. Supported by his friend Ethan French, he planned to raise the _Woodville_ using oil barrels borrowed from Mr. Nelson in Pointville.

Ethan agreed to the plan and decided to determine the weight each cask could hold in water after measuring them. The ferry took them across the lake to see Mr. Nelson, the cask owner, who agreed to let them use the hogsheads as long as Lawry provided security. Later, Mr. Sherwood offered to secure the oil casks but had doubts about Mr. Nelson's boat. They spent three days preparing to raise the sunken _Woodville_, gathering ropes and securing the casks in a boom. The boys were eager to start the operation, feeling the pressure of the challenge. They used a rope and a stone to secure the cask to the sunken boat, aiming to float it to the surface. With a derrick and a sinker, they carefully attached the cask, ready to lift it and bring the boat up.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Ethan and Lawry decide to do after agreeing to the plan?\nA) Measure the casks in water\nB) Secure the oil casks\nC) Gather ropes for the operation\nD) Determine the weight of the boat\nE) Seek help from Mr. Sherwood', 'Question 2:\nWho agreed to let the boys use the hogsheads for their operation?\nA) Mr. Sherwood\nB) Mr. Nelson\nC) Mr. Woodville\nD) The ferry captain\nE) Lawry', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Mr. Sherwood offer to do for the boys?\nA) Provide security\nB) Measure the casks\nC) Secure the boat\nD) Gather ropes\nE) Determine the weight of the casks', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the boys use to secure the cask to the sunken boat?\nA) A stone\nB) A derrick\nC) A sinker\nD) A boom\nE) A rope', 'Question 5:\nWhat were the boys feeling as they prepared to start the operation?\nA) Fear\nB) Excitement\nC) Doubt\nD) Indifference\nE) Confusion', ""Question 6:\nWhat did the boys use to lift the cask and bring the boat up to the surface?\nA) A derrick and a sinker\nB) Ropes and a boom\nC) A stone and a rope\nD) Mr. Nelson's boat\nE) A ferry""]"|['A) Measure the casks in water', 'B) Mr. Nelson', 'C) Secure the oil casks', 'A) A stone', 'B) Excitement', 'A) A derrick and a sinker']
"Lawry exclaimed, ""We're all set now,"" satisfied with the marlinespike's test to ensure it could be easily removed. ""Let's secure the rope under the keel to the hogshead."" Excited, he ordered, ""Lower away!"" as the sinker descended, pulling the hogshead into the water. ""It's working perfectly. Wait for me to get the guide-rope's other end."" Lawry hopped into the wherry, detached the line from the smoke-stack, and freed it from the stone anchoring it. The experiment had been a success, boosting Lawry's spirits. The plan to raise the _Woodville_ was his own, with Ethan's help in building the necessary equipment. The boys cheered, elated by their progress. As they headed back to the ferry-house, Lawry had to ferry a team to Pointville, briefly delaying their work. Ethan, crafting a boat-hook, encountered Lawry's brother, Ben Wilford, who arrived looking for work on the steamboat.

Lawry and Ethan devised a plan to lift the sunken steamer from the lake. They proposed using canal boats as flotation devices. By filling the boats with water and securing them to the sunken hull, they believed they could raise the steamer incrementally. Meanwhile, Ben, skeptical of their idea, suggested an alternative method that would take longer. An excited discussion ensued, but Lawry and Ethan were determined to proceed with their plan. As they continued their efforts, the casks strategically placed under the steamer began to show results, lifting the stern slightly. However, a new challenge arose as a portion of the keel was lodged on a flat rock. Despite doubts from others, Lawry remained confident in their ability to salvage the _Woodville_ without outside help.|"[""1.

Ethan and his workmate spent the night at the cottage and set off for the Goblins at dawn. By breakfast, they had efficiently sunk casks under the steamer. Despite being teased by Ben Wilford, they stayed silent. At the urging of Lawry and Mrs. Wilford, Ben agreed to run the ferry that day. Excited, the boys hoped to return with the _Woodville_ by nightfall. By midday, more hogsheads were placed, and the steamer started to rise. They successfully hauled up the cables and anchors. The boys were ecstatic at the progress. After lunch, they continued their work. They attached more casks to lift the bow. They discovered the hull's damage and sealed it. The heavy items were moved to the raft to prepare for pumping out the water. Realizing the task would take longer, they decided to pump out the water where the steamer was.|"['1.

It wasn't safe to leave the _Woodville_ near the Goblins with a storm coming. The boys anchored her securely and returned to the cottage, tired but proud of their work. Lawry's mother ran the ferry-boat, impressing him with her kindness. Worried about the boat, Lawry and Ethan discussed the risks. Ben Wilford, envious of Lawry's success, returned home upset. The men worked hard to pump out the steamer, fixing the leak. Mr. Sherwood commended the boys for their skill in repairing the boat. Despite initial doubts, the repairs held up well.

Mr. Sherwood explained his actions from the previous night to Ben Wilford, who had fastened the ferry-boat to the steamer. Ben listened to the explanation and realized his malicious plan had failed. He looked dissatisfied with himself and everyone on board. Mr. Sherwood had checked the boat thoroughly before his men left, ensuring everything was secure. Ben's mother was upset, knowing what her son had tried to do while under the influence of alcohol. Ben helped load the oil-casks onto the ferry-boat and showed a conciliatory attitude, although it seemed he had ulterior motives. The repairs on the _Woodville_ were completed in Port Henry, and Lawry and Ben promised to run the ferry.

Lawry was fortunate to sleep well amidst the excitement around him, helping him endure the pressure. He awoke invigorated at seven the next morning. After turning out, he visited his mother, giving her a hundred dollars and keeping the rest for the boat expenses. At nine, Mr. Sherwood's party arrived. They changed their plan from Ticonderoga to Burlington due to urgent business letters. Ben Wilford, feeling envious, sneaked on board and hid in the forecastle to join the excursion. A few miles into the trip, Ben approached Lawry, suggesting he should be the captain of the boat. He argued that Lawry could focus on navigating while he managed other tasks. Ben hoped to secure a position on the boat and tried to convince Lawry of his capabilities.|"['1.

Ben took the wheel from the young pilot, who let go of it. The older brother, in a friendly mood, acted as if he was the captain, though there was no need for another captain or mate. Rounds, the older deck-hand, took on the mate's duties. With no freight to handle, he only had to manage the gangplank, mooring lines, and deck cleaning. Lawry was hesitant to leave the wheel with Ben, knowing he wasn't always reliable. Mr. Sherwood expressed concerns about Ben's behavior, suggesting Lawry be cautious. Sherwood changed the trip to a business errand to buy gold, urging Lawry to drop him off and continue to Port Kent. Lawry agreed, mindful of the gold's value and the risk of robbery. Sherwood advised Lawry to be careful due to Ben's unreliability, suggesting he could become a pilot or captain if he improved his conduct. Lawry trusted Sherwood's advice and took control of the boat when Ben abandoned the helm, steering it away from a potential grounding.|"['1.

Ben, feeling betrayed by his brother and mother, seethed with anger after overhearing a conversation. Convinced they were trying to belittle him, he vowed revenge, even threatening to destroy the boat. His feelings of persecution clouded his judgment, and he remained oblivious to his own faults. As the boat docked at Burlington, Ben's brother Lawry and Mr. Sherwood disembarked, leaving Ben brooding on the boat. Despite feeling wronged, Lawry hoped Ben hadn't discovered the valuable cargo onboard. Ben, fueled by resentment, remained on the boat as it sailed to Port Rock. The excursion continued, but Ben's thoughts were consumed by thoughts of retribution, oblivious to the potential consequences of his actions.|"['1.

Ethan, who had prepared the furnaces and released excess steam, agreed to guard the room with the gold. Rounds, the deckhand, and the first fireman went to rest, ready for the midnight shift when the boat would depart for Whitehall. Unfortunately, Ben overheard Mr. Sherwood discussing the gold's purchase and decided to steal it out of revenge and greed. Ben lacked moral guidance due to his dissolute lifestyle. Lacking the courage to act alone, Ben enlisted two former companions to help rob the boat. They planned to execute the crime at Port Rock while the boat was away. Ben's associates hid on the steamer, waiting for the opportune moment. They subdued Ethan, tied him up, and threatened others on board with a pistol to keep quiet. The crew was overworked, allowing the robbers to act undisturbed.|"['1.

Ben, Flint, and Baker were each stationed at different parts of the boat. Ben was in the wheel-house, Flint at the fasts, and Baker at the engine. They were up to no good and planned to escape on the steamer. Baker stopped the steam and made the fireman stoke the fires. Ben tried to back up the boat, but it didn't move far from the wharf. Lawry, realizing the boat was moving, ran to catch up. Ben, not a skilled pilot like Lawry, tried to keep the boat from leaving without him. Lawry, seeing Ben at the wheel, jumped onto the boat just as it started moving away. The conspirators were too busy to notice Lawry's arrival. Lawry found Ethan tied up in the saloon and freed him, while the others searched for the missing prisoner.|"[""1.

Mrs. Light prepared supper for the robbers while the girls set the table. Ethan and Lawry devised a plan to capture the villains. As the rogues sat down to eat, the girls made noise to distract them. Ethan snuck up on Baker, slipped a noose over his head, and subdued him. Lawry secured Baker with a rope, and the girls helped tie him up. The struggle ensued, but Baker was overpowered. He was gagged, bound, and placed in a berth. Meanwhile, Flint, the other rogue, was also captured in a similar manner. The villains were left incapacitated, realizing the consequences of their actions. Ben, another accomplice, was spared from the same fate as a gesture of leniency.|"['1.

The task was completed, and the pilot and engineer headed to the deck. Ethan went to his station and halted the engine. Ben, concerned about the sudden stop, repeatedly asked through the speaking-tube but received no response. He then went down to check. Ben feared a mishap might ruin his plan, so he rushed to the engine room as Lawry left from the other side. While Lawry went forward, he heard a noise and found the companionway locked. He freed the crew and explained the situation. Ben was confused by the turn of events. He couldn't figure out where things went wrong. Before he could act, Lawry signaled to move forward. Ben tried to persuade Ethan to let him escape, but Ethan wouldn't budge. When the boat docked, Ben managed to slip away unnoticed. A search was conducted, but Ben was nowhere to be found. Mr. Sherwood, surprised by the news, sent for the sheriff and ordered a thorough search. The sheriff detained Baker and Flint, who revealed Ben's plans. Ben was later discovered to have fled to New York and sailed to the East Indies.|"[""1.

Lawry and his mother, along with Mr. Sherwood, were relieved by his escape, despite his guilt. The captain and engineer of the _Woodville_ were praised for the steamer's safety, as Ben planned to burn it in revenge. Mr. Sherwood vowed to rebuild it if destroyed, showing his dedication to the steamboat experiment. Mrs. Wilford feared the armed robbers. Lawry and Ethan, excited and sleepless, sailed to Whitehall, reaching it before dawn. They rested briefly before heading to Ticonderoga. Lawry's success continued, with the _Woodville_ busy and profitable. The boat was used for moonlit parties, bringing in considerable wealth. Lawry invested the earnings wisely. The season ended in September, having been lucrative. Lawry's dedication and principled approach led to his prosperity, overcoming obstacles and family troubles.|"['1.

Captain Lawry received a government offer to use his steamer, the _Woodville_, as a despatch boat on southern rivers. After consulting with Mr. Sherwood and Mrs. Wilford, they accepted the offer. Ethan was thrilled to go South and be part of active operations. The _Woodville_ departed in October and returned in April after the war ended. The steamer was in high demand as an excursion boat after being repaired. During one trip, there was a push to pardon John Wilford, which was successful. Mrs. Wilford was content with her family's prosperity. On another trip around the lake, the party wanted to rush back to Burlington at night, but Captain Lawry prioritized safety over their demands.
