"Gertrude and her companion walked through the woods in silence, crossing a brook and heading down a lane to Rose House. Inside, the Club members were busy crafting a piece of furniture. Mrs. Schuler was in the kitchen discussing the unexpected events with Moya. They turned towards the pine trees, their thick needles casting a pleasant shade under the sun.

The river occasionally narrowed and widened due to varying soil types and water flow. The Catskills stood out against the sky in the west, more rugged than the Green Mountains. Mrs. Emerson felt sleepy, leaning back comfortably as the girls watched the river, feeling closer to home. The return from the trolley trip was busy, with history lessons reviewed for Helen. Mr. Emerson took charge of Mrs. Tsanoff's affairs, helping her husband find a new job. Mrs. Tsanoff eagerly agreed to move to a farm in Deerfield. The Bulgarians, including twin babies, were sent off with American flags to meet their new employer. Mrs. Tsanoff left tearfully, grateful to everyone. The women started an embroidery class, helping each other learn new skills. They discussed making furniture for Mrs. Schuler's room, debating whether to have doors on the cupboards.|"['1.

The group was thrilled about the picnic planned by the Ethels. Excitement bubbled among the younger ones as they prepared for the outdoor adventure. The children eagerly awaited the day, hoping for clear weather. Dicky, particularly fascinated by Indians, suggested searching for arrowheads in Grandfather Emerson's recently cleared field. The expedition turned into a grand affair, with hampers packed for a tea party. Despite the anticipation, the search for arrowheads yielded only a few finds. Dicky's mischievous spirit shone through as he playfully pinned Vladimir's rompers to a tree with an arrow, causing a brief commotion. The day ended with a cozy fire, roasted corn, sizzling bacon, and warm biscuits, creating lasting memories for the children.|"[""1.

Dicky was rescued by Roger after being tied to a tree, unharmed but with torn clothes. To prevent future accidents, Roger suggested using rubber tips on arrows.

The Native Americans didn't create as many of these as they did arrowheads because they didn't require as many. Dicky felt proud as his brother praised him for his find. They planned to drop off the arrow tips at Rose House on their way back. The walk was filled with imagination, playing Indian along the way. Ethel Blue worried about the warlike game affecting Dicky's dreams. Dicky, caught up in hunting adventures, was oblivious to other distractions. They successfully got the arrow tips from the stationer and hurried back home. The storm hit late that night, causing fear and chaos, especially for the city-dwelling women at Rose House.

As the storm moved away, the wind grew stronger, causing chaos around the house. Shutters banged, chairs toppled on the porch, and bricks tumbled down the chimney, creating a loud roar. Mr. Schuler, startled by the commotion, dropped his candle and was left in darkness. His crutch slipped, and he had to cling to a table for support. Mrs. Schuler, unharmed, helped him into the dining room, where they discovered a small fire in the fireplace. Luckily, water from a pitcher extinguished it. The chimney was damaged, prompting them to use an oil stove until repairs could be made. The Matron comforted the frightened children, and as the storm subsided, peace returned to Rose House.|['1.

Ethel Blue paid close attention. She could relate to similar experiences but didn't realize adults faced them too. She recalled a morning when everything went wrong, making her late for school and affecting her day. Reflecting on it, she understood that her bad mood caused the chain of events. If she had started the day positively, problems could have been avoided. The morning after a storm, everyone at Rose House shared their stories joyfully. Mrs. Schuler informed Mr. Emerson about the house damage caused by the storm. The chimney bricks fell due to the wind, creating a loud noise.

These are small dynamite cartridges that brakemen use to signal trains to stop in stormy weather or when the usual signals might not be seen. The cartridges make a sharp noise but are not harmful unless enclosed in a confined space, like the one where two were accidentally set off. Miss Merriam checked Elisabeth's mouth for dirt, then found coins in a hidden compartment behind a chimney. The investigation revealed that the coins had been hidden for over a hundred years. Helen suggested counting the money, wondering if it was the same bag that had been hidden long ago.|"['1.

"See, here are some small pieces of sealing-wax still attached to the string,"" and Grandfather Emerson cut the cord that was still securing the opening. Before their surprised gazes, a small box rolled out followed by shiny guineas as if they were just released from their confinement. ""Here, young lady, hands off,"" exclaimed her grandfather as Helen was about to open the box. ""Algernon and Patience were not your direct ancestors. Miss Merriam is the appropriate person for this task."" ""Mine?"" she echoed, ""mine?"" but as Mr. Emerson insisted and the other elders congratulated her, the girls embraced her, and Roger formally shook her hand, she started to grasp that this small fortune truly belonged to her by inheritance and not out of the kindness of her friends. ""And here is the one that Ayleesabet discovered,"" Mr. Emerson added, pulling it out from his pocket. ""This makes the five hundred and seventy-second. Young Vladimir's prize has vanished, unfortunately. He likely sold it to someone passing by who recognized its value and didn't bother to find the owner or pay the child its full worth.""
