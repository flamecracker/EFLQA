"Hal provided various papers to the general, who promptly broke the seals and read them. Suddenly, he leaped up and hurried outside, giving sharp commands to his staff. Soon, his voice faded. ""You've angered me,"" he stated. ""I won't spy for either of you again. Next time, find help elsewhere."" Distracted, he collided with another figure, pushed back by the impact. Annoyed, Stubbs was about to speak but noticed it was General Petain. Before Stubbs could apologize, Petain grabbed him and pushed him into the tent.

For two days, a fierce battle unfolded at Verdun. German artillery bombarded French positions relentlessly, destroying fortresses protecting the city.

Quickly, the Germans started building defenses facing the second French line. Skilled hands made the breastworks appear almost magically. They fortified calmly under the French infantry's rifles and heavy guns, despite casualties. In the distance, the German batteries began firing at the second French trenches, aiming over the victorious German infantry. The infantry action calmed down, and the big guns' duel resumed. Chester, sent by General Petain, arrived to witness a scene like Hal had seen earlier. The German attacks succeeded across the front, except for a few points where the French still held on. These spots were now vulnerable and had to be abandoned. Hal and Chester returned to their posts, disappointed by the day's outcome. They were kept busy with dispatches, and after a long day, found themselves alone together. They discussed the day's events and the upcoming challenges. Later that night, they were summoned by General Petain, along with the entire staff, to receive instructions for the next day. Amid soldiers gathered around a campfire, they discovered a group of men playing a light-hearted game under a blanket, causing laughter and amusement.|"['1.

Hal stated that they couldn't solve the mystery alone and needed to stay cautious. Anthony Stubbs, a war correspondent, got permission from General Petain to tour Verdun and its fortifications. An officer guided Stubbs, sharing insights on the battlefield. Verdun looked like a saucer with the town low and encircled by crests held by the German army. The forts were active, bombarding the area. The officer pointed out the destruction caused by the shelling, with abandoned streets and damaged buildings. Stubbs saw Fleury, a village in ruins, changing hands between the French and Germans.

The French officer directed the tired boys to rest at the farmhouse near Thiaumont farm. Hal suggested going upstairs for a quieter sleep away from the card-playing French officers downstairs. Finding an empty room at the back of the house, they settled in and dozed off quickly. In the moonlit room, a man silently entered through the window.

Hal assured Chester that he was capable of handling his own problems. The French officers were preoccupied, and Hal doubted Matin would trouble him again. Before dawn, the German artillery bombarded the French lines, prompting the soldiers to swiftly take their positions. Despite the chaos, orders were given promptly. Hal and Chester reacted quickly, observing the troops mobilize. The Germans launched a relentless assault, overwhelming the French trenches.

Hal skillfully defended himself against the German officer's relentless attacks, causing the officer to grow increasingly furious. Despite the officer's anger, Hal remained calm and confident. It became clear to Hal that the officer was a superior swordsman. As the duel unfolded, the German's frustration mounted as he struggled to best Hal. Captain Leroux urgently called Hal to action, prompting him to make a bold move that forced the German officer to retreat. Hal then led his men towards safety, defying the German threats. Despite facing intense enemy fire, Hal and his men managed to repel the German assaults, with the defenders suffering minimal casualties compared to the Germans.

The Germans spotted reinforcements approaching and intensified their efforts to seize the farmhouse before the reinforcements arrived. However, the French cavalry swiftly swooped in around the house, receiving cheers from the defenders. The Germans, seeing the French retreat, pursued them, leaving Chester and his men in the basement. Chester, unable to discern the situation above, noticed a rapid-fire gun left unattended by the Germans. Realizing the Germans were retreating due to French infantry support, Chester decided to offer the Germans a chance to surrender.

Chester walked back to where the road curved, out of direct fire but still able to demand the surrender of the Germans. Suddenly, a crash of rifles echoed, Germans fell from their saddles as horses reared and stampeded. The machine gun fire ceased, and Chester advanced. The German officer who scorned him moments ago now offered his sword. Chester ordered them to march towards the French lines under threat of the rapid-fire gun. The French troops praised Chester's bravery for the capture and execution of the enemy. Chester dryly remarked on the lack of support.

The boys were freed from their restraints by a stranger who had overheard a conspiracy brewing. They followed him out of the tent, where Hal recognized him. The stranger, Jules Clemenceau, explained that he had seen the boys in trouble and had come to release them. He mentioned a mysterious pea that had caught his attention and hinted at a larger conspiracy involving plotters from different nationalities.

Hal and Chester were determined to bring an urgent matter to General Petain's attention. They had discovered a dangerous conspiracy led by General Pombrey, urging French and British soldiers to lay down their arms at the same time as the Germans. Knowing the Germans would not honor such an agreement, they realized the soldiers would be in grave danger.

General Petain listened intently as Chester recounted how they acquired the two peas, their capture by Anthony Stubbs, and their escape. He frowned at the mention of General Pombrey.

During the intense fighting at Verdun, the battles, now called skirmishes, lasted for hours, sometimes days, with the advantage shifting between the German and French forces.

Nor, for the matter of that, did any men in the French army complain, be it officers or soldiers. They courageously carried out their duties without hesitation, even enduring long hours without sleep between almost constant battles. As the Germans were pushed far east of the Meuse, the victorious French army took a moment to rest under General Petain's command. Despite the German Crown Prince's relentless assaults, the French, though exhausted, displayed unwavering courage and successfully defended their positions. Realizing the futility of further attacks, the Crown Prince ceased his assaults, avoiding unnecessary loss of life. Hal and Chester were summoned by General Petain for a crucial mission to gather vital enemy information.

Hal, despite his speed, struggled to catch up with Stubbs, who had taken the lead with quick strides. Finally reaching him, Hal shared his plan: they couldn't outrun their pursuers, so they decided to hide in a tent, knock out the occupants, and wait for the coast to clear. As they approached a tent, Hal noticed a figure that had spotted them. Determined to silence the man, Hal sprinted towards him, prepared for a potential confrontation. Stubbs, struggling to keep up, followed closely behind. Hal reassured Stubbs and pointed out the tent where they would hide.

For about an hour, the three fugitives hid in the German tent. They heard voices outside but eventually, all went quiet. After fifteen minutes of complete silence, Chester got off the cot.

Hal sat down to remove his shoes when he heard a sound behind him. Matin, a French soldier who had tried to kill him before, stood a few feet away with a gun pointed at Hal's heart. Matin attacked Hal, but Hal managed to grab the gun. Hal pointed the gun at Matin's heart, and the gun went off, causing Matin to fall. The French camp woke up suddenly. Men rushed to their positions as bugles sounded, officers shouted orders, and regiments formed. French shells flew overhead towards the German lines.

"Chester had delivered his message and noted the intense fighting on the French right, where the battle was fierce and the newly captured positions were gruesome. He expressed concern about potential orders to advance further. By 4 o'clock, the French had secured the German second line at a high cost, prompting the arrival of more reinforcements for another push. Despite the scorching sun, the French infantry, emboldened by earlier successes, advanced with confidence and enthusiasm, cheered on by bands playing ""The Marseillaise."" The Germans, though pushed back twice, held their ground, learning from their losses. The French made repeated charges at the seemingly impregnable German trenches until they finally breached them on the fifth attempt, leading to chaotic hand-to-hand combat. German reinforcements and cavalry tried to turn the tide, but the flushed French forces ultimately prevailed in the fierce battle."|['1.
