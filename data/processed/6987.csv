"""I apologize,"" she gasped, concerned about his headache. She gently comforted him, mimicking how Phronsie cared for Grandpapa. Thoughts of Phronsie made her fight back tears.

Mr. King urgently instructed Jasper to assist the old man, while Tom was sent to fetch the doctor. The library quickly filled with concerned passengers. Tom, bewildered by the events, followed instructions and summoned the doctor. Despite being curious, he stayed outside. Later, Tom was informed of his grandfather's serious condition by Jasper. Dr. Jones sternly directed Tom to leave, emphasizing the urgency. Tom, shocked, complied and later learned that his grandfather was in a critical state. Overwhelmed, Tom decided to visit his grandfather, despite the doctor's warning.

Jasper called out to Tom urgently, reminding him that it was not the time to think about anything other than his grandfather's life. Dr. Jones had advised against Tom seeing his grandfather for the moment. Tom, unfazed, retorted that he had already heard about it and that they should leave the boy to attend to his grandfather. The other two boys laughed and walked away. Meanwhile, in the grandfather's state-room, he remained unconscious, holding tightly to Polly's hand. Father Fisher and Dr. Jones consulted over the case, with Phronsie, feeling guilty for wandering off, cuddled up to Polly. Passengers returned to their seats, chatting about the recent events. Fanny Vanderburgh sought Polly for a game of shuffle-board but was unable to find her. Jasper explained that Mr. Selwyn wanted Polly to stay by his side due to his illness.|"['1.

"""I understand,"" Jasper replied, feeling a pang of regret. ""Well, Miss Vanderburgh, since Polly has made her decision, there's nothing more to discuss. Just remember, I agree with her."" Fanny Vanderburgh frowned in annoyance. ""Please, don't include that rude boy in our group activities,"" she snapped, ""I refuse to interact with him. He's terribly uncouth. Just yesterday, he bumped into me like a clumsy elephant, causing me to drop my book, and he didn't even pick it up. Can you believe that, Mr. King?"" ""I know, it was terrible,"" Jasper acknowledged, worried about the complications this presented to his plan. ""But you see, Miss Vanderburgh, he's troubled by his Grandfather's illness."" ""And rightfully so,"" Fanny retorted. ""He's been heard arguing with his Grandfather by Mrs. Griswold, who's in the next cabin.

Fanny felt a wave of alarm wash over her as she realized she couldn't play that morning. Mr. Jasper, unfazed, mentioned they would continue without her. Fanny, feeling embarrassed for the first time, nervously twisted her fingers. Jasper, coolly, decided to find another player, leaving Fanny to join him on the lower deck. Fanny, trying to hide her nerves, agreed to go. Jasper quickly organized a new game, but Tom, feeling gloomy, refused to join. Despite Jasper's efforts, Tom remained despondent. Meanwhile, Mr. Selwyn, recovering from illness, enjoyed the company of Polly and Phronsie. Dr. Fisher and Dr. Jones also visited, bringing cheer. Eventually, Mr. Selwyn invited Polly to play backgammon in the library, eager to escape the constant questions about his health.|"[""1.

"Jasper looked dismayed as he began, ""Oh, Polly!"" but she quickly interrupted, ""Yes, Mr. Selwyn, I do play backgammon, let's have a game."" Together, they assisted him to a cozy corner in the library. Tom Selwyn approached the door, peering in from the shadow. Jasper sat by the old man to watch the game. Suddenly, he noticed Tom, who quickly retreated. Old Mr. King assured Phronsie, ""That child I saw yesterday can eat anything, with a mouth full of teeth."" Mr. King guided Phronsie to a group of steerage passengers. A chubby woman with a baby and other children greeted them. Phronsie offered fruit, and the baby eagerly grabbed a pear. The children happily explored the basket. The mother smiled, revealing her white teeth. Phronsie asked to hold the baby, but Mr. King worried he might cry if separated from his mother."|['1.

Mr. King noticed the clean family aboard the ship and decided it was safe for Phronsie to hold the chubby baby. The baby happily ate a pear in Phronsie's lap. Mrs. Griswold, dressed neatly for the voyage, beckoned her husband to see something. They observed a steerage baby in the lap of a woman, causing a stir. Polly and Jasper excitedly greeted their family from afar, making Phronsie happy. Mrs. Griswold couldn't stop watching the Pepper children and their mother, intrigued by their story. Mr. Griswold, eager to return to his book, found the situation amusing. Despite the commotion, the Kings were admired for their carefree demeanor.|['1.

Mrs. Griswold was so absorbed in observing Mr. King and his party that she didn't pay attention to her husband's grumbling. Tom Selwyn accidentally bumped into the ship's doctor, who coldly passed by. The doctor warned Tom about his grandfather's recent health scare. Meanwhile, in the steerage, the children gathered around Phronsie, who was holding a sleeping baby. Polly entertained them with a story about a funny cat.

The elderly gentleman proudly paraded the deck with his grandson, Thomas, introducing him to everyone. Thomas' sharp eyes gleamed as they chatted with passengers and crew. Meanwhile, Mrs. Vanderburgh, a fellow passenger, observed them with a critical eye. As they paused by her steamer chair, she raised her eyebrows at the old man's appearance. Fanny, another passenger, intervened to ensure her mother was comfortable. Mrs. Vanderburgh expressed concern about the old man's potential intrusion. Fanny, in a disdainful tone, remarked on the commonness of Thomas and his family. Mrs. Vanderburgh reminded Fanny to wear gloves, lamenting the toll the sea trip would take on her hands.

"""Don't worry, Polly,"" Jasper assured her, ""I want to do the same thing. And it will be good for those stiff and proper people to hear some enthusiasm."" Polly understood who he meant, some young Englishmen. One of them immediately raised his monocle and gazed at her as if she were a new creature on display. Jasper glared back at him. ""Yes, we'll go to Scheveningen this morning,"" Mr. King repeated, smiling at Polly, causing her to perk up. ""The carriages are ready, so after breakfast, we'll head out."" Polly's spirits lifted. Mr. King, noticing their reactions, decided to change plans. He allowed Phronsie to make a request to sit on top of the tram-car. This request, accompanied by Phronsie's endearing plea, swayed Mr. King. Jasper was thrilled with the change of plans and hurried to make the necessary arrangements. The group boarded the tram-car, and Mr. King found himself enjoying the experience of mingling with the crowd and securing seats.

Not understanding the language, everything could have gone smoothly, but the French man could read the expression on the face under the white hair. He left his spot in front of Jasper and moved towards Mr. King in a threatening manner. Seeing this, Jasper quickly got up and stood by his father. Little Dr. Fisher also joined in, commanding the French man to leave immediately. The French man, taken aback, looked around and decided it was time to leave. As the group settled back into their seats, Mr. King joked about the encounter, suggesting that having their own carriages might be a better idea.

As Polly and Jasper admired the beautiful surroundings, Polly expressed her wish to stay longer in the charming old woods. When they arrived at the village of Scheveningen, they embarked on a walk towards the Curhaus and the beach. Grandpapa led the way, full of youthful energy, followed by the rest of the group. Down below, a level road led to the Boulevard. Phronsie was captivated by the sight of numerous Bath chairs on the sands. Polly and Jasper, torn between exploring shops and the beach, decided to quickly buy gifts for the boys. Laden with bundles, they rushed to the beach, where Grandpapa and Phronsie were enjoying black Hamburg grapes in Bath chairs.

Jasper and Polly were engrossed in updating their travel journals during their stay in Antwerp. Jasper completed his first book and enthusiastically moved on to the second. Polly, with her love for pictures, quickly filled her red book with beautiful photographs of famous paintings. The cathedral was a favorite spot for the group, where they would sit quietly and study the remarkable artworks before the crowds arrived. After the cathedral, they explored the Musée Plantin-Moretus daily, always discovering something new. Despite their love for cultural sites, they also indulged in fun activities like shopping, visiting the zoo, and attending concerts.

Mrs. Fisher wisely noted that sightseeing can be exhausting and unsettling if not balanced with rest. She decided that Polly needed to rest instead of going out. Grandpapa King agreed, observing that young folks tire themselves out with constant exploring. Polly, unable to sleep, was comforted by her mother's touch and kiss. Grandpapa praised Mrs. Fisher's wisdom. On a boat trip up the Rhine, Polly reflected on the rush to see everything.

Polly stood on the stairs while Adela, complaining about her appearance, stumbled back into her room. Soon, a big splash was heard. Adela's arm was wet, creating a small puddle on the floor. Mrs. Fisher dried Adela's arm and found her a clean waist. Adela's hair was brushed, and she felt ready. At dinner, Tom Selwyn noticed Adela's red eyes and approached her kindly. They played checkers, and Adela beat Tom twice. Despite losing the next games, she kept her cool. Mr. King praised her for playing well against Tom. Mrs. Fisher arranged for them to be called, allowing Polly to sleep. Polly worried about Phronsie waking up late. Mrs. Fisher stayed with Phronsie, and the others went out.|"['1.

"""Oh my goodness!"" cried Polly, ""I didn't mean to disobey, Mom, I really didn't; I'll go."" She quickly kissed Mother Fisher's dark hair and hurried out, feeling uneasy. When she caught up with her group, everyone was bundled up in shawls and blankets. Jasper was waiting for her, and Tom was easily spotted due to his size. Jasper sympathized with Polly's distress, while Tom, unable to assist, looked on helplessly. Dr. Fisher, wrapped in a shawl, joined Polly, Jasper, and Tom. As they headed out into the cold morning, Dr. Fisher skipped back to his wife's room with excitement. Polly, overwhelmed, couldn't break the news to her father.

"An hour later, Polly couldn't sleep and decided to sit on the balcony to write in her journal.

Polly's friend expressed regret at leaving their warm bed, mentioning how their teeth chattered. Losing teeth was nothing compared to losing their handsome Pa at nineteen. Suddenly, Jasper spotted Polly on the rocks and rushed to see. The old woman scolded, frustrated at not finding Pa. Tom and Jasper revealed they had found Pa's pin at the hotel. The group had been staying in Interlaken, enjoying walks on the _Hoheweg_ and admiring the _Jungfrau_. Polly and Jasper loved sitting by the trees, while Phronsie stayed with Grandpapa, imagining tales of the mountain. Passersby observed the group, including the white-haired gentleman and the yellow-haired girl.

Tom beamed with a big smile. ""Oh, great!"" exclaimed Polly, sounding as youthful as Phronsie.

The group, including Mr. King and Mrs. Henderson, gathered on the rocks. As they left the Visp river behind, thoughts of Dresden filled Polly with joy, recalling the memories of Herr Bauricke.

"Polly confidently stated, ""Oh, they won't!"" as one boy approached, attempting to bother the girls. Unfazed, the girls stayed focused on their game. Tom remarked, ""They're just jealous because they can't join in!"" A boy teasing the girls was swiftly dealt with by Tom, who used his fluent French and humor to diffuse the situation.

Picture after picture, cut from railroad guide books, illustrated papers, and it seemed to Jasper gathered as if by magic, with cunning little photographs, broke up the letter, and wound in and out with funny and charming detail of some of their journey.

"Jasper tapped his foot restlessly against a pillar entwined with sweetbrier vines. Suddenly, he paused, hoping no one had noticed. ""The best solution is to follow our assigned spots,"" he finally suggested, trying to sound cheerful. As the stable hands readied the carriages and the horses, the usual excitement seemed lacking. The drivers' distinctive call echoed as they took their positions, and the carriages spun around the fountain towards the veranda. Grandpapa, overseeing the preparations, expressed satisfaction with their promptness. The first group, including Mrs. Gray, the parson, and Dr. Fisher, boarded the carriages.

"""Tom, make him stand up!"" ordered Mr. King firmly. Tom, knowing just what to do, helped Grandpapa rise in the carriage. Grandpapa then declared, ""In about half an hour, at a good spot, I'll switch some of you twelve folks around in the carriages. Spread the word."" He thought, ""It's necessary for the little girl to learn, as she had no mother to teach her. It will benefit her."" Yet, he felt a bit sorry to be the one to instruct her. They crossed the _Tête Noire_ to catch sight of Mont Blanc.

""Yes, I am,"" she exclaimed, nodding her head. ""Grandpapa said so; he really did, Jasper. And I'm going to ride up that long, big mountain on my donkey."" Pointing in the wrong direction, Phronsie added, ""And we're going to see the frozen water, and Grandpapa says we'll walk over it; but I'd rather ride my donkey, Jasper,"" she confided.

Jasper chuckled, ""Oh my! Phronsie, we just arrived! Time flies here. It won't be long before the donkeys come to take us for a ride.""

"Phronsie rode on her donkey, her focus solely on its long ears, unaware of the commotion around her. As the guide led them off, she suddenly wondered about her donkey's name. Grandpapa tried to ask the guide in English and then in French, but it was Jasper who finally revealed the donkey's name, ""Boolah."" The group, including Grandpapa, sang songs joyfully as they rode through the meadows and pine woods. Adela struggled with her French commands to her donkey, but Jasper helped her understand to let the donkey set the pace. Tom, always hearing everything from the rear, teased Jasper good-naturedly.

The group quickly gathered their socks and alpenstocks with sharp spikes, heading down the zigzag path towards the glacier. Guides assisted them as they reached the foot of the rocky path. Tom observed how the alpenstocks were better than risking a broken neck and helped Polly put hers on. Jasper also assisted, showing agility like a schoolboy. Phronsie had her little blue stockings tied on by a guide, and everyone else got ready too. Grandpapa warned them to be careful near the edge. They looked down at a deep green pool, making Mrs. Henderson shiver. As they continued, the parson's wife had trouble with her stocking heel, which the guide eventually tied up.

Mrs. Henderson agreed to let Dr. Fisher examine her foot after a mishap. The guide who had tied her stocking looked concerned. Dr. Fisher quickly untied the stocking and checked her ankle, ensuring nothing was broken. He bandaged it professionally, allowing her to walk back slowly. Mrs. Selwyn suggested Dr. Fisher join the other group, while she would assist Mrs. Henderson. Later, they split into two groups, one heading to _Mauvais Pas_ and the _Chapeau_, and the other returning to the hotel. Polly, despite the allure of Geneva's shops, was ready to move on.

"Polly exclaimed, ""Oh!"" as she saw the magnificent marble statue at the end of the corridor.
