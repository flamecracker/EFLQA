After their exciting adventures on the Great Lakes and Needle Point Island in Lake Huron, the Rover boys were relieved to return to Putnam Hall and their studies, despite them being challenging, as Tom mentioned. They all respected Captain Victor Putnam, the school's owner, who valued the Rovers as much as any other student. The arrival of Jasper Grinder as a new teacher surprised many boys.

On a crisp, frosty day, a group of boys set out on a hunting and camping adventure with John Barrow as their guide. Armed with rifles and shotguns, they skated on the frozen river, pulling their loaded sleds behind them. As they ventured further, John Barrow led them to a spot where wild turkeys perched in a tree. With a loud bang, two turkeys fell, while another was wounded. The boys quickly retrieved their sleds and continued their journey, leaving the frozen falls behind. They set up camp, enjoying a hearty meal prepared by the fire. The day's successful hunt and delicious dinner marked the beginning of their wilderness expedition.|"['1.

"John Barrow chuckled, ""Hunger makes everything taste better,"" as he watched the boys devour their food. He shared a story about finding old bread while hiking, emphasizing how delicious it had seemed at the time. The group settled in at Tillard's Pond, named after a man who had a fatal encounter with a bear. Following Tillard's demise, a successful bear hunt by the boys in the area had kept the bear population at bay. As night fell, the cold set in, making it challenging to move forward, but they eventually found shelter in a rocky alcove by the river. They built a fire, creating a cozy atmosphere inside. Despite the howling of a wolf in the distance, the night passed without any disturbances, and the boys woke up rejuvenated after a restful sleep."|"['1.

"The guide advised, ""No use lingering here; let's move on to a better spot."" The group continued their journey in heavy snowfall towards a narrow river. Climbing the rocky riverbanks was tough, especially for Sam. Tom and Sam, lagging behind, lost sight of the guide and Dick. They navigated through cedar brakes to find the icy stream. After struggling with a broken strap on the sled, they put on their skates. Yelling for the others yielded no response in the lonely, snow-covered landscape. Sam discovered they had followed a brook, not the Perch River. Climbing back in deeper snow was challenging, but they eventually found the trail after a rest under a cedar tree."|['1.

They chose to follow a trail leading northwest. It was tough work dragging the sled over rocks and through bushes, often pausing to catch their breath. The wolf stayed hidden, and Tom refrained from shooting, ready for its return. They proceeded cautiously, keeping watch on the surroundings. They heard the wolf's footsteps once but saw nothing more. When the wolf leaped, Tom struck it with his gun, causing it pain. The wolf managed to escape, wounded. Despite fatigue, they continued pulling the sled, unwilling to abandon their gear. The wind howled, snow fell from branches, but they pressed on. Eventually, they spotted their lost companions across a pond. They observed from a distance, overhearing a conversation. They decided to approach and join the others around a warm fire, relieved to reunite with their party.|"['1.

John Barrow agreed with the idea, and they quickly started a campfire by the riverbank. Dick ensured the fire burned brightly, illuminating the area. John had caught rabbits and birds on their way, which were hung on tree branches nearby. They made a cozy spot under the tree by laying down cedar branches and blocking the wind with more branches and snow. As they settled, thoughts of home, school, friends, and recent events flooded Dick's mind. Suddenly, a wildcat appeared near John, eyeing the game. Reacting swiftly, Dick shot at the wildcat, injuring it. Despite firing again, the wildcat charged at Dick, leading to a tense encounter between the youth and the fierce creature.|"['1.

In a moment of great danger, Dick found himself face to face with a wildcat. With a poor grip, he struggled to defend himself. John Barrow, quick on his feet, grabbed a burning brand from the fire and scared off the wildcat. As the beast retreated, Dick leaped away. With the path clear, John Barrow swiftly shot the wildcat dead. They found it was midnight and decided to rest. At dawn, they continued their journey towards Bear Pond, leaving a note for the missing Rovers. The sun shone brightly, making the snow sparkle. They fished and caught seven fish before proceeding up a narrow stream towards the pond. As they reached Bear Pond, they realized the search for treasure wouldn't be easy. The vast icy pond lay between two tall mountains, presenting a challenging quest ahead.|['1.

John Barrow excelled at broiling fish, and the meal he prepared for Dick was delicious. Despite worrying about his missing brothers, Dick enjoyed the sweet fish. After storing their supplies safely, they readied their firearms for a hunt. They soon set off to find Tom and Sam. Meanwhile, Tom and Sam were overpowered by Harney and Husty. Bound and left by a fire, they decided not to mention the sled they left behind to avoid alerting their captors. The group reached a rugged spot with a deep gorge and a cave. A fire was lit for warmth and light. Baxter's group quickly prepared a meal while Tom and Sam were securely tied to a tree.|"['1.

The Rovers fell silent, hungry but unable to escape. The Baxter party's cooking smells teased Tom and Sam's empty stomachs. Desperate to flee, they overheard Baxter's threats. As darkness fell, the group returned with their catch. Baxter warned the Rovers not to attempt escape. Sam and Tom found supplies and a shotgun, just as a black bear approached.

Tom and Sam were scared when the black bear moved towards them. They had hoped it would leave with the fox's carcass without noticing them. Sam shot the bear with the shotgun, causing painful but not life-threatening wounds. The bear roared in pain and anger. Tom handed Sam a firebrand as the shotgun was empty. The bear, forgetting the fox meat, focused on attacking the boys. With the fire burning low, the bear circled around them. The boys moved with the bear, trying to keep the fire between them. When Tom threw burning brushwood at the bear, it retreated in terror. The boys quickly left the area, worried about their enemies returning. They walked briskly through the cold woods, leaving no trail behind.|"['1.

He gestured forward towards where Dick and John Barrow had positioned their initial signal pole. Both hurried ahead and soon retrieved the cooked meat wrapped in cloth along with a note attached on the outside. They had brought their skates and swiftly put them on, making their journey easier. As darkness fell, they started worrying about reuniting with Dick and Mr. Barrow before nightfall. The shouting ceased, prompting Tom and Sam to stop and sit on a flat rock. After a while, they spotted Dick and John Barrow rushing into a clearing. As soon as Dick saw them, he waved enthusiastically. With the night approaching, the snowfall intensified, reducing visibility. The wind grew stronger, hindering their progress. The guide led them to a circle of cedars for shelter. After preparing a cozy resting place, they had a meager evening meal and settled down for the night.|"['1.

The storm showed no signs of stopping by noon, with snow falling fast and covering the landscape. The group sought shelter and listened to stories from John Barrow, the guide, including tales about the missing treasure and Goupert. As they set out towards the river, they heard cries for help growing fainter. They found Jasper Grinder, the former teacher from Putnam Hall, injured and weak. After providing him with food and warmth, Jasper shared his harrowing experience of being lost in the woods, facing extreme cold and a close encounter with a bear.

"""He followed me to the river, but I ran through the snow until he gave up. I saw your campfire and cried for help. I slipped on a rock, hit my cheek, and felt dizzy from the blood loss. Then, suddenly, I woke up here,"" explained Jasper Grinder, looking humbled. Exhausted, he fell asleep, and the group debated taking him along. Tom expressed concerns about Jasper's intentions, fearing he might try to steal any treasure they find. After much discussion, they decided to let Jasper join but warned him to behave. The next day, despite the cold, they set out up the river. Jasper insisted on coming, not wanting to be left behind.

By midday, John Barrow estimated they had traveled half the way to Bear Pond. They found a cozy spot among rocks and trees to rest and eat their remaining food by a crackling fire. The sun shone brightly, making the snowy surface sparkle like diamonds. As they continued, Sam and Jasper Grinder grew weary, slowing their pace. They had to navigate around a bend in the stream to avoid deep snowdrifts. Passing a marker, they headed towards their stash. Suddenly, two bears approached after being wounded by gunshots. In a tense moment, the bears attacked Tom, but Dick swiftly shot one in the ear, ending the threat.

Late in the evening, after a tiring walk in the deep snow, they needed a shelter for the night. The guide found a spot with many cedars, cleaned it up, and made it cozy. They moved the fire to this new spot, and John Barrow cut up a bear for a delicious steak dinner. They hung the meat on a tree to keep it safe from wild animals. The peaceful night was only interrupted by the crackling fire. In the morning, John Barrow cooked breakfast while discussing a hidden treasure clue. They found Sam stuck in snow, but he managed to get out. Tom, with his arm injured, joined them for breakfast. They were unsure how to handle Jasper Grinder, worried he might betray them.

Thirty minutes later, the boys and their guide embarked on their initial search for the treasure. John Barrow cautiously led the way, navigating rocky terrain with a long pole to check for hollow areas. They reached the spot where Dick suspected the treasure might be hidden. After clearing the snow, they found no tree stump but discovered a small hollow with large roots. The guide speculated that the landscape had likely changed over the years. Following the compass, they continued their journey, overcoming obstacles like rough rocks and deep snow. Their path led them to Bear Pond, where they hunted rabbits skillfully. Despite his doubts, the protagonist realized that the Rovers had saved him from a perilous situation in the wilderness, making him appreciate their company.|['1.

Jasper Grinder, a former teacher, found himself in a terrifying predicament. Surrounded by a pack of hungry wolves, he scrambled up a tree for safety, leaving his gun behind in his haste. The wolves, drawn by the scent of bear meat, circled the tree, their howls echoing through the forest. Desperate and alone, Jasper tried to retrieve his gun using a string, but the wolves attacked, causing the gun to accidentally discharge. Jasper was injured, shot by his own weapon.
