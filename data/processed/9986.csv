Elma remained silent, feeling cold and stunned. She didn't care much about her surroundings. Suddenly, a loud slam made both girls rush to the window. Mrs. Steward was leaving, her long train trailing behind her. Mrs. Lewis burst into the room, expressing shock at the news. Elma was to be publicly shamed at Middleton School the next day. Mrs. Lewis was bewildered by the accusations but feared the consequences. Elma felt forsaken and contemplated running away with her money. She couldn't face the humiliation at school.

Elma strolled down the road, yearning to escape the presence of Middleton girls. She quickened her pace until she reached a small station, unsure of her destination. Without luggage, she hesitated, fearing suspicion of running away. Despite Middleton School's badge on her hat, she risked taking a train to Saltbury, a coastal town. Sitting in a third-class compartment, she found solace in the company of a kind woman en route to Middleton. Upon reaching Saltbury, Elma contemplated visiting a familiar cottage but decided against it to avoid being traced. Opting for a room in a bustling part of town, she settled in a cozy house for the night.

After finishing her small meal, she ventured back onto South Street. Her heart sank when she saw the name at one end of the street. She dreaded passing by that cozy little house with the snug bedroom where she sought solace from her troubles. As she neared the shore, the tide was high, covering the vast beach. The children had gone home, and the stars twinkled in the sky while the full moon shone brightly. Despite the beautiful night, the sea's mournful sounds unnerved Elma. She decided to head inland, with time to spare before her morning train. Exhausted, she found refuge in a field, feeling utterly alone.

After a while, feeling extremely tired and worn out, she lay on the wet grass and fell asleep. When she woke in the middle of the night, she felt a bitter cold she had never experienced before. She was scared, remembering she was a runaway with stolen money. In her fear, she felt like the world was empty, and even the stars seemed to judge her. Suddenly, she saw a brown cow staring at her. Not being familiar with country creatures, she panicked and ran away. As the night passed, her fears eased with the rising sun. She waited anxiously for Carrie, who had promised to help her.
