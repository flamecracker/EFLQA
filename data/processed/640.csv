The Hunter expressed gratitude to the wise woman and pondered the promises she made. Walking a short distance, he witnessed a flock of birds fighting over a cloth as she foretold. Taking aim with his gun, he shot into the midst of them, causing chaos. Amidst the chaos, one bird fell dead, dropping the coveted cloak. Following the old woman's instructions, he retrieved the bird's heart from the dead bird, consumed it, and took the cloak home. Awakening the next day, he discovered a gold piece under his pillow, a fulfillment of the promise. Accumulating gold, he eventually decided to explore the world. During his travels, he encountered a castle where an old witch and a beautiful maiden resided. The witch, aware of the Hunter's bird-heart treasure, plotted to obtain it. The maiden, under the witch's influence, tricked the Hunter into revealing the bird-heart. The Hunter's gold fortune shifted to the maiden, and he became enchanted by her. The witch, desiring the cloak, manipulated events to her advantage. Ultimately, the maiden and the Hunter journeyed to a granite mountain to collect precious stones.

After a long day of searching, Prince Saphir felt an overwhelming thirst. Luckily, he found a bubbling fountain with clear water. As he tried to drink, a pretty green frog hopped into his cup. Initially annoyed, Saphir was surprised when the frog revealed itself as a friend of the bird he sought. The frog instructed him to follow a road lined with cedars to a castle, where a grain of sand would open the gate and put everyone to sleep. Following the frog's guidance, Saphir successfully entered the castle, but a mishap in the stable led to his capture.

Iwanich faced a dilemma when asked about his adventure. To keep the truth hidden, he fabricated a tale about a giant wasp buzzing around him until dawn. The King, believing the story, urged his son to rest while ordering feasts to celebrate. The next day, the Prince embarked on a journey through a vast, unexplored forest. A ragged man warned him of dangerous creatures lurking within. Despite the risks, the Prince, armed with a bag of breadcrumbs and a hare, ventured into the forest.

In a mysterious forest, Prince Iwanich found himself alone after a little creature fled, leaving him with a sparkling ring. As he journeyed, he encountered a peculiar man with lions tied to his beard. The man offered a lion as a protector until they reached a palace outside his domain. With the lion by his side, Iwanich continued through the forest, wolves and wild beasts keeping their distance. Eventually, he reached a plain visible through the trees. At the forest's exit, the lion departed, and Iwanich met Princess Militza. After sharing his adventures, they dined luxuriously. The Princess introduced Iwanich as her future husband to her court. She handed him the keys to the castle, cautioning him not to open the iron door in the north tower. Despite her warning, curiosity led Iwanich to unlock the door, revealing a horrific scene. The palace collapsed, and Iwanich found himself alone on a desolate heath. As he wandered in despair, he stumbled upon a beggar's hut, seeking shelter for the night.

Once upon a time, a brave Prince embarked on a journey and stumbled upon a dark and eerie house surrounded by a fence adorned with skulls. Inside, he met a hideous old witch who offered him a job tending to two pitch-black horses. The Prince's task was simple - to lead the horses to graze daily without letting them escape. If successful for a year, he could ask for anything. If he failed, his fate would be the same as the skulls on the fence. Despite challenges, the Prince managed the horses well until one day they escaped due to the witch's trickery. Remembering the gifts from a fish, an eagle, and a fox, the Prince sought their help.

Not long after, a loud hissing sound filled the air, waves crashed against the banks, foam scattered, and the two horses bounded onto dry land, trembling in fear. The witch, seeing the Prince return with the horses, barely masked her anger. She fed the Prince and then went to the stables to scold the horses for not hiding well. She ordered them to hide in the clouds the next morning until she called, threatening to beat them if they disobeyed. The following day, after leading the horses to the fields, Iwanich fell into a deep sleep. The horses fled and concealed themselves in the clouds hanging from the mountains. The witch, displeased, instructed the horses to hide in the royal henhouse the next day, promising punishment if they failed. When the horses vanished, the Prince sought help from a fox. He burned two hairs, summoning the fox, who proposed a plan to retrieve the horses from the henhouse. As the Prince rode joyfully, the mare offered him a reward for outsmarting the witch and advised him to take her foal, a unique and valuable creature. Despite the witch's attempts to dissuade him, the Prince insisted on the foal. Later, the witch revealed the foal's special abilities to the Prince. At dusk, figures appeared in the distance, revealing the magician and his companions flying in a carriage drawn by owls.|"['1.

The Prince stayed with the Giant for some time until the Giant decided to take him to the mainland as he was nearing the end of his life.

One evening, as she lay in her cozy bed, a wrinkled toad sneaked in through a broken window pane. The toad's son was just as ugly and clammy. They planned to marry Thumbelina to the son and live in a marsh chamber. But the fish in the stream didn't want Thumbelina to live with the toad.

Once upon a time, there was a tiny creature named Thumbelina who lived in the woods. She was abandoned by a cockchafer who thought she was ugly. Left alone, Thumbelina survived by crafting a grass bed under a clover-leaf and feeding on flower honey and dew. As winter approached, she struggled to stay warm and find food. Desperate and freezing, she stumbled upon a field-mouse's cozy home, where she met a blind mole. The field-mouse suggested Thumbelina marry the mole for security. Despite the mole's caution, they explored a tunnel and found a dead swallow. Thumbelina mourned the bird, showing her kind heart. Though facing challenges, Thumbelina's resilience and compassion shone through in the face of adversity.|"['1.

"""Yes, you speak sensibly,"" the field-mouse remarked. ""What does a bird have in winter despite its singing? It must starve and freeze, quite unpleasant, I must say!"" Thumbelina, silent before, bent down to the bird after they left. She brushed his feathers and gently kissed his eyes. ""Perhaps he sang to me in summer,"" she thought. Moved by the bird's plight, she covered him with warmth. The next night, she found him alive but weak, having nursed him back to health. When spring arrived, the bird offered to take her away.

Thumbelina spent her days spinning and dreading her upcoming wedding to the mole. She longed to see her beloved swallow again as the days passed. When the wedding day arrived, she was filled with sadness, knowing she would be taken underground by the mole. But just then, the swallow appeared, offering her a way out. Thumbelina gladly accepted the swallow's invitation to fly away to warmer lands, leaving behind the dark underground life with the mole. Together, they soared over mountains and seas, finally arriving in a beautiful place with abundant sunshine, fruits, and flowers.

Once upon a time, a swallow carried Thumbelina to a magical garden where she met a tiny man, the King of the flowers. He was enchanted by Thumbelina's beauty and asked her to be his wife. With joy, Thumbelina accepted, becoming Queen of all the flowers. Each blossom in the garden held a tiny man or woman who brought her gifts. The best present was a pair of delicate wings that allowed Thumbelina to fly from flower to flower. As the flowers celebrated, the swallow, who had grown fond of Thumbelina, sadly sang the wedding march before flying back to his nest in Denmark. The Emperor's Palace in China, made of fragile porcelain, housed a garden with silver-bell flowers and a forest where a Nightingale sang so beautifully that even the busiest fisherman paused to listen.|"['1.

Travellers from different lands visited the Emperor's town, marveling at the Palace and garden, but it was the Nightingale's song that captivated them the most. Scholars wrote volumes about the town, but the Nightingale remained the star. Poets penned verses about the Nightingale in the forest by the sea. When the Emperor read about the Nightingale in a book from Japan, he was intrigued. Determined to hear the Nightingale, he threatened to trample his Court if it didn't appear. After a search, a kitchenmaid who knew the Nightingale was found. The Palace was adorned for the Nightingale's performance, with the bird perched in the great hall.

The Nightingale sang beautifully, bringing tears to the Emperor's eyes. The Emperor was so moved that he offered the Nightingale his gold slipper as a reward, but the Nightingale declined, finding the Emperor's tears to be reward enough. The court was captivated by the Nightingale's song, but soon an artificial bird, adorned with jewels, was introduced. This mechanical bird sang just like the Nightingale but with added sparkle. The court was enamored with the artificial bird's beauty and precision. However, when the real Nightingale flew away, the court realized the true value of its natural song.

Once upon a time, there was an Emperor who cherished an artificial bird that sang with beautiful melodies. The bird's song was adored by all in the kingdom, and they even sang along with it. However, one fateful evening, while the Emperor lay in bed listening to the bird's enchanting tune, a sudden crack echoed through the room. The bird had stopped singing, and despite efforts from the physician and clockmaker, it could not be fixed. The Emperor was heartbroken, and the kingdom fell into sorrow as news spread of the Emperor's illness. The halls were silent, and the Emperor longed for music to break the stillness. But alas, the bird remained silent, unable to sing without being wound up.

Enraged, the Queen cursed Hermod to become a lion by day and a man by night until his true love, Hadvor, burned the lion's skin. In return, Hermod cursed the Queen and her daughter.

The King and Queen went to see the body of a beautiful youth, considering him a suitable match for Hadvor. The Queen decided Hadvor's punishment should be to be buried in a mound next to her brother. Olof advised Hadvor to wear a wide cloak in the mound to escape the Giant's ghost. The Giant turned into his true form, asking Hadvor to cut pieces from his legs for his dogs. Hadvor refused until he revealed Hermod's location on a desert island. She made shoes from the Giant's skin and escaped the mound. Hadvor crossed the sea to the island where Hermod was. She fell asleep and dreamt of a woman guiding her to Hermod with a rope, a clew, and a belt. Hadvor found Hermod in a cave and burned the lion's skin outside.

Once there was a needle who thought she was as delicate as an embroidery needle. She warned the fingers that held her to be careful, fearing she might break if dropped.
