This is one of the few little books that Ballantyne wrote for young kids. Many were penned under the name Comus, but this one came out under his real name in 1874. It was crafted for very young children and centered around insects and small mammals gathering for a feast. They set aside their differences for a day of fun, with a few mishaps during the dancing. The blind Black Beetle carried his friend the Emmet, while the Gnat and Dragonfly arrived in colorful attire. The insects gathered under an oak tree for the Butterfly's ball and the Grasshopper's feast, with all creatures eager to join the festivities. The old Beetle, even after being injured, hobbled along to partake in the joyous occasion.|"['1.

Once upon a time, the Moth, adorned in soft down, felt left behind as she saw the Wasp and the Hornet pass by in their fancy brown and yellow outfits.

They whisked her away, dancing and singing, much to the amusement of other insects like the Caterpillar and Long-legged Beetle.

As the sun set and evening turned to night, the Glow-worm emerged, casting its gentle light. It was time to head home before darkness fell completely.
