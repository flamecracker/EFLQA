Sara walked up two more flights of stairs and entered the attic room, closing the door behind her. The room had a slanting roof and was whitewashed, with a rusty grate, an iron bedstead, and worn-out furniture from better rooms. Under the skylight was a battered red footstool. Sara sat on it with her doll, Emily, across her knees. She was different from other children, rarely crying. She sat in silence, her black head resting on Emily. Her life changed that day.

That night, while passing by, Sara saw the Lascar closing the shutters and glimpsed inside the room. A cozy fire burned in the grate, and the Indian Gentleman sat looking lonely in a luxurious chair.
