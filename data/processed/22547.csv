Mr. Rover was concerned upon hearing that Merrick had joined forces with a tramp vessel captain for a treasure hunt. His worry deepened when Dick revealed that letters, including one from Mrs. Stanhope about the hunt, had been stolen. Determined to outsmart Merrick, the group headed to Philadelphia to prepare the steam yacht for the journey. They were greeted by Captain Barforth, a friendly man who made them feel welcome. The yacht had spacious staterooms, each elegantly decorated in white and gold. The boys were fascinated by the modern engine that could reach impressive speeds. Excited to set sail, they eagerly awaited the arrival of their friends Fred and Hans, who brought comical tales of luggage mishaps. The group looked forward to the adventure ahead and the delicious desserts served on board.|"[""1.

The boys were proud to have the Stanhopes and the Lanings aboard the _Rainbow_. Although they didn't own the yacht, having it under charter was a special treat. Mr. Rover warmly welcomed the newcomers as they arrived. Dora was delighted by the luxurious stateroom with roses, attributing it to Dick's thoughtfulness. The Lanings were equally impressed by their stateroom with carnations, a gift from Tom and Sam. The group planned an exciting afternoon automobile tour after spending the morning exploring the yacht.

"Hans stood up and surveyed the scene. ""Well, I never! Looks like we've got a colorful snowstorm already, huh?"" This remark sparked laughter among the group. Indeed, it did resemble a ""colored snowstorm,"" with confetti scattered everywhere - on tables, heads, and clothing. The amusement spread, even Mrs. Stanhope joining in the laughter. Aleck's laughter was so loud it echoed up the docks. After cleaning up the confetti, they enjoyed lunch with jokes and lively banter. Songbird, waking up, shared verses he had composed the night before, celebrating freedom and festivities. As Tom praised Hans for his poetry, the group erupted in laughter.

Dick and Tom were out for a fun ride in the country, leaving behind the noisy city. As they raced along in their cars, a firecracker was thrown by a rough person, causing a commotion. Despite the chaos, Dick managed to outpace Tom, enjoying the thrill of the speed. Along the way, they stopped at a hotel for ice cream treats. However, Dick noticed the chauffeurs drinking heavily and causing trouble. Determined to keep the trip safe, Dick took control of the car and sped off, leaving the chaotic scene behind.

There was no time for more words as the car bounced over the stones erratically. Alarmed, Dick, who had already turned off the engine, tried to brake, but he wasn't familiar with it and jammed it, causing the car to keep moving. As they approached a dangerous turn with a farmer's wagon on the narrow road, a quick decision was needed. Dick skillfully steered the car into the bushes, narrowly avoiding a collision.

Dick assured Mr. Rover that the machines were unharmed. However, he firmly stated that they wouldn't pay for the chauffeurs. Mr. Rover then instructed Hans to light a Roman candle for entertainment. Despite warnings to be cautious, Hans's excitement led to chaos. The Roman candle misfired, causing balls of fire to hit the yacht. A curtain caught fire, endangering everyone. Aleck Pop shared a past experience with fireworks going awry, emphasizing the danger. Captain Barforth recounted a similar incident at a yacht club. Fortunately, they managed to avert disaster this time. The group realized the seriousness of the situation and acted swiftly to prevent further harm.|"['1.

Early the next morning, Bahama Bill arrived. The boys recognized him from the descriptions they had been given, but it was a challenge not to smile when they saw him. Bahama Bill was a stout man with bowed legs, long reddish hair, a thick beard, and a squint in one eye that made it seem like he was always looking over his shoulder. His voice alternated between a squeak and a rumble when he spoke. Dick described him as a character full of sea stories. Bahama Bill greeted everyone warmly and shared tales of his adventures at sea. The steam yacht was ready to depart, and as they sailed down the Delaware River, the passengers enjoyed the sights. The day was beautiful, and the breeze was refreshing. The vessel headed south into the Atlantic Ocean as the _Rainbow_ began to sway with the waves. Fred fell seasick, while the others coped with the rolling ocean, enjoying the experience.|['1.

Bahama Bill shared a tale with Tom about a voyage to Rio where even the experienced captain and mate fell seasick. The ship sailed itself for weeks due to a series of illnesses among the crew. Tom cleverly steered the conversation away, leaving Bahama Bill in awe. Meanwhile, the group explored the elegant steam yacht, Rainbow, under Captain Barforth's warm welcome. However, they found the first mate, Asa Carey, unfriendly and the assistant engineer, Bill Bossermann, unpleasant. The boys were puzzled by their presence on a pleasure craft. As they played catch on deck, unaware of the first mate's watchful eyes, tensions simmered on board the ship.|"['1.

"""I'll take care,"" replied Rover, the cheerful boy, as he tossed the baseball high into the air. Suddenly, the steam yacht lurched, causing the ball to strike the mainmast and then bounce directly onto Asa Carey's head, sending him stumbling backward with his cap over his eyes. Tom stepped forward, asserting, ""We didn't mean to hit you. We're just playing catch. We rented this yacht and have the right to enjoy ourselves as long as we don't disrupt the ship's operation. Please return our ball."" Asa Carey, the mate, suspiciously retorted, ""Trying to hide behind the captain?""

The old sailor aboard the _Rainbow_ was about to speak when a loud cry from the bow interrupted him. Suddenly, the ship quivered and two crashes threw the old sailor and the boys to the deck. The captain and Mr. Rover rushed below to assess the damage, while the crew prepared life preservers. Asa Carey took charge, ordering small boats ready in case of emergency. Luckily, the captain assured the passengers that the ship could reach a nearby port for repairs. They decided on Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, for the repairs.

On the edge of town lay a lovely flower garden where exquisite roses bloomed. One day, girls and ladies visited while Dick and Songbird joined. Meanwhile, Tom and Sam checked on repairs to the _Rainbow_ at the docks. They saw ships coming and going, learning passengers had disembarked earlier. Some were at the dock handling delayed baggage. Peter Slade, a former Putnam Hall student, was once a bit of a bully but left after a prank. Tom urged him to share info on Sid Merrick. Mr. Rover, back from the flower garden visit, was eager to hunt for Merrick and the _Josephine_. The next day, news of a tramp steamer leaving with passengers alarmed them. The _Rainbow_ would be ready to sail soon, despite wet paint. A fireman named Walt Wingate joined as a deck hand, whistling tunes and making friends. By five o'clock, the _Rainbow_ set sail from Nassau, heading south around Cuba. Captain Barforth and Bahama Bill were consulted on the journey to Treasure Isle.|"['1.

"While one of the discussions was happening, Dick, who was on board, hurriedly went below deck. Passing through the passage, he met Walt Wingate, who had been eavesdropping at the cabin entrance. ""I guess it's fine,"" replied Dick, but he felt uneasy, without knowing why. There was something off about the new deckhand that didn't seem genuine. Initially, he thought of telling his father about it, but then decided against troubling him. Captain Barforth realized the urgency in the race between the _Rainbow_ and the _Josephine_ for Treasure Isle and increased the steam. The yacht's route was mapped out but intricate due to the numerous keys in the area. The captain emphasized the need to avoid hidden reefs to prevent accidents or lengthy repairs. Sam, unable to sleep, went on deck for fresh air and noticed Walt Wingate leaning over the rail, dropping something into the sea. Wingate's actions puzzled Sam, who refrained from mentioning it to Asa Carey, the mate. Captain Carey, curious about Sam's late-night presence, investigated and discovered an anchor attached to a wire that Wingate had disposed of into the sea."|"['1.

A search was organized with all the boys, Mr. Rover, and Aleck joining in. Despite a thorough search of the steam yacht from front to back, the missing deck hand, Wingate, was nowhere to be found. Even the hold was thoroughly checked, but with no luck. To motivate the crew, the captain offered a reward of ten dollars to whoever found Wingate. Unfortunately, this did not yield any results. The steam yacht, now rid of drags, picked up speed. The machinery was inspected, and some wire was found twisted around the propeller, but it was removed without causing damage. Concerned about Wingate's mysterious absence, the ladies and girls locked their stateroom doors at night. The boys and Mr. Rover stayed vigilant, even keeping loaded pistols nearby. Bahama Bill shared a story to pass the time, reminiscing about a circus orangutan's disappearance on a ship years ago. As they neared Treasure Isle, the crew wondered about the whereabouts of the _Josephine_, speculating if the tramp steamer had taken a different route.|"['1.

"Twenty-four hours later, the fog lifted, and Captain Barforth revealed they had reached the area where Treasure Isle was believed to be. The boys spread out on the steam yacht, while Dick and Tom used marine glasses from atop the ship. ""Come up and take a look through these,"" Dick invited Bahama Bill, who gladly accepted. Hours passed as they circled the island. The steam yacht changed course towards the land they had spotted, gradually revealing a beautiful tropical isle with palm trees lining the shore. Deciding it was unsafe to land on the north side due to rough seas, they navigated to the south side. The island, shaped like a horseshoe, posed challenges with its treacherous reef.

The boys landed on a picturesque spot on Treasure Isle, surrounded by tall palms, trailing vines, and beautiful flowers. Eager to find the cave, they trudged along the horseshoe curve, encountering muddy flats and thorny bushes. As darkness fell rapidly, they found a trail and followed it for a quarter of a mile, made by natives. Hiding in the bushes, they overheard a party led by Sid Merrick and Tad Sobber approaching with lamps. The boys listened as the men discussed their plans to head off an unknown group outside the reef. The Rover boys realized they were in a race against time to reach their destination.|['1.

Moving cautiously through the dark forest, the Rovers trailed behind the armed party from the _Josephine_. The boys, armed with only a single pistol, knew they were outnumbered and outgunned. Despite the odds, they pressed on, keeping a safe distance of about a hundred feet. As they crept along, they overheard the others discussing the treasure and their plans to uncover it. Determined to thwart their rivals, the Rovers devised a plan to hold them off until morning when they could signal for help from the _Rainbow_. With the enemy party ahead, the Rovers prepared to confront them, ready to defend their claim to the treasure. Setting up a makeshift camp for the night, they took turns keeping watch, unsure of what the next day would bring.|"['1.

Dick was the first to take his turn on guard duty. During the initial hour of his watch, he heard the nightbirds' cries and the sound of the surf crashing on the reefs and the shore of the island. He also observed fireflies flitting around. Dick found some wild fruit nearby but it tasted bitter, so he hesitated to eat much. To stay awake, he started carving his initials on a palm tree. Suddenly, he was attacked from behind by Merrick and Shelley, with Cuffer standing by. They tied up Dick, Tom, and Sam, leaving them alone in the forest. The boys struggled to free themselves but were unsuccessful. As morning approached, they tried to call for help, hoping someone would hear them.|"[""1.

"""We'll take the chance,"" stated Tom, initiating a loud cry that everyone echoed. They patiently awaited a response, but there was complete silence for several minutes. Suddenly, a pistol shot broke the quiet. After the Rover boys left the steam yacht, Mr. Rover and Captain Barforth decided to begin the search for the treasure cave at daybreak. ""The isle has changed since I was last here,"" mentioned the Captain. ""But I can find it once I locate the trail leading that way. Trails are crucial. Once, on the _Jessie D._, we followed a trail to a volcano. We descended a thousand feet into the volcano, a hair-raising experience.

After being questioned, Walt Wingate revealed everything he knew about Merrick and his intentions. Despite his humble demeanor and insistence that he only wanted to put Bahama Bill to sleep, Captain Barforth deemed him dangerous and placed him under arrest. Wingate was handcuffed and locked in a storeroom, much to his dismay, but he was relieved to avoid a worse punishment. Curious about the whereabouts of the _Josephine_, some aboard the _Rainbow_ tried to spot the ship from a mast but were obstructed by a hill. As they prepared to investigate the strange light on Treasure Isle, the group armed themselves and brought tools and provisions. Led by Bahama Bill and Mr. Rover, they embarked on their journey, encountering unexpected obstacles along the way.|"[""1.

There was nothing to do but backtrack, and they managed to retrace about half the distance. Suddenly, a beam of light pierced the treetops nearby. They followed it, only to get lost in the jungle. A lantern was accidentally broken, reducing their light. Anderson Rover suggested returning to find his sons, and everyone agreed. The boys were eventually found tied up. Mr. Rover realized the seriousness of the situation. The path led westward, through rough terrain with dense vines and spider webs. As they reached a swamp, they split up to search. Progress was slow and challenging, with water, brushwood, and scratches. Bahama Bill predicted a storm, recalling a hurricane in Cuba. The adventurers pressed on, knowing a challenging journey lay ahead.|['1.

The news that they were close to the treasure cave boosted the group's spirits, despite the heavy rain. They followed Bahama Bill eagerly, aiming to be the first to see the sought-after spot. The old sailor explained that an earthquake had caused the cave's collapse, leaving a pile of massive rocks blocking the entrance. Anderson Rover and his sons realized that reaching the treasure would be a monumental task, possibly taking weeks or months. After seeking shelter from the rain, they assessed the situation. Bahama Bill believed the treasure lay buried beneath them, but the depth was uncertain. They planned to carefully remove rocks and potentially use dynamite to clear the way. Mr. Rover suggested finding a direct path to the bay for easier access to their steam yacht. Despite the challenges, the group remained determined to uncover the treasure.|"[""1.

Captain Barforth mentioned that he had a sufficient amount of powder on the ship for cannon salutes and signals. However, if they required dynamite, he would need to go to one of the larger islands to get it. The next day, Mr. Rover and Captain Barforth, accompanied by Dick, Tom, and Sam, went ashore, leaving Asa Carey in charge of the steam yacht. The mate was instructed to stay near the reef's mouth and send armed crew members ashore if a distress signal was given. They landed near a path leading to a sunken cave, equipped with tools for digging, a rock drill, and some powder. Mr. Rover suggested blasting some rocks to explore the cave entrance. Dora overheard a conversation about Walt Wingate's plan to thwart Mr. Rover's treasure hunt, involving the mate and assistant engineer. Songbird took a small boat to find Mr. Rover and Captain Barforth, hearing a gunshot while approaching the shore where the Rover boys were.|"['1.

"""That would be both mutiny and robbery,"" the captain replied firmly. ""I ordered Carey to keep the ship where she was, unless a heavy blow was imminent—then he was to stay back until the danger passed."" ""Do you know what I think?"" Dick interjected. ""I believe he plans to sail around to the other side of the island. He might be looking to consult with Sid Merrick. If Merrick's proposal suits him, he'll likely try to stop us from reaching the treasure."" Hans noticed Walt Wingate conversing with the mate on the deck. The deck hand was no longer restrained, a change from earlier when he was handcuffed on Captain Barforth's orders. Fred, sensing trouble, fired a shotgun as a signal, alerting Songbird. Carey approached Fred, but Fred stood his ground. After a confrontation, Fred signaled the captain's return. As the ship neared another point of the island, the boys spotted a steamer in the distance, likely the _Josephine_. The two vessels drew close, and Walt Wingate communicated with the other ship via a megaphone, but the boys couldn't discern the exchange."|"[""1.

Norton agreed silently, and the mate glanced at Fred, considering saying more but decided against it and left quickly. Shortly after, a small boat was lowered into the water, manned by the mate, Bossermann, Wingate, and a sailor named Ulligan, known for his laziness and untrustworthiness. The small boat immediately headed towards the _Josephine_. As the _Rainbow_ sailed away from Horseshoe Bay, the Rovers and their companions on shore sensed a critical moment. If Carey, Bossermann, and Wingate were planning to join Sid Merrick, the situation could worsen. Dick proposed a plan to climb the hill behind the treasure cave and ascend the tallest tree to gain a vantage point. The group quickly set off, following the path to the cave and ascending the hill. Using a spyglass, they observed the steam yacht's movements and alerted the others below. The _Rainbow_ approached the other vessel, and when the rowboats neared, a display of fireworks from the _Rainbow_ startled the enemy, causing them to retreat back to the _Josephine_.|"['1.

"""It's a race between the _Rainbow_ and the other ship,"" Mr. Rover noted. Both vessels sped out to sea, hidden by the haze. ""Sid Merrick must be on the _Josephine_,"" Dick remarked, easing their worries about their treasure hunt. Returning to the cave, they carefully planned their next move to avoid wasting energy. As they worked, they uncovered chests filled with gold, jewelry, and precious stones. Despite the danger, they unearthed more treasure. Exhausted but elated, they found over a hundred thousand dollars' worth of riches.

Night had fallen over Treasure Isle when the shore was finally reached with the treasure. Men and boys were exhausted and decided to rest under the trees before burying the treasure again. They planned to signal their steam yacht to come ashore to collect the treasure. Despite concerns that the yacht might be in enemy hands, two rockets were fired, signaling that it was safe. The crew on the yacht saw the signal and sent a rowboat to land. The crew shared their adventure of being chased by enemies and how they managed to outmaneuver them. The treasure was quickly loaded onto rowboats and taken to the steam yacht.

The crew later heard that the _Josephine_ tried to find them the next day but returned to the island. They dug for treasure but found nothing. A fight broke out, and three men were hurt.
