"Chapter I: The Mystery of the Black Night

Two young men found themselves on a narrow ledge of rock protruding from the water. This stone ledge marked the initial outer wall of a massive breakwater construction project. During high tide, the ledge sat a mere fourteen inches above the Gulf of Mexico's surface, and at the time of their conversation, they were just twenty minutes away from high tide. The top of this stone wall was a narrow thirty inches wide, providing a precarious path for the youths who, on a dark night, were over half a mile from the shore.

On a calm night, with a young man of steady nerves, walking along the top of this breakwater wall wouldn't be too challenging. In the daylight, hundreds of workers and masons could be seen laboring on it, either side by side or on boats and barges nearby."|['1.

"Tom and Harry, now engineers overseeing a significant breakwater project on the Alabama gulf coast, were first introduced in the ""_Grammar School Boys Series_."" They were part of the renowned American schoolboys' group, Dick & Co. In their previous school days, Dick Prescott led the group, but Greg Holmes, Dave Darrin, Dan Dalzell, Tom, and Harry were also key members. After their school adventures, they continued their journey through the ""_High School Boys Series_,"" where their athletic and non-athletic exploits were vividly portrayed. Following high school, Dick and Greg went to West Point, while Dave and Dan went to Annapolis. Tom and Harry, however, pursued careers in civil engineering. They trained hard during high school, gaining experience in an engineering firm in Gridley. Subsequently, they worked on a railway project in Colorado, facing challenges and adventures that led Tom to become the project lead and Harry the first assistant engineer.

Tom Reade was the captain of a unique crew, with Harry as his lieutenant. The laborers, totaling seven hundred, included four hundred African Americans, two hundred Italians, and about a hundred Portuguese. Among them were skilled masons and unskilled workers. The camp had six American foremen, an American superintendent, some more Americans, and a few Scots as engineers. A recent pay-day had attracted gamblers to the camp, reminiscent of past troubles. Despite warnings, some workers were unhappy about the gambling situation. One night, Tom and Harry decided to check the shorefront and heard an explosion, suspecting sabotage. They encountered a swimmer, a huge African American, possibly involved in the incident. Tom and Harry discussed the challenges of maintaining order in the camp and the pressure from the company to allow gambling for the workers' satisfaction.|"['1.

"""We're going to put a stop to the gambling, and make sure it stays stopped,"" Tom declared firmly. ""But, Harry, we're going to face some resistance, and there will be attempts to damage the company's property.""

""We won't back down, and we won't submit to any cheaters, Harry!"" exclaimed Tom. ""Someone is challenging us, and this damaged sea-wall is just the beginning. Well, if someone wants a fight, they'll see that we can fight back and fight hard. Harry, we're going after those criminals starting now, and we'll show them that we mean business!""

""Let me think,"" Reade suggested. ""I've got it. We'll send a motor boat with a foreman and four workers armed with clubs to patrol the water on both sides of the wall. The 'Thomas Morton' has a searchlight that can help keep watch over the wall.""

""Every night from now on, we'll have a night patrol out,"" Tom announced. ""I'm not convinced that there won't be another attempt tonight if we don't act. Harry, can you stay here while I go get the boat ready?""

Tom had planned to leave the flashlight with his friend, but he forgot and kept it with him as he jogged along the wall, shining the light ahead.

Harry should have paid more attention to the shore end of the wall. If he had, he might have spotted the large man sneaking towards him. The man moved cautiously, lifting his head occasionally to listen. He sniffed the air like a dog, trying to detect any signs of danger from Harry. Suddenly, Harry's sharp senses picked up a sound nearby. He turned quickly, ready to defend himself with a rock in hand. As he approached the man, he demanded to know who he was and what he was doing there. Despite Harry's warnings, the man remained silent. Harry threatened to throw the rock at him if he didn't speak up. However, Harry had no intention of actually harming the man. He was just trying to protect himself.

"After sunrise, I spotted a small boat approaching me. It seemed like it was not going to pass by without noticing me. I signaled with my handkerchief since I had lost my hat. The captain of the boat noticed me and steered towards me. The boat was on its way to Hetherton, a village without a railway connection. The captain pulled me onto the boat, interrogated me, appeared skeptical of my story, and then let me rest in the cabin. He nursed me as best as he could. Upon reaching Hetherton around noon, a doctor treated my injuries. I had a meal, bought a new hat, and hired a driver to take me ten miles to the railway.

Lieutenant Dick had a clear idea of Bascomb, describing him as a bit naive. He suggested involving Bascomb in investigating the suspicious ship targeting them. Prescott, thinking like a military officer, recommended using their motorboat to approach the suspicious craft cautiously. With a police officer present, they could legally inspect the vessel. Prescott advised discreetly monitoring the ship without alerting its crew. The group, led by the officer, boarded the suspect ship. They found a homemade torpedo, potentially loaded with explosives.
