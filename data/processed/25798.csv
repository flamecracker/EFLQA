"**CHAPTER I: A Package Vanishes**

""We surely are!"" assured Jimmie. ""I'll bet I can tell you what that is! The Belgians cut their dikes and flooded the country to drive out the Germans. My dream book says that's it!""

A general laugh greeted this assertion. Moving about in the limits of a European railway carriage, four Boy Scouts of America in khaki uniforms observed the flooded scenery.

Ned Nestor, the Wolf Patrol Leader from New York City, and his companions had recently been on a dangerous manhunt through France and Belgium. Their coolness and judgment had seen them through many difficulties.

Jimmie McGraw, Jack Bosworth, and Harry Stevens, all around eighteen, were part of the group.

Jimmie suggested changing the topic to spare his friend's feelings. He noticed some land and wondered if they were nearing the border. An army of soldiers awaited the train, checking everyone trying to cross from Belgium to Holland. Those without proper authorization were turned away. Guards instructed passengers to exit the train for inspection. Baggage was lined up for search. The boys' jackets with medals caught the guards' attention. After a heated discussion, the guards began examining their luggage. Jimmie, displeased by the rough treatment of his belongings, exchanged words with the guard. Despite their frustration, the boys endured the search until it was over. Jimmie expressed his desire to challenge the guard in a race.|"[""1.

In a short while, the boys stood before a senior officer with gray hair in a dimly lit room. The soldier spoke rapidly in German, introducing the boys with gestures. After placing a package on the table, he scrutinized the boys with satisfaction. When a disturbance arose, the officer addressed the boys, and a soldier accused Ned of carrying suspicious items. The officer requested evidence, and a search ensued. Jimmie, amused by the soldiers' confusion, kept quiet. Eventually, the officer, satisfied with the boys' passports and a request from their friend, allowed them to leave. Later, Jimmie recounted seeing a scarred hand during the chaos, leaving his friends astonished.|"['1.

Jimmie shared his experience, explaining how he refrained from alerting the thief during a critical moment, thinking the thief was aiding them. Jack praised the thief's self-control. They speculated if the disturbance at the door was a ploy to aid the thief. However, they couldn't unravel the mystery of the missing parcel with a peculiar mark. Exhausted, they settled for sleep on the train, departing from a war-torn area. They envisioned returning to New York, their club room adorned with trophies. Their journey ahead seemed peaceful, but if they knew the challenges awaiting, their rest might not have been serene. Thanks to von Moltke, they had a compartment to themselves. As the train reached Utrecht, another passenger joined them, heading to Amsterdam like the boys, hoping to find a way home from there.|"['1.

Ned decided not to resist and sat down, trying to distract his friends by talking about the ships and traffic they could see. Mackinder revealed that he was tasked with finding a package crucial to two countries, possibly more, that Ned was believed to have had in Flanders. Ned pointed out a scar on Mackinder's hand, suspecting he knew more about the package. Upset, Ned told Mackinder they no longer wanted his company. The group then set out to find a ship to the United States but faced challenges. They discovered their airship was at the freight sheds and decided to leave it there until they found a vessel home. After inquiries, they found a ship heading to New York in a few days. Despite the stormy weather, they hired a boatman to row them to the ship, realizing a storm was brewing. They planned to sail to England and then make their way back home.|"['1.

"Jimmie asked the boys, ""What did I tell you?"" as they passed a man grinning like a cat. Feeling wary, they headed to their hotel, still puzzled by recent adventures. At the hotel, a seafaring man, Captain Johannes von Kluck, approached them, offering a fast ship. The boys were intrigued by his oceanic air. Captain von Kluck, with a friendly smile, proposed a plan for them to take a ship. Ned suggested the captain join them for supper while they prepared to move their baggage to the dock. The boys read newspapers with headlines about submarine attacks. Harry marveled at the vast distance ships must cover. The boys discussed the speed needed for such travel."|['1.

Jimmie was eager to know the timeline of the ship sinkings. The newspaper mentioned that three ships sank at the Mersey on Wednesday morning, while others near the Thames, specifically 'off Margate,' were sunk on Thursday afternoon. Jimmie found it remarkable but possible. The ships were carrying food supplies to England and were targeted by the 'U-13' submarine. Ned speculated that it might be a blockade strategy to cut off England's food supply. Harry shared an incident where a steamer narrowly escaped a torpedo attack by the submarine near Lizard Head. The captain, von Kluck, expressed a willingness to take the risk for potential profit. Jack, feeling nervous about the situation, suggested loading the Grey Eagle boxes onto the Lena Knobloch promptly. The boys, along with the captain, headed to the vessel with the help of a reluctant trucker. Upon reaching the ship, the captain switched to a serious tone, giving orders to his crew with authority.|['1.

The fake milk seller glanced at the boy approaching. The streetlight shone on the gun Jimmie had taken out. Without explanation, the person left the dog team and ran towards a building. The boys realized the woman milk vendor disguise was a trick. They followed Ned's caution with a flashlight. They heard a body fall and recognized their friend's voice. When the light broke, they were attacked. Knocked down, they struggled. Ned, the last, searched for the light. They heard the door close as the attacker fled.

The boys hurried through the passage, growing more anxious about their missing friend, Jimmie. They worried that Mackinder might have harmed him. With their fears mounting, they hesitated to investigate further. Jack, frustrated, made snide comments about Mackinder while Ned rushed to Harry's side. Acting quickly, Harry removed a block of wood from Jimmie's mouth, freeing him from the gag that had been tied over his face. Impressed by Jimmie's resourcefulness in a difficult situation, Jack jokingly suggested he could become an escape artist. Jimmie, relieved to be freed, vowed to teach Mackinder a lesson.

As the man tied my hands, I felt a scar on his right hand, the same scar I saw before. Jimmie suggested not chasing him as he knew the 'U-13' package was not with us. Jack believed Mackinder dressed as a lady to follow us to the dock but fled when he saw we were armed. The boys, surprised by the captain's change in behavior, wanted to return home to the U.S. Jimmie agreed to hand over the package if they left immediately. Von Kluck's arrival made the crew alert.

The ship swiftly departed from the harbor, relying solely on the wind's strength. The boys watched in awe as the vessel, heavily loaded and cutting through the waves, was showered by splashes of water. Suddenly, a small motor boat appeared, struggling in the rough waters. Jimmie fired a shot, causing a commotion on the boat. The wind filled the sails, propelling the ship forward and leaving the motor boat behind. Von Kluck, concerned about floating mines in the sea, warned of the danger they posed. The boys joined Von Kluck for a simple meal of bread, cheese, and coffee. Refreshed, they returned to the deck, where the crew was busy with their tasks. The wind hinted at an impending rainstorm as the ship sailed towards its next destination.|"[""1.

The boys clung to the handrails as they made their way below deck. The ship was tilted at such an angle that walking was nearly impossible. Each dip of the vessel sent shivers through them. Waves crashed over the bow, water rushing along the planks and hissing through the scuppers. In the cabin, a swinging lamp cast eerie shadows on the walls as the wind outside moaned through the rigging. The creaking of timbers filled the cabin, adding to the unsettling atmosphere. After a while, the boys fell asleep. Waking later, they struggled up the companionway to the deck, where they were met with strong winds and icy sleet. Men on the ship quickly secured the sails as they rode the swells. In the distance, a large cargo steamer battled the fierce elements, narrowly avoiding a rocky obstacle.|"['1.

"""Yes,"" the boy with glasses confirmed, examining the damaged rudder stock. ""Von Kluck was right. The rudder is twisted and bent. The propeller blades are visible, but the rudder seems missing."" Jimmie sighed, resigning to more trouble. ""Whenever a Boy Scout appears, trouble follows. Why can't they stay home?"" A swimmer's head bobbed in the waves, approaching the schooner. Jimmie grabbed a buoy, ready to throw it to the swimmer. The swimmer went overboard, reappearing with the other boy. Both were pulled aboard, receiving care.

Frank shared his daring adventure with young Shaw, explaining how he defied Mr. Bosworth's opposition to follow him. Undeterred, Frank assembled a kit and secured passage on a British tramp ship bound for England. However, their journey took a dangerous turn when a submarine approached, forcing the crew to evacuate the ship. In the chaos, Frank found himself alone on the vessel as it sank rapidly. Thinking fast, he used a capstan bar to free a hatch cover, turning it into a makeshift raft. He floated until he spotted the Anne of Melbourne, a steamer that rescued him.

When Frank shared his encounter with the captain of the ship Anne, the decision was made to change course, heading north to avoid a lurking submarine. Despite being hailed by the same threatening 'U-13' submarine the next morning, the crew managed to escape with only damage to their rudder. The captain was distraught over the situation, and the ship's condition worsened. Thankfully, they evaded further harm as the submarine abruptly departed. The boys, safe but puzzled by a mysterious package, decided to return to New York. Captain von Kluck was intrigued by their tale, while the crew of another ship nearby prepared to assist the damaged vessel. With swift action and teamwork, the Lena Knobloch set sail once more, propelled by the wind and the efforts of its crew.|"['1.

Ned expressed unease about a man who seemed agitated after hearing about the 'U-13'. Observing the man's behavior, Ned and his friends sought refuge from the harsh weather in the cabin. As the schooner faced rough waves, the boys feared for their safety but trusted the experienced navigators, Captain von Kluck and his mate. Despite the storm, the crew managed the vessel skillfully. As the night progressed, the storm subsided, allowing the captain to adjust the sails. Suddenly, the lookout spotted a sinking ship, signaling the presence of a submarine emerging from the waves. The crew on the submarine began preparing to launch boats, prompting frantic activity on the schooner's deck.|"['1.

"Frank firmly stated, ""This isn't the same crew I met! They treated the men well! Although I don't support their method of sinking merchant ships, they did give people a chance to escape danger!"" With the hatch closed, the submarine prepared for a maneuver, swiftly plunging ahead and leaving the schooner behind. The submarine submerged, showing only the periscope before disappearing completely. The boys scanned the water for the submarine's return but found nothing. After a brief discussion between von Kluck and the mate, they decided to follow the course of the steamer Frank had escaped from, passing between the Shetland islands and the coast of Scotland to reach a port in western England.

Worried about the ship's safety and their own well-being, the boys sought refuge in the cabin to escape the raging storm. Inside, the sounds of the tempest were muffled, but the loud creaks and groans of the ship's timbers were unsettling. Feeling the vessel being battered by the waves, Jimmie expressed longing for their reliable Sea Lion. Suddenly, a violent roll threw the boys to the floor, signaling the captain's decision to face the storm head-on. Amidst the chaos on deck, the boys noticed the crew struggling under Von Kluck's commands. Alarmed, they hurried back on deck to witness the ship battling massive waves with skilled hands manning the oars.

Quickly rushing to the deck, he placed his load in the boat. Despite searching the cabin again, they couldn't find a container for fresh water. Hurrying to the galley, he discovered a large pot for boiling meat. Filling it from the deck barrel, Jimmie secured the lid cleverly and carried it to the stern. The four boys swiftly launched the small boat, hanging close to the schooner's stern. Harry tossed his luggage to waiting hands, and they leaped aboard as the boat swung near. They watched as the schooner sank, with a loud blast signaling its end. Slowly sinking, the ship vanished beneath the waves, leaving only the masts visible. Despite the disappointment, Ned tried to lift their spirits, knowing they needed to move forward. They rearranged themselves in the boat, relieved to have all they needed.

Ned explained that a mysterious package appeared in their luggage at the border between Belgium and Holland, believed to be stolen by a man named Mackinder. The package, marked 'U-13,' seemed to have a connection with a German submarine vessel of the same name. The Englishman, Mackinder, was keen on obtaining the package, hinting at its valuable contents for the German craft. The boys were granted comfortable quarters on the vessel and treated well by the crew. They speculated about their destination, suspecting it might be the heavily guarded Helgoland in the North Sea. Despite the stormy weather and uncertain circumstances, they remained curious and observant, taking in the sights of the bustling naval activity around them.|"[""1.

As the boys bid farewell to the Sturmvogel, they gathered the belongings of their friends who had set sail on the Lena Knobloch from Amsterdam. Upon reaching the dock, they spotted the small boat that had taken them away from the schooner, now being kept as evidence of their rescue. The vessel was being provisioned and readied for their journey, thanks to the efficient use of wireless communication. Coal was being loaded, supplies were being brought on board, and ammunition was being stowed away. General Gruenwold, whom they had been brought to meet, requested their assistance as practical electricians. They were shown diagrams of wiring plans, written in German, which they surprisingly understood.

"It was decided that Jimmie would steer the boat while Harry kept an eye on the engines. The rest were given different tasks in strategic spots, leaving only the wait for night. ""Yes, sir,"" the man continued. ""The boat had a lot of blood, and a blood-stained hammer was found in their toolkit. We suspect they got rid of him and might have quietly disposed of his body in the harbor!"" Despite the boys' objections, Gruenwold was firm. Ned's explanation of the blood was heard but didn't sway the decision. The boys found themselves in a room used for temporary confinement. The island didn't have a proper prison, but a nearby house served the purpose. A guard patrolled the area. Ignoring this, the older boy headed to the window, where flashes of sleet hit. Outside, darkness shrouded everything, with occasional light points from a sentry hut. Ned struggled with the latch, opening the window and revealing a surprising visitor - their missing friend, Mackinder. Ned was shocked. ""If you want to escape now, I can help. Otherwise, you'll face trial tomorrow for a crime you didn't commit,"" Mackinder whispered.

Jimmie, Ned, Harry, and Jack were on a submarine trying to escape. As they maneuvered the vessel out of the harbor, they encountered obstacles like a loud splash and adjusting the hatch. They decided to stay submerged to avoid detection. While navigating, they spotted a large object in the water. Despite facing challenges, they managed to keep the engines running smoothly. Jimmie then shared his journey from Amsterdam to Rotterdam and the events that led to his encounter with the German destroyer.

Jimmie expressed his frustration with Mackinder's actions, stating that it was unfair to search their belongings and doubt their explanation about the package. Mackinder defended himself, citing the war between his country and Germany as justification for his suspicions. Despite this, Jimmie remained neutral, refusing to believe that they carried information for a warring country. The boys then focused on painting the boat and setting sail. As they cruised, Jimmie dismissed the need for a chart, confident in their knowledge of England's location. The submarine sped ahead, reaching a fast pace of 25 miles per hour. They raised a white flag to signal their peaceful intentions, though they faced challenges securing the flagstaff due to a loose socket.|"[""1.

Harry persisted in pushing the engines ahead, hoping to catch up with the ship. The boys knew that chasing from behind was challenging and felt a bit disheartened. They observed the sailing vessel signaling for help with a string of flags, resembling U.S. flags. The steamer crew noticed the distress signals and altered their course. The ships closed in quickly, and Harry reduced the engine power to slow down. A shell narrowly missed them, prompting Harry to fill the ballast tanks and dive the submarine.

A mysterious diver in a strange suit appeared near the wrecked ship. The boys, hidden in their submarine, watched as the diver seemed surprised by the ship's position. The diver carried a burden from the cabin, then climbed overboard with a line attached to the mainmast. The boys observed quietly, unsure of the diver's intentions.

"Harry quickly operated the levers, activating the pumps with the storage batteries. The false ""U-13"" began to sink deeper below the wreck's rail.

Ned and Jimmie were in a tight spot on their boat, with a tangled line around the propeller shaft. Harry suggested a plan to fill the ballast tanks to sink the boat and then quickly empty them to rise to the surface, hoping the sudden movement would free the propeller. As they followed the plan, the boat began to rise rapidly. However, Jack proposed a daring idea to be shot out of the torpedo tube to cut the rope entangling the ship.

"Before Harry could respond, a burst of water and air spurted from the open valve. A small amount of water was expelled from the pipe, followed by a rush of fresh, clean air that was a welcome relief for the boys after breathing the stale air inside their craft. Shortly after, the stranger reappeared at the porthole, signaling to the boys before returning to his own vessel. Ned quickly unfastened the hatch cover, allowing a refreshing breeze to enter. As the wind calmed, the boys gathered on the deck and noticed the other submarine nearby, marked with the letters ""U-13"" similar to their own. Frank, noting the resemblance, hesitated before acknowledging the likeness. The stranger, dressed in blue, greeted the boys from the false ""U-13"" and retrieved a small boat from his vessel.

"The boys were stunned by the stranger's unexpected revelation. They gazed at him, bewildered by his uncanny resemblance to Mackinder and his denial of being him. Unable to speak, they could only stare in disbelief. The man, amused by their reaction, burst into laughter, finding humor in their confusion. Leaning against the railing, he continued to chuckle at the boys' expense.

Jimmie spoke up, acknowledging the man's help and expressing gratitude. Despite the situation, he assured the man that they would repay the kindness if given the chance. The man, claiming neutrality in a war, pointed out the damage to their propeller caused by a jammed line. He offered to tow their vessel to safety for repairs, which the boys accepted after confirming his statement by looking into the water.

After transferring to the man's vessel, the boys were amazed by the interior filled with canaries in cages and blooming plants.

Excitedly, the boys gathered around the open compartment, listening to the clink of coins as Jimmie sifted through them. With a handful of coins in his grasp, Jimmie examined them before letting them fall back. The other boy calmly mentioned his plans to explore more wrecked vessels before stopping. He explained that it was challenging to move the gold from the sunken ships to shore alone. To solve this, he proposed a plan to share the wealth with someone in need who would help transport the gold safely. The man described his diving suit equipped with compressed air, a searchlight, and a battery for retrieving the gold from the wrecks.

Without speaking, the boy moved to help the fallen man. He swung his axe swiftly, cutting the tight rope. Sparks flew as the axe hit the steel deck. The boys then climbed down to assist their injured friend. Suddenly, there was a loud explosion, feeling like a water volcano. They quickly lowered Mackinder through the hatchway. Once inside, Ned provided first aid. Realizing they needed a surgeon, Ned suggested heading to a port. The injured man began to regain control, feeling the cool air and Ned's care.
