Santa Claus gave Big Mary pretty clothes for different seasons. There was a red dress for winter, a white one for summer, and a blue silk dress for special occasions. Big Mary also had skirts, stockings, shoes, a pink parasol, and a white fur muff. Little Marian loved dressing Big Mary in these outfits. But when Marian got a doll's trunk for her birthday, she started undressing Big Mary to pack the clothes. This made Big Mary cold and sick. Dr. Prince advised that Big Mary needed medicine, fresh air, and to always wear her best clothes. Little Marian then dressed Big Mary in her blue silk dress, gave her the pink parasol, and the white muff. Freckle Frog, who admired Big Mary's clothes, asked the Morning Glory Ladies to make her a dress like Big Mary's for a party.|"['1.
