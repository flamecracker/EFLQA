Mountjoy was appointed as a deputy, and his success contrasted with Essex. His conquest by starvation at Kinsale proved effective. Spanish forces arrived, prompting Mountjoy and Carew to invest Kinsale. Tyrone attacked Mountjoy, but the attempt failed. The Spaniards and Tyrone surrendered. Tyrone was the last chieftain to rise against England. The war ended with Tyrone's position becoming untenable. Tyrone and Tyrconnel fled, leading to the confiscation of their territory. The Ulster Settlement followed. Parliament was summoned, aiming for a Protestant majority. The election was contested, resulting in a narrow Protestant win. A quarrel over the Speaker's election led to the dissolution of Parliament. Tyrone and Tyrconnel were attainted, and the statute of Kilkenny was reversed. Wentworth's arrival in Ireland marked a shift in methods, dissolving Parliament and implementing new policies.|"[""1.

In ancient times, Ireland was a densely wooded island with sparse population. The description of the island by old historians was not entirely accurate. It was a wild land covered in forests, streams, and lakes. The bogs, which once covered a significant portion of the island, were believed to be a result of the Irish allowing their lands to go to waste. However, it was later discovered that the bogs were mainly due to the growth of sphagnums and peat-producing mosses. Ireland had undergone significant geological changes, including being connected and separated from England and Europe. The early inhabitants of Ireland were believed to be savage hunters and fishermen. They were followed by the Firbolgs, a Belgic colony, and the Tuatha-da-Danaans, who were large, blue-eyed people of Scandinavian origin. Battles between these groups left behind stone remains that testify to the conflicts that took place on the island.|['1.

The ancient tales of Ireland recount fierce battles between the Firbolgs and the Danaans. The Firbolgs fortified themselves on Ben-levi, a strategic hill with the Mayo mountains as a retreat. The Danaans, advancing from Meath, positioned themselves on Knockmaa, a hill with a cairn believed to be from an earlier primitive race. The battle lasted three days, resulting in the Danaan king Nuad losing his arm, replaced with a silver one by the artificer Credue. The Danaans, skilled in metalwork, eventually secured victory, ruling for almost two centuries. Subsequently, the Milesians conquered the land, renaming it Scotia. The early Irish history, although partly fictionalized, is rich in legendary figures like Cormac O'Conn and Finn, adding a poetic and historical charm to Ireland's past.|"['1.

"Once upon a time, the Fenni tribe rested on the hill of Colkilla after a hunt on the Plains of Cliach. From afar, they spotted a giant ""Formorian"" leading a massive, ugly horse towards them. The heroes, amused by the odd pair, laughed at the foreigner and his horse covered in tangled black hair. The giant introduced himself as Gilla Backer and offered his services to the king for a year, requesting special care for his horse. When the horse was set loose, it caused chaos among the other horses until Gilla Backer decided to leave. As he departed, his horse followed, carrying the heroes on its back. The Fenni, amazed, decided to seek a ship to follow Gilla Backer. On their journey, they met two skilled youths, Foltlebar and Feradach, who possessed unique talents. Finn recruited them to track Gilla Backer. They set sail to unknown seas, encountering strange islands and finally arriving at a mysterious island with towering cliffs. Dermot O'Dynor climbed the cliff and found a well with a magical drinking horn, leading to a fierce battle with a wizard champion."|"['1.

Once upon a time, Dermot faced a wizard champion who tried to harm him by leaping into a well. Dermot, being clever, embraced the champion tightly, causing both to plunge to the bottom of the earth. In the depths, they encountered shadows and distant sounds until light suddenly surrounded them, and they emerged in Tir-fa-ton, a land beneath the sea where eternal flowers bloom and death is unknown. Dermot's adventures continued as he met other heroes and rescued the captured Fenni. The legends of old Ireland are rich with mythological and ancient sentiments, highlighting the power and influence of bards who held sacred knowledge and could bless or curse the land. The tales reflect a time of primitive beliefs and unimaginable powers, where the unknown was feared, and the bards' words held immense sway over the people.|"['1.

Unfortunately, we know very little about the daily life, customs, clothing, and religion of the ancestors of most Irish people today. There is uncertainty about whether human sacrifices were part of their religion as they were in Celtic Britain. Evidence suggests that prisoners of war or slaves were possibly sacrificed. Slavery was common in early Celtic Ireland, but the rules regulating it are mostly unknown. During the Anglo-Norman conquest, English slaves were taken from raids along the coast. Women in early Irish society fought alongside men until a law in the sixth century ordered them to stay home. The Irish Celts were fierce warriors, and fighting was a significant part of their lives. Society lacked central organization or social cohesion. The ancient Irish law, administered by judges called Brehons, was based on traditions predating Christianity. The law relied on fines rather than punishments, and primogeniture was unknown in land ownership. The Tanist, not necessarily the eldest son, succeeded the chieftain.|['1.

"In ancient Ireland, securing a Tanist while the chief was alive aimed to prevent minors or unfit individuals from inheriting leadership. This practice persisted for centuries post the Anglo-Norman invasion, even among English descendants who had assimilated into Irish culture. Land belonged to the clan and was theoretically held in common, redistributed upon an owner's death. Sons, legitimate and illegitimate, shared property equally. The value lay in grazing land, measured by the number of cows it could support. The ""Senchus Mor"" outlined rules against excessive rent, differentiating between rack, fair, and stipulated rents. The clan structure was loose, encompassing even near-slaves. Outcasts were settled on tribal lands, becoming armed retainers known as kerns and galloglasses. Representation systems were absent, with family bonds being paramount. Warfare was common, with fighting and raiding being glorified. Local ties were strong, and patriotism was rooted in local loyalties rather than a sense of nationality."|"[""1.

A remarkable figure was about to emerge on the turbulent stage, a missionary whose influence over an entire island, steeped in pagan practices, was nothing short of miraculous. This missionary, unarmed and lacking any authority to enforce his proclamations, managed to persuade the heathen country to abandon its beliefs. St. Patrick's story is shrouded in myths and legends, with only fragments of his life recorded in ancient manuscripts. Born around 390 AD in Dumbarton, he was taken captive to Ireland, where he tended sheep before escaping. Returning to Britain, he became ordained and later journeyed back to Ireland to spread Christianity. St. Patrick's arrival in Ireland was met with resistance, but he eventually won over converts and established churches and monasteries across the land. His fervor for conversion inspired a wave of missionary zeal that spread throughout Ireland and beyond, leaving a lasting impact on the region.|"['1.

After Christianity spread through Ireland, a remarkable era of spiritual and intellectual fervor emerged. Irish monks zealously shared their newfound faith, attracting thousands of converts from across Europe. The Irish monasteries offered free education to students from distant lands, shaping them into scholars. This period, spanning centuries, marked a significant chapter in European history. Irish monks established monasteries, becoming beacons of knowledge and faith in their communities. The tribes of saints flourished, creating hermitages along the rugged Irish coast. These monastic communities, some housing thousands, served as centers of learning and spiritual growth. The Irish way of life seamlessly integrated with Christianity, preserving traditions while embracing the new faith. The enduring monastic ruins stand as a testament to this transformative period in Irish history.|"['1.

About fifty years after St. Patrick passed away, a new missionary emerged, destined to continue his work and establish what would become the epicenter of Western Christendom. Born in 521 A.D. in Donegal, St. Columba belonged to a royal lineage, known for their great deeds and intellect worldwide. In 565, he embarked on a journey to Scotland with twelve companions, marking a pivotal moment in Western Christianity's history. St. Columba's presence stands out vividly in the foggy annals of early times, offering a tangible figure amidst the vague and elusive historical accounts of that era. His energy, love for his homeland, and humanity shine through, making him relatable across centuries. St. Columba's era was marked by England's lapse into Paganism under Saxon rule, creating an isolated Christian fragment in Ireland. Despite this, Ireland's missionaries, like St. Columba, played a crucial role in re-Christianizing Northern England, paving the way for a united Christian England.|"[""1.

In the early history of the Western Church, divisions arose between it and other churches due to disputes over external rules rather than matters of creed. Controversies like the proper tonsure and the correct date for Easter caused heated debates for over a century. The Synod of Whitby in 664 marked a turning point where Oswin, king of Northumbria, sided with Rome's authority over that of Columba. This decision led to a rift between the Irish and English brethren, with the Irish monks leaving Lindisfarne for Ireland. However, this did not affect the Irish Church at home or its influence abroad. The Irish monks continued their ways, eventually accepting Roman decisions on disputed matters. Despite internal rifts, the Irish Church thrived intellectually and spiritually, with centers like Armagh, Clonard, and Kildare becoming renowned throughout Europe for their learning and spirituality.|"['1.

In early Irish history, the tribal system began to evolve. The conflicts between septs or clans transformed into battles between powerful chieftains. These chieftains ruled over lesser ones, uniting them during significant events. Ireland was divided into four tribal kingdoms - provinces - each under the rule of different chieftains. Connaught, Munster, Leinster, and Ulster acknowledged the dominance of specific clans. The O'Neills of Ulster were considered over-kings of the island. Despite their later reputation for fighting, early O'Neills were passive rulers. The Irish were known for their love of music, with harps playing a significant role. The introduction of the black Viking ships in the late 8th century brought ruin to Ireland, with Turgesius being a particularly brutal invader. He attacked churches, killed monks, and established a stronghold near Athlone until he was finally defeated.|"['1.

During the time of the Northmen invasion in Ireland, a group known as the Land Leapers caused chaos by attacking monasteries for their valuables. The round towers of Ireland served as defenses against these invaders, providing shelter to the defenseless and valuable items. The Land Leapers, skilled in raiding, built towns along the coast like Cork and Dublin, where they amassed their spoils. The invasion led to centuries of war and brutality, erasing the gentler influences of Christianity. Unlike in England, where assimilation occurred, the Irish maintained a deep hatred towards the invaders. Even when the Northmen converted to Christianity, their violent ways persisted. Eventually, valiant figures like Malachy and Brian Boru emerged to resist the oppression, with Brian Boru becoming a significant figure in Irish history.|['1.

Brian Boroimhe, also known as Boruma or Boru, was a true king in Ireland's history. He was not merely a figurehead like many others who held the title. Brian knew how to rule and did so effectively. Despite not always following strict rules of fairness, he aimed to be the ultimate authority. Brian faced challenges from the O'Neills and the Danes but overcame them. He defeated the Danes at the battle of Sulcost in 968 and reclaimed Munster. Brian later conquered Leinster and Ossory, extending his influence across the land. He eventually became the Ard-Reagh after a struggle with Malachy, the over-king. Under Brian's rule, Ireland experienced peace and prosperity, with the Danes subdued and the country flourishing. Brian's reign marked a significant period in Irish history, showcasing his prowess as a true leader.|"['1.

The king, now old, saw his work crumble as the Danes stirred again. A rebellion in Leinster, aided by Danish towns, sought help from Northumbria, Man, the Orkneys, and more. Brian, with his Munster clansmen, Meath, Connaught, and his sons, faced the Viking force at Clontarf on Good Friday, 1014. The battle was fierce, lasting from dawn till dusk. The Danes, under Sitric, flew their pagan flag, the Raven Standard. The Irish, led by Brian's son Morrogh, fought valiantly. Brian, though present, did not join, praying for his cause. The Vikings fought hard, but Morrogh killed Sigurd of Orkney. In the end, the Northmen fled, some to ships, some to the woods. Brodar, passing Brian's tent, mistook him for a monk, and in the chaos, both Brian and Morrogh fell, witnessing the Irish triumph.|"['1.

Brodar attacked Brian with his axe, catching the king off guard. Despite Brian's strength, he managed to strike a blow at Brodar with his sword. In retaliation, Brodar raised his battle-axe and fatally struck Brian on the head, causing his demise. The Irish clergy retrieved Brian's body and buried him in Armagh with great sorrow. Brian's victory at Clontarf was significant, but his death led to chaos in Ireland. The country longed for stable leadership, which was lost with Brian's passing. The struggle for power ensued, with Malachy eventually becoming king. However, disorder persisted, and the land remained in turmoil. Successors failed to match Brian's capabilities, leading to further unrest and power struggles. Ireland spiraled into disarray until a new chapter began with Roderick O'Connor's reign.|"[""1.

The Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland was unique in that the knights involved were closely related, linked through Nesta, a Welsh princess. Nesta's alliances made her the ancestor of many Anglo-Norman families in Ireland. Gerald of Wales, a chronicler, was her grandson. Despite his biases and gullibility, he remains an engaging figure. The invasion had varied motives, including a Crusade-like allure for the pious due to issues within the Irish Church. The Danes of Dublin, despite their differences, joined the invasion due to reported Irish heterodoxy. The conquest was sanctioned by Pope Hadrian IV, emphasizing faith and religion. Fourteen years later, Dermot McMurrough, a controversial figure, sought Henry's support for his return to Ireland, leading to the invasion. His actions and the events that followed are well-documented in history.|"['1.

One of the key recruits was Robert de Clair, known as Strongbow, who Dermot enticed with the promise of his daughter's hand and the rule of Leinster. Giraldus, emotionally describing Dermot's exile yearning for Ireland, noted the difficulty of discerning land from clouds. Dermot was driven by a hunger for revenge, willing to deceive his allies to achieve his goals. After securing support, he returned to Ireland to plan further, landing near Arklow Head. The initial invaders, led by Robert FitzStephen, faced resistance in Wexford, eventually gaining control. Dermot gifted the town to his allies and a castle was built. The struggle continued with the Ossory clans, whom Dermot defeated with the help of his men. The invaders regrouped in Ferns, fortifying the area under Robert FitzStephen's guidance. The Ard-Reagh, Roderick O'Connor, gathered forces against them, leading to a temporary truce. Maurice Fitzgerald arrived, while Strongbow awaited the king's permission to join the fight in Ireland.|"[""1.

Shortly after this good start, Strongbow arrived with more soldiers. He attacked Waterford, which fell after a brief but intense fight. Dermot and the Earl joined forces and entered the town, where the Earl married Eva, Dermot's daughter. This event was depicted by Maclise in a painting, amidst smoke and casualties. Dermot was now in a strong position with his English allies and followers. Leading his followers through the Wicklow mountains, he descended upon Dublin, taking the town despite Archbishop St. Lawrence O'Toole's efforts for peace. The main Danes fled to the Orkneys. Next, Meath was targeted, defeating O'Rorke. Dermot then declared himself king, leading to Roderick killing Dermot's son. Strongbow aimed to return to his king but faced Danish retaliation. They were defeated, including John the Mad. Godred, king of Man, arrived, and Roderick besieged Dublin. Strongbow and his allies managed to relieve the siege and defeat the Wexford men. After a challenging series of events, Strongbow met the king near Gloucester, seeking forgiveness for his actions in Ireland. Henry II was initially angry but eventually pardoned Strongbow, and they returned to Ireland together.|"[""1. What event is depicted in Maclise's painting mentioned in the passage?\nA.

This marked the end of the king's struggle as he had a formidable force of four thousand men-at-arms, including four hundred knights, and a well-equipped fleet with ample provisions and innovative war tools. The chieftains of Ireland recognized his power and submitted one after the other. The king, Henry, journeyed through Tipperary and Waterford to Dublin, where he celebrated Christmas lavishly. The local chiefs were impressed by his grandeur, even learning to enjoy new foods like cranes. The bishops supported him, and at a synod in Cashel, the Irish Church was united with England's. However, Henry faced challenges as two papal legates were en route to investigate the murder of Becket. To address this, he appointed Hugo de Lacy as his Dublin representative and departed from Ireland, never to return.

Henry had grand plans for Ireland, wanting to appoint his son as king and establish a permanent royal presence. However, his son's misconduct thwarted this vision. The lack of a central government in Ireland led to chaos, making conquest by England difficult. The Irish lacked a united front against their assailants due to regional divisions. Henry's departure left the country in disorder, with Norman and Welsh settlers seizing land for themselves. The fighting was relentless, with settlers hiding in castles and the natives fighting fiercely. The settlers' armor contrasted with the natives' guerrilla tactics. The two sides had opposing strategies, with the settlers attacking and the natives relying on the land for defense. This clash of cultures led to ongoing conflict and resistance from the natives.|"[""1.

During the first twenty years after the invasion, Henry's departure marked the decline of hopes for the new colony. His son John, sent to Ireland years later, failed to establish peace due to his courtiers' disrespectful behavior towards the Irish chiefs. John's return, now as king, led to a successful campaign against the De Lacy brothers who ruled Ireland. Despite his vices, John's swift actions showed his governing capabilities. He reorganized territories, enforced military obligations, and left a mark on the country in just sixty-six days. His rule highlighted the need for a strong leader in Ireland to maintain order and prevent the tyranny of local lords.

The jealousy displayed by Henry and his sons towards the initial conquerors of Ireland is likely why Giraldus, despite being a courtier and a clergyman, is so detailed about their flaws. The Geraldines, in particular, were the targets of this jealousy, while Giraldus himself held them in high regard. He praises their bravery, fame, and beauty, emphasizing their advantage due to experience in Welsh wars. Giraldus laments that the Geraldines were not appreciated by a ruler, imagining a peaceful Ireland under their rule. Despite their chronicler's indignation, the Geraldines did well for themselves. Maurice Fitzgerald became the ancestor of the Earls of Kildare and Desmond, expanding their lordship. The Geraldines of Kildare held a significant position near Dublin, with Maynooth Castle dominating the Pale. By the 16th century, the Earl of Kildare practically governed Ireland. The Palatinates, initially three, granted Strongbow, De Lacy, and De Courcy power akin to petty kingdoms. Strongbow's inheritance was divided among five heiresses, leading to their eventual forfeiture to the Crown.|"['1.

In medieval Ireland, powerful families like the De Burghs and the Ormonds played significant roles in shaping the country's history. The De Burghs cunningly exploited conflicts among local rulers to expand their territories. They even drove the O'Flaherty clan from their lands. The Ormonds, descendants of Theobald Walter, remained loyal to the English Crown. James, Duke of Ormond, stood out as a key figure during the civil wars. Understanding these noble families is crucial to grasping Irish history. In Ireland, unlike England, where power lay with the monarch or Parliament, the barons were the backbone of the country. They waged wars, formed alliances, and sometimes even fought each other. The intricate web of alliances and conflicts among these families shaped Ireland's tumultuous past.|"[""1.

Edward I had grand plans for Ireland, though he never visited. Unfortunately, his reign drained Ireland's resources for wars elsewhere, weakening the government. Trouble erupted during Edward II's reign after the disastrous Battle of Bannockburn. The O'Neills allied with the Bruces, sparking war in 1315. Irish chieftains and even some colonists joined the invaders. Edward Bruce led a campaign of devastation, causing famine and pestilence. His brutal actions turned allies against him. The Scots' destruction led to their downfall as the colonists regrouped. The O'Connors suffered a major defeat. The clergy and local lords rallied against the invaders.

The conflict between Ireland and England had lasting effects. Discontent and rebellion spread across Ireland as England failed to intervene effectively. A sense of disbelief in English authority grew, leading to a temporary alliance between colonists and natives for self-defense. The English nobility adopted Irish customs and names, aligning themselves with the Irish chieftains. The Irish chieftain's power and freedom appealed to many, prompting them to abandon English ties. The English Pale was the only area where English rule held. Most of Ireland was left to the native Irish. Despite the potential for loyalty under a ruler like Edward III, England's focus was elsewhere. Ireland provided soldiers for England's wars, but little attention was paid to governing the country. Loyalty and patriotism from the Irish were never cultivated by England, a missed opportunity that could have changed the course of history.|"['1.

In 1361, a significant event took place in Ireland. Sixty-three absentee landowners, including heads of great abbeys, were called to Westminster to provide an army for Lionel, Duke of Clarence, who was sent as viceroy to Ireland. Clarence, the king's third son, held the title of Earl of Ulster through his marriage. A Parliament was convened in Kilkenny, where the Statute of Kilkenny was passed. This statute aimed to keep the English and Irish populations separate, prohibiting marriages, trade, and even language exchange between them. The Act reflected the tension between the English and Irish communities, leading to a divide that lasted for centuries. The harshness of the laws can be attributed to the weakness of the ruling authorities, who resorted to cruelty in a futile attempt to assert control.|"['1.

Richard II's rule in Ireland marked a significant period for historians due to his two visits to the country. In 1394, he arrived in Waterford with a massive army, aiming to address the deteriorating situation. The Irish colonists faced challenges as native tribes reclaimed lost lands. Art McMurrough, a prominent chieftain, had taken control of Leinster. Towns like Limerick, Cork, and Waterford were under constant threat. Richard hoped for an easy victory but faced difficulties. Despite initial submissions from Irish chiefs, conflicts persisted. After achieving little during his first visit, Richard returned in 1399 to quell uprisings. However, a battle near Kells resulted in the defeat of the royal army, including the death of the English Crown's heir. This defeat led to Richard's return to Ireland with a resolve to suppress the rebellion.|"[""1.

During a rainy July in Ireland, King Richard and his army faced challenges. With only 3,000 men, Art McMurrough wisely stayed hidden in the woods. The army suffered in the swampy ground with incessant rain, feeding the horses only green oats. Despite attempts to cut down the woods, the situation worsened. Meanwhile, Henry of Lancaster landed in England, causing unrest. Richard's delayed return led to his capture and eventual demise. As England's influence waned in Ireland, Art McMurrough asserted his power, demanding land and chieftaincy. The Irish Government's harsh laws failed to control the growing unrest outside the Pale. Acts became more severe, leading to brutal punishments for interactions with natives and intermarriage. The ineffective ferocity of the government reflected its declining power.|"[""1.

Irish history is marked by a recurring theme of monotony. Year after year, there is a sense of slow progression through a sea of disorder, brutal deeds, and misgovernment. The mind struggles to comprehend the chaos that seems never-ending. Even acts of violence lose their impact as they become routine, lacking any variation to break the monotony. The historian Campion acknowledges the challenge of navigating through these turbulent times, where disorder reigns supreme. In England, civil war rages on, but the majority of the population remains untouched. However, in Ireland, a state of constant carnage and pillaging prevails. The Church, with its strong presence, tries to maintain order amidst the chaos. Despite the inefficiency of the military and the limited revenue, seaport towns like Waterford and Dublin display resilience and self-defense capabilities. Dublin's daring maritime exploits earned its leader the prestigious title of Mayor, symbolizing a glimmer of organization in an otherwise turbulent era.|"['1.

In the fifteenth century, the Irish viceroys included notable figures like Sir John Talbot, known for his strict rule and fortifying the Athy bridge. Richard, Duke of York, was sent to Ireland first as an honorary exile but later gained popularity through his conciliatory approach, even amidst political turmoil. His son, the Earl of March, continued his legacy and gained support from Irish Yorkist partisans. The Wars of the Roses had a significant impact on English baronage but less so in Ireland. The Desmonds and De Burghs continued to rule their lordships, while the house of Kildare rose to power and dominance over other Irish houses for nearly a century. The Duke of York was the last royal viceroy to wield power in Ireland, with the Kildares maintaining influence even in his absence.|"['1.

"In 1480, Gerald, the eighth Earl of Kildare, known as Geroit Mor, or Gerald the Great, became deputy and ruled Ireland for 33 years until his death in 1513. He was described as a ""mighty man of stature, full of honour and courage"" and was respected for his valour and princely demeanor. Despite some reports of recklessness, he was a respected leader. During his rule, a dangerous plot by Lambert Simnel, claiming to be the son of Clarence, was thwarted. The plot, with German mercenaries, aimed to take the throne but failed. Lambert Simnel was eventually appointed as a turnspit by the king. Gerald, Earl of Kildare, was eventually pardoned by King Henry VII after submitting to the royal terms in Ireland."|"['1.

"The Irish primate, one of the few ecclesiastics who had refused to support the impostor, was then in London and advised against continuing Kildare in office. The king summoned the deputy and Irish nobility to Court, a summons obeyed by all but one. Lambert Simnel, the self-proclaimed king, served wine to his former Irish supporters. Earl of Howth, who rejected the impostor, was the only one to drink the wine, saying, ""I shall drink it for its sake and mine own."" Howth received a reward for his loyalty. Another impostor, Perkin Warbeck, found refuge in Ireland. Kildare was removed from office, and fresh conflicts arose between rival houses.

During a parliament session, the Earl of Kildare faced accusations of conspiracy and burning the church at Cashel. Despite being imprisoned and brought to trial, his wit and humor impressed King Henry. The Earl boldly defended himself, claiming he believed the Archbishop was inside the church during the fire. When advised to have a good counsel, he humorously stated he wanted the king himself. This comical exchange continued throughout the trial, leaving his accusers baffled. The king, recognizing Kildare's influence, released him and reinstated him as deputy under Prince Henry. Kildare, after marrying the king's cousin, returned to Ireland, where he dealt with rebellions and improved defenses. His use of ordnance in warfare marked a significant shift in Irish military tactics.

One of Earl Gerald's most notable achievements was the expedition that culminated in the battle of Knocktow, where lords from the Pale, supported by the deputy's native allies, clashed. The expedition was more of a personal dispute than a royal mission, revolving around a family feud between the deputy and his son-in-law McWilliam of Clanricarde. The battle resulted in a significant victory for the deputy's forces, leading to the reoccupation of Galway. Despite the suggestion of further violence by Lord Gormanston, the deputy resisted, maintaining peace. The battle of Knocktow occurred five years before Henry VII's death, marking a period of relative calm in Ireland. However, with Wolsey's ascent, a new era began, as he viewed the Geraldines as a threat to royal authority. The confusion between Kildare's personal power and his role as Viceroy caused governance issues, prompting Henry to appoint an English governor, the Earl of Surrey, to implement a comprehensive reconquest plan for Ireland.|"['1.

Earl Gerald the younger quickly gained favor at Court, accompanied Henry to France, and won an English bride. He possessed the charming manner of his family, known for generations. Kildare was allowed to return to Ireland, and after some changes in office, he was reinstated. However, in 1534, the situation worsened as Henry faced a struggle with Rome, making Ireland a threat. Kildare was imprisoned and faced serious accusations. His son, Silken Thomas, upon hearing of his father's supposed execution, rebelled against England. He renounced his allegiance, seized the Sword of State, and declared himself Henry's enemy. Silken Thomas attempted to take over Dublin but faced little resistance.

The rebellion in Ireland took a dark turn when Archbishop Allen, a fierce enemy of the Fitzgeralds, was brutally murdered by Geraldine supporters near Clontarf. This news caused a stir in England, prompting Henry to send Sir William Skeffington to restore order. However, Skeffington's efforts were slow and weak. Ormond, despite being alone, valiantly defended the government's interests. Skeffington's arrival did little to stop Lord Thomas' followers from wreaking havoc, burning towns near Dublin. After eight months, Skeffington finally advanced on Maynooth Castle, a Geraldine stronghold. The castle, thought to be impregnable, fell after a siege. The rebellion crumbled, with Lord Thomas surrendering to Lord Leonard Grey to spare his life.

In the 16th century, Sir Anthony St. Leger took charge in Ireland, focusing on diplomacy with skill. A parliament in Dublin aimed to enforce the Act of Supremacy. Lay members showed little interest, while the clergy strongly opposed. The parliament was adjourned, and upon resuming, a bill was swiftly passed, removing clerical representatives. The Act of Supremacy was enacted, closing thirteen abbeys and redirecting funds to the king. Subsequently, over four hundred religious houses lost their property. A significant parliament in 1540 gathered Irish lords and chieftains, offering them church lands as rewards for loyalty. Despite some discord, Henry VIII's reign in Ireland was relatively peaceful. However, subsequent reigns saw distrust grow due to land confiscations, leading to a deep-seated belief in the law's injustice.|"[""1.

During the 16th century, changes in Ireland were underway, with chiefs accepting land agreements that made them landowners under the king. While these agreements were unfair, the chiefs were not greatly affected. Some chiefs, like Con O'Neill and Murrough O'Brien, were granted titles by the king, with Con O'Neill even naming a non-legitimate son as his heir. Some peers even sent their heirs to be raised at the English Court. As civil unrest settled, religious tensions began to rise. Ireland, untouched by religious debates, was shaken when relics were destroyed. This act sparked opposition and a fear of returning to paganism. The arrival of Jesuits and resistance to new liturgies further fueled the religious divide. The Archbishop of Armagh and others resisted the changes, viewing reformers as heretics. Despite attempts to translate the Prayer-book into Irish, the resistance to change remained strong.|"['1.

The effort to impose Protestantism in Ireland had a unifying effect, rallying Irishmen against the Crown. This religious push dissolved longstanding divisions among Irish people, fostering a sense of brotherhood. The order to dismantle churches and eradicate Catholic symbols sparked resistance even in loyal towns like Galway and Waterford. Mary's reign briefly paused the religious conflict, focusing instead on land ownership. The aggressive acquisition of Fercal, Leix, and Offaly from Irish tribes through a plantation scheme stirred unrest. English colonists were settled on these lands, renaming areas in honor of the queen and Philip. While Mary's rule in England was marked by religious persecution, Ireland remained relatively untouched by such violence. The absence of executions for heresy in Ireland during this time contrasts sharply with England's history.|"['1.

Upon the 17th of November, 1558, Queen Mary passed away, and on the same day, Elizabeth ascended the throne. A new era began with Elizabeth's reign, marking a significant shift in history. Mary, the previous queen, was described as narrow-minded, plagued with sickness and a troubled conscience that distorted her judgment. In contrast, Elizabeth, at twenty-six, brought a fresh perspective to the throne. She had already faced challenges, possessed a strong spirit, and held the potential to lead her realm to greatness. As Elizabeth's rule began, Ireland initially experienced a period of conciliation. However, tensions arose in the North due to land disputes, particularly involving Shane, a charismatic yet complex figure in Irish history. Despite his flaws, Shane commanded respect and loyalty among his people, creating a nuanced narrative in the changing landscape of Ireland under Elizabeth's rule.|"['1.

Upon returning from England, Sussex faced another outbreak from Shane, who had significantly bolstered his position. Shane had not only gained the loyalty of his tribe but also secured allies from Scotch islanders migrating to Northern Ireland. With a body of these allies acting as his bodyguards, Shane swiftly outmaneuvered Sussex's attempts to detach other chieftains. Shane's daring actions, like overawing wavering chieftains and defeating Sussex's army, solidified his reputation as a hero in the North. Despite attempts on his life, Shane managed to come to terms with the English Court through an agreement facilitated by the Earl of Kildare. His visit to the English Court, with his imposing galloglasses, left a lasting impression. Shane returned to rule Tyrone with relative peace, maintaining order in the North while the rest of Ireland was embroiled in conflicts. His rule brought prosperity to his people, even if it relied on collecting spoils from other regions.|"['1.

Shane's career was coming to a swift end. In 1565, he surprised the Scots in Antrim, defeating many in a fierce battle. He even audaciously claimed to Elizabeth that it was all for her. Later, he raided Connaught, taking over 4000 cattle back with him. However, his luck was running out. Sir Henry Sidney returned to Ireland to crush Shane. Despite forming alliances and seeking aid, Shane's fate was sealed. Sidney, a formidable opponent, marched through Ulster, reinstating those displaced by Shane. Shane's last stand ended tragically when he was betrayed and killed by his supposed allies. His head was sent to Dublin Castle as a grisly trophy. This marked the end of a tumultuous and ultimately tragic chapter in Irish history.|"[""1.

In 1566, Sir Henry Sidney took charge as Lord-deputy of Ireland, standing out as one of the most capable rulers appointed by Queen Elizabeth for the country. His prior experience in various roles within Ireland gave him a unique advantage over his predecessors. Despite some controversial actions, he managed to maintain a level of popularity. After the turmoil caused by Shane the Proud, Sidney embarked on a journey through war-torn regions like Galway and Athenry, witnessing the devastating effects of conflict. He departed from the traditional policy of pitting lords against each other and instead focused on curbing insubordination, even resorting to military executions to maintain order. Sidney's approach paved the way for future governors like Strafford. The era also saw the revival of appointing presidents for provinces, with Sir Edward Fitton and Sir John Perrot taking charge of Connaught and Munster respectively. The arrest of the Earl of Desmond marked a significant event in resolving disputes over land ownership. The queen's interest in the case highlighted the political intricacies involved. Additionally, a plan to reduce expenses in Ireland through military colonization was set in motion, led by figures like Sir Peter Carew. This ambitious scheme aimed to establish military colonies and reduce policing costs, showcasing the innovative strategies employed during Sidney's tenure.|"[""1.

The decision to take heroic action was delayed. Carew decided to take matters into his own hands by forcefully removing the occupiers from the disputed lands and replacing them with his own followers. Unfortunately, some of the first lands seized belonged to the Butlers, brothers of Lord Ormond, who were likely to be heard in high places. Reports of atrocities committed by Carew led to retaliation from Sir Edward Butler. This sparked anger and fear throughout South Ireland, leading to open rebellion by Sir James Fitzmaurice and the younger Butlers. The Queen intervened to pacify Lord Ormond, who then withdrew his support. Sir Henry Sidney was sent to restore order through aggressive means in Munster. After years of resistance, Sir James Fitzmaurice eventually surrendered, bringing a temporary peace to Munster before the inevitable final conflict with the Desmond power.|"['1.

Sir James had left Ireland and sought aid for a crusade against England at Catholic Courts in Europe. Failing in France, he turned to Philip of Spain. Despite Philip's reluctance, Fitzmaurice approached the Pope successfully. Dr. Nicolas Saunders, an English refugee, was chosen to accompany the force. They planned to gather troops with guns, powder, and ships from Spain. Philip, more informed than Saunders, responded coolly. A fleet led by Stukeley, diverted to Morocco, met a tragic end. Fitzmaurice, Saunders, and others landed in Dingle, fortified Smerwick, and received some Irish support. Desmond hesitated, feeling the weight of his past actions and English power. The South of Ireland was in turmoil upon Fitzmaurice's arrival. Fitzmaurice's death in a skirmish doomed the Desmond rising, marking the end of a potential rebellion against English rule.|"['1.

Desmond hesitated in his castle, unsure whether to join the uprising or suppress it. Malby, newly arrived, pushed him to act by attacking Askeaton. The town was destroyed, but the castle stood. Desmond finally decided to rise up, rallying Munster. Ormond returned to chaos, with English forces lacking leadership. Pelham and Ormond united to attack, devastating the region. The English met at Tralee, continuing their ruthless campaign. The Desmond clansmen, leaderless, could only watch. Desmond and his brothers fled. Spanish ships landed, aiding the rebellion.

Admiral Winter and his fleet faced delays due to bad weather before commencing a siege. Both sides engaged in heavy firing, but the fort was soon deemed untenable. The garrison surrendered unconditionally, with only a plea for mercy. However, the surrendering Spaniards were mercilessly slaughtered, with only a few spared for ransom. Lord Grey swiftly returned to Dublin to quell the Leinster insurgents. Kildare and Delvin were imprisoned despite their non-involvement in the rebellion. Troopers were dispatched to the Wicklow mountains to capture insurgents. Baltinglass fled, while others were caught, killed, and their heads sent to Dublin.

Two major uprisings against Elizabeth's rule in Ireland had been successfully quelled. However, a third, even more significant rebellion was on the horizon. During this period, efforts to colonize the land increased. Munster, once fertile, had been ravaged to the point of desolation. Harvests were repeatedly destroyed, leading to widespread famine and death. The plan was to replace the population with new English settlers. Despite offering favorable terms, the colonization scheme failed. English settlers were reluctant to stay, while the dispossessed Irish natives resorted to raiding the settlers' belongings. Tensions escalated, setting the stage for further conflict. The struggle shifted to Ulster, where the southern uprising had little impact. The chiefs there remained loyal, with some even developing a rapport with the English Lord-deputy. This calm, however, was only temporary, as the underlying tensions threatened to reignite the conflict.|"[""1.

Sir William Fitzwilliam replaced Perrot as the Lord-deputy of Ireland in 1588. Unlike Perrot, Fitzwilliam was discontent with his rewards and sought to enrich himself. He believed there was hidden treasure from the Spanish Armada wreckage along the Irish coasts. Fitzwilliam issued permissions to search for the treasure and led the search himself, but it yielded no results. In a desperate attempt to find riches, he unjustly arrested loyal landowners and demanded ransom. Fitzwilliam's actions caused unrest in Ulster, leading to unjust trials and executions. Hugh O'Neill emerged as a significant figure in Ulster, favored by Queen Elizabeth. O'Neill, unlike his predecessors, had English influences and was not deeply committed to Catholicism. Despite his Catholic faith, O'Neill was more tolerant and open-minded, attending sermons and displaying a moderate approach to religion.|"['1.

"A man like Tyrone was cautious and understood the risks of rebellion. He had helped maintain order in Ireland and supported the queen. However, recent events pushed him towards rebellion.

In August of 1598, during a fierce battle between Bagnall and Tyrone at Blackwater fort, Bagnall was shot through the forehead and his army was routed. The victor seized flags, artillery, and provisions. The defeated army fled to Armagh and then to Dundalk. This defeat swayed many to side with the victor, as the Irish army's imagination was easily influenced by success. Elizabeth, now nearly seventy, faced her third war in Ireland. Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex, was appointed to lead the fight against Tyrone. Essex's initial successes in Spain had raised his reputation as a military leader. However, upon his arrival in Ireland, his decisions led to a series of disasters, starting with disobeying orders and appointing the wrong commander. Essex's failures began from the moment he set foot in Ireland, leading to a string of defeats.|"['1.

Essex's virtues and qualities worked against him during his command in Ireland. His chivalrous nature, sense of injustice, and open-mindedness made him appear indecisive and ineffective. Despite efforts to recruit more troops and engage with Tyrone, little progress was made. Facing reproachful letters from the queen, Essex agreed to an armistice, causing anger and astonishment. Another letter pushed him to return to England, leaving the command to subordinates. Lord Mountjoy then took over, a more pragmatic and self-seeking leader. Mountjoy's ruthless tactics, including causing famine and devastation, contrasted with Essex's more compassionate approach. The harsh methods employed by Mountjoy led to widespread suffering and death among the Irish population. Essex's failure, though disastrous for himself, may have been more honorable than Mountjoy's successful but brutal tactics.|"['1.

Mountjoy's successful policy in Ireland turned the tide against Tyrone. Initially, English power was weak, with Ormond held captive. However, Mountjoy's arrival changed everything. The royal power regained control, and Tyrone's influence waned. The war was fading when Spanish ships arrived, boosting the rebels. Mountjoy swiftly acted, surrounding Kinsale to block the new arrivals. Tyrone and O'Donnell joined but were too late. O'Donnell tried a surprise attack, which failed. The English were prepared, leading to a defeat for Tyrone. The Spaniards surrendered Kinsale, and many Irish left with them. This marked a turning point in the conflict, with the English regaining control and Tyrone's forces weakening.|"[""1.

This marked the near end of the conflict. Tyrone moved north, regrouping his forces. Carew headed south to retaliate against O'Sullivan Beare and the Kerry rebels. Mountjoy pursued Tyrone, gradually cornering him further north, repeating the successful strategy. Tyrone realized the game was over. Mountjoy aimed to end the war before the queen's imminent death. Terms were agreed upon. Tyrone surrendered, renouncing the title of O'Neill and foreign alliances. In return, he and his followers received full pardons and confirmation of titles and lands. Two days later, the queen passed away. Tyrone, who had recently fought against her, wept upon hearing the news. This marked the last significant rebellion by an Irish chieftain against English rule. The next uprising stemmed from different causes and evolved into a civil war. Tyrone's peaceful reception in England after the conflict infuriated English officials who had fought against him. They were determined to find him guilty of new treason. Tyrone, now sixty-two, found it impossible to live peacefully, constantly under surveillance and facing legal battles. Despite the peace, officials were convinced he would rebel again.|"[""1.

The departure of Tyrone and Tyrconnel in 1607 remains a mystery. Although they received a warning of imminent arrest and fled to Rome, their innocence or guilt in the alleged conspiracies is uncertain. Their flight resulted in the forfeiture of their estates, covering six counties, by the Dublin Government. The new plantation scheme aimed to avoid past failures by ensuring resident ownership and English-speaking settlers. Marriages between natives and settlers were prohibited, and the Irish were forced to relocate to designated lands. Sir John Davis played a key role in this plan, causing dismay among the dispossessed owners. Despite legal challenges, the commissioners proceeded with the plantation, emphasizing the king's lawful right to do so.|"['1.

In 1613, the Government aimed to legitimize their actions in Ulster by summoning an Irish Parliament. However, the challenge was securing a Protestant majority. Carew and Sir John Davis devised a plan. New towns in Ulster became Corporations with the power to elect members. The Catholic party and the Government engaged in a fierce contest. The Parliament convened with a narrow Government majority. A dispute erupted over the election of a speaker, leading to a physical altercation. Eventually, the king resolved the conflict, confirming Sir John Davis as the Speaker. The Parliament then passed an Act of attainder on Ulster landowners and abolished the Brehon law, while repealing the statutes of Kilkenny. This marked a significant change allowing English and Irish equal access to the legal system.|"['1.

The enthusiasm for Irish colonization was still strong even after the Ulster settlement. Many saw it as a solution, especially the king. After a successful settlement in Ulster, the idea of extending this to the rest of Ireland gained popularity. A commission was formed to investigate land ownership and titles. Records in Dublin and London were carefully examined, revealing flaws in titles. This led to a rush of undertakers from England to Ireland. The government supported this influx. Land in various parts of Ireland was claimed by the king, and heavy fines were imposed on landowners for fresh grants. The Connaught landowners faced similar challenges due to technicalities and legal issues. The arrival of Wentworth, also known as Strafford, in 1632 marked a shift towards more authoritarian rule in Ireland.|['1.

Upon arriving in Ireland, Wentworth acted decisively as if the country was conquered. His main goal was to demonstrate that a well-managed parliament could be a tool for the king, not a threat. He immediately called for an Irish parliament upon his arrival, ensuring a balance between Protestants and Catholics. At this gathering, he demanded a £100,000 subsidy to cover debts to the Crown, promising a second session for other considerations. The subsidy was granted, but the second session never happened as the parliament was dissolved. Wentworth then targeted the Connaught landlords, challenging their titles and claiming their lands for the Crown. He imposed heavy fines and imprisonment on those who resisted. Despite his tyrannical methods, Wentworth improved revenue and established an army, aiming to strengthen the king's power in both Ireland and England. While he was a born tyrant, he also effectively governed by cracking down on corruption, promoting trade, and ensuring law and order for all Irish people.|"[""1.

Wentworth, also known as the Earl of Strafford, was a powerful figure in Irish history. He aimed to align the Church of Ireland closely with the Church of England, even going so far as to suppress Presbyterian ministers and dissent. He did not spare even respected figures like the Primate Ussher, treating them with contempt. Wentworth's influence extended to the Convocation, where he forced his own set of canons upon them, disregarding their objections. As civil unrest loomed with the Scots and English Puritans, Wentworth hurried back from Ireland to prepare the Irish forces for action. However, his plans were disrupted by events in England, leading to his impeachment, trial, and execution for high treason. His downfall in 1641 marked a significant moment in Irish history, setting the stage for further tumultuous events.|"[""1.

The entire nation was in a frenzy of excitement. The downfall of Strafford, a ruler known for his iron rule, had stirred up chaos. The army he had assembled, mostly composed of Catholics, was a source of discontent among Irish Protestants and the English Parliament. Charles was compelled to disband it and store the arms in Dublin Castle, but the soldiers remained. Tensions were high between Presbyterians and the Irish Church party due to Strafford's actions. The dispossessed clans in the north were also simmering with resentment. Amidst this atmosphere, a rebellion was brewing. Rory O'Moore and Sir Phelim O'Neill, along with others, plotted to seize Dublin Castle, distribute arms to troops, and take control of garrison towns. The plot was nearly successful, but a Presbyterian convert revealed it just in time to prevent a disaster. While the initial plan failed, subsequent actions led to atrocities, with settlers in Armagh and Tyrone being attacked and left defenseless. Sir Phelim O'Neill led brutal attacks, causing widespread suffering and death.|"[""1.

Cruelty begets more cruelty, spreading like a poison that extinguishes humanity's instincts. Ireland was engulfed in atrocities during this dark period. A Scottish force, sent to Carrickfergus, mercilessly slaughtered innocent Irish families. In Wicklow, Sir Charles Coote committed horrific acts against the O'Byrnes and O'Tooles. Amid the chaos, Bishop Bedell of Kilmore stood as a beacon of peace. The true number of victims remains unknown, with rumors inflating the figures. The rising escalated, with Dublin establishing martial law and arming Protestants. Ormond sought to quell the rebellion before it spread. The southern provinces remained calm, while the Pale region debated its loyalty. By December, a national uprising emerged, uniting the island against the English Parliament.

During a turbulent period in Irish history, the Lords Justices failed to grasp the seriousness of the situation. Instead of addressing the crisis, they focused on legal matters and the potential land seizures. Ormond's pleas to take action against Sir Phelim O'Neill were ignored. The northern uprising, lacking military expertise and organization, began to falter. Suddenly, reinforcements arrived in Donegal and the south, led by Owen Roe and Colonel Preston, respectively. Under their command, the disjointed forces started to organize. A council meeting in Kilkenny aimed to unify the insurgents, creating the Catholic Confederacy. Charles I sought their support but faced challenges due to religious differences. Eventually, Ormond took control, leading to a truce with the Confederates.

The intense excitement caused by the Ulster massacre in England only grew as more details emerged. The Protestant community felt a deep desire for revenge, reminiscent of the Indian Mutiny. The circumstances leading to the massacre were overlooked, but looking back, it was almost inevitable. The native Roman Catholic community rose against the introduced Protestant one due to agrarian grievances, not solely religious reasons. Negotiations with the Confederates implicated in the massacre were perilous, as the Protestants saw all Irish as guilty. Charles I faced difficulties as the Confederates demanded religious freedom, an Irish parliament, and more. Unable to compromise, Charles secretly sent Earl of Glamorgan to make a deal, offering land, pardons, and religious freedom in exchange for support. The Confederates agreed, leading to a complex political situation.|['1.

Ormond suspected a secret agreement from the start, confirmed when Irish troops led by the Archbishop of Tuam tried to retake Sligo in 1645. The Archbishop's death revealed the treaty, causing a stir. Charles denied it, but the truth was known. Rinucini, a new player, aimed to restore Catholicism in Ireland and prevent reconciliation between Catholics and the king. Battles intensified, with O'Neill defeating Scottish forces, gaining control of the north. Rinucini and O'Neill took Kilkenny, imprisoning moderates.

"The complex situation in Ireland took a dramatic turn as alliances shifted rapidly. Inchiquin, known as the ""poor panther,"" switched sides between the king and Parliament, creating confusion. Rinucini and O'Neill opposed the Moderates to prevent Catholic-Royalist unity. Ormond and Prince Rupert arrived to bolster the royal cause, while Colonel Jones led the Parliamentary forces in Dublin. The king's trial led to a consolidation of forces, with even O'Neill eventually joining the Royalists. Cromwell's impending arrival in Ireland intensified the conflict. Ormond's failed attempt to take Dublin at Baggotrath marked a turning point. Cromwell's crusade-like mission aimed to hold accountable those responsible for bloodshed.

"From Drogheda, the Lord-General headed south to Wexford. A fierce defense was met with a successful assault, leading to a grim scene of battle and loss. The Lord-General reports, ""Not many less than two thousand of the enemy were lost, and barely twenty of ours."" The soldiers reaped rewards from the conflict. The former inhabitants had fled or perished in the turmoil. Most towns surrendered swiftly upon summons. The Irish forces dispersed, attempting to protect Kilkenny, which fell after a week. Clonmel met a similar fate. Cromwell's actions, though harsh, were seen as just in his eyes. His troops were disciplined, forbidden to loot under threat of hanging.

The Covenant, signed a year later, led to the collapse of the fragile pact in Ireland. The Catholic party broke away from Ormond, forcing him into exile. The struggle continued under Hugh O'Neill, with Limerick being one of the last to surrender. Despite the odds, O'Neill and his men fought bravely. The civil war ended after eight years, resulting in a loss of about 600,000 lives. The survivors faced harsh consequences in Ireland, unlike in England where the defeated could retire peacefully. The Puritans sought vengeance, leading to trials and punishments. Cromwell's plan for mass eviction of Catholics shocked the nation, forcing them to move to a desolate area in Connaught. The scheme aimed to uproot all Catholic landowners, leaving them destitute. The despair caused by this plan was immense, affecting people of all ages and backgrounds.|"[""1.

The new owners were prepared to replace those about to be removed. Cromwellian soldiers, owed pay and land grants, were to be disbanded and given land in the eastern provinces. English investors awaited Irish lands. As the 1st of May approached, pleas for more time before exile arose across Ireland. Some Parliamentarians felt pity and urged a delay. Exiles sent to North Clare faced harsh conditions. Families left behind were shipped to the West Indies as slaves. Exiles began their journey with herds of cattle and armed escorts. The new settlers faced challenges as soldiers sold land grants, speculators profited, and some soldiers married Irish wives. Despite efforts to enforce the evictions, many new settlers integrated into Irish society. The mass eviction left a bitter legacy but did not achieve its intended goals.|['1.

After Cromwell's death, his son Richard briefly attempted to govern but soon retreated from public life. Henry Cromwell, who had ruled Ireland with kindness, also resigned. Coote and Broghill, who had gained vast estates under Cromwell, eagerly welcomed the Restoration. The new king faced a dilemma as loyalists like Coote and Broghill were crucial in restoring order in Ireland. It was impossible to strip them of their gains. Ormond and some lords were reinstated promptly, but others faced delays. A Court of Claims was established to assess loyalty during the war. A lengthy period of disputes followed, with many original landowners proving innocence. Eventually, soldiers agreed to surrender a third of their lands, leading to settlement. The Irish Catholics saw a significant reduction in land ownership post-Restoration. Presbyterians in Ulster faced severe persecution, leading many to leave Ireland due to the enforcement of the Act of Uniformity against nonconformists.|"[""1.

The Roman Catholics were granted more freedom after nearly a century of strict laws. Many priests returned, causing alarm among Irish Protestants and English Protestants due to past conflicts. The murder of Sir Edmondbury Godfrey, initially blamed on Papists, sparked a frenzy. Innocent Irish Catholics were arrested, priests were expelled, and some were even put to death unjustly. Dr. Plunkett, a respected Archbishop, was falsely accused and executed. When James became king in 1685, he aimed to make Ireland a refuge for Catholics, leading to radical changes. Protestant officials were replaced with Catholics, causing unrest. James' plans were met with resistance, and the situation remained volatile until his rule ended.|"['1.

From this point, the stream flowed swiftly and powerfully. Recent changes, particularly the reorganization of the army, had caused great concern among the entire Protestant community. A petition drafted by the former landowners and sent to the king against the Act of Settlement had also filled them with fear for their lands. Now, with this new appointment, their worries reached a peak. They trembled at the thought of what might happen under the rule of such an unscrupulous and bigoted man, supported by an army mainly composed of Roman Catholics. The departure of Clarendon signaled a new wave of Protestant emigration. Rumors of a massacre spread, leading terrified people to flee to the coast and sail to England. Those who stayed prepared to defend themselves in barricaded homes, while Protestants in towns like Enniskillen and Londonderry closed their gates to brace for a siege. Meanwhile, in Dublin, Protestant estates were being restored, but Protestants were ordered to surrender their weapons, facing dire consequences if they did not comply. The soldiers, now mostly Catholic, lived off the land of Protestants, seizing their property and livestock. Many Protestants fled to the north for safety, where they gathered for self-defense. William of Orange had landed in Torbay, prompting James to flee to France. Tyrconnel, caught off guard, hesitated on his next steps. The tensions on both sides were too high for diplomacy. Louis XIV welcomed James and supported his return to power|"['1. What recent changes had caused great concern among the entire Protestant community?\nA. The appointment of a new king\nB.

James's arrival in Ireland was met with a warm reception. As a king, a Catholic, and a man facing tough times, he had a strong connection with the Irish people. They greeted him with tears, blessings, and cheers along the road from Cork to Dublin. Women lined the streets, holding up their children to catch a glimpse of him. Flowers were offered or strewn at his feet. Despite the poverty, the Irish showed their devotion. In Dublin, James faced challenges with his followers. The French ambassador urged him to stay in Ireland, but James insisted on heading north towards Scotland. He believed his supporters would gather once he crossed over. However, the city of Londonderry did not yield. The heroic defense of Londonderry against James's forces is a tale of bravery and resilience.

These events were natural but terribly unfortunate. Until then, laws directly penalizing Catholics were rare. A Catholic could participate in Irish Parliament, inherit and pass on lands, and educate children freely. The fear instilled in Protestants led to harsh laws aimed at subjugating their enemies. Meanwhile, a significant victory was achieved by Enniskillen troops at Newtown Butler. William, delayed in England, sent forces led by Schomberg to Ireland. Schomberg’s troops, mostly inexperienced, suffered in the harsh climate. He stationed them at Dundalk, where they misbehaved and faced a deadly epidemic. Both armies faced disorganization. William arrived with a diverse army at Boyne, near Dublin, for a decisive battle. James observed from afar as his forces, inexperienced and poorly armed, were defeated.

In Dublin, William issued a pardon to end the conflict and avoid bloodshed. Despite being abandoned by their king and facing defeat, Irish troops in Athlone, Galway, Cork, Kinsale, and Limerick stood firm. Sarsfield, determined to defend Limerick, resisted French advice to surrender. When William's army approached, Sarsfield launched a daring attack on the siege train, delaying the assault. The siege continued with vigor, but the Irish fought back fiercely, even women joining the defense. William, needed in England, left Ginkel in charge. The siege of Limerick, like that of Londonderry, showcased religious and patriotic fervor against the odds. In Galway, French troops left, replaced by St. Ruth.

The articles in question aimed to grant Roman Catholics in Ireland the same rights they had enjoyed during Charles II's reign. Specifically, they sought to ensure Catholics could pursue their trades, professions, and retain their lands. However, controversy arose over a clause that was omitted, leading to heated debates. Despite William's efforts to include the omitted clause, public opinion in England was against it, and Parliament refused to ratify it. Consequently, the treaty became ineffective. On the other hand, a military agreement allowed Irish troops to choose between serving in France or under William. Most troops opted for exile, causing heart-wrenching scenes as families bid farewell to their loved ones. The departure was chaotic, with women clinging to departing boats, some tragically drowning.

"At the brink of a significant century for Ireland, a shift in fortune was imminent. Unlike the previous eras marked by revolts and uprisings, this century saw a different trajectory. While conflicts like the Jacobite risings in England and the American Revolution unfolded, Ireland remained remarkably calm. The fighting spirit seemed to have dissipated, with Irish fighters scattered across European battlefields. The country, once a hub of conflict, now lay quiet, albeit eerily so. The era was meticulously chronicled by Mr. Lecky in his ""History of the Eighteenth Century,"" offering a unique insight into Ireland's past. The period was marred by oppressive laws like the Penal Code, which aimed to suppress the Catholic population, depriving them of basic rights and freedoms. This unjust system, affecting the majority of the population, created deep divisions and hardships within Irish society."|['1.

Irish Protestants, once fanaticism waned, didn't harshly enforce legal bans against Roman Catholics. Despite laws prohibiting Catholic dignitaries from entering Ireland, they did so with little resistance. Protestant clergy were scarce, and many held multiple livings, leading to a lack of presence in Catholic-heavy areas. This isolation caused Protestant conversions to Catholicism. The Penal code aimed to suppress Catholicism but failed, with more conversions from Protestantism to Catholicism than vice versa. Catholics showed devotion despite persecution, while Protestants held power. England hindered Irish prosperity, passing laws against Irish cattle and wool exports. English traders feared Irish competition, leading to bans on Irish wool exports. This protectionist policy hurt Irish agriculture and industries, causing economic turmoil.|['1.

The impact of this law was immediate and astonishing. The majority of manufacturers, who had arrived in large numbers, departed the country within six months, never to return. A sudden wave of unemployment swept through the population. Emigration began, yet despite many leaving, famine afflicted those who remained. The poorest classes in Ireland always teetered on the edge of starvation, so even a less severe blow could have pushed them over. Smuggling on a massive scale commenced right away. Wool flooded the black market as legitimate markets vanished. A huge illicit trade emerged, with wool fetching high prices in France. The entire population, from top to bottom, threw their support behind smugglers. The long and complex coastline made it easy for French vessels to sneak in and seize wool stored in caves along the south and southwest coasts. What was meant to be an honest trade turned into a criminal enterprise, as the people resorted to clandestine methods due to the oppressive law.|"['1.

"This passage discusses the political activism of Molyneux and Swift in Ireland during the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Molyneux's work supporting the rights of the Irish Parliament against English interference caused a stir in the political landscape. His famous remonstrance, ""The Case of Ireland being bound by Act of Parliament made in England,"" challenged England's authority over Ireland. Despite being condemned and burned by the English Parliament, Molyneux's dignified and respectful language highlighted the importance of preserving Parliament's rights.

In 1743, Charles Lucas, a Dublin apothecary, stirred public opinion through his writings in the _Freeman's Journal_, denouncing Parliament's corruption and advocating for Ireland's self-governance. His bold stance led to his addresses being burned by the grand jury of Dublin and a warrant for his arrest in 1749. Lucas fled to England and returned years later, becoming a member for Dublin. While his speeches in Parliament lacked the impact of his writings, he supported the patriotic party led by Henry Flood. Lucas's efforts highlighted the need for reform in Ireland's governance, challenging the entrenched system of patronage and lack of public influence on Parliament's proceedings. His advocacy for Ireland's rights resonated with many, contributing to the growing call for change in the country's political landscape.|"[""1.

Flood and Grattan were two exceptional orators and statesmen in the Irish House of Commons during a brilliant era. Flood, initially a powerful figure, later made a grave error by accepting a governmental role under Lord Harcourt. Despite his previous advocacy for Irish independence, Flood's decision led him to support restraints on Irish trade and prosperity. However, Flood's conscience led him to abandon his office during the American war, rejoining the liberal cause and relinquishing his salary. Yet, the emergence of Henry Grattan overshadowed Flood's return. A bitter rivalry ensued as Flood tried to outshine Grattan. However, Grattan, supported by Parliament, resisted Flood's attempts. Flood eventually withdrew from Irish public life and later failed to make an impact in the English Parliament. Despite his later setbacks, Flood's early efforts against restrictions on Irish prosperity are remembered gratefully.|"['1.

Great leaders like Grattan uplift entire nations and inspire those around them. Grattan, an Irish politician, stood out for his loyalty and patriotism, qualities often seen as conflicting but in him, they blended harmoniously. Despite risking his popularity when duty called, Grattan remained steadfast in his beliefs. He entered Parliament in 1775 and supported American colonists in their fight for independence. His eloquence and advocacy for free trade and self-government resonated deeply. Grattan's famous Declaration of Rights, demanding independence for Ireland, faced opposition even from friends like Edmund Burke. Yet, Grattan's determination prevailed, leading to significant legislative changes. Although he declined a grant from the country, Grattan's efforts brought a period of prosperity, marked by social and economic growth. Despite setbacks and disappointments, Grattan's legacy as a patriot and leader remains a symbol of Irish resilience and determination.|"['1.

Henry Grattan passionately opposed the Union, believing in Ireland's destiny with its own Parliament. His loyalty and eloquence in the English Parliament earned respect. Despite his achievements, he stayed connected to his homeland. Grattan passed away in 1820, leaving a legacy of making others happy and free. The American Colonies' revolt influenced Ireland, facing similar restrictions on commerce. The woollen trade suffered, and laws against Presbyterians impacted commerce. The country faced agricultural hardships, absentee landowners, and a growing pension list. The absence of troops left Ireland vulnerable. An unsuccessful attempt to levy a Protestant-only militia highlighted the government's financial struggles. Grattan's unwavering dedication to Ireland and his impact on history alongside Edmund Burke marked a significant era in human history.|"[""1.

In 1782, a significant movement arose in Belfast due to fears of invasion by the French and a notorious pirate, Paul Jones. The citizens decided to form a volunteer force for self-defense. This idea spread rapidly across the country, with 60,000 men enlisted in a few months. The Government, though initially alarmed, eventually provided arms for the volunteers. The volunteers, led by Lord Charlemont, demanded free trade rights. This demand gained momentum when Parliament unanimously agreed to the proposal. Subsequently, the Government repealed trade restrictions, allowing Ireland freedom in trade. This victory was celebrated with bonfires, illuminations, and salutes. The movement led to Ireland's legislative independence, marking a significant shift in the country's history.|"['1.

"The volunteers' purpose was fulfilled after the American war ended, securing Parliament's independence. Flood, advocating for ""simple repeal,"" urged for reform while the volunteers were active. Grattan also sought reform but believed the timing was premature. Despite warnings about delaying reform, the volunteers disbanded peacefully. Flood's attempt to pass a Reform Bill during a volunteer convention in Dublin was rejected. Grattan understood the need for equal political power for all citizens, unlike Flood. Parliament's corruption persisted, with members tied to the government. Efforts to improve Ireland's trade relations with Britain were met with resistance from English towns.

"Lord Chesterfield, a Lord-Lieutenant who made efforts to understand Ireland, once addressed the issue of subletting in clear terms. In Ireland, subletting was widespread, with several intermediaries between the landowner and the actual occupier, leading to chronic semi-starvation among the latter. The problem was not rooted in disloyalty, as evidenced by a letter from Robert Fitzgerald, the Knight of Kerry, suggesting that the people would support the king if a recruiting officer was sent. However, if an enemy landed nearby, they might join them. The tithe system was another burden that led to Whiteboy outrages against tithe proctors. In the North, similar uprisings among Protestants like the ""Oak boys"" and ""Steel boys"" subsided after their grievances were addressed.

In 1794, some Whig members, like Edmund Burke and Lord Fitzwilliam, left Fox to join Pitt. They aimed to grant Irish Roman Catholics equal rights with Protestants. Initially, Pitt hesitated but eventually agreed, appointing Lord Fitzwilliam as Lord-Lieutenant in Ireland. His appointment was met with great joy as he supported emancipation. Despite some disaffection, the educated Roman Catholics were loyal. Grattan supported the Government and introduced an Emancipation Bill. However, the Government's intentions changed suddenly, leading to Lord Fitzwilliam's resignation and the restoration of displaced officials. Grattan's Bill failed, reigniting rebellion. Pitt's actions were seen as foolish, raising hopes only to dash them. The situation in Ireland worsened, leading to future unrest.|"['1.

"From this point, the stream flows steadily to its end. Lord Fitzwilliam's departure was seen as a national disaster by both Protestants and Catholics. In Dublin, shops closed, people mourned, and crowds followed his carriage to the boat in sorrow. Grattan's Bill was lost, frustrating the Catholics even more. The Irish Parliament dwindled in significance. Despite attempts to revive reform, Grattan eventually gave up. The ""United Irishmen"" transformed into a republican group, influenced by the French Revolution. The society aimed to establish a republican government through force in Ireland.

One unfortunate outcome of the narrow escape was the Irish Executive's harsh response. They, feeling inadequate and terrified by recent dangers, resorted to extreme repression. Habeas Corpus Act was suspended, and martial law imposed in five northern counties. United Irishmen's committee was arrested, their paper, The Northern Star, shut down, and many thrown into jail. The English troops, undisciplined, mistreated the people. Grattan and Ponsonby opposed these actions, proposing a reform bill to calm tensions. Despite their efforts, the motion failed due to panic among Commons members. General Lake and Lord Carhampton were blamed for the troops' misconduct. Abercromby replaced Carhampton, criticizing the troops' behavior. Disputes arose, leading to Abercromby's resignation.

On May 24th, a rebellion erupted with the burning of mail-coaches as a signal. In Kildare and Meath, soldiers and yeomanry were attacked, while in Dublin, citizens defended against the uprising, preventing its spread. However, Wexford faced a brutal religiously motivated rebellion. Led by Father John Murphy, rebels armed with pikes and scythes attacked militia and seized towns. The violence escalated with atrocities in Wexford and the camp at Vinegar Hill. Troops from Dublin arrived, defeating rebels at Vinegar Hill and Wexford. The rebels' brutal acts led to intense retribution, with leaders like Father John Murphy and Bagenal Harvey being captured and executed. The rebellion, though terrifying, was swiftly quelled, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake.|"['1.

In August, General Humbert landed at Killala with French troops, defeated General Lake, and moved on to Sligo. Facing Lord Cornwallis, he surrendered. Meanwhile, Wolfe Tone was captured at sea by the English. The rebellion of '98 ended with martial law and Lord Cornwallis calling for mercy. Pitt planned a legislative Union for Ireland, despite public exhaustion. The Irish Parliament lost support after the rebellion. Wolfe Tone viewed it as an obstacle to progress, while Grattan remained loyal to peaceful opposition. Tone's contempt for the Parliament reflected his desire for an independent Irish republic. Pitt's Union proposal came at a time of post-rebellion turmoil and discontent with the existing political system.|"[""1.

This passage discusses the political maneuvering behind the Union of Ireland and England. Pitt, the driving force behind the Union, believed it was essential for England's security. He used different tactics to persuade both Protestants and Catholics to support the Union. Protestants were promised protection and security from potential threats, while Catholics were enticed with the promise of Emancipation. Despite strong opposition, Pitt was determined to secure the Union, even resorting to compensating borough owners to secure their support. The controversy surrounding the Union and the methods used to ensure its passage are still debated today. The passage highlights the ethical considerations of the time and the political strategies employed to achieve Pitt's goal.|"[""1.

The entire situation surrounding the Union of Great Britain and Ireland remains shrouded in controversy, even after being public for more than eight decades. The events of that significant summer were focused on executing the Prime Minister's directives. The Lord-Lieutenant and the Chief Secretary toured Ireland personally to aid in the campaign. By the time Parliament reconvened in January, they reported success. Despite being unwell, Grattan delivered a stirring speech against the dissolution of the Parliament. The Union was eventually approved, with a vast government majority. The means by which the Union was achieved raised ethical questions. The early 19th century in Ireland saw significant changes, but the Union did not necessarily bring about unity. Daniel O'Connell emerged as a prominent leader advocating for Catholic rights, notably opposing a compromise that would have allowed external influence on the Catholic Church in Ireland.|"[""**1.

O'Connell was a powerful force in Ireland during the early 19th century. His energy and determination breathed life into a struggling movement for Catholic rights. In 1823, he led the Irish Catholic Association, sparking little initial interest. However, O'Connell's fervor was infectious, and soon the association gained support across the country. Despite facing suppression by Parliament in 1825, O'Connell quickly regrouped and continued his efforts. In 1828, he ran for a seat in Clare, rallying widespread support and ultimately winning by a significant margin. O'Connell's unwavering dedication and charismatic leadership led to the Catholic Relief Bill of 1829, granting Catholics greater rights. His impact was monumental, shaping a nation and prompting change on a national scale.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the initial reaction to O'Connell leading the Irish Catholic Association in 1823?\nA) Little interest\nB) Overwhelming support\nC) Strong opposition\nD) Indifference\nE) Mixed reactions"", ""Question 2:\nHow did O'Connell's fervor impact the Irish Catholic Association?\nA) It led to its immediate suppression\nB) It caused division within the association\nC) It sparked widespread support\nD) It resulted in a decrease in membership\nE) It had no effect on the association"", ""Question 3:\nWhat obstacle did O'Connell face from Parliament in 1825?\nA) Financial difficulties\nB) Lack of leadership\nC) Suppression\nD) Natural disasters\nE) International conflicts"", ""Question 4:\nHow did O'Connell respond to Parliament's suppression in 1825?\nA) He disbanded the Irish Catholic Association\nB) He fled the country\nC) He regrouped and continued his efforts\nD) He retired from politics\nE) He joined forces with Parliament"", ""Question 5:\nWhat was the outcome of O'Connell running for a seat in Clare in 1828?\nA) He lost by a significant margin\nB) He won by a narrow margin\nC) He withdrew from the election\nD) He faced no opposition\nE) He won by a significant margin"", ""Question 6:\nWhat major event was a result of O'Connell's unwavering dedication and charismatic leadership?\nA) The Irish Civil War\nB) The Catholic Relief Bill of 1829\nC) The Great Famine\nD) The War of Independence\nE) The Protestant Ascendancy""]"|['A) Little interest', 'C) It sparked widespread support', 'C) Suppression', 'C) He regrouped and continued his efforts', 'E) He won by a significant margin', 'B) The Catholic Relief Bill of 1829']
Two important impacts of O'Connell's actions on Ireland's future are worth noting. Firstly, he introduced priests into politics, intensifying the religious aspect of the struggle due to past oppression under the penal code. Secondly, O'Connell severed the feudal ties towards English landlords, uniting the dependants against the upper classes. Despite Ireland's miserable state with tithe wars and secret societies, O'Connell vehemently opposed such underground groups. His efforts for Repeal faced government opposition, leading to the tithe struggle's resolution in 1838. With Repeal as his sole focus, O'Connell organized massive meetings, culminating in the historic Tara Hill gathering. However, the tension escalated, and the Clontarf meeting's prohibition by the Government on October 5th almost resulted in violent clashes, showcasing the challenges O'Connell faced in leading Ireland.|"[""1.

"The trial and imprisonment of Daniel O'Connell marked a significant event. A Dublin jury found him guilty, sentencing him to two years in prison. Despite his pleas for peace, the people obeyed. The biased jury led to an appeal to the House of Lords, where the sentence was initially expected to stand due to strong opposition. However, the House of Lords reversed the sentence, setting O'Connell free. His time in prison was described as light and even ironic by Mitchell. His release sparked wild enthusiasm, yet his power dwindled. The emergence of the ""Young Ireland"" party, once his allies, now in opposition, signaled the end of his influence. O'Connell's deep concern for Ireland's plight during the devastating seasons of 1846 added to his despondency. Eventually, he left for Rome, making a final plea for his suffering countrymen before passing away in Genoa."|"[""1.

Before the situation escalated, the younger faction of the camp gained strength when Smith O'Brien joined them. Despite not being highly intellectual, O'Brien held significant influence in Ireland due to his age, status as a county member, and claimed descent from Brian Boroimhe. Initially, the group, including O'Brien, avoided resorting to violence, focusing on constitutional means. However, when summoned to a railway committee, O'Brien's refusal led to his imprisonment in what some cruelly called the coal-hole. His imprisonment sparked outrage, especially with the looming famine crisis. The death of O'Connell in 1847 triggered a massive outpouring of love and reverence for him, leading to a backlash against those who opposed him, particularly the Young Ireland party. The death of O'Connell shifted leadership dynamics, with his son John emerging as the new leader, causing further division within the Repeal Association. The movement took a more radical turn with figures like James Lalor and John Mitchell advocating for more aggressive actions against the English presence in Ireland. Mitchell's arrest followed the publication of provocative articles, coinciding with the revolutionary spirit of '48 across Europe.|"[""1.

During the Irish Famine, many lives were lost, but surprisingly, some were saved due to the resilience built from enduring hardship. Despite efforts to provide relief, preventatives often arrived too late or were ineffective. Individual acts of charity and government aid were insufficient, leading to a devastating epidemic that claimed hundreds of thousands of lives. The Relief Act of 1849 established soup kitchens, but many selfless volunteers succumbed to the same fate as those they helped. The aftermath saw ruin and a loss of distinction between rich and poor, with many once well-off individuals needing assistance. The disaster left lasting scars, changing the fabric of Irish society permanently. The memory of the famine remains a bitter legacy, impacting generations to come.|['1.

"In the past forty years, Ireland faced challenges even after the famine ended. Although nearly a million people had left the country, life for those who stayed was still difficult. The Encumbered Estates Act hurt both older landowners and tenants. In 1850, efforts were made to unite North and South, leading to the Tenant League Conference in Dublin. This league, including remnants of the ""Young Ireland"" party, aimed to champion Catholicism. However, scandals involving the Sadleir brothers and others led to their downfall. Secret groups like the Phoenix organization emerged, with Fenian activities escalating in 1866 and 1867, including a failed rising in Ireland and a raid into Canada.

In 1868, the Liberal party, led by Mr. Gladstone, came to power after the General Election. The session of 1869 saw the introduction of a Bill for the Disestablishment of the Irish Church. The controversies surrounding the measure have faded, as it neither met the grand hopes of its supporters nor the dire predictions of its opponents. The Roman Catholics of Ireland, after the tithe issue settlement, were minimally affected by the change. The Irish State Church's position was challenging to defend, similar arguments favoring the Church of England but working against its Irish counterpart. The Irish Land Act of 1870, introduced by Mr. Gladstone, aimed to regulate landlord-tenant transactions and establish peasant proprietorship. Despite efforts to address the complex issue, the Act failed to satisfy either party involved. Subsequent measures like the Irish Education Act faced similar challenges. In 1880, the Liberal party regained power, passing significant Irish legislation in 1881, including the Protection of Life and Property Bill and a new Irish Land Act.|['1.

"The Act of 1870 laid the groundwork for significant changes in land ownership in Ireland. The Act that followed, based on new principles, introduced the ""three Fs"": Fixity of Tenure, Fair Rent determined by a Land Court, and Free Sale. While intended to benefit occupiers, it led to fierce competition for land. The Act reduced landowners to mere rent chargers, diminishing their control and incentive to invest. The situation escalated with the arrest of key Land League members in 1881, followed by a tragic event in the Phoenix Park. Investigations led to the capture and punishment of those responsible. The struggle in Ireland revolved around agrarian issues, particularly rent disputes. The looming question of Home Rule also stirred political turmoil, culminating in a failed attempt in 1886."|"['1.
