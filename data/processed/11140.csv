Rollo decided to read more, even though he was tired, to show his mother he was sorry for his mistake. As he read, time flew by, and his mother praised his good attitude. She gave him a gift, and Rollo headed down the lane to a field. He followed a path to the edge of the woods and heard Jonas chopping trees. Rollo watched as a tree fell across the brook, creating a bridge. He and Jonas then planned to build a wigwam near the brook. Jonas helped Rollo cross the bridge safely to retrieve his hatchet and a parcel from his mother. They marked out the spot for the wigwam, and Jonas showed Rollo how to make it round using a marker tied to a stake.|"[""1.

Jonas and Rollo were busy constructing a wigwam when they heard a voice calling Rollo. They rushed out and met James, who attempted to remove an eagle from a coin with a pin. Despite their efforts, the eagle wouldn't budge. They showed their work to Jonas, who chuckled at their attempts. The boys returned to their wigwam, where they continued building and enjoyed a picnic. Later, Jonas intervened in a quarrel between the boys, pointing out that both were at fault. James had no right to take over Rollo's project, and Rollo should have been more accommodating to his cousin. The boys felt guilty but weren't remorseful. Jonas advised them on their behavior and urged them to resolve their conflict amicably.|"['1.

Jonas, the wise elder, settled a dispute between the boys. Though James was upset when Rollo outreached him, they both quarreled over a missing half dollar. Jonas, noticing their ill-humor, remained focused on his work. When James cried out from a stone hitting him, Jonas didn't rush to help, knowing it was vexation, not pain. The boys suspected each other of taking the missing coin. Jonas cleverly used a sticky gum to retrieve the coin from the water, resolving the conflict. In the end, the boys learned the value of patience and honesty.|['1.

Two boys, Rollo and James, worked together to build a wigwam in the woods near a brook. They collected branches and wove them to create the structure. While working harmoniously, they spotted a squirrel climbing a raspberry bush. Jonas, who was nearby, heard their excitement. They decided to set a trap to catch the squirrel. Jonas warned them that squirrels are not meant for cages. The boys set a box trap, which they called the steeple trap, hoping to catch the squirrel. The next day, James asked Jonas to check if they caught the squirrel. Jonas, a reliable and obedient boy, borrowed a spy-glass to observe the trap from afar. While waiting, Rollo built a miniature Rome in the garden, complete with aqueducts. James returned with the spy-glass, and they asked Jonas to check the trap again.|['1.

Jonas and the boys thought they had caught the squirrel in the trap, but the little creature managed to escape. Jonas then devised a plan to create a temporary cage using an old fire-fender and a small box. The boys were eager to see the squirrel up close. When the squirrel was lured into the box, Jonas secured it with the makeshift cage. However, the clever squirrel found a way to squeeze out and dart away. The boys tried to catch him but failed. The squirrel ran along beams, up posts, and finally disappeared through an open window. Despite their efforts, the boys couldn't catch him again. Jonas decided to set the trap once more to capture the elusive squirrel. After a few days, the squirrel was caught again, much to the boys' delight. They marveled at the squirrel's beauty and colors, and they promised to care for him well.|"[""1.

After spending a day or two with the little squirrel, James and Rollo decided it was best to return him to his raspberry bush. However, they agreed to give him a name and visit him occasionally with corn for food. To make sure they could recognize him, Rollo suggested tying a string around the squirrel's neck as a collar. Jonas, a clever boy, offered to dye the squirrel's tail blue using a dye he had made from vinegar and old nails. They took the squirrel and the dye down to the edge of the woods, where Jonas prepared to dye the squirrel's tail and ears. However, the squirrel bit Jonas's thumb when he tried to dip its ears, causing a comical mishap with blue dye splattering everywhere. Despite the chaos, they all ended up laughing, and the squirrel ran off into the woods. Jonas's bite turned out to be minor, and they all walked back home, leaving the squirrel to continue preparing for winter.|"['1.

In the autumn, Rollo and his cousins, James and Lucy, helped Jonas pile up bushes for a bonfire. They carefully arranged solid sticks and dry logs at the bottom and covered them with brush to create a big blaze. Rollo and James made their pile near the brook, between a tree bridge and an old wigwam. They used birch bark to start the fire. Excited for the bonfires, they brought potatoes and apples to roast. As twilight approached, they saw Rollo's parents arrive. Jonas lit the fires with birch bark, and the flames danced brightly. The children used torches made by Jonas to light their fires safely.

"The kids took their torches and tried to light them using birch bark. Lucy's torch caught fire, but Rollo's and James's did not. They ended up smothering the flames instead of lighting them. Lucy helped by offering her torch to light theirs. Together, they lit up the forest by waving the torches over piles of wood. The bright blaze illuminated the area, creating a mesmerizing scene. As they watched the flames, they felt admiration and awe. They poked the embers to make them burn brighter and enjoyed playing with a ""steam-boat on fire"" that floated down the brook.

It was decided. They lit torches, paraded to the wigwam, and encircled it, singing and cheering as they ignited it. The flames swiftly spread, leaving only charred remains. The children crossed a bridge homeward, passing smoldering embers and burning logs. That night, Rollo observed the lingering glow and rising smoke from the fires in the woods. The next day, Rollo's family planned a blueberry picking trip to Benalgon Mountain, known for bears and berries, though no bears were present. Rollo prepared his basket and removed heavy items from his pockets, fearing bears. He entrusted his belongings to Jonas, avoiding revealing his true apprehension. Despite a failed request to his father, Rollo's mother kindly advised him on a more sensible approach. Later, Rollo attempted to feed a bird but inadvertently scared it away. His father, after a brief conversation, bid him goodnight, and Rollo drifted off to sleep, gazing at the moon.|['1.

The next morning, Rollo woke up early and was delighted to see the sun shining through the windows. He eagerly got ready, planning to tell his father about the beautiful day. However, he noticed dark clouds covering the sky, dimming the sunlight. Rollo's father suspected rain, but Rollo insisted it would be pleasant. Despite Rollo's hopes, the rain started. Uncle George and cousin Lucy arrived, confirming the bad weather. Rollo's ill-humor grew as the excursion was postponed. His father scolded him for being self-conceited, ungrateful, and selfish.

Rollo's father gently instructed him to go to the small back garret when he was being sullen. The garret was a cozy place with a rocking chair, a table with a Bible, and some old maps. It was meant for Rollo to reflect on his behavior in solitude. Rollo obeyed his father and went up the narrow stairs to the garret. As he sat there, a drop of water fell on his neck, causing him to initially feel more irritated. However, he soon realized the rain was beneficial to the garden. This made him think about his selfishness. Looking at the garden, he began to feel genuinely sorry for his behavior. He read a passage from the Bible, which led him to decide to confess his fault to his father. Later, Rollo and his sister Lucy followed their mother's advice to focus on a duty or reading a book when disappointed, which brought peace and satisfaction to their minds.|"[""1.

At first, they found it challenging to sit down and read because they were supposed to be picking blueberries on the mountain. Rollo mentioned that by now, they would have been near the mountain's foot. He also pointed out a pond outside with bubbles, excited to sail boats there after the rain. Rollo described making paper and pea boats from pea pods. Wanting to go out, they asked Rollo's mother. She allowed Rollo to go out barefoot after the rain and instructed him to wash his feet thoroughly upon returning. Rollo shared this with Lucy, and they decided to read until the rain stopped. Rollo realized they weren't reading well and suggested their mother read to them. His mother emphasized reading as a lesson, not just for fun. The children returned to read carefully, turning the reading session into an enjoyable learning experience.|"['1.

Rollo and his cousin Lucy started reading a story together on a rainy day when their mountain trip got canceled. The tale began with Maria Wilton, who lives in a lovely white house near the woods where they pick blackberries. Despite not being grand, the house's neat appearance and charming garden make it inviting. Maria's family lives in harmony, thanks to her kind and yielding ways with her siblings. Her influence keeps peace at home, and her siblings rarely argue over privileges. Maria's father occasionally takes a child to the city in a chaise for business, and they all look forward to this outing. When Maria was to go, an animal exhibition was closing, making her excited. Despite her brother George's initial reluctance, Maria selflessly offered him her turn when her mother needed her help with their baby brother. Maria's cousin Ellen invited her to pick berries, but she had to stay back to care for the restless baby, showing her patience and love for her family.|"[""1.

Maria showed great patience and good humor while staying at home with her brother Willy, even though she had to miss out on a berry-picking trip with her friends. The girls decided to bring Maria some of their berries on their way back as a kind gesture. This thoughtful act made Maria feel appreciated and compensated for missing the outing. Her selfless behavior was rewarded when her father surprised her with a beautiful new book as a token of appreciation for her kindness towards her siblings.

Rollo and Lucy were sharing a pear and an apple when a dispute arose. Rollo implied that the choice should be left to chance, but Lucy insisted on her preference. Their guardian intervened, explaining that Rollo should have given the pear to Lucy as a gesture of hospitality. The children then went outside to play with their boats in a milk-pan pond. Rollo cut pieces of fruit for cargo, and they enjoyed a pleasant time until dinner. Afterward, they admired the rain and the prospect of a freshet. Rollo assured Lucy that his father would find a way for her to see it safely. They both looked forward to the adventure, excited by the idea of exploring the rain-swollen brook.|['1.

Rollo and Lucy were busy organizing Rollo's room when they noticed the rain had stopped. They saw a beautiful sky with golden rays breaking through the clouds. Excited by the sight, they went outside to admire the view. Rollo's father explained that the brook would continue to rise for a few more hours due to water coming from the hills. Despite the rain, the sun's rays made everything look stunning. Rollo and Lucy were captivated by the beauty of the sky and surroundings.

Rollo and Lucy were eager to explore the freshet. Lucy lacked suitable boots for the wet and muddy terrain. Their father devised a plan using Jonas' wagon to keep Lucy dry. As they journeyed, they encountered a pool blocking their path. Jonas waded through, pulling the wagon behind him. Lucy felt apprehensive but trusted her uncle's judgment. Rollo discovered raindrops falling from the trees, causing a comical mishap that made everyone laugh. Finally, they reached the foaming brook, where Jonas found a plank for Lucy to stand on. With the plank safely in place, Lucy launched pea-pod boats into the turbulent waters. The adventure continued as they explored the beautiful evening and enjoyed the wonders of nature.|"['1.

The group embarked on a blueberry-picking adventure. Rollo, his family, and Jonas set out early, well-prepared for the day. Old Trumpeter was ready to carry them through the woods. They enjoyed a scenic drive until they reached the mountain. Rollo spotted a blueberry bush and shared the ripe berries with Lucy. They learned they were near Benalgon Mountain. As they continued, Jonas suggested a shortcut on horseback. The chaises moved ahead as Rollo and Jonas took the forest path. Rollo felt a pang of guilt for leaving Lucy, but soon got lost in the beauty of the woods. The forest echoed with the sounds of nature, creating a sense of peaceful solitude.|['1.

The boys continued their journey on a slippery, stony, and steep path. Rollo felt afraid and wanted to turn back but hesitated. As they progressed, the road became muddier, causing Old Trumpeter to struggle. Rollo regretted not following his father's advice. They encountered a waterlogged section, and Jonas guided the horse through the trees to avoid the deep water. Rollo questioned why this path stayed wetter than the main road, learning about sunlight and wind's drying effects. Approaching a brook, Jonas asked Rollo to hold on while he rode through the water to check its depth. After ensuring safety, Rollo joined Jonas on the horse, successfully crossing the brook. Jonas explained the importance of not causing worry by deviating from their original plan. They continued their journey, overcoming obstacles until they reached the shore safely.|"['1.

Jonas dismounted from the horse, passed the reins to Rollo, and picked up a long stick from the ground. With great care, he gently brought the nest closer to the shore. Inside the nest was a young bird, barely feathered. Jonas identified it as a robin, likely displaced by the brook's rising water. The nest was damp, indicating it had been afloat for some time. The bird, hungry and mistaking the boys for its mother, opened its beak expectantly. They decided to take the nest to the mill to show Rollo's father. To transport it safely, Jonas used his cap as a makeshift carrier on the saddle. They rode carefully towards the mill. Upon arrival, they shared the rescue story with a group waiting in chaises, including Lucy, who was particularly delighted. Jonas fed the bird with berries and then placed it back in the nest, which Lucy held in her lap. The group then continued their journey on foot up the mountain.|"['1.

Uncle George finished securing his horse and joined the children. Hearing their confusion over a name, he suggested calling him Noah, like the biblical figure saved from a flood. The kids liked the idea but decided to hide Noah, or Mosette, before heading to the mountain. They found a secret spot by a rock, concealing the bird. As they walked, Jonas shared a story, but Rollo’s father signaled to stop. They continued, following Jonas on a rocky path, passing blueberry bushes and encountering boys ahead. Rollo’s father redirected them around a precipice. Despite a minor conflict with other boys, the day went well until they noticed Jonas missing. After some time, Jonas reappeared, announcing everything was ready. They gathered berries and prepared to leave, curious about Jonas’s mysterious activities.|['1.

"The group carried heavy baskets and pails as they walked towards Jonas' place. Rollo's Hither led the way through a thicket and onto a mountain brow. From there, they admired the vast landscape below, with forests, rivers, villages, and farms. On the other side, a rocky precipice rose abruptly, leading to the mountain's summit. They followed a smooth rock path, passing grass patches and blueberry bushes until they reached a brook cascading down the mountain. Crossing the brook, they found a bower built by Jonas with logs and stones, offering a rustic dinner. The day passed pleasantly, and as they descended the mountain, some unexpected events occurred, which will be shared in the story ""Trouble on the Mountain."""|"[""**1.

By now, the other two boys approached and chatted with Rollo, trying to convince him to join them. Rollo decided to seek his father's permission first. After consulting his father and hearing that the boys were not suitable companions due to their use of foul language, Rollo hesitated but was lured by the boys' stories. Despite feeling guilty, Rollo continued to listen to their tales, gradually moving away from his family. As he collected blueberries, the boys' behavior worsened, culminating in Jim destroying Rollo's berries and assaulting him. Rollo's cries for help went unanswered until his father and Jonas arrived, but the boys had already fled.

Rollo's father lifted him up and carried him away, noticing the distress caused by the bad boys. Rollo sobbed on his father's shoulder, overwhelmed with pain and fear. Understanding Rollo's need to cry, his father didn't command him to be quiet. As Rollo calmed down, his father advised him not to dwell on the trouble caused by his own actions.

Lucy assisted Rollo in filling his basket with berries. Rollo, proud and stubborn, showed Lucy where the thickest berries grew and a beautiful wild flower he found.
