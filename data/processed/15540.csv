"The first time you asked me all right, and I should have answered you if I had not felt obliged to switch off and inform you and Miss Woolridge of my new appointment.

""You will find that the bulletin signed by the first officer gives the run as 330 miles; but the answer to your second question is 337 miles, about,"" added the third officer. ""Just here the day is only twenty-three hours and forty minutes long as we are running; and the faster we go the shorter the day,"" continued the speaker, who was ciphering all the time on a card. ""I doubt if I could do it, and I should be glad to listen to the explanation,"" replied Louis, as they descended to the main cabin; for the new third officer was permitted to retain his place at the table as well as his state-room. The commander had suggested that there was likely to be some change of cabin arrangements; for it was not in accordance with his ideas of right that the third officer should be admitted to the table, while the first and second were excluded; and Louis was very desirous that his friend Scott should remain in the cabin.

In the afternoon, the young officer explained how time changes when sailing east or west. He mentioned that for every degree of longitude sailed, there is a four-minute difference in clock time. By using a chronometer, sailors can accurately tell the time. The ship encountered rough seas due to the north-east monsoons prevailing at that time. The commander, expecting a smooth voyage, was surprised by the sudden gale from the south-southwest. As the storm intensified, the commander and Scott studied the map to assess their course. Scott, feeling hesitant, asked about a reference book. The commander, visibly perturbed by the unexpected weather, invited Scott to join him in his cabin to consult the chart and the accompanying blue book for navigation guidance.|"['1.

The captain and the young officer discussed a chart from the Cape of Good Hope. The captain lacked the blue book that came with it, which focused on weather and currents. Scott proposed to read from the book, which the captain allowed. The chart and book detailed the weather near Kuriyan Muriyan Bay. The captain praised Scott's preparation for the voyage.

Mr. Scott and the commander were on the ship during a storm near Kuria Muria Bay. Scott checked the compass and saw the ship was on course despite the rough seas. Suddenly, a lookout shouted from the foretop about a distant vessel. Scott heard what sounded like gunshots and cries for help. As the light increased, they spotted men clinging to a wreck nearby. The ship, the Guardian-Mother, had been at sea for over a year, owned by Louis Belgrave, a young man from New Jersey. Louis inherited his fortune from his father, a war veteran. Louis's father had hidden his wealth, which was never found. Louis's mother, Maud, remarried a man named Wade Farrongate.

Louis Belgrave found himself in a bitter feud with his stepfather, Farrongate, a cunning jockey with ill intentions. Louis uncovered Farrongate's plan to steal race winnings and flee with Louis's mother. With bravery and evidence in hand, Louis thwarted the plan, exposing Farrongate's treachery. As Louis's fortune grew from discovering his grandfather's missing million, the need arose to rescue his mother, leading to the acquisition of a grand steam-yacht, the Guardian-Mother. The vessel, under the guidance of Captain Ringgold, embarked on a global voyage to seek out Louis's mother and uncover the truth behind Farrongate's schemes.

"Officers came to Cuba to arrest him for his crimes at the races, and he was sent to the scene of his villany, where the court sentenced him to Sing Sing for a long term. The court in Cuba decreed that his yacht belonged to his wife; and her new owner, at the suggestion of the commander of the Guardian-Mother, made Penn Sharp, to whom she was largely indebted for the fortune to which she had succeeded, the captain of her. The steam-yacht was the Viking, and Mrs. Scoble sailed in her to New York, and then to England, where she obtained a divorce from her recreant husband, and became the wife of Captain Sharp, who was now in command of the Blanche, the white steamer that sailed abreast of the Guardian-Mother when the wreck in the Arabian Sea was discovered. From a sailing-yacht sunk in a squall in the harbor of New York, the crew of the steamer had saved two gentlemen. One was a celebrated physician and surgeon, suffering from overwork, Dr. Philip Hawkes. He was induced to accept the commander's offer of a passage around the world for his services as the surgeon of the ship.

The leader quickly retreated, and the ship Fatimé pursued them to Gibraltar. The Pacha, wanting to meet Captain Ringgold, was denied access as his bad reputation preceded him. The Pacha then physically attacked the commander on the street but was swiftly subdued by the captain. Ali-Noury was fined for the assault and sought revenge by following the Guardian-Mother to Constantinople. Captain Sharp, cruising in the Viking, saved the wounded Pacha from robbers and they became close friends. The Pacha repented, and Captain Sharp believed in his reformation. The Pacha sold his ship to Captain Sharp and settled his accounts with Captain Mazagan. The Guardian-Mother and the Blanche discovered a wreck with stranded individuals, prompting immediate action to rescue them in the stormy seas.|"['1.

The ship changed course, causing the propeller to lift out of the water and then bury deep, making the ship shake. Louis and Felix came on deck, and Felix jokingly asked if they were trying to shake the screw loose. The crew gathered on the deck as the wreck came into view. The first cutter was prepared with Mr. Boulong and his crew. The captain observed the crew on the wreck, ready to assist. The second cutter was also readied. The ship maintained speed while the crew prepared to rescue the people on the wreck. The captain instructed the crew to be cautious with the rudder in the storm. The ship was positioned to lower the boats safely. The first cutter was lowered skillfully by Mr. Boulong.|['1.

A retreating wave gently moved the boat away from the ship, just as Mr. Boulong had predicted. The six oars plunged into the water simultaneously, and the men started rowing, taking advantage of the receding wave to steer the cutter to safety. Once clear, the commander signaled to move forward. The steamer picked up speed before being carefully turned around. The second cutter positioned itself on the ship's port side, sheltered from the wind. Despite being only eighteen, Scott was a skilled sailor with a natural talent, guiding the boat expertly. The crew rowed skillfully, riding the waves smoothly. Mr. Gaskette, observing the successful maneuvers, headed to the captain to report. The men in the water struggled, but the cutters were their only hope, slowly making their way to the wreck site. Captain Ringgold remained composed, assessing the situation as the crew battled the waves.|"['1.

Captain Ringgold watched the boats carefully as they neared the men in the water. The Blanche turned around, and the second boat followed. The crews seemed to compete in their efforts, rowing with all their might. Despite their efforts, no boat gained an advantage, and they all worked hard to rescue the scattered men in the rough waves. Mr. Boulong noticed a man in distress at the edge of the group. The man, a European, remained composed despite the danger. He pointed out another struggling person to the crew, who quickly moved to assist. The crew managed to rescue the first man, who was nearly exhausted, from the raging sea. The second boat arrived, and Scott, the leader, was puzzled why the first officer had prioritized one man over another. The rescued man was a Hindu, and Mr. Boulong worked to help him recover from his ordeal.|"['1.

"""Dr. Ferrolan!"" he exclaimed. ""Oh, save him!"" He pointed to him as the stern of the boat rose on a billow; and he proved to be the person towards whom the cockswain was steering the boat. ""Where is Lord Tremlyn?"" he asked, as he surveyed the surrounding waters. ""There!"" he screamed wildly, as he pointed over the stern, where the person indicated was swimming for the first cutter. As he spoke, a booming billow struck Lord Tremlyn, as the Hindu had revealed his name, just as Scott was running his boat up to take him on board.

A ready seaman seized him by the arm, and, with the aid of another, hauled him into the boat, where he was passed into the stern-sheets.

Mr. Sage suggested setting up two tables to accommodate the large group, reminiscent of a past dinner at Aden. The commander, acting swiftly, created a seating plan for the guests, leaving three spots empty. The new arrangement was approved by Louis and Mrs. Belgrave. The chief steward labeled each seat, and the crew worked on adjusting the chairs. Passengers were curious about three distinguished strangers who had been rescued.

"The Woolridge family members were introduced to the trio, who were impressed by their beauty. The ""live lord"" was 28, Sir Modava 30, and Dr. Ferrolan 46.

Yesterday, we faced an unusual gale from the southwest while sailing on the Travancore, a sturdy boat. Things went smoothly until a steamer collided with us in the early morning mist, causing damage to its side and leading to water filling in. We quickly put on life-preservers and secured ourselves with a life-line as the situation turned dire. Eventually, the steamer capsized, but we managed to stay afloat by clinging to the life-line. Despite expecting the vessel to sink, it surprisingly stayed afloat for hours until the Guardian-mother ship rescued us. We were shaken but grateful to be saved. The captain and crew of the Guardian-mother are praised for their gallant rescue. The log-book revealed a passing steamer to the north, possibly the one that collided with us. The viscount, who was in the pilot-house, barely saw the vessel due to the thick weather. The commander speculated on the other ship's behavior, deeming it unhelpful. The viscount shared his efforts to prevent the Travancore from sinking, using an awning to cover the hull's breach. Despite his doubts, he had done everything possible in the situation. The chief engineer of the Travancore commended everyone's efforts and expressed gratitude for their survival.|"['1.

The story of the Travancore shipwreck was fully detailed, with discussions continuing until lunch. At the midday meal, the captain changed the seating plan, allowing everyone to choose their spots. The rough sea calmed in the afternoon, making the cruise pleasant. The group gathered in the music room after a deck stroll. Sacred hymns filled the room, and notable guests sang. Dr. Ferrolan's bass voice resonated beautifully. The evening featured more music and speeches, with Sir Modava leading a favorite hymn.

India, extending about 1,900 miles north to south and 1,600 miles east to west, is bounded by the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, Himalaya Mountains, and neighboring countries like China, Thibet, and Turkestan. The Himalayas, with peaks like Mount Everest, are a source of major rivers like the Ganges. India's rich fertility supports a diverse range of vegetation, from tropical to temperate zones.

The Ganges Canal, built in 1854, spans 445 miles, serving both navigation and irrigation purposes. It is a waterway you may explore to learn more. Near the Indus lie two deserts, one 500 miles long and the other 400, where grains can thrive in valleys with artificial irrigation. In ancient times, gold mines were active in the southwest, with currency in gold. India experiences three distinct seasons: cool, hot, and rainy. Winter is the most pleasant, while autumn is hot and humid. Monsoon winds bring rain, vital for agriculture, although when they fail, famines can occur. The temperatures vary across India, with elevation affecting the climate. Rainfall ranges from over 75 inches in the northeast to as little as 15 inches along the southern Indus shores.|['1.

Thank you for your attention. The native horse breeds have been improved by Britons who love horses, but they are not used for farming. Ponies, donkeys, and mules are used instead. Sheep, goats, and hogs are plentiful, but some people, like certain middle-class individuals, consider pigs unclean. Monkeys are both mischievous and tame, likely due to being seen as sacred. The real excitement in the animal kingdom comes from wild creatures like tigers, panthers, cheetahs, boars, bears, elephants, and rhinoceroses. Crocodiles are present in rivers, posing a danger. Deer provide food for carnivores like lions, hyenas, lynxes, and wolves. Fishing is excellent in coastal towns, but fish in warm, flat waters are not tasty. The day continued with recreation on the ship, with different passengers engaging in various activities. At half-past three, a meeting was called in the Conference Hall, and Dr. Ferrolan was invited to speak.|['1.

The topic of cobras is vast and fascinating. Cobras, often seen with snake-charmers in cities, can grow up to five feet long. Their fangs, located in the upper jaw, contain a groove that allows the deadly poison to flow. A cobra's bite can be fatal without quick treatment, but modern science has developed effective antidotes. The color of cobras ranges from pale yellow to dark olive, with some having a distinctive hood pattern resembling spectacles. A mongoose, a skilled cobra-killer, can swiftly eliminate these dangerous snakes. In India, cobras are known to hide in gardens, preying on domestic fowls. The Blanche ship's actions, firing guns rapidly, puzzled observers on the Guardian-Mother vessel.|"[""1.

The Aryans, who migrated from Europe and Asia, considered themselves superior upon settling in India, calling themselves the twice-born. They believed in a second spiritual birth marked by a sacred cord received at a specific age. The natives were deemed once-born. Over time, the twice-born divided into Brahmins (priests), Kshatriyas (warriors), and Vaisyas (farmers), while the once-born were Sudras. These divisions formed the basis of the caste system, detailed in the laws of Manu. The Brahmins acted as religious leaders, the Kshatriyas upheld the state, and the Vaisyas focused on agriculture and trade. The Sudras served the other classes. Inter-caste marriages led to mixed classes, with the lowest being offspring of Brahmin mothers and Sudra fathers. India, predominantly Hindu, also has Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Jains, and Parsees. Caste distinctions extend to various occupations, with some classes displaying rigid social hierarchies.|['1.

The barrier to Christianity's progress includes challenges like the belief that a Christian convert can't return to their caste if they stray. Despite this, Christianity perseveres. Caste no longer dictates one's career, except for Brahmins. Even they serve in various roles. Men from all castes reach high positions, akin to how commoners in England can rise. Loss of caste, once feared, is now less significant. Mohammedans, mainly in Bengal and Bombay, are either emigrants or Hindu converts to Islam. Parsees in Bombay are educated fire-worshippers following Zoroaster's teachings. They fled Persia due to religious persecution, and today, they are respected for their honesty and success. Parsees don't eat food cooked by people of other religions, avoid beef and pork, and have unique funeral practices. Despite their reverence for fire, they don't smoke.|"[""1.

The civil service in India is mostly managed by Europeans, but natives can also hold positions as employees. The system of appointing officials in England is followed, with candidates undergoing regular examinations. The military force in India transitioned from the East India Company to the British crown, with a total army strength of 218,786. The navy of the East India Company was replaced by the royal navy in 1863. Laws and institutions in India are governed by Parliament, with a similar justice system to the United Kingdom. Educational institutions are advancing, with 400 newspapers published in various languages. Efforts are made to combat famine through irrigation projects, and a famine relief fund has been set up. Emigration is encouraged due to the high population density. The currency in India is based on the silver rupee, with a fluctuating value against gold.|['1.

In India, there is a government paper currency worth £16,000,000 sterling in circulation. The smallest copper coin is the _pie_, equal to half a farthing or a quarter of a cent. Three _pies_ make a _pice_, equal to a farthing and a half or three-quarters of a cent. Four _pices_ make an _anna_, which is a penny and a half or three cents. Sixteen _annas_ make a _rupee_, and sixteen _rupees_ make a gold _mohur_. These smaller coins are commonly used among the natives and even by thrifty Englishmen. India has a public debt of about £200,000,000 for various purposes like railways and war. The revenue last year was £84,932,100, and expenditures were £84,661,700. Wages have increased under British rule, with the best laborers earning four _annas_ a day and others earning two _annas_, which is six to twelve cents a day. Food costs a penny for two pounds, and clothing for the poor is meager and inexpensive. Fuel is cheap, and rent for dwellings is minimal. The masses in the country live on the land as owners or lessees. The history of India involves Portuguese and English explorers, with the English forming settlements like Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta.

During the Indian Mutiny in 1857, Sepoys, native soldiers in Bengal, rebelled against British rule. The mutiny spread over a vast area, with 90,000 rebellious soldiers armed with European artillery and muskets. They held forts, arsenals, and treasuries, isolating British troops in various locations. The situation seemed dire, with fears that the entire country could be engulfed in rebellion. However, hope emerged with the arrival of British reinforcements, like Henry Havelock, who displayed exemplary leadership. The mutiny, which covered 100,000 square miles and involved 40 million people, posed a significant threat to the British Empire in India. If not swiftly suppressed, it could have led to widespread chaos and further challenges for British control in the region.|"['1.

Havelock, born in 1795, came from a family of merchants and received a good education. Initially meant for a legal career, he joined the army after the battle of Waterloo, following his brother's path. In 1823, he traveled to India, where he embraced Christianity, shaping his life. Serving in the Afghan and Sikh wars, he remained a lieutenant for over two decades. Leading an army division into Persia in 1856, he rushed to Calcutta during the Indian mutiny. Havelock's forces advanced from Allahabad to Cawnpore, overcoming rebels along the way. Nana Sahib, a key figure in the mutiny, incited brutal acts, including the massacre of women and children.

Bombay, now known as Mumbai, has had its share of ups and downs. Back during the Civil War, Europe faced a cotton shortage, which oddly led to Bombay's peak of prosperity. Speculation ran wild, with hopes of Bombay becoming the top cotton market globally. However, when General Lee surrendered, ending the war in America, the bubble of prosperity burst. New banks were established, and merchants dove headfirst into risky speculation. But as news of the war's end spread, the city's commercial success crumbled. Lessons were learned, and Bombay slowly recovered its wealth and population. This historical event, which occurred over 180 years ago, serves as a cautionary tale against reckless financial ventures.|"[""1.

"Captain Ringgold was introduced to Pallonjee Pestonjee, the owner of the Victoria Hotel.

Merchants from various countries were busy noting down prices in the bustling bazaar, while Parsees and other traders mingled in the crowd. Nearby, the grand mosque of the Mohammedans stood, though it paled in comparison to those in Turkey, Egypt, and Algeria.

Breach Candy, a posh neighborhood on the seashore near Cumballa Hill, boasts grand mansions. Tramways, similar to horse-cars, connect this area to the city.

After exploring a dense thicket, the tourists found a beautiful set of stairs cut from solid rock on a hill. The stairs led to a large chamber that served as a Hindu temple.

In India, before the time of Christ, the custom of 'suttee' required a faithful wife to burn herself on her deceased husband's funeral pyre. The British government, under Lord William Cavendish in 1828, passed a law to abolish this practice, which was met with opposition. This custom was based on the belief that the wife was needed by her husband in the afterlife. The Hindus thought this was necessary for the husband's well-being. The law led to a decrease in the number of such incidents. Despite occasional instances, the practice has been discontinued. Lord Tremlyn attended a unique theatrical performance at a private house, where a Brahmin invoked the god Ganesa for wisdom before a play on the loves of the god Krishna unfolded.|"[""1.

A man mentioned that the Christian population in India had doubled in a decade. He invited the group to his church, and the boys rushed back to inform their friends. They all attended the service, led by a Brahmin clergyman who delivered a moving sermon. The mission funds received a significant boost from their visit. Later that evening, they were invited to the Church of England by Lord Tremlyn, where the Bishop of Bombay preached. The Methodists were impressed by the sermon. The next day, they rose early, went for a walk, and gathered in the parlor. The sights in the streets were becoming familiar. Professor Giroud shared his views on Hindu mythology, and the group discussed their experiences in Bombay. They were preparing to leave for Colombo, reflecting on the diverse encounters they had in India.|"['1.

Uncle Moses, seated comfortably, inquired about Juggernaut, a Hindu idol, that he had read about in Sabbath-school books. Sir Modava explained that the stories were exaggerated. Juggernaut, located in Orissa, India, is a holy place with a temple dedicated to Vishnu. The town has a population of 22,000 and accommodates pilgrims with 6,000 lodging houses. The temple is richly ornamented, with an income of over £30,000. The car-festival is a major event, and the idols in the temple are ornate but not associated with self-immolation. Later, the company witnessed skilled Indian jugglers performing various tricks involving swords, stones, and acrobatics. Despite some performers being half-clothed, the audience marveled at their talents.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat is the main topic of the text passage?\nA) Indian Jugglers\nB) Juggernaut Temple\nC) Sabbath-school books\nD) Sir Modava's explanation\nE) Uncle Moses's inquiry"", 'Question 2:\nWhere is Juggernaut located?\nA) Mumbai, India\nB) Orissa, India\nC) Delhi, India\nD) Varanasi, India\nE) Kolkata, India', 'Question 3:\nHow many lodging houses are available for pilgrims in Juggernaut?\nA) 2,000\nB) 3,000\nC) 4,000\nD) 5,000\nE) 6,000', 'Question 4:\nWhat is the annual income of the temple in Juggernaut?\nA) £20,000\nB) £25,000\nC) £30,000\nD) £35,000\nE) £40,000', 'Question 5:\nWhat kind of event is the car-festival in Juggernaut?\nA) Religious procession\nB) Music concert\nC) Dance competition\nD) Food festival\nE) Film screening', 'Question 6:\nHow did the audience react to the Indian jugglers despite some being half-clothed?\nA) They were unimpressed\nB) They were shocked\nC) They were disappointed\nD) They marveled at their talents\nE) They booed them']"|['B) Juggernaut Temple', 'B) Orissa, India', 'E) 6,000', 'C) £30,000', 'A) Religious procession', 'D) They marveled at their talents']
The drumbeat changed, and the singer's voice dropped. The boy twisted as if in a seizure, slowly collapsing into the small basket. Mrs. Blossom doubted the basket's capacity, puzzled by the boy's vanishing act. Performers then closed the lid and thrust long knives into the basket, shocking the audience. However, they were assured it was safe. The Hindus compressed the basket until it was almost flat, seemingly impossible to hold the boy. A chant began, and a voice seemed to emerge from the basket, expanding it back to full size. The lid opened, and the boy leaped out, relieving Mrs. Blossom. The jugglers then balanced a spinning top on a stick on their nose, stopping and starting it at will, leaving spectators in awe. The group examined the stick and top but couldn't explain the trick. The jugglers received a reward and left, leaving the audience amazed.|"[""1.

Buddhism is a philosophy as well as a religion, not as widespread in India as before. It thrives in Ceylon, Napaul, Burma, and northern Asia. The religion's history is vague; some believe Gautama, the Buddha, was fictional. Others start with Prince Siddhartha, who turned ascetic due to the world's miseries. He concluded ignorance was the root of suffering and achieved wisdom. He preached his teachings in Benares, claiming to have found the cure for human misery. Buddhism teaches transmigration of souls, with believers passing into various forms after death. Buddhists don't believe in a personal God, and life is seen as a curse. The religion has similarities to Christianity, with followers praying to the deceased Buddha. Buddhism is complex, with much more to explore.|"[""1.

Sir Modava agreed with the professor, explaining that Brahma symbolizes the universal spirit in Hinduism, not a deity to be worshipped. He mentioned that there are no idols of Brahma in India, but representations with four heads exist. The passage then delves into the life of Rammohun Roy, a Hindu ruler from Bengal, born in 1772. Despite his Brahmin heritage, he questioned his faith, studied Buddhism in Thibet, and critiqued idolatry. Roy's influence led to reforms like abolishing suttee. He founded the Brahmo Samaj, a society advocating social and religious reforms. The text also touches on the intricacies of India's caste system, highlighting the social and business complications it creates. Captain Ringgold and Sir Modava discuss the pros and cons of the caste system, acknowledging its protective nature for those who adhere to its rules but condemning its rigid constraints.|['1.

"From this moment, he spoke of his respect for the captain of the Guardian-Mother, who had helped India by saving them from certain death, a deed they truly valued. Captain Ringgold and General Noury gave appropriate responses. They were then escorted by torch-bearers back to the ""Garden of Pearls,"" their summer palace. Early the next morning, after coffee, Louis and Felix took a stroll outside the palace. At the gate, they encountered a friendly animal.

The grand procession lasted over an hour, leaving the Americans in awe at the variety and magnificence of the display. Led by the Maharajah's soldiers, the sepoys under English officers marched with the precision of seasoned veterans. They were followed by imported Arab troops and a squadron of skilled Mahratta cavalry. Dromedaries carrying small cannons and the Guicowar's special army added to the impressive military parade. The highlight was the royal standard-bearer on a majestic elephant, accompanied by musicians, dignitaries on elephants, and horsemen in rich attire. The procession exuded splendor, with camels and incense-censors preceding the grand arrival of the Guicowar himself on a gigantic elephant adorned with a golden howdah and precious jewels.

In a grand hall with towering arches, noble spectators gathered to witness a fierce spectacle. Two male elephants, chained at each end of the arena, prepared for combat. Nearby, female elephants observed from an elevated platform, akin to noble ladies at medieval tournaments. Men, resembling Spanish bullfighters, armed with lances and firework sticks, readied themselves. As the Guicowar, a distinguished figure, mingled with the guests, the elephants were unleashed. The beasts clashed head-on, their trunks entwined in a fierce struggle. Eventually, one elephant emerged victorious, only to face a second challenge. Tormented by men wielding whips and banners, the defeated elephant retaliated in a futile battle. Despite the unfair torment, the elephant's fury was unmatched as it sought vengeance on its assailants, displaying its immense power and resilience.|"['1.

A thrilling scene unfolded as a young man, swift of foot, fled from an enraged elephant. Just as the beast was about to crush him, a brave horseman rode in, armed and ready to face the colossal creature. The horse and rider engaged in a daring skirmish with the elephant, the horseman skillfully avoiding danger. After a fierce battle, the elephant, exhausted, was led away to rest. The spectators, including nobles and officers, placed bets on the outcome of the encounters. Next, a monstrous tiger was released into the arena to face a bull in an unprecedented battle.

The tiger silently moved to the center, exuding regal confidence. His fiery eyes fixed on the approaching bull, a foe he had likely encountered in the wild. Without a hint of fear, the bull charged, aiming to gore the tiger. In a swift leap, the tiger evaded, but not unscathed. Bloodied, the tiger retaliated, latching onto the bull's neck. Despite being tossed, the tiger persisted until the bull's horns sealed its fate. The onlookers cheered for the victor, the bull, in a display of brutal spectacle. Disgusted by the violence, the visitors explored Baroda's temples and palaces, enjoying non-brutal amusements.

Lahore, a city of considerable importance, lacked the grand structures found in other Indian cities like Jeypore and Oodeypore. Sir Modava suggested that these cities would have been more captivating. However, before reaching Calcutta, the group would witness some of the country's finest architecture. The next day, after exploring the city, they visited the lieutenant-governor's office and the mosque of Jehanghir. The mosque of Vazir Khan, a beautiful but aging building, caught their interest. They observed the locals and visited the Golden Temple of Amritsar in the afternoon. Lahore, though not as impressive as expected, was their last stop before heading to Calcutta by train. As they left Lahore, they caught a glimpse of what they believed were the peaks of the Himalayas. Upon arriving in Delhi, the group was offered accommodations by wealthy and influential locals, except for Captain Ringgold, who preferred not to impose on others' hospitality.|"['1.

The viscount and his Hindu friend were both very considerate about their accommodations. Sir Modava suggested dividing the guests among those who had extended the invitations. However, this idea was not well-received. After some discussion, it was decided to stay at a hotel, which the commander offered to pay for. Unfortunately, there was no suitable hotel in the area, so they settled on the dak-bungalow. Despite its lack of grandeur, the rooms were cozy. The next morning, they enjoyed a good breakfast and rested. Later, they gathered in the coffee-room where Lord Tremlyn shared the history of Delhi, a city with a rich past that dates back centuries before Christ.

Abbas-Meerza, likely Persian or of Persian descent, was dressed in traditional Persian attire. He spoke English fluently and guided the visitors to view a grand mosque. The mosque had a wall with pointed arches and a beautiful frieze. Inside the enclosure were three domes, two minarets, and a large pointed arch leading to the mosque, all made of red sandstone. The interior was simple yet stunning, with white marble pillars, walls, roof, and pavement adorned with stone carvings. The mosque had relics like a hair believed to be from Prophet Mohammed's beard, displayed by a mollah. Visitors were shown ancient manuscripts, including a copy of the Koran said to be dictated by the Prophet himself.

Abbas-Meerza, a gracious host, invited the visitors to a lavish dinner at his palace. He then extended an offer to stay, which they politely declined. The next day, they visited the Mosque of Pearls and strolled through Chandi Chowk, lined with ornate shops. They ventured to the plains of Delhi, marveling at the ruins and a black mosque.

For two days, they explored Delhi with Lord Tremlyn as their guide, showing them the sites of the tragic massacre he had previously described aboard the Guardian-Mother. They then traveled by train to Agra, where they stayed at Lawrie's hotel. The journey was pleasant, passing through a densely populated area. Lord Tremlyn, preferring a casual talk to a formal lecture, shared insights about Agra's significance. He highlighted the city's beauty and its historical importance, especially the fortress of Akbar, a renowned emperor of India. Akbar's reign was marked by wisdom, justice, and progress. He promoted commerce, established fair governance, and respected religious diversity. Akbar's legacy as a just ruler and a patron of learning left a lasting impact on India.

After Akbar's death, his successors ruled Delhi until the Mogul Empire ended in 1761. Agra was attacked by the Jats and later by the Mahrattas, causing its population to plummet from 700,000 to 10,000. The English under Lord Lake captured Agra in 1803, and it has been under their control since. Despite the devastation, Agra's population has now recovered to about 170,000. The city's ruins provide easy access to building materials, showcasing the remnants of the past. Approaching the citadel, known as the fortress, visitors encounter structures like the Mosque of Jummah Musjid, built with red sandstone and marble bands. The Palace of Justice, now a military storeroom, displays relics like Akbar's throne. The Gates of Somnath, taken by Sultan Mahmoud, are now in Agra, adding to the historical richness of the city.|"[""1.

The carriages journeyed along the Jumna river to reach the Taj Mahal, a magnificent mausoleum in India. Emperor Shah Jehan built this wonder in memory of his beloved wife, Empress Mumtazi Mahal. Constructed with pink sandstone, marble, and adorned with precious stones, the Taj took seventeen years and twenty thousand workers to complete. Surrounded by a garden with cypress trees and flowers, the Taj stands on a sandstone terrace. Inside, the mausoleum dazzles with intricate mosaics and a marble screen enclosing the tombs of the emperor and empress. The majestic dome and intricate architecture make the Taj a sight to behold. The party was in awe of its beauty and discussed its wonders till dinner, learning about the historical significance of the structure.|"[""1.

The travelers spent an extra day in Agra, a city on a major railway line in India, before heading to Cawnpore the next day. Agra, situated on the Jumna River, is known for its ongoing bridge construction. After a five-hour train journey, they reached Cawnpore, a city with significant trade and 188,712 residents. Lord Tremlyn shared that Cawnpore lies on the Ganges River and offers a first glimpse of the river's grandeur. The city is notable for its mosques, temples, and historical significance due to the Indian Mutiny of 1857. The group was warmly welcomed upon arrival, with military officers ready to assist. Captain Chesly provided insights into the rebellion, recounting the tragic events that unfolded during the mutiny. The company then visited a Hindu temple where a solemn atmosphere lingered, reflecting the historical significance of the site.|['1.

Captain Chesly narrated a harrowing tale of deception and massacre by the treacherous rebel commander. The rebels provided twenty boats with provisions to deceive hungry people. As the boats set sail, hidden guns opened fire, sinking smaller boats and setting others ablaze. General Wheeler's boat managed to escape briefly but got stuck. The men were brutally murdered, and women and children were captured. They endured confinement, poor treatment, and indignities. Sir Henry Havelock's march to rescue the captives was met with defeat by Nana. In retaliation, Nana ordered the brutal massacre of the prisoners. A memorial church and garden now stand at the site, commemorating the tragic events. The group visited these memorials before continuing their journey along the Ganges, observing the temples and ghats along the sacred river. Sir Modava suggested a route to Lucknow, but Captain Ringgold preferred a direct path, bypassing Allahabad. The travelers departed from Cawnpore, marveling at the impressive station and the extensive boat bridge.|"['1.

Lord Tremlyn spoke of the corruption in the old kingdom's government under the native king, where people were excessively taxed and the police force was ineffective. The East India Company tried to take over the government but failed when the king refused to sign the treaty. Eventually, the king was deposed, leading to unrest among the people. During the 1857 Mutiny, rebels in Lucknow, the capital, challenged the new regime. Lucknow, now a vibrant city, boasts wide streets, well-constructed buildings, and bustling shops. The architecture, though ambitious, is often ridiculed. Professor Giroud shared the tale of Claude Martine, a Frenchman who rose to prominence in Oude, eventually becoming a millionaire and a patron of education. The group of tourists, led by Captain Ringgold, explored historical sites like the ruined Residency, a testament to the region's tumultuous past.|"[""1.

The town faced an attack by rebels, forcing the garrison and English townspeople to seek refuge in a three-story brick house ill-suited for defense. The besiegers' cannon fire destroyed the building and claimed many lives, including the commander Sir Henry Lawrence. Lord Tremlyn explained the historical events of the 1857 Mutiny to the group the next day. The defenders repelled three enemy assaults at the Residency before help arrived. The group visited the Alum-Bagh and the Kaiser Bagh, learning about the city's history and architecture. The Kaiser Bagh was built by Wajid Ali Shah, the deposed King of Oude, and not related to Germany as the name suggests. The buildings now house government officials. The day ended with a visit to the cemetery, where Lawrence and Havelock were buried.|"['1.

The group's next stop was at Claude Martine's palace, a blend of various architectural styles, some never seen before. Initially, it appeared as a small palace atop a larger one, very original and intricate. Moving on to the citadel, they passed through an ornate gateway, revealing a vast complex of buildings with the Imambara at its center. The sheer size was staggering, though they had seen many grand structures. The Great Imambara in Lucknow is a marvel, distinct from another similarly named building in the citadel. Major Shandon, their guide, explained that the palace was constructed by Nawab to immortalize his name. The Hoosseinabad Imambara, a tomb of Ali Shah, stood nearby, a delicate structure adorned with domes and towers. After exploring Lucknow's sights, the group rode through the city's wide avenues, admiring the neat houses and English-style gardens. Lochner's Hotel was their base, where Major Shandon entertained them with humorous tales. The following day, they boarded a train to Benares, enjoying the scenic route along the winding Boomtee River. Sir Modava, their designated speaker, began sharing insights about Benares, promising not to take much of their time.|"[""1.

Sir Modava was asked to locate Benares on both sides of the Ganges, leading to a humorous exchange with Louis and his mother. Benares, the largest city in this part of India after Lucknow, is situated on the left bank of the Ganges. The city extends for three miles along the river, with ornate temples, palaces, and houses lining the shore. It is considered a sacred city by Hindus. The city's narrow and crowded streets make carriages impractical, so a steam-launch was provided for touring. Benares is home to numerous Hindu temples and Mohammedan mosques, attracting visitors seeking spiritual solace. The group stayed at Clarke's Hotel and embarked on a steam-yacht for a scenic tour of Benares along the north shore of the river.|"['1.

The women were helped onto the ship. The captain, a polite Englishman, was very attentive to his passengers, who settled on the deck. The vessel, owned by the government, was cozy, though not as flashy as a maharajah's. The ghat was at the west end of the crescent, resembling an amphitheater. The river is usually half a mile wide but doubles in high water season. The captain pointed out the ghat as they moved away, a remarkable sight with ornate temples and spires. He mentioned the Man Munder observatory and the grand window. The steps were adorned with temples and spires, stretching endlessly. The captain spoke of the morning ritual where locals plunge into the river at sunrise, admiring the sun as it rises. The Munikurnika Ghat, a place for cremation, was also highlighted.|"['1.

The cremation process at the funeral pyres near the Ganges is a sacred ritual believed to guide souls to paradise. Tourists on a steamer witnessed the burning, shielded from the pungent odor. Dr. Hawkes explained the source of the smell, asafoetida, a gum with a foul scent. The workers tending the fires appeared like imps, adding an eerie atmosphere. The steamer then approached a ghat where Brahmins collected fees for bathing and sold religious items. A procession of pilgrims and joyful swimmers in the river were observed. Further along, grand palaces and a mosque with towering minarets were sights to behold. The journey provided a glimpse into the rich cultural and religious tapestry of the region.|['1.

The Emperor Aurungzeb constructed a mosque on the site of a Hindu temple dedicated to Siva, causing controversy among the worshippers of Vishnu. The Hindus used to climb a flight of one hundred stairs on their knees to worship Vishnu. The Sylph traveled up the river, passing by funeral pyres and crowded streets. They reached a square with a small round temple adorned with gold plates, considered sacred by Hindus. The temple's main deity is a plain stone post believed to embody Siva. The streets were packed with pilgrims in elaborate attire carrying offerings for deities. The group navigated through narrow, clean streets and reached wider avenues lined with beautiful homes. They encountered the Fountain of Dourga, a stunning red building filled with monkeys, where they fed and interacted with the animals. Later, they learned about the Feast of Ganesa, a revered deity symbolizing wisdom and commerce in Indian culture.|"[""1.

Sir Modava shared an intriguing tale with the group, explaining how the god Siva gave his son an elephant's head. This unique head is sometimes used to represent the god in ceremonies. The festival honoring this god is a grand affair in April, with effigies paraded through the streets. The celebration culminates with the idols being set afloat on the river amidst a colorful display of boats and fireworks. After exploring Benares for two days, the group learned about Patna, the fifteenth largest city in India. Despite its narrow streets and modest buildings, it has a population of around 165,000. The travelers decided to skip Patna and head to Calcutta instead, realizing that sometimes a glimpse of many cities is as enriching as an in-depth exploration of just one.|"[""1.

The Ganges River, a sacred waterway for Hindus, spans 1,509 miles and provides vital irrigation to 300,000 square miles. Its religious significance is vast, believed to cleanse sins and grant eternal peace to those who pass away near it. The river is navigable for small boats, aiding transportation and trade. The Ganges, like the Nile, enriches the soil with its yearly floods. Despite railway and canal developments, the river remains a crucial route for trade and travel. The Ganges Canal project, requiring £6,000,000 for completion, aims to connect major cities. Lord Tremlyn introduces Calcutta, a significant city accessible via the Hoogly River, a branch of the Ganges. Calcutta, established in 1686, boasts a rich history and cultural heritage.|['1.

The vast open space on the right side of the city map is the esplanade, housing Fort William, standing for almost two centuries. The fort once held a grim place known as the 'Black Hole,' where the nawab confined 146 prisoners in a cramped room, leading to the tragic demise of all but 23. Lord Clive later recaptured the fort from the nawab after a seven-month hold. Calcutta stretches five miles along the riverbank, approximately two miles wide. The city's name derives from Kali, a Hindu goddess, and cuttah, likely a temple. Calicut, a prosperous city visited by Vasco da Gama in 1498, lent its name to the cotton cloth, calico. The tourists reached Calcutta in the evening, lodging at the Great Eastern hotel. The following day, they explored the esplanade, a vast park with various buildings, including Fort William and Government House.

"The group strolled down the street to admire the grand homes of the wealthy, then settled on the hotel's spacious porch with a view of the road. Louis immediately checked a thermometer on a post. ""We get cyclones in May, September, and October, and sometimes in November,"" he explained. ""In 1867, one in November destroyed many bamboo houses. Another in June 1870 caused similar havoc."" The monsoons arrived in July, bringing a dangerous bore wave up the river at twenty miles per hour. Boats sought refuge in the middle of the river to avoid the destructive force.

In this region, Kali, a goddess of murder, was once worshipped in a gruesome manner with altars stained with human blood and surrounded by dead bodies. A festival called Churuk-Pooja involved a terrifying machine resembling a merry-go-round, but with sharp hooks instead of horses. Devotees were hung from these hooks and spun rapidly until they fell off, often injured or worse. Fortunately, the government intervened, transforming the festival into a more benign athletic display with music. The group then explored the Ganges delta, observing the unique wildlife and vegetation, including crocodiles and storks. Amidst the adventure, they enjoyed a lavish dinner onboard a steam-yacht, courtesy of their government hosts, before gearing up for a hunting expedition in the dense jungle.|"['1.

The boat journeyed through a passage to the Bay of Bengal, teeming with wildlife like buffalo, rhinoceros, and monkeys. The hunters agreed not to harm the harmless animals. One young hunter impulsively shot a python, causing a stir among the passengers. As they continued, they encountered a stockade where Hindu people lived, guarded against jungle predators. The party decided not to shoot the cranes and herons, finding no challenge in hunting such still targets. The hunters disembarked to explore the area, encountering crocodiles in the water. Despite taking down a few, they found the saurians to be unsatisfying prey.

The group encountered various traps set to catch tigers on the islands. One trap was a trench lined with sharp stakes where a tiger was trapped and killed by Captain Ringgold. Another trap used a flexible tree to snare tigers by tightening a slip-noose around their necks. The party then encountered a cobra and a python, which were shot by Felix and Scott. They later found a group of tigers drinking by a brook and successfully hunted them down. The hunters were praised for their success by the locals.

During their stay in Calcutta, the tourists had a memorable time exploring the Sunderbunds with Captain O'Flaherty while the hunters bagged big game. The group then visited the Botanical Garden, one of the world's finest, with plants growing outdoors due to the Torrid Zone climate. Uncle Moses marveled at the massive baobab and Indian banyan trees. As their week in Calcutta came to an end, Captain Ringgold proposed their return to the Guardian-Mother. However, Lord Tremlyn and his companions expressed deep gratitude and presented a testimonial for the noble rescue efforts during the wreck of the Travancore.

On the second day of the voyage, passengers gathered in the Conference Hall. The weather was pleasant, the sea calm, and everyone was happy to be back at sea. Mr. Gaskette had been busy updating maps during the stop in Bombay and Calcutta. Sir Modava, a popular figure, shared insights about Madras, the third-largest city in India, with 452,518 residents. The city is on the Coromandel coast and lacks safe harbors for large ships. It has a tumultuous history, known as the Carnatic region, where England and France once vied for control. The city's attempts to build a harbor have faced challenges due to cyclones. Madras experiences a tropical climate, with temperatures ranging from 76° to 88°, moderated by sea breezes.|"['1.

After a talk, the band performed a concert on the ship as it sailed towards Madras. The water near the shore was shallow, causing waves to break. Lord Tremlyn invited everyone to the Royal Hotel, which the ship was anchored near. The group took masulah-boats to land. These boats were paddled, not rowed, and were similar to others they had seen. Upon reaching the hotel, the party relaxed until tiffin time. Some boys went for a walk and ended up in a bullock-cart. Despite not understanding the driver, they found themselves heading away from the city. When they tried to stop, the driver insisted they wanted to go to Mavalipoor.

The man laughed heartily at the mistake and suggested giving the cartman a rupee when they reached the hotel. He then mentioned Hindu temples at Mavalipoor, over thirty miles away, that tourists often visited. Instructing the driver to take them to the Royal Hotel, they thanked the gentleman and parted ways. The cartman, now in a hurry, sped up the bullocks. Upon arrival, the boys gave the driver two rupees, and he bowed graciously. In Madras, landaus at three rupees a day were common, with carts and palanquins becoming less popular. After lunch, carriages awaited them for a drive. They passed through People's Park, Black Town, and Fort St. George, where they saw St. Thomas's Cathedral. The day ended with a visit to St. George's Cathedral and a statue of Bishop Heber. The next day, they explored the town, witnessing men washing sheets by the river. Finally, they boarded the Guardian-Mother, setting sail for Ceylon.|"['1.

Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka, is an island with a rich history and diverse culture. The people, called Singhalese or Cingalese, are believed to be descendants of immigrants from the Ganges region. The predominant religion is Buddhism, with sacred relics like Gautama's tooth. The island has seen periods of Portuguese, Dutch, and British rule, eventually becoming a British colony in 1802. The economy has shifted from coffee to tea production due to a fungus affecting the coffee trees. Cacao, cinchona, cardamoms, and spices are also cultivated. The population in 1891 was over 3 million, and the governor's salary was $20,000. Point de Galle, a town in the southwest, used to be a significant coaling and shipping station. Nowadays, it serves as a port for some steamship lines.|['1. What is the predominant religion in Ceylon, now known as Sri Lanka?\nA) Christianity\nB) Hinduism\nC) Islam\nD) Buddhism\nE) Sikhism', '2.

The city of Colombo, the capital of Ceylon, was named by the Portuguese. The meaning of the name is uncertain. Some say it refers to an oak-apple in French, while others relate it to the French term for Wales. The city is situated on a peninsula surrounded by the sea on three sides and a lake and moat on the land side. Colombo has grown in importance, surpassing Galle in business and prominence. The city boasts a population of nearly 127,000 and features typical British colonial architecture. Notable attractions include Lake Colombo and the cinnamon gardens. The breakwater, a safe harbor, greatly contributed to the city's success. The group visited the town's highlights, including the cinnamon gardens, learning about the cultivation and uses of cinnamon. They also explored the medicinal plant cinchona, the source of quinine. The day concluded with a concert by an Italian band, a common occurrence during their travels. The next day, the party journeyed by train to Kandy, a scenic elevated region, where they marveled at the island's majestic mountains.|"['1.

During their visit to Kandy, the group explored ancient temples towering up to four hundred feet high. These structures housed relics like Gautama's tooth and collar-bone, though some considered them fraudulent. The Brazen Palace, a nine-story building with sixteen hundred pillars, also caught their attention. However, most were unimpressed due to having seen grander edifices before. They also encountered the sacred Bo-tree. As they departed Kandy for Colombo, a farewell dinner was hosted, attended by dignitaries and the American consul.
