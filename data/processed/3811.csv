Once upon a time, a tale was whispered to me, but evidence suggests it was a Virginian's creation. I've shed blood and sweat to protect our land.

Harry hesitated at the water's edge, listening for any signs of pursuit but heard none. Bravely, he rode into the stream, going against the current and deeper into the gorge. As darkness enveloped the area, the sky above was dim. About halfway through the gorge, he heard noises above and stopped, hiding by the cliff. Voices echoed down, and stones were thrown over the edge, causing splashes. After a while, the voices faded, and Harry cautiously continued his journey. Emerging from the stream at dawn, he entered the frost-covered forest, feeling a sense of loneliness and worry about his companions. Despite the cold, he wrapped himself in a blanket, pondering the fate of Shepard and the others.

The loud shouts grew louder as the sound of hoofs thundered behind Harry. The forest loomed closer, and the rifles fired faster. Miraculously, neither Harry nor his horse were hit.

Harry woke up to the cool shadows of October falling around him. He yawned, stretched, and tried to recall where he was. Langdon informed him that he had slept for a week, missing a great battle with McClellan where they were defeated and had to retreat to Richmond. Harry was carried back to Richmond asleep in a wagon. As he gazed towards the spires of Richmond, Langdon lamented Harry's prolonged slumber during their time of need. Dalton, amused by Langdon's banter, suggested George fill Harry in on the details of the battle.

They put the chess men carefully in a box, which they gave to an orderly with very strict injunctions. Then both, after heaving a deep sigh, transformed themselves into men of energy, action, precision and judgment. Every soldier and officer in the trim ranks of the Invincibles was ready.

But action did not come as soon as Harry and his friends had thought. Lee made preliminary movements to mass his army for battle, and then stopped. The spies reported that political wire-pulling, that bane of the North, was at work. McClellan's enemies at Washington were active, and his indiscreet utterances were used to the full against him. Attention was called again and again to his great overestimates of Lee's army and to the paralysis that seemed to overcome him when he was in the presence of the enemy. Lincoln, the most forgiving of men, could not forgive him for his failure to use his full opportunity at Antietam and destroy Lee.

Harry and Dalton observed the Union army's massive preparations across the river at Stafford Heights. With 150 cannons aimed at Fredericksburg, the city lay in imminent danger. Despite the tense situation, General Jackson remained calm, engrossed in a theological book. Harry noted the eerie tranquility in the deserted streets, occupied only by Mississippi soldiers fortifying the town. As darkness fell, the city vanished from view, replaced by twinkling lights across the river.

They had finished their dinners, and with the general's permission, they settled in the tent next to his, wrapped in their blankets. Harry slept deeply, but in the midst of the dark winter night, a loud rumbling sound woke him. Alert from the recent events, he quickly stood up, along with Dalton. General Jackson was outside his tent, peering into the darkness towards the river, with other officers gathering around him. Harry and Dalton stood ready for any orders. The dense fog that had settled over the river and its banks shielded the bridge builders, leaving the Southerners unable to aim accurately. Harry's mind raced, imagining the construction sounds of the bridge. Despite the challenges, General Jackson's presence shone brightly in the night, a symbol of strength and leadership. He expressed concern about the heavy fog hindering their plans. General Jackson remained vigilant, observing the obscured activities across the river.|"[""1.

Harry's heartbeats gradually calmed, the throbbing in his head easing. General Jackson, with his usual solemn kindness, allowed his young officers to rest. Harry and Dalton lay down, trying to relax, but sleep eluded them. The night felt endless, the fog seeping into their bones. They heard the distant sounds of axes and cannons across the Rappahannock River. As dawn approached, a messenger arrived for General Jackson, confirming readiness. The darkness lifted, revealing the armies poised for battle. The tension mounted, culminating in a thunderous exchange of gunfire. The Mississippians unleashed a storm of bullets on the Union bridge builders. Harry shuddered as the battlefield erupted into chaos.|['1.

The Southern army watched as Lee and Jackson prepared to defend the ridges. The Mississippians, deadly with their rifles, forced Union workers off the bridge. Despite the intense waiting, the brave bridge builders faced the deadly fire multiple times, only to be driven back each time. Union riflemen retaliated, but the Southerners held their ground. The Mississippi hail cleared the bridge of any workers who dared to cross. The river sparkled like steel between the sheets of flame from both sides. The heavy cannon roar shook the earth, destroying buildings in Fredericksburg. Longstreet's artillery remained silent, unable to match the Union's firepower. The Mississippians in their rifle pits endured the bombardment, protecting themselves in their shelters. Harry felt sorrow for the brave men falling under the relentless fire. Jackson's army remained quiet, observing the intense cannonade engulfing the town.|"['1.

Harry and Dalton strolled to where the Invincibles were positioned, except for Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire who stood upright, eyes fixed on the cannonade. Colonel Talbot mentioned the Yankees' strength in forcing through, with their own artillery insufficient to counter. Langdon invited Harry to join them in the gully where his friends were resting, including a West Point fellow, Captain Swayne, from Tennessee. Swayne had fought alongside them at battles like the Seven Days and Second Manassas. St. Clair noticed how the gully softened the sounds of the cannons, creating a unique harmony.

The sudden silence after the cannonade ceased felt oppressive to Harry and the Southern army. Colonel Talbot remarked on the failed Yankee attempt to cross the Rappahannock, noting the steel hurled by the Union batteries. He asked Harry to whisper a request to General Jackson for the Invincibles to lead the attack. Harry agreed but mentioned General Jackson's secretive nature. As they waited, Hooker prepared his men for a daring river crossing under fire. Despite the danger, four regiments bravely entered the boats, heading towards the Southern shore as the Union batteries provided cover. The tension mounted as the Northern generals made their move for a decisive assault.|"['1.

The Mississippians fired their bullets, causing some boats to sink, and men to fall into the river. Despite casualties, the Union army successfully crossed the Rappahannock River, building bridges rapidly. The Confederate army retreated as the Union troops advanced. Harry, a soldier, noticed the quiet night but felt the returning cold. He pondered why the Union general delayed the crossing. As dawn approached, Harry observed the Union camp with Dalton, realizing the battle was already won. The Confederate generals, like Lee and Jackson, strategized with precision, understanding their opponents deeply.

The Union brigades, dark in the gloomy winter dawn, appeared endless to Harry. From where he stood, the advancing columns crossing the river seemed nearly solid. Despite knowing men were falling under Southern gunfire, the living soldiers closed ranks so swiftly that he couldn't spot any gaps in the lines. Dalton remarked on the soldiers' unwavering advance, admiring their determination. The shifting wind brought back the fog, concealing the river, town, and Union army. The Confederate cannons fell silent, replaced by the rhythmic sounds of thousands marching. Harry observed General Jackson on the right of Lee's line, ready for battle. Lee, calm and collected, rode along the lines on his white horse, eliciting cheers from his men.

Cheers erupted along the line when Jackson appeared before battle, but a brief silence followed as many soldiers did not recognize him. Jackson blushed, feeling apologetic for his ornate attire, signaling that he wore it to honor the upcoming victory. The cheers resumed, showing the deep respect and loyalty the soldiers had for him. Despite his stern demeanor, the soldiers saw Jackson as one of their own, a natural leader among equals. After observing the troops through his glasses, Jackson returned to his original position. Harry met with Stuart, who was eager for battle, but maintained the line as ordered. The Union army, unaware of their impending defeat, marched boldly forward.

Harry listened to the bullets whistling past him, some hitting the trees and the ground. The sound of the bullets worried him more than the distant cannon fire. The fog made it hard for the skirmishers to aim accurately, protecting General Jackson and his staff as they rode on. They reached a hill, now known as Lee's Hill, where General Lee awaited his generals. As the fog lifted, the sun shone brightly, revealing the Army of the Potomac with its flags waving and cannons roaring. Despite the Union artillery's impressive display, the Southern troops faced a fierce onslaught. General Lee remained calm, while Harry felt the tension rise as the Union troops advanced towards Jackson's position.

The brave Pennsylvanians charged forward, met by General Pelham's artillery. Despite his fierce defense, the heavy enemy batteries pushed Pelham back. Franklin then brought more artillery to support Meade and the Pennsylvanians. Meanwhile, the Southern army faced a rain of steel from the opposing batteries across the river. Jackson's men remained hidden, escaping the worst of the bombardment. As tension mounted, a Northern sharpshooter took a shot at Jackson, but missed. Harry observed the unfolding drama, noting the sharpshooter's movements. Yet, the sharpshooter did not risk another shot. Jackson, unperturbed, continued his observations.

During the Civil War, General Hancock, under Burnside's command, led a relentless attack on Marye's Hill. Despite the bravery of the Union soldiers, they faced fierce resistance and suffered heavy casualties. Burnside, determined to take the hill, ordered another assault led by Hooker. However, Hooker, realizing the futility of the mission, tried to dissuade Burnside, to no avail. As the day waned, Hooker prepared for a final desperate charge.

Harry stopped asking questions as the Northern artillery unleashed a furious barrage after the last charge crumbled on Marye's Hill. The Union forces, despite suffering immense losses, had a superior number of cannons that thundered defiantly. The Union Army retreated under the protection of the artillery, having shown unwavering courage in the face of defeat.

Harry conversed briefly with the two colonels, Langdon, and St. Clair before returning to his headquarters. Both armies, preparing for battle the next day, rested with their weapons close by, while the forest and the fields were still littered with the fallen. However, Harry did not sleep, staying awake with Dalton outside Jackson's tent, ready for any orders. Jackson, aware of Burnside's plans for another attack despite heavy losses, worked tirelessly through the night. Harry observed Jackson's unwavering determination and leadership as he strategized for the upcoming battle. The soldiers reinforced their positions, building defenses and fortifying the stone wall. Jackson briefly rested before returning to his duties, showing no signs of fatigue. As morning approached, the solemn aftermath of the battle was evident, with the enemy campfires flickering below.

The staff heard enough through the fogs and mists to know that the Army of the Potomac was awake and stirring. The Southern army also arose, lighted its fires, cooked and ate its food and waited for the enemy. Before it was yet light Harry, on a message to Stuart, rode to the top of Prospect Hill with him, and, as they sat there on their horses, the sun cleared away the fog and mist, and they saw the Army of the Potomac drawn up in line of battle, defiant and challenging, ready to attack or to be attacked. Harry felt a thrill of admiration that he did not wish to check. After all, the Yankees were their own people, bone of their bone, and their courage must be admired. The Army of the Potomac, too, was learning to fight without able chiefs. The young colonels and majors and captains could lead them, and there they were, after their most terrible defeat, grim and ready. There was much hot firing by skirmishers that day and artillery duels at long range, but the Northern army, which had fortified on the plain, would not come out of its intrenchments, and the Southern soldiers also stuck to theirs. Burnside, who had crossed the river to join his men, had been persuaded at last that a second attack was bound to end like the first. The next day Burnside sent in a flag of truce, and they buried the dead. The|"['1.

Harry did not forget the two generals crucial to the South. It would be tragic if Jackson and Stuart fell in a minor skirmish while a major battle loomed. Amid whizzing steel shards, the generals and their staff emerged unscathed. Jackson expressed his discomfort with hidden dangers in the thickets. The distant gunfire indicated Southern forces testing Hooker in the Wilderness. As night fell, the flashes of battle illuminated the darkening landscape. Jackson halted his advance, understanding Hooker's position. The next morning, Hooker fortified his lines, anticipating a full Southern army at Chancellorsville. Jackson's division watched, out of cannon range, while vigilant pickets lined the vast front. Lee's arrival united the Southern army, signaling a decisive stand against Hooker. Lee and Jackson conferred, preparing for the impending clash under the flickering campfires' glow.|"['1.

Harry and Dalton perched on a small hill and watched as the two generals conducted a lengthy meeting, occasionally calling upon McLaws, Anderson, Pender, and other commanders. The significance of the night weighed heavily on the two boys. Nature's harshness in the Wilderness set the stage for the impending drama. The darkness transformed the forest into an ancient, primitive world in Harry's mind, filling the air with ominous signals. Even the familiar sounds made him jump, and the fading campfires added to the eerie atmosphere. Harry confided in George about feeling oppressed by the war's uncertainties. Meanwhile, Hooker, facing Lee and Jackson's strategic prowess, grappled with decisions at the Chancellor House. The Union Army's size advantage loomed large, prompting conflicting opinions among Hooker's generals on whether to attack or fortify their positions. Lee and Jackson, on the other hand, faced the challenge with clarity and resolve, knowing the South's dire situation required bold action.|"[""1. What is the main focus of the passage?\nA.

Harry, leaning against a bush, drifted into a light sleep until Dalton roused him. The instinct of war jolted him awake. Every sense heightened, he saw Lee and Jackson parting under the faint moonlight in the Wilderness. The vast army hidden in the thickets remained mostly unseen. As they dozed off again, Sherburne woke them before dawn, exhausted from riding with General Stuart. He revealed a strategic opportunity: the Northern army's weak right flank. Sherburne believed they could exploit this vulnerability. Lee and Jackson discussed a plan with a major named Hotchkiss, who had discovered a crucial road through the Wilderness. They decided on a bold maneuver to strike the Northern flank while creating a diversion in the front. Jackson, confident in their success, eagerly prepared to execute the daring operation.|"[""1.

Harry and his companion rode in silence through the Wilderness, hidden from view by the thickets and forests. The rhythmic march of the army felt like a steady pulse to Harry, blending the sounds of men, horses, and guns into a single musical note. As they advanced, the roar of Lee's attack in the distance grew louder, signaling a real battle ahead. Despite the peaceful May morning, the air was filled with tension.

The Union generals' curiosity about the marching column grew as they appealed to Hooker for permission to investigate. Sickles led a strong division towards Jackson but encountered Lee's troops instead. A fierce battle ensued, forcing Sickles to call for reinforcements. Despite a formidable Northern force driving off the Southern division temporarily, Jackson's vigilance and quick response turned the tide. The Northern forces, unaware of the widening gap between Lee and Jackson, retreated. Harry observed from a distance, impressed by Jackson's alertness and ability to detach men while pursuing his main objective. As the army marched through dusty paths, soldiers struggled to breathe, but they pressed on, unwavering.

Harry swiftly joined Sherburne's troop, ready for action as they faced a dense mist shrouding the advancing Northern cavalry. With outnumbered odds, Sherburne valiantly positioned his troops to delay the enemy, sacrificing himself for the cause. Amidst the chaos, Harry felt a mix of fear and determination as the clash of steel and thundering hoofs drew closer. Southern skirmishers returned with a rain of bullets, momentarily halting the Northern cavalry's advance. In the intense battle, Harry fiercely defended himself with a pistol, amidst the tumult of shots and shouts, until the Northern cavalry surged past them after a brief but fierce encounter.|"['1.

Harry's horse was knocked down by the Northern charge, but both horse and rider rose unharmed. As the cavalry division galloped on, Harry saw Southern skirmishers' fire intensify. Many riderless horses ran loose. Sherburne, wounded but standing, rallied his troopers. Inspired, they charged the Northern flank, engaging in a fierce sabre battle. Illinois troops turned the tide, capturing some Southerners. Stuart's cavalry, including Harry and Sherburne, aimed to stall until Stuart's arrival. As the Northern force grew, Buford approached.

Harry watched as the Southern cavalry, led by Stuart with his long yellow hair flowing, clashed with the Union forces under Pleasanton. Stuart initially drove back the Northern horsemen but was soon faced with artillery and infantry in the woods. Pleasanton, displaying skill and courage, pressed his advantage upon finding campaign instructions in Stuart's captured baggage. As the battle unfolded, Harry saw the chaos intensify with cavalry charging and falling back. The conflict escalated as thousands of sabres gleamed in the sunlight.

The battle raged on as the gunners fired the cannons, and the horsemen charged back and forth, wrenching the guns from each other's hands. The spectacle was intense, with horses kicking and biting in fury amidst the dust and flashing sabres.

After nearly an hour, his nerves calmed, and he fell into a deep sleep. By morning, his youthfulness had returned, both physically and mentally. Doubts and fears vanished as the unstoppable Army of Northern Virginia marched towards new victories. Despite Hooker's understanding of Lee's movements and reinforcement of troops, Lee remained focused on his goal, advancing without falter. Calls for help from the Valley of Virginia intensified, with messengers pleading for Lee's aid against Milroy's harsh tactics. Lee, undeterred, dispatched Ewell to lead Jackson's old corps. Ewell, rejuvenated and eager, received the dispatch with enthusiasm. Troubles loomed for Milroy, and St. Clair and Langdon, along with Harry, prepared to confront him.

Harry had left his friends, the Invincibles, and was now with Dalton and Lee near the Potomac River. They continued their march from Maryland to Pennsylvania, a fertile region with rocky areas. The weather grew hot, and they drank from the numerous streams along the way. Lee, along with Hill and Longstreet, led the troops. As they reached Chambersburg, Lee ordered no destruction. However, news arrived that the Army of the Potomac was advancing towards them. Harry realized the seriousness of the situation and the need to turn back to face the threat. Stuart and his cavalry were absent on a raid, leaving them lacking crucial information. The weather was sweltering, similar to Kentucky and Virginia. Harry admired the landscape with its farms and clear streams. Approaching a house, they knocked on the door, met by a man armed with a musket, his family watching from inside.

Dalton expressed his frustration, claiming that General Meade had more than nine men with him. He urged for the truth, dismissing stories of rebel attacks as mere tales. Despite his poor memory, he couldn't recall recent events, like a possible encounter with a hundred thousand soldiers. Advising the rebels to retreat, he praised their good nature but warned of the overwhelming Union forces. Harry and Dalton returned to camp with no valuable information, as both armies remained elusive. Lee's uncertainty about engaging in battle was evident, with the Army of the Potomac posing a threat.

Harry delivered a message to Lee, who shared plans for a flying column's mission to a town known for its shoe factory. Despite worn-out shoes, Lee reassured Harry that being a shoe buyer was honorable. As dawn broke on July 1st, the troops marched through mist-covered hills, resembling castles and pyramids to Harry.

The Union Eleventh Corps faced a fierce attack at Gettysburg, reminiscent of their past defeat at Chancellorsville. Flanked by Jubal Early's forces, the Eleventh Corps crumbled under the overwhelming assault, turning into a mass of fleeing soldiers. Harry heard the triumphant rebel yell as Ewell's troops advanced, driving the Union forces back. Despite the initial chaos, the Union army regrouped on Cemetery Hill, preparing to face the Southern onslaught. As Lee's presence loomed on Seminary Ridge, hope and determination filled Harry and Dalton.

The two soldiers rode silently into the group of officers standing behind Lee. No reports were needed as the events spoke for themselves. Their comrades greeted them with nods, but Harry kept his eyes on Lee, who was observing the ongoing battle below. Despite the dwindling combat, the scene remained intense, with cannons booming and flames rising from burning houses. General Hill, though ill, displayed unwavering courage. As Harry watched, he saw Hill and Lee conversing while the Northern forces retreated in disarray. The day was not over, but Lee hesitated in pursuing the defeated enemy, a decision that puzzled Harry. Despite Lee's usual brilliance, Harry sensed a slight dimming of his genius that afternoon, possibly due to caution or the absence of Jackson.

The leaders in the South were unaware of the small Northern force on the hill. Despite heavy losses, the Northern troops under Buford and Reynolds showed remarkable courage. With only a fraction of their numbers left, they regrouped on Cemetery Hill, ready to face the enemy again. Meanwhile, Hancock rushed to join them, recognizing the strategic advantage of their position. Both Meade and Lee knew the decisive battle would unfold there. As night fell, troops continued to march towards the battlefield, and generals gathered to plan their strategies. Meade, appearing weary but determined, inspired his officers to prepare for the impending storm.

Lee's generals regrouped at their posts. Harry, diligently carrying out his duties, observed the army's strategic positioning under Ewell and Hill, ready for battle. The news of Stuart's cavalry arriving on the morrow lifted Harry's spirits, despite the darkness of the night. As he rode through the battlefield, the stars above seemed distant and indifferent to the impending conflict. Passing wounded soldiers, Harry's heart swelled with compassion, especially for a young boy in a blue uniform. Delivering his message near Gettysburg, Harry sought out his comrades, the Invincibles, fearing the worst. Finding them exhausted but alive, Harry felt relief amidst the chaos of war.|"[""1.

Harry crossed the small fence and gazed at the motionless figures under the moonlight. They appeared eerie and frozen. Despite feeling a chill down his spine, he steeled himself and moved closer, searching for the colonels and lieutenants. Suddenly, one figure rose and spoke with grace, asking Harry to be quick with any message. The colonels seemed to stir but lacked the strength to rise. Continuing his search, Harry found a figure in a lieutenant's uniform, Langdon. Though initially fearing the worst, Harry shook Langdon awake. Langdon, convinced they were ghosts, questioned their survival through an active volcano. He expressed the need to return to rest, emphasizing his friendship with Harry.|"['1.

No. A million shells burst over both of us, but we escaped them all. But Arthur will be dead to the world for a while, just the same. His is the fourth figure beyond me, but you couldn't wake him if you fired a cannon at his ear, and in two minutes you won't be able to wake me with another cannon. Happy's head fell back as he spoke, and in less than half the time he gave he had joined the band of the original seven sleepers. Harry, stepping lightly over the slumbering figures--he had left his horse on the hill--went back to the staff, where he saw that many were yet watching. At the urgent advice of an older officer he stretched himself between two blankets to protect his body from dew and slept a little before dawn. He, too, had felt the exhaustion shown by the Invincibles, but his nervous system was keyed highly, too high, in fact, to sleep long. Moreover, he seemed to find some new reserve of strength, and when Dalton put his hand upon his shoulder he sprang to his feet, eager and active. Dalton had not been sent on many errands the night before, and, sleeping longer than Harry, he had been up a half hour earlier. The rim of the eastern sky was reddening fast, and Round Top and Little Round Top stood out against it, black and exaggerated.

The generals returned, yet Lee remained silent. Harry wished he could understand Lee's thoughts, knowing the weight on his mind despite his calm exterior. Lee hesitated to give the order to attack, surprising Harry and Dalton. The day grew hot as the sun rose in the sky, casting a golden light on the waiting armies. The troops lay still, waiting for the battle to begin. The vast arena of the battlefield seemed perfect for a decisive clash. As the day wore on, the tension mounted. Suddenly, a cannon shot broke the silence, signaling the start of the battle. The armies unleashed a fierce exchange of fire, with Longstreet's troops advancing towards the Peach Orchard.

Harry and Dalton, crouched to see through the smoke, witnessed a thrilling spectacle. Texans, tall and strong, led by Hood, charged Sickles' corps with a fierce war cry. Despite heavy fire, they pressed on, crossing a stream to engage the enemy. The battle was fierce, with both sides fighting hard. Hood's men aimed for Little Round Top, a crucial hill. Meanwhile, Northern generals saw its strategic value and rushed troops to defend it. Warren, a Northern general, quickly recognized the importance of the hill and directed a brigade to secure it.

During the intense battle, Sickles and Hood suffered severe injuries, with Sickles losing a leg and Hood losing an arm and later a leg. Despite this, Longstreet continued to press the attack. General Lee, displaying calmness, observed the fighting from a distance, only giving one order throughout the entire battle. The Union troops, led by Hancock, fiercely defended the Peach Orchard and Little Round Top, inflicting heavy casualties on the Confederates. As the day progressed, the battle grew more ferocious, with sharpshooters on both sides causing significant losses.

The battle of Gettysburg raged on, with the Southern forces facing setbacks on the Union's left wing. Despite some successes elsewhere, the day ended with both sides at a standstill. Harry, a young soldier, felt disheartened by the lack of a clear victory. As the night fell, he witnessed the weariness and doubts among the generals, including Lee.

Harry and Dalton, with nothing to do, got permission to mingle among the soldiers. As they felt their spirits rise, they headed towards the battlefield. Harry hoped to find the Invincibles again, but time was short. Disappointed to learn the Invincibles were at the front, they turned back. The night was clear, and they saw wounded soldiers coming and going from a cold spring. Despite wearing different uniforms, the men gathered at the spring as friends, setting aside the upcoming strife. Harry and Dalton, thirsty, joined them.

Harry, taken aback by the man's strong words, felt a sense of foreboding. The man spoke with passion, his eyes shining brightly in his weathered face.

The Southern artillery was precise, hitting General Meade's headquarters. Despite the heavy casualties among important officers, the Northern gunners remained steadfast, swiftly replacing fallen comrades and guns. The chaos intensified with hundreds of shells screeching through the air, while shrapnel and grape shot filled the sky with a constant whine. Harry, feeling the intensity of the battle, found relief in a brief respite from the relentless bombardment. As he returned, the cannon fire continued unabated, shaking the ground with its deafening roar. Both the Northern and Southern armies suffered losses, with shattered guns and devastating casualties. Witnessing Lee and Longstreet's unwavering resolve under fire, Harry saw the Southern ammunition dwindling rapidly.

The brave Virginians marched boldly in a straight line towards the Union army, facing fifty thousand riflemen and a hundred guns. Their generals, including Pickett, Garnett, Wilcox, Armistead, Pettigrew, and Trimble, rode alongside them. The Southern cannons fired over their heads, but a breeze cleared the smoke.
