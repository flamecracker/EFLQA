Before telling the story of the adventures he experienced, it's important to mention that when traveling across different European states and kingdoms, a passport is required. Each government in Europe believes that its citizens belong to the reigning sovereign and need permission to leave the country. To travel to another kingdom, one must have their passport stamped by the respective government ministers in Paris. Leaving France also requires approval from the authorities, obtained by stamping the passport at the prefecture of police. Rollo's uncle George proposed a trip to Switzerland and asked if Rollo could join. Mrs. Holiday agreed, and Mr. George discussed the cost and logistics. They needed to sort out the passports by visiting the prefecture of police before they could leave the next day. Mr. George suggested asking the hotel master for help since they could not involve Rollo's parents in the process.|"[""1.

Mr. George signaled for the carriage to stop as they reached the street corner. The coachman halted by the sidewalk. Mr. George exited and advised Rollo to stay calm and not fret if they couldn't get the passports that day. Rollo then found the passports in his uncle's room and proceeded to Carlos's apartment. Rollo rang the bell, and the courier fetched Carlos. Carlos, excited, quickly readied himself to go. They gestured they would travel by carriage. Carlos eagerly got ready. The scene shifted to a cozy room in the hotel where the hotel owner and his family spent time. Rollo visited this room to ask for directions in French.

"""Come, Carlos,"" he said. ""We're set. I know the way, but not the plan once we're there. We'll follow others getting passports stamped."" The carriage navigated busy city streets toward the river. Rollo and Carlos glimpsed bridges, stalls, bathing houses, and women washing clothes by the water. They approached a large island in the River Seine housing historic buildings like Notre Dame and Hotel Dieu. The carriage entered a grand old building courtyard with soldiers. Inside, they found a bustling hall with desks, clerks, and people handling passports. Rollo, realizing he wore his cap indoors, apologized to a soldier. Unnoticed, they joined others waiting. Rollo eventually handed his passports to an authority figure who reviewed them and passed them on, speaking in French."|"['1.

Rollo and Carlos faced a challenge in finding the American legation, but with the help of a kind girl and some perseverance, they made it just in time before closing. The secretary at the legation was welcoming, speaking English with Rollo and Spanish with Carlos. They quickly got their passports stamped and moved on to the Swiss legation. There, they paid a fee and received the necessary stamps.

Rollo learned the process of getting his passport stamped by observing others at the office. Once his name was called, he followed the steps correctly. His uncle checked the passports carefully and saw the police stamp, ensuring they were ready for their journey to Switzerland. When preparing for their trip, Rollo asked his uncle about the route using a map. Mr. George described their journey along the Rhine River to Switzerland. Excited, Rollo arrived at the Strasbourg station, amazed by its grandeur. The station was orderly, with travelers quietly moving about. Rollo noticed a lady and two boys with a dog, catching his interest. He then realized his uncle had moved to board the train. Mr. George explained the ticket options, offering Rollo the choice between first, second, or third class for their journey.|"['Question 1:\nHow did Rollo learn the process of getting his passport stamped?\nA) By reading a guidebook\nB) By observing others at the office\nC) By asking his uncle\nD) By watching a video tutorial\nE) By searching online for instructions', ""Question 2:\nWhat did Rollo's uncle check on the passports before their journey to Switzerland?\nA) The expiration date\nB) The visa requirements\nC) The police stamp\nD) The traveler's name\nE) The photo identification"", 'Question 3:\nHow did Rollo feel when he arrived at the Strasbourg station?\nA) Anxious\nB) Confused\nC) Amazed\nD) Frustrated\nE) Bored', 'Question 4:\nWhy did Rollo ask his uncle about the route using a map?\nA) To learn about the history of Switzerland\nB) To find the best restaurants along the way\nC) To plan their journey along the Rhine River\nD) To locate the nearest gas station\nE) To avoid traffic jams', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Mr. George offer Rollo when explaining the ticket options?\nA) A discount code\nB) A free meal voucher\nC) A choice between first, second, or third class\nD) A travel insurance policy\nE) A guided tour package', ""Question 6:\nWhat caught Rollo's interest at the Strasbourg station?\nA) A street performer\nB) A group of tourists\nC) A lady and two boys with a dog\nD) The architecture of the station\nE) The train schedule board""]"|['B) By observing others at the office', 'C) The police stamp', 'C) Amazed', 'C) To plan their journey along the Rhine River', 'C) A choice between first, second, or third class', 'C) A lady and two boys with a dog']
Mr. George always let Rollo take care of himself during their travels, believing it was important for boys to learn self-reliance. Rollo sometimes found his uncle's approach a bit blunt, making him feel scared or puzzled initially. However, he learned to handle situations independently, feeling proud afterward. Rollo admired his uncle for giving him such opportunities. When Rollo considered saving money by traveling second-class while his uncle chose first-class, it intrigued him. Rollo confidently got his ticket in French, though not perfectly. They entered a luxurious waiting room for first-class passengers, where they boarded a train with distinct carriages. As they traveled towards Switzerland, Rollo enjoyed the scenic views along the Rhine River, passing through Alsatia, a picturesque province filled with villages, castles, and gardens.|"['1.

The railway journey ended at the city of Basle in Switzerland. Just before entering Basle, the train paused at what appeared to be a station but was actually the customs office for checking trunks and passports. A guard in uniform politely asked Mr. George and Rollo to follow him into the customs house. Inside, passengers' trunks were being carried in for inspection. Travelers presented their passports to secretaries who stamped them for crossing the Swiss border. After the passport check, passengers moved to another hall where their baggage was laid out for inspection by customs officers. The purpose of this inspection was to ensure no goods were hidden. Travelers can bring personal items duty-free, but goods for sale or not strictly personal incur a duty tax. Rollo found his trunk, while nearby, officers discovered undeclared items in a lady's large trunk causing distress. Amid this, an officer called Rollo to identify his trunk.|"['1.

Rollo returned to the officer to state that he had nothing to declare. The officer chalked a mark on Rollo's trunk without inspecting it, indicating it was fine. A porter then took the trunk back to the train. Rollo noticed the issue with the lady's baggage seemed resolved, but she appeared displeased. Rollo and his uncle George then headed to the platform. The lady was explaining the situation to friends, expressing anger. Mr. George explained the consequences of not declaring dutiable items, emphasizing the importance of paying duty. They discussed how not paying one's share affects others. Passing the Swiss border, they settled at a hotel named Three Kings in multiple languages. Basle, situated by the Rhine, collects waters from various sources, eventually flowing into Lake of Constance. The streams start turbid but clear up as they flow through Switzerland.|"[""1.

Rollo observed the river and other travelers in the large, bright room. Mr. George discussed Switzerland's features, a valley between mountain ranges, with a broad northern slope and a narrow southern slope.

The morning meal was almost done, but Mr. George had done most of the talking, slowing down the eating. He told Rollo about their journey from Basle towards Berne, the country's capital. Berne was placed near the center of the northern slope, as Mr. George had mentioned. A diligence, a kind of stagecoach in France and Switzerland, was how they would travel. Unlike American stagecoaches, diligences have four separate sections. Rollo had seen one in Paris, so he understood the discussion with his uncle about where to sit in the one heading to Berne. To help you visualize, a diligence has three windows on its side, each leading to a different section, and a fourth section on top called the banquette. The conductor oversees everything, and passengers and luggage are his responsibility.|"[""1.

In a diligence, a type of old-fashioned coach, there are different seating options for passengers. People who prefer comfort and style choose the coupé, which has comfortable seats and great views but is more expensive. Most travelers opt for the interior, where seats are comfy but views are limited due to fewer windows. Those looking for a fun time and a good view usually sit in the banquette, which is cheaper than the interior and coupé. The rotonde, the cheapest area, is at the back and often filled with laborers and servants. Baggage is stored on top of the diligence, well-protected. Mr. George and his companion plan to take the diligence to Berne and choose the banquette for the best view and chance to hear interesting conversations among the coachmen and passengers.|['1.

Rollo guided Mr. George to the third floor, where they discovered the detailed map of Switzerland hanging on the wall as described. Together, they carefully examined the map, focusing on the central valley and surrounding mountain ranges. Mr. George pointed out the vast slope of land in the northern part of Switzerland, bordered by the River Rhine and mountains to the south. They discussed how the melting glaciers and snow create lakes in the valleys. Mr. George explained how the water flows rapidly from these high-altitude lakes, forming cascades and rivers. Later, Rollo easily secured spots on the diligence for their journey to Berne. They watched as trunks and bags were loaded onto the carriage by men using a step ladder. Nearby, two children, neatly dressed and about Rollo's age, waited for the diligence to depart.|['1.

The girl and boy watched Rollo as he approached the archway. The girl had beautiful blue eyes, exuding gentleness, while the boy seemed curious. The diligence was getting ready to depart, and Rollo observed the differences in the setup compared to American stagecoaches. As Rollo explored, he decided to talk to the boy. The boy explained they were seated in the coupe since the banquette was full, disappointing him as he wanted a better view. Adolphus and Lottie's parents arrived hurriedly, boarding the diligence. Rollo and Mr. George waited as the horses were harnessed. They climbed aboard using a ladder and started their journey, the coach thundering through the town. Rollo initially worried about the conductor being left behind but saw him skillfully climb aboard even as the coach sped along.|"['1.

Rollo embarked on a coach journey to Berne and was captivated by the picturesque landscapes that unfolded before his eyes. The road was smooth and the ride magnificent, with gradual ascents and sweeping curves revealing new and beautiful vistas at every turn. The Swiss houses, with their large size and broad roofs resembling hats, stood amidst stunning fields and gardens. The view was adorned by snow-covered mountains to the south, glistening in the sun. Arriving in Berne, Rollo explored the city's unique streets, sheltered by arcades extending from the buildings above. Stalls filled with curious goods lined the sidewalks, offering an array of unfamiliar items. Berne's emblem, the bear, held a special place in the city's history, with images and effigies of the animal adorning various public spaces.|"['1.

After a long day exploring Berne, Mr. George and Rollo boarded a coach to Thun, a charming town nestled near a beautiful lake in Switzerland. The journey took only a few hours, and upon arrival, they discovered Thun to be a small, walled town with a church perched on a hill overlooking the picturesque surroundings. The unique feature of Thun was that all the hotels were located outside the town, offering stunning views of the lake and mountains. Mr. George and Rollo dined at one of these lakeside hotels and later embarked on a hike up a hill behind the hotel. Along the way, they stumbled upon a quaint English chapel and eventually reached a pavilion with breathtaking panoramic views of the landscape. The higher they climbed, the colder the air became, a phenomenon Mr. George explained to Rollo, sparking their curiosity and awe at the natural wonders of Switzerland.|"['1.

Mr. George explained that the height needed to view the sun varies based on the location on Earth. At the equator, it's higher due to the intense heat, while in temperate regions like Switzerland or America, it's lower. Near the poles, you only need to go up a bit. The young gentlemen admired the stunning scenery from the pavilion, overlooking the lake nestled in a deep valley amid majestic mountains. Mr. George mentioned two roads flanking the lake, offering splendid views. He suggested traveling by water when possible for variety and to enjoy the scenic route. The valley, known as the Aar valley, stretches about fifty miles, with the Aar River originating from cascades and waterfalls near Meyringen, renowned for its breathtaking natural beauty.|"['1.

"""We are heading to a beautiful place,"" Mr. George said. ""It's at the top of the Aar valley, which we are now entering. The River Aar flows through the valley, forming two long lakes - Lake Thun and Lake Brienz. Interlaken sits between the two lakes, not far from each other."" An hour later, the travelers sat on a steamer deck, admiring the stunning view of the mountains on both sides of the lake. Rollo was captivated by the landscape, observing forests, fields, Swiss cottages, and steep slopes. The snow-capped peaks peeked through the mountains, occasionally hidden by floating clouds. As they sailed, Rollo also noticed other tourists on board, including students with backpacks and families enjoying the scenic journey. The misty clouds eventually obscured the mountains, creating a serene view of the lake. On the morning after reaching Interlaken, Rollo was surprised to find no grand Alpine scenery from his window."|['1.

In front of the house was a garden with a wide gravel path leading to the road. Along the path were flower beds on each side. There were also side entrances wide enough for roads, with grand gates a little way from the hotel. The main road in front of the house was level, and a few Swiss peasants in unique outfits passed by. Beyond, there were lush fields with fruit and forest trees interspersed, creating a beautiful view. The sky was cloudy but bright, with the sun peeking through. Rollo left his room and entered a corridor with stone floors and staircases leading to different levels. Peering out of a back window, he saw the hotel gardens, a rushing stream, and a rocky precipice. The sight of a green tree among the clouds left Rollo amazed and eager to show his uncle.|['1.

Rollo was amazed by the breathtaking view he saw from the window where Mr. George stood. The clouds had parted to reveal picturesque scenes of lush green pastures, charming villages, and dark forests with snow-capped peaks. Mr. George explained that skilled hunters pursued chamois, nimble goat-like creatures, up treacherous mountain slopes. He recounted a daring expedition where six hunters conquered the Jungfrau, a challenging climb of fifteen miles. Mr. George pointed out the Wengern Alp, a mountain near the Jungfrau, offering a close-up view of the majestic peak. He described a valley, the Lütschine, leading towards the Jungfrau, with a fork where the valley split into two paths. One path led to Lauterbrunnen, known for glaciers, while the other led to Grindelwald, famous for its cascading waterfalls.|[]|[]
Mr. George explained the journey to the Wengern Alp, a mountainous area. The route required turning right towards Lauterbrunnen, then switching to horses for the steep path to the alp. The trek would take several hours, offering views of the Jungfrau and avalanches. After exploring, they would descend to the Grindelwald valley. Meanwhile, Rollo observed various activities outside the hotel, including a carriage arrival with travelers, a flock of goats with melodious bells, and German students on a walking tour. Later, a char à banc, a narrow one-horse carriage, arrived. The students, goats, and travelers added life to the surroundings, creating a vibrant scene outside the hotel.|"['1.

The carriage stopped in front of the hotel, and a distinguished man alighted. Rollo watched from his uncle's room as the man entered the hotel after giving instructions about his luggage. Curious, Rollo decided to go downstairs for a closer look. He observed the unique attire of the guests and the unfamiliar languages being spoken. Outside, guides were negotiating mountain excursions with travelers. Intrigued, Rollo followed a path to an adjoining wing of the hotel. Inside, he found a grand drawing room filled with people conversing. The polished wooden floor gleamed under the morning light streaming through the windows. In the adjacent room, guests were enjoying breakfast. Rollo ordered a meal of steak, rolls, honey, and coffee, while nearby, two men planned their Swiss adventure over a map.|"[""1.

Mr. George quickly joined Rollo at the char à banc, and the waiter soon served their breakfast. Rollo especially enjoyed the honey. They were about to embark on an expedition up the valley of the Lütschine to Lauterbrunnen and then ascend the Wengern Alp to witness the Jungfrau avalanches. Eager to begin, Rollo and his uncle were ready to set off. The guide would take them to Lauterbrunnen in the char à banc and then send it back down the valley, eventually meeting them in Grindelwald. As they departed, Mr. George had a carpet bag with nightdresses in case they decided to spend the night on the mountain.

Rollo and his companion Henry journeyed through a narrow valley flanked by imposing cliffs and a swift river, the Lütschine. The scenery was breathtaking, with bridges, mills, and Swiss cottages dotting the landscape. As they approached a fork in the valley, a colossal precipice blocked their way, but the road split into two paths. Rollo pointed left, indicating the route to Grindelwald. The valley grew wilder, with steep mountainsides, forests, and rocky slopes. Waterfalls cascaded down the cliffs, adding life to the rugged terrain. Rollo recounted crossing a bridge and exploring the riverbank, where he discovered natural springs gushing from the ground. The journey was filled with awe-inspiring sights and natural wonders, making the adventure both thrilling and educational for the young travelers.|"['1.

As our explorers chatted about their journey, they arrived at Lauterbrunnen, a quaint village with a cozy inn at its center. The valley's highlight, the impressive Staubach waterfall, captured their attention. This majestic cascade tumbled down a towering cliff in a continuous stream, creating a breathtaking sight. Rollo and Mr. George admired the waterfall and the smaller ones adorning the valley's walls as they rode in a carriage towards the inn. Eager locals offered minerals and flowers for sale, hoping to guide the travelers. Passing by picturesque huts and encountering tourists returning from the waterfall, they stumbled upon a shop selling intricate carved souvenirs. Rollo purchased Swiss cottages and a unique nutcracker, relishing the memories of their Swiss adventure.|"['1.

Mr. George and Rollo admired the immense waterfall, but the spray made it impossible to get closer without getting wet. They retreated to dry land and marveled at the cataract. Afterward, they enjoyed dinner at the inn. Henry, their guide, prepared for the mountain ascent, suggesting they share one horse to save money. Rollo eagerly mounted the horse as they began the steep climb, with Henry's help ensuring their safety. The path zigzagged up the mountain, offering breathtaking views of the valley below. Rollo wanted to pause frequently to admire the scenery, but they had to keep moving to keep up with Mr. George, who climbed swiftly. The ascent was challenging, with the horse navigating rocky terrain. Despite the physical demands, Rollo's excitement and wonder never waned on their adventure.|"['1.

After climbing for about thirty minutes, Mr. George paused at a spot with a smooth stone to rest. Rollo caught up, and Mr. George helped him off the horse to take a break. The view of the valley from this point was breathtaking. Rollo could see the village, the inn, little cottages, a river, and more, all looking tiny from above. Across the way, the Staubach waterfall cascaded over the cliffs, with a vast expanse of mountains beyond. After a rest and enjoying the view, they continued. Rollo suggested walking, but Mr. George preferred he ride to conserve his energy for the challenging climb ahead. As they ascended, the scenery became more majestic. At one point, they saw a girl with a basket coming up the path, prompting Rollo to wonder about her purpose.|"['1.

Rollo tried to look up to find his uncle but feared falling off his horse. He stopped and chatted without turning. In Switzerland, locals greet strangers on the mountains, unlike in other places where they pass silently. The solitude and grandeur of the mountains make people friendlier in Switzerland. Rollo noticed Ninette's basket and how it was attached to her back. The basket was small at the bottom and widened at the top to fit her shoulders. Straps made of carved wood secured it to her back and shoulders. They decided not to buy the basket but asked to purchase the straps. Ninette's father agreed to sell the straps at his cottage. The group reached Ninette's hamlet, bought the straps, enjoyed milk, and continued their journey.

Both travelers were content with the change in scenery. The road now offered an easier journey than before, with the steepest part of the ascent conquered. The path meandered over rolling terrain, gradually ascending. Cattle grazed in the fields, surrounded by scattered huts where peasants lived during the summer. These high pastures, lush in summer, were deserted in winter due to heavy snow and fierce storms. Passing forests and woodcutters at work, the travelers collected Alpine wood for a souvenir. They encountered cheerful peasant girls dancing down the mountain with flowers. As misty clouds gathered, a thunderous sound echoed from the rocky precipice of Jungfrau, covered in snow. The travelers paused to admire the majestic sight, grateful for the obscured view that made the spectacle even more breathtaking.|['1.

As the sun began to set, the group arrived at the inn. Rollo, a bit tired but invigorated by the excitement of the journey and the unique surroundings, pressed on. The clouds partially obscured the mountain views, but the rocky terrain, vegetation, and lingering snow patches left by winter captivated Rollo, evoking wonder and awe. The inn resembled a log cabin, perched on a small area jutting out from the steep mountainside facing the Jungfrau peak. The descent in front led to a deep ravine, while behind the inn, a green slope with Alpine flowers rose to a rounded summit. The rustic inn had a small porch with a bench and table. A sudden avalanche confirmed their mountainous location, adding to the awe-inspiring atmosphere. Inside, a cozy sitting room with Swiss scenery decor welcomed them. Hungry and weary, they secured rooms, finding simple yet comfortable accommodations.|"[""1.

Rollo, being thoughtful, realized that the food in the house was scarce and had been brought up the steep paths from the valleys below. He selected a delicious dinner of broiled chicken, fried potatoes, eggs, fresh bread, and honey. They drank water and ended with French coffee diluted with rich milk. As they finished, a lady's delight drew their attention to a stunning view of the Jungfrau mountain being revealed as the clouds lifted. Everyone at the inn marveled at the sight. Rollo and Mr. George, captivated by the mountain, joined by other guests, watched as a snowfall created thunderous echoes down the slopes.

During their mountain hike, Mr. George and Rollo encountered steep slopes and patches of snow. Rollo's horse, startled by the snow patch covering the path, tried to turn back. Despite Rollo's efforts to control the horse, it backed off the edge, causing them both to tumble down the slope. Luckily, the grassy terrain prevented any serious harm. After a brief rest to admire the Jungfrau mountain and watch avalanches, they returned to the inn. Later, they embarked on a journey to Grindelwald, navigating through hills, ravines, and snow patches. Along the way, Rollo faced a perilous situation on a narrow path beside a snow-covered edge, where his horse's unexpected actions led to a tumble down the slope.|"['1.

Rollo and his guide, Henry, had a thrilling adventure while exploring a mountain path. Rollo found himself rolling down a slope, narrowly avoiding a collision with a horse. After a brief pause, they continued their journey. They encountered mountain huts where locals lived during the summer months, making butter and cheese. Rollo heard echoes created by a man blowing a trumpet-like pole. They also witnessed a man attempting to trigger an avalanche with a cannon, a common tale in the region. As they descended towards Grindelwald, they marveled at the vast glaciers and fertile valleys below. The villagers welcomed them with milk, nuts, and minerals for sale.

Rollo once encountered three children selling intricately carved Swiss cottages along the roadside. These miniature wooden creations were meticulously crafted and boxed for safekeeping. Some children begged for alms, while others with disabilities sought charity. Rollo found that even a small donation brought immense joy to those in need. The group reached Grindelwald, staying at an inn with a view of glaciers. The next day, they explored the glaciers, marveling at the slow-moving rivers of ice. Glaciers, originating in icy mountain regions, flow down into warmer valleys, melting as they advance. The surface, covered in streams and crevasses, creates a stunning spectacle. The group witnessed chunks of ice breaking off the glacier's edge, illustrating the glacier's continuous movement.|"['1.

Glaciers are constantly moving, and there are direct ways to prove this. Philosophers once marked a large rock on a glacier's surface with red paint and two other rocks on the glacier's shore in a straight line. Over time, they found that the central rock had moved forward, showing that the glacier was in motion. You can even hear glaciers moving when standing on them. Glaciers have ridges of rocks and stones called moraines on their edges, formed by rocks that break off from the mountains nearby. These moraines can be colossal barriers that are difficult to cross. One impressive glacier, the Sea of Ice, near Mont Blanc, is vast and can be accessed from Montauvert, a promontory offering a stunning view of the glacier and the beautiful valley of Chamouni.|"[""1.

Rollo faced a setback during his return when he lost his pike staff. The staff slipped from his grasp while he was navigating the rocky terrain, plummeting down into a deep abyss on the glacier. Despite this, Rollo and Mr. George encountered challenges crossing the moraine to reach the glacier. Once on the glacier, they found it easy to walk, akin to strolling on wet snow in spring. The sparkling waters of little streams and vast crevasses caught their attention. They amused themselves by tossing stones into the deep crevasses. The glacier was strewn with rocks and stones, some as massive as houses, perched on pedestals of ice due to the sun's differential melting effect. Guides carry ropes and ladders on glacier excursions for safety, aiding in rescues from crevasses or slippery slopes. Ladders help navigate low precipices, while hatchets are used to cut steps in ice for climbing steep ascents.|"['1.

Mr. George and Rollo spent their day exploring the glacier and mountains around Chamouni. They returned to the inn in the evening tired and hungry but delighted by the rest and food awaiting them. The next morning, Rollo found his uncle puzzling over a map. They discussed a journey to Lucerne, with Rollo eager to organize the trip. Mr. George challenged Rollo to plan the journey without needing his help, offering a reward if successful. Rollo eagerly accepted the challenge. While Mr. George wrote letters, Rollo studied the map on the balcony, enjoying the stunning view of the valley, mountains, and waterfalls. He occasionally used a spyglass to observe other travelers. After a focused half-hour, Rollo closed the map, pleased with his progress.|['1.

Rollo was hopeful that his uncle would inquire about the route, giving him a chance to showcase his knowledge. However, Mr. George remained silent, prompting Rollo to seek out the landlord. Mr. George explained that he wanted to enjoy the journey without any worries, leaving Rollo to handle the preparations independently. Unlike some adults who assist children in tasks, Mr. George made sure Rollo was capable before entrusting him with responsibilities. Rollo appreciated this approach. A courier in Europe is a traveling servant who manages all aspects of a journey, allowing travelers to relax. The guide arrived, prepared the horse, and loaded the luggage. They set off on a pleasant road, gradually ascending. Rollo eventually found his uncle reading by a beautiful path leading towards the mountains, passing by fields and groves. Two girls from a cottage caught their attention before running ahead.|"['1.

Two girls ran ahead of the travelers and placed boards over shallow brooks to make bridges. Rollo and Mr. George found the girls and rewarded them for their effort. As they continued, the road wound up the mountain, offering magnificent views. After a long ascent, they reached a resting spot with a beautiful view. Rollo planned to hire a carriage in a village called Lungern to take them to the lake. The guide then carried the baggage on his back down the steep path. At an inn, Rollo and Mr. George enjoyed Alpine milk and admired carved sculptures. Rollo bought a model of a chalet, a shepherd's hut, for his collection.|"['1.

In about thirty minutes, the guide signaled that it was time to continue the journey. The group set off once more, with the guide leading the way. He skillfully balanced the luggage on the rack behind him, using a sturdy staff to navigate the steep and rocky terrain. Some parts of the path were treacherous, requiring climbing rather than walking. Rollo, at times, felt a sense of fear. The narrow path bordered by sheer rock walls and roaring cataracts added to the challenge. As they descended, the landscape transitioned to a picturesque valley with mountains and charming cottages. They encountered a quaint chapel commemorating a significant event, offering a tranquil resting spot for travelers. After a brief rest, they resumed their journey, descending further until the village of Lungern and a welcoming inn came into view.|['1.

Mr. George and Rollo had an enjoyable boat ride from Lungern to Lucerne. The day was perfect, with breathtaking views of valleys, cascades, forests, lakes, and mountains. Rollo paid the carriage driver and arranged for a boat to Lucerne. The boatman, with his two daughters, rowed them across the smooth lake. As they sailed, dark clouds gathered, and thunder rumbled. The boatman, speaking German, indicated a storm approaching. They safely reached the shore just as the rain began. Mr. George and Rollo hurried to an inn, leaving the boatman and his daughters to secure the boat.
