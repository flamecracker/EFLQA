Tom admitted that the person acting suspiciously might be the one Mr. Track was looking for. He mentioned that the lad in question did not look in the window or knock on the glass. Another witness near White's grocery store confirmed that the lad was innocent. The commotion settled down, and it was evident that Mr. Track was not robbed. Tom, the young inventor, was skeptical about Mr. Jenks, who claimed to have made diamonds. Tom did not expect to meet Mr. Jenks again due to his eccentric behavior.

"Tom was startled by the sound outside the window. ""Could that be hail?"" he wondered, peering out. Concerned about possible damage to the airship shed skylights, he decided to investigate. Mr. Jenks, speaking calmly, cautioned Tom about the potential danger involved. Tom, intrigued by Mr. Jenks' claim of knowing how to create diamonds, was skeptical. Mr. Jenks warned Tom that learning the secret might lead to danger but also offered a beautiful stone as proof. He shared a story about encountering a stranger in New York City years ago, which led to his current quest. Tom invited Mr. Jenks to his private workshop to hear more, ensuring their conversation wouldn't disturb others.

I felt moved by a man's appearance and helped him with some money. Surprisingly, he returned later, now as a skilled diamond setter, wanting to repay me. He mentioned a place where diamonds could be created using both science and nature. Skeptical at first, he convinced me with details. He and his friends, diamond cutters, had a spot in the Rocky Mountains where they made small but flawless diamonds. Lacking funds for materials, they separated temporarily to work and save. I agreed to fund their venture in exchange for a share in the diamond-making process. We embarked on a journey to Phantom Mountain, a mysterious location in the Rockies near Indian Ridge.

"Next, they requested a significant amount of money from me, which I had pledged after they demonstrated their ability to produce diamonds. I declined until I could witness some of the gemstones, and they agreed to this condition, but mentioned I would have to wait a few days.

During that period, I was essentially confined in the cave, learning only that it was located in a vast mountain range, near a peak called Phantom Mountain. The leader of the diamond makers, Folwell, informed me one stormy night that I could observe the diamond-making process. They had been preparing their chemicals for days. In a small chamber, I saw a complex apparatus, including a steel box with a lever.

Folwell allowed me to create diamonds myself. When I pulled the lever amid a thunderous crash, the steel box heated up. Upon cooling, it revealed white stones. Mr. Jenks displayed a dazzling diamond, one of the stones he believed he had created. Impressed, I conducted tests confirming they were diamonds and paid the agreed sum.

However, after receiving the money, they no longer needed me. I woke up in a hotel, realizing I had been deceived. Determined to seek justice, I returned East, intent on uncovering the diamond-making secret I was promised."|['1.

Tom decided to verify if the stones were genuine diamonds before discussing the opportunity to explore Phantom Mountain with his father. He wanted a second opinion from a different jeweler than Mr. Track. If the gem turned out to be authentic, Tom planned to have it set in a brooch for Mary's birthday. He intended to fly to Chester in his monoplane named Butterfly to consult another jeweler. After ensuring the plane was in good condition, Tom took off and headed towards Chester, testing wind currents along the way. As he approached the city, he decided to land outside to avoid crowds and potential disturbances. While descending, Tom noticed Andy Foger cycling on the highway and decided to play a prank on him.

Tom sought an expert opinion on two stones given to him by Mr. Jenks. He visited a store specializing in diamonds and was met with skepticism due to his appearance. The clerk took the stones to be appraised. Two elderly gentlemen appeared, one an expert named Mr. Porter. He was impressed by the stones, declaring them superior to African or Indian diamonds. The cut stone was valued at $1500, and the rough one at $2000. Tom clarified the stones were obtained legitimately and was willing to pay for the appraisal.

Tom, feeling hopeless, decided to confide in Mr. Jenks about the danger they faced. Both Mr. Damon and Mr. Parker agreed to keep the secret. Mr. Parker showed interest in the Red Cloud and praised Tom's craftsmanship without predicting any disasters. Tom revealed that Mr. Parker was introduced to him by Mr. Damon and that they were all about to embark on a new adventure.

Tom and his friends gathered in the small office to plan their departure from Shopton in a week. During this time, Tom worked tirelessly on the airship, with his father, Eradicate, and Mr. Jackson assisting with repairs. Meanwhile, Mr. Parker, the scientist, explored the area and made observations on the patented machines. One day, Mr. Parker's excitement about an impending earthquake caused some concern. However, it turned out that the rumbling was just Eradicate's hungry mule kicking in the stable. Relieved that there was no real danger, Tom was eager to continue his quest to find the diamond makers. He made sure to keep Eradicate from revealing the misunderstanding to spare Mr. Parker's feelings.|"['1.

Tom allowed his friend to have his way. The week was ending, and the Red Cloud was almost ready for the journey. Tom realized he needed some electrical tools for the airship, so he decided to fly to Chester in his monoplane. While in the city, he also planned to pick up a diamond pin he was having made for Mary Nestor. Mary warmly welcomed Tom, teasing him about apple turnovers. Tom promised to return as he left to complete his trip. The Red Cloud, a mix of a biplane and dirigible balloon, was prepared for the adventure. It could accommodate about ten people and had sleeping berths, a sitting-room, dining-room, kitchen, and more. The team was set to depart the next morning to Phantom Mountain in search of diamond makers.|"['1.

That evening, Tom felt anxious. He kept checking the shed where the airship, Red Cloud, was stored, worried that those who wanted to keep the diamond-making secret hidden might try to sabotage it. Eradicate Sampson and Engineer Jackson stayed alert. The next morning, they all rose early, with Mr. Damon admiring the sunrise. As the airship was prepared for takeoff, Tom inspected it. As he started the motor, he noticed a horse-drawn carriage approaching. A girl waved from the carriage, making Tom blush. The airship took off smoothly, and as they flew over the town, Tom searched for the girl but only saw crowds below. Mr. Damon steered the Red Cloud as Tom checked the supplies. Everything seemed fine until Tom noticed Eradicate gesturing towards the back of the airship. Despite the oddity, they continued their journey westward.|['1.

"""I believe we are heading towards a hurricane soon,"" the scientist predicted, excited at the prospect. Tom, however, remained calm, confident in the Red Cloud's abilities to navigate any storm. As they traveled, the storm had not yet arrived by noon, allowing Tom and Mr. Damon to enjoy a fine meal. The ship's speed increased in the afternoon, covering several hundred miles by night. Tom ensured the machinery ran smoothly, and they dined luxuriously. The next morning, amidst a small hurricane below, Tom discovered a stowaway on board via the wireless apparatus.

Tom and his companions were determined to capture the hidden man aboard the airship. They devised a plan to outsmart him. Tom and Mr. Damon pretended to search for food in the storeroom, engaging in a casual conversation to distract the man. As they moved deeper into the room, they spotted the hidden figure. A gunshot rang out, causing a commotion. Quickly, Mr. Parker and Mr. Jenks managed to subdue the man.

Mr. Parker messaged a scientific friend about his observations in the mountainous region where they were flying. He predicted a landslide and hoped to witness it for scientific study. Despite Tom's curiosity about Mr. Parker's interest in disasters, the scientist was excited about his predictions. As they neared Leadville, they kept the airship hidden from view. Using powerful glasses, they searched for Indian Ridge, a key location for their quest. Despite adverse weather, they continued the search. After days of scanning the area, they failed to locate the landmark. Tom suggested descending to seek information from miners.

Mr. Jenks shared a warning with Tom and his friends about the dangers of the Indian Ridge trail, infrequently traveled and easy to lose one's way on. Despite the risks, the gang had taken that path. The miner advised against going to the stone head and Phantom Mountain via Black Gulch, as it was unsafe for strangers. The airship safely reached Black Gulch following the miner's directions. As they flew over the valley, they spotted a giant's head-shaped mass of black stone. The stone head was visible only from a specific angle due to surrounding mountains. Mr. Jenks praised Tom's craft for bringing them safely past obstacles. They decided to leave the airship in a secluded valley to embark on their prospecting adventure, equipped with supplies for camping and food.

They decided to set up camp at a high altitude above the sea-level. The cool evening led them to gather around a large campfire after dinner, engaging in conversations. Tom, curious about the time, checked his watch after tending to the fire. Surprisingly, it was only a little past midnight, though it felt much later. While observing the dark mountains surrounding them, Tom noticed a mysterious figure in white descending a trail. The figure appeared tall and moved eerily, waving its arms menacingly. As the group watched in astonishment, the figure vanished into the night. Speculating that the figure might be a trick by diamond makers to scare people away, they contemplated the possibility of a hidden cave nearby with shadow projection equipment creating the illusion.|['1.

Tom expressed his skepticism about any immediate danger, believing that the mysterious figures they had seen were a warning from the diamond makers. They decided to keep a fire burning through the night to deter intruders and planned to start their search in the morning. Despite a restless night, they woke to a peaceful morning and set out on Phantom Mountain. The search for the hidden cave proved challenging as the trail disappeared the higher they climbed. Mr. Jenks speculated that they might have approached the cave from a different direction.

"""Great idea,"" Mr. Jenks agreed. ""Let's do it and relocate our camp. I just hope those guys don't stumble upon our airship and wreck it. It will be tough to return to civilization if we have to trek all the way back."" This possibility made Tom uneasy. He dreaded the thought of the dishonest men harming the Red Cloud, which had been painstakingly built. But he realized fretting wouldn't help and tried to push it from his mind. ""I'll make some observations,"" he said, and the others didn't pay much heed to him for a while. As supper neared completion, Mr. Parker came back looking serious. Mr. Damon, noticing, joked, ""The only option is to vacate the mountain,"" he said, ""but with the iron ore stretching for miles, we can't escape the danger zone before the storm hits us. It's approaching in less than half an hour."" The meal ended swiftly, and Tom checked the tent's guy ropes, fearing wind with the storm. The storm approached quickly, but an eerie stillness in the air was more unsettling than a gust. The campfire burned steadily, and there was a strange heaviness in the atmosphere.

A loud clap echoed through the air, followed by a massive mass of fire hurtling towards the mountain where a figure in white had stood moments earlier. The ground shook as if in an earthquake, but it quickly subsided. The mountain's side crumbled and crashed into the valley below amidst lightning flashes. The noise was deafening, drowning out even the thunder. Tom and his friends, terrified, shouted to each other but could barely hear over the chaos. The tumult eventually faded, leaving behind a pile of earth and stones sliding down the mountain. The electrical storm passed without rain, and Mr. Parker, unfazed, mentioned expecting such events in the region. Tom, relieved, joked about the situation. They planned to explore the mountain in the morning to assess the damage caused by the landslide and the lightning strikes.|"['1.

In the valley below, huge masses of earth and stones were piled up. Boulders and rocks were scattered all around, forming heaps, ridges, and curves as if a cyclone had played with them. Mr. Jenks, Tom, and Mr. Damon gazed up at the mountain's summit, where they suspected the cave to be. After a quick meal, they decided to embark on the perilous journey. As the sun rose, a rosy light revealed a narrow pathway along the mountain's edge, created by a previous landslide. Despite its dangers, they pressed on, navigating the treacherous ledge. Determined to locate the cave, they resolved to continue their quest, armed with only their courage and a couple of revolvers for protection. The trio set off, facing the challenges of the steep and risky trail, inching closer to their goal.|"['1.

As they ascended higher and higher along the narrow path, the group marveled at the breathtaking views. The trail at times widened enough for two to walk comfortably side by side, only to narrow to a mere ribbon shortly after. Peering cautiously into the chasm on their left, filled with rocks hurled by lightning, they felt a shiver of fear. Suddenly, a broad pathway cut into the living rock came into view, prompting a joyous shout from the young inventor. Rushing to his side, his companions noticed his excitement about a clump of bushes and trees. Yet, it was not the foliage that captivated them but the sight of a vast cavern resembling a tunnel hidden behind the greenery. Tom's hand instinctively reached for his revolver, while Mr. Jenks attempted to draw his weapon, halted by one of the armed men.

The man snapped, refusing to answer about the lightning. Tom agreed to leave, spotting a second trail from the cave's far side. He believed there was another way in. Mr. Parker noticed a metal rod on the cave's roof. The spokesman angrily told them to leave the private ground. As they descended, they discussed the cave.

Tom was excited about the opportunity to explore the cave. He knew they had to go back to camp to plan and hurry before it got dark. After a quick lunch and a drink from a spring, they returned to find everything in order. Mr. Jenks didn't think the ghost would come down the dangerous trail at night. As Tom gathered wood near the fire, he noticed the phantom descending the mountain. He devised a plan, and with the help of his friends, they captured the ghost in white.

They all panted from the run up the mountain and the fight with the phantom, now revealed as a man. Surprisingly, the struggle was less intense than Tom had anticipated. Mr. Jenks, determined to uncover the truth, suggested tying up the man and taking him back to camp. The man, unfazed, offered to cooperate, admitting he had no weapon. Mr. Damon, taken aback by the man's calm demeanor, complied with his request. The man confessed to creating the ghostly illusion to scare away intruders. Recognizing him as Renshaw, a former acquaintance from the diamond cave, Mr. Jenks explained their history. Renshaw, tired of his role, revealed he was not benefiting from the diamond profits and expressed a desire to mend their friendship.|"['1.

Mr. Jenks spoke with the former phantom, Bill Renshaw, who had been deceived by the diamond makers. Bill revealed how they took his money, drugged him, and left him in a cave. Feeling betrayed, he agreed to help Mr. Jenks and his friends enter the cave secretly. Bill knew of a hidden entrance that the diamond makers were unaware of. He agreed to guide them and even offered assistance in case of a confrontation.

Bill explained how he had the freedom to come and go as he pleased on the mountain. His main tasks were to watch over the two sides of the mountain, play the ghost to scare off intruders, and leave messages. He shared that he sometimes stayed out on the mountain for days, leaving the impression that he was camping out when he took supplies. Bill revealed a secret trail that led to a cave where he planned to hide his companions. The group was near the summit, overlooking a beautiful valley. Bill then led them with a lantern into a cavern where they heard a muffled noise.

Excited, the explorers peered into the cavern. Unnoticed by the workers, they busily tended to a grinding machine. The noise from the machine allowed Tom and his friends to converse freely. The ingredients were ground into a powdery substance. “This is the initial step,” Mr. Jenks remarked. The powdered chemicals were partially baked, then placed in a steel box. The next stage involved applying intense heat and pressure to create diamonds. “It's the power of lightning bolts!” Mr. Parker whispered. The adventurers realized the purpose of the isolated mountain location. “They use lightning to make diamonds!” Tom exclaimed.

The scientist explained that creating gems like diamonds requires great heat and pressure, usually found in volcanic fires and immense rocks. However, a new method was being attempted using lightning's heat and instant pressure. The men prepared to make the gems in a steel box connected to electric wires. Despite the danger, the group watched as the process began. A nerve-racking crash followed as the mountain seemed to tremble. The steel box glowed red-hot, then cooled. When opened, the white balls inside had transformed into sparkling diamonds.

"""Bill warned, 'Leave now if you want to stay safe and not uncover more secrets.' He suspected the group was up to no good. Mr. Jenks insisted on staying to learn the diamond-making process. Tom Swift agreed it was safe since the group thought they were tied up. The adventurers observed the diamond-making process again. The storm approached, evident from the loud thunder. The diamond makers prepared for the intense storm. They stood on insulated platforms. The storm's power doubled, promising more diamonds. The storm raged outside, causing the ground to shake. The adventurers watched, eager to understand the process. The group braced for the storm, anticipating a successful diamond-making session."""|"[""1.

A blue light flickered around the electrical wires, filling the air with a sulfur smell. Loud crashes echoed outside, and a flash of flame illuminated the cave from a copper switch. Suddenly, a deafening crash shook the cave, engulfing the switch area in blue flames. Wires and copper connections scattered as the steel box for making diamonds turned blue and spewed flames. Tom Swift and his friends fled as electrical fire spread. Remembering a past narrow escape, they raced out of the cave, dodging lightning-like sparks. The group left behind the machinery used to make diamonds, the cave now a dangerous lightning zone. Seeking insulated ground due to the iron ore-rich mountain, they dashed through a small opening to daylight, narrowly escaping lightning strikes.|['1.

"""We need to leave immediately! This is the heart of the storm. Once it crosses the mountain, where the lightning rod stands, all the electrical energy will discharge in a single strike at the mountain, destroying it! We must flee, but stick to the dirt paths! Run for safety!"" Suddenly, a deafening crash shook the earth, feeling like doomsday had arrived. Tom and his friend were thrown to the ground, dazed by the terrifying sound. The mountain glowed with blue, red, and green flashes, then crumbled, including the diamond makers' cave they had escaped from moments earlier. Disappointed that the diamond-making equipment and gems were lost, Tom and Mr. Jenks were grateful to be alive. After enduring hardships, they neared their camp by the Red Cloud, finding an old miner nearby. The miner, Abe Abercrombie, proposed a venture to a gold mine in Alaska accessible only by airship, offering to share the riches if they joined him."|['1.
