Once a boy with a toothache met Uncle Wiggily, a kind rabbit. The boy's pain lessened as he laughed at funny stories told by a cricket and Uncle Wiggily.

The elephant explained why he ran away - the children ate all the peanuts meant for him. Uncle Wiggily stayed with the monkey that night, while the elephant slept outside under an apple tree. The elephant snored so loudly that all the apples fell off the tree, and the monkey made an apple pie. The next day, Uncle Wiggily and the elephant set off together, talking about the weather and ice cream cones. The elephant went to get ice cream, leaving Uncle Wiggily behind. As Uncle Wiggily hopped through the woods, a big dog appeared and chased him towards a lake. Despite the dog's warnings, Uncle Wiggily fell into the water.

"""No, don't do that, you might accidentally bite him,"" said the elephant. He then laid down the ice cream cones and used his trunk to drink up all the water from the lake, turning it into dry land so the rabbit could safely walk to shore. Grateful, the rabbit thanked the elephant as they enjoyed their treats. The elephant then showed his strength by pulling up a tree but quickly replanted it upon realizing a bird's nest was in it. To help the robin, the elephant built a bridge over the river using fallen trees. Later, feeling ill, the elephant was comforted by Uncle Wiggily, who covered him with leaves and went to fetch a doctor.

Once upon a time, Uncle Wiggily the rabbit and his friend, the prickly porcupine, were walking through the woods when a big snake hissed at them. The porcupine bravely defended Uncle Wiggily by sticking quills into the snake, making it slither away. As they sat down to eat lunch on toadstools, a crashing sound startled them. An alligator burst out of a bush, chasing them. Quick thinking by the porcupine saved Uncle Wiggily by making a toadstool grow tall, lifting him out of reach. A dog-policeman then scared the alligator away, allowing Uncle Wiggily to safely descend. Grateful for the toadstool's help, they continued their journey through the woods.|"['1.

Uncle Wiggily and his porcupine friend were having breakfast before embarking on their journey. The porcupine made sure to wipe his face and paws after the rabbit, to avoid leaving his prickly quills on the towel. As they set off, they encountered a noisy locust on a tree limb. The porcupine wisely suggested staying in the shade to avoid the hot sun. This decision proved crucial when they narrowly escaped a snake lurking in the shadows. The porcupine readied his quills, but the snake slithered away. Just as they thought they were safe, a muddy little chickie emerged from the bushes, lost and in tears.

The robin explained her predicament to the kittie-cat, mentioning her husband's unemployment and her own illness, which left her unable to remove the cowbird eggs from her nest. The kittie-cat then asked the robin to point out the cowbird eggs, which she did using her claw. The kittie-cat then clawed the cowbird eggs out of the nest to prevent them from hatching. When the cowbird returned and saw her eggs on the ground, she tried to attack the kittie-cat, but Uncle Wiggily intervened by tickling the cowbird with his crutch.
