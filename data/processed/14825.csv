Long before men awoke to the vision of America, the Old World saw significant migrations. The Goths, Huns, Saracens, Turks, and Tatars threatened European civilization. However, these migrations were incomparable to the massive exodus of European peoples to the United States. Starting with the English in Virginia in 1607, millions sought opportunities in the New World. The English expansion was driven by economic motives, seeking self-sufficiency and trade control. England's imperial ambitions led to expeditions to North America. Richard Hakluyt's descriptions of America's resources fueled English optimism. Despite early setbacks, the English colonies in America thrived, maintaining English customs, laws, and governance. The colonies attracted non-English settlers, mainly from the British Isles, shaping the diverse population of the New World.|"['1.

During a period of significant change in England, colonies were established in America. Dissent between churchmen and dissenters, struggles between autocracy and representative systems, and a clash between agrarianism and capitalism marked this era. Attempts to maintain the old order through labor laws and poor laws failed, leading to an increase in vagrants and beggars. Many believed England was overpopulated, prompting the restless and discontented to seek opportunities in the New World. Southern colonies attracted those seeking land ownership for economic and social advancement. In contrast, the northern colonies were settled by a middle class focused on trade and industry. Towns were built, trade prospered, and educational institutions like Harvard were established. Indentured service and slavery were common, with many transported individuals rising to prominence in the colonies.|['1.

The arrival of the Scotch-Irish in the American colonies had a significant impact on the nation's development. These hardy people transformed the wild moorlands of Ulster into flourishing towns and successful manufacturing centers for linens and woolens. However, when England passed laws to stifle their trade, many Ulster artisans lost their jobs, prompting a mass migration to America. Most settled in Pennsylvania, but some also made their way to Maryland and Virginia. The Scotch-Irish were known for pushing to the frontier, claiming territories from Georgia to New York. Similarly, political upheavals in Scotland led to migrations to the colonies, with many settling in the Carolinas and Maryland. In contrast, German communities like the Mennonites and Moravians brought their unique religious practices to America, contributing to the nation's cultural diversity.|['1.

"In 1717, many German peasants were tricked by shady agents called ""new-landers"" to move to America. These agents, also known as ""soul-stealers,"" convinced the peasants to sell their belongings, gather money, and migrate to America. Upon arrival, these immigrants were sold to ""soul-drivers"" who took them inland and made them work for farmers, often from their own country. These immigrants, known as redemptioners, served for several years and were granted land afterward. French Protestants fled to England and Holland after Louis XIV revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, with many eventually settling in America. Similarly, Jews arrived early in New York, with a synagogue established in Manhattan by 1691. The English faced challenges from the Dutch and French in establishing control over the Atlantic coast, leading to a diverse and cosmopolitan population in the American colonies."|"['1.

"In history, diverse races have shaped America's society. Men of different backgrounds tamed the wilderness, united the nation, explored more land, and toiled for the town's prosperity. They built homes, worked in forges, traded, and instilled values in their children. The term ""American"" reflects this rich history, originating from Martin Waldseemüller's 1507 suggestion to name the New World after Amerigo Vespucci. Over time, the term expanded to include the entire continent. Today, ""American"" denotes belonging to the United States, despite its geographical and ethnic complexities. The original American stock, formed during the Revolution, united diverse races into a nation through shared experiences, language, religion, law, and struggles for independence.

The nationality of the white population was distributed among the States based on historical records. Some original States like New Jersey, Delaware, and Georgia, as well as the new States of Kentucky and Tennessee, were missing from the records. Estimates were made to fill in the gaps for these States. For Delaware, the Second Census records from 1800 were used due to minimal population changes. The report mentions that the composition of the white population of Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee is unknown but likely similar to the neighboring States due to historical settlement patterns. The calculations for the entire country in 1790 show a breakdown of nationalities, with the English being the largest group. While estimating nationality based on surnames has limitations due to name modifications over time, it provides insights into the British and non-British elements in the American population.|['1.

During the time of American independence, the population in the United States was mainly of British descent. The influence of British culture, language, and laws was significant in shaping the nation. The colonists were a blend of Scottish, English, Welsh, and Irish ancestry, creating a hardy and self-assertive population. Despite drifting away from religious and commercial ties with Britain, they retained British legal and institutional systems. The population grew rapidly due to the fecundity of the native stock, with families having many children. The settlers, primarily of American descent, expanded westward, settling new territories and building the nation. The American pioneers were nation builders who paved the way for future generations, establishing communities, schools, and churches. The influx of immigrants in the 1830s found a well-established society in America, thanks to the efforts of the American pioneers.|"['1.

The American frontiersman was driven by an unexplainable urge to move constantly westward, never looking back. This restlessness was not due to laziness or boredom, but a deep dissatisfaction and ambition for a great National Destiny. Many pioneers, like Abraham Lincoln's father, settled in various places before reaching their final destination, transforming the land as they went. This restlessness continued even after a century of exploration, with families moving across the country, preparing territories for statehood. The mingling of American stock with other nationalities, especially from Great Britain, shaped the demographics of the United States. Despite the influx of immigrants, the American stock has maintained itself, although the birth rate among foreign-born individuals is higher. The American people have adapted to changing conditions, influencing their ability to rear children.|"['1.

The challenge of identifying cultural influences becomes significantly harder when transitioning from the physical to the mental domain. The intricate interactions of subtle forces and responses from the surroundings defy measurement. Leadership, however, seems to be a gift bestowed upon only a few races. In the United States, success in business, politics, literature, and education predominantly links back to American roots. A study by Henry Cabot Lodge in 1891 analyzed notable figures from Appleton's _Cyclopedia of American Biography_. The analysis revealed that a vast majority of influential figures in various fields had American ancestry. While the immigrant population has begun to impact American politics, the essence of American traditions like freedom, enterprise, and individual responsibility continues to define the nation's identity. The amalgamation of diverse backgrounds under the American ethos fosters a broader perspective and a shared intelligence among its people, as noted by a French journalist observing American soldiers during World War I.|"['1.

"Not long ago, a traveler was drawn into a London music hall by a sign advertising ""Spirited American Singing and Dancing."" Onstage, black-faced comedians sang darky ragtime, danced the clog and cakewalk, and shared negro stories to the audience's delight. The performance showcased the negro's melodies, dialect, and banjo, all closely associated with America even in Europe. The negro, a foreign element in America, belongs to a different racial evolution era, contrasting the white man's habitat. The dramatic encounters between the two races, from kidnapping to emancipation, have been tragic due to their vast racial differences.

Slavery in America began with the kidnapping of individuals from various African tribes. Tillinghast described the diverse origins of these enslaved people, ranging from the Wolofs and Fulans of Senegambia to the Tshis, Ewes, and Yorubans from the Slave Coast. Despite their tribal differences, the harsh new environment of slavery erased these distinctions as they toiled together. Slavery became established in every American colony by 1665, with each colony enacting its own slave codes. In Virginia and South Carolina, strict laws were imposed on slaves, leading to brutal consequences for those who rebelled. While New York and New England had fewer slaves, Pennsylvania also had a significant slave population. Protests against slavery emerged, leading some states to emancipate their slaves before the Revolution. The industrial revolution in England increased the demand for cotton, making the South a prime region for cotton production and relying heavily on enslaved labor.|['1.

Slavery in the South was initially justified economically and morally, but it evolved into a fiercely defended institution. The cotton kingdom adamantly rejected interference, leading to a feudality rooted in profit and protected by slave owners' political power. Enslaved individuals faced severe restrictions on marriage and were treated as property by society. Insurrections only resulted in harsher laws and punishments, prompting many slaves to seek freedom through escape. They navigated dangerous routes, such as the Appalachian ranges and the Mississippi Valley, towards the North and Canada, aided by the Underground Railway. The increase in free blacks in the North led to discriminatory laws, despite growing sympathy for runaway slaves. The slave trade thrived due to the demand for cotton, with illegal importation continuing despite laws prohibiting it. By 1860, the United States had over four million slaves, with only a small fraction being free.|['1.

The Freedmen's Bureau, established in 1865, aimed to assist newly freed slaves in gaining self-reliance, navigating wage contracts, and accessing education and healthcare. Despite its limited duration and challenges from various groups, it played a crucial role in the post-Civil War period. The Bureau's efforts were met with suspicion and criticism, but it laid the groundwork for future educational initiatives and support for the freedmen. After its dissolution, private organizations and volunteers continued some of its work, but the absence of a centralized authority hindered progress. The economic struggles faced by freedmen led many to seek salvation through agriculture, starting as laborers and eventually progressing to land ownership. This evolution reflected the challenges and progress made by African Americans in the aftermath of slavery.|"[""1.

Most African American farmers are sharecroppers or metayers, working the land independently by paying a portion of the crop as rent. If they lack capital, they resort to crop-lienage, where a merchant provides supplies in exchange for a mortgage on the crop. However, some have become cash renters, gaining control over their crops. By 1910, around 900,000 African Americans achieved rural economic stability. In contrast, their transition to industrial work faced challenges. The shift to cities started post-emancipation due to dissatisfaction with landlordism and demand for labor. While many engaged in agriculture, there was a significant move to industrial cities. African Americans often worked as day laborers, porters, or domestics, lacking skilled roles. Industrial schools like Tuskegee Institute aimed to equip them for economic power and civil rights.

America has been a dreamland for many immigrants since Jamestown. It has been a place where people could experiment with various societal ideas without restrictions. These experiments, while sometimes eccentric and unsuccessful, brought many foreigners to America. Some of these communal colonies thrived for a while, but eventually faded away. The colonies were of two types: religious and economic. The religious groups, mostly from Germany, combined unique beliefs with communal living. For instance, the Labadists settled in Delaware in 1684, but within fifteen years, the colony dwindled to just eight men. Another example is the Pietists, who settled near Germantown, Pennsylvania, under the guidance of Johann Kelpius. They were known for their skills in teaching, crafts, and astrology. Despite their influence, these communities did not last long after the death of their leaders.|['1.

The Dunkards, settling in Pennsylvania in 1719, were joined by Conrad Beissel a few years later. Beissel, seeking a monastic life, meditated in solitude and believed the seventh day should be a day of rest. This belief led to friction within the Dunkards, prompting Beissel to found the cloister of Ephrata in 1728. The community flourished, with Beissel's leadership fostering a communal life of piety and labor. Ephrata's excellence in paper, printing, and music drew acclaim. Beissel's chorals were among the first in America, and his school attracted pupils from afar. After Beissel's death, his successor maintained the order before eventually transitioning to a more structured management. Similar communities like the one founded by Peter Lehman at Snow Hill and the Moravians at Bethlehem thrived but eventually dissolved. The Harmonists, led by Johann Georg Rapp, established a successful communal colony in Pennsylvania, embracing celibacy and communal living. Their belief in the imminent return of the Lord and commitment to self-restraint and hard work led to their prosperity.|"[""1.

In 1814, the society sold their communal land for $100,000 and moved to Indiana. There, they built New Harmony in just one year, showcasing their craftsmanship. However, they faced challenges with malaria and neighbors, prompting another move back to Pennsylvania in 1825. The village, called Economy, was designed by Friedrich Rapp, who was an architect, poet, artist, and musician. He led the community until his death in 1834, known for his business acumen and spiritual guidance. The community spoke German and maintained German customs, but also spoke English. Despite declining membership, the community grew wealthy from oil, coal, mills, and investments. By 1892, they faced debts but were able to pay them off through their industrial ventures. The remaining members were allowed to stay in Economy to live out their days. Another group from Württemberg founded Zoar in Ohio in 1817, living a communal life focused on work and singing, with limited leisure time.|['1.

In 1832, the society was officially formed in Ohio under the leadership of Joseph Bimeler, who became the community's spiritual and natural leader. Despite some Germans joining, no Americans sought membership. Bimeler's blend of education, spirituality, and shrewdness led the community to prosperity. They established various industries like a flour mill, woolen mill, and pottery works. The village's famous beer and quaint products garnered attention until larger competitors took over. By 1884, the village became more worldly with the arrival of a railroad and summer visitors. Eventually, in 1898, the younger generation decided to abandon communism, leading to the distribution of property among members. Despite the modest financial return, the community found years of contentment and moderate success in their communal living experiment.|"[""1.

"In the mid-1800s, a group of peasants and artisans, inspired to seek a better life, established the Ebenezer Society in New York. Faced with distractions from nearby Buffalo, they later moved to Iowa and founded Amana, a community of five villages. The society, guided by Christian principles, lived a simple life, following the teachings of the Bible with great devotion. They maintained a close-knit community under the leadership of the ""Great Council of the Brethren."" Despite encouraging celibacy, marriages were allowed with approval, and communal living was a key aspect. Members received bonuses and credits for work done in communal kitchens and stores.

The story of Eric Janson and his followers who established the Bishop Hill Colony in Illinois is filled with dramatic and tragic events. Janson, a Swedish peasant, led the Devotionalists seeking religious freedom. They faced persecution and eventually fled to America to create a theocratic community. Despite hardships and illness, their faith remained strong. The community flourished, building structures and achieving prosperity. However, internal conflicts arose, leading to the tragic death of Janson. Subsequent mismanagement and financial troubles plagued the colony, culminating in a legal battle that lasted for years. The once united community disbanded, with members receiving shares of the property.

In 1862, the followers of Jacob Hutter, a Mennonite martyr, established the Old Elmspring Community in South Dakota. These German folk, similar to Quakers, faced persecution and eventually migrated to America due to their objection to military service. The community, now residing in five small settlements in South Dakota, consists of around four hundred members who lead a simple, communal life. They speak German, avoid political involvement, and sustain themselves through farming and essential crafts. These German sectarian communities significantly influenced immigration to the United States by sharing positive experiences with those back in Europe. The Shakers, led by Ann Lee, a visionary, settled in America in 1774 and established communal societies known for their celibacy, industry, and spiritual beliefs. Another notable communal experiment was the Oneida Community, founded by John Humphrey Noyes, aiming for a sin-free life through communal living and unconventional practices.|"[""1.

"In the early 19th century, American Utopias were founded on economic altruism or religion. Two groups of economic communistic experiments emerged, inspired by Robert Owen and Fourier. Owen purchased New Harmony in Indiana in 1825, attracting renowned scientists and reformers to create a new social order. However, internal conflicts led to its downfall within two years. Owen's experiment influenced other short-lived communal attempts across the United States. Fourierism, advocated by Arthur Brisbane, aimed to create phalanxes for equality and happiness. Horace Greeley supported this idea, leading to the formation of thirty-four phalanxes, most of which failed due to financial issues. Icaria, initiated by Étienne Cabet, envisioned an ideal society of plenty and equality. Cabet's book, ""Voyage en Icarie,"" inspired many to translate his vision into reality, resulting in the establishment of a real Icaria in Texas."|"['1.

In February of 1848, a group of sixty-nine carefully chosen young men left Havre as pioneers for a new land. However, their plans were disrupted by significant events. Just twenty days after their departure, the French Republic was declared, causing a shift in priorities for many. Despite this, the young volunteers reached America, facing hardships in Louisiana and Texas. They later met with Cabet and other Icarians in New Orleans. Factional differences soon arose among the idealists, leading to divisions and subdivisions within the group. Cabet's leadership was questioned, and the community faced internal conflicts. Eventually, Cabet was expelled, and the community's unity was permanently disrupted. The Icarians moved to Iowa, where they established a new settlement. Over time, disagreements led to further divisions and the eventual dissolution of the community.|['1.

In 1854, Victor Considérant, a French socialist, established a Fourieristic phalanx in Texas with support from J.B.A. Godin, a prominent figure in Fourierism in France. Another French communistic colony was founded in Silkville, Kansas, but both projects lasted only a few years. Following these French experiments, various attempts at creating idealistic communities were made in the United States. More than fifty such communities have been established since the Civil War, primarily by American groups and with limited interest from foreigners. After the Revolution, immigrants started arriving in America from Great Britain and Europe, driven by financial and political factors. In 1819, Congress mandated Customs Collectors to record passenger details, marking the government's initial efforts to document immigration. Despite underestimating actual numbers, these records hinted at the increasing immigration pressure. The first official figures from 1820 showed 8385 arrivals, with a significant portion coming from Ireland, foreshadowing a substantial Irish migration to the United States.|"[""1.

The Irish migration to America was driven by historical grievances in their homeland. Rebellion, famine, restrictive laws, and absentee landlords forced many to seek new lives. After Cromwell's rule, thousands were exiled to the West Indies, then to the Carolinas and Virginia. Post-1798 and 1803 uprisings led to more fleeing to America. Harsh laws and religious discrimination further pushed them away. The potato famine in the mid-1800s was catastrophic, causing a quarter of Ireland's population to perish. American relief efforts saved many, leading to a surge in Irish immigration. Despite hardships, Irish immigrants contributed to America before the famine, serving as soldiers and pioneers. St. Patrick's Day celebrations in Boston and New York date back to the 1700s, showing early Irish presence in the colonies.|"['1.

From 1800 to 1820, many Irish moved to America for better opportunities. In 1818, Irish immigrant associations were established in New York, Philadelphia, and Baltimore to help newcomers find work. The Irish saw America as a land of promise after the 1776 Revolution. They were drawn by economic prospects and democratic ideals.

"Hope sustained the travelers, but upon arrival, disappointment awaited. No warm welcome or job prospects greeted them. Dreams of wealth faded as they faced a mundane reality of hard work and survival. Without means to move on, they clustered in ports, filling almshouses and wandering as beggars. Unskilled and forced into labor, they struggled in an unfamiliar urban setting. Despite opportunities in the expanding infrastructure, many stayed in cities like New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. The Irish faced ridicule for their accent, poverty, and religious beliefs, sparking tensions with native Americans. The ""Know-Nothing"" party emerged, advocating for American interests.

The nativists proposed excluding paupers and criminals from immigration but this was not made law. The movement lost momentum amidst larger issues like slavery. The Irish then gained control of cities, showcasing political skills and organization. They excelled in political maneuvering, earning recognition through their distinctive brogue. Loyalty to the Union during the Civil War helped integrate them into American society, despite initial prejudices. However, the discovery of the Molly Maguires, an Irish society involved in criminal activities, revived anti-Irish sentiments. The Mollies, known for blackmail and violence, instilled fear in the anthracite coal mining region. Their reign of terror was eventually ended by an undercover Irish detective.

Pennsylvania was a popular destination for these German immigrants, who later spread across states like Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and New Jersey. They also settled in cities like Boston, New York, and Charleston. Despite maintaining their German customs, these immigrants actively supported the American Revolutionary War, contributing soldiers, leaders, and resources to the cause. Known for their self-denying thrift and hard work, German farmers were admired for their dedication to their families, land, and livestock. German mechanics excelled in various trades, becoming successful freeholders, merchants, and bankers in Pennsylvania.

After the American Revolution, some of the Hessian soldiers who fought for the British decided to stay in the United States. Many of them became farmers, while a few became teachers. They settled in German communities, avoiding areas where they faced hostility from English-speaking people. The exact number of these settlers is unknown. Around 1820, a new wave of German immigrants started arriving in the United States, continuing until the Civil War. Economic struggles and political unrest in Germany encouraged many to seek a better life in America.

During the 19th century, many Germans emigrated to America through ports like Bremen, Havre, Hamburg, and Antwerp. These emigrants faced overcrowded and unsanitary conditions on ships, where they had to provide their own food. Upon arrival in America, the Germans did not settle in coastal cities but headed west, particularly to states like Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. They brought their language and customs, forming tight-knit communities. Cities like Cincinnati and Milwaukee became German hubs, with German culture and language prevailing. The Germans cherished their traditions, maintaining German social clubs, beer gardens, and celebrating festivals with German food and drink.

The second German migration to America was diverse, consisting of peasants, artisans, working-class individuals, and intellectuals. They all shared a desire for political freedom, influenced by their experiences in Germany. While initially idealistic, their migration had a lasting impact on American life. German immigrants contributed to American aesthetics, education, and politics. They introduced new forms of art and music, influenced educational systems, and supported the Union during the Civil War. Despite some cultural clashes, like differences in Sabbath practices and beer consumption, German immigrants assimilated into American society over subsequent generations. By the late 19th century, German immigration patterns shifted towards more industrial workers, with millions arriving in the United States.

During a period of migration, Germans settled in the Western lands like the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa, and the Far West. Initially, they found work in trades and factories, and some ventured into mining. However, as these lands got occupied, later immigrants shifted towards cities. Unlike earlier migrants, these newcomers showed arrogance and criticized their new home instead of embracing opportunities. They were influenced by a Prussian spirit that favored Germany over America. German publications in the US turned pro-German, leading Congress to pass laws against them during the Great War. German pastors and professors injected pro-German sentiments, emphasizing the importance of preserving the German language and culture. The German-American League's influence was revoked, leading to a backlash against German influence in the United States.|"['1.

"For more than a century after the American Revolution, the most significant aspect of American life was the vast expanse of unclaimed land in the West. This land served as a safety net for Americans, ensuring that in times of crop failure, economic downturns, or when families outgrew their homes, there was always the option to move westward. The availability of seemingly endless and practically free land acted as a powerful draw for immigrants coming to America.

Initially, the public land extended from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi River, and through acquisitions like the Louisiana Purchase, Oregon, and the Mexican Cession, the United States expanded its territory to cover over 3 million square miles, with a significant portion being public domain. The Homestead Law of 1862 further encouraged westward expansion by allowing individuals to claim 160 acres of land by meeting certain residency and improvement requirements. This law led to the settlement of over a million acres by 1865, with transportation advancements making the journey to the West more accessible than in earlier times."|['1.

The movement westward by railway and steamboat was an extension of what had been happening since the Revolution. American farmers and settlers from the coast and backcountry initiated this migration. Before the 19th century, many packed their belongings into wagons and followed the sunset trail. The first wave was American, but soon foreign immigrants joined. Initially, most newcomers were from the British Isles. The exodus alarmed British journals, prompting public discussions on emigration. Despite attempts to deter migration, many from England, Scotland, and Wales continued to move to the United States. Between 1820 and 1910, significant numbers arrived from Ireland, England, Scotland, and Wales. While many English and Scottish settlers sought land, later migrants from Britain provided skilled labor to industries like mining.

In recent years, Scandinavians have answered the call of the land by moving to the American Northwest. Starting in the 1850s with only 18,000 Scandinavians in the U.S., their numbers rapidly grew. By the 1880s, over 2 million had immigrated, making a significant impact on the rural population. Norwegians, Swedes, and Danes, though distinct, share common traits. Swedes are seen as aristocratic, Norwegians as serious and democratic, and Danes as conservative. The Norwegian migration began in 1825 when a group landed in Manhattan. The Swedish migration started in 1841 with the founding of Pine Lake colony. The Danes also joined this movement, with many coming after the annexation of Schleswig-Holstein in 1866.

The census data from 1910 revealed that the majority of farms in the United States were run by native white Americans, while a small percentage was managed by foreign-born whites hailing from various countries in Europe like Germany, Ireland, Italy, and others. Concerns arose about immigration once the public land was depleted. This led to a shift where immigrants sought jobs in urban areas rather than settling in rural regions. The influx of immigrants led to the rapid growth of cities with factories, skyscrapers, and tenements packed with newcomers. The new wave of immigrants, mainly from southern and eastern Europe, brought diverse languages, customs, and political beliefs, leading to distinct ethnic neighborhoods within American cities. The influx of immigrants, particularly from Slavic nations, Italy, Greece, and the Levant, transformed the cultural landscape of the United States, especially in the northeastern cities.|['1.

Described as hardy and industrious by the Director of Emigration in St. Petersburg, these Russian Slavs have shown adaptability and intelligence despite challenges. Additionally, South Slavs like Bulgarians and Croatians have also made their mark in America, with diverse occupations ranging from mining to managing restaurants. Their willingness to embrace American ways while maintaining ties to their heritage showcases their cultural richness and potential for success."|['1. What is the main idea of the text passage?\nA.

Many Slavic and Slavic-related peoples have a shared history of resilience, tied to their cultural traditions and language. These communities, often overlooked by industrial progress and capital, have found solace in their national identity through costumes, songs, and festivals. Despite facing challenges like political intolerance and superstitions, they hold onto their heroic past. When these individuals migrate to the United States, they settle in urban slums and mining areas, maintaining their distinct culture. Lithuanians and Magyars, while distinct from Slavs, face similar struggles in preserving their heritage. The Magyars, in particular, exhibit a strong sense of community, excelling in cleanliness and sociability.

In stark contrast to strong supporters of nationalism, the Jewish people, who have no specific country but are citizens of many, are immigrants to America. Initially, they settled in cities due to circumstances, coming from European cities. Despite efforts to settle them in rural areas, these attempts failed. America has always welcomed Jews, with thousands residing in American towns during the Revolution. By 1850, their numbers grew to 50,000, reaching 150,000 by the Civil War. Persecutions in Europe led to over 400,000 Jews seeking refuge in America. The Spanish-Portuguese Jews were the first to arrive in 1655, followed by German Jews engaged in various businesses. Austrian, Hungarian, and Russian Jews also settled, with a large population in New York engaged in diverse occupations.

From Italy, over three million immigrants have arrived in America. Initially, the rate was around one thousand a year but surged to several thousand annually after 1870, becoming a flood post-1880. Most Italians settled in big cities, with a quarter in cramped New York tenements. Cities like Philadelphia, Chicago, and Boston also have Italian neighborhoods with crowded boarding houses, saloons, and Italian businesses. Many Italians worked in construction camps, replacing the Irish as laborers. The northern Italians are industrious, while the southern Italians, especially Sicilians, have a reputation for criminal activities. In contrast, about 300,000 Greeks migrated to the US between 1908 and 1917, seeking better opportunities and sending money back home. Greeks excel in businesses like ice cream shops, restaurants, and fruit markets, preferring entrepreneurship over factory work.|['1.

Years ago, Portuguese sailors from the Azores settled in New Bedford, a former whaling port. This started Portuguese immigration, with over 80,000 people arriving in the last decade. Most settled in New England factory towns, while others went to California to work in gardens and orchards. Despite challenges, New Bedford remains a hub for them. Similarly, over 100,000 ambitious tradesmen and workers from Arabia, Syria, Armenia, and Turkey have come to American cities, seeking refuge from past hardships. Armenians and Syrians, in particular, are eager to become American citizens. Additionally, Scandinavians and Finns have migrated to cities for employment as skilled craftsmen.

In the mid-19th century, the Gold Rush in California attracted adventurers from around the world, including the Chinese from rural districts near Canton. Drawn by the promise of wealth, over 300,000 Chinese immigrants arrived in America, mainly as independent young men seeking fortune. Despite their initial intention to return to China, many stayed and became essential workers in the mining camps. The Chinese immigrants maintained their traditions and cultural practices, such as wearing their traditional attire and using chopsticks. They were known for their patience, dignity, and hard work, excelling in various roles from cooking to gardening. However, as more miners arrived, racial tensions grew, leading to discrimination and violence against Chinese immigrants. Despite facing prejudice and being forced out of mining claims, the Chinese immigrants made significant contributions to the development of California during this period.|['1.

During the construction of the Pacific railways in the 1860s, Chinese laborers were brought in due to their hard work and low wages. As the transcontinental railway was completed in 1869, American laborers arrived in California, leading to competition with the Chinese workers. This sparked racial tensions, resulting in anti-Chinese sentiments. The Chinese were discriminated against for their willingness to work for less and maintain their own cultural practices. They faced violence, such as in the Los Angeles riots of 1871. Chinese communities were seen as centers of vice and crime. Organizations like the Six Companies provided support to Chinese immigrants, but were also viewed with suspicion. The Workingman's party, led by Dennis Kearney, pushed for the expulsion of Chinese laborers, leading to violent attacks and discrimination.|"['1.

During the late 1800s, anti-Chinese sentiments were rampant in the Western States of the United States. Legislatures and city councils competed to pass discriminatory laws against the Chinese population due to pressure from the labor vote. Various tactics were employed, such as incorporating intricate tax laws to drive the Chinese out of certain occupations and even denying them citizenship rights. Discriminatory ordinances were enacted to harass and humiliate the Chinese, including cutting the hair of prisoners in San Francisco. Despite these harsh measures, many of the laws were later found to be unconstitutional. In response to the anti-Chinese laws at the state level, the Federal Government stepped in with the negotiation of a new treaty in 1868. This treaty aimed to ensure reciprocal rights for Chinese citizens in the United States and American citizens in China. While initially celebrated, the treaty faced opposition from anti-Chinese groups who sought to modify or abolish it. Ultimately, diplomatic negotiations led to a new treaty in 1880 that allowed the regulation of Chinese immigration to the United States under certain conditions.|['1.

"Two years after a treaty was approved, a bill aimed to stop Chinese labor immigration for two decades. Both major political parties in 1880 supported this idea. The Democrats wanted ""No more Chinese immigration,"" while the Republicans preferred laws restricting it in a fair way. The bill passed, but President Arthur vetoed it, saying it went beyond the treaty's terms. A revised bill for a ten-year restriction got the President's approval, and on August 5, 1882, the U.S. halted Chinese labor entry. The law had flaws, leading to confusion. Chinese leaving needed a certificate, and visitors needed one from their government. Over time, identifying people became a joke, and smuggling across borders grew. In 1884, Congress tried to fix these issues. The Supreme Court supported the exclusion as part of U.S. sovereignty. Anti-Chinese sentiments persisted in the West, leading to violent acts. President Cleveland sent messages to Congress about Chinese claims. A new treaty was drafted in 1888, but Congress passed the Scott Act, worsening the situation. The Geary law in the next presidential year demanded quick registration of all Chinese residents. Despite modifications, anti-Chinese feelings remained high. A new treaty in 1894 allowed laborer exclusion for ten years. General Otis extended the exclusion to the Philippines, and Congress applied it to Hawaii.

In the early 1900s, the influx of Japanese laborers to America reignited issues of discrimination. By 1900, around 24,000 Japanese workers were in the United States, tripling over the next ten years. Most resided in California, while others settled in Western states like Washington, Colorado, and Oregon. Unlike the Chinese, the Japanese eagerly embraced American customs and language. However, cultural differences persisted due to their unique mentality and ideals. Many Japanese practiced Buddhism, while some adopted Christianity or were free-thinkers. They established trade guilds and excelled in bargaining and land ownership. The tension culminated in California's 1913 alien land bill, prompting President Wilson and Secretary of State Bryan to navigate a delicate balance between state needs and international relations, leading to protests from the Japanese government.|['1.

The immigrant influx in America is complex due to the arrival of around five thousand East Indians since 1905, mainly Hindoos with a few Afghans. The adaptation of these individuals from British-ruled regions to American life remains uncertain. The Alien Land Act of 1913 granted property rights to all eligible aliens except Asiatics. With land scarce and cities crowded, immigrants are settling in abandoned farms and underdeveloped areas. They are revitalizing neglected lands, with some creating colonies in timber regions. Immigrant families are establishing roots along railways, in market gardens, and through seasonal agricultural work. The Italian and Slav immigrants particularly excel in reclaiming and cultivating previously deemed unsuitable lands.|['1.

In the Southern United States, there was once a vast expanse of fertile land left uncultivated. The African American population, content with basic sustenance, lacked the drive and resourcefulness to work the land. Prejudice from former slave owners hindered the arrival of immigrants to develop this land. Around 1880, groups of Italians began arriving in Louisiana, attracted by the warm climate and economic opportunities. By 1900, their numbers had grown to over seventeen thousand. Direct shipping routes between the Mediterranean and the Gulf of Mexico further increased their influx, turning New Orleans into a prominent Italian hub in the country. These Italian immigrants diversified agricultural practices in the region, cultivating cotton, sugar-cane, rice, and establishing fruit orchards. They supplied cities like New Orleans, Dallas, and Houston with fresh produce from their truck farms. In places like California, Italians found success in owning farms, vineyards, and orchards due to the favorable climate. They also settled in the North and East, buying land for farming. Italian communities thrived in areas like Vineland, New Jersey, and New York, transforming rocky terrains and clay moraines into productive farmlands. The Italians' industrious spirit and strong sense of community enabled them to prosper and contribute significantly to American agriculture.|['1.

In Pennsylvania, mining towns provided recruits for a movement inland. An exchange of populations has been ongoing in some counties for a decade. Americans from rural areas are moving to cities, selling farms. Slavic real estate agents convince their countrymen to invest in land. The Slavic presence is strong in New England, notably in the Connecticut Valley. Polish settlements spread from manufacturing hubs like Chicopee and Worcester. Polish families move into colonial houses, sometimes sharing with others. This transformation is evident in towns like Old Hadley, where Poles now make up a significant portion of the population. The influx of different ethnic groups has changed the fabric of many industrial towns, with Lawrence, Massachusetts, as an example. Similar shifts have occurred in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. New manufacturing towns like Gary, Indiana, and Whiting, Indiana, have diverse populations due to industries like steel and oil refining. Granite City and Madison, Illinois, have seen rapid changes in demographics due to the influx of various European ethnicities.|['1.

The mining communities in northeastern Pennsylvania underwent significant changes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Initially, Americans and north Europeans dominated the industry, with only a small number of Slavs and Italians in the region in 1870. However, by 1910, there was a drastic shift with a large influx of immigrants from southern Europe. These newcomers replaced the earlier miners, leading to a decline in living standards and the introduction of medieval peasant-like conditions in the mining towns. This trend of displacement was not unique to Pennsylvania but also spread to other states like Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the ore regions of northern Michigan and Minnesota. The ethnic makeup of these mining communities changed rapidly, with the arrival of more foreigners seeking opportunities in mining and manufacturing. Despite past attempts to restrict immigration through laws like the Alien and Sedition Acts and the rise of anti-foreign movements like the Know-Nothing party and the American Protective Association, the influx of immigrants continued, shaping the demographic landscape of these industrial areas.|"['1.

For more than a century, many believed that a country's success relied heavily on a large number of people moving there. President Lincoln even called immigration a way to make the nation stronger and wealthier. Congress passed a law to help bring in workers from other countries, but it was later canceled. In 1819, the first Federal law about immigration aimed to improve the terrible conditions immigrants faced on ships. The law required ships to have enough food and water, limit the number of passengers, and keep lists of who was on board. Even though the law was not strictly enforced, it was a step towards better treatment. States like New York had to care for thousands of immigrants who arrived each week. To manage this, New York set up a system to help immigrants and even built hospitals and a place for them to land. The Federal Government started taking more control over immigration in 1882 by charging a tax on non-citizen passengers and excluding certain groups of people. This led to a discussion on the need for stricter immigration laws.|"[""1.

In 1892, selective immigration became a concern driven by labor unions fearing a surplus of labor and public worry about undesirable foreign entrants. Senator Lodge proposed a bill in 1896 with a literacy test to exclude those unable to read or write English. President Cleveland vetoed the bill, advocating for a more inclusive policy. The House overruled the veto, but the Senate took no action. In 1898, the Industrial Commission investigated immigration issues, leading to the 1903 immigration law. This law enhanced administrative processes, raised the head tax, and tightened controls against excluded groups like anarchists and prostitutes. Despite this, calls for stricter immigration restrictions persisted, with President Roosevelt advocating for more stringent measures. The 1907 law raised the head tax further, defined excluded immigrant groups, and expanded the Commissioner General of Immigration's authority. The Immigration Commission was established to conduct thorough inquiries into immigration matters.|"[""1.

Congress has finally acknowledged that immigration is now a matter of international importance due to modern economic conditions. Despite no treaties being finalized, the issue gained attention in 1909 when Lieutenant Joseph Petrosino was killed in Sicily while pursuing a criminal. Various measures to restrict immigration were proposed, with the literacy test being favored. Despite being passed by Congress three times, it was vetoed each time by Presidents Taft and Wilson. However, in 1917, Congress overrode President Wilson's veto, making the literacy test the standard for immigrant admission. This law excludes aliens over sixteen who can read but fail the literacy test. The debate highlighted the shift in the nation's attitude towards immigrants, emphasizing exclusion. The U.S. is seen as a nation of immigrants, with the days of unrestricted migration numbered.|"[""1.
