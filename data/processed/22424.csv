The professor nodded in agreement, explaining that the Silver Palace was just a figment of the man's imagination due to his illness. The man urgently whispered that he wasn't dying from the fever but from the poisoned water from a nearby spring. He revealed that the water drained life and strength, and a peon had warned him about its deadly effects. Frantically searching beneath the straw, the man feared losing the treasure forever. He struggled to explain how their balloon accident had led to a near-death experience, with the balloon collapsing and being consumed by mist. Despite his gasps for air, he insisted on making the listener, Jack Burk's heir, ensuring they inherit immense wealth.|"[""1.

The man on the bed spoke of their escape from the mountains and the desert's heat. They had reached Zacatecas, where Bushnell sought another balloon with the help of wealthy friends. The man mentioned the treasures hidden in the Silver Palace by the Aztecs, guarded by fierce natives. Pacheco, a dangerous figure, was hunting them for the supposed treasure. Suddenly, a horseman and a group of ruffians appeared in pursuit. Frank fired a shot, causing chaos among the pursuers. The scene shifted to a town with a church, locals in straw hats, and children on their mothers' backs. The undertaker accused the group of cheating him, leading to a commotion.

The local man continued to cry and blame them until Frank calmed him by paying him triple the amount he would have requested if the body had been found in the hut. The man saw an opportunity to blame the strangers and quickly took the money before heading back to Mendoza, fearing the body might be discovered. Frank remained vigilant for danger, almost expecting bandits. As they neared the town, they felt relief. In the town, shutters were opened, and the streets came alive. Gardens bloomed, and young ladies in pink and white dresses with Spanish veils and fans walked about.

When the letter arrived detailing the threat against his son, Asher Merriwell hurried to the dangerous land of bandits and half-breeds. Lacking the full ransom, he hoped his offering would soften Pacheco's heart and save his boy. Asher, believed to be a solitary man, had a hidden past.

As the bandits advanced, Frank displayed remarkable shooting skills that unnerved them. The bandits, expecting an easy target in a young boy, were taken aback by Frank's courage and marksmanship.

The genuine letter, though in the professor's handwriting, was clearly written under duress, urging the need for horses and a journey. Frank suspected foul play, especially with mention of the Silver Palace west of Zacatecas. Despite the dangers, the determined Americans, including Frank, were set on the perilous journey. In haste, they made a deal with Pedro, a guide familiar with the desert's perils. Resting by a spring, the heat shimmered over the sand. Approaching a fire, they found a lone figure.

While the boy shared his story, Bushnell carefully observed the guide's face illuminated by the firelight. Frank noticed a peculiar expression in the Westerner's eyes, indicating restraint. The dark-faced rascal seemed prepared for exposure, yelling defiantly before disappearing into the shadows on his horse. After the commotion settled, they gathered around the fire to discuss. Frank revealed a golden image from Burk and spoke of the Silver Palace. Bushnell questioned their plan to cross the chasm. Frank revealed a balloon loaded with sand for the journey, to return laden with gold. They anticipated bandit interference en route to Huejugilla el Alto. The town proved quaint, untouched by modernity. Bushnell communicated with the locals despite the language barrier, securing lodging at a rustic adobe hotel. Concerned about bandits, they safeguarded their balloon and gas generator. A horseman fleeing a hostile group galloped through the street, chased by a band of riders intent on capturing the horse.|['1.

In a sudden turn of events, Professor Scotch, who was actually the person involved, threw himself off the animal he was riding. He tumbled on the ground, rolled like a ball, and lay motionless just thirty feet away from Frank, moaning sadly. Meanwhile, Al Bushnell skillfully handled his Winchester rifle, firing continuously with precision. The shots rang through the streets of Huejugilla el Alto, causing chaos among the bandits. Bushnell aimed low, knowing that shooting too high would waste ammunition. The bandits, caught off guard by the unexpected resistance, swiftly retreated, dodging bullets and fleeing in fear. Professor Scotch, initially believing he was fatally wounded, miraculously realized he was unscathed and sprang back to his feet. The situation escalated when a local resident pleaded with them to leave immediately to avoid retaliation from the bandits.|"['1.

Professor Scotch, now eager, joined the group to see the palace. Bushnell's tale dispelled all doubts. After a thirty-minute trek, they found a way out of the ravine for the horses. It was tough, but Bushnell managed to guide them up. Relief washed over everyone once they were out. Bushnell explained that Pacheco's gang had tried to trap them but failed. He then muffled the horses' feet to cover their trail. Leading them through a stream, they followed in single file. The looming smoke tower cast a shadow, hinting at impending disaster. Through the smoke, the gleaming towers of the hidden palace emerged. Bushnell declared his determination to claim the treasure. Despite objections, he readied the balloon for the journey, determined to reach the palace and secure his share of the riches.|"[""1.

"Bushnell exclaimed, ""It's Pacheco's gang!"" and quickly readied his rifle. ""The bandits arrived too early! The balloon can only carry two now. We must fend them off until it's ready.""

Frank found himself ensnared by a deadly vine, unable to break free as it coiled around him like serpents. Helpless, he felt the vines tightening around his neck, suffocating him. In a panic, Gage fled through the swamp, haunted by the fear of the pursuing vines. As he imagined his impending doom, he felt a chilling sensation on his wrist, fearing the vampire-like plant. Lost in a daze, the world around him twisted into a nightmarish dance of demons. Eventually, saved by Socato, Frank recounted his harrowing ordeal to his companions. Left alone with Elsie, they shared a heartfelt moment, their hands intertwining as they expressed their unspoken feelings.

Two days later, a group of eight people emerged from the wilds of the great Dismal Swamp and arrived at a small settlement. Among them were Frank Merriwell, Barney Mulloy, Professor Scotch, Leslie Gage, Captain Bellwood, William Bellwood, Socato the Seminole, and Elsie Bellwood. Frank took care of Gage, ensuring he received the best medical aid, saving him from a dire fate. Professor Scotch decided to halt his journey in Knoxville, planning to reunite with the boys in a few weeks. Frank and Barney were trekking from Gibson's Gap to Cranston's Cove, a journey they found to be quite arduous. As they rested, they marveled at the breathtaking view of valleys and mountains.

"""I approached you in the fall today,"" she continued, speaking softly. ""Now, don't be afraid, for I won't act foolishly. I know I lack formal education and refinement, unlike city girls. Can't we be friends?"" Suddenly, a blow rang out, causing the attacker to stagger. Frank swiftly followed, striking him with force. It was jealousy that fueled the man's aggression, stirred by his admiration for Kate Kenyon. As Miller and Barney Mulloy joined the scene, Frank realized he had to find a way to subdue the man. Despite Miller's determination, Frank managed to throw him down. Later, inside the house, Mrs. Kenyon retired to bed, apologizing for the boys' sleeping arrangements.

"""Stop!"" Frank ordered. ""If you harm us, you will soon realize we are not alone. We have influential allies who will pursue this. You will face consequences for your actions. You cannot escape!"" The man sneered, ""Do you think you are mightier than the United States Government? We are not afraid of your friends."" Hope faded for Frank.

City dwellers often underestimate the intelligence of mountain girls who lack formal education. They may boast about easily charming these girls, which can backfire.

Two men held a rope, binding the boys' hands behind them. As they entered a room lit by oil lamps, they faced a circle of moonshiners. The captives were given a choice between cards or a vote.

The boys quickly followed the confident girl, Barney leading the way down some rough stone steps. Frank followed suit without hesitation. The girl moved swiftly, her hand brushing past Frank, leaving a scent of wildflowers lingering in the air. To Frank, she was like a beautiful flower among weeds. The touch of their hands felt electric. As they made their way through the morning air scented with flowers, a distant dog's bark echoed off the mountains. Kate Kenyon remarked on the noise, hinting at trouble at Bize Wiley's cabin near Bildow's Crossroads. The girl urged them to the old mill for safety, moving with surprising speed and agility. Inside the abandoned mill, she warned them to stay hidden, promising to return later. Frank, intrigued by the girl, began to suspect something more beneath her mountain exterior.|"['1.
