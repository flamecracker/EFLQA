At the end of the lane, there was an orchard where a cow was peacefully grazing on fresh grass. The boy, Nat, quickly managed to turn her around and lead her back up the lane after a fishing trip had left him hungry. As he stopped to grab an apple, chaos ensued. The new cow accidentally spilled a pail of milk and caused a commotion with another cow being milked.

Later, as the cows were led to the pasture for the night, Nat decided to leave the farm due to feeling mistreated.

Nat had been searching for an address for over a year, crucial for a real estate deal. Finally obtaining it, he could proceed without hindrance. Although aware that Shanley or Cameron had the address, they refused to share it. With nothing else to do that day, Nat returned home and later attended night school to study shorthand and typewriting. Making rapid progress, he diligently applied himself. John Garwell, discussing Shanley's attempts to sabotage him, leaned back in his office chair. Several days passed, during which Nat received a letter from his uncle, confirming all was well on the farm. Witnessing a drunken man in danger at the train station, Nat swiftly saved him, despite the man's resistance. Mr. Garwell took action by having a stenographer record the man's confession, which was signed and witnessed. Nat wrote to his uncle about the incident, enclosing the confession, which led to his uncle's remorse for doubting him.|"['1.
