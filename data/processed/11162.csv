Little Black Mingo, an orphan, lived with the mean Black Noggy who scolded and sometimes beat her. One day, Mingo's chatty broke while fetching water from the river, and a Mugger threatened to eat her. Frightened, she ran back to Black Noggy, who scolded her for breaking the chatty. Black Noggy then gave her a big chatty to fetch water. Mingo, fearing the Mugger, cautiously checked for him but didn't see him. As she filled the chatty, the Mugger caught her tail and took her to an island with eggs. A Mongoose, floating downstream, asked for help. Mingo rescued it, and the Mongoose ate the eggs, saving her from the Mugger.|"['1.
