One summer night, out in the fields, we stood together, half afraid of the rustling corn-leaves and the shadows of the high hills. We lingered till the candle's light shone through the open door, and the great yellow star trembled atop the hay-stack. It was held by a tall red mulberry-tree, dead at the top, with one branch full of leaves that shook the dew over our heads. We were scared to go home, one of us carrying speckled eggs, the other holding a small bird. Our mother's eyes pierced through us, seeing the truth. In the end, it was little Belgium, Italia, England, France, and America who won the war. Bob, a simple man, went looking for a job, not seeking grandeur but a chance to work.|['1.

Bob got a job without asking about pay, work conditions, or benefits. He just filed his application, hung his coat, and started working.

They lead the cows back home from the fields, Along the shady path, Where the quail sings loudly in the wheat-fields, Yellow with ripe grain.

She rode a mouse-gray mustang, near me, donning a blue serape and jingling spurs; her ignorance of books or beliefs, content with a simple prayer; her sole wish, to ride by my side, from San Saba to Lavaca. She was as fierce as the waves, as wild as the winds; swaying in her passion like a sapling pine in Kansas. She would sacrifice for me, endure the bitter to leave me the sweet. Once, in San Antonio, jealousy sparked a swift stab with a dagger, a near miss that made me forgive her. In Texas, beside the Rio Grande, her brown eyes, dark hair, and Spanish vigor defined her.

It's interesting how much we cherish our children, willing to sacrifice everything for them. But as we age, the love we expect in return sometimes falters. When our children grew up and left, except for Charley, who became dearer to me, God took him away. I struggled on, working for Charley, who was now my everything. However, when he got married, things changed. His wife was proud and hard to please. Despite my efforts to befriend her, it never worked out. Eventually, Charley turned against me, telling me to leave. I moved from one child's house to another, but there was never enough room for me. Feeling rejected and worn out, I ended up in the poorhouse. This poem reflects on the sacrifices parents make for their children and the challenges of aging and being alone.|"['1.

The sexton, alarmed by the commotion, opened the church doors to find King Robert demanding entry. Mistaken for a drunk, Robert stormed into the night.

During the holy week, Easter Sunday arrived with the presence of an angel illuminating the city. The jester, humbled by the light, felt a newfound power and knelt in prayer. The angel departed, leaving a radiant trail across Italy to Salerno and beyond. Back in Palermo, the angel conversed with King Robert, who sought penitence for his sins. The angel's departure left the king in silent prayer, bathed in a holy light, as the monks chanted nearby. As autumn arrived, the sun painted the landscape with golden hues, casting a serene glow over the fields. The day ended with a harvest celebration, where villagers gathered to husk corn by lantern light, while children played and elders reminisced. Young D. Green, an inventive lad, dreamt of flying and tinkered with contraptions, inspired by the tales of Daedalus and Icarus.

The stars in the midnight sky witness a magnificent sight, as the earth glows with joy on this Christmas night. Showers quench the thirst of flowers, casting light shade on leaves as they dream. The dew from wings awakens buds, cradled by their mother under the sun. Hail lashes the plains, then dissolves into rain, thunder laughing as it passes by. Snow sifts down on mountains, pines groaning, while I rest on my airy nest under the calm moon. I bind the sun's throne and the moon's with a girdle of pearl, creating a whirlwind banner unfurled.

Build more grand homes, my inner self, as time passes swiftly! Leave behind your old ways! Let each new sanctuary, grander than the last, shield you with a larger dome, until you are truly free, shedding your old shell by life's ever-moving sea! True value lies in actions, not appearances, in doing good each passing day, not just dreaming of great deeds in the future.

We can't bargain for happiness, nor trap it like fish in nets; sometimes what we miss in life helps more than what we gain.
