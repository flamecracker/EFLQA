The doctor, hungry, sat silently at the supper-table until his appetite was satisfied. He expressed doubts about Nora's health, stating her lack of vitality.

"Once upon a time, Mr. Bickel, a great man, built a splendid new house and had a son. He wanted a name for the child that couldn't be changed like his own had been. After hearing the name Fortunatus at a school examination, he decided it was perfect for his son, as he believed the boy was destined for fortune. However, the boy's schoolmates found the name too long and dubbed him ""Feklitus."" Despite the father's hopes, the name stuck. In the village school, Oscar and Feklitus were both at the top of their class due to a seating dispute. Oscar preferred having Fani, a lively and brave friend, next to him.

Despite some minor jealousies, Oscar and Feklitus usually cooperated well. Oscar's idea of a Musical Festival brought them closer. Everyone could participate, and Feklitus was involved too.

On the fourth day, Mrs. Stanhope joined us for meals and spoke kindly to Fani and me. She mentioned it was time to start working. To our surprise, the work was not hard at all. We spent the mornings in the schoolroom studying. Our teacher arrived at nine and stayed till one, with just Fani and me as students. Fani excelled, but the teacher encouraged me, saying I would improve. After school, we enjoyed the garden. Fani discussed his lessons and ideas with Mrs. Stanhope, who favored him. I struggled to express my gratitude like Fani. Aunt Clarissa taught me to sew and embroider. Fani had a drawing lesson while I worked on a banner for Oscar. We played in the beautiful garden until supper, where we sang songs. Time passed quickly, and we were always sad to end the day. We are grateful to be here with Fani.|['1.

When the letter was done, there was a burst of joy. The news of a visit to a villa on the Rhine thrilled the children. Oscar dreamed of uniting Swiss armies under a motto for a banner. Emma was ecstatic that Fani was on the path to becoming a painter. Fred busily prepared to expand his collections. Little Rikli looked forward to a carefree summer with Aunt Clarissa. Fani and Elsli grew happier each day, eager to welcome old friends to their new home. Aunt Clarissa reminded them of God's provision and led them to Philo and Nora's resting place. Winter gave way to summer, roses bloomed, and Fani and Elsli played in the fragrant garden. Fani, admiring butterflies, asked Elsli why she seemed sad. He urged her to be grateful for their current happiness despite past sorrows.|"[""1.

Elsli and Fani were having a conversation in the garden. Elsli expressed her desire to help the less fortunate, inspired by her Aunt Clarissa's words about giving back. Fani, however, pointed out that everyone around them seemed well-off. Elsli felt that despite their comfort, she wanted to do something meaningful, like knitting stockings for less fortunate children. Fani reminded her of the doctor's advice to take it easy and enjoy the outdoors. He encouraged Elsli to appreciate the garden's beauty and the river's fragrance. Elsli, though appreciative, couldn't shake thoughts of her departed friend, Nora, and the beautiful sunset views that reminded her of her.

Elsli, however, expressed her concerns about not meeting Mrs. Stanhope's expectations. She felt troubled by the sad thoughts that came to her mind, especially when she saw people in trouble. Fani, in an attempt to reassure Elsli, shared an encounter with a man who seemed worried. Elsli felt compelled to help him, but Fani warned her against approaching strangers.

Oscar, with Elsli's guidance, explored the garden meticulously. They strolled down to the Rhine, across the meadow, and back to the walled courtyard shaded by two large oak trees.

Oscar pointed out a windmill on a distant hill, envisioning it as a festive spot for gatherings. Elsli revealed a Swiss flag she embroidered with Alpine roses, but Oscar desired his verses on the banner. Elsli suggested placing the motto on the other side, lifting Oscar's spirits.

Fani was disheartened, convinced he could never pursue his passion for art due to Mrs. Stanhope's disapproval.

They decided to return to a safer spot to admire the castle ruins covered in ivy. Fani shared his dream of being a painter and how he could win a prize by drawing the castle. Later, they rushed to the dinner bell, where they joined other guests at a lavish meal. Mrs. Stanhope announced a trip to a zoo in Cologne, sparking excitement among the children.

The following day, the kids sat down to write about their adventures as promised. Their letters varied in style but shared their joy at the beauty of the villa, the fun they had, and the kindness they experienced. They wished their stay could extend to twelve weeks instead of six.

Oscar, eager to meet more Swiss people, persuaded the baker's boy to help gather them for a festival. The boy, once standoffish, agreed and mentioned Swiss acquaintances nearby. Oscar then planned to visit a nearby factory to meet two Swiss boys. Fani declined due to Mrs. Stanhope's rules, but Elsli suggested Oscar visit the factory and write a report for Mr. Bickel.

Oscar was thrilled to join the game with the boys in the yard. They played until the factory bell signaled the end of the day.

Excited about their future plans, they arranged to meet again. Elsli, feeling lonely at Rosemount, wandered along a quiet path to the riverbank. There, she heard cries for help. Two children were stuck in the bog. Elsli rescued them, and they shared that they lived nearby. Eager to help, Elsli guided them home, feeling a sense of purpose and connection.|['1.

"""Come join us and explain to mother,"" the boy urged, eyeing their muddy attire. The little girl, no more than four, softly added, ""Please come."" Sensing their need for help, Elsli, holding their hands, followed. The boy, Lucas, shared their family's struggles: his ill mother, a sun-sensitive grandfather, Lenchen, and siblings Tolf and Heini.

The day arrived for the Cologne expedition, and it was a beautiful day with a blue sky and bright sun. The children had a delightful trip to the zoo.

When it was time for Feklitus to arrive, they headed to the station together. Despite the warm welcome from the Fink boys, Feklitus wasn't used to making friends with strangers. His luggage was given to the bus driver, and the four boys walked to the hotel. Feklitus was led to a large room with bright red satin furnishings and tall windows. Oscar immediately began explaining the preparations for the upcoming festival. As the discussion grew heated, Oscar passionately talked about Swiss history and their plans to celebrate the Feast of the Foundation.

In the adjacent room, Lina, cheeks flushed with excitement, expressed to Mrs. Clarissa her decision to leave the house immediately. She described a shocking discovery of live creatures in the young gentleman's washstand drawer - frogs, spiders, snails, caterpillars, and beetles. Lina felt disgusted and believed it was a deliberate prank by the young man to scare anyone finding them. Mrs. Clarissa, calming Lina, inspected the room and found it in a dreadful state. She concluded that the boy likely hid the creatures to avoid detection. Mrs. Clarissa instructed Lina to clean up discreetly without informing Mrs. Stanhope.

Feklitus observed the men engaged in a serious discussion with the miller. Suddenly, he leaped up, fueled by fear, and dashed down the hill with his hair standing on end. The Uri boy chased after him. Without glancing back, they sprinted ahead, eventually parting ways and vanishing without being followed. Oscar, panting, arrived at Rosemount. Frantically, he rushed inside, retrieved his portfolio, and tearfully penned a letter to his aunt seeking help. He described a troubling incident at a gathering and feared potential repercussions. Anxious, he implored his aunt to intercept any correspondence that might reach his father, hoping to avoid a scandal. Racing to the post office before supper, Oscar mailed the letter, feeling apprehensive. Upon his return, he encountered a uniformed man holding a deserted banner, waiting to be admitted.

Clarissa exclaimed in alarm, fearing for the missing children. Elsli, feeling guilty for her unapproved visits to the fisherman's house, followed Clarissa anxiously.

The captain listened to their story with amusement and assured them they would be taken back to Cologne by train.
