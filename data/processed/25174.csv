Rollo, a twelve-year-old boy, was traveling in Europe with his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Holiday, along with his younger brother, Thanny, and cousin Jane. On their journey from Liverpool to Glasgow, Rollo met Waldron Kennedy, a boy around his age but a bit taller. Waldron was accompanied by his father, mother, and two sisters.

By now, the two boys had arrived where Mr. George sat on a camp stool, absorbed in his guidebook and map, planning their Scotland tour. Mr. George engaged the boys in conversation to get to know Waldron better. Waldron expressed his desire to stay to see the steamers and dockyards, mentioning a massive iron ship under construction. While chatting, Waldron observed the ships closely, proposing they move to the bridge for a better view. Rollo, following Mr. George's rule to obey ship regulations, declined, stating he could only go where other passengers went. The boys then decided to seek Mr. George's opinion on a debate regarding odd and even numbers.

Mr. George explained to Rollo and Waldron the importance of sailors staying in their designated areas on a ship, comparing it to guests at a hotel not going into the kitchen. As they observed a large steamer, Waldron went to see it, prompting Mr. George's explanation to be delayed. Later, while Rollo and Mr. George searched for Waldron, they found him shoveling coal into a furnace in the ship's hold, much to Mr. Kennedy's dismay. Mr. George likened Waldron's actions to a steam engine needing a load to prevent it from causing trouble, emphasizing the need for boys like Waldron to have constructive activities to keep them engaged and out of mischief.|"['1.

Mr. George believed that active boys, like Waldron, needed proper employment for their growing physical and mental abilities. He compared it to hunger and thirst, stating that if these energies were not channeled positively, they might lead to mischief. Mr. Kennedy, feeling helpless, suggested that Mr. George take Waldron on his upcoming tour to Scotland. Waldron, excited about the idea, was freed from his confinement and put under Mr. George's care. Mr. George then asked Waldron to assist with tasks upon arrival, showing that giving responsibilities could be a remedy for restlessness and mischief in energetic children. Parents often underestimate how rapidly their children are growing physically and mentally.

Scotland is a country with distinct geographical features. It is separated from England by two rivers, the Tweed in the east and the Solway Frith in the west. In the past, these rivers marked the boundary between the two countries, and many battles were fought in this region. Scotland is also divided by the Forth and Clyde rivers, which flow east and west into the seas. The estuaries of these rivers, known as friths, allow ships and steamers to access the heart of Scotland. Understanding these geographical features is essential for comprehending the narrative of Rollo's travels through the country. Mr. George, a character in the story, believed in providing active and enterprising minds like Waldron with constructive outlets for their energies to prevent them from engaging in mischievous behavior.

Scotland's two largest cities, Edinburgh and Glasgow, are located in the valleys of the Forth and Clyde rivers. Edinburgh, known for its focus on science, literature, and the arts, is situated near the Forth, surrounded by picturesque hills and ravines. The city boasts numerous learned institutions and publishing houses that produce a wide range of books. In contrast, Glasgow, positioned on the Clyde, is a hub of mechanical and manufacturing industries. The region is filled with mines, mills, forges, and shipyards, powered by abundant coal and iron ore deposits underground. The Clyde River, once a small stream, was widened and deepened over time to accommodate large ships, becoming a center for steamboat and shipbuilding, with iron replacing timber as the primary material for ship construction.|['1.

Our group of travelers was entering a bustling area of factories and skilled workers. Before continuing their journey, let's talk about the different parts of Scotland. The southern region, between the Forth and Clyde valleys and the English border, is known for fertile lands mainly used for farming. It's not a popular spot for tourists. On the other hand, the northern part is mountainous and wild, offering grand and breathtaking views. The east has flat areas with bustling towns like Inverness and Aberdeen, while the west is famous for its lakes and mountains, known as the Scottish Highlands. The travelers planned to visit the Clyde Valley's mines and factories before exploring the Highlands. Scotland is known for its rainy weather, especially in the mountainous regions. The sudden rain showers can disrupt travel plans, making it challenging to explore the beautiful landscapes.|"['1.

"""I will think about it,"" he said. ""I'll consider if there are any conditions under which I can permit you to go. I'll inform you at the hotel. Now, regarding the trip to Glasgow, I leave the decision to you and Waldron. You both need to gather all the necessary information, like the train schedule after we arrive, and the time it takes to reach there. Also, handle the luggage transfer from the steamer to the station. Can we manage without a cab?"" Mr. George inquired. ""I'm willing to assist with carrying the items, but I prefer not to be responsible for them. Just ensure everything is accounted for before and after boarding the train,"" he added. Shortly after, the steamer docked at Greenock, and the trio disembarked. The rain had stopped, making the walk to the station more pleasant despite the wet streets.

Rollo and Waldron made their way to the station, guided by Mr. George. As they entered the station, they climbed a wide staircase to the second floor where they found a glass-covered area surrounded by various station offices. In the center, a train with a locomotive awaited passengers. People were bustling about, boarding the carriages. Nearby, a boy sold books at a stand filled with guidebooks and tales. Mr. George reminded Waldron to stay close and be cautious. At the booking office, they learned they needed tickets for the journey. While waiting for the next train, they explored the station, unable to venture out due to the rain. They decided to postpone eating at the station's refreshment room and opted for a proper meal at a hotel. After an hour, they boarded the train to Glasgow, enjoying the scenic ride despite the rain. Upon reaching Glasgow, they took a cab to their inn, following Mr. George's advice to travel by carriage for safety and convenience.|"['1.

In England and Scotland, when walking into towns, people might think we are poor and unimportant, giving us less attention and worse rooms. Upon arrival at a hotel, porters and waiters welcomed the travelers. The porters handled the baggage, while the head waiter guided them inside. Waldron paid the cab fare promptly. Requesting two bedrooms, one with twin beds, Mr. George was graciously assisted by the waiter. A chambermaid then led them to the lovely rooms overlooking a square with statues and lush greenery. Mr. George advised the boys to freshen up and choose a table in the coffee room for dinner. They selected a cozy spot by the fireplace, enjoying the warm ambiance. Waldron suggested a boat trip down the river from the Broomielaw harbor, followed by a return journey on the railway for an affordable and scenic adventure.|"[""1.

Mr. George set two tough conditions for Waldron and Rollo before allowing them to embark on an excursion. Despite Waldron's hesitation due to his limited writing skills, he agreed to describe what he saw. The boys also accepted the condition to report each other's careless actions during the trip. They boarded a steamer at nine in the morning after breakfast. Mr. George accompanied them to the Broomielaw to see them off. The boys returned safely by three in the afternoon and promptly wrote about their adventure. Waldron focused on the beginning of the journey, describing purchasing tickets and the unique Scottish kilt. Meanwhile, Rollo detailed the later part of the trip, noting the ships and steamers along the riverbank and the captain's insights about the river's depth.|[]|[]
As we approached the shipyards, we saw many iron ships being built. The workers were busy hammering rivets, creating a loud noise. The ships were all slanted towards the water, ready to be launched down the stream. This was to ensure they sailed smoothly without hitting the opposite bank. We passed by many steamers, one of which seemed freshly launched with workers aboard. Women on the green bank tried to keep up with the ship, likely having watched its launch. In the engine room, I saw three cylinders, two working alternately and one at half-stroke, preventing imbalance. The inclined cylinders and perpendicular boiler were new to me. We continued our journey, passing green fields, mountains, and a castle on a rock before landing at Greenock and returning home by train. The trip ended with musicians playing on board, reminiscent of our travels on the Rhine.|['1.

We stopped at a pier halfway down the river where a train of cars awaited to take people to Loch Lomond on the way to the Highlands. Waldron suggested we visit when we venture to the Highlands. After passing through a wide river stretch, we landed at Greenock, expecting the boat to halt, but it continued. Many passengers stayed aboard, while others embarked to go further down the river. We found a street near the depot with a steep hill behind it, adorned with walls, terraces, and trees. Upon reaching the top, we discovered a broad terrace offering a view of the river and town below. Behind us were green fields, gravel walks, flowers, and trees with children playing. Later, we explored the riverside, considering boarding an omnibus to an unknown place but decided against it, returning home after a pleasant day.|['1.

The Green was situated at the eastern edge of the city, while towards the west lay a higher area where affluent residents lived. The streets in this region were designed in elegant crescents and terraces, lined with grand stone houses. Closer to the city's heart stood the ancient cathedral, a solemn structure surrounded by a quiet green yard. Behind the cathedral, separated by a narrow valley, loomed a steep hill covered with tombs and monuments. Accessible by a bridge, this cemetery enticed the boys with its winding pathways leading to a tall monument at its peak. Though tempted to explore the cemetery immediately, the boys first visited the cathedral, passing through a gate where they encountered a friendly porter curious about America. After a brief stop, they proceeded towards the cemetery, crossing a bridge and entering through an open gate.|"['1. What is the location of The Green in the city described in the passage?\nA.

The boys explored the cemetery, climbing higher and higher until they reached the hill's summit with a column honoring John Knox, the Scottish reformer. The inscription praised Knox's unwavering dedication to his duty despite threats and dangers he faced in life. Mr. George admired Knox's courage and character, urging the boys to defend what is right and oppose what is wrong, just like Knox did. In Glasgow, they marveled at the towering chimneys of manufacturing plants, like the one at St. Rollox Chemical Works, over 430 feet high. The group then ventured into the Scottish Highlands, a region of mountains, glens, and lakes, with endless excursion possibilities. They learned that Loch Lomond's valley is a popular gateway to the Highlands, with steamboats ferrying travelers between inns at the lake's ends. Despite the region's frequent rain, the stunning landscapes make Highland tours a memorable experience.|"[""1.

In Europe, when leaving a hotel, we don't visit the office or bar room like in America. Instead, we ring a bell in our room and ask the waiter to bring the bill. Waldron omitted a crucial detail when telling Mr. George - there was no boat from Balloch to connect with the train that night. They could only go as far as the foot of the lake. Despite this, Mr. George preferred spending the night in Balloch to enjoy the countryside. They embarked on a steamer, then took a train, enjoying scenic views of mountains and villages. Arriving at Balloch, they found a pretty inn by the lake. The boys were excited to fish, and Mr. George joined them, making it a pleasant excursion with beautiful views.|['1.

"The boat trip in Scotland was a unique experience for Waldron and his friends. The boatman's Scottish dialect, with phrases like ""dinna ken"" for ""I don't know"" and ""fash"" for ""trouble,"" reminded them of their location. Despite the language differences, Waldron enjoyed the fishing trip and expressed interest in exploring more of Scotland by boat. The picturesque islands with dark mountains rising from the sea captivated their imagination. As they returned from fishing, they decided to visit a castle. The porter allowed them access to the grounds but not inside the castle, as the owner's family lived there. Walking along the smooth avenue towards the castle, they admired the beautiful park and spotted hares leaping about. Finally, they reached the castle, a majestic structure with ivy-covered walls and turrets."|"[""1.

After exploring the magnificent building to their heart's content, Mr. George and the boys strolled along the winding paths that crisscrossed the grounds. Despite the impeccable beauty of the surroundings, an air of solemnity lingered over the entire scene. Reflecting on the grandeur, Mr. George speculated about the owner's lifestyle, suggesting that he likely resided in Edinburgh or London during the winter and hosted guests at this estate in the summer. The group spent about half an hour wandering the grounds before heading back to the hotel. As they hurried back, ominous storm clouds gathered overhead, and a light drizzle began to fall. Ben Lomond, a prominent peak in Scotland, stood majestically on the east side of Loch Lomond, a popular destination for tourists due to its breathtaking views and serene ambiance.|"['1.

Mr. George began the day by reading from the Bible and saying a prayer with the boys, asking for God's protection and guidance. This routine helped the boys be kinder and more obedient throughout the day. After breakfast, they went to the railway station to catch a train to the boat. It started raining, so they decided to take the train instead of walking. The tickets were threepence each. When the train arrived, they boarded a small boat to cross the lake. Everyone rushed to find shelter from the rain. Mr. George made a cushion with his shawl on a wet bench for the boys to sit on. As they sailed, the rain obscured the view of the mountains and islands. The wind and rain increased, making them quite wet under the umbrella.|['1.

The group descended below deck one by one using a small spiral staircase near the back of the boat. Inside the cabin, they found a fascinating sight. The room was cozy and small, with seats made of carved oak and plush cushions along the sides. Above, a row of small windows offered views of the outside scenery. A fireplace with a warm coal fire crackling inside attracted some passengers seeking warmth. Despite disappointment from the rain and cold, some travelers remained cheerful, enjoying breakfast together. Rollo and Waldron observed the passengers' reactions while the steamer sailed on, revealing new lands and islands. As they approached Rowerdennan, the rain stopped, and a glimpse of a stone house near the shore signaled their arrival. The pier was small, requiring a small fee to disembark. The porter directed them towards the inn along a narrow road by the lake.|"['1.

There were boards and timbers on the vessel's deck to be unloaded. The porter stayed to receive them while Mr. George and the boys proceeded to the inn. They entered through a pleasant yard surrounded by trees and gardens. Mr. George and the boys were led to the coffee room with a view of the lake through the windows. Waldron suggested fishing on the lake instead of going up the mountain. The boys should have considered the purpose of their tour with Mr. George and not deviated from the plans. When joining an adult on an excursion, children should share their pleasures, not substitute their own. Mr. George resolved the situation by proposing a fishing trip on the lake if the boys wrote a chapter for his journal. They embarked on the lake, encountering rain and wind on their journey.|"[""1.

Upon reaching land, they sought refuge from a passing shower. After exploring the village, they resumed their journey. Fishing near the shore, they caught trout for breakfast. Mr. George read about Rob Roy while the boys fished. The next day, they rode horses to ascend a mountain, taking turns to avoid fatigue. The path was open, with hills covered in moss and heather. The summit offered a vast view, though the cold wind urged them back down. Resting at a spring, Mr. George emphasized the importance of following plans while traveling for learning. The boys were to document the day's adventures for Mr. George's journal upon reaching Stirling. This plan was executed, with each boy writing half the account.|"['1.

The Trossachs is a narrow gorge nestled among mountains, starting at a lake's end, stretching two to three miles with forested sides and sharp rocks peeking through trees. The pass isn't in Loch Lomond's valley but in a parallel valley about five miles away, requiring a trek across high land by foot or carriage. The plan was to advance up the lake to Inversnaid, disembark, and journey over the mountains. As the boat's arrival neared, we gathered our belongings and strolled along the shore to the pier, meeting fellow passengers, including a soldier from Ben Lomond's sappers and miners. The weather was delightful, prompting everyone to stay on deck, admiring the mountains. Upon reaching Inversnaid, we found it wasn't a town but an inn by a waterfall on the mountain's slope. After debating walking or riding across the high land to the next valley, we opted to ride in a carriage called a machine, as Uncle George preferred.|"['1.

As the hostler readied the horse, we ventured to admire the nearby waterfall. A path meandered through the bushes leading to it, and a quaint footbridge spanned the stream below the cascading water. Just as we marveled at the sight, a call beckoned us back to the inn where our machines awaited. Two carriages stood ready, one for another group with a lady already aboard. Our driver cautioned us of an initial steep hill where gentlemen customarily walked. The landscape appeared desolate, with only hills and mountains adorned in greenery. Passing by stone hovels, we peered into one, revealing sparse furnishings on a stone floor. Our driver shared that the land belonged to a duke who frequented the area for grouse hunting. The well-kept road, crafted by the duke, stretched far ahead, offering a glimpse of distant travelers making their way with umbrellas and knapsacks, prompting us to ponder their choice to trek rather than ride.|"['1.

We approached two gentlemen and two ladies, one looking tired. They explained that they had to walk as the first group had taken the available machines. Nearby, an old steamboat named the Rob Roy floated, showing signs of neglect. We all boarded a boat, including other passengers. Despite some fearing the rough waters, we assured them of safety. The boatman said we'd reach calm waters on the eastern shore. I offered to row, calming fears after reassurances from the boatman. As we crossed Loch Katrine, the scenery grew more picturesque, with Ben Venue and Benan mountains flanking the narrow pass where Ellen's Isle sat, famed from Walter Scott's poem. Ellen's Isle, rocky and wooded, added to the wild beauty of the area.|"['1.

The small, rocky island we sailed by was hidden by lush trees and bushes, with only a few rocks peeking through. The steep banks led to deep waters near the shore. As we approached the landing, we saw only a hut and a narrow road winding down a valley flanked by steep rocks and mountains. A mile and a quarter walk from the landing led us to an extraordinary inn that resembled an ancient castle with spires and battlements. Inside, the Gothic-style hall bustled with tourists having meals. We decided to continue to Stirling, leaving the inn behind, and as we journeyed, the landscape transformed into a picturesque scene with sunlit parks, gardens, villages, and castle ruins, painting a beautiful picture of the countryside.|['1.

Upon reaching Stirling Castle, perched atop a rocky hill, we marveled at its grandeur. The hill, steep on three sides and gently sloping towards the town on the fourth, offered a commanding view of the level, cultivated lands surrounding it. Stirling Castle, situated by the Forth River, is a prominent landmark visible from miles around. The hill itself is elongated, stretching from north to south, with the high end in the north. Walls of the castle cling to the steep cliffs, creating a formidable sight. In front of the castle lies the esplanade, a gravelled area used for military drills and parades. On a Sunday, the boys and Mr. George ventured towards a nearby church, drawn by the sound of bells. Inside, they found a unique interior with galleries supported by massive pillars and quaint pulpits. The congregation joined in hymns led by the precentor, creating a harmonious atmosphere within the ancient walls.|['1.

All the individuals in the church held Bibles on an inclined board in front of them while seated in their pews. When the minister announced the text or read a chapter, they all flipped to the designated page. Waldron found this to be a brilliant arrangement. During their outing, they noticed numerous paths at varying heights on the west side of the hill, with seats strategically placed for resting. These spots, along with the paths themselves, offered stunning views of the surrounding landscape. The boys were eager to explore these paths and the hill's sides, but Mr. George advised them to wait until the next day. The following morning, accompanied by Mr. George, the boys embarked on a journey to visit the castle. Upon arriving at the esplanade, they encountered groups of soldiers in red coats undergoing training exercises under the supervision of officers. After observing the soldiers for a brief period, they proceeded to the castle entrance where they were welcomed by a Highlander sentinel. Upon entering the castle, they explored the inner court surrounded by stone buildings used as soldiers' barracks. The palace, adorned with intricate sculptures and images, was a significant attraction. A young soldier offered to guide them around, providing historical insights and leading them to a garden and the rampart wall, offering a breathtaking view of the picturesque countryside.|"['1.

On one side of the mountain, the boys gazed at the River Forth, meandering through lush meadows and green fields with remarkable twists and turns. They had seen winding rivers before, but nothing quite like this. The entire plain was a tapestry of the river's curves, resembling a silver chain nestled in a carpet of vibrant green. These bends of the river, along with the expansive circular fields they encircled, were known as the Links of Forth. The scenery was dotted with villages, bridges, and other structures, occasionally hiding the river from sight, adding to the mystery of its path. The contrast between this fertile landscape and the desolate moors of the Highlands amazed the boys. A soldier mentioned a stone step where Queen Victoria once stood to admire the view on her way to Balmoral, her Highland retreat. The boys explored the castle grounds, including the ancient tilting ground and the Lady's Rock, where tournaments were once held. They decided to have a picnic there instead of dining at the hotel.|"['1.

Mr. George had a plan for the boys. He suggested they go to town to buy food for a picnic while he stayed behind to write in his journal. He informed them that dining at the hotel would cost seven shillings, but they could spend less for the picnic. The boys agreed and set off to shop. They bought bread, pie, oranges, milk, and a dessert of raisins and almonds for only two shillings and fourpence. On their way back, they took a scenic walk outside the town wall to the hill where Mr. George was waiting. Pleased with their purchases, they all enjoyed a satisfying picnic together. Mr. George also shared stories about historical events and a lady named Mary, making the outing both educational and enjoyable.|['1.

Waldron mentioned his plan to obtain the book once they reach Edinburgh, but he realized he could ask the guide at the castle about the escape. The following morning, Mr. George and the boys bid farewell to Stirling and journeyed towards Loch Leven. They explored the ruins of an abbey and an ancient royal palace at Dunfermline. Afterward, they continued their trip, stopping at Cowdenbeath to catch a coach to Loch Leven. Enjoying the serene countryside with stone cottages and coal pits, they found the Loch Leven coach at the station. They took a pleasant walk and observed the working coal pits before boarding the coach. They had a delightful ride, passing through picturesque rural scenes until they reached Kinross village, near Loch Leven.

"""Yes,"" the driver explained, ""the castle was much smaller when people lived there. The island has grown larger over time. The owner dug the loch deeper, draining water and revealing more land. Trees were planted, creating a grove around the ruins. Later, the coach arrived at a tidy inn where they stayed for the night. The village, with gray stone houses close together, lacked the greenery of American towns. The next morning, they set out to visit the castle. A local boy led them to a man who managed fishing in the loch. They reached the shore, boarded a boat, and glided smoothly towards the castle island.

After passing the house, they soon reached the end of the grounds that extended into the lake, where a very old burial ground was situated. Following a short boat ride, they neared the shores of a small island. The prominent square tower and the connected rampart wall came into view. The island was mostly covered by young trees, with a few large ancient ones near the ruins. Upon landing, Mr. George and the boys disembarked onto a stone jetty and followed a path through the trees towards the castle ruins. The castle, once complete, had a square area enclosed by a high wall, with various structures inside. The primary building was the square tower, while the hexagonal tower housed Queen Mary's prison. Other buildings, now in ruins, included a chapel, ovens, and a brewery. The guide provided detailed information about the castle's history, especially Queen Mary's escape, with a gentle tone and a Scottish accent that added to the ambiance of the place.|"['1.

"Young Douglass, Lady Douglass's son, was a compassionate lad at just eighteen years old. Despite his mother's enmity with Queen Mary, he devised a plan to aid her escape. Initially, his brother George had a plan for Mary to disguise herself as a laundress.

Rollo and Waldron climbed a narrow and worn stairway to a room above Queen Mary's chamber. The guide described how young Douglass swapped the castle keys with false ones to deceive his mother.

Once upon a time, a palace was constructed next to the abbey. Today, remnants of the abbey and the palace still stand. As the palace was established, a town gradually emerged nearby. Many nobles from the realm arrived and built homes along the street leading from the palace to the castle, now known as High Street. The houses faced the street, while their gardens extended down the slopes into the valleys on either side. Lanes between the houses led down the slopes, closed off at the bottom by walls enclosing the town. Over time, the town expanded into the valleys and beyond to other hills. Bridges were erected across the valleys, connecting the hills, and tunnels were dug, creating an extraordinary town layout. One prominent hill, Arthur's Seat, featured Salisbury Crags, forming a distinctive sight. Despite the picturesque scenery, rain obscured the view for the arriving party in Edinburgh. They entered the town through a tunnel, emerging at the bottom of a deep valley, requiring them to climb to street level and then ascend a hill to reach their hotel on Prince's Street. The street overlooked a long valley, with Castle Hill in the distance, showcasing the backs of houses resembling cliffs. At one end of the hill stood the castle rock with its ancient fortifications. Upon reaching their hotel, the boys admired the castle and surrounding structures, sparking their interest in Scottish history.|"['1.

Mr. George mentioned that Mary may have been willing, but her family disagreed. Powerful nobles and chieftains in the kingdom caused trouble by taking sides. Darnley, feeling he lacked control, mistreated Mary, causing her sadness. She sought solace with close friends like David Rizzio, her private secretary. Darnley's jealousy led to a plot to eliminate Rizzio. The murder occurred during a supper in Mary's tower room. The palace had two wings, each with towers. Mary's rooms were in the left wing, with a main bedroom and small oratory and sitting rooms in the towers. The murder of Rizzio took place in the sitting room during the evening.|"[""1.

In the old palace, Mary's bedroom was in the front part between two towers, and she had a large room behind it. Darnley's rooms were below Mary's, with a private passage connecting them, a common practice in high society. The private passage had a narrow stairway leading to Mary's bedroom. The room behind Mary's bedroom, known as the audience chamber, had antique furniture and ancient pictures on the walls. A worn-out fireplace with a movable iron grate, said to be the oldest in Scotland, was also in the room. The window overlooked a green park, and an ancient table brought by Mary from France stood in a recess. The ceiling was intricately carved. The adjacent room was Queen Mary's bed chamber, with a grand bedstead and faded coverings. Visitors were not allowed to touch anything due to past souvenir-taking incidents.|"[""1.

In the corner of the room, there's a door on the left leading to a small boudoir where Rizzio was killed. You can catch a glimpse of this room in the picture. Mr. George and the boys explored it. Inside, there was a table at the back displaying armor, gloves, and one of Darnley's boots. The boys even lifted a breastplate from the armor, feeling how heavy it was. They noticed a bullet indentation on it. The boot was also incredibly thick with a heel measuring three inches. In the same room, there was a fireplace and an altar-piece over it, a stone picture used by Mary for prayer. It had been broken by John Knox but later pieced back together. Additionally, a square stone block where Mary knelt during her coronation was present. Under the tapestry to the right of the boudoir door, there was an opening leading to a narrow and dark staircase used by conspirators. The boys peered down but couldn't descend as it was closed off below. These stairs once connected Darnley's rooms to Mary's private chapel. In a window recess, there was a tall stand with a basket containing baby linen, a gift from Queen Elizabeth when Mary's child, who later became King James, was born. This child, however, wasn't born in this room but in the castle. The basket, lined with costly lace, was a remnant of the original gift. The attendant shared these|['1.

"""She was very skilled with her needle,"" the attendant explained. ""She learned this art in France, at the convent where she was educated. The tapestry hanging on the wall was crafted by the nuns at that convent, with Mary's assistance."" Apart from the bedroom and boudoir, there was an oratory, a small room similar to the boudoir in the other tower. This room, not shown in the picture, had minimal furniture, including ancient chairs, tall candlestick stands, and a peculiar-shaped mirror. The mirror, although a curiosity, was worn out, making it hard to see one's reflection. Mr. George and the boys then returned to Lord Darnley's apartments below, where they noticed a picture of Queen Mary in the dress she wore on the day of her beheading. The attire was dark silk or velvet, fitting snugly and having a high neckline. Despite showing signs of time and grief, the portrait displayed a sweet expression reminiscent of her earlier years. Mr. George elaborated on the complexities surrounding Mary's claim to the English crown, highlighting the disputes with Elizabeth and the eventual tragic fate that befell Mary."|"['1.

"""No,"" Mr. George explained, ""Queen Elizabeth did not directly order Mary's execution. She appointed judges to try her for treason, and they sentenced her to death. Elizabeth could have saved her, but chose not to. Later, Elizabeth pretended to be angry at those who carried out the sentence and acted sorrowful for Mary's death.""""We shouldn't judge Elizabeth harshly for this,"" Mr. George continued. ""It's human nature. Sometimes we desire something to happen, but regret it afterward.""Queen Elizabeth was proud and ambitious, loving power and royal grandeur. She couldn't stand anyone challenging her rule.""After their visit, the group headed to the castle. While walking, Waldron chased a cab, revealing his father inside. Mr. Kennedy explained he had to return to America immediately. After discussions, it was decided Waldron would go home.

"""We had a great time exploring the castle,"" Rollo shared. ""We walked up High Street, passing by a cathedral where a woman once threw a stool at the minister during the reformation times. Her name was Jenny Geddes. We also saw the parade ground with a stunning view over the town and country.""

As we entered the castle gates, we encountered soldiers on guard and cannons pointing outwards. We climbed a steep road, surrounded by walls, towers, and soldiers on sentry duty. We heard bagpipes playing below a bridge and saw men in uniform.

Continuing higher, we reached the upper part of the castle with platforms and cannons overlooking the countryside. Inside a large square court, we found signs leading us to the crown room where other visitors were heading too."""|['1.

"Yes,"" answered Rollo. ""In the center of the room, there was a large iron cage, tall as my head, and proportionally wide. Inside the cage, on cushions, were the crown and jewels. They were placed so deep inside that people couldn't touch them through the bars. Many onlookers surrounded the cage, peering in to admire the crown and jewels.""""Yes,"" Rollo added, ""there was a huge oak chest, either iron or brass bound, where the crown and jewels were hidden for many years. When Scotland joined England, these treasures were stored in this chest. Over time, nobody knew their exact location. Eventually, the authorities searched for them, finding the treasures in the old chest.""While observing the chest,"" Rollo continued, ""I heard music in the courtyard. Requesting permission from Uncle George, I went out and witnessed the Highland regiment's parade. I stayed to watch their drills.""Later, Rollo shared more about the castle with Waldron. Before concluding, Mr. George arrived, signaling it was time to depart. Rollo mentioned it was not their final farewell. Further excursions were made by Mr. George and Rollo, including a visit to Linlithgow, where the ruins of an ancient palace, Queen Mary's birthplace, stand.

Mr. George and Rollo explored Melrose Abbey, a stunning ancient ruin in southern Scotland. They also visited Abbotsford, once home to Walter Scott, a famous Scottish writer. Scott filled his house with historical artifacts, making it a museum of Scottish history. Melrose and Abbotsford are near the border with England. After their visits, Mr. George and Rollo took a train to Berwick, on the boundary line, bidding Scotland goodbye. The Rollo series by Rev. Jacob Abbott and the Francis Forrester series offer beautifully illustrated books for young readers. The Glen Morris Stories aim to inspire good values in children, while the elocution and declamation book provides fresh and engaging content for schools and students.|"[""**1.
