"In Shropshire, there is a famous oak tree known as the ""Royal Oak."" Legend has it that this oak is a descendant of a tree that stood in the same spot over two hundred years ago. The original oak served as a hiding place for King Charles II, son of the ill-fated Charles I. Charles II sought refuge in the oak after being crowned against the Parliament's wishes by the Scottish people.
