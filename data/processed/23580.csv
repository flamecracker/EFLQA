In the ancient times, Jehovah looked upon the Earth and saw the wickedness of mankind. He decided to bring a great flood to cleanse the world. However, Noah found favor in God's eyes.

Joseph's brothers plotted against him, but Judah intervened to save his life. Instead of killing Joseph, they decided to sell him to a passing group of Ishmaelites. Joseph was taken to Egypt, where he ended up in the service of Potiphar. Despite facing temptations from Potiphar's wife, Joseph remained faithful and refused to betray his trust. When falsely accused by Potiphar's wife, Joseph was unjustly thrown into prison. However, even in prison, Joseph's integrity and character shone through, earning him the respect of the prison keeper.

During the seven years of plenty, Joseph stored abundant food in Egypt's cities. The grain filled the storehouses like sand on the seashore. When the seven years of plenty ended, famine struck. Yet, Egypt had food due to Joseph's wise planning. People from other lands came to buy grain. Jacob sent his sons, except Benjamin, to Egypt for food. Unknowingly, they met Joseph, who recognized them but pretended not to. Joseph accused them of being spies and demanded they bring Benjamin to prove their honesty. After three days in prison, Joseph allowed them to leave with grain but insisted on seeing Benjamin. Jacob's sons returned home, worried about their fate.|"['1.

Joseph's brothers were filled with guilt for how they had treated him in the past. Reuben reminded them that he had warned them not to harm Joseph, but they did not listen. Unbeknownst to them, Joseph understood their conversation even though he spoke to them through an interpreter. Overcome with emotion, Joseph wept but eventually composed himself. He ordered Simeon to be bound before their eyes and provided them with grain and returned their money. When they returned to their father Jacob, they recounted their encounter in Egypt, expressing their fear and confusion about the returned money in their sacks. Jacob lamented the loss of Joseph and Simeon and was reluctant to send Benjamin to Egypt. However, Judah assured Jacob that he would take responsibility for Benjamin's safety.

Joseph was surprised to see Benjamin among his brothers. He instructed his steward to bring the men inside, prepare a meal, and have them dine with him at noon. The steward followed Joseph's orders and brought the men into Joseph's house.

They explained the situation to the steward, mentioning that they had brought back the money and even more to buy food. The steward reassured them, saying that their God had given them the treasure. Simeon was brought out to them, and they were given water to wash their feet and fodder for their donkeys. They prepared a gift for Joseph and awaited his arrival.

The steward caught up with them and spoke sternly. They defended themselves, reminding him they returned the money found in their sacks from Canaan. They were shocked by the accusation of theft.

The Egyptians oppressed the Hebrews with hard labor, but the more they were mistreated, the more they multiplied. A Hebrew woman hid her son, Moses, and set him afloat in the Nile. Pharaoh's daughter found him and raised him as her own, naming him Moses. When Moses grew up, he saw an Egyptian mistreating a Hebrew and intervened, killing the Egyptian.

After a long time, the king of Egypt passed away. Moses was tending the flock of Jethro, his wife's father, when he led them to Horeb, the mountain of God. There, the angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire from a thorn bush that burned but was not consumed. Moses was amazed and decided to investigate.

Moses gathered the leaders of Israel and instructed them to select lambs from their herds and sacrifice the passover lamb. They were to dip a bunch of hyssop in the lamb's blood and mark their doorposts with it. They were to remain inside until morning, for Jehovah would pass through to strike the Egyptians but spare the Israelites marked with blood. This event was to be observed as a custom forever. At midnight, Jehovah struck down the eldest sons of Egypt, causing great sorrow. Pharaoh then allowed Moses and the Israelites to leave, urging them to worship Jehovah. The Israelites, along with a mixed multitude, left Egypt, carrying unraised dough for lack of time. Jehovah guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night. When the Egyptians pursued, Jehovah saved the Israelites by parting the sea, allowing them to cross on dry land. The Egyptians, following, were defeated as the sea closed upon them.|"['1.

Jehovah instructed Moses to stretch his hand over the sea, causing the waters to return and drown the Egyptians. The Israelites witnessed this powerful act and feared Jehovah, believing in Him and Moses. Jehovah spoke to Moses from the mountain, declaring that if the Israelites obeyed Him, they would be His treasured people. Moses conveyed this to the people, and Jehovah promised to appear in a cloud to ensure their belief. The people were to prepare themselves for Jehovah's arrival on Mount Sinai. On the third day, thunder, lightning, and a loud trumpet blast signaled Jehovah's presence.

The Israelites journeyed to the South Country and reached Hebron. In the valley of Eshcol, they gathered a cluster of grapes so large it needed two men to carry it on a pole. They also collected pomegranates and figs. This area was named the valley of the Grape Cluster due to the bountiful harvest. Upon returning to Moses, Aaron, and the Israelites at Kadesh, they shared the fruits of the land. The scouts described the land as abundant with milk and honey, but the people living there were strong and the cities well-fortified. Despite Caleb's encouragement to conquer the land, fear gripped the hearts of the people, who saw themselves as small compared to the giants in the land. This led to cries of despair, questioning Jehovah's plan. Joshua and Caleb, however, remained faithful, assuring the people that Jehovah would guide them to victory.|['1.

Joshua was given a great task by Moses before he passed away. Moses encouraged Joshua to be strong and brave, assuring him that Jehovah would be with him and guide him to lead the people into the land promised to their ancestors. Despite Moses not being able to enter the land himself, he showed Joshua the land from afar. After Moses' death, Jehovah spoke to Joshua, reminding him to be courageous and follow the laws faithfully. Joshua, filled with wisdom, prepared the people to cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land. He sent spies, who were hidden by Rahab, a woman who believed in Jehovah.

Once upon a time, in a city surrounded by walls, a brave woman helped two men escape from danger. She lowered them down from a window with a rope and instructed them to hide in the hills for three days. Before they left, the men made a promise to her that they would spare her and her family if she tied a scarlet thread in the window. The woman agreed, and the men set off to safety. Meanwhile, Joshua, a leader, prepared the Israelites to cross the Jordan River. With faith in Jehovah, they followed the priests carrying the ark. Miraculously, the river stopped flowing, allowing them to pass on dry ground. To commemorate this event, twelve stones were taken from the riverbed.

Long ago, the Midianites ruled over the Israelites, causing great hardship. The Israelites had to hide in mountains and caves to protect themselves.

When Saul found out that David and his men were discovered, he was seated under a tamarisk tree in Gibeah with his spear in hand. His servants surrounded him. Saul accused his servants of conspiring against him with David, suspecting that David had made agreements against him. Doeg the Edomite informed Saul that David had visited Ahimelech, the priest, seeking food and Goliath's sword. Saul summoned Ahimelech and accused him of supporting David. Despite Ahimelech's denial, Saul ordered his guards to kill the priests. When they refused, Doeg executed them, except for Abiathar, who fled to David. David then saved Keilah from the Philistines after seeking guidance from Jehovah, despite his men's initial fears.|"['1.

When Abiathar, the son of Ahimelech, sought refuge with David in Keilah, he brought the priestly robe for seeking guidance from Jehovah. Saul, upon learning of David's presence in Keilah, saw an opportunity to capture him. Saul mobilized his forces to besiege David, but David, aware of Saul's plans, sought guidance from Jehovah through Abiathar. Jehovah revealed that Saul would come and that the people of Keilah would betray David. David and his men, around six hundred, left Keilah to evade Saul. Saul, informed of David's escape, pursued him to the Wilderness of Ziph. Meanwhile, David spotted Saul's camp, where Saul lay asleep with his spear by his head. Abishai suggested striking Saul, but David refused, choosing not to harm the ruler chosen by Jehovah. Instead, David took Saul's spear and water jug while he slept, demonstrating his mercy.|"['1.

Saul recognized David's voice and asked him why he was being pursued. David explained that if Saul was influenced by God, then let an offering be made, but if it was instigated by men, may they be cursed. Saul acknowledged his mistake and asked David to return. David showed mercy and spared Saul's life. Later, David encountered Nabal, a wealthy but rude man. When David's men sought help from Nabal, he insulted them.

One day, a young man warned Abigail, Nabal's wife, about David's messengers who were insulted by Nabal. The young man praised David and his men for their protection while guarding the sheep.

David asked Abigail to marry him. Abigail agreed and humbly offered to wash the feet of David's servants. She quickly rode with her maids to meet David and became his wife. Later, David, fearing Saul, sought refuge with the Philistines. He lived with Achish in Gath and was given the town of Ziklag. David raided neighboring tribes and deceived Achish about his actions, gaining his trust. When the Philistines prepared for war against Israel, Achish wanted David to join him. However, the Philistine commanders objected, fearing David might turn against them in battle.

On the third day, David and his men returned to Ziklag to find that the Amalekites had raided the town, burning it and taking captive the women and children. Distraught, David wept along with his followers. Feeling bitter, the people even considered stoning David. However, David found courage in his trust in Jehovah. He and his men encountered an Egyptian left behind by the Amalekites, who offered to guide them to the raiders in exchange for his safety. With the Egyptian's help, David defeated the Amalekites, rescuing his wives and recovering all that was taken. David ensured that even the tired men who stayed behind received an equal share of the spoils, establishing a fair law in Israel.

After the Israelites saw that Saul and his sons were dead, they fled, and the Philistines took over their towns. The Philistines even cut off Saul's head and displayed his armor in their temple. However, the brave men of Jabesh in Gilead heard of this and marched all night to retrieve the bodies of Saul and his sons. They mourned over them and buried them with respect. Meanwhile, David, who had recently returned victorious, learned of Saul's death. He mourned deeply and sought guidance from Jehovah. With Jehovah's blessing, David went to Hebron with his family and followers. The people of Judah recognized David as their ruler.

All the tribes of Israel gathered around David in Hebron, declaring their kinship and acknowledging him as their leader. They made an agreement in the presence of Jehovah, appointing David as the ruler of Israel. At thirty years old, David began his forty-year reign. Three of David's warriors braved the Philistine camp to fetch him water from Bethlehem. Despite his thirst, David poured out the water as an offering to Jehovah, honoring the risk taken by his men. With Jehovah's guidance, David triumphed over the Philistines at Baal-perazim. When the Philistines returned, Jehovah instructed David to outmaneuver them, leading to another victory. David's power grew as Jehovah supported him. King Hiram of Tyre aided David in building a palace. David gathered the people to bring the ark of God to Baal-Judah, but a misstep led to tragedy when Uzzah touched the ark.

When King David learned that Obed-edom's household was blessed because of the ark of God, he joyfully brought the ark to the City of David. As the bearers carried the ark, David offered sacrifices and danced with all his might before Jehovah. The people of Israel celebrated with shouts and trumpets. After placing the ark in a tent, David made burnt offerings and blessed the people. God promised through the prophet Nathan that David's legacy would endure, and his son would have a strong rule.

Once, while King David was overseeing a battle, he saw a beautiful woman named Bathsheba bathing. David inquired about her and learned she was married to Uriah the Hittite. Despite this, David had Bathsheba brought to him and later sent her husband Uriah to the front lines of battle, where he was killed. When David found out, he tried to cover up his actions, but the prophet Nathan confronted him. Nathan told David a story about a rich man who took a poor man's only lamb instead of using his own flock.

David confessed his sin to Nathan, who told him Jehovah forgave him but that there would be consequences. When David's child fell ill, he prayed and fasted, hoping for mercy. Sadly, the child died after seven days. David's servants were afraid to tell him, but when he found out, he accepted it, cleaned up, and worshipped at the temple. Later, his son Absalom sought to win the people's favor by pretending to be a fair judge. He won their hearts and eventually rebelled against David, gathering support to become king.

When a messenger told David that the hearts of the Israelite men had turned to Absalom, David urged his servants in Jerusalem to flee to escape Absalom's wrath. Reluctantly, David's loyal followers agreed. As they left the city, David advised Ittai, a foreigner, to remain with the new ruler. However, Ittai pledged his allegiance to David, stating he would stay by his side no matter what. David allowed Ittai to march on with him. The people wept as they followed David through the Kidron valley towards the wilderness. Along the way, Zadok and Abiathar carried the ark of Jehovah. David instructed them to return the ark to Jerusalem, leaving his fate in Jehovah's hands. Hushai, a loyal friend, met David on the summit and decided to stay in the city to deceive Absalom. Absalom, accompanied by Ahithophel, arrived in Jerusalem. Absalom questioned Hushai's loyalty, but Hushai cleverly pledged his allegiance to Absalom, intending to serve him as he had served David.|"[""Question 1: Why did David urge his servants in Jerusalem to flee?\nA) Because of a plague\nB) To avoid Absalom's anger\nC) To search for a hidden treasure\nD) To join a battle\nE) To attend a royal banquet"", ""Question 2: What did Ittai decide to do when David advised him to stay with the new ruler?\nA) He pledged his allegiance to David\nB) He betrayed David\nC) He joined Absalom's side\nD) He left Jerusalem\nE) He fled to a different country"", 'Question 3: Why did David instruct Zadok and Abiathar to return the ark to Jerusalem?\nA) To keep it safe from Absalom\nB) To perform a religious ceremony\nC) To seek advice from it\nD) To offer sacrifices\nE) To abandon their faith', 'Question 4: Who decided to stay in the city to deceive Absalom?\nA) Zadok\nB) Ittai\nC) Abiathar\nD) Hushai\nE) Ahithophel', ""Question 5: How did Hushai respond when Absalom questioned his loyalty?\nA) He admitted to betraying David\nB) He declared his allegiance to Absalom\nC) He remained silent\nD) He fled from Jerusalem\nE) He joined David's side"", 'Question 6: Where did the people follow David through as they left Jerusalem?\nA) The Red Sea\nB) The Nile River\nC) The Jordan River\nD) The Euphrates River\nE) The Kidron valley']"|"[""B) To avoid Absalom's anger"", 'A) He pledged his allegiance to David', 'A) To keep it safe from Absalom', 'D) Hushai', 'B) He declared his allegiance to Absalom', 'E) The Kidron valley']"
In ancient times, Ahithophel's advice was highly regarded by David and Absalom, as if it came from God. Ahithophel suggested to Absalom to ambush David with twelve thousand men while he was tired, to frighten him and make his followers flee. The plan was to kill only David and bring back the people to Absalom. However, Hushai advised against it, warning that David was a skilled warrior who could evade them. Hushai proposed gathering all of Israel's forces to ensure David's defeat. Absalom and his council favored Hushai's plan over Ahithophel's. Hushai then sent a message to David through messengers, urging him to cross the Jordan River to avoid danger. Eventually, David and his people followed Hushai's advice and safely crossed the river before Absalom's forces could harm them.|"[""1.

After Absalom and the Israelite men crossed the Jordan, David organized his troops into three divisions led by Joab, Abishai, and Ittai. Despite David's wish to join the battle, the people insisted he stay behind to protect the city. Reluctantly, David agreed. The battle took place in the forest of Ephraim, resulting in the defeat of the soldiers loyal to David, with a loss of twenty thousand men. Absalom, riding a mule, got caught in an oak tree, and Joab, upon hearing about it, killed Absalom against the man's advice. A slave was sent to inform David of Absalom's fate. When David heard the news, he grieved deeply for his son, lamenting his loss. The people, upon learning of David's mourning, felt ashamed and quietly returned to the city, while David openly mourned for his son, Absalom.|"['1.

When David grew old, his son Adonijah decided to become the ruler of Israel. Adonijah, who was handsome and the next younger son after Absalom, made plans to seize the throne. He formed alliances with Joab and Abiathar but did not have the support of key figures like Zadok, Benaiah, and Nathan. Adonijah held a grand feast to assert his claim, excluding important individuals like Solomon and Nathan. Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, learned of Adonijah's actions and sought David's intervention. Nathan advised Bathsheba to remind David of his promise to make Solomon his successor. David, upon hearing this, declared Solomon as his heir and ordered a ceremony to crown him as the new ruler of Israel. Solomon's appointment was met with approval and blessings from the gathered officials.|"[""1.

"Zadok, Nathan, and Benaiah, along with the Philistine body-guards, escorted Solomon to Gihon on David's mule. Zadok, the priest, anointed Solomon with oil, and the people cheered, ""May Solomon live!"" The crowd followed, playing flutes and rejoicing loudly. Adonijah and his guests heard the commotion and fled in fear. Adonijah sought refuge by clinging to the altar's horns. Solomon assured Adonijah safety if he proved worthy. Later, Jehovah appeared to Solomon in a dream, offering him a wish. Solomon asked for wisdom to govern justly. Pleased with his request, God granted Solomon wisdom, riches, and honor.

In the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, he constructed the temple of Jehovah. The temple was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high. The porch in front of the temple was 30 feet wide and 15 feet deep. Solomon made windows for the temple with casings, wider inside and narrower outside. The temple was built with stone prepared at the quarry, without the noise of any tools heard during its construction. Solomon added wings to the temple walls, surrounding the large room and inner chamber, with side-chambers around the temple. The entrance to the lower side-chambers was on the south side. Winding stairs led to the upper floors. Inside the temple, there were intricate carvings of gourds and flowers. Solomon placed two olive wood winged bulls in the inner room, covered in gold. The ark of Jehovah was placed in the inner room under the wings of the bulls. Solomon then gathered the leaders of Israel to bring the ark to its place in the temple. As the priests brought in the ark, a cloud filled the temple, signifying the glory of Jehovah. Solomon praised Jehovah for his faithfulness and built his palace and the Hall of Judgment.|['1.

In ancient times, King Solomon built a magnificent palace for himself, just like the Hall of Judgment. He also constructed a beautiful palace for his wife, Pharaoh's daughter. These grand buildings were made of expensive stones, meticulously crafted inside and out. Solomon was a wise and powerful king who amassed a great army of chariots and horsemen to protect his kingdom. He had twelve officers overseeing the provisions for his household. When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's wisdom, she visited him with gifts and challenging questions. Impressed by his wisdom and prosperity, she praised him. However, as Solomon aged, he made a grave mistake by marrying many foreign wives who led him astray into worshipping other gods. This angered Jehovah and led to adversaries rising against him. Eventually, the kingdom was divided, and Solomon's son faced a difficult decision after his father's reign.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did King Solomon build for himself in ancient times?\nA) A grand army\nB) A magnificent palace\nC) A beautiful garden\nD) A temple\nE) A marketplace', ""Question 2:\nWho did King Solomon build a beautiful palace for?\nA) His mother\nB) His sister\nC) His daughter\nD) His wife, Pharaoh's daughter\nE) His cousin"", 'Question 3:\nHow did the queen of Sheba react after meeting King Solomon?\nA) She declared war on his kingdom\nB) She challenged him to a duel\nC) She praised his wisdom and prosperity\nD) She stole from his treasury\nE) She ignored him completely', 'Question 4:\nWhat led to adversaries rising against King Solomon?\nA) His generosity\nB) His wisdom\nC) His foreign wives\nD) His powerful army\nE) His beautiful palace', 'Question 5:\nWhat mistake did King Solomon make as he aged?\nA) Building more palaces\nB) Abandoning his kingdom\nC) Marrying many foreign wives\nD) Neglecting his people\nE) Going on unnecessary wars', ""Question 6:\nWhat happened to the kingdom after Solomon's reign?\nA) It prospered greatly\nB) It was divided\nC) It was invaded by a neighboring kingdom\nD) It became a democracy\nE) It disappeared""]"|"['B) A magnificent palace', ""D) His wife, Pharaoh's daughter"", 'C) She praised his wisdom and prosperity', 'C) His foreign wives', 'C) Marrying many foreign wives', 'B) It was divided']"
Rehoboam, the new king, faced a tough decision. The people wanted lighter burdens than those imposed by his father. Seeking counsel, he asked the older wise men and his young friends. Ignoring the elders' advice, he heeded the young men's harsh words, promising an even heavier yoke and harsher punishment. This angered the people, leading to a rebellion. Rehoboam sent Adoniram, but the people stoned him. Fleeing, Rehoboam barely escaped. The kingdom split, with Jeroboam ruling Israel and only Judah remaining loyal to David's house. Later, Omri ruled Israel, followed by his son Ahab, who angered Jehovah with his actions. Jehovah directed Elijah to the Brook Cherith, where ravens provided food. When the brook dried, Elijah met a widow, miraculously ensuring her sustenance during the drought.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was Rehoboam's tough decision about?\nA) Choosing a new capital city\nB) Deciding on a new religion for the kingdom\nC) Determining whether to go to war with a neighboring kingdom\nD) Deciding whether to lighten the burdens imposed on the people\nE) Selecting a new queen for the kingdom"", 'Question 2:\nWho did Rehoboam seek counsel from to help him make his decision?\nA) The army generals\nB) The foreign ambassadors\nC) The young children in the kingdom\nD) The older wise men and his young friends\nE) The royal advisors', ""Question 3:\nWhat was the outcome of Rehoboam's decision to heed the advice of the young men?\nA) The people rejoiced and celebrated\nB) The kingdom prospered and became wealthy\nC) The people were satisfied and content\nD) The people rebelled against Rehoboam\nE) Rehoboam was hailed as the greatest king in history"", 'Question 4:\nWho did Rehoboam send to the people after they rebelled?\nA) Adoniram\nB) Elijah\nC) Jeroboam\nD) Omri\nE) Ahab', 'Question 5:\nWhat was the consequence of Rehoboam sending Adoniram to the people?\nA) The people welcomed him with open arms\nB) The people stoned him\nC) The people crowned him as their new king\nD) The people offered him gifts and treasures\nE) The people banished him from the kingdom', 'Question 6:\nWho ruled Israel after the kingdom split due to the rebellion against Rehoboam?\nA) Rehoboam\nB) Adoniram\nC) Jeroboam\nD) Omri\nE) Ahab']"|['D) Deciding whether to lighten the burdens imposed on the people', 'D) The older wise men and his young friends', 'D) The people rebelled against Rehoboam', 'A) Adoniram', 'B) The people stoned him', 'C) Jeroboam']

Elijah challenged the prophets of Baal to a test. They called on their god, but nothing happened. Elijah then rebuilt the altar of Jehovah and poured water on the wood three times. He prayed to Jehovah, and fire came down, consuming the offering and water. The people recognized Jehovah as the true God. Elijah ordered the prophets of Baal to be captured and executed. He then told King Ahab that rain was coming. While Ahab ate, Elijah prayed for rain. After seven tries, a small cloud appeared. Elijah told Ahab to prepare for rain. Soon, a heavy rain fell.

When Ahab informed Jezebel that Elijah had killed the prophets, she threatened Elijah's life. Frightened, Elijah fled to Beersheba and then into the wilderness, feeling hopeless and asking to die. An angel appeared, providing food and water, giving him strength for a long journey. Elijah traveled to Horeb, where he encountered Jehovah. Amidst powerful natural phenomena, Jehovah spoke in a gentle whisper, questioning Elijah's presence. Jehovah instructed Elijah to anoint Hazael, Jehu, and Elisha for important roles. Elijah found Elisha plowing and passed his mantle to him, symbolizing the transfer of prophetic duties.

Jezebel, in Ahab's name, sent letters to the leaders of Naboth's city, falsely accusing Naboth of blaspheming God and the ruler of Israel. The leaders obeyed Jezebel's orders, and Naboth was stoned to death based on these lies. When Ahab learned of Naboth's death, Jezebel told him to take Naboth's vineyard. However, Jehovah sent Elijah to confront Ahab. Ahab was warned that he would meet a grim fate for his actions, and Jezebel would also face a similar fate. Despite this, Ahab still sought to take possession of Naboth's vineyard. Later, Ahab proposed to Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth in Gilead.

When Ahab asked Micaiah about going to fight in Ramoth in Gilead, Micaiah advised him to go and conquer, assuring him that Jehovah would grant him victory. However, Ahab was skeptical and accused Micaiah of never speaking the truth in Jehovah's name. Micaiah then revealed a vision where he saw the Israelites scattered like sheep without a shepherd, with Jehovah decreeing that they should go home in peace. Ahab was displeased and ordered Micaiah's imprisonment until his return from battle. Despite Micaiah's warning, Ahab disguised himself for battle while Jehoshaphat wore his robes.

Elisha was a faithful follower of the prophet Elijah. When Elijah was about to be taken away by Jehovah, Elisha refused to leave his side. As they journeyed together, Elijah asked Elisha what he desired before he departed. Elisha asked for a double portion of Elijah's spirit, a challenging request. Elijah told him that if he witnessed his departure, his wish would be granted.

"Elisha, a wise man of God, had a servant named Gehazi. One day, Gehazi lied to Elisha about where he had been, but Elisha knew the truth through divine insight. Gehazi's greed led him to take gifts from Naaman, a wealthy man Elisha had helped cure of leprosy. As a consequence, Gehazi was struck with leprosy himself.

Additionally, Elisha's ability to foresee the plans of the king of Aram saved Israel multiple times. He warned the ruler of Israel about the Arameans' ambushes, frustrating the king of Aram. When the Arameans tried to capture Elisha, he prayed to God, and they were struck blind.

During the reigns of these kings, the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will last forever. A stone, not cut by human hands, will break and destroy all other kingdoms. King Nebuchadrezzar worshipped Daniel for revealing this secret. Nebuchadrezzar then made Daniel a ruler over Babylon and promoted his friends. The king erected a large golden image and commanded all to worship it. When the music played, everyone bowed except for Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Furious, the king threatened to throw them into a fiery furnace. The three men stood firm, declaring their faith in their God.

"King Nebuchadrezzar was amazed to see Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego unharmed in the fiery furnace, even though they had been bound and thrown into the fire. Nebuchadrezzar saw a fourth figure that looked like an angel walking with them. He called them out of the fire, and they emerged untouched by the flames. The king praised the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego for saving them. He commanded that anyone who spoke against their God would face severe consequences. Nebuchadrezzar then elevated the three men to high positions in Babylon.

Later, King Belshazzar hosted a grand feast where he used the gold and silver vessels taken from the temple in Jerusalem to drink wine. As they praised false gods, a mysterious writing appeared on the wall, troubling the king. Despite consulting his wise men, they could not interpret the writing. The queen suggested calling Daniel, known for his wisdom and understanding. Daniel, filled with the spirit of the holy gods, offered to decipher the writing without expecting any reward.

Belshazzar, the Chaldean king, was warned for his arrogance and disrespect towards God. He saw a mysterious writing on the wall that foretold the end of his kingdom. Daniel, a wise man, interpreted the writing, predicting the fall of Belshazzar's rule. Despite this, Belshazzar honored Daniel. Later, King Darius took over the kingdom and appointed Daniel as one of his chief officials. Jealous of Daniel's success, some officials plotted against him. They convinced the king to sign a law forbidding prayers to anyone but the king for 30 days. Daniel, faithful to his beliefs, continued to pray to God.

In ancient times, Mordecai, who sat at the king's gate, discovered a plot to harm King Xerxes by two of the king's servants. Mordecai informed Queen Esther, who then told the king. The conspirators were punished, but Haman, a high official, was promoted. Haman expected everyone to bow to him, but Mordecai, a Jew, refused. This angered Haman, who convinced the king to issue a decree to destroy all Jews in the kingdom. Mordecai mourned publicly, and Esther, upon learning of the plot, was troubled. Mordecai urged Esther to seek the king's mercy for her people. Esther hesitated, but Mordecai warned her that remaining silent could lead to her own downfall.

The king's advisor, Haman, wanted to harm Mordecai, but the king intervened and honored Mordecai instead. Haman was humiliated and eventually met his downfall. Queen Esther played a crucial role in saving her people, the Jews, from destruction. Through her bravery and wisdom, she gained the king's favor and was able to protect her people.

The Jews established a tradition to celebrate two feasts each year, known as Purim, to commemorate their deliverance from Haman's plot to destroy them. Cyrus, the king of Persia, influenced by Jehovah, issued a decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple.

A wise person uses few words and remains calm. Even a fool can seem wise by staying quiet. Speaking at the right time is valuable, like a precious gift. Kind words are comforting and healing. Lack of self-control is like a city without defenses. A wise person controls their anger, unlike a fool who easily loses their temper. Boasting about the future is unwise. Being self-assured can be more harmful than being foolish. Avoid arguments before they escalate. It's better to have peace with little than conflict in abundance. Showing compassion to the poor honors God. Ignoring the cries of the needy leads to unanswered calls. Those who help the poor lend to the Lord and will be rewarded.

When Jesus heard about John the Baptist's death, he sought solitude with his disciples. They sailed to a quiet place, but crowds followed. Jesus, moved by compassion, taught them. As evening approached, his disciples suggested sending the people to nearby places for food. Jesus instructed them to feed the crowd. With only five loaves and two fishes, Jesus performed a miracle. He blessed the food, broke it, and distributed it to the people. Everyone ate and was satisfied, with twelve baskets of leftovers. Later, Jesus walked on water to reach his disciples struggling in a storm. Despite initial fear, Jesus reassured them, demonstrating his power and care. The disciples were amazed but slow to grasp the significance of the miracle.|"[""1.

After Jesus and his disciples arrived at Gennesaret, they secured their boat and stepped ashore. The locals recognized Jesus and spread the word, leading to crowds bringing their sick to him on beds. In every city, town, or village he visited, people would lay their sick in the marketplaces, pleading to touch even the edge of his robe. Those who touched him were miraculously healed. Some Pharisees and scribes from Jerusalem questioned Jesus about his disciples not following the tradition of washing hands before eating. Jesus criticized them for prioritizing human traditions over God's commands. He then taught the crowd that true impurity comes from within, from evil thoughts and actions, not from external sources. Later, in Tyre and Sidon, a Phoenician woman sought Jesus' help for her possessed daughter, displaying strong faith, which led to her daughter's healing.

They replied, ""Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and some believe you are one of the prophets."" Jesus then asked them, ""But who do you say I am?"" Peter answered, ""You are the Christ."" Jesus instructed them not to reveal this to anyone. He then explained that he must suffer, be rejected, and killed, but would rise after three days. Peter tried to object, but Jesus rebuked him, saying, ""Get behind me, Satan!"" Jesus told his disciples and the crowd that to follow him, one must be willing to sacrifice themselves for the greater good.

"When Jesus arrived at Capernaum and entered a house, he asked his disciples, ""What were you discussing on the way?"" They remained silent as they had argued about who among them was the greatest. Jesus then gathered the twelve disciples and taught them, ""If anyone wants to be first, he must be the servant of all."" He illustrated this by embracing a child, emphasizing that welcoming a child in his name is akin to welcoming God. Continuing his journey, Jesus encountered Zaccheus, a tax collector, who climbed a tree to see him. Jesus invited himself to Zaccheus' house, prompting criticism from onlookers. Zaccheus, repentant, vowed to make amends for his wrongdoings. Jesus commended him for his change of heart, declaring salvation for his household. As Jesus departed Jericho, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus, called out for mercy. Despite objections, Jesus restored his sight, praising his faith.

At one point, people approached Jesus with news about the Galileans killed by Pilate while making sacrifices. Jesus asked them if they believed these Galileans were worse sinners than others. He warned that unless they repented and did right, they too would perish. Jesus also mentioned the eighteen men who died when the tower of Siloam fell on them, emphasizing that their sinfulness wasn't the cause of their death. He then went to the Temple, driving out those buying and selling, declaring it a house of prayer. This upset the chief priests and scribes, who sought ways to harm him but feared the people's response. Jesus later shared a parable about two sons and a vineyard to teach about repentance and righteousness.

"As Jesus spoke to the crowd, he warned them about the scribes who seek attention and take advantage of others. He criticized their hypocritical ways, pointing out how they neglect justice and mercy despite their outward displays of piety. Jesus emphasized the importance of inner purity over external appearances, likening the scribes to whitewashed tombs full of deceit and sin.

Later, Jesus shared a parable about ten maidens awaiting the bridegroom. Half of them were wise, prepared with extra oil for their torches, while the other half were foolish and unprepared. When the bridegroom arrived, the wise maidens entered the feast, leaving the unprepared maidens to seek oil elsewhere. Upon their return, they found themselves locked out, emphasizing the importance of readiness and foresight.

Jesus approached a man who had been cast out and asked him if he believed in the Son of God. The man was curious and wanted to know who the Son of God was so that he could believe. Jesus revealed that he was the Son of God and that he was speaking to the man. The man then professed his belief and worshiped Jesus. Jesus explained that he came to right wrongs, to help the blind see, and to humble those who claim to see but are blind to their sins. Some Pharisees questioned their own blindness, to which Jesus responded that acknowledging one's blindness would not make them guilty, but claiming to see while sinning would. Jesus emphasized that following his teachings would lead to true freedom. He compared himself to a door, offering salvation and abundant life, contrasting himself with hired shepherds who abandon the sheep in times of danger. Jesus proclaimed himself as the Good Shepherd who knows and cares for his flock, willing to sacrifice himself for their well-being. He also mentioned Lazarus, a beloved friend who had fallen ill, and despite knowing of his death, Jesus intended to go to him to demonstrate the power of faith.|"['1.

Joseph placed Jesus in a tomb and sealed it with a stone. After the Sabbath, the women brought spices to the tomb. They found the stone rolled away and an angel inside who told them Jesus had risen. The women shared this news with the disciples, who initially doubted. Later, Mary of Magdala saw Jesus but didn't recognize him until he called her name. She then told the disciples of his resurrection. Two disciples heading to Emmaus encountered Jesus, but they didn't recognize him until later.|"[""1.

When the two disciples arrived at the village they were heading to, a stranger seemed to be continuing his journey. However, they insisted he stay with them as evening approached. As they sat down to eat, the stranger took the bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them. Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him as Jesus, but then he vanished from their sight. Excited and amazed, they rushed back to Jerusalem to share their experience with the other disciples. While they were recounting what happened, Jesus appeared among them, causing fear and disbelief. To reassure them, Jesus showed his hands and feet, asking for food to eat to demonstrate he was not a ghost but truly alive.

On the Day of Pentecost, a powerful wind filled the house where they were gathered, and they began to speak in a strange way. Peter addressed the crowd, explaining that what they witnessed was the fulfillment of prophecy. He spoke of Jesus, whom they crucified but God raised from death. Peter urged them to repent, be baptized in Jesus' name, and receive the Holy Spirit. About three thousand believed that day. The believers met daily, sharing meals and praising God. One day, Peter and John healed a lame man, who leaped and praised God. The people were amazed, but Peter reminded them it was through faith in Jesus that the man was healed.|['1.

Brothers, listen! You acted unknowingly, but now turn to God, live righteously, and seek forgiveness. God will grant you strength.

About three hours later, Peter's wife entered, unaware of recent events. Peter asked if she sold the land for the stated amount, and she confirmed. Peter questioned her about conspiring against the Lord, warning her of her fate. Suddenly, she fell dead. This news spread fear among the church and the people. The disciples multiplied rapidly. The apostles addressed complaints about neglecting widows. They proposed selecting reputable men to oversee this task while they focused on preaching. The disciples agreed and chose seven men, including Stephen, known for his faith and miracles. Stephen's wisdom and spirit sparked disputes, leading to false accusations.

When Stephen was stoned to death, the church in Jerusalem faced persecution. The believers, except the apostles, scattered throughout Judea and Samaria, spreading the good news about Jesus. Philip went to Samaria, sharing the message of Jesus Christ. The people were amazed by the miracles he performed, bringing great joy to the city. Both men and women believed in Philip's teachings and were baptized. When the apostles in Jerusalem heard of the Samaritans' belief, they sent Peter and John. They prayed for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit. Philip was then instructed by an angel to go to Gaza. On his way, he met an Ethiopian official reading from the prophet Isaiah. Philip explained the scripture and baptized him. The Ethiopian rejoiced and continued his journey.

The following day, around noon, Peter was traveling and nearing Joppa when he went up to the rooftop to pray. While praying, messengers from Cornelius arrived at Simon's house, asking for Peter. The Spirit told Peter that three men were seeking him and instructed him to go with them. Peter welcomed the men, learning that Cornelius, a devout man, was eager to hear his message. Peter accompanied them to Cæsarea, where Cornelius awaited with family and friends. Cornelius bowed to Peter, who humbly refused worship. Peter shared his vision with Cornelius, and as he spoke, the Holy Spirit filled those present, including non-Jewish followers. Witnessing this, Peter baptized them in Jesus' name.

During the time when King Herod persecuted the church members, he killed James, the brother of John. Seeing that this pleased the Jews, he also captured Peter during the feast of unleavened bread. Peter was put in prison with four squads of soldiers guarding him. The church members prayed earnestly for Peter. On the night before his trial, an angel appeared to Peter in prison, releasing him from his chains and guiding him out past guards and gates. Peter thought it was a dream until he reached safety. When he went to the house of Mary, a girl named Rhoda was so excited to see him that she forgot to open the door. Despite initial disbelief, Peter shared how the Lord had saved him.

After fasting and praying, they were sent on their way. They sailed to Perga but Mark left for Jerusalem. Paul and Barnabas went to the synagogue in Antioch, where Paul spoke about Jesus and the promise of salvation. The people wanted to hear more, but some Jews got jealous and insulted Paul.

In Lystra, there was a man who had never walked since birth. When he heard Paul preach, the apostle saw his faith and commanded him to stand up. Miraculously, the man sprang to his feet and began to walk. The crowd mistook Paul and Barnabas for gods, calling them Zeus and Hermes. They even brought sacrifices to offer.

Jews from Antioch and Iconium turned the crowd against Paul, stoning him. Miraculously, Paul survived and continued his journey with Barnabas, spreading the good news.

On a Sabbath day, we ventured outside the city walls to the riverbank, seeking a place for prayer. Seated there, we engaged with a group of women who had gathered, including Lydia, a merchant of purple cloth from Thyatira, already devoted to God. The Lord opened her heart to Paul's teachings, leading to her and her household being baptized. Lydia graciously invited us to her home, where we stayed. During another visit to the prayer spot, a girl possessed by a spirit followed us, proclaiming Paul and Silas as servants of the Most High God. After enduring this for days, Paul commanded the spirit to leave the girl, causing a disturbance among her owners. Subsequently, Paul and Silas were unjustly beaten, imprisoned, and miraculously freed by an earthquake. The jailer, witnessing this, sought salvation and was baptized with his family. The city officials, realizing their mistake, ordered their release, but Paul insisted on a public acknowledgment of their Roman citizenship.|"['1.

After Paul and Silas were released from prison, they visited Lydia's house and encouraged the believers. They then journeyed to Thessalonica, where they spoke in the synagogue for three weeks, explaining that Jesus was the Christ. Many Jews, God-fearing Greeks, and leading women believed in their message. However, some Jews became jealous and incited a riot, accusing Paul and Silas of defying Caesar and proclaiming Jesus as king. The city officials were troubled but released them after Jason and others pledged peace. To protect Paul and Silas, the believers sent them to Berœa by night. In Berœa, many Jews and Greek men and women believed in Jesus after examining the scriptures daily. When troublemakers from Thessalonica arrived, Paul was sent away to Athens. In Athens, he shared the message of Jesus with the people, even addressing the philosophers at the Court of Areopagus, explaining that the God they unknowingly worshipped was the one he proclaimed.|"[""1.

As followers of God, we should not imagine Him as an object made by human hands like gold or silver. God has commanded everyone to repent and has appointed a day for judgment through a chosen one. Some mocked the idea of resurrection, while others wanted to hear more later. Paul left them, but some believed, including Dionysius and Damaris. In Athens and Corinth, Paul faced challenges but persevered to share the good news. He worked hard to not burden others, living as an example of integrity.

In a community, every person plays a vital role just like different parts of a body. Even though some parts may seem weaker, they are all necessary. When one part is hurt, it affects the whole body. Similarly, if one part is honored, it benefits the entire body. We are all connected as one body, each with a unique role. Just as the body has different parts like apostles, prophets, teachers, and healers, we all have our place in the community. Love is essential; without it, our actions are meaningless. Love is patient, kind, forgiving, and enduring. It is more important than any talent or knowledge. As we grow, we must put away childish behavior and strive to understand the importance of love and unity in our community.|['1.

When a person is resurrected from the dead, their body undergoes a transformation. It changes from being perishable to imperishable, from lacking honor to being glorious, from weak to powerful, and from being natural to spiritual. This change happens in an instant, as quick as the blink of an eye. This transformation is described in Scripture as victory over death, where death loses its power. The passage also discusses the collection of funds for the people in Jerusalem, advising regular contributions to avoid last-minute collections. Paul plans to visit after his work in Ephesus and encourages the safe passage of Timothy.

In a vision, I saw a magnificent throne with someone sitting on it, and the earth and sky disappeared from their presence. The dead, both important and humble, stood before the throne. Books were opened, including the Book of Life, and everyone was judged based on their deeds. The sea, Death, and the Abode of the Departed all gave up their dead for judgment. Then, a new heaven and earth appeared, along with the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, descending from God. A voice proclaimed that God would live among people, wiping away their tears and ending death, mourning, and pain. The one on the throne promised to make all things new, offering the fountain of life to the thirsty. The city was illuminated by the glory of God and the Lamb, with no need for sun or moon. Only those with their names in the Lamb's book of life would enter, and a river of the water of life flowed through the city. God and the Lamb's throne were in the city, where his servants would worship him forever. The time for these prophecies to come true is near, and everyone will be rewarded according to their deeds. Jesus urged all to come and partake of the water of life freely.|"['1.
