In ancient Hellas, Lydia, a tall and strong woman with golden hair and blue eyes, spun wool in her courtyard. She found Chloe, a slave girl abandoned as a baby, and raised her in her household. As Lydia spun, the sun cast a bright patch of light on the courtyard floor. Pigeons cooed on the thatched roof, and the sound of a loom echoed from a room above. Suddenly, the peaceful afternoon was interrupted by the sounds of sheep, cattle, and children playing. Two identical, blue-eyed, and golden-haired children, Dion and Daphne, rushed into the courtyard with a shepherd dog.

"Lydia replied, ""Until I can better serve you,"" as the two men exited through the open door and settled on a bench with a view of the valley. Inside, Lydia shed her formal demeanor and resumed her role as a busy housewife. Chloe and Daphne returned to find barley-cakes baking and sausages roasting.

In the courtyard, Chloe and Daphne set up a wooden table near the fire. They added a bench with lamb's wool cushions and a stool. Lydia asked Dion and the Stranger to come in for supper, reminding Dion to wash his hands. Chloe washed the feet of the guests, who reclined on the couch. They ate black broth and barley-cakes. Dion, not allowed sausage due to messy eating, watched enviously as the others enjoyed it. The children, taught to be quiet, sat by the hearth.

Pandora, feeling remorseful for opening the forbidden box, wept beside it. To her surprise, a tiny voice from the box reassured her. It was Hope, promising to stay with her always. This act of kindness dried Pandora's tears, and Hope has remained in the world ever since. The Philosopher, reflecting on Pandora's story, shared insights with Daphne, a girl curious about why women are often restricted from certain activities. He explained the myth of Daphne, a nymph who transformed into a laurel tree to escape Apollo's pursuit. Despite not being able to wear the victor's crown at the Olympian games, women like Daphne indirectly contribute to the tradition.

Daphne shifted from the Stranger to her Mother's side, eager to hear more stories. Dion, pleading with his Mother, asked for a tale about a boy this time. The Stranger agreed and began the captivating story of Perseus and how Athena aided him in defeating the Gorgon. The children, including Chloe, were mesmerized by the tale, forgetting time as the moon rose. Argos, their loyal dog, reminded them it was time to start the day. They swiftly dressed and emerged into the cool morning, greeted by the sounds of the farm awakening. The Stranger bid farewell and headed towards the seaport town.

When Dion and Daphne heard their Mother, they quickly got ready for breakfast with cold barley-cakes and warm goat's milk. Daphne packed their lunch, and they met Melas and Dromas, the shepherd, at the farm-yard gate. The Twins, Dion with a reed pipe and Daphne with a shepherd's crook, followed the flock of sheep, with Argos, toward the hills. Dromas warned them about the old black ewe's wandering habits. As they reached the hill pasture, the children saw the olive trees around their house to the east and a glimpse of the blue sea to the west. They heard the sheep grazing, the stream flowing, and saw Dromas plowing with oxen in the distance. The hillside offered places to play, like a hollow between boulders for a game of Apollo and Daphne, where Dion teased Daphne about boasting and the invisible presence of the Gods.|"[""1.

"Dion was scared. ""That's a terrible thing to say,"" he stated. ""You should never talk like that about the Gods. Oh no! Today is likely to be an unlucky day. Earlier, when Argos woke me, I was having a nightmare! That's a very bad omen."" The two kids left their cave among the rocks and headed towards the small stream, hidden by bushes. The sheep were peacefully grazing on the hillside, with the old black ewe in the middle. Argos sat on the hill in the sun, observing them. The sun was high, and the day warm. The children played by the stream, built a dam, and floated leaves downstream. Suddenly, they were startled by a distant howl, followed by the sound of many feet and sheep bleating. The children rushed to find the flock gone, with Argos barking. They chased after the sheep, eventually finding and calming them.

Argos, the faithful sheepdog, led the flock back home with precision. Despite Daphne's initial worry, the sheep followed Argos through the hills and fields, arriving safely at the farmyard gate just as the sunset colors faded. Dion and Daphne recounted the day's events to their father, Melas, who was disappointed in their lack of responsibility. To seek forgiveness, Melas made an offering to Pan and Apollo at the courtyard altar. The children were forbidden from herding the sheep again due to their father's concerns about their vigilance. Instead, they assisted Melas in planting the corn-field, working diligently to cover the seeds. Melas then crafted a scarecrow to protect the crops, utilizing sticks, straw, and an old sheepskin cloak.|"['1.

"""Daphne had a clever idea,"" said Melas. ""She made an amulet to scare the crows away from the field."" Unable to write, Melas scratched a curse on the bark amulet, hung it on the scarecrow, and hoped for the best. Worried it might be a blessing instead, they rushed back home. Melas, frustrated by the crows, instructed the children to use clappers to shoo them away while he tended the vineyard. Hungry, the Twins grabbed barley-cakes and milk, returning to the field to guard the crops. They rattled clappers, threw clods, and ate figs and cheese brought by Lydia.

The mysterious trio, Melas, Lydia, and Chloe, performed a peculiar ritual in the field. Lydia placed a jar next to a scarecrow, while Melas held a toad and led the group in a slow procession around the field. Upon their return, the toad was sealed in the jar and buried near the scarecrow. The following day, the farm celebrated a bountiful harvest. Everyone gathered at dawn to reap the ripe grain. Melas and two men led the harvesting, while Lydia and the women prepared a feast. Once the work was done, Melas offered a prayer of gratitude to Demeter, the Goddess of the fields, and a joyful feast ensued. As night fell, stories were shared around a dwindling fire, creating a magical atmosphere under the moonlit sky.|['1.

Lydia hesitated at first, but Melas urged her to seek guidance from the Gods. He believed the journey would be educational for their children. After a moment of silence, Lydia agreed, deciding to seek an omen. The family prayed to Hermes for guidance, and Lydia interpreted the omen as favorable. With excitement, she prepared food for their journey to Ambelaca. The next day, as they embarked on their trip, the children were thrilled, although Daphne was a bit uneasy sitting next to a basket of squirming eels on the boat to Piraeus.

"When they were all seated, the rowers took their places on the rowing-benches, the captain gave the signal, and off they went over the blue waters toward the distant shore. For a time everything went smoothly. There was no sound but the rattling of the oarlocks, the chant of the rowers as they dipped their oars, and the rippling of the water against the sides of the boat. Up to this time the black lamb had lain quietly in Melas' arms, but now something seemed to disturb him. He lifted his head, gave a sudden bleat, and somehow flung himself out of Melas' arms directly into the basket of eels! Such a squirming as there was then! The eels squirmed, and the lamb squirmed, and if his legs had not been securely tied together he undoubtedly would have flopped right into the water, and then this story would never have been written.""A portent on the farm of Pericles?"" cried the old woman. ""I'll warrant it will be read as favoring him, since he already has a world at his feet. May the Gods forgive me, but it seems to me they are often more partial than just.""The woman snapped her mouth shut. The farmers and the fisherman settled themselves as far away as possible from the Twins and Melas, and nothing more was said until the boat touched the other shore, and all the passengers scrambled out upon the dock"|['1.

Melas, with a serious tone, presented a one-horned ram from the farm to Telesippe for interpretation of the omen. While the slave disappeared, the porter returned to his post. Telesippe, worried about the portent, shifted focus to the basket brought by Dion and Daphne. As luncheon was unpacked, she assigned a slave to care for the food. The boys, curious about the ram and the farm, bombarded Melas with questions. Shortly after, a priest arrived, causing awe among the children who had never seen one before. Pericles, a noble figure, entered with another man, and the priest read the omens favorably for Pericles. Despite the prophecy, Pericles and Anaxagoras showed no reaction. Pericles rewarded Melas and the boys for bringing the ram, then left with Anaxagoras, leaving the others behind.|['1.

"Melas chuckled. ""You're just like the Athenians,"" he remarked. ""They call him the Olympian because they hold him in such high regard. Give me your coins,"" he continued. ""I'll keep them safe in my purse."" The day started early, and as they left Pericles' house, Melas and the Twins made their way to the Agora, the bustling heart of Athens. Stalls were filled with an array of goods - fruits, meats, fish, vegetables, flowers, pottery, garments, and even books on parchment scrolls. Marble columns supported arcades adorned with bronze statues. In the center stood an altar to the twelve Gods of Olympus. Temples and the Sacred Mount of the Acropolis loomed in the distance. Melas guided the Twins through the crowd, past fathers buying provisions, men in long cloaks conversing, and boys accompanied by their pedagogues. As they reached the Acropolis, a sacred procession for Goddess Athena began, led by prominent Athenians like Pericles, Anaxagoras, Phidias, and Sophocles. The Twins were mesmerized by the grandeur of the event and the esteemed figures surrounding them."|"['1.

In the bustling market, a man named Socrates, a friend of Pericles, stood discussing philosophy. Meanwhile, a grand procession unfolded, featuring a ship-shaped chariot carrying a magnificent embroidered robe, followed by girls and women bearing offerings. The festival included games and shows, captivating the children. As the day waned, they got lost in the spectacle, forgetting to meet their father. Eventually, realizing he was nowhere to be found, they searched in vain. Standing before the statue of Athena, the Gorgon's head seemed to come alive, prompting a mix of fear and curiosity in the children.|"['1.

They circled the ancient temple, partly in ruins, searching for their missing Father. Exhausted, hungry, and disheartened, they sat on the steps of the Maidens' Porch. Instead of marble columns, statues of beautiful maidens adorned the roof. Daphne gazed up at them in silence. As darkness fell, footsteps above startled them. Hidden below, they overheard the voices of Lampon the priest and another conspiring against Pericles. Lampon accused Pericles of neglecting sacred temples and building new ones in disrespect. The plotters planned to provoke Pericles and twist his words. A sneeze from Daphne alerted the plotters to their presence. Frozen in fear, they looked up to see two shadowy figures peering down at them from above.|"['1.

The frightened children, trembling before the priests, were being led into the temple's dark interior. Lampon, holding a torch, suggested sending them to Africa as slaves to prevent them from revealing temple secrets. The captives, Dion and Daphne, were ushered into a small, dimly lit room at the rear of the temple. As they cautiously explored the room, they stumbled upon a chest containing the priests' robes. Hushing each other, they pushed the chest under a window to peek outside. The moonlit Acropolis lay silent and deserted, except for the eerie hoot of an owl approaching. The children, half-hidden in the shadows, anxiously awaited their fate.|"['1.

"""They are wicked, anyway, to want to kill Pericles,"" said Daphne bravely. ""Maybe that's why we're here! Perhaps we could warn him about the priests if we could just escape. We're Spartans, we need to be strong and do our best.""Daphne boosted, and Dion climbed, reaching the window-sill. He helped Daphne out, and they crouched in the shadow, watching Lampon and the priest of the Erechthcum. The children waited until the coast was clear, then dashed down the incline, following the priests toward the street of the Amphorae.

Anaxagoras, a kind man from Piraeus, offered to take the children to Pericles' house in Athens. The children were amazed by the opulence of the richest house in Athens and the sight of men feasting with wreaths on their heads. Pericles, looking godly, thanked the children for their bravery in warning him of danger. He ensured they were well-fed and promised to help find their father. Anaxagoras arranged for the children to be taken to their uncle's house, where their father could be located.

Pericles was surprised by the bravery of the girl and vowed to protect her. He advised her to stay home more quietly in the future, as he believed women should not have a prominent role in history. The Twins, along with Anaxagoras and a slave, arrived at their uncle's house to find chaos and concern. Melas, their uncle, was reproached for letting Daphne roam freely. The family was relieved to be reunited, and the next morning, a basket from Pericles arrived for the brave children. The Twins were eager to return home to open it. Their aunt, impressed by their bravery and Pericles' favor, respected them more. Melas and the children were anxious to leave Athens and head back to Salamis to reunite with their mother.|"['1.

As twilight approached, three tired travelers ascended the final hill and veered off the road onto the path leading to the aged farmhouse. Lydia greeted them at the door, Chloe smiling from behind her. Argos, the dog, joyfully bounded out, wagging his tail and barking in delight. The evening was filled with happiness as they gathered around the warm hearth. Lydia had prepared a lavish feast with roast chicken, sausages, goat's milk, and figs. The travelers opened a basket by the fire, revealing gifts from Pericles. Each received a scarlet robe with golden clasps, a purse of gold coins, and two hand-written parchment books. Their parents also received gifts, along with a letter from Pericles. In the letter, Pericles commended the children to Euripides the Poet, emphasizing the importance of guiding them towards nobility and patriotism.
