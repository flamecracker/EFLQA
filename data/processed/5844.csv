Johnny and Peter believed the sweet singers by the Smiling Pool were birds. They searched for birds but heard the voices coming from the water. Johnny thought some birds could stay underwater, but he couldn't see any. Then, a sudden thought struck him: maybe the singers weren't birds at all!

One sunny morning, Johnny Chuck sat on his doorstep, observing Drummer the Woodpecker construct a new nest in the old apple tree. Drummer's crimson head darted back and forth, chiseling tiny wood pieces. It was slow and tough work, yet Drummer appeared content. This sight prompted Johnny Chuck to ponder his own abode.

Polly Chuck had to admit that the underground home Johnny Chuck was digging was safer than living out in the open. Johnny dug a long hall leading to a cozy bedroom deep underground. He then made a back hall and discreetly disposed of the sand. Eventually, he created a hidden back door behind a fallen stone wall. When Johnny was missed from his old home, some meadow animals were wary of Jimmy Skunk living there. However, when they learned Johnny had willingly given his home to Jimmy, they believed Jimmy. Despite Johnny's departure to explore, the meadow creatures were too busy to dwell on his absence. Peter Rabbit, who missed Johnny, planned to visit him once he settled in a new home. The Merry Little Breezes, keeping Johnny's location a secret, brought him news daily. One day, Sammy Jay discovered Johnny's new home, but Johnny remained vigilant to protect Polly Chuck's secrecy.|"['1.
