Norman, who had vanished an hour earlier, cautiously peeked out of his bedroom in pajamas. Mary, drowsy, advised him on the art of a graceful exit. She reflected on the monotony of Lone-Rock and prepared eagerly for departure, revitalizing her wardrobe and helping her family. Mary's boundless energy astounded her mother. The days before leaving were filled with anticipation, energizing those around her. Mary's optimism infected even the postmaster, who marveled at her cheerful demeanor. Mary awaited news of a job, likening it to a new play's curtain rising. She welcomed challenges as stepping-stones, not expecting an easy path but a chance to forge ahead. The Captain admired her determination, wishing she could stay in Lone-Rock.|"['1.

Mary noticed Pink Upham's admiration for her as he remembered her preferences and paid attention to her words. She appreciated the effort he put into making her feel special. Pink recalled details from their conversations, like her dislike for strong perfumes and her love for scarlet berries, showing his thoughtfulness. He even remembered a question she had about celluloid and made it his mission to find the answer. Pink's genuine interest in Mary was evident when he offered to take her horseback riding before breakfast, using his uncle's buckskins. Mary, who loved horseback riding, was touched by Pink's gesture and looked forward to exploring the mountains with him.

Mary expressed her gratitude to Pink with her usual excitement, feeling a rush of joy for two reasons. One was the delight of him organizing a special treat for her, and the other was his thoughtful attention to her passing comment. She mentioned she would confirm her availability after seeing her mother and preparing a suitable outfit for the outing. As Pink assisted others with their mail, he handed Mary her letters, including one with a foreign stamp. The Captain inquired about the stamp, expressing interest in it for his grandson's collection. Pink carefully removed the stamp for him, noticing the familiar handwriting on the envelope addressed to Mrs. Emily Ware, sparking a sense of recognition in him.|"['1.

Mary had shown Pink a picture signed by ""Philip Tremont."" Pink puzzled over why Mary called Phil ""The Best Man."" Mary, eager to read her letters, searched for a riding skirt in the loft with Jack. They found the skirt and a bag of wool for a Tam-O'-Shanter.

Norman, busy with a skein, warned, ""You can have him, but don't use your Uncle Jerry remarks on me for his sake, or I'll spill the beans."" Mary mimicked him, sparking a face-making contest. Two mornings later, in Joyce's riding gear, Mary rode off with Pink, her face glowing in the mountain air. Pink admired her straightforwardness, her interest in mountain life, and her knowledge. He felt awakened for the first time, realizing the differences in education and outlook between himself, Mary, Jack, and Norman. The breakfast at the Ware home highlighted the difference in their lives, with Mrs. Ware's refinement and culture setting them apart.

The Ware family gathered at the breakfast table each morning to start their day. Mrs. Ware's presence alone exuded hope and tranquility, setting a positive tone for the day. Pink, one of the family members, felt inspired by the subtle encouragement he received from Mrs. Ware. Despite not remembering her words, Pink felt a newfound sense of purpose and ambition. A small interaction with Mary, another family member, left Pink feeling uplifted. Later, in the quiet of the evening, Jack found Mary disheartened by a series of job rejection letters.

Jack's attempt to console Mary was met with bitterness as she expressed her disdain for cheerfulness calendars and the idea of pretending to be happy in the face of adversity. Mary was deeply upset by her disappointments and felt the need to make her own way in the world. Jack, in a kind and fatherly tone, offered Mary comfort, reminding her that she didn't need to face life's challenges alone. He assured her that he could provide a comfortable life for her and encouraged her to stay with the family.

Jack acknowledged that he understood the responsibility he had towards his little sister as the head of the family. Mary, looking puzzled, expressed her view that girls nowadays seek opportunities to pursue their ambitions independently. She mentioned Joyce's success and happiness achieved through her work. Jack questioned the practicality of Mary's ambitions and emphasized the importance of her presence at home. Mary, however, insisted on wanting to paddle her own canoe and make a place for herself where she felt needed. She expressed her desire to be a modern, independent woman like Miss Henrietta Robbins rather than a traditional spinster. Jack, after a moment of reflection, pondered if he could offer a fulfilling life for a potential partner in their isolated setting. Mary suggested that it would depend on the individual, citing examples of different girls' preferences for city life versus solitude.|"[""1.

Mary was deep in thought, considering a plan to write to Cousin Kate for help in securing a job. She felt inspired by the memory of Cousin Kate's generosity and influence. Jack, however, expressed his disapproval, believing that it wouldn't be right to ask for favors from someone who had already done so much for them. Despite Jack's reservations, Mary remained determined to reach out to Cousin Kate, emphasizing that she only sought her influence, not material things. She was willing to take full responsibility for the decision, even if it meant going against her mother's wishes and Jack's advice.

Mary hesitated, contemplating the news Jack had shared about Cousin Kate's involvement with the blind children. She decided to write to Cousin Kate to offer help with the children, knowing it would only cost a postage stamp. Choosing to write on scraps of paper instead of her monogram stationery, Mary carefully crafted a letter. As she imagined the impact of her words, Mary felt hopeful that her letter would yield a positive response.

Mrs. Ware paused, savoring the moment after her exciting announcement. Mary and Jack's reactions were joyful, but it was Norman's acrobatics that truly captured the occasion. He somersaulted across the room, landing near Mary who playfully tweaked his ear. The letter revealed plans for the family to move from New York to Paris, with a visit home first.

Mrs. Ware expressed her sadness at having to give him up completely. However, Mary reassured her that Holland would grow into a man and make them proud. Norman, munching on nuts, teased Mary about where she would fit in their family's pride. Playfully, they bantered back and forth, with Norman causing a mess but eventually cleaning up.

Mary found herself in a perplexing situation once more. The effort she had put into writing a letter was now in vain. Appealing to Cousin Kate seemed impossible, especially since she had already helped another family member and was away in the south of France due to the doctor's orders. Even if Mary had her address, she felt it would be inappropriate to burden her with a request that required any special favors. Hope that had soared earlier now plummeted. As bedtime approached, Mrs. Ware happily discussed Joyce's return, reigniting Mary's excitement. Despite her own struggles, she harbored no jealousy towards her sister's good fortune. Mary lay awake, pondering Norman's question about her own future. The letter she had discarded into the fire was a poignant symbol of her dashed hopes, understood by Jack in silence.|"[""1.

We were amazed when he walked in, and our joy was almost overwhelming. He had grown so much since you last saw him before your trip to Mexico. He was impressively dignified and incredibly polite, a true testament to the Navy's influence. It took me two days to feel comfortable enough to bring up the time he playfully dragged me down the hay-mow by my hair. The week has been wonderful, filled with nostalgia from our cherished Wigwam days. While there's nothing extraordinary to share in a letter, it felt like a slice out of the past. We reminisced, laughed, and enjoyed each other's company just like old times. Despite some uncertainties, we find comfort in each other's presence.

"The main character in the story is named Bonnie, inspired by the song ""Bonnie Eloise."" Joyce shared with Mary that Eugenia mentioned an American girl named Bonnie Eloise visiting the doctor's family near their construction camp. Eugenia described Bonnie as charming, playing the guitar, and singing duets. Mary wonders if Bonnie's real name is Eloise or if it's because she is as bonny as the girl in a book. Mary is curious if Bonnie sings as well as Lloyd Sherman. Mary eagerly awaits more details about Bonnie in the next letter.

Mary was still amazed by Phil's unusual request to be informed if anyone tried to persuade her to take a different path in life. He even wanted a say in choosing the right suitor, claiming no one was good enough for Mary. She imagined Phil's image of her in a pink and white dress, fresh and smiling, unlike the times he had seen her in disarray. Her thoughts wandered to Phil's laughter recalling her mishaps. As she baked, she realized her cookies burnt due to Phil's distracting letter. Her mother read the letter, while Mary made a new gingerbread man for little Don. Reflecting on Pink's kindness to Don, she wondered how Phil would perceive him. Later, Pink invited Mary to a Valentine party, revealing his feelings. Mary, realizing Pink's affection, felt conflicted as he fell short of her prince-like expectations.|"[""1.

Feeling embarrassed and troubled, she quickly moved away from him once they arrived at the gate. Inside the house, the lamps were lit, and supper was ready. Despite engaging in conversation at the table, her mind kept drifting back to Pink. She vividly remembered him standing at the gate in the snow under the moonlight. She knew he had watched her walk up the path into the house. As they chatted about various topics, the discussion turned to a snapshot of a girl named Eloise. Mary examined the picture closely, finding Eloise appealing and romantic. Reflecting on Phil's potential interest in Eloise, Mary realized she faced a similar situation with Pink.

Mary was preparing for the Valentine party, helping Jack with his comic Valentine costume. Pink suggested she dress as the Queen of Hearts, but she discovered he planned to be the King. Unwilling to pair their names, she chose to dress as an old-fashioned lace-paper valentine. The dress, made from a lace curtain, featured a panel of pale blue satin with two white doves above a red heart. Pink admired her costume but was strangely silent on the way home. He expressed a desire for a special name only she would use. Mary, trying to lighten the mood, joked about her nicknames. Pink, serious, sought a unique name for their private moments. As they walked through the snow, he revealed his wish for a special name between them, expressing his feelings under the moonlit winter night.|"['1.

Mary was walking home when Philip expressed his feelings, asking her to call him by his first name. Surprised, Mary had always thought his name was Peter. Feeling awkward, she pondered over the situation, worried about hurting Philip's feelings. Later, as Mary lay in bed, she contemplated the influence of an old shilling she had found. She realized that Pink, as Philip was known, didn't meet her prince-like expectations. Distressed by the thought of the shilling affecting her destiny, Mary wished she could leave Lone-Rock to escape the awkwardness.|"['1.

On her way to the post office the next morning, Mary decided that if she saw Pink there, she wouldn't show any sign of remembering their conversation from the night before. But when she spotted his familiar fur coat through the window, her face flushed with color. Inside, Pink's greeting made it clear he remembered everything, and the look in his eyes hinted at a special name he had for her. Curious, Mary wanted to know what it was. As they read a scrap of music together, Pink recognized it as a line from a song he associated with her. Mary then realized it was a clever reminder from Pink that she owed him a letter. Despite his sudden change in demeanor, Mary found his sensitivity puzzling and childish, deciding to head home after his unexpected departure.|"[""1.

"Mary pondered over the note from Phil, reflecting on the playful way he used music to communicate. She found Pink's reaction absurd and realized it was none of his concern. Inspired, she decided to respond to Phil's inquiry with a medley of song fragments. Whistling tunes on her way home, she jotted down a list of melodies from an old guitar book. Choosing the phrase ""Friend of my soul"" to start, she crafted a letter using song titles cleverly strung together.

Unaware of the significance of the moment, Mary sat rocking gently back and forth in the quiet that followed, lost in daydreams while observing the changing hues over the mountains.

In life, there are moments best left unread. Mary and the boys faced an indescribable sorrow. Mary found herself in her room, struggling to accept the truth of her mother's absence. Aunt Sally comforted her, but Mary felt lost in a world without her mother. She couldn't fathom life without her. Jack had to go to Plainsville alone, as Norman couldn't travel due to an injury. Mary, torn between grief and disbelief, tried to find solace in the idea of waking from a nightmare. As the night dragged on, she hoped for the dawn to bring normalcy. The sight of her mother's embroidery reminded her of their last moments together. Overwhelmed by grief, Mary wept until sleep brought temporary relief. The next morning, she awoke to a new reality, drenched in sorrow and uncertainty.|"[""1.

An overwhelming urge drew Mary towards her mother's room. Slowly opening the door, she gazed inside. The room appeared unchanged, except for the rosebuds blooming in the night. Her mother's white dress lay on a chair, imprinted with her essence. Standing by the bed, Mary saw her mother's peaceful smile and realized she had transcended. A comforting belief blossomed in Mary - her mother lived in a happier place, loving them just as before. Mary tenderly put away the white dress and embraced the idea that her mother was still close, bringing solace during the service and her brother's departure.

Mary decided to focus on the positive aspects of her mother's absence, seeing it as temporary until nightfall. She believed in taking each day as it comes, making the burden more bearable. She encouraged Norman to spend time outdoors with Billy instead of grieving at home, knowing her mother would have wanted that. Billy stayed to keep them company and help with chores while Jack was away. Mary found solace in her mother's words and a copy of Kemble's poem, _Absence_, which her mother had treasured. The poem spoke of dedicating each moment to loved ones when apart. Mary resolved to honor her mother's memory by starting a cooking class for Mexican girls, a plan they had discussed. Norman and Billy also began teaching carpentry to Mexican boys, thanks to Pink's suggestion. Mary found comfort in these activities during a difficult time.|"[""1.

"In the absence of their mother, the children found solace in cooking and carpentry lessons, keeping her memory alive by asking, ""would mamma want us to do it?"" Time gradually healed their wounds, and life continued its daily rhythm. Meanwhile, in Lloydsboro Valley, spring arrived early, painting the landscape with vibrant colors. As Lloyd returned home, her grandfather, Colonel Lloyd, greeted her warmly. Playfully, she teased him about his white attire, linking it to the recent wedding.

"""Twelve years, Grandfather,"" said Lloyd, after a pause, as she counted backward. ""She's been just like a real sister to me, and I feel worse than you do about giving her up. Lone-Rock does have a dreadfully dismal forsaken sort of sound. But I can overlook that for Jack Ware's sake. He's such a splendid fellow.""

The Colonel agreed but changed the subject, expressing annoyance at the upcoming flurry of preparations for the wedding. Lloyd assured him that Betty's wedding would be different, with only a handful of guests and no fuss. As they reached the house, the Colonel left for his walk, and Lloyd settled in for the day. She found her room as she had left it, with fresh flowers from Mom Beck. Lloyd quickly made a list for the upcoming event and was called upstairs by Betty to the attic.

"As Betty sat by the old trunk, carefully packing away her childhood treasures, Lloyd noticed how much she resembled her younger self from the days at The Locusts.

Betty showed her a white sunbonnet and an old willow basket, triggering memories of their first meeting. Among the items scattered on the rug were a newspaper from Lloyd's first house-party and a poem Betty had published at twelve.

I wasn't homesick or lonesome at all, but I felt this strange sensation of being adrift, like the man who wrote the hymn about standing between two vast seas. The past is one sea, and the future is another, and there I stood, a mere scrap of humanity, a stranger in a new city, wondering what each day would bring. Suddenly, I grew cold and wished I was back in my own room at Lone-Rock. Opening the shutters, I saw a wide river with a young moon casting a silvery glow.

Mary, after a quick look at the sleeping girl, felt a chill and hurried back upstairs. Despite her initial hesitation, she steeled herself for the questions Sandford Berry would ask.

Phil impatiently hung up the phone. He had traveled from Mexico, not to hear a speech on housing reform, but to find Mary before dark. Imagining her surprise if she spotted him in the audience made him chuckle. He guessed she'd sit near the front, making her easy to spot. Phil didn't want to risk sitting next to her suddenly. Instead, he planned to send an usher with a note asking her to meet him at the entrance. Then, Mary could decide where they'd spend the rest of the afternoon. Despite the chilly, gray November day, they needed a place for an uninterrupted talk. As Phil lamented the timing, Mary was approached by neighbors seeking help for Dena Barowsky, who had a bad fall at home.|"[""1.

With a shudder, Mary turned away and requested to be taken to Dena's room. Upon opening the door, a strong smell of anæsthetics mixed with the musty odor of the unventilated apartment greeted her. The inquisitive neighbors, despite the doctor's attempts to keep them out, lingered in the corners, observing the pale girl on the bed who was moaning in unconsciousness. This wasn't the first time Mary had encountered the young doctor in such situations. He seemed relieved by her arrival and explained the severity of the injuries in medical jargon to prevent the distraught father from understanding. Mary left, grateful for the Organized Charities that provided assistance and recalling Mr. Stoner's contribution that enabled them to hire an extra nurse. Mrs. Donegan stopped her with a newspaper highlighting a past tragedy related to the building's staircase, urging Mary to share it with Mrs. Blythe for an upcoming speech. Mary, determined and grim, left the grocery to report that help was on the way for Dena.|"[""1.

Mary was furious as she vented her anger about Mr. Stoner to Mrs. Blythe. She was indignant that Mr. Stoner neglected the dangerous condition of the stairs that led to accidents.

When she peered out again, among the palm trees, she could spot individual faces in the large crowd. Judge Brown, Senator Ripley, and Doctor Haverhill were all there. And at the front, by the reporters' table, was Orphant Annie. She couldn't help but grin, anticipating his reaction when he saw her taking Mrs. Blythe's place.

Showing other girls that they don't need to be like nuns to help is a powerful way to contribute. You can maintain your normal life while making a difference through social influence. Having a home, social standing, and being a happy wife and mother can enhance your ability to advocate for those in need.

The library door was open, and the firelight glowed warmly, casting shadows in the twilight. It reminded her of a special night three months ago when she first met Phil. The room held memories that felt sacred. She wished Electa, the seamstress, hadn't been waiting there. It pained her to relive those moments. As she entered, she saw a man by the fire, not the seamstress. It was Phil, eagerly awaiting her. When Phil received Mary's letter about her land, he was torn between a partnership offer in Louisville and a position in the West. Ultimately, Mary's happiness swayed him towards Kentucky. Phil knew Mary's steadfast nature well and was determined not to let her go. He admired her selflessness and unwavering dedication to her beliefs.|"['1.

When I first arrived at the vast church, I had anticipated it feeling empty and lonely without familiar faces in the pews. However, as I walked down the aisle, the magnificent organ music filled the space, reaching the vaulted ceiling. Despite teasing from Phil about my choice of attire for the occasion, he later admitted he was glad I wore white with a delicate tulle veil. His kind words about my appearance were as sweet as the rose petals scattered on my wedding gown. Phil's sentimental side was further revealed when he gifted me a beautifully carved chest with my name engraved on it. As we boarded the train to Lloydsboro Valley, Kentucky, I realized his grand surprise was that he had purchased a home there for us, called Green Acres. The charm of the house and its gardens exceeded my expectations, and I am just beginning to uncover all its delights after two months.|"['1.

The Wyckliffes cherished Green Acres for three generations, creating a cozy and charming place. The hillside behind the house boasts a small orchard and vineyard, with a brook flowing nearby adorned with watercress and forget-me-nots. The apple trees bloom beautifully, adding to the serene atmosphere. The house was prepared with care, even a horse named Silver-wings was a surprise gift. The barn revealed this wonderful creature, a bay saddle horse, a thoughtful present from Father Tremont. The house-warming was a delightful event, with friends and family joining in to celebrate the new beginning.

In the past two months, I have enjoyed delightful rides with my friend Lloyd and spent wonderful days with her and Gay in the Valley. Being close to my dear Princess Winsome brings me constant joy. I have learned that the warmth of happy home windows guides lost travelers and that social influence is crucial in our work. As the Mistress of Green Acres, I aim to achieve more than before, thanks to Phil's support. Recently, I hosted a dinner with influential guests where we discussed Housing Reform. We gathered in my 'Place of the Tryst,' a room adorned with impactful photographs of tenements. Inspired by Mrs. Blythe's torch, we initiated a movement to address housing issues in Kentucky. With everyone's support, including Lloyd and Miss Allison, progress has begun.|"['1.
