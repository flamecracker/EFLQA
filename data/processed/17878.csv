At last, the preparations were complete for the first scene of the play, set in a meadow. The stage was all set up with the scenery, lights, and curtains. In the audience area sat the mothers, big sisters, and a few fathers of the children participating. They hoped for a big crowd on Christmas afternoon for the actual performance. The rehearsal mirrored the real play, starting with the meadow scene and moving on to the barnyard. Everything went well until Peter, the bantam rooster, couldn't stop crowing during a sad song.

"As the Christmas Eve festivities wound down, Bunny Brown and his sister Sue prepared for bed. They joyfully hung up their stockings for Santa Claus before settling in. Mr. Brown took care of the little rooster, making sure it was safe in the chicken house. Everyone in the house soon went to sleep, anticipating the excitement of Christmas morning.

The next day, after a light breakfast, Sue watched the snowfall nervously, hoping it wouldn't deter people from attending their show. Bunny and Sue were so eager about their upcoming performance that they couldn't eat much at Christmas dinner. They quickly made their way to the hall, where they met with other children, including Will Laydon with his trained white mice and other animal performers.

The scene was beautifully decorated, and as Lucile began to sing, the room fell silent in anticipation.

In the play, George tried to get his rooster, Peter, to do a trick in the barnyard scene. George stood by the barn door with a piece of bread, hoping Peter would perch on his head and eat the crumbs. However, Peter only perched on the pony's back and refused to fly onto George's head. The second act ended without the trick. The third act took place in an orchard during apple-blossom time. Sue pretended to be lost, and Bunny searched for her. When Sue climbed an artificial apple tree to hide, Bunny pretended to look for her, making everyone laugh. The play continued with the mice performing tricks, and Peter finally flew onto George's head during a song.
