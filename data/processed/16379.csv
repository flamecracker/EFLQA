This book series has three main goals: to spark interest in oral reading, to enhance expressive voice, and to promote freedom and grace in physical movements while reading and speaking. The stories are adaptations of well-loved folklore tales from authors like Andersen, Grimm, Æsop, and the Arabian Nights. Children are naturally dramatic and imaginative, embodying characters with abandon and joy. By tapping into this expressive instinct, we can improve reading quality and enjoyment. These stories encourage children to immerse themselves in characters, enhancing their oral reading skills. The books allow for a range of expression, from reading effectively to acting out scenes with minimal or elaborate staging. Teachers can assign roles to students, allowing them to perform stories informally. This method not only aids in English training but also fosters creativity and engagement.|"['1.
