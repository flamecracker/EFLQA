In the early days of seafaring, sailors from New England showed promise in creating a merchant marine that would boast the fastest ships and most skilled sailors. These vessels were efficient, with smaller crews than Dutch or English ships, venturing wherever trade called to earn profits. By the late 17th century, New England had over a thousand registered vessels, with Salem emerging as a prominent port. Philip English, a leading shipping merchant, amassed a fleet that traded along the coast and overseas. The slave trade also thrived, with ships from Rhode Island and other ports engaging in the despicable Middle Passage. This era of commerce, marred by slavery and piracy, eventually led to a civil war, leaving a lasting unresolved issue.

During the 17th century, the sea was a treacherous place with many tales of pirates and their exploits. One such pirate was Ned Low, who stole from poor fishermen but also showed a softer side by weeping for his child in Boston. In contrast, Thomas Pounds put up a brave fight when captured, refusing to surrender even when the odds were against him. John Quelch raised a unique flag and led a mutiny, only to meet his end on the gallows. Governor Fletcher of New York turned a blind eye to piracy, leading to the appointment of Lord Bellomont to clean up the mess. Captain William Kidd, wrongly accused of piracy, met a tragic end for a crime he likely didn't commit. Blackbeard, a flamboyant pirate, terrorized the Atlantic coast until his defeat by Lieutenant Maynard. Finally, Sir William Phips, a former ship-carpenter turned treasure hunter, became the first royal Governor of Massachusetts.|['1.

In the 17th century, Captain Phips set out to find a sunken galleon off the coast of Hispaniola. Lacking funds, he sought help from England's King James II. After a year of persistence, he secured a royal frigate. Although he didn't find silver on his first try, he convinced others to back him. Setting sail on the James and Mary, he discovered the galleon with treasures of gold, pearls, and jewels. Returning to England with £300,000 in treasure, he was knighted. Back in Boston, his rough exterior belied his honest and brave nature. Despite becoming Governor, Phips maintained his seafaring manners.

Captain Derby from Gibraltar reported a fierce encounter with a latineer off Algeciras Point. Despite inflicting damage, he chose not to capture the enemy ship due to the risk of assistance from Algeciras Point. The spirit of exploration spread to New York after the Revolution. The ship Empress of China embarked on a historic voyage to Canton in 1784, introducing Americans to the vast Chinese nation. Captain Stewart Dean furthered this exploration by venturing into the China trade on a small sloop, the Experiment. Dean's courage and success in this venture paved the way for American trade with the Far East. Boston merchants also seized the opportunity, notably the Russell, Perkins, and Forbes families. The Massachusetts, launched in 1789, marked a significant milestone in American maritime history, although superstitions and crew issues initially plagued the voyage.|"['1.

The ship, crafted by skilled artisans in New England, faced a tragic fate upon reaching Canton. Despite the masterful construction, her timbers were found decaying due to a critical error of using unseasoned white oak. The cargo stored improperly, along with the foul air from decay, spoiled hundreds of barrels of beef. Captain Randall and Samuel Shaw had to sell the ship to the Danish East India Company at a loss. The crew dispersed, meeting unfortunate ends as noted by Captain Amasa Delano years later. Their fates ranged from slavery in Algiers to murder by the Chinese, drowning, smallpox, and leprosy.

In the past, there were many tragic incidents that befell a group of sailors on the Massachusetts ship. Only a few survived after a dozen years, with most succumbing to violence. However, Captain Delano's fate was different. He navigated through the dangers of that era unscathed. After the Massachusetts was sold, he used his skills to rebuild a Danish ship wrecked by a storm, impressing the owners. Delano then joined an English Navy expedition to explore the South Seas. Despite initial hostilities between British and American sailors, Delano's resourcefulness earned him a place as a lieutenant in the Bombay Marine. His adventures included encounters with islanders and even a daring skirmish with canoes in New Guinea.

This pivotal exploration paved the way for other adventurers like Richard Cleveland and Amasa Delano. Amasa Delano, along with his brothers, embarked on perilous sealing expeditions, enduring dangers to gather skins for trade. The Delano brothers' maritime skills were crucial as they navigated the globe, facing storms and uncertainties. The American merchant marine thrived post-Revolution, with Congress enacting legislation to protect and promote it. Retaliatory measures against England's navigation laws boosted American trade, ensuring fair competition.

In the late 1700s, American merchant ships faced challenges due to war between England and France. When England refused to consider American ships trading with French colonies as neutral, chaos ensued. British cruisers seized American vessels and mistreated their crews. The situation worsened as ships were lost, crews were stranded, and American sailors were imprisoned. The tension escalated, leading to fears of a second war with England. To avoid conflict, President Washington recommended a special mission to England, resulting in the Jay Treaty of 1794. Although met with public outrage, the treaty allowed American trade to prosper temporarily. However, conflicts with France persisted, with French privateers posing threats to American ships.

The war clouds had passed, and New England's wharves bustled with merchant ships. New York emerged as a thriving seaport, its skyline adorned with towering bowsprits and a forest of ship masts along the East River. By 1790, over two thousand vessels had entered and cleared the harbor, with sailors earning triple the wages of land laborers. Shipbuilding flourished, producing East Indiamen rivaling those of Boston and Salem. Philadelphia boasted Stephen Girard, a former cabin-boy who amassed a fortune through maritime ventures. Girard's fleet, named after philosophers, dominated trade routes to China and India. Despite challenges from British privateers, Girard's strategic acumen secured his wealth.

A proud and independent people like those in New England could not tolerate defense measures that felt like surrender to brute force. The embargo hit New England hard, leading to rebellion. Sailors in the streets demanded supplies or sailed out to sea, facing challenges. New York's waterside was deserted, with commerce dropping significantly. Congress later replaced the law with a Non-Intercourse Act, but it failed to resolve the issues. American ships were lured into traps by Napoleon, resulting in significant losses. Despite challenges, the American merchant marine thrived. The War of 1812 saw merchant seamen actively fighting against British provocations like impressment. The conflict over British searches for English seamen in neutral vessels led to tensions between the US and Britain.

I received a message one morning from my chief mate that one of my sailors, Edward Hulen, a fellow townsman I had known since childhood, had been taken aboard a British frigate under distressing circumstances. I quickly gathered all the details and went to the frigate to find Hulen. The first lieutenant informed me that he was taken under orders to recruit seamen from American ships. Despite my efforts to secure his release, I had to surrender to the insult to my country's flag. Being impressed into service meant years of detention with no contact with loved ones or wages. Ships in the British fleet had men unpaid for years, enduring harsh conditions and brutal punishments. The oppressive system of impressment was resented in England as much as in the United States.

In the early 1800s, American privateers, like those from Baltimore, were known for their daring and skilled seamanship. These Yankee ships were recognized by their tall masts and white canvas sails. They outmaneuvered English ships in strong winds, capturing over thirteen hundred prizes across the Seven Seas during the War of 1812. Baltimore's fleet of fast ships and schooners, such as the Chasseur, proved formidable. Captain Thomas Boyle of the Chasseur even boldly proclaimed a blockade of the United Kingdom. Despite facing larger British vessels, these American privateers, like the Prince de Neuchatel and the General Armstrong, displayed courage and cunning in their encounters. Their actions significantly impacted British trade and naval operations, earning them both admiration and condemnation.|"['1.

"During the era of sailing ships, American seamen aboard the Atlantic packets were a mix of nationalities, including English, Irish, and Scandinavians. While the ships were manned by skilled American officers inspired by maritime traditions, American lads tended to avoid these vessels. The best American sailors sought careers at sea between the Revolution and the War of 1812. However, as time passed, American ships saw fewer American sailors on board, except for those in leadership roles. Yankee crews were prevalent in ports where old customs thrived, offering opportunities for profit and advancement. The Salem ship George, owned by Joseph Peabody, served as a nautical training school for young seamen, many of whom went on to become shipmasters. The Atlantic packets, however, had a different atmosphere, with crews known as ""Liverpool packet rats"" enduring harsh conditions and brutal discipline."|['1.

The long-standing tradition in maritime service of treating sailors poorly persisted into the twentieth century, even as American ships dominated the seas. Despite the success of American ships in the North Atlantic trade, the introduction of steamships marked the decline of the nation's maritime power. The advent of steamships, like those of the Cunard line, signaled the end of the era of majestic packet ships. The Collins line, an attempt to rival the Cunarders, was short-lived due to tragic losses and lack of government support. Ultimately, American ships lost their dominance to the British steamship companies, marking a significant shift in maritime power.

The American merchant marine faced a decline accelerated by the Civil War due to the reluctance of American shipowners to adopt new technologies. While American shipowners clung to traditional wooden ships, their British counterparts embraced iron steamers with screw propellers. The shift marked the end of the golden age of American merchant ships, characterized by beautiful square-rigged vessels. The introduction of steamers brought reliability and speed, outperforming the traditional sailing vessels. The evolution from swift privateers during the War of 1812 led to the development of the American clipper ship, focusing on speed rather than cargo capacity.

In 1848, San Francisco was a quiet Mexican trading-post with adobe huts and sheds. American ships stopped for hides, and whalers came for wood and water. But in the year before the Gold Rush, only two merchant ships entered through the Golden Gate. After that, 775 ships left Atlantic ports for San Francisco, with nearly fifty thousand passengers hunting for gold. Crews abandoned their ships, using them as hotels, hospitals, or left them to rot. Sailors refused high pay to sign again, mocking the idea. The Gold Rush led to a high demand for transportation. Clippers costing $70,000 could pay for themselves in one trip, with freights at $60 a ton. This led to the era of California clippers, with 160 launched from 1850 to 1854. These ships were larger, presenting new challenges in spars and rigging. The Flying Cloud, built by Donald McKay, set a record sailing from New York to San Francisco in eighty-nine days.|['1.

Clipper ships had crews made up of men from various countries. The forecastle typically had a mix of Americans, English, Norwegians, Portuguese, and Italians. The Liverpool packet rats were known for being tough and hard to handle, drawn to the clippers by the lure of the gold rush. Due to a shortage of experienced sailors, crimps would recruit men, even those unfit for the job. The mates struggled to whip the crew into shape for the long voyages. Some officers were harsh, resorting to abuse to maintain order. Captain Bob Waterman faced a mob in San Francisco due to mistreatment allegations. Despite the challenges, the clipper ships were skillfully navigated to their destinations. The discipline on these ships was efficient but often cruel. Legislation was eventually put in place to protect sailors. Clipper ship construction declined after 1854, with medium clippers continuing to be profitable for years.

The impact of the financial crisis of 1857 and the resulting business downturn severely affected American ships. Freight rates dropped so low that there was no profit to be made, leading even the best clippers to struggle to find work. Shipyards stopped building new ships as British shipbuilders surpassed American designs, diminishing Yankee dominance in the China trade. American ships lay idle in ports like Manila Bay, Shanghai, Hong-Kong, and Calcutta. The decline in global commerce, coupled with an oversupply of ships, paralyzed the industry. While the American spirit had historically shown resilience in the face of adversity, the maritime industry struggled to recover from the blows of the panic of 1857 and the Civil War. The younger generation now turned away from the sea, focusing instead on conquering the vast inland territories, shifting away from the maritime heritage that once defined the nation.|['1.

During the peak of Yankee whaling in 1857, the New Bedford fleet alone had 329 ships, with a total of 426 vessels from various ports. The catch that year was valued at over ten million dollars. Sailors were paid based on shares of the profits, leading to either great wealth or empty pockets. Captain W.T. Walker bought an old ship for a bargain and made a huge profit. The ship Sarah brought back barrels of oil worth $89,000, while the William Hamilton set a record with barrels valued at $109,269. Despite the dangers and low pay, sailors persisted due to their love for the sea and the thrill of the trade. The decline of whaling was due to dwindling whale populations and changing economic interests. The legacy of these brave sailors lives on in the history of the United States.|['1.

In the early 18th century, the first New England schooners set sail for the Grand Bank of Newfoundland in search of cod and halibut. These vessels, manned by incredibly resilient fishermen, were small but brave. Marblehead was a leading fishing port, while Gloucester sent out the first schooner to the Grand Bank. Seamen from these ports later joined privateers and the Continental navy, fighting both at sea and on land during the Revolutionary War. Despite losses and hardships, the fishing industry thrived again. Fishermen from these regions were known for their sobriety, skill, and strong community bonds. Fishing and coastal trade were intertwined, with schooners transporting goods between ports. The sailors' experiences on these vessels often led them to pursue careers as officers in the merchant marine. While seafaring has evolved, traditional sailing vessels like the Gloucester fishing schooners remain in use, carrying on the legacy of their forefathers.|['1.

The tale of the brave sailors who navigated the treacherous waters of the coast is intertwined with the evolution of the schooner. Originally small, these vessels grew in size and power. The three-masted schooner became a popular choice due to its ease of handling. With the introduction of steam engines to assist with sails, larger schooners emerged, like the four-masted ones that could carry thousands of tons of cargo. These ships revolutionized maritime trade, requiring only a fraction of the crew needed for square-rigged ships. The skilled captains of these vessels faced immense challenges, especially in stormy weather, where quick decisions were crucial to avoid disaster. These schooners were a marvel of efficient and cost-effective transportation, a testament to the ingenuity and courage of the sailors who sailed them.|['1.

American shipmasters of the old breed, raised in schooners, adapted to modern conditions, sailing for nominal wages and primage. Before the Great War, freights were low, but a world tonnage shortage raised coastwise freights. Schooners like those in the Palmer fleet earned substantial incomes. These captains owned shares in their vessels, earning around a thousand dollars a month. The foreign war trade beckoned, but submarine attacks led them back to coastwise routes or South American ports. These schooners were a challenge to the Age of Steam, the last stand of the old American maritime spirit. While steam colliers won the battle due to time value, these schooners, reminiscent of simpler times, continue to ply the coast, enjoying a resurgence in demand. The ship-chandler's shops serve as an informal club for these skippers, where tales of the sea and old voyages are shared, rejuvenating the old energy among them.|"[""1.
