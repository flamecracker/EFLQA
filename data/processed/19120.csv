Let's finish our tasks, send a message through Billy without revealing our plans, and then gather supplies for our upcoming journey. Once done, we can leave town leisurely towards the mountain. I want Peg to reach there first to prevent any claims of stealing his idea. Thirty minutes later, the saddle boys completed their errands and dispatched a message to Mr. Haywood through the Circle ranch cowboy. They strolled down the main street to buy blankets, cooking gear, bacon, and coffee when they heard a cry. They saw a Mexican girl in distress, being harassed by a larger man.

Peg watched as the other person quickly got defensive. Peg didn't like how strong his opponent looked, despite Bob being slender. Bob seemed like he could handle himself. Peg, nursing his injured eye, decided to delay the fight. He warned them that they would pay for this later. Bob, unfazed, laughed it off, dismissing Peg's threats. Bob believed that those who boast are often cowards and that Peg would seek revenge. The two friends discussed the potential trouble they might face if they encountered Peg and his tough companions on Thunder Mountain.

As the two friends rode off on their splendid horses, a small girl cautiously emerged from behind some boxes and dashed out of sight. The men's horses caught the envy of passersby, but stealing them in broad daylight was too risky. Frank, experienced in the wild, guided his friend in selecting essential items like blankets, a frying pan, and cutlery for their journey. As Frank efficiently packed supplies, Bob observed eagerly, eager to learn the ways of frontier life. Unbeknownst to them, a mysterious figure lurked near the horses, particularly drawn to the magnificent black steed. Despite the figure's interest, it eventually moved on, leaving the horses undisturbed. Bob, sensing Domino's unease, quickly mounted, puzzled by the horse's restless behavior.|"['1.

As soon as Bob mounted the horse, it let out a loud neigh and bolted like a wild animal. Even an experienced rider would have struggled with such a sudden and unexpected move, which Domino had never attempted before. Frank, observing in amazement, realized that Domino's behavior was out of fear, not Bob's control. The powerful horse behaved erratically, jumping and spinning wildly, attracting the attention of everyone around. Despite Frank's attempt to chase after Bob, the horse ran off uncontrollably. Bob, trying to calm Domino with gentle words, suspected foul play. He speculated that someone might have placed something harmful under the saddle, causing the horse's distress. As Bob investigated, he felt a foreign object under the saddle, confirming his suspicions. Determined to resolve the situation, Bob faced the challenge of removing the dangerous item while dealing with the runaway horse's erratic movements.|"[""1.

Bob's immediate reaction was to relieve the pressure he believed was caused by a hidden thorn. Mimicking a skilled jockey, he shifted his weight to ease the horse's discomfort. Responding well, the horse slowed until fully stopping at Bob's command. Bob dismounted and comforted the trembling horse, finding a thorn under the saddle. Recognizing foul play, he suspected poison and wished to confront the culprit. Removing the thorn, Bob adjusted the saddle to prevent further pain. Meeting Frank, Bob explained the sabotage by a cowboy named Spanish Joe. Understanding the situation, Frank commended Bob's handling of the situation with the horse.|"[""1.

Looking back, it was Bob Archer who caused Peg to stumble when he was chasing that child. Peg seemed delighted, grinning from ear to ear as Bob rode off like the wind. Bob shared how his horse, Domino, stood still even after he dismounted, showing understanding and patience. Frank had ointment from Hank Coombs to treat a thorn wound on Domino. They decided to rest for 24 hours before continuing their journey to Thunder Mountain. While riding, they noticed a rider approaching, who turned out to be Hank from the Circle Ranch, a trusted figure.

Hank Coombs, a seasoned cowman, possessed keen eyesight that rivaled an eagle's. Despite his age, he remained agile and skillful in his cowboy duties. Hank warned Frank and his friend about the dangers ahead, particularly Thunder Mountain, a treacherous area frequented by cattle rustlers and sometimes unruly Native American tribes. Frank, however, was undeterred and revealed his encounter with suspicious characters linked to the rustlers. Hank, alarmed by the news, expressed concern about the mysterious noises heard in the region, believed by some to be the voice of the Great Spirit.

Hank asked Frank if he believed the mountain was haunted, cautioning about the dangers lurking in the unknown country. Frank disagreed, suspecting that rustlers might be using Thunder Mountain as a hideout. Frank planned to investigate and search for missing cattle. Hank realized the clever tactic of using the mountain's bad reputation to conceal illicit activities. When Frank's horse, Domino, bolted unexpectedly due to a thorn, Hank recognized the deceitful ploy. Frank assured Hank that he had treated the wound and would reapply ointment later.

Bob and Frank from Circle Ranch were on a picnic, avoiding trouble with a group of people in the distance. As they rode their horses, Bob noticed Thunder Mountain towering above the peaks.

Frank and Bob discussed the mysterious Thunder Mountain. The Navajos believed it was unlucky to be near the mountain after dark, especially when Manitou scolds.

The boys were prepared for action as they swiftly moved towards their staked-out animals. They calmed their restless horses with a few words and covered them with blankets to conceal their presence. The trained ponies, Buckskin and Domino, played dead on command to avoid detection. As the distant sounds of approaching horses grew louder, the boys huddled low to observe. They noticed a group of riders without saddles, possibly cattle rustlers, heading towards Thunder Mountain. Speculating on the situation, they suspected the rustlers might have a hideout in the canyons nearby.

When venturing in the mountains, it's crucial to always be prepared. Unexpected encounters with wildlife, such as grizzly bears or hungry panthers, can happen at any time. Bob recalled the story of Ike Lasker, who was attacked by a panther while lying down and waiting for deer. Despite being severely injured, Ike managed to defend himself with his knife until help arrived. As they rested in the shade by a stream, Frank and Bob discussed the possibility of exploring caves in the mountain. The weather began to change, hinting at a potential rainstorm. While they hadn't seen Peg Grant and his guides, they knew the others were nearby, likely waiting for nightfall to continue their exploration. It's important to stay alert and prepared for any challenges that may arise in the mountains, especially during unpredictable weather.|['1.

Frank and Bob were in a canyon, surrounded by mysteries and potential dangers. They were cautious, aware that someone might drop rocks on them. Frank suspected Peg, an angry person, or rustlers nearby. The boys were also curious about prospectors in the area and the strange rumblings from Thunder Mountain. As the darkness grew, they noticed a light on the mountain. Despite their fear, they considered investigating. The suspense of the situation intrigued them, and they debated whether to climb up and explore further. The unknown perils and mysteries of the canyon kept them on edge, wondering what secrets Thunder Mountain held.|['1.

"""There you've got me,"" laughed the other. ""I'm not so far along as that yet. P'raps it might be one of the rustlers, telling something to another of the same stripe, who is located in camp out yonder on the plain. Then, again, how do we know but what it might be that Peg Grant lot? And Lopez. Don't forget little Lopez, Frank. Prospectors could have a lantern; in fact, I understand they often do carry such a thing along with 'em when they go into the mountains to pan for dust in the creek beds.""

They stood there for some little time, looking up at the light. Bob was merely indulging in various speculations regarding its source. On the other hand Frank busied himself in locating the strange glow, so that he might be able to know when he reached the spot, in case it was invisible at the time they arrived.

""If you're ready, we'll start right away,"" he said, quietly. ""Luckily I've been studying the face of Thunder Mountain at times during the afternoon, and I reckon I can pilot the expedition all right.""

But when Frank said this so confidently he failed to consider the intense darkness that might baffle all his plans of campaign. Still, Bob had the utmost confidence in his chum's ability to pull out of any ordinary difficulty. And, since his Kentucky spirit had been fully aroused, he was ready to accompany Frank anywhere, at any time.

"Alright then. You know what I mean—and since we're up here, we might as well decide to hunt for an overhanging ledge and rest. But hey, why are you sniffing in that direction, Frank?"" ""Lots of times, and used it too, disinfecting,"" replied Bob. ""Spent months with my uncle, a doctor in Cincinnati, during an epidemic, cleaning rookeries to stamp out disease. But this wasn't a sulfur smell I caught, Frank."" ""Didn't find anything; but I tripped over a creek and almost fell downhill. Just in time, I grabbed a tree. Phew!

Both boys proceeded cautiously. Bob, new to Western ways, grasped the importance of stealth when nearing a potentially occupied camp. Frank, with experience from ranger Hank Coombs, urged quietness. Moving through darkness and rough terrain silently was challenging. Bob crawled to avoid noise, guided by Frank, considerate of his inexperience. Sniffing, they detected a trail, drawing closer to the source of smoke. Bob, absorbed in thoughts, pondered the progress of Peg and his guides up Thunder Mountain. As they approached, whispers and voices grew louder. Bob, adapting to the stealthy crawl, located the voices and a faint spark. Wondering about Frank's plan, he hesitated to risk getting closer. Nick and Peg's conversation hinted at a discovery, emphasizing the difficulty of navigating the rocky terrain in darkness.|"['1.

"""Spanish Joe's fate was too easy,"" Nick said casually. ""He was born for the rope, and fate caught up with him. Some say the same about me. Doesn't bother me, though. It's almost comforting, especially when a landslide sweeps you down a mountain like a train, as it did to me. Nothing can harm you if your end is destined by the rope.""

""Landslides happen often around here?"" Peg asked nervously, recalling stories he had read about such disasters.

""Sure do, every so often,"" Nick replied cheerfully. ""Just last year, a peak forty miles north broke away, wiping out an Indian village. Not a sound from anyone after that.""

""Could it happen here on Thunder Mountain?"" Peg inquired, his interest piqued.

Nick seemed to be trying to scare Peg for some reason, perhaps to persuade him to leave the mountain with a bad reputation. And it was working, as Peg grew increasingly uneasy."|"[""1.

The guide disagreed with the boy's determination to investigate the roaring noises on Thunder Mountain. Peg changed plans, prioritizing safety over proving a point to his rivals.

The worried cowboy and his companions, Frank and Nick, found themselves in a precarious situation atop a mountain. The cowboy's superstitious nature added to the tension. Nick, although smart, was not keen on risking a dangerous descent in the dark. Suddenly, a deafening roar shook the mountain, causing fear among the group. Peg, usually confident, now expressed deep concern about their safety. Nick and Peg discussed possible escape routes, with Nick suggesting searching for a cave for shelter. However, Peg's realization that the noise was coming from the mountain itself led to the alarming thought that it might be a volcano on the verge of erupting.

"Frank realized that his initial assumption was likely correct. Spanish Joe had somehow gotten his foot stuck in a crack while navigating the rocks and was unable to free it. The more he struggled, the more firmly it seemed to be trapped. Given the circumstances, it was understandable that he was frightened. 

""It's my leg, Nick,"" Spanish Joe cried out anxiously. ""I can't loosen it, and I've twisted and pulled so much that it feels like it's almost dislocated. See if you can help. Every time I move, that rock up there looks like it's about to fall on me! If it does, I'll be crushed.""

Frank was familiar with Spanish Joe, who had worked on the Circle Ranch until being dismissed for suspected involvement with cattle rustlers. Despite losing some of his national traits from working on American ranches, Spanish Joe still retained some characteristic dress. 

Frank wasted no time. He was concerned about the precarious rock overhead. It appeared ready to collapse, posing a grave threat to anyone beneath it due to its immense weight. 

Spanish Joe followed Frank's instructions eagerly. Despite the pain in his leg, he was determined, knowing that failure would likely result in a dire outcome.

Frank had reached the edge of a drop, recalling skirting it moments earlier. Bob, less experienced, struggled. Using a match, Frank saw Bob clinging to rocks nearby.

"Two more signs indicated the strength of the unseen power causing Thunder Mountain to tremble before Frank paused for his friend to catch up. ""Yes,"" his friend continued. ""When Joe gestured this way, I paid attention to the line and followed it closely. That's why we got so close to the edge. If that's the cave entrance, we need to stay here and listen."" They stopped under a tree, with the ground littered with broken branches. Some branches were resinous and could make good torches. Bob heard what sounded like a signal, like a giant tapping the rock. The noise grew louder, coming from where his friend pointed to the cave entrance. There was no lightning, ruling out an electrical storm. The noise seemed to come from the cave, suggesting it held the answers. ""Shall we dare to explore the cave now?"" Bob hesitated briefly, then with determination, agreed to go in. They realized they needed a light to enter the cave and discussed Joe's encounter with a possible demon.

"While talking, Frank lit a cedar torch, which burned brightly. Bob was impressed by the success of his friend's makeshift lantern. ""Maybe. If it lunges, aim for the center,"" advised Bob as they approached what they believed was the cave entrance mentioned by Spanish Joe. They reached the wall swiftly and confirmed the presence of the gaping hole. Frank, without hesitation, entered the opening, followed by Bob, gun at the ready. The torch illuminated the cave, revealing nothing extraordinary except its twisting path into the distance. Suddenly, Bob noticed the panther leaping towards him. Though he dropped his rifle, he deftly picked it up by the barrel. With the panther poised to strike again, Bob instinctively jabbed the rifle butt at its head, causing it to retreat but losing his balance in the process."|"['1.

The boy faced a fierce panther, but he wasn't alone. His comrade didn't hesitate to join the fray. Unable to reach his gun, the boy used a torch. Wild animals fear fire, and the panther was no exception. With a swift strike, the boy made the panther retreat. The panther, already wounded from a previous fight, didn't want more trouble. The boys discussed the panther's odd collar, hinting at captivity. Despite the panther's defeat, they remained cautious, knowing the danger it posed.

"""Wait, there it comes again, Frank. Don't you think we'd better lie down till the worst is over?"" suggested Bob, hearing the powerful anvil chorus starting up. The two huddled together. Frank wedged the torch into a crevice, wanting both hands free to hold his rifle in case the cave's guardian beast attacked again.

""I'm worried our torch will go out,"" Frank said, nodding at the flickering light, battling against the rushing air heading for the cave mouth. Bob, feeling anxious in the darkness, asked about the moist spray they felt. Frank, having observed geysers before, believed Thunder Mountain housed a giant geyser causing the ground to shake. He suspected that during severe tremors, water might rush out, flooding the barranca.

Bob questioned if water had ever exited through the passage, but Frank doubted it, noting the absence of signs."|"['1.

"""I'm really relieved to hear you say that, Frank. We're deep inside now, so escaping would be impossible if something were to happen. The cave seems to be expanding as we move along,"" remarked Bob.

""Exactly, it's like a bottleneck. That's probably why the thunder noise travels so far. Sometimes it can be heard over twelve miles away. I've seen Navajo Indians drop to the ground when they hear it,"" explained Frank.

""Could there be a hermit living here?"" Bob inquired, puzzled by the idea of someone enduring such terrifying sounds.

""Remember when we first heard the noise back at camp? The wind was from the Southeast. It's the same tonight as we climb the mountain. That means something,"" Frank pointed out.

""Maybe the wind direction triggers the geyser in Thunder Mountain. It only erupts when the wind is from the Southeast, like now. As for the hermit, what if a prospector found gold in these caves? Gold can drive people to extreme lengths. Remember Lopez and his fear?"" Frank suggested.

""You always see things clearly, Frank. Lopez could be helping the miner secretly gather gold dust. The mystery surrounding this mountain has aided the prospector.

In a dark and eerie cave, Frank and Bob find themselves surrounded by panthers and the constant thunder echoing through the mountain. Bob worries about the possibility of an explosion from the old geyser, but Frank reassures him. As they explore, Frank uses a burning torch to light their way, shielding it from the strong winds. Frank's keen eyes spot signs of recent mining activity, and they come across two familiar figures: little Lopez and a girl who might be Peg Grant, the granddaughter of a prospector named Smith.

Bob suggested that the stranger might be leaving the ranch soon, maybe because he doesn't like how things are going. Bob also worried about the possibility of the stranger firing at them. As the geyser erupted, Bob observed that each blast was stronger than the last, wondering when it would stop. Later, they met Frank, who shared that he had found a rich pocket but was concerned about the geyser acting up. Frank explained that he stumbled upon the geyser accidentally and found something valuable. The miner mentioned that his pet painter, Nero, was missing, likely sensing the danger.

As the group moved swiftly towards the exit, leaving the chaos behind, the noise grew louder, creating a sense of urgency to escape the cave before things worsened. Excitedly, one of them exclaimed relief at reaching the destination and expressed concern about Nero, a missing pet, possibly sparing them from danger. They anticipated rain but were grateful it didn't happen, eager to reunite with their horses below. They had prepared an exit strategy with piled stones, ensuring safety. Despite the upcoming challenges, they were cautioned to be cautious due to the steep terrain. The group split ways, wishing each other luck, with promises of future reunions and plans for a ranch.

Frank and Bob were exploring a canyon when they heard a roaring sound. Frank warned Bob about a possible flood from a geyser. Bob, feeling uneasy, suggested climbing up. Frank agreed and mentioned the smooth walls could make it hard to find a way out. Bob, noticing a change in the sound, asked if something had happened. Frank suspected the geyser had burst, causing a flood. As they climbed, they realized they needed to reach a rock shelf before the flood came.

Bob realized the nearby approaching torrent's roar deafening his senses. The rocks trembled under the unleashed forces. A cold shiver ran through him, fearing the rock he clung to might give way. Suddenly, something grabbed him, pulling him to safety. Frank had reached the ledge first and helped Bob up. Exhausted, Bob lay on the rocky shelf, watching the foamy waters below. As the flood rose, a new fear gripped him. The lightning helped them see the danger. Frank reassured Bob that the water wouldn't reach them on the ledge. They realized they were trapped with no way up the wall. Frank explained the water's flow, giving them hope for the morning to plan their escape.|"['1.

Frank advised Bob to sit up and move his arms to keep warm and prevent shivering. They were on a mountain after an electrical storm, and the air had turned cold. Bob longed for dawn as they waited. Frank reassured him, pointing out the clear sky and stars. They needed to wait for the bridge before crossing the stream. Frank, a skilled swimmer, promised a way out. In the morning, they saw the clear sky and the rushing river below. With the help of Hank and his cowboys, they were rescued. The cowboys were amazed by the sudden appearance of the river. The river had broken through, ending the underground rumbling. Hank wondered if the noise would stop now that the river had found its way back.|"['1.
