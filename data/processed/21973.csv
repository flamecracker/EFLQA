In Paris, a clever monkey, like Jack, was trained to perform tricks. Once, as I met him on the stairs, he made way for me, greeted me, and even cleaned my dusty dress and shoes. These monkeys are obedient and skilled. Some monkeys are even more accomplished; they act in plays and outwit others for food. In the forests near the equator, monkeys and apes gather, astonishing newcomers with their numbers and behaviors. They enjoy movement, pilfering, and destroying things. They are serious and solemn in their actions, not merry. Monkeys are curious and deliberate in their actions, examining objects closely. They can be violent when irritated and remember affronts. For instance, a monkey once put a kitten in a soup tureen during a dinner party, causing a commotion.|['1.

A well-behaved monkey that belonged to my eldest daughter was brought from the Gambia to England. This monkey seemed to understand that he could control the child and would bite or scratch her if she pulled him too hard. Despite punishing him for his offenses, I also cared for him when he behaved well, gaining complete control over him. Unhappy in London, where he was confined to a stove, he would break things once released. Eventually, his mistress donated him to the Jardin des Plantes. I visited him daily at the garden and, when I stopped, the keeper said he eagerly awaited my return, taking a while to befriend his cage mates. Years later, when I revisited, the monkey joyfully recognized me, showing affection. The chimpanzee, known for imitating humans, appeared melancholic and occasionally displayed bursts of anger. In Africa, powerful Quadrumana walk upright and imitate human actions. An enormous chimpanzee pair, preserved in rum and brine, were brought to Bristol, with the male's likeness preserved due to the rum's hair-destroying effects. This male, with large claws and teeth, was formidable, resembling the Ingheena reported by Mr. Bowdich.|"['1.

Monkeys are fascinating creatures that exhibit a wide range of behaviors and interactions with humans. One such example is the Ungka Ape, a Gibbon from Sumatra, described by Mr. Bennett. This two-foot-tall ape had long arms, short legs, and a black fur coat. He had a pouch under his throat and made various sounds to communicate, from squeaks when happy to barks when irritated. The Ungka Ape was known for his playful nature, especially with a Papuan child, and his mischievous antics like stealing ink and sweet treats. Monkeys, like the Budeng of Java, display a mix of fear and curiosity towards humans. In some cultures, monkeys are revered and even fed, while in others, they are seen as pests.

The explorer encountered numerous monkeys while working in the jungle, and initially, they played around him like they did with the locals. However, when he planted a sugar-cane field, chaos ensued. Wild elephants, jungle hogs, jackals, and deer ravaged the crop. To protect it, a sturdy fence was built with a trench to deter even elephants. The monkeys, though, mocked the defenses. Frustrated, the explorer devised a plan. He coated young monkeys in a mixture of treacle and tartar emetic, which made the other monkeys lick them, resulting in them avoiding the area for years. Monkeys' intelligence and boldness raise curiosity about their behavior with the introduction of a railroad in India. Monkeys exhibit distress when hurt, appealing to human compassion. An incident involving a monkey on a ship showcases their inquisitive nature, leading to a tragic encounter with scalding pitch.|"[""1.

Mr. Forbes shared a tale about a female monkey shot by a friend and brought to his tent. When her tribe approached threateningly, the gentleman aimed his gun, causing them to pause. The tribe's chief, however, advanced chattering fiercely. Only by aiming at him did he retreat. Eventually, he approached the tent sorrowfully, seemingly pleading for the body. After receiving it, he carried it away with affectionate gestures, disappearing with his companions. The incident led the sportsman to vow never to harm another monkey. Monkeys are consumed in parts of the Old World and South America. The passage also discusses the howling monkeys of South America, their eating habits, and the endearing Marmozet monkey. Additionally, it mentions a white monkey's mischievous behavior on a house roof and a monkey using another as a shield on a ship. Lastly, it touches on the Maki animals in Madagascar and the Eastern islands, including their nocturnal habits and a disturbing incident of cannibalism among them.|"[""1.

Monkeys are fascinating creatures with an interesting legend in Northwestern Africa. The tale tells of a cook who married a woman who looked down on him. She demanded to live separately from the kitchen. The man promised to build her a new house but took his time gathering wood. When she grew impatient, she beat him with a stick. Eventually, he disappeared into the bush and transformed into a monkey, giving rise to all monkeys. Bats, known as Cheiroptera, possess the unique ability to fly due to the skin stretched between their limbs. They feed on insects, fruits, and even blood. Bats are nocturnal creatures that hang upside down during the day. Their appearance can be grotesque, especially those that feed on animals, with large ears and nose appendages. Some bats in the East Indies can measure up to five feet in wingspan. They have a musky odor and unique features like jointed, horny spine pieces. Their sharp bite makes them difficult to tame, and they seek shelter in masonry, rocks, and trees.|"[""1.

Different opinions exist about vampires or blood-suckers. The Eastern species are considered harmless, while South American vampires prefer cattle, especially horses with long manes, clinging to their hair to suck blood. They flap their wings over the victim's head to keep them quiet and attach to the tail for blood. These creatures are so silent and gentle in their attacks that animals are not disturbed while sleeping. The vampire's teeth create a deep triple puncture. Captain Stedman, who traveled in Guiana, recounted being bitten by a vampire. Mr. Waterton also confirmed blood-sucking incidents. Bats can remain torpid in winter and have been found in trees, like a bright scarlet bat discovered alive in a wild-cherry tree in Selkirkshire.|"['1.

In December 1826, a man found a scarlet bat inside a pear tree near Kelsall. Due to superstition, he let it go, thinking it was otherworldly. Bats are vital for controlling insects that harm crops. Moles, part of the Insectivora group, eat worms and insects. They have sharp senses of smell and hearing, and their fore-feet help them dig tunnels. Moles also eat roots and can be cannibalistic if food is scarce. They avoid garlic but can devour harmful plants. A French naturalist, Henri Lecourt, studied moles extensively, helping prevent canal banks from collapsing due to mole tunnels. Despite being pests to some, moles play a crucial role in land drainage.|['1.

The Earl of Derby owned a deserted island in Loch of Clunie, where moles swam across to settle. They are known to be carried by their companions, holding onto their tails, as they transport soil while lying on their backs. Moles are skilled architects, constructing intricate underground fortresses with chambers and connecting galleries. Their hunting grounds are marked by mounds of earth. Females have separate birthing chambers, and moles shift locations as needed, even swimming across rivers. Moles are voracious and strategic hunters, feasting on birds by tearing them open. Catching moles is a challenge due to their swift movements. Hedgehogs, another insect-eating mammal, are resilient to poisons and can consume substances harmful to others.|['1.

Hedgehogs are fascinating creatures known for their unique defense mechanisms. These small animals are covered in sharp prickles that they can erect by contracting special muscles attached to their skin. When they feel threatened, hedgehogs roll themselves into a tight ball, protecting their vulnerable parts. Their prickles are so resilient that they can be thrown great distances without getting hurt. Hedgehogs are nocturnal and can be found in woods, gardens, and orchards where they feed on insects, slugs, frogs, and even fallen fruits. They are excellent at controlling pests like beetles and cockroaches, making them valuable allies for gardeners. Despite their prickly appearance, hedgehogs can also display surprising behaviors, like stealing items to build cozy nests.

Bears are fascinating creatures that belong to the Carnivora family. They are classified as Plantigrada, which means they walk by placing their entire feet firmly on the ground. Bears are known to be both cunning and ferocious, yet they also display good humor and a love for fun. These solitary animals spend most of their lives in the wild, climbing trees with ease and residing in caves, holes, and hollow trees. In colder regions, they retreat to secluded areas during winter to give birth to their young. Despite myths, bears do not hibernate but may appear lean due to the absorption of their fat reserves. Bears have a unique way of walking, possessing large claws for digging and the ability to walk on their hind feet. They are formidable when provoked but generally avoid conflict unless hungry or threatened. Although their population has decreased due to human encroachment, bears can still be found in various regions worldwide.|['1.

The Canadian black bear is a powerful animal that can outrun even the fastest human. Dr. Richardson disproved the myth that it is slow by mentioning its climbing abilities, likening it to a cat. While the bear mainly feeds on berries, eggs, and roots, it won't reject meat if offered. A settler once had a wrestling match with a young bear that had caused trouble in a plantation. In another tale, an English officer trained a bear to perform tricks and even brought it to England. The bear formed a special bond with a little girl on board a ship, showcasing its playful nature.

Professor Bell had a pet badger that behaved like a loyal dog. The badger was initially tamed by some children and grew to be a favorite at Mr. Bell's. It had a unique cry when separated from its owner and ate dinner very neatly. The badger was affectionate, good-natured, and clean. Unfortunately, it passed away due to a stomach condition common in captive carnivorous animals. One day, while sitting by a loch, the narrator encountered a group of badgers feeding on snails and worms after a rain shower. The badgers were unaware of the observer's presence and continued to forage. Badgers are known for their strength and cunning, able to escape traps and display ingenuity when caught.

The second tribe of Carnivora, known as Digitigrada, walks on its toes. These animals are smaller and have valuable fur, but some are considered vermin due to their destructive habits. Vermiform animals have long bodies and short legs, allowing them to slide through small openings like worms. Weasels, polecats, ferrets, martens, skunks, ermines, and sables are part of this group. Skunks are particularly disliked because of their foul-smelling gland. Weasels are courageous and have been known to attack even larger animals and humans. They are skilled hunters, mainly preying on mice, rats, voles, and moles. Weasels are difficult to tame but are intelligent creatures. They are often mistaken for stoats, which have distinct differences in appearance. Despite misconceptions, weasels play a vital role in controlling vermin populations.|['1.

Weasels are sometimes hunted by hawks, as described by Mr. Bell. A gentleman named Pinder witnessed a kite attacking a weasel. The kite, after seizing the weasel, started showing signs of distress and eventually fell to the ground. Mr. Pinder discovered the weasel unharmed, while the kite lay dead with injuries. Weasels build nests in holes in banks or trees and fiercely defend their young against threats. Otters, aquatic creatures with webbed feet, are skilled swimmers and divers. They are known to hunt fish and have a reputation for being fierce when provoked. Otter-hunting is considered a thrilling sport. Despite being seen as a nuisance by some due to their fish consumption, otters can be trained to fetch fish. In some countries, otters are domesticated for this purpose. The otters are tamed from a young age and taught to retrieve fish through training with artificial fish toys. They become useful and docile when trained properly. In the past, otters were so abundant that they helped locals find fish along riverbanks. The otters would leave partially eaten fish, benefiting the villagers.|"['1.

Otters are known for their affectionate nature. If a parent otter is killed, the young ones seek their mother anxiously. These creatures show remarkable loyalty; if one of a pair is lost, the remaining one will tirelessly search for its mate. Otters also exhibit compassion, as seen when one tries to free its trapped companion. In Scotland, folklore suggests that otters have a leader, larger and spotted with white. The otter's mysterious habits, watery dwellings, and dark fur captivate the imagination of the peasantry. They are believed to possess magical properties, with their skin thought to protect soldiers and sailors.

To test the strength of Esquimaux dogs, Captain Lyon conducted experiments. He found that three dogs could pull him on a 100-pound sledge at a speed of one mile in six minutes. These dogs are motivated to work with heavy loads by a woman walking ahead holding a mitten, as they associate her with food. They are obedient and affectionate towards women as they receive kindness from them. The Hare Indians' dog, described by Dr. Richardson, is smaller than the Esquimaux breed, with broad feet to prevent sinking in snow. Newfoundland dogs are a mixed breed, known for their intelligence and diving abilities. One Newfoundland dog showed exceptional intelligence by retrieving a sea plant for Professor Owen.

"In his book ""Excursions in and about Newfoundland,"" Mr. Jukes mentions an intelligent dog that excelled in fishing. The dog, resembling a Shepherd's Dog, sat on a rock beneath a fish stage, watching the water for sculpins. When a fish turned, the dog swiftly caught it in his mouth.

The majestic Stag-hound, known for its steady and cautious nature, is almost as valuable as the blood-hound in tracking scents. Stories of its incredible perseverance and strength in pursuing game are legendary. However, the breed has dwindled since the era of George the Third, who cherished this form of hunting. Stag-hounds are slightly smaller than blood-hounds, with rougher coats, broader noses, shorter heads, droopy ears, and bushy tails. An extraordinary stag chase in Westmoreland, extending into Scotland, saw two hounds relentlessly pursuing a stag for over 120 miles. The exhausted stag eventually returned to its starting point and collapsed after leaping a wall. The hounds, unable to leap the wall, were found lifeless nearby. Fox-hounds, smaller than stag-hounds, are usually white with black and tan patches. They can sprint for ten hours, necessitating horse changes or abandoning the chase. Harriers and Beagles are even smaller, with the latter prized for its melodious baying. Turnspits, descended from poorly-built hounds, were once kitchen helpers but are now nearly extinct. Pointers, believed to have originated from the Phoenicians, have an innate ability to point at game. They are known for their docility, affection, and smooth fur.|['1.

The wide range of spaniels makes it challenging to list each type in a brief text. Instead, I will focus on some general traits. Spaniels are akin to small setters, with long hair and ears, often silkier than setters. Some have curlier and slightly harsher coats, showing a preference for water. They are loyal, intelligent, and prized for their beauty, serving well in hunting. While most are friendly, some may be reserved. For instance, a red and white Blenheim spaniel was initially aloof but grew close to a visitor over time. These dogs can surprise with their antics; like Fanny, who sneaked in during a music performance with a treat. Another spaniel named Flora cleverly disposed of her muzzle in a pond, showing her wit and love for water.

In ancient fables, the fox has always been portrayed as a cunning character. One amusing story from Ireland tells of a fox being chased by hounds. The fox cleverly climbed onto a turf-stack, then a stone wall, and even onto a cabin roof to escape. Eventually, the fox dropped down a chimney into the lap of a surprised old woman, avoiding the hounds. In fables from various cultures, the fox is depicted as a sly and crafty animal, often outsmarting its enemies.

The hyena was once thought to be incapable of forming bonds, but instances reveal otherwise. Mr. Burchell's hyena from South Africa showed love and jealousy, while Colonel Sykes' Indian hyena behaved like a loyal dog, recognizing him even in a zoo. The Spotted Hyena, also known as the Hyena Capensis, is found in Guinea as well and is known for preying on strong animals. South African traveler Mr. Steedman describes the Spotted Hyena as having a preference for human flesh, even targeting children. The Striped Hyena, less common, feeds on shore and is cunning, preying from a distance. Conflicting reports exist about hyenas, with some regions fearing them, like Abyssinia.

Cats are fascinating creatures with a long history of mystery and superstition surrounding them. While domestic cats differ from the wild species that inhabit mountainous and wooded areas, they share common traits like agility, elegance, and a hint of cunning. The wild species, particularly found in the northern parts of England and Scotland, are known for their bushy tails, black soles, and ferocious nature when approached.

A unique genetic mutation has led to the creation of a tailless cat breed, which is not considered an improvement since the cat's tail is known for its grace and expressiveness. Different animals with a particular formation of front teeth are grouped under Rodentia, signifying gnawing in Latin. These teeth act as files, aiding in food digestion by reducing it through friction. Some animals exclusively eat vegetables, while others prefer flesh. Squirrels, among the Rodentia, are known for their beauty, living in trees. Their fur is valuable, and they are agile and easily tamed, displaying affection. Squirrels have bushy tails used for balance and guidance, with flying squirrels having skin extensions to glide between trees. The English squirrel's color changes with the seasons, and they live in pairs, storing food and nesting in tree holes. They are herbivores and occasionally prey for larger birds.|"[""1.

One evening in Bathurst, St. Mary's, while working in a quiet upper room, I suddenly heard a sound nearby. Startled, I looked around and spotted a large rat perched on the table beside me, watching me intently. Despite the surprise, I found it amusing how boldly the rat observed me. I carefully put down my work, quietly left the room, and called for help. It turned out there were nests of rats in the chimney, so the hunt began. The men chased the rats out, catching them in a cloth. After disposing of the rats, it was discovered that the Genet cats had taken them away. The next day, the presence of young rats was revealed, leading to their removal. Another incident involved a rat and a venomous serpent engaged in a fierce battle, resulting in the serpent emerging victorious.

The Zoological Gardens in Regent's Park are overrun by rats. These clever creatures avoid capture during the day by crossing the canal to the opposite shore and return in the evening to cause mischief. Water-rats, or Voles, are destructive, eating fish, frogs, and more, damaging banks and dams. Their acute sense of smell keeps them away from traps. Rats are drawn to roast beef, even resorting to extreme measures to eat it. Rats have shown remarkable intelligence, like working together to transport eggs down stairs. A swan once saved a rat from drowning during a flood. In a humorous incident, a rat disguised as a dog was discovered in a London home. Mice, although similar to rats, are more charming and trainable. They can be destructive to plantations but are known for their intricate nests.|['1.

During an illness that lasted for several weeks, I found myself entertained and sometimes annoyed by the presence of mice in my room. They often scampered along a ledge near my bed, occasionally venturing onto my face, prompting me to keep my bed curtains drawn. At times, they even snatched my handkerchief, nibbling holes in it. Once, a mouse fell into my cold tea while trying to climb the table next to my bed. Despite my thirst, I couldn't drink it. The mice seemed to hold meetings, moving in a deliberate manner around the room. They even attempted to reach dainties placed on top of a chest of drawers, but the slippery surface foiled their efforts. One mouse's reaction to music on a ship in Portsmouth showed a strange sensitivity to music, ultimately leading to its demise. Additionally, the text mentions the Pachydermata group of animals, highlighting elephants with their trunk as the largest and sometimes considered the most intelligent.|"[""1.

The trunk of an elephant is an incredible organ with over 40,000 muscular fibers that allow it to be incredibly flexible. It can contract, raise, depress, curve, turn, and twist at the will of the elephant. This amazing appendage can even pick up the thinnest substances with the help of its finger-like tip. Elephants use their trunks to hold liquid, which they can then put in their mouths or spray over objects or themselves. Elephants are known for their trumpet-like sounds that express their emotions, and they use their trunks to show affection. These gentle giants take great care to protect their trunks from harm and use them to gather food and even uproot trees. Their tusks, used for defense and made of ivory, are incredibly heavy and powerful. Elephants have unique teeth that change multiple times in their lives, and their large ears and sensitive hearing make them fascinating creatures.|"[""1.

The elephant's preferred habitat is the forest or green plains near water sources like rivers or lakes. Bathing is crucial for elephants in both the wild and captivity. An elephant at the Jardin des Plantes would play a trick by hiding in a pond, only revealing the tip of its trunk. The elephant would then spray water on unsuspecting onlookers, delighting in the chaos it caused. Differences between Asian and African elephants have led to them being classified as separate species. The African elephant has larger ears and a more convex forehead compared to its Asian counterpart. The passage also touches on the idea of taming elephants for dominance and the unique behavior of solitary male elephants. Domesticated elephants may return to the wild but retain their training. They are known for their usefulness in transporting heavy loads and are adorned in elaborate decorations for ceremonial events.|"['1.

In captivity, an elephant consumes about 200 lbs of food daily, along with thirty-six pails of water. Their diet includes turnips, rice, chaff, bran, hay, and sea biscuit. When in menageries, visitors often give them treats like bread or carrots. Elephants in the wild eat juicy roots, tree branches, grass, and bulbous roots. They use their proboscis to pull up food and beat tree branches before eating them. Their herds clear paths through forests, with large bulls leading and females and young following. Elephants can be destructive, as seen when they fell into trenches or damaged crops. In one encounter, an elephant attacked Lieutenant Moodie, who narrowly escaped after shooting at it. Another soldier was not as fortunate, meeting a tragic end at the hands of an elephant.|"[""1.

Elephants are known for their remarkable memory and strong instincts. One extraordinary example is a female elephant who learned to perform rope-walking acts after being brought to the Adelphi. Despite the loss of her mother, a baby elephant displayed deep grief and even tried to protect her body from vultures. Elephants from Ceylon are renowned for their memory, as demonstrated by an elephant that remembered an execution command given 35 years prior. Major Rogers, who had killed many elephants, narrowly escaped death when one retaliated after being shot. Elephants have long memories and can hold grudges against those who mistreat them, but they also show immense gratitude for kindness, like when an elephant rescued a lady who had shown him generosity. Elephants also form strong bonds with each other, as seen when separated elephants joyfully reunited in the Jardin des Plantes.|"['1.

Elephants are known for their intelligence and ability to show emotions. They can feel indignation and even seek revenge. In one instance, an artist in Paris tried to draw an elephant in a specific pose by teasing it with food. When the elephant realized the deception, it retaliated by splashing water on the artist's drawing. Elephants are also capable of deep affection and gratitude. They have been known to refuse food and even die of sadness when separated from their favorite keepers. Despite their immense power, elephants can display humanity. One elephant refused to walk over sick people and instead gently moved them aside with its trunk. These stories highlight the complex emotions and intelligence of elephants, showing that they can be both vengeful and compassionate creatures.|"['1.

The hippopotamus, an exclusive resident of Africa, is known for its peculiarities and behaviors. These creatures, harmless when left alone, may sometimes wander into plantations and cause damage. Despite their peaceful nature, they can retaliate fiercely if provoked, using their enormous weight to inflict harm. Their thick hide, lack of hair, short legs, and small eyes and ears distinguish them physically. Hippopotamuses live in small groups, feeding on grass and aquatic plants, emerging at night. Their flesh is considered edible, resembling pork, with a layer of fat under the skin prized as a delicacy. The male is the largest, and they are believed to have two species. While they may seem docile, encounters like the one described by Captain Owen in Delagoa Bay reveal their potential for aggression when threatened.

The male wild boar prefers solitude except for brief periods with females. They dwell in dense forests, emerging at dusk to mainly eat plants, resorting to animal food only when hungry. Females gather in groups, protecting their young from males who may devour them. When threatened, they exhibit remarkable courage, forming defensive lines or circles around their offspring. Wild boars have been hunted as a noble sport since ancient times, requiring skill and bravery due to their ferocity. In England, they were considered royal game and efforts were made to breed them in the New Forest. African wild boars have unique features, living in underground burrows. Hunting them is a celebrated triumph for native Africans. The meat is tough due to the climate, making it less appealing to Europeans. A thrilling account of a wild boar hunt in Luxembourg showcases the danger and excitement of pursuing these formidable creatures.|['1.

Wild hogs are easily tamed but quickly revert to their wild ways, often forming packs. Mr. Byam recounts an encounter with a large boar while hunting alone. After shooting the boar, a herd of boars and sows emerged, prompting him to climb a tree to safety. With limited supplies, including a gun, a flask of powder, and a few balls, Mr. Byam found himself besieged by the herd. To deter the pigs, he fired powder and shouted, eventually shooting an old boar in the face, causing the herd to disperse. Pigs, considered unclean by some cultures, are valued for their omnivorous nature. They have been trained to perform tasks like pointing out letters and hunting truffles. Despite their voracious appetite and occasional aggression, pigs like Jean, saved from slaughter, can become beloved pets.|['1.

They have three toes covered with a hoof on each foot. The rhinoceroses are known for their acute sense of smell and hearing, making it difficult to approach them. However, their sight is limited. They have a prehensile upper lip that they use to plow the ground with their horn. The Javanese and Sumatran species are smaller and less ferocious than the African and Indian species. There are superstitions about their horns, believed to be acted upon by poison. The natives make cups from their horns, claiming that liquid poured into them reacts in specific ways.|['1.

The African rhinoceros is known for its loud blowing noise, especially the black variety, which is considered the most dangerous. They roam at night, visiting the river between nine and twelve for a drink. These creatures can exhibit sudden fits of frenzy, attacking bushes for hours, emitting a strange grunt and whistle combination. Their flesh is likened to beef with a finer flavor. Rhinoceroses move alone or in pairs, actively pursuing objects that catch their attention persistently. They are seen to assemble in herds, with much of their brain located under their horns. They become furious at the sight of fire, dashing forward with mad fury to extinguish it. Horses, on the other hand, are known for their strength, beauty, and activity. Their well-defined nostrils can sniff fresh vigor from the breeze, while their ears convey different emotions. In a state of freedom, horses are swift, fierce, and inquisitive, exhibiting faithful attachment and protective instincts towards their offspring. Their teeth play a crucial role in determining their age, with specific patterns of growth and shedding. Horses' teeth are essential for their well-being and can indicate their age accurately.|"['1.

The history of horses is shrouded in mystery, sparking much speculation about their origins. While the dog's lineage is clear, the horse's first location remains debated. The prevailing belief points to Tartary or Central Asia as the initial home, with the only wild race residing there. Other horses are descendants of domestic pairs turned feral. South America's vast plains house Spanish horse descendants, while North America and Africa also host herds. In England, horses have dwindled to ponies. Mr. Bell suggests the Egyptians tamed horses first, possibly from older Asian sources. Describing horse species is beyond this text's scope, but anecdotes reveal horses' varied personalities. They enjoy a vegetable diet but relish treats like bread, apples, and sugar. Horses can consume animal products, but it may make them unruly. Domestication's quirks are evident, with cats forsaking food for boiled greens, and horses enjoying ale and oat gruel. In the heart of Tartary, truly wild horses roam, managed by vigilant herdsmen who endure harsh conditions to protect their charges.|"['1.

In the spring, wolves target young foals, circling herds at night to attack scattered victims. Stallions defend by charging, and mares join the battle, protecting foals. Arabians value their horses greatly, managing them kindly. An Arab mare, thin at first, regained health and amazed with her grace. A foal survived a crocodile attack, saved by a Moorish doctor. Abou el Marek, an Arab chief, showed loyalty to his horse. Captured and wounded, he freed his horse, who returned him home before dying from exhaustion.

Arabians highly value their horses. For instance, a mare named Cora was secretly brought to the coast and offered goods worth three hundred pounds by an interior Sultan. These horses have prestigious lineages, like the grey horse Derrish, known for its speed and prosperity. While staying near the River Gambia, I saw native horses that were unlike others, being domesticated from a wild herd. One mare was docile, while the male was well-built and spirited. I had to ride a grey horse for exercise, but he disliked strangers. Once, he bolted into the sea when approached by others. English horses are renowned for their beauty, speed, and strength. Nannie, a clever hunter, leaped over a supper table on command. Another mare, Peggy, was beloved and saved her master's life by staying by his side. Peggy's bond with the family was so strong that even after years, she recognized and rejoiced in their presence.|"['1.

Mr. Bell recounts a tale of his grandfather's remarkable swift ass that outpaced even the fastest asses in races and even followed hounds hunting foxes. The rivalry between horses and asses, though unexplained, has led to inconveniences. In Portugal, a horse and an ass were left in the care of a boy. The horse, resenting the presence of the ass, caused chaos by trying to attack it. The boy had to release the ass to defend itself, leading to a chaotic chase. Despite this, some asses, like the one near Bombay, are gentle and even admired by horses. Asses are known for their endurance, with one covering 140 miles in two days at a pace close to a horse.

Deer are part of the game laws in many countries, especially in relation to their hunting and management. In the past, knowledge of Venerie, or hunting, was considered essential for noblemen and gentlemen. Kings' histories are intertwined with deer laws, often resulting in fines, exile, or even loss of life due to violations. Deer are scarce in England but more common in Scotland, Europe, and America. Reindeer, vital to Laplanders, provide food, clothing, and transportation. They are obedient, feed on lichen under snow, and live in herds. Reindeer are the only truly domesticated deer species. In one method of hunting, Dog-rib Indians imitate deer movements to approach and shoot them. A unique story involves a deer and a dog, Peter, who became inseparable in a military regiment. They marched together and even shared a tragic end when the deer met with an accident and Peter was ordered to be shot.|['1.

The Bos genus, found widely, boasts horns in both males and females, making them the largest of the Ruminantia. They typically have short legs and robust bodies. Domestic oxen are often likened to a box on four posts, while wilder species flaunt an elegant arched back. With broad foreheads, flat and wide, large projecting ears, and moist, hairless muzzles, they sport two curved horns that taper to a point. Their necks are thick, adorned with dewlaps that hang between their forelegs. The hoofs are cloven. Origin-wise, these Ruminants remain a mystery. Notably, Zebus, Buffalos, Bisons, and various bulls stand out among them. Zebus, with a fat hump, are agile and versatile, suitable for riding and draft work. Gours are formidable creatures, unmatched by tigers when fully grown, devouring trees and grass, and refusing captivity. Yaks, with narrow nostrils, pointed ears, and dark hair, are wild but can be tamed, known for their long, glossy white tails used as brushes.|['1.

In England, just like sheep, there are numerous breeds of oxen. Oxen play a vital role in the country's wealth, especially known for producing delicious cheese and roast beef. Unlike in Switzerland, where cows are often treated like family members, in England, cows are more like familiar friends. They respond to calls, return to the farm at milking time, and show affection. It's said that cows need to be milked on the same side to prevent kicking. Bulls can be fierce but are influenced by voice and gestures. Both cows and bulls can predict rain after a drought and are curious animals. An interesting anecdote shared by Mr. Bell involves a cow lifting a mischievous boy with her horn and carrying him out of the field. Another tale recounts a bull defending a cow from a panther, showing the fierce nature of these animals.|['1.
