In a secluded town, a mysterious hermit, known for his violin playing, lived alone and avoided people. The locals called him the hermit.

During a visit to the mine, the girls were surprised to see the mysterious musician there before them. He appeared to be trying to assist, but from the girls' hidden vantage point, it seemed he was more of a hindrance. Meggy felt sorry for him, remarking that his fingers were better suited for playing the fiddle than manual labor. Grace observed his secretive behavior and suggested he might be acting out of fear. To change the subject, Betty expressed her desire to help Dan Higgins and Meggy, particularly Meggy, who sacrificed her youth for labor traditionally done by men. Betty offered Meggy a chance to come to the ranch and choose a horse, but Meggy declined, citing her responsibility to her father. As they rode home, they unwittingly took a longer route along a narrow trail flanked by a mountain on one side and a steep drop on the other.
