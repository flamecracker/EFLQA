The cheerful group of boys and girls gathered at the library in Betty's home, a common meeting spot for them. However, the boys rarely joined in such large numbers.

Ocean View, a typical summer retreat, was set back from the shore with cottages and bungalows lining the property. Shell roads led down to the water's edge.

"Amy suggested they sit and admire the ocean as they strolled along the beach. While they gazed idly, they noticed a lone figure approaching. Grace remarked that he seemed to be searching for something on the shore, not them. The man shared a tale about finding a pipe on the beach once.

Betty assured her friends that the men would understand their signals. As she waved her arms and pointed towards Ocean View, the men on the boat seemed surprised at the sight of the girls. Some wanted to turn back, while others insisted on continuing out to sea. The girls noticed the boat leaving quickly, but one man seemed eager to return to the shore. His companions had to hold him back as he tried to jump into the water. Confusion and loud voices erupted from the boat until they finally agreed to keep going.

Mollie and Amy dug until they fully uncovered the object. With a swift movement, Mollie lifted a peculiar iron box from the sand. Placing it on a log, the wind dried the dampness on it. As they pondered its origin, Betty suggested rules regarding items found near the sea. Mollie wiped her hands neatly while Amy examined a carved stick. They debated whether the box was hidden by men or washed up naturally. The black box, heavier than usual, seemed of foreign origin. Its tight-fitting lid concealed its contents, sparking curiosity.

The iron box made a clicking sound, revealing a hidden compartment with a package wrapped in white tissue paper. Betty, surprised by the discovery, shared her accidental finding with her friends. Inside the package, they found sparkling stones that resembled dewdrops in the sunlight. Curious, Allen tested the stones and suspected they might be diamonds. To confirm their suspicions, they decided to consult a jeweler in town. Excitement filled the room as they hoped the stones were valuable diamonds.

As more people flooded into the hall in hastily thrown-together attire, Mr. Nelson explained his actions of safeguarding diamonds from fire and thieves.

"Mr. Nelson chuckled and headed downstairs, returning shortly to inform everyone that he had discovered a small space in the wall by the chimney where he had placed the diamonds in a box.

Betty hesitated about entering the hut, unsure of what to expect. She discussed with her friends, deciding to wait for the return of the mysterious man. They considered the possibility of it leading to something important, especially since he was new to the Secret Service. After resting near an old boat, they dismissed the unease caused by the old woman's strange invitation. As they headed back, Percy, arriving by car, joined them. Despite his fear of the sea, he was glad to be there. The group spent time together, with Percy sitting under an umbrella while the others enjoyed the water. The day continued with a motorboat trip, excluding Percy due to his aversion to the water.

Grace Ford slowly opened her eyes. She glanced over at her friend, Mollie, who was still asleep.

"""She's got to run!"" declared Allen, fiercely. Not all of the party went in the motor boat. Mrs. Nelson did not feel able to accompany them, but Mollie volunteered, feeling her friends might need her if they were found. Tin-Back joined Henry, Allen, and Roy. Will opted to stay with Mrs. Nelson and Grace, wanting to be the ""man of the house"" and also intrigued by the diamonds. They had a clue about the direction the schooner had taken. The motor boat sped off in search, pausing to speak to a few locals for information. Approaching the anchored schooner, Allen called out, bluffing to intimidate the men on board. The situation seemed tense, but for now, there was no serious trouble."|"['1.

Despite Tin-Back's age and rheumatism from weather exposure, he quickly leaped onto the schooner's deck, followed by Roy, Allen, and some fishermen. Allen shouted they were coming, and they hurried below deck with Mollie. A struggle could be heard behind a closed door. Betty gasped and reached out to Allen, who reassured her. The situation was diffused as the old crone retreated, claiming no harm intended. Allen showed an ancient horse pistol for protection. Unexpectedly, the cutter _Minoa_ was sent by Will to assist in the chase. The revenue officers from the cutter captured the schooner's crew, including the old crone. The rescued group headed back to Ocean View as the storm eased. Later, it was revealed that the smuggled diamonds were the reason behind the capture attempt on the girls.|"[""1.

"The smugglers had a daring plan. They used a secret code to signal their partners to bring a boat near the coast. At night, they threw a box with hidden diamonds into the sea. The plan went awry due to a quarrel among the smugglers. They buried the box in the sand. A tramp overheard their discussions and later joined them, revealing the diamonds' location. The smugglers then tried to capture the girls to find the diamonds. However, the authorities intervened, arrested the criminals, and recovered the diamonds. The girls each received a diamond, and justice was served. Peace returned to Ocean View, but the mystery of the cipher and ""B. B. B."" remained unsolved."|"['1.
