"The Romantic poets found inspiration in nature and the innocence of children. Wordsworth celebrated them as wise and pure. In the Victorian era, children became central figures in novels. Children's literature evolved from oral traditions like lullabies and _Mother Goose_ to more sophisticated works. Poems for children by skilled adult poets are a crucial category. Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear used humor and parody to engage both children and adults. Walter de la Mare's poetry captivates with its honesty and musicality, exploring both joy and sorrow. His work, like ""The Ogre,"" weaves tales of danger and magic. Children are drawn to language and rhythm, making poetry a valuable tool for learning. De la Mare's poetry, admired by T.S. Eliot and W.H. Auden, enchants with its charm and mystery, offering a window into a world of spells and triumphs."|"['1.

On a snowy night, the air was cold and crisp. Through the frost-covered window, the Waits sang a sweet song outside. Inside, a lady with beautiful hair twisted and turned. Marjorie May admired the white, gold, and grey crocuses. Madeleine Rose marveled at the blackberry flowers. Humphrey John lamented the fallen leaves and departed swallows. Emmanuel sighed at the thick snow. Imagining himself as the Lord of Tartary, he dreamed of ivory beds and golden thrones, with peacocks in the court and tigers in the forests. Trumpeters would herald his meals, and musicians would play sweet melodies. He envisioned wearing robes of beads and riding through dark glades on zebras. The passage also described encounters with a witch-hare and three witches on brooms.|['1.
