Chapter seven discusses the events during Pedro de Acuña's administration in 1602. Upon his arrival in May, Acuña injected new life into public affairs. The new governor initially focused on domestic matters, such as constructing galleys. However, plans to visit Pintados were delayed as he had to address issues in Japan and Jolo and send vessels to Nueva España. While efforts were made to establish commerce with Quanto, sending workers to Japan to teach shipbuilding was deemed unwise. Religious orders traveled to Japan but faced a cooler reception than expected. Daifusama urged the governor to fulfill promises, leading to negotiations for trade with Quanto. Expeditions faced challenges, with vessels returning from Ladrones and Japan. Despite setbacks, Acuña's efforts in Maluco and Chinese relations show his commitment to regional stability.|"['1.

In ancient and modern texts, Asia is described as having numerous islands rich in minerals and resources. The islands are known as the San Lazaro archipelago, located in the eastern ocean. Notable islands include Maluco, Céleves, Tendaya, Luzon, Mindanao, and Borneo, now known as the Filipinas. When Pope Alexander VI divided the new world between Spain and Portugal, a line was drawn to separate their territories. Portuguese explorers discovered Maluco in 1511, leading to further expeditions. Fernando de Magallanes, serving Castile, claimed the islands for Spain and embarked on a voyage. Despite his death, the expedition continued, marking the beginning of Spanish presence in Maluco. Subsequent attempts faced challenges until Miguel Lopez de Legazpi's successful voyage to the Philippines, establishing Spanish settlements and spreading the Catholic faith.|['1.

In the same year, the adelantado sent the main ship of his fleet to Nueva España with news of their voyage and the settlement in Sebu. He asked for men and supplies to continue pacifying the other islands. Fray Andres de Urdaneta and Fray Andres de Aguirre sailed with them.

During the time of Don Gonzalo Ronquillo's leadership in the Filipinas, he initiated various expeditions and projects to improve the region. He established a Spanish settlement in Panay, named Arevalo, and enhanced trade with the Chinese by creating a dedicated market within the city. Additionally, he endeavored to find a return passage to Nueva España and sent ships on exploratory missions. Despite facing challenges like shipwrecks and unsuccessful conquests, Don Gonzalo continued to send supplies and support to other regions like Tidore. Under his administration, the province of Cagayan was pacified, and a Spanish colony named Nueva Segovia was founded.

Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, who fell ill upon assuming his duties, passed away in 1583 and was laid to rest in Manila's St. Augustine monastery. Diego Ronquillo took over as governor, continuing his predecessor's work, aiding Maluco and other islands. During Diego's term, a devastating fire razed Manila, starting at the closed doors of St. Augustine's convent church. The city, primarily built of wood, burnt down rapidly, causing extensive loss. Diego's tenure also saw the establishment of a royal Audiencia in Manila, with Doctor Sanctiago de Vera as its president. The Audiencia's arrival in 1584 marked a new era of justice, governance, and military matters in the Philippines. President de Vera's initiatives included fortifying Manila with the stone fortress of Nuestra Señora de Guia, pacifying rebellious provinces, and dealing with threats like English incursions. Additionally, Father Alonso Sanches represented Filipino interests in Spain and Rome, leading to the appointment of Gomez Perez Dasmariñas as the new governor.|"['1.

Gomez Perez Dasmariñas swiftly departed Mexico, arriving in the Filipinas in May 1590. As governor, he initiated various projects, such as fortifying Manila and enhancing trade with China. He tackled internal revolts and explored uncharted territories. During his term, tensions arose with Japan, and Camboja sought aid against Sian. The governor planned a crucial expedition to conquer Terrenate in Maluco, assembling a fleet of over two hundred vessels and nine hundred Spaniards. He entrusted Manila's defense to Diego Ronquillo and administration to Licentiate Pedro de Rojas.

The leader and his group spent the night on the deck of the ship, playing games until the first watch ended. Once the leader retired to his cabin, the other Spanish passengers followed suit, leaving guards in place. The Chinese rowers, who had plotted to take over the ship, seized their chance that night. They attacked the sleeping Spaniards, taking control of the galley. A few Spaniards managed to escape. The leader, hearing the commotion, was ambushed and fatally wounded. The surviving Spaniards, Juan de Cuellar and Father Montilla, remained hidden in the cabin. The Chinese abandoned the two men on the coast. The other Spanish vessels nearby were unable to assist. The galley sailed towards China, stopping briefly at Ylocos to leave the survivors behind. The Chinese were later captured in Cochinchina.

In the year ninety-three, Governor Gomez Perez Dasmariñas passed away in the Filipinas, leaving behind a void in leadership. Licentiate Pedro de Rojas, concerned about the governor's documents, sought to secure them from the monastery of St. Augustine in Manila. Despite his efforts, the crucial provision was not found, as the prior had hidden it away for the governor's son, Don Luys Dasmariñas. The city awaited Don Luys's arrival anxiously. Meanwhile, Bishop Fray Domingo de Salazar journeyed to España, urging the establishment of an Audiencia in the Filipinas. The council, after deliberation, elevated Licentiate Pedro de Rojas to the position of alcalde of Mexico. Doctor Antonio de Morga was appointed as the new lieutenant-general of the Filipinas.

During Governor Don Luys Dasmariñas' rule, tensions in Xapon persisted, causing anxiety among the people. The governor sent his cousin, Don Fernando de Castro, with letters to the Chinese authorities in Canton and Chincheo, seeking the culprits who had seized a galley and killed Governor Gomez Perez. The Chinese dispersed, making it challenging to retrieve the stolen items. Meanwhile, in the year ninety-four, a junk arrived in Filipinas with Cambodians, Siamese, Chinese, and three Spaniards. The Spaniards and Chinese on the junk clashed over its possession, with the Spaniards eventually taking control and sailing to Manila. Diego Belloso, a Portuguese prisoner, offered to navigate to Manila to establish trade and friendship, bringing gifts from the Siamese king. Despite challenges, they reached Manila, where plans were made to aid King Langara of Camboja. Governor Don Luys agreed to send a fleet to assist, with the support of the religious Order of St. Dominic.|"[""1.

The decision to embark on an expedition to Camboja faced opposition due to the concerns of many in the city. The majority believed it unwise as it would deplete the city of men and the success of the mission was uncertain. Reports indicated that Camboja was under the rule of the king of Sian with a significant military presence. Proceeding with the expedition risked turning the king of Sian into an enemy, despite recent friendly gestures towards the city. Lieutenant-general Don Antonio de Morga and others advised against the expedition, but Don Luys, influenced by the support of the religious order, remained determined. The fleet encountered a storm, splitting the group. While some reached Camboja, tensions arose with the Chinese, leading to a violent confrontation. An attempt to negotiate with the local ruler failed, resulting in a daring but risky escape by the Spaniards back to their ships, evading pursuit. Captain Gallinato, upon his return, chose to abandon the mission and head back to Manila, rejecting further engagement with the region.|"['1.

During the war in Mindanao, Don Juan Ronquillo, realizing the slow progress and challenges faced by the camp, urgently sent reports and letters to Governor Don Francisco Tello. He suggested withdrawing the camp to prevent further suffering and establishing a fortified presidio in La Caldera. This move aimed to maintain a strategic position and keep allies in Tampacan and Lumaguan hostile to Buhahayen. Meanwhile, the chiefs of Buhahayen sought assistance from Terrenate, prompting a fleet to support them. In a fierce battle, the Spaniards defended their fort and defeated the enemy, leading to peace negotiations. Eventually, the Spaniards returned to Tampacan, dismantling forts in Buhahayen as a condition of peace.

"The ruler's greed was fueled by his theft from the ""San Felipe."" Rumors suggest he plans to travel to Luzon next year, as he is currently occupied with the Coreans.

The Japanese Faranda Quiemon wanted to wage war against Manila, and his supporters urged Taico not to miss the chance to conquer the city. They claimed it would be simple as there were few Spaniards there and that a fleet could swiftly be dispatched, with Faranda leading the way. Faranda, confident in his knowledge of the area, assured Taico of victory. Taico eventually entrusted Faranda with the task, providing him with supplies and assistance. However, Faranda, lacking the necessary skills and resources, was unable to carry out the plan. Despite the city's determination to resist, news of the fleet's preparation in Japan, under Faranda's guidance, caused concern in Manila. The governor and the city discreetly prepared for potential conflict, sending Japanese residents back and disarming those arriving on merchant ships. Additionally, they dispatched two ships to Hermosa Island to gather intelligence and prevent Japanese occupation. Meanwhile, Father Alonso Ximenez, after being imprisoned in Cochinchina, returned to Manila and proposed restarting the expedition to Camboja. He convinced Don Luys Dasmariñas to fund the expedition, pending further information from Camboja. The people of Tampacan and Buhahayen, despite initially being allies, became enemies again.

In Manila, a distressing event occurred that led to a loss of reputation among the Joloans and their neighboring people from Mindanao. While it was deemed necessary to punish the Joloans to restore honor, the lack of preparation delayed this action. Captain Villagra was promptly dispatched to La Caldera with soldiers, but they indulged in leisure until their supplies ran out, leaving the garrison in need. The people of Tampacan found solace in the presence of the Spaniards, hoping for reinforcements promised by Don Juan to avenge the Joloans. Meanwhile, in May 1598, ships from Nueva España reached Manila, reinstating the royal Audiencia. Don Francisco Tello was appointed president, accompanied by auditors and other officials. The archbishop and the bishop of Sebu also arrived.

To avoid the problems caused by excessive trade with the Sangleys in Manila, limiting their numbers would benefit everyone. By reducing their presence to only what is necessary for community service, they would not drive up prices or monopolize goods. This would prevent harmful practices and teachings they pass on to the locals. Purchasing goods locally would ensure timely delivery by Christmas, preventing price hikes if goods from China arrive late. Shipping in May would avoid risks and reach Nueva España earlier.

During the governor's administration, a ship from Camarines reported that two well-armed foreign ships had anchored near Espiritu Sancto. Claiming to be friends, they bartered for provisions and left letters for the governor. These ships were from Holland and aimed to plunder. To counter this threat, Governor Tello fortified the port of Cabit and prepared ships for defense. Doctor Morga led the defense with 150 soldiers and artillery. They readied a galizabra and a Sebu ship with cannons. In just thirty days, the ships were armed and launched. The defense plan aimed to deter the enemy from establishing a stronghold.

Meanwhile, Portuguese residents in Odia conspired to flee the king's wrath with the help of Fray Joan Maldonado. Despite a perilous journey down the river, they faced a fierce battle with Siamese forces, resulting in casualties. Ultimately, they sought refuge in Cochinchina before heading to Malaca.

In March 1601, a letter from a nobleman expressed gratitude for support in the islands. The governor, Don Pedro de Acuña, faced challenges upon his arrival in Manila in 1602, including threats from pirates. He worked tirelessly to build ships for defense against enemies. The governor received a message from a Japanese visitor, Chiquiro, requesting trade and shipbuilding assistance. However, the governor understood the risks of empowering the Japanese with shipbuilding knowledge. Despite sending a modest gift in return, the governor couldn't commit to the Japanese requests without approval from the King and the viceroy in Nueva España. The governor urged patience while awaiting a decision from Spain, as it would take three years for a reply due to the distance. Despite efforts to please the Japanese visitor, Chiquiro's ship met a tragic fate on its return journey.|"['1.

The ship faced challenges as it navigated through the channel, encountering obstacles from Japanese forces on the hills. Despite the Japanese firing volleys, the ship retaliated, resulting in casualties on both sides. The ship successfully passed through the channel, with God seemingly aiding its progress. Meanwhile, in Miaco, the Japanese leader Daifusama granted safe conducts to allow the ship to depart freely. News of the ship's departure and the skirmish reached Miaco, prompting Daifusama to order restitution of goods taken from the Spaniards. The Spaniards were freed, and their belongings were returned. The ambassadors returned to Manila with safe conducts for future voyages to Japan. Governor Don Pedro de Acuña swiftly departed for Panay to assess needs, leaving Licentiate Don Antonio de Ribera in charge of Manila's defenses. Meanwhile, enemy forces from Mindanao raided Luzon and its coasts, capturing Spaniards and causing havoc. Captain Gaspar Perez pursued the pirates, but they managed to escape.

Several years ago, the King commanded an expedition from Portuguese India to capture the fort of Terrenate in Maluco. The fort had been taken over by a tyrannical rebel Moro who had driven out the Portuguese. A skilled soldier named Andrea Furtado de Mendoça was chosen as the expedition's general. He sailed from Goa with a fleet, but due to storms, his ships were scattered. He decided to pacify the rebellious island of Amboino while waiting for reinforcements. Andrea faced many challenges but successfully restored peace. When his ships did not arrive, he sent messengers to Manila for help. Governor Don Pedro de Acuña decided to aid Andrea's mission by sending supplies and soldiers. A Spanish ship with troops and provisions was dispatched to Terrenate, where Andrea was eagerly awaiting support. The arrival of the reinforcements greatly pleased Andrea and his men.|"['1.

The arrival of the mandarins from China raised suspicions among the Spanish authorities in Manila. It was believed that the mandarins had a different agenda than what they claimed. The Chinese were rumored to be sent by their king to study the land and possibly break ties with the Spaniards. The governor and the Audiencia were cautious, treating the mandarins well but restricting their movements. The mandarins expressed their duty to obey the king's orders and return promptly after their mission. Despite initial doubts, the Spaniards prepared for a potential Chinese fleet attack. An unexpected fire in the city caused extensive damage and loss of life.

The new king of Camboja, who miraculously rose to power from being a captive, sought the help of Joan Diaz, a Castilian soldier, survivor of a tragic event involving Spaniards. The king asked Joan Diaz to convey a message to the governor of Manila, explaining his innocence in the deaths of the Spaniards and his nephew Prauncar. The king expressed his desire to maintain the friendship between his people and the Spaniards, requesting religious figures and Castilians to aid in spreading Christianity. Joan Diaz journeyed to Manila, where Governor Don Pedro de Acuña agreed to send religious missionaries to Camboja. A group of Dominican friars and soldiers, led by Fray Yñigo de Santa Maria, embarked on a mission to Camboja to establish peace and spread Christianity. The missionaries were warmly received by the king, who supported their efforts and even sent gifts to Manila as a token of gratitude.

During a nine-day voyage around Capul Island, we found abundant fresh food, water, and wood. The islanders, tawny in color, wear minimal clothing made from plantain leaves. Men wear a linen strip around their waists and another covering their private parts, secured by a nail through the head of the privy part. This custom, aimed at preventing immoral behavior, was granted at the request of the women. The islanders worship the devil and have interactions with him. During their expedition, Candish and his crew navigated near Luzón and encountered a Spanish frigate near Panama. They also learned of rich gold mines and encountered Negros Island.

Oliver van Noordt embarked on a significant voyage in 1598. Hired by a commercial company, he led five ships through the Strait of Magellan for trade along South American shores. Departing on September 13, 1598, the fleet stopped in Plymouth, England, to enlist an English pilot. After facing challenges and losing around a hundred crew members on the South American coast, they entered the strait on November 5, 1599. Disagreements led to the vice-admiral being stranded, with replacements appointed. The fleet dwindled to two ships due to losses. They sailed along the Chilean coast, trading and encountering natives known for their swimming skills. Continuing to the Philippines, they reached the islands on September 15. The Spaniards had influenced the region, but the natives still lived primitively. The islands were rich in resources like rice, wine, livestock, honey, and gold, with plans to cultivate wheat. The Spaniards aimed to develop the islands, facing challenges from some locals.|"[""1.

The Chinese are actively involved in trade in Manila, bringing a wide variety of goods from China such as silks, cottons, china-ware, and more. The Spaniards then load this merchandise in Manila and export it to Nouvelle Espagne, exchanging it for silver which is then traded for gold. The city of Manila, located in fourteen degrees of north latitude, serves as the residence of the Spanish governor and the archbishop. On October 14, 1600, the Dutch encountered the Spanish in the islands, posing as French commissioned by the Spanish monarch. The Dutch were allowed to buy provisions but were later suspected, leading to tensions.

The journey led by Admiral Corneille Matelief from 1605 to 1608 was notable for its operations in Malacca, the Moluccas, and China. The fleet, comprising eleven ships and over a thousand men, faced challenges due to the unruly behavior of the crew, leading to insubordination throughout the voyage. The expedition encountered resistance from locals in various regions, with duplicity and treachery complicating interactions with the Dutch. Despite setbacks in Malacca and encounters with the Portuguese, the Dutch engaged in negotiations and skirmishes while striving to establish trade relations. Upon returning to Holland in 1608, Admiral Matelief emphasized the strategic importance of the East Indies due to ongoing conflicts with powerful adversaries like the Spanish and Portuguese.

If we want to establish ourselves well in the Indias, we need a station where we can be welcomed upon arrival from Holland. This would lead to great profits. Having refreshments ready for our crews and vessels would boost our reputation with Indian princes. The natives view the Dutch favorably but prefer trading with the Portuguese for protection. We need to show the Indians that we have the means and desire to settle among them. The trade in the Indias focuses on pepper from various places, cloves from Amboina and the Moluccas, nutmeg and mace from Banda, Cambaie, the Coromandel coast, and the Chinese and Japanese coasts. To avoid conflict and keep prices stable, it's important for one nation to manage each trade. While we share pepper trade with the English, we can control other spices to secure our profits.|['1.

In my view, we can attract the trade of nutmegs and mace without the need to capture Banda and construct a fort there, which would be costly and harm our reputation among Indian rulers. Instead, I propose making a treaty with the powerful king of Macassar, who supplies rice and food to Malacca and Banda. By sending the king three ships with 200 men, we can join forces with the Macassar troops to take over Banda. We would promise the king exclusive trading rights in Banda, only allowing our nation to trade there at a fixed price. This plan is likely to be accepted by the king of Macassar, who may even agree to build a trading post for us. To control the clove trade, we must remove the Spaniards from Ternate. This can be achieved by disrupting their supply route from the Manilles through a strategic attack on Panama or Panati. By eliminating Spanish vessels in the Manilles, we can cut off supplies to Ternate, leading to their downfall. Additionally, seizing a galley in Ternate would further weaken the Spanish position. To safeguard our commerce in cotton fabrics at Coromandel, capturing Malacca from the Portuguese is crucial as they could disrupt our trade routes. If we fail to besiege Malacca again, the Portuguese could use their fustas to obstruct our trade with Coromandel, posing a significant threat to our operations.|['1.

The Portuguese's trade on the Coromandel coast would be jeopardized if they were ousted from Malacca. This would disrupt their cloth procurement and tip the scales of expense over profit. The English's commerce in the East Indies hinges on Malacca. To disrupt this, Malacca must be seized. The establishment in the Indias is crucial, and Bantam's inhabitants would not cooperate with the English's fixed establishments. Trading in Arracan is advised due to its wealth, despite Portuguese presence. Cambaie's trade is hindered by Portuguese forts on the Malabar coast. The Dutch's second expedition faced challenges with the Portuguese, capturing forts and facing Spanish opposition. Dutch interests in the Indias grew, including agreements with the English and trade with Japan. The Dutch fortified their presence in the Moluccas, Banda, and Amboina, facing Spanish resistance. Negotiations and conflicts shaped Dutch power in the region, leading to a settlement with Banda islanders and the twelve years' truce with Spain.|"[""1.

During the Dutch expansion in the East Indies, Pierre van den Broeck faced conflicts with the English, Javanese, and Portuguese. He served the Dutch Trading Company for over seventeen years, playing a crucial role in establishing Batavia in 1619 and dealing with various challenges. The Dutch voyages under Georges Spilberg aimed to punish the Spanish, leading to a sea battle near Lima where the Spanish suffered losses.

The governor, afraid of the danger, and wanting to end the conflict and bring peace, sent Captain Cristoval de Axqueta Menchaca with troops to defeat the enemy. He left with 200 Spaniards, 300 Japanese, and 1500 Pampanga and Tagál Indians on October 20th. He swiftly found the Sangleys barricaded in San Pablo and Batangas, fought them, and defeated them all except 200 taken as prisoners. The captain spent 20 days on this, concluding the war. The city faced shortages as the Sangleys who provided goods were gone. The Spaniards were worried about a Chinese retaliation. Messages were sent to Macao and other areas. The city's needs were met by Chinese merchants from Chincheo. A ship to Nueva España faced a storm, leading to a tragic loss. The governor readied Manila for an expedition to Maluco.

He expressed the desire of the Terenatans to be vassals of the King, stating that they had wanted to pay homage earlier but were prevented by the king. The king, proud and confident, had refused to surrender the fort to the King and render him homage. He offered to persuade the king to leave the fort of Moro in exchange for his life. The governor, Don Pedro de Acuña, granted the king security of life to come and talk. Eventually, the king and his entourage surrendered to the governor, who treated them with respect. The king returned villages to the Christians and placed his kingdom under the King's power. The governor allowed the king to appoint men to govern his kingdom. The kings of Tidore and Bachan also swore allegiance to the King, promising not to allow the Dutch or others into Maluco for clove-trade.

During the absence of the governor in Maluco, the royal Audiencia of the islands governed the Filipinas. The Audiencia wanted to expel a group of Japanese from the city because they were causing trouble and not ensuring the safety of the country. When they tried to remove the Japanese by force, they resisted, leading to a tense situation where both sides were armed and ready for battle. The conflict was defused by the efforts of certain religious figures, and most of the Japanese were eventually sent away on ships, although they were unhappy about it. This incident posed a significant threat to Manila as the Spaniards were outnumbered by the spirited and brave Japanese. When the governor returned to Manila, he oversaw the dispatch of ships to Nueva España, but he fell ill and passed away, causing great sorrow. The Audiencia buried him with honor, and news of his death was sent to the king.

In the tropical islands, goats and kids are raised, but they often fall ill and perish due to the humid climate and consuming poisonous plants. While ewes and rams were brought from other lands, they struggle to reproduce due to unsuitable conditions. Horses, mares, and asses were introduced by the Spaniards from China and Nueva España. Mules and asses are rare, but there are many horses and mares now thriving. The horses born there are hardworking, well-tempered, and of medium size, while those from China are small but strong. The islands boast a variety of colorful birds, including doves, herons, eagles, and parrots. Monkeys swing through the trees, and various snakes and crocodiles lurk in the forests and rivers, posing dangers to the locals. The crocodiles, in particular, are feared and even revered by the natives.|['1.

In the Philippines, there are abundant gold mines and placers, particularly in areas like Paracali and the Ylocos. Natives, like the Ygolotes, possess rich mines with gold and silver, but trade only what they need for essentials. The Ylocos refine and distribute the gold. Despite efforts to learn their mining methods, the Ygolotes keep them secret, fearing Spanish intrusion. Other islands like Mindanao and Sebu also have gold mines. Pearl oysters in the Calamianes yield large, lustrous pearls, while sea turtles' shells are sold as commodities. Small white snail shells serve as currency for trading with other nations.

After the island of Sebu comes the island of Mindanao, which is more than three hundred leguas in circumference, followed by the small island of Joló. Further down is the vast island of Borneo, spanning over five hundred leguas. These islands are densely populated, with Borneo remaining unconquered. Only parts of Mindanao, like the Botuan river, Dapitan, and the Caragan province, are under control. Between Mindanao and Borneo lie the Calamianes islands, numerous and inhabited by natives engaged in agriculture, trade, and fishing. The tides in these islands are unpredictable due to strong currents and lunar influences, leading to varying high and low tides daily. The natives communicate using a common language, similar to Arabic script, written on tree leaves and bamboo bark. The language of Luzon differs from the Bicayas, with various regions having distinct dialects. The Tagáls of Manila have a rich and expressive language, written with fifteen characters combining vowels and consonants.|['1.

The language spoken in the province of Manila, known as Tagál, is also used in Camarines and other non-adjacent islands in the Philippines. The natives in these regions build their houses similarly, always near the sea, rivers, and creeks. They live in settlements where they grow rice, palm trees, nipa, bananas, and have tools for fishing. The houses are elevated on columns, with small rooms and low roofs made of wood, bamboo, and nipa-palm leaves. Each house stands alone with enclosures for animals and rice processing below. Chiefs' houses, more elaborate and comfortable, are built on trees with multiple rooms. These chiefs ruled over districts and families, with inheritance passing through male descendants. Chiefs received tribute from their subjects and were respected for their leadership in wars and daily activities. Nobility extended to women as well.|"['1.

The chiefs in the barangai held great power over their subjects, treating them as they pleased without any opposition. They could even enslave them for minor reasons. Disputes were settled by appointing elderly members of the community as judges, with both parties presenting their case and witnesses. Laws were based on ancestral customs and were not recorded in writing, varying slightly between provinces but generally following the same traditions. Society was divided into chiefs, timaguas (plebeians), and slaves, with different classes of slaves performing various tasks for their masters without pay. Slaves could be fully enslaved, half-free, or one-fourth free based on their parents' status, and those partially free could be ransomed by their masters for a fair price. The price of a slave varied based on their status and age.|"['1. What was the role of chiefs in the barangai society described in the passage?\nA. They were judges\nB. They were slaves\nC.

The beginnings of slavery among the natives of these islands are uncertain, believed to have originated from wars and disputes where the powerful enslaved others for various reasons, including debts. Slaves were considered valuable assets and were traded like goods between villages, provinces, and islands. Marriages were mainly between chiefs and women of high rank, while slaves married within their class. The solemnity of marriage involved the payment of dowry and a gathering of relatives for a feast. Marriages could be dissolved with the consent of both families and elders. Adultery was resolved through compensation, and inheritances were divided equally among legitimate children.

In ancient times, the succession of leaders in a barangai followed a specific order. The chief's eldest son would inherit the position, followed by the second son if the eldest was not available. If there were no sons, the daughters would succeed in order. Illegitimate children, born to a slave woman or a married woman outside of marriage, did not inherit and were not considered nobility. Loans with high interest rates were common, leading debtors to lose all possessions and even become slaves. Trading involved bartering goods like food, cloth, and even slaves, with gold or precious bells from China as payment. Crimes were punished based on the victim's request, with theft being severely penalized. Insults to chiefs were taken seriously, and certain insulting words were considered grave offenses. The natives engaged in practices like concubinage and incest, especially among the bagontaos (single men) and dalagas (marriageable girls), with little restraint or secrecy. The influence of the Spaniards and Chinese Sangleys introduced new customs and behaviors to the natives, including unnatural sins that required intervention.|"[""1.

The people of the islands of Pintados had customs that were considered strange and barbaric. They had devices called sagras, which were used by men to communicate with their wives in a peculiar way. These sagras involved inserting a serpent's head made of metal or ivory into a hole near the man's private part, which would then be fastened with a peg. Despite causing harm and shedding blood, this practice was popular among them. Additionally, there were men who were paid to take away the virginity of young girls before marriage. The natives worshipped various forms, including the devil, the sun, the moon, and even crocodiles. They had no temples but kept idols called anitos in their homes. The religious affairs were managed by older individuals known as catalonas, who were believed to have supernatural powers.

In each village, an elected governor oversees civil matters involving moderate sums, with appeals going to the provincial corregidor. The governor, along with constables called vilangos, form the magistracy. These governors are elected annually by married villagers, confirmed by Manila's governor. They are responsible for the chiefs and lords, collecting tributes, and assigning services. The natives follow customs in matters like successions and inheritances, judged by royal decrees. Encomiendas, areas granted by the crown, offer profits through tributes like gold, cloth, and rice. Initially, the tribute was eight reals annually per person, paid in goods. However, natives were later allowed to pay in money or goods, impacting their work ethic and the region's economy.|"['1.

When Gomez Perez Dasmariñas became the governor of the Filipinas, he issued royal orders to establish a camp in Manila. The camp was to have 400 paid soldiers, along with officers, galleys, and military supplies for protecting the country. Previously, Spanish residents had managed this defense without payment. A levy of two additional reals per tributario was imposed, collected alongside the existing eight reals of tribute. The extra funds were to be deposited in the royal treasury separately and allocated toward the camp's expenses and the salaries of Manila church prebendaries. The collected tributes were used for hospitals and other beneficial projects for the natives.

The Indians in the Philippines provide rice and various foods at fair prices. The datos, vilangos, and fiscals manage the collection and distribution of these supplies. During times of war, the natives assist as rowers and crews for expeditions, and as pioneers when needed. They are also assigned to work on the king's projects, such as shipbuilding and artillery. Spaniards mainly reside in Manila, the capital, with some living in other cities. Officials are appointed by the governor and undergo residencia reviews. Elections for alcaldes-in-ordinary are held annually. Manila generates revenue through fines, merchandise, and rents. The city uses these funds for fortification, salaries, and celebrations. Other settlements participate in similar events but have fewer resources.

When a ship arrives at the mouth of Manila's bay, a watchman from Miraveles island boards it to inspect and place guards to prevent disembarkation until the vessel is checked. A signal is sent to the city to notify the governor of the ship's details. Upon anchoring, royal officials inspect the cargo and assess its value. The merchandise is then unloaded, and the goods are taken to designated locations for sale. Spaniards, Sangleys, or others cannot trade directly on the ship. The trading period ends by May for the Sangleys to return to China and for goods to be loaded for Nueva España. Skilled Sangleys trade with moderation but may commit fraud. Japanese and Portuguese merchants also arrive with goods like wheat-flour, silk, armor, and more, paying in reals. They return to Japan with purchases like Chinese silk and gold.|"[""1.

The two percent duties paid by the Spaniards for exporting goods to Nueva España total twenty thousand pesos yearly. Additionally, eight thousand pesos are collected on goods and money sent from Nueva España to the Filipinas. This results in about one hundred and fifty thousand pesos yearly for the royal treasury in the Filipinas. However, this amount is insufficient for expenses, so Nueva España sends extra money annually to the Filipinas. This assistance is funded by ten percent duties on Chinese goods at the port of Acapulco. These funds cover salaries, military expenses, church construction, and more. Despite these revenues, the royal treasury in the Filipinas faces financial strain due to high expenses. Measures have been taken to limit the number of Chinese immigrants in Manila to avoid social and economic issues.|['1.

In the past, many Japanese people embraced Christianity in the Philippines, driven by their desire for salvation. They were devoted to their faith and only stayed briefly in the islands before returning home. The Japanese were warmly received due to their friendly nature, fostering good relations between Japan and the Philippines. Ships from New Spain set sail for the Philippines during the brisas season, starting in November through March. These vessels navigated westward, encountering the Ladrones Islands along the way. The indigenous people of these islands, who traded goods with the Spanish ships, met them with lightweight vessels made of palm leaves. The journey to the Philippines from Acapulco lasted around seventy days and was fraught with dangers from the weather. It was crucial to embark during the brisas season to ensure a safe passage.|['1.

From the cape of Espiritu Santo, ships sail through the strait of Capul, passing the islands of Mazbate and Burias. They continue to Marinduque, the coast of Calilaya, the strait of Mindoro, the shoals of Tuley, and finally reach the mouth of Manila Bay. The journey ends at the port of Cabit, spanning a voyage of one hundred leguas which takes about a week. The return voyage from the Filipinas to Nueva España is challenging and risky due to long distances and unpredictable storms. Departing well-stocked and equipped, each ship sails independently, without waiting for others. The route involves navigating through various wind patterns and temperatures, encountering storms near the islands of Ladrones and facing severe weather conditions until reaching the coast of Nueva España. The voyage concludes at the port of Acapulco after a long journey lasting around five to six months.|['1.

One can sail from the Philippines to Spain by way of India, starting from Malacca, then to Cochin and Goa, covering a distance of 1,200 leguas. This voyage is best done with the brisas. From Goa, the journey continues through India to the Cape of Good Hope, the Azores Islands, and finally to Portugal and the port of Lisbon. This route is long and perilous, a challenge faced yearly by Portuguese sailors. Letters and messages from India to Spain are often sent through the Red Sea, carried by Indians to Alexandria, then by sea to Venice and finally to Spain. Galleons bound for Portugal set sail from Malacca, avoiding India, reaching Lisbon faster than vessels from Goa. Castilians are forbidden from these voyages except for the route through New Spain. Despite efforts, no better or shorter course via the South Sea has been discovered.|['1.

"Dr. José Rizal, a Filipino patriot, was born in 1861 in Calamba, Luzón, to a Tagál family. He was sent to Manila for education at Ateneo Municipal under the guidance of Father Leontio and Rev. Pablo Pastells. Initially named Mercado, he later adopted the surname Rizal due to his involvement in the liberal movement. He pursued further studies in Spain, France, and Germany after obtaining his degree in Manila. Rizal founded the Liga Filipina advocating for the expulsion of friars and their properties, laying the groundwork for the Sons of the Nation revolutionary group. Despite being a skilled physician, Rizal was also a poet, novelist, and sculptor. His novels, ""Noli me tangere"" and ""El Filibusterismo,"" shed light on Filipino customs and were met with controversy. Rizal's life was cut short when he was executed in 1896 by native soldiers in Manila."|"[""1. What was Dr. José Rizal's original surname?\nA) Tagál\nB) Luzón\nC) Mercado\nD) Rizal\nE) Manila"", '2.

Sir Francis Drake embarked on a historic journey from Plymouth on November 15, 1577. Despite a setback that forced a brief return to port, they set sail again on December 13. By August 17, 1578, they reached the Strait of Magellan and later captured a valuable prize off the coast of South America. At Canno Island, they intercepted a ship bound for the Philippines, seizing goods before letting it go. The expedition continued to the Moluccas, arriving on November 14, and received a warm welcome at Yerrenate. They navigated through various islands, circled the Cape of Good Hope, and finally reached England on November 3, 1580. This remarkable journey is chronicled in various historical accounts.|"[""1.

In the Solomon Islands, discovered in 1568 by Alvaro de Mendaña de Neyra, the name may have originated from their natural richness or King Solomon's temple materials. The islands, lost after Mendaña's expedition, were rediscovered in 1767 by Carteret. Bougainville, Surville, and others explored them in the 19th century. H.B. Guppy studied them geologically in 1882. The islands lie between 4º 30'-12º south latitude and 154º 40'-162º 30' east longitude, southeast of New Britain. They have mountainous terrain, active volcanoes, and a rainy, fertile climate. The inhabitants, once cannibals, are of Malay descent. The British and Germans possess parts of the islands. The people of these islands, according to Captain Cook, are known for their harmonious proportions and regular features.|"['1.

Delgado, in his book from 1892, talks about the wild amaranths called quiletes, also known as haroma by the natives. These plants are all edible. Pingré's translation of the Descubrimiento de las Islas de Salomon mentions a total eclipse of the moon on the 17th of October. Mendaña, in his will, named his wife Doña Isabella de Barreto as the lady governor of the fleet. The text also discusses a frigate found wrecked with the crew dead, and the crew of a galliot landing on an islet in Mindanao. The soldiers from the galliot were sent as prisoners to Manila. Lord Stanley translates a passage about devout fraternities and missionaries. The Spanish word dojicos is related to the French term dogiques, referring to natives who instruct their countrymen in the absence of priests. Santa Ines offers a slightly different translation of the same sentence, dated to the first year of Quercho. J.J. Rein publishes yet another version regarding the persecution of people from the Philippine Islands in Japan.|"[""1.

In Japan, twenty-six religious and converts were crucified in a row, with ten Japanese converts, six Franciscans, three Jesuits, and seven more Japanese converts. The Franciscans included Francisco Blanco, Francisco de San Miguel, Gonzalo Garcia, Felipe de Jesús, Martín de la Ascension, and Pedro Bautista. Some Franciscans escaped crucifixion. The Lequios Islands are known as the Riukiu or Lu-Tschu Islands, forming part of modern Japan. Father Alexander Valignano's document dated October 9, 1598, explains the crucifixion of three Jesuits. Morga's account differs on the vessels' order, and Hernando de los Rios Coronel mentions a vessel wrecked on the Cambodian coast. The ancient kingdom of Ciampa, now vanished, was once a powerful Indochinese kingdom. Blas Ruiz's statement aimed to claim a share of the war's booty.

The Spanish ship, Almiranta, was wrecked while chasing a Chinese vessel for piracy. It struck shoals, splitting open and throwing the crew into the sea. Some were rescued and captured by the Chinese authorities. Despite warnings from the pilot, most Spaniards insisted on pursuing the Chinese ship, leading to the disaster. The famous Father Mateo Ricci, a renowned European Chinese scholar, played a significant role in spreading Christianity in China through diplomacy. He was a close associate of Father Alessandro Valignani. The pico, a unit of weight, is not fixed and varies in different regions.

Father Juan Maldonado de San Pedro Mártir was born in Alcalá de Guadaira in the province of Sevilla. He studied canonical law at Salamanca University after courses in humanities and philosophy. Father Juan was known for his austere lifestyle at the Dominican convent in Valladolid. He answered the call for workers in the Philippines from Father Juán Crisóstomo. He later worked in the Chinese mission with Father Benavides but had to focus on other duties rather than learning the language. Eventually, he was assigned to Pangasinan and later became the vicar of Gabón. He held various positions, including vicar-general and lecturer on theology.

In the British Museum, a manuscript called Dutch Memorable Embassies mentions a regent named Ongoschio who died on September 16, 1598, at the age of sixty-four after ruling for fifteen years. Japanese society was divided into five classes in the Recueil des voyages, with a battle fought at Sekigahara in October 1600, where firearms and cannons were used alongside spears and swords. The count of Essex captured the city of Cadiz in 1596, leaving it in ruins. Juan Francisco Valdés and Juan Gutiérrez were notable figures during this time. The governor's execution of rebels without trial or the intervention of the Audiencia was likely due to the lack of recognition of Holland's independence by Spain. This led to strained relations and seclusion by Japan.|"['1.

Diego de Guevara, an Augustinian from Baeza, took his vows in Salamanca and arrived in Manila in 1593. He held various roles, like sub-prior and procurator of Manila. Unfortunately, a shipwreck in Japan prevented him from attending the chapter in Rome. After the Chinese insurrection in 1603, he was sent to Spain and later returned to the Philippines as a visitor. Eventually, he became the bishop of Nueva Cáceres until his death in 1621. The sibukaw tree, known for its red dye, is valuable in commerce. The tree's wood is so hard that nails can be made from it, and it also serves medicinal purposes.

Spanish accounts tell the story of Spielberg's attack on Iloilo and his subsequent defeat by Diego Quinones in 1616. Later, he faced another defeat by Juan Ronquillo at Playa Honda in 1617. The book Sucesos had a second edition published in 1609. Fray Diego Bermeo, a Franciscan friar, came from Toledo and served as a missionary in the Philippines. Luis Sotelo, from Sevilla, was a Franciscan who preached in Japan and was eventually executed in 1624. Rizal's remarks on insurrections highlight the tactics used to incite rebellion. The Chinese attacked Quiapo, killing many, including a woman and a boy. The settlement of Laguio is believed to be the present-day Kiapo. Helmets were broken during the attacks, and some managed to escape, including Father Farfan.|"[""1.

Argensola recounted a tragic event where many peaceful Chinese merchants were killed in the parián, while others took their own lives. General Hontay and the rich Chican were among the victims because of their refusal to support Eng-Kang. The alcalde of Pampanga sent 4,000 armed Pampangos to aid Manila during the turmoil. Cruelties were rampant, with Spaniards and natives hunting down the Chinese at the orders of Don Pedro de Acuña and Hernando de Avalos. The arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines, along with Chinese immigration, led to the downfall of local industries and agriculture due to fierce competition. The deep-rooted animosity between Filipinos and Chinese has sparked legislative actions. Despite the historical significance of the Chinese question in the Philippines, the Chinese have persisted in their trade and occupations in the islands.|['1.

In the past, the Bagacay was a weapon used by the Moro people. It was a small, sharp reed hardened in fire, thrown with great accuracy at enemies. The soldiers, after entering a city, resorted to violence and pillaging, sparing no one, not even children or young girls. The consequences of such actions led to hostility towards the Spanish name, making it as odious as the Portuguese. The unfortunate king, exiled by the Jesuit Father Luis Fernández, suffered greatly, even being left to starve by Don Juan de Silva's administration. The king was described as having robust proportions, a cloud-colored complexion, and European-like facial features. His fierce appearance was accentuated by his campilan, dagger, and kris with gilded serpent heads. The Japanese settled in Dilao mutinied after a Japanese man was killed by a Spaniard. The poisoning of some individuals, believed to be instigated by the governor's envious enemies, caused further unrest.|['1.

The king and his chiefs, under Don Pedro de Acuña's custody, were taken as prisoners to Manila. This action led to the king of Tidore, who was an ally of Spain, finding a way to end the alliance. The appointed governors by the captive king refused any involvement with the Spaniards, causing fear and vengeance to spread. The ill-treatment by the Spaniards towards their king turned the vassals against them and towards their enemies. Don Pedro lacked a key characteristic of Legazpi according to Rizal. The relationship described in this text is an appendix to Theodore de Bry's Ninth part of America (Frankfort, 1601) and was printed by Matthew Becker (Frankfort, 1602).

Colin, in his book Labor Evangelica from Madrid in 1663, discusses the naming of the Philippines. He mentions Ptolemy's reference to the Maniolas islands, which some believe led to the name Manilas for the islands. However, Spanish writers, like James A. LeRoy in a letter from March 14, 1904, spent more time on this question than necessary. LeRoy suggests that old Chinese and Japanese documents likely contain information about the Philippines before the Spanish arrival. The exact location of the island of Tendaya, also known as Isla Filipina, remains unclear. Different sources place it in Panay, Leyte, or Samar. The traditions indicate that the Filipino Indians originated from Sumatra, but much of this historical knowledge was lost due to religious efforts to erase pagan records. For more on the ethnology of the Philippines, refer to Professor Blumentritt's work, Versuch einer Etnographie der Philippinen from 1882.|"['1.

Pilê, a fruit from the Canarium commune tree, was highly valued for its usefulness in the islands. It grew in mountainous areas and was harvested by locals who extracted a white pitch from the tree. The fruit had a tough shell and tasted like a large almond. The tree itself was tall, straight, and had broad leaves. Another tree, the Cedrela toona or calanta in Tagál and lanipga in Visayan, had fragrant wood used for ship hulls due to its strength and lightness. The asana tree, also known as Pterocarpus indicus or naga in Visayas, had male and female varieties with pinkish and white wood, respectively.

"Stanley suggests that the term ""maynelas"" may be a misprint for ""maina,"" a bird known for its ability to talk. Delgado mentions a bird called ""maya"" that resembles the pogo, but is smaller and cinnamon-colored, known for its pleasant song. Stanley translates this as ""wild ducks."" Another bird described by Delgado is the ""lapay,"" similar to a duck but with larger feet, always found in water, and its flesh is edible. The Philippines have over 590 bird species, with 325 unique to the islands, mostly land birds. There are 35 types of doves and pigeons, all suitable for consumption. La Gironiére recounts a daring encounter with a massive crocodile near Jala-Jala, where natives believed its flesh could cure asthma and rheumatic pain.

In the past, Mindoro faced a decline in population and agriculture due to various reasons. Gaspar de San Agustin mentioned how the insurrection and the cutting of timber for shipbuilding led to a decrease in population. The town of Guagua, once rich with chiefs and abundant harvests, now lies submerged under the sea. The minister of the Colonies proposed sending criminals to repopulate the island. Colin noted that tattooing was a common practice among different tribes in the Philippines, while the Negritos and Igorrotes still continue this tradition. The Filipinos used black ink for tattooing, unlike the Japanese who used various colors. The arrival of the Spaniards caused a decline in the population of Panay, with many giving up gold mining due to mistreatment by the authorities.

"The state of these captives was not always sorrowful. According to Argensola, they dined alongside their owners and even wedded into their clans. The annals do not document any master or leader being killed out of revenge by the locals, unlike the encomenderos. Post conquest, the situation worsened. The Spaniards enslaved individuals without valid reasons, often taking them from their homes and islands. Fernando de los Rios Coronel's report to the king in 1621 harshly criticizes the brutalities suffered by the natives during Juan de Silva's rule. A missive from Felipe II to Bishop Domingo de Salazar reveals the severe oppression by the encomenderos. This shared legal framework and commonality indicate extensive island interactions marked by friendships rather than conflicts. There might have been a confederation, as historical accounts suggest the Manila chief held a high position in Borneo. The term sagigilid in Tagalog means ""at the margin"" or ""the last,"" signifying a slave. Timawa now denotes ""peaceful"" or ""free."" Maginoo, derived from ""dignity,"" is the current title for chiefs. Namamahay, or ""he who lives in his own house,"" refers to a group akin to modern-day laborers.

In the Philippines, the dowry given by the parents to their daughter's husband was seen as a form of gratitude for the care and attention the parents had put into their daughter's upbringing. The Filipina wife was highly regarded and not considered a burden, but instead, a valuable member of the family. She had freedom and respect, engaging in trade and contracts, often with her husband's consultation. The wife managed money and played a significant role in educating the children. The custom of giving gifts to parents and relatives, based on the rank of the married couple, was also prevalent.

In the past, various cultures had unique burial traditions to honor the deceased. Celtic and Gaelic peasants had ceremonies to mourn the dead, similar to North-American Indian practices documented in Jesuit Relations. Filipino burials involved mourners composing panegyrics for the deceased. The bodies of the wealthy were embalmed with aromatic liquids like the Hebrews, preserving them for years. The rich were buried in chests adorned with jewels and gold. The burial places varied, with some coffins placed on top of houses or under them. Food and belongings were left with the deceased. Circumcision was a common practice among Filipino males for custom rather than religious reasons or cleanliness. The walls of Manila were modified over time, and the San José college, founded in 1601, was recognized for its prestigious history.|['1.

In the past, the area known as Maalat was later pronounced as Malate by the Spaniards. It was home to the chief Tagáls after they lost their homes in Manila. Notably, the families of Raja Matanda and Raja Soliman resided there. San Augustín noted that many ancient nobility lived in Malate, describing them as very refined and cultured. The men held various positions in Manila, while the women were skilled at making lace, surpassing even the Dutch women. The district of the Audiencia, as defined in the Recopilación de leyes, had specific privileges for the governor and auditors, governing the city of Manila and the entire island of Luzon. Despite historical changes, Malate has transformed into Lal-ló, maintaining significance as the bishopric of Bigan.

"In the past, the king assigned different districts to various religious orders. The Augustinians in Mexico allowed their members going to the Philippines to settle anywhere in the islands. They had full ecclesiastical authority until the arrival of the Franciscans in 1577. Papal permissions likely determined the districts assigned by the king. Fray Domingo de Salazar initiated diocesan visits, a process completed in 1775 by Archbishop Don Basilio Sancho de Santa Justa y Rufina and Anda. Regular curas were then inspected by bishops. The Augustinians received one-fourth of village tributes while constructing churches and rice for religious members conducting confessions during Lent. The treatment of native chiefs after conversion was regulated to ensure their well-being and loyalty. The Recopilación de leyes contained guidelines for the governors of the islands regarding the treatment of the native chiefs. Felipe II issued a decree in Madrid on June 11, 1594.

During the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, encomenderos accumulated immense wealth by exploiting the native population. They often used dishonest practices, such as false measures and inflated tributes, to increase their profits. The Spanish crown passed laws to regulate these abuses, including increasing tributes to fund religious instruction in villages and ensuring that encomenderos were held accountable for their financial dealings. Despite these efforts, some encomenderos continued to hold Indian slaves against the king's orders. Laws were enacted to prohibit the forced labor of natives and to protect their rights. These regulations aimed to prevent exploitation and ensure fair treatment of the indigenous population in the Philippines.|"[""1.

During the 17th century, the Spanish King Felipe III issued laws to support the Philippines. Viceroys from Nueva España were directed to assist the governor of Filipinas with men, arms, and money for the islands' protection. No mestizos or mulattoes were allowed to join the reinforcements. Bañuelos y Carrillo proposed that Manila export local goods to prevent Dutch trade. The fabric Piña, made from pineapple plant fibers, was valuable. It was handwoven by native Indians in the Philippines and exported to Europe for clothing. Piña was durable, unaffected by time, and had intricate hand-knotted joinings. Its price ranged from 1.s. 4d. to a dollar per yard, with wide Piña costing more. This fabric was a significant industry in the Philippines, contributing to its economy and cultural heritage.|"['1.

To obtain fiber from the plant, the fruit is initially cut so that the leaves grow long and wide. Once developed, the leaves are removed, scraped to extract the fiber, washed, sun-dried, combed, and sorted into four grades based on quality. The resulting cloth is known for its softness and delicacy. The fruit, called Xi-cu by Chinese traders, is a scarlet fruit with a yellow variety as well. The fruit resembles an acorn but is the size of a lemon with a soft peel and honey-like interior. The tree is broad but not very tall, with small round leaves. The Chinese or Japanese persimmon (D. kaki) and the American persimmon (D. virginiana) are derived from different species of the plant, with ebony wood obtained from some species.|['1.

Agave, also known as pita in the Philippines, was used to make nipis, a native textile in Visayas. The term pita referred to braids or ornaments made from agave fibers. Imposts and restrictions still in place in 1890 forced the search for foreign markets as the local ones offered limited advantages. A document from 1640 mentioned that this trade brought the government 350,000 pesos yearly. Laws outlined the governor's and Audiencia's power in authorizing conquests by private individuals. The revenue from gold mines and jewels was substituted with imposts on property and industry. The Filipinas Islands could have been self-sufficient from their products if not for expeditions to other regions. The examination of royal officials' accounts was to be conducted annually by the president and an auditor of the royal Audiencia.|"[""1.
