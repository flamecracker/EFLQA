"The leader kept his promise. The following day, there was a loud commotion on the hills. Scared, the bears left the acorn field and hurriedly fled to their hiding spots in the western mountains. In celebration, the captain hosted a grand farewell feast for his Native American friends. The feast, held under the pine trees in front of his cabin, featured a variety of dishes from bear steaks to beaver tails. As the banquet neared its end, the women from the encampment approached the captain in silence, each offering a gift at his feet. The gifts ranged from fringed leggings to beaver pelts, culminating in a beautiful brown bear skin adorned with blue ribbons and a drawing of a pappoose. The boy emerged from the skin with joy, showcasing his mother's pride. Can you answer questions like ""phen-dubs"" or recite rhymes like ""onery twoery ickery ann""?

Abram was admiring a gun that belonged to the General, which was nearly as tall as the General himself. The gun was about seven feet long, and Abram shared a story about his grandfather, who was even taller at seven feet two.

The friendly kitty, glad of a companion, curled herself by his side. What comfort she brought to the lonely little fellow! He lay down beside her, and saying his _Our Father_, and _Now I Lay Me_, was soon in a profound sleep, the purring little kitty nestling close. The sounds of revelry in the rooms above did not disturb him. The boisterous songs and laughter, the stamping of many feet, continued far into the night.
