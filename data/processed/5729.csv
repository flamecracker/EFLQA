In mid-November, at Peggy's gathering, ice cream vanished swiftly, and so did Jerome. Unnoticed at first, his return with a grand chocolate cake was met with cheers. The party enjoyed the cake, cider, nuts, and candies. As the afternoon progressed, the guests chatted and sipped cider. Suddenly, two intoxicated cows, Betsy Brindle and Sally Simple, crashed the scene, causing chaos. The cows had consumed fermented apples, leading to their rowdy behavior. Cicero, tasked with the cows' care, was shocked to find them in this state. The incident surprised the guests, interrupting the peaceful gathering at Severndale.|"['1.

Cicero shouted, urging the boys to act swiftly to prevent the cows from causing chaos. The boys, eager for fun, sprang up to help. Shortie took charge, leading the way to protect the table from the mischievous cows. The boys formed a barrier, corralling the cows back to safety. With a mix of shouts and laughter, they guided the cows back to their barn. Peggy, left behind, faced teasing upon the return of the boys. The day ended with a visit to the paddock and stables before the visitors departed. Later, Peggy enjoyed the Army-Navy game and looked forward to Christmas. Mrs. Harold, touched by Peggy's lonely holidays, invited her to spend Christmas at Wilmot. Peggy ensured the Severndale staff had a joyful holiday before heading to Wilmot for a happy Christmas. At the Academy, the midshipmen celebrated the festive season with a Christmas eve hop, as there was no Christmas break until recently.|"['1.

Mrs. Harold, a wise woman, usually didn't permit Polly to attend social events like the hops during the school year. However, she made an exception for Christmas, granting Polly and her friend Peggy permission to go. The Academy's hop was like a fairy-land with beautiful decorations, music that could make anyone dance, and well-dressed attendees.
