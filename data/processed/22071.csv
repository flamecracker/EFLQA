We have spent three days here, keeping ourselves quite occupied. Unpacking and rearranging furniture in our room took up a good chunk of our time.

"""It's right. When people act uncivilized, they label themselves as such. It's unfortunate that we have to see fellow students as foes!"" Jerry exclaimed passionately.

""You can mock my accent if you want, but I won't resort to violence,"" she said cheerfully, using an old Irish saying. ""I'm most connected to my Celtic roots when I'm serious. Maybe it's trivial of us to even discuss the Sans since we have nothing positive to say about them."" ""Absolutely correct, my dear. They initiated it. None of us, before the Lookouts arrived at Hamilton, spoke out against the Sans. We know the Lookouts didn't. The letter Leslie Cairns sent to Jerry signifies a year-long conflict. Unless, luckily, Miss Remson has succeeded in her efforts and they won't return to the Hall. Without them at Wayland Hall, we might have a chance for peace. If they were placed in other campus residences, they would likely lose interest in targeting you girls and focus on someone else.

Marjorie passionately argued for unity, stating, ""Wherever the Sans reside on campus, we must focus on our own pursuits. Let's aim for a harmonious Hamilton, free from cliques.

Marjorie woke up flustered, worried she had overslept due to the stopped wall clock. Jerry reassured her that it was only five minutes to seven and suggested letting her sleep a bit more. Marjorie, full of energy, preferred to get up early as she had a busy day ahead with unpacking trunks and meeting the five o'clock train with friends. They were part of the sophomore committee welcoming freshmen, a responsibility they had taken on during a meeting the previous June. Marjorie noted that they were among the few committee members who had returned to Hamilton. Jerry expressed a momentary regret about not having a car but acknowledged the benefits of walking.

Jerry predicted that the task would be abandoned shortly after Ronny discovered their plan. He believed that the Sans underestimated their financial status, as his family's wealth was not widely known in Sanford. Despite his father's riches, they led a modest life, which kept them under the radar in town. Marjorie agreed, acknowledging the simple and contented life they led. She mentioned that most girls at Hamilton, including the Deans, were in similar financial circumstances. Many students owned cars, but Marjorie and Jerry didn't feel the need for one. After their morning routines, they planned to call the baggage master to ensure their trunks arrived on time.

A group of girls at Wayland Hall faced a dilemma when their request to keep their rooms was denied by Miss Remson, the manager. In response, she sought the president's intervention to address the situation. However, the president was away, so she wrote to him requesting a meeting upon his return. When they finally met, Miss Remson expressed her concerns, leading the president to promise disciplinary action against the girls causing trouble. Surprisingly, the president later suggested that Miss Remson resolve the issue internally, hinting at complaints against her. Feeling hurt and considering resignation, Miss Remson shared a letter from the girls pleading their case.

In the warm and welcoming atmosphere of Silverton Hall, Marjorie felt all her worries fade away. She briefly wished she had chosen to live there from the start, finding life much more pleasant. Thoughts of Miss Remson, the kind manager, made her realize how fond she had grown of her. Marjorie reflected on the friendships she had made at Wayland Hall, especially with Katherine, Leila, Vera, and Helen. Despite the challenges they faced, she wondered if there was a hidden purpose in their move to Wayland Hall. On Saturday, many freshmen arrived at Hamilton, with the Sans being surprisingly democratic in welcoming them.

Leslie Cairns is working hard to make Miss Walbert popular among the freshmen. Vera is convinced of this and believes that the Sans group is aiming to control the freshman class.

The four Lookouts were busy arranging their college affairs for the fall term. Having completed a year of college, they found it easier to focus on studying and enjoying college life. They appreciated the educational opportunities at Hamilton and excelled in their studies. Despite their commitment to getting to know the freshmen in their house, they faced obstacles from the Sans group who monopolized the freshmen. Silverton Hall also faced challenges due to limited vacancies, transitioning from a freshman to a sophomore house. Phyllis Moore, residing there, found seven pleasant freshmen with no snobbish attitudes. The Lookouts struggled to boost Phyllis for freshman presidency due to freshmen being scattered across different locations like Alston Terrace, Acasia House, and off-campus residences.

Marjorie and her friends were discussing the recent events at the Hall. They were concerned about the behavior of the Sans, who seemed arrogant and sure of themselves. The noisy entrance of Muriel, Jerry, Leila, Vera, and Ronny, with news of Phyllis losing the freshman presidency, disrupted their conversation. Jerry expressed her disapproval of the election results and predicted trouble ahead for the freshmen. Many upper-class students shared this sentiment, criticizing the Sans for their interference in freshman affairs. Despite the backlash, the Sans celebrated Elizabeth's victory with a lavish dinner arranged by Leslie Cairns. However, Leslie's joy was short-lived when she received a summons from Doctor Matthews, possibly related to Katherine Langly's recent accident. Leslie decided to ignore the letter momentarily, hoping for more information before facing the consequences.|"['1.

An interview with a certain person did not provide any answers. This person was unable to explain the reason for the summons. Two days later, Leslie got a stern second message that she couldn't ignore. Nervously, she went to the president's office and emerged an hour later, looking angry. Trying to act nonchalant, she was suddenly forced to respect Doctor Matthews' authority after receiving a lecture on reckless driving. The president warned that more accidents would lead to strict consequences. Leslie left with a determination to find out who reported her. She suspected Marjorie, Jerry, Leila, and Vera, as well as the freshmen in Harriet's car.

After reaching the veranda, I decided to enter the house. I assumed Miss Dean was there to see the doctor. As soon as I stepped inside, I heard voices coming from the slightly open office door. Not wanting to be caught, I quietly slipped into the living room across from the office. Although I couldn't make out what Miss Dean was saying, I heard the doctor expressing his anger towards someone's behavior. He mentioned taking the matter to the Board and hinted at consequences if the person didn't comply. Miss Dean mentioned innocents suffering with the guilty. Their conversation grew softer, and I quickly left as the doctor rose from his chair. As Miss Dean exited the house, Leslie expressed her disdain for the situation. Leslie planned to take action against the culprit. The doctor's behavior confirmed suspicions, and Leslie hinted at a plan to address the issue.|['1.

Laura advised caution when dealing with Miss Dean, as she was known to be popular on campus and independent. Phyllis Moore gracefully accepted defeat after her freshman supporters expressed displeasure over her loss in the election. Despite the Sans group's efforts to influence the freshmen, the class unity remained fragile. The picnic, attended by all members of the class, became tiresome for some due to the Sans' attempts to sway opinions. The rift caused by the electioneering hinted at future discord. Leslie felt relieved that the situation with Doctor Matthews and Miss Remson would likely be forgotten with time, easing her fears of expulsion from Hamilton.|"['1.

The selection of officers happened later than usual, causing anticipation for the upcoming freshman dance. The sophomores, free from snobbish behavior, invited the freshmen to the event. A few freshmen felt left out when the sophomores prioritized off-campus students. Despite this, the Sans group, led by Alida Burton and Lola Elster, stepped in to help. Marjorie enjoyed preparing for the dance, gathering decorations from the woods. The atmosphere during the preparations was cheerful and harmonious.

Encouraged by Leslie's teasing, the Sans decided to give their best effort during the try-out to show improvement. Only a few others tried out, giving them a good chance. Observing the director's methods at previous try-outs helped them understand what was expected. They also learned new things about basketball. The question remained whether they could apply this knowledge to their own game on short notice. After the junior try-out, Professor Leonard privately doubted extending basketball beyond the sophomore year. Despite this, he selected a team from the junior players, including Joan Myers, Natalie Weyman, Harriet Stephens, Miss Hale, and Nina Merrill.

The senior basketball try-outs were postponed until after Thanksgiving due to a lack of participants. While the freshmen eagerly practiced under Professor Leonard's guidance, the sophomores were less enthusiastic but still put in effort. The sophomores accepted a challenge from the freshmen and won a close game. Ready to give the freshmen a chance to redeem themselves, the sophomores challenged them again, but the game was postponed due to an illness. Meanwhile, the junior team, led by coach Milton Ramsey, practiced in secret to surprise the other teams. Leslie, the team captain, motivated her teammates with gifts and treats, promising them a break from basketball after beating the sophomores.

After the Christmas break, the campus houses were filled with joy and celebrations for a week. Jerry, feeling nostalgic but content, reflected on the abundance of fruit cakes, preserves, and chocolates after a feast in Leila's room. As they settled back into Hamilton, Jerry and Marjorie shared their mixed feelings about returning to college. Marjorie admitted to feeling homesick initially but found solace in the busy college life and challenging subjects. Meanwhile, Jerry expressed disdain for the junior basketball team's disregard for rules and their practices under Leslie Cairns' guidance. Despite the freshmen's defeat in a recent game against the sophomores, they graciously accepted the loss and issued a new challenge for a rematch in two weeks.|"[""1.

On the following Monday, a surprise awaited the freshman team. They were challenged by the junior team to a game on the upcoming Saturday. Despite not being overly excited about the challenge, they agreed to play. They believed they would easily win since they had almost tied with the sophomores previously. When Saturday arrived and the game began, the freshmen were confident of their victory. Many students had gathered to watch the game, curious about Leslie Cairns suddenly coaching the team. The juniors, coached by Leslie, displayed unexpected friendliness towards the freshmen before the game, which puzzled the freshmen. Throughout the game, the juniors continued their affable behavior, distracting the freshmen with soft remarks and affecting their performance. This interference, though subtle, was unfair and affected the freshmen's focus and gameplay.|"['1.

At halftime, the juniors were leading 12-8 in the game. Phyllis, the team captain, gathered her teammates in a small room. She explained that the opposing team, the three Sans, were using unfair tactics by distracting them with words instead of playing by the rules. Phyllis encouraged her team to focus on their game and not let the other team's behavior affect them. The players shared how the Sans had tried to disrupt their focus during the first half. Despite feeling frustrated, the team decided to maintain their dignity and not let the Sans' actions get to them.

Encouraged by their leader, the excited trio returned to the court ready for more fun. Following Leslie's advice, they stayed quiet for the first five minutes. Expecting teasing whispers, the freshmen were surprised by silence from their tormentors. The peace was short-lived as the teasing resumed, putting the freshmen on edge. Despite this, they managed to recover two lost points. However, fate turned against them when Janet Baird accidentally scored for the other team, leading to loud cheers and energized opponents. The juniors won 24-20. Feeling disheartened, the freshmen were comforted by the sophomores who planned to teach the juniors a lesson in fair play. Two juniors resigned due to the unfair tactics, leading to new players being appointed. The team prepared for a rematch with the sophomores after practice.|"[""1.

The Saturday after the intense game between the freshmen and juniors, the freshmen managed to tie the score against the sophomores. Fans praised it as a beautiful game, boosting the freshmen's spirits after their prior defeat. Meanwhile, the sophomores awaited the junior challenge composed entirely of Sans. Before the challenge, the St. Valentine masquerade, an annual junior dance on February fourteenth, took center stage. Students eagerly prepared for the event, with elaborate costumes for the chance to win prizes. Ronny suggested dressing as a French doll, Jerry planned to go as an infant, and Lucy reluctantly chose a schoolgirl costume. Marjorie hinted at a potential challenge looming, but they decided to focus on the dance first.|"[""1.

"""No, sir,"" said Ronny. ""Once the masquerade is done, we'll focus on preparing the juniors for winter. That might be our final game this year, unless the freshmen want more. Personally, I'm tired of playing. I don't plan to play next year.""

""Neither do I,"" Marjorie added. ""I enjoy the game, but it consumes too much spare time. I'll opt for long walks for exercise. I've never explored this area as much as I'd like.""

""I might join the prowlers' association,"" joked Ronny. ""Wouldn't it be fun to wander around Hamilton Arms? I passed by there recently. They say it's full of antiques. Miss Susanna Hamilton won't allow students on the lawn because of a disagreement with a Board member.""

""It's a shame she isolates herself,"" Marjorie reflected. ""She must be unhappy. Leila thinks she resembles an old robin. She's energetic, tends a rose garden, and knows so much about Brooke Hamilton, yet we'll never get to know her.""

As the masquerade approached, the Lookouts dedicated their free time to preparing their costumes. Ronny fixed a broken butterfly wing, while Marjorie, Lucy, and Jerry worked on altering their outfits. Jerry, in particular, painstakingly completed an infant dress she had been sewing for over two weeks. ""After the masquerade, I'm done with baby clothes,"" she declared"|"[""1.

On the day before the school dance, the sophomore team received a challenge from the juniors to play a match on the twenty-seventh of February. Instead of replying immediately, they decided to keep their opponents waiting in suspense. Robin Page, one of the team members, expressed her disdain for the juniors and suggested making them wait until after the dance to respond. The evening of the St. Valentine masquerade was always a festive event on campus, starting with dinner at five-thirty. Masked students could be seen parading around by seven o'clock, and the grand march began at eight. Unmasking occurred at half-past nine, and the dance continued joyfully until midnight. Marjorie, hurrying from her last class, found a letter from her mother and another mysterious one from a fellow student, Miss Towne, requesting her presence at 852 for advice and support in a time of need. Despite the inconvenience, Marjorie decided to help her friend at the specified time of half-past seven.|"['1.

Marjorie's spirits lifted as she found hope in the situation with Anna. She believed Anna was innocent and faced a financial challenge. Determined to help, Marjorie decided to inform her friends, the Lookouts, for assistance. Jerry, however, was displeased with the news, feeling Anna should have waited. Marjorie, understanding the gravity of Anna's situation, resolved to go to her aid before the masquerade event. With a quick plan in place, Marjorie hurried to get ready, leaving Jerry to ponder the note. Despite Jerry's concerns, the group rushed through dinner to don their costumes for the masquerade. Eager to showcase their outfits under the starry night sky, they paraded around the campus. Marjorie, unfazed by the dark, solitary walk, disguised herself to avoid attention from other revelers. This was a common practice during the festive night, where even faculty members were playfully accosted by masked students.|"[""1.

Marjorie walked along the row of houses, searching for Miss Towne's residence. After finding the house number with her small pocket flashlight, she arrived at 852. Pausing at the bottom step of the veranda, she felt a sense of sadness looking at the house. The windows were dark except for a faint light in one room. As she rang the doorbell, a tall figure in black robes greeted her and pulled her inside abruptly, turning off the hall light. Marjorie was pushed into a room where masked figures in black dominos awaited. One figure in a scarlet domino and a frightening mask seemed to be in charge. Despite initial fear, Marjorie realized she was being pranked by students and decided to remain composed and indifferent for the moment.|"[""1.

The day after the masquerade, the sophomore team surprised the junior team by accepting their challenge, leaving the Sans five bewildered.

When the evening of May Day arrived and the first faint stars appeared, Marjorie grabbed her basket of violets and swiftly vanished. Clad in a simple blue coat and a dark sports hat pulled low over her curls, she hurried across the campus and out to the highway. Concealing her flower gift under a black silk scarf, she sped along the road towards Hamilton Estates, keeping a safe distance from passing cars. As she approached the gates of Hamilton Arms, she breathed a sigh of relief to find them open, unlike during the day when they were usually slightly ajar. Despite a moment of hesitation, she pushed on, giggling with delight at her secret adventure. Her heart raced as she reached the front veranda and knocked on the door, then dashed away, feeling flushed and victorious. Later, back in her room, Marjorie was stunned to find a banner and a plethora of May baskets from her friends, realizing the extent of their surprise for her.|"['1.
