In this guide, you'll find examples of behaviors you should avoid. Children like Marmaduke Argyll, who talks with his mouth full, or Nancy Beal, who throws things around, are not setting good examples. Selfishness, like that shown by Bildad, or being in the way like Percy Bingg, is not ideal. Levi Boing is careless, Coralie always has wet feet, and Andrew Crossett plays with water. Annabella Day is slow to obey. Remember, don't be like these children. Behave well every day. Let's learn from these examples and strive to be better individuals.|['1.

"Young Amelia Pratt adamantly refuses, ""I won't! I won't do this or that!"" Isn't ""won't"" the naughtiest word heard?

Annie Fanny Ruffle Riff, always sniffling and snuffling, a Goop who rarely blows her nose. Felicia Ropps, constantly touching things in shops she shouldn't. Percival B. Sloop, a most unpleasant Goop, picking his nose and wiping his hands on clothes. Susie Smalt blames others, never owning up to faults. Sperry Sprooks spoils books, and Uriah Stead always delays bedtime. Let's not be like these Goops!"|"[""1. What is Young Amelia Pratt's attitude towards doing certain things?\nA. She is excited\nB.
