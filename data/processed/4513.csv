As I near the end of my days, reflecting on all I've learned, I realize the vast knowledge I've acquired. From practical skills like salting butter to deeper insights on human nature, these are the treasures I fear will be lost when I'm gone. While some things can be written down, like recipes or remedies, the true essence of knowledge lies in the everyday experiences that can't be captured on paper. Understanding the weather by observing the sky, predicting a sick person's fate, or comforting a troubled soul are invaluable skills that can't be taught in books. As I ponder the purpose of my daily chores, I wonder if God intended for us to continually strive for cleanliness and order, or if there's a greater lesson hidden within the mundane tasks that fill our days.|"['1.

You needn't pray for me, old lady, I don't want no one's prayer. I'm fit and jolly as ever I was--you needn't think I care. When I go whistling down the road, when the warm night is falling, She needn't think I'm whistling her, it's another girl I'm calling. If I pass her house a dozen times, or fifty times a day, She needn't think I think of her, my work lies out that way. If they should tell her I've grown thin (for that is what they've told me) This cursed weather counts for that, and not the girl who sold me. And if they say I'm off my feed I still can tip a can; If I get drunk what's that to her? I am not her young man. I know I've had a lucky let-off--she ain't no class, she ain't, For all she looked like a bush o' roses and talked like a story book saint. I never give a thought to her. Don't worry your old head, I've quite forgot her pretty ways and the cruel things she said, There's lots of other gals to be had as any chap can see, So you cheer up, you've got no call to go and pray for me.

My lovely beech tree, your smooth grey bark is etched with letters that once symbolized love.

Oh, sweet Spring, my days slip away, Yearning for your touch, Time's dance above, In your hands, the world's heart sway, Oh, move one heart to love. Bring me a lover, teach me how, Through days and days, love's seed lay low, We tread the weary path somehow, Where no leaf or bloom dares grow. In shadows deep, the seed unfurled, We journeyed miles, weary and worn, To the maze's heart, the hidden world, Twin leaves breaking, love reborn. Goddess of my shrine divine, Where my candles flicker and burn, What will you grant, what's in your design? A smile, a word, a fleeting turn? Just once, be my altar's light, Before you sleep, remember me, In joy, in grief, in day, in night, Let your thoughts, like flowers, set me free. In the South, flowers bloom so bright, A jewel sky, a golden sea, But from the North, a chilling blight, That carries my love to me. Stars of gold, like lamps they gleam, Flowers in forests, stars between, Yet the moon's pale light, my love's dream, To light my love, unseen. Love and I, if left alone, Could weave garlands, forget to grieve, But you watch, your eyes like stone, Mocking, I can't believe. Let me search, weave a wreath for|"[""1.

Fields of brown upland under the setting sun, with golden wheat and copper earth freshly plowed, meadows where white sheep roam, small gardens blooming, roads leading home through twilight. Lanes lined with hawthorn, dykes trembling with sedges, hollows where winds sleep and moorlands where they're free, sowing, reaping, springs, rivers. Each corner of land, cliffs, waves, trees, roads, farms, dear as cradles and graves. The orchards, clouds, homesteads, farms, dear as lifeblood. England, desire of hearts, delight of eyes!

Soft lamplight on pictures, books, wisdom, age, yet longing for youth. Summer in the garden, flowers, birds, rain, and love. Joyful birds in gardens, orchards, woodlands, singing in the rain. Dreams of palaces, innocence, joy, and sorrow, love guarding always.|"['1.

The fairies worked while you slept, bringing laughter to where the rain wept. They taught beauty to the flowers and gave hope to weary plants. At dawn, I saw their goodness, their beauty. The red fairy adorned the garden with poppies and roses. The golden fairy lit tulips and hollyhocks. The white fairy made pale buds blossom and adorned the jasmine with silver stars.

When I was young, the skies were fair and filled with wispy clouds and deep blue hues. Life seemed like a toy to play with, full of charm and adventure. But as time passed, the dew of morning dried up, leaving only dust in the cup of life. Seeking a fresh start, I found solace at the Goat and Vine, a place where brandy, beer, and wine mingled.
