"This small book is a collection of essays that were previously published in the ""American Naturalist."" The aim is to help readers learn more about the behaviors and shapes of common insects. The introductory section and Chapter XIII, ""Hints on the Ancestry of Insects,"" were specifically written for this book. The chapter on insect ancestry may captivate scientific readers more than any other part. The text explores the theory of evolution and how it can be applied to test different classification systems. Defining what an insect is can be challenging due to the vast number of species, but they all share a similar body structure. Insects have segmented bodies with a head, thorax, and abdomen. The head includes antennae, jaws, and maxillae, while the abdomen houses the ovipositor. Insects breathe through tiny holes along their bodies, allowing air to reach all parts through a network of air tubes."|['1.

Insects and horses may both be animals, but their eating habits are vastly different. Insects have jaws that move horizontally to tear food, unlike horses that move their jaws up and down. Insects have complex mouthparts, including true jaws, accessory jaws, and feelers that help them detect food by touch and smell. The jaws of insects are toothed and variously shaped to tear and crush food. Insects consume large quantities of food when young, like the American Silk-worm, which can eat food equal to eighty-six thousand times its weight in just fifty-six days. Insects have a simple stomach and some, like grasshoppers, have a gizzard to crush food finely. Insects walk using their strong muscles, with some insects having over a thousand muscles for locomotion. Insects like flies can walk upside down due to their specialized foot structure with holding hairs that help them stick to surfaces, aided by atmospheric pressure.|['1.

The flight of insects and birds is a fascinating subject. The way a hawk or turkey buzzard can soar without moving its wings is a marvel. Similarly, the flight of a butterfly showcases grace and ease combined with strength. Insects have a unique structure with chitinous sacs and membranous wings powered by strong flight muscles. These creatures have air sacs that reduce their body weight, allowing them to fly effortlessly. Birds, on the other hand, have external soft parts attached to a bony framework, enabling them to fly efficiently. The trajectory of an insect's flight differs from that of a bird, with distinct wing movements and air resistance patterns. Understanding these differences helps us appreciate the poetry of motion displayed by these fascinating creatures.|['1.

The inner section of a fly's wing is passive, while the outer part that hits the air is active. A fly's wing completes 330 rotations per second, leading to 660 simple movements. The insect's flight utilizes only a fraction of the air's resistance. Birds, on the other hand, use the resistance to produce both vertical and horizontal components, allowing them to be more efficient in flight compared to insects. The eyes of insects are made up of numerous simple eyes, with each facet having a nerve connected to the brain. Insects rely heavily on their sense of touch, with delicate tactile organs on their bodies. Some believe that insects' antennae serve as organs for hearing and smell. Research suggests that insects have compound ears and noses scattered throughout their bodies, unlike humans and animals where ears and noses are fixed in specific locations.|"[""1.

"**The Growth of Insects**

In the world of insects, the journey from larva to butterfly is a fascinating transformation. The caterpillar, known as the larva, starts its life as a voracious eater, only to later find a quiet spot to transform into a chrysalis. The chrysalis, adorned with golden and silvery spots, hangs suspended until the butterfly emerges. The butterfly, with wet wings, dries and expands them before taking flight. This process showcases the beauty and wonder of nature.

The Honey bee, a marvel in itself, has captivated observers for centuries. The intricate life of the bees, from the queen laying eggs to the construction of hexagonal cells, is a subject of deep study. The division of bees into social and solitary species adds another layer of complexity to their fascinating world. The life of the Honey bee, with its queen, workers, and drones, is a well-orchestrated symphony of nature. Even in the tropics, where different species like Meliponas and Trigonas thrive, the art of bee-keeping continues to amaze with its diversity and ingenuity."|['1.

In a nest of the coal-black Trigona from eastern Australia, Mr. F. Smith found hundreds of dead workers but no females. The combs were like those of common wasps, with 250 honey-pots at the nest's base. Mr. Smith suggests that Trigona hives have multiple fertile females to explain the large number of workers. Similarly, M. Guérin discovered six females in a Tawny-footed Melipona nest. The economy of the Humble bee begins in early spring when the queen awakens and selects a nesting place. She lays eggs in a pollen mass, gradually adding more eggs as food is collected. Larvae eat the pollen, creating cavities, then spin silken walls and develop into pupae. Workers, small females, males, and queens emerge. The nest grows as the queen remains prolific, producing more workers until late summer when large females and males are born, with queens being impregnated before winter. Parasites like Apathus, similar to Humble bees, are found in their nests and feed on their host's provisions.|"[""1. What did Mr. F.

Various moths' caterpillars, two-winged flies like Volucella and Conops, and larvae of a fly resembling Anthomyia or Tachina, along with different beetles such as Meloë and Stylops, prey on honey and wax cells. The Virginian Carpenter bee excels in boring symmetrical tunnels in solid wood, with some exotic species even larger than the Humble bee. These bees follow the wood grain to create tunnels up to one and a half feet long, using wood raspings and saliva to construct cells. Other bees and wasps may take over these tunnels. The Xylocopa bees remain near the tunnel entrance, fanning air into it and sometimes sharing tunnels. The bee larvae feed on the young bee's juices by burying their heads in its body.|"[""1.

The bee's burrow is divided into small cells, each about seven-tenths of an inch long. The partitions inside are made of the dust and chips the bee creates while digging. This hardworking bee has strong jaws and brushes on her legs to clean out the tunnel. She uses her hind legs to carry the wood chips out of the cell. The partitions are made of layers of chips rolled into a coil. The bee smoothes the bottom of the cell and leaves the top rough. The larvae inside feed on pollen, and the cells are beautifully built with delicate silk walls. The bee, called Ceratina, tunnels into shrub stems to create her cells, making them just wide enough for her body. Each cell is about four and a half tenths of an inch long and a bit over one-third as broad. The life cycle of this bee involves laying eggs in pollen-filled cells, going through egg, larva, and chrysalis stages, and finally emerging as an adult bee.|"[""1.

"The young of bees face dangers even in their supposed safe havens. Ichneumon flies, including the Anthophorabia species, lay eggs inside bee larvae, emerging as parasites. The Leaf-cutter bee, also known as Megachile, is a robust insect with unique habits. They lay eggs in burrows in elder stems and locust tree hollows. The female Leaf-cutter bee meticulously constructs cells using leaf pieces she cuts with her scissors-like jaws. Each cell is then stocked with pollen and an egg. The larva spins a cocoon inside the cell, emerging as a bee later. Mason bees, like the Osmia species, have diverse nesting habits, choosing plant stems, rotten posts, or snail shells. Curtis discovered a British Osmia species that lived for three years before maturity, with three successive broods. This phenomenon contributes to ""insect years,"" where bees and wasps thrive in abundance."|['1.

In 1864, Mr. G. R. Waterhouse observed the fascinating behavior of Osmia leucomelana bees. These bees construct their cells from mud, forming each cell separately. The female bee starts by depositing a small mud pellet in a sheltered spot and then begins to excavate a cavity in its upper surface using her jaws. The result is a rough outer surface and a smooth inner surface mud-cup. The lid of the cell is concave on the outer surface and convex on the inner. The largest species, O. lignivora, tunnels elaborate burrows inside maple trees. The bee intelligently constructs cells, each half an inch long and somewhat jug-shaped. The material is silken and parchment-like. The bees emerge from the cells in March after living on honey and water. The bees exhibit impressive instincts and limited reasoning abilities, showcasing their role in nature's plan.|"['1.

Mr. Angus shared observations about the Wandering Humble bee, noting the males near a garden fence. He described them fanning at a hole, creating a buzzing sound. The males were active, some resting while others flew around. The workers appeared similar in size to the males. The fanning activity seemed aimed at introducing air into the nest, akin to Honey bees. Additionally, a description of Xylocopa bee behavior was provided, detailing the dimensions of a tunnel and the presence of larvae and pollen in cells. The Xylocopa bee was observed bobbing at the hole, potentially interacting with others inside. The passage also discussed Andrena and Halictus bees, highlighting their burrowing habits and lack of social organization compared to Hive and Humble bees. These bees exhibit industrious digging behavior in spring to create nests underground.|['1.

The natural size nest of Andrena vicina is a fascinating sight, with the main burrow and cells leading from it clearly visible. The oldest cell containing the pupa is closest to the surface, while the cells with the larva lie in between the pupa and the cell containing the pollen mass and egg. The most recent cell is the deepest and holds a freshly deposited pollen mass. The bees were observed digging their holes in early May, with mounds of earth hardly noticeable. By mid-May, hundreds of Andrena holes were found in the pasture. The bees gather pollen, kneading it into pellet-like masses to feed their larvae. The bees return to their cells laden with pollen, elaborating it into bee bread within. On a rainy day, the bees seek shelter in their holes. By late July, the larvae transform into pupae, with some cells also housing pupae of Cuckoo bees. In August, fully formed bees and pupae were found in unearthed burrows.|"['1.

On the final day of August, only a few holes were open. Some Oil beetles and small black Ichneumon flies were wandering near the holes. The burrow goes straight down, with short paths leading to cells that are slightly slanted downwards and outwards from the main tunnel. The gallery walls are rough, but the cells are lined with a sticky substance that hardens, resembling glazed pottery. The size of the cell is like an acorn, with a thin layer of dirt sticking to it. The larva of Andrena is soft, with a flattened body bulging at the sides and tapering towards each end. The skin is thin, showing the pulsating heart along the back. The pupa, or chrysalis, lies in a compact position in its cell. The stages between larva and pupa are gradual, involving changes in tissues. The pupa state lasts around three to four weeks, with the larva transforming into bees by the end of August.|['1.

On July 16th, a search was conducted revealing over twenty cells dug out in the ground. The upper cells contained nearly mature pupae, while the lower ones housed larvae of varying sizes. The smallest larvae were barely visible to the naked eye and were found in individual cells on lumps of pollen, diminishing in size as the larvae grew. These young bees were likely offspring from multiple females, as four mature bees were discovered in the hole. The larva of an English species hatches ten days after the eggs are laid. Another brood of bees emerged in mid-September, found in holes of the same species on a hard gravel road. Parasitic bees were also observed in nests of Andrena and Halictus, living off their hosts. This parasitism does not usually lead to the death of the host bee.|['1.

The study of animal parasites has recently attracted much interest among scientists. Bees, both domestic and wild, provide fascinating examples of the unique relationship between hosts and parasites living on them. Insects have various ways of parasitizing other insects. Some species consume the contents of the victim's egg, while others attack the insect during different stages of its life cycle - as a larva, pupa, or adult. For instance, the Ichneumon flies and Tachina species are common insect parasites that live inside their hosts, consuming their fatty tissues. The Phora fly is a small insect that lays its eggs on bee larvae, leading to the death of the host bee due to the parasite's consumption of its fatty tissues. This parasitic relationship can cause diseases like foul-brood in beehives.|"['1.

Some insects that parasitize bees have fascinating life cycles. One such insect is the Braula fly, which is like a miniature flea. It feeds on bee blood by piercing them with its beak. Another parasite is the Trichodes apiarius beetle, which attacks young bees. The Oil beetle, Meloë angusticollis, preys on bees too. It lays eggs near bee hibernation spots, and the hatched larvae feed on bee bodies. The larvae undergo a peculiar hyper-metamorphosis, passing through multiple stages before becoming beetles. This process involves unique larval forms, a pseudo-chrysalis, and a true pupa stage. These parasites can be harmful to bee colonies, so beekeepers need to be vigilant in monitoring and managing these intruders to protect their bees.|"[""1.

Fabre, a renowned entomologist, detailed the intriguing life cycle of the Sitaris beetle, a European insect similar to the Meloë. The female Sitaris lays its eggs near bee nests, waiting for the perfect moment when a bee lays its egg. At that instant, the Sitaris larva drops from the bee's body, feasting on the freshly laid bee egg. After this meal, it consumes the bee's honey and transforms into a footless grub. Once fully fed, it enters a pupa state, encasing itself in a hard skin. Within this skin, a whitish larva develops into the true pupa. Eventually, the pupa emerges as a beetle, belonging to the same group as the Meloë beetle. Similarly, the Stylops beetle, related to Meloë, has a peculiar life cycle where the female lives inside a bee, giving birth to numerous offspring. These parasites exhaust their hosts, leading to premature death. Additionally, bees can also suffer from parasitic worms like the Gordius, which infest their bodies, causing disease.|"['1.

Many insects are affected by parasitic fungi each year. The Muscardine, caused by a tiny fungus called Botrytris Bassiana, has even endangered silk production in Europe. Another serious disease, pebrine, is believed to have originated from plants. Dr. Leidy mentions a fungus that annually eliminates numerous Seventeen Year Locusts. Similarly, a fungus called Mucor mellitophorus infects bees by filling their stomachs with tiny colorless spores, weakening the insects. Other insects also prey on bees, such as different bee species, moths, flies, and beetles. Insect parasites often resemble their hosts, like Apathus, which lives in Humble bee cells. Conops and Volucella are examples that live inside bees' bodies or devour their offspring. These interactions illustrate the complex nature of insect parasitism.|['1.

To collect butterflies and moths for display, you need a net and a bottle with cyanide to preserve them. Once dead, pin them in a box. Caterpillars are preserved in spirits or glycerine. Insects are beneficial; they control plant growth and pollinate, aiding in fruit production. Insects like bees boost fruit crops. Many insects are scavengers or prey on harmful species. Insects can also cause significant crop damage. In Europe, entomology is well-studied. In the US, wheat crops have been impacted by pests like the wheat midge, affecting agricultural regions. Insects like the imported cabbage butterfly and Hessian fly have caused extensive damage to crops. Understanding insects is crucial for protecting crops from destruction.|['1.

Insects that harm crops cause significant damage. Each type of plant has its own set of insects that attack it year after year. For example, there are about fifty types of insects that harm cereals and grass, thirty that target garden vegetables, fifty that infest grapevines, seventy-five that attack apple trees, and many more that prey on various fruit trees. The total annual loss due to these pests in the United States alone is estimated to be around five hundred million dollars, with the potential to save fifty million dollars through preventive measures. Farmers and gardeners should work together to combat these pests, possibly through legislation that mandates cooperative efforts to control harmful insects.

Silk production is gaining importance in California, with the American silk worm, Teleas Polyphemus, showing promise for profitability. This moth, similar to the Chinese Attacus Atlas, has a fawn-colored appearance and a strong, glossy silk fiber. Despite challenges like the pebrine disease, silk cultivation can be successful with proper precautions. Another valuable silk worm is the Ailanthus silk worm, known for its strong silk fiber, though it poses challenges during the unreeling process. The Yama-maï moth from Japan and the Perny silk worm from China also contribute to the silk industry. Diseases like pebrine, caused by harmful microorganisms, threaten silk worm populations.

In France, a severe disease threatened the silk industry until scientists like Pasteur intervened. By studying infected eggs, Pasteur discovered a way to save the silk culture. Meanwhile, a tiny clothes moth caterpillar, armed with scissor-like jaws, weaves a unique silk-lined case for protection. As it grows, the caterpillar expands its case by cleverly patching and mending it. Even when parts of the case are cut off, the caterpillar repairs it from the inside, showcasing its resilience and adaptability. This process of construction and repair keeps the caterpillar occupied during the cold winter months. Through these examples, we see the importance of observation, adaptation, and perseverance in both scientific investigations and the survival strategies of creatures like the clothes moth caterpillar.|"['1.

Flies, like mosquitoes, undergo growth in their larva and pupa stages. Once they develop wings, they do not grow any further. Small midges are not young mosquitoes but adult forms of different fly species. The larva of the Ocean gnat, living along the New England coast, transforms into a mosquito-like fly. Similarly, other gnats have been found in Northern lakes. The Black fly, a significant pest, hinders travel in subarctic regions. It swarms in immense numbers during warm days, making outdoor activities challenging. Unlike mosquitoes, Black flies disappear in cloudy weather. Their bites can be severe, leaving behind blood clots. The Buffalo Gnat, known for biting horses, and the Simulium molestum, or Black fly, are part of this group of troublesome insects.|['1.

"Countless long, thin, white worms are often discovered dwelling in the soil, with sour sap leaking from wounds in the elm tree. A couple of summers back, we stumbled upon some of these larvae, and upon raising them, we identified them as a type of Mycetobia. The larvae have their abdominal segments split into two parts, with the rear portion smaller than the front. They measure just over a third of an inch in length. Pupae were spotted protruding from the tree, anchored by tiny spines at the tail. The larvae infested the tree for six weeks before flies emerged, resembling gnats and about a line long. These larvae, which can be harmful to horses, are beneficial in their larval stage, feeding on animal and decaying matter. Horse flies, like the ""Green head"" species, are known for their painful bites, causing distress to horses and cattle. These flies are prevalent in marshes and prairies during summer, with various species found in North America. The mouthparts of the Horse fly are adapted for piercing flesh, similar to mosquitoes, and only the females bite. The Timb or Tsetze fly, part of this fly group, is known to plague and poison cattle in certain African regions.

The larva of the Microdon globosus is a fascinating find for collectors of shells or insects due to its almost spherical shape. This larva is flat and smooth underneath, making it appear as if it sticks to the underside of stones, often mistaken for a snail. The Syrphus fly, also known as the Aphis eater, is remarkable for its maggot that feeds on plant lice by using its long front body part. The adult Syrphus fly is brightly colored with yellow spots and bands, resembling a wasp, and can be found near flowers. Another interesting fly is the Eristalis, with its unique rat-tailed pupa-case that lives in water and extends a long respiratory tube for air. The Merodon Bardus fly, similar to Eristalis, also has a pupa-case without a respiratory tube but with a short, truncated tube.

In Central and South America, there are documented cases of a bot fly species that can live in the human body, causing painful lumps under the skin on the arms, legs, and abdomen. It is debated whether this human bot fly is a true parasite or an accidental one, with the prevailing belief being that its usual host is monkeys or dogs. In different regions, this repulsive larva is known as Ver macaque in Cayenne, Ura in Para, Torcel in Costa Rica, and Gusano peludo or Nuche in New Granada. The bot fly of horses, Gastrophilus equi, lays eggs on the horse's knees, which are then ingested and develop into larvae in the stomach. The larvae mature until October, then attach themselves to the horse's rectum until they are excreted. Hypoderma bovis is the bot fly of cattle, living in back tumors during May and the summer, emerging as flies from May to September. The larva of the sheep bot fly, Oestrus ovis, lives in the sheep's frontal sinus and nasal cavity, falling to the ground when mature, pupating quickly, and emerging as flies in the summer. Cuterebra buccata resembles the ox bot fly larva and infests animals like opossums, squirrels, and hares.

House flies are most abundant near barns in late summer and early fall. Their life cycle begins in stable manure. The larva is cylindrical, smooth, and yellowish white, while the pupa-case is dark reddish-brown. The larva of the flesh fly is conical, with a pointed head. Some flies hibernate in winter and reappear in spring. The Apple midge damages apples post-harvest, with larva penetrating the fruit. Another apple worm attacks early apple varieties, making them unfit for consumption. The larva of these pests can be found in barrels in winter, with flies emerging in spring. These insects are beneficial as they prey on harmful caterpillars. Some smaller flies create blister-like swellings on willow bark and mine leaves.|['1.

Allied flies like the cheese maggot and the Wine fly have interesting lives. The cheese maggot's parent, the black fly with metallic green reflections, lays its eggs in cheese. The Wine fly, another type of Piophila, loves old wine casks and beer bottles. Moving on to parasitic flies, the Bird tick lives on Great Horned Owls, while the Horse tick prefers horses, causing irritation and pain. The wingless Sheep tick is hairy, with a long proboscis, and its young develop inside the parent's body. Bat ticks infest bats, and they look spider-like with small bodies and long legs. The Flea, possibly a degraded fly, resembles grasshoppers and cockroaches. These unique flies have fascinating lives and adaptations.|['1.

Dr. G. A. Perkins from Salem has successfully raised numerous flea larvae from eggs. When hatched, the larvae are about half a line long, with a long white body having thirteen segments. They feed on blood clots and live in unswept areas like floors of out-houses or animal bedding. It takes about six days for the larvae to appear after the eggs are laid, and they mature in a few days, spin cocoons, change to pupae, and become adult fleas in around ten days. A practical tip to get rid of fleas on dogs includes cleaning their kennels frequently and using chips as bedding. Infested dogs can be washed every few days with strong soapsuds or weak tobacco or petroleum water. The Persian Insect Destroyer is recommended for dogs, and cleanliness and wearing shoes are suggested to prevent infestation by the Sarcopsylla penetrans, also known as the Jigger or Chigoe.|['1.

"In his book ""Injurious Insects,"" Dr. Harris describes the destructive impact of the Three-toothed Compsidea beetle on elm trees. These beetles, with their distinctive features like a rusty red line behind the eyes and three-toothed stripes on their wings, cause severe damage by perforating the bark, leading to disease and decay. The larva of the beetle is white, subcylindrical, and has a large head. It differs from other borers like the Linden tree borer in body structure and head size. The Linden tree borer, greenish-yellow with black spots, feeds on tree twigs and leaves, depositing eggs on trunks and branches. The hatched grubs tunnel under the bark, causing extensive damage.

In 1844, Dr. Swift noted the infestation of trees in Washington and Independence Squares by beetles. The European lindens were decimated, leaving only a few American lindens. Another beetle species, Saperda calcarata, attacks Poplar trees. This larger beetle is grey, striped, and about an inch long. The larvae of these beetles destroy trees by boring into trunks. The Saperda inornata beetle, smaller at nine-twentieths of an inch, is also a borer. The Locust and Hickory borer has devastated locust trees in New England. Despite the unpleasant topic of parasites, studying them has advanced our understanding of life and its origins. Animal parasites offer insights into life's mysteries, such as the origins of species and the complexities of evolution.|['1.

The study of lice, despite its seemingly unglamorous nature, is crucial for understanding insect classification and morphology. By examining parasitic species like lice, we gain insights into the embryology and post-egg changes of various insects. For instance, Hymenoptera species like Proctotrupids and Chalcids, moth species like canker-worm moth and Orgyla, and other wingless flies provide valuable information. Lice, belonging to the families Pediculi and Mallophaga, are considered part of the Hemiptera group. Contrary to popular belief, lice do not bite but have mouth parts adapted for suction. Danish entomologist Schiödte debunked the myth of lice causing phthiriasis, a disease attributed to them throughout history. Understanding the intricate mouth structure of lice sheds light on their parasitic nature and survival mechanisms.|"['1.

Under a strong microscope, specimens treated with weakened potash reveal that the mandibles and maxillæ originate close to each other in the center of the head, across from the eyes, with their bases slightly moving apart. From there, they converge towards the mouth, where they meet and then extend freely, forming thin chitinous bands that come together like the maxillæ or tongue of butterflies, creating a hollow tube for sucking. The mandibles each culminate in a curved, slender filament, potentially used as a tactile organ to locate the best spots in the victim's flesh for blood extraction. On the contrary, the maxillæ, narrower than the mandibles, taper towards the end, bristle-like, and are tipped with numerous extremely fine barbs that anchor the bug in the flesh while blood is drawn through the mandibles. The base of the large, tubular labium, or beak, which encloses the mandibles and maxillæ, is opposite the clypeus or upper side of the head's front edge, at a distance from the mouth equal to the labium's width. The labium, divided into three joints, flattens towards the square tip, ending in two thin membranous lobes, likely possessing a slight sense of touch. Comparing these parts to those of the louse, they bear a striking resemblance except for the labium, an organ with significant variation in Hemiptera. From the lengthy sucker of the Pedic|['1.

The remaining parasites are part of the skin-biting lice group, known as Mallophaga. Let's start with the highest-ranked genus, which is most similar to Pediculus. The common barn-yard fowl has a louse species called Goniocotes Burnettii, named after the late Dr. W. I. Burnett, a dedicated naturalist. This louse differs from its European counterpart, G. hologaster, by having a shorter second antennae joint and a longer, more pointed clypeus. Moving on, the duck is infested by a slender louse species, Philopterus squalidus. A cat's louse and a goat's louse, both from the genus Trichodes, are also present. The Guinea pig harbors Gyropus ovalis, while Gyropus species are found on porpoises. The genus Goniodes, specifically G. stylifer, the turkey louse, is intriguing due to the unique morphological features of the male's antennae, resembling a hand with a claw-like structure. This peculiar adaptation aids in mating and possibly clinging to feathers. Such adaptations showcase the diverse evolutionary paths insects take, hinting at the origin of new species.|['1.

During the summer months of July and August, Dragonflies, specifically the species Libellula, are most abundant. These dragonflies lay their eggs by attaching them in loose clusters to the stems of plants that grow in water. The process of laying eggs involves the female dragonfly alighting on water-plants and submerging her body slightly to glue a bunch of eggs to the plant's stem or leaf. The eggs of these dragonflies are usually bright apple-green in color. The larvae that hatch from these eggs are very active, equipped with six legs, and small wing-pads on their thorax. The larva also possesses a unique mask-like structure that conceals its face but unfolds to reveal sharp hooks for catching prey. Furthermore, the larva has a syringe-like mechanism that propels it forward by expelling water behind it, aiding in both movement and respiration.|['1.

Dragonflies go through fascinating transformations, observable in aquaria. Agrion, for instance, has tracheary leaves acting as false-gills, aiding in swimming. These leaves absorb air for the tracheae, not for blood aeration. Little is known about their habits, making observation valuable. Differentiating Libellula and Æschna larvae is possible by the former's shorter, hairier form. Pupa, like Cordulia lateralis, have larger wing-pads, becoming gourmands before emerging as adults. During emergence, the pupa climbs a plant, shedding its skin to reveal a soft body that hardens. The adult dragonfly emerges, initially torpid, with wings drying to reveal vibrant colors. Devil's Darning-needles, like Eschna heros and grandis, are large and colorful, often causing alarm when entering homes.|"['1.

Few naturalists have focused on studying mites, with only a handful contributing to scientific journals. Mites, part of the Arachnid order, have a rounded oval body without the usual head-thorax and abdomen division found in spiders. They possess four pairs of legs and specialized mouthparts for feeding. While some mites are parasitic, others feed on insect eggs or act as beneficial scavengers. The transformation of mites from young to adult is remarkable, with some forms exhibiting significant differences. For instance, the larva of the European mite Typhlodromus pyri has only two pairs of legs and a worm-like appearance.

"Here is a refined passage for middle school students:

The fascinating world of mites holds many surprises. Some mite species exhibit parthenogenesis, where females lay eggs without males. These tiny creatures can suddenly swarm in large numbers, causing annoyance. For example, the Cheyletus seminivorus mite can harm cabbage seeds by sucking them dry. Another mite, resembling the Acaropsis Mericourti, was found in New Orleans and is thought to have been extracted from a human face. Additionally, a mite similar to Gamasus was discovered living in a steer's ear. The most complex mite, akin to spiders, is the red garden mite like Trombidium. In the larval stage, the Leptus Americanus mite is brick red and causes intense irritation by staying just under the skin.

The second species, known as Leptus? irritans, is a tiny but troublesome mite that causes intense itching and swelling, especially around the legs and ankles. These microscopic Harvest-mites, with their enormous maxillae, can bury themselves in the skin, causing red swellings and watery pustules. If scratched out early, the irritation heals quickly, but if left, it can last for days. These pests, unlike the Jigger, do not lay eggs in wounds but feed on blood, leading to discomfort for their hosts. Another similar mite, Astoma? muscarum, is a parasite of flies. The water mites, such as Hydrachna, are seen in freshwater habitats and live as parasites on water insects.

The labium in Lepisma is similar to that of Perla, broad and short with a clear median suture indicating its past division in early life into a pair of appendages. The labial palpi have three joints, broad, and in life, point backward instead of forward like in higher insects. There are five American species of Lepisma in the Peabody Academy Museum. Apart from the common L. saccharina, there are four undescribed species. One is found in out-houses and cellars, and a heat-loving form, possibly an imported species, discovered in a kitchen in Salem, related to L. thermophila Lucas from houses in Brest, France. Two other allied forms, one from Key West and another from Polvon, Western Nicaragua, collected by Mr. McNiel.

Haliday noted the opinions of Linnæus and Schrank on Campodea, linking it to the Podura genus. He suggested Campodea was an intermediate link between Podura and Lepisma. The mouth-parts of Campodea are rudimentary and retract into the head, resembling Poduridæ mouth-parts. The Podurelles and Collembola groups were studied by Nicolet and Lubbock. Lubbock found differences between Lepismidæ and Poduridæ, proposing the term Collembola for the Podura group. Various experts like Lamarck, Gervais, and Professor Dana had differing views on the classification of these insects. The Poduridæ are commonly found in damp places like under stones, wet chips, or in cellars. They thrive in moist and shaded environments, laying eggs mostly in spring and autumn. Their body varies in size and shape across different genera, with distinct head features and simple eyes on top behind the antennae.|['1.

Studying the mouth-parts of insects can be challenging, but by soaking them in potash for 24 hours to make their bodies transparent, we can observe them clearly. The mouth-parts of Poduras are similar to those of other insect orders like Neuroptera, Orthoptera, and Coleoptera, with some parts being degraded or obsolete. The mouth appears as a simple ring with a labrum, jaws, maxillae, and labium. The mandibles are slender with teeth for crushing food, while the maxillae have lobes at the end. The spring of Poduras consists of three-jointed appendages that are homologous to the ovipositor of higher insects. Another overlooked organ in Achorutes resembles an ovipositor and may be used for egg-laying. Understanding these structures helps us see similarities between Poduras and other insects.|['1.

The Poduras, unique insects, have a special organ on their abdomen that helps them attach to smooth surfaces. They lay their eggs under stones or tree bark, and the embryos develop similarly to Caddis flies. The larva is white, short, and stout, differing from the adult. After molting, it becomes purplish and slender. The larva hatches within 6 to 10 days, showing similarities to Neuropterous Mystacides. Sir John Lubbock studied their internal anatomy, focusing on the respiratory system with tracheae found in Smynthurus. These creatures show a degradation process where they acquire Thysanurous characteristics. Lubbock's dissections have enhanced our understanding of their internal structure, shedding light on their unique respiratory system with spiracles on the head.|"['1.

"Here is the refined passage for middle school students:

In the world of tiny creatures called Poduras, there are different families with unique characteristics. Let's look at a few of them. The Smynturidae family has a globular or ovoid body with long and slender legs. They have four or eight-segmented antennae and eight eyes on each side of their head. One example is the Smynthurus, with four-jointed antennae and no prominent dorsal tubercles. In the Poduridae family, creatures like Orchesella have unequal body segments and long, six-jointed antennae. Degeeria has unequal body segments and four-jointed antennae.

Tomocerus is a common species with unequal abdominal segments, simple hairs, and scales. It has very long four-jointed antennae with ringed terminal segments and seven eyes on each side. The mouth-parts are enlarged in Fig. 161, showing mandibles, maxillae, maxillary palpus, labium, labial palpus, lacinia, and a ventral sucking disk. The markings on the scales vary greatly, making them unreliable as test objects. Lepidocyrtus, another species, has unequal abdominal segments, long four-jointed antennae, and eight eyes on each side. A species of Lepidocyrtus found in New England is depicted in Fig. 172. The mouth-parts in this genus are similar to Tomocerus. Lipura and Anura are in the Lipuridae family, lacking a spring mechanism. Lipura fimetaria is a common white species in Europe. Lubbock notes that Lipuridae currently includes Lipura and Anura, with similar mouth structures but no spring mechanism.|['1.

Figure 174 shows Anurida maritima discovered at Nantucket, found under stones between tide marks. Lubbock considers it similar to the European species. It differs from Lipura in head shape and lacks upcurved spines, with more pointed antennae. The legs end in a large, long, curved claw. The mouth-parts resemble Achorutes, with mandibles ending in three to six teeth. Anura is identified by a conical beak hanging beneath the head. They feed on dead leaves and vegetation.

Our journey through the world of insects has taken us from the intelligent Hive bee to the humble parasitic mites. While Demodex is among the simplest insects, even lower is the Pentastoma, resembling a worm, living in the nostrils of animals. Centipedes and Galley worms, though worm-like, are true insects with three pairs of feet and tracheae for breathing. Pauropus, a unique Myriopod, has nine segments and pairs of feet. Young mites and spiders start with fewer feet, like the larva of red garden mites and the Tardigrade. The unity of insect organization is evident from larval stages to complex forms like bees, showing a progression from simple creatures to highly developed ones. This common form allows for endless variations, from simple Poduras to intricate bees, demonstrating the evolution and diversity of insects.|['1.

Studying the growth of insects from their egg stage reveals a common design in their development. The earlier stages of a bee, fly, or beetle germ all share a resemblance, suggesting a common ancestor. This idea aligns with the studies of Von Baer, Lamarck, and Darwin, prompting questions about the origin of species and the forces guiding life. The theory of evolution, though debated, offers a powerful tool in understanding biology. Just as the nebular hypothesis aids geology and the atomic theory aids chemistry, evolution theory in biology helps unravel the mysteries of creation. Despite objections, many naturalists find the theory essential for their work and believe it will become fundamental to biology, much like other scientific theories. Exploring the ancestry of insects reveals a shared embryonic form, suggesting a common ancestral insect type called Leptus, akin to the Nauplius larval form in Crustacea.|"[""1.

The first to discuss the ancestry of insects was Fritz Müller in 1863. He suggested that insects might have evolved from a Zoëa, a larval form of crabs. However, there are significant differences between insects and crustaceans. Hæckel, in 1866, also proposed a similar idea. Friedrich Brauer supported this theory in 1869, suggesting that Podurids might be the ancestors of insects. Sir John Lubbock agreed, stating that Campodea could be the primordial type from which various insect orders originated. Despite these theories, the exact ancestry of insects remains debated. Some believe insects may have evolved from worm-like aquatic creatures. Discoveries of ancient insect fossils in rocks have pushed back the origins of insects to earlier periods, challenging previous assumptions. The study of early insect ancestors continues to intrigue scientists.|['1.

When we examine unique creatures like Pentastoma and Linguatula, we notice a striking resemblance to worms in their external appearance. However, these similarities are a result of their parasitic lifestyle. Their jointed limbs, seen in the embryo of some species, transform into elongated forms, retaining only claws or curved hooks akin to young tape worms. The ancestry of hypothetical Leptus among worms remains a mystery. One potential ancestor could be the rare Peripatus, a land-dwelling creature with fleshy tubercles and claws, somewhat resembling insects. Professor Ganin's discoveries on ichneumon parasites' early stages reveal worm-like features during embryonic development. These parasites exhibit unique cell division and transformation processes, resembling primitive insect embryos.

The third larval stage, reached by only a few, is long and oval like those of ichneumon larvae. It has thirteen body segments, excluding the head, and a well-developed muscular system. This stage is more active than previous ones. New organs like air tubes and fat bodies develop. During the pupa stage, imaginal disks form, which will become the adult skin. The development of Platygaster involves rudimentary appendages, while in flies like Muscidæ and Corethra, the disks build the entire body. Polynema, an egg-parasite, lays eggs in dragonfly eggs, developing similarly to Platygaster. The sting of the adult consists of three pairs of tubercles. Ophloneurus, another egg-parasite, remains within its egg membrane and transitions directly to the pupa stage. Teleas, a parasite in Water Boatman eggs, has a larval stage with bristles on the abdomen.|['1.

In his remarkable discoveries, Ganin highlights the unique formation of eggs and germs in these parasites compared to other insects. The eggs lack nutritive cells, and the germ's primitive band formation is delayed until the second larval stage. The embryonal membrane differs from other insects and may be similar to certain crustaceans. Ganin notes the provisional organs of larvae are distinct and may be found in parasitic crustaceans. He compares the development of egg parasites to a leech, Nephelis. Ganin suggests that comparative embryology holds the key to understanding the genealogical relations of animals. The acceleration and retardation in the growth of these parasites hint at evolution theories. The diversity in larval forms among ichneumon flies raises questions about their ancestral connections. Ganin's findings support the theory that insects trace their lineage back to worms.|"[""1.

The path from ancient creatures to modern insects is a fascinating journey. It's possible that insects evolved from lowly worms like the Syllis, with appendages resembling those of insects. The development of tracheae and wings in insects was a crucial step. Tracheae, initially simple tubes, evolved to aid in respiration and flight. The aquatic Protoleptus, the ancestor of Leptus, likely had similar structures for buoyancy, which later transformed into tracheae for breathing. Wings, essential for flying insects, may have initially been gill-like organs in aquatic larvae, aiding in movement and blood oxygenation. The loss or acquisition of wings in insects is influenced by their habits and environment.

Plate 2 displays various forms of larvae, including Leptus, Diplax, Coccinella, Cicada, Cicindela, Ant Lion, Calligrapha, Aphis, Hemerobius, Glyrinua, Carabid, and Meloë. The eruciform type of larva is considered the most advanced. The cylindrical form of bee and caterpillar larvae is believed to have evolved through descent, as seen in the Caddis fly larva. The caterpillar-like form of the immature Caddis fly suggests an evolutionary link to other closely related insect groups. The adaptation of larval forms to their habitats is a fascinating aspect of insect development, with each form suited to its specific lifestyle. The metamorphosis of insects involves stages like larva, pupa, and imago, which are not always clearly defined and can vary depending on factors like season and climate. Insects with incomplete metamorphosis, such as May flies and grasshoppers, exhibit multiple stages of growth, blurring the lines between larval and adult forms.|['1.

Insects go through various changes as they grow. For instance, grasshoppers leave the egg looking quite similar to adults but without wings. On the other hand, bee larvae are very different from adult bees. Young grasshoppers are active right after hatching, while bee larvae are more like embryos. This is similar to how human infants rely on parents, like wasp maggots do. Evolutionists are puzzled by how caterpillars change into butterflies with sucking mouthparts. Researching different insect groups reveals that terms like biting and sucking insects are not absolute. Mandibulate insects like beetles can have huge jaws for sucking blood, not tearing flesh. Mouthparts in insects like bugs vary greatly, making terms like 'haustellate' misleading. For example, house flies use a fleshy labium for sucking, while horse flies have adapted mandibles and maxillae for piercing. Butterfly mouthparts differ from bees, and even moths show variation in their sucking structures.|"['1.

In the Cecropia moth, the evolution of mouthparts varies greatly among different species. For instance, the Platysamia Cecropia has completely lost its maxillae, while the Macrosila cluentius from Madagascar boasts a tongue extending to nine and a quarter inches, ideal for reaching deep nectaries in orchids. These adaptations are closely linked to the insects' habits and environments. Some argue that these changes are a result of use and disuse, while others claim they are merely correlated. Similarly, the stingers of bees and ovipositors of other insects like the Ichneumon fly and saw fly share a common origin, evolving from three pairs of tubercles in the larval stage. These transformations underscore the intricate relationship between structure, function, and evolution in the animal kingdom.|['1.

In this calendar, we focus on harmful insects. Their appearance times vary across regions, with Texas seeing them six weeks earlier than Labrador. The emergence of insects aligns with the blooming of specific plants. For example, the American Tent caterpillar and Canker worm larvae hatch as apple trees start leafing out. By early June, when forests and orchards are fully leafed out, insects arrive to feed on the foliage. In April, gardeners should clean fruit trees to remove bark lice eggs that hatch in May. Caterpillars and insects often overwinter under tree bark. Look for Canker worm and Tent caterpillar eggs on tree shoots. Detect and eliminate Apple Tree Borer by searching for its castings at the tree base and removing the young grub. This season offers opportunities to catch and control these pests, along with cylindrical bark borers and weevils like Pea weevil, Pine weevil, and others.|['1.

In the family of moths called Phalænidæ, which includes Geometers, Loopers, or Span-worms, there are two pests that trouble fruit growers. The Canker worm is a well-known threat. By taking proper care and being proactive, their damage can be greatly reduced. It is suggested to domesticate English sparrows, doves, and other insect-eating birds to help control these pests. Farmers should focus on destroying the eggs laid in the fall and spring, as well as the wingless females that crawl up trees to lay eggs. Vigilance is key, as the damage is often done before it's noticed. Regularly checking and clearing trees of caterpillars can help. Collaboration among farmers to form a Board of Destruction could effectively combat this issue. The Canker worms hatch in May, damaging fruit trees by eating tender leaves. It's crucial to take preventive measures to protect the trees. Other pests like the May beetle and Rose beetle can also harm crops and require attention.

During the hot sun, beetles such as the Saperda, or apple tree borer, fly around trees, each tree facing its unique enemy that burrows into its trunk and branches. Tiger beetles like the Cicindela generosa and Cicindela hirticollis are often found in sandy areas, with larvae residing in deep sand-bank holes. The nine-spotted Lady Bug, Coccinella novemnotata, is part of a beetle group that feeds on plant lice, benefiting plants. Chrysopa, an enemy of Aphides, lays its eggs on long silken stalks out of harm's way. Dragonflies, like the Forceps-tail or Panorpa, prey on smaller insects and are commonly found in bushy fields. Bugs from the Hemiptera group, harmful to crops, suck plant sap with their long proboscis, causing leaves to wither and blight. The grain Aphis can devastate wheat fields, extracting sap from grains and reducing their size. Leaf-hoppers like Tettigonia and Ceresa damage plant leaves, with Tettigonia Vitis affecting grapevines and Tettigonia rosæ infesting roses.

The Seventeen-year Cicada, a destructive insect, has caused significant harm to apple, peach, and quince trees in Yellow Springs, Ohio. These insects bore into fruit-bearing twigs, causing branches to break and fruit to be lost. While plum and cherry trees have been spared, the Cicadas have attacked grapevines, blackberries, raspberries, elms, maples, ash trees, willows, catalpas, honey-locusts, and wild roses. They have been spotted from Columbus, Ohio, to St. Louis, with visits to Washington and Philadelphia. Other pests like the Hop-vine moth, Ilythia colonella, Spindle-worm moth, Bark borers, Blight beetles, and Tree crickets are also active this month. Insects are preparing for winter by finding shelter or laying eggs. The American Silk worm, for example, spins a cocoon to hibernate in as the weather turns colder.|"[""1.

On a warm day in autumn, one might notice clouds of insects, mostly ants, filling the air, especially at sunset when the sun's rays shine through them. These ants are swarming as it is their marriage day. The workers are the ones who hibernate and take care of the eggs and larvae produced by the females. In September, the females swarm, mate, and establish new colonies. Dr. C. C. Abbot observed a similar swarming event in New Jersey, where red ants emerged from their underground home for the first time, using their delicate wings. These ants seemed confused and ill at ease, trying to navigate their way through the grass with their wings. Eventually, they would take flight, rising slowly upwards with the help of the wind. This behavior is similar to that of Saüba ants in South America, where workers clear the exit paths for the winged individuals during their exodus in January and February.|['1.

The time of day aligns with Mr. Bates' observations. Around 4 P.M., we first spotted the winged ants, likely starting their flight, which lasted until nearly 7 P.M., well past sundown. The following morning, no ants were visible above ground, and the nest appeared empty, with a few ants in a semi-dormant state. Many ants were likely carried by the wind, unable to return home, while others landed on nearby trees, damaging their wings. It remains a mystery how these insects find their way back to their nest. Females that don't return establish new nests. In Maine and Massachusetts, we've noted ant swarms on warm September days. The White Pine Plant lice lay eggs on pine needles, attracting various insects. This passage introduces Entomology, focusing on insects' habits, transformations, and economic impact.|['1.
