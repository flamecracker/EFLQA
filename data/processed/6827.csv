"Three boys were eagerly waiting in Ring's backyard, kicking the dew off the tall grass. They paused from scanning the cloudy sky to look towards the cedars hiding the Fulton house. ""We should've gone when we saw he wasn't here, Jerry,"" said one boy. Another boy explained how they dug worms the night before but Tod's absent-minded father mistook them for berries. Dave Thomas defended Tod, revealing that his father grounded him for forgetting to pick blackberries for Aunt Jen. As Tod approached, the boys gathered their fishing gear and decided to hitch a ride on Steve Porter's launch to save time. They joked about fishing with worms versus minnows, each claiming their bait was best. The boys, of similar size but different builds, headed down the road towards the boat, excited for their fishing adventure."|"[""1.

Frank was annoyed by Jerry's fishing tactics. Their disagreement stemmed from their different angling styles. Despite Jerry's attempt to keep the peace, Frank couldn't hold back his frustration.

Dave and Frank were left at the cottonwood, where they shared advice on fishing spots and bait. Jerry and Tod rowed away, with Tod preferring still fishing with worms while Jerry believed in using the right bait. Jerry's well-equipped tackle-box and gear contrasted with Tod's simple setup, aiming for big catfish. As they reached the dam, Jerry noticed the gates closing, creating a backwater ideal for fishing. Dave warned Tod of the danger near the flume, prompting Jerry to rush to rescue him.

Jerry found himself on a slippery rock, feeling like he was in a bad dream. The boat vanished, replaced by churning foam. He raced to the edge, nearly falling in, and peered into the water below. Dave joined him but stumbled, needing rescue. They spotted the boat downstream but not Tod. Jerry rushed to a nearby house for help, reaching Mr. Aikens at the mill. With no response, Jerry grabbed a boat, and they rowed towards the falls. Jerry dove repeatedly, while Aikens and others searched with grappling hooks. The crowd grew, boats filled the water, and a seine net was used in the desperate search for Tod.|"['1.

Despite their efforts, the boys faced disappointment as each shout of discovery led to only waterlogged logs or mud-filled debris. A tragic moment unfolded when a black-haired body surfaced, only to reveal itself as a dog, intensifying the heartbreak. Mr. Fulton, Tod's father, arrived, his silent grief adding to the somber atmosphere. The boys felt a sense of guilt over their friend's fate. As the day wore on, hunger gnawed at them, but they couldn't eat. The possibility of finding Tod alive faded, replaced by a grim reality. Dynamite was brought in for a final attempt at recovery, but even after multiple explosions, Tod's body remained elusive. Eventually, the search was called off for the night, with only Mr. Fulton and Mr. Aikens staying behind. Despite Jerry's attempt to offer some hope, the grim truth of the situation lingered.|"['1.

"""Don't be upset. I've lived near rivers for over forty years and seen my share of drownings. The water may seem friendly in the sun, but danger lurks beneath.

The task ahead was challenging, but Dave and Jerry had a plan. They decided to travel on foot along the riverbank, staying close to each other for company. Dave took the lead, navigating through the shallows while Jerry secured their boat. As they advanced, the terrain became more rugged, with deep pools and rocky rapids. They communicated by shouting across the water, determined to find their missing friend, Tod Fulton.

No one dared to settle there, despite its fertile land. As they drew closer, a sudden discovery left Jerry startled. A mysterious object near the island sparked wild theories in his mind, including the possibility of their friend Tod's presence.

The man on Lost Island growled a warning, deterring the boys from venturing across. They continued along, disheartened by the encounter. Jerry speculated about the man's presence while they crossed a bridge. Suddenly, they spotted a boat floating by. Jerry, known for his diving skills, leaped in to retrieve it. With great effort, he slowly propelled the waterlogged boat toward the shore, with Dave assisting. As they pondered the boat's condition and slow journey downstream, they found it all quite puzzling.

"""I understand that. The boat seemed to be drifting at a similar speed to our walking pace. So, it likely cleared Lost Island about three minutes after we spoke to that man,"" Jerry explained.

Dave noticed the rope had been cut loose and the bucket Tod had placed in the boat was missing. Jerry's excitement grew as he connected the dots. He suspected that Tod, caught in a storm last week, might have tried to bail out the boat and reach Lost Island. The mysterious man they saw might have cut the boat loose to prevent Tod from leaving the island.

Convinced of foul play, Jerry proposed investigating the island further. He planned to swim across or find a way to uncover the secrets hidden there.

"Before departing, they capsized their boat and drained most of the water out. Lacking oars, they tethered it to a sturdy willow tree. Jerry put on his clothes again, feeling a chill in the morning air, eager to warm up with a brisk walk. Despite being on the east side of the river, they faced a challenging trail. Upon reaching a bridge a few minutes later, they needed to cross to get home. Dave wanted to follow the west bank, but Jerry, frustrated, started off alone, with Dave reluctantly following. Both were cold, hungry, and irritable. The river's fishy odor heightened their unease as they navigated swamps and creeks. ""We must reach _there_ before dawn,"" Jerry insisted. They boarded a clam-fishing boat with heavy oars and set off towards Lost Island, its eerie silhouette looming ahead."|['1.

Dave and Jerry were in a boat, worried about their missing friend. As they rowed, they saw a man on Lost Island with a shotgun, warning them to leave. They turned back, realizing the man knew their friend's name without them mentioning it. They decided to head towards Carter's Mills to cross Plum Run and reach Watertown.

"Dave mentioned that Mr. Aikens convinced Tod's father to return home for breakfast and rest. They might have to wait for breakfast if there's no boat on their side of the river. The boys found an old houseboat at Galpin's shanty, where Old Pete Galpin lived alone. They borrowed a flat boat named ""UPANATUM"" and set off despite its leak.

Jerry rang the bell, but there was no answer. After a while, he heard footsteps approaching the door, but it wasn't Mr. Fulton who opened it; instead, Mr. Aikens stood there. Both Jerry and Mr. Aikens were excited, and Mr. Aikens shook Jerry's arm vigorously. Unbeknownst to them, a white-faced man watched with anticipation from the doorway. Mr. Fulton, upon seeing Jerry, also grabbed his arm in a rush, exclaimed, and left the room for a lengthy conversation. Jerry eagerly awaited his return to share more but was met with disinterest and distracted responses from Mr. Fulton. Disappointed, Jerry left, feeling his story had not been appreciated.

Jerry asked his mother if it was okay for him to return home late, hoping for her approval to stay out as long as he wanted. He reminded her of the promise to go camping this summer. Mrs. Ring, proud of her son's independence, agreed after some hesitation. Jerry quickly prepared some sandwiches, ready for his adventure.

"They started singing the chorus again, even more off-key than before. They were only allowed to sing one line. Suddenly, a pile of boys, beddings, and pillows catapulted from the floor, throwing Frank onto the bed and almost knocking Jerry down. ""I told him, but he acted so strangely about it that I'm not sure what to believe. I wouldn't be surprised if they—him and Mr. Aikens, you know—never even went near Lost Island. They just see us as kids,"" said one of the boys. Dave got dressed quickly, and they headed downstairs. Jerry had made amends with Mrs. Thomas, so they didn't waste time waiting for Dave to grab a bite before heading out. ""I have some loose change in my pocket,"" Jerry said as they hit the street. ""If we hurry through the side streets, we can catch the two-five express on the Dellwood Interurban. We can hop off near Downers Crossing, which should be close to Lost Island."" They barely caught the two-five train. The car was empty, so they relaxed in their seats. Jerry chuckled to himself as he noticed the two others had dozed off.

Three boys found themselves overwhelmed by six attackers in matching uniforms. Initially bewildered, the trio fought back but were outnumbered. Dave, Phil, and their friend Frank had set out on an early morning fishing trip but were met with hostility on Lost Island. The boys were determined to explore the island despite the rough welcome. As tensions eased, the groups introduced themselves. The attackers included Sid, Dick, Fred, Algy, Frank, Barney, and Ted. Each had a unique nickname and quirky traits.

Jerry and Phil, two of the boys, stealthily approached the Scout boat moored by the river bank. With Phil rowing skillfully, they aimed to reach the island unnoticed. However, as they neared the shore, a man emerged and threatened them. Despite the warning, Jerry stood his ground, mentioning Mr. Fulton and Mr. Aikens' impending visit to investigate the island. The man, known as Billings, seemed wary of their presence, hinting at a past encounter at Jerry's dad's office. After an unsuccessful attempt to explore the island earlier, the boys devised a plan. Jerry and Phil were to fetch the Big Four, cross the river, and rendezvous near the island to signal Dick Garrett for further action. The group believed this strategy held promise for success in their mission.|"[""1.

Jerry and Phil had a plan to reach Lost Island safely. The Boy Scouts and Dave and Frank were to gather visibly near a campfire to distract attention. This would allow Jerry and Phil to land at the lower end of the island unnoticed. The Scouts were busy setting up tents and preparing a simple meal of freshly caught fish and baked potatoes. They ate using paper plates and basic utensils, enjoying the food by the campfire as night fell. After eating, Jerry and Phil set off inland towards Plum Run, but encountered a dog at a farmhouse. Continuing on, they faced a decision at a fork in the road. Phil chose a path that seemed to lead through marshland, prompting Jerry to suggest turning back to find the correct way to the bridge.|"['1.

Jerry confidently led the way down the dark back road, with Phil following closely behind. As they crossed the echoing bridge and descended the giant stone steps to the river bank, they were relieved to find their boat, the _Big Four_, exactly where they had left it. Phil struggled a bit to fit the oars into the boat's oarlocks, but they soon set off. Jerry skillfully navigated the boat along the swift current, hugging the east bank to make the journey easier. As Lost Island came into view, Jerry made a plan for landing. Phil would take the boat the rest of the way while Jerry headed to a secluded cove. However, when they reached the shore, Phil quickly disembarked and disappeared into the darkness. Jerry waited for a signal from Dick, using a clever method involving a flashlight and a pocket mirror to communicate without drawing attention.|"['1.

From a distant shore, hidden by Lost Island, came a loud commotion that seemed like a war party approaching. Amidst the noise, a Boy Scout cheer pierced the air, with Dave and Frank's voices rising above the clamor. The island loomed ahead, quiet and eerie. Both boys felt a chilling sensation of being observed, but no signs of life were visible as they quietly guided the boat to shore. The dense vegetation was challenging to navigate, with muddy patches and unsettling sounds like a screech owl's hoot. As they trekked cautiously through the wilderness, they stumbled upon a shed-like structure. Convinced that their friend Tod might be inside, they pushed open the door and stumbled into a dimly lit room, only to find it empty. The sound of groaning from above spurred them to search for a way to reach the attic, but their efforts were in vain as the chair they tried to use as a ladder broke.|"[""1.

Phil and Jerry tried to reach the trap door by standing on each other's shoulders. Jerry managed to grab the edge of the opening but heard a strange noise from the far side of the room. They noticed a partially open door and rushed towards it, but a fierce sixteen-year-old girl with a hand-axe blocked their way. She demanded they leave the island immediately and threatened them with the axe. Obediently, the boys followed her out into the dark. As they left, she threw a stone that hit a Scout on the other shore, causing him to howl in pain. The boys explained they were looking for a missing boy, and the girl revealed that the boy they sought was alive on the island.|"['1.

Jerry enjoyed the warm water as he swam, feeling comfortable except for his clothes. As he swam, he turned on his back, noticing the light disappearing from the shore. Despite an impulse to turn back, he kept swimming across the current. Suddenly, he heard a rhythmic noise, realizing it was a boat approaching. Jerry decided to wait and see who it was. As the boat neared, he hid in the water, only showing his nose. When the boat got close, Jerry dived to avoid being seen. Unfortunately, he was hit by the oar, but managed to hold onto the boat. Gradually, Jerry's vision cleared, and he realized there were two men in the boat. They landed on Lost Island, giving Jerry hope that this time he might find something valuable.|"['1.

As the minutes ticked by slowly, Jerry felt the water cooling around him. Relief flooded through him as he heard the familiar rustle of someone approaching through the tall grass. Anxious nerves made the wait seem endless as the footsteps drew nearer. Finally, two figures emerged onto the beach, one supporting the other. Jerry's heart leaped with joy as he recognized his friend Tod Fulton being helped to a seat. The mystery of Tod's disappearance began to unravel, but new questions arose. Why had Tod been rescued in such a secretive manner? Why had Mr. Fulton initially dismissed Jerry's story only to follow up on it covertly? Lost Island held more secrets than Jerry had imagined.

"""No, Jerry, you see, the island--that is,"" looking towards Mr. Fulton as if for permission to continue, ""there's something happening on Lost Island that Mr. Billings believes is not anyone else's concern, and he didn't want me snooping around.""

""Now, Jerry, you're jumping to conclusions without reason. I'll share this much with you because I think you deserve to know: Mr. Billings' secret truly belongs to me. As soon as I can, I'll reveal everything to you. But what happened to your friend--if there were two of you?""

""Your friend was standing on the bank opposite Lost Island, figuring out how long he should wait before assuming I was drowned or attacked by someone. He might have gone for the sheriff by now--or the coroner. It's better to drop me off here, and I'll head back.""

""I should take you back to town and have Doc Burgess check you over. Maybe the impact has affected your brain. But the truth is I didn't want to return to Watertown--I need to rush to Chester for that timer promised for tomorrow. Are there any waterfalls this way?"" he asked jokingly.

Excited cries of joy erupted from the darkness towards the river as the boys finally spotted Jerry, who had been missing. Tod was with him, which brought immense relief to the worried boys. They bombarded Jerry with questions, giving him a moment to gather his thoughts and come up with a story. Phil finally calmed everyone down and asked the awaited question. Jerry revealed that Tod and Billings were old friends, explaining why Tod wasn't in a rush to be rescued. Billings wanted the island's fish all to himself.

Jerry, a curious and observant boy, found himself in the midst of an unexpected spectacle. As he hid behind some elderberry bushes, he witnessed the awe-inspiring sight of an aeroplane soaring through the sky. The aircraft, with its propellers whirring, circled above Lost Island, captivating Jerry's attention. Despite a moment of peril when the aeroplane appeared to falter, the skilled pilot swiftly regained control and continued his flight. Meanwhile, a motorboat approached from Plum Run, carrying three men, one of whom Jerry suspected to be Mr. Fulton.

Jerry witnessed a remarkable sight that left him in awe. The flying machine, initially mistaken for an accident, revealed its true capabilities by hovering just a hundred feet above him, before coming to a sudden stop mid-air. The machine emitted a loud sound and blue vapor, showcasing a never-before-seen feat of aviation. Despite the pilot's apparent satisfaction, disaster struck when the motor caught fire, causing the plane to crash. Jerry rushed to the wreckage, where he encountered Tod.

The camp was set up by the river, next to the path. Mr. Fulton and Elizabeth visited on the second night at the new spot. Dick watched over the _Skyrocket_, and Tod stayed back at the cabin to care for Billings, who was getting better with the doctor's help and Elizabeth's care. Elizabeth brought her guitar and sang popular songs while Dave joined in after some hesitation. The boys enjoyed the music. Mr. Fulton noticed the motor was missing from the shed. They realized the thieves had pried open the hangar. Mr. Fulton warned them not to confront the thieves. They planned to surprise the thieves if they returned. Elizabeth gave them a revolver for protection. The boys cautiously approached the hangar and saw a flash of light inside.|"[""1.

Not so cautiously now, and much faster, they found the small door in the dark. Jerry opened it quietly, and they entered a small room filled with supplies. Through a narrow doorway, they could see the main workshop. Two shadowy figures were searching the room with bright flashlights. Suddenly, the attention turned to them, and they retreated behind the door. Phil fired his gun, causing chaos. The intruders fled, crashing through the wall. The boys found their boat sunk under stones. The next day, the boat was discovered with a hole. Mr. Fulton decided to search the river, suspecting the motor was hidden there. Phil's theory proved right, and they found the motor in a bay at the river's north end.|"['1.

You two take the Scout boat around the point. I'll come through the woods and join you soon."" As they worked on the boat, Phil joked about the gas-eater.

Mr. Fulton and the boys were hard at work preparing the _Skyrocket_ for its big demonstration. Despite facing doubters, they were determined to prove the skeptics wrong. The boys were feeling the strain from working tirelessly, but they pushed on, making sure every detail was perfect. After a quick swim and a hearty breakfast of pancakes, they returned to the hangar to finish the final touches on the aircraft. Mr. Fulton, surprised by how quickly time had passed, urged the boys to take a break and play while he and Tod completed the last adjustments. As they enjoyed lunch together, the excitement and anticipation for the _Skyrocket's_ test flight grew.|['1.

Mr. Fulton was finally content, and the boys were too. He strolled back to the hangar, asking for their help to bring out the plane. Most of the boys were to stay clear until the show at four, except for two. Tod stayed willingly, and Jerry volunteered as well. Together, they smoothly moved the _Skyrocket_. After admiring the plane, they dispersed, some off to teach Elizabeth how to fish. Tod and Jerry got to work on the plane, ensuring everything was ready by two o'clock. The plane gleamed in the sunlight, looking perfect. Mr. Fulton tested the motor but waited for someone to watch before flying. The boys couldn't find a wrench, so they waited for Mr. Fulton's return. When he arrived with visitors, Lewis and Harris, the boys felt frustrated by their lack of interest in the plane's innovations. Jerry even wished they could be left behind, feeling a strong dislike towards them.|"['1.

"""Hey, I really don't like those guys,"" said one of the men. ""They're so mean ever since that accident. I can't stand them. They act like my dad is trying to trick them or something. Listen to them complaining. I feel sorry for any woman married to one of them, waiting for dinner.""

""Well, let's stop talking and get moving. Tod, go ask your dad for the wrench. Or do you think I can unscrew this with my hands?"" He joked as he tried.

It turned out to be quite funny. Mr. Fulton hurried over at Tod's call. ""Someone messed with this,"" he said. ""Put the pump back on and try a bit of gas. If there's no water in it, we're lucky. Those crooks probably did something sneaky!""

The engine ran fine for a bit, but as soon as the leftover gas ran out, it sputtered and stopped. 

""You mean we can't go up? It's the last day!"" Mr. Lewis protested. 

""I told you not to buy until you saw it work. I'm at your mercy now. You're missing a chance to help your country in the war. I can't fly on water. I tried, but it's impossible.""

Mr. Harris agreed, explaining they were agents not buyers. Jerry proposed a plan to fetch gas. He suggested catching the 4 o'clock train to Watertown, getting gas, and returning by 5.

Jerry's task began with ease as he found a farmhouse to make a crucial call.

Dave, Tod, and Phil swiftly loaded the two cans onto the Scout boat. Dave and Tod rowed as they crossed the water. Jerry, feeling anxious, asked about a plan as a mysterious boat approached without any lights. Jerry suggested staying calm and rowing steadily until the last moment, then rowing fast to reach the shore before the other boat could turn back. With the motor getting closer, they could barely see in the dim light. Jerry yelled to row hard, narrowly avoiding a collision with the other boat. Back on land, the crew cheered for Jerry.

Leaving Lost Island far in the distance, the group was uncertain of their direction. A bright line of fire on the left hinted at a nearby railroad, likely the Belt Line leading to Watertown. A break in the clouds revealed the Big Dipper, confirming they were heading north. As they descended, the noise lessened, allowing for easier conversation.

Two large and menacing men approached Jerry in the dark, leaving him petrified with fear. Unable to call for help, Jerry felt a surge of terror as he realized they were the men they were after.
