Although Mr. Anthony meant well, Jack despised the trade and faced mistreatment from the foreman, Andrew Carson. Their conflicts escalated until Jack finally stood up for himself by knocking down the foreman. This led to Mr. Anthony dismissing Jack from his apprenticeship.

Pressing for military service was once conducted in secret and considered illegal. To address the urgent need for men, a law granting justices the power to impress individuals, except those eligible to vote, was passed with bipartisan support. England, allied with Austria and Holland against France, was embroiled in a dispute over the Spanish crown succession. The two claimants were Archduke Charles of Austria and Philip, Duke of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV. Despite a treaty suggesting Archduke Charles as successor, the dying King of Spain secretly willed the throne to Philip, leading to outrage in England, Holland, and the empire. This breach of the treaty of partition, aimed at preventing the union of French and Spanish monarchies, sparked war preparations by the allies. Spain and France united under Philip's rule, causing tensions in Europe and prompting the formation of a grand alliance against France to safeguard trading interests and prevent a consolidation of power under one monarch.|['1.

In 1703, Portugal joined the allies to strengthen their forces. The allies aimed to take Barcelona, hoping for support from the Catalans for Charles. However, a plot to hand over the city to Charles was discovered, leading the English force to retreat. In Portugal, Duke of Berwick defeated the English and Dutch forces, with little help from the Portuguese. Despite setbacks, Gibraltar was captured by Sir George Rooke and Prince George of Hesse. In a significant turn, Duke of Marlborough secured a victory at Blenheim, dealing a blow to Louis XIV's power. This victory bolstered Charles' supporters in Spain, especially in Catalonia and Aragon. To capitalize on this, an expedition was sent to Catalonia, led by the Earl of Peterborough, despite his unconventional background.|['1.

In 1677, Lord Mordaunt returned to England after inheriting his father's title and estates. At just twenty years old, he married and then volunteered to sail to the Mediterranean to aid Tangier besieged by the Moors. The relief expedition did not materialize, but he returned to England in 1679. In 1680, he sailed to Tangier again and successfully defended the town. He later engaged in politics, opposing a standing army and advocating for the exclusion of the Duke of York from the throne.

In 1697, Charles inherited the title of Earl of Peterborough after his uncle's death. For the next four years, he lived quietly, only occasionally addressing issues in the House of Peers. His relationship with Marlborough varied, but he had the Duchess's favor. When a leader was needed for an expedition to Spain, the Duchess ensured Charles was chosen. His life was a mix of idleness and energy, generosity and financial strain, and a fierce stance against corruption. When the Mayor of Southampton received orders to recruit for the queen's service, he saw an opportunity to rid himself of a troublesome lad, John Stilwell.

It was morning when he woke up and noticed he now had almost twenty companions with him. Some were pacing like caged animals, others were loudly expressing their distress, a few sat in silence, while some were shouting threats at those they blamed for their capture. A guard with a musket stood nearby, and sailors passed by occasionally. Jack approached one of them and politely asked for water for the group. The sailor, understanding their situation, helped them by bringing fresh water and saltwater for washing. Jack took the opportunity to wash up and tend to his wound, feeling much better afterward. He contemplated his situation, realizing that resisting was futile due to the law allowing impressment. Despite the circumstances, he decided to make the best of it and earn the respect of his superiors. Later, a meal was served, and although many refused to eat as a form of protest, hunger eventually made them regret it.

In the morning, Jack observed his fellow companions in misfortune. Some were familiar faces from the wharves, known troublemakers.

Jack addressed the group, emphasizing the inevitability of serving the queen and warning against further trouble. The officer praised Jack's spirit, noting his potential as a soldier despite his young age.

On board the ship, life for a boy is tough. They do all the work and get little in return.

The wind grew stronger, and the cutter sailed smoothly into Dover harbor. As morning broke, the exhausted men were allowed on deck. They were worn out from seasickness and the rough journey.

The colonel met them, noting that some recruits had agreed to join willingly, while others had resisted and suffered for it. The men were warned about desertion and the consequences.

As I prepare to set this aside, I hope you can also set aside any anger about me securing a soldier's pressing for your cousin. By his letter, it's clear he doesn't want any enmity to arise. We've lived in harmony for fifteen years, and I see no reason why we can't do so again after this cloud passes. I miss you greatly; things have been difficult since you left. The food is poorly cooked, and the service lacking. If you're willing to return as a loving wife, I'll take a holiday to fetch you and Alice from Basingstoke. I'm sending Jack five guineas for his adventure, and I've decided to pay Andrew Carson and let him go. Give my love to Alice and tell her to keep her spirits up. I've read your letter to my wife, and I see my faults. I misunderstood you and didn't consider your feelings enough. I hope we can be good friends in the future. A reconciliation was achieved between my wife and me, and I've sent you an order for five guineas. The cloth merchant's shop closed, and I traveled to Basingstoke by stagecoach, where we reconciled.

The sergeant, though appearing stern, once had a secret life as a pirate. He shared with Jack that his pirating days were not by choice but forced upon him due to circumstances. The story was postponed due to bad weather, making everyone seasick. Jack, despite the rough conditions, ventured on deck. The ship battled against fierce waves, threatening to engulf it.

During my third voyage, after being at sea for about two weeks, our ships were anchored in a small bay when we spotted what we thought was a large merchant vessel approaching.

They opened fire on us, causing chaos and destruction. The pirate captain took his own life as their ship sank.

"We tied the rope ladder to the boat and one by one, we climbed up the cliff. It took a while for each of us to reach the top, navigating tricky spots where the cliff jutted out. But finally, the shaking stopped, and the light line was pulled tight. Cheers erupted from the boats as the rope ladder was hoisted up. Once everyone was at the top, a lantern was shown to signal our presence to the ship.

The lieutenant gave strict orders to spare any women but to shoot or subdue any men who resisted. The raid was a success, with the village taken by surprise and the pirates defeated without much resistance. The captain's wife, shocked by the British uniforms, was comforted by Mr. Escombe.

Quietly, Jack crawled out through the porthole and stood on the gun's muzzle. He reached the foremast shrouds above the port and swung himself up, looking over the quiet deck. Jack edged his way aft to the quarterdeck where the officers gathered. The captain ordered the officers to prepare for a mutiny. They armed themselves and readied the guns. Meanwhile, below deck, the mutineers tied up noncommissioned officers and secured the gangway. They planned to rush the deck and seize the magazine for ammunition. The ringleaders organized the men to clear the deck and overpower any resistance. The officers on deck prepared for the impending attack, ready to defend the ship against the mutiny.|"[""1.

A plan was set in motion to take over the ship. The mutineers had a detailed strategy involving different groups of men. The officers were unaware of the impending danger. The mutineers aimed to overpower the officers and take control of the ship. However, their plan was thwarted as the officers were prepared and armed. A tense standoff ensued on the deck as the mutineers faced armed sailors and officers. The captain's firm command demanded the surrender of the mutineers. The mutiny was swiftly quashed, with the ringleaders identified and imprisoned. The mutineers faced consequences, with some being sentenced to hang. The ship was restored to order, and the night ended with a sense of relief and vigilance among the crew.|"['1.

Before the punishment was carried out, the colonel spoke to the soldiers. He explained that the ringleaders had been sentenced to death but due to their youth and the circumstances, the death penalty was remitted. The colonel hoped the soldiers would recognize this leniency and return to their duties as loyal soldiers. Although a list of troublemakers was kept, no further action would be taken if the soldiers behaved. The naval court martial, facing a shortage of crew, avoided severe punishments to prevent a mutiny label. The fleet reunited near Portugal, and the colonel reported the mutiny's end to the Earl of Peterborough. Jack Stilwell, who helped foil the mutiny, discreetly met with the admiral to share his account and receive appreciation for his actions.|"['1.

Jack explained that his suspicions about a mutiny were confirmed by Sergeant Edwards, who was waiting to inform the officers. Jack recounted how he woke up during the mutiny and took action to warn the officers. The earl, impressed by Jack's background, discharged him from the regiment and appointed him as an ensign. The earl instructed tailors to provide Jack with a uniform. The young officers welcomed Jack warmly, appreciating his education and noble birth.

Upon Peterborough's arrival in Lisbon, he immediately focused on securing supplies that were previously denied to him. After facing challenges, he managed to borrow a substantial amount of money from a Jew named Curtisos. In return, Curtisos would be given the contract to supply provisions for the army. The success of this arrangement left Peterborough in high spirits, contrasting his previous irritable demeanor. He expressed his delight to Jack, his assistant, about the amusing situation with Lord Godolphin, who would have to honor the bills. Peterborough was eager to depart Lisbon after obtaining the necessary supplies. Meanwhile, discussions were ongoing about the fleet's destination, with a decision to head to the coast of Catalonia due to the favorable disposition of the Catalans towards Archduke Charles. Ultimately, the Archduke decided to accompany Peterborough to Spain to assess the loyalty of his subjects.|"['1.

The Prince of Hesse Darmstadt traveled ahead to Gibraltar to organize a part of the garrison for the expedition. On July 28th, the Archduke Charles set sail with Lord Peterborough on the Ranelagh, and the fleet departed an hour later. Upon reaching the Bay of Gibraltar after being joined by Sir Cloudesley Shovel's squadron near Tangiers, they found that the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt had arranged for the battalion of guards and three veteran regiments to embark. Two newly formed regiments from England would replace them. Jack's old regiment was among those to be replaced. Lord Peterborough expressed regret that Jack lacked the education for a commission but welcomed him for active duty. Jack learned that Lord Peterborough had rewarded him with fifty guineas for his conduct. The expedition then continued to Altea Bay, where they were welcomed by the locals who opposed French influence in Madrid. Lord Peterborough distributed a manifesto disclaiming any intentions of harm. The people rallied behind King Charles III, and a successful insurrection began in Denia. General Ramos took possession of the castle, and King Charles III was proclaimed amidst great enthusiasm. Lord Peterborough proposed a bold plan that could have swiftly secured the Spanish throne for Charles III. Madrid was within reach, but the plan was not executed.|"['1.

During the expedition, despite a daring and judicious plan, Peterborough faced obstacles due to the slow and timid Archduke Charles, influenced by cautious advisers. Peterborough's frustration grew as opportunities were missed due to the king's presence and his advisers' incapacity. Eventually, the troops re-embarked for Barcelona, where the heavily fortified city posed a challenge. The garrison was strong, and the city's defenses, though extensive, were not impregnable. The surrounding fertile landscape and the city's strategic layout added to the complexity. The allied fleet faced initial cannon fire but was largely unaffected. Meanwhile, the Prince of Hesse Darmstadt sought support from locals loyal to King Charles. The besieged city, under Governor Velasco, was well-prepared, making a direct assault unlikely. The expedition's hopes were dashed by failed promises and internal discord among officers, hindering progress.|"['1.

Lord Peterborough gathered a council of war aboard the Britannia on August 16, 1705. The council, including generals and colonels, unanimously decided against attacking Barcelona due to the limited strength of the allied army. Despite the troops landing successfully near Badalona, difficulties arose due to the strong sea conditions. The encampment was strategically set up near the city, and local villagers supported the allies. Despite King Charles's insistence on attacking, the council hesitated due to the lack of workmen for the siege. The king's presence on shore further complicated matters, leading to dissension among the allies and the Dutch general refusing to sacrifice his men. Ultimately, the council decided to abandon the siege attempt.|"['1.

Lord Peterborough faced immense challenges during the siege of Barcelona. He struggled with disagreements, criticism, and disobedience from his own troops. Despite the chaos, he confided in his loyal secretary, Jack, who supported him in his duties. While the siege progressed slowly, Peterborough secretly planned a bold move to surprise the citadel of Montjuich, a strategic stronghold of the enemy. Disguised as peasants, Peterborough, Jack, and a guide scouted the fortress, discovering its vulnerabilities. With the garrison's lax security in mind, Peterborough decided to launch a daring attack on the citadel. As he prepared for this risky maneuver, he kept his plans hidden from all but a few trusted individuals. Meanwhile, he orchestrated a diversion by announcing a retreat to Italy, deceiving his enemies and allies alike.|['1.

To Jack's surprise, his commander, typically impatient and easily angered, remained calm and patient despite facing accusations. No one suspected any hidden attack plans during the preparations for departure. On September 13th, the army was ordered to embark the next day. Meanwhile, the town's residents celebrated the departure. In the afternoon, English and Dutch troops assembled to cover the embarkation. Secretly, Catalan peasants prepared assault tools under Peterborough's guidance. Around 6 o'clock, grenadiers marched towards Taragona, but Peterborough changed the route towards Montjuich. The troops realized the plan and waited until daylight to attack. Peterborough divided the troops, planning to capture the outer defenses first. He arranged a reserve force under Brigadier General Stanhope. After careful planning, they silently prepared for the assault on Montjuich.|"[""1.

Shortly after dawn, Peterborough commanded his troops to advance. In high spirits and excellent order, the soldiers ascended the hill toward the fort. Irregular Spanish troops were the first to notice them and fired a quick volley as the British troops reached the crest, then retreated into the fort. The garrison swiftly manned the ramparts and met the assailants with a sharp fire. The grenadiers leading the charge leaped into the unfinished ditch, scaled the outer rampart, and engaged the defenders with pike and bayonet. The captain's detachment joined in, and a fierce battle ensued. Despite heavy losses, the British held their ground, capturing the bastion. Peterborough then directed an attack on the undefended west bastion, successfully seizing control. The defenders counterattacked, but the English forces repelled them, securing their position and turning captured guns against the fort. The battle paused as both sides fortified their positions, leading to a standoff.|['1.

The British troops, led by the brave prince, faced a sudden attack from the Spanish forces. Despite their efforts, they were overpowered, and the prince suffered a fatal wound. As chaos ensued, the British fell into disarray, prompting a retreat. However, Lord Peterborough rallied the troops, inspiring them to turn back and reclaim the lost ground. Meanwhile, the Spanish reinforcements, misled by false information, retreated towards Barcelona, leaving an opportunity for the local peasants to seize a strategic fort. Peterborough, seizing the moment, led a swift operation to position captured guns and launch a counterattack on the Spanish stronghold. This swift and strategic maneuver turned the tide of the battle, demonstrating how critical decisions can alter the course of war.|"[""1.

During the siege, the English troops worked tirelessly to position their guns and mortars, while Jack Stilwell was dispatched on horseback to request the heavy artillery from the fleet. News of the attack on Montjuich and the retreat of the Spanish forces quickly spread, drawing armed peasants to the area. The Earl strategically placed these peasants in surrounding areas to conceal the besiegers' movements and prevent enemy reconnaissance. Velasco, the Spanish commander, hesitated to counter the English assault, despite having a comparable force. The English soldiers and sailors, under Colonel Southwell's command, made remarkable progress in transporting heavy guns to Montjuich. Eventually, a well-aimed shot by Southwell breached the fortress, leading to the surrender of the Spanish defenders. Peterborough then focused on capturing the city, with soldiers and sailors collaborating effectively to advance the siege.|"['1.

During a riot, the British general Peterborough and his dragoons intervened to protect the governor and garrison from the angry mob. Peterborough bravely faced the rioters, urging them to stop their violent actions. When the mob refused to listen, the dragoons used their swords to disperse them. Peterborough also rescued a lady and gentleman, who turned out to be the Duke and Duchess of Popoli, from a dangerous situation. Separately, a young officer named Jack Stilwell found himself in a similar predicament, where he courageously saved a family from attackers by using his pistol and sword.

Jack quickly assisted the wounded man, Stilwell, and signaled for a servant to bring a drink. The servant hurried to get some cordials. Jack poured a glass and offered it to Stilwell, who slowly regained his strength after drinking it. Stilwell introduced himself as one of General Peterborough's aides de camp. He mentioned that the general had entered the town with only a few troops, reassuring Stilwell that there was no need to fear the return of the troublemakers. The news of the English troops' arrival spread, causing the rioters to disperse out of fear. Peterborough then rode back to camp to await the town's surrender. Later, the earl issued a proclamation to address grievances and ensure religious freedom. The following day, the city returned to normal, and Jack was visited by Count de Minas, who expressed gratitude for Jack's help. They then went to the count's house, where Jack met the countess, a beautiful woman still recovering from the previous day's events.|"['Question 1: What did Jack do to assist Stilwell?\nA) Brought him food\nB) Brought him water\nC) Signaled for a servant to bring a drink\nD) Called for a doctor\nE) Left him alone', 'Question 2: How did Stilwell react after drinking the cordial?\nA) He fell asleep\nB) He regained his strength\nC) He became dizzy\nD) He started coughing\nE) He became delirious', ""Question 3: Who did Stilwell reveal himself to be?\nA) The town mayor\nB) A local merchant\nC) General Peterborough's aide de camp\nD) A spy\nE) A troublemaker"", ""Question 4: Why did the rioters disperse upon hearing the news of the English troops' arrival?\nA) They wanted to welcome the troops\nB) They were afraid of the troops\nC) They were looking for a fight\nD) They were lost\nE) They wanted to cause more trouble"", 'Question 5: What did the earl do after the town returned to normal?\nA) Left the town\nB) Issued a proclamation to address grievances\nC) Started a new riot\nD) Went on a vacation\nE) Closed the town gates', 'Question 6: How did Count de Minas express gratitude to Jack?\nA) Gave him money\nB) Wrote him a letter\nC) Brought him a gift\nD) Invited him to his house\nE) Ignored him']"|"['C) Signaled for a servant to bring a drink', 'B) He regained his strength', ""C) General Peterborough's aide de camp"", 'B) They were afraid of the troops', 'B) Issued a proclamation to address grievances', 'D) Invited him to his house']"
The Countess expressed her gratitude to Jack for saving her husband and son, comparing him to an angel. Jack, feeling uncomfortable with the attention, tried to downplay his heroism as per Spanish customs. Despite the language barrier, Jack engaged in a conversation with the Count and Countess about England. The next day, rumors circulated about the population seeking revenge on Velasco. The Earl, with a show of force, safely escorted Velasco out of town. King Charles made a triumphant entry into Barcelona, where festivities ensued. Jack, as an aide de camp, was introduced as a hero but struggled with the language. He diligently studied Spanish with Scottish monks. Lord Peterborough balanced military preparations with festivities but faced challenges from the Germans and Dutch. The campaign continued as the allied fleet departed, leaving support frigates behind. Garrisons were established in various towns, with Tortosa being a key strategic location. The king reorganized the Spanish army, causing discontent by appointing Germans to top positions.|"['1.

The conquest of Barcelona united Catalonia behind King Charles, but other parts of Spain were not as successful for him. Lord Galway and General Fagel faced defeat by Marshal Tesse near Badajos, forcing the allied army to retreat into Portugal. Meanwhile, in a council of war, Lord Peterborough proposed a bold plan to split the army, aiding an insurrection in Valencia while marching the other half into Aragon. However, opposition from Brigadier General Conyngham and Dutch General Schratenbach delayed action. Peterborough, frustrated by the lack of support, decided to personally lead a risky mission to relieve the siege of San Matteo.

No warning of their arrival was given, and the soldiers reached Fraiguesa punctually, surprising the town and stationing guards at the gates. Las Torres remained unaware of the approaching English force as they neared San Matteo. Graham and Jack, exhausted from days of riding and work, had learned Spanish during their time in the country. The Earl of Peterborough, to mislead the enemy, used false messengers with letters for Colonel Jones. The letters instructed Jones to prepare for an attack, while the English troops would approach from the hills. The Earl ensured the loyalty of the messengers by holding their families hostage.

Las Torres received two letters that led to confusion and panic in the camp. Colonel Jones managed to neutralize the threat of mines set by the enemy. Meanwhile, Peterborough's forces strategically misled the enemy to believe they had a larger force than they did. Las Torres, deceived by the ruse, fled in haste. Peterborough pursued, inflicting losses on the Spanish forces. Peterborough received dispatches informing him of the dire situation in Catalonia. Despite challenges, Peterborough decided to press on to conquer Valencia with a small force, aiming to secure the region and protect the king. His bold decision surprised his officers, but he was determined to fulfill his mission and not retreat without explicit orders from the king.|"['1.

The message was serious and resolute, respectfully containing stronger words and down-to-earth advice than usual for kings. It ended with a declaration: ""I have been excluded from your consultations. Had our advancement been approved, had you trusted us... had you allowed me to march into Valencia when I urged it, without stalling me under the pretext of imaginary troop marches; had you believed me at that time, your majesty would have had not only a viceroy but the kingdom of Valencia. With the forces I have, I will march directly to Valencia. I can take no other action, leaving the outcome to fate. The time lost (against my wishes) puts me at risk, but at least I will perish honorably, deserving a better destiny.""

As evening approached, Peterborough's tired troops halted for the night. The next day, they continued their march. Las Torres, fleeing, committed atrocities in towns along the way. At Villa Real, a massacre occurred. Nules, a fortified town, was next. Las Torres, fleeing again, left behind a scene of horror. Peterborough, leading the British forces, arrived at Nules. He demanded surrender, threatening a similar fate as Villa Real if they resisted. The citizens, terrified, quickly surrendered. Peterborough's presence caused panic, leading to the town complying with his demands for provisions. Las Torres, hearing of Peterborough's preparations, retreated.

The eccentric general's joke surprised the footsore men, but their amazement turned to joy when Jack, on behalf of the earl, presented commissions to the officers as cavalry officers. The men were thrilled to find eight bodies of horses ready for their companies, including chargers for each captain and their lieutenants. The regiment mounted and rode back to town, elevated to the cavalry service. Peterborough had quietly prepared for this, gathering accouterments from Barcelona, readying nearly a thousand men at Castillon. The troops were dispersed among friendly towns, moving frequently to confuse enemies. Jack was sent to a hostile village to gauge sentiment. The villagers, though initially cautious, assured their support for King Charles. The threat of reprisal was averted, and supplies were promised for the English.|"['1.

Jack gave orders to loosen the saddle girths and secure the horses near the inn for their street duty. Pickets were placed a quarter mile apart on each side of the village. The horses were fed, and villagers watched the foreign soldiers with curiosity. After a satisfying dinner, the troop set out on a detour through various villages without encountering hostility. Despite the peaceful appearance, Jack felt uneasy due to the district's rumored tensions. He instructed the sergeant to divide the troop, keep them armed, and maintain a vigilant watch. The group left Estrella, noting the absence of men in the village. Suspicious, Jack ordered careful scouting through a narrow valley to avoid ambush.

The orders were confusing for any hidden enemies but were followed. As the corporal's group vanished, the sergeant's team entered the valley. Jack paused, allowing others to pass. Suddenly, shots rang out, and rocks tumbled down. The sergeant swiftly led his men, dodging bullets and rocks. Some were hit, but most made it through safely. After a short ride, wounds were treated. The sergeant praised Jack's decision, knowing a different route would be tricky. Jack stopped as carts blocked the way, with men behind them. With no escape, he commanded to charge through.

Jack rode his horse swiftly, trailed by troopers. Approaching the wagons, gunfire erupted, but their speed shielded them. Peasants with crude weapons tried to halt them but were swiftly defeated. Jack, unfamiliar with the area, led the group through fields and vineyards, with no road in sight. As the terrain closed in, Jack paused, realizing they might need to turn back. Spotting a grand mansion, he decided to seek shelter. Despite the hostility of the peasants, he preferred facing the mansion's owner over the locals. Inside, a man hesitated at the sight of the English uniforms but was overpowered by Jack. The countess, surprised by their arrival, intervened, recognizing Jack's past heroism.

At Vinaroz, Peterborough discovered that the Spanish troops had already entered Valencia, and some militia from Valencia and Catalonia were also moving to join him. He concentrated his forces at Castillon, where he returned quickly. His army consisted of a thousand horse and two thousand infantry, including one English and three Spanish battalions of regulars. Additionally, about three hundred armed peasants were kept separate at Almenara. Despite his accomplishments, there was still much to be done. The Duke of Arcos, with ten thousand men under his command, was marching towards Valencia, besieging the city. The magistrates of Valencia, fearing for their town, sent messengers to Peterborough for help. On February 1st, Peterborough marched from Castillon with his army, confident in victory despite their smaller numbers. Peterborough's deceptive tactics and eccentric behavior bewildered both friend and foe, but his military genius shone through.|"['1.

During a critical military operation, a clever spy tricked the Spanish general, Las Torres, into believing false information about the British army's whereabouts. The spy managed to convince Las Torres that the British were close by, causing him to hastily retreat. This deception was further reinforced when the spy led two officers into a trap set by the British dragoons, proving his credibility. Meanwhile, the British general, Peterborough, used strategic maneuvers to deceive another Spanish officer, Mahony, into surrendering a town without a fight. Through cunning tactics and false information, both the British and Spanish generals manipulated their adversaries to gain strategic advantages during the conflict.|"['1.

Peterborough's plan, though initially deceptive, took a dark turn. He tried to sow discord among the enemy by bribing a Spanish officer to switch sides, causing suspicion towards Mahony, a loyal negotiator. Peterborough's manipulative tactics led to false accusations against Mahony and a risky plan involving fake deserters. The scheme worked, driving the Spanish forces into chaos and retreat. Despite the success, Peterborough's dishonorable actions tarnished his victory. Ultimately, Mahony was cleared of treason and promoted, while Peterborough's treachery cast a shadow over his triumph as he entered Valencia in a mix of celebration and deceit.|"[""1.

After toiling tirelessly for the past two months, the soldiers were grateful for the rest they found in Valencia. The city is renowned for its vibrant atmosphere and is considered one of the most charming in all of Spain. Situated just a mile and a half from the sea, Valencia is surrounded by a lush plain adorned with vineyards, olive groves, and fruit trees. In the distance, mountains rise, their peaks often capped with snow. The city's inhabitants, known for their love of festivities, celebrated the arrival of the army that had saved them from danger with joyous events and warm hospitality extended to the earl and his officers. King Charles, impressed by Peterborough's achievements, appointed him as the captain general of all forces and granted him the authority to appoint and dismiss public officials for the cause's benefit. The earl was also named plenipotentiary at King Charles's court. Despite his active involvement in the city's revelries, Peterborough remained vigilant, aware of the imminent threats posed by enemy forces.

In a few hours, the cannons were mounted on the walls, greatly boosting the town's defense. This move thwarted Las Torres's siege plans. However, Peterborough remained vigilant. Upon hearing of the imminent arrival of four thousand Castilians to bolster Las Torres's forces, he swiftly organized a surprise expedition. At eight o'clock, Colonel Zinzendorf led troops out of the city quietly. Meanwhile, Peterborough's forces formed a barrier around the walls to prevent any leakage of their plans. The group, under Peterborough's command, aimed to intercept the Castilians before they could join Las Torres. They successfully ambushed the Castilians at Fuente de la Higuera, capturing six hundred soldiers.

Earl of Peterborough had many successful plans, except for one failure due to his unreliable Spanish allies. Both sides paused for weeks after the setback. The campaign was extraordinary, owed entirely to Peterborough's abilities. His meticulous planning and personal involvement in every expedition set him apart. He was physically strong and led by example, inspiring his troops. The troops, in turn, showed immense valor and resilience. Philip of Anjou gathered French forces to counter Peterborough's successes. The French army, led by Marshal Tesse, faced resistance in Saragossa due to his harsh methods. When Peterborough learned of Tesse's move towards Lerida, he couldn't leave Valencia but sent Captain Stilwell to aid Marquis of Cifuentes.

There was a loud laugh, settling the decision that Father Ignacio, another leader, and Jack would negotiate with the enemy. The leaders quickly dispersed to their sections, ordering a ceasefire when a white flag went up. After giving them twenty minutes to prepare, a white handkerchief was waved. Both Spanish and French gunfire halted. Jack expressed the slim chance of rescue and proposed allowing the Spanish to march out with their arms and limited ammunition under parole. The French convoy commander agreed to the terms, requesting to take wounded soldiers. The French, now fewer than a hundred, readied to march, leaving behind the dead. The Spanish peasants, angry yet controlled, divided the captured provisions among themselves. Father Ignacio invited Jack to his village for comfort, boasting of good food and aged wine.|"[""1.

Jack agreed to stay and help the priest until the next morning, warning that his soldiers might raid the village's food supplies due to their hunger. The priest assured that the larders were well-stocked and welcomed the soldiers. The group, led by Father Ignacio, diverted from the main road to the village with six wagons. Jack rode alongside the priest, curious about his involvement in fighting the French convoy. Upon reaching the village, Father Ignacio arranged for the wagons to be divided among the families. The remaining wagons were to be dismantled to avoid them falling into enemy hands. After a hearty meal, Jack inquired about the priest's motives for fighting the French, as they had not attacked the village. The priest explained the brutalities he witnessed, leading him to take up arms in defense of his people.|"[""1.

On the day of the long-awaited wedding, the village was filled with joy and celebration. The bride and groom were adorned in their finest attire, ready to begin the procession. However, the festivities were abruptly interrupted by the arrival of dragoons from Saragossa. Chaos ensued as shots were fired, and the villagers, including the bride's father and the narrator's brother, were summoned by the commander. Despite protests, the soldiers carried out a brutal act of violence, resulting in the tragic deaths of many innocent villagers. The priest, recounting the horrific events, described the heart-wrenching scene of the bride's silent despair as she witnessed her father and betrothed being mercilessly killed. The priest's plea for justice was met with indifference, leading to a deep-seated desire for vengeance among the villagers.

"""I do not say that,"" the priest replied. ""He would be well received, doubtless, simply because he is the enemy of the French; but for himself, no. We Arragonese cannot see why we should be ruled over by a foreigner; and a German king is even less desired than a French one. The connection between the two Latin nations is closer than with the Germans. Apart from the recent French army actions, Aragon would have preferred Philip to Charles. Moreover, Charles is seen as the choice of the Catalans and Valencians. There have been skirmishes between our Miquelets and those of Castile, and the border is disturbed.""

""Ah, my son, it will be long before Spaniards agree. We are half a dozen nations under one king. We hate each other like the English and Scotch did. If one part of Spain declares for a king, the other will declare against him. As long as we had great Spanish kings, things went smoothly. Now, with foreign princes, it will lead to war. Most men want a good king who respects our privileges. Tell me your direction, and I may find you a friend there for a warm welcome.""

The priest and Jack discussed the capabilities of the English general in saving Barcelona from the French soldiers. The priest doubted the general's success with fewer troops. Jack, however, had faith in the general's abilities. The priest advised Jack to leave for Valencia and join the general when needed. They bantered about rare wines stored in the priest's cellar, including a hogshead hidden behind a bricked wall. The priest, now worried about the future appreciation of his wine, realized the risk of leaving it for an unworthy successor. Jack playfully suggested the wall might fall, prompting the priest to reconsider his decisions regarding the precious wine.

Jack expressed his grave concern about a terrible idea and advised his father to open the cave during times of peace, store the wine, and enjoy it on special occasions to ensure its appreciation. The father agreed, acknowledging the wisdom in Jack's reasoning. Jack then decided to ride to Castile's borders to gauge the people's sentiments. He received a warm farewell from his host, Father Ignacio, who provided him with a letter of introduction to a priest in Arragon. Jack set off the next morning with his troopers, aiming to avoid Saragossa due to the absence of a direct mission from the earl. He encountered peaceful surroundings, spoke with locals, and learned about the region's watchfulness against potential threats. Father Ignacio's letter praised Jack's judgment and advised the priest to trust Jack's advice on critical matters, including the broaching of a hogshead of wine.|"['1.

Jack had a nice evening with the priest and got insights about the frontier situation. The priest mentioned the Castilians opposing Charles but not the French, who were disciplined until they crossed into Arragon, causing unrest. The French cavalry occasionally raided Arragon but faced armed resistance. The priest warned of the intense Castilian resistance if the English ousted the French. The next morning, Jack was awakened by shouts and French cavalry approaching. The priest feared betrayal, and French soldiers entered, mistaking Jack for the Earl of Peterborough. Jack surrendered, highlighting the uniformed capture on Arragon's soil. Shots outside prompted a French officer to hasten their departure, acknowledging mutual respect despite opposing sides. The officer criticized the Spanish and praised the English general, Peterborough, while inquiring about Jack's experiences.|"['1.

The French officer laughed, describing the general as having magical powers like flying on a broomstick and making himself invisible. Jack joined in, praising the general's tireless nature and leadership. The French officer admired the general's military tactics, especially in taking Barcelona. After three hours, they reached a town where the French officer sent a trooper to Madrid with the prisoners. In Madrid, Jack met the Duke of Berwick, who was cautious due to public unrest and sent Jack to France for his safety. The Duke acknowledged the English were not involved in attacks on officers but feared for Jack's safety in the streets. Jack was to remain in France until an exchange could be arranged.|"['1.

When the threat to Barcelona became imminent with the approach of enemy troops, King Charles acted swiftly. Orders were dispatched to recall all nearby troops, while the local populace was mobilized to gather supplies. The citizens were urgently called upon to assist in fortifying the city. In a remarkable display of unity, men, including priests and friars, armed themselves, while women and children formed groups to aid in the fortification efforts. The king received a strategic proposal from Peterborough, suggesting a bold move to Portugal to join allied forces and march on Madrid. Despite facing overwhelming odds, Peterborough and his small force strategically positioned themselves near Barcelona, ready to engage the enemy. The city's defenders, bolstered by the arrival of additional troops under Lord Donegal and Sentiman, prepared to resist the impending siege.|"['1.

When the enemy learned of the successful attempt to reinforce the town, they moved to block the eastern approach, hoping to prevent further support. However, the Earl of Peterborough was prepared. He received news that the garrison of Gerona, after leaving their town due to the Duke de Noailles' army, was trying to land near Barcelona. Acting swiftly, Peterborough led his forces to intercept the Gerona men as they arrived by boat. Safely escorting them past enemy lines, Peterborough then withdrew to the mountains. These reinforcements increased the besieged town's troops to over three thousand. The next day, a case of treason was uncovered among the Spanish garrison at Montjuich. A boy confessed to a plot to sabotage the gun matches and powder, but the plan was thwarted. Suspicions led to the replacement of the Spanish Governor. The French continued their siege, with Lord Donegal leading valiant defenses. The Miquelets also aided by harassing the French, engaging in nightly attacks. Despite facing overwhelming odds, Donegal and his men fought fiercely, repelling the enemy's advances. The situation was dire until Peterborough managed to send supplies and reinforcements, including Neapolitan troops, into the town. To further aid the town, Peterborough planned a daring attack on the enemy's camp, coordinating with the king for a combined assault from both sides. Captain Graham successfully delivered the plan to Peterborough, setting the stage for a crucial battle.|"[""1.

The British troops initially attempted to destroy a paper, but were intercepted by the French. As a result, the French were alerted to the Earl's plans and prepared for an attack. However, upon realizing the French were ready, the British troops abandoned the plan. Subsequently, Montjuich fell to the French, who launched a surprise attack and captured two bastions. The English officers, confused by the turn of events, were taken prisoner. The French continued their siege on Barcelona, causing the defenders to fortify the walls. Despite the desperate situation, the British troops eventually abandoned the castle and retreated to the city. Meanwhile, Admiral Sir John Leake and Baron Wassenaer set sail to provide relief, but faced delays due to unfavorable winds.

Jack Stilwell, bombarded with questions about the general's plans, remained tight-lipped. The colonels speculated wildly, unable to decipher the general's intentions. The possibility of attacking the French fleet seemed outrageous, but no other explanation presented itself. Despite the skepticism, Jack assured them that the general's plans always held a chance of success. As the earl awaited the English fleet, anticipation grew. The fleet's delayed arrival heightened anxiety, especially with news of the dire situation in Barcelona. Urged by the king's plea for help, the earl wasted no time in setting sail to find the fleet. Despite the shock, his officers understood the strategic importance of his mission. Joined by Jack and Captain Humphrey, the earl embarked on a risky journey to locate the fleet.|"[""1.

The troops rejoiced at the return of their general after a stormy night filled with fears for his safety. He quickly ordered about fourteen hundred men to embark and sail to Barcelona. The general, with his aides, sailed to the fleet and hoisted his flag as admiral. The French fleet spotted them, and the French forces retreated in haste. The troops landed in Barcelona, welcomed by the king and the joyous city. The French tried to maintain the siege, but Peterborough's strategic defense thwarted their efforts. The French eventually retreated in disarray. Meanwhile, Philip faced defeats elsewhere, realizing his plans in Spain had failed. The French left behind a wealth of supplies, including weapons and provisions, as they fled. The surprising turn of events at Barcelona shocked Europe and highlighted the unexpected success of the British forces against the French.|"['1.

Peterborough didn't expect to save Barcelona, but he didn't believe its fall meant defeat. He prepared for the future while leading his troops. He made the country impassable for the French army, should Barcelona fall. Peterborough's strategic measures included blocking roads with rocks, destroying roads, and fortifying towns. He ensured Philip couldn't march back to his capital. Despite facing peril, Peterborough secured each path. When Marshal Tesse retreated, Graham arrived in Barcelona. Peterborough urged King Charles to march to Madrid. However, Charles hesitated, weakening the advance force. Peterborough was dismayed by the incompetence of Lord Galway and the Portuguese generals. Their lack of action allowed Philip to regroup. Peterborough then moved to Valencia, raising a regiment and organizing them swiftly. Despite his successes, Peterborough faced jealousy and intrigue from other generals.|['1.

After much work to prepare his troops, the earl dispatched two thousand soldiers, led by Lieutenant General Wyndham, to besiege Requena and Cuenca, towns blocking the route from Valencia to Madrid. Wyndham easily took control, clearing the way for King Charles to reach Madrid with minimal escort. Despite the road being secured, Charles hesitated, citing a lack of proper attire to enter the capital. Eventually, Charles set out for Taragona but suddenly changed course for Saragossa, causing confusion among his allies. The earl, along with a council of war, decided to march the army to Madrid or Portugal. Charles later requested forces to aid the Duke of Savoy or capture the Balearic Isles, a move Peterborough declined due to Charles' ungrateful behavior. Facing opposition in Spain, Charles sought Peterborough's help, who swiftly escorted him to safety. Dissension among allied commanders weakened the army, leading to conflicts and disorganization. Peterborough offered to fight as a volunteer but was rejected, prompting his decision to assist the Duke of Savoy as ordered by Queen Anne.|"['1.

On the 11th of August, Peterborough left the camp at Guadalaxara feeling humiliated. With only 80 dragoons as an escort, he set out for Valencia with his aides Stilwell and Graham. Despite the difficulties on the road, misfortune struck King Charles after Peterborough's departure. The earl's baggage, worth eight thousand pounds, was captured by the enemy. Furious, Peterborough demanded the return of his belongings from the town of Huete. The townspeople, aided by the troopers, had taken his possessions. Despite their offer to pay for the loss, Peterborough declined. Instead, he chose corn to feed Lord Galway's army. Peterborough's act of generosity was remarkable. He continued his journey, encountering more adventures, including a massacre of English soldiers.
