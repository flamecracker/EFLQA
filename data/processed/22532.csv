The group met at 126 East Centre, just like when Josie first found Dink. The young men lounged in their chairs, while the young women fussed with their accessories. The residents at 126 changed often, but their traits remained the same. Josie arrived and rang the bell, which was old and barely worked. A resident guided Josie to Mrs. Pete, a large woman in a tight kimono. Mrs. Pete led Josie to a room vacated by a woman and her two unseen children. Mrs. Pete, with her unique appearance and mannerisms, asked Betty to show Josie the empty room on the top floor.|['1.

""Say, miss, you belie your looks. You look like these folks but you don't act like them. I've been working in this boarding house for three years and I've never had any of them give me more than a dime at a time unless it was to keep me from telling Mrs. Pete about some mischief they got into.""

The grate was piled high with old torn letters, some dumped in without being mutilated. A match had been applied to the papers but only charred the corners of the envelopes. The girl worked quickly, sorting out the letters and putting them in neat packets, saving the envelopes with legible dates and post office stamps. Every scrap of paper in the fireplace was scrutinized. What she deemed worthless was put back, ensuring the grate appeared full as before.

The nurses even said they couldn't manage without her. Polly had a nurturing nature, having looked after Peter a lot during her mother's illness and their time with Cousin Dink. ""There's something about babies that makes me happy and emotional,"" she told a nurse while holding a little baby close. Polly hoped the baby would find a loving family without ever realizing she was adopted. She dreamed of staying in the home, becoming a nurse, and caring for all the babies. Peter, on the other hand, aspired to be a policeman after a positive encounter with one. One day, visitors arrived at the Hathaway house, looking to adopt a child.

Josie, dressed as a housemaid, left the Elberta Inn with a note signed by A. Chisholm. She rang the doorbell at the Waller house, but no one answered. Josie rang again, more determined this time. Chester Hunt, a stern man, opened the door. Josie explained she asked for $12 a week for cooking and $10 for cleaning, but always got less. If she did both, she asked for $15, but was willing to work for $12 to see if he'd hire her. After securing the job, Josie hurried back to the inn.

Josie enthusiastically prepared a delicious dinner by selecting ingredients from the pantry and refrigerator. Despite the need to clean every utensil and even the china and silverware, she managed to set the table by seven o'clock. The dining experience was elevated by a bowl of violets and hyacinths from the yard, reflecting in the polished mahogany. The table, lacking clean tablecloths, was adorned with freshly washed lacy mats. Josie's meticulous service, honed from her time at the Higgledy-Piggledy tea room, impressed the master. Though she maintained a facade of dullness, her skillful execution of the meal did not go unnoticed.

We often spoke about the strong bond between us, almost like a sixth sense, so natural and vital. We relied on each other deeply, with no other family ties.

If only I had been honest, my late husband wouldn't have left me vulnerable to Hunt as his executor. Josie assured me that my children are safe and Hunt's lies won't sway me. I tried seeking help through letters, but they were intercepted by Harper. Josie's arrival brought hope, and her dedication to helping me and my children lifted my spirits. She even won the trust of the head nurse, Mrs. Stark, by her hard work and cheerful demeanor.
