Mr. Lowington's stern expression suddenly softened, leaving his face peaceful. Harry was puzzled by this change. While he was angry at Shuffles for stealing his fruit, Mr. Lowington reflected on his own rebellious past. As a young man, he caused trouble in his town until his father sent him to the navy, where discipline transformed him into a responsible officer. After inheriting his father's wealth, he retired to Brockway, where he lived happily until tragedy struck. His wife and daughter passed away from illness, leaving him grief-stricken. Alone in his sorrow, he took in his wife's orphaned niece and nephew. Despite his efforts to find purpose, he felt unfulfilled. The incident with Shuffles made him consider returning to the navy to find a new path in life.|"[""1.

Mr. Lowington, concerned about discipline at the Academy, faced a dilemma with a troublesome student named Shuffles. Despite Shuffles' bad influence, the principal, Mr. Baird, hesitated to expel him due to fear of losing other students. This decision led to chaos, with Harry being withdrawn, and more parents following suit. Mr. Lowington, realizing the deteriorating situation, advocated for discipline over consequences. Eventually, Shuffles and his accomplices were arrested for stealing peaches, but Shuffles' negative influence continued. Mr. Baird, struggling to maintain order, sought Mr. Lowington's help in restoring discipline at the Academy.

Shuffles was causing more trouble at the Academy, and Mr. Baird was unable to control him. Mr. Lowington then offered to buy the Academy, and the deal was accepted. Shuffles, feeling the pressure of authority, set fire to a haystack. After an investigation, he was found guilty, and Mr. Lowington decided to expel him. Shuffles' father was furious and threatened the school, but Mr. Lowington stood firm. Over dinner, they discussed the situation, and Mr. Shuffles came to understand the need for discipline. The expulsion was revoked, and Shuffles was put under the guidance of Mr. Lowington. Mr. Lowington shared his plan to create a nautical academy on a ship, which excited Mr. Shuffles as he believed it would benefit his son.

Mr. Lowington's innovative idea of an Academy Ship was a hit among the boys who eagerly wanted to be part of this unique educational experience, especially with the promise of a trip to Europe. Parents saw the benefits of a sea voyage for their sons without the usual drawbacks. The ship offered exercise and a healthy lifestyle for the students. The Academy Ship was not a money-making scheme but an educational experiment for wealthy students. The Brockway Academy continued under a board of trustees, with a successful teacher selected by Mr. Lowington. Gathering students from across the country was a challenge, but by April, eighty-seven boys were on board the Young America, a sturdy ship designed for educational adventures at sea. Mr. Lowington, contrary to expectations, was a warm and encouraging figure for the students, fostering a playful and jovial atmosphere on the ship.|"[""1.

"The area between the upper and lower decks on the ship is known as the between-decks. It was designed to accommodate the officers and crew. Descending the stairs, the officers' cabin was on the right side, closest to the stern, with state rooms on each side. The mizzen mast ran through the middle of the cabin. On the left side was the ""old folks' cabin,"" where teachers stayed. The steerage, serving as the schoolroom, parlor, and dining room, had berths and mess tables for the boys. Forward of the foremast were state rooms for various ship crew members and the kitchen. The ship's hold below contained water tanks, storage rooms, and supplies. The students were to operate the ship as part of their learning experience, performing tasks like handling sails, steering, and working on deck."|"['1.

By April 1st, all students had arrived on the ship, and the teachers, called professors by the boys, had settled into their state rooms. Classes were ongoing, with some students having been on board for almost a month. The ship's organization hadn't started yet, but the teachers had formed study groups, and students were reciting daily. The boys had learned rowing from the boatswain and had some basic rules for eating and sleeping. They were eager to start sailing, explore foreign ports, climb the rigging, and steer the ship. They were uncertain about the ship's plans but knew officers would be chosen based on merit. The principal announced that the next day, the ship would be officially organized, similar to a navy ship, with officers selected based on conduct, lessons, and seamanship skills.|['1.

"""Attention, students! Tomorrow morning at nine o'clock, the election will be held,"" announced the principal. ""I'm informing you now so you can think about it and even nominate candidates for the positions."" He emphasized the importance of choosing candidates based on merit rather than favoritism. The boys split into groups to discuss the nominations. Some boys vied for the captain position, causing a bit of chaos. Shuffles confidently claimed the captaincy and selected other boys for various roles. They even strategized to secure votes from others for their chosen candidates. However, they realized they needed to consider offering a position to Carnes, who held significant influence. The students, aged between fourteen and seventeen, were at the age of understanding. While some were inclined towards mischief, they were not inherently bad, just spirited and sometimes rebellious."|"[""1. What is the purpose of the principal's announcement?\nA. To cancel classes\nB.

In the group of students who were a challenge for teachers, many were honorable and wouldn't steal or harm others. They were spirited and bold, yearning for adventure like climbing mountains or exploring caves. Mr. Lowington aimed to guide these spirited students towards becoming responsible citizens. He allowed them to choose their leaders to foster obedience and unity. The students eagerly discussed the upcoming elections, with many considering Richard Carnes for captain due to his respected demeanor. Despite some students trying to manipulate the vote, Kendall was approached to run as the second master, highlighting his peers' trust in his abilities.|"['1.

"""He will not be elected, and you need not throw your vote away upon him,"" said the person pulling strings, seemingly unconcerned. The manipulator was pretending. Paul Kendall was a noble boy, already well-liked on board by both students and staff. Wilton, aware of Kendall's influence, wanted him on their side to sway others. Despite being honest, Kendall was tempted by the offer of a better cabin spot. Kendall refused to support Shuffles, even for the better spot. Wilton tried to persuade him, but Kendall stood firm. Kendall saw through the plan to sway votes against Carnes and decided to expose it. The next morning, the election results were announced, with Carnes winning.

The students had just finished electing their ship's officers. Captain Carnes was elected with cheers and congratulations. Shuffles, who had hoped to win a position, was left without an office. Mr. Lowington praised the new captain and emphasized the importance of obeying orders. He explained that future officers would be chosen based on merit, not elections. The officers were then led to their cabins, where they were assigned rooms based on their ranks. Mr. Lowington stressed the significance of discipline and the separation between officers and crew. The after cabin was kept exclusive for officers to maintain order and respect.

The officers quickly emerged dressed in their uniforms, consisting of a blue frock coat and pants, adorned with brass buttons. Each wore a cap with a gold band. While the uniforms were similar, the insignia denoted their ranks. Captain had two anchors, first lieutenant had one anchor with four stars, second lieutenant had an anchor with three stars, third lieutenant had one star on each side of the anchor, and the fourth lieutenant had one star below the anchor. The masters had stars on their shoulder-straps, with the first master having four stars and the fourth having one. Pursers' ranks were shown by the outline of parallelograms. The midshipmen had gilt numbers on their straps. The students drew lots for their berths, lockers, and mess table seats. Despite initial dissatisfaction, the principal did not allow changes. The crew was mustered, saluted the ensign, and had dinner. The crew was divided into starboard and port watches based on their numbers.|"['Question 1: What denoted the ranks of the officers in the text?\nA) Brass buttons\nB) Cap with a gold band\nC) Uniform color\nD) Insignia\nE) Frock coat', ""Question 2: How were the masters' ranks indicated in the text?\nA) Anchors with stars\nB) Shoulder-straps with stars\nC) Parallelograms\nD) Gilt numbers\nE) Cap with a gold band"", ""Question 3: What was the method used to show the pursers' ranks?\nA) Anchors with stars\nB) Shoulder-straps with stars\nC) Parallelograms\nD) Gilt numbers\nE) Cap with a gold band"", ""Question 4: How were the midshipmen's ranks displayed in the text?\nA) Anchors with stars\nB) Shoulder-straps with stars\nC) Parallelograms\nD) Gilt numbers\nE) Cap with a gold band"", 'Question 5: What did the crew do after being mustered in the text?\nA) Saluted the ensign\nB) Changed their uniforms\nC) Dined\nD) Drew lots for berths\nE) Divided into starboard and port watches', 'Question 6: How was the crew divided in the text?\nA) By uniform color\nB) By numbers\nC) By rank\nD) By dinner preferences\nE) By drawing lots']"|['D) Insignia', 'B) Shoulder-straps with stars', 'C) Parallelograms', 'D) Gilt numbers', 'A) Saluted the ensign', 'B) By numbers']
After dividing into two parts, the students were instructed to put on their uniforms immediately. Each group, led by an instructor, descended to the steerage where the head steward and assistants had arranged their clothing. The uniform included blue seaman's pants, a heavy flannel shirt, and various accessories like jackets, hats, shirts, pants, socks, and shoes. The boys were guided to wear their everyday uniform and store the remaining clothes in their lockers. Tailors were present to ensure proper fitting, with all clothes numbered by size. Soon, the students emerged dressed in their new attire, looking like seasoned sailors. The frocks had distinctive anchors on the collar, and the students struggled to tie the sailor's knot correctly. Boatswain Peaks and other experienced sailors helped with adjusting the attire. Following Mr. Lowington's instructions, the students' shore suits were packed and stored at his house. Fully dressed in their sea attire, the students embraced the sailor's lifestyle, even adopting the characteristic gait and language.|"[""1.

The crew trained for a month before attempting to set multiple sails simultaneously. Officers knew their orders well after daily practice since the start. Petty officers were appointed and had begun to understand their duties. The boys eagerly awaited going on a cruise on the Young America to see the vast Atlantic waves. Despite their anticipation, they were occupied with ship duties and studies, making time pass swiftly. Continuous practice had made them decent sailors, and ship discipline was maintained. The young officers started leading maneuvers and giving orders as promised by Mr. Lowington. The ship's first lieutenant was in charge, with the second lieutenant on the forecastle, the third in the waist, and the fourth on the quarter deck. Orders were relayed among officers with return reports, executed promptly albeit with some mistakes. Mr. Lowington praised the crew for their skill in making sail. The crew underwent examinations and reviews by the end of June, with most officers retaining their positions through diligent study. However, Robert Shuffles surprisingly earned a promotion, causing a reshuffle in officer positions. Three after cabin occupants moved to the steerage, while three crew members were promoted to the officers' quarters.|"['1.

At the Brockway Academy, a daring plan was hatched by Wilton and his cohorts to escape in the boats while the professors were at supper. The goal was to reach the shore before the boats could be hoisted up to the davits at sunset. Wilton missed his partner in mischief, Shuffles, who had reformed and become a third lieutenant. Despite doubts from others like Monroe, the plan moved forward with recruits joining for various reasons, from seeking adventure to simply enjoying mischief. Each recruit was assigned a specific role in the operation. Wilton, determined to carry out the plan, even threatened Shuffles to keep him from interfering.

Wilton and Monroe led the daring escape plan by sliding down the painters from the swinging boom into the boats below. The rest of the boys followed suit, descending cautiously to avoid detection. Shuffles, the officer of the deck, caught wind of the scheme and swiftly took action to thwart their getaway. As the last boy was about to slide down into the boat, Shuffles released the topping-lift, causing the boom to drop into the water, foiling their plan. Despite the setback, Wilton and Monroe remained determined to reach the shore. The pursuit ensued, with the first cutter closing in on the fleeing boys. Shuffles cleverly navigated the chase, anticipating their misstep towards a shallow bar. The thrilling pursuit continued as the boats raced towards the cove's entrance.|"[""1.

The third lieutenant, Wilton, found himself in a challenging situation as he attempted to evade capture by the disciplined crew led by Shuffles. The two boats, the first cutter and the professors' barge, engaged in a comical but intense struggle as each side fought to outmaneuver the other. Despite the odds stacked against him, Shuffles, known for his fighting spirit, cleverly managed to drag the barge sideways, causing the oars to tangle with Monroe's boat. The arrival of Mr. Lowington, the principal, swiftly put an end to the spectacle. His mere presence commanded respect and obedience, effectively diffusing the tension among the students.

The troublemakers surrendered without further resistance as the principal's presence quelled any defiance. They obediently rowed back to the ship under his watchful eye. Mr. Fluxion, following orders, joined Monroe's boat, with the other boats trailing behind. This act of rebellion was a first for the ship's crew, leaving the students curious about the consequences. Surprisingly, Shuffles, known for mischief, unwittingly foiled the escape plan. Punishments were swiftly handed out by Mr. Lowington, marking the ringleaders and others for their misconduct.

When the ship set sail, the captain hadn't yet chosen the destinations or the duration of the voyage. The plan was to navigate based on circumstances. The ship was meant to visit various ports, staying for a few days or weeks at each, depending on the progress of the students and the ship's needs. Many seamanship skills like heaving the log and steering couldn't be practiced while anchored. The boys were taught the theory but needed practical experience. The instructor and crew were in high demand once the ship was underway. The boys eventually took over the helm under supervision until they became proficient. They learned to gauge the ship's speed by heaving the log. The log-line, marked in knots, was used along with a half-minute glass to measure the ship's speed. This practical experience was crucial for the students' understanding of navigation.|"[""1.

"On a ship, measuring speed is crucial for navigation. A knot on the log-line is always fifty-one feet, indicating the ship's hourly speed. The log-line is run out for half a minute, equating to an hour at sea. The Young America used ten fathoms of ""stray line"" to clear the ship's wake. The line had marks every fifty-one feet for speed checks. The ship reached Race Point, forty miles from Brockway, making ten knots an hour. The crew practiced heaving the log until proficient. After anchoring at Provincetown Harbor, the ship was open for visitors, with boat races and fireworks. The next day, the ship set sail for Brockway again.

Mr. Lowington believed Shuffles had discussed a mutiny while in the steerage, but he saw no immediate threat of it happening. He grasped Shuffles' motives and was willing to let him succeed or fail on his own merits. The ship anchored, the band went ashore, and the Fourth of July festivities concluded. Studies resumed the next day, and life on board continued as usual. The ship embarked on a cruise to the east, spending a week in major ports. The crew adapted to ship life, avoiding seasickness, and maintaining regular studies. When winter approached, stoves were installed, and the ship sailed southward to escape the cold. By March, the crew had become proficient seamen and excelled in their studies. The boys were disciplined, healthy, and physically fit due to a balanced routine of study, ship duties, and gymnastics. They studied various subjects and excelled without the distractions of land-based institutions.

The gentle wind filled the sails as the ship sailed at a leisurely pace of six knots, swaying in the ocean's long swell. Most of the boys had little to do except gaze at the disappearing shores of their homeland. While some felt sentimental, many were excited about the adventures awaiting them on the other side of the ocean. The principal and professors wondered if the students would focus on their studies amid the crossing and the bustling cities ahead. The teachers, including John Paradyme, Richard Modelle, Charles C. Mapps, James E. Fluxion, Abraham Carboy, and Adolph Badois, were dedicated to ensuring the students' success based on their diligence and behavior.

Shuffles, a former ship officer, faced discipline for refusing orders. Despite his struggles, he was eventually subdued and put in irons. The principal, Mr. Lowington, maintained discipline even though Shuffles had shown signs of reform. The incident was the first severe disciplinary action on the ship and shocked the students. Shuffles was then confined in the brig, a small prison-like room under the main ladder. The brig, previously used for storage, was now prepared to hold Shuffles.

"When the bell rang eight times to set the watch, most of the boys who were not on duty headed to the steerage. While some went to bed, the excitement of the moment kept others awake. They gathered in small groups to discuss the upcoming voyage and the tasks assigned to them as outlined in the watch schedule.

Meanwhile, Shuffles remained seated on a stool in the brig, still upset. His irons had been removed when his supper was brought to him by the steward, but he refused to eat. Concerned about the situation, Mr. Agneau, the chaplain, visited Shuffles later in the evening in an attempt to have a meaningful conversation with him. Despite the initial resistance, Shuffles eventually expressed remorse for his actions and acknowledged his wrongdoing.

The kind chaplain believed Shuffles was in a good state of mind and wished to speak with him about important matters in better conditions. However, Shuffles held him back. The chaplain assured Shuffles that forgiving him would bring more relief to him than to the chaplain. The chaplain questioned if Shuffles still believed he was treated unfairly regarding office distribution. Shuffles admitted to his mistake and how his anger clouded his judgment, leading to disobedience. The chaplain warned against the dangers of drinking and threw away the bottles of wine found in Shuffles' possession. As the ship headed to Queenstown, the chaplain informed Mr. Lowington of the situation, emphasizing the seriousness of allowing students to drink.

""Don't blame yourself, Mr. Agneau. You have been dedicated in your efforts,"" the principal reassured. ""In a large group of young men, we can expect to see vices and misdeeds. Our ship was designed to address these challenges. I anticipate encountering misbehavior, even wrongdoing, among the boys. Those who are troubled need help, not those who are well. These boys actually behave better on the ship than they did at the academies they attended. For instance, Pelham, now the fourth lieutenant, was quite troublesome in his New York school.

Mr. Lowington, the principal, decided to take a strict stance against gambling among the students. He proposed that all money be surrendered to him, with receipts issued for each amount handed over. This action was taken to prevent further gambling activities on board the ship.

At supper time, a plan was hatched to lock the professors in their cabin by securing the doors. Shuffles was confident of success but Wilton was cautious, wanting to know all the details before acting. Despite objections, a group planned to seek revenge for being mistreated. Grimme and Sanborn discussed their dissatisfaction and plotted to pour oil on Lowington, but Shuffles refused to participate in such dirty tricks. The ship's crew divided into groups, passing the time with stories and discussions. Mischief was common, with belaying pins and paint pots mysteriously falling on unpopular officers. Grimme had an oil can, planning to pour it on Lowington during dinner, but Shuffles refused to be part of it.|"[""1.

The League's purpose was clarified, and three new recruits were swiftly enlisted before the next group of sailors took over their shift. Despite some objections from the crew, most members were willing to comply with the rules. However, Augustus Pelham, a senior officer, was not content with the new order and refused to cooperate. Shuffles, the captain, recognized Pelham's discontent and saw an opportunity to use it to his advantage in gaining more support for the League. The group was pleased with their progress, and each new member was tasked with recruiting another, with strict rules in place to avoid detection. As the wind picked up, Pelham's attitude towards the captain became increasingly strained.

The boys witnessed a gale at sea for the first time, leaving a strong impression on them. The ship, Young America, battled heavy winds, causing it to lean dangerously. Enormous waves crashed against the ship, drenching the deck. Safety precautions were taken promptly to secure the ship and protect the crew. Mr. Lowington, the experienced leader, closely monitored the situation, knowing accidents were likely. The students, some frightened and some enjoying the thrill, were kept safe by the officers during the storm. Commands were shouted to manage the sails and ensure the safety of all on board. The crew worked diligently to reef the sails and reduce the impact of the wind. The tense atmosphere was filled with excitement and danger, making it a challenging but memorable experience.|"['1.

"The Young America's topsails had three reef bands with strings called reef points for tying them up when reefed. Single reefing used the first row of points, double reefing the second, and close reefing the third. Each side of the sail had a cringle at the end of each reef band to secure the reef pendent. The reef tackle, a rope passing through a block at the yard's end to the mast, helped raise the sail for reefing. Seamen had to ""lay out"" on the yards to tie up the sail safely using foot-ropes. Mousing the horses secured the foot-ropes to prevent slipping. The fife-rail at each mast held belaying pins for securing various ropes. In the dark and storm, sailors had to find the right lines quickly. Thirty young sailors climbed the shrouds to the topsail yards to take two reefs, with midshipmen supervising. They executed the maneuver despite the challenging conditions."|"[""1.

The crew on the ship faced a wild gale at sea for the first time, finding the ocean and winds grand and sublime. Despite the challenging conditions, the ship, Young America, behaved admirably, with the crew managing the helm effortlessly. The ship, though rolling and plunging, maintained its course well after reefing the sails. Mr. Lowington, the principal, and Mr. Fluxion commended the crew's behavior. However, Augustus Pelham, a lieutenant, felt slighted and rebellious due to a reprimand for breaking a ship rule. His roommate, Goodwin, disapproved of Pelham's smoking, especially during the storm, which could make him sick.

Goodwin, a third lieutenant, struggled to find a comfortable place to sleep on the ship due to the heavy rolling and pitching. He attempted to inform the principal about Pelham's misconduct but hesitated. Many officers faced similar challenges trying to stay in their berths. Mr. Lowington, understanding the situation, sent stewards to help secure the boys in their berths to prevent falls. Jacobs, the steward, wedged occupants in their berths with clothing to provide stability. Pelham, defiantly smoking a cigar in his room, was surprised when the principal caught him. Pelham obeyed out of fear of punishment. The storm intensified, making study impossible. The ship was secured under a close-reefed main-topsail to weather the heavy gale safely.|"['1.

"When a ship is laying to in a storm, the main focus is on keeping the vessel safe and facing the sea head-on. In a fierce gale, the Young America ship positioned itself with its port bow towards the wind at a 45-degree angle. The topsail yard was adjusted to align with the direction of the wind, and the helm was maneuvered to maintain this position. The ship didn't make much progress but drifted along with the waves. The crew, including young sailors, faced a tough day's work in challenging conditions. They had to hold on tight due to the ship's intense rolling, making it impossible to cook. They could only have coffee and ""hard tack"" for sustenance. It's crucial to teach young individuals that even minor mistakes can have significant consequences. Overindulgence can spoil children more than strict discipline. The story highlights a rebellious crew member, Pelham, who joins a scheme to challenge the ship's authority. Despite the stormy weather, the crew managed to navigate through the challenges and eventually spotted another ship in the distance, creating a sense of camaraderie among sailors at sea."|"['1.

There were other ships at sea, but none as strong as the Young America, which had proven its resilience in a recent storm. The principal of the Academy Ship believed the students were safer on board than on land. During a Sunday service, a distant ship in distress was spotted, its masts destroyed. The crew of the Young America, full of sympathy, watched the sinking vessel. The principal ordered signals to be fired to show they had been seen. Despite the crew's impatience to see the wreck up close, they attended a moving service, praying for those in peril at sea.

The life-boats, the barge, and the gig were prepared for launch. These boats were equipped with life-lines and floats for safety. Lowering the boats into the rough sea was a challenging task. The professors' barge and gig were successfully lowered into the water. Passengers, including women and children, were safely transferred from the wreck to the life-boats.

The Young America sailed on a course from Cape Race to Cape Clear, navigating with precision. Shuffles and his allies, part of the Chain League, plotted to take control of the ship.

Shuffles was more direct in his approach, revealing the risks involved, while Pelham focused on grievances and monetary concerns. Both concealed the true number of members in the League from each other.
