Reddy Fox resided with Granny Fox, part of a sizable family that Mother Fox struggled to feed. To ease the burden, Reddy went to live with Granny, the wisest fox around.

Every day, Granny Fox took Reddy Fox to the long railroad bridge to help him conquer his fear of it.

Reddy Fox, taught by Granny Fox, felt wise and important. Boasting his intelligence on the Green Meadows, Blacky the Crow grew tired. Reddy, challenged by Blacky, planned to trick Bowser the Hound.

"It is not good to think too highly of oneself. Reddy Fox had this bad habit. Whenever Bowser the Hound was mentioned, Reddy would boast, ""It's easy to fool him."" As Reddy grew bolder, he began raiding Farmer Brown's henyard despite traps set by the farmer. This made Unc' Billy Possum and Jimmy Skunk avoid the henhouse, missing the fresh eggs and blaming Reddy. Jimmy Skunk hoped Farmer Brown's boy would catch Reddy. Reddy, feeling smart, liked to show off. He got so bold that he snatched Farmer Brown's boy's pet chicken right under Bowser's nose.

Boasting and showing off often lead to trouble. Reddy Fox, known for his bragging, was disliked by many in the meadow and forest. When he got into trouble, no one felt sorry for him.
