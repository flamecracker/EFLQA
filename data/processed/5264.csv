Lora and Daisy discussed the upcoming float, with Lora admiring Daisy's outfit for the role of the Spirit of the Sea. Despite Daisy's reluctance, Patty offered to take on the part. Patty, feeling tired from the storm exposure, had lunch in her room. Daisy, seemingly serious, asked Patty to write a note declining the role, which Patty did. However, Patty found the situation silly and decided not to dwell on it. After getting ready, Patty joined a group for tea on the veranda, where she was warmly welcomed and chose to sit next to Farnsworth in a swing.|"[""1.

"Bill whispered to Patty, ""You apple blossom! I hope you'll be the Spirit of the Sea for the parade."" Patty hesitated, waiting for Guy to ask her officially. With Lora and Daisy out, Patty knew the role might fall to her. The Spring Beach group buzzed about the upcoming event, with floats representing rivers like the Nile, the Hudson, the Tiber, the Thames, the Seine, and more. Daisy tried to convince Guy to choose her, but he declined, mentioning a note from Patty. Guy decided not to ask Patty about the role, respecting her wishes.

"""Alright, Daisy,"" Patty responded calmly, with no hint of disappointment on her face. She did feel a pang of regret, as Guy had initially asked her, but she had hesitated out of kindness towards Lora, who also wanted the part. Patty was not one to hold grudges, and she accepted that Guy believed Daisy was better suited for the role.

""I'll handle Mr. Martin,"" Jack interjected brusquely. ""I'll explain that I've taken over Patty's role in the show. Hey Patty, how about we dress up as Dutch children on the Holland Float?""

Patty reflected on her reflection in the mirror, scolding herself, ""Patty Fairfield, you're being foolish to feel upset about not being chosen as the Spirit of the Sea!

"""Hey there, why so shy?"" Patty inquired, swiftly shutting his sketch-book as she approached. ""Are you afraid of me, little ol' me? Who wouldn't hurt a fly? Or is it that I'm not worthy to lay eyes on a masterpiece by one of our most promising young artists?""

""I'd rather you not see this sketch until it's done,"" Cromer replied honestly. ""It's going to be quite lovely, but right now, it looks a bit rough. Can I sketch you, Miss Fairfield, may I?""

""Sure, I'll pose,"" Patty agreed cheerfully. ""And in return, can you help me decide on a role for the Pageant? I want something picturesque, not just a background character.""

""I think you're perfect for the Maid of the Mist role on the Niagara Float,"" Cromer suggested. ""With your natural beauty and grace, you'll be stunning in misty grey tulle and silver wings.""

""Don't be silly,"" Cromer continued, ""You have the ideal look for it. Your coloring is like a true Romney painting. I'm speaking in general terms, not personally. Please don't take offense.""

In a jolly manner, Bill thanked Baby May's mother for the dance and humorously requested another one for the next morning. He then asked Mrs. Kenerley to help him find Miss Fairfield, teasingly mentioning that Patty should know better than to trust him. With a parting joke, Bill left and met Guy Martin on the veranda. Guy explained that Patty had declined a role in the Pageant and asked him not to mention it. Bill expressed his dismay to Mona, feeling upset that Daisy had taken Patty's place.

"Bill, please don't cause a commotion. I understand your bold way of speaking, but Spring Beach society doesn't appreciate such behavior. What's troubling you, Bill? Let's talk it out calmly."" Bill's serious expression hinted at a more intense discussion than his initial outburst. Despite this, he changed the subject and engaged Mona in conversation about her role in the Pageant. Patty's boudoir overlooked a charming part of the veranda, shielded from the sun by awnings. Whenever Patty sat at her desk by the bay window, Bill often passed by. On this occasion, Bill's demeanor was different. ""Come outside,"" he said earnestly. Patty joined him, and he held her hands, looking directly into her eyes. Patty realized Daisy had falsely implicated her by giving Guy a note. Despite this betrayal, Patty chose not to expose Daisy's deceit. Daisy, feeling guilty, entered the arbor where Bill confronted her with a lowered voice.

Patty and Daisy found themselves in a tricky situation. Bill suspected Daisy of some mischievous behavior involving a note, but Patty, being kind-hearted, forgave Daisy even before she apologized.

Patty made a deal with Daisy. She agreed to keep their secret safe and let Guy believe that she sent the note but changed her mind. Patty wanted to avoid any drama and asked not to disclose the truth to anyone, not even Mona. Cromer, the architect, suggested a brunette for the Maid of the Mist role but left the decision to them. Patty forgave Daisy for her deceit, understanding it was a sudden impulse. The night of the Pageant was perfect with bright stars and a cool ocean breeze.

Patty looked stunning in her Neptune costume, wearing a silver star-crowned headpiece and a graceful silver filigree crown.

"The floats in the parade were all well-crafted, with some even more artistically impressive than others. Each float received enthusiastic applause as it made its way down the route. The entire town of Spring Beach was aglow with lights, and the residents were out in full force to admire the spectacle.

""Do you want to know what they'd think?"" asked Farnsworth, eagerly. ""They'd see you as old Neptune's Queen, ready to reign by his side forever. Let them believe that, Patty, and let it become true! Will you, my apple blossom girl?""

""No, Bill,"" Patty replied calmly, shifting her position to avoid facing him directly. His words had surprised her, and she felt a pang of regret that he had expressed his feelings so openly. But she quickly realized she needed to maintain a carefree demeanor for the onlookers.

Farnsworth understood the situation and flashed a warm smile at Patty, encouraging her to hold on to the wave prop securely.

Farnsworth thanked the lady for her kind words and asked her to enjoy the moon a bit longer before heading to bed. He mentioned that perhaps he would see her later.

Rugs and chairs were added to make the game area cozy. The ""Players"" decorated their ""Homes"" with tables, flowers, and palms. The game involved throwing dice and moving counters along the paths. The goal was to reach the central square for a refreshing drink. The guests had a great time playing the game. After the game, the guests left, impressed by the fun they had. Farnsworth then surprised Patty by hiding her in a dumb-waiter and taking her to the station to see him off before joining the others at the Country Club.
