"""Oh, Alice! Be cautious! Watch out!"" exclaimed the other person in the cozy room, a space made comfortable by the tastefully decorated items within it, rather than its location or the place itself. The younger girl, without opening her eyes, interjected, ""It's an old hat now! It's ruined anyway. Water from the parlor scene, where Mr. Bunn spilled the goldfish bowl, splattered on it, and the stains won't come out."" ""It's fine. Mr. Pertell will get me a new one. He said the company should, especially since I did so well in the burning room scene the other day. There!"" and she playfully tapped her hat. ""Ruth DeVere--Lady Clarissa--Se√±orita Alamondi!

In creating movies, a team similar to a theater group comes together. Instead of performing in front of an audience, the acts are recorded with a camera and a director. Some scenes are shot outdoors, while most are filmed in a studio under bright lights. The action is captured on a strip of film, which is later developed in a darkroom. From this master film, copies are made for projection. Recently, Mr. DeVere had a vivid dream about a shipwreck scene for an upcoming marine drama. Despite his reservations, financial concerns push him to continue with the project. The team is preparing to film the preliminary scenes at sea with the help of experienced sailors. They must arrive early at the studio the next day to begin this exciting new project.|"['1.

The father expressed regret, admitting he shouldn't have brought up the topic. The studio was bustling with activity the next day, filming various scenes simultaneously. Ruth and Alice, along with their father, Mr. Pertell, the manager, observed a sailor being instructed for a scene. The sailor objected to the script, refusing to engage in stealing. The studio was meticulous, ensuring no disruptions during filming to avoid costly reshoots. Russ Dalwood tried to halt the sailor, but the sailor continued to move through the set. Just as the sailor approached a camera, a Wild West scene with cowboys quarreling provided a timely distraction. The filming process involves shooting scenes out of order, later piecing them together to create a cohesive story. A cowboy firing a blank shot interrupted the sailor's unintended walk into a different scene.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a sailor named Jack Jepson shared a thrilling tale with Ruth and Alice. Jack preferred to be called Jack instead of Mister, finding it more natural. He recounted his days as a second mate on a five-masted schooner bound for South America. The journey took a dangerous turn near the Hole in the Wall, where rumors of mutiny among the crew surfaced. The sailors demanded better conditions, leading to chaos. Jack found himself in a precarious situation, forced to choose between joining the mutineers or facing a perilous fate. As tensions escalated, a rough character named Mike Tullane intervened to save the captain's life. The story unfolded with a dramatic struggle for control of the ship off the coast of Anegada, a British island in the West Indies.|"['1.

One night, the captain and Mike Tullane vanished mysteriously from the ship. Some crew members suspected a betrayal and wanted to make Mike walk the plank. Jack explained that they were last seen talking in the cabin before disappearing without a trace. The crew couldn't find them on the boat or near land, leading to a puzzling mystery.

A genuine schooner has been acquired for a purposeful shipwreck scene. The vessel, named the _Mary Ellen_, though not in the best condition, will serve well for our needs. Despite the high cost, it is deemed worthwhile for the dramatic storm scenes. The decision to delay the play rehearsal allows us to inspect and familiarize ourselves with the ship's layout. However, a crew member, Jack, reveals his past involvement in a mutiny, leaving him under suspicion and unable to enter English ports. The hope of clearing his name lies in finding the real mutineers or evidence. The _Mary Ellen_ is mentioned, triggering a glimmer of hope that it might be connected to the mutiny, though it is considered unlikely by the manager. The vessel is being readied for filming in Southern waters, with scenes both aboard and around her to be captured. A visit to the ship in Erie Basin is planned to prepare for the upcoming sea drama, with the manager expressing the importance of the DeVere family's involvement despite potential health risks.|"['1.

"""No, I think so myself,"" the elderly actor confessed. ""It may even do me good. I will doctor up in the meantime. And I realize that if I do not go, my daughters cannot. I would not like to have them miss this fine opportunity.""

Mr. Pertell noticed that the other productions in the studio were progressing smoothly and then prepared to escort Mr. DeVere, his daughters, and the elderly sailor over to Erie Basin to examine the _Mary Ellen_ as she was being readied for another sea journey--her final one--before being submerged for the film.

""This is the fifth time we've done that act,"" Paul whispered to Alice as she passed. ""And all because Mr. Bunn is so fussy. They'll take him out, if he isn't careful. Where are you going, Alice?""

The _Mary Ellen_ did not look very neat as the small group boarded her at the dock in Erie Basin. The decks were cluttered with ropes, planks, casks, boxes, and other items, making it challenging to move around. Upon seeing the vessel, Jack Jepson's face displayed anticipation.

""Yes, I know, Miss Alice. But, masts or no masts, there's something about this craft that's strangely familiar. I'm sure I've been on her before, and yet--no, it can't be--three masts can't make five, no matter how you count.""

The captain of the ship, the _Mary Ellen_, briefly showed concern but quickly regained his composure. He then smiled and questioned a sailor named Jack Jepson, who was introduced as one of the mates for their upcoming voyage. The captain seemed preoccupied with the preparations for the trip and instructed the crew to hasten their tasks. He acknowledged Jepson's offer to help and expressed his doubts about the expenses involved in fitting out the ship just for sinking it for a film. Despite the captain's reservations, Mr. Pertell assured him that they would recover the costs if the film was successful. Mr. Pertell then mentioned bringing some actors to familiarize themselves with the ship, including Jepson, who had initially hesitated but was now willing to assist.|"[""1.

"""It's quite interesting to think that Captain Brisco might have known you,"" remarked Mr. Pertell, as Alice, Ruth, and Mr. DeVere observed the preparations for the ship _Mary Ellen_ to set sail. ""It's not strange at all,"" replied Captain Brisco. ""I've commanded many ships and crews in my time, so my name might be familiar to many sailors. Though I don't recall ever meeting this Jepson before, he appears to be a decent man."" As the captain and manager found a quiet spot to discuss their plans, Alice and Ruth explored the ship.

While aboard the ship, plans were set in motion to capture the initial scenes of the maritime story. Mr. Pertell encouraged Captain Brisco to expedite the preparations for the journey. The Captain admitted that some repairs on the ship were not done properly, but reassured that it wouldn't affect their short voyage. He revealed that a powerful motorboat named the _Ajax_ would accompany the _Mary Ellen_ during filming, trailing behind to capture distant shots. After a rehearsal, Sailor Jack was relieved to only be needed for scenes in the second act and eagerly agreed to assist Captain Brisco aboard the ship. Ruth and Alice helped Sailor Jack overcome his concerns about acting in the film.

During the transition from Spring to Summer, the girls reveled in the changing seasons, enjoying the outdoors. They also cherished Winter, with its snowy landscapes perfect for photography. Excitement grew as they anticipated the _Mary Ellen's_ final voyage, even though it would end in a sinking. The schooner's refurbishment progressed swiftly, with the girls and their friends visiting to witness the transformation. On a special day, the theatrical group, including Jack Jepson, headed to the seacoast by a hired tug for filming. Amid rocky shores, caves, and smuggler chases, Ruth and Alice faced challenges.

Alice slipped and hurt her ankle during the play. Ruth, her sister, quickly noticed and asked if she was hurt. The manager, though kind, knew the show must go on.

Mr. DeVere and the actors were rehearsing their roles at an old fisherman's hut by the beach. The producer often seizes unexpected opportunities during filming, like changing scenes on the spot to improve the movie. Adjustments are made to fit the setting better, using chance incidents creatively. The crew faced challenges with wind and spray affecting the filming process, but it added realism to the scenes. They prepared for a scene on the far rocks, where a close-up shot would be taken. The actors, including Alice, were ready for their scene on a rocky ledge by the bay.

Alice, a puzzle enthusiast since childhood, was intrigued by the mysterious interactions between Captain Brisco, Jack Jepson, and a new man aboard the schooner. She noticed Jack's fear of recognition yet eagerness to identify the newcomer, sparking suspicions of a mutiny connection. While Alice pondered, the crew prepared for the voyage. Mr. DeVere, Ruth's father, wore a scarf for a sore throat. As the ship set sail, the commander assigned tasks, including inspecting the bitts. Alice found it strange how the captain treated the supposed common sailor as an equal. Meanwhile, Ruth discussed preparing for upcoming scenes with Alice.

The shipwreck plan involved some crew members jumping overboard for a rescue mission using small boats or the motorboat Ajax, with Russ capturing the scenes on film. Ruth and Alice shared a cozy cabin with two bunks, near their father, while other crew members had scattered rooms. Hen Lacomb's status intrigued Alice when she saw him moving aft, indicating he was treated as an officer. The schooner sailed to the warm West Indian waters for filming. Alice refrained from asking Jack about the location to avoid prying. As the crew prepared for filming on a sunny day, a sudden lurch caused a commotion.

Captain Brisco quickly ordered the ship to turn into the wind. A sailor threw a life-ring overboard and helped Lacomb lower the boat to rescue Jack. Russ assured the girls there were no sharks around to calm them. The sailors rowed towards Jack, who was exhausted but safe. Luckily, no sharks appeared, allowing the rescue to go smoothly. Jack was lifted into the boat just in time. Miss Dixon, still upset, went back to her cabin. Jack explained the accident to Mr. Pertell, who reassured him it wasn't his fault.

Russ acknowledged being too thrilled to consider the situation. He anticipated the arrival of rescue supplies soon, making this incident less eventful. Sympathizing with Jack, Russ wondered about the experience of falling overboard. The captain remarked that accidents occur, but not always with fortunate outcomes. Jack resumed his duties unaffected, but his behavior left Alice unsettled. She pondered the mysterious circumstances, suspecting foul play involving Lacomb. Struggling with unanswered questions, Alice refrained from discussing her concerns. The filming of crucial ship scenes commenced, engaging everyone. Alice hesitated to approach Jack, wary of arousing suspicion. Ruth observed a change in Alice's demeanor, attributing it to the demanding filming process.

Alice observed the captain's lack of interest in the film actors' work as he discussed the ship's operations with Mr. Pertell. The ship was close to small islands that could serve as backdrops for scenes in their movie. The captain emphasized the importance of preventing scurvy among sailors by providing lime juice and potatoes. He shared his concerns about being recognized by English authorities due to past charges against him.

The sailor assured Alice that the ship they were on was the old _Halcyon_, known during the mutiny. He mentioned that others onboard knew it too. However, he warned Alice to be quiet as there was a game afoot, hinting at a plot involving Captain Brisco and a friendly man. Jack expressed concern that the approaching British steamer might recognize them despite changing their appearance. As the steamer neared, an officer hailed the _Mary Ellen_, accusing Jack of being someone they were looking for. Jack, stationed as the lookout, couldn't abandon his post.

Captain Brisco adamantly refused, leaving Alice feeling conflicted. Despite a moment of warmth towards him, doubts crept in as she noticed his insincere expression while talking aside to Hen Lacomb. The captain's frustration grew as a storm brewed, darkening the sky and unsettling the sea. Concerns arose about Jack being targeted due to a past mutiny. Alice suspected a hidden secret between Captain Brisco and Hen Lacomb, fearing Jack's knowledge.

"""No, I'll take my medicine!"" said Jack sternly. ""Might as well finish it. This has been hanging over me for years, and I'll be relieved when it's done. It's terrible for an innocent man.""

""Maybe we can find a way to help you,"" suggested Alice. ""I'll talk to my father. He knows lawyers in New York who can help. Stay calm, Jack, we'll support you.""

""Maybe you're right,"" sighed her friend. They stopped fixing their appearance in mirrors hidden in their bags, waiting to see if it was necessary.

The events on the _Mary Ellen_ were swift. Transformed into a sailing ship, it carried a group of filmmakers and a sailor accused of mutiny. Now, facing a hurricane, the old schooner raced ahead. The accusation against Jack Jepson was forgotten for now.

""Quickly, everyone!"" shouted Captain Brisco. ""Storms here are serious. Secure the ship, reef the sails, and keep passengers below.""

The commotion on the deck gradually quieted down, signaling the end of the immediate danger. The actors and actresses from the movie crew gathered around Alice, eager to hear her account of the accident. Alice tactfully avoided mentioning her own frightening experience, planning to thank Jack later. She didn't want to worry her father, who was struggling with a sore throat due to the salty air. On deck, Captain Brisco and Jack Jepson took control until the wreckage was cleared. The ship, _Mary Ellen_, now looked nothing like its former self. As the storm eased slightly, some crew members went above deck only to retreat, pale-faced at the sight of the damaged mainmast. A massive wave hit the ship, causing it to sway dramatically. Jack bravely confronted the captain, urging everyone to abandon ship due to its sinking state. Captain Brisco, taken aback by Jack's boldness, eventually relented, appointing new mates to assist in the crisis.|"[""1.
