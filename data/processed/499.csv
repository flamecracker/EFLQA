The wind sang louder, and the vessel pitched violently. The crew secured the ship, and life lines were set up for safety. As the storm escalated, panic spread among the passengers. The vessel weathered the storm, avoiding danger. After two days, the weather cleared. Despite cargo shifting and a deckhand lost overboard, they arrived safely in Puerto Cortes. Plans were made to venture into the wilds of Honduras, debating between mule-back or boat travel to Kurzon in the Copan valley. Professor Bumper arranged for transportation, considering the comfort and speed of boat travel over the rough roads.|['1.

Under Val Jacinto's guidance, the travelers were advised to journey up the river for about fifty miles. Canoes would be used until that point, where mules would then carry most of the baggage and equipment to the Copan valley. Professor Bumper planned to excavate the buried city and had hired Indian diggers for help. The group would canoe during cooler parts of the day, camping on shore at night. The Indians were unbothered by insects and would sometimes light smudge fires. The travelers left behind civilization as the river narrowed, passing by Indian huts and rubber forests. An alligator briefly surfaced, showcasing its sharp teeth. Lunch was served at noon, and the party resumed canoeing in the afternoon, energized by the rhythmic chants of the Indians.|['1.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, the group hurried to set up camp near the river in the dense tropical forest. The guide warned of the impending mosquito attack, urging everyone to quickly prepare for the night. Tents were raised, smudge fires lit, and supper hastily cooked. As darkness enveloped the camp, Tom and Ned ventured towards the river. Suddenly, Ned spotted a looming shadow approaching. Though initially startled, Tom remained composed. Ned described the shadow as a dark, silent presence with a wild beast-like odor, reminiscent of a previous jungle encounter. Despite the eerie atmosphere, Tom reassured Ned, attributing the encounter to nerves and suggesting they retreat to the safety of their mosquito nets.|"['1.

Ned and Tom, two young explorers, found themselves in the jungle with Professor Bumper and Mr. Damon. The camp was set up with separate tents for everyone. Mr. Damon was surprised to see them but relieved they were safe. The professor had made the camp cozy with folding cots and a small electric light. As night fell, the jungle noises surrounded them. Ned had a strange dream that felt too real, but he was comforted by the guide's words. Suddenly, a scream woke everyone in the camp. Tom used a flashlight and saw a mysterious shadow in the tent. With a quick strike, he subdued the creature. The night was filled with mystery and unexpected events, leaving the group on edge.|['1.

The young men rushed out of their tents to find Professor Bumper and Mr. Damon ahead of them. Armed with clubs, the two men were fighting off bats in the dim light of the campfires set by the Indians. The bats were swarming around, flying low and posing a threat to both the Indians and travelers. The group devised a plan to blind the bats with lights and strike them down with clubs. The Spanish guide explained the danger of the vampire bats, capable of killing large animals by sucking their blood. The travelers managed to fend off the bats, ensuring the safety of the camp.

After breakfast, as the Indians prepared the canoes, Professor Bumper, who had visited Central America before, examined some large dead bats. These bats were huge, almost as big as hawks, and belonged to the _Desmodidae_ sub-family. The professor explained that these were blood-sucking bats, pointing to their nose-leaves as their sucking apparatus. He mentioned that these bats could weaken and even kill animals like steers or mules by extracting blood with their sharp teeth. The Indians were fearful of these bats, believing they could harm them while they slept. Professor Bumper discussed the upcoming journey to Copan for excavations, mentioning the possibility of finding ancient temples and idols. During their river journey, Tom and Ned encountered alligators, and tragically, one of the Indians fell overboard and was attacked by the reptiles despite efforts to save him.|"['1.

The mishap put a slight damper on the celebration, leaving the Indians feeling somber. Professor Bumper assured the man's family would be cared for, easing tensions, especially for one of the brothers present. Despite minor mishaps like a storm, the rest of the river journey was uneventful. On the third day, they camped by the riverbank. The next morning, Tom realized they overslept. The canoes and the Indians were gone, with a note explaining that Jacinto had led them astray as he was bound to guide another expedition. He had put a harmless sedative in their tea to ensure they wouldn't follow. The group was left in the wilderness but with enough supplies to survive until help arrived.|"[""1.

Professor Bumper, Tom, and their companions embarked on an expedition deep into the jungle, determined to outsmart their rival Beecher. Despite being tricked by Beecher's guide Jacinto, they decided to press on towards the nearest Indian village. Professor Bumper, an experienced traveler, had packed their supplies in small, portable packages. Tom Swift's electric rifle was chosen as their primary weapon for hunting game along the way. With light hearts and a determined spirit, they set off, blazing a trail through the wilderness for the Indians to follow.

Tom, the young inventor, had a close call when his finger accidentally triggered the electric rifle, narrowly missing a native Indian emerging from the bush. Startled, the man was about to flee, but Tom quickly reassured him, realizing the man's importance in guiding them to a nearby village. The man, named Tolpec, explained that he returned to help after Tom's attempt to save his brother's life. Tolpec revealed that Jacinto, who had deserted them, was a fraud, and many Indians were willing to stay but were misled. Tolpec's gratitude led him to pledge his loyalty to Tom and the group.

Tom believed that Beecher had deliberately tried to mislead them by sending an Indian guide to divert their journey. The guide suggested they return to retrieve their belongings and camp for the night while he fetched porters. Tom agreed, emphasizing the importance of their supplies. The group journeyed back through the jungle at night, guided by the Indian's sharp vision and aided by pocket lights. They heard jungle noises but remained safe. Upon reaching their belongings, they set up camp and had a meal. The guide, Tolpec, left to get help, and some doubted his return. Professor Bumper encouraged trust, believing Tolpec's intentions were genuine. He felt confident that their quest for the hidden city and the golden idol was still on track, even if Tolpec's loyalty was uncertain. They decided to wait and see how events unfolded.|"['1.

Ned's words stirred unease among his friends, though they tried to appear nonchalant while waiting at camp. Tom acknowledged the challenge facing Tolpec in persuading the natives to return, especially with Jacinto's influence. With only waiting and hoping left, the group armed themselves and ventured into the jungle. Professor Bumper collected specimens, while Ned and Tom refrained from shooting unnecessarily. Suddenly, Mr. Damon's cry alarmed them. Expecting a tiger, they found a menacing giant iguana instead. Despite its frightful appearance, iguanas are harmless.

"Later, after supper was finished and the camp tidied up, Tom, Ned, Mr. Damon, and Professor Bumper gathered in the scientist's tent. A lamp provided enough light for them to see maps and papers spread out on a makeshift table. ""Gentlemen,"" began Professor Bumper, ""I've called you here to discuss my plans in more detail now that we are on the ground. I need to be specific about our mission to find the lost city of Kurzon and the golden idol. Unexpected challenges require us to adapt our approach."" The professor shared ancient documents and maps detailing the city's location in the Copan valley. He explained the significance of the gold idol and the historical context of the Mayan civilization that once thrived in the region. The group discussed the need for caution due to potential rivals and the delicate nature of their excavation work."|"['1.

"""Yes,"" agreed the teacher. ""It's likely that Kurzon, the city we're searching for, lay buried for about five hundred years before Columbus arrived in San Salvadore. The writing and architecture we've found so far suggest this. Deciphering the Mayan pictographs is quite challenging. At present, we can only interpret their calendars and numerical system, but we're slowly progressing."" The professor continued, ""There's always the possibility of error, especially when excavating a city buried deep beneath earth and trees. We'll dig shafts in various places. Discovering carved stones, ancient pottery, weapons, or building remnants will confirm we're on the right path.""

Leaving the busy scene, the group proceeded to the tent in search of a missing map. Despite a thorough search, the document was nowhere to be found. The scientist, in need of the map for their work, decided to confront Professor Beecher's camp for its return. As they were about to depart, Tom had an idea. He suggested a bluff to confuse their rivals. Instead of digging where the map indicated, they would dig elsewhere to mislead Professor Beecher's party. By doing so, they hoped to outsmart their rivals and gain an advantage in their search for the treasure.|"['1.

The professor and his team were on an expedition to find a buried city. They had a map, but they pretended to dig in the wrong spot to confuse their rivals. Meanwhile, the Beecher party watched from a distance. The professor explained that artifacts are objects made by ancient civilizations. He hoped to find inscriptions that would guide them to the city. While Tom and Ned were hunting, they heard a scream. A jaguar was attacking an Indian. Tom aimed his electric rifle to save the man without harming him. The jaguar sensed danger and looked around nervously. Tom prepared to take the shot to protect the man from the wild animal.|['1.

Suddenly, the jaguar noticed Ned and Tom behind the bushes. Tom, known for his accuracy, aimed the electric rifle. The shot hit the jaguar's throat and chest, bringing it down. Ned, relieved, wanted to rush to the wounded man, but Tom insisted on giving the jaguar one more shot to ensure it was no longer a threat. After confirming the jaguar was dead, they turned their attention to the injured man, Tal. Tal, a local hired to assist with excavations near their camp, had been attacked by the jaguar while visiting his family. Tom and Ned tended to Tal's wounds and offered to help him back to his village. Tal explained he was hired to aid in the excavation, delayed for unknown reasons. Grateful for their help, Tal shared his story with Tom and Ned in broken Spanish and gestures.|"['1.

Tom instructed Ned to take the mysterious package home and care for it. He promised to have Professor Bumper tend to Ned's scratches properly. The bandages were only a temporary fix. As they walked back to the native's hut, Tom and Ned received affection from Tal's family and the other natives. Tom expressed his dislike for the situation, but admired the blowgun hanging on the wall. He asked Tal to make him a similar one with arrows as a keepsake. Tal revealed that the package was found by Valdez in Tom's camp, thinking it contained gold.

Tal responded, even though he might not have understood all of Tom's words, as they were a mix of Spanish and English. The Indian also had some knowledge of English. Tal explained how Valdez, upon finding no gold, became furious and burned the yellow silk papers with strange marks, suspecting them to be evil charms. Tal salvaged the silk to protect his arrows from rain. Tom declined the offer, realizing the map was gone, leading to disappointment. Tom and Ned decided to inform the professor, as the map was crucial to finding an old buried city.

Tom explained that the ancient legends passed down through generations by word of mouth could be more accurate than written records. He expressed hope that the old Indian, Goosal, might have valuable information about a buried city. Tal, Goosal's grandson-in-law, shared that Goosal was knowledgeable about old stories and legends. The group decided to bring Professor Bumper, who could understand the Indian dialect, to speak directly with Goosal. They wanted to learn where to start excavating for the city. To keep their plans secret from rival camps, they began a new excavation shaft. Goosal then recounted an ancient legend to Professor Bumper about a hidden city near a mountain that he had learned from his grandfather during a journey through the jungle when he was young.|['1.

Goosal, though afraid, was guided through a vast cavern to another one, larger than the first. Inside, he discovered the remains of an ancient city belonging to a powerful tribe, the Mayas. Excited by this discovery, Tom and his friends returned to camp to plan their journey. The group prepared for a trip into the jungle led by Goosal. Despite Tal's injuries, the old man remained strong and took charge of the digging gangs at the camp. The travelers, accompanied by mules carrying supplies, embarked on a challenging trail through the jungle. Along the way, they faced hardships, including treacherous paths and fierce mosquitoes. During the night, a bear approached their camp, leading to an unexpected feast. Eventually, the group stumbled upon a hidden opening in the rock, sparking curiosity and anticipation.|['1.

"""Wait,"" said the professor, concerned about the air quality. They tested it, but the torch thrown by an Indian burned steadily, showing it was safe. They prepared to enter the cavern, equipped with torches and battery lamps for light. Initially hesitant, the Indians followed Goosal and the group inside.

As they stood at the entrance of the cave, a fierce storm raged outside. The wind swept down the rocky trail, rain poured from the cliffs, and thunder and lightning filled the sky. Tom and his friends hesitated, but Professor Bumper urged them to venture out. Despite the downpour, they decided to brave the storm, determined to reach the lost city. The rain intensified, turning the trail into a rushing river. Loose stones and earth began to slide down the mountain. The group pressed forward, leaving their mules behind.

Excitedly and nervously, the small group moved ahead using pocket electric lamps. They were fixated on two things - what they might discover and the urgency to help their competitors. As they advanced through the artificially made tunnel, the air remained fresh, and a gentle breeze blew towards them. Professor Bumper noted that the upward slope suggested it led deep into the mountain where the Beecher party might be. Suddenly, they saw a massive stone door swing open, revealing a passage. Goosal had found the hidden mechanism. Passing through, they entered a vast cavern that was once a city, now in ruins. Despite the destruction, the central area was well-preserved. The group marveled at the ancient stone buildings, archways, temples, and statues, giving them a glimpse into the past civilization.

In the underground city, a group of explorers found a strange solid gold idol that resembled a mix of a toad and a gila monster. The idol had big red eyes that shone like rubies. The explorers were amazed by their discovery, but their excitement was interrupted by approaching torch-bearers.
