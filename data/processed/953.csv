Tom Swift was in his lab working on a puzzling invention when a loud knock on the door startled him. It was Koku, his giant helper, with his usual over-the-top knock. Tom, amused, asked Koku if he thought he had to wake up the whole neighborhood. Tom had sent Koku to remove an engine from an airship without using a chain hoist. He hoped there wasn't another fight between Koku and Eradicate, his other helper. The rivalry between the two was due to their desire to serve Tom best. Tom appreciated Koku's strength but reminded him to be gentle with his power.|"['1.

Professor Bumper and the group arrived in Lima, the capital of Peru, which was a fascinating city built on an arid plain. Despite its desert-like surroundings, the city was transformed into a beautiful place through irrigation. The contractor explained that Lima had a diverse population of over 150,000, with many residents being of African or indigenous descent but affluent enough to afford what they needed. The city boasted two steam railroads connecting to Callao and an additional line running 130 miles into the interior, crossing the Andes at a high elevation. The group then set off to Rimac to test Tom Swift's explosive in a tunnel project. Professor Bumper revealed his hope of finding a lost city, guided by vague golden tablets, in the Andes Mountains.

Tom pondered as he strolled back and forth, determined to uncover the hidden passage where the Indians vanished. Convinced they escaped through a tunnel hole, he searched meticulously. Disguised and with minimal duties, Tom scoured for any concealed exit. Certain it must be a secret natural fissure, he scrutinized the rock walls. While overseeing the natives, Tom noticed Serato observing him. With Tim's help, Tom investigated the missing men's families but found no leads. Puzzled by the involvement of Blakeson & Grinder, Tom persisted in his search. Resting on a ledge, Tom drifted off, only to wake abruptly to a mysterious voice and the unexpected appearance of Waddington's face in the tunnel wall.|"['1.

Tom quickly sat up and bumped his head on a rock, causing him to see stars. The vision of Waddington faded, leaving only the bare rock wall. Rubbing his head, Tom saw Serato, the foreman. The next day, Tom resumed his role as an explosive expert, becoming suspicious of Serato. He decided to investigate by collecting rock samples. While walking with Koku, they encountered an Indian woman gathering herbs. Suddenly, the woman's infant was threatened by a condor. Tom used his electric rifle to save the child, and the woman gratefully thanked him. She knelt and kissed Tom's hand, expressing her gratitude.|"['1.

An Indian man emerged from the bushes, recognized by the woman as her husband and one of the tunnel workers. After a brief exchange, the man thanked Tom for saving their baby from a condor mistaking it for prey. Tom learned about the massive size of the Andean condor, with a wingspan of nearly ten feet. He recalled an incident at the Bronx Zoo where a condor's powerful wings caused a commotion. Tom reflected on the event, realizing the importance of his quick action to protect the baby. Despite challenges in the tunnel work, Tom made adjustments to improve efficiency.

The scientist invited Tom and Mr. Damon on a new journey to a distant fertile valley where a unique tribe of Indians resided. Although Tom was occupied, Mr. Damon agreed to go. The expedition faced challenges, including losing their way and encountering hostile indigenous people. Despite efforts to approach the valley, the professor and his team could only reach its boundaries. The foreman shared that fifteen workers had vanished mysteriously. The tunnel work was paused for inspection, but no clues were found. Job decided to increase supervision and hire a new workforce. Despite searching in various Indian villages, the missing workers were not located. The striking workers refused to return despite efforts to persuade them.|"['1.

Job Titus and his brother tried to argue that the tunnel was safe, but a native worker questioned this. Despite extensive inquiries, no evidence of foul play by Blakeson & Grinder was found. Labor shortages halted tunnel work, even with powerful explosives ready. Attempts to recruit workers failed. Tom encountered a native woman who thanked him for saving her child from a condor. She hinted at a secret about the tunnel but her husband was fearful. Leading Tom, Mr. Damon, and Koku up a mountain trail, she indicated they should follow.

Masni suddenly halted in a narrow gorge, scanning the cliffs with her sharp eyes. She discovered a hidden path through tangled vines leading down a V-shaped crack in the cliff. Tom hesitated, fearing it might be a trap. As they descended, they found themselves peering through a crack in a sheer stone cliff into a valley with Indian huts. Tom realized they had come through the same rock they were now looking down on. Masni led them towards a tunnel entrance, revealing a metal block that opened the way into the tunnel. Tom recognized the spot where he had seen Waddington's face before. The hidden passage seemed to connect to the tunnel, raising questions about how the men had escaped.|"['1.

Tom and his team made a surprising discovery in the tunnel. They found a hidden rope that led to an escape route through a secret valley. Tom realized that their rivals, Blakeson & Grinder, had been using this secret shaft to make their workers disappear and create fear among the remaining laborers. The missing men were lured away and kept in hiding to maintain the mystery. Tom devised a plan to bring back the missing workers, break the curse, and uncover the truth behind the scheme. With the help of Masni, an Indian woman, they learned about another entrance to the valley.

Tom advised closing the shaft to avoid detection, especially by the bearded man. Masni demonstrated the mechanism that operated the stone. Tom recognized it as a counter-balanced rock, possibly created by ancient Indian tribes for ceremonies. Events progressed swiftly as Tom shared the secret with the Titus brothers. Masni guided them to a hidden valley. The missing tunnel workers returned, revitalized, boosting morale. Despite threats and rewards, their helper remained anonymous. Tom set up a light to expose any hidden faces. The tunnel work resumed, but more challenges arose. A blast revealed tough rock, hindering progress. Job Titus worried about meeting the contract deadline. Tom experimented with the rock but faced disappointing results. The situation seemed dire, with the project at risk of failing.|['1.

In mining operations, the choice of explosive is crucial. Quick-burning explosives work well in softer rock but can't pulverize hard rock. Gentle tapping with a smaller hammer can create vibrations that break hard rock into small pieces, ideal for tunneling. Despite setbacks and financial challenges from rival firms, Tom Swift persisted with his powder experiments with help from Mr. Damon. Tom's determination to uncover the hidden city of Pelone drove him to explore new territories, accompanied by his loyal group. The professor, focused on discovering the ancient city, showed little interest in the tunneling efforts.

Tom and his friends discovered a mysterious shaft in the mountain, hoping it would lead to the missing Pelone. However, it turned out to be an old mine with a sealed door, possibly for ancient rituals. The Indian tunnel workers, who had vanished, returned to work peacefully. Tom experimented with a new explosive to break rocks slowly. He tested it outside the tunnel, away from the camp, with Koku, a giant, ready to help. When the explosive went off, Koku barely escaped the powerful blast, causing the ground to shake. The group watched in amazement as the slow-burning powder created a controlled explosion, disintegrating the rocks.|"['1.

The boulder appeared to lift itself into the air and shattered into numerous pieces upon landing. Koku leaped away just in time to avoid the flying fragments that crashed onto the hut's roof. Tom remarked that Koku might have survived the initial explosion but would have been shaken up later. The giant, realizing the danger he had escaped, ran into the tunnel in disbelief. The successful experiment led Tom to produce more of the explosive needed to break the hard rock in the tunnel. Job Titus decided to hire additional workers, emphasizing the need for swift progress to meet the contract deadline. Serato was instructed to recruit more workers, specifically strong ones like Koku. One day, Serato introduced Lamos, an Indian giant broader than Koku, to assist in the tunnel work.
