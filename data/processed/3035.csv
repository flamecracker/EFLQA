"Chapter I: The Secession Movement

The secession movement had three stages. It began with news of Lincoln's election and ended with Federal troops taking Fort Sumter. During this time, the lower South discussed secession while the upper South pondered its response. South Carolina was the first to hold a convention, followed by Congress. The House formed a committee to address the country's state. Southern members sent an address to their constituents, expressing that the Republicans were unlikely to satisfy the South. They believed a Southern Confederacy was necessary. Notable statesmen like Judah P. Benjamin and Jefferson Davis supported this view. Alabama and Mississippi delegates urged South Carolina to lead the secession for the safety and unity of the Southern states."|['1.

Ten years ago, during the failed secession attempts of 1850 and 1851, Andrew Pickens Butler, a prominent South Carolinian, opposed the movement despite his desire for secession. He argued against it to prevent dividing the Southern States. Robert Barnwell Rhett led the secession advocates, but Butler believed that forcing a state into secession against its will would only create reluctant allies. Despite Butler's efforts, secession gained momentum. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina successfully seceded. Meanwhile, in Georgia, the secession debate raged. Governor Brown hesitated due to President Buchanan's alleged promise not to alter military positions in Charleston. However, when news broke that Anderson had moved troops to Sumter, Governor Brown seized Fort Pulaski, marking the beginning of Georgia's secession. This event signaled a shift in sentiment among previously hesitant citizens towards secession.|"[""1.

A belief that Washington had begun to act aggressively spread through the lower South. State conventions were held in quick succession: Mississippi on January 9, Florida on January 10, Alabama on January 11, Georgia on January 19, Louisiana on January 26, and Texas on February 1, passing ordinances of secession. Georgia saw a strong opposition from Unionists, including Stephens and Toombs. The debate was not about the right to secede, which virtually no one disputed, but about the wisdom of doing so. Despite efforts to delay secession, the majority voted in favor. Stephens emphasized his allegiance to Georgia over the United States. The radicals in Alabama and Texas were eager to secede without delay, despite some attempts at conservative resistance. The Confederate States of America were swiftly organized, adopting a Constitution similar to the United States with some changes. Davis became President, and Stephens Vice-President. Army recruitment began, and diplomatic efforts were made to negotiate treaties and sway Virginia to join the Confederacy.|['1.

"The document created in 1861, similar to the Constitution of 1787, omitted key principles. The right of secession, a fundamental idea of the revolution, was absent. Despite the States being declared sovereign, the new Confederation was deemed ""permanent."" The new Constitution, apart from three exceptions, mostly mirrored the 1787 Constitution with some changes. The upper South faced a dilemma, torn between sympathizing with seceding States and desiring to preserve the Union while maintaining local autonomy. Virginia and North Carolina, though not wanting to secede, resisted coercion. The failure to reconcile the principles of freedom and strength led to the tragic Civil War. Virginia's attempt at a Peace Convention failed to prevent the inevitable secession, with Virginia being the linchpin. The upper South eventually seceded, culminating in the outbreak of war after the firing on Fort Sumter."|"['1.

Sumter marked a crucial moment in history. The sound of the first cannon aimed at the fortress is iconic. The debate over who gave the order to fire rages on. The South Carolina authorities sought advice from the Confederate leaders when they learned of Lincoln's plan to resupply the fort. Despite warnings, the decision was made to demand Sumter's surrender. General Beauregard, in charge of the Charleston militia, was instructed to make the demand. As tensions mounted, a telegram hinted at a Federal force coming to reinforce Sumter. Beauregard, convinced of Federal deception, demanded surrender on April 11th. Anderson, in Sumter, refused immediately but hinted at a looming surrender due to dwindling supplies. As the night passed without action, anxious crowds dispersed. Reports of a Federal ship near the harbor prompted a late-night visit to Sumter, resulting in an ultimatum for surrender or face bombardment.|"[""1.

The council of the aides at Sumter is a captivating detail that has intrigued historians, leading them to indulge in a literary interpretation. The scene of four young men holding the fate of a people in their hands, at a crucial moment, is so intense that it tempts artistic embellishment. However, the incident raises questions about its historical accuracy. Did the young men act without clear instructions? Was their meeting merely a confirmation of their intended actions? The account of a fiery Virginian, Roger A. Pryor, adds drama to the story. The dawn of April 12, 1861, marked the beginning of the conflict at Sumter. Charleston, with its preserved charm, witnessed the bombardment with crowds gathering at East Battery to watch the spectacle unfold. The city's skyline and the fortifications at Sumter created a picturesque backdrop for the unfolding events.|"['1.

On a stormy Friday night, the harbor was bustling despite the rain. The wind howled as the cannons roared at Sumter. The morning after the duel resumed, Sumter's walls crumbled, and flames engulfed the barracks. Anderson, defiant, refused to surrender even as the flag was shot down and raised again. The fort was ablaze from red-hot shots, and the magazine was at risk. Finally, Anderson raised a white flag after a valiant but futile last stand. Negotiations led to the garrison's safe removal. The next day, the harbor gleamed under the spring sun as Charleston celebrated the fort's evacuation. Decked boats filled the water, and crowds gathered to witness history unfold.|"['1.

The selection of Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederacy remains a mystery. Davis did not aspire to the role and preferred a military career. Fate led him to reluctantly accept the presidency, a move that seemed tragic. Other candidates like Rhett and Toombs were initially considered, but the sudden shift to Davis puzzled many. Despite the disappointment, Rhett showed grace at Davis's inauguration. The trio's differing viewpoints hinted at future conflicts, which soon surfaced. Yancey, a key figure in the Confederacy's formation, lost influence and turned against Davis. Rhett's discontent with not being appointed to the State Department led to opposition. While Davis may have erred in handling Rhett, their fundamental differences made a lasting alliance unlikely. Rhett became a prominent figure in the opposition, showcasing his intellect and independence.|"['1.

The leaders of secession in the South were divided into moderates and conservatives, with the government favoring the former over the latter. Davis and Stephens were considered moderate, while Toombs, a secessionist, was seen as moderate compared to others. Benjamin, an Attorney-General, differed from extremists. The new government's personnel favored conservatism over radicalism. The South was divided between those aware of the region as a whole and those who were not. South Carolina, with a long history, valued the state as an object of veneration. In contrast, Mississippi, a younger state, had leaders born outside, speaking the language of state rights but lacking an emotional connection to the state ideal. The Southwest had an ideal of Southern life common to all, emphasizing country life, hospitality, and an aristocratic system.|"['1.

The feeling of Southern identity, distinct from state rights, shaped the young community in the Southwest, where Jefferson Davis spent his formative years. Coming from a newly wealthy family, he began as a West Point cadet, served bravely on the frontier, and left the military for love. Returning home as a wealthy planter, he embraced Mississippi life, entered politics with a soldier's spirit, and championed state rights while fostering a sense of Southern nationalism. As President, Davis sought to unite the South's military might, facing criticism for a perceived lack of aggression. Despite challenges, the Confederacy made strides under his leadership, culminating in a Confederate victory at the Battle of Manassas. Davis faced internal and external pressures, with the Confederate capital moving to Richmond. Amid growing unrest, Davis acknowledged the gravity of the conflict but remained resolute in his belief in the South's ultimate success.|"['1.

The Southern President, Davis, expressed serious concern about the army's composition and the short enlistment terms. He feared that losses at Roanoke Island and Fort Donelson were exaggerated, leading to a potential reduction in forces. With only 340,250 men, the Confederacy faced overwhelming Northern armies. Davis proposed conscription of white males aged 18-35 for three years, a move met with approval. This marked a shift towards centralizing military control and was seen as essential for success, despite some opposition. Davis aimed to establish a strong government to ensure victory, prioritizing unity over State autonomy. The Conscription Act faced legal challenges but was ultimately upheld by state courts, solidifying Davis's authority in military matters.|"[""1.

Davis opened a conflict between State and Confederate authority, sparking the formation of an opposition party. The opposition tried to control the Cabinet, blaming Secretary Benjamin for military failures. Congress even motioned for Benjamin's removal. To protect his friend, Davis moved Benjamin to the State Department. Despite facing opposition, Davis used martial law to combat criminal activity in Richmond. The Administration made political arrests, fueling criticism. Although facing challenges, Davis managed the situation well. The months following April 1862 were a tough period, with threats of evacuation and significant losses. Davis also mourned the death of a close friend in battle.

"A true portrait of President Davis during the height of his power showcased his determination and strategic abilities. He organized and equipped armies, fortified Richmond, and supported his appointed commander, Lee, during the Army of the Potomac's retreat after the victory at Second Manassas. This victorious period marked a bright spot in Confederate history. The Administration's robust military strategy led to powerful Confederate armies, inspired by Lee's successes. The peak of hope was the planned triple offensive in August 1862: Lee invading Maryland, Bragg invading Kentucky, and Van Dorn challenging Federal forces in the Southwest. The goal was to influence Northern elections, reclaim territories, and shift the tide against the Lincoln Government. Despite financial challenges, the illusion that ""Cotton is King"" persisted until harsh realities set in with events like the surrender of Fort Donelson."|"['1.

"During the first year of Confederate foreign affairs, the South had to buy various goods from Europe, such as arms, cloth, and machinery. Christopher G. Memminger, the Confederate Secretary of the Treasury, faced the challenge of establishing the new government's foreign credit. A significant aspect of this period was a commercial campaign between Federal and Confederate agents to control the European munitions market. Despite facing challenges due to credit issues, the Confederate agents managed to secure contracts for items like rifles. To fund these purchases, the Confederacy relied on seizing specie from the Southern branch of the U.S. Mint and Southern banks, as well as a loan and a direct tax. However, the Confederacy also resorted to issuing paper money, leading to its depreciation and causing financial hardships for government workers and soldiers. The North also concentrated naval forces to control Southern ports, affecting trade relations with Europe. To alleviate the congestion of cotton in Southern ports, the Confederate Congress introduced the ""hundred million loan."" This was the first in a series of ""produce loans"" where bonds were exchanged for produce or manufactured goods."|"['1.

In 1861, despite the concerns of plantation owners, the belief in King Cotton's dominance remained strong. The Confederate leaders seemed unfazed by the blockade that year, viewing it as beneficial. They saw it as a way to boost manufacturing through protective tariffs and to pressure England by cutting off cotton exports. Laws were passed to restrict cotton exports, and planters were advised to hold onto their cotton. In 1862, there was hope in the Confederacy, with Mason receiving support in England. However, the tide turned against the Confederacy due to the Emancipation Proclamation and military setbacks. The cotton shortage in England caused distress, leading to failed financial schemes. Ultimately, the support of British workers for the North helped prevent foreign intervention in the American Civil War.|"[""1.

The downfall of King Cotton was marked by the comparative failure of the Erlanger loan. Despite the cotton famine, King Cotton could not sway English workingmen due to their opposition to slavery. The Confederacy's inability to control the cotton export reflected King Cotton's diminishing power. The blockade led to India and Egypt emerging as new cotton exporters. The popular sentiment in the South shifted from alarm to a grim distrust towards the Confederate Administration. Criticisms against President Davis included slow army equipment and secrecy in Congress. General Van Dorn's suppression of newspapers fueled discontent. Yancey called for more transparency from the Confederate Government to address the lack of information among the people. The Government's secrecy was seen as a blunder, leading to growing distrust and discontent among the population.|"[""1.

"During the Civil War, there was a lack of transparency in the Confederate Administration's efforts to secure arms from Europe. The Charleston Mercury criticized the government for delays, but the truth was that they were quicker than the Union in sending agents abroad. Despite this, the country remained unaware of these facts. The government paper, the Courier, did not address the accusations directly, instead offering general praise for President Jefferson Davis. The Mercury and Courier engaged in a heated debate, mirroring similar conflicts in Richmond between the Enquirer and the Examiner. The Examiner was known for its fierce attacks, with writer Edward A. Pollard standing out for his extreme views. Pollard's book, ""The First Year of the War,"" blamed Davis for various failures, portraying him as arrogant and incompetent.

During the Civil War, there was internal criticism within the Confederate Government. Pollard accused the government of not enforcing the conscription law properly. The Examiner and the Mercury supported President Davis on conscription but criticized his handling of it. This opposition stemmed from a lack of transparency by the government and issues of state sovereignty. Georgia's Governor, Joseph E. Brown, even compared the conscription acts to an attack on constitutional liberty. By the autumn of 1862, discontent was rising, partly due to the government's secrecy. President Davis, while possessing good qualities, lacked flexibility and humor, which affected his leadership during the war. His health issues and dogmatic nature also contributed to his challenges as a leader.|"['1.

It was a significant part of Davis's journey to stand alongside a brilliant leader like Lee without recognizing his genius. Davis, however, never truly grasped Lee's exceptional character, despite their amicable relationship during the Seven Days' Battles. Davis's unwavering faith in his own abilities led him to believe that together with Lee, they could achieve victory. Despite Davis's limited military experience, he compared himself to Lee, who had a far more distinguished military career. Davis's leadership style lacked the charisma and influence that Lee possessed. His choices in personnel, like his confidence in Bragg, were questioned by later military analysts. The Cabinet members under Davis also faced criticism for not meeting the demands of the time. One unique figure was Judah P. Benjamin, a Jew from the West Indies, who had a remarkable legal and political career. Benjamin's intellect and adaptability made him a standout, yet his tenure was marred by controversies. Davis's unwavering loyalty to Benjamin, despite opposition, reflected his commitment to those he trusted. Davis's presidency faced challenges due to his focus on government efficiency rather than building popular support. This approach may have contributed to his administration's unpopularity and the eventual crisis they faced.|"[""1.

During the autumn and winter of 1862, the focus shifted from war disputes to concerns about State sovereignty and the leadership of Davis. In South Carolina, the idea of a state army was proposed to counter the Confederate Government's military policy. Rhett, a prominent figure, opposed the plan due to changing circumstances and military necessity. The contrasting attitudes in South Carolina and Georgia highlighted the divisions within the Confederacy. The political landscape was complex, with Virginia and its neighboring States having distinct perspectives due to varied experiences. South Carolina's pragmatic approach contrasted with Georgia's firm stance on state sovereignty. The Brown faction in Georgia vehemently opposed conscription, viewing it as an infringement on State rights. The differences in political views and responses to wartime challenges underscored the diverse dynamics within the Confederacy.|"['1.

During the Civil War, the Confederate military faced challenges with recruitment and supply shortages. Generals like Lee struggled to maintain troop numbers, while Governor Vance of North Carolina expressed discontent over soldiers being led by officers from other states. The Confederacy also grappled with rising prices due to scarcity, leading to heartless speculation and hoarding of essential goods like shoes. The government attempted to regulate prices and prevent smuggling, but tensions rose as citizens and soldiers suffered. The appointment of James A. Seddon as Secretary of War in 1862 brought some hope, but internal conflicts and discontent persisted, fueled by issues like conscription, supply shortages, and economic hardships.|['1.

During the Civil War, the Confederate Government had six Secretaries of War. Leroy P. Walker, Judah P. Benjamin, George W. Randolph, Gustavus W. Smith, James A. Seddon, and General John C. Breckinridge served at different times. In 1863, the government introduced three main programs. Two of these, the Impressment Act and the Tax in Kind Act, were well-received initially. The Impressment Act led to a rapid drop in prices, benefiting the economy. The Tax Act aimed to generate revenue without using depreciated currency. However, a bill proposing to suspend habeas corpus rights created a rift between the government and opposition. The Mercury supported the Tax Act but strongly opposed the suspension of rights, leading to a significant divide between the two factions.|"['1.

"During the Confederate Congress, a heated debate arose over reviving the expired second Habeas Corpus Act. The Administration argued that it was necessary due to open sedition in various regions and to enforce conscription. Opposition leader Henry S. Foote fiercely criticized the measure, focusing on General Hindman's actions in Arkansas. Foote denounced Hindman's alleged cruelties, comparing him unfavorably to ""beast Butler."" The debate also touched on martial law in Virginia, with Baldwin and Barksdale sharing contrasting views. Despite sarcasm from Barksdale, Foote's emotional storytelling won over the House, leading to resolutions condemning martial law. The Mercury lamented the rejection of the Barksdale Bill and warned of potential future attempts to suspend the Habeas Corpus Act.

Rhett's withdrawal from active politics after being defeated in the congressional elections in South Carolina's Third District remains a mystery. Despite his defeat, South Carolina seemed resolute in its stance, becoming an anti-Davis State by 1863. Rhett, a prominent figure, faced rejection despite his influence. His defeat deeply affected him, leading to his withdrawal from politics. Although he continued to oppose the Government through his son's editorship at the Mercury, Rhett faded from Confederate history. The Mercury criticized President Davis's war strategy, emphasizing the need for defensive tactics. The Impressment Law and tax policies faced public backlash, with accusations of sacrificing liberty for independence. The discontent among the poor intensified as they felt burdened by the new taxes. This period marked a shift in public sentiment against the planters and their leadership, fueling resentment and baseless accusations.|"[""1.

"In North Carolina, the peasant farmers were a significant political force, especially during the taxing times of the Confederacy. The farmers, feeling oppressed by the tax in kind imposed by the Confederate Government, held meetings to express their discontent. They denounced the government's actions as unjust, tyrannical, and unconstitutional. W. W. Holden, an influential figure, advocated for negotiations for peace, reflecting the widespread desire for an end to the war. Political unrest grew, leading to riots, destruction of newspaper offices, and deserters terrorizing the countryside. The elections in North Carolina saw a shift towards anti-Davis sentiments, with new representatives elected. The Confederate Administration faced challenges as discontent spread, even in Georgia.

In October 1863, President Davis embarked on a journey to address issues within the Confederate army. Concerned about dissension among General Bragg's officers and confusion in the army after the victory at Chickamauga, Davis traveled to Mobile and then through Charleston. Despite warm receptions, ominous signs loomed. The Mercury downplayed his visit while the Courier highlighted it. Returning to Richmond in early November, Davis focused on military matters, unaware of the political crisis unfolding. The Confederacy faced challenges as support waned, and internal divisions deepened. Economic and political forces reshaped Southern life, challenging the planter class's ideals. The conflict over slavery intensified, leading to debates within the Confederate Congress. Ultimately, the need for labor in wartime prompted discussions on emancipation, marking a significant shift in Confederate policy.|"[""1.

During the Civil War, the Confederate government faced challenges regarding the ownership and control of slaves. The idea of the government owning slaves was met with resistance from Southern planters who feared the potential power and disruption it could bring, including industrial competition and military control. Concerns about favoritism and labor system upheaval led to a reluctance to acquire slaves. The control of slaves during the war also posed issues as the fighting population decreased, leaving a need for oversight. Laws exempting overseers from military duty and hiring substitutes for drafted men caused social unrest, with accusations of favoritism toward the wealthy. Women of all classes played crucial roles in supporting the war effort, enduring hardships and sacrifices. The war brought about a shift in societal dynamics and perceptions, highlighting the challenges faced by both the wealthy and poorer classes.|"['1.

The hardships faced by people during the Confederacy have become well-known. These difficulties mainly stemmed from three factors: the blockade, poor transportation systems, and the greed of speculators. The blockade severely impacted the South by disrupting the cotton-based economy, hindering the import of essential goods like medicine, and depriving the population of basic necessities. The shortage of medicines persisted throughout the war despite efforts to produce them locally. The limited industrial capacity in the South, with only a few facilities capable of producing military supplies, led to struggles in meeting demands. The inefficient railway system exacerbated the situation, causing congestion and hindering the transportation of vital supplies. Speculators took advantage of these challenges, driving up prices and profiting from the suffering of the people. Bishop Pierce highlighted the ruthless actions of speculators, who hoarded food while the population starved.|"['1.

During the Civil War, soldiers' families faced tragic circumstances. If a soldier didn't own land, his family struggled due to the high cost of living and low pay. Local charities were the only barrier between these families and starvation, providing relief through state, county, and neighborly assistance. Families often had to flee to remote areas to escape the war's destruction, enduring perilous journeys and seeking safety from lawless outlaws. Despite the challenges, heroic women led these families, displaying remarkable courage and resilience. The Southern spirit remained strong even after setbacks like the battles of Gettysburg and Vicksburg. While the Secretary of War tried to downplay the losses, the reality was that the South faced increasing hardships and isolation, with the Trans-Mississippi practically cut off. This marked a turning point in the war, where the odds were stacked against the Confederacy.|"[""1.

During the four months between Vicksburg and Chattanooga, distressing events unfolded, leading to the semi-isolation of the middle region of the lower South. Mississippi and Alabama faced their most desperate chapter in history, caught between financial and military demands from Richmond and ruthless raids from the North. By 1864, Confederate lines were irregular, leaving Mississippi and parts of Alabama beyond aid. The civilian population, although hopeful, faced the harsh reality of the war's impact on their lives. Richmond's call for resources fueled resentment, highlighting the struggle between local and Confederate authorities over conscription. The administrative duel, exemplified by the clash over habeas corpus, further complicated matters. Alabama's troubles were exacerbated by raids, like Wheeler's daring ride, leaving towns stripped of provisions and livestock. The year 1864 foreshadowed the tragic confusion that would later paralyze the Confederate Government in Richmond.|"['1.

During the session of 1864, President Davis alerted the Southern Congress about the critical situation in the middle Gulf region, which posed a threat to the Confederacy. To address the growing unrest and prevent similar issues in the east, Davis proposed reinstating martial law and suspending habeas corpus. Secret societies were suspected of undermining the Confederacy, with reports of organizations encouraging desertion and espionage. Congress reluctantly passed a law allowing the President to order arrests for treason, but with specific conditions. Despite tensions over military exemptions and details, the Confederacy faced challenges in balancing recruitment and labor needs. The year 1864 saw increased scrutiny of suspicious groups and the need for strategic military and civilian coordination.|"[""1.

In 1864, the President signed a conscription act and reinstated the tax in kind, making some adjustments for farmers. Despite Congress ignoring the President's plea for a direct tax on slaves and land, they incorporated one of his ideas into the Funding Act. The currency crisis led to the devaluation of the paper dollar to six cents in specie, prompting Congress to reduce the volume of paper money. To force note-holders to exchange notes for bonds, Congress imposed a tax on notes. With the North enveloping the Confederacy, Grant and Sherman initiated operations. The Confederate Government focused on supplying and recruiting armies. Despite Grant's setback at Cold Harbor and Sherman's struggles, Confederate hopes were high. In the North, opponents of the war united to challenge the Lincoln Government and seek peace with the Confederacy. Confederate agents in Canada influenced Northern sentiment and engaged in peace negotiations. Meanwhile, Sherman advanced towards Atlanta, causing concern in the lower South. Johnston faced criticism for his retreats, leading to his replacement by Hood. Davis took a bold risk to counter Sherman's advance and influence the Northern election.|"['1.

In August, the Democratic convention in Chicago favored peace, but the Southern President remained anxious about the western line's safety. Farragut's capture of Mobile Bay in mid-August shifted the line's focus. Despite Hood's attacks, Sherman gained the upper hand by the month's end. The duel between North and South shook the foundations of their hopes. Sherman's victorious entry into Atlanta on September 2 marked a turning point. The Confederacy's failed attempt to seek foreign recognition was a key factor in their downfall. Napoleon III of France toyed with the idea of aiding the Confederacy but faced opposition from England and Russia. Despite promises of intervention and shipbuilding, the Confederacy's hopes abroad were dashed. Napoleon's intricate schemes and alliances left the Confederacy in a precarious position.|"[""1.

Arman, a skilled individual, sought permission to construct and arm warships, planning to sell them to China or Japan. With approval from a high-ranking official under Bonaparte's authority and financial backing from Erlanger, the project began. Meanwhile, Slidell, optimistic after Chancellorsville, urged the Emperor to recognize the Confederacy. Napoleon, considering a European alliance, was cautious due to potential conflicts with the United States. He hinted at building ships in France but concealing their destination. The Laird Brothers in England were also building ironclad rams, suspected to aid the Confederacy. Despite efforts to keep their purpose secret, the United States caught wind of the scheme. The British Government, leaning towards the North, investigated the ownership of the rams. The South hoped for intervention, especially with Lee's recent success at Chancellorsville. An alliance with Europe was crucial for their aspirations.|"[""1.

While Slidell spoke with the Emperor, he carried a letter from J. A. Roebuck, an English politician. Roebuck sought to quash rumors in London that Napoleon opposed intervention. Napoleon, upon reading the letter, initiated negotiations with Roebuck. The ensuing complications, recriminations, and broken promises by Napoleon, a skilled diplomat, unfolded. Roebuck believed Napoleon supported recognizing the Confederacy after their Paris meeting. However, when Roebuck presented the matter to the Commons, facing opposition suggesting a different understanding with Napoleon, he withdrew his motion. Confederate sentiment soured towards England but warmed towards France due to Napoleon's Mexican plans. Southern hope revived, bolstered by a pamphlet indicating French support. Napoleon's actions, like allowing the Confederate cruiser Florida to repair in Brest, hinted at his favor. Despite this, a cloud loomed as a clerk absconded with confidential documents, leaving uncertainty in France.|"[""1. What was the purpose of J. A.

From the Confederate perspective, all seemed lost. The situation grew too intricate to follow closely. In summary, the papers were sold to the United States, the secret was exposed, and the United States launched a forceful attack on the Imperial Government. Slidell, overwhelmed by anxiety, sent a note to the Emperor that was blunt and ill-advised. This note revealed details about ships being built for the Confederate States, hinting at a promise from Napoleon. However, this move backfired, leading to a stern rebuke from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Napoleon's true intentions became clear; he aimed to assist the South in winning independently and then use it to his advantage. As the secrecy surrounding the ships dissipated, Napoleon's stance shifted, and the Mexican project faced opposition. Ultimately, the collapse of a Mexican loan and the United States' denouncement of European involvement in Mexico led to the Confederacy's hopes diminishing. Napoleon, facing mounting pressure, abandoned support for the Confederacy, marking the end of the affair.|"[""1.

The breakdown of Confederate negotiations with Mexico was complete, as General Preston faced refusal of recognition. In July, during the crucial days when Atlanta's fate hung in the balance, the Confederate Government's pride and despair were evident. A stern letter directed Preston not to pursue further overtures with Mexico, emphasizing equality. Subsequently, a crisis unfolded in Georgia. President Davis, sensing the gravity of the situation, joined the army there. Conflict arose within the Confederacy post the loss of Atlanta, with Governor Joseph E. Brown representing a different perspective from the President. Brown's opposition intensified, with his actions reflecting his focus on Georgia's defense and peace. His reluctance to send Georgia militia to aid Hood's campaign against Sherman showcased his fear of depleting Georgia's resources.

The situation in Georgia was dire, leading Davis to personally intervene. Leaving Richmond with a somber mindset, he aimed to convey the military perspective to the people. His intent was for them to grasp the soldier's viewpoint, focusing solely on defeating the enemy. Despite some missteps in his speeches, Davis' efforts were met with criticism, especially regarding General Beauregard. While negotiating with Brown, tensions arose over control of state troops. As Sherman's march brought devastation, Georgia's response varied. The people, under leaders like Cobb, rallied despite challenges. However, the Richmond Government faced limitations in aiding Georgia, resorting to desperate measures to bolster forces. Ultimately, Sherman's march persisted, shifting attention to South Carolina, where similar struggles ensued. The state enacted conscription and exemption laws, reflecting a growing disconnection from the Confederate cause. General Preston's letter epitomized the sense of despair and defiance prevalent in the region.|"[""1.

During the Civil War in South Carolina, political tensions escalated as the State Exemption Act caused division. Preston viewed supporters of the Act as deceitful, while the Mercury newspaper fiercely criticized Davis in 1864-1865. Despite this, anti-Davis factions continued to resist without considering surrender. Governor Magrath stressed the importance of fighting while also monitoring the central Government. The rift between State and Confederate authorities became evident in 1865. Lee lamented the lack of recruits due to conscription policies, while the Mercury accused Davis of neglecting South Carolina's defense against Sherman. The labor shortage worsened due to military orders, affecting projects like the Columbia and Augusta Railroad. Magrath proposed a regional alliance to counter Confederate disarray, prompting Governor Vance to call for political acumen over military strategy. The Mercury and Cobb also expressed concerns over Davis's dwindling support and urged for strategic changes.|"['1.

During the tumultuous times of the Civil War, political chaos reigned in the Confederate government. A scheme emerged to depose President Davis in favor of General Lee as dictator. Despite the traditional narrative suggesting this, it seems unlikely that anyone would propose such a drastic change to Lee. The enemies of Davis launched attacks on his administration, hoping to bolster Lee's popularity. A bill was introduced to appoint Lee as the supreme commander of Confederate armies, intending to boost morale. Pressure mounted on Davis to change his cabinet, with threats of a vote of no confidence. The financial crisis loomed large, with Confederate currency almost worthless, causing immense hardship for citizens.

During the Civil War, there were many complaints about corruption in the government. Contractors were accused of profiting from supplies, and officials were said to be stealing from both the government and the people. The Impressment Law was used to cover up these thefts. The press played a role in spreading false accusations and creating an anti-Davis sentiment. General Bragg was informed that people saw President Davis as stubborn and unwilling to change his opinions. Some editors disliked Davis for wanting to conscript them. Despite efforts to control prices, opposition groups and speculators made it difficult. Governor William Smith of Virginia tried to sell rice at a fair price but faced opposition from those who believed in individualism over government control. The Confederate army was also facing challenges, with many soldiers leaving to help their families. In January 1865, there was a congressional attack on the Administration, leading to Secretary Seddon's resignation. Davis faced pressure from Congress, but he stood firm in his decisions.|"['1.

Despite the President's initial reluctance, he eventually yielded to Congress and signed a bill on January 26, 1865, creating the office of commanding general, appointing Lee to the position. Lee, while accepting the role, made it clear that his nomination was solely due to the President's kindness and not Congress's influence. Meanwhile, the call for Johnston's reinstatement persisted, leading Davis to reluctantly agree. However, he delegated the decision to the new commander-in-chief, who promptly reinstated Johnston. Amidst these political struggles, disaffected groups emerged, including original Unionists and conscripted indifferentists. These groups, often overlooked in history, formed local bands that pillaged communities. The region's poor whites, harboring deep-seated animosity towards authority, wreaked havoc, targeting defenseless civilians. Despite some advocating for reconstruction or separate peace, Virginia and South Carolina's leaders understood the harsh realities of war and the futility of such ideals.|"[""1.

"In the Confederacy, a segment of the population lacked worldly experience, mainly comprising small farmers and semi-peasants exempt from taxes but denied education. These individuals, devoid of the mental grounding of the upper classes, were quick to fight but limited in their understanding of life, incapable of envisioning diverse circumstances. When faced with hardship, like sudden taxation or a turn in the war requiring imagination and faith, they panicked childishly. Believing in talk as a solution, they clung to the fantasy of endless discussions reconstructing the Union. In North Carolina, state sovereignty supporters saw secession as a defense of their principles. Despite having no interest in promoting slavery, they resisted any interference. The uneducated populace, reacting strongly to taxation, began questioning their alliances and pondered if leaving the Union could lead to better conditions. Their hope lay in returning to the old Union, a sentiment echoed in the catchphrase ""the Constitution as it is and the Union as it was."""|"['1.

In Georgia, during the Civil War, Alexander H. Stephens emerged as a prominent figure. He strongly opposed the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus and the Conscription Act, criticizing President Davis for his policies. Stephens, known for his constitutional beliefs, questioned Davis's intentions and accused him of aiming for absolute power. Despite his extreme views, Stephens was never disloyal in his actions. In 1864, there were rumors of Stephens being approached for a separate peace negotiation with Sherman, but he avoided the situation. Governor Brown's cryptic statements hinted at hidden motives, suggesting Georgia's potential independence. However, the re-election of Lincoln dashed hopes of a Union restoration on old terms. The talk of peace and reconstruction was met with skepticism, especially in South Carolina, where Congressman Boyce's views were met with resistance. The Mercury newspaper believed victory or subjugation were the only outcomes, dismissing the idea of a peaceful resolution.|"['1. What did Alexander H.

During the Northern elections, Davis hoped for support from anti-Lincoln men. Stephens publicly suggested that Davis wanted the Northern peace party to fail. Davis, surprised by this claim, wrote to Stephens demanding an explanation. Stephens, in a lengthy response in mid-December, defended himself on two grounds. Firstly, he referred to a speech Davis made in October opposing a convention of all states proposed by Northern peace men. Stephens believed such a convention could have ended the war and secured Southern independence. Secondly, Stephens mentioned a case involving a Northern soldier who claimed to be a peace envoy to Davis but was not taken seriously. Stephens believed Davis thwarted peace negotiations. Stephens later proposed resolutions for peace in 1865, despite Lincoln's nationalistic re-election. The peace intrigue involved figures like Napoleon III and Francis P. Blair, aiming to negotiate peace between the Confederacy and the United States.|"[""1.

In January, Blair's actions captivated public interest. Military tensions eased with the appointment of a commanding general. Efforts to oust the Cabinet were quelled when only the Secretary of War resigned. Peace discussions dominated Congress and the nation. Newspapers speculated on Blair's moves, some optimistically hinting at peace. Virginia legislators dismissed peace hopes as groundless. The Mercury labeled peace advocates as the South's worst foes. Lee disregarded peace talks, and rumors swirled about Blair's peace terms. A pivotal meeting took place on a steamer in Hampton Roads with Seward and Lincoln. Confederate commissioners clashed on peace terms, leading to Stephens' downfall. The failed conference sparked mixed reactions. Davis rallied support in Richmond, vowing to stand strong. The idea of arming slaves stirred controversy, lingering as a divisive topic.

The feeling across the country had a powerful impact. Rhett emerged from retirement and criticized the Government for trying to transfer control of a crucial matter from the states. The call for more troops to face Sherman coincided with the discussion of using black soldiers, becoming a key issue. This led to a strong anti-Davis movement in December 1864 and January 1865. Many feared giving Davis control over a large army of obedient soldiers. The idea of a dictatorship during the war, as suggested by Benjamin, raised concerns. In Virginia, the suggestions sparked a political program outlined by Governor Smith, advocating for arming slaves. Lee, a significant figure, suggested that slavery should be under state control. He emphasized the need for a shift in sentiment due to military necessity. Lee's advice showcased his skills as a statesman, emphasizing the importance of civil forces in the Confederacy's system.|"['1.

During the Civil War in 1865, General Lee faced a critical decision about using African American troops. He feared that if the enemy continued to advance, they would recruit the able-bodied men among the enslaved population, turning them into soldiers and ultimately emancipating all slaves. Lee believed that allowing this would be detrimental to the South's well-being. He suggested that if slavery were to end, it should be done on their terms rather than by the enemy. While Lee proposed employing African American troops and gradual emancipation, the state of Virginia did not immediately act on his recommendations. The delay in making a decision only added to the challenges faced by the South. Despite the mounting pressure, Lee chose not to intervene in broader Confederate politics but focused on the local crisis in Virginia. Ultimately, the decision to arm slaves was left to Congress, with President Davis eventually considering this bold move to strengthen the army.|"[""1.

The debate between the Government and the opposition reached a climax involving various political motives. Some, like Smith and Lee, supported emancipation by the States' free will. Others preferred subjugation over arming slaves, leading to conflicting views. Some were open to arming slaves but not granting them freedom. R. M. T. Hunter emerged as a key figure opposing the Senate bill authorizing the enlistment of black troops and their manumission. Despite lengthy debates, the bill was postponed indefinitely. Another bill, with Lee's support, proposed enrolling and eventually freeing black soldiers. A compromise bill was accepted, empowering the President to enlist slaves without changing their owners' relationship without consent. The act's results were minimal, criticized for not granting freedom to slave-soldiers. Despite setbacks, Davis remained committed to the emancipation policy.

During the Civil War, as Sherman's troops advanced through the Carolinas, Congress debated a compromise bill. Governor Magrath proposed a league within the Confederacy due to differing interests. Despite opposition and criticism, Davis remained confident in his plans, even hinting at emancipation to gain foreign support. Kenner was sent to Europe to negotiate, but Mason's efforts in England were fruitless. Davis eventually signed a compromise bill omitting emancipation, hoping for recognition. However, Mason's discussions with British officials revealed that it was too late for such concessions to sway their decision. The Confederacy's last-ditch effort to arm slaves for freedom as a bargaining chip with European powers ultimately fell short.|"[""1.

During the final days of the Confederacy, as Richmond was evacuated and the Confederate defense weakened, President Davis remained resolute. Despite setbacks and defeats, he continued to believe in the Confederate cause. The surrender at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, marked a turning point, leading to the migration of the executive company. General Johnston sought permission to negotiate with Sherman, but Davis was reluctant to give up the fight. However, news of Johnston's surrender in Charlotte forced Davis to face the reality of defeat. The Confederacy's executive history came to an end as Davis and his remaining supporters scattered for safety. Eventually, Davis was captured in Georgia on May 10, 1865. The surrender of the Trans-Mississippi forces on May 26, 1865, brought the Civil War to a definitive close. Despite the proposal of relentless guerrilla warfare by Lee's officers, Lee chose to accept the outcome of battle, believing in a new future for the South.|"[""1.

"Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederate States during the Civil War, faced numerous challenges and criticisms during his administration. Born in Kentucky, he was elected as the President in a provisional government and later at the first regular election. Despite his personal loyalty and statecraft, he clashed with state authorities, used martial law, and faced criticism for his shortcomings. Davis proposed conscription, endorsed ""Confederate Societies,"" and journeyed extensively during his time in office. He remained resolute to continue the struggle despite setbacks, even endorsing a compromise bill. His capture in Georgia marked the end of his presidency.
