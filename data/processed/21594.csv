Fred's calm and decisive actions reassured his friends, who feared for Colon's life. Thanks to Fred's quick thinking and leadership, Colon was rescued and brought back to camp for recovery.

Walking away, Fred felt a sense of relief, his heart lighter than when he had arrived near Miss Muster's property. This encounter had altered his perception of the old maid, once viewed as unlikable by the Riverport boys. Witnessing her softer side, Fred now saw her as a kind-hearted woman, though somewhat lonely. The excitement in the community was palpable as crowds gathered to watch the school's rowing team, signaling a new passion beyond baseball and football. The anticipation of victory fueled the enthusiasm among the students, with each crew member having their own supporters present. Fred shared details about the upcoming boat race with his friend Corney, explaining the course and the markers used for measuring distances along the riverbank. As Fred was called over by a charming girl named Flo, Corney refrained from further questioning, knowing Fred's fondness for her. Fred and Flo had a close friendship and shared many memories together, causing a rift between Buck and Fred, who also vied for Flo's attention.|"[""1.

Flo, like her friends, waved a purple and gold flag, Riverport's colors. Fred thought the colors made her look prettier. They were about to launch the boat. Subs were ready in case regulars couldn't make it. Brad planned to take them for a spin later. Flo overheard hopeful subs talking about joining the crew. Fred explained there was room for multiple crews to practice. Buck Lemington disliked Fred for no reason. Flo teased that Buck was jealous of Fred because she liked him. Fred and Buck often competed, and Buck thought Fred always won unfairly. Flo had an invite to watch from the shore. Fred waved to someone in the crowd, likely Flo.

The coxswain decided to increase the rowing pace, and the boat swiftly glided over the water like a swallow skimming a pond. The boys, filled with enthusiasm, impressed Brad with their performance, reaching the turning point faster than expected. As they approached a buoy marking the course's end, a loud crash and shouts were heard. Brad directed the crew to row towards the commotion.

Buck was furious after the boat accident. He blamed the mishap on Clem Shooks, even though others suspected he might try to shift the blame to one of his friends. Brad, showing kindness, helped tow some of the wrecked boat's crew to safety, despite Buck's objections. Buck accused Clem of causing the accident and threatened him when he tried to defend himself.

Colon and Fred decided to draw straws to determine who would keep the first watch during their camping trip.
