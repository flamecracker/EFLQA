The Elk Patrol of the local Boy Scouts is embarking on a challenging mission to deliver a secret message from Mayor Scott to the mayor of Green Valley, covering a distance of about 100 miles in just fifteen days. The team consists of first-class Scouts Roger Franklin, Tom Scott, Dick Smith, Harry Leonard, Chris Anderson, and Charley Brown. These Scouts are well-prepared, having honed their skills and earned their badges. Among them is Chris Anderson, a resourceful fifteen-year-old with half a left arm, adept at tracking and survival skills. Charley Brown, another Scout, is eager to prove his abilities on this expedition. Despite their preparations, the Scouts face challenges from local boys who mock their Scoutcraft efforts. The mission requires the Scouts to navigate rugged terrain, live off the land, and avoid using vehicles or outside help, testing their resilience and teamwork.|"[""1.

We were warned about potential obstacles ahead, with some townsfolk suggesting that bears could pose a threat. However, we, as Scouts, were undaunted by the challenge. Despite receiving an ominous letter, we were determined to deliver a message to Garcia. Prepared for the journey, we dressed in blue shirts with the Scouts' emblem, khaki trousers, and sturdy mountain boots. General Ashley and Major Henry led the way, followed by our burros, Sally and Apache. We carried the Stars and Stripes along with our Patrol flag on a staff, ready to set up camp with tarps and blankets. Our supplies were securely packed on the burros using the diamond hitch. To provide food quietly, we brought a rifle and a bow for hunting. Each Scout had a war-bag with personal items for the journey.|"['1.

For our journey, we packed essential supplies like flour, salt, sugar, bacon, dried apples, rice, and more. Canned goods were heavy to carry, so we avoided raw beans due to their bulkiness and long cooking time at high altitudes. We relied on fishing for trout and hunting rabbits or squirrels for food, with the option to restock at ranches along the way. Each pair of us had a first-aid kit, and we also carried camp remedies selected by our Patrol surgeon. Following General Ashley and Major Henry, we walked briskly along the old stage road towards Grizzly Gulch, then turned onto a prospectors' trail towards the Medicine Range. We maintained a steady pace uphill, limiting our food intake to conserve energy. Reaching the mesa top, we briefly rested before continuing our journey across the rugged terrain towards Pilot Peak.|"['1. **Question:** What did the group rely on for food during their journey?\n- A) Canned goods\n- B) Raw beans\n- C) Fishing and hunting\n- D) Restocking at ranches\n- E) Eating dried apples', '2. **Question:** Why did the group avoid carrying canned goods?\n- A) They were expensive\n- B) They were difficult to find\n- C) They were too salty\n- D) They were heavy to carry\n- E) They spoiled quickly', '3. **Question:** Who led the group on their journey?\n- A) General Ashley\n- B) Major Henry\n- C) Patrol surgeon\n- D) Pilot Peak\n- E) Grizzly Gulch', '4. **Question:** What did the group do upon reaching the mesa top?\n- A) Continued walking\n- B) Restocked at a ranch\n- C) Rested briefly\n- D) Started fishing\n- E) Ate dried apples', '5. **Question:** How did the group conserve energy during their journey?\n- A) By eating more food\n- B) By walking slowly\n- C) By limiting food intake\n- D) By carrying heavy supplies\n- E) By resting frequently', ""6. **Question:** Where did the group head towards after turning onto a prospectors' trail?\n- A) Grizzly Gulch\n- B) Ranches\n- C) Medicine Range\n- D) Pilot Peak\n- E) Stage road""]"|['** C) Fishing and hunting', '** D) They were heavy to carry', '** A) General Ashley', '** C) Rested briefly', '** C) By limiting food intake', '** C) Medicine Range']
Our mission was to deceive our pursuers. We considered using a tactic from the Indians, who would scatter in a fan-like formation after a raid, leaving confusing trails to throw off their trackers. However, lacking a meeting point, we opted to leave a clear trail to appear unsuspecting. Following Ute Creek, we planned to reach the Medicine Range. As instructed by General Ashley (Patrol Leader Roger Franklin), Scout Fitzpatrick and I (Scout Bridger) stayed behind to watch the trail while the others continued. Hidden among bushes, we communicated silently through sign language, maintaining vigilance. The peaceful draw, scented with sage, provided cover as we kept watch, noting even the magpie's warning call. Every detail mattered as we honed our scouting skills.|"['1.

After squatting quietly for an hour and a half, the sun was setting behind us as Fitzpatrick nudged me and gestured towards the trail below. Four familiar riders approached: Bill Duane, Mike Delavan, Tony Matthews, and Bert Hawley. We communicated through signs, trailing cautiously to discover their destination. As we circled back to avoid detection, we stumbled upon strange tracks leading in one direction. Hiding behind a cedar, we observed Bill Duane passing by. With darkness approaching, we detected campfire smoke. Fitzpatrick, an adept Scout, informed General Ashley of the enemy's location. Corporal Andrew Henry and Scout Jed Smith were assigned to guard the trail, while the rest of us tended to camp duties. As night fell, we completed camp preparations, ensuring the burros were secured and tasks were accomplished before settling in for the night.|"['1.

For dinner, we enjoyed bacon, beans, biscuits, and coffee. Major Henry and Jed Smith were still on duty and hadn't eaten yet. General Ashley then asked Kit Carson and Jim Bridger to relieve them. The council was brief, discussing General Ashley's clever plan. Major Henry ate quickly but was sent back out. Kit Carson and Jim Bridger were to call Jed Smith in for supper but continue their duty. As they waited in the quiet night, the stars twinkled above. Suddenly, they sensed someone approaching the camp, staying silent and alert. The group prepared for a possible attack, hiding their faces and hands. The tension rose as they awaited the enemy's arrival, ready for whatever came next.|"['1.

The group of scouts cautiously approached, peering into the beds before letting out a loud yell and charging towards what they thought were us. They stomped on the beds and made a racket, hoping to scare us, but we stayed put, much to their surprise. Major Henry and Kit Carson had cleverly taken the enemy's horses while they were away. We couldn't contain our excitement and cheered quietly. General Ashley hushed us and the scouts grumbled as they left. We decided to post guards, not wanting to move camp in the middle of the night. We took turns keeping watch, following our routine of getting up early at five in the morning. Each of us had specific tasks like cooking, cleaning, chopping wood, and tending to the burros. After a cold rub, we packed up and left the campsite clean and tidy before continuing our journey.|"['1.

This morning, our journey continued up Ute Creek from Gray Bull Basin near Pilot Peak. We aimed to reach Gray Bull Basin in three days, covering about ten to twelve miles daily uphill with burros. The trail was scenic with birds, wild strawberries, and playful squirrels. We passed beaver dams and a legendary large trout that no one could catch. The creek's amber waters rushed among boulders and fallen trees. As we navigated the rough terrain, we discovered a beaver trap washed downstream, indicating illegal trapping. Despite feeling upset, we buried the trap to restore the creek's purity. Our mission to deliver a message urged us forward, overcoming obstacles and appreciating nature's beauty along the way.|"[""1.

This was a lovely area. One side was covered in pines and spruces on a long slope that went up until it was bare and reddish gray above the tree line, with patches of snow and the tip of Pilot Peak in the distance. However, on our side, a forest fire had destroyed the trees, leaving only black stumps and new bushes growing. We chose to camp on the burnt side for safety. The creek in the middle of the park was wide and smooth, but the beavers had left. We found old camp signs but no fresh ones. We decided to have a big meal, hoping to find wild raspberries in the burnt area. Little Jed Smith and I were tasked with catching trout using dead willow sticks as rods and grasshoppers as bait. It was a challenge to catch trout in the clear water, but the excitement of outsmarting the big ones kept us going.|['1.

After we got ready, we surveyed the area. We sat and analyzed where we would choose to be if we were a large trout. Big trout typically stay in one spot, like a hole or under a bank, close by, eating and chasing off smaller fish. Sometimes they venture out to feed but return to their lair. We examined the situation. Wading around or disturbing the banks without a plan would scare the trout. I decided to try my luck across the water where it swirled around a low part of the dam, creating a dark eddy under the spruce branches. My friend Jed Smith agreed to try a spot where the bank jutted out over the water on our side. I realized that my chosen spot would likely be fished by many from the water's edge. So, to surprise the trout, I approached from a different angle. I crossed over to the other side, being cautious not to make noise, and positioned myself under the spruce tree. With a swift flick of my pole, I dropped the hopper into the water. On my second attempt, a yellowish flash darted up and swallowed the hopper in one go. I quickly pulled up the line, knowing it was a sizable trout by the way it took the bait. The fish got tangled in the branches, thrashing wildly. In my haste to secure the catch, I lunged forward and tumbled headfirst into the water, but I didn't mind the cold shock.|"['Question 1: What did the narrator and Jed Smith do after getting ready?\nA) They went home.\nB) They surveyed the area.\nC) They went fishing for smaller fish.\nD) They decided to disturb the banks.\nE) They scared the trout by wading around.', 'Question 2: Why did the narrator choose to approach the trout from a different angle?\nA) To disturb the trout\nB) To scare the trout away\nC) To surprise the trout\nD) To fish for smaller fish\nE) To analyze the situation again', ""Question 3: Where did the narrator position himself to fish for the trout?\nA) Under the bank\nB) Under the water\nC) Under the spruce tree\nD) On the water's edge\nE) On the other side"", 'Question 4: How did the narrator lure the trout?\nA) By disturbing the water\nB) By making noise\nC) By dropping a hopper into the water\nD) By scaring off smaller fish\nE) By venturing out to feed', 'Question 5: What happened when the narrator caught the trout?\nA) The trout escaped.\nB) The narrator fell into the water.\nC) The trout thrashed wildly.\nD) The narrator scared the trout.\nE) The narrator disturbed the banks.', 'Question 6: How did the narrator feel about falling into the water?\nA) Angry\nB) Excited\nC) Disappointed\nD) Surprised\nE) Indifferent']"|['B) They surveyed the area.', 'C) To surprise the trout', 'C) Under the spruce tree', 'C) By dropping a hopper into the water', 'C) The trout thrashed wildly.', 'E) Indifferent']
I had to quickly head to the shore. Carefully, I held onto the fishing pole, ensuring the hook wouldn't slip away. As I waded knee-deep into the water, I skillfully reeled in a trout, landing it safely in the brush. It was a decent-sized Eastern brook trout, around fifteen inches long, weighing about two pounds. Meanwhile, my friend Jed had also caught a remarkable trout, a twenty-six-inch, four-pounder with only one eye. Despite the impressive catch, we were both humble Scouts, focused on providing food for everyone rather than seeking personal glory. Jed shared his clever fishing technique, approaching the trout from an unexpected angle to secure the catch. With our two catches, we enjoyed a satisfying meal of baked trout, fried potatoes, hot bread, and wild raspberries with condensed milk, courtesy of General Ashley and Kit Carson.|"['1.

After a filling dinner and cleaning up, we relaxed. Jed Smith and I had to wait for our clothes to dry. We stuffed our boots with newspapers to help them dry faster. While we rested, Fitzpatrick signaled us to be quiet and pointed across the beaver pond. We saw a man at the edge of the timber on the other side. He wore a black hat and seemed suspicious. General Ashley decided we needed to investigate. Fitzpatrick and I went to the upper end of the pond, pretending to go fishing. We followed the man's footprints and found he had a horse waiting in the timber. It seemed he had been scouting the area. We carefully retraced his steps to gather more information.|"['1.

We followed the horse's tracks into the timber country, then let it go and met General Ashley to report. General Ashley, Kit Carson, and us examined the prints in the sand and speculated that the man might be left-handed. Why did he come to the pond, look at us, and then hurry into the timber? Perhaps he was afraid we saw him and didn't want to be seen. Our guesses didn't lead to much. We decided to camp for the night to rest the burros before their climb. The area was teeming with wildlife like chipmunks and woodpeckers. Fitzpatrick took close-up pictures of chipmunks and a woodpecker feeding its young. We hoped to capture a bear on camera too. A man on a dark bay horse with a Diamond Five brand on his shoulder visited us, seeking a left-footed man. He shared a shortcut through the timber for us to reach Dixon's Park and a ruined sawmill.|"[""1.

In the morning, the mountains wore white mist like night-caps. Clouds above hinted at rain, despite the clear sunrise. After breakfast, we prepared for a storm. General Ashley treated Jed Smith's toothache with camphor. We followed a hidden trail, marked by closed-over blazes. As thunder approached, we quickened our pace uphill to avoid lightning strikes. The wind howled, signaling the impending rain. Finding a flat spot at nine thousand feet, we braced for the storm. Watching from our shelter, we saw the gray smoke-like storm approaching. We waited it out, preferring to stay dry ourselves rather than risk wet gear. It's best to endure the rain and keep our camp dry for the night.|"['1.

The Elk is our Medicine, making us strong. As we continued our journey, the sun dried us off after a passing squall. The park we traveled through was once lush with trees, but a saw-mill had cleared it, leaving behind stumps and logs like a graveyard. The creek we stopped at for lunch was devoid of fish due to the mill's impact. Resting at the mill ruins, we had tea and bread. Traveling with young Jed Smith, we trudged through the showery afternoon, reaching a flat ridge where we planned to camp. General Ashley marked the spot, ensuring it was safe for a fire and had amenities for our burros. With everyone pitching in, we quickly set up camp before the rain returned.|"['1.

I had the perfect setup for hunting. With a twenty-two rifle and five cartridges in hand, I was confident I could bag two rabbits - a true test of my hunting skills. The sun was shining brightly, casting long shadows in the woods. I decided to hunt against the sun, with my shadow behind me, even though rabbits usually spot you first. I knew the right approach was key. After a rain is the ideal time to hunt rabbits, as they come out before dark and the wet ground dampens noise. I walked briskly, scanning the area for movement. Suddenly, a rabbit appeared, but my shot was true. I later spotted a big buck rabbit, but missed my shot. Determined, I tracked him uphill and made a clean shot. As I headed back with my catch, I heard shouting and encountered a boy with a shotgun.|"['1. What did the speaker use for hunting in the text?\nA. A shotgun\nB. A twenty-two rifle\nC.

"He had never encountered them previously, but now, he spotted them lying on the ground. ""Oh, goodness!"" he exclaimed. ""We have something better than this, but we are unable to start a fire as our matches are soaked, along with our blankets. We are lost,"" he confessed. He gestured towards his companion, saying, ""Another fellow is with me. We set out for Duck Lake with only blankets and some food, but we lost track of the trail and now we are clueless about our whereabouts. We are drenched and freezing. Where is your camp?"" As he led the way, I gathered the rabbits and followed suit. He continued to call out, receiving responses from the other boy, as we descended into the gulch where the creek flowed. Camping at the bottom of a narrow gulch, damp, dark, and unpleasant, was not a wise choice. They chose the spot for its proximity to water and soft grass. We ascended from the gulch, and in frustration, I made them carry their belongings. The woods were dim, but I navigated a direct path back to camp, guided by the sound of water on my left. The camp looked inviting with two fires ablaze, one for warmth and the other for cooking. A dog-tent made of a tarp stretched over poles, spruce trimmings stacked for warmth, and dry spruce needles covering the ground. The scene resembled a trappers' bivouac,"|"['1.

General Ashley argued that the grouse were already dead, regardless of when the hunting season began or the presence of a game warden. He expressed frustration that some people unfairly kill game, unlike those who abide by the law to ensure equal hunting opportunities. While Fitz cooked, they cleaned their birds, and everyone shared the meal around the campfire. They used bark as plates, cleaned their utensils with grass, and settled in for the night. Despite the cold and dampness, they made efforts to stay comfortable by sheltering from the wind and rain. The group, including Apache and Sally the burros, found warmth and comfort under the tarps and blankets.

The two boys were fast asleep when we woke up. They were curled up in the sun, with their faces covered to block the light. We didn't bother them, instead, we got ready for the day. Suddenly, one of them, Walt, stirred and rubbed his eyes, looking groggy and messy. We decided to let them join our group after a vote. General Ashley told them they had to follow our rules and could become official Scouts later if they proved themselves. They agreed to wash the dishes and threw away their blankets and extra stuff. We didn't want them to smoke because it's not healthy and against Scout rules. We suspected there were other groups of boys around, but Bat and Walt weren't observant enough to notice.|"['1.

We hiked along the high ridge, clear of brush, led by General Ashley and Major Henry. The burros followed faithfully, like dogs, with Bat armed and Walt carrying a shotgun. Moving swiftly, we kept Pilot Peak in sight, our guide now that we were off the beaten path. Reaching a meadow with a creek winding through, we paused to rest the burros and enjoy the serene scenery. While we snacked and relaxed, Bat and Walt discovered deer tracks and proposed camping near the timber to hunt later. Despite a rough start with the burros, we let the recruits lead, hoping they'd succeed. As we resumed our journey, the recruits lagged behind, sulking.

A trail for cattle wound through the flat land, leading to a pass that opened into another flat area. Tracks of deer heading down to drink at the creek were visible, showing marks of bucks, does, and fawns. As the group journeyed, they reached a plateau with cedar trees, flowers, and a spring, where they decided to set up camp. Despite the recruits having the opportunity to assist, they chose to relax instead. The sun lingered longer in the high altitude, indicating they were at about ten thousand feet. The stream rushed swiftly downhill, hinting at a steep slope. Fitzpatrick, known as the Bad Hand, captured valuable photos of the wildlife and scenery with his camera. A ground-hog and other animals vanished when a sudden shot rang out from Bat's Colt gun, scattering the creatures and silencing the surroundings.|"[""1.

"""Come on, Walt. Let's gather our things and leave to create our own camp,"" Bat suggested. ""We won't allow ourselves to be controlled by any red-headed kid—or any one-armed kid, for that matter."" He was talking about the gun and the burro packing. Major Henry started to grumble. A black-eyed boy is as brave as a red-headed one. We all stood up, prepared for a possible confrontation, but it didn't escalate. General Ashley got a bit red-faced but remained calm. Perhaps they thought we wanted them to leave completely, but since it was a public camp, we had no right to kick them out as long as they didn't bother us.

I had the toughest watch from one to three in the morning, splitting my night in two. As a Scout, I took my duty seriously, even though I felt exhausted when Carson woke me up. I had to leave my warm spot to guard the camp in the dark and cold woods, far from any lights or people. The fire had died out, but the stars and a sinking half-moon provided some light. I struggled to stay awake despite trying everything like rubbing my eyes, splashing water on my face, and even sitting down with a blanket. In a blink, I found myself slumped against a tree, stiff and surprised, as the morning had arrived without me waking General Ashley. The flagstaff and burros were missing, and so were two other campers. I had to wake General Ashley and sound the alarm, feeling anxious about the disappearing campers.|"[""1.

The leader chose Fitzpatrick, our top tracker, and Major Henry to decipher the trail while the rest prepared breakfast. The area near the flag hole was disturbed, hindering investigation. The general and his team widened their search, looking for burro tracks leading away from the camp. Fitzpatrick discovered the burro tracks, indicating a hurried departure. General Ashley instructed the group: Fitzpatrick, Jim Bridger, and him would pursue the burros while the others stayed behind, ready to follow if needed. They packed light, carrying only essentials like bread, chocolate, matches, and a knife. Leaving the rifle behind, they relied on stealth to retrieve the burros and flags. Fitzpatrick led the way, tracking the small, oblong hoof prints left by the burros. The urgency of the chase was palpable, imagining the burros being prodded to move faster.|['1.

We were high up among tall trees and shrubs on a large flat-topped hill. Cattle grazed in the area with open grasslands for them. Most of the cattle had a brand marked with a Big W. The trail the cattle followed kept splitting and disappearing, so we had to choose the one the burros took. The riders were still moving but at a slower pace, perhaps thinking we had been left behind. Soon the burros began nibbling on branches, indicating they were tired and hungry. The riders dismounted and walked. The sun was high, making it hard to read the signs, and we slowed down. The landscape became rocky, and we eventually lost the trail. The group split up to search, and Fitzpatrick found the trail ahead. We had to be cautious as the thieves were close, so we circled around to avoid being spotted. We took our time crossing a valley, staying hidden. As the sun set, we detected smoke, and climbing trees, we spotted another smoke signal in the distance, guiding us to the camp.|"['1.

Fitzpatrick, with only one whole arm, displayed impressive stalking skills as we cautiously advanced towards the source of the smoke. We stooped, crawled, and halted to listen, but the silence was deafening. Following the general's lead, Fitz and I crawled like snake scouts. In hindsight, approaching from three directions might have been wiser. As we peered through the branches, we saw the campfire, our flags, Sally, Apache, and blankets, but no occupants. Seizing the opportunity, we darted in, only to be ambushed by eight townsmen, including Bat, Walt, Bill, Tony, Bert, and Mike. The camp had been a trap, a lesson in underestimating the enemy and the importance of reconnaissance. We were captured, our arms bound, and led to the town gang's camp by the creek.|"['1.

We understood that it was all a joke, but the situation was serious. They might keep us out of spite, causing a delay in delivering the message. It was my fault for falling asleep on guard duty. Fitz and I were helpless as they searched the general. Despite their taunts, a man on a bay horse with a K Cross approached. He examined the packet but then placed it in his pocket, leaving us tied up. As night fell, the gang hesitated to confront the man, revealing his left-handedness and worn-out shoe sole.

"Scouts always keep their promises,"" the general replied, sounding upset. ""When we give our word, we mean it. If we wanted to escape, we would have told you and taken back our word.

The group of boys found themselves in a messy campsite, with tin cans and food scraps scattered around attracting flies. Despite missing their usual morning wash, they could only clean their faces quickly in the creek. The camp was unkempt, flags dusty, and the only familiar sight was their burros grazing nearby. The boys felt trapped, unable to send a smoke signal to alert their Scout leaders. They were tied up by two guards who didn't take their parole seriously. The guards just smoked, played cards, and didn't pay much attention to the camp's cleanliness or the boys' well-being. The boys felt frustrated and helpless, hoping their Scout leaders would arrive soon to rescue them.|"['1.

Fitz, a clever and resourceful individual, found a way to escape from being tied up using his camera. Despite being surrounded by people who were not paying attention, he managed to secretly burn the rope that bound him. While the others were distracted by cards and tobacco, Fitz dismantled his camera and focused the sunlight through the lenses onto the rope. With patience and ingenuity, he gradually burned through the rope until he was free. This act of quick thinking and determination shows that sometimes, unconventional solutions can help us overcome challenging situations. Fitz's actions also demonstrate the importance of staying alert and making the most of the resources available to us, even in seemingly hopeless circumstances.|"['1.

Walt grunted and rolled over, while Fitz stopped instantly, fiddling with his camera. After a brief pause, Fitz cautiously untied himself, inch by inch, resembling an Indian scout. Silently, he crept closer to Walt and Bat, grabbing the shotgun. With precision, he removed the shell and aimed the gun at them, though it was unloaded. Fitz's serious demeanor startled Walt and Bat, who were frozen with fear. Fitz had discarded the shell intentionally to prevent any mishaps. It's crucial never to point a gun, loaded or not, at anyone. The Scouts secured Walt and Bat with firm knots, ensuring their safety.|"['1.

We hurriedly ran in different directions, not stopping for anything except to grab the bow, arrows, and flags. The commotion grew louder as Walt and Bat raised the alarm. I dodged Tony Matthews and dashed into the woods, with him close behind. Despite the shouts and gunshots behind us, I kept running uphill, relying on my Scout training for endurance. The voices chasing me faded, and when the coast seemed clear, I paused to look back. The pursuit continued below, but I knew the general and Fitz were swift and elusive. As they sprinted towards the slope, the general stumbled. Fitzpatrick noticed and paused, witnessing the scene unfold.|"['1.

I understood the situation even though I couldn't hear clearly over the jeers of the gang. The general was injured and urged Fitz to flee, but Fitz stayed put. As the gang closed in, the general signaled for me to go on, indicating a horse and rider. My task was crucial; I had to follow the beaver man who carried our message. While Fitz and the general supported each other, I had to ensure the message reached its destination. I noticed Pilot Peak to the southwest and heavy timber surrounding me. Despite feeling lost, I recalled the direction the beaver man had likely taken. With only one arrow left, hungry and without supplies, I embarked on a solitary journey, determined to retrieve the message and succeed despite the challenges.|"['1.

As I journeyed through the dense forest, I kept a keen eye out for trails, hoping they would lead me to the stream near the gang's camp. Trails often run alongside streams, where cattle and horses pass through. Despite my efforts to follow the sun's guidance and navigate through the trees and open areas, the elusive stream remained out of reach. The rugged terrain, covered with timber, made it easy to lose track of direction. Exhausted, hungry, and thirsty, I found myself perched on a rocky ridge, surveying the vast landscape. In the distance, Pilot Peak and the Medicine Range loomed. Realizing the need to camp for the night, I gathered dry branches for a fire and searched for water and food, relying on my Scout skills to navigate this challenging situation without matches or tools.|"[""1.

Water was likely present in the valleys below, and I scanned for the greenest or willow-filled areas. The greenest spot appeared distant, but then I noticed a group of grouse flying out from the trees and descending into a ravine. More followed, behaving purposefully, likely heading for water before resting. They were far away, making it hard to identify the type of grouse. If they were sage or blue grouse, it would be challenging to hunt them with just one arrow. However, if they were fool grouse, I might have a chance. I marked their flight path and descended quickly, keeping an eye on their location. I needed to use my Scoutcraft skills to find water and food. Despite the law against hunting grouse, I reasoned that in my situation, it was necessary for survival. I hoped my intentions would be understood. As the sun set, I reached the bottom of the hill, finding a basin with seeping water, surrounded by grasses, willows, and aspens—a perfect habitat for grouse.|['1.

Slowly, I cautiously explored the area, eager and without pausing to quench my thirst. Suddenly, with a loud noise, two grouse and three more flew up and landed near me. Startled, I stumbled and broke my arrow with my knee. The grouse seemed foolish, sitting and watching me closely. I gathered the broken arrow and searched for a suitable replacement. As I looked around, another grouse surprised me, sitting so close that it could have bitten me. I recognized it as a foolish grouse. Would it fly away? I remained still, slowly inching closer with a stick in hand, trying not to startle it. With a swift swipe, I knocked it down and captured it. Despite the other grouse flying away, I focused on making a fire, using a Scout's ingenuity to prepare for the night.|"['1.

I succeeded! Sparks flew and landed in the knot, and with a blow, I ignited them. After several attempts, I noticed a bit of smoke and its scent. I swiftly grabbed the nest, swung it, and set it ablaze. In no time, I had a fire going with twigs laid across it. The fire changed everything. I no longer felt lonely; the camp felt like home. Hungry, I quickly cooked the grouse trapper-style over the flames. While eating, I admired the glorious sunset with pink and gold hues against the snowy range and Pilot Peak. Collecting wood in the twilight, I made my camp cozy. As darkness fell, I sat by the fire, feeling warm and content. Despite the eerie calls from the valley below, I wasn't scared. I mended my arrow and then rested, finding comfort in the Scout's way of life.|"['1.

When I woke up, I felt safe and sound, but the cold had stiffened my body after throwing off the flags. As I looked around, I could see the rocks, grass, and the remains of the fire, signaling that morning had arrived. After stretching and dancing to get warm, I cooked the remaining grouse over the fire, ensuring to chew well for nourishment. While enjoying my breakfast on a rock in the sun, I noticed smoke rising in the distance. Taking it as a positive sign, I tried signaling with smoke but received no response. Deciding not to call for help yet, I headed towards the distant smoke, navigating through rough terrain, fallen timber, and thick vegetation.

In the morning, as the breakfast smoke faded, I grew anxious. Hurriedly, I descended the tree, breaking a branch and scraping my skin. Despite the pain, I pressed on, scanning the ridge for any signs of smoke. The ridge led me to another gulch, which I reluctantly entered, my legs weak from hunger. Suddenly, the scent of wood smoke hit me, indicating a nearby campfire. Following the sound of running water, I navigated through thick brush, torn and wet. Eventually, I heard voices and saw two boys in khaki attire leaving a campsite. With my clothes in tatters and bow in hand, I emerged before them, revealing my Scout badge.

I was all set to join in, but they wouldn't listen or let me help. Carrying their packs, the Red Fox Scouts led the way across the creek and into the woods, following the horse's tracks. One shoe had a bent nail. The Scouts moved swiftly, Scout Van Sant in front, Scout Ward behind, and me at the back. After a while, Van Sant fell back to watch me, but I kept up, fueled by soup and determination. Two hours later, we rested and had soup by a split in the creek. The hoofprints led up the gulch. We crossed the creek where the bridge was out and followed a trail. The smell of smoke lingered. As we turned a corner, we stumbled upon a sunny clearing with an old abandoned prospect claim. We waited for any sign of life. Ward decided to check out the dug-out, but no one answered.|['1.

The beaver man, armed with a pistol, confronted the Scouts. Despite his threats, the Scouts stood their ground. Scout Ward, showing bravery, tended to the man's wound caused by an arrow. The man, in pain and anger, demanded they leave. Scout Ward calmly instructed on cleaning the wound to prevent infection. The man's hostility did not deter the Scouts from helping. Scout Ward's quick thinking and medical knowledge impressed everyone. The man, realizing the Scouts' determination, eventually softened his tone.

The man growled and fussed with his clothing near an open wound. The Red Fox Patrol Scouts, heading to a rendezvous in Salt Lake and Yellowstone, decided to follow the trail cautiously. The Scouts were prepared for a Sunday camp but noticed a piny smoke smell, not from their campfires. As they climbed the gulch, they saw the man leading his horse away. The Scouts, accustomed to long trails, continued upward. They reached an open area with a view of Pilot Peak and noticed a large mass of smoke indicating a forest fire. Knowing the dry season made the area risky, they understood the danger of being trapped on a timber ridge. Vigilance and caution were essential as the smoke drifted closer, signaling a potential threat.|['1.

As we hurried up the ridge, the creek below us was narrowing, and a fire could easily leap across it. If we got hurt down there, we would be trapped as the fire spread. The best option was to head towards the open area on the opposite slope with grass and rocks, passing through a patch of aspens or willows. These trees wouldn't burn as easily, especially if they were in a bog. We all followed, shouting to warn the beaver man riding towards the fire without looking back. The wind was carrying the smoke towards the flames, but I knew it wouldn't stop the fire. We needed to reach the willows and aspens for safety before the fire intensified. The Red Fox Scouts, though panting from the altitude, hiked well as we made our way through the trees towards safety.|"['1.

We encountered many animals during our hike: rabbits, squirrels, porcupines, and numerous deer. The birds chirped and fluttered around us. The thick smoke from the burning pine trees irritated our throats, making us cough and wheeze. As we felt the heat of the fire and heard the animals in panic, we realized the urgency of our situation. Quickly, we made a decision. Climbing a tree for a better view, I saw the sky veiled in smoke, signaling the fire spreading across the ridge. With animals seeking refuge, including a coyote and a bear, we found a wet area with willows. Creating holes to collect water, we prepared for the worst.

The Red Fox Scouts showed great courage during the forest fire. Despite the intense heat and choking smoke, they remained calm and burrowed down for safety. The crackling and snapping of the fire were frightening, but they stayed still and hoped for the best. The animals around them were also scared, but everyone waited quietly. As sparks fell around them, they endured the heat, ensuring not to breathe it in. After a while, they realized they were safe from the flames. The Scouts cautiously sat up, relieved that they had weathered the worst of the fire. Their bravery and composure in the face of danger were truly remarkable.|['1.

The Red Fox Scouts and I had a close call surviving a forest fire. We found safety near the willows and wet ground. As the danger passed, the animals grew restless, signaling the end of the truce. We decided to move on, despite the risk of hot coals and blazing trees. The burnt timber was a sad sight, a result of careless campers or a campfire. Hungry and nervous, we pressed on to a bare spot on the ridge for safety. There, we spotted two men and a pack burro approaching. Hurrying towards them on the gravel path, I recognized the riders.|"['1.

The ridge's side was sliced by a deep gulch, akin to a canyon, with rocky walls and a stream meandering at the base. We paused at our edge as the trio approached and stopped at theirs. General Ashley and Fitzpatrick the Bad Hand, along with Apache the black burro, were there. The general rode Apache. I was relieved to see them. Upon learning of General Ashley's injury and their plan to camp on the opposite side, the two Red Fox Scouts, packs in tow, and I managed to navigate through the gulch to join them. It would have been unfair to let a one-armed boy tend to camp and a wounded companion alone. Fitz would have managed, but we wanted to help. They awaited us; Fitz set up camp while General Ashley rested against a rock, looking weary. He had sprained his ankle during yesterday's escape attempt and needed care. Fitz, worn out too, narrated their ordeal. They had been captured by a gang, forced to march despite the general's injury, and camped hastily in Lost Park. Their careless fire-starting led to a forest blaze behind them.|"['Question 1: Who were the individuals mentioned in the text passage?\nA) General Ashley, Apache, and Red Fox Scouts\nB) Fitzpatrick, Apache, and the gang\nC) General Ashley, Fitzpatrick, and Apache\nD) Red Fox Scouts, the gang, and Fitz\nE) General Ashley, Apache, and the Red Fox Scouts', 'Question 2: What was the name of the burro that General Ashley rode?\nA) Red Fox\nB) Bad Hand\nC) Apache\nD) Black Burro\nE) Lost Park', 'Question 3: Why did the group decide to navigate through the gulch to join General Ashley and Fitzpatrick?\nA) To avoid the gang\nB) To find a better camping spot\nC) To escape the forest blaze\nD) To help tend to camp and care for the injured\nE) To rest against a rock', ""Question 4: What injury did General Ashley sustain during yesterday's escape attempt?\nA) Broken arm\nB) Sprained ankle\nC) Wounded shoulder\nD) Burned hand\nE) Twisted knee"", 'Question 5: What led to the forest blaze behind the group?\nA) Careless fire-starting\nB) A lightning strike\nC) A campfire accident\nD) Intentional burning\nE) Wild animals', ""Question 6: Where did the group camp hastily before reaching the gulch?\nA) Lost Park\nB) Apache's Ridge\nC) Red Fox Canyon\nD) General's Gulch\nE) Fitzpatrick's Camp""]"|['C) General Ashley, Fitzpatrick, and Apache', 'C) Apache', 'D) To help tend to camp and care for the injured', 'B) Sprained ankle', 'A) Careless fire-starting', 'A) Lost Park']
Lost Park was a dense place, resembling a jungle with its thick brush that could easily catch fire. The group found themselves in a panic as the fire grew rapidly, causing confusion and separation among them. The general, unable to walk, was left behind as the others scattered. Just when things seemed dire, Apache the burro unexpectedly appeared, offering a glimmer of hope. Fitz, with his determination, helped the general onto Apache's back, and they set off to safety. Eventually, they regrouped with the rest of the Scouts, who had been signaling for them to come to council. Despite the challenges, the Scouts managed to navigate through the park, avoiding the fire and reuniting with their companions.|"['1.

"We set out on our mission, each of us carrying a blanket rolled up like soldiers, tied with a string. I had the rifle, and we packed our rations in our clothes. In my blanket, I had our lariat rope, just in case. It was around ten o'clock when we finally began our journey. The trail was over a day old, but our Scouts had left it clear for us to follow. I'm sixteen, Kit Carson is thirteen, and little Jed Smith is only twelve, so we matched our pace to theirs. Carrying the blanket roll became tiring after a few miles. We only stopped twice before we found a warning sign on the ground that read, ""Look out!"" The trail led us to a spot where the Scouts had spotted the enemy. Following the arrow, we continued on the new path. We had to be cautious, as the sun was scorching, and we hadn't even stopped for food. By mid-afternoon, after five hours on the trail, we reached a dangerous area with smoke lingering in the air. This signaled trouble, as it wasn't the kind of smoke Scouts would make.

We discovered signs of a campfire spreading in the forest. As we investigated, we found clues left behind by the campers. From tracks and items left behind, we deduced that the burro thieves had joined forces with the camp. The camp seemed to have been hastily abandoned, with cut ropes and forgotten items like bacon suggesting a quick departure. The unsanitary conditions and cigarette butts hinted at the involvement of a town gang. Despite the chaos, we found evidence that the Scout prisoners had been tied up and led away by the burros. The mystery deepened as we uncovered more clues, piecing together the events that had unfolded in the forest as dusk settled in, and Jed Smith fell ill from drinking creek water.|['1.

Little Jed Smith had a terrible headache from the heat and hard work. His tongue seemed fine, so I thought it was just fatigue and an upset stomach. We wrapped him in a dry blanket and let him rest with a wet cloth on his eyes. I gave him some aconite for his fever. Meanwhile, General Ashley and Thomas Fitzpatrick were held captive by a gang, the beaver man was delivering our message, and Jim Bridger was scouting in another direction. As dusk fell, Kit Carson and I prepared our camp for the night. While making tea, we heard a ranger approaching. Although tired, he joined us for supper. We shared bread and bacon, and Jed felt better after eating. We slept well under the stars, with Jed in the warm middle spot. The next morning, I woke early and went hunting for breakfast but decided to let a rabbit go as it was Sunday. We returned to camp for a simple breakfast of tea, bread, and bacon.|['1.

After a while, the trail crossed a creek at a shallow spot and climbed up the side of a hill. Before reaching the top, we crawled and cautiously peeked over, like Indian scouts, to survey the area. The hilltop was clear of any enemies. Pausing for a moment, we could spot Pilot Peak and the snowy range where we, the Scouts, needed to deliver a message. We suspected that the gang with prisoners was also heading to cross the range with the message in hand. Determined to intercept them, we quickened our pace. As we traversed the hill, it opened into a plateau with low cedars and scrubby pines, offering a view of the snowy range and Pilot Peak. After a few hours of hiking, we noticed a forest fire in the distance. Despite the thick smoke, we continued our journey, knowing that it was our duty to help extinguish the fire as responsible citizens.|"['1.

The fire line resembled an old wood-road, cleared of trees and brush, extending through the timber, over a point, and into a valley. As the fire approached, we divided into patrols to stamp out the flames. Animals fled from the fire, creating a spectacle of deer, coyotes, rabbits, and even a wolf. The fire crept slowly, with crackling sounds and hot gusts. The dragon-like fire advanced, consuming bushes and trees. We fought back, stomping and beating out the flames. The smoke and heat were intense, but we managed to control the fire. The wind helped disperse the smoke, and we successfully contained the fire, protecting the forest.|"['1.

It was scorching work, even for a Sunday. The smoke clouded our vision, and the air felt like it was on fire. Pine wood burns fiercely. My task was to dash back and forth along the fire line, stomping out the flames. My shoes were singed, my face felt like it was blistering, and the sweat poured down. But we held our ground against the dragon. The area inside my section was charred, and I could link up with Jed. Together, we battled the flames, but the dragon fought back fiercely. The wind picked up, carrying embers that we had to catch. We had to be vigilant, ready to stamp out any sparks. We stood firm, and eventually, the dragon retreated. As we were extinguishing the last embers, a man emerged from a rocky canyon, battered and scorched by the fire. We rushed to his aid, guiding him to safety. His tale of survival was harrowing, but he had made it through the inferno.|"['1.

As he mumbled, we gently placed him beyond the fire line. It seemed impossible to move him any further. Kit hurried to fetch water, Jed rushed to grab first-aid supplies, and I conducted an examination. His face and hands were blistered, possibly his eyes too, with a bloody wound on his left leg. Without scissors or a sharp knife and water, I couldn't do much. Kit returned with muddy water, which he drank eagerly. Jed brought more supplies, and we began to tend to him. However, it was too late. Upon inspecting his undershirt, we found a familiar item hanging from a cord - a package with our private mark. We demanded an explanation, and he recognized us from a previous encounter. It was clear that he was the beaver man. We learned valuable information from him, but we had to be cautious not to overwhelm him with questions.|"['1.

We carefully tended to the injured man's burns, cleaning and covering them with carbolized vaseline and gauze. Despite his wound on the leg, we refrained from probing too deeply, opting to apply boric powder and a sterile gauze pad instead. The man claimed he had run into a stick, not a bullet. When he threatened us, we stood our ground, unswayed by his attempts to intimidate or bribe us. Although we had the upper hand, we treated him with respect, ensuring he sat down comfortably. We explained the importance of abiding by game laws to preserve wildlife, a lesson ingrained in us as Scouts. Our actions were guided by principles of compassion and integrity.|"[""1.

The Ranger swiftly rode down the fire line, covered in ashes and sweat. He had successfully extinguished the fire and noticed the injured Jack. The Ranger acknowledged the children's first-aid efforts and decided to take Jack to safety. He commended the kids, suggesting they accompany him to his cabin for the night.

The Ranger assured us that the forest fire was contained and would burn out on its own. He left a team to monitor it while he reported to headquarters. If the fire had crossed the line and reached the willows, it would have been a week-long battle. As we trekked through the woods towards the snowy range, the sun began to set. At the top of a ridge, we could see Pilot Peak and the sun setting beside it. The Ranger surveyed the area for a better vantage point. In the distance, smoke rose from the fire we had fought earlier. Suddenly, we noticed smoke signals from our fellow Scouts, signaling that they were safe. Relief washed over us as we awaited their arrival, celebrating our reunion with joy and excitement.|['1.

"When Major Henry handed over the message packet with a salute to the general, our joy knew no bounds.

As the evening darkened, we realized our provisions were scarce, with only a bit of bacon and some supplies from the Major Henry party.

Red Fox Scout Ward spoke to his partner about the Ranger's plan to strike the railroad on the other side. They decided to accompany the Elks to that point. Despite having a better outfit, they were determined not to rely on the Elks. They packed up the camp, put out the fire, and set off following the Ute trail towards Pilot Peak. The Red Fox Scouts carried their own gear, refusing to burden Apache. The travel was smooth as they crossed the flat mesa. The forest fire aftermath was visible in the distance. They continued their journey, hunting rabbits and catching trout. Despite initial differences, they learned to appreciate the unique strengths of each group.|"[""1.

"Van Sant chuckled, ""I admit, you know more about mining than I do. My father owns the mine, but it's the hard work of folks like you and your father that make it valuable. I'm truly sorry about your injury."" We cooked while they cleaned their game. Over time, we realized the Red Fox Scouts were trustworthy, despite being from the East. We shared resources and became one group. Resting at camp that night was a welcomed break. The next day, we trekked along the creek and a faint trail towards the pass. The climb was tough, but we neared Pilot Peak. The air grew cooler as we reached around eleven thousand feet. The trail meandered through aspens, pines, and wildflowers, with the stream teeming with native trout. We followed an old Indian trail, feeling like the first white explorers in the area.

Major Henry studied the map and identified Medicine Lake. He suggested camping there instead of attempting the pass due to the availability of wood, water, and less wind. The trail led to a basin overlooking the lake at the foot of Pilot Peak, surrounded by pointed pines and a steep slope. The lake, dark as ink, revealed its depth with specks dancing in the sunlit water. Despite trying to fish with flies and spinners, the Scouts had no luck catching the elusive mountain lake-trout. The serene night with a full moon casting light on the lake and mountain created a tranquil atmosphere. The Scouts enjoyed the peaceful setting, with the burro Apache staying close for companionship in the wilderness.|['1.

Tonight, Apache, our burro, got restless and tried to snuggle with us in our sleeping bags. Startled, we all woke up to find him shaking and snorting. He even attempted to join another tent before something in the bushes made a strange noise. It turned out to be a bear! Swiftly, we all sprang into action, making noise and scaring the bear away. After the commotion settled, we realized poor Apache was just scared of the bear, seeking safety with us. We calmed him down, fixed the tent, and eventually drifted back to sleep under the moonlit sky, grateful for Apache's loyalty despite the unexpected nighttime adventure.|"['1.

We couldn't catch any fish for breakfast as they ignored all bait. We ended up having the last of the meat and some condensed sausage from the Red Fox Scouts. During breakfast, we gathered for a discussion. Major Henry suggested climbing Pilot Peak, but it would take too long. Instead, he proposed traveling at night under the moonlight for fun. Despite knowing our main task was delivering a message quickly, we all agreed to climb Pilot Peak. As we began our journey, Apache, our loyal companion, joined us.

The bright sun made us sweat as we climbed up the draw, following Major Henry in a line. We reached a ledge overlooking the lake, our camp, and the forest we had passed. The ledge was wide, grassy, and flat, with rocks behind it. From there, we could see the mesa in the distance. We paused to catch our breath and admire the view. Major Henry led us up further, around the rimrock, through a maze of large rocks. We encountered snow patches and a river forming from the melting snow. Birds chirped and pecked among the drifts, resembling gray speckled Brahmas. Despite their tameness, we didn't harm them, respecting their choice to live in such a rugged environment. The slope led us to a moraine with huge boulders piled like pebbles, revealing the vastness of the landscape below as we continued our ascent.|['1.

Crossing the boulder moraine was a challenging journey. Climbing up and down, we encountered rock-rabbits, small creatures resembling guinea-pigs with flat bat ears. They busily gathered dried grass for their winter nests among the boulders. Despite Apache's struggles navigating the terrain, we pressed on, knowing he would catch up later. Eventually, we conquered the boulder field, reaching the summit of Pilot Peak at fourteen thousand feet. Sitting atop the peak, surrounded by hills and valleys, we marveled at the silence and vastness below.

We had a grand opportunity to chart the land beyond the pass. After a thorough examination, we found it to be a rugged region, much like where we started, with dense forests, rolling hills, and deep valleys. In the distance, we spotted what seemed to be a town called Green Valley, our destination! Excited, we made a rough map with Pilot Peak as our reference point. Major Henry marked a reddish peak as another landmark towards the town. Our path was to head west from Pilot, skirting the reddish tip. As we descended, we enjoyed a meal, bid farewell to Pilot Peak, and retraced our steps. While navigating rocky terrain and lush meadows, we encountered a bear family peacefully feasting on berries. Little Jed bravely attempted to divert them, only to face a surprise encounter with a large, protective she bear and her cubs.|"['1.

Kit and little Jed dodged as the old bear passed swiftly towards her cubs. Jed tumbled into the brush as the bear approached her young ones. The bear sniffed her cubs, then lifted her head and growled. Everyone froze, knowing any movement might provoke her. Meanwhile, Fitzpatrick was capturing photos right in front of the bear, which seemed to anger her. The bear charged towards them, prompting a yell from the group. Despite the chaos, Red Fox Scout Van Sant arrived, shooting at the bear with his twenty-two. While the bear was stung by the shots, it didn't deter her. Fitz continued taking pictures, eventually winning a prize for one. As the bear closed in on them, Van Sant calmly aimed and fired just in time to stop her.|"['1.

Quickly, the group witnessed the brave actions of Van Sant, who skillfully took down the bear that had injured Jed. With the bear now lifeless, the team rallied around Jed, who was injured but alive. His shoulder dislocated and leg wounded, the team sprang into action. Major Henry expertly reset Jed's shoulder, causing some pain but successfully realigning the joint. They then tended to Jed's calf wound, cleaning it thoroughly and applying gauze and adhesive plaster to aid in healing. Despite the ordeal, Jed remained strong and resilient, showing true courage in the face of danger.

We left Jed, who looked pale but grateful, with Red Fox Scout Ward and approached the bear. Kit Carson wanted to examine her. She was still lifeless, and on the fringes of the brush, her two cubs were investigating her scent, curious and attempting to understand. The sight of the large, motionless body of the mother bear made us somber. We hadn't intended to harm her, as she was only protecting her cubs. The mountain wasn't ours, nor was the berry patch. She had found it first. We had intruded on her territory, not the other way around. It was all a misunderstanding. Kit Carson and I tried to retrieve the burro that had fled up the mountain in a nervous state, eluding our attempts to catch him. The old bear had been skinned and prepared for transport. Initially, there was talk of going back to camp for a blanket to carry Jed, who was weak and unwell. However, Jed was eager to move and didn't want to delay for a blanket. We devised a plan. Scouts always find solutions. We fashioned a makeshift stretcher out of the bear hide. Gathering dead sticks from the aspens, we threaded them through holes in the bear pelt's front and hind legs, securing them with cord. Placing Jed on the fur side facing the bear's head, which was folded back over, the Major, the two Red Fox Scouts, and Kit Carson each took hold of an|"[""1.

After a challenging journey, the group returned to camp with the wounded Jed. Despite setbacks, they decided to make the best of the situation. They planned to care for Jed and Kit Carson, who would stay behind. The group prepared bear meat for drying and smoked it over a fire. They used aspen wood for smoke and worked late into the night.

We had breakfast with bear steak and bread, along with biscuits and gravy. The smoked meat we were drying looked great. After airing the tarp, we left the strips to dry in the sun. By noon, they were as brittle as old leather. The hide was also dry and ready for further processing. Kit would handle that. After preparing the cabin for Jed and Kit, we were set to continue our journey. Major Henry decided it was time to move. Scout Carson was tasked with looking after Scout Smith until he could travel. We left supplies for them and divided our belongings among us. Major Henry suggested traveling day and night to make up for lost time. With our group reduced, we resumed our journey, following the trail towards the pass. The landscape was desolate, marked by jagged peaks and snow.

As we left Old Pilot Peak behind, the landscape transformed into lush meadows and valleys. Following a gentle stream, we realized we had crossed the pass and reached the other side of the Medicine Range. Excited, we continued downhill, passing dwarf cedars and buck brush. At dusk, we stopped by a stream for supper under the golden twilight among aspens. Later, the moon rose, illuminating our path as we enjoyed jerked bear-meat and coffee. Major Henry signaled our departure, and we set off under the moonlit night. The serene atmosphere was filled with the sounds of nature, from coyotes to rabbits. Our journey continued westward guided by the North Star, leading us through a picturesque valley with scattered pines and a gentle stream. Along the way, we stumbled upon signs of a previous camp, reminding us to be cautious and avoid potential hazards. After a hearty meal and a peaceful rest, we awoke refreshed, ready to continue our adventure.|"['1.

I woke up around three in the morning, just as the moon was setting in the west. The air felt chilly, signaling the approach of dawn. As I lay there, I heard the crackling of sticks and the sound of a match being struck. Someone was already up, starting a fire nearby. The east began to lighten, with fewer stars visible as the horizon brightened. We followed the burro tracks down the valley, heading towards the south-west where we believed the railroad was. Suddenly, our leader, Red Fox Scout Van Sant, signaled us to halt. Ahead, we spotted a camp with a lean-to, a blackened fire, and two figures wrapped in blankets. There was a burro nearby, eyeing us warily. It seemed like a hostile camp, so Fitz was tasked with investigating while we waited anxiously in hiding.|['1.

It was an exciting moment as we watched Fitz, a one-armed Elk Scout, demonstrate his exceptional roping skills. With precision and determination, Fitz approached Sally, a wild horse, cautiously. With his rope ready, he made a swift and accurate throw, capturing Sally with ease. The other scouts and I held our breath, amazed by Fitz's skill and bravery. Despite the campers sleeping nearby, Fitz successfully roped Sally, showcasing his dedication and talent. As he led Sally back to us, we couldn't help but feel proud and impressed by his achievement.

After a while, I rejoined them, and Sally was packed with the squaw hitch. We felt relieved to lighten our loads. Everything seemed promising as we headed towards the railroad to catch a train to Salt Lake. However, Major Henry suddenly stopped due to cramps.

The group noticed the major's discomfort after he consumed something hot, causing tears in his eyes. Initially feeling better, he soon worsened with a crampy stomach. Concerned, they suspected it might be appendicitis. With caution, they applied cold water and gave him Epsom salts to alleviate the pain.

Fitz and Ward gave us a quick handshake before we set off into the dim light, leaving the two women behind. Our mission was a forty-mile night ride, with twenty miles to the mines and back. We followed the main trail for half a mile until reaching a bridge, then turned right at a gate onto a hay road through a field. After crossing the field and another gate, we took a trail up to the mesa. The remaining nineteen miles lay ahead to the mines, guided by their lights that never ceased. We rode at a steady pace, avoiding exhausting the horses too soon. The dark, cloudy night obscured the stars and moon, relying solely on the horses to navigate the trail.

We journeyed tirelessly, through hills and valleys, fearing we were lost. Van's spirits wavered, and I dared not discuss our doubts. With determination, we hastened our pace, hoping to reach the doctor in time. Suddenly, a cluster of lights ahead signaled the mines. Relief washed over us, dispelling our weariness and uncertainty. As we approached, a young doctor emerged, ready to assist. The return journey felt shorter, knowing we were on the right path. The doctor shared stories, easing our worries about the major. At dawn, we arrived back at the ranch, greeted by Fitz. Despite our exhaustion, we were grateful for our efforts, knowing we had done our best.|"[""1.

The young doctor took charge, with Major Henry's approval. Despite the major's weakness, he showed courage. The doctor offered Red Fox Scout Van Sant and me a choice between sleep and fishing. Since it was Sunday and we didn't need fish, we opted to rest briefly. Ready to assist, we laid down in the bunk-house. The major, recovering from an appendix operation, needed careful nursing. The doctor praised our initial first-aid care, crucial in saving the major's life. The doctor emphasized the importance of continuous hygiene and attention to prevent infection.

We had promised not to use any horse or assistance, but we didn't mention it. It didn't feel right to leave the major for even a few hours. The Red Fox Scouts had to continue to the railroad for their Yellowstone trip, while Fitz and I stayed to care for the major. The doctor assured us the major would recover in five days, but the message we were supposed to deliver would be late. Despite our efforts, the major was still worried about the message. We assured him we had done our best as Scouts and would stay by his side. His temperature had risen, but otherwise, he seemed fine. The Red Fox Scouts planned to leave early the next morning.

Van explained that he and the Red Foxes would take care of the major while he was away, as they were trained in first aid. The doctor had given them instructions, and the major would be back soon. Van reassured that they wouldn't miss their trip and would handle any issues with the major. The major expressed his concern about dropping out due to his injury, but Van encouraged him not to worry.

Red Foxes Ward and Van Sant took turns on night duty to ensure we Elks were rested for the day's journey. Early in the morning, we prepared our own breakfast to not disturb the two women. The major, having had a good night's rest, was awake and eager to meet us. After saluting him, we set off on the trail. As we left, we exchanged salutes with the Red Foxes. The day looked gloomy with mist hinting at rain. Despite the challenging weather, we pressed on, carrying an important message with only twenty-one miles left to cover. The trail followed the creek uphill, and we anticipated a slow journey due to the terrain.

We hurriedly dashed through the pouring rain, hand in hand, as the roaring water chased us down the gulch. Fitz led the way, knowing we had to reach the other side quickly. The creek had turned into a swirling mass of yellow, but we pressed on, struggling against the strong current. Fitz forged ahead, and I followed closely, stumbling over hidden rocks. As we reached the opposite slope, the deafening roar behind us grew louder. Exhausted, we paused to catch our breath, watching as a massive wave of muck surged past, carrying debris with it.

Fitz and I trudged on through the steaming ground as the sun dried our clothes. Despite the excitement, my head throbbed, and things seemed strange. The hike left me hungry and dizzy. After tossing our soaked lunch, we relied on supper in Green Valley. Determined, we pressed forward, with Fitz leading the way. As we trekked through brush and trees, my head pounded.

"On page 3, we learn about the old-time ""scouts"" of the Western plains and mountains. While many of them were selfish and focused only on personal gain, there were trapper-explorers like General William H. Ashley, Kit Carson, Thomas Fitzpatrick, Jedediah S. Smith, and Jim Bridger who made valuable contributions. General Ashley encouraged Americans to explore the Western country and led expeditions that helped train young trapper-scouts. Kit Carson, known for his bravery and kindness, assisted army and Government expeditions. Thomas Fitzpatrick, despite being called ""Bad Hand,"" served as a guide and Government agent. Jedediah S. Smith, the Knight in Buckskin, was a true Christian who led a party to California. Jim Bridger discovered the Great Salt Lake and Yellowstone Park.

On page 4, we learn the story of Captain Andrew Summers Rowan, who was tasked with delivering a message to General Garcia of the Cuban Army during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Despite not knowing Garcia's exact location, Captain Rowan embarked on the mission without hesitation, successfully finding Garcia in the depths of the jungle and returning with the desired report.

"On page 6, a ""tarp"" is described as a versatile piece of canvas used by Boy Scouts for shelter. It is wide enough to tuck in comfortably, long enough to cover with room for the feet, and heavy enough to withstand wind and water. The tarp can be set up as a shelter-tent by adding brass eyes along the edges. The diamond hitch, a method to secure loads on animals like burros and horses, is also explained. It forms a diamond shape when tightened and comes in single or double styles. The hitch keeps loads flat, is easy to adjust, and doesn't jam.

Warriors in ancient tribes used arrows of different lengths but ensured each warrior used arrows of the same length to shoot consistently. They marked their arrows uniquely, either by length or the pattern of feathers. Some tribes used two feathers, others three. Scouts could also mark their arrows in a similar manner. Bows and arrows were favored by Scouts for their silence, affordability, ease of making, and effectiveness. The lariat rope, typically thirty-five to forty feet long, was a valuable tool for Scouts and cowboys, used for various tasks like catching animals. Scouts were advised to keep themselves clean and neat on the march, sharing a war-bag within their Patrol for personal items. Tea was recommended over coffee for its benefits on the trail, being lighter and quicker to make.

"In the old days, the Indian walk and the scout walk were unique. They walked straight-footed to cover the ground with the least resistance. Turning the foot sideways wasted energy. To get the most out of their leg muscles, they pushed their toes backward. George Catlin, a famous Indian painter, learned to walk this way. The Indians used sign language, a silent way to communicate through hand motions, body language, and facial expressions. Scouts today find this language valuable for silent communication in times of danger. Different tribes had unique signs; for example, Fitzpatrick's sign for ""Watch!"" was raising two fingers in front of the face. Jim Bridger had signs for ""Horseback!"" and ""Wolf!"" Each sign was sensible and intuitive, conveying messages without words."|"['1.

"Scouts can easily learn sign language as the motions directly represent the objects. A skilled signer can tell elaborate stories using swift hand movements, much like speaking syllables. For instance, the sign for ""Bird flying"" involves raising both hands by the shoulders, palms forward, and waving them like wings. To set up a Scout or cowboy tarp bed, lay out the tarp flat, place blankets on top, fold it in half, tuck one edge under to create a sleeping bag. This setup ensures equal bedding above and below. A reflector can act as a portable oven for baking dough by reflecting heat onto it. Maintaining dental hygiene is crucial for Scouts, as clean teeth and a washed mouth are essential for feeling prepared for the day. In case of missing fish hooks, Scouts can fashion makeshift fishing tools using bones or nails. To dry wet boots or shoes, stuffing them with newspaper, warm pebbles, or dead grass helps absorb moisture and speed up the drying process."|"['1.

Scouts are advised to keep a journal of their daily adventures to improve memory and organizational skills. They should also practice using both hands and feet equally. Weather signs in mountainous regions differ from those in flat areas, with night-caps indicating impending rain. The change of the moon is believed to affect weather patterns, and sun-dogs signal cold weather. Scouts should be cautious during thunderstorms, avoiding seeking shelter under lone trees. It's essential to have dental check-ups before embarking on outdoor activities to prevent toothaches. Sleeping on higher ground is recommended to stay dry, and cooking over a small fire is more efficient than a large one. Remember, predicting mountain weather can be tricky, so it's best to stay cautious.|['1.

"On page 49, the Elk Scouts used brass eyes on their tarps to create low shelter-tents. The United States Army uses ""pup"" tents for small shelters. Carrying guns for protection against wild animals is unnecessary; most animals fear humans. Guns can cause more harm than good. The Army Pack Transportation Department requires kindness towards mules, as they remember mistreatment. Boy Scouts understand that kindness is crucial when dealing with animals. Scouts should respect wildlife near camp and avoid reckless shooting. Scouts should rotate guard duty to ensure everyone gets enough rest. Trails are made up of signs like footprints, broken twigs, or disturbed dew. Private signs can be left by patrols to communicate with each other.

"Note 36, page 88: ""Parole"" refers to a promise not to escape, especially in war when a high-ranking prisoner gives their word not to flee. This pledge can grant the prisoner some freedom within set boundaries. At times, the prisoner is entirely set free based on their vow not to engage in combat for the duration of the conflict. Paroles are taken seriously, and breaking them is considered dishonorable. It is crucial to uphold one's word, even if the other party acts dishonestly. Note 37, page 89: The signal for escape involves crossing the wrists and pulling them apart as if breaking free. Another sign is extending the hand in front of the hip and pushing it upward, mimicking climbing. Note 38, page 94: A method to bind a prisoner's arms involves tying the thumbs and little fingers after placing the hands together behind the back. This restraint can be done using basic cord or even a strip of fabric. Note 39, page 100: When lost, individuals tend to veer left due to stepping farther with the right foot, eventually circling back. Scouts should monitor their direction and correct their course to avoid getting lost. In mountainous terrain, landmarks guide the way, while traveling along streams can lead to safety.

"Scouts in the old days had to start fires with flint and steel, a skill modern Scouts should practice. If the ground is wet, a fire can be started in a frying pan. Matches are handy but need to be kept dry. They can be stored in a corked bottle or coated in paraffin for waterproofing. Dampness can be removed by rubbing them quickly between the palms. A rifle can be used to start a fire by shooting powder into tinder. The Big Dipper points to the North Star, which is the Clock of the Heavens. The ""Guardians of the Pole"" are stars in the Big Dipper's cup. The ""Pointers"" in the Big Dipper help track time and move about two hours each month.

On page 116, the Red Fox Scouts carried liquid antiseptic soap for wounds. It comes in small bottles with shaker stoppers. A few drops in water make a great wash for wounds. Druggists have this soap. It's safe for gargling and external use, better than other washes. The Scouts' first-aid kit should include surgeons' adhesive tape, absorbent cotton, and gauze. On page 124, Bichloride of mercury is a strong antiseptic in Bernay's tablets for disinfecting. They dissolve in water but are poisonous if ingested. Potash and borax in tablet form are good for wounds. Wounds must be surgically clean to avoid blood poisoning. On page 133, Scouts can use a rope or cloth to climb large trees for better grip. On page 140, Scouts should know Morse code for wigwag messages. American Morse has dots, dashes, and spaces, while Continental Morse has no spaces. The Army and Navy use the Myer alphabet for wigwag signaling.|"['1.

"The Army and Navy have developed an alphabet for signaling that is easier to read. The motions are done without pauses or lengthening to form spaces that help create Morse letters. Each letter is signaled continuously without breaks. Wigwagging uses two flags: a white flag with a red square for dark backgrounds and a red flag with a white square for the sky or mixed backgrounds. In emergencies, anything can be used, even a hat, cap, handkerchief, or arm. The signals should be sharp, quick, and distinct with a vertical space between each motion and a pause between words. The Army's signaling speed with the large service flag is five or six words per minute. Night signaling can be done with a searchlight, lantern, torch, colored fires, bombs, or rockets. For daytime signaling, the mirror or heliograph system is favored by the United States Army. The Semaphore system is used by the United States Navy, similar to semaphore block signals of railroads. Scouts should have the ""Manual of Visual Signaling"" booklet by the United States Signal Corps for reference. The Indians had their signaling systems using smoke codes, mirror flashes, blanket-waving, pony-running, foot-running, and hand gestures. Their secret signals were never revealed, and even white men living with them could not learn them."|['1.

"Scouts use various signals to communicate important messages. Circular or back-and-forth movements on a hillside indicate the level of excitement or danger. Fast motions signify urgency, while movements in plain view suggest that danger is not immediate. However, if actions are concealed, the threat is close. A sudden stop and hiding signal imminent danger. Scouts can relay messages through foot movements using codes like circles and figure eights. Two-arm signals are more effective for long distances. For instance, both arms wide can mean ""Go back"" or ""Halt."" In case of injuries like a sprain, immediate and proper treatment is crucial to prevent long-term damage. A sprained joint should be kept elevated and treated with cold water initially. A cache, a hiding spot used by scouts, was a common practice among trappers to store excess supplies underground discreetly to avoid detection."|['1.

Not all caches are the same. Some are holes, while others are caves in banks. When modern Scouts create a cache, they must carefully record the location to avoid losing it. Although it may seem easy to remember landmarks like trees and rocks, retrieving a hidden item can be tricky. Just like misplacing a rabbit while chasing another or searching for a golf ball in a known location, caches can be challenging to find. It is important for Scouts to be well-prepared with trail medicine kits. Homeopathic remedies like aconite, Dover's Powder, quinine, and other simple treatments can be essential in emergencies. It is crucial for Scouts to prioritize their health by following basic rules such as keeping a cool head, warm feet, and maintaining regular bowel movements. Preventing forest fires is also vital, as many are caused by human carelessness, especially with campfires. Scouts should be vigilant and help extinguish any unattended fires to protect the environment.|['1.

"When dealing with wounds, it's best to avoid unnecessary poking or prodding. Just like a surgeon may leave a bullet in place if it's not causing harm to vital areas, Scouts should refrain from constantly disturbing deep wounds. Instead, cleaning the wound with hot water and gently removing visible debris with sterilized forceps is sufficient. Bandaging the wound loosely and allowing nature to take its course is often the best approach. When it comes to packing animals like horses and mules for the trail, using hobbles or picket ropes can help them graze freely and stay safe. Hobbles can be made from soft rope or purchased as leather strips with cuffs for their legs. Picket ropes should be securely looped around the animal's neck to prevent choking and ensure they can graze comfortably. If no trees or bushes are available, a ""dead-man"" method can be used by tying the rope to a buried stick or stone to keep the animal secure."|"['1.

When animals graze freely, a useful trick is to let a loose rope about twenty or thirty feet long dangle from their necks while they eat. This method, used by Indians, trappers, and cowboys, allows for easy capture if the animal refuses to be bridled or handled. The trailing rope was relied upon by Indians and trappers while riding, enabling them to quickly mount again if thrown off. Scouts should remember that flowers and animals both have their place and should not be needlessly harmed. Scouts can also learn basic first aid skills like fixing dislocations, which can be distinguished from fractures by certain signs. In emergencies, Scouts can fashion makeshift stretchers using blankets or coats and poles. Additionally, jerking meat is a traditional method for preserving food, particularly in dry climates like the Western plains and mountains. Jerked meat can provide a quick and nourishing snack for Scouts on the move.|"[""1.

"When a camp is in a hurry, the meat may be hung over a slow fire to dry faster. The Elks smoked the meat to cure it quickly. Some people use salt, sprinkling it on fresh strips and wrapping them in the animal's hide to pickle for a day. However, salt isn't necessary; the Indians and old-time scout trappers didn't use salt. Trappers sometimes used gunpowder as a substitute for salt. After a buffalo hunt, Indian villages were adorned with jerked meat on scaffolds and teepees. Traders and emigrants dried meat by stringing it along their wagons as they traveled. To dress skins, they were stretched between pegs or over a log, scraped to remove the inner coating, dried, treated with a brain-water mixture, and smoked. Aluminum is safe for cooking, unlike tin which can release toxins. ""Levez!"" means ""Rise!"" in French, a call used by old-time scouts and trappers."|"['1.
