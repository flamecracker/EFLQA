Let me tell you about the Awgwas, a dreadful race that caused Claus much trouble and tried to take away the children's best friend. These creatures were neither mortal nor immortal but existed between these two states. The Awgwas were invisible to most people but not to immortals. They had the ability to move swiftly through the air and influence humans to do wicked things. The most evil among them was the King Awgwa, and the rest obeyed his commands. Their main pastime was to incite anger in children, making them fight and disobey. Claus, by giving children toys that made them happy, kept them safe from the Awgwas' influence. The Awgwas kidnapped Claus to a dark forest, but he sought help from magical creatures to return home.|"['1.

Claus found himself seated near his door, bewildered by his sudden return to the Laughing Valley. After sharing his ordeal with Queen Zurline and the Wood-Nymphs, the Queen sealed his home with the power of the Fairies, Ryls, and Knooks to thwart the Awgwas' evil plans. Despite the protection, the Awgwas ambushed Claus on his way to the village, snatching the toys he made for the children. Disheartened but determined, Claus continued crafting toys, only to have them stolen repeatedly. The Awgwas' interference prevented Claus from spreading joy to the children.

Ak, the immortal, sternly addressed the Awgwas, a transient race, claiming they are neither mortal nor immortal. He warned them of their impending doom for defying him. The King Awgwa, enraged, threatened to kill Claus, a friend of the Master Woodsman, within three days. Despite the Awgwas' powerful army, including dragons, giants, demons, and goblins, the Master Woodsman remained confident in their victory. The Awgwas, fearing defeat, gathered their evil allies for battle. On the third day, the Awgwas faced the immortals in a great battle. The King Awgwa, filled with wicked pride, believed he would triumph. But the Master Woodsman and his people, though inexperienced in warfare, prepared to face the evil forces without mercy.|"['1.

In the Valley, the Master Woodsman led the little immortals armed with various weapons. The Ryls had sharp thorns, the Knooks carried spears, the Fairies had golden wands, and the Wood-nymphs wielded ash switches. Despite the Awgwa King's laughter, the immortals fought bravely. The Woodsman deflected a stone thrown by the Awgwa King. Giants attacked the Knooks, Goblins the Ryls, and Dragons the Fairies. The Nymphs, protected by their magic ash switches, turned their foes into earth clods. After the battle, the Giants fled, the Goblins perished, and the Awgwas became earthen hillocks. Claus, known for making toys, brought joy to children far and wide. He made dolls, animal figures, drums, whistles, and horns, spreading happiness wherever he went. In winter, unable to travel due to deep snow and Jack Frost's mischief, Claus stayed in the Laughing Valley, preparing for his next journey.|['1.

Claus was amazed by the deer's ability to walk effortlessly on the deep snow. He quickly constructed a rough sledge and harnessed Glossie and Flossie to it.

Claus, after making a deal with the Knook Prince, decided to focus on creating toys for children all year round, delivering them on Christmas Eve. Realizing he needed a larger, stronger sledge for the toys, he sought help from the Gnome King to exchange toys for steel runners. With the new runners and the Knooks' assistance, he built a spacious and colorful sledge. He also prepared a team of ten reindeer, ensuring they were strong, swift, and beautiful through special plants and baths. Peter Knook provided leather for the reindeer harness, made from the skins of aged lions. Claus improved the toys with ideas from immortals, making them more interactive and attractive.
