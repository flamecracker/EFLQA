Professor Brice mentioned that the heating plant needed repairs, so instead of closing for ten days, they will shut down for three weeks. Slugger Brown and Nappy Martell met with Colonel Colby privately, their conversation unknown to the other cadets. The Rovers focused on studying for upcoming exams, excelling in their studies except with Professor Asa Lemm. They engaged in a snowball fight organized by the cadets, with Jack capturing the fort's flag. The next day, the Rover boys visited a hill for sledding and decided to check out Mike O'Toole's goats. Mike O'Toole, a friendly Irish farmer, had goats he used to pull wagons in the city. The boys were curious about the goats, sparking an idea in Andy's mind.|"['1.

The cadets decided to use goats to play a prank on Professor Lemm. They harnessed the goats to a bobsled and led them to Colby Hall. The goats were decorated with Professor Lemm's clothes and led up a fire-escape to his room. The boys placed sheets of ice in his bed and on the floor for him to slide on.

The cadets quickly set up sheets of ice on the bed and floor, hiding them with bedspreads and waiting for Professor Lemm. The mischievous plan involved making him slip on the ice. As the professor entered his room, chaos ensued as he slipped and fell multiple times on the hidden ice sheets. Confused and angry, he accused the boys of the prank.

In the dim light, the teacher mistook two crouching figures for mischievous boys. Suddenly, a goat named Patrick lunged at him, causing chaos. Startled, the teacher struggled to stand but slipped on ice sheets, only to be pounced on by the other goat. The room filled with cries as cadets watched in amusement, including Slugger and Nappy. The teacher threatened suspension, demanding the Colonel. Patrick, feeling threatened, leaped at the teacher again, causing more chaos. The goats then charged through the hallway, knocking down cadets, including Codfish, who tumbled down the stairs.|['1.

The two goats caused quite a commotion at the school, running around until the Rovers guided them to a lower hallway. Jack and Fred acted quickly, opening a side door. Luckily, the goats didn't go far, and Jack approached them with vegetables to calm them down. Walt, son of Dan Baxter, boldly decided to sneak the goats' harness back into the school without being caught. As they settled the goats back in the stable, Jack decided not to leave a note or money, hoping to avoid trouble with O'Toole. Meanwhile, inside the school, Asa Lemm was furious, demanding punishment for the chaos caused by the goats. Colonel Colby, trying to conceal his amusement, helped clean up the mess while reminiscing about his own school pranks.|"['1.

Colonel Colby decided to postpone the investigation until the next day due to the late hour. He instructed all the cadets to go to bed. A group of mischievous cadets had placed sheets of ice under Asa Lemm's bed, causing him to wake up wet and cold. Asa Lemm was furious and had to change his clothes and get the wet mattress replaced. The master of the Hall sympathized with Asa Lemm, noting that boys will be boys and practical jokes were common. Colonel Colby insisted on addressing the matter the following day. Jack, unaware of the prank, denied involvement but was mistaken as one cadet had witnessed Walt Baxter and Jack using goats' harness for a prank.

Early in the morning, Asa Lemm dressed and headed to Nappy's room, where he found the group of friends gathered, just as he suspected. They were discussing the previous night's incident and speculating on who might be responsible. Codfish, eager to see others in trouble but wary of being implicated himself, suggested informing Colonel Colby. Asa Lemm, still upset about the events of the night before, noticed a letter slid under his door. Upon reading it, he learned that John Rover and Walter Baxter were allegedly involved. Asa Lemm quickly pointed fingers at them, citing previous classroom issues. Meanwhile, Colonel Colby took charge of the situation, signaling to Walt Baxter to stay quiet. The examination was about to begin to uncover the truth behind the goat incident.|"['1.

Silas Crews rushed away, and Colonel Colby promptly informed the others of the situation. Consequently, a guard was stationed to monitor Slugger and Nappy's actions closely. It remained a mystery why Codfish was absent. The truth was, the timid Codfish had been so frightened at the thought of further mischief that he broke down in tears and secluded himself in his room, claiming illness. Slugger and Nappy managed to acquire a bottle of ink and some spoiled tomatoes. They schemed to spread a concoction of ashes, ink, and tomatoes in various locations around the school, including Colonel Colby's quarters and the offices. Unbeknownst to them, Bob Nixon observed their actions from the shadows. As they tried to leave the school, they were intercepted by Bob Nixon, Captain Dale, and Professor Brice. The events of the past day had been filled with mystery and tension for the Rover boys and their friends. Slugger and Nappy, having faced consequences for their misdeeds, hastily packed their things and departed under the scornful eyes of their peers.|"['1.

Jack expressed the importance of showing their dedication to studies to their families by writing home. They wanted their families to know that they were focused on more than just having fun and playing pranks.

"With the wind whistling sharply in their ears and blowing the snow into high drifts, the small group continued on, trying to keep pace with the experienced lumberman.

They had to climb a bit, so they took off their skates and hoisted the bobsled over the rocks. Excited shouts erupted as they spotted the hut.

Fred reacted swiftly as he fired a shot at close range, hitting the leading wolf in the throat. The wolf leaped high into the air, then crashed down, sending snow everywhere before lying motionless.

Jack Rover happily returned to the cabin after convincing Barney Stevenson to listen to Ruth's father. Barney, feeling lonely on the island, agreed to send a telegram to Ruth and her family. The next morning, Jack, accompanied by Randy, skated to Rockville to send the message. The boys had quiet days, with a light snowfall causing some worry about being snowed in. Fred suggested hunting mink to break the monotony of rabbits and squirrels. They found Barney inspecting trees for lumber, warning them about the challenges of mink hunting. Andy wondered why men wanted the island so badly. Randy was grateful for the squirrels and rabbits they caught, preventing hunger.

Uncle Barney warned the boys not to shoot more than a few minks or deer before they skated away. He felt lonely without them and decided to explore the woods.

The quiet words reverberated in the cave, startling Uncle Barney, who dropped the tin box and stood up. Slugger Brown quickly pushed his friend behind a rock and crouched down. In response, Slugger grabbed a stone and threw it at Uncle Barney, hitting him on the forehead, causing him to collapse. The boys had spent the day skating and exploring the island in search of game. After a tiring day, they built a campfire and enjoyed a leisurely meal. Later, while near the end of a frozen stream, Fred twisted his ankle. Suddenly, they spotted two wounded minks and successfully hunted them down. After a long day, they returned to the cabin, cooked supper, and awaited Uncle Barney's return. When he didn't show up, they decided to take turns staying awake in case he needed help. At dawn, they found Uncle Barney's tracks leading into the woods, followed by two other sets of tracks. They heard his faint cry for help from the cave and rushed to his aid with a flashlight.|['1.

"""I'll share my thoughts,"" stated Randy. ""They probably aimed for Rockville but feared getting lost if they crossed the island. So, they headed to the lower end instead.""
