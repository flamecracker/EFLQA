"""We're heading to the Woolworth Building,"" Mr. Bobbsey told Freddie and Bert on Broadway. Expecting to meet the rest of the family, they found Mrs. Bobbsey, Nan, and Flossie waiting in the lobby.

Mr. Bobbsey explained the use of express elevators to reach the top quickly. However, Freddie went missing briefly, causing worry.

The Bronx Park is a different place in winter compared to summer, but the children still had a great time there. They visited the elephant house and watched the big animals, including a hippopotamus with a huge mouth. The keeper fed the hippo and the children were amazed. The Bobbsey twins spent four exciting days in New York, with one adventure where Freddie sneaked off to ride an elevator. The family then took a train to Washington, and on the way, they made friends with a lady's white dog. They arrived in Washington at night and saw the Capitol lit up beautifully. Bert found a sugar bowl that belonged to someone named Miss Pompret and hoped to claim a reward if he found the matching milk pitcher.|"['1.

Billy noted the end of the President's carriage parade, and the crowd dispersed. The gates closed, and the Bobbsey twins, along with their friends, pondered their next move. Nell suggested sticking together and exploring the market. They ventured to the market, a delightful place in Washington, filled with enticing goods that made them hungry. After admiring the flowers and unique items sold by elderly vendors, they headed back to the Martin house. The twins learned of a reward for a missing sugar bowl. The Bobbseys spent the day with the Martins and planned more city exploration. The following day, they visited the White House's East Room with their father, exploring the grand building.
