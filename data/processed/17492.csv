The six little Bunkers were having a fun time playing in Aunt Jo's yard. Vi, the third oldest, wanted to know why soap bubbles have different colors. She gathered her siblings, Margy and Mun Bun, to blow bubbles together. Meanwhile, Vi's twin, with curly hair and gray eyes, joined in, leaving his toy-making project behind. As they played, Violet thought the bubbles looked like candy. When Mrs. Bunker checked on the children, she found them all except Margy. Laddie teased Vi about having candy, but it turned out to be his tongue. The kids speculated about a letter inviting them for more summer fun.

Aunt Jo and Mother Bunker joined the six little Bunkers at the front gate. They witnessed a policeman holding a cord tied around a bear's neck. An excited man with gold rings in his ears was talking to the policeman. A small crowd had gathered around the bear. Aunt Jo explained that performing bears were not allowed in that part of Boston. The Italian man, the bear's owner, was unaware of the rule. The bear would be taken to another part of the city where performing bears might be accepted. Meanwhile, the Bunkers were busy packing for their trip to Cousin Tom's at Seaview on the New Jersey coast. Cousin Tom and his new bride, Ruth Robinson, had invited the Bunkers to visit them.

The journey to Fall River was short for the six little Bunkers. They boarded a large boat for their trip from New York to Massachusetts.

At the restaurant, confusion arose when Mun Bun wandered off to another table, and a little boy from that table ended up at the Bunkers' table. Mun Bun was hungry and wanted to check out the shortcake at the other table. However, upon realizing he had strayed, he got worried. Mrs. Bunker found Mun Bun, reassuring him that he was safe.

"The kids were eating heartily after their night trip. Laddie had enjoyed waffles and felt satisfied. Sitting back, he shared a riddle: ""Mun Bun isn't Mun Bun when he's Tommie Wilson."" The family headed down West Street in New York City to catch a boat from the pier. Along the way, they passed outdoor stands selling various items. Margy, familiar with chasing kittens, knelt down to rescue one hiding under a fruit stand. Unfortunately, the kitten ran off, causing a commotion.

The man who owned the fruit stand had not noticed the kitten crawl under his pile of fruit. Margy, one of the Bunker children, went after the kitten, causing a commotion. Mistaking the group's interest for a desire to buy fruit, the man reached under the stand and pulled out Margy instead. Margy was holding the kitten she had chased. Mrs. Bunker hoped the kitten belonged to the man to avoid taking it away. The Italian fruit vendor offered Margy an orange to distract her, allowing him to safely hide the kitten. The Bunkers bought a bag of oranges for the boat trip. After a brief delay, they headed to the dock where they boarded the boat to Asbury Park, enjoying the sights along the Hudson River.|"['1.

The boat finally turned towards land, nearing Atlantic Highlands. As the steamer docked, the passengers, including the six little Bunkers, disembarked. A waiting train took them along the water's edge, with the high hills of Atlantic Highlands towering above. Amid the commotion, Margy almost boarded the moving train chasing a kitten. Despite the chaos, Margy's adventure was quickly forgotten as they drove to Cousin Tom's home near the beach. Cousin Tom, the son of Daddy Bunker's late brother, welcomed them warmly. The children's playful antics, like Laddie mistaking a searchlight for a thunderstorm, Margy's kitten rescue, and Mun Bun's mix-up, added excitement to their seaside adventure.|"['1.

The six little Bunkers arrived at Cousin Tom's bungalow near the beach to find plenty of bread and jam waiting for them. They were famished and ate heartily. Cousin Tom welcomed them to Seaview and encouraged them to make themselves at home. The bungalow was located near the ocean on a new street with an inlet called Clam River nearby. Cousin Ruth joked about becoming rich from the sand if it contained gold. The children were excited to dig in the sand with shovels and pails provided by Cousin Ruth. Vi and Laddie hurried to the beach to dig, while Russ whittled a boat to sail on Clam River. The Bunkers planned to stay and enjoy the safe beach, shallow waters, and family time with Cousin Tom and his wife, though they also had a visit to Grandpa Ford on the horizon.|"[""1.

The moon illuminated the beach, casting a bright light on the sand and ocean. Rose anxiously searched for her missing gold locket, a cherished gift from Grandma Bell. She had carefully worn it on a chain around her neck during the trip to Aunt Jo's. Now, as she and Russ scanned the area, her father approached with a pocket electric light to aid in the search.

Rose felt reassured and entered the bungalow with Russ and her father.

Rose pondered about her locket before sleeping but awoke with it on her mind. Rushing to the beach, they searched for the locket but couldn't find it. Despite this mishap, the children enjoyed their time at Seaview, wading, swimming, and boating. One day, while making a sandcastle, Rose got trapped in a sand hole.

The children were having fun at the beach, planning to build a sand house with sticks and seaweed as a roof. However, things took a scary turn when Rose got trapped in the hole they were digging. Luckily, their mother came to the rescue, cautioning them about the dangers of deep sand holes. She suggested they use driftwood to build a pirate bungalow instead. As the kids gathered wood for their new project, they discussed the salty ocean water, with Vi wondering why it tasted so salty. Russ, taking on the role of a pirate, decided to oversee the construction of the bungalow while the others, playing the part of prisoners, worked on building it.

Russ made plans that turned out well. Cousin Tom's young wife happily gave the kids crackers and cookies for a beach picnic. When Russ returned with the treats, he discovered Rose, Laddie, and Violet had gathered driftwood. The children built a pirate bungalow on the sand using boards, nails, and seaweed. They pretended to be pirates and prisoners, creating a cozy hideout under a seaweed roof. They enjoyed cookies and played all day, even bringing their dolls to the bungalow. The kids had a great time, and even Daddy Bunker and Cousin Tom admired their creation. The children had fun playing in their driftwood house, protected from the sun by the seaweed roof.|"[""1.

Cousin Tom led the six little Bunkers to the inlet at the beach. There, a large boat was tied to a pier near Cousin Tom's bungalow. Mother, Father, and Cousin Ruth were waiting with peach baskets, nets, and strings with meat chunks at the ends. Cousin Tom explained that they would catch crabs when the tide came in. The children noticed there were no hooks on the lines, just meat chunks. Cousin Tom explained that crabs grab the meat with their strong claws and tear it into small pieces to eat. They would lower the meat into the water, and when a crab grabbed it, they would scoop it up with a net. Laddie tried to make a riddle about a crab and a fish but ended up making one about a boat and water. They were ready to catch crabs as Cousin Tom guided them.|['1.

Cousin Tom explained how crabs shed their shells to grow bigger, making them soft-shelled for a while. The Bunkers learned to fish for hard-shelled crabs. Each child had a string with meat on one end to attract the crabs. They were told to pull up slowly when they felt a tug on the line to catch the crab before it swam away. Russ was the first to catch a crab with the help of Laddie's father using a net. The crab clutched the meat in its claws until it was dumped into a basket. The children and adults continued to catch crabs, with the older ones assisting the younger ones.|"['1.

Mun Bun and Margy each caught a crab with their mother's help, while Rose, Violet, and Laddie had good luck. Cousin Tom and Daddy Bunker caught the most. Mother Bunker assisted the kids in landing the crabs in the net. After an hour of fishing, the peach basket was full of big-clawed crabs. The basket was placed in the kitchen, and the children waited for the water to boil on the porch. Russ, later on, felt a sharp pain as a loose crab bit his toe. The crabs had escaped from the basket, crawling all over. Cousin Tom skillfully caught them with his hands, and Daddy Bunker learned the technique too. Cousin Ruth used crab tongs to handle them. The children found the crabs delicious, except Mun Bun and Margy.|['1. What did the children catch during their fishing trip?\nA) Fish\nB) Shrimp\nC) Crabs\nD) Lobsters\nE) Oysters', '2.

After dinner, Russ noticed the large claws of some crabs and imagined how they could dig deep holes in the sand. Suddenly, he saw his little siblings, Mun Bun and Margy, drifting away in a rowboat down the inlet towards the sea. Their mother, Mrs. Bunker, panicked and called for help as the boat drifted farther. Cousin Tom, a lobster fisherman, quickly understood the situation and sped down the river with Daddy Bunker to rescue the children. It turned out that the children had accidentally untied the boat themselves while playing. Russ, who had seen them from the beach, tried to warn them, but it was too late. Thankfully, with the help of the lobsterman, the children were safely brought back to shore.|"['Question 1: What did Russ notice after dinner that made him imagine digging holes in the sand?\nA) Seashells\nB) Large claws of crabs\nC) Seagulls flying overhead\nD) Fish swimming in the water\nE) Starfish on the shore', 'Question 2: Who were the children that drifted away in a rowboat?\nA) Russ and Margy\nB) Mun Bun and Mrs. Bunker\nC) Mun Bun and Russ\nD) Margy and Cousin Tom\nE) Margy and Mrs. Bunker', ""Question 3: What was Mrs. Bunker's reaction when she saw Mun Bun and Margy drifting away in the rowboat?\nA) She laughed\nB) She panicked\nC) She started singing\nD) She took a nap\nE) She started fishing"", 'Question 4: Who understood the situation quickly and helped rescue the children?\nA) Russ\nB) Mrs. Bunker\nC) Cousin Tom\nD) Daddy Bunker\nE) Lobsterman', 'Question 5: How did the children end up drifting away in the rowboat?\nA) They fell asleep\nB) They were pushed by a wave\nC) They accidentally untied the boat\nD) They were following a dolphin\nE) They were trying to catch a seagull', 'Question 6: How were the children safely brought back to shore?\nA) By a passing ship\nB) By a helicopter\nC) By a lifeguard\nD) By a lobsterman and Daddy Bunker\nE) By a submarine']"|['B) Large claws of crabs', 'C) Mun Bun and Russ', 'B) She panicked', 'C) Cousin Tom', 'C) They accidentally untied the boat', 'D) By a lobsterman and Daddy Bunker']
The children were playing in the boat tied to the wharf when it unexpectedly got loose. It was a mystery how it happened. Daddy Bunker explained to them that the moon causes tides by pulling water like a magnet. Margy and Mun Bun learned to be cautious around boats, even when tied securely. Margy's doll ended up in the water, and Russ tried to retrieve it, explaining that the boat capsized due to the weight of the stones he used as cargo. Russ planned to recover the doll with a crab net in Cousin Tom's boat. The children learned a valuable lesson about boat safety and the forces of nature.|"[""1.

Russ had a toy boat that he sailed into Clam River. Unfortunately, the boat capsized and sank. Russ thought tying stones to the boat caused it to sink. When the tide was low, they went to find the boat. After some searching, they located it and retrieved it. They untied the stones, and the boat floated again after drying in the sun. Russ also hoped to find Violet's lost doll on the beach. Despite searching, they found no treasure but remained hopeful. One day, Russ found a large wooden box washed up on the beach. Mrs. Bunker was curious about its contents and whether it held something valuable.|"[""1.

Russ saw something floating in the waves while playing on the sand. They threw stones at it, and it washed up on the beach. Russ ran into the water and grabbed it. Daddy Bunker doubted it was valuable, but they found a wooden box. As they were about to open it, a big wave carried the box back into the ocean. Despite warnings, the children, Margy and Mun Bun, waded into the water towards the box. The adults hesitated, but the children were curious about the box's contents. The box drifted away, leaving everyone wondering about the mysterious treasure it held.|"['1.

"""All right, I'll get you!"" exclaimed the young boy as he tightly held onto his sister's arm. She had accidentally stepped into a shallow sandy hole, with the water reaching halfway up her knees. Realizing it wasn't deep, she calmed down. During the fall, the tides were exceptionally high and low, changing twice each day. The ocean waters sometimes flooded the inlet, nearly overflowing the pier, and then receded hours later. Margy and Mun Bun were exploring a small sandy island in Clam River during low tide. They searched for clam shells to use as shovels but found none. Despite their efforts, they couldn't locate any clams on the island, even after digging for a long time."|"['1.

The island where Margy and Mun Bun were stranded was shrinking as the tide rose, soon disappearing from view. The youngest siblings, often needing their parents' help, were marooned in the middle of Clam River. Their faint cries for help were carried away by the wind towards an uninhabited shore. Luckily, Mr. Oscar Burnett, a kind lobster fisherman, spotted the children from his motorboat. Seeing their distress, he steered towards the diminishing island to rescue them. Marooned means being left stranded on an island without a means of escape, much like Margy and Mun Bun. Mr. Burnett, fond of children, was happy to help, just as he had rescued them before when they drifted down the inlet.|"['1.

Near the shore, Mun Bun and Margy found themselves surrounded by water, some parts deeper than others. The little boy and his sister wisely stayed on a high spot to avoid being submerged. They were rescued by Mr. Burnett, a lobster fisherman, who safely placed them in his boat away from the lobsters he had caught. As they approached the pier, Mr. and Mrs. Bunker, their parents, were relieved to see them. Mr. Bunker reminded them of the dangers of the rising tide and cautioned them to always seek permission before wading. The incident taught the Bunker children a valuable lesson about the sea's unpredictability. As summer days passed, they enjoyed playing on the beach, pretending to search for treasure and roasting marshmallows under the moonlight.|"['Question 1: What did Mun Bun and Margy wisely do near the shore?\nA) Play in the water\nB) Stay on a high spot\nC) Dive for lobsters\nD) Build a sandcastle\nE) Explore the pier', 'Question 2: Who rescued Mun Bun and Margy?\nA) Mr. Bunker\nB) Mrs. Bunker\nC) Mr. Burnett\nD) Mrs. Burnett\nE) A passing boat', ""Question 3: How did Mr. Burnett ensure Mun Bun and Margy's safety in his boat?\nA) He tied them up\nB) He gave them life jackets\nC) He placed them away from the lobsters\nD) He called for help\nE) He left them on the shore"", 'Question 4: Who were relieved to see Mun Bun and Margy as they approached the pier?\nA) Mr. and Mrs. Bunker\nB) Mr. Burnett\nC) Lobsters\nD) Other children\nE) Seagulls', 'Question 5: What lesson did the incident near the shore teach the Bunker children?\nA) How to swim\nB) The dangers of the rising tide\nC) How to catch lobsters\nD) The importance of sunscreen\nE) How to build a sandcastle', 'Question 6: How did the Bunker children enjoy their summer days?\nA) Fishing for lobsters\nB) Playing on the beach\nC) Attending school\nD) Cooking dinner\nE) Watching TV']"|['B) Stay on a high spot', 'C) Mr. Burnett', 'C) He placed them away from the lobsters', 'A) Mr. and Mrs. Bunker', 'B) The dangers of the rising tide', 'B) Playing on the beach']

"""He's bit by a Sallie Growler!

Laddie dropped his fishing-pole. Russ let go of his crab-line, and they both stood looking at the dog and at the strange boy. The dog was howling, and trying to paw off from his nose a queer and ugly-looking fish that had hold of it. It was the fish Laddie had caught and which the boy had called a ""Sallie Growler.""

Laddie and Russ played along the shore while their father and Cousin Tom started fishing, casting their lines far into the waves to catch a bass. They stood where the waves crashed, wearing rubber boots for protection. Russ's father explained that the fish Laddie saw, known as a skate, had long, thin fins resembling legs. The skate had a flat body, a pointed nose, sharp teeth, and legs-like fins underneath. Though skates can walk on the ocean floor, they also swim and sometimes get caught on fishermen's hooks. Cousin Tom mentioned that some people eat skates, but he prefers releasing them back into the water. After observing a skate washed back into the sea, they decided to head back to the bungalow for a meal.|"['1.

Two men and two little boys strolled along the sand, wondering how to have fun. Suddenly, Cousin Tom spotted something white and square rolling in the waves. He waded in, grabbed the box, and carried it to safety. Remembering finding it before, they opened it with driftwood. Inside were six Japanese dolls, a bit stained but salvageable. The dolls were wrapped in oiled silk, keeping them somewhat dry despite the sea's touch. Cousin Tom laughed at the discovery, pleased with their find. The group marveled at the dolls, planning to repair the damaged parts. The mystery of the box from the sea had finally been solved, bringing joy and excitement to the beachcombers.|['1.

Cousin Tom explained that the dolls found in a washed-up box were likely the best find due to their lightness and protection from the water. The dolls were well-preserved and could be shared with Rose, Mun Bun, and Margy. Daddy Bunker suggested saving the extra dolls in case any of the children lost theirs. The origin of the dolls was a mystery, possibly from a shipwreck or lost cargo. The children were excited to have the dolls, especially because of the unique story behind them. Despite some damage, most dolls were in good condition. Mother Bunker reflected on the beach's ability to both lose and find things. Later, George Carr alerted them about a fishing boat with fish to collect and a possible drowning incident, prompting everyone to go and investigate.|"['1.

"""No, the waves don't come up as high as the place where we left them,"" said Rose, who had made sure to place the dolls above the ""high-water mark,"" the highest point the tide reaches on the beach. As the children emerged from behind the sand hills, they spotted a group of men and boys on the beach. In the rough waves, a large white boat was overturned with men swimming around it.

""They're fishermen and they can swim. The water isn't deep where they are. They're trying to flip the boat so they can pull it ashore,"" explained George, who was familiar with the seaside. The fishermen retrieve fish from their nets set out in the sea. The fish are then stored in barrels with ice and sent to New York.

After much effort, the men managed to upright the boat and pull it to safety on the shore. Despite the stormy weather, the children were safe and warm inside the bungalow."|"['1.

Four children enjoyed playing with dolls and Japanese toys in the bungalow attic during a storm. They pretended to be shipwrecked sailors. When the storm ended, Russ and Laddie decided to build a fort on the beach near Cousin Tom's bungalow. They wanted to make a flag but only had a white handkerchief. With red and blue pencils from Cousin Tom, they created a makeshift red, white, and blue flag. Using toy shovels, they dug a hole and built a sand ridge around a hill, turning it into a fort. Russ hid inside, ready to defend against Laddie's paper bullets. The children had fun playing and using their imagination on the beach.|"['1.

"The sand walls of the fort shielded Russ from being hit during the battle. Laddie's pretend ""bullets"" and ""cannon balls"" landed on the fort's walls more than on Russ. Russ found it amusing and retaliated by throwing back at Laddie. However, most of Laddie's projectiles missed Russ due to the protective fort. George joined the fun, pretending to be another enemy attacking from behind. Russ didn't have a fort in the rear, so George had an advantage. After a playful battle, Russ, Laddie, and George decided to dig holes on the beach, hoping to find treasure like Sammie Brown's father once did on a desert island. Amidst the digging, Laddie discovered something shiny near the top of the hole, sparking excitement among the friends."|"[""1.
