The beautiful meadows and plains were mostly deserted, with only a few underground people passing by in a rush. Rarely did they dance outdoors; only a small group would sometimes twirl about. John hardly ever saw more than half a dozen of them together. The meadows only felt lively when the earth-children, who served as helpers, were allowed to stroll outside.

He attended daily, learning reading, writing, and more. The oldest underground men, known as the Wise, imparted knowledge of the world's origins. John excelled in painting, crafting, and riddle-making. His bond with Elizabeth, a girl from his village, blossomed into love.

"The next day, John faced the six little people, demanding a simple ""Yes or No?"" Their resolute response of ""No"" led John to gather 500 men, women, and children to work on a rock.

On the third day, Orm and Aslog found an island with smaller ones around it. They tried to approach it, but a strong wind and high waves pushed them back. Just as hope seemed lost, the storm suddenly stopped, and they safely reached the shore. Exploring the island, they found a mysterious house half-buried. Inside, everything seemed prepared for inhabitants, but no one was there. Hungry and tired, they ate the food and rested in the beds. The next morning, an old woman named Guru appeared, thanking them for keeping the house neat. She warned them not to bring a priest to christen their newborn son and revealed that she was a giant. Guru offered them good fortune if they obeyed her rules and assistance by calling her name three times. She asked them to leave the house on Yule evening for their festival.|['1.

Once the old woman disappeared, Aslog and Orm enjoyed a peaceful and happy life. Orm's fishing nets always brought in a bountiful catch, and his arrows never missed their mark. Everything they attempted flourished. On Christmas, they tidied their home, lit a fire, and retreated to the loft as twilight fell. As darkness enveloped the island, strange lights flickered outside. Orm peered through a hole in the roof and witnessed a mesmerizing sight: islands aglow with blue lights, carried by Dwarfs with peculiar features. The Dwarfs gathered around a stone, which transformed into a gigantic figure with Guru's touch. The Dwarfs danced and sang, filling the island with eerie sounds. Orm and Aslog, petrified, observed the revelry in silence. Eventually, the creatures entered their home, feasting and dancing. Aslog, drawn by the enchanting music, watched the dance unfold, unaware of the consequences. When she inadvertently invoked Christ's name, the creatures fled in terror, leaving the house deserted. Orm and Aslog, shaken, hid until daybreak, only descending when sunlight streamed through the roof.

Once upon a time, a magical shell-fish transformed into a friendly old woman to help a queen. The old woman guided the queen to a palace made of diamonds where six fairies greeted her with precious jewel flowers. They foretold the birth of the queen's daughter, Désirée, and promised to endow her with exceptional qualities. When Désirée was born, the fairies appeared in chariots drawn by pigeons and crows, bearing gifts like fine linen and a miraculous cradle. The fairies blessed the princess with beauty, good health, and talent. However, a large cray-fish warned the queen that if Désirée saw daylight before she turned fifteen, there would be consequences.

In his workshop, the goldsmith crafted a gold chain while listening to a beautiful bird singing on his roof. Enchanted by the bird's melody, he stepped outside, losing a slipper in the process. Standing in the street with one slipper and one sock, holding the gold chain and pincers, he marveled at the bird's red and green feathers, shining like gold. The goldsmith called his family and workers to admire the bird's beauty. As the bird finished singing, it flew away with the gold chain and shoes, heading to a mill. There, the bird helped the millers by wearing a millstone as a collar and then flew back to the tree, singing its melodious tune once more.
