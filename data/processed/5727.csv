In Pleasant Valley, Freddie Firefly was often overlooked during the day. But at night, especially in the warm summer evenings, he shone brightly and danced joyfully in the meadows, sometimes even in Farmer Green's dooryard with his firefly friends. Their greenish-white lights lit up the darkness, captivating the field people and farmhouse residents with their beauty. Benjamin Bat seemed envious and Solomon Owl hinted that Benjamin might have wanted to eat Freddie but was afraid of getting burned by his light. Despite the envy, Freddie enjoyed the company of his cheerful neighbor, Chirpy Cricket, who sang at night, bringing joy to Freddie. Chirpy Cricket sang for his own pleasure and maybe to impress a lady cricket, avoiding singing during the day to stay safe from birds.|"[""1.
