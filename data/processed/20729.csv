The tale of the war that shattered the mighty Mahratta confederacy is a gripping chapter in the series of battles that, initiated by Clive, culminated in firmly establishing our grand dominion in the Indian Peninsula. At the outset of the conflict, the Mahrattas held sway over a considerable expanse of India, stretching from Bombay to Delhi and extending from Rajputana to Allahabad. Their domain also encompassed the region of Cuttack in the south, effectively dividing Madras from Calcutta. The internal rivalries among the Mahratta leaders, Holkar and Scindia, along with their conflicts with the Peishwa at Poona, greatly aided the British forces. These divisions enabled the British to liberate a significant portion of India from the Mahrattas, a people characterized by treachery, cruelty, and a lack of valor in the face of British military might.|['1.

It is alarming that their progress is so slow. The entire operation has been a terrible mistake. To burden a force of four thousand soldiers with around thirty thousand camp followers and a train of nineteen thousand bullocks is the most absurd thing I have ever heard of. The mismanagement is evident. The conduct of the Mahrattas has been questionable, and the Governor General and Council in Calcutta strongly disapprove of the Council in Bombay. The actions in supporting Rugoba, who was involved in nefarious activities, were highly criticized. The situation worsened as a regency was formed under Gunga Bye, the widow of the murdered Peishwa, leading to conflicting loyalties. The decision to assist Rugoba was ill-conceived, and the subsequent capture of Salsette and Tannah further escalated tensions. The force's slow progress and excessive baggage make success highly unlikely in the face of the united Mahratta confederacy. The Major and his subordinate discuss the precarious situation, hoping for a positive outcome despite the unfavorable circumstances.|"['1.

Tomorrow, I will send Mary and the child to Bombay for safety. It is wise to protect them during these turbulent times. The next morning, chaos erupted as the camp was attacked. The major, his friend, and Mrs. Lindsay were tragically killed. The ayah, who cared for the child, hid him under the tent wall to save him. The Mahrattas looted the camp, but the ayah, recognizing one of them, was able to keep the child safe. She decided to disguise the child to protect him, staining his skin so he wouldn't be recognized as white. Despite the risks, she carried the child up the mountains to safety. The Mahratta leader, Sufder, helped her, giving her money and a dagger as a token of their kinship.|"['1.

Soyera embarked on her journey, explaining her background to villagers along the way. She mentioned her recent loss and her return home due to the impending conflict between the English and the Mahrattas. Despite the war talk, she diverted any suspicions by stating she was heading towards Jooneer and not Poona. She was later persuaded to stay at Anundee's house, despite initial reluctance from the household. The next day, she set off to find her brother Ramdass, eager to reunite with him. Upon reaching his farm, she was warmly greeted by her brother's two young sons. Soyera expressed her positive impressions of the English, noting their fairness and trustworthiness compared to the local rulers who often resorted to harsh punishments and power struggles. Ramdass raised concerns about the oppressive practices in the region, contrasting them with the more just governance in Bombay. Soyera highlighted the differences in justice systems and treatment of individuals between the English and the Mahrattas, emphasizing the benefits of the former's rule.|"['1.

Ramdass agreed that the princes in power would not hesitate to eliminate anyone obstructing their path. He found it strange that even the Brahmins, who value all life, support rulers who have taken many lives. Ramdass acknowledged that oppression and conflict among rulers were common not only in the Deccan but also in other regions like the Nizam's dominions, Mysore, Oude, and Delhi. He contrasted the English rule in Bombay, which seemed wise and reluctant to take lives, with the actions of local princes who engaged in warfare. Ramdass discussed the English strategy to support a friendly prince in Poonah to prevent potential threats from other powerful Mahratta rulers like Holkar and Scindia. He highlighted the English belief in the divisions among Mahratta rulers and their success in battles around Madras and Bengal. Ramdass's wife, Soyera, expressed skepticism about the English defeating the Mahrattas, given the latter's military strength and history of conquests. However, she also recognized the benefits that English rule might bring to the local population. The discussion concluded with uncertainty about the future and the potential impact of English rule on the people.|"[""1.

Delay and inactivity, a result of incompetence and divided leaders, had taken place. Colonel Egerton resigned due to illness and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Cockburn. By January 9th, they were near Poona with three weeks of provisions. Skirmishes occurred, but with no clear outcome. Mr. Carnac, close to Poona, suggested a retreat, opposed by Captain Hartley and Mr. Holmes. Cockburn believed they could reach Poona but not protect the baggage. Despite pleas, Carnac insisted on retreat. On January 11th, they destroyed guns and supplies and began retreating. Attacked by Mahrattas, they held their ground. Hartley's troops were reinforced and repelled attacks. The next day, they were surrounded, but Hartley's men defended well. Negotiations with the enemy led to demands for surrender and territory concessions. The loss was significant, with European officers among the casualties.|"[""1.

In the historical events of the Mahratta War, there was a significant disagreement between Cockburn and Captain Hartley regarding the feasibility of a retreat. Despite Hartley's proposed plan, the committee decided to send Mr. Holmes to finalize a treaty they never intended to honor. Scindia took a leading role in negotiations, overshadowing Nana Furnuwees. The situation changed when Colonel Goddard's forces from Bengal arrived, altering the power dynamics. General Goddard engaged in negotiations with Nana Furnuwees, eventually capturing Dubhoy and securing a treaty. Scindia switched sides once again, prompting a confrontation with Goddard's forces. Despite initial skirmishes, Goddard's strategic decisions led to successful engagements against the Mahrattas. The conflict continued until peace was achieved in 1782, followed by an alliance between the Mahrattas, the Nizam, and the British against Mysore in 1784. Meanwhile, Harry Lindsay, now known as Puntojee, lived incognito on Ramdass' farm, concealing his true identity effectively.|"['1.

The boy, Harry Lindsay, was raised by Soyera, who kept his English heritage a secret to protect him. She explained that revealing his true identity could endanger his life due to potential conflicts with the English. Despite the news, Harry struggled with the idea of leaving Soyera, who had been like a mother to him. Soyera emphasized the importance of Harry embracing his English roots and joining his own people who were honorable and held great knowledge. Although Harry was initially hesitant about this future, he understood the need to grow strong and brave like his father before reuniting with his countrymen.

Years ago, I earned Nana's favor by warning him about the Rajah of Nagpore's hostile plans. Nana promised to offer me a good position if I left Scindia's service for that of the Peishwa. The young prince, Mahdoo Rao, is just twenty-one, and I plan to introduce you to him as a promising future officer.

Scindia, the powerful Mahratta prince, had vast possessions and great influence over the emperor in Delhi. He commanded a formidable army and had French-trained infantry. Harry, a skilled officer, was introduced to the young prince, Mahdoo Rao, by Nana, the trusted minister.

One day, Mahdoo Rao, who had grown fond of him, strolled in the garden, sharing tales of his rural life and encounters with wild animals. The young prince expressed feeling restricted by Nana Furnuwees' protective watch, limiting his freedom to choose friends. Despite the minister's devotion and safeguarding of the state, the prince longed for genuine companionship. Nana feared the prince's involvement in state affairs, prompting the prince to avoid discussing such matters. When a friendship between the prince and Bajee Rao was discovered, Nana reprimanded the prince and tightened security.

An hour later, two regiments of cavalry set off, with infantry men riding behind the troopers. Late the following day, they reached Poona. Scindia and the Rajah of Berar were urgently summoned, and upon their arrival, a council convened to discuss choosing a successor. Everyone objected to Bajee Rao due to the animosity his mother held towards those who opposed his father. The proposal arose for Mahdoo Rao's widow to adopt a son to lead the government. After two months of negotiations, the matter was settled. Scindia's minister, Balloba, initially opposed the decision but was eventually won over by Bajee Rao. Secretly, an agreement was reached, catching Nana Furnuwees off guard. Purseram Bhow hurried to Poona, covering 120 miles in 48 hours. The situation was dire, as Scindia switched sides to support Bajee Rao, disrupting Nana's plans.

Strong barricades were also built with two hundred men stationed at each point for defense. The newly recruited infantry was stationed at the Raygurh fort, reinforcing its defenses. Balloba suggested pursuing Nana immediately and offered some of Scindia's elite troops for the task. However, Purseram, following advice from Nana's allies, raised an objection. Despite this, he decided to sever ties with the minister, believing his timidity rendered him powerless. Nana entrusted Harry with a daring mission to unite against Balloba.

It would be wise for you to come with me to Bombay. Your recent services will be remembered by the Council.

Establishing your position now will ensure a secure future. Soyera is pleased to accompany you, and it's time for you to return home and meet your countrymen.

After hearing your tale, I believe it's wise for you to rejoin your own people. The situation is uncertain and tumultuous here. I was a fugitive not long ago, and I may face exile again soon.

The current political situation in India is quite complex. The Peishwa has engaged with Scindia and the Rajah of Berar but refused to ratify a treaty with the Nizam. This has led to the Nizam's general leaving Poona in anger. Meanwhile, the death of Holkar has caused a rift between his sons, Khassee and Mulhar, with Scindia supporting Khassee and Nana favoring Mulhar. The confederacy is falling apart with the Nizam estranged, the Rajah of Berar returning home, and Holkar's power under Scindia's influence. The Peishwa is seen as untrustworthy and manipulative. It is advised to seek Nana's counsel for a better understanding of the situation. In times of trouble, seeking refuge with Nana is recommended, as he is a trusted figure even amid political turmoil.|"[""1.

Nana expressed his concerns about the political situation, revealing his distrust towards Bajee Rao's secret dealings with Scindia. Nana, feeling powerless against his enemies, feared calling for English aid as it would lead to a united Mahratta opposition.

Nana's loyalty to the Peishwa and his people prevented him from seeking external assistance, even as his enemies closed in. Despite the imminent threat of capture, Nana remained resolute in his decision to maintain his principles and avoid involving the English in the ongoing power struggle.

After traveling ten miles, he paused in a grove for hours before continuing to Poona. Near the town, he paid the men as promised, instructing them to re-enter separately. He then secured a room outside the city. There, he devised a plan to meet Scindia. Abdool was tasked to fetch his Brahmin attire from the Residency. The next morning, Abdool carried a letter to Scindia's camp, requesting a private audience on urgent matters. Scindia, after some reflection, accepted the request, tearing the letter. He instructed Abdool to be prepared for potential danger during the meeting. Harry believed in his success, counting on Scindia's lack of combat experience and courage.

Mr. Lindsay's daring act of bearding Scindia in his own camp left everyone in awe. His intelligence in carrying out what seemed impossible was commendable. He was selected by the Governor to negotiate with the Mahrattas and Nizam, aiming to unite against Tippoo. Nana Furnuwees was brought to Scindia's camp, causing a stir. Negotiations ensued, leading to Scindia accepting a lower sum and allowing Nana to leave to gather the money. Nana succeeded, and Scindia fulfilled his promise.

Harry visited the Parsee merchant's shop after meeting with the Governor to order the staff uniforms. He then went to Soyera and was delighted to find Sufder there. Sufder's troop had been disbanded, and he had come to see his cousin. Harry offered financial help to Soyera and Sufder as he was leaving for Madras soon. He expressed gratitude to Ramdass for his kindness and protection. Harry acknowledged Sufder's friendship and gave him money for his future. Harry shared his concerns about the political situation with Sufder and expressed regret that they might not meet again. They discussed the military movements against Tippoo and the Mahrattas.

I arrived on the first ship after the Governor of Bombay received your letter. Due to contrary winds, our voyage took nearly two months. I briefly landed in Madras and heard of your return. I debated whether to seek your orders or join General Harris at Vellore. Opting to come directly, I re-embarked on the ship that had just anchored. The dinner was quiet, attended only by the Governor General's officers. The Governor welcomed me warmly, acknowledging my service in the Deccan. He praised my role in securing the release of Nana Furnuwees, a friend of ours. Despite Nana's loyalty, the Peishwa's duplicity poses a threat. Lord Mornington plans to engage with the Rajah of Berar, a potential ally against the Mahrattas and Tippoo. He entrusts me with this mission, providing detailed instructions and an escort for the journey.|"['1.

A few days will not matter much. There are no important towns on the way to Nagpore. You would have to stay in poor inns and not be given much respect. I want you to travel in a way suitable for my representative and impress the locals with your importance. You need to buy another good horse with fancy gear. You will cover all expenses, and you will earn a thousand rupees a month. The rajah will likely host you well. If not, camp outside the town. Do not settle for poor accommodation. Harry was lucky to buy a great horse and got his instructions the next day. He set off on a sloop with twenty troopers and arrived at the Ganjam mouth in four days. A barge met them to transport their horses, supplies, and gifts for the rajah. The commandant said everything was ready at the village. Harry found a well-furnished tent with a bed, chairs, a table, and even a bath. The troopers' food was prepared by a cook he hired. Another set of wagons was already on the way to the next stop, ensuring no delays. The journey to Nagpore was smooth, and they were welcomed warmly upon arrival.|"['1.

Harry arrived at one of the town's grand brick houses, prepared for his meeting with the rajah. Sweeping had freshened the place, carpets adorned the floors, and furniture filled the rooms. Clearly, the rajah had requisitioned the house and furnished it from the palace. The main rooms were on the upper level, with ample space for Harry's escort below. After confirming a private audience with the rajah at eight that evening, Harry, flanked by his troopers, rode to the palace. An honor guard saluted him at the entrance, attendants lined the hallways, and all bowed respectfully as he passed. In the audience chamber, the rajah and his officers awaited. The conversation focused on maintaining friendly relations between the English and the rajah. Following the meeting, the rajah agreed to a private discussion the next morning to consider joining forces with the English against Tippoo. Harry emphasized the English's strength and the potential benefits of an alliance, urging the rajah to carefully weigh his options before making a decision.|"[""1.

It was almost two weeks before Harry received another message from the rajah. The rajah had returned Harry's visit and sent gifts of sweets and food to his guests. One evening, he arrived with only two attendants, expressing his concerns about the English and their intentions in India. The rajah's ministers were divided on whether to ally with or fight against Tippoo, who had been ruthless towards Hindus in his territory. The rajah believed that an alliance with the English could be beneficial, but he needed material gains to convince his council. The rajah proposed a significant demand, which Harry found excessive. Despite this, the rajah was open to negotiations and concessions. Harry sent messengers to seek instructions and buy time, hoping for military successes against Tippoo to sway the rajah's terms. The rajah, unsure of his stance, awaited developments, while the English armies prepared for the siege of Tippoo's capital.|"[""1.

The message was sent before Berar's decision, knowing their army wouldn't reach Tippoo in time. Lord Mornington predicted Seringapatam's siege before the troopers returned to Calcutta. News of Tippoo's defeats spread, causing anxiety despite Seringapatam's perceived invincibility. The rajah hesitated, believing Tippoo's strength was overwhelming. The Bombay army, supported by the Nizam, prepared to face Tippoo's larger force. The Governor General deemed the rajah's demands excessive due to financial constraints. The rajah hesitated, torn between alliances. Harry observed the uncertain atmosphere, with armed groups gathering, signifying impending conflict. The city's divided population added to the tension, with Hindus and Mahommedans holding conflicting loyalties.|"[""1.

On the 10th of May, a horseman brought news to the town that Seringapatam had fallen to the British, and Tippoo was no more. The people were stunned, finding it hard to believe that the strong fortress had succumbed. The rajah summoned Harry, grateful for his neutrality during the conflict. Harry reassured the rajah of the English's peaceful intentions and warned of potential dangers from Tippoo's allies. Concerned for his safety, Harry prepared to depart, and the rajah promised protection. As Harry left, a hostile crowd gathered, leading to a tense standoff. Despite efforts to maintain order, the situation escalated, with shots fired and chaos ensuing. Harry's guards took defensive measures, bracing for a possible attack on the house.|"['1.

While this event unfolded, Harry's group of soldiers worked diligently to remove the paving stones from the yard and piled them against the gate. The lower windows were secured with bars, and with the only entrance through the front gate, they believed they could defend the house for a significant period. As soon as the guards were dispersed, part of the crowd began pelting the gate with stones, accompanied by a heavy barrage of gunfire aimed at every window. The intensity of the attack led Harry to keep his troopers out of sight behind the stone barricades near the gate, ready to return fire once the gate was breached. Harry wished he had immediately ordered his men to mount and cut through the mob upon his return from the rajah. He anticipated that even if some managed to escape, they would likely face pursuit. Realizing the dire situation, Harry understood that unless the rajah intervened, they would likely be overwhelmed. He was confident that the massacre of a British envoy and his escort would prompt the English troops to come to Nagpore eventually, regardless of the rajah's efforts to save them. The house was situated in a garden, with horses tethered at the rear. Harry directed half his men to breach the mud wall at the garden's end to create an escape route. Despite the calm at this side, Harry remained vigilant, ensuring a few men guarded the breach while the rest assisted at the gate. Although Harry doubted an attack from this direction, he prepared for any eventuality. As|"[""1.

A trooper quickly returned with news that all the horses were taken through just in time as the barricade was being climbed. Harry gave the go-ahead, and they ran off with the remaining defenders. The troop gathered in the lane, mounted their horses, and galloped away. The sound of musketry ceased, indicating the breach was taken. They circled back to approach the palace from a different angle, seeking refuge with the rajah to avoid cavalry pursuit. A fresh round of firing was heard as they neared the palace. The rajah expressed relief at their safety, explaining his delay in reaching them due to handling the town's unrest. He assured Harry of his support and protection, offering to escort them safely when night fell. The rajah then left to address his troops, ensuring all was calm before returning.|"['1.

When the sun set, the celebration began. The rajah led his cavalry, with Harry riding among them to keep his departure secret until morning. They rode swiftly, with the rajah returning after twenty miles, leaving Harry with an escort. The news of Harry's exploits had spread, and villagers honored him on their journey. Upon reaching the Governor General, Harry was commended for his actions and informed of future service needs. The aftermath of the war saw territories divided, agreements made, and civil unrest in the Deccan. Scindia and the Peishwa faced internal conflicts, while Jeswunt Holkar posed a threat. The region was in turmoil following the death of Nana Furnuwees, leading to power struggles and betrayals among key figures.|"[""1.

During a time of political turmoil, the Peishwa engaged in ruthless acts against his enemies, even ordering the trampling to death of Wittoojee Holkar. Amidst this chaos, Jeswunt faced defeat but rallied to defeat Scindia and the Peishwa with the help of English-officered battalions. With a decisive victory near Poona, Holkar forced the Peishwa to flee and seek refuge in Bassein, where he sought British assistance. Captain Lindsay received a delicate mission to investigate piracy concerns among the islands and negotiate with a Malay chief for a strategic settlement. The mission aimed to gather information on the region's potential for trade and to address piracy issues with Dutch authorities in Batavia.

Singapore, once a grand capital, was overtaken by the King of Java centuries ago. The Malay Peninsula, though rich, is divided by warring kingdoms. The island's strategic importance for trade is significant. Harry ponders the complex situation. He must navigate the delicate balance between the tumangong and the rajah. The possession of the island holds immense value for trade routes. Harry's mission is to understand the political landscape and report back. The island's potential as a trading hub is undeniable.

The tropical island, larger than the Isle of Wight, was covered in lush forests and undulating terrain. As the crew anchored, they were greeted by Malay natives in canoes offering fruits. The locals shared insights about the island's peaceful state and their disinterest in the mainland's affairs. A significant event occurred when minor chiefs visited the ship, expressing their lord's desire for friendship with India due to their disdain for the Dutch rule. The tumangong, a local ruler, later arrived, welcomed with a salute. Despite initial unease, he accepted the crew's offer of friendship but mentioned his current engagement in a war in India. He expressed interest in establishing a trading post in Singapore once the situation in India stabilized.|"['1.

A message was sent in your language, explaining that the leader appreciates your offer but, due to ongoing war, cannot commit to a treaty at the moment. The leader values the friendship and sent gifts to show it, including a gun, pistols, robes, English cloth, pottery, a clock, and more. The leader, after reading the letter, expressed satisfaction with the terms. The tumangong, pleased with the presents, praised the English for their honesty in treaty-making. The English introduced the Malays to champagne, impressing them with its taste. The tumangong hoped to receive more of it in the future. The English planned to establish a trading station on the island of Singapore, potentially impacting Dutch trade. The British ship later arrived in Batavia, where they faced a cold reception from the Dutch authorities due to territorial concerns. The Dutch were not enthusiastic about cooperating against Malay attacks, as it indirectly benefited their spice trade monopoly.|['1.

Harry agreed that the Governor likely didn't expect cooperation and only invited them to explain the warship's presence. He wasn't worried if this part of his task failed. At the set time, they boarded the captain's gig with Fairclough while the Dutch interpreter and troopers took another boat. They were greeted with honor and led to the Governor's residence. The Governor shared concerns about the Malays' attacks, citing the challenges of suppressing them due to the vast number of islands and naval force needed. He mentioned the risk of retaliation and the impracticality of large-scale operations. The Governor planned to consult his council and draft a response. Despite not revealing all reasons, the Governor's reluctance was understood. The Dutch officials were shocked by the news, reflecting their discontent with British power's growth.

The plan discussed involves a potential conflict with the French who might target Holland. The Dutch navy is no longer formidable. The goal is to secure a small town on the east coast for strategic reasons. The idea is to land there and assess the situation with the locals. A cautious approach is advised due to potential hostilities between Johore and neighboring factions. The main character suggests a minimal escort to avoid drawing attention. The mission aims to secure the island from the tumangong to prevent Johore's interference. The risk of annihilation by Malay forces is a concern, emphasizing the need for discretion.

Abdool and the chief discussed the upcoming expedition. The chief mentioned that they would start at daybreak due to the dark forest that covered most of the route. The chief also explained that traveling at night was deemed unsafe, as the forest was full of unknown creatures. Harry, along with Lieutenant Hardy and seamen, went ashore to meet the local chief. They were cautious, carrying hidden weapons due to the Malays' known treachery. The chief greeted Harry and led him to the messengers, two strong men in their prime. Through an interpreter, Harry instructed the messengers about their mission to deliver a letter to the rajah. The letter requested safe passage for an English officer. The messengers were to observe the rajah's reaction and report back to Harry. The rajah seemed open to the English lord's request but expressed concerns about the country's instability.|"['1.

The leader expressed that the ruler was feared but not liked, as he executed those suspected of supporting the old family. The chief explained that the loss of territory had not improved the ruler's temperament, causing many to revolt. The chief revealed that the ruler held his wife and child as prisoners in the palace, possibly to manipulate the situation if needed. Despite being prisoners, the family was treated well. Harry, undeterred, continued his mission, accompanied by Malays. As they journeyed through the forest, they were ambushed by spears and dark figures, causing chaos and forcing the Malays to flee.|"['1.

Harry realized that resisting the Malays would lead to their demise, so he urged his followers to stay calm. Despite this, the bearers dropped their loads and fled as Malays approached. Just as the situation seemed dire, a chief intervened and prevented an attack. The chief recognized Harry as the leader and waited for his followers to regroup. The group then proceeded into the forest, passing a recent campfire and arriving at a village where victory celebrations were underway. Separated from their guards, Harry and his companions found themselves in a hut with bamboo walls. With quick thinking, they created an escape route by cutting through the bamboos and fleeing into the forest as chaos erupted behind them.

"They sprinted through the forest, hearing distant shouts behind them, fearing their captors were in pursuit. The Malay led the way, his expertise in navigating the terrain proving invaluable. As darkness descended, they pressed on, guided by the Malay's keen vision. Suddenly, the shouts ceased, replaced by the menacing roars of wild beasts lurking nearby. Ready for danger, Harry and Abdool gripped their knives tightly.

Taking refuge in a tree, they strategized. The Malay reassured them that the village lay a few miles away, shielded by hills. Despite concerns about returning empty-handed, they planned to offer vital information to Johore. To outwit a stalking leopard, they devised a daring plan: each man would lure the predator to the tree's edge, where the others could strike.

The spotted cat let out a fierce growl and attempted to lash out with its front paw, but the blade pierced through, causing it to lose balance. Abdool swiftly struck under its shoulder, forcing the predator to plummet to the ground. The sound of its roars faded into the distance. Harry, experienced in hunting big cats, explained how leopards cannot leap from thin branches. As dawn approached, the group continued towards Johore, a town visible in the distance. Upon reaching the town, they warned of approaching enemies, prompting the locals to arm themselves. The rajah, surprised by the situation, decided to defend the town alongside Harry, fearing the consequences of losing it. They planned to fortify the town and prepare for a potential assault.|"[""1.

Once the new palisade is complete, those not needed for defense should build an earth bank against the wall. This will provide a strong line of defense for the palace. Harry suggested using wood and bamboo from huts outside the palisade for materials. The huts were taken down to prevent them from being set on fire by the enemy. The townspeople worked quickly to construct the fortifications. They dug a trench around the palisade and filled it with sharpened bamboo poles. The women and children brought provisions and belongings inside the palace walls for safety. The men were stationed behind the stockade, ready for any attack. Scouts were sent out to watch for approaching enemies. By daybreak, a large enemy force was spotted approaching from three sides.

Trusting Harry's judgment, the rajah ordered a horn to gather his men in the stronghold. The entrance was secured with bamboos and earth. The enemy, surprised to find defenses, hesitated. Arrows from the palisade struck down many attackers. The enemy tried to climb the bamboos but failed. The defenders fought fiercely. The enemy retreated, faced with heavy losses. Harry warned the rajah that the enemy might return, possibly with fire. They planned to repel fire with long bamboos.

During the battle, Harry did not directly fight but organized the defense. He split the circle into three parts, with himself, Abdool, and the rajah each leading a division. They motivated their men and focused on the most intense attacks. Harry suggested using long bamboos to push away flaming faggots the enemy was placing against the palisade. He proposed a surprise attack with the wind carrying flames over the enemy's town. The plan was to have 200 men sneak out, attack, and then re-enter through the ditch. They would confuse the enemy and hinder their ability to set fires. The men were excited about the plan and ready to execute it. The group left inside the wall would cover their retreat. The rajah's officer would lead a counterattack if needed, although Harry believed they could return safely before the enemy regrouped.|"[""1.

Just before ten o'clock, a group of two hundred men prepared to launch an attack. The leader of the group was the rajah, and Harry was in charge of the firing team. Harry chose this role as he knew he couldn't move as quietly as the Malays across the open space. Earlier in the day, hides were strategically placed to conceal the men gathered with torches at the palisades. Fires were lit in other areas to divert attention from the main group. The men moved silently, crawling forward without making a sound. A horn signaled the attack, and they rushed through the opening, setting fire to houses as they went.

The following day was uneventful until nightfall when a sharp watch was kept from the top of the rajah's house and the palisade. The enemy, who had been seen entering the forest in significant numbers, was expected to bring faggots close to the walls before lighting them. Despite the guards being alert at night, most slept during the day to stay vigilant. Harry and Abdool patrolled the wall platform while fires burned in the fields, but the town's absence of light was eerie. Harry expressed concern to the rajah about a potential attack, suggesting reducing the number of men at the palisade and bringing the rest inside. The rajah agreed and ordered 300 men to be moved inside immediately. Suddenly, a loud shout and the sound of a horn signaled an imminent attack, with flaming balls being thrown over the palisade.|"[""1.

The leader instructed a local man to blow his horn, and soon after, a group of men rushed in through the entrance. They swiftly secured the entrance by placing bamboo sticks and rattan between them, while others brought earth and stones to fortify the area. Meanwhile, defenders on the walls showered arrows on the approaching enemy. Battering rams were used to breach the entrance, and the defenders fought back with fireballs and arrows. Seeing the enemy's approach, the leader's aide brought four guns for defense. The defenders then prepared for a siege, moving flammable materials away and setting up guards to extinguish any flaming arrows. As the attackers failed to make progress, most of the defenders rested. Later, a woman approached the leader, revealing she was the widow of the former leader and sought help for her son to claim the throne. The leader promised to share her story in Calcutta and suggested seeking refuge in Singapore.|"['1.

""Thank you, my lord, this is more than I could have hoped for. I will teach my son that the English are friends,"" replied the visitor. The night passed quietly until the decisive attack began. The enemy advanced to the stockade with arrows flying. The defenders fought bravely, repelling the assailants. The enemy tried to set fire to the palace, but the plan failed.

Three soldiers fell to Harry's accurate shots. He avenged his troopers' murder by taking down the rajah and two chiefs with precise aim. The attackers, led by the fallen rajah, rushed fiercely, but Harry fought back alongside his comrades. Despite the assailants' initial ferocity, they eventually retreated. The rajah's death caused chaos among the enemy ranks, leading to their ultimate defeat. The rajah, grateful for Harry's strategic prowess, saw hope for peace as the attackers dispersed. The rajah's men celebrated their victory and prepared to rebuild, strengthened by the knowledge that their town was well defended.

The interpreter quickly translated the speech for Harry, who then relayed a message to the rajah. The rajah indicated that they must stay in town for a day or two as a precaution against potential enemies lurking near the forest. He assured everyone that the enemy would likely run out of provisions and urged them to stay within the town walls. That night, a feast was held at the rajah's house to celebrate. Rice and other food were distributed, and the rajah's men were praised for their bravery. The breaches in the town's defenses were repaired, and guards were stationed to ensure safety. The night concluded with music and speeches, with Harry being honored and praised. The next day, repairs began on the town as scouts confirmed the absence of enemies in the forest.

The next day, chiefs who had been hostile came to congratulate the rajah on his victory. Harry, who had stayed at the rajah's request, now had to leave. The rajah agreed to cede a trading port and the island, signing the agreement in Malay and English. Harry made copies for the palace. He declined gifts, citing Governor's policy and his frequent absence. On the third day, Harry and his companions headed back to the coast with an honor guard. The town welcomed them joyfully, having feared the worst. The news of the defeat of the invaders brought relief. The villagers prepared a decorated canoe to take Harry back to the brig. Fairclough was relieved to see Harry safe and eager to hear his adventures. Harry's tales of the siege and encounters with a leopard captured Fairclough's imagination.|"['1.

Without the interpreter, reaching Johore and convincing the rajah to build the stockade for defense would have been impossible. The interpreter's role was crucial in preventing a potential disaster. The crew was excited to sail to Calcutta the next morning after a monotonous voyage. The ship set sail with light breezes, heading northwest.

A week later, about seventy or eighty miles west of the Andaman group, the brig changed course to avoid a dangerous passage. The monsoon had ended, and the crew prepared for rough weather and rain. The wind dropped, signaling a coming storm. Sail after sail was taken in, leaving only a few standing. As darkness fell, lightning lit up the sky. The crew, dressed for rough weather, awaited the storm. The crew watched as a storm approached from the south, with occasional lightning flashes in the north. Harry noted the signs of an impending storm, feeling safer at sea than in the mountains. The crew had prepared for the worst, just as they had for their escape.

The captain instructed the crew to clear the stores to prevent the fire from spreading. Men struggled to remove barrels and ropes from the hold, battling smoke inhalation. Water was sprayed on the flames, but progress was slow due to steam hindering efforts. After a shift change, the fire was finally under control. Despite the storm raging outside, the crew worked tirelessly. The captain decided to set a sail to steer the ship out of danger. Night fell, intensifying the chaos on deck.

The ship's course was set parallel to the shore, facing a northwest wind that caused the water to rise dangerously. The crew secured themselves against the wind, preparing for potential danger if the mast were to fall. Hardy and a few men worked to release the guns overboard to lighten the ship. The captain, Hardy, and others discussed their precarious situation, aiming to reach Port Cornwallis or navigate through narrow straits to find calmer waters. As the vessel struggled against the wind, the crew prepared for a possible landing, cutting away wreckage and planning escape routes. Despite the perilous conditions, hope emerged when a potential inlet was spotted ahead, offering a slim chance of survival.

The repairs to the boat started immediately as the voyage had depleted their food and water supplies. Fresh food was scarce, with only a few buffaloes and some fruit acquired since leaving Calcutta. The crew worked on fixing the boat, making a new mast, and checking the rigging. Harry, keeping watch, spotted native Andaman Islanders – small, clay-covered people armed with bows and arrows. The captain worried about their hostility and the challenge of finding fresh water. Despite their primitive lifestyle, he felt sympathy for their situation. The crew decided to fish for a change of diet. Abdool and Harry, along with the Malay interpreter, caught a variety of fish, providing a welcome break from the salted meat they had been eating.|['1.

Fairclough decided to keep a few men working that afternoon to set up night fishing lines. The crew planned to preserve the fish they caught to reduce reliance on their food supplies. By evening, the new fore-top mast was successfully installed. With the major task completed, a boat crew, led by Mr. Eden, was to explore the coast the next morning for freshwater sources. They were instructed to head south where higher land indicated a better chance of finding streams. The crew, armed for safety, was to cover around twenty miles and return if they found no water source. The crew set out early the next day, and after a short sail, they discovered a stream flowing into the sea, bringing cheers from the sailors. Fairclough emphasized caution to avoid encounters with potentially hostile natives. The crew worked diligently to repair the ship, using canvas and pitch due to limited supplies, while the news of a nearby freshwater source lifted spirits and improved their working conditions.|"['1.

Two days later, the ship's repairs were complete. The next morning, the brig set sail from the inlet that had saved them. The crew continued fishing and preparing for the journey. The carpenter fixed the second cutter while the other boats were dismantled. The brig anchored near the shore, and the crew filled water barrels from a nearby stream. As they collected water, they were attacked by natives with arrows. The crew defended themselves with muskets, causing the natives to retreat. Despite some crew members being wounded, they managed to fill their barrels and return safely to the ship. The captain anticipated further trouble but remained hopeful they could reach their destination safely.|"[""1.

A battery of artillery was set up close to the governor's stronghold. The guns were powerful and forced the governor to surrender, allowing him and his men to leave with their belongings. General Wellesley led his troops across the Godavery river while Colonel Stephenson headed towards Aurungabad. Scindia and the Rajah of Berar were nearby but veered off towards Hyderabad. Wellesley pursued them closely, and they took a position near Julnapoor. On September 2nd, Julnapoor fell to Colonel Stephenson, who later launched a night assault on Scindia's camp, causing significant casualties. The Mahratta army camped north of Julnapoor, and the British forces split into two groups to confront them. General Wellesley decided to attack immediately, facing a well-equipped Mahratta force. Despite facing heavy artillery fire, the British infantry advanced towards Assaye village, engaging in fierce combat. The British cavalry played a crucial role in driving back the Mahratta troops. Despite some setbacks, the British forces managed to recapture the Mahratta guns and secure victory, with Colonel Maxwell falling in battle.|"[""1.

The fierce battle raged for three long hours. The British forces suffered heavy losses, with 1,566 soldiers killed or wounded, more than a third of their troops. The enemy left 1,200 dead on the battlefield, and their wounded littered the country as they retreated. The victors claimed the enemy camp, along with bullocks, military supplies, and ninety-eight cannons. Scindia, alarmed by the defeat, sent an ambassador to negotiate a truce with the British general. Captain Lindsay received a crucial mission to inform General Lake of the victory and Scindia's weakened state. Disguised as a native leader, Lindsay set out with four troopers, traveling swiftly through friendly and hostile territories.

Upon arrival, Harry discovered that General Lake had departed six weeks earlier and set up camp at Secundara. On the 26th of August, orders were received from the Governor General to commence active operations against Scindia and his allies. Two days later, the army halted at the Mahratta frontier, near Coel, where Perron was stationed. Perron, a French officer in Scindia's service, commanded a vast army of forty-three thousand soldiers and four hundred and sixty-four cannons. Roughly half of his forces were with Scindia in the Deccan, while the contingent at Coel numbered around twenty thousand. Perron, ambitious and active, had been granted substantial authority by Scindia, ruling over a large territory. Perron's disciplined army posed a significant threat, nearly matching Scindia's entire force. The British troops moved to attack Perron's army early on the 29th. However, Perron withdrew his forces, leaving a strong garrison at the nearly impregnable fortress of Alighur. On September 4th, a British storming party led by Colonel Monson attempted to breach the fortress. Despite facing heavy artillery and musket fire, the British managed to breach the gates after a fierce battle.|"[""1.

The entire group rushed into the fortress, reached the ramparts, and began firing at the enemy, who tried in vain to push back the force near the gate. Pedron, realizing further resistance was futile, surrendered. The victors lost 223 in killed and wounded, whereas the garrison lost over 2000 in killed alone. A vast amount of military supplies was discovered, as the French had made it their primary storage site. On September 7th, the army set out for Delhi. General Lake received a letter from Monsieur Perron, seeking passage to Lucknow after resigning from Scindia's service. The swift capture of the supposedly impregnable fortress and loss of military goods indicated the British's unstoppable advance. General Lake's army camped near Delhi on the 11th but faced a large enemy force led by Monsieur Bourquieu.

Inside the fort, there was chaos. The English officers commanding Scindia's troops were imprisoned at the start of the war, leading to no response to the surrender call. Scindia's infantry fought bravely but lost, surrendering twenty-six brass guns. Later, two thousand five hundred soldiers sought refuge in the fort, then switched sides to join the British. The British laid siege to the fort, and a battery opened fire, nearly breaching the walls. The garrison eventually released the British officers and surrendered, allowing six thousand to leave unarmed. Harry, who had traveled in disguise, joined the British army and delivered a dispatch from General Wellesley. General Lake welcomed Harry and utilized his language skills on his staff. The army celebrated the victory with cannon salutes. The news of General Wellesley's triumph over Holkar and the Rajah of Berar further boosted morale. General Lake later confronted Scindia's forces, leading to a decisive battle where the French officer in command surrendered.|"[""1.

During the battle of Laswaree, General Lake's forces strategically outmaneuvered the Mahrattas. The infantry, cavalry, and artillery were deployed effectively. Despite initial losses, the British troops, including the 29th Dragoons, decisively defeated the Mahratta forces. The victory was costly but crucial, consolidating British control over the region. Subsequent engagements in Bundelcund and Gwalior further expanded British influence, culminating in the surrender of Shamsheer and Scindia. The British army's successes prompted other local rulers to seek alliances. Negotiations with Ambajee Inglia and the Rajah of Berar resulted in territorial concessions, strengthening British dominion in the region.

In 1804, peace did not last long. Holkar, expelled from Poona, made peace with Scindia. Initially, he watched as Scindia and the Rajah of Berar faced misfortunes, but when they were in danger, he prepared to help. Holkar delayed too much and kept his army near the Rajah of Jaipore, a British ally. General Lake offered Holkar peace if he withdrew, but Holkar demanded impossible terms. He threatened to overrun the country unless his demands were met. In response, Colonel Murray was sent to aid the Rajah, while Lord Lake moved westward. Holkar's forces were weakened, and Monson decided not to battle Holkar with a small force. Holkar attacked, but Monson's troops repelled the assaults. Monson's force retreated, facing challenges due to rain and mud, eventually abandoning their guns.|"['1.

Two days later, the force reached a river that was too swollen to cross. The artillerymen went over on elephants, but it took ten days to get the rest of the troops across, some on elephants and some on rafts. Many faced terrible hardships, and some drowned while crossing. The families of the Sepoys were left behind and were attacked by the enemy. By the 29th, the corps arrived at Rampoora, where reinforcements and supplies awaited. Despite this, Colonel Monson decided to retreat. They reached the Banass on August 22, where some troops crossed using boats. Holkar's cavalry appeared the next morning, and the troops faced heavy fighting. Harry bravely led a charge but had to retreat. The retreat continued, facing desertions and attacks from Holkar's forces. Lord Lake was called to action due to the critical situation.|"['1.

Harry decided to disguise himself to avoid Holkar's plundering cavalry. He left his uniform behind, stained himself with dye, and rode towards Secundara. Despite the urgency, he stopped at Coringunga for the night, traveling about fifty miles. While preparing a meal, the sound of horsemen entering the village was heard. Harry and his companion discussed the challenges faced in battle, blaming the formation of infantry regiments for their recent setbacks. They lamented the lost opportunity to dominate India with their cavalry. They acknowledged that internal conflicts weakened their forces, allowing the English to gain territory. To regain control, they planned to drive the English back and reclaim lost territories like Benares, Agra, and Delhi, emphasizing the need to unite against external threats.|"[""1.

"Harry set out with Abdool before sunrise the next day and, after a full day's ride, arrived in Delhi late in the evening. After stabling the horses, he made his way to the residence of Colonel Ochterlony, the Resident. He was promptly ushered in, finding Colonel Burns, the garrison commander, already present. Both men were unsurprised that the messenger was a native, understanding the challenges a British officer would face traveling from Agra.

""I am pleased to see you, sir,"" Ochterlony greeted warmly. ""Your name is well recognized among us for successfully executing numerous perilous missions. Disguised as you are, no one would suspect your true identity.""

""It's regrettable, Captain Lindsay. Recent victories may have led the natives to believe we are invincible. This setback will embolden them and sway some to their cause.""

""I don't fault Colonel Monson. With limited forces, he couldn't withstand Holkar's vast army single-handedly. Even with reinforcements, holding the passes seemed improbable, especially with enemy cavalry threats from other directions.""

""As a representative of General Lake, Colonel Monson sought my counsel. We concurred that retreating was the best course. Had Kotah not turned against us, we might have found refuge there. Treachery from the rajah and Kooshalpur's commandant led to our downfall.""

Colonel Ochterlony had a plan to defend the city from Holkar's possible siege. He instructed his men not to mention the threat of Holkar's arrival, as it might deter them from coming forward. Instead, he wanted to address the people as a group and explain the situation himself. By observing their reactions, he hoped to gauge their awareness of the impending danger. Those who excused themselves were likely considering the risk Holkar posed. Ochterlony intended to get the Emperor's approval to mobilize men for fortification work under his and Colonel Burns' supervision. Those who refused to help would be considered enemies and face severe consequences. Despite some reluctance, most residents understood the dire consequences of Holkar's invasion and cooperated. The city's defenses were reinforced, and the Sepoys, despite their small numbers, were resolute in their duty, knowing the horrors Holkar's troops unleashed. When Holkar's forces finally attacked, the residents and Sepoys worked tirelessly to fortify the city and repel the assault, displaying great courage and determination in the face of adversity.|"[""1.

The soldiers, known as Sepoys, were stationed in an open area within the city. They quickly moved to the threatened location as soon as they noticed a large group of men approaching in the faint light of early morning. Fifty cannons started firing at the gate to provide cover for the advancing men. The defenders at the gate responded with their own cannons, targeting the infantry. Despite heavy musket fire, the infantry, armed with ladders, tried to climb the wall. The Sepoys on the wall kept up a constant musket fire and repelled the attackers with bayonets. Holkar's men, expecting a surprise attack, soon retreated in disappointment, leaving their ladders behind. The garrison stayed on alert, anticipating another attack. However, Holkar's army was spotted marching away on the 15th, and Lord Lake arrived on the 18th. Harry, who had ridden to Sekerah the day before Holkar's army approached, urged the local rajah to send troops to aid in the city's defense. The rajah, believing Holkar would easily conquer the city, sided with him, showing his true intentions once Harry arrived at his palace. Despite the tense situation, Harry remained calm and diplomatic, attempting to reason with the rajah. Unfortunately, the encounter took a dangerous turn, leading to a confrontation in the courtyard.|"['1.

Harry was quickly tied up and placed on a horse with ten locals escorting him out of town. After a three-hour ride, they reached a hill fort on a high rock. They dismounted halfway up the hill, passing through a gate and reaching the fort where the officer in charge took him to a room at the top of the tower. Harry's arms were untied, and the governor and soldiers left, locking the door behind them. Harry pondered his situation, hoping that if Holkar didn't capture Delhi, there might be a chance for him. He realized the rajah was likely observing the situation. Looking out from the tower, Harry saw the fort's defenses and the courtyard below. He explored the tower, finding a door leading to a flat roof. After examining the fort, he returned to the room where armed locals brought him straw, rice, and water without speaking. Harry thought about escape but realized it would be challenging without tools or resources.|"[""1.

The door appears to be the sole exit, even though Harry can't see how it's possible to escape through it. Made of sturdy wood, it seems impenetrable. Despite pushing with all his might, it doesn't budge. Seated on straw, he ponders every scenario for freedom but finds no solution. Harry's only glimmer of hope lies in a potential reduction of guards during meal deliveries. If he surprises them, he might overpower three but not five. He speculates about Abdool's safety and plans to return. With Holkar near, a rescue seems unlikely. As Harry resigns to his fate, distant cannon fire signals Holkar's siege on Delhi, offering a glimmer of hope. On the wall, he spots Abdool, disguised among the rajah's followers, providing a ray of hope for Harry's escape.|"['1.

The entire group made their way down to the courtyard together. Some of them conversed with their comrades below the wall, but Harry was unsure if Abdool had joined them or remained in the fort. After a brief gaze towards Delhi, Harry descended to his room. It was apparent that Abdool had enlisted in the rajah's service and was likely recruited by the fort's governor to strengthen their forces in case of an attack by Holkar. Harry's meals were delivered twice daily, and he grew restless knowing Abdool was present and awaited communication.

Harry stood up as he heard the men approaching, ready to act. Abdool swiftly struck down one man and disarmed another, while Harry took care of the rest. Abdool then explained their plan to Harry.

The British troops advanced the following morning in two lines. The 76th Regiment swiftly attacked the fortified village, forcing out its defenders. Despite heavy fire from the enemy's batteries, the 76th charged fearlessly and engaged the enemy. The 1st Bengal European regiment and Sepoys joined the fight, with Holkar's infantry retreating to the safety of their guns. General Fraser led the assault on the next line of guns but was fatally wounded. Colonel Monson took command, reorganized the troops, and continued the advance, capturing battery after battery. The Mahratta horse threatened from the rear, but Captain Norford and a small group from the 76th Regiment bravely reclaimed the guns, forcing the Mahrattas to flee. The British withdrew after securing the captured guns, avoiding the fortress of Deeg's formidable defenses. General Lake needed to be informed of the victory promptly due to Holkar's atrocities inciting public outrage. Harry, accompanied by his havildar and troopers, embarked on the mission to deliver the news to General Lake. They set out from Shamsheer to Mahomedabad, avoiding Sekerah and anticipating Holkar's movements towards Sherdanah. The reports of enemy advancement towards Furukabad prompted Harry to cross the Jumna at Muttra and head towards Alighur, steering clear of Holkar's forces beyond the Ganges.|"[""1.

The fort, thought to be invincible, was captured, earning respect for the British. Harry arrived to a warm welcome in town, provided with a house and supplies. He then rode to Lord Lake's camp, reporting the defeat of the enemy at Deeg. General Fraser was fatally wounded in the battle. The news of victory spread, boosting morale. Lord Lake prepared to intercept Holkar, who was advancing towards Deeg. The British cavalry marched tirelessly, surprising Holkar's camp and inflicting heavy casualties. Holkar fled, leaving his troops scattered. The British cavalry's remarkable feat of a 70-mile march resulted in minimal casualties, contrasting with Holkar's significant losses.|"[""1.

On that day, three royal salutes were fired to celebrate victories at Furukabad, Deeg, and the capture of Shaddone, Holkar's last fortress in the south. After Holkar's cavalry regrouped, they rode to Deeg to join the infantry and artillery. General Lake allowed the troops to rest before moving towards Deeg. The infantry brigade left behind joined them at Agra to escort heavy guns needed for the siege. General Lake reached the force near Deeg on December 1st. The siege preparations began on the 13th after the arrival of the battering train from Agra. The Rajah of Bhurtpoor ruled over a small territory inhabited by Jats, hardy and brave people. The unexpected defection of the rajah despite his strong army was ungrateful and treacherous. The British army had to proceed cautiously to Deeg due to Holkar's constant threat. The size of the convoy accompanying Lord Lake's army was massive, estimated at sixty thousand followers. Holkar and the garrison of Deeg retreated to Bhurtpoor during the night, and the British captured Deeg unopposed. General Lake then advanced towards Bhurtpoor, where Holkar and his allies formed a powerful force. Harry, now a major, was sent to Agra to oversee a convoy. Despite the absence of Ameer Khan at that time, Harry's return journey faced challenges due to the formidable defenses of Bhurtp|"[""1.

Two soldiers were sent in opposite directions, one to the right and the other to the left. After a while, one of them got stuck in a swamp and called out for help. Abdool and four others went to assist him and managed to free his horse. However, the other soldier was nowhere to be found. Despite calling out repeatedly, there was no response. They waited but eventually concluded that the missing soldier might have lost his way back or even perished in the swamp. As they struggled to navigate the treacherous terrain, they saw the sky brighten, giving them hope. Abdool led the way through the swamp, but progress was slow and challenging. Suddenly, they heard loud shouts and saw enemy horsemen approaching. A skirmish ensued, resulting in casualties among the troopers.

"I rode to Agra the day before but started back too late to reach camp before dark. Lost in the heart of a swamp, we waited till morning. ""He won't succeed,"" said the rajah, ""We gave up Deeg to avoid a siege."" The rajah offered a guest chamber, urging us not to leave for safety. An attendant led us to a marble chamber with exquisite furnishings. The rajah's anxiety led to our good treatment. He hoped for better terms by treating us well.

"Thirty minutes later, an attendant arrived with two servants carrying a tray of various dishes. After the meal, Harry suggested they climb a tower in the palace for a view. ""It's safer than going to the courtyard without permission,"" Harry explained. The attendant, understanding their request, offered to guide them. They climbed staircases to the flat palace roof with three towers. From the highest tower, they saw the town's vastness, with a fort at the east and Agra's structures to the southwest. Harry expressed concerns about attacking the fortified town. Abdool shared his doubts about the success of the siege due to the Rajah's lack of experience. Abdool pointed out a distant cavalry that might pose a threat to their convoy.

The English prisoners were on the lookout gallery with some of the rajah's officers, observing the ongoing operations. The Rajah expressed his confidence in the defense of the walls, boasting about the number of soldiers and heavy guns they had. He doubted the English could breach their walls. As the storming party approached, the attack was divided into three groups. The British forces faced difficulties, one column capturing a battery, another unable to cross a water-filled cut, and the central column facing confusion and delay. A small group led by Lieutenant Manser attempted to breach the wall but found themselves unsupported and had to retreat due to heavy enemy fire. The English forces suffered significant casualties during the failed assault.|"['1.

A poorly executed assault by British troops on Bhurtpoor revealed a lack of proper strategy and organization. Lord Lake underestimated the stronghold, sending soldiers across open terrain to attack a well-defended breach without proper siege tactics. Despite initial failures, additional batteries were set up, and a sustained cannonade led to the creation of a new breach. To gather vital information, disguised soldiers rode out to scout the ditch's width. Portable bridges were then prepared for a daylight assault. However, the garrison had flooded the moat, thwarting the attack and resulting in heavy casualties. Despite setbacks, the British forces regrouped, establishing closer batteries and advancing their trenches. By February 20th, preparations were made for a more strategic assault to overcome the fortress.|"['1.

The Jats, overconfident from past victories, sneaked into the abandoned trench at night to destroy the mine and steal tools. As the storming party advanced, the Jats and reinforcements attacked, causing significant casualties. Despite setbacks, the British troops, including the 75th and 76th Regiments, bravely attempted to dislodge the enemy. After facing heavy losses and a flooded ditch, they regrouped and attacked a damaged bastion. Although some men briefly planted their flag, they were forced to retreat due to overwhelming numbers. General Lake persisted in the assault, leading to a disastrous battle resulting in extensive casualties. The British camp faced challenges due to depleted supplies and the absence of cavalry. Despite these hardships, the troops, including the 75th and 76th Regiments, showed remarkable courage in subsequent attacks, but were ultimately forced to retreat, suffering significant losses.|"[""1.

General Lake faced challenges in India, with defeats and the looming threat of a powerful enemy. Despite setbacks, he knew reinforcements were on the way. The enemy leader, Holkar, sought to capture British troopers but faced strong resistance. The British cavalry regrouped, surprising Holkar and inflicting heavy losses on his forces. Holkar's troops began to desert him as defeat seemed inevitable. General Lake, reinforced and determined, prepared to resume the siege on Bhurtpoor.

I now realize my mistake in acting without reason. I had no issue with the Company. They expanded my land and vowed to protect me from attacks.

Harry explained how they had lost their way in a swamp and were attacked in the morning. Unable to find a way out, he surrendered. He praised the rajah's hospitality, saying they were treated like guests, not prisoners. They lived in a nice room, had good food, and could freely roam the palace. The general acknowledged the exceptional treatment and asked about the rajah's intentions. Harry said the rajah didn't propose anything but left it to the general's decision. The general was eager to leave as Scindia was causing trouble. Negotiations were to begin, with terms including rescinding the grant of territory, a monetary payment, and a hostage.

My journey started and finished in a marsh. At four o'clock, the group departed Agra, and I rode swiftly until nightfall, finding myself still several miles from the camp. In the darkness, we lost our way and ended up in a deep swamp with no way out. Upon reaching the palace, all our troubles vanished. I was treated like an esteemed guest rather than a captive. I had a luxurious chamber, and the escort's leader stayed with me. I roamed the palace freely, often spending time in the tower gallery. The rajah was kind, checking on my needs daily. The officers were surprised by my good treatment, contrasting it with the harsh fate usually met by captives. After discussing the treaty terms, the rajah agreed, pleased by the lenient conditions.

Major Lindsay quickly agreed to the terms offered by the rajah, who felt relieved and grateful for the clemency shown. The rajah summoned his sons, who were usually on the walls overseeing repairs and troop morale. The draft of the treaty was read to them, and they too were relieved. The general, who was present, explained that the British government viewed the rajah as an ally, fearing that if defeated by Holkar, they would turn against the rajah next.

Major Lindsay was commended for his exceptional service, but a change in policy signaled a period of peace. However, maintaining peace in India was seen as challenging due to the complex nature of native princes. Major Lindsay requested to travel to Bombay, his childhood home, accompanied by Havildar Abdool. The General agreed and praised Abdool's loyalty, offering him a reward for his service. They embarked on a journey through Central India, visiting friends and settling affairs along the way. Upon reaching Bombay, Major Lindsay was warmly welcomed by his family, reminiscing about his upbringing and his father's legacy.|"[""1.

It seems that the nurse of a boy named Harry saved him when his camp was attacked. She took him to her brother's house where he grew up.

"I have never witnessed anyone to fall in love with. In India, upper-class women, be they Hindu or Muslim, always wear veils. English ladies, on the other hand, were mostly married.

Unfortunately, I can't provide much information about them. She was an only daughter when she married your father. Her parents passed away long ago, and they only had a lease for their home. There was a son who was a ne'er-do-well, seldom at home, and I've lost track of him.
