"Title: Arctic Adventure

In the vast Snow Land, a fierce snowstorm made roads treacherous, but snow-ploughs cleared the way. Losing our path, the horses showed remarkable intelligence. An upset in the snow proved challenging to right ourselves, even perspiring at 23 degrees below zero. Houses buried in snow added to the adventure. Seeking refuge at a farmhouse, we were warmly welcomed to a strange interior with peculiar beds. Snowed in, we exited through the chimney, clearing paths to resume our journey to Haparanda. Given good advice, we prepared for colder weather, donning Laplander attire with Lapp grass for foot protection. Crossing the Arctic Circle, we encountered windstorms and explored Finlander farms with unique fireplaces and cow-house interiors. Learning to use Skees, the North's peculiar snowshoes, was hard work but rewarding. Mastering reindeer harnessing led to thrilling downhill rides and encounters with wolves. Witnessing the onset of the Long Night and the Aurora Borealis's magnificence marked our Arctic Circle journey."|"['Question 1:\nWhat was the purpose of using snow-ploughs in the Snow Land?\nA) To create obstacles for travelers\nB) To clear the roads from snow\nC) To make the roads more treacherous\nD) To trap horses in the snow\nE) To cause an upset in the snow', 'Question 2:\nHow did the horses demonstrate remarkable intelligence during the journey?\nA) By refusing to move in the snow\nB) By finding the correct path when lost\nC) By causing an upset in the snow\nD) By perspiring in the cold weather\nE) By burying houses in the snow', ""Question 3:\nWhat was the travelers' experience when they sought refuge at a farmhouse?\nA) They were unwelcomed and had to leave\nB) They encountered wolves inside the farmhouse\nC) They found peculiar beds inside the farmhouse\nD) They were trapped and unable to exit\nE) They exited through the chimney"", 'Question 4:\nWhat did the travelers do to prepare for colder weather before continuing their journey to Haparanda?\nA) They wore summer clothing\nB) They donned Laplander attire\nC) They removed their shoes\nD) They decided to stay indoors\nE) They abandoned their journey', ""Question 5:\nWhat was the travelers' experience when they crossed the Arctic Circle?\nA) They encountered rainstorms\nB) They found tropical weather\nC) They explored Finlander farms\nD) They encountered sand dunes\nE) They learned to swim"", ""Question 6:\nWhat marked the travelers' Arctic Circle journey?\nA) Witnessing the onset of the Short Night\nB) Encountering sandstorms\nC) Witnessing the Aurora Borealis\nD) Mastering swimming\nE) Using bicycles for transportation""]"|['B) To clear the roads from snow', 'B) By finding the correct path when lost', 'C) They found peculiar beds inside the farmhouse', 'B) They donned Laplander attire', 'C) They explored Finlander farms', 'C) Witnessing the Aurora Borealis']
We encountered more wolves on our journey. My guide skillfully used his bludgeon to kill two of them. We then visited a Lapp family and experienced the extraordinary speed of reindeer. While traveling, we hit a boulder and reached Lake Givijärvi. Continuing eastward, we arrived at the Lapp hamlet of Kautokeino. There, we bathed in a big iron pot and witnessed the unique Arctic way of washing clothes. We learned about the dress and ornaments of the Lapps, as well as their appearance and height. Our journey took us to Givijärvi and Karasjok. Later, we left Nordkyn and faced challenges as the reindeer struggled on icy terrain. We encountered foxes, ermines, and even heard the eerie cries of foxes. Building snow houses and encountering a snow owl were part of our adventures. Finally, we prepared to cross the mountains to the Arctic Ocean, facing windstorms and a perilous descent. Despite exhaustion, we safely reached the shore of the Arctic Sea.|['1.

As I began my journey along the coast of Finmarken, I sailed past Hammerfest, known as the northernmost town globally, where schools and the Fruholmen lighthouse, the most northern one worldwide, stood. Among the Sea Lapps, both men and women were skilled sailors. In a Sea Lapp hamlet, I marveled at their unique houses and summer attire, along with their primitive wooden carts. The animals there fed on raw fish, and I even spent a night in a Sea Lapp's house before being urged to head southward. Comparing Finmarken to Alaska, I noted the similarities and the need for actions like colonization, importing reindeer, and protecting fisheries. As I prepared to leave the Arctic coast, dangers like melting snow and treacherous rivers loomed. Traveling through a birch forest, I encountered tired reindeer, witnessed the sun melting snow, and faced challenges like herds of fighting reindeer bulls. The journey continued with variable weather, encounters with bears, and crossing the Arctic Circle.|"['1.

"From that day, I was prepared for many challenges, ready to endure the jostling and jolting in sleighs. I didn't mind if my ears and nose grew cold. All I wanted was to keep moving swiftly until I reached ""The Land of the Long Night."" My journey began in great shape. I spent the summer in the rugged mountains of Norway, living off cream, butter, cheese, milk, and occasional bacon. Passing through various Swedish towns like Malmö, Skanör, and Falsterbö, I marveled at their charm and cleanliness. Driving along the Baltic coast, I navigated towns like Ystad, Cimbrishamn, and Carlskrona. Though the rough rides were tough on my trousers, my modest belongings made travel easier.

"As I drove, I saw pots of plants by windows, bending towards the sun. At day's end, resting at a post station was a delight.

Despite the heavy snowstorm, I continued my journey through towns like Söderhamn, Hudiksvall, Sundsvall, and Härnösand, where the streets were buried in snow. On the fifth day, progress was tough as the road had not been plowed for two days in the sparsely populated area. The road was filled with deep holes, making it challenging for the horses. As we headed further north, the snow got deeper, causing our sleigh to tip over frequently. The poor horses struggled in the soft snow, sinking up to their necks. To make up for slow progress, I traveled long hours daily, often tired. The plows drawn by six horses were a painful sight as the animals struggled in the deep snow. Driving in the cleared path was crucial to avoid mishaps. Despite challenges, we managed to overcome the difficulties and continue our journey.|"['1.

"As we journeyed through the vast snowy landscape, I expressed concern to the driver about the slow pace of our sleigh. The horse, struggling under the heavy load and extreme conditions, emitted steam like a smoke-stack. Worried about his well-being, I foresaw the possibility of having to abandon the sleigh if he couldn't endure the journey. Contemplating our options, I reassured Lars that if the horse faltered, we would build a snow shelter and feed him with the hay we had.

We might have to stop at the first farm we see and ask for shelter until the road is clear again."" A couple of hours later, I spotted a cluster of farms in the distance. It was a heartening sight despite the heavy snow burying some of the houses, with only their roofs peeking out. Smoke rose from chimneys, signaling warmth and activity within.

I was curious about where we would sleep as there were no beds in sight. I thought maybe we would sleep upstairs or on the floor. But there were no mattresses or blankets in sight. Suddenly, the daughters pulled out drawers from the bench-like sofas, which turned out to be our beds filled with hay and sheepskins on top. The beds looked strange, and the girls mentioned that sometimes five or six people squeezed into one. I was relieved not to be the fifth or sixth. The boys went to sleep upstairs, and I was given a bed with sheepskins that kept me warm. In the middle of the night, a strong wind blew, and we found ourselves snowed in the next morning.

I slept in the loft near my friends Nils and Erik. The next day, the women were busy spinning, carding wool, and weaving.

"After hearing my friends' advice about the challenging conditions in the snowy region I was about to travel to, I decided to follow their guidance and dress like a Laplander. They explained that the Laplander costume was essential for braving the intense cold and fierce winds of the roadless snow-covered land. The Laplander attire included long reindeer skin blouses called ""kaptor"" or ""pesh,"" skin trousers with fur from the reindeer legs, and pointed reindeer skin shoes with fur outside and sharp upward-turning points. These shoes were designed for crisp snow and were perfect for using skees. The trousers had no openings to keep out the cold air, and the shoes were bound with red flannel to prevent snow and wind from penetrating. The Laplander outfit was completed with bright colored bands wound around the legs above the ankles. This attire was not only warm but also practical for traveling in the harsh winter conditions."|"['Question 1:\nWhat is the purpose of dressing like a Laplander according to the passage?\nA) To showcase fashion sense\nB) To withstand cold and harsh conditions\nC) To blend in with the local culture\nD) To attract attention\nE) To make a fashion statement', 'Question 2:\nWhich material is NOT mentioned as part of the Laplander attire?\nA) Reindeer skin\nB) Fur from reindeer legs\nC) Wool\nD) Red flannel\nE) Bright colored bands', 'Question 3:\nWhat is the function of the pointed reindeer skin shoes in the Laplander outfit?\nA) To make a fashion statement\nB) To keep the feet cool\nC) To prevent snow and wind from penetrating\nD) To showcase traditional footwear\nE) To attract reindeer', 'Question 4:\nWhy were the trousers in the Laplander attire designed without openings?\nA) To allow for better movement\nB) To make them easier to put on\nC) To keep out the cold air\nD) To showcase intricate design\nE) To match the shoes', 'Question 5:\nWhat is the purpose of the bright colored bands wound around the legs above the ankles in the Laplander outfit?\nA) To attract reindeer\nB) To showcase fashion sense\nC) To keep the legs warm\nD) To indicate social status\nE) To prevent snow and wind from penetrating', ""Question 6:\nAccording to the passage, why did the author decide to dress like a Laplander?\nA) To make a fashion statement\nB) To honor the Laplander culture\nC) To follow friends' advice for harsh conditions\nD) To attract attention\nE) To showcase traditional clothing""]"|"['B) To withstand cold and harsh conditions', 'C) Wool', 'C) To prevent snow and wind from penetrating', 'C) To keep out the cold air', 'D) To indicate social status', ""C) To follow friends' advice for harsh conditions""]"
After acquiring my Lapp attire, I decided to try it on. My companion advised me on preparing my feet before donning the shoes to prevent coldness during travel. I wore hand-knitted stockings and had my feet surrounded by Lapp grass for warmth. The shoes, made of reindeer skin, were carefully put on, ensuring the trousers were inside. I was instructed to avoid dampness in shoes, stockings, or grass to maintain warmth. The shoe grass, collected by Laplanders and Finlanders, retains heat and absorbs moisture, vital for surviving the cold. To complete my outfit, I carried two large reindeer-skin bags for sleeping outdoors on the snow. One bag sufficed for mild cold, while the other was for extreme temperatures. The Arctic Circle, where the sun vanishes for a day in winter, marks the southernmost boundary of the polar region.|['1.

"At the North Pole, the sun vanishes on the 22nd of September and reappears on the 20th of March. This creates a year of one day and one night at the pole. The Arctic region, between the Arctic Circle and the pole, experiences longer nights the further north you go. The earth's axis is an imaginary line through its center, creating the North and South poles. The earth orbits the sun in a flattened circle called an ellipse. The earth is tilted at 23° 28', causing seasons. On the equinoxes, day and night are equal worldwide. The North Pole has six months of darkness from autumn to spring equinox.

At the farm, a girl was seen by a large iron pot, putting coarse grass into it to prepare food for the cattle. The farmer explained that the grass was tough and needed to be softened before feeding. Sheep were kept in a corner, while the horses had their stable. The supper consisted of dry mutton, smoked reindeer meat, bread, butter, cheese, buttermilk, and fish. The meal lacked formalities like tablecloths or forks, with flatbread and wooden spoons used instead. After supper, the girls prepared the beds, which were boxes filled with straw and hay. A severe windstorm hit during the night, followed by heavy snowfall. To travel further north, the visitor was gifted skis by Joseff, the farm owner, who taught how to use them. The skis were made of wood from fir trees, with a birch bark loop for the foot, and a polished, grooved underside for smooth gliding on snow.|['1.

I spent many hours each day on the lake, practicing skeeing. After three days, I could control the skees well without slipping. Joseff taught me to go down hills safely, emphasizing the need to zigzag to prevent slipping. He demonstrated how to lean forward for speed and stability. When I tried, I got scared, bent backward, and fell. Joseff then advised me to use a stick to control my speed by leaning on it. With this method, I successfully descended the hill. Joseff warned about the dangers of boulders on hills and the importance of mastering skeeing before attempting such terrains. As a windstorm hit, I struggled to stay on my feet.|"[""1.

In Haparanda, my friends were right about the Lapp costume being perfect for cold weather. Reindeer skin is the warmest material, ideal for sleigh rides, walking, or skiing in harsh conditions. I reached a hamlet of Finnish farms, where heavy snow made travel difficult. The locals invited me to their unique steam bath ritual. The bathhouse was isolated for safety, with a stone oven at its center. Wood kept the stones hot. After cleaning, water was poured over the stones, creating steam.

One day, during a visit to a village, I had a unique experience. The villagers there had a tradition of switching each other's backs with birch twigs, claiming it brought good circulation. At first, I hesitated, but soon found myself joining in. The sensation was intense, and my back turned as red as a lobster. Following their advice, we rolled in the snow, which felt surprisingly refreshing. The villagers wore long coats lined with sheepskin, and the women donned woolen skirts and heavy jackets. After this unusual bath, I encountered sleighs like none I had seen before, some pulled by reindeer. These sleighs resembled tiny boats, sturdy and practical for their daily lives. It was a fascinating glimpse into their unique culture and traditions.|"[""1.

The Lapp explained that the keel of the sleigh determines its speed and stability on packed snow. Different sleigh types, like the 'Kerres' for transporting goods and people and the 'Lakkek' with decks for valuables and provisions, were described. The 'Akja' was built for speed, with thick keels and sealskin-covered decks to protect belongings. The Lapps offered to teach the narrator to drive reindeer and use sleighs for travel as horses were impractical in the deep snow. The narrator acquired a sleek sleigh for the journey. Jon, who owned a large herd of reindeer, demonstrated how to lasso and select the animals.

Jon and the Lapps captured reindeer for harnessing. Jon carefully lassoed the reindeer, choosing a special one for his friend, Paulus. He explained that the reindeer had stout legs, large hoofs, and gray, coarse hair. They returned home and harnessed the reindeer with collars and leather traces. Unlike horses, reindeer don't use bits in their harnesses. Jon showed how to sit in the sleigh, a unique and uncomfortable position.

"Jon gave me the rein and looped it around my wrist, cautioning me with a mischievous grin: ""If you tip over, the reindeer won't leave you behind! It will stop after a bit once it knows you've fallen. You might tumble in the snow a few times before it halts. Remember, Paulus,"" he continued, ""keep the rein from touching the snow. If it gets caught under the sleigh, your arm could get stuck, leading to a dislocated shoulder or wrist. If you fall, let go of the rein. To stop the reindeer, throw the rein to the left. To speed up, keep it on the right. Keep the rein loose, almost skimming the snow.

I knew it! I hopped into my sleigh, and the reindeer dashed off at a wild speed, tossing me out once again. I stood up, snow-covered and a bit dazed. Luckily, I had wrapped the reins tightly around my wrist, so the reindeer couldn't escape without me. After a few seconds of being dragged, the reindeer stopped. Undeterred, I kept on driving despite the repeated falls. It happened so frequently that I lost count, nearly a hundred times that day. The next day, I took more lessons and learned to balance better. With practice, I improved and had fewer tumbles. By the third day, I could balance on level ground without falling. Jon then prepared me for driving down steep hills, a thrilling yet challenging task. He led the way as we descended the hill, the reindeer speeding down, making sharp turns at the bottom, causing me to be flung out head over heels.|"['1.

"While descending, my reindeer's hooves kicked up snow, stinging my face like tiny stones. It hurt a lot, so I had to wear my mask for protection. When the reindeer trotted fast, I heard a strange noise like wood sticks clashing. Curious, I asked my guide, who explained that it was the sound of the reindeer's hooves spreading apart to prevent sinking in the snow, then clashing back together when lifted. I improved at steering downhill, mastering sharp turns by shifting my weight. After bidding farewell to my guide, I journeyed through Rukojarvi, passing Korpilombolo and Sattajarvi to Pajala. A snowstorm followed by a clear sky revealed the sun setting on the horizon. The next day, the sun barely peeked above the horizon at noon, signaling my entry into ""The Land of the Long Night.""

"As I pondered these thoughts, I cried out, ""Long Night, the loss of life in the pursuit of the pole has been great, but man's cleverness offers hope that we may yet conquer this icy barrier."" The following day, the sun remained hidden, signaling my arrival in the Land of the Long Night. Here, stars shone perpetually, replacing the absent sun. Towering pines contrasted with the snowy landscape. The sun's absence made time indiscernible; stars replaced the sun as timekeepers for the Lapps. The aurora borealis illuminated the night sky, dancing in waves of blue, white, violet, green, and orange, blending and breaking into a fiery red spectacle. Each display was unique, much like the varied creations of our world.

Pinta and Wasara, two Lapps with blue eyes and fair hair, were skilled at skiing and driving reindeer. Pinta, around thirty, and Wasara, about twenty-five, were physically strong with broad shoulders and muscular limbs. They traveled swiftly on well-packed snow, sometimes reaching fifteen miles per hour. Despite the exuberant atmosphere, the weather turned gray, windy, and snowy, making it hard to find their way. Trusting their dogs to warn of wolves, they eventually stopped to rest. Pinta and Wasara slept soundly with heads down and arms crossed. After the weather cleared, they continued their journey and found their way.

"The man took out a small box and offered me some powdered tobacco. This gesture showed I was welcome. I then passed the box to his son, who offered some to Pinta. I gazed in amazement at the people in the tent. These Lapps had blue eyes and rosy faces from the wind. There were men, women, young girls, and boys. The women were weaving, sewing, and making shoes. Wasara's dad, Pehr, a handsome man in his seventies, was there too. The Lapp lifestyle suits them well. The tent was made of rough wool called ""vadmal,"" with poles and a sturdy frame. Inside were boxes, skins, and cradles for the Lapp babies. The baby girl smiled at me, and the chubby boy slept peacefully."|['1. What did the man offer to the speaker?\nA. Tea\nB.

Two women gathered snow and melted it in a large pot over a fire to make water, following the Lapps' method. One woman ground coffee and brewed it in a kettle, adding a pinch of salt for flavor. They clarified the coffee with a piece of dried fishskin and reindeer milk. The women sweetened the coffee with rock candy and enjoyed it with frozen reindeer milk. Meanwhile, a man prepared reindeer meat for a meal. The camp was filled with sleighs, meat hanging from trees, and various tools for reindeer. Skins of wolves and other animals were drying, creating a unique scene. The family had silver spoons that had been passed down for generations. The host explained the importance of coffee and tobacco to the Lapps. The narrator, after a long journey in freezing temperatures, eagerly awaited the meal.|['1.

When the meal was ready, we were summoned to the table. The host dished out the reindeer meat onto large platters, carefully portioning out servings based on our hunger levels. As the honored guest, I received the choicest, fattiest pieces. The meal was served on wooden plates, accompanied by small pieces of fir tree roots thrown into the fire for light. After the feast, I expressed my gratitude as per tradition. Meanwhile, Pehr Wasara had a man and a woman serving in his household, treated as family members. The girl earned three reindeer annually, while the man received six. Pehr mentioned that a tent could cost around thirty to forty dollars, a considerable sum for the Lapps. Despite his apparent frugality, Pehr had substantial savings. Additionally, a trained reindeer was priced at eight dollars. The durable vadmal fabric ensured that a tent could last up to twenty years with frequent patching, much like the tale of the knife and handle.|"['1.

In Lapland, when a child is born, they are gifted a reindeer, a tradition that continues even during baptisms. The reindeer and their offspring become the child's property. The Lapp people are cautious due to wolves and split their reindeer into herds. They dress warmly for the cold nights, using reindeer skins and bear blankets. They avoid keeping fires at night for safety. Inside the tent, the temperature drops to 39 degrees below zero. Despite the freezing temperatures, the Lapps have a hearty breakfast of reindeer blood pancakes, porridge, reindeer meat, cheese, and coffee. The morning routine involves washing with snow to avoid tender skin. The household then sets out on skis to relocate the reindeer herd to new grazing grounds with shallower snow, carrying babies in cradles on their backs, followed by loyal dogs.|['1.

About an hour after breakfast, the night watch came back with their dogs. The wife quickly served them coffee before their breakfast. The dogs enjoyed a mix of powdered blood, flour, and warm water, followed by bones they gnawed on eagerly. This meal is their daily routine, with occasional meat treats. After eating, the watch and their dogs rested. These Lapp dogs, resembling Pomeranians but larger, are vital to the community. They help manage reindeer, protect against wolves and bears, and stay loyal to their owners. The dogs are always by their side, even during dangerous situations. The Lapps care for their dogs by keeping them fit and alert. The dogs assist in herding reindeer and alerting the community of potential dangers.|['1.

Teaching reindeer to pull sleighs or carry packs is a challenging and lengthy process. Pehr noted that training begins when the reindeer is three years old, but it takes until they are five for them to be fully trained. Daily lessons are given to familiarize them with their masters and to get them used to being lassoed, which they initially fear. Salt and angelica are used to entice them to come when needed, avoiding the need for the lasso. The reindeer are treated with kindness throughout the training to ensure their cooperation. During the training, the reindeer are gradually introduced to pulling a sleigh, starting with salt as a reward and then being harnessed to the sleigh. The training involves patience and persistence from both the trainer and the reindeer, with breaks taken to avoid exhaustion. The speed of reindeer varies depending on the time of year and snow conditions, with the colder months allowing for faster travel speeds.|['1.

"After finishing our conversation, Pehr suggested, ""Let's grab our skis and head to one of my nearby herds."" We skied for about two miles until we reached a herd of around three thousand reindeer. Pehr proudly exclaimed, ""There are even more!"" He pointed out the impressive horns of the animals, explaining that the males' horns reach their full size at six or seven years, while the females' horns do so at about four years. The reindeer shed their horns from March to May, with the adult animals' horns reaching full size in September or October. Pehr shared that reindeer are low-maintenance animals, thriving in cold weather and snow. They find their own food and even eat snow when thirsty. Some reindeer are trained to eat stored food but must roam freely to stay healthy. Pehr mentioned that some Laplanders own thousands of reindeer, but challenges like deep snow in spring can impact the herd's health."|"[""1.

In the northern snowy lands, the reindeer is vital for survival. It serves as a horse and a beast of burden, providing food, clothing, and shelter. Each owner brands their reindeer for ownership proof. Moving the camp with the reindeer requires quick and coordinated efforts. The herd is managed with sleighs, dogs, and skiers. Women work alongside men, even carrying babies on their backs. Setting up the tent efficiently is crucial to protect against the fierce winds. Despite a raging storm, the sturdy tent withstands the pressure due to its design. The Lapps demonstrate resilience and resourcefulness in their nomadic lifestyle.|['1.

The reindeer gathered closely, with the bulls forming a protective outer ring for the females against the storm. Inside the tent, we huddled together, dogs included, finding comfort by a warm fire with a kettle of reindeer meat. Despite the dogs' interruptions, we laughed and enjoyed the warmth while the storm raged outside. The Lapps knew the tent could withstand the hurricane.

We had a wonderful time at Pehr Wasara's tent. A pot filled with reindeer meat was cooked, and Pehr shared news with his friend about his son visiting. We were given a special place to sleep under many skins. The next morning, after breakfast, we said goodbye to our host and his family. While on our way, I noticed something unusual ahead. I thought I saw many hares, but they were actually reindeer tails above the snow. The reindeer were digging in the snow to eat moss. Pehr Wasara's herd was a delightful sight with over two thousand tails moving above the snow. As we journeyed further, we encountered hundreds of reindeer digging for food. They were not afraid of us and worked diligently with their forelegs. I was fascinated by their hard work, while Pehr found my curiosity amusing. It was a unique experience to witness the reindeer working so diligently to find their food.|"['1.

Some female reindeer were diligently working while the young does observed. When they reached the moss, the mothers called the calves with a unique grunt to feed beside them. As we continued our journey, we found ourselves surrounded by deep holes made by thousands of reindeer. We followed fresh sleigh tracks to an encampment, escaping the maze of holes. Suddenly, Pehr Wasara outpaced me, disappearing down a steep hill. I braced myself, remembering Pehr's advice to lean in the opposite direction on curves. I successfully navigated the hills, even outperforming Pehr on a steep descent. We encountered a dense fir tree forest, where we walked to avoid collisions. After a pleasant drive, we returned to our tent, greeted warmly by the family.

I observed the Laplanders' unique way of life, studying their traditions closely. They skillfully utilized every part of the reindeer they hunted. The blood was stored in a bladder, intestines washed, and hides carefully prepared for shoes and gloves. I marveled at their resourcefulness. One day, as I longed for the sun's warmth, a golden thread appeared on the horizon, heralding its imminent arrival. I raced up a hill to catch a glimpse of the sun in its full glory. The sun's fiery red glow signaled the promise of spring and happiness. I understood then why ancient cultures worshipped the sun, for its light sustains life and brings joy.

After the sun reappeared, I reached a region where the Lapps I lived with were terrified of wolves. Three packs were spotted about 150 miles to the east, causing fear among the people. One day, while watching a meal being cooked in the tent, a Lapp expressed their dread of the wolves. They explained that wolves are cunning when hungry, with the Chief of the Pack chosen as the leader due to their superior cunning. The Lapps are always vigilant, as wolves can attack at any moment. The reindeer scatter in fear, making it hard to regroup them. Wolves are the greatest enemies, and the Lapps kill them whenever possible. The Lapps are always on guard, especially at night. One day, a woman warned of wolves approaching, leading everyone to arm themselves and head to the herd for increased vigilance.|['1.

Some of the people split up to search the area, armed with heavy clubs. They vowed to defend themselves against any wolves they encountered. Despite their efforts, no wolves were seen upon their return. The Lapps expressed concern about the wolves' cunning nature and urged vigilance. They shared a meal of reindeer meat, kept warm against their bodies to prevent freezing. The dogs, sensing their masters' fear, barked and scanned the surroundings for any signs of danger. As night fell, the group formed protective circles around their reindeer, shouting and yelling to deter potential threats. Despite the tense night, the moon provided visibility, and the wolves did not appear. Exhausted, they moved the reindeer closer to camp and rested, relying on the dogs to guard them. The next morning, they remained on alert, prepared to defend against any wolf attacks. Additional Lapp families arrived for safety in numbers, ready to fight off any potential threats.|"['1.

Wolves are fascinating creatures with a complex social structure. When the Chief of the Pack is lost, the wolves hold a council to choose a new leader. The Chief must be cunning and brave, leading the pack on hunts while avoiding ambushes. Wolves communicate silently through eye contact and obey their leader. However, if the pack becomes dissatisfied, they may turn on the Chief, passing judgment and sentencing him to death. When a Chief becomes old or unable to lead, the pack may also turn on him. In battles between rival packs, the defeated Chief is often killed by his own followers. Wolves are strategic hunters, sometimes deceiving their prey by pretending to leave before circling back for an attack. They are known for their intelligence and cunning ways, making them formidable predators in the wild.|"['1.

The wolves, having lost their leader, gathered to choose a new chief. As the pack approached, the humans prepared to defend themselves. Their goal was to kill the new chief, which they succeeded in doing. The wolves, now satiated after the feast, fled as another fell. The next day, a snowstorm hit, prompting the Laplanders to hunt the wolves on their skis. Spotting a pack in the distance, they readied their weapons. The wolves approached, hungry and fierce. The humans stood their ground, armed and ready for a potential attack.|"[""1.

The wolves were approaching closer, with about thirty of them in the pack. The Chief of the Pack stood out, being larger and darker than the others, leading the way cautiously. As they neared, the wolves seemed to sense something was amiss. A consultation was held, and the Lapp explained that the wind was blowing from the wolves towards them, masking their scent. The wolves had likely come from the Finland forest to the east. Suddenly, the Chief halted, and the pack followed suit. They split into two groups, possibly strategizing. The Lapp predicted that one pack would flank the reindeer from behind while the other waited for the chaos to ensue. The wolves were cunning in their tactics. The Lapp hurried to warn their people, leaving the observer prepared to defend against the impending wolf attack.|"['1.

After the Lapp left, I kept a close eye on the pack of wolves. They stood still for a while, gazing in a specific direction. I tried to see what had caught their attention but found nothing. Suddenly, they started moving, veering away from a boulder and picking up speed, led by the Pack Chief. There was a sense of great excitement among them. As they moved, I spotted a group of reindeer approaching, chased by wolves from behind and followed by Lapps and dogs. Just as the Lapp had warned, the wolves attacked the reindeer from behind, while the pack that had been still was ready to attack from the front. I was also prepared for the fight, ready to take down as many wolves as possible. The scene unfolded rapidly, with wolves, reindeer, Lapps, and dogs in a chaotic chase across the snow. The Lapps, skilled on their skees, swiftly intervened to protect the reindeer from the wolves, delivering powerful blows to subdue the attackers. The wolves grew more aggressive, launching fierce assaults on the reindeer, resulting in casualties on both sides. Despite my attempts to intervene, the wolves managed to take down some reindeer before being driven off. The battle ended with the wolves defeated and scattered, marking our victory.|"[""1.

My Lapp friend returned as promised, warning me about the wolves' plans to meet in the forest. He explained how they would visit us in small packs and that we needed to stay alert. He also mentioned the challenge of gathering the reindeer. The Lapps invited me to join them for a thrilling skiing adventure. They planned to ski down hills, leap across a chasm and a river, competing to see who could make the longest jump. They described the excitement and risks involved, like hidden boulders and unseen cliffs. The Lapps lined up, then zoomed down the hill, leaping over the gully and river with skill and speed.

Looking up, I saw all the Lapps in position, ready for the descent, and waiting for the raising of the little American flag I always carried with me. This custom dates back to my travels in Africa. As I unfolded it, I kissed it with great affection. The stars and stripes looked beautiful as they waved over the snow. The Lapps started at the signal. One of them, the last in line, seemed to be heading straight towards me. My companion reassured me, explaining that the Lapp was skilled and would not hit me.

During our journey, the Lapp warned me about the possibility of encountering wolves. He suggested having our skees ready to throw out of the sleighs if needed. As we continued, he sensed danger and tied my sleigh to his, preparing for a potential wolf encounter. Soon, we spotted two wolves in the distance. Acting quickly, we threw the skees out, and the Lapp swiftly dealt with the wolves using his bludgeon. He then went after our runaway reindeer while I waited. Later, we reached a tent where we spent the night. The next day, the tent owner invited us to join him and his people on a visit, mentioning that his reindeer were well-trained and in their prime for driving.

"We were unprepared when the reindeer suddenly bolted at a rapid pace and in a wild manner. The Lapps tightly gripped their reins and flung themselves across their sleighs, being carried that way for a short distance. It was a comical scene, unlike anything I had witnessed before! However, they all managed to get back in control as they were experts in handling such situations. We continued at an incredible speed. These were truly the swiftest reindeer I had ever journeyed with. Fortunately, I had mastered the art of balancing in those small Lapp sleighs. The exhilarating speed made everything blur by in a flash. It felt like riding on a luxurious train, but a sudden jolt from hitting an obstacle reminded me that I was not on a train but in ""The Land of the Long Night."" After a thrilling two-hour ride covering nearly fifty miles, we arrived at a Lapp tent. The barking dogs signaled our arrival, and the tent dwellers greeted us warmly. The following day, we returned to our tent, the reindeer still lively and swift. Those two unforgettable rides will always stay with me. Saying goodbye to my Lapp companions, I journeyed to Lake Givijärvi and then to Lake Aitijärvi, where I found a cozy log house on a solitary farm.

A few days after the incidents I just shared, I found myself in Kautokeino, a Lapp village near latitude 69 degrees. The place had unique storehouses owned by the nomadic Lapps. I arrived at the post station and was greeted by the station master. The house had two rooms, one for the family and one for guests. Lapp men and women were resting, preparing for church, visiting their children at school, or stocking up on provisions. Across the station was the cow house with a traditional well surrounded by ice due to the extreme cold, 43 degrees below zero. The daughter of the house was feeding the cows and sheep with a mix of reindeer moss, grass, and warm water. I requested a warm bath and was given one in a large iron pot, scrubbed vigorously with soap and birch twigs until my skin glowed red.|"['1.

It felt wonderful to wear fresh underwear and new clothes in the Arctic chill. The extreme cold made it necessary to cleanse garments without soap or water. The process involved hanging them outside in temperatures of 20 to 50 degrees below zero for several days to kill off any unwanted elements. This method helped keep the clothes clean and ready to wear again. On Sundays, many Lapps traveled long distances on skis or sleighs to attend the Lutheran church, even up to one hundred and fifty miles away. The church was packed, and the clergyman, like everyone else, wore fur due to the unheated church. The hamlet of Kautokeino, with its twelve homesteads, was a gathering place for nomadic Lapps to meet, trade, and share stories. The community included elderly members and those seeking refuge from illness or injury.|['1.

The Lapp women wore colorful caps and silk handkerchiefs in holiday attire, with necklaces, silver belts, and rings as accessories. They dressed in fur dresses with layers of handkerchiefs, reindeer skin trousers, and large glass bead necklaces. Men sported peaked caps. These people were short but agile, with fair hair and blue eyes. They were slender and nimble, able to climb, jump, and run swiftly. The women averaged around 4 feet 10 inches, while the men were generally over five feet tall. The tallest woman was 5 feet 1/2 inch, and the tallest man was 5 feet 4-1/2 inches. The Lapps were hospitable to nomadic Lapps, providing food and shelter. The farm at Lake Givijärvi served as a meeting point for the Lapps, offering them reindeer skins to sleep on. The farmer showed kindness by offering food and accommodation without expecting payment. The journey to Karasjok was through deep snow, and the hamlet was home to about 130 people, with an abundance of horses used for hauling timber.|['1.

In Karasjok, houses were made of logs. The merchant's house stood out. The Karasjok Lapps were tall, some reaching six feet. The women were also tall with dark hair, a rarity with fair skin and blue eyes. Their headgear was unique; men wore square caps filled with eiderdown, and women wore wooden frames resembling helmets. Moving north over the frozen Karasjoki to the Tana River, I saw river Lapps living in small hamlets, fishing for salmon in summer and working as sailors during the codfish season. They had farms with cows, sheep, and goats, while nomadic Lapps cared for their reindeer in the mountains to escape mosquitoes. Despite having money, I felt safe among the God-fearing Finns and Lapps. Some houses were unclean, but hospitality prevailed without locks or knocks on doors.|"['1.

"I whispered to my Lapp companion, ""Let's move on,"" but he insisted we stay overnight due to hunger. The owner guided us to a clean room, providing a reindeer skin for me. Despite my Lapp guide's offer to share the bed, I politely declined. The next day, we had a breakfast of dried reindeer meat, hard bread, and milk before continuing our journey. We reached a river Lapp farm, where the wife, a former sailor, shared their life with us. The farm had diminutive cows, sheep, and reindeer. We then visited a farm run by a hardworking woman and her daughter. They fished, tended animals, and worked tirelessly. As we traveled, we encountered nomadic Lapps with reindeer herds who offered to take us to Nordkyn.

They were right about how fast their animals were. We raced off at a wild speed, and I struggled to stay in my sleigh. I was determined not to fall behind. Eventually, we arrived at a high point dividing the Laxe and Tana fjords, near Nordkyn. The strong north wind forced us to cover our faces. Luckily, we found a Lapp camp, where we were warmly welcomed. After a meal of reindeer meat, we rested. Standing at Cape Nordkyn, the northernmost point of Europe, I gazed at the Arctic Ocean and the ice wall guarding the Pole. Unable to go further north, we turned back. As we crossed a frozen lake to visit nomadic Lapps, the wind picked up, making the ice too slippery for the reindeer. After a challenging journey, we finally reached shore. At night, the eerie howls of foxes filled the air. The next morning, we planned to hunt foxes and other animals for their skins. With Jakob, a Lapp, we set off prepared for camping, carrying essential supplies in our sleighs.|"['1.

After a four-hour journey covering about sixty miles, we reached the shores of a lake. At one end, two conical dwellings of fishing or river Lapps stood, with smoke rising above them, indicating their presence. We secured our reindeer with long ropes to allow them to forage for moss freely. Despite the cold making it hard for the snow to hold, we built two small snow houses, just big enough for each of us to sleep in comfortably. We created a space for a fire, hung our meat high on poles to keep it safe from wolves and foxes, and stacked our sleighs securely. As night fell, we cooked reindeer meat over a fire and enjoyed coffee. Inside our warm snow houses, we dried our clothes and settled in for the night. The howls of foxes startled us, but we found comfort in our cozy shelter. The next morning, with the temperature dropping to 45 degrees below zero, we had breakfast and set out on skees to explore, discovering many fox tracks. Excited at the prospect of obtaining fox skins, we were visited by fishing Lapps from across the lake, whose appearance and garments raised suspicions.

After Jakob left, he entrusted the reindeer to friends at a nearby camp. He assured his return soon and bid farewell. I watched until they vanished, then readied my skis and gun to hunt foxes. Following fresh tracks, I glimpsed elusive white foxes, blending with the snow. Returning to camp, a peculiar sight caught my eye near the reindeer meat. Three white foxes eyed the meat, plotting a way to reach it. Stealthily, I observed their failed attempts. Later, we devised a plan, luring them with meat and ambushing successfully. Two white foxes were captured, their elegant snowy fur a marvel. A gray fox appeared, a rare prize we skinned meticulously.|['1.

The following day, Jakob crafted numerous traps for ermines. These traps were ingeniously designed: a loop connected to a string was tied to a branch, strategically placed above where bait was set. As the ermine approached the bait, it would inadvertently slip its head through the loop, tightening it around its neck and trapping it in the air. While observing a majestic snowy owl perched on a nearby tree branch, Jakob remarked that the owl was likely hunting ermines, indicating their presence in the area. Concerned about the ptarmigans being preyed upon, I aimed my gun and shot down the owl. Despite the challenges of hunting elusive foxes, we managed to capture several ptarmigans for food. Jakob's resourcefulness shone through as he deftly used a lasso to secure the wild reindeer. After a successful day, we returned to Jakob's tent for a warm supper. Eager to learn more about wildlife, I asked Jakob to share his knowledge about bears. He explained how bears fatten up before winter hibernation and become lean upon emerging in spring, presenting a greater danger due to their insatiable hunger.|"['1.

Jakob shared insights about bears preparing for winter by choosing safe spots under boulders or trees to protect themselves from the snow. Bears carefully scout the area, ensuring no danger lurks before settling down. They use their keen sense of smell to detect threats and relocate if needed. Bears are cautious creatures, making it challenging to hunt them without dogs in the summer. They are quick and alert, requiring hunters to be even more cautious. The narrator recounted an encounter with a bear while camping near a large boulder to stay hidden from the bear. The next day, they searched for the bear, observing its behavior and cautious nature in selecting a sheltered spot. The bear's vigilance and thorough inspections before hibernating showcase its survival instincts.|"['1.

In the Arctic regions of Sweden, Norway, and Finland, bears are large animals with varying fur colors, often shades of brown. While dangerous, they are not as threatening as grizzly bears. During a journey between the 69th and 70th degrees north latitude, the narrator encountered a bear with a Lapp companion. The Lapp predicted the bear's behavior and planned to hunt it in the spring. The group navigated the treacherous terrain to reach the Ulf fjord, a deep inlet surrounded by towering mountains. The Lapps explained the importance of mountain shelters during storms and warned of the fierce winds in March. Despite the challenges, the narrator felt supported by distant loved ones, encouraging them to press on fearlessly.|"[""1.

We set off on our journey, encountering a Finn hamlet where Finlanders and Laplanders were preparing to travel to the Ulf fjord with their sleighs and reindeer. The animals were trained to eat reindeer moss. Jakob and the Lapps left me in the care of Finlanders heading towards the Arctic Sea. John Puranen, a kind and strong man, became my companion. We joined a group transporting reindeer meat, butter, cheese, and more to sell on the coast. At a farm for rest, the room was packed with sleeping men. The freezing morning at 42 degrees below zero was followed by a breakfast of reindeer meat and coffee. As the wind picked up, snow flew in the air, making it hard to see. Lost and anxious, I relied on my reindeer to follow the group ahead.|['1.

I wished I didn't have any facial hair or hair at all because breaking the icy mask was excruciating. Each time I shattered it, the ice quickly reformed from new snow particles sticking together, feeling like my face was being ripped apart. If I didn't clear it, the ice mask would blind me. Alone, with no one in sight, I feared starvation and death in the fierce storm. Desperate, I decided to rely on my skiing skills if I had to abandon my sleigh and reindeer. Suddenly, through the mist, a black figure approached. Was it a pack of wolves? I readied my gun, but shooting accurately in the storm seemed impossible. The thought of being attacked by starving wolves terrified me. Yet, a group of familiar voices emerged, relieved that I was found. We bid farewell to our refuge and continued towards the Arctic Sea, bracing for the approaching storm.|"['1.

I felt a wave of relief as we reached the house of refuge, knowing we had hurried just in time. Without our speed, we wouldn't have made it. I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened to John, me, and the others. Inside, reindeer skins covered the floor to shield us from the fierce wind. Before bed, we removed our shoes, hanging them with our stockings and Lapp grass near the ceiling. We thanked the farmer and his wife before settling in for the night. In my dreams, familiar voices encouraged me to be brave and explore 'The Land of the Long Night.' Waking up, I pondered my love for adventure despite having dear friends at home. The next morning, John warned of unpredictable mountain weather. After a hearty breakfast, John meticulously prepared me for the challenging day ahead, ensuring I was well-equipped for the journey.|"['1.

John was correct about the weather. Hours after we left, the wind grew stronger, and fierce gusts threatened to overturn our sleighs. The blinding snow made it hard to see, and the thick fog made it seem like night instead of day. Breaking through the ice covering the snow was a constant struggle. John, being the hero he was, tied our sleighs together to ensure we stayed together in the storm. The wind intensified, making it challenging to move forward. We met up with other members of our group who had stopped due to the impossible travel conditions. The storm was relentless, blowing snow all around us, and the temperature dropped to 17 degrees below zero.

"The wind grew so strong that we had to huddle by the rocks, feeling like we were in the heart of ""The Land of the Wind."" I feared chaos was near as the wind howled relentlessly. Eventually, the gusts calmed, and we readied to resume our journey. John warned of the perilous descent ahead. As we set off, our reindeer raced down the mountain slopes, reaching speeds of 25 miles per hour. The thrilling ride down was followed by a challenging ascent.

During our journey, the reindeer often showed signs of exhaustion, panting heavily and even falling down. John reassured me that this behavior was normal and that they would soon recover. After a brief rest and some snow, they were back on their feet. As we reached a mountain peak, John warned me about the dangerous descent ahead along a steep ravine. Each sleigh was securely tied to a reindeer, and the men checked every cord meticulously to ensure our safety. The descent was nerve-wracking, with the sleighs lashed together and the reindeer acting as brakes. I was advised to keep my legs inside the sleigh for safety. The thrilling ride down the hill was both grand and perilous, but the experienced Lapps and Finns navigated it with skill and confidence.|"['1.

Every reindeer strained back, acting as brakes on the sleighs ahead, preventing a disastrous descent down the rocky slope. The fear of slipping loomed as we navigated the treacherous path. Eventually, we reached the bottom of the ravine, breathless from the thrilling ride. The next day, we continued through juniper, birch, and fir trees, finally arriving at the Ulf Fjord in Norway. The frozen fjord led to the Arctic Sea, where a warm current from the Gulf Stream prevented complete ice cover. Boarding a vessel heading north, I bid farewell to my sleigh and reindeer, now dressed as a fisherman to brave the Arctic waters.

"As I stood quietly on deck observing the sea, the captain remarked, ""We're fortunate to have pleasant weather today. This winter has been harsh with relentless storms and blinding snow, making it hard to even see each other on deck."" Our ship, the _Ragnild_, a sturdy Norwegian brig, had endured many storms along the coast of Norway and the Arctic Sea. We were headed to Finmarken to trade for codfish. The morning brought heavy rolling seas and a fierce gale. The wind howled, and the waves towered like hills. The captain warned, ""We must use all our skills to battle this storm, but we are a strong crew."" Looking at the waves, I thought of ancient beliefs about the sea gods and their fierce daughters, who controlled the winds and waves."|['1.

As the captain and crew braced for the impending danger, a colossal wave approached, resembling the fierce Hrönn. Its towering presence obscured the horizon, signaling imminent peril. With bated breath, they awaited the inevitable collision. Just as disaster seemed inevitable, the wave mercifully broke before reaching the ship, enveloping it in a veil of foam. A sigh of relief echoed through the crew as they narrowly evaded catastrophe. But the respite was brief, as another wave, reminiscent of Bylgja, loomed on the horizon. Slowly and menacingly, it surged towards them, threatening to engulf the ship. However, like its predecessor, it crashed harmlessly before reaching them, painting the sea in a blanket of white foam. Despite the ongoing tempest, the crew's resilience mirrored that of legendary Viking warriors, navigating the treacherous waters with unwavering resolve.|"['1.

After a powerful wave hit our ship, a part of the protective side was torn away, flooding the deck with water and almost sweeping us overboard. This reminded me of a Viking saga about Fridthjof facing a fierce storm at sea. Fridthjof wisely advised his men to carry gold for protection. We hurried to adjust the sails to avoid being overwhelmed by the waves. The captain then decided to halt the ship to wait out the storm. After a tense six hours, the storm calmed, and we set sail towards the shore. However, we encountered a dangerous cross-sea where waves clashed from all directions. The wind shifted, forcing us to navigate against it with reefed sails. As we approached a rocky island, the sea's violent clash against the shore echoed like distant cannon fire, creating a daunting sight. Seamen fear the coast during storms more than the open sea. We sought shelter behind the island, anchoring in calm waters to rest the crew until the storm passed.|"[""1.

As the weather calmed, we lifted our anchor and sailed on with a favorable wind. The night descended, shrouding the sea, sky, and horizon in impenetrable darkness. I felt small amidst the vastness that enveloped our vessel. Our ship seemed no larger than a hazelnut adrift in the immense ocean. Occasionally, the waves sparkled with a luminous glow, caused by tiny creatures called animalculæ emitting phosphorescence when jostled by the waves. These microscopic beings create a stunning effect of light in the sea. The ship plowed through the water, leaving behind a radiant trail resembling a bright serpent. The crew remained vigilant, with lookout men scanning for dangers like other ships or rocks. Amidst the dark night, the compass guided us safely through the treacherous waters.|"['1.

Early the next morning, I went up on deck to escape the stuffy cabin. The vast horizon surrounded us, always seeming near yet unreachable. The horizon is the endless space where Earth orbits the sun. We arrived at a bustling fair with Laplanders and Finlanders selling reindeer meat, cheese, and furs. After a brief stop, we sailed along the bleak coast to a hidden harbor protected by islands, where a fishing settlement bustled with boats unloading codfish. Men in leather overalls prepared the fish by salting, drying, and packing them for export. Barrels of cod eggs were sent to Italy and France for sardine fisheries. The warehouses were stacked with salted cod, the prized commodity of this remote land.|['1.

The area was filled with fish drying on frames, nets, and lines scattered on the rocks. The ground was soaked with fish blood and waste. Seagulls and eider ducks fed on the sea's waste, as it was forbidden to hunt the ducks. The rocks were covered with cod heads left to dry, later used as fertilizer or cattle feed. Surprised by this, I joined Captain Petersen in a fisherman's house. The crew, including captains, welcomed us. The room had a central stove, benches, and chests for their belongings. They offered me a bunk and served lobscouse, a pudding made of biscuits, liver, and fish, which they ate daily. They only drank coffee as alcohol was prohibited to keep the crew safe at sea. Captain Ole shared about the annual salmon migration from the sea to the rivers for spawning.|"['1.

Every year, the codfish journey to the Lofoden Islands to spawn in vast numbers, then migrate north to Finmarken and even as far as Russia, only to vanish until the following year. The fishermen rely on the cod's timely return to the fishing banks, with an average catch of forty to forty-two million cod a year. Without these fish, life would be challenging in the barren land. Similarly, herrings appear in immense shoals, their numbers immeasurable. Their migration is unpredictable, sometimes disappearing for years before reappearing. The fishermen are well-prepared for their expeditions, with boats registered and crew details recorded for safety. The women at home support them by weaving wool into warm clothing and managing the household while the men are away. The fishermen set out early in the morning, equipped in oilskin garments, ready for a day of fishing. The sight of over nine hundred boats rowing in unison is a grand spectacle.|"['1.

Once we left the harbor, the boats raised their sails, dispersing in various directions towards their buoys. I marveled at the sea filled with thousands of white sails. Our fishing vessel, a sturdy craft measuring forty-two feet long and about seven and a half feet wide, had a decked cabin below the poop for the crew to rest. The captain maneuvered the boat with a rudder-like oar while steering. Captain Ole, an experienced sailor, led our crew consisting of Sven, Hakon, Fridthjof, Ivor, Evert, Harald, and Erik. Evert and Harald, young lads of seventeen, were learning the ropes from their father. After three hours battling the wind, we reached the fishing grounds with countless buoys and glass balls marking the nets. It was a challenge to navigate through them. The crew worked tirelessly to haul in the nets, revealing a bountiful catch of around eight hundred codfish. This successful day at sea was a result of teamwork and skill.|['1.

Captain Johansen, a seasoned sailor of forty-two years, shared his seafaring tales with me as we prepared for a day of fishing. Our boat, smaller than the netting vessel, set out among a sea of boats manned by thousands of sailors. We cast our lines, each with about five thousand hooks, and began the exciting task of hauling in the catch. The reels turned as we pulled in over twenty-four hundred fathoms, each revealing a cod on many hooks. Excitement filled the air as we encountered a tangle with another line, but perseverance prevailed, and we continued to reel in a bountiful haul. Despite a brief entanglement, the day ended with over two hundred cod fish caught, leaving the fishermen brimming with joy and satisfaction.|['1.

Our fourth line was caught in nets and tangled with lines from different owners. It was a tough job to untangle them, but luckily each line had markings showing the boat number and district letter. We had to cut the badly tangled lines and kept the fish for their owners based on the marks. Captain Johansen and the crew thought the cod would stay longer. The wind picked up, the sea got rough, and we faced hail and sleet. Despite the challenging weather, we safely navigated back to port. The next day, a fierce gale kept boats ashore. Captain Johansen shared stories of the Arctic Ocean's dangers. He recounted the historic battle of Svold in the year 1000, involving King Olaf Tryggvasson's fleet and his enemies lying in ambush.|"['1.

Three chiefs decided the order of attack on Olaf Tryggvasson's ship by drawing lots. Svein of Denmark was to attack first, followed by Olaf of Sweden, and Erik Jarl last if needed. Each chief would own the ships they cleared and captured. Erik Jarl's ship, the _Jarn Bardi_, was known for its iron-clad ram. As they planned, they saw a large ship with a dragon-head, the _Long Serpent_, over 360 feet long with a crew of 750. Sigvaldi Jarl lowered his sails and rowed towards the island, followed by others. When Olaf arrived, his men waited for him, informing him of the enemy fleets. Thorkel Dydril suggested sailing out to sea to prepare. Olaf's men missed the ships that had sailed ahead, and they saw their foes' overwhelming fleet. Olaf ordered the _Long Serpent_ forward to lead in battle against King Svein's Danish ships. The battle began fiercely with arrows, spears, and swords. The Danes attacked, but Olaf's men defended bravely, hooking anchors to clear the enemy ships. Erik Jarl cleared Olaf's ships until only the _Long Serpent_ remained, carrying the remaining fighters.|"[""1.

Erik Jarl fiercely attacked the _Long Serpent_ with five large ships. A brutal fight ensued, with a shower of weapons raining down on the ship. King Olaf Tryggvasson's men, in a fury, leaped overboard in their eagerness to fight. Erik Jarl and his men boarded the _Long Serpent_ after a hard fight with Hyrning and his followers. Seeking advice from Thorkel the High, Erik was advised to use large timbers to careen the _Long Serpent_ for an easier conquest. The ship was captured, but King Olaf was lost at sea.

While sailing along the shore, I spotted weather-beaten logs covered in barnacles. The captain explained that these logs likely drifted from South America's rivers via the Gulf Stream. As we entered the sound, fishing settlements emerged with white houses, ships, churches, and schools. The next day, in a fjord, we encountered fishing boats returning from sea. Some boats, manned by Sea Lapps, had women rowers and captains. The women, with long shaggy hair, wore reindeer trousers and rowed skillfully. Captain Petersen mentioned that many Sea Lapps own and operate their boats, with women serving as hardy sailors. The Sea Lapps hurried to prepare for our arrival, showcasing their unique homes built from sod, turf, stone, or logs. Their attire included ragged vadmal dresses and distinctive headgear.|"[""1.

The wooden part of the house served as the main room for all activities. The roof, supported by poles and covered with birch bark, was insulated with a thick layer of earth to keep out the cold. The household included two cows, two oxen, eight sheep, and two goats, all housed in the turf section of the dwelling. I visited a turf house nearby and saw locals using small carts drawn by tiny oxen to transport seaweed. These carts, reminiscent of ancient designs, had solid wooden wheels crafted from fir trees. I also met Ole Maja, a wealthy Sea Lapp, who lived in a log house with a clean and simple interior. Ole explained how he used a horse for hauling logs on frozen rivers and fed his animals raw fish as a special treat, a surprising sight to behold.|['1.

One day, I was settled in a cozy shelter owned by Matias Laiti, enjoying a meal of reindeer meat and fish, particularly relishing the boiled head of fresh cod. Accompanied by a large wooden bowl of milk that had a peculiar fishy taste, everything seemed to have a hint of fish. The Sea Lapp community I visited served delicious fish and reindeer meat dishes, as they own reindeer shared among family and friends. On Sundays, the Sea Lapps dressed in vibrant headpieces and attire for church service across the fjord. The children were about to return home as summer approached, and the Swedish-Norwegian Lapps were literate. As the Lapps warned me about the changing conditions for travel due to the sun's increasing strength, I realized the urgency to depart before the snow melted, rendering reindeer travel difficult. The continuous daylight in April marked the end of the Long Night in the far North.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the narrator enjoying in Matias Laiti's cozy shelter?\nA) Boiled head of fresh cod\nB) Beef stew\nC) Chicken soup\nD) Lamb chops\nE) Shrimp cocktail"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did the Sea Lapp community serve that had a peculiar fishy taste?\nA) Apple pie\nB) Chocolate cake\nC) Blueberry muffins\nD) Milk\nE) Orange juice', 'Question 3:\nWhat did the Sea Lapps dress in for church service on Sundays?\nA) Casual jeans and t-shirts\nB) Vibrant headpieces and attire\nC) Business suits\nD) Pajamas\nE) Athletic wear', ""Question 4:\nWhat did the Lapps warn the narrator about regarding travel conditions?\nA) Increasing snowfall\nB) Strong winds\nC) Changing conditions due to the sun's increasing strength\nD) Heavy rainfall\nE) Earthquakes"", 'Question 5:\nWhat marked the end of the Long Night in the far North?\nA) Heavy fog\nB) Snowstorm\nC) Continuous daylight in April\nD) Thunderstorm\nE) Eclipse', 'Question 6:\nWhat season were the children about to return home from?\nA) Winter\nB) Spring\nC) Summer\nD) Fall\nE) Monsoon']"|"['A) Boiled head of fresh cod', 'D) Milk', 'B) Vibrant headpieces and attire', ""C) Changing conditions due to the sun's increasing strength"", 'C) Continuous daylight in April', 'C) Summer']"
"That evening, I stood on the hill, gazing at the fjord and Arctic Ocean. Alaska crossed my mind, recalling my adventures in ""Snow Land"" and ""The Land of the Winds."" I envisioned Alaska thriving like Finmarken with fishing towns. Both regions share similarities in latitude, barren coasts, fjords, and long nights. To prosper, Alaska needs to protect its fisheries like the Swedes and Norwegians. Planting trees on barren hills and importing reindeer could transform the landscape. Encouraging Samoides and Laplanders to settle in Alaska would bring their expertise in reindeer care. Establishing hamlets, schools, and churches, along with medical services, is crucial. The government should build shelters for refuge during storms and facilitate easy travel with reindeer and skis.

"My small sled, skis, bags, and winter clothes were unloaded, laid out in front of me. I took off my heavy winter gear and sea boots, saying, ""We've faced rough weather on this Arctic sea. I no longer need you. I hope you keep the Sea Lapp dry."" I changed back into my Lapp outfit. The fur winter shoes were not suitable for travel, only for dry snow. I had leather shoes that were waterproof. A Lapp treated them with tar and fat to keep them dry. I put on new wool socks and Lapp grass around my feet.

The next morning brought joy as the reindeer arrived, one for me, one for my guide, and a spare. They looked different from those in winter, thin and shedding their coats. The hard work they endured digging snow for food made them tired. My guide, Mikel, a nomadic Lapp, was sturdy, nimble, and weathered, with a face red from the wind. Before setting off, I bid farewell to the Arctic Sea and its storms, grateful for the lessons learned. Journeying through the birch forest was challenging, with the snow deepening as we headed south. We stopped for the night among the bags on the snow, finding warmth in one. The next day, as the sun's rays intensified, the snow softened, making travel tough for the reindeer.

During our journey, we had to halt to allow the reindeer to rest. In the meantime, we used our skees to hunt for game, but unfortunately, no foxes or wolves were in sight. As the snow began to freeze again in the late afternoon, we resumed our trek. Since we could only travel when the sun's glare was less intense, we turned night into day. The following day, under cloudy skies with hard snow, we traveled without pause. By midnight, our tired reindeer needed a break to rest and find fresh replacements. The next morning, the clear sky and bright sun created a blinding glare on the snow, requiring protective goggles. While out hunting ptarmigans, I encountered a unique fox with changing fur colors. After a successful hunt, we found shelter with a welcoming Lapp family, looking forward to a warm meal of reindeer meat and broth.|"['1.

I had a delightful experience enjoying warm reindeer meat and broth. Feeling famished, I relished the meal before embarking on our journey, accompanied by a Laplander. Setting off at three in the morning, we witnessed countless herds of reindeer heading west towards the Arctic Sea. The sight of over thirty thousand reindeer in herds of one to three thousand was breathtaking. The Laplanders skillfully guided the reindeer on skis with their dogs. I marveled at the newborn reindeer being transported on special sleds with their mothers close by. Later, I witnessed a fierce battle between two herds of reindeer, with the bulls engaging in a mighty clash. As we traveled south, the twilight dimmed compared to the bright northern land where daylight emanated from the pole. Despite the changeable weather, the journey was filled with awe-inspiring sights and experiences.|"['1.

The tiny, empty house was spotless inside. Some provisions hung from the ceiling, likely left by a Lapp or another traveler. The food was untouched, preserved for the owner's return. It felt sacred and secure, no one daring to disturb it. We peeked inside the package: hard bread, reindeer cheese, smoked reindeer tongue, a coffee pot, coffee, and wood for a fire. These shelters, built by the government, were for emergencies like storms, lacking caretakers. After a long journey, I ventured out on skis for a stroll, bringing my gun. I spotted hares, their fur changing for summer camouflage. Nature's adaptations fascinated me. Returning, Mikel had supper ready by the crackling fire. Reindeer delicacies awaited us. Mikel, lost in thought, revealed a plan to hunt a massive brown bear. Excited, we agreed, eager for the challenge and the reward.|"['1.

In the fall, while hunting, I spotted a large brown bear preparing for winter. It circled some pines before vanishing into a den. The bear sensed a snowstorm coming. In the midst of my excitement, I had a nightmare about the bear. Later, we set out to find the bear's den. As we approached, the snow-covered mound trembled, revealing the awakening bear. The noise startled him, causing the snow to crack and the bear to emerge. This event stirred much excitement, and preparations for the hunt began. Men armed with guns and sticks, along with dogs, set out to track the bear about thirty miles away. Eventually, we located the bear's den, and as the snow trembled, the bear emerged, ready to face the world after his long winter slumber.|"['1.

He gazed around in awe, appearing stunned by the sudden and peculiar scene unfolding before him. Sitting back on his haunches, he let out a powerful growl, leaving us unsure of his intentions – whether to fight or flee. The dogs barked furiously at the massive creature but kept a safe distance. We huddled together, ready to shoot without risking harm to our group. The bear, growing agitated, emitted a series of menacing growls and reared up on his hind legs. In that moment of tension, Mikel and I fired. A pained grunt indicated our shots hit the bear. As it staggered towards us, we prepared to shoot again, but the beast collapsed, staining the snow with its blood. After the bear's demise, we had to act swiftly as we had veered off course into Finland, heading eastward. We corrected our path westward, reaching the river Muonio near a Finnish village named Kuttainen, close to Karesuando. The journey became increasingly hazardous as we encountered the river's cracked and melting ice, making travel perilous. Mikel assured me of his familiarity with the route, though we needed to proceed cautiously due to the unstable ice conditions. Despite the challenging conditions, we pressed on, taking shelter in Songamuodka overnight as snow fell gently, adding to the already treacherous terrain.|['1.
