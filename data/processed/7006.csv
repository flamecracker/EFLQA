It was a quiet evening in September, 1728. The apprentices had finished their work and supper was ready in the room above the shop. Bailie Anderson, his wife, foreman John Gillespie, and two apprentices were seated at the table. The apprentices were eager to eat, waiting for the grace to finish. A knock at the door interrupted the silence. The bailie advised caution before opening the door to a stranger. The old servant, Elspeth, went to see who was at the door. She opened it to find the bailie's brother, Malcolm, carrying a child. Malcolm surprised everyone with his sudden arrival. After a warm welcome, Malcolm shared that the child was not his and that he had stories to tell about his adventures over the past fifteen years.

The bailie explained that tobacco was used for conversation and he believed it helped in thinking. He said that although he didn't drink much, on certain occasions like the present one, it was fine to have a glass. Malcolm agreed, mentioning his adventures during the '15 troubles. He reminisced about joining forces with the Earl of Mar's army and the various clansmen who gathered. However, due to a lack of arms and leadership, the army remained idle.

Preston was strategically located, with a narrow bridge over the river Ribble making it defensible. The road leading to town was so narrow that only two men could walk side by side. Cromwell's attack was nearly fatal. The town was divided into four posts for defense. Derwentwater and his brothers showed bravery, but Lord Derwentwater's poor leadership led to confusion. When General Wilde approached, Farquharson was ordered to retreat by the cowardly Mr. Forster. The Highlanders, furious and disheartened, prepared for battle. The English attacked, but were repelled. The town was set on fire, and a tough fight ensued. Eventually, Forster agreed to surrender, betraying his comrades. Forster escaped punishment, leaving a bitter feeling among the defeated fighters.|"['1.

During a battle, we were captured by English troops and marched as prisoners to a church. Despite wounds, we were treated decently. In Barnet, a kind woman offered aid. With her help, we escaped in disguise. We traveled through the night, aided by sympathizers of the Chevalier. Eventually, we reached the coast and sailed to safety. The battle outcome was mixed, leading to the Chevalier's retreat. His brief return didn't change our fate.

Leslie, a brave Scottish soldier, served in the French army alongside the narrator. Despite offers to become an officer, the narrator preferred the camaraderie of the troopers.

"Travelling under the cover of night and spending a day hidden in the woods, I crossed the border without trouble and reached Ostend. There, I sold my horse and secured a passage to Leith. Arriving two days ago, I have made my way here, occasionally catching a ride in a cart. Now, brother Andrew, I seek your hospitality for myself and Leslie's son. Although I possess a hundred louis, they rightfully belong to the child. As for me, I confess to having nothing, as saving has never been my forte.""Malcolm chuckled, ""His chances would improve if he had.

Malcolm was torn between two paths. The life of a soldier beckoned, with fifteen more years of adventure awaiting him. Yet, the thought of leaving behind Leslie and his young boy gave him pause. The bailie, having endured his wife's complaints about Malcolm's behavior, understood the mismatch in their household. Despite this, he offered to care for the boy, seeing it as a chance to bring joy into their childless home. Malcolm, grateful for the offer, felt conflicted about his future.

Malcolm stayed with his brother for three weeks before starting his new job driving cattle. He visited Glasgow every few months but never stayed with Andrew, opting for a nearby lodging instead. He spent evenings smoking with his brother and took the child for walks in the morning, speaking French to ensure the boy remembered the language. Malcolm wrote to Colonel Leslie and the major, hoping his letters would reach them despite the uncertain post. Years later, he searched for the colonel in Paris but found no trace. Ronald, the colonel's son, grew mischievous under the bailie's care. Malcolm trained him in swordsmanship, hoping to uncover the mystery of the colonel's disappearance someday.|"['1.

Ronald's lessons in swordplay began early, with Malcolm sharing tales of his war adventures during breaks. At fourteen, Malcolm felt Ronald needed more training and took him to a fencing school in Glasgow run by a comrade. Ronald kept this secret from his family, sneaking away for lessons. His father's uncertain fate weighed on Ronald, altering his carefree nature. He spent hours contemplating ways to rescue his father, questioning Malcolm about prisons. Despite Malcolm's warnings, Ronald remained hopeful, planning a daring escape. Ronald's dedication to swordsmanship impressed his instructor, who noted his skill and determination.

Malcolm considered the rumours about a Stuart uprising, expressing doubts about their success in battle. He favored the Stuarts but acknowledged their past failures. Despite his loyalty, he questioned the Stuarts' leadership abilities. Ronald, on the other hand, heard of loyalty to the crown but noted the lack of enthusiasm for the Hanoverian kings. The Stuarts' Catholic leanings and the unpopularity of the Hanoverians made the situation complex. Loyalty in Scotland was divided, with the Highlanders supporting the Stuarts while the Lowlanders leaned towards the Hanoverians due to religious differences. Ronald's family history tied to the Stuarts contrasted with the prevailing sentiments towards the current ruling house. Loyalty was more religious than civil, with past conflicts shaping allegiances.|"['1.

Ronald acknowledged his debt to them but expressed his loyalty to his father's cause. Malcolm stressed the importance of respecting his guardians until he comes of age.

He found it hard to fathom that a young lad from a respected family would risk his life to aid a traitor in escaping from a house under surveillance. The bailie, Andrew, defended the boy's character, attributing his actions to youthful mischief rather than malice.

Andrew Anderson returned home feeling deeply troubled. He had kept a secret about the boy living with him, claiming he was the child of an old friend instead of revealing he was Colonel Leslie's son.

The days passed slowly for Ronald as he waited, and Andrew Anderson managed to visit him a couple of times. The bailie wisely refrained from scolding him, instead urging Ronald to confess all he knew about the failed plot. The bailie found it hard to believe that Ronald risked his life for the Stuarts out of mere loyalty, suspecting deeper involvement. Ronald, however, insisted he had told the truth. A note found in his prison bread gave him hope that friends were working to help him. The authorities, feeling embarrassed for letting Ronald escape, took drastic measures to transport him to London.

Malcolm's weather forecast was quickly confirmed. The wind picked up fast, dark clouds raced across the sky, and the sea became rough by nightfall. Ronald had already gone below deck, seasick. Malcolm, holding onto the ship's shroud, observed the worsening conditions. The wind was shifting towards the north, indicating a storm brewing. The Dutch skipper attempted to change course but failed, eventually deciding to wear the ship. Despite their efforts, the ship was being pushed towards the French coast. Malcolm, realizing the danger, urged the skipper to increase sail, but it was futile. They were rapidly approaching the shore. The anchors were readied, but as they dropped, a massive wave struck the ship, causing it to veer towards land.

Signals were exchanged between ships, and anchors were dropped as a fierce storm hit, scattering the fleet. Many ships were lost, and the survivors arrived in French ports battered. Ronald, with the regiment in Paris, learned from his mother's family that freeing his father was nearly impossible as long as the Marquis de Recambours held sway. Despite warnings, Ronald tried to contact his mother, but she refused to meet, fearing for his safety. Later, Marshal Saxe offered help but advised against rash actions. Some of his mother's family sought favour with the king's favourite by sharing Ronald's story. The marquis confronted Colonel Hume but was rebuffed. Ronald was offered a commission and warned against further attempts to free his father.|"['1.

Two nights later, Ronald and Malcolm were returning from dinner with Colonel Hume and his officers when they were ambushed by six men in a narrow street. Malcolm, warned by Colonel Hume of the danger posed by the marquis, swiftly drew his sword and struck down the attackers. Ronald, although young, was skilled in combat and held his own against the assailants. After a brief scuffle, the remaining men fled in fear. Ronald spared one wounded man, sending a message to the marquis that he was not easily defeated. The group soon left Paris, relieved to be away from the constant threat of danger.

Ronald firmly declined the offer of a horse, stating that he had all the horses he needed. His friend, Malcolm, suspected that men sent by the marquis were spying on Ronald. Malcolm believed that the men were trying to harm Ronald but were waiting for the right moment. The colonel suggested that it must have been one of the men who sent the false horse-selling story. The next day, while riding through a dense wood, Ronald's horse was shot at, narrowly missing him. Captain Campbell and his men searched the area but found no one. The captain found the incident suspicious and wondered why someone would target the officers. The mystery of the attempted attack remained unsolved.|"['1.

"""It may be just my imagination, Colonel,"" Ronald explained, ""but I can't shake the feeling that the recent incident echoes the one I mentioned in Paris.

That night, Lieutenant Crawford, fueled by too much drink, provoked Ronald beyond jesting. Ronald, feeling insulted, warned Crawford to stop. The other officers supported Ronald, urging Crawford to calm down. Ignoring the advice, Crawford insulted Ronald, challenging him to a duel. Ronald, refusing to fight, sought a peaceful resolution. Suddenly, a cry pierced the air, leading everyone to a fallen man. The soldiers were clueless about the attacker. As they returned to the fire, the colonel expressed concern over the murder and the recent attacks on his officers. Despite the tension, the colonel understood Ronald's predicament with Crawford.

On the 7th of May, the French army prepared for battle against the English forces. The French chose the village of Fontenoy as their battleground. Marshal Noailles led troops to occupy the area, while the rest of the army took their positions. The English, aware of the impending battle, also readied themselves. That evening, the king hosted a grand reception for his officers. Colonel Hume returned to his camp where Major Munro expressed confidence in their strategic advantage. The French had a strong defensive position with natural obstacles and fortifications. As dawn broke, the troops assumed their positions. The battle commenced with cannon fire as the Dutch troops hesitated and the English forces advanced. Despite initial setbacks, the English center pushed forward under the Duke of Cumberland's command.|['1.

After the surrender, the army fell back and took a defensive stance. The king quickly returned to Paris, leaving Marshal Saxe in command.

The Duke and the Prince were discussing the risky venture the Prince was embarking on with only a few companions. The Prince was in disguise, and his friends were being discreet to avoid suspicion. A young man, Ronald, shared with them his duel with the Duke of Chateaurouge, a renowned swordsman in France, whom he had killed. The Prince and the Duke were amazed by Ronald's feat, and the Duke recalled a past scandal involving Ronald's father, Leslie of Glenlyon, and the Duke of Chateaurouge.

Ronald happily informed the prince that his parents had been freed and were now residing on his mother's estate in the south. Marshal Saxe secured their release after a victory at Fontenoy. The Duke of Chateaurouge, an enemy of Ronald's father, insulted him, leading to a duel where Ronald bested him. With his father's enemies gone, Ronald hoped for his mother to reclaim her rightful estates. They planned to board the Doutelle that evening. Prince Charles, with his charm and athleticism, was well-liked but sometimes fell prey to flattery. Ronald, accompanied by his loyal friend Anderson, was eager to join the prince on their expedition.

The group had weapons and ammunition on board, including muskets, broadswords, and field pieces. The Doutelle ship, with only eighteen guns, was to sail alongside the Elizabeth to Scotland. The vessels set sail north, with the prince disguised as a Scottish student for safety. When a British warship approached, the Elizabeth prepared to fight, but the Doutelle captain refused to engage to protect the prince's mission. The battle lasted hours, leaving both ships damaged. The Elizabeth returned to France, and the Lion went to Plymouth for repairs. Malcolm and Ronald discussed the risky mission, with Malcolm skeptical about its success due to lack of support. Ronald remained hopeful, believing in the Highland clans' loyalty. Malcolm, more experienced, doubted the English Jacobites' commitment.

Ronald expressed his hope to Malcolm about the noble young prince fighting for justice. The prince, enthusiastic and flushed with excitement, landed on Erisca islet, where an eagle flying overhead was seen as a good omen. Despite facing challenges with English warships, the prince's determination led him to seek support from Clanranald and other chiefs. Initially met with resistance, the prince's persuasion eventually convinced Macdonalds to join his cause. Locheil's crucial decision to support the prince marked a turning point, inspiring other chiefs to rally behind the Stuart claim.

After arriving at Borodale, Charles abandoned his limited fortune of four thousand louis d'or and some weapons from the Doutelle. He then traveled by water to Kinloch Moidart. Mr. Walsh departed on the Doutelle with the prince's gratitude and a letter requesting his father in Rome to grant Mr. Walsh an Irish earldom for his services. Ronald, unaffected by Malcolm's warnings, embraced the mission wholeheartedly. He marveled at the Highlanders in their traditional dress, especially the robust mountaineers. Charles swiftly changed into Highland attire, winning over all with his charm. Murray of Broughton, a significant figure, joined Charles at Moidart, bringing printed manifestoes for distribution.

Sir John Cope, the English commander in Scotland, ordered his troops to gather at Stirling when he heard of trouble. He had two young regiments of dragoons, Gardiner's and Hamilton's, totaling three thousand men. His plan was to march west to crush the rebellion swiftly. The English government backed him and offered a reward for capturing the alleged Prince of Wales. Cope set out from Edinburgh with fifteen hundred infantry, leaving the dragoons behind due to the terrain. He carried baggage, cattle for food, and arms for volunteers. His first target was Fort Augustus, but he faced a challenging mountain pass. Prince Charles, informed of Cope's advance, reached the strategic position first. Cope's council decided to march to Inverness instead. Charles, burning impediments, descended to the Lowlands, while Cope retreated to Inverness. The Highlanders rejoiced at Cope's avoidance of battle. Charles, with new allies, moved to Perth, strengthening his army with experienced officers like Lord George Murray.|"[""1.

Lord George Murray quickly began to rally the tenants of his absent brother, the Duke of Athole, who were loyal to the Stuart cause and still looked up to the Marquis of Tullibardine. They willingly armed themselves under Lord George's command, opting to fight in their traditional Highland manner with broadswords and targets. However, discord arose among the leaders early on. Secretary Murray, aiming for power with the prince, failed to influence Lord George but successfully turned the young Duke of Perth against him. Meanwhile, Prince Charles was swayed by Murray's flattery and deceit, while Lord George's straightforward nature clashed with the prince's preferences. Ronald, a new addition with military experience, caught Lord George's eye and was appointed as one of his aides de camp. The prince's efforts to win over Lord Lovat, a powerful nobleman, were met with double-dealing, ultimately costing Lovat his life. Prince Charles, seizing the initiative, marched south to Edinburgh, where a lack of courage among the citizens and the flight of dragoons led to the city falling into the hands of the prince without resistance.|"[""1.

In the evening, a grand ball was held in the palace despite being within range of Edinburgh Castle's guns. The next day, the army gathered muskets for the Highlanders and supplies from Edinburgh. The prince planned to lead the troops in a battle against Sir John Cope's forces. The Highland chiefs objected, fearing ruin if anything happened to the prince. The army marched towards the enemy, with only one old cannon as a symbol. The two armies faced each other near Carberry Hill. The Highlanders were eager for battle, but the prince's generals advised against attacking. Instead, Lord Nairn was sent to block the English from retreating. During the night, a path was discovered to bypass the marsh, and the troops moved towards firm ground. The English were alerted, and both sides prepared for battle as day broke.|"['1.

As the sun rose, the mist cleared, revealing two armies standing face to face. The Macdonalds held the honored position on the Highland right, alongside the Camerons and Stuarts. Prince Charles stood close behind with the second line. The Highlanders prayed, then charged forward as the pipers signaled. The Camerons and Stuarts targeted the cannons on the left, manned by seamen from Cope's fleet who fled in panic. Colonel Gardiner led his dragoons to counter, but the Highlanders overpowered them. The Macdonalds captured guns and scattered the enemy. The English infantry stood firm but was overwhelmed by the Highlanders' fierce attack. Prince Charles showed mercy to the defeated, treating prisoners kindly. The English dragoons fled, facing disgraceful disorder. The Highlanders claimed the spoils and departed, weakening the army. Prince Charles's plan for an instant advance was opposed, but it might have succeeded. England struggled to gather troops to counter the rebellion.|"['1.

King Louis initially seemed supportive of Prince Charles' cause. However, his insincerity led to delays, causing missed opportunities to help the prince's family gain the English throne. Meanwhile, Prince Charles showed restraint in victory, refusing to celebrate the losses of his father's opponents. Despite being in control of most of Scotland, he chose not to attack Edinburgh Castle, showing compassion even towards his enemies. His refusal to use threats for prisoner exchanges led to discontent among his followers. The delay in uniting with other chiefs allowed English troops to arrive, hindering the prince's progress. Despite the setbacks, Prince Charles won the hearts of his troops with his kindness and consideration. Ronald was tasked with collecting funds from Glasgow and assessing war supplies, facing a mixed reception in the city.|"[""1.

Before receiving a letter from Paris, news of your escape had already reached us through the city constables. They shared how you leaped overboard, got pulled into a boat, and vanished. People laughed at them, but your letter revealed that Malcolm aided your escape, leading to a shipwreck on the French coast. However, since then, we've heard nothing. Malcolm expressed his intent to partake in the venture, mentioning that they were famished upon arrival. Elspeth provided food, and they dined as Ronald recounted his journey.

""That's more than I expected. Now, Leslie, I have an important task for you.

On December 1st, Prince Charles led his army across the Mersey River, wading through waist-deep water near Stockport. The other division crossed at Cheadle on a makeshift bridge, and the two groups met at Macclesfield. Lord George Murray cleverly misled the Duke of Cumberland by maneuvering his forces. While the Duke pushed forward, thinking the prince's army was heading towards Wales, Lord George Murray diverted towards Ashborne. The prince's army, evading Cumberland, arrived at Derby, much closer to London. Despite the prince's enthusiasm about nearing the capital, his officers advised an immediate retreat to Scotland. After a long debate, the prince reluctantly agreed to retreat, disappointing his soldiers who were eager for battle but outnumbered by enemy forces.|"['1.

Prince Charles lacked the ability to govern effectively. His belief in absolute royal power, like his ancestors, would have caused discontent among even the most loyal Stuart supporters. Unaware of this, he rode in silence during the retreat from Derby, abandoning his usual jovial demeanor. The Highlanders, losing discipline, pillaged villages, leading to retaliation from the locals. Despite warm receptions earlier, the army faced opposition in Manchester, angering the prince, who fined the city. The march continued with Highlanders seizing horses, racing towards the border. Duke of Cumberland pursued, engaging Lord George Murray's rear guard. In a moonlit clash, the Highlanders defeated the English, prompting a plea for reinforcement. Despite the victory, the Highlanders retreated, facing a siege in Carlisle. The Duke's forces halted further pursuit, leaving the Highlanders to face the consequences.|"[""1.

A quarter of an hour later, those aboard heard voices on shore, followed by oars splashing as a boat returned. Ronald, wearing the captain's cap, stood at the gangway with a lantern. Two men climbed aboard, carrying a figure followed by others. As the last person reached the deck, Ronald raised the lantern, revealing eight armed men. A scuffle ensued as the guards tried to reclaim the prince, but Ronald's men subdued them without gunfire. The citizens involved were also bound. The prince, bewildered by the ordeal, was escorted to safety by Malcolm and Ronald. They explained they had thwarted a plot to sell him to the English and decided to handle it discreetly.

While the prince talked to the men, Malcolm left and freed the captain. He demanded the money the captain took for transporting them. Malcolm instructed the captain to set sail immediately after they left the ship and not return to Glasgow for a week, warning him of severe consequences if he disobeyed. The prince and his rescuers rowed to shore unnoticed. The prince later thanked Ronald and Malcolm in private for saving him. The incident remained a secret, known only to a few close advisers. They decided to keep it quiet to avoid encouraging further attempts. After resting in Glasgow, Prince Charles moved to Stirling with a large army. The siege of Stirling began, but progress was slow. Meanwhile, the Duke of Cumberland returned to guard England's southern coasts. General Hawley led the English army to Falkirk to confront the rebels. Charles, with a smaller force, outmaneuvered the English at Bannockburn. The English army, caught off guard, struggled to regroup.|"['1.

The battle at Falkirk began with Ligonier leading a cavalry charge against the Highland right. The Macdonald clansmen, following Lord George Murray's command, unleashed a devastating volley on the dragoons, causing many to fall. While some English regiments fled, Cobham's regiment fought valiantly. The Highlanders, unstoppable and beyond control, charged with broadswords, overwhelming the English. Despite General Hawley's attempts to rally his troops, the English center crumbled. On the right, the English held their ground, preventing the Highlanders from crossing a ravine. Prince Charles led a force against the remaining English regiments, forcing them to retreat. The Highlanders, unaware of their victory's extent, hesitated to pursue, allowing the English to retreat with heavy losses. The victory at Falkirk, marred by dissension among Scottish officers, brought little benefit to Prince Charles.|"['1.

Charles, nearing Inverness, faced a toughly fortified town held by Lord Loudon. The prince, halting at Moy Castle, received a warning of an imminent attack. Ronald, with Malcolm, devised a plan to save the prince by creating a false impression of a large army.

Malcolm and Ronald were on the run, seeking refuge from the authorities. They decided to avoid Glasgow due to the high risk of being recognized. Malcolm's injured shoulder also posed a challenge, making it necessary to wait until he fully recovered. They debated whether to head to the isles, but feared the intense search for Prince Charles would put them in danger. Instead, they planned to live in Edinburgh for safety. With only fifty pounds, they aimed to survive by fishing and foraging. The duo sought shelter with a shepherd, who warned them of the scarcity of food due to many fugitives in the hills.
