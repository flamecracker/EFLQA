Mr. Brown taught Bunny how to control the electric train with a switch. The train, led by a small steel and tin locomotive, had an electric motor powered by dry battery cells. Bunny placed his large Teddy bear on the train, and after a little push, the train circled smoothly. Bunny played with his toy train while Sue imagined her bear visiting Aunt Lu's city home. Later that night, the tent shook, startling Bunny and Sue. Mr. Brown investigated, finding a cow with crooked horns. After leading the cow away, the family settled back in for the night.

Bunny was busy setting up his toy train track in a circle while Sue made a cozy spot for her Teddy bear to rest, showing it the woods with big trees and low bushes. Bunny connected the batteries and set the electric locomotive in motion. Tired of the circular track, he extended it in a straight line. Unfortunately, the fast-moving engine missed the curve, jumped off the rails, and headed downhill towards the lake. Without hesitation, Bunny chased after it, knowing his father warned about the engine's sensitivity to water. He rolled down the steep hill, aiming to save his train from sinking.

On the steep hill leading to the lake, Bunny found himself rolling on rough gravel and stones, chasing after his toy train. The toy locomotive, lacking electricity, relied on the current from the batteries to power its wheels and gears. As Bunny tumbled downhill, he watched his train nearly reach the water's edge before a man, not the hermit from the nearby cabin, rescued it. Bunny, recognizing the man as an Indian from the reservation, communicated that the train needed tracks and electricity to run. The Indian, named Eagle Feather, showed interest in a toy bear Sue had, finding it more fascinating than the train.

Mr. Wright carefully cut a hole in the trunk to rescue Sue. After Sue was freed, they decided to leave the hole for safety. Mrs. Preston suggested they play on the enclosed porch instead. The children thanked Mrs. Preston and left for home. At the camp, Bunny and Sue discovered a situation with Tom and Mr. Bixby, but Sue's father assured that Tom wouldn't be going with Mr. Bixby despite Tom's reluctance.|"[""Question 1: Where was Rose's pretend house located?\nA) In the basement\nB) In the attic\nC) In the backyard\nD) In the living room\nE) In the kitchen"", ""Question 2: What material was Sue's house made of?\nA) Bricks\nB) Small trunks\nC) Cardboard\nD) Sticks\nE) Legos"", 'Question 3: Who did the children call for help when Sue got stuck in one of the trunks?\nA) Mrs. Preston\nB) Mr. Wright\nC) Mr. Bixby\nD) Tom\nE) Bunny', 'Question 4: What did Mr. Wright do to rescue Sue from the trunk?\nA) Pulled her out forcefully\nB) Used a magic spell\nC) Cut a hole in the trunk\nD) Pushed her deeper into the trunk\nE) Called for backup', 'Question 5: Why did they decide to leave the hole in the trunk?\nA) For ventilation\nB) For decoration\nC) For Sue to climb in and out easily\nD) For safety\nE) For hiding things inside', 'Question 6: Where did Mrs. Preston suggest the children play instead of the attic?\nA) In the basement\nB) In the backyard\nC) On the enclosed porch\nD) In the living room\nE) In the kitchen']"|['B) In the attic', 'B) Small trunks', 'B) Mr. Wright', 'C) Cut a hole in the trunk', 'D) For safety', 'C) On the enclosed porch']
Sue excitedly shared her idea with Mr. Bixby about making a door for Splash, their dog, to close during rain. Meanwhile, Mr. Brown defended Tom's work ethic, mentioning that part of his wages goes to the poorhouse for his board in winter. Tom, overhearing, complained about his meals at Mr. Brown's cabin. Mr. Bixby inquired about Tom's claim of being hurt by needles, which turned out to be a harmless elbow bump. Despite the discussions, plans were made for Tom to help dig potatoes the next day. Bunny and Sue, determined to protect their friend, planned to hide in a cave if the hermit tried to take Tom away. Later, Bunny and Sue went to play by the lake, looking forward to rowing with Tom.|"['1.

Tom rowed the children up the creek, surrounded by the green arch of trees. The only sounds were the dripping waters from his oars and the calls of woodland birds. Suddenly, Bunny caught a fish that splashed back into the water after wriggling off the hook. Determined, Bunny caught a sunfish with pretty colors. Tom, wet and muddy from a slip, continued gathering lilies. He even found a mud turtle for Bunny. Tom decided to swim to clean up and dry off. Later, the speaker discussed stolen toys and a missing horse. Tom was found crying near the lake, claiming Bixby made him hold shiny balls that pricked him. Despite Bixby's rights, they planned to investigate further.|"['1.

The group was astonished by what they discovered. Bunny's toy engine and Sue's Teddy bear were on a table in front of Bixby, the hermit. However, the bear was damaged, with wires connected to Bunny's electric locomotive and batteries. At the end of the wires were shiny balls. Mr. Brown urged some to guard the door, but Bixby stayed put. As they entered, Mr. Brown warned not to touch the setup, as Bixby had rigged the batteries to give electric shocks. Bixby confessed to his misdeeds, explaining how he used to treat people with electricity but turned to trickery after personal losses. He apologized for his actions and the harm caused to Bunny and Sue's toys.|"[""1.
