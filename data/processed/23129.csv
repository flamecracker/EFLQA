In the vast wilderness of the Hudson's Bay territory, there is a stark absence of towns or villages, with only a few outposts from the Hudson's Bay Company scattered across the land. The population consists mainly of less than ten thousand Company employees and indigenous tribes surviving by hunting and facing starvation for a significant part of the year. The landscape varies from rocky hills and valleys to barren grounds with scant vegetation, primarily dwarf birches and spruces. Lakes dot the region, providing water and fish, sustaining creatures like caribou, musk-ox, wolves, bears, and various predators. The land is also inhabited by musk-rats, wolverines, polar hares, Arctic foxes, lemmings, weasels, otters, and birds like ospreys and eagles, forming a delicate ecosystem in this wild expanse.|"[""1.

"""Come here, Lucien!"" called Francois to his brother, ""Forget about your plants and tell us about these swans. Look, there goes another one! What a magnificent bird! I wish I could shoot it with my buck-shot."" The swan had been feeding near the wild rice when it noticed the canoe and raised its head, ready to take flight. Its graceful and majestic appearance fascinated the travelers. As the canoe approached, Francois hoped to get closer for a shot, urging his companions to paddle faster. The swan, confident in its swimming abilities, stayed calm, knowing it could outpace the canoe. Despite the efforts of the voyagers, the swan's combination of using the current, its feet as paddles, and the wind to sail, allowed it to effortlessly glide away. This incident made Francois believe that swans, like other birds, think and reason, contrary to the notion of mere instinct."|"['1.

The swan being chased by the voyageurs seemed to think, reason, and calculate its moves. It cleverly widened the gap between itself and the pursuers. However, the voyageurs noticed a bend in the river ahead where the wind would no longer be in the swan's favor. This renewed their hope of catching up to the swan. As they approached, the swan slowed down, preparing for flight. The swan's majestic grace began to fade as it struggled to maintain its speed. Suddenly, the swan dove underwater in terror upon hearing the call of a white-headed eagle. The eagle appeared, signaling danger for the swan. The chase ended as the swan disappeared beneath the water, leaving the voyageurs in awe of nature's wild ways.|"['1.

Bewick's swan, the smallest of American swans, is named after the naturalist Bewick. It measures about fifty-two inches long and weighs only fourteen pounds, unlike the hooper, which is over twenty pounds, and the trumpeter, which can weigh up to thirty pounds. Bewick's swan is often mistaken for the hooper due to their similar colors. The three species can be distinguished by the number of tail feathers they have. The smallest species nests in the Arctic Sea on islands, with nests made of peat-moss and large dimensions. The geographical distribution of these species varies across the Pacific coast, the interior parts, and the eastern coasts of America. The swans are hunted for profit, with the trumpeter swans being the most numerous and sought after. They are a valuable commodity, with thousands of skins exported annually.|"[""1.

They returned to the campfire with a piece of bark, slightly curved and blackened with charcoal. They fastened a stake to one end and set it upright in the canoe to create a screen. Norman then went to gather resinous knots from a fallen pitch-pine tree. He collected the knots, prepared the canoe with a birch-bark screen, and placed dry pine-knots in a frying pan for a quick fire. Ready for their hunt, they sat in the canoe, chatting and waiting for nightfall to begin their journey downstream.

Night fell as Norman had foreseen, dark as pitch. The group embarked on a canoe trip downstream. Norman, at the bow, lit a torch of pine-knots. Francois held his double-barrel loaded with buck-shot, used for swans. Basil sat close with his rifle, while Lucien, the peace-loving brother, guided the canoe. The torch cast a red glow over the river, illuminating the banks. Ahead, the torch's light revealed the river's surface, aiding the hunt for swans. Behind, darkness shrouded the canoe, concealing its occupants. The plan was clear - the light would attract curious swans, making them visible for a shot.

His cousins could easily believe the swans might act in a similar manner to the deer they had hunted by torchlight in Louisiana. The creatures, fascinated by the torch, would stand still, allowing for an easy shot. As they rounded a bend in the river, three large white objects appeared - swans. With Basil taking the first shot and Francois following, they successfully hunted seven swans. The canoe was filled to the brim with their spoils, but the hunters were not yet satisfied. Continuing down the river, they encountered more swans. Despite the success, a loud rushing sound ahead startled them.

In the midst of uncertainty, the canoe came to a halt, and the voyageurs listened intently. The noise of rushing water, resembling the roar of rapids or a waterfall, seemed nearby. After careful consideration, they concluded that the sound was not from the Red River but from a tributary on the right. Convinced of this, they resumed their journey cautiously. As they drew closer, they spotted a rapid current merging into the Red River from the right bank, indicating a cascade nearby. Approaching the cascade, they encountered a flock of swans, a rare sight. The hunters prepared to shoot, but as they focused on the swans, a new sound of rushing water ahead alarmed them.

With a clear purpose, all rowed hard, but the swift current swiftly pulled the light boat downward. Despite their efforts, the canoe raced over the rapids. The strong current pushed the boat towards a massive boulder in the middle of the channel. The canoe crashed against the rock, causing it to capsize and sink. The voyagers managed to save only their guns, knives, and some supplies. Basil, quick to act, saved an axe. The group found themselves stranded on a small rock in the river, with only the clothes on their backs and the items they had salvaged. They watched helplessly as their canoe and belongings disappeared into the darkness. In the wilderness, miles away from civilization, they faced a daunting journey on foot through challenging terrain to reach safety.|['1.

None of the young explorers were willing to give in to hopelessness. Each of them had faced even greater dangers in the past. Once they realized their boat was wrecked and their supplies lost, they didn't lose heart. Instead, they focused on how to handle the situation. That night, they were stuck on the rock, surrounded by swift rapids and sharp rocks. Crossing in the dark was too risky. So, they settled in for the night, huddling together to keep warm. Despite the chilly weather near Lake Winnipeg, they stayed awake, occasionally dozing off due to fatigue. They hardly spoke as the noise of the rapids made conversation difficult. The climate differences between coasts were discussed, noting that winds and Earth's rotation influence weather. The lack of scientific exploration due to societal struggles was also pondered upon, emphasizing the importance of understanding natural phenomena.|['1.

The citizens of the United States are still on the path to complete freedom, shedding the remnants of past oppressions and prejudices. Despite this, their progress is evident. Knowledge is advancing rapidly, especially in meteorology, where it is becoming a precise science. The winds are now being meticulously studied by experts like Maury. The climate of American regions, far from the coasts, is characterized by extreme variations from cold to tropical heat. A group of travelers faced a challenging river crossing. They strategized to reach the distant riverbank, opting for the less aggressive current.

All four boys worked together to create a long rope made of buckskin strips. Basil, skilled in lasso throwing, used the rope to cross a dangerous river. His friends followed, securing themselves with loops around their waists. They cheered as each successfully made it across. However, a new challenge arose as they realized the rope was now stuck on the other side. They needed to release it to continue their journey. With no way to retrieve the rope, they faced a dilemma. Another treacherous river lay ahead, and swimming was not an option. Stuck on a small rock, they pondered their next move, realizing they needed a solution to release the rope and safely cross the next rapid.|"['1.

Basil signaled his companions to crouch down, minimizing their presence. He readied his rifle, carefully unwrapping it from the deer's bladder. Taking aim, he fired at a rope tied to a distant rock. The bullet struck true, causing the rope to fray. Norman followed suit, further weakening the rope. With Francois' help, they dislodged the rope, allowing them to safely cross the river. Stranded in the wilderness without supplies, they relied on their guns for food. Despite the challenges ahead, they were relieved to have crossed the river and escaped immediate danger.|"['1.

"After arriving at the shore, the group felt the pangs of hunger after going without food for a long time. All four were ravenous. They scanned the trees and bushes, hoping to spot an animal for breakfast. They were open to anything, whether a bird or a quadruped, as long as it was big enough to satisfy their hunger. Despite the promising appearance of the woods with large trees and edible plants, they couldn't find any game. Lucien and Francois stayed behind to start a fire while Basil and Norman ventured out to hunt. Norman returned with an antelope, known as ""cabree"" by the voyageurs and ""goat"" by fur-traders. Norman shared how he used a clever trick to get close enough to shoot the antelope, which he brought back to camp for breakfast."|['1.

By now, Lucien and Francois had a blazing fire from pine-knots, drying off in their wet leggings. Norman joined, and they helped butcher the antelope. The skin was quickly removed, and the venison was cooked over the fire. They missed Basil's presence but assumed he was hunting. As time passed, worry grew. They decided to search for him. Norman went into the woods, while Lucien and Francois, with Marengo the dog, followed the riverbank. Norman returned empty-handed, unable to find Basil. Fear crept in; they imagined various dangers he might have encountered. As night fell, they sat by the fire, anxious and sorrowful. Unable to sleep, they discussed Basil's fate.

It was close to midnight, and the group was gathered quietly by the fire when Marengo suddenly stood up and barked loudly. Soon after, a sharp whistle was heard from the woods. Basil emerged from the darkness, carrying a bag of grouse and buffalo tongues. He wasted no time in suggesting they cook the food. Despite having eaten earlier, the group eagerly joined in. Basil shared his adventure of hunting buffaloes and the peculiar dance of the ruffed grouse he had witnessed. The birds performed a mesmerizing ritual, captivating Basil's attention before he decided to hunt them.

Basil observed a challenging display between two game-cocks, each mirroring the other's aggressive postures before engaging in a fierce fight. Hunger prompted Basil to take aim at an old cock drumming on a rock, swiftly taking it down. As he prepared to fire at the remaining birds perched on a spruce tree, Basil strategically targeted the lower branches to prevent the others from fleeing. After successfully downing several more birds, Basil realized he was depleting valuable ammunition and ceased further shots. Upon investigating the birds' roost, Basil discovered a lasso left behind by previous campers. Intrigued, he decided to keep the lasso, coiling it across his shoulders for safekeeping. However, a startling sight of two battling buffalo bulls in the distance diverted Basil's attention, hinting at the ongoing struggles of nature beyond the woods.|"['1.

Basil's story was suddenly interrupted by a strange incident in the woods. Mysterious noises had been heard, resembling a dog's bark, a person's gurgling, and a dreadful shriek followed by an odd laugh. These sounds were terrifying for many but not for the young voyagers who recognized them as the calls of a great horned-owl. As Basil continued his tale, the owl appeared near the campfire, displaying strange movements and sounds that amused the group. When the owl tried to snatch a grouse, Marengo, the dog, had a tussle with it before finally overcoming the bird.

Basil swiftly shot one of the bison-bulls for its meat, aiming true for the heart. The other bull, unaware of Basil, charged and knocked the wounded one over. Startled to see his rival motionless, the remaining bull turned towards Basil, thinking he had won. As Basil reloaded, the bull charged him. Basil's shot only enraged the bull more, forcing Basil to dodge and run towards a nearby tree.

My next plan was to shoot the bull from my tree perch. As I loaded my gun, he kept circling the tree, attacking it with his horns and bellowing loudly. The tree shook so much that I worried it might fall. As I tried to cap the gun, I realized the cap-box was on the ground. Unable to retrieve it, I couldn't shoot. Then, a new idea struck me - to lasso the bull. I quickly tied one end to the tree and threw the loop over the bull's head. With a strong pull, I lassoed him, causing him to struggle.

"Basil had finished his day's adventures and shared the tale with his companions. They added more wood to the fire, ensuring it would last through the night since they lacked blankets.

The young fur-trader agreed to the plan of building a boat from the trees around them. He explained that it would take some time to find the right timber and construct the boat, but he was confident they could do it. He pointed out three types of trees they needed, with two visible nearby and the third likely in the hills they had seen earlier. One of the trees, the canoe-birch, caught the attention of the three Southerners. This tree, known for its bark used to make canoes, bowls, and more by Native Americans, stood out with its heart-shaped leaves, dark-green color, and shiny white bark. The tree's wood was also valuable for fuel and furniture. Besides the canoe-birch, other birch species like the white birch, cherry-birch, and yellow birch were found in North America, each with unique qualities and uses.|"[""1.

"In North America, various species of birch trees grow, including the ""red birch,"" named for its reddish bark. This tree can reach heights of seventy feet with thin, drooping branches. The ""dwarf birch"" is a shrub-like species, only growing to about eighteen inches in height, found in cold or mountainous regions. Apart from birches, there are also cone-bearing trees like pines, cypresses, and yews. The pine tribe includes pine, spruce, fir, and larch trees, while the cypress tribe consists of cypress, cedar, arbor-vitae, and juniper trees. The yew tribe has fewer species, including yews and hemlocks. Pine trees are abundant in North America, with many new species discovered in recent explorations. Some pine trees, like the ""Lambert pine"" in Oregon and California, can grow up to three hundred feet tall with cones as long as eighteen inches. The ""white pine"" is another significant species, providing a vast amount of timber annually but leading to deforestation in areas like New York."|['1.

"While waiting for the wood to dry, paddles were crafted, and Norman, along with the others, readied what he humorously dubbed his ""dock"" and ""shipyard."" It was essentially a lengthy mound of earth, resembling a freshly dug grave but three times longer. The top was flat and leveled with soil to ensure smoothness. Norman began by untying the timber bundle and arranging them in the proper order. With the help of Francois, he securely fastened the timbers to the bottom plank using watap cords. Stones were placed on the kelson to stabilize it on the earthen mound. The gunwale was then attached to the ribs meticulously, with cross-pieces added for support. The bark pieces were sewn onto the ribs, bottom plank, and gunwale to form the hull. The final step involved sealing the seams with a mixture of boiled epinette gum and grease.

Lake Winnipeg is unique for its central location on the North American continent, making it a hub for canoe navigation. From this point, travelers can reach Hudson's Bay to the north-east, the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Gulf of Mexico to the south, the Pacific Ocean to the west, and the Polar Sea to the north and north-west. These routes span over three thousand miles each, showcasing Lake Winnipeg's strategic position. Norman, a knowledgeable guide, shared these insights while paddling along the shore. He understood the routes, portages, and distances from personal experience and stories passed down by traders and trappers. Lucien, a naturalist, added geological explanations, linking the lake's formation to rock erosion. As they journeyed westward along the lake's edge, they camped each night, ensuring safety from sudden winds and high waves.|"['1.

Francois asked Luce to share his knowledge about the elk. Norman mentioned that it might be futile to pursue them in the open as they would shy away before getting close enough. Norman predicted that the elk might come closer to the bushes soon and head to the lake to drink by night. The elk is known by various names like elk, stag, red deer, and wapiti due to different regions and authors. The name wapiti is favored by many naturalists. Lucien described the wapiti as the most majestic deer, larger and stronger than the European stag. The wapiti gives birth to fawns in the spring, and only males have horns that grow and shed annually. During summer, the antlers are soft and covered in velvet, turning hard in autumn for the rutting season. During this time, males engage in fierce battles, sometimes locking antlers until death or predation.|"['1.

The wapiti, also known as elk, emit distinct sounds that can be heard from afar, helping hunters locate them. During mating season, the male elks produce noises akin to a donkey's braying, which can be unpleasant to hear. These majestic creatures move in small groups, typically not exceeding fifty members. When undisturbed, they are approachable; however, they become cautious in areas with hunting activity. Wounded male elks can turn aggressive, posing a threat to hunters with their horns and hooves. While they are usually hunted like other deer, indigenous people sometimes capture them while swimming across lakes or rivers. The wapiti used to range widely in North America but now inhabit remote mountainous regions due to human settlements. They are excellent swimmers and are more common in Canada, spanning across the continent to the Pacific Ocean. The elk are not found in tropical regions but thrive in temperate zones.|['1.

The hunters were focused on the buck, unaware of the wolves. They surrounded the thicket, waiting for the wapiti to appear. The willows concealed the buck well. Suddenly, the wolverene attacked the wapiti, causing chaos. The wapiti leaped into the lake to escape. The wolverene struggled in the water and was shot by the hunters. The buck swam towards the lake's center, as the hunters reloaded, hoping he would return. Instead, the buck found a shallow area and stood half out of the water.

Basil and Norman quickly headed towards the canoe, and in a short while, they had it afloat, gliding through the water. The buck realized his predicament and turned to face them, his antlers poised for defense. However, before he could make a move, Norman halted the canoe, allowing Basil to take aim with his rifle. The shot rang out, and the wapiti collapsed into the water, lifeless. They towed the wapiti back to shore, discovering an old wound from an arrow lodged in its thigh. The voyageurs were surprised to find that the wapiti had been previously injured by Indians. The skin of the wapiti was carefully removed for drying, as they were in need of additional bedding. The elk's meat was also prepared for preservation, although it was not their preferred choice due to its dry texture.

The camp was nestled under a beautiful tree known as the tacamahac or balsam poplar (_Populus balsamifera_). This tree is a magnificent specimen native to America, reaching heights of up to one hundred and fifty feet in favorable conditions. Its oval leaves start as a rich yellow before turning a vibrant green, while its large yellow buds emit a delightful fragrance, giving the tree its name. As the sun began to set on that Saturday evening, the travelers relaxed near a red cedar fire, enveloped by the sweet scents of burning wood and the balsam tree. The woods came alive with the calls of various birds like the jay, cardinal grosbeak, and ivory-billed woodpecker, while an osprey and bald eagles soared overhead.

The naturalist confidently stated that sturgeons, toothless fish that feed on soft substances at the bottom, are found in northern temperate waters globally. However, they are not present in warmer climates. Francois followed his brother's advice and caught a three-foot sturgeon, a species called _Acipenser carbonarius_. Meanwhile, Lucien gathered wild rice (_Zizania aquatica_) and bulbs of wild leek (_Allium tricoccum_) to enrich their meal. As Lucien explored further, he encountered the cow parsnip (_Heracleum lanatum_), a plant with tall stems and white flowers, known for its use in making musical instruments and deer calls among Native Americans. Norman joined Lucien, intrigued by the discovery. Their foraging expedition promised a bountiful dinner, combining nature's offerings with practical botany lessons.|"[""1.

"There are two types of a plant known as Labrador tea, the ""narrow-leafed"" and ""broad-leafed,"" with the former being preferred for making tea. However, the pretty white flowers of the plant are even better for this purpose than the leaves. Lucien and Norman gathered these flowers. The flowers need to be dried before making the tea, which can be quickly done over a fire. Norman parched them on heated stones. Meanwhile, Basil and Francois got sugar-water, Lucien cleaned his soup-kettle, made the stones hot again, and prepared the beverage. It was served in a tin cup, and all drank it. Norman liked Labrador tea, but Francois and Lucien found its rhubarb-like flavor less appealing. Despite this, they all agreed it lifted their spirits. Their meals weren't always luxurious; sometimes, they only had dried venison and water. Occasionally, they had wild game like ducks or geese. After coasting the lake for three weeks, they reached the Saskatchewan River, heading west. At the Grand Rapids, they had to carry their supplies for three miles. The Saskatchewan River is one of the largest in America, running 1600 miles from the Rocky Mountains to Hudson's Bay. The area along its banks is initially well-wooded, with dry sandy prairies farther up. Despite these challenges, their journey continued towards Cumberland House, planning to turn north again."|"['1.

The camp was set at the base of a somewhat steep hill, near the river's banks. A higher hill stood opposite, visible to the travelers by their fire. Along its slope, they saw small mounds close together, each about a foot tall with a truncated cone shape. The naturalist identified them as a different species from prairie-dogs, likely marmots. North America boasts a rich variety of marmot species, with about twenty different kinds. The naturalist criticized the complexity added by dividing them into multiple genera based on minor differences. He argued for simplifying the study by focusing on their shared characteristics. The hunter agreed, finding the use of complex names unnecessary and preferring a more straightforward approach to understanding these creatures.|['1.

"""Basil agreed with Lucien about the valuable knowledge gained from early explorers like Hearne, who ventured to the Arctic Sea in 1771. Hearne's detailed account of the region's inhabitants and natural history surpassed the works of later closet-naturalists. Lucien expressed frustration at how some naturalists plagiarized Hearne's findings or added very little new information. Transitioning to marmots, Lucien described them as a link between squirrels and rabbits. He explained how different marmot species varied in size, habits, and diet, with some storing food in cheek-pouches. Contrary to popular belief, marmots do not hoard food for winter but enter a state of torpor, surviving without eating until spring. This adaptation showcases how nature equips animals to endure harsh winters and thrive when warmer seasons arrive."""|"['1.

The marmots live in various communities. Some reside in large groups like prairie-dogs, while others prefer smaller tribes or a solitary life in pairs or families. Most marmots are burrowing animals, but some are content with a cleft in rocks or holes among stones. They are cautious creatures, often sending sentries to watch while others feed. The sentries warn of danger with cries like 'seek-seek' or barking. The marmots have different species with distinct habits and sounds. The marmots are shy and eaters of both Indians and hunters. They are captured by various methods, like pouring water into their burrows or shooting them. The tawny marmots and leopard-marmots are two distinct species living in the same settlement. The leopard-marmots have smaller burrow entrances and deeper holes than the tawny marmots. Their different burrow structures explain why the tawny marmots appear earlier in spring than the leopard-marmots.|['1.

While the boys were observing the marmots playing on the hillside, they noticed several fierce battles among them. The males of each kind were engaged in intense combat, resembling little cats, with leopards showing more aggression. The boys saw that the marmots frequently grabbed each other's tails, resulting in some having shorter tails from battles. Meanwhile, a strange animal, identified as an American badger, was spotted crawling around the hill. The badger, smaller and lighter than its European counterpart, preys on small animals and enlarges marmot burrows to access them. The badger's attempt to surprise the marmots was thwarted by a burrowing owl, causing the marmots to flee to safety in their burrows.|"['1.

The badger, realizing hiding was useless, leaped forward in pursuit of the marmots, but they had already escaped into their burrows. The badger selected a burrow and began digging like a terrier. The boys, led by Norman, tried to pull the badger out, but failed. Francois shot the badger, causing it to retreat. A struggle with Marengo, the bloodhound, ensued, ending in the badger's death. A large hawk, identified by Lucien as a marsh-hawk, circled above, hunting for snakes. The hawk caught a green snake and flew off. Lucien explained the hunting techniques of hawks and falcons to his friends, illustrating how each bird's structure suits its hunting style.

Two days after their exciting encounter with the blaireau, the young travelers reached Cumberland House, a renowned post of the Hudson's Bay Company. The head official, a friend of Norman's father, warmly welcomed the youths, providing them with the best hospitality the place could offer. Eager to finish their journey before winter's arrival, when traveling by canoe would be impossible due to frozen lakes and rivers, they swiftly departed. Winter in the northern regions meant deep snow covering the earth, making travel only possible with snowshoes or dog-drawn sledges. The travelers understood the challenges that lay ahead and quickly prepared for the next leg of their journey, knowing they had to navigate through various landscapes to reach the waters of the Mackenzie River. The journey involved making several portages and navigating through different lakes and rivers, each presenting its own set of challenges and rewards.|['1.

"Ducks are fascinating birds, and one particular species that our travelers were eager to encounter was the renowned ""canvass-back."" This duck is highly esteemed for its delectable flesh, believed by many to surpass all other birds in flavor. The canvass-back is not a large duck, usually weighing around three pounds, with distinctive red or chestnut-colored heads and shiny black breasts. They are often found in areas where a specific type of aquatic plant called Valisneria grows. These ducks feed almost exclusively on the succulent roots of this plant, giving their meat a unique taste. The Valisneria plant grows in shallow, slow-moving waters, and the ducks are expert at diving to pluck up the roots. The birds are so prized that disputes have arisen among hunters around the Chesapeake Bay over the right to shoot them. Fortunately, these disputes have been peacefully resolved by the government."|['1.

The news brought a fresh wave of excitement among the group of four friends. They were eager not only to hunt but also to feast on a delicious canvass-back duck. Knowing how wary these waterfowls were, the friends devised a plan to approach them discreetly. Norman suggested camouflaging their canoe with bushes along its sides to conceal themselves. With Francois ready in the bow armed with a double-barrel gun, they silently paddled towards the ducks. Peering through the foliage, they observed three types of ducks feeding together: canvass-backs, smaller red-heads or pochards, and widgeons. The widgeons, unable to dive for food like canvass-backs, cleverly waited to snatch the roots the larger ducks brought up. Despite occasional skirmishes, the widgeons' nimbleness always secured them the prize. This unique interaction between the duck species fascinated the friends as they watched nature's drama unfold.|"['1.

"As the canoe approached, the passengers observed some interesting behavior among the birds. They noticed the arrival of a ""trumpeter"" swan, which the ducks seemed to ignore. Lucien, Basil, and Norman were intrigued by the swan's unusual appearance and stiff movements. The swan seemed to be feeding strangely, causing the ducks to dive underwater near it. However, the ducks did not resurface after diving near the swan. Before they could discuss their observations, Francois fired his gun, distracting them. After the shot, the swan began acting even more strangely, making human-like screams and revealing itself to be an Indian in disguise. The Indian, frightened by the boys, ran off into the woods, leaving behind the swan skin and ducks he had caught.

"""The water-fowl in America are crucial in the fur territories we are exploring,"" said Lucien. ""During certain times, they provide the main source of food. These birds, like swans, geese, and ducks, migrate south when the lakes freeze in winter, returning to breed in summer. They likely choose these regions for safety during nesting and molting seasons. Their arrival marks the start of spring, celebrated by hunters. The birds are hunted by both Indians and Hudson's Bay Company employees for food. Indians often set snares in water fences to catch them. They believe in washing hands before setting snares to avoid scaring the birds. Indians also use nets, hooks, and decoys to catch the birds.

One of the most famous ducks is the eider-duck. It is valued for its soft down, used for quilts and beds. The down is obtained without harming the bird, as it is plucked from the nest. The female bird plucks down from her breast to line the nest. If the down is stolen repeatedly, the birds abandon the nest. The eider-duck is about the size of a mallard, with black and buff-white coloring. Its food consists of mollusks, and it is mainly found in Arctic regions. The wood-duck, known for nesting in trees, is considered one of the most beautiful American duck species.

As night approached and the need to find a spot for their camp arose, Lucien wrapped up his lecture. Francois was relieved when it concluded, finding it a bit long. The Elk's picturesque scenery was a popular spot for birds. The travelers spotted various types, including migratory birds that visit the fur countries in summer and those that call it home during winter. Among them were the blue bird of Wilson, the purple martin, the cardinal grosbeak, the blue jay, and the crossbill. One bird, despite its unappealing appearance and voice, caught their attention. It had a unique habit of impaling its prey on thorns. Francois shot the bird down for further examination, revealing a surprising sight - several impaled ruby-throats and other creatures neatly skewered on thorny branches.|"['1.

"Basil, Norman, and Francois were puzzled by the behavior of the creatures they saw. Lucien explained that a bird, known as the ""shrike"" or ""butcher-bird,"" placed them there after Francois shot it. Lucien clarified that the shrike does this to safeguard its prey from ground-ants and other predators. The osprey, a large bird of prey, is a fish-eater found in America. Fishermen welcome ospreys as they indicate the presence of fish. Farmers spare ospreys as they protect poultry from other birds of prey. Ospreys build large nests in dead trees using sticks, grass, and seaweed. They lay three to four eggs, which are well-guarded. Attempting to steal from an osprey nest can lead to fierce retaliation.

Ospreys are fascinating birds that have unique habits. They solely feed on fish and do not prey on birds or other animals, even when their usual food sources are scarce due to frozen lakes and rivers. Unlike other hawks, ospreys allow other birds like purple grakles to nest near them without any interference. The structure of an osprey's feet and legs is specialized for hunting fish. Their long legs with featherless knees, covered with thick scales on the soles and sharp claws, help them grip slippery prey efficiently. An interesting incident involving an osprey family was observed by a group of campers. The young ospreys, although fully grown, rely on their parents for food and care until they are forced out of the nest to learn to fend for themselves.

At this moment, the male bird swooped down and then soared back up, holding a fish in his talons. He flew towards a young bird and offered it the fish mid-air. The young one accepted it easily, then flew to a nearby tree to eat. Seeing this, the other young bird landed on the same branch to share the meal. After eating most of the fish, the birds returned to their nest where the parents greeted them excitedly. The male bird then went fishing again, diving swiftly into the water. The boys observed the bird's fishing techniques and discussed its habits. The osprey made a sudden plunge into the water, catching a fish and emerging swiftly back into the air. The boys noted the osprey's hunting skills and how it carries the fish head-first.|"['1.

Lucien was talking when suddenly a loud scream interrupted him. Everyone turned to see a white-headed eagle chasing an osprey that had caught a fish. The osprey, aware of the eagle's presence, tried to escape by flying higher. The female osprey joined the chase, trying to distract the eagle. The eagle almost caught up to the osprey carrying the fish, but the osprey dropped the fish into the water, causing the eagle to miss it. Disappointed, the eagle returned to its tree. The ospreys safely made it back to their nest after a noisy discussion. Lucien explained that eagles rely on ospreys for fish because ospreys are better at catching them underwater. Basil added that in Europe, the majority works for the benefit of a few, highlighting the impact of education and manipulation by rulers.|['1.

"About ten days' rapid travel down the Elk River brought our group to Athabasca Lake, also known as the ""Lake of the Hills."" This vast freshwater body lies between the primitive rocks of the ""Barren Grounds"" and the more fertile limestone deposit to the west. The lake stretches almost two hundred miles from west to east and is only fifteen miles wide, appearing more like a broad river in some areas due to its narrowness and numerous islands. The shores and many islands are densely forested, especially along the southern and western edges, offering beautiful views to travelers. However, the group's spirits were dampened by the illness of Lucien, a beloved member suffering from an intermittent fever. They had to pause their journey, setting up camp by the lake and taking care of Lucien, who was unable to travel. They built a small log-hut for him, prepared soothing drinks from roots and fruits, and cooked nourishing meals to help him recover. Despite the scenic surroundings, the group was worried about the approaching winter, which would make their journey more challenging and risky."|"['1.

"In late August, the group arrived at the Great Slave Lake, located at 62 degrees latitude. Days were short, and the weather turned as cold as an English winter. Nights brought slight frosts, but not enough to freeze the water. Midday heat was sometimes uncomfortable, making the cold evenings feel even chillier. To stay warm, they relied on robes and skins. The lake, long and narrow, stretched 260 miles east to west, with a width of around thirty miles. The northern shore bordered the desolate ""Barren Grounds,"" while the southern side featured limestone formations and lush forests with poplars, pines, and birches. The lake teemed with islands covered in timber and abundant wildlife. As winter approached, they decided to camp by the lake, drawn by the plentiful firewood and resources for survival."|"['1.

Norman's suggestion was met with unanimous agreement from the group. The canoe was directed towards the open waters, and after a challenging day of paddling against a headwind, they reached a small wooded island in the middle of the lake where they decided to camp for the night. The plan was to finish their journey the next day. However, when they woke up the next morning, they were shocked to see that the lake had frozen over during the night. The ice was thin but too fragile to support their weight, leaving them stranded on the island. As days passed, their food supplies dwindled, and their situation grew dire. With no game on the island and no way to break through the ice with their canoe, they were faced with the looming threat of starvation. Desperate for a solution, Norman suggested making a fishing net out of caribou skins to catch fish in the water. Despite the lack of a proper net, the group worked together to fashion one out of the available materials, hoping it would provide them with a lifeline in their time of need.|"[""1.

Norman, Basil, and Lucien, three friends from a warm country, were amazed by ice fishing. Norman, experienced in this, led the way. He ventured onto the ice, cut holes, and slid a net under it to catch fish. The friends waited anxiously by the fire. After a long wait, they checked the net. Excitement filled the air as they pulled it up. Cheers erupted as they caught two big trout. The friends enjoyed a delicious meal, savoring the fresh catch. Norman received praise for his skills.

The group of young backwoodsmen felt relieved after catching five fish, totaling twenty pounds. This successful haul would sustain them for a while on the islet. However, a severe frost that night froze the lake, allowing them to cross to the mainland on the thick ice. They quickly set up camp and built a log-hut using their axe skills. To insulate the cabin, they collected scented grass that filled the air with a pleasant fragrance when burned. They survived on fish caught in the net, including white fish, blue fish, trout, pike, and burbot. Despite the unsavory taste of burbot, Marengo enjoyed feasting on it. Their resourcefulness and teamwork ensured their survival in the cold climate of the Hudson's Bay territory.|['1.

A fish-only diet wasn't sustainable for the group, so Basil, the hunter, set out to find game. While the others worked on the cabin, Basil wandered into the woods. He followed the lake's edge and discovered a ridge with pine trees resembling Scotch firs. As he ventured forward, he noticed bark scattered on the ground, and strange tracks that seemed to be from a child. Startled by a child-like cry, he looked up to find a peculiar animal, a Canada porcupine, feasting on the pine trees. Despite the temptation to shoot it, Basil decided against it to avoid scaring off larger game. Moving on, the trees thinned out, transitioning to poplar and willow trees with clear visibility. Basil continued his silent hunt, scanning the surrounding area from a low hill, observing a vast open plain bordered by the lake and sparse woods.|['1.

Basil gazed at a small group of animals near the willows' border. They were moose-deer, the largest of their kind. The male, with antlers, stood out among the female and two calves. Moose live in cold regions and feed on leaves and twigs. They struggle to reach grass due to their structure. Basil, excited to see the moose for the first time, desired to hunt one for its meat and hide. Moose-meat is tasty, and their hide is ideal for making mocassins and snow-shoes. Basil knew his campmates would welcome the change in diet. Moose are solitary creatures and are hunted by the Indians using canoes in summer and snowshoes in winter. Basil hoped to return to camp with moose meat and hide to share with his companions.|"[""1.

Approaching a moose in the early winter can be challenging due to their heightened senses. They are most alert during this season, making them difficult to hunt. Moose are keen to any movement or sound, and they can detect enemies from far away, especially if the wind is in their favor. Basil, an experienced hunter, used a feather to determine the wind direction before cautiously approaching the moose. He crawled on his hands and knees, enduring the pain and practicing patience to get within shooting range. After a half-hour of slow and careful movement, Basil finally had a clear shot at the bull moose. Despite the challenge, Basil aimed at the fore-shoulder and successfully took down the bull, proving his hunting skills and determination.|"['1.

Basil was in a dangerous situation. He found himself facing a moose, and his only chance of survival was to outmaneuver the massive animal. He spotted a nearby tree and decided to make a run for it, with the hope of reaching safety in the thick forest. With adrenaline pumping, Basil sprinted from tree to tree, narrowly escaping the moose's wrath each time. As he reached the last tree before an open space, Basil realized he had no choice but to climb up for safety. Using his hunting knife, he fashioned a makeshift spear, which he skillfully used to defend himself against the charging moose. In a daring move, Basil delivered a fatal blow to the moose, saving himself from the imminent danger. His quick thinking and resourcefulness had turned the tables, and he emerged victorious in the face of peril.|"[""1.

Basil climbed down from the tree, retrieved his rifle, and reloaded it carefully. He then returned to the moose, gagged its jaws, and removed its tongue and lips, storing them in his bag. Afterward, he made a cut near the kidneys, pulling out the bladder. Basil crafted a pipe from reed-grass, inflated the bladder, and hung it from a tree branch to deter wolves. The moose, weighing 1,500 pounds, was safeguarded by this clever trick. Basil's group broiled the moose tongue for a tasty meal. As winter arrived, they faced heavy snow and crafted snow-shoes for easier travel. These shoes, essential in Arctic regions, enable safe movement over deep snow. Without them, survival and hunting would be impossible for the Indians. The log-hut was completed just in time for the harsh winter conditions.|"['1.

In the winter, making snowshoes is like crafting a bird-snare hoop from light, tough wood, often using scrub-pine branches. These snowshoes are about 3 to 4 feet long and a foot wide, tapering to a point at the heel and toe. The frame is bent and polished, with two bars for foot support. The netting, made of deer-hide thongs, covers the frame except for the footrest area. The shoes are then fastened to the foot using straps. Different tribes have varying snowshoe shapes. Norman, with help from others, skillfully made four pairs. The group needed to stockpile meat as they only had moose meat without other food. Voyageurs need a lot of meat for energy, sometimes consuming up to eight pounds of buffalo meat daily. The group also needed to prepare warm clothing for the harsh winter ahead.|['**1.

Once the snowshoes were ready, Basil and Norman embarked on daily hunting trips, often returning at nightfall. They hunted caribou and deer, mostly the woodland variety, abundant in the area. They brought back only the best parts with the skin, as the woodland caribou's flesh is not highly regarded. On a successful day, they even managed to kill a whole herd of moose. However, as the days passed, the routine became monotonous. The extreme cold forced them to stay indoors, engaging in various activities to pass the time. The prospect of six more months in isolation began to weigh on them, and they longed for a change. After a discussion, Basil proposed they break camp and continue their journey, sparking a mix of excitement and caution among the group.|"['1.

Norman agreed with Lucien about the dangers but thought they could overcome them with caution. Overall, Norman supported the plan as he longed to return home after two years away. The group felt ambitious about the journey, seeing it as a challenge worth undertaking. They quickly prepared for the trip, having the necessary gear like snow-shoes, skin-blankets, and snow spectacles made from red cedar wood to protect their eyes. They also made pemmican, a portable food made by mixing pounded meat, fat, and sweet purple berries. Norman's pemmican was exceptional due to the addition of these berries, known by various names like shadberries or service-berries.

Before winter arrived, the travelers gathered a large amount of food by the Elk River, dried and stored for their journey. Norman used these supplies to make high-quality pemmican. They packed five heavy bags, one to pull on the sled with the tent, axe, and essentials, the rest carried by the voyageurs. After finalizing their plans, they left their hut and canoe, shouldering their gear and bags, starting their journey over the snowy landscape. They debated the route to take, Lucien suggesting following the lake shore to the Mackenzie River, while Norman advised a northwest direction to reach the Mackenzie near the River of the Mountains. Despite initial reluctance, Norman's reasoning prevailed, aiming for a more direct path to avoid the river's winding course. The group set off optimistically, unaware of the challenges ahead. Their early days were uneventful, traveling around twenty miles daily with skilled snow-shoeing and Marengo effortlessly pulling the sled. Nightly camps were set up near water sources, ensuring a comfortable journey.|['1.

After five days of travel from their log-hut, the forest began to thin out, and by nightfall, they were passing through a region with sparse clumps of timber and stunted trees. The following day, even less timber was visible, and when they stopped to camp, they could only find willows for their fire. They had reached the edge of the vast Barren Grounds, a desolate wilderness stretching across the Northern half of the American continent. This territory, similar to the Sahara in Africa, is barren and difficult to cross, posing dangers to travelers. The landscape is rocky with little vegetation, and lakes are scattered throughout. The voyageurs found themselves amidst this desolate scene, feeling the isolation and harshness of the environment. As they journeyed further, their fears grew as they realized the challenges ahead, including limited provisions and treacherous terrain.|['1.

"Wolves are fascinating creatures that can survive in various environments, even the Barren Grounds during winter. They are widely distributed across the globe, from Cape Horn to the northernmost regions explored by humans. In North America, there are different species of wolves, including the ""prairie"" or ""barking"" wolf and the ""common"" or ""large"" wolf. These wolves vary in size, color, and habits, with some unique species like the ""dusky wolf"" found in the Rocky Mountains. The differences in appearance between American and European wolves can be attributed to their habitats and surroundings. The writer believes that nature adapts wolves to their environments, explaining the variations observed in different wolf populations. Wolves come in various colors such as grey, white, brown, dusky, pied, black, yellow, red, and cream, with the grey wolf being the most common."|"['1.

In the wild, wolves of the same color may vary in size significantly. It's fascinating how large wolves can be found in one area while much smaller ones, of the same color and species, live in another region. The biggest American wolves can reach up to six feet in length, including their tail, and stand about three feet tall. They are skilled hunters preying on smaller animals like deer and foxes. Despite being cunning and cowardly like their European relatives, when hungry, they can become bolder and even attack humans, though such instances are rare. During a journey through the Barren Grounds, travelers observed large grey wolves following their trail, howling through the night. These creatures, driven by hunger, may even eat their own kind.|['1.

The boys halted, scanning the area for the elusive creature. Snow enveloped them in a vast circle, untouched and serene. Following Francois' lead, they traced a path marked by dotted lines. Soon, they stumbled upon a peculiar sight - a lone blade of grass protruding through the snow, encircled by a small depression. Tracks led to this spot, hinting at the mysterious animal's descent and ascent along the grass stalk. The boys called over Lucien and Norman, joined by their dog Marengo. Lucien identified the tracks as belonging to the tiny shrew-mouse, America's smallest quadruped. As they observed more tracks and holes around grass stalks, Norman advised patience. Eventually, a minuscule shrew-mouse emerged, captivating the group with its petite size and peculiar appearance. Their awe was interrupted by Marengo's sudden alarm, revealing a pack of wolves pillaging their supplies. The boys sprang into action, chasing the wolves to reclaim their stolen pemmican, but the cunning predators vanished over the ridge with their loot, evading capture.|"['1.

Barely any pemmican remained, only scraps gnawed by wolves scattered in the snow. The hungry travelers went to bed without supper, kept awake by hunger and despair. At daybreak, they left their tent, driven by hunger and anxiety, but found nothing for breakfast. Searching for food, they saw only snow and rocks, with no signs of life. Realizing the dire situation, they knew they might starve in the desolate region. Traveling lighter, they hoped to hunt for food but found nothing living. The third day brought extreme suffering, leading them to chew on their tent and blankets. Marengo, their trusted dog, became the focus of their hunger, despite their reluctance.

Lucien proposed a challenge to walk further, claiming he could go five more miles. Basil knew Lucien was being generous. They agreed to give Marengo a chance by reaching some distant rocks.

"Norman excitedly pointed to a rock, revealing a black, crumply substance known as ""tripe de roche,"" a type of lichen that can sustain life. Lucien and Norman recognized its value, while Basil and Francois were puzzled. Lucien explained that it was a nutritious lichen, specifically the _Gyrophora_, which had saved many from starvation. Despite not finding the tastier _Gyrophora vellea_, they were relieved to have found any. They began collecting and preparing it for consumption, but faced a challenge without firewood. Remembering Marengo's sledge, they decided to use it for a small fire. Marengo, unaware of its near use for cooking him, agreed to sacrifice the sledge for survival.

"Upon reaching the hill's summit, the group felt disappointed. The snow-covered table plain, about three hundred yards wide, displayed a uniform white with only a few dry grass heads peeking through. No living creature was in sight, making it clear that the area was deserted. Exhausted and unable to continue, they paused. Marengo, the sledge behind him, stood to the side. Basil, with a tear in his eye, urged Norman to take action. Just as Norman was about to shoot, a large bird's shadow flying over the snowy hill caught their attention. The bird, resembling an eagle but with the white plumage of a swan, was identified as the majestic ""great snowy owl"" from the Arctic.

The owl is a fascinating bird that adapts to its environment. In the Northern regions, these birds hunt during the day, even in the bright noon hours. This behavior allows them to survive in the long days of the Arctic summer. The Hudson's Bay Company territory is home to various owl species, including the large cinereous owl with a wingspan of nearly five feet. Some owls migrate south for winter, while others like the snowy owl stay to hunt ptarmigans and hares. Our travelers once watched an owl soar silently in the sky. They also encountered a hare camouflaged in the snow, with its eyes and ears barely visible. Despite the owl's cry resembling a distressed human, the travelers observed nature's wonders with curiosity and caution.|"['1.

Norman, after circling around, slowed down and stopped where the others watched intently. They knew the fate of Marengo, and possibly their own, rested on Norman's shot. Positioned strategically, Norman aimed to give the hare a path towards them for a clear shot. With his gun ready, finger on the trigger, the boys anticipated the shot. Suddenly, a bird's shadow passed, a human-like scream echoed, and the hare bolted. A snowy owl swooped down to attack the fleeing hare. In a swift move, a shot rang out, hitting the hare, then the owl. Francois emerged as the hero, ending the owl's struggle. The group found a Polar hare, large and majestic, wounded but alive.

"Once, while gazing around, Lucien spotted an intriguing sight on the snow nearby. A ring of snow, formed under a hill's shelter, encircled its base with a steep front. This front stood only a couple of feet tall, but the top was wide, blending with the hill's slope. Lucien noticed a small animal on the snowy hilltop. It was a unique mouse, the ""white-footed mouse,"" with a mahogany upper body and milky white lower half. This mouse was agile, leaping from arbutus-tree tops in search of winter berries. Lucien observed its graceful jumps, aided by its tail pressing against the snow. Lucien then noticed a weasel, the famed ermine, trailing the mouse's path with hound-like precision.

Lucien was out in the wilderness observing nature when he spotted a mouse nibbling on an arbutus plant. Little did the mouse know, it was being stalked by its natural predator, the Mustela erminea, also known as the ermine. The ermine swiftly closed in on the mouse, causing it to flee in a desperate attempt to escape. However, the ermine was quick and soon caught the mouse, ending its life with a swift bite. Lucien, witnessing this scene, felt compelled to take action against the ermine, even though it was simply following its instincts. As Lucien prepared to confront the ermine, his attention was diverted by the sight of a magnificent white fox, known as the Arctic fox, gracefully making its way through the snow. The Arctic fox, with its stunning white fur, sharp features, and cautious demeanor, captured Lucien's fascination, leading him to ponder the diverse varieties of foxes that inhabit North America.|"['1.

"The ""grey fox"" is a common species in the United States, extending into parts of Canada. Another species, the ""kit fox,"" is the smallest and fastest in prairies, even outpacing antelopes. Lucien, spotting a fox while hunting, hoped to add it to their food supply. As the fox followed an ermine trail, Lucien waited for a clear shot. The ermine, startled by the fox, tried to escape by diving into the snow. The fox, carrying the ermine, emerged from the snow and dashed away.

When Lucien first spotted a new animal, it was a wolf chasing a fox. The chase brought them close to Lucien, who watched as the wolf caught the fox. Lucien followed, hoping for a shot at the wolf. Surprisingly, as the wolf carried the fox in its jaws, it suddenly dropped dead. A shot had been fired from a distance, and Lucien saw Basil, who had shot the wolf. They found the wolf dead with the fox in its mouth and an ermine in the fox's mouth, all preyed upon each other. Lucien reflected on the laws of nature and the cycle of life and death.

Basil returned from his hunting expedition with a variety of animals, including a white hare, a lynx, and a golden eagle. He had ventured alone, while his companions Norman and Francois took different paths to increase their chances of finding game. Norman soon joined him with a deer, and Francois followed with snow-white birds. The camp was filled with a diverse array of animals, reminiscent of a menagerie. They cooked hare soup and enjoyed a warm cup of tea around the fire. Francois shared his bird adventure, including a white hawk he had never seen before. Lucien explained the differences between hawks and falcons, identifying the bird as a falcon, specifically the _Falco Islandicus_.|['1.

"Norman mentioned that the Indians refer to the bird as the ""winter bird"" or ""winterer"" because it remains in the area throughout the year, making it a common sight during winter. Traders sometimes call it the ""speckled partridge-hawk"" due to its spotted appearance. Lucien explained that the young birds are initially brown and develop spots after a year or two. It takes several years for them to acquire white plumage, with few being entirely white. The bird is identified as the jerfalcon, preying on white partridges, actually willow-grouse. Francois shared his experience of encountering both the hawk and grouse, distinguishing the willow-grouse by its stronger, less flattened bill and larger size compared to the rock-grouse. The rock and willow grouse are similar in habits, preferring snowy regions, with willow-grouse often found in wooded areas and rock-grouse in open spaces. Francois recounted an incident where he observed the hawk hunting the grouse, showcasing their unique behaviors."|"['1.

While I was lost in my thoughts, the lynx continued its calculated circling, gradually closing in on the hare, which watched intently. It reminded me of Norman's tactics to hunt the Polar hare. The lynx's cunning maneuvers surprised me, recalling the clever tricks of the Louisiana bay lynx. The lynx halted, poised to strike, and leaped at the hare. The eagle's piercing scream diverted my attention. A massive bird, likely a golden eagle, swooped down towards the lynx. The lynx, sensing danger, readied itself for the aerial assault. The eagle, with feathered legs and sharp talons, engaged the lynx, inflicting wounds but rousing its ferocity. The battle shifted to the ground, with the lynx aggressively attacking the eagle, met with fierce resistance. Feathers and fur flew as the combatants fiercely clashed, their struggle obscured by snow-spray at times.|"[""1.

I observed a conflict for a while, realizing my chance to approach unnoticed was when they were engrossed in the battle. Silently, I left the bushes, leading Marengo, and inched closer. With only one bullet, I aimed at the lynx, knowing it was edible. Surprisingly, the eagle didn't flee as one of its wings was injured. It fiercely fought Marengo. The lynx was left wounded, with torn skin and a gouged-out eye. Norman shared his day's adventure, tracking a deer after climbing a hill. He heard a bird's screech, guiding him to rocky terrain where the bird hovered, screeching to alert others.

Norman went on an adventure to spot a herd of reindeer. He carefully observed the deer grazing on moss and lichens. Using a clever trick with his gun, he imitated the movement of deer horns to draw them closer. With a skillful shot, he brought down one deer while the rest scattered. Norman shared that he had to carry the heavy deer meat back to camp, which was the most challenging part of his adventure. Lucien explained that reindeer are found in the Northern regions of Europe, Asia, and America. He mentioned different varieties of reindeer, such as the Lapland reindeer used for transportation and resources, and the larger Tungusians reindeer.

The Woodland caribou is a larger species found near Hudson's Bay. They migrate south in spring, unlike the Barren Ground caribou, which travel north. The Woodland caribou's flesh is not as valued for food as the Barren Ground caribou's, but they are still considered a separate deer species due to their unique habits. In contrast, the Barren Ground caribou is vital to various tribes for survival. These tribes use every part of the caribou for tools, clothing, and food. The caribou's horns are used for fish-spears, skins for clothing, and tendons for sewing. The Indians and Esquimaux have different hunting methods, including pit-traps built in the snow. Norman suggests hunting the caribou the next day to ensure a good supply for the future, as they may need provisions for months.|['1.

Early the next morning, the group woke up before sunrise as they were in the midst of winter, just a few degrees south of the Arctic circle. The plan for the day was to hunt caribou, a task that might take the entire day as they could have to track the herd for many miles. Lucien volunteered to stay back at the camp to guard the animals they had already hunted. They debated on how to protect the meat from predators like lynxes, wolverines, and birds of prey. Eventually, they decided to leave Lucien at the camp while the others set out on the hunt. Norman suggested a cross-cut over the hills to find the caribou, as they typically move against the wind while feeding. Meanwhile, Lucien busied himself by preparing the meat of the animals they had hunted, ensuring it was ready to be carried along for the winter.|"[""1.

Lucien, while staying at the camp, had an eventful day. As he prepared his meal, he noticed a large owl circling above. It was a cinereous owl, the largest in America. Lucien tried to approach it for study, but the owl stayed out of range. Determined, Lucien baited it with a grouse and shot it for examination. The owl was two feet long with a five-foot wingspan, clove-brown with white mottling, yellow eyes, and a yellow bill. This discovery hinted at nearby wooded areas, a welcome sign. Later, he heard wolves chasing a caribou down a snowy hill, resembling hounds on a hunt. The wolves, some dappled-grey and others pure white, were large, typical of the region near Great Slave Lake.|['1.

The caribou was chased down a hill by a pack of hungry wolves. The deer dashed towards a lake, mistaking the icy surface for water, hoping to escape its pursuers who knew they couldn't match its swimming abilities. The wolves closed in as the caribou reached the lake, but to their surprise, the deer landed on the ice and glided away like a skater. However, the wolves caught up, and one managed to bring down the deer, ending the chase. Lucien, witnessing the scene, tried to scare off the wolves by firing his rifle, but they turned on him instead.

Lucien found himself surrounded by fierce wolves on the ice, feeling terrified and hopeless. He shouted and fired his rifle, but the wolves only grew more furious. As he fought back with his gun, slipping on the ice, he believed his fate was sealed. Suddenly, a hunting party arrived, scaring off the wolves with gunshots. Lucien, gaining confidence, fought alongside his rescuers, and the wolves fled. The hunting party had a successful day, killing wolves and caribou.
