The captain's cabin was at the back of the ship, as is customary on naval vessels. It was small, but to Christy, who spent much time on his sailboat, the Florence, it felt spacious. The cabin was well-equipped but not overly decorated, serving as a comfortable living space. Leading from the cabin was the captain's state room, followed by a gangway connecting to the ward room where the officers stayed. The ward room had four berths with curtains for privacy, each assigned to different crew members. The ship's etiquette was strict, resembling that of a formal drawing room. Captain Passford inspected the crew and greeted familiar faces, including the engineer and first lieutenant.

They discussed the speed of the Bronx, built on the Clyde, and its name derived from a small stream in New York. Flint found the name amusing but promised to warm up to it. As they chatted, a noise interrupted them, revealing Dave, the cabin steward, busy cleaning. Dave, a valued member of the crew, had been part of the ship since its journey from Pensacola.

Dave, the steward, was tidying up the room for the captain when he found something concerning near the bed. He quickly took care of it and assured the captain that the berth was now spotless. The captain appreciated Dave's efforts but reminded him not to use certain words. The captain valued Dave's education and entrusted him with confidential tasks in the cabin. Later, the captain caught an intruder eavesdropping at the door. Despite the man's attempts to explain, the captain, with the help of a note, discovered that the intruder was a deaf mute sent to clean the brasses. The captain, impressed by the man's intelligence, let him go and noted his observations about the man to Flint, who also found him intelligent.|['1.

Flint was intrigued by the well-educated deaf mute, Mulgrum, who seemed to have character in his handwriting. Flint explained that Mulgrum was recommended by Mr. Lillyworth and worked as a scullion. Mulgrum was born in Cherryfield, Maine, and educated as a deaf mute in Hartford. He communicated using tablets due to his limited time at the school. Despite inheriting wealth, Mulgrum was patriotic and willing to sacrifice for his country, even offering to fight in the war. Christy, the captain, was cautious about Mulgrum and Lillyworth, as the war demanded officers regardless of their motives. Christy decided to question Mulgrum discreetly about Cherryfield's localities. When asked about his past, Mulgrum's responses raised suspicions, especially when he described a house that Flint knew belonged to the minister.|"['1.

The captain and his lieutenant were satisfied with Mulgrum's responses during the examination. The captain even considered making Mulgrum his clerk due to his education and writing skills. Christy believed Mulgrum was pretending to be deaf and mute, suspecting mischief. The captain decided to remain vigilant and discreet in handling the situation. The Bronx continued smoothly, making sixteen knots per hour. The engine had been improved, enhancing the vessel's performance. The captain inspected the engine room and learned about the enhancements made. Despite the mystery surrounding Mulgrum, the captain focused on ensuring the ship's efficiency and speed.|"[""1.

Christy, a young naval officer, found himself unexpectedly in charge of a small steamer, the Bronx, due to a shortage of officers. Though he lacked experience, he was skilled in understanding the workings of the vessel. Despite his youth working against him, he hoped to prove himself during this brief opportunity. He observed the Bronx's smooth motion and believed she would handle well in rough seas. As he patrolled the deck, he noticed peculiar interactions between the second lieutenant and a crew member. Curiosity piqued, Christy tried to decipher the mystery. The ship ran smoothly under the command of Mr. Flint, with the crew efficiently managed. As the second lieutenant, Mr. Lillyworth, lingered aft, Christy's intrigue grew, wondering about the secretive encounter between Lillyworth and the crew member.|"[""1.

Christy was very eager to find out what was happening between Lillyworth and Mulgrum, but he couldn't figure out how to get any information. He felt like he was being watched as closely as he was watching the second lieutenant. If he moved aft, it would end the conversation. He couldn't ask a sailor without giving himself away, and he didn't know who to trust. The only person he trusted was Dave, the steward. He knew Dave well and believed in his loyalty. Christy saw Mulgrum come from the mainmast and go to the galley. He didn't see Lillyworth and assumed he had gone below. He considered asking Dave for help, but Dave was busy. Christy thought about the weather and then went below for supper. Dave served him, keeping a close eye on him. Christy was too preoccupied with the mystery to eat properly.|"[""1.

Mr. Lillyworth insisted on taking some risks and hinted at a plan to Dave. He mentioned that Dave might not need to hide and that he would speak to the captain about it. Dave was puzzled by this cryptic conversation. Mulgrum, feeling confident, shared that he had passed an examination with flying colors. Dave, unaware of this examination, saw Mr. Lillyworth looking out into the night. Mulgrum, after making his way to the foremast, paused. Dave cautiously descended to the deck and observed the supernumerary going to sleep in the galley. Later, he reported to the captain, who was pleased with his work.

The commander, not early, apologized for waking the captain. He had been busy and needed advice. The captain revealed that the men on board were suspicious. The second lieutenant's real name was Pawcett, and the deaf mute was Hungerford. The first lieutenant, Mr. Flint, recognized Hungerford from the past. The captain knew Lillyworth refused a better job to be on the Bronx. Mr. Flint realized Hungerford was from the Confederate navy. They suspected Spoors, another quartermaster, was involved too.

Mr. Flint left the cabin for breakfast in the ward room. Christy went to the steerage and saw Mulgrum helping the warrant officers. Christy found Mulgrum intriguing and noticed his keen observation. After eight bells, Mr. Flint went on deck. Christy had his breakfast later and called for Pink Mulgrum. They sat together to write.

Christy expressed his dissatisfaction with the lack of officers on board the Bronx, a vessel currently functioning as a storeship. To address this issue, he proposed appointing a temporary third lieutenant. After discussions with Baskirk and Giblock, the former was appointed as the acting third lieutenant. This decision was met with cheers from the crew, although the second lieutenant seemed disapproving. The officers then proceeded to take noon observations, with Baskirk assuming the starboard watch. Despite any reservations, the second lieutenant treated Baskirk with respect. Later, Christy received orders to sail to the Gulf of Mexico and report to the flag officer.

Christy read the orders, folded the document, and put it in his pocket. However, he took it out again as if struck by a new thought. Flint, the first lieutenant, noticed the commander's unusual behavior, attributing it to the unexpected orders. The instructions were peculiar, and Flint, a former schoolmaster, found them clumsy. The orders directed them not to engage in any operations but proceed to the destination promptly. They were forbidden from engaging the enemy unless absolutely necessary. Christy seemed dissatisfied with the orders, which seemed to limit their actions. Despite his disappointment, he maintained composure. The officers left for dinner, and Christy whispered something to the steward before taking a walk on the deck. The weather was improving as the sea began to calm down.

Flint settled into his seat across from Baskirk, feeling a bit disheartened. The first lieutenant, eager to profit from captured prizes, was disappointed by the sealed orders restricting their actions. Flint had hoped to snag a share of the steamers expected on the coast, but now saw his chances slipping away. Captain Christy, cheerful but alert for spies, noted the possibility of eavesdroppers. Mulgrum, a suspicious character, tried to breach the cabin's privacy, causing a scuffle. Despite the obstacles, Christy revealed their mission: intercept two fast Confederate vessels.

The officer of the deck on the Bronx fully trusted the false orders given by Mulgrum, steering the ship toward the Gulf. Despite Captain Christy knowing the deception, he remained silent to maintain the ruse. As the Bronx sailed south-southwest, Christy believed he had thwarted the conspirators' plans. Approaching the Bermudas, a fog descended, concealing the ship's location. Christy ordered silence and reduced engine noise, preparing for a stealthy approach. The ship switched to soft coal, emitting dense black smoke to mimic English blockade runners. Christy's strategy aimed to deceive potential foes and maintain the Bronx's loyalty.

The man on board was tasked to signal the quality of the smoke to the captain by waving his cap. If it was clean, he would return quietly. This way, the captain was instantly informed. The smoke revealed the ship's intent to run the blockade, but its identity remained unknown. Mr. Flint noticed similarities to another ship, likely made by the same designer.

Christy had instructed Dave to keep a close eye on Mulgrum if he went below deck, but the deaf mute had mostly stayed on deck. The ship was at rest, so there was no immediate threat. The captain descended to inspect the ship and noticed the second lieutenant's unease. Christy emphasized the importance of following his orders regarding Mulgrum precisely. As they prepared to move forward, Christy realized Mulgrum could sabotage the engine if they attempted to board the enemy ship. The crew armed themselves in readiness for action, with specific instructions for each division. As the ship began to move, Christy maintained a calm exterior despite the mounting tension.

After the ship hailed the Arran, the captain easily identified the other vessel as the Scotian. He was relieved that the officer hailed him with the correct signal, confirming the identity of the Scotian. This single word spoken through the trumpet unraveled the mystery. The captain now knew he had encountered one of the two vessels his father had mentioned, aligning with his sealed orders. Christy quickly assessed the readiness of his crew for the impending capture. Despite the calm atmosphere, tension lingered as the crew prepared for the decisive moment. A scuffle below deck indicated the plan was in motion. With swift actions, Christy directed the crew to stop and back the ship, successfully docking with the Scotian. A brief confrontation ensued, leading to the surrender of the Scotian's crew. Christy, maintaining his composure, handled the situation with tact and courtesy, ensuring a smooth transition of the captured crew.|"['1.

Captain Passford noticed that the Scotian was well armed, and he was concerned that her partner ship was also prepared for battle. It was crucial for the Arran not to catch the Bronx off guard when she was not ready for a fight. The visitor in the cabin appreciated Captain Passford's conduct and didn't want to cause unnecessary trouble. Captain Dinsmore expressed his desperation, feeling ruined with no future. Christy sympathized with him, reflecting on how he would feel in a similar situation. The commander of the Scotian revealed his ship was the Confederate steamer Ocklockonee and showed his commission as a Confederate Navy lieutenant. Christy confirmed the ship's identity and returned the commission. Captain Dinsmore, proud and distressed, felt like a victim of a trick. Despite the circumstances, Christy defended his actions, stating he would have done the same.

On the Bronx, the captain closely watched the enemy vessels as they fired heavy midship guns. The Ocklockonee struggled to get into position due to the enemy's focus on her. The gunner on the Bronx, Mr. Ambleton, aimed carefully and managed to hit the enemy's smokestack. Christy, feeling it was his turn, ordered his gun to fire solid shots. Despite several attempts, the shots missed their mark. As the vessels closed in, the enemy tried to repair their fallen smokestack. Both sides exchanged fire, with little effect due to the distance.

The engineer on board explained that a shot had pierced the ship's side and narrowly missed hitting the boilers. Despite the damage, the crew swiftly repaired the hole. Meanwhile, a shot from the Arran hit the bridge, causing chaos. Christy inspected the wreckage and found the bridge beyond repair. However, the pilot house remained intact. As the Ocklockonee closed in on the Arran, preparations for boarding were made. Mr. Baskirk and Mr. Amblen led the boarding parties. The Arran, realizing the impending threat, attempted to evade by backing up. Ultimately, the Ocklockonee successfully boarded the Arran, engaging in a fierce battle.

Captain Passford had already spoken to the crew of the Arran, or the Escambia, about their loyalty. He mentioned that as long as they were paid, they were indifferent about which side they served. Christy proposed to keep Mr. Pivotte as the chief and return Bockburn to the Ocklockonee. Flint was content to resume his old role on the Bronx once the two steamers were taken care of. Baskirk was willing to be a quartermaster, stating he preferred to earn his rank. Christy decided to send Baskirk and McSpindle as prize masters to New York.

The new leader prepared his clothes and traveled with Christy on one of the Bellevite's boats to the Bronx. They boarded the ship, where the previous acting leader had already moved his belongings to the ward room. Captain Blowitt was shown to his cabin and state room, which he officially claimed. He appeared content with his lodgings since the government had readied the vessel. Christy mentioned that the second lieutenant was Flint and the chief engineer was Sampson. Captain Blowitt was introduced to the acting third lieutenant, Mr. Amblen. The Bronx had been stationed for three days, and the flag officer had visited to ensure its readiness for upcoming missions. The Confederates were actively trying to counteract the blockade. The Bronx was ideal for operations in shallow waters, solving several challenges.

The two officers were dismissed and asked to go aboard their ship. Soon after, the seamen draft was sent on board, and Christy was glad to see Boxie, the experienced seaman who had been like a mentor to him on the Bellevite, teaching him seamanship and naval traditions. The next day, the commander and executive officer made their final visit to the Bellevite before the order to weigh anchor was given. Christy was impressed by the crew on the Bronx, and the expedition began under favorable circumstances. The Bronx set sail in the middle of the day, and the flag officer kept the destination a secret to avoid premature leaks. Captain Blowitt revealed the distance to be about 280 miles and mentioned a conversation about Cedar Keys. Christy recalled a conversation with Mr. Amblen, who might be a competent pilot for their mission. The commander was eager to have Mr. Amblen on board as a pilot, especially since they were nearing their destination late at night.|"[""1.

"""I am pleased to have such a skilled pilot aboard,"" Captain Blowitt remarked. ""This port seems ideal for the Confederates to load cotton. Small steamers can bring it down the Suwanee River, and the railroad connects to Jacksonville and western Florida. It's a good spot to get cotton out, even though larger ships can't due to shallow waters. No blockaders are likely stationed here yet. Captain Blowitt had planned with his officers for a boat expedition, appointing Christy to lead one boat. He assured Christy that even if the mission failed, he would have done his best. Christy recalled a previous audacious feat, which Captain Blowitt commended. The captain noted that audacity can be seen as boldness or impudence, depending on the perspective.

Christy, the first lieutenant of the Bronx, had a heartfelt conversation with Captain Blowitt. Christy humbly suggested that the second lieutenant should lead the expedition instead. However, Captain Blowitt insisted that Christy was the best person for the job, showing his trust in him. Christy accepted the command, promising to carry it out with care and diligence. As the Bronx approached its destination too early, it slowed down. Christy and Amblen studied the chart to prepare for the night expedition. At midnight, a twinkling light from a village near Seahorse Key was spotted. The crew prepared for the boat expedition, ensuring the oars were muffled to avoid detection. Christy led the first cutter, while Flint led the second, both boats ready for the mission.|"['1.

The journey to Seahorse Key was long and quiet, the men rowing with care not to make noise. When the first cutter approached, the pilot pointed out the dark outline of the peninsula less than a mile away. No ships were visible, hidden perhaps by railroad buildings. The pilot believed a battery was nearby, and Christy wanted a closer look. As the cutter headed that way, the second followed closely. The crew rowed silently, the pilot scanning the area ahead. Buildings and ship masts came into view, indicating the expedition's information was correct. The crew prepared to visit the battery first, expecting it to be well-guarded. The officers watched for signs of life as they neared the shore.|"['1.

When the first boat approached the shore, the leader raised his hands above his head, signaling the rowers to stop. Two oarsmen in the front kept their oars ready. Mr. Amblen guided the boat to land, followed by the crew armed with cutlasses and revolvers. They hid on the sand, preparing for a stealthy approach. Leaving Mr. Flint in charge, Christy and Amblen sneaked towards a semicircular earthwork with field guns. They found a deserted fort with no sentinels in sight. Nearby, a shanty likely serving as barracks appeared empty. Christy peered through windows to find rows of berths, some occupied by snoring soldiers. Unable to determine the exact number, Christy realized they were outnumbered and decided on a cautious retreat.|['1.

Christy quietly explored the barrack, counting the occupied berths and noting there were seventeen sleepers. He shared his findings with Flint and Amblen, then revealed his plan. The men were positioned at the battery, ready for action. Christy and Flint broke into a casemate, discovering it was connected to a magazine. Amblen fetched ten men who removed ammunition, disposing of it in water. The guns were taken to the boats. The expedition then surveyed the bay, finding vessels at the landing place. The boats, carrying heavy guns, were deemed a burden. Christy decided to land two guns on Seahorse Key temporarily. As they left, the sound of a steamer approaching caught their attention. They prepared for the unexpected arrival.|"['1.

"Christy commanded the rowing men to stop, and the boats floated silently on the calm sea. In the darkness, they could discern the type of approaching vessel. ""Shall we take her here or closer to shore?"" asked Mr. Amblen. Christy decided to board the steamer between the Snake and Seahorse Keys. The crew waited as the steamer slowly approached. The two cutters swiftly boarded the vessel with cutlasses drawn. The crew on the steamer was minimal, and no resistance was expected.

After much maneuvering, the ship Havana was steered towards the key, anchoring as close as possible. The crew, including two firemen and an oiler, helped unload the guns and supplies. The guns were mounted on the forecastle, loaded, and readied by skilled gunners. Christy, the leader, oversaw the preparations due to the expedition's delay. As dawn approached, the Havana slowly moved towards the bay. The oiler, named Adolphus but nicknamed Dolly, efficiently managed the engine. He shared that the schooners were nearly loaded but faced delays due to a labor strike caused by offering the workers apple jack. Despite his lack of formal education, Dolly proved competent in his duties. Christy, satisfied with Dolly's performance, continued his mission in the bay.|"['1.

By now, the noise from the shore had grown louder, and several people were visible on the wharf. Flint and Amblen were securing a schooner nearby, while two sailors were untying the ropes holding it to the wharf. In a swift move, the sailors returned to the steamer, followed closely by two men, one in a uniform. The man demanded answers from the crew, but Christy paid him no mind. The steamer was maneuvered to align with another vessel at the wharf. As the soldiers on shore woke up and began firing, Christy quickly ordered the crew to release the fastenings. Despite some minor injuries, the crew managed to free the schooners and escape the gunfire. The soldiers took cover behind cotton bales, and the crew fired back from the steamer.|"['1.

On the two schooners, the crew was present, but the captains were absent. Only the mates were on deck, and they were the only white men. One captain was sitting on the rail looking repentant for not fulfilling his duty. The other captain had left his men unguarded, allowing the invaders to take over.

Captain Blowitt focused on the Havana, a vessel of around four hundred tons, planning to send her to New York due to her unsuitability for war. Most crew members were happy to head north. The Bronx, another ship, awaited orders as a steamer approached, leaving a trail of black smoke. Unsure of its allegiance, the crew prepared for a potential confrontation. Observing the incoming vessel, Captain Blowitt speculated it might be a blockade runner. However, it turned out to be a friendly ship with orders for the Bronx. The tension eased as the two ships communicated, and the Bronx received new crew members, including Paul Vapoor, who brought news of a successful capture.
