"""Don't worry, it was just a firecracker,"" Tom reassured everyone before rushing to catch the train. Tom and his brothers boarded the train at Oak Run to head to Ithaca.

Putnam Hall was a grand building made of brick and stone, situated in the middle of a lovely parade ground that spanned almost ten acres. In front of the parade ground was a road for wagons, with a gentle slope leading down to the lake beyond. On the left side of the building was a playground surrounded by cedars, with a two-story gymnasium at one corner. To the right was a forest, and in the back were storage buildings, a stable, and other structures, along with farmland cultivated for the school's use. The Hall was designed in the shape of the letter F, with three entrances for different classes. The ground floor housed classrooms and drill rooms, while the upper floors were living quarters for Captain Putnam, his staff, and the students. Captain Putnam, a former military man, ran the academy after retiring from the army.|"['1.

The students hurried to the bathrooms to freshen up for the parade. They gathered outside, splitting into two companies led by Harry Blossom and Dave Kearney, under Major Bart's command.

Tom quickly devoured the tongue sandwiches and layer cake brought by an anonymous helper. His hunger from a day of traveling was immense. With a bit of candle for light, he finished the meal just as a noise at the door startled him. Tom swiftly hid the crumbs, extinguished the candle, and kept a small piece. Josiah Crabtree entered, upset about a firecracker incident. Tom, fearing the consequences, escaped through a door to the back garden and into the farmlands.

"The boys spent an hour learning how to use their eyes and perform military drills like ""left face,"" ""right face,"" and ""about face."" They quickly made friends, especially when it was known that Sam excelled in running and Tom in baseball. The school had multiple baseball teams, and they often played matches on Saturday afternoons. The gymnasium was a favorite spot for Dick and his brothers, equipped with various athletic apparatus. Despite Dick's dislike for fighting, a confrontation with a bully led to a physical altercation.

Dan Baxter yelled in pain and clutched his injured eye, which quickly turned black. He swung wildly, growing more agitated as Dick remained calm. Seizing his chance, Dick struck Baxter on the nose, causing him to fall back into Mumps' arms. Baxter's tender nose, previously injured in the gym, made him roar with pain. Sam, Fred, and the others refused to fight openly with Baxter again, but he remained their secret foe. After Baxter retreated, Dick and his brothers washed up at a nearby brook to erase any signs of the scuffle. Baxter's swollen face kept him from attending church, claiming he had fallen on rocks. Captain Putnam warned him to be more careful. The boys prepared for a game of hare and hounds, cutting up old books for clues and setting off on a frosty afternoon.|"[""1.

Tom suggested not to make a fuss about the situation. He recalled the overweight policeman at the steamboat dock, hinting the man might not be reliable due to his drinking habits.

"""If we keep up this pace, we'll arrive at Putnam Hall by three or four o'clock this afternoon, with an hour's break at noon,"" the driver responded to Frank's question. ""But we still have a few small hills to climb, and the weather won't stay as clear as it was this morning.""

""We're in for it!"" Tom exclaimed after their midday stop at a roadside inn for lunch, saving the boxed lunch for later. ""The snow has increased by four inches.""

As they continued, the snow thickened so much that visibility was limited. It was freezing, and the cadets were relieved to huddle under the blankets in the straw, letting the driver navigate the best he could.

After an hour, nearing Cedarville, a sudden shout was heard, followed by a crash as their sleigh collided with another from the opposite direction. Both sleighs were damaged, and the occupants of the other sleigh tumbled in with the cadets in a state of chaos.

""The sleigh is beyond repair,"" Mr. Laning confirmed, as both parties sought refuge at a nearby farmhouse. Mr. Laning and the livery-stable driver went off on horseback to find replacement sleighs.

"""We have fifteen minutes to spare,"" Dick said, waiting patiently until they reached the Stanhope homestead. Upon entering the garden, Dick hurried to the porch and rang the bell. Dora Stanhope answered, and they spent ten minutes together. Dick left feeling elated, while Dora blushed, thinking he was a nice young man. Dick then checked the stable and returned to inform Peleg to put the horse away. Afterward, he joined his brother at Putnam Hall. They devised a plan to climb back into the dormitory undetected. As the head assistant approached, they hurriedly got into bed, pretending to sleep. The assistant entered, noticing the dimly lit room and the boys in bed. Tom, pretending to race, threw a boot, creating a diversion."|['1.

"""You almost raised the roof,"" Dick replied. ""You had better send for those digestion tablets you used to take,"" he added, stifling his laughter in the blankets. The teacher instructed Tom to go to bed and ensured he slept soundly for the night. After tucking Tom in, the teacher left with the door key. Shortly after, a light tapping on the door signaled the arrival of George Granbury and other cadets. Tom and Sam welcomed Mumps, who complained about the orange tasting like kerosene. Tom hinted at the lamp-flavored fruit, and Mumps demanded water. The cadets teased Mumps with root beer, warning him about Captain Putnam finding out.

"Captain Putnam and George Strong might have suspected something, but since the cadets appeared fine the next day after the festivities, nothing was mentioned. ""Boys being boys,"" the captain said to his assistant, and that was the end of it. A few days later, while some cadets were clearing ice at the cove for skating, Mrs. Stanhope's worker delivered a note from Dora to Dick. The Rover boys all read the note with interest. Dora shared good news: Mr. Crabtree had gone to Chicago, postponing the marriage until next summer. She was relieved and grateful for the help. Dora mentioned Dan Baxter, warning that he seemed troublesome. Spring arrived, melting the ice and snow. Fred suggested accepting a challenge to settle a football defeat, and the cadets agreed. They built a grandstand with Captain Putnam's support. The game was set, and the team prepared eagerly. Tom, Frank, Larry, Dick, Sam, and Fred were ready to play their best.

It was an exciting time for the boys as they cheered for their opponents after a game. However, the defeated team, the Pornellites, felt the loss deeply and left quickly. Later, the cadets focused on studying for upcoming exams. Dick ranked second, Tom fourth, and Sam third in their classes, impressing Captain Putnam and George Strong. Following the exams, the entire school prepared for a two-week encampment at Brierroot Grove. The cadets polished their uniforms, packed their knapsacks, and readied their rifles. The battalion marched off with much fanfare, passing decorated farmhouses along the way. Upon reaching the campsite, they set up tents and enjoyed a simple meal of bread, coffee, and beef stew. Despite a brief storm, the cadets made the best of the situation. After a week, Dick, Tom, and Sam went to Rootville to purchase medicine. During the trip, they noticed Baxter and Buddy having a mysterious conversation. Baxter tried to escape but was chased by Dick.
