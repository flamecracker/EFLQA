Silence was requested as the secretary of the Lifeboat Institution stood up. He praised the town's enthusiasm for the cause and the lady who donated the boat. The secretary then called Captain Harry Boyns to the stage, commending his bravery during a storm where he saved 39 lives from a shipwreck. The audience cheered as Captain Harry received a gold medal for his heroic act. Two fishermen, Old Jacobs and Robert Gaston, were also honored for their daring rescue of a young lady. The secretary highlighted the importance of lifeboats and shared the history of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution. The Institution was founded in 1824 by Sir William Hillary, who personally saved over 300 lives, inspiring the nation to support life-saving efforts at sea.|"['1.

The lifeboat service plays a vital role in saving lives and property, showcasing moral influence and material benefits. Annually, moral influences elevate souls, fostering appreciation from nations like Finland, the United States, and France. The Institution's impact extends beyond borders, with Russia, Holland, and others inspecting their lifeboat management. Saving around 800 lives yearly, the lifeboats also rescue distressed ships, safeguarding valuable lives and property. The rescue of 38 ships last year alone underscores the tangible impact on national assets. Unlike lost money on land, a sunken ship signifies a national loss, making lifeboat interventions crucial. These efforts not only save lives but also safeguard national interests, emphasizing the profound importance of lifeboats in preserving both lives and property.|['1.

The Lifeboat Institution is a vital part of maritime safety. Let's consider the story of a large Spanish ship that ran aground off the coast of Ireland. The crew abandoned the ship, leaving one man behind. The _Cahore_ lifeboat crew spotted the vessel, rescued the lone sailor, and even saved the ship and cargo worth 20,000 pounds. Imagine the _Golden Age_, valued at 200,000 pounds, lost at sea. If saved, it could have bought all the lifeboats in the kingdom twice over! Unfortunately, not all ships are saved. The _Ontario_ and _Assaye_ were lost, totaling 500,000 pounds in losses. With over 2,000 ships lost or damaged yearly, the Lifeboat Institution plays a crucial role. In 1868, it saved 603 lives and supported the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society in aiding sailors in need. Their noble work not only saves lives but also prevents impostors from taking advantage of shipwrecked sailors.|"[""1.

A lifeboat, like the one used in a daring rescue in 1857, is built to withstand the toughest challenges at sea. When a Portuguese brig got stranded on the treacherous Goodwin Sands, the brave crew of the Ramsgate lifeboat sprang into action. Battling fierce winds and towering waves, they reached the distressed vessel. Despite their efforts to tow the brig to safety, the storm intensified, forcing them to rescue the crew. The lifeboat, designed to be nearly indestructible, faced the relentless fury of the sea. It was tossed like a toy over the massive sandbanks, enduring crashing waves and perilous currents. Miraculously, after a harrowing journey of two miles over the Sands, the lifeboat emerged victorious, saving all aboard. This remarkable tale showcases the remarkable qualities of a lifeboat: its resilience, unsinkable nature, self-righting ability, and self-emptying feature.|"['1.

The self-righting feature is crucial for a lifeboat's effectiveness. A boat without this capability is only as good as any other boat if it capsizes. Even though lifeboats are stable and hard to overturn, accidents happen, as seen in the Liverpool and Point of Ayr incidents. Non-self-righting boats like the Southwold boat in 1858 had tragic outcomes. In contrast, the self-righting lifeboat near Dungeness in 1858 showcased its effectiveness. Equipped with air-cases and a heavy iron keel, the self-righting mechanism ensures that a capsized boat rights itself swiftly. This design, invented by Reverend James Bremner, was later improved upon to prevent tragedies like the one in South Shields. The importance of self-righting lifeboats in saving lives at sea cannot be overstated.|['1. What is the main advantage of a self-righting lifeboat as described in the text?\nA) It is faster than other boats.\nB) It is more stable and hard to overturn.\nC) It is equipped with air-cases.\nD) It has a heavy iron keel.\nE) It is less likely to capsize in accidents.', '2.

The self-emptying concept is crucial when dealing with lifeboats. When a lifeboat is used to help people from a shipwreck, it fills up with water, making it useless. To solve this, the lifeboat has six large holes in its bottom to let the water out. The boat has an air-tight floor positioned just above the sea level when fully loaded. The water poured into the boat runs out through the holes until it reaches the level of the water outside. This principle is essential for the lifeboat to function effectively. The Lifeboat Institution, through the efforts of its secretary Richard Lewis, has saved many lives. The Institution's success is also attributed to the committee's management and the experienced inspector, Captain J.R. Ward. The Institution has saved over 18,000 lives and valuable property in its forty-year history, making it a national blessing deserving support.|['1.
