In September, the Old Lady reflected on the summer, finding it oddly joyful. Sundays and Sewing Circle days shone like golden moments in her life. She felt transformed, and others noticed the change too. The Sewing Circle ladies found her pleasant, even friendly, realizing they had misjudged her.

Aunt Olivia’s parlour was as neat as she was. Every piece of furniture remained undisturbed, with the tassels of the cushion and the crochet antimacassar perfectly placed. Aunt Olivia, sitting in her great-grandmother's chair, hesitated to share her secret about Mr. Malcolm MacPherson. The mention of his name revealed that he was Aunt Olivia’s beau, a fact that surprised us all. Aunt Olivia explained that Mr. Malcolm MacPherson, who had left for British Columbia years ago, was returning and they were planning to get married. Despite her nervousness, Aunt Olivia expressed pride and dignity.

"Aunt Olivia was eagerly awaiting the arrival of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson, who was due to visit Grafton next week. Aunt Olivia's excitement was palpable as she consulted with her nieces, Peggy and Mary, about the upcoming visit. They shared a chuckle over Aunt Olivia's newfound romance, knowing that her dreams of marriage were finally coming true. Despite her prim and proper demeanor, Aunt Olivia's happiness was infectious.

As the day of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson's arrival approached, Aunt Olivia's nerves started to show. Peggy and Mary helped with the preparations, ensuring that everything was in perfect order for the long-awaited meeting.

Peggy and I assisted Aunt Olivia in getting dressed. She insisted on wearing her best black silk outfit, although her soft muslin dress suited her much better. Aunt Olivia looked exceptionally elegant in her black silk attire, appearing prim and proper once she was ready. As she descended the stairs with her skirt held high to avoid brushing the floor, Peggy and I observed her closely. Aunt Olivia settled in a carved chair in the parlour, folding her hands in anticipation. We sat on the stairs, eagerly awaiting the arrival of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson. Suddenly, a loud knock startled us as he arrived. Opening the door, we were greeted by a tall, broad, and charming man with curly black hair and twinkling blue eyes. He announced his presence, and we ushered him into the parlour. Peggy and I discreetly peeked through the crack in the door, witnessing a surprising and amusing interaction between Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and Aunt Olivia.|"['1.

Peggy and I found Mr. Malcolm MacPherson to be a delightful but unconventional guest at Aunt Olivia's house. Despite his endearing qualities, his actions often left Aunt Olivia flustered. He would scatter flower stems and leaves on the carpet, stuff flowers haphazardly into vases, and be completely unaware of the chaos he caused. Aunt Olivia, although proud of him, was constantly tidying up after his unintentional messes. His carefree demeanor and lack of regard for decorum provided comedic relief for us, even as Aunt Olivia struggled to maintain order. Despite his quirks, Mr. Malcolm MacPherson's genuine admiration for Aunt Olivia was evident, and we couldn't help but be amused by the contrast between his boisterous nature and Aunt Olivia's prim sensibilities.|"[""1.

Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was a jolly man who brought songs, stories, and a lively atmosphere to Aunt Olivia's prim house. He showered her with presents, especially jewelry, which she accepted but never wore. Despite his affection, Aunt Olivia felt trapped by his big personality, feeling pressured as he pushed for their wedding. As the date approached, Aunt Olivia became disturbed and quiet, showing signs of unease. When Mr. MacPherson arrived to set the wedding date, Aunt Olivia's demeanor changed. She cleaned the house meticulously and appeared like a martyr. As Peggy and Mary listened from upstairs, Aunt Olivia went downstairs to face Mr. MacPherson, signaling a turning point in their relationship.|"[""1.

The room on the southwest side was directly above the parlour, with an open stovepipe-hole leading up. Peggy removed a hat box to eavesdrop with me. Aunt Olivia, sounding determined but distressed, told Mr. MacPherson she couldn't marry him. She explained the sacrifice of leaving her home for a stranger. Mr. MacPherson, bewildered, offered to sell his place and buy one nearby. Aunt Olivia refused, citing differences in habits. Mr. MacPherson, realizing her decision, pleaded desperately. Peggy and I, feeling guilty, left, realizing our intrusion. After Mr. MacPherson's departure, Aunt Olivia, resolute, informed us there would be no wedding. Peggy softly protested, but the decision was final.|"[""1.

"Peggy and I hurried home to inform our father about the events. We were disheartened, but there was nothing more to be done. Father found the situation amusing, yet I couldn't find it in me to laugh. I sympathized with Mr. Malcolm MacPherson and even felt sorry for Aunt Olivia, despite my anger towards her. Aunt Olivia seemed to be grappling with her shattered dreams, displaying an impenetrable reserve that puzzled me.

One evening, father shared some news with us. ""Malcolm MacPherson is leaving on the 7:30 train for the west,"" he revealed. ""He's rented the Avonlea place and is departing. Rumor has it he's furious about the trick Olivia played on him.""

After tea, Peggy and I visited Aunt Olivia, who sought our advice on a garment. She was sewing fervently, her demeanor colder than ever. I wondered if she was aware of Mr. MacPherson's departure. Peggy, without hesitation, brought up the topic. 

Aunt Olivia abruptly stopped sewing, her transformation startling. The reserved spinster vanished, replaced by a woman brimming with raw emotion and anguish. ""Girls, I will not survive if Malcolm MacPherson leaves! I have been a fool--I have suffered in solitude since I sent him away. I must see him--there's still time to make it to the station before the train departs if I take the fields.""

When we arrived at the train station, Aunt Olivia jumped out of the buggy and dashed towards the platform, her cape fluttering behind her. Mr. Malcolm MacPherson was waiting there with his luggage. Aunt Olivia rushed into his arms, hugging him tightly. Peggy caught a ride home with a friend, leaving Aunt Olivia, Mr. MacPherson, and me to drive back together. Aunt Olivia sat on Mr. MacPherson's lap during the ride, showing her affection openly. Once back at Aunt Olivia's house, she dragged Mr. MacPherson inside without even wiping their muddy shoes. I had declined teaching a Sunday School class when the Reverend Mr. Allan asked me, as I had a long-standing aversion to following requests from men. This dislike for men had been with me since childhood, and my interactions only reinforced it. My refusal to the Reverend Allan was firm, as I preferred to avoid doing what men asked of me.|"['1.

Mrs. Allan spoke smoothly for thirty minutes before bringing up Sunday School and praising me. She is known for her tact, the ability to approach a topic indirectly. I lack tact, known for being straightforward. When Mrs. Allan hinted at the Sunday School, I immediately mentioned the need for teachers for the boys and girls. I usually teach the girls but have to take a break due to the baby's health. I decided to teach the boys, believing it's essential to guide them early. Mrs. Allan seemed surprised, as she expected me to choose the girls. I avoided admitting that I feared Anne Shirley, who asked challenging questions.

Mr. Bennett may not welcome your interest due to his dislike for women. No woman has entered his home since his sister passed away twenty years ago. Mr. Allan, with a chuckle, hinted that Mr. Bennett might find you bothersome. Ignoring Mr. Allan's implications, I harnessed my pony and drove to Mr. Bennett's house, taking my cat, William Adolphus, along. The neglected house showed signs of no female presence. A dog charged at me upon arrival, prompting me to seek refuge in a cherry tree with William Adolphus. Perched on a branch, I reflected on the situation, feeling a mix of calmness and unease.|"[""1.

The dog sat calmly below, indicating it was a slow day for him. When he growled at me, I refused to scream, mentioning there was no one around except Alexander Abraham, who I doubted would help. I asked if we could go up since going down was impossible. Without a word, William Adolphus started climbing the tree. Following suit, I joined him. The dog circled the tree, clearly agitated. I managed to enter through a window into a messy bedroom. Carrying William Adolphus, I went downstairs, hoping not to encounter anyone.

The doctor calmly responded to my vaccination status and requested me to ask Sarah Pye to care for my house and cats while I was away. I instructed the doctor to have my belongings sent to me, including my pony. Despite being under quarantine, the doctor mentioned that we both must accommodate each other's pets. As the doctor left, I went inside, avoiding being teased by Thomas Wright. I hung up my coat and placed my bonnet on the table. I longed to clean the house but had to wait for my wrapper. I recalled my childhood name dilemma, preferring Peter over Angelina. Just then, Mr. Riley, a dog, entered the house, paying no heed to Alexander Abraham, and approached William Adolphus, causing a stir.|"[""1.

Salome was determined to find a way to manage Lionel Hezekiah, the mischievous young boy she had taken in after his parents passed away. She thought sending him to school might help, but Judith, her stern sister, insisted he was too young. Salome, unable to climb the stairs due to her lameness, wished she could comfort Lionel Hezekiah, who was likely crying himself to sleep after being punished. She believed his mischievous nature could be channeled positively with guidance. Salome longed to discuss this with the local minister, Mr. Leonard, but Judith's aversion to ministers prevented it.

Lionel Hezekiah entered Judith's home and Salome's heart. Salome adored him, but Judith scrutinized his upbringing. Salome, obedient to Judith, bore the brunt of Lionel Hezekiah's punishments. One day, he arrived in tears, entangled in burrs. Salome, distressed, untangled his curls with care, both shedding tears. Lionel Hezekiah lamented not attending Sunday school like his peers, blaming Judith for forbidding it. He believed that only bad boys missed Sunday school. He accused Judith and Salome of being wicked for not attending church.

Salome was troubled by Lionel Hezekiah's views on Sundays. He believed in having fun by fishing, cock-fighting, and getting drunk, activities Salome found inappropriate.

Salome faced a morning of silence from Judith, causing her deep sorrow, yet she stood firm. After breakfast, she struggled to dress, then retrieved her mother's cherished Bible. Despite Judith's disapproval, Salome read it each night in secret. When she entered the kitchen, Judith's stern gaze led her to retreat to her room. Just as she hesitated, Lionel Hezekiah, her nephew, appeared. He admired her and wished to accompany her, but Salome, fearing Judith's disapproval, declined. As she made her way to church, supported by her crutch, she found solace in the familiar pew. The church, quiet and empty save for a Sunday school class, enveloped her in peace. The stained-glass window cast a gentle light, evoking memories of her mother and childhood Sundays.|"[""1.
