A tall, slender girl, around sixteen years old, with serious gray eyes and what her friends called auburn hair, sat on the wide red sandstone step of a farmhouse in Prince Edward Island one sunny afternoon in August. She had set out to interpret lines from Virgil, but the dreamy August day, with blue hazes wrapping the harvest hills, gentle winds whispering in the poplars, and vibrant red poppies blooming in the cherry orchard, was more suited for daydreams than Latin translations. As Anne gazed at the fluffy clouds gathering over Mr. J. A. Harrison's house, her thoughts drifted to a future where a dedicated teacher was shaping the minds of future leaders. Suddenly, her reverie was interrupted by the arrival of Mr. Harrison, the peculiar new neighbor known for his eccentric ways.|"[""1.

Mr. Harrison was known for his peculiar ways of living. He preferred to keep house by himself and openly declared that he didn't want any women around. The people of Avonlea would gossip about his odd habits, especially when it came to cooking and cleaning. He only ate when he felt hungry, and there was no set mealtime in his home. His hired help, John Henry, shared stories of waiting for Mr. Harrison's hunger to strike before he could eat. Mr. Harrison rarely washed dishes, only doing so on rainy Sundays in a rainwater hogshead. He was also known for being frugal, waiting to see the value of things before spending money. To top it off, he had a foul-mouthed parrot named Ginger that bit John Henry. Anne couldn't help but think Mr. Harrison was the ugliest person she had ever seen as he stood before her, speechless with anger.|"['1.

One evening, as the sun was setting, Jane, Gilbert, and Anne were chatting near a fence where the Birch Path met the main road. They were discussing the upcoming school year.

Anne went to bed that night feeling pessimistic. She had trouble sleeping and looked pale and sad at breakfast the next day, which worried Marilla.

Marilla comforted her, saying she shouldn't expect to change everything in one day. When Anne arrived at school, she was nervous but tried to appear confident. She had prepared a speech about mutual help and striving for knowledge but forgot it when she needed it.

Eliza, a somber and pessimistic woman, lived with her sister Catherine in a quaint house nestled in Mark Andrew's beech woods. Eliza, always frowning, found joy in sewing patchwork as a protest against Catherine's lace crocheting.

Mrs. Donnell visited the school and felt it was her duty to tell me that Mrs. Harmon Andrew disapproved of me reading fairy tales and that Mr. Rogerson thought Prillie wasn't progressing well in math. Prillie could improve if she focused more on her work than on the boys. I suspect Jack Gillis helps her with her math. At first, getting St. Clair's attention was challenging, but after a heart-to-heart talk, he understood. He now goes by St. Clair, but the boys call him Jake. Gilbert shared his aspiration to become a college professor, eager to fight disease, pain, and ignorance.

Anne expressed her desire to bring beauty and joy into people's lives rather than just increasing knowledge. She believed in creating pleasant moments that would not exist without her presence. Anne's positive influence was evident as she brightened the lives of those around her. When Marilla returned home, she found a cozy atmosphere with tea, a crackling fire, and delightful scents. However, Marilla received news that she might have to care for two six-year-old twins due to family circumstances. Despite feeling unsure, Marilla contemplated the responsibility ahead.

"""Anne, who had a soft spot for kids, felt a deep connection with the Keith twins. She remembered her own lonely childhood vividly. Knowing Marilla's unwavering commitment to duty, Anne strategically presented her case. 'If Davy misbehaves, it's even more crucial for him to receive proper guidance, right, Marilla?' Anne reasoned. She highlighted the importance of positive influences for the twins. 'Imagine if the Sprotts or Wiggins took them in,' Anne continued, painting a grim picture of profanity and poverty. 'It's our responsibility to provide them with a better environment,' she urged. Reluctantly, Marilla agreed, realizing the weight of their decision. 'I suppose I'll inform Mary that we'll care for them,' Marilla conceded. 'But don't look too thrilled, Anne. It means extra work for you with sewing, which you dislike.'"""|"[""1.

Anne calmly expressed her dislike for a task but acknowledged the importance of doing things one doesn't enjoy in moderation. Meanwhile, Mrs. Rachel Lynde, knitting a quilt by her kitchen window, observed Marilla's return with the twins, Davy and Dora. She noted Marilla's challenges ahead, especially with Davy's restless nature during the ten-mile journey. Despite Marilla's stern demeanor, Davy doubted her willingness to discipline him. He questioned whether Marilla had ever struggled to keep still when she was his age, showing affection by hugging her tightly.

Marilla was relieved as she arrived home to find Anne waiting at the gate. The autumn wind swirled the leaves around them. Anne greeted the twins, lifting them out of the carriage. Dora accepted the kiss calmly, while Davy gave Anne a tight hug, proudly declaring himself as Mr. Davy Keith. Feeling ravenous, Davy wasted no time in devouring the cake, expressing his hunger with unapologetic enthusiasm. He explained that they hadn't had cake at home in ages due to his mother's illness. Davy praised the plummy cake, contrasting it with Mrs. Wiggins' plum-less creations. He eagerly asked for another slice, showcasing his unfiltered excitement for the treat.|"['1.

"Marilla was about to decline, but Anne generously cut a second slice. She reminded Davy to say ""Thank you,"" but he just grinned and took a big bite. After finishing, he winked at Anne, snatched Dora's cake, and stuffed it in his mouth. Dora looked upset, Marilla was speechless. Anne intervened, saying gentlemen never snatch or forget to say thank you. Marilla, resigned, cut another piece for Dora, unable to handle Davy after a tough day. The twins, fair but different, had contrasting features. Dora had sleek curls and a gentle look, while Davy's roguish eyes and mischievous smile gave him a lopsided charm. Marilla decided to put them to bed, with Dora in her room and Davy in the west gable. Davy's mischievous nature tested Marilla, especially in the first week at Green Gables.

Mrs. White calmly escorted the agitated Lauretta out of church, leaving a sense of failure lingering. Marilla, preoccupied, overlooked the sermon for the first time, while Anne, embarrassed, sat beside her. At home, Marilla put Davy to bed as a consequence for his mischief, serving him a simple meal. Despite Davy's lack of remorse, Anne's somber expression made him reconsider his actions. Meanwhile, the Aid Society gathered at Green Gables, where Dora behaved impeccably. Davy, on the other hand, played in the mud. Later, a distressed Dora appeared, drenched and tearful, interrupting tea time.

Dora was upset because Davy made her walk the pigpen fence, causing her to fall into the pigpen and get her dress dirty. Davy tried to clean her dress by pumping water over her, but it only made it worse. Anne took care of the situation while Marilla changed Dora into her old clothes. Davy was punished and sent to bed without supper. Later, Anne talked to Davy about his actions, making him realize his mistake. Davy admitted he only feels sorry after doing something wrong. Anne found a toad in Marilla's bed and had a hard time getting it out. She finally released it in the cherry orchard. Anne was relieved that Davy repented, and she was glad for the distraction when Diana signaled her for a visit.

They had pooled twelve dollars, and despite some objections, the contract was awarded to him. Mr. Harrison remarked on the peculiarities of Mr. Pye, noting that in Avonlea, everyone would call him odd. Anne had to leave as she had sewing for Dora and needed to check on Davy, who was causing mischief. Davy was curious about where darkness goes, claiming it goes down the well.

A thorough search ensued as Anne, Marilla, and Davy scoured every nook of the house and surroundings. Anne combed the orchards and Haunted Wood, while Marilla ventured into the cellar with a candle. Davy, full of ideas, followed them around. Eventually, they regrouped in the yard. Anne, feeling faint, peered down the deep well, but couldn't bear the thought of Dora being there. Mr. Barry arrived with a rope and a claw-like tool to search the well. As they watched, Davy suddenly dashed off towards Mr. Harrison's. Anne hurried to the Harrison house, but found it deserted. Upon hearing a cry from the toolhouse, she discovered Dora locked inside. Tearfully, Dora explained how Davy accidentally trapped her, leaving her hungry and cold.|['1.

Anne was deeply troubled by Davy's behavior. Despite finding Dora safe, her joy was overshadowed by Davy's lies. Davy's falsehoods cut Anne to the core, revealing a side of him she hadn't seen before. Marilla, upon hearing Anne's account, showed no leniency towards Davy. Mr. Barry suggested a firm response.

Davy felt remorseful for telling lies, not realizing it was wrong. He cried, apologizing to Anne, promising never to lie again. He thought Paul Irving never lied, and he wanted to be like him. Davy admitted he didn't know many things were wrong, including telling lies. Anne and Marilla decided to teach Davy right from wrong, starting with not telling lies. Marilla hesitated to punish Davy harshly, considering his lack of guidance. Anne, known for her imagination, suggested avoiding harsh punishments and focusing on teaching Davy the right way. Anne believed in imagining pleasant things rather than dwelling on the unpleasant. The focus was on guiding Davy to learn and grow, rather than harsh punishments.|"['1.

Davy was sent to bed early, a common consequence for him. As he lay there, he pondered the warnings Anne had given him about saying his prayers. Eventually, he called out to Anne from his room, admitting that he had purposely not said his prayers for over a week to test the consequences. Davy expressed his disappointment that nothing terrible had happened, believing that being sent to bed without supper wasn't a dreadful punishment. Anne, however, was more concerned about Davy telling a lie that day. She explained to him the gravity of lying and the importance of honesty.

Yesterday, I tried to teach Lottie Wright addition. I asked, 'If you had three candies in one hand and two in the other, how many would you have altogether?' Lottie humorously replied, 'A mouthful.' In nature class, when I asked why toads shouldn't be killed, Benjie Sloane solemnly said, 'Because it would rain the next day.' It's challenging not to laugh, Stella. I have to hold back my amusement until I get home. Marilla finds it unsettling to hear laughter from the east gable without reason. Teaching is fascinating yet tough. The hardest part is getting kids to share their true thoughts. I once asked them their deepest desires. Some were typical like dolls and skates, while others were unique. Sally Bell wished for a 'honeymoon,' thinking it was a fancy bicycle. The kids' compositions are delightful. I'll share Ned Clay's unedited letter with you.|"[""1.

"Dear teacher,

I plan to write about birds. Birds are helpful animals. My cat, named William or Tom as pa calls him, catches birds. He is striped with one ear frozen from last winter.

While we should be kind to cats, we must also prioritize our children.

Anne sat with Davy on her lap, trying to untangle his theological confusion. Unlike Marilla, Anne understood the whimsical thoughts of seven-year-olds. Just as she convinced Davy that heaven wasn't in Simon Fletcher's attic, Marilla entered from the garden where Dora helped pick peas. Dora was diligent and loved assisting with chores. On the contrary, Davy was forgetful but had a talent for winning hearts. Excitedly, Anne shared that Priscilla and Mrs. Morgan would visit on Thursday. Marilla, intrigued by Mrs. Morgan's fame, agreed to let Anne cook the dinner. Anne planned a simple yet elegant meal, including cream-of-onion soup and roast fowls. However, she couldn't bear to slaughter the roosters herself and decided to ask for help.|"[""1.

The following day, Anne busied herself making pies and lady fingers, tidying her muslin dress, and cleaning every corner of Green Gables. Although the house was already immaculate, Anne wanted it to be perfect for the anticipated visit from Charlotte E. Morgan. She even organized the cluttered closet under the stairs, even though Mrs. Morgan wouldn't see it. Anne explained to Marilla that she wanted everything in order, inspired by a motto from a book she and Diana read. That evening, the two white roosters were prepared for dinner, a task Anne found distasteful but imagined herself wandering the Milky Way while doing it. Despite waking multiple times in anticipation, the morning of the visit dawned beautifully, setting the stage for a wonderful day ahead. Diana arrived with a basket of flowers, ready to help with dinner preparations, looking neat and pretty in her ruffled apron.

Two girls in Canada or the United States couldn't have been happier or more excited than Anne and Diana at that moment. As they decorated the parlor at Green Gables, the room transformed from gloomy to a colorful bower. The table was set with Marilla's finest linen, china, and silver, each item polished to perfection. The kitchen was filled with delicious smells as Anne and Diana prepared the meal. Meanwhile, Davy stayed in the kitchen, occupied with untying knots. In the east gable, Anne and Diana got ready, hoping to converse elegantly like characters from Mrs. Morgan's stories. Diana worried about slipping up with her grammar, but they both looked sweet and girlish. Anne reassured Diana, and they both hoped to impress Mrs. Morgan with their conversation skills.|"['1.

Anne hurried to the sitting room closet to retrieve the platter borrowed from Miss Barry of Charlottetown for the Aid bazaar. As she carefully carried the platter to her guests at the front door, a loud crash came from the kitchen pantry. Everyone rushed to find Davy, a small guilty boy, covered in yellow filling with the remains of two lemon pies on the table. Davy had been climbing to store his herring net twine on a high shelf, against Marilla's rules, resulting in the messy disaster. Despite the ruined pies, the pig benefitted from Davy's mishap. Marilla promptly sent Davy upstairs as punishment for his disobedience, not for the ruined pies. Anne refrained from intervening, understanding the importance of following rules and consequences.|"['1.

Davy, feeling somewhat comforted, asked Anne if he could take some of the spoiled pie pieces upstairs. One o'clock came, but Priscilla and Mrs. Morgan were still absent, causing Anne agony despite the perfectly cooked soup. Marilla, feeling guilty, mentioned adding sugar to the soup. The dinner socially was not a success due to the disappointment and exhaustion of Anne and Diana. Anne tried to keep up the conversation, but her weariness was evident. Suddenly, a loud crash interrupted the dinner as Davy accidentally knocked down Miss Barry's platter with a conch shell.

Anne took responsibility for the mishap, admitting it was her fault for forgetting the platter. Despite feeling properly punished, she worried about Miss Barry's reaction. The guests left, and Anne and Diana washed dishes quietly. Diana left with a headache, and Anne went to the east gable until Marilla returned with a letter from Priscilla, explaining that Mrs. Morgan's sprained ankle meant they couldn't visit Green Gables. Anne, feeling disappointed, sat on the back porch at twilight, reflecting on life's ups and downs. Marilla tried to comfort her, pointing out Anne's tendency to set high expectations and then feel crushed when things don't go as planned.

"Marilla admitted, ""Maybe it does. I prefer walking calmly over flying and thud. Everyone has their own way of living. I used to think there was only one right way, but since raising you and the twins, I'm not so sure. What will you do about Miss Barry's platter?"" Anne replied, ""I'm afraid not.

Anne, with Diana's help, found herself in an unexpected situation. Trapped in a duckhouse, she managed to write a lovely garden story on wrapping paper. Despite the unusual setting, Diana was enchanted by Anne's tale. Miss Sarah Copp, a kind lady, freed Anne with an axe and welcomed her inside. Miss Sarah, feeling restricted by Martha's authority, offered Anne a humble tea. Anne admired a platter in Miss Sarah's possession, sparking a cautious negotiation. Martha, the dominant figure in the household, had locked away the treats. Despite the limited offerings, Miss Sarah's hospitality made Anne feel grateful for her freedom and the chance to rest.|"['1.

Diana nudged Anne under the table, signaling not to agree to the platter for less than twenty-five. Anne, not wanting to risk losing the precious item, promptly offered twenty-five. Miss Sarah seemed regretful she hadn't asked for thirty. She then revealed she was getting married to Luther Wallace, who had wanted to marry her twenty years ago.

Paul excitedly arranged cushions on the window seat and shared his musings with Anne, explaining how his father's gray hair at nearly fifty made him seem old on the outside but young within. Sitting at Anne's feet, he reminisced about sharing thoughts with Mary Joe in the pantry, like the evening star being a fairy lighthouse. Despite knowing there are no fairies, Paul enjoyed imagining. He also shared his belief in an angel walking the world after sunset, singing flowers and birds to sleep. Mary Joe, covered in flour, found Paul's thoughts peculiar and even felt scared.

Paul shared his unique thoughts about nature with his teacher, seeing the new moon as a golden boat of dreams and violets as snips of the sky. His teacher encouraged him, foreseeing a poet in him.

In the evening, Anne walked down to the Dryad's Bubble and spotted Gilbert Blythe coming through the dim Haunted Wood. She realized that Gilbert had grown into a mature young man. Anne found him very handsome, even though he didn't fit her ideal man's image. She and Diana had a similar taste in men, preferring tall, distinguished-looking men with sad, mysterious eyes and a soothing voice. Gilbert, on the other hand, didn't match this description, but it didn't affect their friendship. Gilbert lay down beside the Bubble, admiring Anne. If asked, Gilbert's ideal woman would match Anne perfectly, even down to her seven freckles that she disliked. Gilbert dreamt of a future with a girl like Anne, with whom he would stay true and worthy. Anne's influence over him was profound due to her high ideals and pure nature.

"""We've succeeded in almost all our plans so far, except in getting the old Boulter house removed,"" said Gilbert, ""and I've given that up in despair. Levi won't have it taken down just to vex us. There's a contrary streak in all the Boulters and it's strongly developed in him.""

""And trust to Providence, as Mrs. Lynde says,"" smiled Gilbert. ""Certainly, no more committees. They only aggravate him.

Diana glanced at her watch, realizing they wouldn't reach their destination by five. Walking along the romantic old lane under ancient fir trees, Anne felt like they were in an enchanted forest far from the world's cares. Suddenly, the quaint stone house of Miss Lavendar Lewis, Echo Lodge, appeared. Covered in ivy with dormer windows and chimneys, it stood in a garden enclosed by a mossy stone dyke. Surrounded by spruces and overlooking the Grafton River, the house seemed like a palace out of a fairy tale.

Anne confidently asserted that breaking the spell required more than what they knew. She believed that at the core, the lady trapped in the spell was still young and beautiful. Anne mentioned that only the prince could undo the enchantment, but Miss Lavendar's prince had not arrived yet. The two girls paused on the porch, knocked on the open door, and were greeted by a peculiar young girl with freckles and braids. The interior of the house was charming with old-fashioned yet well-kept furnishings. The most appealing sight was a table set with delicate blue china and treats, making it feel like a special occasion.

The people of Avonlea spent the following day visiting each other and assessing the damage caused by the hailstorm. The roads were too rough for carriages, so they either walked or rode horses.
