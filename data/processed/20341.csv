After a long ride, the tired group settled down for the night. Hindenburg, their bull pup, woke them early with his barks, eager for breakfast.

When a survey line passes through, trees are marked with two notches on each side, known as 'sight trees.' Bushes near the line are bent at right angles to it. If a blaze line turns sharply, a long slash is made on the tree facing the new direction to avoid confusion. Other blazes mark section corners and boundaries. The Overlanders, led by Joe, reached the river fork to set up camp. The air was filled with the scent of pine as they worked energetically. Tom noticed logs waiting to be floated down the river next spring. The camp looked small amidst the towering pines, evoking a sense of awe and silence. Emma felt a foreboding in the whispers of the trees, while Grace worried about falling branches in the storm.

"About thirty minutes later, Tom hurried back from investigating a strange noise on the ridge as the rain began. He quickly decided to wake the girls and gather supplies. ""Get the blankets and rifles,"" he instructed, ""we can't afford to lose them."" Tom and Hippy secured the horses and led everyone to a sheltered spot under the bank's bluff. As they huddled together under makeshift cover, a distant boom followed by crashing sounds startled them. Tom realized their camp had been flattened by rolling logs. Grace fanned Hippy while Tom tended to him, and they planned to forage for supplies or return for more.

The guide gathered pine knots and whittled shavings for a fire. Tom demonstrated how to light a match without a dry surface, igniting the shavings successfully. The fire cheered up the group, drying their wet clothes. They salvaged some supplies and found their campsite destroyed by fallen trees and logs. Despite the chaos, they recovered canned food and battered mess kits. Grace assured the group they could manage until they found more supplies in the morning. The tents were ruined, but they saved their blankets. A forest woman, Joe Shafto, confronted Hippy, claiming she could fend for herself and her bear.

In the Overland camp, Mrs. Shafto scolded Joe for addressing her disrespectfully. Grace intervened, advising Mrs. Shafto to be tolerant and encouraging her to embrace the camaraderie of the group. Tom and Hippy fixed their mess kits while Elfreda noticed something in the trees. Henry, the bear, descended from a tree, showering bark on Joe. Mrs. Shafto prepared breakfast as Tom investigated the skidway. Tom discovered that the logs were manipulated by the jacks using nature's help, rain, and an altered skidway.

The lumberjacks rearranged logs to create a track for the skidway, allowing the logs to slide down the bank smoothly. They also cleared a channel for water to erode the skidway further. Once everything was set, they used hooks to give the pile a push. The group then continued their journey without tents, making their way through dense forest following old tree markings. By evening, they set up camp, constructing shelters using poles, ridge poles, and spruce boughs. A campfire was prepared lower down the slope, with a log serving as the back support. Evergreen boughs were placed in front of the shelters to shield them from the fire's heat. Tom Gray later returned from Section Forty-three, sharing his encounter with the foreman and his suspicions about a troublemaker named Peg Tatem. Joe mentioned Dusenbery as another potential threat, advising caution when dealing with him.|"['1.

As night fell, the group finished their tasks. Mrs. Shafto lit a small fire for supper, explaining how the shelter kept them warm. Tom and Hippy discussed the previous night's attack, with Tom warning Hippy to stay vigilant. They were in a remote area where the law was slow to reach. Tom suggested hiring Willy Horse for protection. Grace had a forestry map to keep track of Tom. They needed to be cautious with fire to avoid forest damage. Mrs. Shafto, Henry, and Hindenburg settled for the night. Suddenly, an explosion startled them, causing a tree to fall. Joe urged everyone to jump into the river for safety.

Grace pondered the mysterious fall of the tree. No wind stirred, the ground was dry, and the tree was alive. It had smothered their campfire, hinting at a hidden cause. Hippy whimsically suggested nature's voices were urging them to leave. Emma hinted that removing Lieutenant Wingate might bring peace. Suddenly, Tom sprinted towards camp, revealing a growing forest fire ignited by the fallen tree. Urgently, he directed the group to extinguish the flames with spruce boughs. As the fire encroached, they fought back, beating the flames with their makeshift tools.

The towering trees quickly turned to charcoal, becoming blazing columns of fire within an hour. The Overlanders, though not at fault for the fire, felt the weight of responsibility to extinguish it. The task that initially seemed manageable had grown into a daunting challenge. As they fought to contain the flames, the fire leaped unpredictably, testing their endurance. Despite their soot-covered faces and scorched clothing, they persevered. Hours passed, filled with the crackling of burning trees and the oppressive smoke-filled air.

Tom and his friends embarked on a journey back to camp, where they encountered a devastating scene of burnt trees. Tom, a forest enthusiast, was deeply saddened by the destruction. Upon arrival, the exhausted girls only sought rest while Hippy craved food. Tom insisted on tending to the horses first. As they settled in, Tom and Hippy were served coffee and bacon by the forest woman. The group, including Lieutenant Wingate, noticed a suspicious hole resembling those from explosions in France. Tom suspected foul play, hinting at serious consequences. Later, the men woke from a nap to the aroma of supper, prompting Hippy to rally the camp for a meal. Tom and Hippy then set out to rebuild the camp, with the girls offering to help but being advised to rest. The group enjoyed a lively meal after satisfying their hunger, with a sudden growling from a bear and Hippy's dog signaling possible danger.|"['1.

Hippy grabbed Hindenburg's collar, and Joe brandished a club at the bear until it retreated. Suddenly, Peg Tatem stormed into the camp with a group of lumberjacks. The Overland Riders looked puzzled at his stern expression. Tom Gray recognized him as the foreman of Section Forty-three. Tatem accused them of starting a forest fire, but Tom defended their actions, stating they had tried to contain it. Tensions rose as Tatem insinuated they knew more about the fire's cause. A scuffle broke out between Tom and Tatem, with the lumberjacks inching closer. Hippy warned the others to be ready to defend themselves with clubs if needed.

The forest woman waited grimly for a chance to confront the lumberjacks, but it came sooner than expected. Two jacks overturned lean-tos into the fire, provoking her to charge at them. Despite a blow, she turned to face them again. Amidst the chaos, Tom and Peg fought fiercely against the foreman. The Overland girls refrained from using weapons, relying on their fists and sticks instead. Hippy wielded a blazing pine knot, scorching the lumberjacks in a swift attack. The girls joined the fray, defending Hippy from the attackers. In the heat of the battle, the lumberjacks tossed Hippy into the campfire, but the girls swiftly rescued him.

Grace and her friends were in a tough spot. They were attacked by the lumberjacks, but with the help of Elfreda, they managed to save Hippy from a fire. However, things took a turn for the worse when Tom got hit on the head and knocked out by Peg Tatem. In the chaos, Peg's wooden leg got shot, but that didn't stop him from coming after Tom. The group, along with their bear companion Henry, fought back against the lumberjacks, driving them away.

"They journeyed along the lumber road for a full ten miles, crossing two streams before stopping at an idle sawmill by a river. Tom inspected the area, checked the map, then they continued on. Past the mill, they found familiar markings guiding them along the riverbank. ""I recognize this. It's the Little Big Branch River, though it's not much yet. We have a long way to go before reaching your destination. Let's set up camp just before dawn,"" suggested Tom. Everyone agreed, tired, cold, hungry, and sleepy.

In the tranquil forest, Emma quieted down after some protests. The only sounds were the bull pup dreaming and Hippy Wingate's loud snores. Hindenburg, tied to a tree, guarded the camp. The pup had a shelter, but Hindenburg was already there, alert with one ear up. Emma joked that he must be deaf in that ear. The night passed peacefully. The bear stayed near Mrs. Shafto's shelter, then left at dawn for food. When the camp woke up, the forest woman's call brought the bear back. He seemed restless, sniffing and growling, while the pup slept soundly. A forest ranger arrived, eyeing the camp sternly. Henry, ready to defend, growled, making the ranger step back. Hippy Wingate introduced himself, diffusing the tension. Grace explained they were not responsible for the fire. The ranger, realizing the situation, relaxed.|"[""1.

Grace, a forester's wife, mentioned her husband was away on official business in the North Woods. The forest ranger, joining their camp, shared his duty to protect the dwindling forests. As the ranger interacted with the Overland party, a sense of camaraderie grew. However, suspicions arose when obstacles downstream hinted at potential trouble.

The group camped by the river that night, nestled under the bluff for protection, soothed to sleep by the gentle stream. The next morning, a commotion woke them, led by their guide. Willy, the Indian, prepared his own breakfast despite offers to join. He then guided the group with a unique gait through the forest. Despite a rainy journey, they pressed on, with Henry looking disheartened but their dog, Hindenburg, cozy in Hippy's bag. As night fell, they sought Willy's guidance, pushing through an unpleasant ride with branches whipping and rain soaking them.

Grace was the only one who seemed to enjoy the unusual experience and the excitement of it, despite the frequent stumbles of the ponies and the crashing of trees. Willy Horse eventually signaled a change in direction, leading the riders through the forest. After setting up camp, Willy prepared bear meat over a fire, while Mrs. Shafto made tea and beans. The girls relaxed in their lean-to, shedding their wet clothes and settling in for the night. The rain poured outside, but they slept soundly. The next morning, they awoke to the sun shining on the river. Willy arrived in his canoe with fresh trout for breakfast, much to the delight of the girls.

"The work on the tepee progressed swiftly as Willy enclosed the structure using strips of bark on the sloping ""lodge""-poles, securing them with leather thongs. The entrance faced the waters of the Little Big Branch. Once completed, Willy hung a deerhide blanket over the doorway. The Overlanders eagerly awaited a glimpse inside, but Willy insisted they wait. Soon wisps of smoke emerged from the tepee's peak as the girls were invited in. Inside, they found a cozy circular room with a crackling fire. Grace expressed her desire to paddle the bark canoe, a novel experience for her. As Grace practiced paddling, the girls enjoyed the unique setting of the tepee, listening to Joe Shafto's tales.

Tom explained that they were on a business trip and invited Lieutenant Wingate to join them. They discussed timber thieves who cut logs illegally and float them downstream to sell. Tom and his companions discovered a dam where logs were stored before being sent to the mills. Tom pointed out the need for a second dam to clear any leftover logs. They found a second dam further up the river, indicating a valuable timber area. Tom estimated the timber's worth at around fifty to seventy-five thousand dollars if owned privately.

Tom mentioned that the profit from selling logs at the mill or turning them into lumber could exceed a hundred thousand dollars with proper shipping facilities. He encouraged further exploration of the lumber business, emphasizing the importance of knowledge. The discussion stemmed from the sale of coal lands in Kentucky, leading Tom and Hippy into high finance. The coal lands were inherited by Hippy from his uncle during his time in the Air Forces. The Overland Riders had prior adventures in the Kentucky Mountains. Hippy and Tom examined pine trees for potential lumber, with Hippy expressing concern about unethical practices. Willy guarded the camp while Hippy and Tom investigated, with plans to purchase the timber plot. Tom cautioned Hippy to stay within budget, leveraging funds from the coal land sale. The men outlined hiring and equipment plans, later sharing their intentions with Grace and Nora.|['1.

During Lieutenant Wingate's absence, Tom Gray explored the timber section Hippy wanted to buy and confirmed it was valuable. Working on a map at the Overland camp, he didn't realize it could be affordable. Suddenly, Hindenburg's barking announced the arrival of men and supplies to guide them to their claim. Tom shared that Willy Horse had helped secure the property from Chief Iron-Toe, who had resisted selling to the Hiram Dusenbery Company for years. Tom's respectful approach won the chief over, sealing the deal with a pipe ceremony. They finalized the transfer at the county seat, with Wingate & Gray acquiring the land after Tom paid the chief ten thousand dollars.|"[""1.

At night, the bunk-house was set for use, even though the bunks were not yet set up, so the men had to sleep on the floor for one night. After a good supper cooked by Tom Gray, the lumberjacks went back to their shack. The sounds of fiddle music and dancing feet, along with shouts and yells, filled the bunk-house. The Overland Riders' camp was close enough for them to hear and see what was happening. The next day, under Tom Gray's guidance, work began on building a dam for the new owners near the Overland camp. Tom had the men put gates in place in a dam built by timber-pirates upstream to lower the water level. Henry, guided by prejudice against lumberjacks, watched from a tall pine tree and even scolded a lumberjack who tried to befriend him. Tom and Grace sat by the campfire, while the others listened to the music and dancing.

"Hippy exclaimed, ""Even the bear falls asleep when I speak!"" The men cheered for Wingate & Gray and the Overland girls. Tables were cleared for music as Nora Wingate sang a lively song with the fiddler. Despite some rough spots in the fiddling, Nora's contralto voice shone. The men demanded more and stomped for another song. Hippy enlisted help for a square dance, with the fiddler leading the music. Lumberjacks stomped their boots, making the shack tremble. Outside, Willy Horse listened to nature's sounds by a fire. Anne questioned the rough dancing, but enjoyed the lively party. As the full moon rose, Hippy heard distant sounds growing louder.

"""Come on, watch your step!"" Tom yelled, dashing onto the slippery log cap atop the spiles. The situation turned dire as a rush of logs approached. Without their spiked boots, Tom and Hippy struggled to keep their balance, slipping and stumbling. Familiar with the gate operation, they swiftly located the levers.

Hippy urged his men to begin work on a new dam, despite the challenges they faced. He acknowledged their hard work and dedication, even though he initially called them rough-necks. The team, led by Tom and Hippy, worked tirelessly to clear the wreckage and build the new dam. The lumberjacks, soaked from the rain, worked diligently under Tom's well-organized system. After weeks of effort, the new dam was finally tested and proved successful. Tom and Hippy then inspected the old dam, suspecting foul play by timber-pirates.

Late at night, as the Overlanders and lumberjacks were asleep, their bunkhouse suddenly shook violently. The Overland girls found themselves outside after their tepee collapsed. Tom and Hippy were unsure if they were thrown out of their lean-to or jumped out in a panic. They discovered a man running from the riverbank with Willy Horse chasing him. The man skillfully hopped over the broken dam spiles with Willy close behind. A tense knife fight ensued between the two men, watched by the Overlanders and lumberjacks. Grace's urgent shout stopped Willy from harming his opponent. The injured man, Peg, was taken to the bunkhouse while the lumberjacks wanted to finish him off, blaming him for their misfortunes. Hippy planned to make Peg confess before the foreman found out.|"['1.

Peg became very angry at the suggestion and hit the cot with his wooden leg until he was tired. Hippy then told him that if he didn't confess, he would go to jail for a long time once he recovered. Finally, after hours of persuasion, the foreman confessed. Elfreda wrote down his statement and made Peg promise to it. Tatem revealed that he acted under Hiram Dusenbery's orders to sabotage the Overland camp. He implicated Dusenbery and Chet Ainsworth in the timber theft scheme. Peg named some lumberjacks working for Dusenbery. The Overlanders took care of Peg and sent for a doctor and the sheriff. Dusenbery and Ainsworth were found guilty and imprisoned.

At seven in the evening, the workers, known as the jacks, were finally welcomed into the new bunkhouse after being initially left out. Inside, they were greeted by a festive sight - pine cones, colorful lanterns, candles, and an American flag hanging proudly. The girls sat with their guests, with Hippy leading the table. Grace, however, couldn't shake off her unease around Spike, a red-haired lumberjack. The meal was a feast with turkey, cranberry sauce, and more. The jacks, not used to such gatherings, mostly kept to themselves. Dessert was a grand plum pudding, which the jacks tried to put out the flames on, thinking it was on fire. Laughter filled the room as they devoured the dessert. Later, the Christmas tree was revealed, adorned with gifts. Each lumberjack received a ten-dollar gold piece as a Christmas present, leaving them speechless and grateful.|"['1.
