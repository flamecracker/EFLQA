Tom Brown and his companions, Major Garret and Lieutenant Wilkins, were preparing for their hunting expedition in the African bush. Tom, a passionate hunter, expressed his eagerness to track down lions. The major and lieutenant, also keen on collecting plant and insect specimens, found Tom's enthusiasm infectious. As they rested under a tree, the major shared their plan to head to Big Buffalo's Village and possibly join a group of traders heading to the Zulu country for a better hunting experience. Tom, cautious about large groups, suggested sticking to a smaller party for manageability. Eventually, they decided to explore the forest edge, leaving their belongings with Hicks the trader.

About an hour after resuming their walk, the major went off in hot pursuit of an enormous bee he spotted near a bush. At the same time, Wilkins lagged behind, intrigued by a plant, leaving our hero to hunt with the natives. Walking ahead, Tom Brown reached a dense, dark thicket. He signaled a Caffre carrying his gun upon spotting large animal tracks. Despite never having shot big African wildlife before, Tom bravely entered the thicket alone. As he advanced, memories of lions flooded his mind. Suddenly, he faced an old buffalo-bull, asleep just yards away. Tom fired, startling the buffalo and another hidden creature. The buffalo charged, forcing Tom to dodge and shoot again. After a fierce chase through thick bushes, Tom managed to take down the buffalo. The natives, who had hidden in trees, praised Tom's bravery, but he felt abandoned by their lack of support. Just as he was about to reprimand them, the major's call diverted his attention.|"['1.

A loud roar interrupted a hunter's speech as a buffalo charged towards them, scattering the party. Wilkins, a skilled hunter, took a shot at the charging buffalo, but it continued running. The hunters pursued the buffalo, with Wilkins leading the chase. Suddenly, another buffalo appeared behind the major, prompting him to take a shot. Despite his effort, the buffalo continued its charge. The major quickly climbed a nearby tree to avoid the buffalo's attack. Later, by the campfire, Hicks, a trader, shared news of lion attacks nearby. Tom Brown, eager for adventure, decided to hunt lions the next day but found none. The group then joined a larger party led by Trader Hardy, including other hunters and oxen, embarking on a journey towards the Umveloose river.|"[""1.

"Wilkins exclaimed, ""Listen!"" ""How can I hear yours when I have my own host to attend to? Ah! But I hear that,"" he chuckled as another loud crack echoed from Tom Brown's cheek. ""You must have a tough skin to endure that!"" ""I admire your calmness, Tom,"" the major said. ""If I got such a slap, I'd lose my temper. Did we defeat the enemy?"" ""Let him bite, sir,"" growled Hardy from under a wagon. ""Hit hard and quick when he's stuck. But best is to let him bite and sleep."" Tom sighed and buried his face in a blanket, his companions soon asleep despite the rain and mosquitoes. The wet weather affected their spirits, but the natives were resilient. They were almost naked and greased, making the rain slide off. The sky cleared, lifting their spirits and health. Africa's abundant wildlife amazed the travelers.

Tom rode his horse swiftly with an elephant close behind. As he glanced back anxiously, he found himself near a steep slope. Unable to stop, he had to swerve.

The poor dog was badly injured around its neck, but it soon recovered. That same night, a lion killed one of the oxen, but the lion managed to escape without being caught. The travelers continued their journey, facing different weather conditions and hunting challenges until they arrived in the Zulu country by the Umveloose river. Taking a break, they intensified their hunting efforts in various directions. Our hero had a unique experience when he decided to explore the riverbanks alone.

In a stunning natural setting, Tom observed a variety of creatures from massive alligators to tiny plovers. The scene was alive with activity as cranes, herons, and flamingoes foraged for food while others rested with satisfaction. Tom's focus was on the crocodiles and hippopotami sprawled nearby. As he contemplated the grandeur of nature, a hippopotamus startled him. Despite being near the animals without alerting them, Tom hesitated between firing at the crocodiles or hippopotami. Suddenly, a hippopotamus yawned, revealing a cavernous mouth. Tom was awestruck by the creatures' grandeur and horribility. When a boat approached, the creatures scattered in a chaotic frenzy. Tom fired at the hippopotamus, creating more commotion. Amidst the excitement, Tom was engaged in the whirl of activity, firing shots and witnessing the intense reactions of the animals.|"['1.

Wilkins shouted loudly and waved his arms frantically, trying to warn his friend, Tom, of approaching danger. Tom, unable to hear clearly, cautiously scanned the area. Suddenly, a crashing noise alerted him to three charging buffaloes. Tom hid behind a bush, attempting to shoot but missed due to dense foliage. As he chased the buffaloes, one wounded by Tom attracted three lions. Tom, momentarily stunned, eventually shot and killed one lion while wounding another. The lions attacked the buffalo, with Tom intervening to shoot the lions. Tom, Wilkins, and Mafuta found one lion dead and another injured. They camped, feasting on hippopotamus steaks. Tom reflected on his adventurous day, realizing the reality of facing lions. Dr. Livingstone's description of lions as less majestic and courageous than commonly believed was discussed, highlighting lions' behavior when encountering humans during the day.|"['1.

Light, whether from the moon or the sun, has a way of scaring off lions. On bright moonlit nights or during the day, lions are less likely to attack. However, on dark, rainy nights, it's crucial to secure oxen as lions may strike despite guards and campfires. Lions approach quietly, akin to cats, and are deterred by traps. In India, tigers swiftly snatch bait unless a hunter conceals it in a pit. Lions are strong, often dragging prey instead of carrying it. They prefer certain parts of animals and are skilled at carving them out. Lions typically hunt alone but may occasionally group up. Despite their reputation for courage, lions rarely challenge full-grown buffaloes. Older lions may resort to preying on goats near villages, sometimes targeting humans. Lions, when aged and unable to hunt, might even resort to catching mice.|['1.

After describing the general character and appearance of the lions, we continue the story of Tom Brown and his friends. The hunters were back at the wagons, preparing to rest for the night before resuming their work the next day. Suddenly, the sky darkened, signaling an approaching storm. The Caffres were busy with a buffalo bull they had shot earlier, roasting and eating its flesh. As the storm hit with intense rain and thunder, the lions drew closer, roaring in the darkness. Tom and his friends, including Jumbo, faced the lions, firing shots in the pitch-black night. The lions attacked, causing chaos and fear among the group.

Tom Brown and his friends were startled by a terrifying sight in a nearby thicket. A figure resembling a skeleton covered in a black, ghastly skin lurched towards them, resembling a drunken man. Jumbo, one of the group, turned pale and fled in terror, mistaking the figure for a ghost. Tom suspected the figure was a man buried alive the night before, now terrifying Jumbo. Hicks, a trader, suggested they take a boat left by a previous party to hunt hippos and elephants. Tom, Wilkins, and Mafuta took the boat, while the others went after elephants. They encountered a massive crocodile, which they decided not to harm due to its size. Instead, they pursued a hippopotamus, successfully taking it down after a challenging battle.|['1.

The explorers towed their catch to the shore, planning to secure it. Suddenly, a baby hippo surfaced, staring at them dumbly before Tom shot it. The mother hippo emerged, grabbing the boat and pulling it under. Wilkins reacted, shooting her twice and freeing the boat. More hippos fell to their guns, attracting a crowd of natives eager for meat. Crocodiles lurked nearby, so the natives banded together to haul the hippos out. The natives waited patiently as the traders claimed the meat. When the natives finally got their share, chaos erupted as they fought for the spoils. Despite the frenzy, fairness prevailed among them. The traders intervened to ensure equal distribution. The natives rewarded the traders with gifts that evening. Major Garret's fear of snakes contrasted with his bravery in facing other dangers.|['1.

In the region where the major was, there were many snakes that caused him trouble. He encountered numerous snakes of various sizes and types. One snake, killed by Mafuta, was extremely poisonous, causing the death of dogs that were bitten almost instantly. Tom Brown also dealt with a venomous snake that continued to release poison even after its head was cut off. The major, filled with horror, saw all snakes as enemies, whether they were dangerous or not. When he encountered a harmless python in a thicket and mistook it for a threat, he fired his gun and fled in panic. The major's fear led him into more trouble as he unintentionally disturbed a mother elephant and her calf, prompting a chase where the hunters attacked the elephants with spears, resulting in a dramatic confrontation.|['1.

The locals were thrilled by their success, anticipating a feast of baked elephant foot. Hicks admired the tusks, mentioning his need for ivory due to the high expenses of trading expeditions. As Hicks voiced suspicions of someone pursuing the elephant, a group of natives emerged, driving the elephant towards the hunters. The elephant sensed danger, veering off course, leading to a challenging hunt. Despite breaking the animal's leg and multiple shots, it took effort to bring it down. The female elephant killed was relatively small, with a height of eight feet eight inches. The African elephant's distinct feature is its large ears. The hunters had a successful day, bagging sea-cows, elephants, buffaloes, a giraffe, and various birds. The natives celebrated the hunters, especially our hero, who used medical skills to aid them. Later, the group witnessed a mesmerizing sight of animals quenching their thirst at a waterhole, including elephants joyfully spraying water.|"['1.

One day, a group set out to track elephants near their camp. During a break, two members, the major and Tom Brown, realized they left their guns behind when they went back to retrieve a knife. As they returned, three lions appeared nearby. Tom, feeling fear, saw the major remain composed. Surprisingly, the lions retreated after a loud yell from Tom and the major. Later, the group encountered four lions and decided to encircle them. When the lions attacked, the natives were unable to hold their ground.

Pearson loaded his gun quickly when he heard a shout and warnings. Suddenly, the lion pounced on him, striking his head. The lion then attacked Hicks, but Tom Brown and the others fired shots, causing the lion to drop Pearson and focus on Hicks. Mafuta and Tom Brown tried to stop the lion, but it was Wilkins' shot that finally killed it. Pearson's injuries were fatal, and Hicks was hurt. Tom Brown comforted Pearson by reading from the Bible all night. Pearson passed away peacefully. The group faced challenges on their journey back, battling illness and losing a member.

"Tom, don't tire yourself out with objections. Bob and I have decided to press on. Moving closer to civilization every day will keep us strong. We won't delay in sending help to you,"" said the major. Tom agreed, realizing Mafuta could save him. He asked for his Bible, feeling the need to read it.

Tom and his guide, Mafuta, were on a challenging journey through a wild land. Tom, feeling unwell, took some medicine that didn't work. Rats in the hut made it hard for him to rest. But after trying a different potion, he finally found relief and slept deeply. As they continued their journey, Tom faced ague attacks and struggles. Eventually, he regained strength and even bought horses to make travel easier. One day, Tom spotted a herd of giraffes and chased after them for fresh meat. Despite a rocky chase, Tom managed to take down one giraffe after a dramatic fall from his horse. The adventure continued as Tom's resilience and determination were put to the test in the unforgiving wilderness.|"['1.

The group of explorers had enough meat to sustain them for a few days as they journeyed through a region teeming with wildlife. Their main goal was to swiftly leave the unhealthy area, so they paid little attention to the abundant game around them. However, there were moments when they had to defend themselves. Once, while Mafuta sought water in the wilderness, he narrowly evaded a charging black rhinoceros. Tom Brown, nearby, heard the commotion and prepared to take a risky shot to protect his companion, but the rhinoceros passed by Mafuta without harming him. The group set up camp for the night, hanging meat in a tree for safety. As they rested, Tom and Mafuta discussed the contrast between their natural lifestyle and the artificial demands of civilization, interrupted only by the distant growls of a lion drawing near. Tom readied his rifle, and Mafuta gripped his knife, prepared for the unwelcome visitor.|"['1.
