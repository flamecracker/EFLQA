Preface. The history of Ireland has been a significant topic for years, likely to remain so. Recent troubles stem from deep-seated grievances where much of Irish land was taken from its original owners and given to Cromwell's followers. Irishmen faced covetous intriguers influencing the government, leading to unrest. The rising in defense of King James was more an act of desperation to protect religion, property, and lives threatened by the Protestant ascendancy. The events are recounted from the Irish perspective, drawing heavily from Mr. O'Driscol's historical account. Castle Davenant, once a stronghold, now lies in ruins after Cromwell's army's assault. The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of Ireland's tumultuous past, where the struggle for land and power shaped the fate of its people.|"[""1.

The Davenant estate was saved due to the influence of General Ireton, securing the widow's possession of her home ruins and some land. Mrs. Davenant, her son Fergus, his wife Katherine, and their sons Walter and Godfrey lived there. Two miles away, Zephaniah Whitefoot lived in a stone house on the Davenant lands. Cromwell's followers were stern and lived in isolation, despising beauty and joy. Zephaniah ruled his household strictly, and his wife died weary of repression. Their son, Jabez, inherited his mother's docility, never challenging his father's rule. Jabez's wife fought against Zephaniah's tyranny, urging Jabez to stand up for himself. The family dynamics showed the struggle between obedience and individuality, highlighting the impact of strict beliefs and control on family life.|"[""1.

Hannah Whitefoot stood firm in her resolve to raise her son differently from the strict upbringing her husband, Jabez, had endured. Despite his father's initial resistance, Jabez supported his wife's efforts to provide a more joyful and loving environment for their child. The household was filled with laughter and warmth, a stark contrast to the stern atmosphere Zephaniah, Jabez's father, had maintained. When Zephaniah objected to fairy tales being told to the child, Jabez calmly asserted his support for his wife, willing to leave if necessary. This ultimatum led Zephaniah to accept the changes in his household to keep his son and daughter-in-law close. Over time, the animosity between the Whitefoot family and the neighboring Castle estate softened, paving the way for future generations to forge friendships. John Whitefoot, raised with a blend of spirited independence and moral grounding, grew into a lively and promising young man, embodying the hope for a harmonious future between families with differing pasts.|"[""1.

Jabez listened as his father, Zephaniah, expressed his concerns about the changing times and the influence of his daughter-in-law on their son, John. Despite the differences in their perspectives, Jabez remained resolute in his beliefs. He acknowledged that John, with his broader views, might pave a different path, but he trusted in his son's integrity. Meanwhile, Mr. Davenant saw potential in the friendship between John and the young Davenant, recognizing the positive influence it could have on his son. He believed that such companionship could broaden John's horizons and provide him with innocent pleasures. While Zephaniah held onto traditional beliefs, Jabez and his wife saw the value in embracing different perspectives and fostering friendships beyond their own community.|"[""1.

Hannah expressed her concerns about the boldness of her son's words and the potential disapproval from her father and church elders. Despite this, she agreed that the companionship between her son John and young Davenant would be beneficial. However, she emphasized the importance of obtaining the father's consent before the boys could become friends. John relayed this message to Walter, who had already gained his father's approval. Over the next two years, the boys met regularly for rambles and conversations. John, whose education was limited to religious texts, eagerly absorbed knowledge from Walter's more advanced studies. Hannah, cautious but open-minded, allowed John to explore new books, including works by Shakespeare. As a storm raged outside Davenant Castle, Walter expressed concern about a ship in distress, prompting action from the family.|"[""1.

In just two minutes, two men and Godfrey stepped outside. The wind hit them hard, and Godfrey held onto his father. Silently, they walked down to the village, with about a dozen huts for fishermen. Speaking was pointless with the storm's howls drowning all sound. As they descended, they saw the wrecked vessel. Moonlight revealed the ship's torn sails and missing foremast, battling the fierce waves. Hope was lost as the ship struggled, unable to maneuver or anchor safely. Amid the storm's chaos, a loud cry and breaking timber marked the ship's masts collapsing. The only chance to launch a boat was near the Nose, a rocky shelter. The curragh, a unique boat with a flat floor and high bow, was their only hope. Launching it was perilous, but they managed to get beyond the dangerous waves, facing a risky but necessary mission.|"['1.

After many failed attempts to launch the boat, narrowly escaping disaster each time, they decided on a plan. They would wait for a wave to pass, then drop the boat onto a flat rock that was momentarily visible. Two boys on shore would hold the head rope to prevent the boat from being pushed towards land by the next wave while Larry used the oars to move away from the ridge. As the wave passed beneath them, the head rope would be released. The plan was executed successfully. The boat floated over the rough sea, with Walter fearing at times it might capsize. They rowed towards the ship, battling strong winds. Walter threw a keg towards the shore, which was retrieved by Considine amidst the waves. The crew on shore secured a cable, and the sailors began to pass along it. The ship was breaking apart rapidly, with crew members lost to the sea. The officer leaped into the water and was rescued by Walter. As a towering wave approached, the wreck disappeared beneath it, leaving only floating debris.|['1.

Help arrived just in time. The boat had been closely watched from the shore. As it turned back towards the Nose after the wreck vanished, Mr. Davenant, Considine, the priest, and the boys who helped float the boat hurried along the shore to meet it. The fishermen stayed behind to assist anyone washed up from the wreck. Considine and Mr. Davenant joined the officer as the boat landed, with Walter and Larry successfully coming ashore despite the boat capsizing. The survivors were taken to safety, and Walter was praised for his bravery by Colonel L'Estrange. The storm had subsided, and plans for Walter's future were discussed, considering the limited opportunities in Ireland due to historical injustices.|"[""1.

"""I believe better times are on the horizon,"" Mr. Davenant expressed optimistically. ""The king is showing a favorable inclination towards our religion. His intentions have been hindered by his advisors and the English faction here, who distort the true sentiments of this country to maintain the status quo. Ireland has long been exploited by opportunists seeking to seize land from the native population.""

""That's true,"" Mr. Davenant agreed, ""but times have changed, and we, the descendants of Strongbow's men, now see things from an Irish perspective. I remain hopeful for a brighter future.""

Colonel L'Estrange interjected cautiously, ""The Protestant sentiment in England is strong. Monmouth's failure was self-inflicted, and James's ineffectiveness could lead to further complications. If William lands successfully, his odds are favorable.""

""I am not a politician,"" Colonel L'Estrange continued, ""but the Stuarts' history is marred by weaknesses. William's support in England comes from those who opposed King Charles. It's hard to rally behind the Stuarts' legacy.""

""In Ireland,"" Mr. Davenant added, ""the conflicts are driven by English greed for Irish land. The injustices have sparked rebellion, but there's hope for justice under James's rule.

Colonel L'Estrange expressed his hope to avoid civil war, highlighting the atrocities it brings. He compared it to the civil war in England, emphasizing the absence of race animosities and cruel wrongs. The discussion shifted to the ship, where there were around fifty people on board. Mr. Davenant decided to ride in with Colonel L'Estrange to share the serious news. Larry, a helpful lad, was seen carrying wood fragments. Colonel L'Estrange thanked Larry for saving his life and offered future assistance. Walter's brave deed during a storm was praised, and John regretted not being there to help. Despite his family's disapproval of the sea, John acknowledged the importance of saving lives, bringing pride to Walter.|"[""1.

Walter casually mentioned that the recent news had occupied their thoughts, overshadowing past events. John expressed concern about the differing opinions between his family and Walter's regarding the return of lands due to political leanings. Despite potential losses for John's family, they acknowledged the fairness in the land return. John shared his aspirations beyond farming, inspired by the books Walter lent him. John's grandfather disapproved of his reading habits, believing wisdom was found in one book only.

John and Walter discussed their family's religious views. John shared how his mother's teachings shaped him, contrasting her with his gloomy and fanatical grandfather. They agreed that true religion should not breed tyranny within families. Walter pointed out that the manner in which religion is practiced matters, citing his mother and grandmother's peaceful beliefs. They pondered how upbringing influences religious views, agreeing that few change their faith. The boys parted ways, promising to keep in touch. John left for Dublin, where news of William of Orange's landing sparked tension between Protestants and Catholics. Fearing retaliation, Protestant refugees flooded Dublin. False reports of violence added to the chaos. John journeyed north, while Walter reflected on the religious divide in their society.|"[""1.

Both factions were on edge, waiting for the right moment to act. The Protestants hesitated to start a conflict until they were sure William was firmly established on the English throne. The Catholics also sought peace until they had no choice but to resort to violence. The city was deeply divided, with younger, more eager individuals ready for battle, while older and wealthier citizens opposed it. The trouble began when the Earl of Tyrconnell sent troops to aid King James, sparking fear among the townsfolk. Tensions rose as the Earl of Antrim's regiment approached, leading to a standoff at the city gates. The younger generation was eager for a fight, while the older citizens urged caution. Despite the conflict, the narrator, a Protestant, remained committed to defending their faith.

Preparations for war were happening all over Ireland. Protestants in the north armed themselves, using the actions of a few peasants as an excuse to attack Catholics. Only Charlemont and Carrickfergus in Ulster remained loyal to King James. England and Scotland accepted William as king, and James fled to France. Despite this, most of Ireland supported King James. Troops were raised by Lord Inshiquin in the south and Lord Kingston in Connaught for William. Tyrconnell commissioned Catholic nobility to raise troops, resulting in fifty regiments of foot and several horse troops. However, there was a lack of weapons and supplies due to financial difficulties. Mr. Davenant raised a troop of horse, with Walter eager to join. Despite being refused a commission, Walter was allowed to accompany the troop as an observer to prepare for future involvement.|"['1.

Walter's father granted permission for Larry to accompany him, which lifted Walter's spirits despite missing out on becoming a cornet. Mr. Davenant trained his troop diligently in January as tensions rose in Ireland. Lord Mountjoy's regiment in Derry unexpectedly sided with the rebels, leading to his imprisonment in France. The people of Derry proclaimed the Prince of Orange as king, sparking the beginning of the war. Lieutenant General Hamilton's forces defeated rebels in Ulster, except for Enniskillen and Derry. In the south, General M'Carty triumphed over William's supporters. King James arrived in Kinsale, boosting morale among the Irish.

"""I hope not, my boy. It is his interest and not our own we must think of now; and if Ireland is to resist, successfully, the English and continental troops of Dutch William, we must be united--we must be Irishmen first, Catholics and Protestants afterwards. I trust that he will issue such proclamations as will allay the alarm of the Protestants, and bind us all together."" King James is not like his father. In no single case, since he came to the throne, has he broken his royal word once given; therefore, all may feel confidence in any promises he may make. I have, of course, no hope that anything he can say will influence the fanatics of Derry and Enniskillen, but we can afford to disregard them. They are entailing misery and suffering upon themselves, without the slightest benefit to the cause they advocate. If we beat the English, of course those places must finally surrender. If the English beat us, they will get their Dutch William as king, without any effort on their part. I think, myself, that it will be very unwise to attempt anything against those two places.

After walking around for an hour, Walter found his father, Captain Davenant, sitting with two officers, Lieutenant O'Driscoll and Cornet Heron, by a fire. The troopers had collected materials for the fire, and there was no need to cook as they had enough cold food. Walter sat on a truss of straw next to his father and enjoyed a meal of bread and cold chicken by the crackling fire. Each had a horn filled from a keg. They rolled in their cloaks on the straw to sleep. Walter found it hard to sleep due to the new experience and sounds around him. His father comforted him, saying he would get used to it. The city of Derry was tense as King James and his troops approached. Many debated resisting or surrendering due to the impending famine and lack of outside help.|"['1.

The fortified garrison had been reinforced with two regiments and ample supplies, yet provisions were scarce, lasting only for ten days. Archdeacon Hamilton brought a message from the king proposing amnesty if the city surrendered within four days. The governor, council, and English regiment leaders deliberated this offer. John Whitefoot, returning to his cousin's house, found it filled with refugees. The tanner, known for his hospitality, sheltered all seeking refuge. Amid the looming decision, women and children, reflecting on their abandoned homes, sought solace. The tanner, torn between fighting and protecting the vulnerable, weighed the council's choice.

The preacher left the house abruptly after the capitulation was signed and James' army approached Londonderry. The army positioned itself to isolate the town, but a man named Murray rode through their lines, urging the townspeople to resist. This led to the townspeople firing upon the army, causing casualties. The governor tried to explain the situation to the royal camp, while Murray continued to encourage resistance. Eventually, the townspeople chose new leaders, prepared for defense, and the royal troops withdrew. The tanner, John, was moved by the events but chose not to join in the resistance immediately, knowing that the city faced a battle against famine rather than direct assault.

Despite being outnumbered, the besieged town of Derry showed resilience, with the population united in defense.

During the siege of Londonderry, a young boy named John Whitefoot noticed that the children taking refuge in a tanner's yard were starting to feel unwell due to lack of fresh air. Concerned for their health, John proposed building a shelter in the yard using casks, timber, and sacks filled with tan to protect them from enemy fire. The elders supported his idea, and soon the children were happily spending their days and nights in the shelter. John entertained them with stories and toys, ensuring their well-being while their parents could rest easy.

"John, the tanner, agreed with the plan, despite his initial hesitation. He acknowledged that the small portion of food brought by John was better than nothing for the children.

The days passed, and the town's population dwindled due to fever and famine. The survivors, weakened to mere skeletons, struggled to bear the weight of their arms. On July 30th, three ships approached the river mouth, part of Kirk's squadron. Kirk, under pressure from London, attempted to breach the town's defenses. The besiegers prepared to repel the ships. The vessels broke the boom, but one ship grounded. With a strategic move, the ship's captain fired all guns forward, freeing the vessel. The delay had cost many lives in Londonderry. The city rejoiced as provisions arrived. The failed attack had turned peasants into disciplined soldiers. Captain Davenant lamented the loss of life and the embittered Catholic-Protestant divide.

After a fierce battle where McCarthy tried to restore order but was wounded and captured, chaos ensued as the Enniskilleners relentlessly pursued fleeing soldiers. The pursuit extended into the night and the following day, resulting in the cold-blooded killing of many fugitives. To avoid capture, five hundred Irish soldiers chose to drown in Lough Erne. Meanwhile, the army returned to Dublin, where Parliament convened to discuss the Act of Settlement that had favored Protestants over Catholics. Despite King James' efforts to enact fair laws, the repeal of the Act faced opposition from Protestant bishops and peers. The king's desperate measures, like issuing copper coins, led to economic turmoil and discontent among the populace. Despite the challenges, there was hope for a brighter future as the Davenant family awaited the return of their lands and the end of Cromwellian rule.|"['1.

Jabez had challenged his father's authority, causing a shift in the household dynamics. Zephaniah remained in charge of daily tasks, but Jabez had gained independence in other matters. Meanwhile, in Ireland, tensions brewed between the French and Irish factions. The French, in control of James, disdained the Irish, while the Irish resented the French arrogance. The Irish regiments, led by local gentlemen, were replaced by French soldiers, leading to widespread discontent. William of England prepared to invade Ireland due to its ties with France and James. The Irish army, disorganized and scattered, faced the invasion by General Schomberg. The siege of Carrickfergus showcased Irish resilience, but the lack of unity and strategic planning hindered their efforts against the incoming English forces.|"[""1.

Schomberg cautiously moved south and found the land wasted and deserted. The Protestants had fled to Derry and Enniskillen, while the Catholics abandoned their homes. Troops had burned everything, leaving Schomberg's army reliant on the fleet for supplies. Three Enniskillen horse regiments joined him, resembling Italian bandits with no uniformity. They were fierce and swift, plundering both Protestants and Catholics. Troops from Derry were similar, undisciplined but fierce. Dublin faced confusion as the Irish army gathered at Drogheda. Schomberg retreated, forming a camp near Dundalk. He lamented King James' actions, blaming French interference for ruining their cause. The missed opportunities and blunders were disheartening.

The men embraced their loved ones and rode off into the dark. Captain Davenant led his troop to Dublin, then on to Drogheda. The army moved north to Dundalk, but Schomberg refused to fight.

In early February of 1690, Brigadier Wolseley led a group of Enniskilleners and English soldiers to march against Cavan. James, lacking the resources to oppose Schomberg's army, saw Brigadier Wolseley's forces recover swiftly. Despite Duke Berwick's attempt to defend Cavan with infantry and cavalry, the English troops held their ground. The battle resulted in the Irish retreating to a nearby fort. The English and Enniskilleners then entered Cavan, looting the town. Duke Berwick, realizing the situation, attacked the English but faced significant losses. Brigadier Wolseley, struggling to control his troops, set parts of the town on fire to repel the Irish. The Irish, led by Teigue O'Regan, defended Charlemont until May 14th, when they surrendered due to lack of provisions. The garrison was allowed to leave with their belongings. King William was assembling a diverse army from various European nations, totaling forty-three thousand soldiers, including foreigners.|"['1.

King William landed at Carrickfergus on the 14th of June. The combined army began marching south. King James had only twenty thousand men, six thousand of whom were French. The French troops, led by the Count de Lauzun, had not increased King James's forces. He had to send an equal number of his best soldiers to France in exchange. The Irish horse was excellent, but the infantry was poorly armed, and they had only twelve guns from France. Captain Davenant and Walter left for the front, fearing the outcome. Captain Davenant asked Jabez to look after his family if he didn't return. The Irish army moved to the Boyne, where William was approaching from the north. James's officers advised him to delay the battle and wait for reinforcements from France. They believed in prolonging the war to wear out the enemy and wait for the climate to turn in their favor.|"[""1.

James, who had been timid, suddenly felt brave. Despite his previous cowardice at Derry and Dundalk, he now wanted to fight, ignoring advice. However, he took precautions for his safety, sending baggage to France. William, eager for battle, faced discontent on the English throne. In Scotland, Jacobite support grew, threatening William. The Irish army held a strong position at the Boyne. William carefully observed the Irish forces, preparing to cross the river. While observing, shots were fired, narrowly missing William. The Irish almost changed history with a shot that grazed William's shoulder.|"[""1.

The news quickly spread through the armies that the king had been injured, but the wound was minor. To reassure his troops, the king rode calmly through the camps. Later, a war council was called. The Duke of Schomberg suggested a strategic move towards Dublin to force the enemy into a less favorable position. However, the king, confident in his troops and numbers, decided to attack immediately to resolve the situation swiftly. Schomberg proposed occupying the pass of Slane to cut off the enemy's retreat, but the king knew it would require his full force to dislodge the Irish from their position. The battle plan was set with the right wing crossing the river at Slane, the left penetrating between the Irish right and Drogheda, and the center forcing the river passage at Old Bridge. The morning of the battle arrived, and the English troops advanced towards Slane, encountering little resistance. The Irish skirmishers fell back, leading to a standoff near a bog. William's Dutch guards bravely crossed the river at Old Bridge, facing Irish infantry and cavalry on the opposite bank.|"['1.

The Dutch soldiers advanced undisturbed until they reached the middle of the river. Irish skirmishers then attacked them with gunfire, but the Dutch remained steady and crossed to the other side. They quickly formed up, and the skirmishers retreated. Suddenly, Irish horsemen charged at full speed, but the Dutch held their ground against the fierce attacks. William sent French and British regiments to support the Dutch. A fierce fight erupted in the river between the French and Irish troops. Despite the challenges, the Dutch guards advanced slowly, facing tough resistance from the Irish infantry and cavalry. The battle continued with the Irish showing great determination and courage. Eventually, the Irish forces gained the upper hand, breaking the French infantry and Danish cavalry. The Irish cavalry's relentless attacks caused chaos among the enemy forces.|"['1.

During the battle of the Boyne, the Irish cavalry displayed remarkable superiority over the British forces. They even managed to break and destroy regiments of infantry. When the entire army retreated, the Irish cavalry skillfully held the rear, preventing any pursuit attempts. The battle was fought more to cover a retreat than to defend a position. Despite estimated losses of about five hundred on each side, the Irish forces outperformed the British, maintaining their ground against a superior enemy. King James, however, displayed cowardice by fleeing the battlefield before the fight began, leaving his troops leaderless. His flight actually worked in favor of William, who offered favorable terms to Ireland for submission. The troops, relieved by James's departure, felt empowered to face the invaders without his interference.|"['1.

As darkness fell, Walter rode to Bray without trouble. His safe return brought immense relief to the anxious ladies who feared for their loved ones after the battle. Rumors of King James's defeat had spread, but Walter's news of their safety eased their worries. They hoped for a better fight without the king's interference and with French officers gone. Walter shared with Godfrey the grim reality of war, where excitement during battle masks the danger, leaving behind the sorrow of fallen comrades. Walter, now in civilian clothes, cautiously navigated through Dublin's chaos to continue his journey west. The city was in turmoil, with Protestants celebrating William's victory and Catholics fleeing for safety. Walter rode on, witnessing the stark contrast in emotions between the two groups.|"[""1.

As Walter traveled through a village, he stumbled upon a chaotic scene. A group of Protestants had caused a commotion by knocking down a woman holding a child, leading to a clash with angry villagers. The situation escalated with both sides wielding weapons and engaging in a fierce fight. Witnessing the intense animosity between the Irish factions, Walter decided not to intervene and circumvented the village. He continued his journey, avoiding towns and villages, and seeking shelter with a peasant away from the main road. The next day, he caught up with King William's army in Dublin, where the King issued a proclamation offering protection to those who complied with his rule. Jabez Whitefoot considered seeking protection for Captain Davenant's family but refrained upon learning that Catholics were not to be persecuted. As the Irish army moved towards Athlone and Limerick, William prepared to pursue them, dividing his forces accordingly. Despite the protections granted, soldiers on both sides engaged in rampant plunder and violence, with only the Dutch troops maintaining discipline. The brutality and disregard for protections led to widespread suffering among the civilian population, with Protestant inhabitants bearing the brunt of the atrocities.|"['1.

The news that General Sarsfield was marching with a large army to block the siege of Athlone led General Douglas to quickly retreat. He left behind all heavy baggage and took unfrequented paths to avoid being cut off. The Protestant residents feared Irish retaliation and followed the retreating column. Meanwhile, in Dublin, a commission was seizing Catholic and King James supporters' lands. The English king, facing unrest in Dublin and better news from England, decided to return home but later rejoined his army heading towards Limerick. Limerick, the second city in Ireland, was well defended with natural barriers and strong fortifications. The English town, connected by bridges, was almost impregnable. The king slowly approached the city, leveling enclosures, while the Irish infantry put up a fierce defense. Dissensions among the Irish and French within the city aided the English king's strategy.|"['1.

Walter had been granted permission by Captain Davenant to lead a rescue mission if the signal was given. He quickly organized a group of twenty-five men and set up a system with the sentry to alert them if the signal appeared. The men were instructed to be ready at all times to launch the boats and cross the river upon hearing the signal. Walter received a note from Miss Conyers, expressing gratitude and reassurance. Days passed with quiet anticipation until a pistol shot broke the silence, signaling the need for immediate action. The troops swiftly prepared to cross the river to rescue the Conyers family from a troop of Hessian horsemen who had threatened them. The men, fueled by a desire for justice and vengeance, eagerly rowed across the river under Walter's command to confront the enemy.|"['1.

"""We need a surprise,"" Walter explained. ""We can sneak around to the back of the house unseen. With a sudden burst in, we can clear the house and hold it until my father arrives with reinforcements."" As they entered, they found a maid shot by a Hessian trooper. Walter swiftly took down the trooper before he could react. The Irish then charged into the hall where the troopers were gathered. A fierce fight broke out, but the Irish prevailed.

Walter and his troopers bravely defended their position against the overwhelming Hessian forces. Despite being outnumbered, they fought fiercely, but the situation became dire as the enemy almost breached their defenses. Walter, with his quick thinking, strategically positioned his men to hold off the attackers. Just as it seemed they might be overwhelmed, Walter's father and reinforcements arrived, turning the tide of the battle. The Hessians, caught off guard, fled in disarray. Walter, injured but alive, was tended to by his father and the troopers. With the threat of more enemy forces approaching, Captain Davenant made the decision to retreat, ensuring the safety of his men and the wounded.

Captain Davenant was asked about Walter's condition by Claire, who was eager for news. The captain quickly went downstairs where the wounded soldiers were being attended to. There were four seriously injured men who couldn't walk and six who had lost their lives in the fight. Walter was among the wounded, lying on blankets. Men were ready to carry them to safety. Captain Davenant then asked Mrs. Conyers to point out her valuables so they could be taken to safety before the enemy arrived. Mrs. Conyers identified two chests containing important documents and silverware. The items were quickly secured by men. As they made their way to the boats, Captain Davenant informed Mrs. Conyers of the plan to protect the house from being set on fire by the enemy. He explained that their timely rescue was all thanks to his son's clever arrangements. Walter had taken charge of the situation and led the initial rescue party across the river.

Mrs. Conyers expressed gratitude, thanking Walter for saving their lives during a dangerous situation. She appointed Mrs. Conyers as head of the hospital and arranged for the wounded to be moved to a nearby cottage. Walter, injured by a sword, was advised to rest. Mrs. Conyers promised lifelong gratitude for Walter's heroic actions, hoping her husband could thank him in the future. She then became Walter's nurse, ensuring he rested and providing care. The surgeon later arrived, assessing the wounded. Walter's wound was severe but not life-threatening. The surgeon believed Walter's injury would heal, as the sword had not struck directly on the shoulder bone. Larry stayed by Walter's side, while Mrs. Conyers tended to the other wounded.|"['1.

After treating the most severe injuries, Captain Davenant tended to the wounds of the other men. Some of these wounds were as serious as Walter's, yet the men were still able to make their way to the boats. Captain Davenant kept an eye on the Hall and, seeing no signs of danger, assured Mrs. Conyers that it was safe. He suggested that she and her daughter accompany him to Limerick to join her husband, but Mrs. Conyers refused. She felt it was her duty to care for the injured men and expressed her strong disapproval of the actions of William's troops. Mrs. Conyers wrote a letter to her husband detailing the events and decided to remain on their side of the Shannon. The letter was delivered to Limerick by Captain Davenant, who was praised for his bravery in the recent raid. Walter's condition worsened, and he became delirious. Mrs. Conyers realized that Walter and her daughter, Claire, had developed feelings for each other, leading to her concerns about their future.|"[""1.

Mr. Conyers received a letter from his wife on the same day he was meeting with the king. An officer informed them that Irish troops attacked a group of Hessians at a large house near their regiment's location. Conyers suspected it might be their house and, upon investigation, found it empty with casualties inside. The attackers were Irish soldiers, not peasants, which eased his fears. Unfortunately, one of the servants was killed. The enemy escaped with the Hessians' horses, but the king was enraged by the incident. Conyers assured his wife of his changed sentiments towards the soldiers, who he now sees as her saviors. He plans for her to go to Galway and then to England, where he will join her. He also arranged to halt the confiscation of Captain Davenant's estate and expressed gratitude to the Davenants through his wife.|"['1.

Captain Davenant ordered the men to dismount and rest while the horses fed. They had a long ride ahead that night. The mission was to ambush William's siege artillery, which was poorly escorted. Sarsfield planned to attack from the rear and show that Limerick was not an easy target. A deserter revealed William's camp position, allowing Irish artillery to harass them. At night, Sarsfield led 400 cavalry to Killaloe, then circled behind William's camp in Tipperary mountains. A local, O'Brian, informed William of the Irish troops' movement, but the information was initially disregarded. Eventually, the king acted, dispatching cavalry to protect the artillery. Sarsfield's men ambushed and destroyed the siege train, frustrating William's plans.|"[""1.

The king discovered that despite Sarsfield's efforts, two guns survived the explosion. These guns were brought back to camp, and another heavy gun was acquired from Waterford along with some ammunition. The soldiers were immediately put to work making fascines for the siege, using wood from the orchards and plantations. The fascines were used to fill ditches, and the attack on the town continued with vigor. The besiegers faced resistance from the town's defenders, who fired constantly from the walls and launched attacks on the working parties. The heavy guns were positioned close to the wall and started bombarding it. The Irish commanders' disagreements persisted, and little was done to disrupt the enemy from the rear. William regretted the lack of British troops due to doubts about their loyalty and bravery. Walter's recovery was swift, and he was soon up and conversing with Claire, who was relieved to see him doing better.|"['1.

On the left, the grenadiers were supported by the Danish regiments, and a large body of cavalry waited to move in behind the infantry. Lieutenant General Douglas led the storming parties. At three o'clock in the afternoon, three cannons signaled the assault. The grenadiers leaped from the trenches and advanced towards the breach. Before attacking, they threw hand grenades at the defenders. The Irish were ready to defend. The town buzzed with excitement. The assault began amid a tense silence. The grenadiers faced intense fire but pressed on. They fought bravely, entering the town. However, they were met with fierce resistance. The grenadiers were eventually forced to retreat, facing attacks from all sides. Despite their efforts, they were overwhelmed. The conflict lasted for hours. Other regiments failed to provide support. In another part of the battle, a regiment of Brandenburghers faced a tragic end. William observed from afar, not leading the assault.

The attackers suffered heavy losses, with over two thousand of William's best soldiers perishing. The defeat shocked the troops, who were eager to redeem themselves the next day, but the king decided to abandon the siege. Due to the lack of wagons and horses from a previous attack, wounded soldiers had to walk, and supplies were left behind. The Protestant population of Limerick and surrounding areas, fearing reprisals, joined the army in retreat. The Protestants had sided with William, believing in his victory but faced misery as they fled their homes. William's army, left undisciplined, resorted to looting. Despite the siege of Limerick ending, the Irish remained undeterred, having staved off William's forces in previous battles. William left for Waterford, leaving chaos in his army.

The location of Cork, surrounded by the river Lea, was once deemed impregnable without artillery. The city was enclosed by the river and marshes, making it vulnerable from the high hills on three sides. The garrison was small and unprepared for Marlborough's attack. Despite the initial resistance, the city fell after a breach was made in the walls. The garrison, realizing defeat was imminent, offered to surrender under certain conditions, but Marlborough refused. The English and Danes advanced through marshes and river to breach the walls. Eventually, the garrison surrendered, and the city was spared from destruction. However, upon entering the city, the British forces, incited by a Protestant mob, looted and attacked the Catholic residents. Marlborough and Wirtemberg intervened to restore order, but the incident tarnished their reputation.|"['1.

In October, Marlborough began the siege of Kinsale. He sent troops towards the town and marched there the next day. Kinsale had two strong forts, the Old Fort and Charles's Fort, well stocked for a siege. The governor set fire to the town and retreated to the forts, refusing to surrender. Marlborough's forces attacked the Old Fort, facing strong resistance until a lucky explosion weakened the defenses. The governor then retreated to Charles's Fort. Marlborough besieged this fort, facing resistance for fifteen days. Eventually, the governor surrendered, and Marlborough accepted the terms. Winter halted operations, but skirmishes continued. In Dublin, Catholics faced confiscation. General Ginckle launched an expedition into the southwest of Ireland, capturing several castles. Despite some resistance, the English forces made progress. Ginckle sought to offer pardon and security to encourage surrender, but the ruling party in Dublin resisted, prolonging the conflict. Captain Davenant tasked his son with a mission to Dublin to gather information and communicate with allies.|"['1.

Despite the provocation, Walter cautioned Larry against getting into a fight, emphasizing their mission's importance. Walter then met a merchant to deliver a secret message.

It all hinged on the possibility of an Irish army advancing in their direction. If that were the case, around seven or eight thousand men would mobilize. However, without the hope of prompt assistance, relying on more than a thousand seemed unlikely. There were approximately a thousand men on the list, but they couldn't act alone. Currently, there were three to four thousand troops present, and if the Protestant mob joined, their numbers would swell to seven or eight thousand at least. Consequently, attempting a rebellion under such circumstances, unless William's troops suffered a significant defeat, was unfeasible. Yet, if an army approached Dublin, the Protestants would prioritize fleeing on ships over fighting, prompting all Catholics in the city to unite. Mr. O'Brian expressed concerns about the diminished numbers and spirit due to ongoing persecution, making any insurrection challenging. Walter learned from various sources that the prevailing sentiment among the populace was one of deep-seated animosity towards the invaders, with a readiness to confront them. The critical requirement was arms, as many peasants had already enlisted in the army, leaving others with only makeshift weapons like pikes and scythes. While effective in surprise attacks on small groups, these arms were inadequate against substantial enemy forces, particularly those equipped with artillery. Plans for a coordinated uprising were discussed and postponed until the Irish army secured a notable victory, signaling a nationwide revolt supported by widespread fires and potential unrest in Dublin.

The fools acted recklessly, throwing stones and firing wildly, pushing Walter further up the river. Some ran after him, but he remained elusive. The black villain, known for delivering messages from Mr. O'Brian, led the group searching for Walter. Walter outwitted them by swimming underwater close to the bank, evading capture. After a meal, Walter regained strength and energy. They decided to avoid English troops by trekking across the countryside to join the Irish army. Walter reported to General Sarsfield about his escape from Dublin and the betrayal of their plans. Despite setbacks, the general assured Walter that their captured friends would remain under suspicion, unable to interfere. Both Irish and British armies received reinforcements from France and England, causing discontent among the Irish due to unfulfilled promises. The lack of support from France and the exchange of Irish prisoners for Dutch captives fueled frustration among the Irish soldiers.|"['1.

The discontent among the Irish army was so great that they would have disbanded and ceased all resistance if a proclamation of pardon and protection had been offered. However, Louis, alarmed by the possibility of William focusing on the war on the Continent, sent promises of aid and appointed General Saint Ruth to command in Ireland. This appointment caused further discontent among the Irish, who had hoped for Sarsfield to lead. Saint Ruth inspected the army between Limerick and Athlone, which lacked horses. To address this, he called upon the gentry to provide their best horses. Despite protests, the gentlemen had to surrender their horses, allowing Saint Ruth to lead a well-equipped force towards Athlone. Ginckle's forces attacked Ballymore before moving towards Athlone, where the Irish put up a valiant defense but eventually had to abandon part of the town due to heavy artillery.|"[""1.

The British soldiers entered the eastern town to find it in ruins, with fallen soldiers scattered among the wreckage. Despite the heavy cost of taking this part of Athlone, they were still separated from the Irish town by the Shannon River. The bridge's western arch had been destroyed by the defenders. To continue their assault, eleven large guns and three mortars were brought in from Dublin. Batteries were set up on the ruins, bombarding the Athlone castle until it crumbled. The English forces faced fierce resistance, with a mill set ablaze, trapping and burning sixty soldiers inside. Despite continuous artillery fire, the Irish town's city walls stood firm. Eventually, the besiegers attempted to build a wooden gallery over the broken bridge arch to force their way across, facing heavy resistance from the Irish defenders. After a daring and heroic effort by two sergeants and twenty men, the bridge was destroyed, leading to a council of war to plan their next move.|"['1.

The French deserters informed the Irish of the English camp's activities. Early on the day of the assault, strong divisions of the Irish army marched from the camp into the town, ready to repulse the attack. The Irish guns fired at the English grenadiers carrying the bridge, but they managed to throw the platform across the broken arch. The grenadiers then hurled grenades at each other. An explosion set the English breastwork on fire, causing chaos. Despite a failed attempt, a council of war decided on another assault at dawn. The Irish, misled by a ruse, were caught off guard as the British columns swiftly advanced and captured the town. The Irish officers' warnings were ignored, leading to the loss of the town. This turn of events altered the course of history, emphasizing the challenges of subduing Ireland and the need for resolution.|"[""1.

The Irish army did not feel defeated despite the outcome of the sieges. They were eager to prove themselves in battle and believed they could match King William's mercenaries. Despite efforts to dissuade them, the army remained resolute. While some troops engaged in raids, others stayed near Athlone. Captain Davenant suggested disrupting enemy communications but faced obstacles. The Irish cavalry's inactivity during sieges puzzled many. Possible reasons include Sarsfield's lack of military genius, French commanders' jealousy, or a deliberate choice to remain inactive. On a mission, Captain Davenant's troops intercepted a convoy. They spared non-combatant drivers like John, who shared news of turmoil near Dublin. Despite challenges, they persevered in their efforts.|"[""1.

My grandfather had strong prejudices against Catholics, even wishing to eradicate them. This led to conflicts with my father, who he saw as a backslider. Despite the sufferings of Protestants, my grandfather remained unmoved, believing sacrifices were necessary for the Lord's work. This troubled me deeply. Tensions escalated when my grandfather confronted soldiers plundering Protestants, pointing out Catholics nearby. In response, my father rallied armed men, both Catholics and Protestants, to confront the soldiers. An intense standoff ensued at the castle, where my grandfather, influenced by extreme religious fervor, berated the ladies. Fortunately, my father intervened to prevent a violent outcome, opting to seek justice through legal means rather than vigilante justice. His actions prevented further bloodshed and chaos in the region.|"['1.

After convincing the angry tenants and peasantry to abandon their plans of vengeance, my father approached the soldiers, who were bound and expecting the worst. He ordered their weapons and ammunition to be confiscated, released their bonds, and warned them that they narrowly escaped punishment. The captured soldiers were inspected to ensure they carried no stolen goods before being allowed to ride off. Later, my father, accompanied by three Protestant and three Catholic tenants, reported the incident to the general. The culprits were identified, flogged, and warned of severe consequences for future misconduct. The general also stationed a guard at Davenant Castle for protection. Walter expressed gratitude for the timely intervention, acknowledging that the castle would have suffered more if not for their help. John shared that his grandfather, deeply affected by the events, had changed drastically. He lamented the distorted religious beliefs held by his grandfather and his peers, contrasting them with his own upbringing based on the New Testament teachings. The troops then set fire to the wagons to prevent them from aiding the English army, took some horses, and rode off safely to Athlone.|"[""1.

After the fall of the city, Ginckle stayed inactive for some time. However, realizing that his call for surrender had no effect on the Irish, he reluctantly decided to advance against them. During this time, he repaired the western city wall and was joined by additional regiments. With a larger force than when he first besieged Athlone, Ginckle moved forward. Saint Ruth strategically positioned his camp along the Kilcomeden hills, protected by natural barriers. The Irish were now superior in numbers and artillery compared to previous battles. On the morning of July 12th, the British army approached the Irish camp surrounded by a bog. The Irish prepared for battle with a religious service. As the fog lifted, the British advanced but were met with strong resistance from the Irish cavalry. After a series of clashes, the British regrouped and prepared for another attack. Ginckle, noticing the strong Irish defense, called for a council of war to decide the next steps.|"['1.

But other advice eventually won. The request for the tents was canceled, and, at half-past four, the British foot soldiers were directed to move forward. They advanced, in dense groups, over the area where the cavalry battle had occurred, and the Irish cavalry retreated behind their foot soldiers, who were positioned behind the sturdy hedges that crisscrossed the ground beyond the stream. A heavy gunfire started on the British foot soldiers as they advanced, but they moved forward, in unbroken formation, until they reached the hedges. These hedges were long and fiercely fought over. The Irish had made openings through the hedges to retreat, and as they fell back from one hedge to another, the advancing British were met with gunfire from hedges on both sides, as well as from the front. As the British sent regiment after regiment to attack, Saint Ruth shifted some groups of cavalry and foot soldiers from his left to support his right flank. This move had been anticipated by Ginckle, who now ordered several battalions of foot soldiers to cross the bog and attack the Irish center. At this spot, there was a path across the bog, or rather a place where the mud and water were not as deep as in other areas, and where it was possible to cross. Ginckle had found a local, who, for a large sum of money, revealed the passage. It traversed the bog at its narrowest point, with the hill of Kilcomeden extending a|['1.

During the battle at Aughrim, Ginckle's army faced challenges from the Irish forces led by Saint Ruth. In the midst of the conflict, a division of English and French troops crossed a bog without resistance until they reached the hedges where the Irish forces engaged them. Despite the Irish successes in repelling British attacks and preparing to charge, the tide turned when General Talmash led the English cavalry through a narrow passage under fire. Saint Ruth's confidence was shattered when a cannonball struck and killed him, causing chaos among the Irish troops who lacked leadership. As night fell, the Irish infantry retreated, while the cavalry covered their escape. The absence of a clear chain of command after Saint Ruth's death led to disarray among the Irish forces, ultimately contributing to their defeat.|"[""1.

Until the death of Saint Ruth, the British faced heavy losses with over two thousand men killed or wounded, while the Irish losses were minimal. However, in the subsequent conflict, the Irish, disorganized and fighting individually, suffered a significant loss estimated at seven thousand men by British accounts. This highlighted the brutal nature of the battle rather than a strategic defeat. Despite the Irish defeat, William and his troops were not emboldened by the victory. The Irish had proven themselves formidable opponents, matching the best of William's soldiers. The English were saved from a disastrous outcome by what seemed like a miracle, much like at Athlone. The defeat at Aughrim did not instill confidence in William, leading him to seek a peaceful resolution with the Irish. Ginckle, the British commander, offered generous terms to the Irish garrisons, allowing them to surrender and march to Limerick with dignity. Despite the defeat at Aughrim, the Irish army remained strong and divided on seeking peace. Ginckle, facing challenges and shortages, slowly advanced towards Limerick for a siege. The Irish, aware of French reinforcements, prepared for a prolonged resistance. Ginckle, facing difficulties, intensified his siege efforts, primarily targeting the English town. Despite fierce battles and attempts to breach the walls, progress was slow. The Irish cavalry protected the town, and engagements continued across the country.

The French fleet was expected soon, and the Irish, reinforced with men, arms, and supplies, were ready to resume the offensive. Ginckle decided to make one more effort before retreating. He communicated with Irish officers, like General Clifford, who were eager to end the war. Ginckle planned a feint at Kilmallock, repairing the works and sending baggage ahead. The Irish were misled to think the siege was ending. Meanwhile, Ginckle secretly crossed to an island with troops. The surprise attack caused panic in the Irish camp. Although Ginckle missed capturing many, the Irish were too bewildered to retaliate. Captain Davenant's troop suffered a surprise attack, scattering the cavalry. Walter and a few men saved saddles and scouted enemy movements. They thwarted an attack on a convoy but arrived too late to join the fight. Walter's troop returned to Kilcowan after chasing stragglers.|"[""1.

"""What will you do?"" he asked as the excitement of the welcome from the women towards the captors settled down a bit. ""A strong group will come tomorrow to punish you for this,"" he warned.

""It's the general's own rule, sir. Didn't he say his soldiers shouldn't take anything and would be punished if they did? He promised we'd be paid. He can't blame us,"" argued one of the villagers.

Walter advised, ""I'd leave the village for a few days. The general might not approve."" But the villagers were convinced the Dutch general would support them.

"Walter, resigned to his fate, watched an argument unfold with a glimmer of hope. However, when the colonel intervened and ordered two troopers to seize him, Walter's hope faded.

"""Ginckle has reconsidered,"" he said. ""I thought he wouldn't risk escalating things further, as losing his most reliable division would ruin his chances in the campaign.

Colonel L'Estrange expressed his concerns to Walter about the challenging situation they were facing. He mentioned the impending arrival of ten thousand French troops in Limerick, emphasizing the importance of the Irish choosing to align with England for religious equality and security. Walter agreed that most Irish would prefer peace if promises were upheld, despite the oppression they faced. Colonel L'Estrange cautioned against trusting France, highlighting the potential negative outcomes under French rule. Walter acknowledged the hatred towards the French and the preference for England. As Walter prepared to head to Mulroon for guidance, Colonel L'Estrange advised him to avoid potential dangers by traveling at night.

When Walter shared the brutal punishment of the peasants who defended their land against marauders, anger spread in the camp. The fury grew when a cavalry officer faced a similar fate after being captured in a fair fight. The soldiers and officers were so enraged that they were ready to retaliate immediately, despite being unable to do so. Despite the successful surprise attack by Ginckle, the British forces faced a tough challenge at Thomond Bridge. The cavalry and infantry crossed the bridge without resistance, but as they approached, they were met with a fierce defense by the Irish. The British soldiers fought bravely, inching forward despite heavy losses, determined to secure victory. Ultimately, the Irish forces were overwhelmed, and the British emerged victorious, forcing the Irish to retreat.|"[""1. What incited anger among the soldiers and officers in the camp?\nA.

Ginckle, relying on the impact of his recent actions, resumed negotiations. Some Irish leaders had accepted bribes, while others genuinely desired an end to the war now that William was willing to offer terms aligning with their goals. Some were motivated by animosity towards the French, fearing Ireland would become a mere French territory if the English were driven out. Sarsfield was influenced by his aversion to being replaced by another French general and feared a repeat of treachery like Clifford's. Following a parley, a ceasefire was agreed upon for the night, extending to three days to communicate with the cavalry. Prisoners were exchanged, and terms proposed, including pardoning past offenses, restoring Catholic estates, and allowing freedom of worship. The Irish agreed to the terms, leading to the disbandment of troops, with some joining the British army, others returning home, and many opting for French service. The French fleet arrived shortly after the treaty was signed, but those who joined the French service faced unfavorable conditions. Captain Davenant's troop chose to return home, highlighting the importance of loyalty to one's country.|"[""1.
