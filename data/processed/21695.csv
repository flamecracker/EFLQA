"""I don't need alcohol, Molly,"" said Dashwood with a smile, as he went into the large cupboard; ""at my age, a man must be a pitiable, half-alive sort of creature if he can't manage without Dutch courage. Seeing your face and May's here is better than a strong drink to me any day. It makes me feel stronger than the toughest man in the brigade. Good night, lass, or good morning. I need to make the most of my time. You never know when the next call may come. It seems like people are setting their houses on fire on purpose to trouble us."" Mrs. Dashwood continued washing quietly. Delicate undergarments, small socks, and tiny clothes for the baby passed through Mary's hands swiftly, coming out of the tub clean as snow.

"We are straying from our point as the engine races along Bayswater Road. Suddenly, it sharply turns near Notting Hill Gate, almost tipping over, causing Bob Clazie to calmly remark, ""Pretty close call that time, Joe."" A glaring light appears over the house-tops, signaling the engine's arrival at Ladbroke Square where a grand mansion is ablaze. The engine screeches to a stop, the exhausted horses are led away, and the firefighters spring into action with practiced efficiency.

"Before the engine from Regent Street arrived, two manual engines from Kensington and Notting Hill had already reached the scene. They began spraying water on the fire, but their efforts initially had little impact. As the ""steamer"" engine prepared to join the fight, the situation changed. When the powerful water stream started gushing through the windows, mixing with the smoke and steam, the fire's intensity seemed undiminished. Another manual engine rushed in, followed by a ""steamer"" with three horses. The firefighters swiftly connected hoses to water sources, ensuring multiple engines could work together efficiently. London's firefighters strategically maneuvered amid the chaos, seeking weak spots in the fire and attacking it from all angles. Hose lines snaked through buildings, and water cascaded onto the flames from various directions. The fire-escape, managed by David Clazie, was the first to respond to the emergency. David, with the help of others, rescued trapped individuals from the burning building using the escape ladder.

The firemen, wearing sailor's caps, headed towards the city and arrived at a large open area with old houses being demolished for new ones. The Fire-Brigade was practicing there until new construction began. The yard was cluttered with debris, fire-escapes, and manual engines. Young, strong recruits were undergoing training under the supervision of experienced officers. The chief demonstrated how to handle the hose without kinks to prevent bursting. The recruits were then tasked to simulate putting out a fire on the third floor. They swiftly coiled and connected the hose, set up equipment, and prepared to fight the imaginary flames. Nearby, other recruits were trained on fire-escape use. Onlookers, including Philip Sparks and the Bloater, observed the drills. Little Jim's expressions were closely watched as they headed to their watch duty near the fire-station.|"[""1.

The Bloater, known for his unique smile, shared his opinion with Jim about a possible fire-raising incident at Number 5. He suggested they might have to chase the culprit if he attempted to escape. As night fell, the firemen at the nearby station were prepared for action, with engines and equipment ready. The two boys observed the station, engaging in their own discussions and even teasing the fireman Bob Clazie. As the night progressed, the firemen relaxed but remained alert for emergencies. A false alarm led to little Jim showing restraint and the fire being quickly extinguished by the fireman with a hand engine. The Bloater cautioned Jim against being too witty and urged him to remain serious due to the seriousness of the situation. Later, Mr. Sparks and his friend Jeff appeared, engaging in secretive conversation before disappearing, leaving the boys intrigued.|['1.

The two boys, Robert and Jim, were active but unable to find a good spot to spy on the mysterious men near Joe Dashwood's house. Jim sneaked closer and eavesdropped on the men's plan. They were not planning to flee after setting fire; instead, they intended to alert the station and help put out the fire. Joe, unaware of the danger, was peacefully asleep with his son Fred and the Rosebud. Joe, tired but unable to sleep, lit his pipe and dozed off. Suddenly, he awoke to the smell of smoke. His firefighter instincts kicked in, and he sprang into action, ready to face the fire threatening his home.|"[""1.

Joe reacted swiftly to the danger as dense smoke and flames filled the room. He grabbed his wife, child, and bedclothes and rushed towards the back door. Bob, a neighbor, burst in with a branch to help. Meanwhile, Fred, noticing trouble, aimed the hose at Jeff, who was causing chaos. Jeff was washed down the stairs by the force of water. Mr. Sparks, trying to escape, was pursued by two boys and the police. The chase led through narrow streets until Sparks sought refuge in Martha Reading's room. The boys followed, surprising everyone. In a sudden move, they dashed out, shouting for help as the crowd closed in.|"['1.

"""Follow me this way!"" he cheered, guiding the group towards the river. The crowd obediently trailed behind. The Bloater navigated them through a complex network of narrow streets, darting ahead and then doubling back like a hare to a secluded corner, where he chuckled as the noisy crowd passed by.

Meanwhile, Bob Clazie sat comfortably by the fire in Joe Dashwood's new home, as the old one was uninhabitable. Chatting and puffing on his pipe, he explained to a puzzled Mrs. Dashwood, ""That's how it is, you see?""

Mary, knitting her brows, interjected, ""I don't get it. Why would anyone benefit from setting a house on fire, except for pickpockets taking advantage of the chaos?""

Bob Clazie elaborated, ""Let me explain. There are scoundrels who orchestrate fires to profit. They choose houses far from fire stations, furnish them, then insure the property. After removing most furniture discreetly, they set the house ablaze, often escaping in nightclothes. They claim insurance, making a profit and selling the remaining furniture. This is one way fires are started, right Joe?""

Joe nodded in agreement, ""Indeed, that's one method. There are also desperate individuals like struggling tradesmen who, when in dire need of money, see arson as a solution. Unable to sell their goods due to debts, they burn down their insured stock. The insurance companies compensate,"|"[""1.

Mary was furious at the thought of arson and expressed her desire to see those who set fire to their homes punished severely. Despite the chaos caused by a mishap involving Master Fred Crashington, no one was injured. The Bloater, a mysterious figure, appeared and hinted at knowing Mr. Sparks, a troublemaker. Mrs. Dashwood, desperate for justice, urged the Bloater to turn Mr. Sparks over to the police. However, the Bloater remained noncommittal, emphasizing his disdain for bribery. He left abruptly, leaving Mrs. Dashwood wondering if her friend Martha Reading shared her sentiments. The Bloater's unexpected visit to Martha's place left her sewing and in tears.|"[""1.

"""That's cutting it close, isn't it?"" remarked the Bloater, arching one eyebrow and turning to Little Jim. But Little Jim, moved by the girl's sadness and captivated by her expression, had forgotten about his companion. Approaching her, he placed his hand on her knee and gazed up at her face. The Bloater then grabbed Little Jim by the collar, pulled him outside, and rushed him along. Releasing him briefly, he said, ""Now, Jim, we're going to visit another place."" They walked through narrow streets leading to the Thames, with warehouses looming above. The streets had a maritime vibe, with old timber and cordage scattered about.

In under three minutes, the West-End engine bolted like a rocket, urged by the crack of a whip, snorts from the steeds, and shouts to clear the way. Two bystanders raced alongside, eyes gleaming, cheeks flushed. The Bloater and Little Jim had heard of a fire at Saint Katharine's Docks and sprinted to witness the battle.

After the great fire at the docks was finally subdued, the loss was immense. A hundred thousand pounds did not cover it, and every insurance office in London suffered. Sadly, several lives were lost, and the Red Brigade mourned the loss of one of their best men. Despite the bustling nature of London, the funeral procession for the fallen fireman, Ned, drew hundreds of thousands of people. Ned's coffin, adorned with his helmet and hatchet, was drawn on an engine, followed by his brigade in uniform. The procession was a touching tribute to the self-sacrificing fireman. Over the years, the Red Brigade remained steadfast, with familiar faces like Joe Dashwood and Bob Clazie. The men gathered at the West-end station, chatting happily.
