"Poetry is the special language of childhood and youth. Babies repeat words for the sheer joy of their sound, while the melody of nursery rhymes brings delight regardless of their meaning. As youth nears maturity, there is an equal pleasure in the elegant prose. It is during childhood that young minds should be filled with poems. The selections for younger students focus on the beauty of words, which is fundamental for this work. Critical notes are excluded from these books for elementary students to keep the focus on the text. Reading poems aloud is the best way to teach children to love them. French wisdom states, ""The ear is the pathway to the heart."" Poems should be read in a way that lets them sing in the hearts of the children. The brief biographies in later books highlight the human side of poets, emphasizing their education and life work over their literary style."|"[""1.

Greetings to the abundant month of May, bringing joy, youth, and warm desires! The woods and fields adorned by your touch, hills and valleys rejoice in your blessings. We sing to welcome you, wishing you a long stay. My heart belongs to the Highlands, chasing deer and following the roe. Farewell to the Highlands, the land of valor and worth, forever cherished.

Soldier, rest now, your battles over, dream peacefully in our enchanted hall. No more sounds of war, just the lark's fife at daybreak and the bittern's drum.

Athens, except for that sparkle, your name had faded from my memory! But a sudden surge of energy reignited my passion as I raced back, determined not to waste a moment on the false and vile.

"The initial snowfall was a sight to behold, descending silently throughout the day and night, covering the mountains, meadows, living rooftops, and graves in a pristine white blanket.
