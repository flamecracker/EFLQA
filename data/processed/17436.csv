Marshall, it will be challenging to save money while in India. The pay is enough to live comfortably, but saving is tough. During the campaign, expenses will be low as we will rely on rations.

The infantry advanced by keeping up a continuous fire at the walls' loopholes. The enemy's fire weakened as they neared, allowing them to breach the walls and enter the city. A brief pause was made for the troops to regroup before continuing the advance. The defenders, reinforced by troops around the Palace, retreated towards the city, resisting briefly at strategic points. Eventually, they were driven to the Martiniere College, where they made a stand but were forced out. Sir Colin set up headquarters at Dilkoosha, with troops bivouacking nearby. The officers, after ensuring the men's comfort, gathered on the college's roof to observe the town. The Residency, with the British flag flying, was visible, along with large buildings acting as fortresses. The Major noted the challenge of breaching these thick brick walls.

In early February, the ranks were replenished with soldiers from England. Despite the exhausting work, the men remained healthy due to the constant excitement. Two companies returning after six weeks found letters waiting, their first since leaving England. Captain Mallett received a letter from Sir John Greendale expressing joy at their safety. The letter also mentioned the disappearance of Martha Bennett, suspected of being murdered. Another neighbor, Percy Carthew, had gone big game hunting in North America. The news of Delhi's capture and Lucknow's relief had calmed the general excitement. Letters from friends longing for battle and a message from his solicitor about a debt settlement were also received.|"['1.

A few days later, Frank Mallett was assigned to lead his company in a mission to confront rebels in a village twenty miles away. Armstrong, who was unwell, suggested Marshall take his place as they needed two subalterns for the operation. Marshall, who had shown bravery in previous battles, was chosen. The group, including Punjaub infantry and Sikh horsemen, set off in a different direction to maintain secrecy and surprise the rebels. Despite initial confusion about the route, the strategic decision was made to mislead potential informants and prevent the rebels from escaping.

The group began their march at four o'clock in the afternoon, planning to cover half the distance before nightfall. Frank proposed this strategy to ensure the men were fresh for the impending battle and to mislead any nearby villagers. They stopped at a grove to rest, carrying enough food for four days. Frank discussed their plan to attack the village at daybreak the next day, using surprise to their advantage. They prepared scaling ladders and gunpowder to breach the gate.

As they neared the gate, a shout erupted from the village, followed by shots from the wall. An explosion destroyed the gate, and troops rushed in. The village echoed with bugles, shouts, and cries. Mutineers emerged from houses, only to be met by the soldiers' bayonets. The Sepoys faced the British, but were swiftly overpowered. Captain Mallett and Marshall split the troops, attacking from both sides. The mutineers resisted, firing from houses until a Punjaubies' ambush turned the tide.

He recounted the moment of panic when facing the overwhelming Sepoys but found relief when discovering his comrades still standing. The close call highlighted the bravery of the men, with many casualties on both sides. Despite the losses, the Punjaubies and the British soldiers paid tribute to their fallen comrades with a solemn burial ceremony.

Captain Mallett returned to the hospital with a weaker stride than when he arrived. He questioned the sanity of the man who accused him and doubted the reality of the conversation he claimed to have overheard. Recalling George Lechmere's abrupt departure when he saw Mallett bid farewell to Martha, he pondered on the man's jealousy or madness.

I also need to check on my tenants and ensure everything is running smoothly. I anticipate spending about four to five months there annually.""

George continued, ""I have no interest in the city social scene. My father sold our townhouse, and I find society gatherings boring. I prefer spending time on the estate.

After an hour of discussion with his representative, Frank Mallett strolled to the farm with George. George's parents were both at home, an unusual sight at that time of day with his father. At breakfast, his father expressed his pleasure at seeing them so well. George's father praised his son for his bravery during the Mutiny, where he defended Frank's life against enemy cavalry, earning him the Victoria Cross. George's parents were proud and grateful upon learning the news. They had previously misunderstood George's intentions of enlisting and were relieved to discover his whereabouts and heroic actions. Frank acknowledged George's past struggles but believed the experience had transformed him for the better, earning him respect and popularity among his comrades.

"""You are not likely to meet him here, Squire. A year ago he happened to be over at Chippenham one market day. There were a dozen of us there, and I can tell you we gave him such a reception that he mounted his horse and rode straight on again. If he hadn't, I believe that we should have horsewhipped him through the town. Three months afterwards his estate was put up for sale, and he has never been down in this part of the country since; not that he was ever here much before. London suited him better.

Captain Mallett visited Lady Greendale and her daughter Bertha after being away for two and a half years. Bertha had transformed into a charming young woman. She was well-received in society and was considered a belle of the season due to her warmth and charm. During their meeting, Lady Greendale invited Captain Mallett to a dinner party as a guest, as another invitee had canceled. Captain Mallett gladly accepted the invitation as he had no prior engagements. He had recently joined a club and was starting to attend social events regularly.

"""I am amazed at how men can endure such a lifestyle,"" he remarked to a friend at the club. ""It's beyond me, Colonel. Going out to these crowded balls a few times a year might be enjoyable to see the dresses and girls, but going out night after night is worse to me than hunting rebels in the jungle. It's hot and not nearly as thrilling. I've only done it for three weeks, and I'm already sick of it.""

""Then why do you accept it, Mallett? I made sure to avoid it. What more could a man want? A well-cooked dinner with a friend, followed by a quiet card game. Occasionally, I attend a dinner party, which is a nice change. I prefer shooting in winter and being away for three months. You have plenty ahead of you beyond society and clubs. You'll settle down, marry, and perhaps become a magistrate. Luckily, my inheritance was in consols, not land. Country life would feel like exile to me.

The man, Major Mallett, strongly opposes gambling, particularly on racehorses, due to its ruinous effects. He shares a story of a fellow officer saved from ruin by cutting ties with betting. Major Mallett believes gambling is as harmful as drinking and despises it. Bertha finds Major Mallett's strong opinion refreshing in London, where people seem indifferent. She contrasts the vibrant country dances to the lackluster city ones, where people dance as a duty.

Mallett explained that he wanted to prepare the crew and the boat before racing. He preferred fewer skilled crew members over a crowded boat.

Bertha commented on the new steps aboard the boat, noting that they were more comfortable than the old ones.

The next day, George asked Major if everything was alright in town. Major seemed different since boarding. Major confessed he had hoped to marry Miss Greendale, but she only saw him as a cousin. Major knew Miss Greendale since she was young and didn't want her to marry Carthew due to his questionable past. George suggested Major tell Miss Greendale about Martha to ruin Carthew's reputation.

Frank pondered the situation silently. He had contemplated it thoroughly and concluded that he should not intervene. Had he not proposed to Bertha and been rejected, he might have acted differently. Until then, he had been seen as a family friend and could have advised Lady Greendale on Bertha's happiness. But now, any action on his part might be misconstrued as that of a jilted suitor rather than a concerned friend. After much thought, he decided it was his duty to speak up. Despite the potential backlash and the likelihood that his words might not sway Bertha's feelings, he felt compelled to inform Lady Greendale.

Despite the Major's reluctance to share the full story due to lack of concrete evidence, another person decided to disclose the truth to prevent Miss Greendale from being entangled with the villain.

Yes, we observed the unfamiliar craft as it passed by, lowering a boat with two men who landed briefly. The boat was hoisted back up, and the craft continued eastward. After a stop at Seaview, it returned to shore, this time sending two different men ashore. There seemed to be some mystery and curiosity surrounding the craft among the yachts. George, upon receiving this information, promptly sent a detailed report to London. Frank, upon learning of a possible abduction, took swift action by contacting Lloyd's to send telegrams along the coast for any sightings of the craft. The responses indicated the craft was heading west towards the Mediterranean. It was suggested that the craft may have been altered to avoid suspicion. The next likely sighting would be around Cape St. Vincent.|"['1.

The mate's predictions were accurate, and at seven in the morning, they dropped anchor near Cape Saint Vincent. Frank rowed ashore with a signal book containing questions in various languages, including Spanish. The signal officer, though limited in English, helped Frank understand. Despite searching at Ceuta, Tarifa, and Tangier, no trace of the mysterious craft was found. The Phantom likely hadn't passed through the area. The Osprey anchored off Gibraltar six days later, and the health officer confirmed no similar vessel had visited recently. Frank inquired about a schooner or brigantine that might have transitioned from a yacht to a trading vessel, but no such ship had been seen.

Frank had visited Gibraltar multiple times before, so the place held no newness for him. Yet, he went ashore immediately to arrange for refilling water. The steward and George Lechmere joined him to buy fresh food. The following three days, he aimlessly wandered around the Rock. While the Osprey sailed, he managed to control his worry and impatience. But now, anchored, he couldn't stay put. Despite being invited by fellow officers to dine, he declined, citing extreme anxiety. A message informed him that a brigantine matching the description had briefly anchored to restock. It had a fast journey from England, flying the Belgian flag, and was named the Dragon.

While the clerk was away, Frank conversed with the Spaniard using the signal book. The clerk returned with his brother, a young man of seventeen or eighteen, who spoke English adequately. Frank found the terms offered by the merchant surprisingly low and quickly struck a deal. The merchant mentioned the rarity of English yachts visiting the port and assured Frank that the ordered supplies would arrive that afternoon. Despite the invitation to stay at the country house, Frank declined. The merchant instructed Pedro to locate a pilot familiar with the Virgin Islands for their upcoming journey.

Frank expressed his satisfaction to George as they moved away. He mentioned that although they believed the person they were seeking might be in the area, there was no absolute certainty as he could have gone to South American ports or the Gulf of Florida. However, he had indeed come to the very island they anticipated. Frank believed the westward direction taken by the person they were tracking was a decoy. The pilot they sought was known to be the best on the island and was expected to lead them to potential hiding spots. The pilot was willing to assist after settling personal matters and receiving a small fee. Frank explained to George that their goal was to locate a vessel that had arrived a month ago with distinct features. Despite other trade options in neighboring islands, the vessel's choice to stop in the Virgin Islands seemed peculiar due to their limited resources.|['1.

Hurricanes are not common in this area, but they can be very severe, especially in the Leeward Islands. A recent hurricane was one of the worst they could remember. The search for a missing vessel took them to various islands and creeks. After twelve days of searching, they finally received useful information at Tortola. They discovered that the vessel, known as the Phantom or Dragon, had left the area after the hurricane and likely headed west. The crew speculated that the vessel might have stopped at San Domingo, a nearby destination with many bays and rivers to hide in.

Frank and Dominique sailed along the coast of San Domingo and Hayti, but Dominique was less certain about these waters. Frank advised him to land at villages and bring fishermen who knew the local waters. The Osprey arrived at Porto Rico after three days. Dominique went ashore to gather information about a brigantine they were searching for. They learned she had been spotted in various places. Pedro noted down the sightings but found the information vague. Frank suspected the brigantine had a secluded headquarters. To disguise themselves, they considered options like altering their sails or searching in boats.

From this point to Cape La Move, tracing the inlets, is estimated to be around five to six hundred miles, potentially more. The consistent breeze should allow us to cover forty to fifty miles daily with a sail, aiming for forty. In three weeks, we should thoroughly scan the coast, accounting for stops to inquire. The yacht must trail behind a few miles, ensuring not to overtake us. During anchoring at night, two headlights are crucial: one at the crosstrees and one at the topmast head. We will carry blue and red lights for signaling. Burning a blue light at 9 p.m. will indicate my location, while a red light will summon the yacht for retrieval. I plan to take Pedro and possibly Dominique, with another pilot if needed, to interact with locals effectively. Preparations include painting the gig black and adjusting the sail for better performance. The crew will be well-equipped with provisions, water, and signaling tools for the journey.|"['1.

It was not necessary to land at the coast villages here, as it was likely that the Phantom had not been near San Domingo. They rowed up the narrow rivers to question the locals. The pilot learned about their search for the Phantom, which was a mystery to him until then. Frank trusted the pilot and shared that they were looking for a brigantine that had kidnapped a young English lady and her maid. The pilot vowed to help and mentioned the possibility of a confrontation. Frank appreciated the support and hinted at a potential showdown with the villain. They gathered no news until passing La Catarina, where they learned the schooner had anchored at Azua. They continued their journey, avoiding risks, and reached Cape Dame Marie, entering the bay of Hayti. Frank speculated that the schooner might be in the bay due to its favorable conditions for cruising.|"['1.

To begin with, the best strategy is to sail to the island of Genarve and drop anchor close by at night. This position will allow a view of the bay, making it possible to spot the schooner leaving either of the sheltered inlets on the north or south side. The plan is to observe from an elevated spot on the island, enabling a lookout for the vessel's movement. This approach is more efficient than rowing around the entire bay, which would take much longer. By anchoring near Genarve, a swift sail in the gig could lead to Port au Prince, where the brigantine might be stationed. After anchoring at Genarve, the crew rowed ashore to scout the area. Frank, along with George Lechmere, Pedro, and sailors, headed to the island's highest point for a better vantage. They observed the schooner passing the island more frequently on the southern side. The decision was made to pursue the brigantine as it set sail towards the west, indicating a possible course towards Cuba. This presented an opportunity to intercept the vessel before it reached its destination.|"['1.

"In just five minutes, the Osprey set sail with the wind blowing from the west. The crew spotted the brigantine's topsail after two hours.

George Lechmere explained to Major that searching the entire bay before focusing on the boat was crucial to avoid losing track of the missing person. Despite feeling lost on the next steps, they decided to approach the brigantine cautiously.

They also discussed the importance of landing in a place with a path for easy access. After rowing down the inlet, they found a suitable spot with a clear path up the slope. The crew was advised to maintain vigilance, expecting a possible surprise attack. They rowed cautiously to avoid detection by the enemy ship. The men maintained silence, rowing slowly to avoid splashes, ensuring a stealthy approach. Dominique, George, and Frank led the way, followed by sailors armed with muskets.

The chaos erupted as the black sailors panicked and leaped overboard, some into boats and others into the sea. The white sailors, swept up in the frenzy, were left unable to act. The captain, armed with pistols, fired a shot before being struck by Frank's belaying pin and falling unconscious. The Belgian sailors, realizing they were outnumbered and leaderless, surrendered. The captain ordered the guns to be aimed at the cabin to prevent the fire from being extinguished. As the smoke cleared, a hole was visible in the ship's side from the guns' impact.

"The news that the Osprey had the cannon from the brigantine on board surprised the negroes.
