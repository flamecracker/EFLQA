"Tom Makes a Promise

As the special scout meeting adjourned, Tom Slade, Roy Blakeley, and Walter Harris lingered outside the troop room with their beloved scoutmaster, Mr. Ellsworth.

The church sexton, ""Dinky,"" hurried to set up a wooden railing at Matty's stationery store for the next day's event.

Mr. Ellsworth, looking at Pee-wee, chuckled, ""A little bigger than that, I'm afraid."" He advised Tom, ""Let me do your thinking, even your patriotic thinking, for now.

Suddenly, a suspicion struck Tom's mind like lightning. He wondered if Roscoe Bent's interest in the hunting shack was to avoid his duty.

Tom Slade, a ships' boy, was unexpectedly praised for his quick thinking that saved the vessel. Even though he was not treated as a hero, he was acknowledged for his contributions. Tom, content with helping Uncle Sam, continued his duties without much thought of recognition. However, fate had other plans. Tom's knowledge of codes and abbreviations proved crucial in capturing a foreign criminal. Despite his modesty and past mistakes, Tom's heart swelled with hope and joy. As he sat at the wireless table, a spark of communication across the water sparked excitement in him. Forbidden areas of the ship and encounters with the gun crew added to Tom's adventurous journey.

"On the ship's deck after supper, Tom encountered Mr. Conne walking casually, without a life-belt but with a faintly visible cigar. Despite the tense atmosphere onboard, Mr. Conne engaged Tom in conversation, revealing details about a man with a forged passport and connections to army locations. As the wind picked up, Tom hurried back to the wireless room, where he found Cattell discussing a German navy phrase ""To the day"" signifying the Kaiser's ambition for world domination.

All through the night, the wind howled and the waves crashed loudly against the ship. Tom struggled to open the door to peek outside amid the storm, only to be met with rain lashing at his face. The ship felt like it was shuddering, similar to a dog shaking off water. Suddenly, the constant throb under his feet stopped, creating an eerie silence. Tom quickly sent out an urgent distress signal as lights flickered outside, and the emergency bell rang. Rushing along the drenched deck, he slipped in the rain, noticing the ship tilting dangerously. People in life jackets hurried about, uncertain if the ship was sinking or would stay afloat. Tom found himself by the lifeboats, helping lower one smoothly despite the chaos around him. The army men and crew maintained order, guiding passengers away from the perilous edge of the ship.|['1.

The scared crowd rushed through the pouring rain and darkness, slipping on the wet deck. Some fell overboard as the rail broke off. The ship lost its grandeur and looked feeble. Tom and a few others struggled to launch a raft for rescue. The ship tilted so much that standing was impossible. The storm drowned out all sounds except for the desperate cries of drowning people. Tom knew he was seconds away from the treacherous sea. He clung to the raft, hoping for help. The ship leaned so sharply that he could barely stand. He managed to reach a stateroom tier. The hatch plunged into the sea. Tom was seen clinging to a door, soaked and windswept. Tom had a duty to fulfill but failed, breaking his promise.

The meeting tomorrow night, in partnership with the Y. M. C. A., marks my last one before I depart. I learned you'd be back from camp this weekend, and I thought to invite you to share with the boys. They greatly admire you, Roscoe, perhaps due to your impressive uniform. You truly look the part of a soldier with your straight posture and confident demeanor. Your blonde hair complements the brown uniform, and your lively blue eyes add a touch of daring. I want you to explain to the scouts the honor and integrity that being a soldier entails. Emphasize the importance of keeping one's word and the significance of a promise. Being a soldier is more than just combat—it's about trustworthiness and dependability.

Roscoe was overwhelmed by what he had just read. It made him feel sick. He tried to console himself by thinking he didn't really know where Tom was or what he was up to. But it didn't ease his mind. As he walked, memories flooded his thoughts. They were like echoes from a past life he no longer recognized. Phrases kept replaying in his head. Under a lamppost, he pulled out a worn paper from his wallet. Struggling to read the faded words, he found a message that mentioned not telling something important. Roscoe felt a mix of regret and admiration for someone named Christopher. He reflected on his actions, feeling remorse for his past behavior. Suddenly, a surge of determination swept over him, pushing him to search for Roy and reevaluate his choices.|['1.

As he walked past Rockwood Place, he noticed the library lights on, indicating his parents were still awake. Ignoring Mr. Ellsworth's message, he headed straight to his room, which he hadn't used recently. To his surprise, he felt a presence there all night—a face with tousled hair, a large mouth, and a bloody cut on the forehead. Thoughts of Tom's possible death haunted him. The next morning, Mrs. Bent wanted to photograph him in his uniform. She praised his looks, urging him to develop the film himself for immediate prints. Later, in the cellar, he prepared his motorcycle for a long absence. An eerie feeling returned, making him imagine Tom's figure in the shadows. Despite the unsettling visions, he focused on his duty, maintaining his soldier's honor. After a family supper, he groomed himself for a visit to the Y. M. C. A. hall in East Bridgeboro.|"[""1.

Roscoe Bent found himself lost in a whirlwind of conflicting thoughts. Despite his initial reluctance and inner turmoil, he couldn't shake off the memory of his loyal friend, Roy Blakeley, who stood by him through thick and thin. The picture of Tom Slade, a former scout, haunted his mind, reminding him of past events and the sense of honor and loyalty that Tom embodied. As Roscoe navigated through the dark grove, haunted by his troubled conscience, he was startled by a familiar face in the shadows.
