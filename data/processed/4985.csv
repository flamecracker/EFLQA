"""That's Tom Cameron's dog,"" one man said, pointing to the mastiff. ""And that lantern is from his motorcycle, I'm sure! He rode through town on it after dark, and I fear he might have had an accident."" Mr. Curtis spoke seriously, ""Parloe, you know that area near the woods beyond the swamp and Hiram Jennings' field. Isn't there a steep road down to Osago Lake pike?"" Despite preparations with lanterns and a stretcher, Reno, the dog, wouldn't move without Ruth. She encouraged him to go find Tom, but he stayed by her side. Ruth insisted she could keep up and urged them to hurry, fearing Tom might be hurt.

Reno halted near a steep bank, peering into darkness. Through the trees, twinkling lights in the distance marked the railroad. Searchers noted signs of a prior accident. Ruth, beside the doctor, awaited the injured boy's arrival. Despite rumors of his bad behavior, she pondered the implications of his misfortune. As the men carried the unconscious youth up the bank, Ruth observed his limp figure. The doctor examined the wounded boy, noting a head injury. The injured boy had left a plea for help on his torn handkerchief. Doctor Davison planned to move him carefully before treatment. The group slowly made their way towards the doctor's house, with Jasper Parloe carrying one end of the stretcher.

Ruth found herself in a peculiar situation, with her uncle being accused of causing Tom Cameron's injury. Despite being a stranger in Cheslow, she managed to reach the railroad station safely. The station master, Sam Curtis, was surprised to see her and informed her that her uncle had been there earlier, looking for something. Ruth, unsure of where to stay, mentioned having only a dollar. Sam suggested going home with him to seek his wife's advice.

"Only a few passengers got off the train and left without entering the station. Curtis turned off the lights, locked his ticket office, and secured Ruth's trunk in the baggage room.

When Ruth and her companions returned to the cozy little bedroom that the kind lady had offered her for the night, they overheard Mr. Curtis and another voice in the sitting room. Despite the initial tension in the voices, upon entering, they found Mr. Curtis alone, and the owner of the sharp voice was nowhere to be seen. Ruth assumed the voice belonged to the invalid. Mrs. Curtis quickly prepared supper while Mr. Curtis recounted the incident with Reno stopping the train and finding the injured Cameron boy. Ruth noticed a crack in the curtains and realized she was being observed by a pair of bright eyes. After supper, Mrs. Curtis suggested Ruth get a good night's rest for her walk to the Red Mill in the morning.

When the girl spotted Ruth on the road, she slowed down the car. Reno, not wanting to wait, leaped out of the car before it fully stopped to embrace Ruth.

The car smoothly climbed a small hill, revealing a picturesque farming area sloping down to the Lumano River. Dotted with fenced fields and white farmhouses, the landscape was serene. The swollen river carried debris from the Spring flood, a sight that worried Helen about potential flooding. As they approached a mill, Helen shared that Mr. Potter, the miller, took good care of his property. Ruth admired the vibrant red and white paint on the buildings. Helen explained that they lived on Mount Burgoyne's shoulder, ensuring safety from flooding. Despite their mother's absence, Ruth felt welcomed by Helen's family.

As she approached him standing grimly in front of the Red Mill, she observed his tall, stooped figure, covered in dust.

From the kitchen door at the Red Mill, Ruth could see a lot, making her morning chores bearable. She assisted Aunt Alvirah in various tasks, keeping the house spick and span. When the Cameron car arrived, Helen and a bundled-up figure, likely Tom, greeted her. Ruth, shy and lacking boyish company, felt hesitant. She recalled the night she found Tom after his accident, adding to her unease. Yet, Tom and Helen were friendly, and Ruth's help was appreciated by Aunt Alvirah. Despite Uncle Jabez's potential disapproval, Ruth sought permission for a ride with the Camerons, earning a break from her hard work.|"[""1.

Helen and Ruth embarked on a thrilling adventure in a motor car, speeding through the valley towards the Minturn Pond Dam. Tom, their companion, warned them of the impending danger as the dam began to crumble and release a massive flood of water. With quick thinking, Helen turned the car around and raced back down the valley, trying to outrun the approaching flood. The girls, unprepared for such a race, felt the rush of wind and the thundering sound of the flood behind them. As they approached the toll-bridge, they saw the foam-crested wave charging towards them in the distance, adding to the tension of the daring escape from the disaster.|['1.

The first house they passed had a family outside, watching the rushing car. The family ran to higher ground, alerted by the dam bursting. The toll-bridge at Culm Falls was silent, gates down, and no one around. Helen drove through the gate, smashing it, to alert the toll-man about the flood. They raced through the village, warning everyone. As they neared the Red Mill, the valley spread out, but the flood would hit the meadows on the other side. The trio in the car shouted warnings to people at the smithy and beyond, racing to spread the alarm about the impending flood.|['1.

As the car drove forward, Helen honked the horn continuously. The loud noise alone should have alerted people to the danger, without Tom's frantic shouts and gestures. They had to slow down near some houses to make the residents realize the peril. Halfway to the Red Mill, they heard the roar of the approaching tidal wave above the car's noise. They saw the flood's crest appear around the bend, crashing into the toll-bridge, which crumpled and vanished. The flood spread, overflowing the lowlands behind them. Ahead, a man with a heavy basket walked on the road. Ruth and Helen stopped the car for him. It was Jasper Parloe, visibly shaken. Despite the roaring waters, they managed to understand each other, and Jasper got into the car. Tom noticed Jasper's strange behavior but was preoccupied with the flood. The car reached the safety of higher ground near the Red Mill.|"[""1.

The events unfolded rapidly, leaving the girls inside the mill. Ruth, worried about Aunt Alvirah, led Helen through the passage to the kitchen porch. Water had flooded the area, but the girls found Aunt Alvirah in the kitchen, pale but welcoming. Outside, a farm wagon raced down the hill, drawn by mules. The water had washed away a bridge, creating a dangerous situation. Aunt Alvirah, fearing for the miller's safety, tried to reach the fence despite her pain. Meanwhile, the miller, in a reckless act, urged his mules through the flood with a whip, risking their safety.

The miller rushed in through the door, visibly upset by the flood's damage to his building. Despite the minor destruction, his despair was profound. Helen Cameron, witnessing his distress, was greatly alarmed as he displayed rage and sorrow. Ruth, torn by conflicting feelings, felt compelled to offer sympathy. Though she had not yet gained Uncle Jabez's trust during her time at Red Mill, she followed him inside. There, Jabez faced Tom Cameron, discussing the loss of a cash-box to the river. Ruth tried to console Jabez, signaling the start of a slight bond between them. Jabez, known for his stern demeanor, softened slightly, allowing for a hint of communication. Ruth, eager to broach a sensitive topic, yearned to discuss her desire to attend school with him.|"[""1.

Ruth excelled in her studies at the Darrowtown graded school, just a short distance from the Red Mill where she lived with her uncle Jabez and Aunt Alvirah. Despite the recent flood and the damage it caused to the mill, Uncle Jabez remained grumpy and focused on his financial losses. Ruth, determined to continue her education, approached her uncle about attending school. Despite his initial reluctance, Aunt Alvirah supported Ruth's desire to learn. Uncle Jabez, preoccupied with his ledger and losses, showed little empathy for Ruth's feelings. However, Aunt Alvirah comforted Ruth as she grieved over the loss of her parents' keepsakes. Ruth found solace in the precious mementos she had safeguarded in her bag.|"['1. What did Ruth excel in at Darrowtown graded school?\nA) Sports\nB) Music\nC) Studies\nD) Art\nE) Drama', '2.

Ruth was devastated by the loss of her trunk, which contained all her clothes. She cried herself to sleep that night and woke up looking sad. Despite her swollen eyes, no one seemed to notice her distress except for Aunt Alvirah, who was particularly kind to her. It was Saturday, butter-making day. Ruth's task was to churn butter twice a week using a stone crock and a wooden dasher. Just as she began churning the cream, her friend Helen Cameron arrived. Helen excitedly invited Ruth to join her in decorating Cove Chapel with buttercups. Ruth had to finish churning the butter first before she could go. Helen mentioned that she was going to Briarwood Hall in the fall, and Tom would be attending a military academy nearby. Ruth was taken aback by the news and focused on her task, pretending to be engrossed in churning the butter.|"['1.

Ruth diligently worked on making butter, kneading and washing it until the water ran clear. She planned to salt it, store it, and work on it again later. Meanwhile, Tom shared his dream of owning a stock farm while Ruth envisioned having a dairy with registered cattle. Helen, however, preferred picking buttercups. As they approached a figure on the bridge, Tom's dog, Reno, guarded a basket. The figure, Parloe, hinted at knowing who caused Tom's accident and tried to manipulate the situation. Ruth and Helen, wary of Parloe, quickly moved on. Parloe insinuated that Ruth's relationship with the Camerons could be at risk if a certain secret was revealed, hinting at a potential conflict.|"[""1.

Tom and his sister Helen were out enjoying the beautiful day with their friend Reno and Ruth Fielding from the Red Mill. Despite Helen's disapproval of Tom's friend Jasper, the group had a lovely time gathering buttercups for a pillow-making project. Tom worked hard to collect the flowers while the girls wove the foundation for the pillow. As they sat together, the girls began to confide in each other, with Helen hinting at something important but not revealing it. They worked diligently on the pillow, creating a beautiful and colorful masterpiece. After completing the project, Ruth headed home alone, passing by the bridge near her uncle's farm.

There was silence. Ruth's uncle remained silent, and Ruth, worried about being caught eavesdropping, hurried up the hill. Uncle Jabez appeared at supper with a heavier scowl than usual and ignored Ruth and Aunt Alvirah all evening. Despite the shabby black dress she wore, Ruth decided to start school on Monday with Uncle Jabez's grumpy permission. Feeling out of place among the well-dressed students, Ruth faced the school on Monday morning and was warmly welcomed by Miss Cramp. Despite initial difficulties, Ruth's strong foundation in her studies helped her excel and be placed among the advanced students.

Ruth's relationship with her grumpy uncle was strained, especially after the loss of his cash-box. Despite his moodiness, Ruth found solace in Aunt Alvirah, a kind and caring friend. Aunt Alvirah reassured Ruth about her lack of dresses, promising to find a way to provide them. Ruth knew her aunt had no money of her own, as Uncle Jabez controlled everything. One day, Ruth met Doctor Davison leaving Aunt Alvirah's house. The doctor explained Mercy's struggles, mentioning her spinal and mental health issues.

"Aunt Alvirah was confident that Ruth would soon have the dresses she needed. Ruth was surprised when she returned from school to find Aunt Alvirah excited about the dresses. The old lady revealed that the dresses were as good as new and would be altered to fit Ruth perfectly. Ruth suspected that Doctor Davison might have donated the dresses after Aunt Alvirah mentioned that the previous owner was no longer around.

Aunt Alvirah returned with a stack of colorful dresses that left Ruth delighted. The practical and nicely made ginghams were suitable for school. Ruth had been wearing black and white dresses since her father's passing. Uncle Jabez, lost in his calculations, rarely interacted with Ruth or Aunt Alvirah.

Miss Lock worked hard to alter the dresses, and Ruth blossomed into a pretty appearance. However, Ruth struggled to make friends at school due to Julia Semple's influence. Helen Cameron and Tom were exceptions, often spending Saturdays with Ruth. Helen would drive Ruth around the countryside in a pony carriage, enjoying the gypsyish rides with Tubby, the fat old pony."|"[""1.

One Saturday afternoon, Ruth and Helen visited Cheslow for the first time. Helen was excited to show Ruth around the town, praising its beauty and charm. As they rode into town, Tubby, their slow horse, needed constant urging to keep moving. Despite Tubby's reluctance to exert himself, the girls finally arrived at Doctor Davison's house. The doctor welcomed them warmly and offered them delicious treats made by Mammy 'Liza, his cook. Doctor Davison showed a genuine interest in Ruth's schooling and encouraged her to excel.

Helen was upset and pouting, insisting on visiting someone who treated others poorly. The doctor warned her against it, emphasizing that she had everything Mercy could desire.

Doctor Davison instructed Mercy to go to bed immediately and allowed her to rise early the next morning, like Ruth. Ruth was to sleep on the couch in Mercy's room during her stay at the Red Mill.

As Mercy's health improved, her demeanor softened. Visitors were greeted with a smile, and she even enjoyed sitting on the porch or taking walks with Ruth. Mercy used special sticks Uncle Jabez made for her to move around her room, but she preferred not to be seen doing so. The doctor observed her closely and eventually brought in a surgeon from New York for a second opinion. The surgeon's intense scrutiny made Mercy a bit uneasy, but his words of returning soon excited her. Ruth overheard Mercy humming a mysterious tune about seeing the surgeon again. Ruth understood the song's meaning and showed even more kindness towards Mercy. One day, the Camerons took Ruth on an outing to Olakah Glen, a beautiful but remote location. Reno, their loyal dog, sensed danger lurking nearby, prompting Tom to investigate. Despite Reno's vigilance, the source of the disturbance remained a mystery.|"[""1.
