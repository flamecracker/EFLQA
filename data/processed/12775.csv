Dave explained that this year's football team lacked standout players, making everyone nearly equal in skill. In previous years, teams had a few star players, with the captain being one of the best.

Dan, you have much to learn about girls and social etiquette when calling on them. Miss Preston may have allowed you to call due to her engagement.

"Starting the next day, the ""Dodger"" would guide six midshipmen on Chesapeake Bay to teach them about submarine operations above and below the water's surface. This training would happen daily with groups of six midshipmen until all first-class members had sufficient practice. Lieutenant Jack Benson announced, ""Ensign Somers will demonstrate deck handling and underwater steering, followed by Ensign Hastings explaining the craft's mechanics. Afterward, I'll answer any questions."" Lieutenant Benson proposed taking the best squad out on Saturdays for a longer cruise down the bay, returning by Sunday noon. The midshipmen eagerly discussed the ""Dodger"" and its officers, known as a top submarine. Benson emphasized the importance of quick actions and crew independence for effective submarine operations. The crew's role was to act swiftly and independently, maintaining a clear view of the deck and sea. The ""Dodger"" prioritized light steering for steady nerves during critical moments.

Lieutenant Jack Benson emphasized the importance of stealth for submarines, mentioning that they should not make noise like clanging gongs. He then directed his comrades to the conning tower to hear what was happening below. The conversation shifted to the craft's speed, which had unexpectedly slowed down. Farley hesitated to report Dan Dalzell, who was suspected of meddling with the engine speed. Benson explained the challenges of operating on a small craft like a submarine, where roles often overlapped. Despite the limitations, the crew managed tasks efficiently. Benson commended Somers for a smooth descent to the bottom of the sea, testing the knowledge of the crew by asking about the depth of the water they were in.|"['1.

Benson smiled as he explained how submarines can be easily managed, even in the dark. Ensign Eph shared that during meal times, they rest in the mud without a full crew on deck.

Dave Darrin stood up and headed to the engine room, opening the door to peek inside. Hal and Eph were busy working on the motor, while Lieutenant Jack Benson observed. Eph was focused on a thin copper plate, trying to make it fit into the motor. Despite their efforts, the motor wouldn't start. Hal kept trying, determined to fix the plate. Meanwhile, Jack found duplicate plates hidden under a bench. They continued expelling water from the compartments.

When the Navy finally gained possession of the ball for the third time, Darrin and Dalzell, forewarned, swiftly advanced down the field. A clever tactic was employed this time.

The entire Navy line united their efforts in a synchronized charge. The impact was forceful, causing the Army line to crumble. Darrin, skillfully maneuvering, evaded the halfback and with the assistance of Dalzell and Jetson, successfully crossed the line.
