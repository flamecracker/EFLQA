When he first arrived out West, it was believed that he was unwell. However, it soon became clear that he was actually just very hungry. Spending months outdoors had allowed him to eat freely and he was now one of the healthiest boys around. Donald, the eldest of the group, was known for his sound judgment and ability to make the right decisions in challenging situations. While he was seen as a leader, Adrian, who owned a large ranch in Wyoming, was also recognized for his sensible nature and courage. The trio had previously embarked on a journey along the Rio Grande, where they met with Texas Rangers led by Capt. June Peak to combat cattle smugglers. During their adventures, they rescued Pedro Sanchez, the son of Gen. Sanchez from Mexico, and honed their Spanish-speaking skills. Their trip to Mexico City amidst a revolution led by Gen. Carranza shed light on the political unrest in the country.|"['1.

A few days before the event where the four boys were on their way to stop train robbers, they had visited Pachuca, about sixty miles from Mexico City, on horses provided by Gen. Sanchez. Despite the country's unstable conditions, they explored the mines and mountains, always armed. On the day in question, they rode to the river, where they had fun crossing it with their horses. Suddenly, a whistle blast signaled danger. The train stopped as the conductor and guards approached the boys. A plan was made to confront the robbers. The boys uncoupled the train, causing the engine to overturn, while they fired at the bandits. The express car continued, and the boys rushed back to help.

"""Our Marlins will,"" said Adrian as two bandits fell from their horses, surprised by the sudden volley from the train. The other horsemen hesitated briefly before charging towards the train. As they approached, the express car came to a stop, and another volley from the train turned four more horses loose. Meanwhile, Broncho Billie, not a good walker, encountered a strange creature, a small man-animal resembling a mix between a man and a monkey. A struggle ensued as the creature tried to grab Billie's weapon, but he managed to gain control by grabbing its throat. Despite the temptation to shoot, Billie decided to take the creature with him, thinking he could sell it. As he pondered how to catch the creature, he raised his weapon towards the moving grass, ready for whatever may come."|"['1.

Twenty minutes later, Billie arrived at Pitahaya station, expecting to meet Adrian and the three Mexicans, who had already left for the wreck site. Unaware of the situation, Billie inspected the small station, discovering it was just a one-room building used as a freight house and waiting room, lacking a station master. As he walked down the track, he reloaded his gun and counted the ties. Suddenly, an ape leaped on him, took his weapon, and pointed it at him. Billie remembered a story about an ape using a gun, so he threw a stone at it and fled into the jungle. The ape followed him as he stumbled into a basin. While trying to climb out, he saw ten horsemen with three bodies on their saddles. The horsemen disappeared into ruins as Billie felt like he was being watched.

Billie cautiously approached the dilapidated building, skirting the wall until he reached directly beneath a broken window. After a long moment of silence, he dared to peek inside. The voices of the Zapatistas, who had tried to rob the train, echoed clearly. Billie eavesdropped on their conversation, learning about their failed robbery and their suspicions of betrayal within their group. Tempted to reveal his presence, Billie resisted and decided to alert the authorities in Pachuca. As he made his way back to the railroad, a tall figure emerged from the bushes, prompting Ab to run towards them. The stranger shared his past involvement in a revolution and offered to guide them through the ruins to reach their friends below. Despite the bandits feeling secure, Billie and his companions prepared for a risky descent into the shaft, aided by a rope tied securely by the mountebank.|['1.

Later, news arrived that one boy was missing, and the others went to search for him. When hours passed without their return, Gen. Sanchez led a search party, with Tony as the scout. After half an hour, the boys reached the city, receiving cheers as they passed through the main street to Gen. Sanchez's home near the plaza. Shortly, Billie sat with the mayor, enjoying a meal while a server waited with a large turkey leg. A week later, on April 10, 1914, the Broncho Rider Boys and Pedro returned to Mexico City. Tensions rose as American marines were arrested in Tampico. Gen. Sanchez advised the boys to return to the United States due to potential trouble. Pedro gave them opals as parting gifts, and they headed to the U.S. Embassy to register, finding many Americans leaving Mexico. When they returned to Gen.

General Sanchez returned hours later, explaining that transportation to Vera Cruz was delayed due to track damage near Cordoba. He assured safe passage once repairs were made. Three days passed before the boys could depart, staying at Sanchez's house to avoid trouble. On the 13th, they bid farewell and headed to the station. Only those with passes from the Mexican provost marshal were allowed on the crowded trains. Thanks to Sanchez, the boys had passes but couldn't bring weapons. As the train left, a passenger expressed frustration with Mexican treatment. The journey was slow and tense, with fear of attacks. Billie noticed armed men outside, realizing the danger.

Quietly, they returned to eavesdrop on the conversation among the passengers and the guard. Laughter mixed with anger filled the air. Some women wept, but above all, the florid-faced man's voice dominated, detailing his plans to contact Admiral Fletcher. As he holstered his revolver, a noise made him turn. Billie's punch knocked him out. They stripped him of his belongings and disguised Donald as the lieutenant. With a revolver aimed, they confronted the captain, demanding the passengers return to the train. As dawn broke, Mt. Orizaba's peak appeared, signaling safety. Billie joked about leaving the captain behind. The smell of food hinted at breakfast as they faced the challenges ahead.|"['1.

The leader, Billie, guided the way while the two boys followed. Soon, they spotted a sizable adobe house through the trees. As they approached, they saw a group of men with a herd of horses and more inside the house eating. The boys' arrival caused a stir, with men reaching for their guns. Captain Lopez warned them of the danger, but the boys hoped for safe passage to Vera Cruz. Exploring the house, they found food and tended to a woman's injuries.

Mr. Black explained the advantages of their chosen route to avoid encountering the Huerta forces. He decided they would start their journey the next morning to avoid traveling through the mountains at night.

Mr. Black broke a piece of bamboo and tied a handkerchief to it. He raised it above his head as the group left the woods. They were spotted immediately, and horsemen rode towards them, surrounding them. As expected, Gen. Dorantes' passes were recognized, and the officer thanked the boys. An escort was sent to ensure their safety to Moreno. They were advised not to proceed to Vera Cruz due to strained relations between countries.

The boys followed the company through the street until they reached a barricade guarded by marines. Surprisingly, they were allowed to pass and continue towards the city outskirts. The commander instructed Adrian to inform Captain Rush of their position and Billie to alert the landing about the enemy's retreat. As they hurried on, Billie fell but was urged to continue alone while the others completed their mission. Billie found himself inside a grand house with an impressive courtyard. To his shock, a man named Santiago, whom he had encountered at the Rio Grande, stood before him with a rifle pointed at his head. Meanwhile, Donald and Adrian cautiously navigated the area, devising a plan to deal with the Mexican pickets quietly.

The group had waited patiently, growing tired. When they rushed to the expected location, the plan was for others to cut the tethers. As the man took a breath, a loud yell escaped before being hushed by Adrian. Unknowingly, their actions alerted Mexican pickets, leading to rifle shots and bugle calls. Later, they encountered American pickets, explaining their mission. The man, saved by a boy previously, showed signs of mental strain. Billie wisely avoided causing trouble. The lad clarified his identity to a confused man. Following Santiago, Billie entered a room filled with various weapons. A feast was prepared, satisfying the hunger of all. Santiago spoke in an unfamiliar language, summoning a woman resembling him. She shared a tale of political turmoil and the man's altered state due to recent events.|"[""1.

As they emerged from the trees, shots were fired at them, but luckily they were unharmed and quickly out of range. Adrian suggested firing back, but the goal was to reach Vera Cruz peacefully. The captain ordered some men to search for horse tracks. Just as he was about to give another command, a shot rang out, disarming the captain, who realized they were ambushed. The band retreated, and the Americans fired into the air. They met Lieutenant Grant, who welcomed them warmly. They later found out that Santiago was gravely ill. Lucia insisted on caring for Josie, while Strong didn't return that night. The boys dined with General Funston, where they received a challenging mission in the land of the Montezumas from Don Esteban Mendoza.|['1.

"The boys were happy to accept the offered apology, and the general left, leaving them with some of his staff.

After everyone left, Billie stayed in his room, pondering. He was tired but determined not to be caught off guard again. He thought about who could have stolen the box.
