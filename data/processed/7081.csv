"""I'm excited that you like it,"" said Cora Kimball, the camp hostess. ""I thought you would, but you can never be sure--especially with Belle. Jack thought she would be drawn to those white birches over there and want to paint on them. But I believed she would prefer the pines; they are so sturdy--like the big boys--always reliable. But enough about camp for now. Something more important is happening. My new motor boat just arrived!""

""And truly,"" Cora concluded with a grin. ""Yes, it has, and there's not a boy around to show me how to operate it. Jack was supposed to be here, but he's not. So, I'm going to try it alone.

I recall you both joined me for the first ride in my car, the Whirlwind, and now you're here for the debut of the motor boat. Now Belle, don't say no. There's absolutely no risk.""

""We all know how to swim,"" her sister added, ""and you promised, Belle, not to be anxious on this trip. Yes, Cora, I'm ready. I saw the boat as we arrived. Wasn't it the one with the new light oak deck and mahogany gunwale? I'm certain it was.""

They hurried away from the dark-browed man. He took his hand out of his pocket, and upon the smallest finger, his eyes rested. He sneered as he looked at a diamond ring that glittered on that slim brown finger.

""Yes, he must have been brought up near the water,"" replied Cora. ""They say such skill as that is not accomplished on dry land. Jack always declared he could tell a fellow at college who had ever been near the water when a lad. They take to it like a duck.""

Cora suggested that the mysterious girl they saw might be the 'Haunt Girl of Fern Island'. She described the girl as neither a summer nor a winter resident, with hair like a wild water bird. While everyone was on land, Bess was left behind but managed to jump onto a passing boat. Hazel found the island delightful, with dainty flowers and wild roses. They noticed a man who seemed wild, causing some concern. Cora, eager to reach the post office landing, suggested they postpone exploring the island due to large spiders. Belle agreed, expressing a desire to return with the boys to pick huckleberries.

""Well, let me tell you. We were on the island - the girls and I - and I strayed a bit when suddenly the most peculiar man dashed across the path. He had a beard like Rip Van Winkle and resembled him too.""

""Rip might be spending the summer in this area, although I thought he had taken an airship trip,"" said Jack. ""But honestly, Cora, what did the man look like? Paul had a similar story. He insists he also saw this renowned ghost.""

""Do you think he might have taken the canoe? The wild man I mean. We saw a strange girl in a canoe and then she disappeared. We could see her boat and then we couldn't, even though we couldn't figure out where she went. It was quite odd. There must be some mysterious twists on those islands.""

""Everyone here claims that the land is haunted, but fishermen are always so superstitious. Yet we need to investigate. I'll accompany you next time. Did the other girls see him?"" the brother inquired.

Cora assured her friends that Laurel would return and praised her as a splendid girl who just needed to overcome her chronic fear. They admired the beautiful green vines on the table, missing Laurel. Belle mentioned the boys taking the canoes, leaving them without one. Cora suggested using their own boat and noted that the lake was rough. They wondered why Laurel hadn't returned yet.

Cora was curious about how much Ben understood about the mystery of the island. She felt torn between keeping Laurel's secret and believing Ben would help rescue the girl and the hermit from exile. Cora promised to seek Ben's advice when it was time to take action, determined to solve the mystery of Fern Island before leaving Cedar Lake. Ben assured Cora of his support and willingness to assist her and the others at Camp Cozy and the Bungle. Cora appreciated Ben's friendship and returned to her engine to prepare for a quick departure. Despite engine troubles, Cora's boat ran smoothly after adjustments.

As the large boat approached the smaller craft, a massive wave crashed over the deck, extinguishing the lights. Everyone was momentarily stunned by the sudden impact. The Petrel felt like it had plunged into the depths of the lake but quickly regained stability as the other boat steamed away. Jack, understanding the importance of complying with authority, agreed to follow the officer's instructions to avoid trouble. Despite the minor fine they had to pay at the court held by Judge Brown, the group was relieved that the situation was resolved without further consequences. Cora, preoccupied with her thoughts, decided to return to Fern Island with the boys instead of heading to the pine hut alone. Upon reaching the hut, Laurel revealed that her father had suffered a minor injury while searching for her, regaining some clarity in his mind. Laurel hoped for her father's full recovery to unravel long-held mysteries.|"['1.

"Cora approached the pallet and gazed at the man lying there. Despite his unkempt appearance, there was a noble air about him, and she could see the resemblance between him and his daughter. A sense of peace filled the hut, and Cora silently prayed for his recovery rather than his demise.

Bess and Belle huddled together, still fearful of the man they called ""the wild man."" Hazel suggested that Laurel return to camp with them while Cora and Jack tended to the man, but Laurel refused to leave her father's side.

Ultimately, it was decided that Cora and Jack would stay behind while the others headed back to camp, promising to return early the next day. Cora expressed hope that the man would be well enough to move by morning and that his injury might restore his lost memories.

As they left, Jack stayed to watch over the man, hoping that a mention of a millionaire might trigger a recollection. The arrival of two detectives seeking information added tension to the situation, but Jack remained calm and offered to help. The detectives believed Miss Kimball might know the whereabouts of a man named Tony, involved in a quarrel with Peters.

""I have my courthouse badge,"" he displayed it. ""This isn't about a lawsuit. We're just trying to locate Tony. If the person who scared the girls on the island wasn't him, then who was it? She shouldn't mind telling us; it won't harm her. Who was it?""

Without delving into the hermit's mystery, which Cora believed the detectives shouldn't know, she recounted being in the hut with Laurel and how the mysterious man who frightened them turned out to be Laurel's father, currently receiving medical care.

""For his well-being, I suppose,"" Jack retorted. ""That doesn't pertain to your case against Tony or Peters. You've discovered my sister can't assist you in your search, so you might as well leave. This is private property, you know.""

""He might have to testify whether he likes it or not!"" the short officer called back to Jack, who was observing them. ""The law gets what it wants. This isn't the only case involving Tony. He has a history.""

Jack reluctantly agreed to the plan but expressed his concerns. He pulled Ed aside and instructed him to ensure Cora stayed on the boat, avoided talking to anyone, and was not intercepted by anyone.

When I was young, my mother passed away, leaving me with my father, a skilled mathematician working for the Mexican government. Fascinated by his work with numbers, I believed wealth came from manipulating figures. After my father's death, I was left in the care of an adoring nurse. When money ran out, and she was gone, I found myself in America, working at a bank at just fifteen. There, I met Mr. Starr, a kind clerk who became a friend. Tempted by the allure of money, I fell in with dubious characters interested in hypnotism. Now, facing the consequences of my actions, I consider returning to America to face the authorities.
