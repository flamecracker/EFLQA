"Eleanor and I share a love for recording our lives, a family trait we cherish. Living in the moors, our ""fads"" keep life interesting. Our current project is to document our life stories up to now.

Our house is lovely in the summer and parts of spring and autumn, but it might seem dreary in winter. The wind howls over Deadmanstone Hill and through the valley, rattling the old trees by the church. At night, it swirls the leaves over the gravestones and moans around our house, making eerie sounds like someone trying to get in. The boys complain that it sneaks into their rooms, but boys always grumble. During stormy winter nights, Eleanor and I imagined hearing a tragic scene unfold outside, with footsteps, voices, and eerie noises. We often rushed out with a candle and a poker, only to find it was just the wind and a tree branch hitting the house. Despite the stormy nights, we found comfort in our cozy kitchen by the roaring fire. The boys disapproved of our unusual choice, but we enjoyed the peaceful and warm atmosphere, surrounded by our books and papers.|"['1.

During the first six years of my life, I spent most of my time with my Ayah, who I adored. I cherished her dark cheeks, kissing and caressing them with joy. I was closer to her than even to my mother, whose cheeks resembled a delicate rose. My closest companions shared the same complexion as my Ayah. I developed a stronger bond with our bearers during that time than with anyone else. I was more fluent in Hindostanee than in English. Recently, I encountered a group of Lascar sailors at Southampton Station. Their rapid, hushed conversations stirred a sense of familiarity in me. Although I've forgotten the language of my early days, their voices resonated deeply within me. Their familiar dark, radiant faces evoked memories of old friends, briefly transporting me back to a place of nostalgia and comfort.|"[""1.

"When my mother went out early in the morning for a ride before it got too hot, Ayah would lift me to see her leave. Sometimes my father would have me brought out to ride with him on his horse for a short while. However, my nurse usually prevented this if she could. She cared for me like a mother, but I was often not tidy enough to be seen by visitors. Whenever my mother had guests over, I would be dressed in my best pink silk outfit with ringlets in my hair. I would strut proudly into the room in my pink shoes to match my dress. The visitors were always kind to me, calling me ""little Rosebud"" and giving me treats.

One of my early memories is when an ensign from our regiment, a young officer, visited my mother on the night the Colonel passed away. He was visibly shaken, pale, and anxious as he brought us the sad news. The Colonel had fallen ill suddenly and endured great suffering with remarkable courage before succumbing within just thirty-six hours. The ensign shared that the Colonel had never feared cholera, believing it was not contagious and that maintaining high spirits was crucial. Despite his efforts, the illness took him. The ensign, overwhelmed with emotion, abruptly excused himself feeling unwell. My father assisted him, but he did not return. The next day, Ayah and I watched the Colonel's funeral procession, a somber and endless march. Later, another officer, Mr. Gordon, also succumbed to the illness, causing panic among us. My mother decided to leave immediately due to fear, and I was to follow with Ayah. As we prepared to depart, a surgeon of the regiment was laid to rest, and my father, who had been unwell, spent a quiet evening with me before retiring early.|"[""1.

Thirty minutes later, a surgeon was summoned by my father, who was dining with Major Buller. The Doctor and the Major arrived at our bungalow, accompanied by two other officers who were friends of my father. One of them, Mr. Abercrombie, was a close friend of mine, a young ensign known for his recklessness and kind-hearted nature. That night, Mr. Abercrombie appeared in my dreams, and upon waking, I found him in evening attire, his face showing signs of distress. He gently held me as I was dressed, while the other officers, including Major Buller, stood back. My father, weakened by illness, reached out to me, and though initially hesitant, I recognized him by his touch and voice. Amidst solemn moments, my father requested the Lord's Prayer, which we recited together until his final breath, signaling his passing. The room fell into silence, broken only by Major Buller's acknowledgment of my father's death, after which he carried me away as I wept.

"When we started writing our life stories, we decided not to peek at each other's until both were done. This way, we could enjoy reading them all at once and avoid leaving things unfinished, a habit we both struggle with. It also felt like saving the best for last, a bit like when we used to save the best part of a dessert for the end. Reading them straight through sounds nice, but we tend to rush through books, so maybe taking it slowly, like reading a series, might be better.

I recall my early years, where my mother was absent, and the Ayah, who cared for me like a mother, didn't focus much on keeping me neat, except when guests were around. I vividly remember the interest in clothing I developed at a young age. Dressing well was crucial to Aunt Theresa and her circle. Aunt Theresa's daughters and her friends spent hours discussing attire. Aunt Theresa ensured my clothes were fashionable, not lacking in funds for my upkeep. My parents were not poor, so Aunt Theresa believed my attire should be stylish. My first black dress, modeled after one of Mrs. St. Quentin's daughter's frocks, was a marked improvement in style from my pink silk dress. It had six crape tucks that I was proud of, though Matilda pointed out they were actually cut on the bias. When Mr. George saw me in that dress, his reaction puzzled me, and I spent years trying to understand it. It left a"|"[""1.

When we arrived in Riflebury, my once stylish new dress had lost its charm. Mrs. Minchin found a dressmaker for me, recommended by Mrs. St. Quentin. Even though Mr. George didn't seem impressed by my mourning attire, Aunt Theresa's efforts to dress me well caught the attention of others in the regiment. Visitors and fashionable ladies praised my appearance, linking me to Mrs. Buller's family tragedy. While it pained me to hear the repeated sorrowful tale of my parents' passing, I found a strange comfort in the attention it brought. I often imagined myself in elegant dresses, reliving sorrowful moments with imaginary acquaintances. Despite the absence of gentlemen at our new home, officers occasionally visited, remarking on my resemblance to my late mother.

If we argued, nothing annoyed me more than belittling my great-great-grandparents' memory. The de Vandaleurs, an old French family, had a Duke who perished in the Revolution of '92. Most fled and faced poverty. The title was reinstated later, along with some property, passing to a murdered cousin. Those remaining in England, poor and proud, rejected help from the new royals, feeling robbed of their rights. One Vandaleur, who should have been Duke, wed his cousin. They endured hardships during their escape, and the wife passed away after their son's birth in England. Aunt Theresa's former nurse, who lived where the Vandaleurs first settled, shared intriguing tales. Madame de Vandaleur, in her delirium, imagined herself in her ancestral home. Nurse Brown, unsympathetic to nervous ailments, found Madame's actions incomprehensible. Aunt Theresa and siblings pitied the lady, finding her romantic.

She wore frilled caps and was very broad. I enjoyed spending time with Elspeth, baking cakes, and learning from her. She taught me to curtsy and pay respect where due.

In the past, our governess was very sensitive to any hint of cooler air, as she disliked drafts. It was challenging to focus on learning verbs and nouns in the hot and stuffy study room. Matilda often suffered severe headaches, likely stemming from her past bout with measles. Miss Perry, our governess, had a way of favoring some students over others, which caused tension with Major Buller and Aunt Theresa. Eventually, Miss Perry was dismissed due to a disagreement with Mrs. Minchin. Major Buller took over teaching English and made learning fun, but grammar lessons led to confusion and frustration. Major Buller then introduced Latin grammar, which we found easier to grasp. Our interactions with the St. Quentin girls and a French tutor helped us mature and steer clear of the gossip we had picked up from Miss Perry.

When Matilda and I first met Eleanor, we were taken aback by her simple, yet peculiar appearance. She wore thick boots and no crinoline, which was quite unusual. Despite her unassuming attire, Eleanor exuded confidence and grace, paying the cabman with ease. Her unique style and the way she did her hair away from the mirror intrigued us. Eleanor had a quaint face with dark, beautiful eyes and a charming smile. She always seemed to be on her feet, preferring to walk rather than sit idle. During our first walk together, she strode ahead in her thick boots, setting a brisk pace. Eleanor's habit of running when others walked reminded me of the energy of middle-aged Scottish and Yorkshire ladies. Despite her unconventional fashion sense, Eleanor's lively spirit and love for walking left a lasting impression on us.|"[""1.

"""No, it isn't,"" Matilda said, referring to the new hair color trend. She explained that it didn't always turn out the same all over. Eleanor, feeling out of place, mentioned that she was used to walking with boys. Later, at the Esplanade, Matilda led the conversation, while Eleanor adjusted a piece of her hat gently. Matilda complimented her on it but advised against crushing it. The girls then raced, with Eleanor winning easily. They chatted about their homes, and Eleanor showed interest in a print, speculating it might be an original Rembrandt etching. The Major and Eleanor discussed art, leading to the Major offering to show Eleanor his insect collection. Despite his high opinion of Miss Airlie, the Major agreed to send the girls to school due to various circumstances, including the St. Quentins leaving and the discovery of a suitable school recommended by Mr. Arkwright."|"[""1.

Our biographies may lack the neat division between good and bad characters found in fictional stories. When recounting true events, it's hard to assign blame solely to one party. Matilda's struggle with illness and her unsociable behavior posed challenges for the household. Her discomfort was exacerbated by her mismanagement and perhaps her own faults. Matilda's awkward age made her self-conscious, especially in the presence of Aunt Theresa's critical friends. The St. Quentin girls, closer in age to Matilda, were kept healthy and occupied with tasks, unlike Matilda. They were not burdened by societal pressures on appearance, allowing them to be more carefree. Matilda's experience highlights the complexities of growing up and the impact of external influences on self-perception.|"[""1.

Matilda's troubles were not just about feeling plain but also about her health affecting her self-esteem. She had nervous thoughts about her appearance due to ill-health, which made her avoid social situations. Unfortunately, Matilda was secretive about her health issues, partly due to Miss Perry's influence. Her aunt, Theresa, was too preoccupied to provide the attention Matilda needed. Concerned, Aunt Theresa sought advice from others, making her even more anxious. Matilda's refusal to socialize worried her family, with stories circulating about girls facing mental health challenges. Despite the support from other women in the community, domestic troubles were a common topic. Matilda's situation was a source of concern, with her family trying to understand and help her.|"['1.

The ladies' overflowing sympathy for each other's minor concerns had a drawback. The main issue often got sidelined for various tangents. Mrs. Minchin discussing a cook with Mrs. Buller would lead to a lengthy discussion not just about the cook but also about past cooks and family cooks. When Aunt Theresa sought advice about Matilda, the focus would quickly shift to anecdotes, especially Mrs. St. John's extreme stories advocating for sending Matilda to school. Major Buller's exasperation with Mrs. St. John's unsettling tales prompted him to urge Aunt Theresa to seek proper medical advice for Matilda and to avoid the morbid content discussed by Mrs. St. John. Aunt Theresa, willing to comply, assured him that she would refrain from bringing such material home and would only read it at Mrs. St. John's place. Mrs. Buller preferred seeking the regimental Surgeon's advice for minor issues and a civilian doctor for serious illnesses based on the danger involved. The Surgeon visited Matilda, prescribed a remedy for her cough, advised her to stay indoors, avoid drafts, and take medicine three times a day.|"['1.

Matilda's reluctance to see the principal Surgeon and take his prescriptions left her longing for the fresh air that had previously eased her aches and irritability. When Aunt Theresa brought in a civilian doctor, Matilda's stubbornness and refusal to admit her ailments led to the recommendation that she be sent to school. Major Buller's kind words convinced Matilda to agree to the idea, despite her initial resistance. Even though she wanted to confide in her parents, Uncle Buller cut short their conversation, prompting Matilda to share her feelings with a friend instead. Matilda felt remorseful for her behavior and expressed a desire to change.

I was once ignorant about English flowers, only recognizing some from bouquets and sketches. I learned their names from old Bridget, who would cleverly make up names if unsure. The peony, so large and red, was suggested for pickled cabbage, but a little girl carried it home sentimentally. Madame, liking flowers for decoration, wore them on her dresses to save her neck-ribbons. The heat in town was unbearable, but we didn't complain, knowing it was nothing compared to India.

Eleanor and I strongly agree on the importance of higher education for women. Despite the lack of proper provisions for women's education, I believe it is better to prioritize a girl's health and well-being over excessive academic pressure. Madame, our overseer, ensured hard work and discipline, yet the neglect of health among young women is a common issue. Many girls lack knowledge of health matters, and older women often learn these lessons too late. Miss Mulberry, our school-mistress, though conscientious and kind-hearted, enforced strict discipline at Bush House, leaving us little freedom. Madame's constant supervision, even during short breaks, was frustrating. Despite her hard work, her actions seemed unjust, causing us to question her motives.|"[""1.

Eleanor was known for her bold opinions and artistic talents. She often questioned Mr. Henley's painting techniques, especially his use of cobalt for shadows. Despite her cleverness, Eleanor's criticism sometimes led to conflicts with her peers. Madame, the school head, appreciated Eleanor's skills but also pushed her to excel. Eleanor, however, found fault in Mr. Henley's work, describing his paintings as too bright and lacking in realism. Though Eleanor's French was good, her critique of Mr. Henley's art style offended Madame.

Matilda, a hardworking student, received the most commendation for her efforts. However, she struggled under Madame's strictness, causing despair for the arithmetic-master. Matilda's unfortunate situation stemmed partly from her dedication to fulfilling resolutions inspired by Major Buller's kindness. Despite my increased tact and sympathy, Matilda's challenges persisted. She harbored a secret admiration for a man with a chiseled face and a peculiar dog they often saw at the Riflebury Esplanade. Matilda's infatuation with the man was a source of amusement among us. Her fantasies led her to imagine herself as their savior. Mrs. Minchin, observing Matilda's behavior, suggested sending her to school. Matilda's early follies, while not uncommon, embarrassed her. Aunt Theresa's stern advice reflected a lack of understanding. Matilda's struggles with health and academics went unnoticed by Miss Mulberry.

Not that our French governess was cruelly disposed. When she took Matilda's health in hand and gave her a tumbler of warm water every morning before breakfast, she did so in all good faith. It was a remedy that she used herself. Poor Matilda was furious both with Madame's warm-water cure and Miss Mulberry's pill-box. She had a morbid hatred of being ""doctored,"" which is often characteristic of chest complaints. She struggled harder than ever to work, in spite of her headaches; she ceased to complain of them, and concealed her cough to a great extent, by a process known amongst us as ""smothering.""

During a challenging time at school, Eleanor, Matilda, and I found solace in religious books brought by Eleanor. Despite facing restrictions, we delved into prayers and devotional works. Eleanor's devotion inspired us, and we found comfort in the wisdom shared in the Apocrypha. Madame's disapproval led to the confiscation of a cherished book, but Eleanor's determination led to its return. As we faced uncertainties, including a classmate falling ill, we were urged to be good and prepare to leave due to a possible outbreak.

We were all very careful; we even spoke in French, though Madame was often absent, and the holidays were near. Miss Mulberry announced that Lucy had scarlet fever, and we would all go home the next day. No more lessons, just packing. We felt sorry for Lucy but were excited for the holidays. We all happened to take the same train to London. Madame bought flowers from Bridget and showered us with them. The journey to London was noisy and fun. Eleanor and I got tired and hungry but a kind lady advised us to eat. We felt better after a meal. We stocked up on snacks and caught the northbound train.

As we journeyed, the landscape changed from serene blue to a smoky grey as we neared the industrial areas. The once lush vegetation turned dense, and tall chimneys belched smoke, blocking the sun. The scene was filled with oddly shaped furnaces and chimneys spewing fire, resembling dragons. The station in the manufacturing town was bustling with activity. While I found it dreadful, Eleanor seemed pleased, mentioning the prosperity of trade. She admired the furnaces illuminating the hills at night. Despite my disgust, she found beauty in the industrial landscape. Suddenly, I got iron filings in my eye, causing pain.

"Eleanor and I arrived at a quaint village, greeted by the chilly grey weather. The narrow stone paths led us to stone cottages and an old stone church. The Vicarage, also made of stone, awaited us at the top of a steep drive. Rose bushes adorned the entrance, heavy with blossoms. Eleanor, in her excitement, pulled a branch of ""maiden's blush"" roses, showering me with petals. Keziah, the welcoming housemaid, left a lasting impression with her warm reception.

It felt odd to think of a cozy fire in July, but the chilly evening air made us welcome the warmth. As Keziah lit the fire, Eleanor suggested we warm up in the kitchen. Surprisingly, the door was shut, hiding a chaotic noise of dogs behind it. Eleanor joyfully welcomed the dogs, while I struggled with their excited greetings. The strict cook scolded Eleanor for letting the dogs in. She then treated us to a lavish feast of tea, toast, honey, and more. The table was adorned with roses, and we enjoyed a night of peaceful sleep. In the morning, we were relieved to face the day with clear consciences and full control over our actions.|['1.

It took me a while to wake up and realize my new surroundings. The light from the window, different from what I was used to, confused me. Pincher, the dog, helped me snap out of my daze by licking my face. As we got ready, I examined Eleanor's room, filled with personal treasures. We had breakfast together, and Eleanor mentioned tidying up the boys' gardens before they returned. I eagerly agreed to help. We grabbed some tools and headed to the children's gardens, enjoying the lovely scents along the way. Eleanor explained how her brother, Clement, had a creative idea for a rhubarb pot that was now missing. We decided to build a stone ruin for the ivy instead.

"Working diligently is important, but to ""foy"" at something means to work at it with intense enthusiasm, almost to the point of being foolish. Clement and others often find themselves exhausted and irritable after such efforts. Eleanor suggests a break, mentioning how haymakers have breaks at specific times during the day. As they enjoy a snack of ginger beer and bread-and-butter, they observe the garden and discuss the plans for it. In the afternoon, they decide to head out to the moors with the dogs, shedding unnecessary layers for the adventure.

"We strolled up the Ewden, a river Eleanor knew well, until we found a clear stream with a big grey boulder to leave our shoes and socks. We took off our shoes and hats, rolled up our skirts, and waded into the chilly water. ""Wet your head!"" Eleanor shouted. Laughing, I splashed water on my head and noticed little fish swimming around my feet. The stones were slippery, and the dogs were causing a ruckus. Eleanor was searching for a rare water plant called a fresh-water alga. We carefully collected some pieces while dodging the dogs.

Eleanor and I were helping Mrs. Arkwright settle the delicate Crassicornis newcomers. As we prepared for supper, Mr. Arkwright called us to the dining room. Meanwhile, we tidied up the garden beds and the boys' room with our dogs Growler and Pincher. Eleanor mentioned her family arriving in a cab since they enjoyed spontaneous stops on their journeys. Excitedly, we set off in a donkey-carriage adorned with roses to meet them. We eagerly waved as we spotted their cab approaching slowly. Finally, the boys arrived with luggage in tow.

I had no knowledge about horses and donkeys or what they could endure, but I loved the feeling of swiftly moving through the air. Despite our rapid pace back, Neddy, our horse, seemed unfazed. Being light riders, Neddy, a discerning creature, responded well to Jack's voice alone. As we descended a steep hill, Jack asked if we should go down fast, and we did. The carriage swayed, and I clutched the hat-box tightly, feeling like I was diving straight onto the church tower. Jack only spoke when we reached the bottom, relieved we made it down safely. He praised Neddy's bravery and sure-footedness, deciding to walk up the hill out of respect for him. Jack was well-known in the village, receiving warm greetings from the locals as we arrived home.

Passing under the shadow of the dense foliage, Jack and Eleanor reached out for roses, showering rose petals like snowflakes over them, Neddy, and the carriage with a hat-box. Emerging from the road covered in flowers, they looked peculiar, like characters from a fairy tale. Keziah greeted them eagerly, but Jack's playful antics caused a stir. The warmth of their homecoming contrasted with the chaos Jack brought. Writing to relatives about their new home, the narrator shared humorous anecdotes Uncle Buller later quoted. The bond with the Arkwrights deepened, connecting them intellectually. The Major's discovery of a tiny insect named after him added a touch of immortality. The pursuit of freshwater shells and beetles became a shared passion. The narrator's father's last words echoed, emphasizing the kindness received from true friends.

During the enjoyable holidays, a decision had to be made about returning to school. The Arkwrights, hoping to keep Eleanor close, decided against sending her away. However, for the narrator, education was a priority, leading to consultations with Major Buller. Thankfully, the Major preferred home education over traditional schooling. The decision was supported by the narrator's relatives and was well-received. Despite avoiding Bush House, the narrator and Eleanor were diligent in their studies, even waking up early to work. A compromise was reached with Mrs. Arkwright to address morning headaches. Madame, a French tutor, visited the Vicarage during a summer, opting to converse in French rather than teach formal lessons. Madame's interactions with the family's dogs provided amusing moments, highlighting her unique charm.|"[""1.

Mrs. Arkwright and Madame had differing views on girls' education and politics. While they clashed on the former, they agreed on the latter. Madame found English boys easier to get along with, especially after Clement started speaking French with her. However, Jack's lack of French led to amusing misunderstandings. During a village fair, Madame's disappointment with the lack of expected festivities was evident. Despite her exquisite attire, the fair's reality fell short of her imagination. The chaos and unrefined nature of the fair left her upset, contrasting sharply with her elegant appearance.

Madame was too busy to be unhappy now. Jack was by her side, treating her to gingerbread, ginger beer, and cracked nuts. He turned oyster shells into flowers and empty bottles into vases. He even joked about buying her spectacles to see better. Together, we watched a marionette show where Madame screamed with delight. The puppets put on a pantomime, with a policeman falling apart and heads flying. We then visited a fat woman that made Madame laugh. The day continued with shopping at the bazaar, where Madame bought gifts for everyone. Children gathered around us, and Madame was charmed by their looks. Tired but content, Madame distributed the toys graciously. As we left, the children cheered, happy with their gifts. We often did things for the boys, like packing for them, writing letters, and knitting socks. Our holidays were filled with various activities, but time always seemed to run out.|['1.

Once, we formed a Field Naturalists' Club. The girls sacrificed their spare clothes to create a museum. We organized the shelves, planning to gather the local flora and insects. While the boys were at school, Eleanor and I diligently added specimens. When they returned at Christmas, they were engrossed in drama. Intrigued, we joined in. The wardrobe transformed into a theater set. Eleanor and Clement worked tirelessly on scenery. The boys' passion for theatricals persisted, but the next break brought good weather, turning the drop-curtain into a tent. Eleanor and I kept busy when the boys were away, tending to our room. We had our rules and codes for personal discipline and shared duties. Sketching brought immense joy, especially with fellow enthusiasts. Clement, with his love for truth and tendency to challenge ideas, was preoccupied with exam preparation. The Arkwrights excelled in focusing amidst noise and social settings, blending work and awareness of their surroundings.|"['1.

We chose a spot with a sandy road and heathery bank for seats, offering a lovely view of a valley with a winding stream and hillsides leading to colorful moorland mountains. Despite our tiredness, we decided to sketch. Eleanor studied birch-trees, Clement sought an extended view of Ewden Valley, and I focused on the roadside view. Jack, not usually sketching, borrowed supplies and joined us. While I struggled with proportions, Jack painted with enthusiasm, though not entirely accurately. He eventually moved to paint trees, leaving me to ponder the vastness of the scenery. Despite his artistic quirks, Jack's creative spirit added a touch of whimsy to our sketching adventure.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Eleanor study while sketching?\nA) Birch-trees\nB) Ewden Valley\nC) Roadside view\nD) Moorland mountains\nE) Stream', 'Question 2:\nWho focused on the roadside view while sketching?\nA) Eleanor\nB) Clement\nC) Jack\nD) The speaker\nE) None of the above', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Jack initially struggle with while sketching?\nA) Proportions\nB) Colors\nC) Perspective\nD) Shadows\nE) Details', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Jack eventually move to paint?\nA) Stream\nB) Moorland mountains\nC) Birch-trees\nD) Roadside view\nE) Trees', 'Question 5:\nHow did Jack paint while sketching?\nA) Enthusiastically but inaccurately\nB) Slowly and meticulously\nC) Carelessly and inaccurately\nD) Realistically and precisely\nE) Abstractly and expressively', ""Question 6:\nWhat did Jack's creative spirit add to the sketching adventure?\nA) Realism\nB) Precision\nC) Whimsy\nD) Accuracy\nE) Seriousness""]"|['A) Birch-trees', 'D) The speaker', 'A) Proportions', 'E) Trees', 'A) Enthusiastically but inaccurately', 'C) Whimsy']
The sun's heat was becoming overwhelming as I focused on my sketch. To shield me, Jack pinned a handkerchief to my shoulders and left for the ravine. As I finished a stage of my work, I felt relieved. Wetting my outline with water, I dried it in the sun before starting to paint. A gust of wind made the sandy road rough, but I patiently waited for my block to dry. I even let a beetle cross my sketch before gently guiding it away. Clement, facing similar challenges, encouraged me with his kind words. Despite the difficulties, we persevered, knowing that our efforts would pay off in the end.

Jack's discovery of a new species of fresh-water algae sparked excitement in Mrs. Arkwright and Eleanor, but Jack refused to reveal its habitat despite their pleas. After half-an-hour, Mrs. Arkwright relented, and Jack shared details about the water-weed. The group discussed the importance of improving their sketching skills and the value of perseverance in artistic pursuits. Clement expressed his belief that focusing on too many hobbies could be a mistake, while Eleanor disagreed, finding joy in the process of learning and working on various projects. The family led intellectually stimulating lives, often engrossed in work and neglecting meal times.

Living in isolation on the Yorkshire moors allowed us to escape the norms of society. Mrs. Arkwright's guidance prevented us from becoming discourteous. She warned us against selfishness and the dangers of cliques, sharing a cautionary tale of an artist overly proud of his craft. Her advice extended to valuing diverse interests and avoiding the conceit of belonging to exclusive groups. Visiting others broadened our perspectives, showing us the pitfalls of arrogance and the value of humility. Through experiences outside our home, we learned to appreciate different viewpoints and shed our own faults.

Eleanor once told her mother about self-improvement, but Mrs. Arkwright explained that while we may discover our flaws and strive for perfection, those who love us don't expect us to be flawless. She compared it to a mother's unconditional love for her child, emphasizing that even in our struggles, we are loved. Eleanor and her friend visited relatives and enjoyed the cathedral town's services. They found joy in exploring a church-bookseller's shop and admired the pretty homes in the neighborhood.

Moving from improving the appearance of the Vicarage to enhancing our own appearance was not a big leap. Most young ladies in the countryside were elegantly dressed, not like Mrs. Perowne or the fashion seen at public places, but more delicately and in line with the latest styles. Eleanor and I felt inadequate in household skills like dressmaking and cooking. We joked about being stranded on a desert island and not knowing where to start. Mrs. Arkwright regretted not teaching Eleanor more about domestic tasks due to her own lack of training. However, she believed that a general education in using our skills and common sense was just as valuable as specialized training. Aunt Theresa was skilled in dressmaking, but we were too young to remember her teachings. We were invited to visit Aunt Theresa after Major Buller retired and settled in the south of England.|"['1.

The Colonel, now a colonel, and his wife remained much the same. The girls had changed a lot, as had I. Matilda, a stylish young lady, appeared delicate at times, hinting at the consequences of past neglect. It was evident that she was her father's favorite, a bond rooted in genuine affection. Matilda's father, Colonel Buller, harbored a deep tenderness. Despite the Bush House incident being a distant memory for Aunt Theresa, Colonel Buller's lingering self-reproach was evident in his caring demeanor towards Matilda. Among the girls, we favored Matilda, appreciating her qualities inherited from her father. An upcoming county ball presented an opportunity for us to learn dressmaking as the girls' ball gowns were to be made in-house. The Bullers' drawing-room was a flurry of activity, with fabrics and trimmings scattered about as we assisted the dressmaker. The ball was a success, though Matilda appeared fatigued while Eleanor thrived, having resisted the extravagant fashion of the time. After the ball, Eleanor shared news of a charming acquaintance, Captain Abercrombie, with whom she had bonded over shared interests. Inspired by the experience, Eleanor and I decided to test our skills by making our own dresses from affordable fabric.|"[""1.

I vividly recall the design! A vine, blooming, winding up a delicate stem through layers of fabric. We dismantled old garments that somewhat fit us, then used them as templates on the new material. Following Matilda's guidance, we placed weights on the patterns and effortlessly cut out the new pieces. The sleeves and bodies looked professional, so we moved on to the skirts. Cutting the back and front sections, we properly angled the latter. Next were the gores. Folding the fabric into thirds, we sloped one-third at one end and two-thirds at the other. The challenge arose when assembling them, needing one gore turned inside out. Frustration crept in, causing headaches and backaches. Miss Lining, the village seamstress, was consulted for advice on the stubborn gores.|['1.

Miss Lining shared her admiration for a pill mentioned in a magazine. She had ordered a box for herself but had to wait due to sewing a pelerine for Mrs. Barker. While Eleanor and Margery discussed dressmaking, Jack entertained Mrs. Arkwright with mimicry. Margery, now fifteen, recalled making similar dresses for herself and Eleanor. On her fifteenth birthday, she received news about living with her great-grandparents due to their age and frailty. The departure was emotional, with Jack comforting Eleanor. Margery left for The Vine, wondering about her resemblance to her ancestors. Upon arrival, Adolphe helped with her luggage, and she hurried to meet her great-grandfather, who seemed lost in his thoughts.

It was strange. My great-grandfather stood facing the west, where red streaks of the sunset could still be seen through the trees. The light cast an unusual glow, like a painting from the past. I was exhausted from my journey and felt a chill when I remembered that Mr. Vandaleur was rumored to have lost his mind. Suddenly, he noticed me, his eyes fixated on my crimson cloak. His reaction was unsettling, a mix of surprise and confusion. He stumbled towards me, calling out in French. Then, my great-grandmother appeared, guiding him inside. The room was dim, lit only by the fading sunset. This new life with my great-grandparents was a stark contrast to my previous one. At the Arkwrights', we were immersed in modern ideas and bustling activities. Science and progress filled our days, but here, under the old Vine, time seemed to slow down. We lingered over meals, lost in idle routines. The change was overwhelming, the quiet and stillness a stark departure from my vibrant past.|"['1.

"There wasn't any extraordinary news, it appeared. Clement excelled in my class at school and formed a cricket club. Jack discovered a new fungus, likely to bear his name. We all called it ""boy's luck""! Captain Abercrombie stayed nearby with his uncle, just twelve miles away, visiting often. Mr. Arkwright praised his kindness to the boys. A tea party for school kids was planned for my birthday. Now sixteen, I reminisce with Eleanor. She's married to George Abercrombie. Their wedding was lovely, with Jack's playful shoe-throwing causing a funny mishap. Eleanor mentions a quarrel with Mrs. Minchin. Despite ups and downs, she appreciates shared interests with George.
