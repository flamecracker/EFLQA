Long ago, an Emperor loved new clothes so much that he spent all his money on them. He didn't care about his soldiers or going to the theater, only about showing off his attire. Two rogues claimed they could make clothes that would be invisible to those unfit for their jobs or naive. The Emperor, eager to see who was unfit, gave them money to start. The weavers pretended to work but did nothing. The Emperor sent his old minister to check on the progress. The minister, unable to see the clothes, pretended he did not want to seem unfit for his job. He praised the non-existent clothes, and the weavers kept deceiving everyone.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a young Fir Tree dreamt of growing as tall as the other trees, yearning to spread its branches and see the world. In winter, a hare would leap over it, making the tree envious. But as years passed, the Fir Tree grew larger, and even the hare had to go around it. The tree realized that growing older and taller was a delightful experience. However, in autumn, wood-cutters would come and fell the largest trees, leaving the Fir Tree trembling. The Stork mentioned the scent of fir on ships from Egypt, hinting at a grand destiny.

The kids played happily with their toys, ignoring the Fir Tree except for the old nurse who peeked through its branches for forgotten fruit.

When Kay did not return, little Gerda was left wondering where he could be. Tears were shed, and she wept bitterly, fearing he was lost to the river. To find him, she tossed her red shoes into the water, but they drifted back to shore. Determined, she boarded a boat, but it drifted away with her shoes in tow. As sparrows comforted her from the banks, the boat carried her downstream. Passing a cherry orchard, a kind old woman rescued her. The woman consoled Gerda, offering cherries and a picturesque cottage with magical flowers. As the old woman combed her hair, Gerda forgot about Kay.

Once there were three sisters, each wearing robes of different colors - one in red, one in blue, and the third in white. They danced under the moonlight by a serene lake. These were not mystical beings but mortal children. A sweet scent filled the air as the maidens disappeared into the woods. Soon, three coffins emerged from the forest, carrying the lovely maidens. Glowing fireflies illuminated their path. Are the dancing maidens asleep or deceased? The floral fragrance suggests they are no more.

The Finland woman placed little Gerda on the Reindeer's back and he ran swiftly. Gerda, realizing she forgot her boots and gloves, shivered in the icy cold. The Reindeer, unable to stop, left her by a bush with red berries. Gerda, now barefoot and gloveless, found herself in icy Finland.

Reciting the Lord's Prayer, angels formed from her breath surrounded her, protecting her from the menacing snow-flakes. They cleared her path towards the Snow Queen's palace, a vast, cold, and empty place illuminated by the Aurora Borealis. The palace had countless halls of driving snow, each as cold and resplendent as the next, where mirth never dwelled.

In an old manor-house, snails were extinct, but burdocks thrived, covering the garden like a forest. Two ancient snails lived there, unaware of their age. They recalled a time when more snails roamed and a manor-house awaited them, where they would be boiled and served on silver dishes, a delightful and genteel fate. The snails were the forest's honored guests, with a little adopted snail they raised. The little snail grew slowly, which pleased the old snails. Mother Snail pointed out raindrops and the little one's growth. They pondered finding a mate for him, considering black snails too common.

Once there was a proud collar that boasted about its adventures. It was starched, ironed, and admired by a widow. The collar even compared the ironing process to a graceful dance.
