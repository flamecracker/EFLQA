At school, we explore different seeds, some large enough to examine with a magnifying glass. We cut open some to study the new leaves inside and plant others to observe their growth. Ethel Brown was surprised by this and decided to collect grains and fruits to plant. Ethel Blue shared how she made bulbs blossom by transitioning them from dark to light. The girls planned to plant their own gardens inspired by their experiences. Dorothy expressed her preference for thin things and people over fat ones, sparking laughter among the group. They discussed planting flowers, with Roger suggesting they carefully choose spots for sweetpeas to avoid overshadowing shorter plants. The group then decided to enjoy the snowy weather by building a snowman.|"['1.

"Ethel Blue excitedly exclaimed, ""What is it? What is it?"" She was given a Norway spruce cone filled with grass seed to sprout. Another intriguing gift was a sweet potato with one end cut off, sprouting vines that resembled a hanging basket. The group also experimented with bulbs, making them bloom by controlling light exposure. Bringing spring indoors, they forced shrubs to blossom early by placing them in water. Inspired by Aunt Rose's global travels, they adorned their walls with plants in hanging vases, reminiscent of Japanese designs. These indoor gardening experiments brought a touch of spring indoors, despite the lingering snow outside."|"['1.

Bulbs are unique plants that don't need food from the soil, just plenty of water. The fiber they grow in holds enough water to keep them damp without making a mess indoors. Ethel Brown shared news about a garden plan with space for guests, including Elisabeth and Miss Merriam, who came from war-torn Belgium. Dorothy excitedly revealed plans for a small car and a garden behind the garage, where she could grow vegetables for the table and flowers for the house. The group explored the rocky, woodsy meadow nearby and admired the brook, envisioning it as a fairy and bird haven. Dorothy's enthusiasm for the land and its potential delighted her friends, who appreciated the beauty and variety the additional acres offered.|"['Question 1: What do bulbs not require from the soil to grow?\nA) Food\nB) Water\nC) Sunlight\nD) Air\nE) Nutrients', 'Question 2: What does the fiber in which bulbs grow provide?\nA) Sunlight\nB) Nutrients\nC) Water\nD) Air\nE) Space', 'Question 3: Who shared news about a garden plan with space for guests?\nA) Ethel Brown\nB) Elisabeth\nC) Miss Merriam\nD) Dorothy\nE) None of the above', 'Question 4: Where did Dorothy plan to grow vegetables for the table and flowers for the house?\nA) In the garage\nB) In the backyard\nC) In the meadow\nD) In the forest\nE) In the garden', 'Question 5: What did the group envision the brook as?\nA) A fairy and bird haven\nB) A swimming pool\nC) A fishing spot\nD) A picnic area\nE) A watering hole', ""Question 6: What did Dorothy's friends appreciate about the additional acres?\nA) The rocky terrain\nB) The woodsy meadow\nC) The brook\nD) The potential for a garden\nE) The lack of space""]"|['A) Food', 'C) Water', 'A) Ethel Brown', 'B) In the backyard', 'A) A fairy and bird haven', 'D) The potential for a garden']
The happy cries reached them, but their origin remained a mystery until Dorothy emerged from behind a rock, revealing what seemed to be a genuine cave. Eagerly, her friends accepted her invitation, finding ample space inside with room for a few more. Ethel Brown joked about the grass outside being an additional room if one didn't mind the lack of a roof. Enthusiastic about spending days in this shaded spot, they imagined themselves in the Scottish highlands. Della's idea to create a small fernery for her sick aunt brought them back to reality. As they walked through Fitz-James's woods, they admired the greenery and heard a tale of how the oak tree's leaves saved the world from destruction by the Evil Spirit.|"['1.

Ethel Blue excitedly suggested planting lovely shrubs once the workmen were done, drawing on her experience with her aunt ordering bushes. Roger, however, questioned if they had gardening tools, bringing their plans down to earth. He proposed using a piano box as a toolhouse, covering it with tar paper. Dorothy suggested focusing on a vegetable garden at another location. She envisioned a strip along the osage orange hedge with nasturtiums elsewhere. They discussed the various uses of different gourds, like making dippers or nest eggs. As they enjoyed hot chocolate and sandwiches, Mrs. Smith sang a song about the four seasons. Ethel Blue found the stanza mentioning winter fitting after their garden discussions. Despite their focus on gardens, they pondered how to serve others through their club activities, considering projects like helping poor women and children find respite at the old Emerson farmhouse.|['1.

In April, the young horticulturists at the Mortons' and Smiths' gardens planted various seeds like cosmos, four o'clocks, marigolds, petunias, and ageratums. They followed the seed catalog instructions and read pamphlets from the Department of Agriculture. They were careful not to plant frost-sensitive seeds too early, saving some for a second sowing in case of frost. Flowers like candytuft and mignonette were sowed at intervals for continuous blooming. The new garden layout was well planned to accommodate different plant needs. The young gardeners also took care of houseplants, learning to trim, wash, and protect them from pests. The families were excited about the garden's progress and the construction of Sweetbrier Lodge.

The group sat around on the rocks, enjoying their meal. Birds chirped overhead, leaves rustled in the trees, and chipmunks scurried nearby, unafraid of the visitors. Dorothy tried to feed a chipmunk from her hand, but it retreated to safety. The cave became well-organized within a month, with a successful storage box for their supplies. Glass jars kept their food safe from animals. They used a movable board as a table inside the cave, with stones and boxes as seats. They experimented with cooking vegetables, learning to cut corn and peel potatoes to cook them faster. Ethel Blue shared cooking tips she learned from her teacher.

"In botany, a leaf consists of a petiole, stipules, and a blade. The petiole is a small stalk that connects the leaf to the stem. At the base of the petiole, there are two tiny leaflets called stipules. The main part of the leaf that we often refer to as ""the leaf"" is actually the blade. Veins in leaves can be classified as net-veined or parallel-veined. Net-veined leaves have veins that form a network, while parallel-veined leaves have veins that run straight from the stem to the tip. Leaves can also vary in shape, such as lance-shaped, oblong, elliptical, oval, ovate, heart-shaped, kidney-shaped, ear-shaped, arrow-shaped, and halberd-shaped. Additionally, leaf tips can be described as pointed, acute, obtuse, truncate, notched, and more. Leaflets are smaller sections of a compound leaf, while a leaf is the entire structure attached to a stem."|['1.

Helen and her cousin discussed the different types of leaf shapes they had learned about that afternoon. They talked about '_pinnately compound_' and '_palmately compound_' leaves, depending on how the leaflets were arranged. They also spoke about the various edges of leaves like '_serrate_,' '_dentate_,' '_crenate_,' '_wavy_,' '_cut_,' '_cleft_,' '_lobed_,' and '_parted_.' Roger then joined the conversation and shared his observation about the lack of space for plants near the mill shanties. He suggested a community project to clear the area and create a garden. The plan involved getting contributions for fertilizers, using street sweepings and horse manure, and involving children in gardening as part of their nature study.

Mr. Wheeler welcomed his new assistant warmly as they discussed the plan for three gardens. Roger's Grandfather, a generous man, contributed money, seeds, and labor to the community project. The town also supported the initiative by providing a lot for the gardens. The Club members, including boys and girls, helped spread the word and register children interested in participating. Each child was assigned a plot, and two children shared each bed. The gardens were carefully tended, with flowers edging the plots and vines covering the fence. Children received guidance on caring for their plots, and their progress was tracked weekly. Some children even sold their harvested crops. The community project was a success, thanks to the collaboration of many individuals.|"[""1.

"Ethel Brown asked, ""Remember the girl from the Flower Festival?"" She saw her with him again at the field. When he stuck his cane down, clay stuck to it. He wiped it and gave it to her.

People started showing up at the Motor Inn for every meal, especially in the morning to avoid the midday heat during long journeys. Residents of Rosemont also began requesting accommodations for friends, transforming the old house into a bustling inn. Miss Foster, initially planning a tea room, now found herself managing a village hotel. The Ethels, struck by an idea while watching a motor party leave, proposed selling flowers from the inn. Miss Foster agreed to a trial week, appreciating the girls' initiative. The Ethels, realizing the commitment, sought approval from Mrs. Morton and Mrs. Smith.

"At noon, visitors from afar, dusty and hungry, arrived at the Inn and ordered lunch. While the women fixed their hair, the men inquired at the flower table. Ethel Blue, thrilled by her first sale, prepared a box of fresh blossoms while Ethel Brown assisted a man seeking bachelor's buttons for a lady with blue eyes. An older man bought buttonholes for all and requested a variety of flowers for the table. Later, more guests arrived for tea and dinner, drawn by the ""Rose House"" sign. The Ethels made over seven dollars in sales, gaining insights on customer preferences. They decided to keep flowers on plants and call for extra when needed. The scheme proved successful, leading to hiring a schoolmate to help. Financially sound, they doubled the rent payment to avoid feeling like charity.

The invalid reminisced happily about following flowers in summer. Excitedly, she pointed out the arrival of Joe-Pye-Weed. Planning meticulously, they inspected rooms, selected vases, and surveyed gardens for blossoms. Mr. Emerson lent his car for transporting flowers. Different colored flowers were grouped together for easy decorating. Each room was adorned with specific hues. The porch was cooled with ferns, the hall brightened with yellow posies, and the dining room decorated with blue lobelia and gypsophila. The drawing room featured pink poppies, snapdragons, and candytuft. Their efforts were well-received, resulting in more orders. The girls' success was attributed to thorough planning.

Mr. Clark cautiously reviewed the records presented by Hapgood, acknowledging their potential accuracy. However, he remained skeptical about Emily Leonard's relation to their family due to missing details. The date of Emily's birth was crucial to confirm her age for marriage in 1860. Resolute in his doubts, Mr. Clark decided to telegraph his nephew for further information. Meanwhile, Hapgood, unaware of Mr. Clark's suspicions, sent his own wire regarding the matter.

When you have personal memories that are dear to you, it can be challenging when someone tries to talk about them. Just like how everyone has their thoughts that should be respected, there are boundaries in people's lives that should not be crossed. Respecting someone's privacy is crucial. For instance, a simple gesture like knocking on a closed door before entering shows consideration and respect. This mutual respect is essential in maintaining healthy relationships. It is important to communicate your preferences clearly, just like how a parent and child show mutual respect for each other's space. By understanding and respecting boundaries, friendships can grow stronger. In a recent outing to the Botanical Garden and the Arboretum, Mary found herself feeling out of place in her fancy attire among her friends dressed in more suitable outfits for the occasion.

When the British were very close to Fort Duquesne, the French sent a small group, mostly Indians, to meet them. The English general didn't grasp Indian warfare and kept his soldiers grouped in the road, where they were shot down in large numbers, resulting in the loss of his own life. A town is named after him at the battle site. Washington assumed command after Braddock's death, marking his first true military experience. His focus was on capturing Fort Duquesne, and when General Forbes was sent out for another attempt, Washington led one of the Virginia regiments. The group traveled to Pittsburg, where they visited the city's landmarks and learned about its history. Pittsburg has a city organist who plays the great organ in the auditorium every Sunday, attracting thousands of people. The city's steel mills produce dense black smoke, adding to the industrial atmosphere.

He warned about dangers like suffocation from lack of air or explosions caused by 'fire damp' gas. This gas forms from decaying ferns and plants from the carboniferous age. The coal was created by the decay of huge trees and ferns, compressed over time to form a mineral. The group descended into the mine with oil lamps, passing through narrow passages to see the miners at work. The Superintendent showed them the fire-damp gas above, a potential danger. Despite the risks, the miners worked calmly. The visitors felt uneasy but followed the Superintendent to a gas-free area to witness something remarkable.|"['1.

The group explored a coal mine with a knowledgeable guide. They learned about the layers of coal and shale. Later, they crossed a river and saw the glow from coke ovens used in making steel. Ethel Brown understood the importance of coke in iron production. Mr. Emerson sought Stanley Clark, who had gone to Washington. They verified genealogy records to confirm Emily's lineage. Mr. Emerson planned to contact Hapgood for more information. The group anticipated meeting Stanley in Washington the next day.|"['1.
