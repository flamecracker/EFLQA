"During their time in Bournemouth, my husband and Mr. Henley worked on playwriting, creating titles for future use. Although my husband wasn't keen on dramatic composition, Mr. Henley's enthusiasm drew him in. After completing several plays and with his health suffering from the effort to keep up, my husband abandoned playwriting for good, returning to his true calling. Encouraged by my husband's support, I decided to write a play myself, inspired by the title ""The Hanging Judge."" Researching Old Bailey trials from 1700, we were captivated by Mr. Garrow's courtroom skills. This period also influenced my husband's novel, focusing on the Appin murder and introducing the character of Alan Breck. The Highlander's fiery spirit and quick temper added depth to the story. The legacy of the Appin murder still resonates in the region, sparking discussions and letters from clan members. The inspiration for our creative works often came from unexpected sources, like an old recipe book that led to the inclusion of a beauty lotion recipe in ""Kidnapped."" Our stories may raise questions, but the essence of the Highlands and historical events remains vivid in our narratives, offering readers a glimpse into another era before bedtime."|"[""1.

Dear Charles, I don't ask you to enjoy this story, but maybe your son will when he's older. He might be glad to see your name in it one day. It's a way for me to remember both the good and sad times.

"He searched for a comfy spot and settled on a large rock under a birch tree by the path. Sitting down with a serious expression, he covered his hat with a handkerchief as the sun beamed between the peaks. Raising a finger, he warned me about certain beliefs I should avoid and stressed the importance of prayer and reading the Bible. Then, he painted a picture of the grand house I was destined for and advised me on how to behave there. ""Be adaptable, Davie, in non-essential matters,"" he advised. After sharing some wise words, he presented me with a parcel containing four items. The first was money owed to me, the second a book, and the third a medicinal recipe. The fourth, a small Bible, symbolized his wish for my journey ahead. After a heartfelt farewell, he hurried back the way we came, leaving me with a mix of emotions.

Afterwards, I passed a shepherd's house and received directions towards Cramond. I then traveled westward by Colinton until I reached the Glasgow road. To my amazement, I saw a regiment marching in perfect harmony, led by a red-faced general and grenadiers with distinctive hats. The sight of the red coats and the lively music filled me with pride. As I ventured further, I inquired about the House of Shaws in Cramond parish. The responses I received were peculiar, hinting at something mysterious about the place. Despite warnings from locals, I persisted in my quest for the House of Shaws. At dusk, a woman directed me to a desolate building in a valley, the House of Shaws, shrouded in a curse and eerie history. Her ominous words left me shaken, instilling fear and doubt about my journey.|"[""1.

I sat down and gazed at the Shaws house. The more I looked, the more beautiful the countryside seemed with hawthorn bushes in full bloom, fields scattered with sheep, rooks flying high in the sky, and signs of fertile soil and a pleasant climate. However, the barracks in the center didn't sit well with me. As I sat by the ditch, country folk passed by, but I couldn't muster the courage to greet them. Eventually, the sun set, and against the yellow sky, I saw a wisp of smoke rising, indicating warmth and life. Encouraged, I followed a faint grassy track towards the house. The closer I got, the more desolate it appeared, like an unfinished wing of a house. The windows were unglazed, and bats fluttered in and out. As night fell, I approached the door, hesitated, then knocked. After a moment of silence, a man in a nightcap and holding a blunderbuss appeared at a window. He let me in, and the dimly lit room revealed sparse furnishings. The man, aged between fifty and seventy, was unkempt and avoided eye contact. Despite his appearance, he seemed like a caretaker of the empty house.|['1.

I was unsure whether to laugh or cry. The room was freezing, the bed damp. Luckily, I had my bundle and plaid. I wrapped myself in the plaid and lay on the floor near the big bed, quickly falling asleep. At dawn, I woke to find myself in a grand chamber with leather walls, embroidered furniture, and three windows. The room had seen better days, now damp and dirty with broken windows. The sun was shining outside, but the room was cold. I knocked until my jailer let me out. He took me to a well to wash, then I returned to the kitchen where my uncle was making porridge. After the meal, my uncle poured us ale, showing his thriftiness by measuring the exact amount. He then smoked his pipe by the window, asking about my friends and family. He promised to do right by me and asked me to keep our conversations private.|"['1.

Uncle Ebenezer was enraged, calling for a witch hunt due to his missing rowpit. Despite his hostility, he offered David old clothes and urged him to stay. David, feeling unwelcome, expressed his desire to leave. However, Ebenezer insisted that they would get along. David agreed to stay for the time being, hoping to mend their relationship. The day passed with cold porridge and silent conversations. David found solace in books left by his father, which distracted him from his distrust towards Uncle Ebenezer. He stumbled upon a note in a book, raising questions about his father's writing at a young age. When David inquired about his father's intellect, Ebenezer reacted strangely, avoiding the topic.

In the final moments, my uncle's sudden display of affection for my deceased father left me baffled, torn between fear and hope. I started to question his sanity and motives, recalling tales of rightful heirs and treacherous relatives. His secretive behavior only fueled my suspicions. He mentioned a promised sum of money, which I immediately sensed was a lie. As the night grew darker, a sense of foreboding crept over me. When my uncle handed me a sum of money, I knew there was more to his actions than met the eye. He then entrusted me with a task in the unlit stair-tower, instructing me to retrieve a chest containing papers. As I stepped into the darkness outside, a sudden burst of light illuminated the sky, leaving me momentarily blinded.|"[""1.

The tower was dark and challenging to navigate, but I cautiously made my way up the polished stone steps. The lightning flashes revealed the treacherous conditions I faced, including uneven steps and bats flying by. As I climbed, my determination grew stronger, fueled by anger and courage. I reached a dangerous turn where the stair abruptly ended, a fatal drop awaiting any misstep. Fear and sweat gripped me, but I retreated safely. The storm outside intensified, and I spotted my uncle in the rain, seemingly listening. A sudden thunderclap startled him, and he rushed inside, leaving the door ajar. I followed quietly, observing him drinking heavily in distress. His reaction to the thunder was peculiar, and he collapsed in a frightened state. I seized the opportunity to arm myself, finding a dirk hidden among his belongings.|"['1.

He lay as he had fallen, all huddled, with one knee up and one arm sprawling abroad; his face had a strange colour of blue, and he seemed to have ceased breathing. Fear came on me that he was dead; then I got water and dashed it in his face; and with that he seemed to come a little to himself, working his mouth and fluttering his eyelids. At last he looked up and saw me, and there came into his eyes a terror that was not of this world.I set him on a chair and looked at him. It is true I felt some pity for a man that looked so sick, but I was full besides of righteous anger; and I numbered over before him the points on which I wanted explanation: why he lied to me at every word; why he feared that I should leave him; why he disliked it to be hinted that he and my father were twins--“Is that because it is true?” I asked; why he had given me money to which I was convinced I had no claim; and, last of all, why he had tried to kill me. He heard me all through in silence; and then, in a broken voice, begged me to let him go to bed.And so weak was he that I could do nothing but consent. I locked him into his room, however, and pocketed the key, and then returning to the kitchen, made up such a blaze as had not shone there for many a long|['1.

I brought the man inside and he eagerly ate the leftovers of breakfast. Meanwhile, my uncle read a letter and then suddenly stood up with excitement. He took me to the corner of the room and informed me about a message from Captain Hoseason of the Covenant, a trading brig. My uncle proposed that we visit the captain and then the lawyer, Mr. Rankeillor. I thought about the idea and decided to go. The wind blew cold as we walked. The grass was white with daisies, and the trees were in bloom. Uncle Ebenezer walked silently as I chatted with the cabin-boy, Ransome. He showed me tattoo marks and bragged about his adventures. He spoke highly of Captain Hoseason, except for his lack of seamanship. The cabin-boy was proud of a wound inflicted by Mr. Shuan and displayed a stolen knife.|['1.

"I have never felt such pity for anyone in this wide world as I felt for that half-witted person, and it started to dawn on me that the brig Covenant, despite its pious name, was scarcely better than a hell on the seas. I inquired about the trade he was in, which seemed so dreadful, where he faced constant danger not just from wind and sea, but also from the cruel treatment of those in charge. He acknowledged the truth in my words and then proceeded to glorify the life, describing the pleasure of coming ashore with money to spend freely, buying apples, swaggering, and surprising what he referred to as ""stick-in-the-mud boys."" He went on to mention others who had it worse, like the unfortunate individuals sent overseas to North America for slavery or the even more pitiful innocents who were kidnapped for personal gain or revenge. At that moment, we reached the top of the hill and gazed down upon the Ferry and the Hope. The Firth of Forth narrows here, creating a convenient ferry crossing to the north and forming a sheltered harbor for ships. In the middle of the narrows sat an islet with ruins, while on the southern shore stood the Hawes Inn near a charming garden of holly-trees and hawthorns. The town of Queensferry lay further west, making the inn's surroundings appear desolate at that time as the boat had just departed north with passengers. A skiff rested"|['1.

The captain's suggestion led to my misfortune. Despite promising to keep an eye on my kinsman, the urge to see the sea and escape the stuffy room made me foolishly follow his advice to go play. I walked down to the beach, where small waves lapped the shore. The seaweed fascinated me with its various colors and textures. The salty air and sight of the Covenant preparing to sail stirred thoughts of distant lands. Observing the sailors with their rough appearance, I engaged in conversation with one, learning about the brig's departure. I then returned to Ransome, the least menacing of the group, and we enjoyed ale together. Realizing the landlord might be a valuable acquaintance, I inquired about Mr. Rankeillor and learned surprising news that left me in disbelief.|"[""1.

"""Indeed,"" he replied, ""he informed me about that. However, the boat will drop you off at the town pier, which is just a stone's throw away from Rankeillor's residence."" Then, leaning down, he whispered to me, ""Be cautious of the old fox; he has ill intentions. Come aboard so we can have a chat."" Linking his arm with mine, he continued loudly as we headed towards the boat, ""But tell me, what can I bring you from the Carolinas? Any friend of Mr. Balfour's is welcome to request.

As we approached the boat, he assisted me in boarding. I didn't hesitate; I believed I had found a trustworthy ally and was thrilled to see the ship. Once settled, the boat left the pier, and I was captivated by the movement, the sights, and the ship's grandeur. The captain's words were lost on me as I struggled to comprehend my surroundings. Upon reaching the ship, Hoseason insisted that we be the first to board. A tackle was lowered, hoisting me onto the deck where the captain awaited.

I lay in the dark, unable to tell day from night in the smelly ship's belly. Time dragged on as my misery deepened, making each hour feel like two. I feared the ship crashing or sinking, but sleep eventually dulled my sorrow. The next visit, I was in a daze, feeling sick and bound tightly. The lantern's light brought relief as the man with green eyes and the captain appeared. A discussion ensued about moving me to a better place, revealing tensions between them. The captain left, and the mate, possibly drunk, showed kindness. Waking up in the forecastle among rough but surprisingly kind shipmates, I recovered.

There was a man, around forty years old, who would sit by my bed for hours, sharing stories of his wife and child. He was a fisherman who lost his boat, forcing him into deep-sea voyages. This happened years ago, but I still remember him vividly. He often spoke of his young wife waiting for him in vain, never to see him again. Many sailors met a similar fate, lost to the deep seas. The ship was headed to the Carolinas, where white men were sold into slavery. The cabin-boy Ransome suffered silently from the cruelty on board. I tried to help him, but his mind was affected by the hardships endured at sea. The ship faced challenges with headwinds and rough seas, making life onboard difficult. Despite the hardships, a conversation with Mr. Riach gave me hope for a better future. He encouraged me to write to seek help and promised to assist me in finding justice.|"[""1.

Late one night, a sailor from Mr. Riach's watch came below deck for his jacket, sparking rumors that Shuan had harmed him. Captain Hoseason then appeared, searching the bunks with a lantern. Two seamen carried a pale boy named Ransome, his face unsettlingly serene, down the ladder. The ship veered sharply, revealing a bright sunset on the left. Unaware of their course around Scotland, the narrator believed they were halfway across the Atlantic. The round-house, where the narrator was to sleep, was well-equipped. Inside, Mr. Shuan sat at a table, seemingly dazed. The captain, Riach, and the narrator silently watched Shuan, who reached for a bottle before Riach threw it into the sea. The captain then instructed Shuan to rest, concealing the night's events from others.|"[""1.

My new duties began that first night, and the next day I settled into the routine. I served meals to the captain and the off-duty officer, ran errands for my three masters, and slept on a deck blanket. It was a tough job with interruptions, but Mr. Riach and the captain were patient. Mr. Shuan, however, seemed troubled, always staring and acting strangely. The crew's rough past haunted us, especially poor Ransome's fate. Despite the challenges, I had good company and was treated fairly. The ship faced more misfortune, but one night, we hit a boat in the fog. Only one man survived by clinging to our ship's bowsprit. He showed remarkable luck and strength, and when he came aboard, he remained calm, unlike the rest of us.|"['1.

He was small but agile, with a sunburnt face marked by freckles and small-pox scars. His eyes held a captivating yet unsettling gleam. Upon removing his coat, he revealed silver-mounted pistols and a large sword. The man's refined manners impressed the captain. The captain, more interested in the man's attire than his appearance, noted his fine clothes. A conversation ensued where the man, a Jacobite, expressed his troubled past and the captain, a Protestant, showed compassion. The Jacobite, fearing capture, sought passage to France. The captain was intrigued by the man's belt of guineas, which he claimed belonged to his chieftain. The Jacobite's story revealed the loyalty of Scottish tenants to their exiled chiefs. The captain pondered the implications of turning the man in for a reward. At that time, many exiled gentlemen risked their lives to return to Scotland.|['1.

The fog enveloped the ship, making it hard to see. The crew had halted the brig unsure of their location, with the wind not in their favor. Some sailors were on the lookout for danger, while the captain and officers whispered together. It seemed suspicious to the narrator. The captain suggested a plan to overpower someone on board. The narrator, named David, was given a key to the spirit locker by the captain to fetch weapons surreptitiously. David was torn between aiding the villains or facing death. Ultimately, he decided to confront a man named Alan Breck, who introduced himself as a Jacobite. Alan helped David arm himself and instructed him on how to defend the round-house, a strong part of the ship. The impending danger and the sound of the sea crashing against the ship filled David with dread as he prepared for a looming confrontation.|"['1.

The ship was calm, and I thought I heard whispers. Suddenly, the clash of swords echoed on the deck, indicating a fight had started. My heart raced, and I felt a mix of fear and anger.

After the commotion quieted down, one person took charge and seemed to be giving orders. Others responded briefly as if following instructions. I realized they were approaching again and informed Alan. I readied my pistols, bracing myself for what was to come. The silence that followed made me anxious, my mind consumed by thoughts of danger. Suddenly, stealthy steps and rustling clothes indicated their presence near the round-house. A single call signaled their attack. They rushed with cutlasses towards the door. Simultaneously, a man leaped through the skylight, landing on the floor. I hesitated to shoot, but when he grabbed me, fear turned to courage, and I fired. Another man fell through the skylight, and I shot him too. In the midst of the chaos, Alan fought bravely, driving the enemies away. After the scuffle, Alan embraced me, expressing his affection.

During our victory, Alan composed a song to celebrate, but I felt it didn't give me due credit for my role in the fight. I stood by him as we battled, and together we took down several enemies. I even wounded a key opponent, showing my worth in the skirmish. Despite my contributions, Alan's verses didn't capture my full involvement.

Throughout the day, the breeze remained strong and steady, gradually intensifying. By the afternoon, a swell emerged from the outer Hebrides. Sailing southwest, we faced the swell on our side, causing us to sway. As night fell and we altered our course towards the east, the sea was directly behind us. Before the swell, the day was delightful, with sunshine and towering islands surrounding us. Alan and I sat in the round-house, enjoying the captain's tobacco and exchanging stories. Alan, a Stewart, expressed his disdain for Campbells due to their history of mistreating his family. He shared a tale of his father's encounter with King George, showcasing his family's pride and swordsmanship. Alan's father left him with little, leading him to enlist, a decision he regretted.

Alan expressed his frustration with the Campbell clan's actions, particularly Red Colin's ruthless tactics to starve Ardshiel and drive out the loyal residents. He explained how Red Colin used lawyers and red-coats to force people from their homes.

Despite the Highlands being heavily guarded, Alan shared how he evaded capture using the hillside and friends' hideouts.

I will share more about my friend, who was skilled in various music genres, especially pipe music, a respected poet in his native language, and well-read in French and English literature. He excelled in marksmanship, angling, and fencing with the small sword and his preferred weapon. Although his faults were evident, particularly his tendency to take offense and provoke quarrels, he set this behavior aside during our time together out of respect for our shared experience in the round-house skirmish. As we cautiously stepped onto the deck, the sky was clear, the wind was strong and cold, with ample daylight and the bright moon casting a glow. The brig sailed close to round the southwest corner of Mull Island, battling the westerly swell. The captain's concern was palpable as he pointed to a fountain-like structure rising from the sea, followed by a distant roar, indicating treacherous reefs ahead. Despite the challenges, the crew pressed on, navigating through the moonlit night with Mr. Riach providing crucial guidance from the foretop.|['1.

Alan and Hoseason were on the brig when a sudden turn of events caused the ship to strike a reef near Mull. The impact threw everyone off balance, and the ship was in danger of breaking apart. Despite the chaos, they worked together to launch a skiff and save as many people as possible. The wounded were helped out, and even the captain, who seemed stunned, was deeply affected by the situation. As they struggled, a massive wave hit the ship, causing it to tilt and throwing the narrator overboard. He fought against the turbulent sea, but eventually found himself near the shore of Earraid. Cold and exhausted, he realized the danger of the tide race but managed to reach safety on the landward side.|"['1.

I couldn't swim, but I clung to a yard and kicked my way to shore in a small, quiet bay. The moonlit land seemed deserted and desolate as I finally reached dry land, exhausted and grateful. Alone on the shore in the cold night, I dared not rest for fear of freezing. As dawn broke, I climbed a hill to find no sign of the ship or my shipmates. Hungry and weary, I set off along the coast, hoping for shelter and news. Encountering a creek, I realized I was stranded on a barren isle. Attempting to wade across, I fell in and narrowly escaped. Remembering the yard that had helped me before, I trudged back to retrieve it, determined to find a way out despite the challenges ahead.|['1.

I reached the bay, exhausted, and noticed that the yard seemed farther out than before. I waded into the sea, feeling the water splash my face. As I ventured deeper, my feet began to lose touch, so I dared not go further. The yard bobbed about twenty feet away. My time on the island was dreadful. I had no tools or supplies, just money and a silver button. I survived on limpets and periwinkles, but they made me sick at first. The island was desolate, with only birds and gulls. I settled near a hut where fishermen stayed. I could see Iona church and smoke from the Ross, which gave me hope. Despite the solitude, the sight of human life kept me going. Hope lingered as I watched for boats or people, even though no help arrived.|['1.

King Charles II once claimed that more days could be spent outdoors in England's climate than anywhere else, a luxury he enjoyed with dry clothes and a palace nearby. However, my luck was far worse on a rainy isle. Despite it being summer, rain persisted for over a day until the third afternoon. That day was full of surprises. I spotted a red deer, then a guinea-piece fell near me and rolled into the sea. When I retrieved my money from sailors, some was missing. I found a third guinea later. With only a few pounds left, I felt pitiful. Drenched, hungry, and weak, I sought solace on a rock, where the sun's warmth gave me hope. A boat passed by, ignoring my pleas, leaving me heartbroken and desperate.|"[""1.

When I was no longer angry, I had to eat again, but I despised the food so much that I could barely eat it. Unfortunately, the fish I ate made me sick once more. I experienced severe pain, a sore throat, shivering, and a terrible sense of illness. I thought I was dying and made peace with God. However, as night fell, I realized my situation had improved slightly. The next day, I felt weak but the sun was shining, and the shellfish I ate boosted my spirits. I began to hope and fear that the men who had left me might return. When I saw a boat approaching, my heart raced with excitement. It was the same boat with two men and a new man who seemed of higher status. Despite my pleas, they remained at a distance, and the new man seemed to mock me. They spoke in Gaelic, which I didn't understand, causing the man to become angry. In frustration, I ran back to the island, realizing it was a tidal islet that could be crossed during low tide. If only I had realized this earlier, I wouldn't have suffered so much.|"['1.

The rugged and trackless Ross of Mull resembled the isle the narrator had just left, with bog, brier, and big stones. Guided only by his nose and the landmark of Ben More, he aimed for the smoke he had seen from the island. After a challenging journey, he arrived at a turf-roofed house where an old gentleman welcomed him warmly. The narrator was treated to oat-bread, a cold grouse, and a strong punch, feeling like he was in a palace despite the humble abode. The hospitality of the old gentleman and his wife, who gave him an old bonnet, left the narrator feeling fortunate and grateful. The next day, after a restful sleep and good food, the narrator continued his journey toward Torosay, encountering poverty, beggars, and the challenge of communication due to language barriers.|['1.

I was furious and turned to the wealthy man, Hector Maclean, who witnessed our agreement and my payment. But Maclean had already indulged in the punch and insisted no one could leave until the bowl was empty. So, I had to endure Jacobite toasts and Gaelic songs until everyone was tipsy and retired for the night. The next day, my guide delayed us by three hours due to his drinking habits. As we left Maclean's house, everything seemed fine until we were out of sight. The guide then pointed out Torosay and a hill as our landmark. Enraged, I tried to strike him, but he drew a knife. In the scuffle, I disarmed him and left him barefoot. Later, I encountered a blind man armed with a pistol, who questioned me and grew hostile.

He quickly turned polite, attempting to persuade me, but failed. He cursed me in Gaelic and left. I observed him walking away, disappearing over the hill. Relieved to be alone after parting ways with the troublesome men, I continued my journey to Torosay. The innkeeper, a Maclean, engaged me in friendly competition, showcasing his knowledge in French and Latin. We bonded over punch until he became emotional. I cautiously showed him Alan's button, but he was unfamiliar with it. He warned me about Duncan Mackiegh, a dangerous man accused of crimes. After a restful night, I headed to the ferry at Torosay, crossing to Kinlochaline.

Despite this, he acknowledged a sense of respect for Alan's character. The conversation shifted to the political turmoil involving James of the Glens and Colin Campbell, with tenants being forced to leave their homes. Henderland expressed concern for the situation, highlighting the complexities of the Appin Stewarts' dealings. As they walked, Henderland offered the narrator a place to stay for the night.

As we arrived at Mr. Henderland's home, I was surprised by his abrupt behavior. Unlike the usual Highland politeness, he hurried past me, grabbed a jar and spoon, and indulged in excessive snuff-taking, followed by a series of sneezes. He explained that he had vowed not to carry the snuff, inspired by the sacrifices of martyrs. After a simple meal of porridge and whey, Mr. Henderland earnestly inquired about my faith, moving me to tears with his humility and goodness. He even offered me sixpence for my journey, leaving me touched by his kindness. The next day, he arranged for a boat to take me across the Loch, saving me time and money on my travels. The journey was through a dark, serene sea surrounded by imposing mountains in Appin. A red-clad group of soldiers in the distance stirred unease within me, adding to my doubts about joining Alan, an outlaw.

I saw a group approaching, and without reason, I decided to continue my journey. I asked for directions to Aucharn, but the man seemed suspicious. He mentioned a warning and the lawyer's power.

At last, around half-past ten, we reached the top of a hill and spotted lights below us. There was a house with an open door emitting a warm glow of fire and candlelight. Several figures were scurrying around the house and farm buildings, each carrying a torch. Alan remarked that James must have lost his mind, as soldiers would have caused trouble. Alan signaled with three whistles, causing the torchbearers to pause and then resume their activities. As we descended, a tall man greeted us in Gaelic, which Alan requested he switch to English for my benefit. The man, James, expressed worry about the aftermath of an incident in Appin. The servants were frantically burying weapons, and the atmosphere was chaotic and tense. James ushered me into the kitchen, where his family was distressed and agitated.

When I returned, Alan had likely shared his story as preparations were underway for our flight. They armed us with swords and pistols, despite my lack of skill with the former. Equipped with ammunition, oatmeal, a pan, and French brandy, we were set for the journey. However, we lacked funds. I had two guineas, Alan only seventeen pence, and James a mere three-and-five-pence-halfpenny. James advised us to find a safe place nearby and contact him.

Alan and David ran for their lives, with David struggling to keep up due to fatigue, bruises, and the effects of brandy.

Alan and Davie found themselves in a precarious situation, hiding from soldiers in a narrow valley. They took turns lying on a scorching rock under the blazing sun, enduring the heat without water, only having raw brandy to drink. The soldiers patrolled the valley, making it challenging to move undetected. As the day wore on, the sun became unbearable, and the soldiers' presence intensified.

By evening, we had covered some ground, despite our slow pace, with the sentry still visible on the rock. However, we stumbled upon something that alleviated our fears - a rushing stream that cascaded down to meet the river in the glen. Overjoyed, we threw ourselves on the ground and immersed ourselves in the water. The refreshing shock of the cool stream and the thirst-quenching gulp were equally delightful. We lay hidden by the banks, drinking, bathing, and feeling rejuvenated. Unable to make a fire, we settled for a meal of oatmeal mixed with cold water. As night fell, we continued cautiously, then more confidently, walking at a steady pace. The intricate path led us up steep mountainsides and along cliff edges. The moon eventually rose, illuminating the dark night and revealing the vast landscape below. The journey continued, guided by moonlight, through a picturesque wood filled with sounds of nature.|"['1.

Alan and his friend planned a secret signal to meet a man, John Breck, in the woods. They crafted a cross to send a message. Alan cleverly thought through John's likely reactions to the signal. They left the cross in John's window and waited anxiously for his response. The next day, they saw a ragged man approaching. Alan guided the man to their hiding spot with whistles.

Alan and I found ourselves in a situation of danger and disguise. Alan, described in detail with his feathered hat and tarnished lace, and I, in ragged clothes, were trying to stay safe.

In the early night, a trumpet sound signaled the gathering of a troop. They camped in the middle of the wasteland, and Alan declared there would be no rest. The night grew cooler and darker, but the sky remained clear. Heavy dew fell, refreshing them momentarily. As they walked, anger and despair consumed the narrator, dragging on like a worm. Alan, adept at soldiering, urged them forward despite weariness. The approaching dawn brought relief as they navigated the danger. However, they stumbled into an ambush, with dirks at their throats.

There was no such thing possible for me. Grasshoppers whirring in the grass in the summer? Well, I had no sooner closed my eyes, than my body, and above all my head, belly, and wrists, seemed to be filled with whirring grasshoppers; and I must open my eyes again at once, and tumble and toss, and sit up and lie down; and look at the sky which dazzled me, or at Cluny’s wild and dirty sentries, peering out over the top of the brae and chattering to each other in the Gaelic. That was all the rest I had, until the messenger returned; when, as it appeared that Cluny would be glad to receive us, we must get once more upon our feet and set forward. Alan was in excellent good spirits, much refreshed by his sleep, very hungry, and looking pleasantly forward to a dram and a dish of hot collops, of which, it seems, the messenger had brought him word. For my part, it made me sick to hear of eating. I had been dead-heavy before, and now I felt a kind of dreadful lightness, which would not suffer me to walk.

In a secluded spot, we met Cluny, a peculiar host with precise habits from his long seclusion. He had a special spot no one could sit in, a Cage arranged just so, and a love for cooking. He lived alone, communicating only with his guards and attendants. Cluny held patriarchal sway over his clan, settling disputes and commanding respect. Despite being hunted, he retained authority. Cluny's gillies greeted him ceremoniously, showing both respect and fear. Stories of Prince Charlie's stay were shared, painting a picture of a gracious but flawed prince. Cluny then suggested a game of cards, which I declined due to personal beliefs, causing some tension. Alan vouched for me, defending my choice. Cluny, though displeased, offered me a bed for the night.|"[""1.

After indulging in brandy and venison, I felt a strange heaviness and slipped into a trance during our stay at the Cage. Sometimes I was aware of my surroundings, other times it felt like a dream. The plaids on the wall seemed to dance with the firelight shadows. I was unwell, unable to understand the Gaelic-speaking doctor's diagnosis. Alan and Cluny were engrossed in cards, with a pile of guineas on the table. The luck turned on the second day, but I awoke on the third day feeling relieved and weak. Sitting outside in the wood, I observed Cluny's scouts passing by. Cluny was irritated by my actions and words. The situation with the cards and gold made me uneasy.

During our journey through the rough terrain, the relentless rain and biting cold made every step a struggle. I shivered uncontrollably, my throat ached, and a sharp pain pierced my side. Sleeping in the wet, muddy ground brought back haunting memories of past dangers. Alan, my companion, tried to help, but my anger and sickness kept me distant. As the rain poured down and the mist enveloped us, the sound of rushing rivers filled the air. Alan's concern grew as my condition worsened. Despite his efforts to show kindness, I remained resentful and unforgiving. The nights passed with little conversation, only Alan's whistling and teasing remarks. As we approached Balquhidder, the weather cleared, but my exhaustion and sickness persisted. Alan's taunts only fueled my bitterness, and in my weakened state, I found solace in the idea of a solitary death in the wilderness.|"['1.

While I felt my condition worsening, I continued to walk with Alan until I could go no further. Flushes of heat and shuddering spasms overcame me, making the stitch in my side unbearable. Feeling like I couldn't continue, I suddenly wanted to confront Alan about his insults. I stopped and addressed him, questioning his manners for mocking my politics. Alan, with a smirk, began whistling a tune. In response, I criticized his behavior and his allies. This led Alan to draw his sword, but he quickly dropped it, overwhelmed with guilt.

During my time in hiding, Alan refused to leave me, despite my attempts to persuade him. His bravery in staying with me became a topic of discussion among our few friends who were aware of our secret. Alan would hide during the day in a hole under the hills near a small wood and visit me at night when it was safe.

The time I spent recovering turned into a festive period, especially at night when we celebrated with music played by Duncan Dhu, our host. Despite soldiers passing by and no inquiries made, my presence was known in Balquhidder and neighboring areas.

Alan and Robin, two men on the brink of a quarrel, found themselves in a tense situation. However, Duncan, a mediator, cleverly diverted their attention by suggesting a friendly competition of playing the bagpipes. With Duncan's encouragement, the men set aside their differences and indulged in a musical showdown. Robin impressed everyone with his skilled piping, but Alan, initially taken aback, eventually acknowledged Robin's superior talent.

The argument was resolved, and the celebration lasted all night with food and music. The next day, despite feeling unwell from the festivities, Robin finally considered the journey ahead. With little money left, speed was crucial to reach Mr. Rankeillor's aid before starvation set in. Alan suggested a risky but unexpected route to bypass the watchful eye of pursuers.

In Limekilns, we found a small inn with a wand above the door. Inside, we bought bread and cheese from a pretty maid. Carrying our food, we planned to eat by the sea. While walking, I gazed across the water, feeling heartbroken about my situation. Alan stopped and remarked on my appearance, suggesting I looked like a ragged thief. He wanted the maid to pity me, not find me attractive. We returned to the inn for our boat, with Alan pretending I was exhausted and ill. He fed me brandy and food, putting on a show of care and concern. The maid was drawn to our act, but Alan, in a playful manner, scolded her for not understanding my hardships.

I was embarrassed about how to express my gratitude; she was equally embarrassed at the thought of hearing it. Urging us to hurry and keep quiet, she swiftly set us on the Lothian shore near Carriden, bid us farewell, and rowed back to Limekilns. My companion praised her, calling her a fine lass. As we lay in a den by the shore, he commended her character again. I felt remorse and fear for involving her in our situation. The next day, we agreed on a plan for my companion to wait near Newhalls until he heard me whistle. I was in Queensferry early, feeling ashamed of my appearance. As the day progressed, my worry grew.

"""Indeed,"" Mr. Rankeillor agreed. ""It was likely inevitable. He must have realized his actions were not honorable. Those aware of the truth shunned him, while those ignorant of it suspected foul play when one brother vanished, and the other inherited the estate. He found himself ostracized from all sides. Money was his only gain, and he grew more obsessed with it. Selfish in his youth, selfish in old age, his facade of manners and charm faded. The estate rightfully belongs to you, despite what your father signed, as you are the rightful heir. However, your uncle is combative and may question your identity. Lawsuits are costly and scandalous, especially family disputes. It is best to reach a peaceful agreement with your uncle, avoiding public scrutiny and potential revelations.
