"Alice, unhurt, quickly got up and found herself in a dark passage. The white rabbit was still visible, so she hurried after it. She entered a long hall with locked doors, feeling trapped. Discovering a glass table with a golden key, she tried it in vain on the large locks. Eventually, she found a tiny door and the key fit perfectly. Beyond it was a charming garden, but she was too big to enter. A bottle labeled ""DRINK ME"" appeared, and after checking for poison, she drank it, shrinking to ten inches. Now the right size, she tried to retrieve the key but couldn't reach it. Crying, she found a cake labeled ""EAT ME."" Hoping it would help her, she ate a bit but stayed the same size. Frustrated, Alice marveled at the strange turn of events."|"['1.

"Alice found herself in a neat room with a table by the window holding a mirror and a few pairs of small white gloves. She picked up a pair of gloves and was about to leave when she noticed a little bottle near the mirror. Without a label saying ""drink me,"" she uncorked it and took a sip, hoping for an interesting outcome. She wished to grow larger and, as she drank, her head hit the ceiling. Panicking, she knelt, then lay down, but kept growing. Finally, she stretched one arm out the window and one foot up the chimney, feeling trapped and uncomfortable. Just as she worried about her predicament, the magic bottle's effects stopped, leaving her stuck but no longer growing.

Alice found herself in a peculiar situation. She decided to kick down the chimney to confront an animal she thought was Bill. A series of voices arose, suggesting to burn the house down. Alice threatened to set Dinah, her pet, on them. She then shrank in size and fled the house, encountering a group of animals outside. One of the animals was a little green lizard named Bill. Alice ran into a nearby wood to figure out how to reach a beautiful garden. As she pondered, an enormous puppy appeared, and Alice tried to play with it using a stick. The puppy joyfully engaged in the play, causing Alice to dodge around a thistle to avoid getting trampled. Despite the puppy's size, Alice found it endearing and wished she could teach it tricks. She then realized she needed to grow back to her normal size but was unsure how to achieve this transformation.|['1.
