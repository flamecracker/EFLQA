In the ancient jungle, a severe drought struck, causing streams to dry up and pools to shrink. The animals, once fierce hunters, now found themselves weak and thirsty, forced to become companions instead. Even the fiercest predators like the Pack-wolf and the tall buck were humbled by the scarcity of water. The heat turned the lush green jungle into a barren, blackened land. Birds and monkeys fled north, while deer and wild pigs perished near human villages. Mowgli, once carefree, now scavenged for food and water, surviving on meager resources. The animals, including Bagheera the panther, struggled to find sustenance. Finally, the wise elephant Hathi declared a Water Truce, marking the desperate need for cooperation among all creatures to survive the harsh conditions.|"['1.

In the Jungle, there is a Law that forbids killing at watering holes during the Water Truce. This rule exists because water is essential for survival, even more than food. All animals in the Jungle must come together at the same water source when it is scarce, putting a pause on hunting. In the past, coming to drink at the Waingunga or any other place was risky, adding excitement to the night's activities. However, during the Water Truce, all hunting stops, and the animals, including tigers, bears, deer, buffaloes, and pigs, gather around the shrunken river, exhausted and hungry.

“We really wish so,” said a young fawn, born that spring, not enjoying the situation. Even Hathi chuckled, and Mowgli laughed, beating the water. The chatter spread at the drinking spots. Pigs asked for space, buffaloes grunted, and deer shared tales of their struggles for food. The wind carried bad news from across the river. Mowgli was explaining when Bagheera playfully pushed him into the water. Shere Khan, the Lame Tiger, arrived, mocking Mowgli. The animals whispered, “He has killed a Man!” All eyes turned to Hathi, who remained calm. Shere Khan boasted, but Hathi’s authority silenced him.

In the Jungle, long ago, all creatures lived peacefully until a tragic event changed everything. The First of the Elephants, Tha, created the Jungle, but a dispute between two bucks led to the death of one. The First of the Tigers, who was the judge of the Jungle, lost control and killed the buck. This was the first death in the Jungle, and chaos ensued as the animals fought amongst themselves. Tha returned and asked who had killed the buck, but the animals were too scared to admit the truth. To reveal the killer, Tha commanded the trees and creepers to mark him. The Gray Ape then declared himself the new master of the Jungle. This event marked the beginning of fear and hierarchy among the Jungle creatures.|"['1.

Once upon a time in the Jungle, the Gray Ape caused chaos and mischief, leading to a lack of order and law. Tha, a wise leader, saw the need for a Law to bring peace and discipline. Fear was introduced as a consequence of breaking this Law. The First of the Tigers, initially proud and fearless, encountered Fear and was humbled by it. Tha granted the tigers one night each year to reclaim their former glory and not fear Man, who was called the Hairless One.

The thunder rumbled across the hills, but no rain fell, only heat and lightning. Hathi spoke of a time when the First of the Tigers had killed Fear. But Tha warned that Death would now follow the tiger, as he had taught Man to kill. The Jungle Peoples would shun him, and only Fear would be his companion. The tiger, in his arrogance, believed he was safe in the night, but Tha reminded him that there was a price to pay for teaching Man to kill. The story explained how the Hairless One learned to strike from afar, causing fear among the Jungle animals. Despite this, the Hairless One still feared the Tiger on one night each year, as a reminder of the shame the First Tiger brought upon himself. Fear continued to roam the Jungle, a consequence of the First Tiger's actions.|"['1.

Mowgli questioned why the First of the Tigers turned to eating hot meat instead of continuing to graze like other animals. Baloo explained that the trees and creepers marked him, transforming him into a predator seeking revenge on the Eaters of Grass. To illustrate the diversity of the Jungle Law, Baloo recited laws that apply to wolves in verse. Shifting to a different tale, Purun Dass, a Brahmin Prime Minister, navigated the complexities of power dynamics between native traditions and English influence. Despite his rise to prominence and accolades, he eventually renounced his titles and wealth to become a Sunnyasi, a wandering mendicant. His departure was met with salutes, signaling the end of an era as he embraced a life of simplicity and detachment from worldly possessions.|"['1.

Purun Bhagat collapsed beside the hill, exhausted from the rain and the steep climb. Before losing consciousness, he instructed the torchbearers to stay put and count their numbers.

"Mowgli stood before his friends, tears in his eyes, demanding their attention. He knelt before the wolves, urging them to look at him. They hesitated, but Mowgli's gaze held them, making their hair bristle and bodies tremble. Quietly, he moved through the Jungle, intersecting Buldeo's path. Buldeo, tracking Mowgli's trail, was unaware of the wolves surrounding him. Mowgli observed silently as Buldeo searched for the trail, even smoking a pipe. Charcoal-burners joined Buldeo, listening to his fabricated tales of Mowgli. Buldeo planned to kill Mowgli before dealing with Messua and her husband, whom the village accused of being the parents of the ""Devil-child."" Buldeo intended to report their deaths as snake bites.

“What do the wolves say? What do they say?” the wolves repeated every few minutes; and Mowgli interpreted until he reached the witch part of the story, which he found a bit challenging. He mentioned that the man and woman who had been kind to him were in trouble. “He says. I can't understand the conversation. They all seem crazy. Why would Messua and her husband be caught in a trap because of me, and what's with all this talk about the Red Flower? I need to investigate this. Whatever they plan for Messua won't happen until Buldeo returns. So--” Mowgli pondered, his fingers fiddling with the skinning-knife handle, while Buldeo and the charcoal-burners bravely marched in a single line. “I don't need that.

The morning dew has vanished, leaving the jungle dry. The Four animals hear a call to rest, following the Jungle Law. Mowgli, on a mission to save Messua and her husband, arrives at the village. He frees them from captivity and is recognized by Messua as her lost son. Mowgli, feeling a mix of emotions, recalls how Messua cared for him as a child. As the villagers become distracted, Mowgli senses danger approaching with the return of Buldeo. He knows trouble lies ahead but remains determined to protect those in need. Outside, shouts and commotion signal Buldeo's return, adding to the tension in the village.|"[""1.

Mowgli swiftly entered the hut, where the tense atmosphere lingered. Outside, Buldeo was recounting tales of devils and enchantment to a curious crowd. Mowgli, unimpressed, knew the villagers would soon turn their attention to Messua and her husband. With a plan in mind, he assured them that no harm would come as long as they followed his lead to safety in Khanhiwara. Despite the looming threat of fire, they prepared to venture into the dark Jungle, where the night air felt cool but foreboding.

Messua encouraged her husband to move forward, and as darkness enveloped them, Mother Wolf, and Bagheera, the panther, emerged beneath Mowgli's feet, thrilled by the wild night. Bagheera, with eyes ablaze, offered to confront the Four. He expressed readiness for killing, fueled by the excitement of the night. Bagheera questioned the significance of Man, referring to them as diggers, toothless and earth-eaters. He boasted about tracking men all day and herding them like wolves herd prey. Mowgli challenged Bagheera, speaking in the village dialect, not the Jungle's language, which halted the panther in his tracks. Mowgli stared into Bagheera's eyes until the panther calmed down, lying like a contented cat.

Bagheera being a stray fawn deeply upset Mowgli. He laughed, sobbed, and laughed again until he had to jump into a pool to calm down. Meanwhile, Hathi and his sons roamed silently through the valleys, watched by the Jungle inhabitants. A rumor spread of better food elsewhere, leading animals like deer, pig, and nilghai to move in herds. The Eaters of Flesh followed, pushing the creatures towards the village. Eventually, Hathi and his sons destroyed the village's defenses, causing chaos as animals trampled crops. The villagers, facing starvation, decided to flee.

The Jackal implied that the Mugger had been consuming fresh food daily during his journey, unlike most wild beasts who preserve their food. The Adjutant intervened, urging them to focus on the journey's outcome. The Mugger then recounted encountering a boat of living white-faces, including women and a child, on the river. The child innocently played with the water, drawing the Mugger's attention. Despite rising to playfully catch the child's hands, the Mugger refrained from harming them, realizing they were too small and innocent. The women's distress and the child's innocence left a lasting impression on the Mugger, emphasizing the unpredictability of human nature."|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a Mugger by the river shared a tale with a Jackal about a mysterious woman who shot him five times with an unknown gun. The Jackal, in awe of the Mugger's story, believed every word without question. The Mugger, wounded by the woman, could not turn his head to show the proof. Despite the civility, the Mugger did not want his children to know of his only wound from a woman. The river witnessed a strange phenomenon where bodies of the dead floated downstream, causing fear even in the Mugger. The Mugger, overwhelmed by the events, left the area only to return to find his village thriving as if nothing had happened.

Once upon a time, a wise old Mugger lived by the river, watching over his people. He had seen much and decided to stay close to his village. The Jackal, impressed by the Mugger's tales of good eating, asked what the protector of the poor did next. The Mugger vowed never to roam again and found contentment by the Ghaut. However, he couldn't forget a little white child he missed catching. The Mugger wished to try one new thing before he died. As the Mugger rested, the Jackal heard approaching footsteps and warned of the English coming to speak with the Mugger.

The two Englishmen were on a bridge, hunting a dangerous crocodile known as the Mugger of Mugger-Ghaut. They were determined to stop the crocodile's reign of terror after it had caused trouble for the villagers. With a loud shot from a powerful gun, they successfully took down the massive crocodile. The men admired the size of the beast before deciding to keep the skull as a trophy. One of the Englishmen shared a childhood memory of encountering a crocodile when he was just a child.

In the jungle, Kaa, the Rock Python, shed his skin for the two-hundredth time. Mowgli, grateful for Kaa's past help, visited to congratulate him. Skin-shedding made Kaa moody until his new skin sparkled. Kaa accepted Mowgli as the Jungle Master and shared news of the Middle Jungle. Mowgli sat within Kaa's coils, feeling the old skin. Mowgli admired the skin's beauty, comparing it to a lily's mottling. Playfully, Mowgli attempted to lift Kaa, but Kaa, amused, remained still. They engaged in their evening game, a wrestling match where Kaa displayed only a fraction of his strength. This game, taught by Kaa, helped strengthen Mowgli's limbs. Despite Mowgli's efforts, Kaa always won with a swift head blow, ending their playful match.|"['1.

"""Good hunting!"" Kaa grunted finally, and Mowgli, as usual, was thrown away a few yards, laughing and gasping. He got up, his hands full of grass, and followed Kaa to the wise snake's favorite bathing spot—a dark pool surrounded by rocks and sunken tree-stumps. Mowgli slipped in silently, dived across, and floated on his back, watching the moon above the rocks. Kaa's head cut the water like a razor, resting on Mowgli's shoulder. They lay quietly, enjoying the cool water. ""It's very good,"" Mowgli said sleepily. ""Now, in the Man-Pack, they lie on hard wood inside a mud trap, shutting out the clean winds. It's better in the Jungle."" ""Not all,"" said Mowgli. ""Else there would be a new Shere Khan every month. We all feel this way,"" he continued.

In the depths of the vault, a colossal white cobra emerged before Mowgli, nearly eight feet long, its hood faded to a pale yellow. The cobra, known as the White Cobra, inquired about the grand city it once guarded. The creature boasted of its lineage and its role as the Warden of the King's Treasure. It spoke of the riches hidden beneath a stone, treasures of a hundred kings, protected by the cobra's watchful eyes. The White Cobra challenged the truthfulness of Mowgli's claims about the city's demise, daring him to take the treasures if he could survive the journey out. The cobra revealed the vast wealth within the vault, with coins and jewels strewn across the floor, including precious artifacts and gems beyond imagination.|"[""Question 1: What is the White Cobra's role in the grand city it once guarded?\nA) Protector of the citizens\nB) Keeper of the King's Treasure\nC) Master of the marketplace\nD) Guardian of the city gates\nE) Ruler of the kingdom"", 'Question 2: What challenge does the White Cobra present to Mowgli?\nA) To race through the city\nB) To solve a riddle\nC) To find a hidden key\nD) To survive the journey out\nE) To tame a wild elephant', 'Question 3: How does the White Cobra describe the treasures hidden in the vault?\nA) Weapons of war\nB) Books of ancient knowledge\nC) Riches of a hundred kings\nD) Seeds for the future\nE) Tools for farming', ""Question 4: What color is the White Cobra's hood in the passage?\nA) Green\nB) Red\nC) Blue\nD) Yellow\nE) Black"", ""Question 5: What does the White Cobra challenge the truthfulness of Mowgli's claims about?\nA) The weather in the city\nB) The population of the city\nC) The city's demise\nD) The location of the city gates\nE) The city's architecture"", ""Question 6: What is the White Cobra's lineage according to the passage?\nA) Descendant of a dragon\nB) Offspring of a lion\nC) Relative of a tiger\nD) Ancestor of a serpent\nE) Progeny of a bear""]"|"[""B) Keeper of the King's Treasure"", 'D) To survive the journey out', 'C) Riches of a hundred kings', 'D) Yellow', ""C) The city's demise"", 'D) Ancestor of a serpent']"
The White Cobra was correct. No amount of money could match the worth of the treasure, a collection amassed over centuries from war, plunder, trade, and taxes. The coins alone were invaluable, not to mention the precious stones. The sheer weight of the gold and silver could be hundreds of tons. In India, every native ruler has a secret hoard, constantly adding to it. Mowgli, however, didn't grasp the significance. Among the treasure, he found an ankus, an elephant-goad, adorned with rubies, turquoises, and other gems. Intrigued by the pictures of elephant-catching on it, Mowgli desired to take it. The Cobra, the guardian of the treasure, warned Mowgli but was swiftly subdued by Kaa, the python, when Mowgli flung the ankus, pinning the Cobra down.|"['1.

"""No,"" he said, as he drew the blade; ""I will never kill again except for food. But look, Kaa!"" He caught the snake behind the hood, forced the mouth open with the knife blade, and revealed the deadly poison-fangs of the upper jaw lying black and withered in the gum. The White Cobra had outlived its poison, as a snake will. ""See, that thing can kill you in the end. It is Death! Remember, it is Death! There is enough in that thing to kill many men. Not long will you keep it, Jungle Man, nor will the one who takes it from you. They will kill for its sake! My strength is gone, but the ankus will do my work. It is Death! It is Death! It is Death!"" Mowgli crawled back into the passage, where the last thing he saw was the White Cobra striking at the golden faces of the gods on the floor and hissing, ""It is Death!""

Kadlu, an Inuit, belonged to the Tununirmiut tribe in the far north, where ice and snow cover the land for nine long, dark months each year.

In the Arctic, an Inuit family faced a harsh winter. Kadlu, Kotuko, Amoraq, and the boy-baby lived contently until a terrible winter struck. The tribe lost hunters, and food became scarce. Kotuko, the boy, braved the freezing cold to hunt seals, enduring long waits and bitter cold. The family's lamps burned low as famine loomed, and the fear of darkness in the long Arctic nights grew. Despite the challenges, they shared what little they had, never wasting any part of the seal they caught. The Inuit's resilience and unity were tested as they struggled to survive the brutal winter in the unforgiving Arctic landscape.|['1.

The hungry dogs snarled in the passages, staring at the stars and sniffing the cold wind night after night. The silence that followed was heavy, like a snowdrift against a door. Kotuko's dog, usually moody, nudged him one night. Though patted, the dog kept pushing forward, seeking comfort. Kadlu, awakened, peered into the dog's eyes. The dog whimpered and shivered. Suddenly, the dog growled and barked joyfully, then ran off. The madness caused by hunger and darkness spread among the dogs. Kotuko sadly had to put down another sick dog. The remaining dogs, tied and fed, looked fearful and hopeless. Kotuko, weakened by hunger and cold, began hearing voices and seeing things. Sedna, the Mistress of the Underworld, guides Kotuko and a girl from the North on a journey.|"[""**1.

Through the village, people cheered, saying, “The tornait spoke to Kotuko. They will guide him to open ice. He will bring back seals for us!” Their voices faded into the cold darkness as Kotuko and the girl worked together, pulling the sled towards the Polar Sea. Kotuko believed the stone spirit directed him north, following the stars known as the Great Bear. Despite the harsh conditions, they maneuvered expertly through the treacherous ice, facing challenges with skill. The girl remained silent, her face hidden under her fur hood, while the sky above glowed with stars and the Northern Lights. Kotuko, though exhausted, pressed on, claiming his spirit guide watched over them. As they sought shelter from an approaching storm, they glimpsed a mysterious figure in the distance, heightening their sense of unease.

In the story, Kotuko and the girl knelt on the ice, watching a thin whalebone quiver like a compass needle. They heard strange sounds under their feet, like a puppy's squeak or a stone grinding. The ice was under threat from the gale that had driven deep water and rough pack-ice toward them, creating a dangerous situation. As they listened, the ice began to crack and split, with massive ice pans colliding and shattering. The sea was hurling icebergs at the floe, causing chaos and destruction. The two faced the uncertainty of the ice breaking up, with spirits and wild beings lurking in the tumult.

"The girl shouted, ""Follow THAT!"" and pointed to the limping Thing ahead. They hurried after it, pulling the hand-sleigh, as the ice roared closer. The ice cracked and split around them as they reached a mound of ice-blocks. Kotuko dragged the girl to the bottom of the mound. The ice roared louder, but the mound stood firm. Kotuko made a sign for land, revealing the islet they were on. They built a snow-house and ate while the ice hammered along the beach. Two dogs, yellow and black, crept into the hut, now sober and well-fed. Kotuko freed them, and they playfully fought. The sound of the surf signaled the arrival of spring.

Kotuko discovered the dogs fighting over a freshly caught seal, following the fish disturbed by the storm. This was the first of many seals landing on the island that day. Until the sea froze, hundreds of seals enjoyed the shallow waters. Eating seal liver was a treat, and filling the lamps with blubber made the flame dance high. As soon as the sea-ice was strong enough, Kotuko and the girl loaded a hand-sleigh, urging the dogs to pull with urgency back to their village. They left seal carcasses buried in the ice and hurried home. The dogs guided them to Kadlu’s house, where only a few dogs remained, the others having been eaten. The village gathered for a meal, and Kotuko recounted their journey. Plans were made to hunt more seals. Kadlu decided to build a house for the girl from the North, and the angekok claimed credit for guiding their success through magic.

After the Jungle was opened, Mowgli's life took a turn for the better. He felt a sense of peace from repaying his debts, making the whole Jungle his ally, albeit slightly wary of him. The adventures he had while exploring the different parts of the Jungle with or without his companions could fill countless stories. From facing the Mad Elephant of Mandla to battling Jacala, the Crocodile, and encountering the Great Famine, each tale is as captivating as the last. Despite the passing of Father and Mother Wolf and the aging of Baloo and Bagheera, Mowgli's bond with the young wolves of the disbanded Seeonee Pack remained strong. As Phao rose to lead the Pack, Mowgli, out of curiosity, attended the Council Rock meetings, reminiscing about the past.

In the jungle, Mowgli and the Pack heard the rushing river and the wind in the trees until a lone wolf called out across the water. It was no ordinary wolf but a tired and wounded one, warning of the dhole, the red hunting-dog of the Dekkan, moving to kill. The wolf, Won-tolla, shared his story of loss and the danger the dholes posed. The Pack knew the dholes were powerful and numerous, hunting in a relentless pack. Mowgli, who had encountered the dholes before, despised them for their differences from the Free People. Akela, the wise leader, understood the threat and the importance of unity in facing the dholes. As the dholes approached, he prepared the Pack for a fierce battle, knowing it might be his last. He advised Mowgli to seek safety and await news of the outcome.|['1.

Mowgli, a young boy raised by wolves, passionately declares his loyalty to his pack against the dhole, fierce red dogs threatening their territory. He vows to protect his pack with his knife, symbolizing unity. Won-tolla, injured by the dhole, advises the pack to retreat north to safety. Mowgli, with humor, suggests hunting lizards and rats until the dhole leave. The pack, led by Mowgli, agrees to confront the dhole. Mowgli instructs four members to prepare for battle while he checks on the dogs. Excitedly, he stumbles over Kaa, a wise python.

Kaa, the wise python, gently inquired about the trail's destination. He recounted a recent incident where a disrespectful human threw stones at him, prompting Mowgli to share how the man disrupted his hunting. Despite the man's deceitful flattery, Kaa provided Mowgli a comfortable resting spot. As they conversed, Mowgli revealed his inner conflict of being a man yet feeling like a wolf. The duo embarked on a journey, with Mowgli nestled securely on Kaa's back as they navigated the river. Approaching a gorge, they sensed the presence of the Little People of the Rocks, the wild bees. Mowgli respected their territory, understanding the bees' significance in the jungle.

"Kaa swiftly moved upstream and secured himself in the middle of the canyon, gazing up at the cliff's edge. Soon, he noticed Mowgli's head shifting against the stars. A moment later, there was a swift sound in the air, the sharp, clean noise of a body descending feet first. In no time, the boy rested within the coil of Kaa's body. ""It's not a challenging leap at night,"" Mowgli remarked calmly. ""I've leaped twice as far for fun. But above is a dangerous place—low shrubs and deep gullies teeming with the Little People.

The wolves gave a deep howl and began running after Mowgli, who knew he had to keep them hot on his trail to prevent them from turning back too soon. Mowgli ran swiftly, with the tailless leader close behind, and the rest of the pack crazed with the rage of slaughter trailing behind. As Mowgli approached the Bee Rocks, he heard a humming sound and ran faster than ever, leaping over piles of stones and finally jumping into the safety of the river, escaping the dholes. The dholes fell into the river, some getting trapped in underground caves, while others were stung by bees and flung into the water.

Mowgli responded when asked about the dead, saying he had filled the dogs' mouths with dirt and tricked them in broad daylight. He still had a few left to deal with. The wolves realized they should have landed higher up and attacked on dry ground. It was too late now. The riverbank was filled with glowing eyes, and all was silent in the Jungle except for a continuous eerie sound. The dholes rushed ashore, fighting the wolves. Mowgli joined the battle, fighting fiercely with his knife. The fight raged on, with wolves protecting their pack and lahinis fiercely defending their young.

The call echoes through the Jungle - Man seeks Man! Our once Brother departs. Listen, O People of the Jungle, and decide - Who can halt his path, who can sway? Man ventures into the Jungle, shedding tears. Our Brother grieves deeply. Man walks the Man-Trail, away from our reach. Two years after the fierce battle with Red Dog and Akela's passing, Mowgli nears seventeen. He appears older, his body robust from exercise, nourishment, and frequent baths. His strength surpasses his years. The Jungle Folk now fear his might, yet his gaze remains gentle. Bagheera, puzzled by Mowgli's demeanor, remarks on his silent eyes.

Running through the Jungle, Mowgli felt joyous until the scent of flowers signaled the marshes ahead. With agile feet navigating the tussocks, he reached the swamp where the Bird People were active.
