On a calm bank near a still pond, two frogs chatted under the shade of tall reeds. The older, a wise female, scolded her son for chasing a mouse. She reminded him of his noble frog heritage and warned him of danger. The young frog, feeling insulted, stormed off. Along the way, he met a rat, and they shared a friendly chat. The rat invited them for a song, but the frog declined due to a sore throat. The mouse sang beautifully, and they all had a pleasant time. However, their joy was interrupted by a cat and her kittens. In fear, the frog regretted leaving home and hurried back, vowing never to wander again.|"['1.
