Edgewood settled down for the night, unaware of the impending danger. While their sturdy bridge held firm, other villages faced a crisis as the ice jam broke free, threatening to wreak havoc downstream. The villagers sprang into action, clearing out stores and mills in the path of the ice avalanche. Stephen and Rufus joined the frantic efforts to save their community's property. Meanwhile, Rose and her friends, shivering with fear and excitement, watched the icy spectacle unfold. As the jam surged towards the falls, the girls braced for impact, but the ice miraculously shifted course, sparing the buildings. The relentless ice flow surged on, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. This unforgettable night marked a turning point for Stephen, not only due to the ice disaster but also because of his growing concerns about Rose's interactions with Claude Merrill.

Stephen did not return to the River Farm until 1 a.m. that night; he was captivated by the pink bedroom. It resembled the Garden of Eden, albeit smaller. The room had a bright rose pattern on a trellis that outshone any flower bed in June. Stephen admired the room's beauty, thinking it was the only place pretty enough for someone special. He pondered the idea of proposing earlier than planned, imagining her as part of the garden. As Stephen cherished this thought, a serpent arrived in Edgewood, coincidentally, on his fourth visit. The serpent, a former employee, explained his presence due to reorganization at his former workplace. Meanwhile, Claude Merrill, a glove salesman from Boston, visited Edgewood, exuding a sense of sophistication that captivated the locals, including Rose Wiley.

"Rose had been relieved to escape Edgewood and its recent troubles by coming to Boston. Back in Edgewood, her popularity had waned, and even her friends seemed to sympathize more with Stephen.

On top of this, her grandmother's harsh words constantly tormented her.

An opportunity for respite arose when Mrs. Wealthy Brooks fell ill and needed a companion for her treatments in Boston. Rose, eager for a change of scenery, readily accepted the role.
