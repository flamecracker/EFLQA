After our troop meeting, we decided to write up our adventures. One of the older boys suggested that the author of Tom Slade might add some fancy touches to our stories. He assured us that describing nature like breezes, distant views, and storms would be easy once we got used to it. However, he joked that managing girls would be the real challenge. We planned to start writing about our trip once we reached camp, but we were troubled by how we would all travel together in our boat without getting separated. The next day, we set out and collected over five hundred books for the camp. Each patrol used different vehicles, and the Silver Fox Patrol, to which I belong, took care of our town by using a car provided by Brick Warner's father.|"['1.

"One exciting day, our scout patrol gathered over two hundred books of all kinds. We had light literature, dark literature, and books of all colors. Despite a mishap grazing a telegraph pole, we were undeterred. Let me introduce you to the scouts in my patrol. As their leader, I have seven scouts to look after, along with our mascot, Captain Kidd the parrot, who has a merit badge for music. Our patrol color is green, just like Captain Kidd. Among my scouts are Westy Martin, Dorry Benton, Huntley Manners, Sleuth Seabury, Will Dawson, Brick Warner, and Slick Warner. 

Now, let's talk about the raving Ravens. They had an adventure in Little Valley, facing motor trouble and Pee-wee's wild antics. Despite the challenges, they returned with a trove of books. When we gathered in the troop room to sort the books, Pee-wee shared a heartwarming story about his visit to a kind old gentleman's house.

Pee-wee shared a story with us about a kind old man living in a big white house with a flagpole in the lawn. The man, who didn't speak English well, gave Pee-wee some books. While looking through one, a note about a German spy was found. Mr. Ellsworth, alerted about the note, suspected the old man might be a spy. They decided to inform the authorities. Pee-wee was nervous but excited about the discovery. Later, officials arrived, and Pee-wee was asked to identify the man. Although the idea of catching a spy seemed thrilling in stories, in reality, it felt uncomfortable and strange. It made me realize that being a hero isn't always easy, especially when it involves serious matters like spying.|"['1.

"Soon we arrived at Little Valley, where Pee-wee pointed to a grand white house with a fluttering flag. I longed to be at Temple Camp, hoisting our flags by the boat dock. As we walked up the gravel path, an elderly man emerged on the porch, gazing at us. Pee-wee and I felt a bit uneasy. The man waved at Pee-wee, who seemed taken aback. The detectives then showed the man a paper, sparking a range of emotions from him. Initially flustered, he eventually burst into laughter, confessing to writing a memo and having a wireless. Inside, the man revealed he was a renowned author researching German espionage. The detectives, amused by the misunderstanding, praised us for our keen observation.

Pee-wee and I had a debate about whether things get thicker or thinner when stirred. I assured him that things would get exciting in this chapter. He likened it to stirring, saying things get thicker. I shrugged it off. Soon after, the men left, in good spirits. They commended the Boy Scouts as alert. Mr. Donnelle, who had a wireless, found us interesting. He chuckled at Pee-wee's enthusiastic Scout tales. We shared our dilemma of fitting all 24 boys on our small launch to Temple Camp. Mr. Donnelle proposed a plan to aid us and continue his German propaganda work once we were away at camp. As we strolled through the woods on his property, a serene creek captivated us.

"Here is a simplified version of the passage for middle school students:

This is where the story starts to get interesting. We were about to board a house-boat when a person with shabby clothes and a cap dashed out and ran away. He seemed surprised to see us. He quickly disappeared into the woods, causing the boat to rock. Even though the encounter was brief, I observed details about him. Little did we know that this stranger would cause us trouble later on. We didn't pay much attention to him, but my friend Pee-wee seemed disappointed that it wasn't a more exciting encounter. This chapter is about our stay on the house-boat, which became our temporary home. Despite its worn appearance, we had fun exploring it. The boat had two rooms, a kitchen, and a deck.

One day, while exploring near the Bridgeboro River, our Scout troop stumbled upon an abandoned houseboat. It seemed like someone had stayed there briefly. Excited about the discovery, we learned that the creek where the boat originated was known as Dutch Creek. With Mr. Donnelle's help, we devised a plan to float the houseboat down to Bridgeboro River during high tide. To gather our troop for this exciting project, I sent out birch bark calls for a Special Meeting without the scoutmaster. We decided to hike to Little Valley to prepare the houseboat together. Along the way, we encountered a scout mark on a rock indicating water nearby. Our adventure was just beginning as we embarked on this thrilling journey to restore the houseboat.|['1.

I didn’t know any scouts around our area who could be camping there, but when a scout sees a scout sign, they usually like to follow it. So I told my friends I would follow if there was time. They said it was an old mark from last year, but I could go ahead if I wanted to. So, off I went into the woods, like on the map I made. It wasn’t much of a trail, and it got swampy quickly. I don’t like marshes; they’re easy to get lost in. Soon, I was deep in the marsh, and it was scary. I tried lying flat on the marsh, but it didn’t help. I felt stuck and scared.

The tall weeds surrounded me, blocking my view like I was buried alive, with only my head peeking out. I wished I was with my friends at Little Valley starting work on the house-boat. I wondered who the Silver Foxes would choose as their patrol leader. I realized no one, not even my parents, would know what happened to me in this marsh. My legs grew weary from standing in the water-like mush. I thought about leaving a message in my hike-book, which was wet from the marsh. I wrote my name, patrol leader of the Silver Fox Patrol, and where I was. I hoped someone would find it. Suddenly, I spotted a spark plug on a clump of net moss, a strange sight in the woods. It made me think of home in Bridgeboro.|['1.

Once, I found myself in a marsh, feeling like I was drowning slowly. Then, a spark plug caught my eye, and even though it couldn't save me, it made me think of people and lifted my spirits. I remembered what our scoutmaster said about drowning, how you can think when your head is above water. As the tide began to rise, I realized the spark plug was from a broken motorboat. I started laughing, not caring that water flowed into my mouth. I knew the tide would create a creek soon, and I could swim to safety. The rising tide was my rescue; it never goes back on you. So, with a scout smile, I awaited the tide, thankful for its certainty.|"[""**Question 1:**\nWhat caught the speaker's eye in the marsh?\nA) A fish swimming by\nB) A spark plug\nC) A broken motorboat\nD) A lifebuoy\nE) A tree branch"", ""**Question 2:**\nWhat did the spark plug make the speaker think of?\nA) Swimming\nB) Drowning\nC) People\nD) Scoutmaster's advice\nE) Safety"", ""**Question 3:**\nWhat did the speaker remember the scoutmaster saying about drowning?\nA) You can't think when your head is above water\nB) You can think when your head is above water\nC) You can only think when fully submerged\nD) You can't think at all\nE) You shouldn't think about drowning"", '**Question 4:**\nWhat did the rising tide signify for the speaker?\nA) Danger\nB) Uncertainty\nC) Rescue\nD) Fear\nE) Loneliness', '**Question 5:**\nWhat did the speaker realize about the spark plug as the tide rose?\nA) It was useless\nB) It was from a broken motorboat\nC) It was a treasure\nD) It was a life-saving device\nE) It was a toy', '**Question 6:**\nHow did the speaker feel as they awaited the rising tide?\nA) Anxious\nB) Worried\nC) Thankful\nD) Regretful\nE) Sad']"|['B) A spark plug**', 'C) People**', 'B) You can think when your head is above water**', 'C) Rescue**', 'B) It was from a broken motorboat**', 'C) Thankful**']
"Pee-wee wanted to title this chapter ""Saved By A Spark Plug"" or ""The Hero Plug,"" but I thought it sounded silly. However, I won't criticize his ideas anymore. I've often seen motorboats stuck on the flats, and the men aboard blame the tide. Suddenly, a small river appeared, originating from the ocean and winding its way into the marshes. I decided to swim against the tide for safety, fearing the marshes would trap me if I went the other way. I took off my shoes and socks, preparing to swim. Before starting, I dove to investigate what I had been standing on, feeling a hard, pointed object beneath the marshy water. After tugging on it, a black, slimy object emerged, covered in moss. It was a mysterious and exciting find, and I couldn't wait to explore further."|"['1.

One day, while exploring the waters, I stumbled upon a mysterious object that turned out to be an ancient Indian dug-out canoe. It was about fifteen feet long and made of cedar, which explained its enduring quality. Excitedly, I cleaned it off and attempted to paddle it. The canoe was quite unstable, and I had to bail out water multiple times. Eventually, I managed to navigate it into the marshes. I fashioned a makeshift paddle from reeds and awaited the flood tide to carry me back. As I sat in the dug-out, waiting for the tide, I pondered the canoe's history and imagined the adventures of its original owner. Little did I know that my journey was far from over, and a surprise awaited me as the tide began to turn.|['1.

After the tide changed, I paddled downstream in my makeshift log boat, trying to keep upright despite the cracks leaking a bit of water. Balancing was tough, like sitting up straight in school, even when the principal came by. Steering with reeds made me look funny. Suddenly, I heard my friends teasing me about the hole in the boat. Approaching Dutch Creek near Little Valley, I saw my friends working on a boat. Excited, I paddled closer, and they noticed me. This part is mostly about Wig-Wag Weigand, a skilled scout known for signaling. Though he's a Raven, not a Silver Fox, he's a good friend who shares cookies on hikes. I learned a lesson about leaving unnecessary signs from Tom Slade. Forgetting to remove a note I left behind almost caused trouble.|['1.

The troop had a productive day fixing up the boat by caulking the hull and painting it while the tide was low. They decided to let the boat float down the river with the outgoing tide to Bridgeboro River. Then they planned to wait for the incoming tide to carry it back upstream to Bridgeboro. The chapter emphasizes the importance of the tide in their adventure. The troop jokingly named the boat _Weetonka_ after a famous Indian chief. However, a mistake led them to get stuck on the flats instead of anchoring in the channel. Despite the mishap, they remained optimistic about floating off with the changing tide. This humorous and eventful journey showcases the importance of being mindful of nature's elements like the tide.|"['1.

"Well, I guess he was correct except for what happened shortly after. We settled down to wait for the tide to recede and change. Eventually, we noticed the flats surrounding us, with no water nearby except in the distant channel near the west shore. Stranded and unable to escape due to the mud, we pondered how long before the water would rise again. Suddenly, Doc Carson alerted us to the sound of a motorboat in the distance.

When I arrived at his small cabin, I noticed it was locked, and he was nowhere to be found. It seemed he had gone crabbing down the bay. Hurriedly, I dashed to Marshtown landing to check if he had departed, but his boat was not there. Disappointment filled me. Despite this, I scouted the area, searching for signs of his return from maybe just a quick trip for gasoline. Alas, no clues emerged, and he did not reappear. As a scout, I continued my search and stumbled upon a peculiar footprint in the soft earth near the dock. It was distinct, with a worn-out shoe and a faded Indian's head imprint.

I decided it'd be better to have a buddy with me, especially for tracking. Two heads are better than one, and this guy was a tracking pro. He had even won the pathfinder's badge at Temple Camp. I knew the guys would be at the boat club by nine, so I had to tell them about a footprint. They'd understand, scouts usually do. As I walked to the club, I heard them working hard on the houseboat. Mr. Ellsworth, our scoutmaster, was there too. He's strict about time, but he took a day off to help. I started painting with my patrol, waiting for Westy. When he didn't show, I called his mom.

Ralph Warner, who was in my usual seat, asked me coldly if I wanted to sit there. I replied, asserting my role as the patrol leader and took my seat beside the Silver Fox emblem. Maybe they were thinking of electing a new leader, but that didn't bother me. Mr. Ellsworth then called the roll, marking Westy and me as late. He announced that the meeting was to draft a thank-you letter to Mr. Donnelle for lending us the boat and to decide on the expenses for our trip. Mr. Ellsworth then addressed Westy, reprimanding him for skipping troop duties to play baseball. The troop was asked to elect a new patrol leader.

"When you have a chance, Wesleigh, I want you to review the scout laws again.

"""I wanted to share something with you all,"" I began, my voice filled with excitement. ""This morning, Westy was supposed to help on the house-boat, but he met Skinny McCord's mother on the way. She told him about Skinny falling sick after helping me by keeping Jake Holden away from my house. She asked Westy to stay with Skinny, and he didn't think twice about it. I'm glad he did that instead of going to the house-boat. I'm still his patrol leader, and I'm proud of him. Westy even took his baseball and catching mitt, which cost him a lot, to cheer Skinny up. The doctor says Skinny might not make it, but Westy stayed with him all day. He's a true friend. And I'm happy you're electing a new leader because I would never reprimand Westy for his kindness. I followed Skinny's trail, which led me to his house in Barrel Alley. I'm a scout, and I followed the pathfinder sign he left for me. It guided me to a sick friend, where I stayed to help, forgetting about the house-boat. I hope the new leader will send Skinny to the country.

I shared my idea with them, and it sparked many adventures. That's the beauty of kindness; it sets things in motion. Pee-wee was already inspired. Instead of keeping Tom Slade's place open in his memory, I suggested putting Skinny McCord there and taking him to Temple Camp to help him recover. Skinny was enthusiastic about scouting but felt intimidated due to his poverty. I explained that Skinny belonged to the Silver Foxes, and they should gift him to the Elks in honor of Tom Slade. Mr. Ellsworth and Councilman Bennett praised our plan. Mr. Bennett offered to provide Skinny with the necessary gear for the camp trip, emphasizing the importance of the Silver Foxes' support. We teased Mr. Bennett good-naturedly, and I even recited a bit of poetry for fun.|"[""1.

Mr. Ellsworth, our dedicated scoutmaster, took charge when Skinny fell ill. He emphasized that a scout's worth isn't in the outfit but in their character. After visiting Skinny and his family, Mr. Ellsworth ensured Skinny's well-being. Despite Skinny's illness, Mr. Ellsworth remained optimistic about his scouting journey. With Westy and others, we organized a surprise for Skinny. Although Pee-wee pointed out a missing belt-axe, the gesture was heartfelt. Our troop's unity and Mr. Ellsworth's guidance make us proud scouts.

"""I think Skinny would look really cool walking down Main Street with a belt-axe and no uniform,"" I mentioned. ""You're obsessed with belt-axes. Are you worried about an invasion by Hindenburg in Bridgeboro? You shouldn't stress about a belt-axe. Let him become a tenderfoot first.""

""It's the symbol of the woods!"" he shouted loudly. ""You must have a belt-axe first. It's more crucial than the Handbook. It signifies woodcraft and all that stuff!""

At first, I just chuckled and teased him because I know how passionate he is about these things. He'd proudly wear every badge from the Handbook if he could. Pee-wee is fine, but he's fixated on all the scout gear you see in pictures. He always has his belt-axe dangling, as if he's ready to chop down all the telegraph poles on Main Street.

""Sure he would,"" I replied, understanding Mr. Ellsworth's perspective. Maybe he didn't want Skinny to have everything at once, so he could earn some things on his own later. Mr. Ellsworth believes in that approach.

We often teased Pee-wee about his belt-axe and wearing his scout-knife and cup on his belt, even at home. Mr. Ellsworth always called him a 'typical scout.'

"After I showed Skinny the picture, I closed the Handbook since I wouldn't need it anymore. I quickly placed the two-dollar bill on the table so I could straighten Skinny's belt and fix his collar to make him look his best. I used an oar-lock to secure the bill from blowing away, ones my patrol gave me on troop birthday. ""Forget it,"" I reassured him. ""The scout smile is what matters most.

The first evening we had the house-boat, Mr. Ellsworth visited Mr. Darren, the superintendent of Northside Woods, to request permission to cut down saplings for the boat. The purpose was to create stanchions for the awning, a flagpole, and bumper sticks. Mr. Darren agreed as lumber was expensive due to the construction of tall houses. Marked saplings were selected for the task. The following day, we trekked to Northside Woods, crossing a bridge and heading towards Little Valley. The hike was enjoyable, with various groups joining us, including the Ravens and Elks. Skinny, proudly displaying a new camp axe, joined in enthusiastically. Despite his thin frame, he worked diligently, showing a keen interest in cutting the saplings.

Soon, I started to worry about Westy. He always gets delayed, and I hoped he wouldn't do any more good deeds until we finished our work. If he fell from a tall building, he'd still help someone on the way down. Then, I heard him sprinting through the woods, making us all stop and laugh. Except for Skinny, who kept working. Things got chaotic when Westy fell into a ditch because the boards that bridged it were missing. Doc checked on him, and we needed a doctor. Westy had a cut from his keys in his pocket.

No one seemed to notice me as I climbed out of the ditch and slipped away behind a tree to examine the crumpled two-dollar bill. The shape of the stain on it resembled the curve of an oar-lock, round and open at the top. I could have covered the mark with one of my oar-locks. But truth be told, I wasn't particularly thrilled about retrieving the bill. A two-dollar bill paled in comparison to a friend like Westy. I wasn't concerned about the money; I could easily get another bill, and Monday was just around the corner. My mind was consumed with thoughts of Westy, my special friend. I felt lost and conflicted, unsure of what to do next. The idea of confiding in Ruth or Marjorie crossed my mind, as girls often seem to understand troubles better. I contemplated returning the bill to Westy as a silent reminder, hoping he would eventually return it when he was able.

I went over to Skinny as the others left the ditch, praising him for his bravery. With Westy injured, I felt compelled to say something to him, but his eyes were shut. I slipped two dollars into his pocket, a small gesture. Later, I helped Westy to the doctor's car. As I walked back to get Skinny's axe, I found solace in the woods. I thought about Skinny to avoid dwelling on Westy's condition. Skinny was different, almost inspiring, with his wild eyes and unique way of speaking. I returned home, reflecting on my friendship with Jim Hawkins from a book, finding comfort in the darkness of the woods for contemplation.|"['1.

"Mostly in the evening, I usually sit with my parents on the porch, but that night I decided to go to my tent. I lit a lantern and sat inside. I enjoy using a lantern because it reminds me of camping trips. Jeb Rushmore, a fellow camper, dislikes electric lights at Temple Camp. He also has a dislike for umbrellas. However, I have a wire running from our garage to my tent, Camp Solitaire, with a bulb for reading. Jerry mentioned I should pay for using the garage's electricity. I started reading ""Treasure Island"" again, skipping parts I recently read. As I read about the ship journey, I noticed a stain on the page. I realized I had damaged the book previously. I felt guilty because damaging library books is not allowed. I decided to buy a new book to replace it. Hearing my dog bark, I knew Westy, a friend, was approaching.

I didn’t know what to say to him. I thought he might apologize for the mishap with the two dollars and explain he was in a rush or not thinking clearly. Any explanation would have sufficed as long as he was honest, like he was in the ditch. Maybe things would be okay eventually. But I couldn’t fathom how he could be so cheerful after what happened. “You shouldn’t worry about me,” he said. “I just have a slight limp. I’m a cool Silver Fox, right?” Then he playfully messed up my hair and joked about his “honorable wounds.” He revealed that the mishap with the money occurred because of a page in the copy of _Treasure Island_ he had borrowed from the library. He proceeded to demonstrate how the mishap actually happened, showing his clever problem-solving skills.|"[""1.

I will never trust a gentle breeze again. In books, they talk about gentle breezes being nice, but I say watch out for them. When I leave my bathing suit to dry, I put a big rock on it. I trust my friends Skinny and Westy, but not those sneaky breezes. The next day, we went back to Northside Woods to tie up saplings and drag them to the river. We planned to use a rowboat to float them down. Most of the guys were there except Skinny, who was home sick. We hauled everything to the river, ready to take it to the houseboat. We towed the saplings downstream, fighting the tide. After finishing, the guys walked home, leaving only Westy, Pee-wee, and me to row the boat. We talked about engines and tides, things city folks might not understand. As we approached the bridge, we saw a tugboat making a racket.|['1.

As we passed under the bridge, a large man in the pilot house frantically pulled the whistle rope to signal the bridge to open. He shouted, demanding to know the whereabouts of the bridgeman. Frustrated, he worried about the receding tide and his tight schedule. Despite his efforts, no one seemed to respond to his urgent calls. Worried about the consequences of a delay, he continued to pull the whistle cord faster and faster. Upon reaching Jimmy's shanty, the boys found the place in disarray, with signs of a hurried search. Concerned for Jimmy's well-being, they cautiously ventured inside, only to find his room empty and disturbed. The eerie silence and the ticking clock added to the suspense, leaving them on edge about what they might discover beyond the closed door.|"['1.

"In the room, there was a table where Jimmy usually ate, with a big piece of paper and an envelope. But Jimmy was nowhere to be found. Westy read out loud about a Grand Army convention addressed to ""Comrade James Van Dorian."" I felt sorry for Jimmy, imagining him rushing to get there. We searched but couldn't find the key-bar to open the bridge. I asked to speak to the old man on the tug-boat. Inside, everything was polished and shiny.

One day, a boy offered to dive into the river to retrieve a key-bar that had fallen in. He needed some rope to tie to the key-bar so it could be hauled up. The boy knew exactly where the key-bar was located under the bridge. With a rope tied around his waist, he dived into the water and after a few attempts, he successfully retrieved the key-bar. Excited, he was about to leave when Captain Savage called him aboard a tugboat to help navigate the channel to North Bridgeboro. It was the boy's first time on a tugboat, and he enjoyed the experience, learning about the channel along the way. Captain Savage praised the boy for his obedience and assistance, making the journey memorable.|"['1.

One day, I had a chat with Captain Savage on his tugboat. He was curious about the scouts, how they organized into troops and patrols. We chatted about our vacation and Temple Camp, especially the houseboat. I asked if a three-horsepower engine could move the houseboat up the Hudson to Catskill Landing. He pondered, puffing on his pipe, steering. He joked about our river's size, calling it a stream and teasing about the tide. When we reached North Bridgeboro, he started downstream with the barge. He was intrigued by the scouts and Skinny. As we neared the bridge, I assured him we meant no harm and would follow his lead. He mentioned a trip to Poughkeepsie and a decision deadline. The bridge opened for us, and Captain Savage continued, leaving us behind, not even acknowledging the scouts.|['1.
