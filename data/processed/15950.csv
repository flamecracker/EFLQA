"The sketches in this collection, much like ""Ways of Wood Folk,"" stem from years of firsthand observation in natural settings. They focus on animals in their pure form, devoid of human attributes. Animals are captivating just as they are, without needing human-like characteristics. Most wild creatures possess limited gentleness, often driven by instinct and seasonal factors. The author presents both sides of these creatures, showcasing their savagery alongside their gentleness. While it might be tempting to idealize animals, the truth is essential for understanding their nature. Mothers in the wild can display fierce protectiveness but may also exhibit indifference once their offspring are independent. Male animals, such as father foxes and wolves, typically show little devotion to their families, living self-centered lives. It's crucial to recognize the realities of animal behavior, including their instinctual actions like driving away weak or burdensome members. Sympathy must be genuine and based on a wise discernment of good and evil in nature, rather than on false ideals. The story of Kagax the Weasel serves to reveal the true nature of certain animals and challenge sentimental perceptions."|"[""1.

A caribou emerged from the woods onto a grassy point above, wandering all over, leaving it looking as if a herd had passed. She sipped water by a rock, crossed to my side, then to the end and back, taking sips along the way. After nibbling grass, she waded far out to sip, then returned. This wandering creature, like the coast's plover, circles without a clear purpose. Following herds in winter reveals the same unsatisfied wandering. Even in feeding, they dig through snow for food, then move on to the next barren. The caribou's restlessness stems from ancestral migrations they no longer follow, leaving them wandering without satisfaction. Nature provides means for their wandering, like paths in the snow made by moose and deer to feed on twigs and bark, ensuring their survival in harsh winters.|"['Question 1:\nWhat does the caribou do after sipping water by a rock?\nA) Nibble grass\nB) Wade far out to sip\nC) Cross to the other side\nD) Rest by the rock\nE) Follow the herd', ""Question 2:\nWhat is compared to the caribou's wandering behavior in the text?\nA) A sprinting cheetah\nB) A soaring eagle\nC) A swimming dolphin\nD) A flying bat\nE) A coast's plover"", 'Question 3:\nWhy do caribou dig through snow for food in winter?\nA) To build a shelter\nB) To find water\nC) To create paths\nD) To escape predators\nE) To find food', ""Question 4:\nWhat is the main reason for the caribou's restlessness according to the text?\nA) Lack of water sources\nB) Lack of shelter\nC) Disrupted ancestral migrations\nD) Overpopulation\nE) Harsh winter conditions"", 'Question 5:\nHow do moose and deer contribute to the survival of caribou in harsh winters?\nA) By providing shelter\nB) By creating paths in the snow\nC) By hunting for caribou\nD) By competing for food\nE) By migrating together', ""Question 6:\nWhat does the text suggest about the caribou's satisfaction with their wandering behavior?\nA) They are content and fulfilled\nB) They are lost and confused\nC) They are constantly searching\nD) They are following clear paths\nE) They are stationary and settled""]"|"['A) Nibble grass', ""E) A coast's plover"", 'E) To find food', 'C) Disrupted ancestral migrations', 'B) By creating paths in the snow', 'C) They are constantly searching']"
Megaleep the Wanderer relies solely on nature to survive. In the summer, he blends into his surroundings with his brown color and expands the frog of his foot to cling to mountains or move silently. In winter, he turns soft gray to disappear into snowstorms or barren landscapes. His hooves adapt, growing sharp to cut through ice and dig for moss. Despite his wandering nature, Megaleep sometimes overestimates his abilities, leading to challenging situations. Once, he and his herd found themselves stuck in deep snow, exhausted and hungry. Though initially frightened, they showed curiosity and trust towards the observer, even accepting food. Eventually, they found their way to safety, highlighting their resilience in the face of adversity. Megaleep's elusive nature in storms makes him seem like a ghost, blending seamlessly with the snow and trees. His ability to vanish and reappear adds to his mystique, making him a fascinating creature to encounter in the wilderness.|"[""1.

During a snowy day in the woods, a hunter followed a herd of caribou, but they were extremely cautious and watchful. The caribou seemed reluctant to leave a safe area, possibly sensing an incoming storm. The hunter, realizing the storm was approaching, hurried back towards camp but got caught in the snowfall. Despite the blizzard, he stumbled upon the caribou trail again and decided to follow them. Singing a nursery rhyme to keep his spirits up, he suddenly encountered the caribou up close. Surprisingly, the caribou, feeling protected by the storm, didn't show any fear or aggression towards the hunter, as they believed the snow would hide their tracks and scent from predators. The storm acted as a natural shield for the caribou, creating a temporary truce among all animals in the woods.|['1.

One of the most fascinating encounters I had was with a caribou school, which might sound strange but is quite common in the wild. Just like us, gregarious animals like caribou have their own social rules that the young must learn and follow. These woodland caribou, larger and more majestic than their barren-ground relatives, have their own unique ways of teaching the young. In summer, they live independently, each doing as they please. But as winter approaches, they gather in herds on treeless plains, where the young must learn to abide by the herd's laws for survival. I once observed a group of mother caribou and their calves in a natural clearing, their schoolroom in the heart of the swamp, where the young ones timidly interacted, learning to navigate their social world under the watchful eyes of their mothers.|"['1.

For an hour, I observed a group of caribou in the woods. Most of their actions puzzled me until they started a lesson on jumping. Caribou aren't natural jumpers due to their habitat on northern lands without obstacles. Moving south, they encountered fallen trees, necessitating jumping. The adult caribou effortlessly leaped over, but the calves struggled. The mothers patiently guided them, teaching not just jumping but also following a leader. Some calves hesitated, needing a nudge to jump. Suddenly, a mother sensed danger and swiftly led the group away, leaving the lesson unfinished. The forest fell silent, emphasizing the importance of alertness in the wild.|['1.

In the animal kingdom, the caribou exhibits a unique behavior when they reach old age or fall sick. Instead of staying with the herd, they journey to a secluded spot deep in the woods known as the caribou burying ground. This mysterious place, like the one found in a tamarack swamp in New Brunswick, serves as the final resting place for these majestic creatures. Interestingly, other animals from the same district or herd also make their way to this sacred ground when they are ailing. This ritual of solitude and transitioning from life to death is a profound aspect of nature that remains a mystery. The caribou's instinct to seek out this specific location as their final destination raises questions about their deep connection to the herd and the unknown forces that guide them in their last moments.|"['1.

The day was cold, the woods were wet, and the weather was unpleasant when Killooleet first sang on my tent. We had journeyed upriver to a quiet camping spot to escape signs of civilization. The rain continued as we landed by the old cedar. We built a fire to dry boughs for sleeping and set up our shelters. Killooleet's cheerful song welcomed us to the wilderness. Simmo and I enjoyed visits from a colony of white-throated sparrows, who shared our food and company. These birds sang throughout the day and night, bringing joy to our secluded spot. I often listened to them practice their songs, learning about their unique melodies and cheerful nature. Living among them with the peaceful surroundings was truly special.|['1.

One day, while quietly observing a wood mouse in the bushes, a male bird named Killooleet, known for his beautiful singing, perched nearby and sang a melodious tune. I noticed a unique trill at the end of his second note, a challenging part of his song. This tiny yodel was his signature, and he always made sure to get it right before continuing. Killooleet's song was a delight to hear up close, but from a distance, it sounded like a faint cluck. Among many Killooleets, one stood out for his friendly nature and fearless demeanor. He even visited during meals, picking his favorite bits and sharing with his mate who was initially shy but eventually joined in. Killooleet's cheerful song welcomed me each morning and upon returning from my adventures, making my time in the woods all the more special.|"['1.

One day, as I prepared my breakfast at the campsite, a little gray bird cautiously approached, followed by five tiny Killooleets. They were all eager for food but also wary of the big world around them. Despite their fear, they were in a rush for the crackers and porridge I offered. Soon, my breakfast gatherings grew from two to seven lively guests. The cheerful sounds of their beaks tapping on the tin plate filled the air as I enjoyed my meal. The picturesque scene of the lake, the canoe, and the bobbing heads of the birds around me was a delightful sight. However, the most delightful moment came when the Killooleets discovered the cracker box and helped themselves to a snack in my absence. Their joyful munching created a merry tune that echoed through the camp, making it a memorable summer experience.|"['1.

The assurance that they could do as they pleased and help themselves without any disturbance seemed to completely remove any doubts from the mind of the little gray mate. After that, they mostly stayed close around my tent, never straying too far or being too preoccupied with hunting insects that they wouldn't come when I whistled and scattered crumbs. The little Killooleets grew rapidly, always hungry and constantly eating. I made sure to give them less than they wanted, so I could feed them often and find their tin plate empty whenever I returned from fishing. When we finally paddled away, did the woods feel lonely to Killooleet? That's a question I would pay a lot to answer. Leaving a good camping spot always brings some regret, but I had never packed up so reluctantly before. Killooleet was singing cheerfully, but my heart added a touch of sadness to his song that wasn't there when he sang on my tent. Before leaving, I baked a large loaf, secured it under an old cedar with a tin plate underneath and a bark roof above. A year later, when my canoe touched the same spot, I found the bread gone, the tin plate crushed by snow, and the stakes still there. When I put out crumbs, Killooleet appeared, taking the biggest one just like before, flying back to his nest by the deer path.|['1.

As Kagax moved through the forest, a sudden commotion caught his attention. Meeko, the red squirrel, had stumbled upon a jay's nest, causing a stir with his antics.

The chase ensued, with Meeko leaping from branch to branch, desperately trying to escape. Despite the brave efforts of other birds to distract Kagax, he remained focused on his prey, tracking Meeko's scent with deadly precision.

Tookhees, a clever wood mouse, outwitted Kagax, a fierce weasel, by hiding in his tunnel. Kagax, frustrated, sought revenge on other mice. He found a field mouse's nest, killed the mother, and destroyed the young ones. Unsatisfied, he climbed a ridge to hunt pine martens. Despite his fear of them, Kagax attacked the martens' den, killing the young ones. He then continued his hunt, discovering a brooding partridge and ruthlessly killing her and destroying her eggs.

In the forest, Kagax the weasel was on the hunt for a clever hare. The hare, sensing danger, led Kagax on a wild chase through the bushes and swamps. The hare's quick moves kept Kagax on his toes, but the weasel was determined to catch his prey. After a thrilling pursuit, Kagax finally outsmarted the hare, surprising him and satisfying his hunger. As Kagax rested, another predator, a fierce shadow with glowing eyes, passed by the partridge's nest unnoticed. Kagax, awakening from his slumber, continued his hunt, stalking and killing a bullfrog and a family of woodpeckers. Despite missing the logcock, Kagax's relentless pursuit of his prey showcased his cunning and skill in the wilderness.|"['1.

As the night passed, Kagax hunted relentlessly, yet never felt satisfied. He reminisced about the challenging winter when food was scarce, and he snarled at the thought of the plentiful hen coop he once raided. Despite his successful kills, Kagax felt an unsettling heaviness in his feet. He grudgingly acknowledged the need for a day's rest, which filled him with frustration as the wilderness teemed with life. A sense of being hunted crept over him, causing fear to grip his heart. As he pursued a mother hare, a chilling call from Kookooskoos, the great horned owl, froze him in place.

"Once again, a deep _Whooo-hoo-hoo_ echoed over the hillside. To Kagax, who revels in his hunting triumphs but trembles in fear, it sounded like a dreadful accusation. ""Who has killed without need? Who strangled a nesting bird? Who harmed his own kin?"" boomed through the forest. Kagax dashed for his shelter. A loud snap as he stepped on a twig alerted a massive shadow above him. Fierce yellow eyes peered down at Kagax, who tried to hide under a fir branch. Suddenly, sharp claws descended, and Kagax's misdeeds came to a swift end. The shadow, revealed as Kookooskoos, the Great Horned Owl, vanished into the night.

Rats and rabbits are his preferred meals, and he never misses a chance to bring them back to camp to show off his hunting prowess. Once, as I returned home at dusk from a hunt in the vast woods, I heard the gentle sound of deer grazing nearby. I cautiously crept to the thicket's edge and stood still, observing and listening intently. Suddenly, without warning, I felt a sharp blow to my head from behind, as if struck by a thorny stick. Startled, I turned around to find no one there. Confused and a bit scared, I searched for the source of the blow but found nothing. Later, upon inspection, the doctor discovered cuts on my scalp, leading me to recall a childhood memory of an owl that had a habit of swooping down on unsuspecting heads. The next day, I ventured back to the woods, suspecting the owl's involvement in the mysterious incident.|"['1.

At dusk, I spotted an owl perched on top of an old stub. As I watched, he hooted and listened intently. When I pulled on a string, he swooped down to catch a cap, but I moved it just in time. The owl missed twice, then flew towards me before veering off into the shadows. It dawned on me that this owl was the same one that had startled me the night before. Years later, in a lumber camp, I encountered superstitious men who had been spooked by mysterious incidents. I discovered that an owl, Kookooskoos, was behind these occurrences.

One evening while camping in the woods, I decided to show the lumbermen a trick involving a hare's skin and an owl. I hoisted the hare's skin on a stick, and as the fur moved, a giant owl swooped down, grabbed the skin, and flew away. The lumbermen were amazed, with one even dancing in excitement. Later that night, I explained the owl's hunting habits to the group. Owls like Kookooskoos have incredibly sensitive ears that can detect the slightest sounds. Their distinctive hooting is used to scare prey. The owl's hunting prowess was evident in a nest I found high up in a tree, filled with hair and feathers from its meals. Owls like Kookooskoos are skilled hunters, using their keen senses to catch their prey without a sound.|"[""1.

Wanting to confirm the nest was occupied, I retreated to a safe distance and hid. Soon, a large owl returned to the nest, followed by a smaller male bird. As I cautiously approached, both birds startled at a twig snapping. The male bird swiftly departed, while the female bird hid behind a limb, peeking at me. She remained concealed until I was halfway up the tree. Peering into the nest, I found two fuzzy gray heads with hazel eyes and pin-feathers like wise old clerks. They bristled at my presence, revealing their enormous mouths. The nest was surrounded by remnants of a red squirrel, a rat, and more. I left them in peace to watch them grow. Observing the owls' hunting prowess, I noted their preference for game heads and brains. Despite their ferocity, I marveled at the young owls' growth and hooting lessons.|"['1.

In the late afternoon, I returned to the lake to catch some big frogs for breakfast. Chigwooltz, known for his keen sense of hearing, spotted me first and swam towards my canoe. When I teased him with a red ibis fly, he dove underwater, thinking he was hidden, and observed me. Another frog, Chigwooltz the second, with a green stone and a patient demeanor, remained motionless in the sun all day, surprising me with his stillness. As I fished for more frogs, two others appeared. I dangled the red ibis between them, and after a tense moment, they both lunged for it. A fierce fight ensued, with the smaller frog cleverly outmaneuvering and defeating the larger one. Another frog joined in and snatched the fly while the others fought. The scene was brutal and deliberate, showcasing the savage nature of these creatures. The smaller frog even exhibited a unique trick when caught on the fishing line. The next day, Chigwooltz remained unmoved by the same stone, showing incredible patience.

Mooween the bear silently approached, moving like a cat towards Chigwooltz to catch him off guard. With a swift paw, he splashed mud and water towards Chigwooltz, who was quick to dodge and disappear into the water grass. Days later, Simmo and I relocated to a birch grove near the bay where frogs thrived. I observed Chigwooltz, a frog with a diverse diet including insects, fish, and even other frogs. He hunted at night, preying on unsuspecting fish. Watching from afar, I saw his eyes gleam in the twilight as he stealthily approached his prey. Small frogs knew to stay near the lily pads to avoid the hungry trout and cannibalistic frogs. Observing the various frogs in the bay, each had its unique behaviors, from curiosity to cautiousness.

"One morning, as I strolled towards the shore, a tree sparrow landed near me for a drink. Unbeknownst to the bird, a sneaky predator named Chigwooltz lurked beneath the water's surface.

"Weeks before, I had met Old Whitehead, known as Gillie's name for him, on the Madawaska River. As we journeyed upstream towards the wilderness, we were startled by the sound of a gunshot and commotion up ahead. Rounding a bend, we encountered a man with a smoking gun, a boy struggling to cross the river, and a black sheep on the opposite bank bleating frantically. The boy cried out, ""He's taken the lamb!"" Pointing to the sky, I spotted Old Whitehead, a majestic eagle, soaring away with the sheep. Acting swiftly, I grabbed the rifle Gillie handed me and took aim. With a steady shot, I hit Old Whitehead, causing him to falter mid-air. As he turned, we saw the distinctive break in his tail feathers, marking him for us in the future.

Initially, I pursued Cheplahgan like any primitive being; partly to acquire his skin for the museum curator, possibly to safeguard the settler's lambs over at Madawaska, but mainly to end his life, to revel in his final moments, and to free the woods from a brutal ruler. However, a transformation occurred within me as I tracked him; I sought him less for his skin and life and more for himself, to understand him completely. I used to observe him for hours from my camp on the vast lake, watching him sail gracefully over Caribou Point after dining with his offspring, allowing Ismaquehs to fish undisturbed. He would spread his magnificent wings to the wind and hover like a kite, ascending effortlessly in a vast spiral, higher and higher, with no apparent strain, until the heavens seemed closer and the earth wider below. His head and tail would glisten silver-white in the sunlight, disappearing into the vast blue sky, only to reappear hurtling down like a plummet before soaring back up in a grand arc towards the treetops. He exuded strength, freedom, and self-assurance, circling endlessly upwards without haste or strain. I marveled at his grace, his freedom, his self-assuredness. His every turn brought him closer to the heavens and the earth seemed to spread wider below. As he disappeared into the blue abyss, I would catch my breath, only for him to reemerge, hurtling downwards|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was the initial reason the speaker pursued Cheplahgan?\nA) To observe his hunting techniques\nB) To understand his behavior completely\nC) To acquire his skin for the museum curator\nD) To protect the settler's lambs at Madawaska\nE) To study his offspring's dining habits"", ""Question 2:\nWhy did the speaker's motivation change as he tracked Cheplahgan?\nA) To learn how to sail gracefully over Caribou Point\nB) To observe him from the vast lake\nC) To revel in his final moments\nD) To free the woods from a brutal ruler\nE) To understand Cheplahgan completely"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did the speaker observe Cheplahgan doing after dining with his offspring?\nA) Fishing undisturbed\nB) Sailing gracefully over Caribou Point\nC) Hovering like a kite\nD) Ascending effortlessly in a vast spiral\nE) Glistening silver-white in the sunlight', 'Question 4:\nHow did Cheplahgan ascend in the vast spiral?\nA) With apparent strain\nB) With haste and strain\nC) Effortlessly\nD) Slowly and cautiously\nE) Without hovering like a kite', 'Question 5:\nWhat qualities did Cheplahgan exude according to the speaker?\nA) Weakness and fear\nB) Grace, freedom, and self-assurance\nC) Haste and strain\nD) Struggle and confinement\nE) Self-doubt and hesitation', 'Question 6:\nHow did the speaker feel as Cheplahgan disappeared into the blue abyss?\nA) Relieved\nB) Anxious\nC) Excited\nD) Astonished\nE) Indifferent']"|['C) To acquire his skin for the museum curator', 'E) To understand Cheplahgan completely', 'A) Fishing undisturbed', 'C) Effortlessly', 'B) Grace, freedom, and self-assurance', 'D) Astonished']
The next day, I set my plan in motion. I carefully carved a tunnel through the thick bushes near the old log where the majestic eagle perched. Ensuring the foliage concealed me, I strategically placed my bait hours before Old Whitehead's usual appearance time. As I settled into my hiding spot, enduring the discomfort of insects and stifling air, the sound of heavy wings drew near. Old Whitehead landed close by, his imposing presence radiating power. His sharp eyes scanned the surroundings uneasily, his gaze meeting mine with a fierce intensity. In that moment, as I reached out towards him, a flicker of fear softened his glare, recognizing me as the daring hunter who dared to challenge him, the king of the skies. Despite his unease, I chose not to harm him, opting instead to release him back into the wild. Observing his flight patterns, I eventually discovered his nest nestled in the hills northwest of the lake. The following day, while scouting the area, I encountered Old Whitehead's mate, a larger eagle, carrying food towards a towering cliff. The next morning, Old Whitehead guided me to their nest perched on the cliff face. The climb up the sheer rock was treacherous, with the eagles circling overhead, their keen eyes watching my every move. Despite the daunting ascent and the looming threat of the fierce birds, I pressed on, determined to reach the eaglets and ensure their safety.|"['1.

I stood by the old tree, gazing at the vast forest below to gather my thoughts. Eagles circled nearby with curious eyes, and I hesitated, unsure how to proceed. The tree was climbable, but the massive nest at the top made it impossible to see the eaglets without destroying it. I didn't want to upset the mother eagle. As I contemplated, the eagles hovered around, unsure of my intentions. Old Whitehead, marked by my bullet, seemed to convey a message of caution. Eventually, I found a precarious path up the cliff, reaching a ledge near the nest. Peering inside, I saw the young birds and their savage feast. The mother eagle shielded her young, while Old Whitehead approached me, bridging a connection between us. The mother tried to teach one eaglet to fly, but fear held it back. This encounter with nature was a profound lesson in courage and compassion.|"[""1.

Once, a mother eagle tried to coax her young one out of the nest. After much persuasion, the little eagle finally leaped to a ledge above. But fear gripped him as he looked down below. The mother, sensing his hesitation, swooped down and nudged him off the nest. The little one was now airborne, flapping frantically. The mother eagle flew beside him, reassuring him softly. Despite his efforts, fear consumed the young eagle, and he started to fall. In a moment of panic, he tipped downward. But just in time, the mother eagle swooped under him, allowing him to regain balance. With a few feathers torn out, the young eagle learned to fly, guided by his mother's wisdom and care.

"On a cold winter night while camping in the wilderness, the snow softly falls into the crackling fire, and the forest is silent. Suddenly, a loud screech pierces the darkness.

In the winter woods, Upweekis the lynx is a master of stealth. He lurks in the shadows, drawn by the rabbits near your fire. Despite his fierce cry, he often misses his prey unless he stumbles upon it. Upweekis' eyes glow in the darkness, watching and waiting. He plays a cat-and-mouse game with unsuspecting travelers, creeping closer until they retreat to safety. To catch a glimpse of this elusive predator, one must set traps along his nightly paths or stumble upon his tracks in the snow-covered forest. Even then, Upweekis remains a mysterious shadow, revealing himself only when he chooses. His unexpected appearances offer fleeting insights into his secretive life in the wilderness.|"['1.

Once, I perched in a tree about twenty feet high, watching a bait of fish I had set out. I hoped to see a bear, so I climbed high to avoid my scent reaching it. It was early autumn, and I meant no harm. Suddenly, I heard a commotion nearby as a red squirrel was chased by unseen creatures. The squirrel ran up my tree, closely followed by a pine marten and a young lynx. The lynx, startled by my presence, hesitated before fleeing. The squirrel, now safe, became curious about me. I learned about the lynx's hunting habits and a story about a man and his dog who encountered a group of lynxes while tracking a missing heifer.

In the wild, when Upweekis and his hunting pack catch prey, they immediately fight over it. Despite having enough food, their instinct drives them to grab as much as they can for themselves. The fights are fierce and brutal, making one forget that Upweekis is just a shadow and see him as a fiend. Once, while tracking a large lynx in winter, the trail led to a wounded caribou. The lynx closed in on the struggling caribou, waiting for the right moment to attack. The scene was intense, with the lynxes circling and growling, ready to pounce. Eventually, the lynxes overpowered the caribou, leaving behind a red trail in the snow. As other scavengers like foxes and birds gathered to feed, a fierce lynx confronted the observer, showcasing the harsh reality of survival in the wilderness.|['1.

The feast abruptly ended when the first alarm sounded. The marten vanished instantly, and the foxes, fisher, and a lynx slinked away. Unknown to me, another lynx approached the carcass, locking eyes with me. More lynxes had joined the meal, and all the big cats fixated on me with their wild yellow eyes. A tense moment ensued as the lynx on my side growled menacingly. Another lynx leaped over and positioned itself next to him, facing me. They inched closer, pausing to stare intensely at me. As they crept nearer, two more lynxes appeared. With no time to spare, I fired shots at the lynxes, scattering them away. Another time, a lone lynx trailed me, making me uneasy. Despite my suspicion, I continued until I spotted Upweekis, a formidable figure tailing me. A swift four-mile sprint ensued to outpace the cunning creature before nightfall. He shadowed me, waiting for an opportunity, possibly eyeing the scent of the fresh caribou skin. The chase intensified as he lurked nearby, hungering for flesh and blood.|"['1.

One day, while exploring the wilderness, I encountered a lynx named Upweekis. The encounter was intense as I tried to defend myself with a club against the snarling creature. Despite my attempts, Upweekis remained wary and elusive. As I called for my rifle, the lynx's behavior changed, becoming more cautious and hidden. Eventually, I lost track of Upweekis in the darkening woods. Later, during the summer, I stumbled upon a different side of Upweekis when I discovered a pair of lynx kittens. The kittens, bristling and hissing, revealed their presence before retreating into cover.

I had only caught a glimpse of the elusive lynx family before they retreated into their den among the rocky outcrops. Determined to observe them further, I marked a spot to keep watch. The next morning, with the mother lynx away hunting, I readied my rifle for her return. As I waited, the young lynxes emerged, hungry and restless. Suddenly, the mother returned with a fresh kill, a hare, and the kittens eagerly devoured it. Despite a brief scuffle over the meal, they feasted greedily, oblivious to their surroundings. The fierce mother watched from a distance, ensuring her young were fed. My time for observation was cut short as my vacation ended and camp was being packed up. I missed the chance to witness the playful antics of the lynx kittens, but the experience of seeing them in their natural habitat was unforgettable.|['1.

In just thirty minutes, the fierce meal ended. The little ones sat up, licked their mouths, and started to clean their paws. The mother, who had been dozing, now stood and approached her offspring. A transformation had occurred within the family. The kittens rushed to greet their mother, nuzzling against her legs or sitting up to rub their whiskers against hers—a delayed appreciation for the breakfast she had provided. The once fierce mother also appeared different. She arched her back against the roots, purring loudly, while the little ones purred against her sides. She lovingly licked them with her tongue, as they tried to reciprocate by licking her face. All their tongues were moving at once as they lay down together. It was now time to hunt them. The gun was ready. However, the watcher had changed too. He no longer saw Upweekis as a ferocious creature to be killed. He now saw her gentleness and sacrifice for her young. This tenderness touched him deeply, and he quietly left, following his twig compass back to the canoes where Simmo awaited. Perhaps one day, Simmo and I will return to camp there in the winter. I will listen for the night cry that tells me Moktaques the rabbit is safe from the young lynx.

"In the wilderness, Hukweem's cries have a mysterious meaning. Simmo explains that when Hukweem cries, he first calls out, ""Where are you? O where are you?"" like a crazy laugh. Then, if no one answers, he apologizes, saying, ""O I so sorry, so sorry! Ooooo-eee!"" like a lost woman in the woods. This sheds light on the eerie sound of Hukweem's call. It's like being deep in the wilderness at night, hearing a haunting cry asking, ""Where are you?"" Sometimes, he changes it up and asks, ""Who are you? O who are you?""

"Once upon a time, there was a mother loon on a distant lake whose eggs were taken by a sneaky muskrat. The mother loon, unaware of the culprit, searched desperately for her missing eggs. When a canoe approached the lake, she swam towards it, crying out as if asking, ""Where are they? O where are they?"" Following the canoe, she accused the visitors of theft repeatedly. The loon's haunting cry is a significant part of its existence, echoing through the wilderness at night. The loon's education begins early, as seen when a mother loon tried to distract a curious explorer from her nest with loud cries and splashing. The explorer later discovered the hidden nest with two olive eggs and witnessed the hatching of two tiny loon chicks, eager for their newfound freedom."|"[""1.

Watching Hukweem fish is always fascinating, but his shyness makes it hard to observe. I discovered his favorite fishing spot and hid in the bushes on the shore to watch him daily. Approaching him in a canoe was futile, as he would sink deeper into the water upon my arrival. It seemed like he was intentionally submerging himself. Despite his body being lighter than water, he could effortlessly disappear beneath the surface. If you approach him in a canoe, he moves away slowly, observing you with each eye before vanishing underwater. By following the direction of his bill as he dives, you can predict where he will resurface. Chasing him can be tricky since he often misleads pursuers by changing directions underwater. Tiring him out requires strategic paddling and anticipation of his movements.|['1.

In the fall, the loons put on a show. They gather in a bay, hidden from view, and start making a racket. Simmo thinks they're playing a game. One evening, the noise changes. There are moments of silence, then sudden wild yelling, followed by regular loon chatter and more silence. It's a peculiar pattern. Intrigued, I abandon my fishing to investigate. The loons seem to be up to something different. Their antics pique my interest.|"[""1.

During a peaceful day on a lake, I witnessed an exciting race among a group of loons. The loons were lined up along the bay, and suddenly, two loons at the end of the line started racing towards each other, with the other loons following closely behind. As the two leading loons reached the finish line, they let out loud cries of victory. This seemed to be a fun pastime for the loons after their summer responsibilities were over. I later discovered a mother loon nesting in a secluded area, and despite my attempts to observe her and her young, she remained cautious and elusive. However, by patiently waiting and gaining her trust, I was able to watch her closely without disturbing her. This experience provided me with a unique insight into the behavior of these fascinating birds.|['1. What did the witness observe during a peaceful day on the lake?\nA. A group of ducks swimming\nB.

I had hoped to see the mother loon guide her young ones out of their eggs and into the water, but it was too much to expect. One day I heard them chirping inside the eggs; the next day, they were gone from the nest. I feared something had harmed them while the mother was away. However, upon her return, two fluffy little loons emerged from the grass where she had hidden them. It was a joy to watch them eat eagerly and explore their new world, while the mother watched over them with care. She taught them how to swim, hide, and dive, showing her remarkable grace and love. One day, the young loons ventured too far into the bay alone and were threatened by Musquash, a muskrat. The mother loon swiftly intervened, protecting her young from harm and showing her fierce devotion.|"['1.
