The attic was cozy and warm, a perfect place to play on a cold, rainy day. Despite the smaller size compared to their grandpa's attic, the children had a great time.

Laddie quickly climbed the remaining steps and found a spot in the corner to watch Mun Bun on the scooter. A younger girl with fluffy hair and a bright smile joined him. She was a year younger than Russ, who was eight. Russ pushed the scooter across the attic floor, Mun Bun holding on tightly. While waiting, Russ gave Margy and Rose rides on the scooter. The roller-skate wheels worked well on the smooth floor, though they occasionally wobbled. Laddie explained that without their mother or Norah around, he took the board to create a hill for the scooter. Boxes were used to prop up the ironing board, creating a small slope. Russ and Laddie sat on the scooter, ready to ride down the makeshift hill. However, the scooter veered sideways, causing a commotion with the other Bunker siblings.|['Question 1: Who found a spot in the corner to watch Mun Bun on the scooter?\nA) Russ\nB) Margy\nC) Rose\nD) Laddie\nE) Norah', 'Question 2: How old is the girl with fluffy hair who joined Laddie to watch Mun Bun?\nA) Six\nB) Seven\nC) Eight\nD) Nine\nE) Ten', 'Question 3: What did Russ use to create a hill for the scooter in the attic?\nA) Chairs\nB) Boxes\nC) Tables\nD) Rugs\nE) Lamps', 'Question 4: What occasionally wobbled while Russ gave rides on the scooter?\nA) The attic floor\nB) The ironing board\nC) The scooter\nD) The boxes\nE) The roller-skate wheels', 'Question 5: Who sat on the scooter ready to ride down the makeshift hill?\nA) Mun Bun\nB) Margy\nC) Rose\nD) Russ\nE) Laddie', 'Question 6: What caused a commotion with the other Bunker siblings?\nA) The ironing board\nB) The boxes\nC) The scooter\nD) The roller-skate wheels\nE) The attic floor']|['D) Laddie', 'A) Six', 'B) Boxes', 'E) The roller-skate wheels', 'D) Russ', 'C) The scooter']

""Well, the name of the town, as I said, is Moon City, and I suppose it was named that because the moon looks so beautiful over the mountains.

Sometimes, the spring on Uncle Fred's ranch runs dry, causing trouble for everyone. When this happens, they have to haul water from the creek in barrels, which isn't as good to drink as the spring water. Uncle Fred mentioned that whenever the spring dries up, some of his cattle disappear. He used to think they wandered off, but since they never return, he suspects they might be taken on purpose. Mr. Bell added that the cattle are far from the spring, making it a mystery. To solve this, Uncle Fred decided to consult water engineers who study springs, rivers, and lakes. He even got a book to learn more about the springs on his ranch. Despite challenges like cattle stampedes and wildfires, Uncle Fred and his partner, Captain Roy, work hard to manage the ranch and keep their houses safe.|"[""1.

The Bunker family embarked on a lengthy journey from Pennsylvania to Uncle Fred's ranch in Montana. The four-day train ride was uneventful, with the children gazing out the windows, playing games, and reading books. At night, the seats transformed into beds.

Mr. Bunker walked through the swaying train aisle to the berth where his wife and Margy were. He softly opened the curtains of the adjacent compartment, finding Violet and Rose inside. The porter, noticing Mr. Bunker's movements, approached, concerned if there was trouble. Mr. Bunker explained that Mun Bun was missing, possibly having wandered into another berth. Uncle Fred suggested Mun Bun might be sleeping in someone else's berth, mistaking them for family. The porter hesitated to wake the passengers but was reassured by Uncle Fred to wait until morning. Another passenger shared that Mun Bun had unknowingly slept in his berth, mistaking him for his pet dog. Eventually, Mun Bun was safely returned to his family's berth, still sleeping peacefully.|"['1.

Mun Bun, unfamiliar with sleeping on moving trains, must have tossed and turned during the night. Restless, he wandered away from his father's bed without realizing it. He likely walked down the train car aisle by himself and crawled into a berth with a stranger. The man only woke up when he had a strange dream about his pet dog and found Mun Bun. Uncle Fred joked about the incident at breakfast, relieved they didn't have to wake up all the passengers to find the lost boy. The train journey continued, and they eventually arrived at Moon City, a small town known as a city. The children had a quick look around before heading to the ranch in a big wagon. Cowboys on horses greeted them, riding wildly and making noise with their revolvers. The Bunkers settled into the ranch house, a cozy bungalow with modern amenities like water pumped from a mysterious spring.|"['1.

Uncle Fred pointed out the cook, Bill Johnson, who entered the room with a tray. After supper, everyone explored the ranch. The children saw where the cowboys slept and the corral for the ponies. The six little Bunkers were tired but excited. The next morning, they had breakfast and then Russ and Laddie made a lasso. A lasso is a rope with a slip-knot used to catch animals. As they walked around, they saw frightened calves in the corral. Russ got caught in his own lasso, but a man rescued him. The man explained how he saved Russ from the calf and how Russ got tangled up.

Uncle Fred introduced his sister, Mrs. Bunker, and her husband, Mr. Bunker, to Captain Robert Roy, his ranch partner. Explaining the mysterious spring on the ranch, Uncle Fred shared how the water overflowed at times but mysteriously dried up soon after, leaving everyone puzzled. He expressed his concern that if the spring continued to dry up intermittently, it might affect the ranch's value. Uncle Fred then gave a tour of the ranch to the Bunker family, showing them the buildings, cattle operations, and the Shetland ponies. He mentioned the challenges faced, such as cattle thefts and Indian troubles, keeping life on the ranch busy and unpredictable.

Uncle Fred had a unique way of using a half coconut shell as a cup by the spring. Russ dipped it in the water to quench everyone's thirst. They noticed the water level dropping, similar to a bathtub draining. Daddy Bunker examined the rocks where the water bubbled from cracks. The spring was drying up slowly. Uncle Fred speculated that the source might be cut off upstream. They hoped the spring would refill soon. As they watched, the water diminished until the basin was nearly empty. Uncle Fred mentioned that sometimes the cattle disappeared when the spring dried up. Despite the concern, they decided to focus on having fun with the little Bunkers and would investigate the water issue later.|['1.

After dinner, the six little Bunkers began to have fun. Mun Bun and Margy went for their naps, but Rose and Violet played with their Japanese dolls on the porch. Uncle Fred showed them a corral with Shetland ponies. The kids rode the gentle ponies in a big field. Russ, Rose, Vi, and Laddie rode by themselves, while Uncle Fred and a cowboy led the younger ones. After the ride, Mun Bun and Margy woke up and also got pony rides. Uncle Fred planned a ride with the children to explore the source of their spring water. The kids said goodbye to the ponies and returned to the house. Captain Roy was waiting, looking worried. A cowboy mentioned that some steers had disappeared, cautioning the kids to stay close. The children had a snack of bread, milk, and canned peaches. Bill Johnson, the cook, explained that canned peaches were popular due to the scarcity of fresh fruit on the ranch. Captain Roy suggested feeding the ponies to make them friendly.|"['1.

A while later, the six little Bunkers strolled with their mother toward a creek at Three Star Ranch. It wasn't large, but enough for thirsty cattle. When the spring dried, they used creek water. Uncle Fred mentioned a tank of spring water until the dry spell passed. Russ, Laddie, and Vi made boats from wood scraps, floating them downstream. Mun Bun dug holes, Margy played with her doll. Mrs. Bunker, feeling tired, dozed off against a tree. The children played nearby, pretending a doctor treated Rose's doll. Mrs. Bunker awoke, noticing Vi missing. They searched, finding only five kids. Violet had wandered off with her doll. They hurried back to find her with Captain Roy, walking over the green fields.|['1.

Violet was picking flowers on the plain, pretending her doll was helping. But as she wandered, she found herself lost. Surrounded by hills and unable to see any landmarks, she felt disoriented. Despite her efforts to find her way back, she only moved farther away. As the sun began to set, Violet grew scared and started to cry. Meanwhile, back at the house, her family realized she was missing and prepared to search for her. During this time, Laddie discovered a mud turtle, mistaking it for a snapping turtle. The adults discussed the disappearance of some cattle, suspected to be stolen. Despite efforts to locate the missing animals, they remained elusive.

The four older Bunker children had mastered riding the Shetland ponies well. Uncle Fred had entrusted them with four gentle ponies and a fenced-in field to ride in. Russ and Laddie took out their special ponies to play cowboys and Indians in the meadow. They even crafted an Indian carriage for Margy to ride in, inspired by Indian pictures. Margy enjoyed the bumpy ride until a mishap spilled her out, but she laughed it off. The boys decided to let her sleep while they played tag. They later enjoyed canned peaches, as fresh ones were scarce. However, upon returning to the field, they discovered the ponies and Margy's carriage missing, possibly due to leaving the bars down in the fence.|"['1.

"Bill Johnson guided the way to the corral where the ponies were housed. Among their companions were the two missing ponies. The sticks were still attached to the one Russ had ridden, and Margy was safe in her spot between the poles. Bill explained, ""The ponies decided to join the others in the corral.

Two brothers, Russ and Laddie, decided to build a wind wagon after Russ shared a story about a boy who had a thrilling ride in one. They found an old express wagon on the ranch, fixed it up with help from a cowboy, and added a sail to catch the wind. With a mast, sail, gaff, and boom in place, they were ready to test their creation. Daddy Bunker helped set up the sail, and soon the wind caught it, propelling the wagon forward. With Russ steering by pulling a rope attached to the front wheels, they glided across the prairies, feeling the breeze and excitement of their homemade wind wagon.|['1.

The children were enjoying rides in the wind wagon Russ had built, traveling straight across the prairie. Each child took a turn, but Mun Bun caused a bit of trouble by trying to steer. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind overturned the wind wagon, breaking the mast and sail. Daddy Bunker decided it was too damaged to use again. Despite the mishap, the children had fun for the rest of the day and even went on pony rides in the evening. Later, Uncle Fred warned about a prairie fire approaching due to the dry spring, urging everyone to help plow a strip of land to create a barrier. The older children were excited to watch the plowing process to prevent the fire from reaching the ranch houses.|['1.

Uncle Fred and Captain Roy, along with the cowboys, rushed to fight the prairie fire. They quickly gathered plows and horses to create a wide strip of bare ground to stop the fire from spreading.

The ranch was bustling with activity as the men from neighboring ranches joined forces to fight a fire. Grateful for their help, the rancher invited them to share a meal. Meanwhile, the little Bunker siblings had a separate meal. As the afternoon unfolded, some of the children went fishing while others enjoyed a wagon ride with Mrs. Bunker. During the ride, they visited a neighbor who Mrs. Bunker hadn't seen in a long time. Unexpectedly, two cowboys swooped in to rescue Russ and Laddie, carrying them on horseback to safety. The cowboys explained the dangers of a stampede and their mission to stop it. They rode ahead of the thundering cattle, firing revolvers to redirect their path and prevent chaos.

Maybe I wouldn't be here now. Go home, but don't mention me."" Russ went back to Laddie and saw the cowboy try to stand but cry out and fall back. He lay still. Later, Rose and her dad rode out. Passing the strange spring with water still, her dad noticed a hole. ""I hear water near where Russ and Laddie dug. Maybe we'll uncover Uncle Fred's spring secret. Let's go find them."" Her dad explained, ""They dug a hole near your spring. There's a sound of water from their 'well.' Come see."" Uncle Fred said, ""We need shovels to dig. Laddie and Russ found the spot. It's good I brought the Bunkers to Three Star Ranch."" He added, ""The kids are fine but told a story about a cowboy with a broken leg near the bridge. Maybe check it out."""|"['1.

Mother Bunker mentioned that Russ and Laddie had seen a cowboy, and they rode home from the bridge just after Daddy Bunker and Rose left. Uncle Fred doubted the cowboy was his, but they decided to check at the bridge. Meanwhile, Rose stayed back with her mother and brothers. At the bridge, they found the cowboy with a broken leg. They carefully moved him to the bunk-house and called the doctor. The cowboy, Sam Thurston, needed to rest until his leg healed. By the time they finished, it was too dark to check the well dug by Russ and Laddie. The children enjoyed listening to Uncle Fred's Western stories before bedtime, including a riddle from Laddie about bears and trees. Mother Bunker then sent the children off to bed, except for Mun Bun and Margy who were already asleep.|"['1.

"When the six little Bunkers woke up the next day at Three Star Ranch, they were surprised by the bustling activity around them. Cowboys were busy riding back and forth, Uncle Fred and Daddy Bunker were in work clothes, and Captain Roy was getting ready for a hunt to find the cattle thieves. The ranch was abuzz with preparations to solve the mystery of the disappearing cattle and the drying spring.

Daddy Bunker explained the plan to the children. They would investigate the gurgling sound in the well dug by Russ and Laddie to understand the underground water flow. Meanwhile, Captain Roy and the cowboys would track down the men responsible for the cattle thefts. Mrs. Bunker shared new information about how the thieves diverted water from Uncle Fred's spring to hide their tracks, causing the spring to dry up.

With the help of a reformed cowboy, who had insider knowledge of the thieves' operations, they were determined to recover the stolen cattle and put an end to the water troubles at Three Star Ranch for good."|"['1.
