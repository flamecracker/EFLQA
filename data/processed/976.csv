Recently, my young friend Eustace Bright paid me a quick visit. He had taken a break from college during the winter vacation to recover from the toll studying had taken on his health. I was glad to see him in good physical shape. Eustace had rushed over from Boston on the noon train out of his friendship for me and also to discuss some literary matters. I was pleased to welcome Mr. Bright to my humble abode for the first time. I showed him around my small property, despite its neglected appearance due to the winter weather. Eustace found the view from my hill unimpressive compared to the grandeur of Monument Mountain and other places he was familiar with. However, I find a peaceful charm in the gentle slopes and meadows that surround my home, unlike the imposing mountains that can become monotonous. Eustace seemed unimpressed until I took him to a ruined summer house on the hillside, which he found surprisingly picturesque. He likened the structure to a magical work of art, full of inspiration and reminiscent of a cathedral. We then moved to my study to review some new stories Eustace had written, discussing the creative process and the merits of his work.|"[""1.

"Mr. Bright appointed me as the editor of the ""Wonder-Book"" due to my literary experience. The success of that work led him to offer me a similar role for the new book, ""TANGLEWOOD TALES."" Although Eustace's reputation could stand alone, he appreciated our collaboration. The new stories promised rich subjects, but their darker themes posed a challenge in presenting them to children. Eustace believed that by narrating these myths, their objectionable elements faded away, leaving only innocence. According to him, these tales were created in a time when evil and sorrow were mere shadows. By retelling them with a childlike perspective, the original purity could be restored. While Eustace's enthusiasm was admirable, time would reveal the truth about his work. Despite some moral objections, he managed to transform these ancient legends for a new audience of children."|"['1.

In a faraway city named Troezene, once lived a young boy named Theseus. His grandfather, King Pittheus, was wise, and Theseus, growing up in the royal palace, learned much from him. Theseus' mother, Aethra, often spoke of his father, King Aegeus of Athens, who couldn't be with them as he had a kingdom to rule. Theseus, eager and strong-willed, tried to move a heavy rock to prove his strength. His mother, watching sadly, told him he must grow stronger before he could journey to Athens to meet his father. The rock, covered with moss and surrounded by greenery, remained unmoved by Theseus' efforts. Despite his determination, he had to wait until he was truly ready to embark on his adventures.|"['1.

But, as challenging as it seemed, Theseus was maturing into a strong young man, confident that soon he could overcome the heavy stone. Even when Theseus pointed out where a flower's stem had been disturbed by the rock, Aethra remained unconvinced. She began to realize that her son was no longer a child and soon would face the world's dangers. A year later, they sat by the stone again. Theseus, eager to prove himself, exerted all his strength to move the stone, determined to succeed or perish trying. With a mother's mix of pride and sorrow, Aethra watched as the rock slowly lifted, revealing a cavity containing a sword and sandals, belongings of his father, King Aegeus. Theseus was to wear them to follow in his father's heroic footsteps. His mother prepared him for the journey, while his grandfather advised him to travel by sea to avoid the dangers on the land route to Athens.|"['1.

When Theseus learned about robbers and monsters, he eagerly set out to confront them. After bidding farewell to his grandfather and mother, he embarked on his journey to Athens, tears still fresh on his cheeks. Along the way, he encountered and defeated dangerous foes like Procrustes, who stretched or cut his victims to fit his bed, and Scinis, who tossed people off cliffs. Theseus also vanquished a monstrous sow terrorizing farmers, providing them with meat. Despite his heroic deeds, upon reaching Athens, Theseus faced new challenges. His father's nephews, seeking power, plotted against him, while his stepmother, the wicked enchantress Medea, aimed to secure the throne for her son.

"""Leave that to me, please your majesty,"" she replied. ""Only admit this evil-minded young man to your presence, treat him civilly, and invite him to drink a goblet of wine. Your majesty is well aware that I sometimes amuse myself by distilling very powerful medicines. Here is one of them in this small phial. As to what it is made of, that is one of my secrets of state. Do but let me put a single drop into the goblet, and let the young man taste it; and I will answer for it, he shall quite lay aside the bad designs with which he comes hither.""As she said this, Medea smiled; but, for all her smiling face, she meant nothing less than to poison the poor innocent Theseus, before his father's eyes. And King Aegeus, like most other kings, thought any punishment mild enough for a person who was accused of plotting against his life. He therefore made little or no objection to Medea's scheme, and as soon as the poisonous wine was ready, gave orders that the young stranger should be admitted into his presence.The goblet was set on a table beside the king's throne; and a fly, meaning just to sip a little from the brim, immediately tumbled into it, dead.

King Aegeus was hesitant to give Theseus the poisoned wine, as he was conflicted about taking the young man's life. Despite being urged by his nephew and seeing the sword Theseus carried, Aegeus hesitated. Theseus, recognizing his father's sword and sandals, shared his story, explaining his quest to find his father. Meanwhile, the wicked Medea, seeing the turn of events, used her enchantments to escape on a chariot pulled by serpents, stealing valuables. The people of Athens rejoiced at her departure. Theseus gained favor with his father by performing heroic deeds, like capturing a mad bull. As he longed for more adventures, a new challenge arose.|"['1.

One morning, Prince Theseus woke up to what he thought was a sad dream lingering in his mind. The air seemed filled with cries of sorrow, coming from the palace, streets, temples, and homes. These sounds merged into one mournful noise, revealing a distressing truth to Theseus. The King explained that it was the day when youths and maidens were chosen to be devoured by the monstrous Minotaur on the island of Crete. Despite the danger, Theseus, a brave prince, offered to face the Minotaur to spare his people. After much discussion, the King agreed, and Theseus prepared to embark on the perilous journey. The vessel with black sails symbolizing sorrow set sail, carrying Theseus and others to confront the Minotaur. The King, filled with grief, watched from the shore, hoping for his son's safe return with bright sails signaling victory.|"['1.

Theseus pledged to fulfill his promise and set sail with the mariners. The vessel's black sails fluttered in the faint breeze off the shore, filled with the melancholy sighs of the passengers. As they ventured further into the sea, a strong northwest wind pushed them joyfully towards their destination. Despite the somber occasion, the young travelers found moments of laughter and dance on the deck. Theseus, eager for land, noticed a colossal figure on the island's edge, appearing metallic and colossal. The giant, named Talus, seemed to be a marvel of craftsmanship, possibly created by Vulcan himself. Talus circled the island tirelessly, challenging any approaching ships. As they neared the port, the giant raised his club, ready to strike, but instead, he spoke a single booming word. The vessel passed safely, and the group was escorted to King Minos's palace, a ruler as unyielding as the metal giant.|"[""1.

King Minos selected the captives one by one, prodding them with his sceptre to gauge their condition before dismissing them. Theseus, however, caught the king's attention with his calm and brave demeanor. Theseus boldly confronted King Minos about the sacrifices to the Minotaur and called the king a greater monster than the beast itself. The king, amused, decided to make Theseus the Minotaur's first victim. Ariadne, the king's daughter, felt compassion for the captives, especially for Theseus.

In the ancient labyrinth built by Daedalus, Ariadne guided Theseus to confront the Minotaur. The creature's roar echoed through the maze, a mix of bull and human sounds. Armed with a sword and a silken thread, Theseus ventured forth, the maze spinning around him. Ariadne's gentle tugs on the thread kept him from getting lost. As Theseus drew near the Minotaur, he saw the monstrous being, part man, part bull, filled with rage and loneliness. Despite his hatred, Theseus felt a twinge of pity for the wretched creature. The Minotaur's cries revealed his misery and hunger, his desire to devour humanity. With courage and resolve, Theseus prepared to face the fearsome beast in the heart of the labyrinth.|"['1.

The brave hero Theseus faced the monstrous Minotaur in a fierce battle in the dark labyrinth. The Minotaur, with his sharp horns and mighty roar, charged at Theseus, but the hero's quick reflexes saved him from the beast's attack. In a clash of sword against horn, Theseus managed to strike the Minotaur, causing his bull head to separate from his body. The victory was won, and the captives were freed. Theseus, guided by the thread held by Ariadne, emerged from the labyrinth triumphant. As they prepared to sail to Athens, Theseus urged Ariadne to join them, away from the cruel King Minos.

Long ago, in a time of incredible tales, there was a Giant named Antaeus and a group of tiny people known as Pygmies. These earth-born siblings lived harmoniously in the heart of Africa. The Pygmies, being so small and residing in a distant land with vast deserts and towering mountains, were rarely seen by others. The Giant, due to his immense size, was easier to spot but best avoided. Meanwhile, in a different story, Theseus and Ariadne faced challenges. Some unkind individuals spread falsehoods about their noble actions. Despite the rumors, Ariadne chose to stay with her father, showing kindness and grace. Theseus, on his journey back home, faced a tragic misunderstanding that led to a sorrowful event involving his father, King Aegeus.

In the Pygmy land, a six or eight-inch tall person was considered very tall. Picture their tiny cities with streets only two or three feet wide, lined with homes the size of a squirrel's cage. The grand king's palace was as big as a baby house, and their temple soared as high as a bureau. These structures were made of straw, feathers, and eggshells, like birds' nests. The Pygmies planted wheat in fields as vast as flower beds and had to chop it down with tiny axes at harvest. They lived beside a Giant named Antaeus, so colossal that he used a pine tree as a walking stick. Despite his immense power, he was kind to the Pygmies, who adored him.

Antaeus, the friendly Giant, and the Pygmies shared a unique bond. Despite their vast size difference, they cherished each other's company. The Pygmies, with their short lives, had generations of camaraderie with Antaeus. The Giant, towering like a cathedral, enjoyed the playful antics of the tiny folks. They would scamper around him, and even when he accidentally sat on a group of them, they forgave him. The Pygmies felt a kinship with Antaeus, realizing that without their friendship, he would be terribly lonely. They entertained him on holidays, climbing on his hand and exploring his features fearlessly. Although sometimes mischievous, poking him with their tiny weapons, Antaeus always took it in good humor. Their playful interactions brought immense joy to the Giant, who would erupt in laughter that resonated like thunder, delighting the Pygmies.|['1.

The Pygmies and the cranes were in a constant war, with battles that sometimes led to victories for either side. The Pygmies, armed with swords, spears, bows, and arrows, rode into battle on creatures like squirrels, rabbits, or hedgehogs. The cranes, flapping their wings and stretching their necks, would try to snatch up Pygmies in their beaks. If a Pygmy managed to pluck a feather from a crane, it was a great honor. The Giant Antaeus, who observed the battles, would intervene to help the Pygmies if needed. After victories, the Pygmies celebrated with processions, banquets, and shows. In a remarkable turn of events, a massive stranger approached, wearing a golden helmet and lion's skin, armed with a sword and a club. The Pygmies, more lively than their Giant friend, urged him to rise and face the stranger who was approaching.|"['1.

Antaeus couldn't bear the thought of anyone being mightier than him. The Pygmies' words hurt him more than their swords. Sulking, he gaped widely, then spotted a stranger. Leaping up and grabbing his stick, he strode to meet the stranger, waving the pine tree. Antaeus had a unique power - he grew stronger whenever he touched the earth. Some say he grew ten times stronger each time. Imagine the strength he gained with each step! The stranger, Hercules, faced Antaeus fearlessly. Antaeus threatened Hercules, but Hercules remained calm. They clashed, and Hercules defeated Antaeus with a mighty blow. Despite Antaeus' strength, Hercules emerged victorious. The Pygmies were shocked, realizing there was someone stronger than Antaeus.|"[""1.

The Pygmies' capital was destroyed by the Giant's fury and Hercules' blows. The Pygmies, though tiny, made a great noise, thinking they were contributing to the chaos. Antaeus, aflame with anger, attacked Hercules with a pine tree, but Hercules defended himself with his club. The splinters from the shattered tree hurt the Pygmies. Hercules realized he needed a new strategy to defeat Antaeus, who gained strength from touching the earth. Hercules lifted Antaeus into the air, weakening him. Eventually, Hercules tossed Antaeus far away, where he lay motionless. The Pygmies, saddened by their fallen brother, cried out. Ignoring them, Hercules rested, unaware of the Pygmies' existence. While Hercules slept, the Pygmies plotted and gathered, ready to act.|"[""1.

It was decided that the Pygmies, as a nation, would work together to defeat Hercules. Not because they doubted his strength, but to share in the glory. Some Pygmies suggested sending a herald to challenge Hercules formally, but wise elders believed a surprise attack was best. Twenty thousand archers and fighters armed themselves to take down Hercules. They tried to blind him and block his breath, but his powerful breath blew them away. They then set a fire around him, but he awoke. Hercules, amused by the tiny warriors, lifted one Pygmy for a closer look. The Pygmy challenged him to battle, but Hercules found the situation amusing. Laughing, Hercules marveled at the bravery of the tiny champion and the absurdity of the situation.|"['1.

In ancient times, a noble man, Hercules, encountered a brave nation of Pygmies. Despite his enormous size, he admired their courage and sought peace. Hercules humorously agreed to take only five strides through their kingdom and leave on the sixth, careful not to step on any of them unknowingly. He then playfully admitted his defeat by the Pygmies. The story also recounts how three royal siblings, Cadmus, Phoenix, and Cilix, along with their sister Europa, played near the seashore. Europa, tired from playing, encountered a snow-white bull that she initially feared. However, the bull's gentle demeanor and playful nature soon won her over.

Once upon a time, a clever bull saw Europa was no longer afraid of him. Overjoyed, he pranced around the meadow with joy, as light as a bird. Europa, a king's daughter, rode the bull, holding ivory horns. The bull leaped like a feather, carrying Europa to her brothers. They were amazed to see her on the bull's back. Europa waved goodbye as the bull raced to the seashore. Suddenly, the bull plunged into the sea, taking Europa with him. The brothers, filled with terror, ran to the shore. But it was too late; the bull and Europa vanished into the deep blue sea.

In a distant land, Phoenix and his companions wandered in search of his lost sister, Europa, carried away by a snow-white bull years ago. Growing weary of their fruitless quest, Phoenix decided to build a home in a tranquil place. With the help of his companions, they constructed a cozy bower of living boughs, providing a sense of comfort and refuge. As they bid farewell, Phoenix shed tears, knowing he must part ways with his loved ones. Over time, others without homes settled nearby, forming a bustling city. Recognizing Phoenix's royal lineage, the people crowned him as their king.

Before embarking on his journey, Cadmus assisted Thasus in constructing a shelter, while Telephassa, too weak to help much, provided guidance on how to make it cozy. Thasus, however, didn't spend all his time in the bower. Like Phoenix and Cilix, other wanderers came and built homes nearby, forming a new city with a palace where Thasus ruled as a just king. Despite his kingly duties, Thasus remained humble and eventually resumed his quest to find the lost child. Telephassa and Cadmus continued their search, with Telephassa growing weaker by the day.

I will not make you sad, my young listeners, by telling you how Telephassa passed away and was laid to rest. Instead, I will share that her final smile shone brighter even in death, convincing Cadmus that she had embraced Europa as she entered the afterlife. Cadmus planted flowers on his mother's grave before embarking on his journey to the oracle of Delphi, as Telephassa had advised. Along the way, he asked everyone he met about Europa, a question that had become second nature to him. Some shared stories, including a mariner who spoke of a white bull carrying a child adorned with sea-soaked flowers. Despite the various responses, Cadmus pressed on, weighed down by memories of his family left behind. As he approached Mount Parnassus, home to Delphi, he found a rustic bower marking the oracle's spot.

Cadmus grew weary of hearing the repeated words from the oracle, not understanding why he was to follow a cow. As he questioned the oracle further, the whispers died down, leaving him no wiser. He wandered aimlessly until he spotted a brindled cow, casually grazing by the wayside. The cow paid no attention to him until he approached, then started moving at a moderate pace, occasionally stopping to eat grass. Cadmus followed, whistling absentmindedly, doubting if this cow could be his guide as it seemed like any other cow. The cow continued on its peaceful path, seemingly indifferent to Cadmus. Despite his efforts to catch up, the cow maintained its leisurely pace, grazing and drinking from streams along the way. Cadmus, tired but determined, followed the cow, hoping to find a clue to his destiny.|"['1.

"One of the new friends exclaimed, ""This is truly remarkable!"" He marveled at the enchanted cow leading them on an unending journey. Unbeknownst to them, the cow's enchantment compelled them to follow. Exhausted and hungry, they trudged on, determined to support Cadmus. They envisioned a city where the cow rested, with a grand palace for Cadmus, their future king. Finally, the cow settled in a lush plain, surrounded by trees and hills. Cadmus felt a sense of homecoming. Despite the loss of his past life, he embraced his new companions. They agreed to settle there, building homes and cultivating the land.

The magical fountain was guarded by a fierce dragon who devoured anyone who came near. Cadmus, seeking revenge for his fallen friends, fearlessly attacked the dragon. Despite the dragon's attempts to harm him, Cadmus fought back, eventually delivering a fatal blow. Following a mysterious voice's instruction, Cadmus planted the dragon's teeth in the ground. To his amazement, armed warriors sprouted from the soil, ready for battle. The field filled with soldiers, trumpeters, and the clash of weapons.

Cadmus grabbed a large stone and hurled it into the midst of the earth-born army. It struck a fierce warrior's breastplate, causing him to retaliate by attacking his comrade, initiating a chaotic battle. Trumpets blared, soldiers clashed, and blood was needlessly shed until only five warriors remained. These giants, born from dragon's teeth, saluted Cadmus and awaited his command. They were fierce and formidable, covered in earth and grime, resembling a strange cross between men and vegetables. Despite their reluctance to build, Cadmus, their master, directed them to construct a city. Initially quarrelsome, they learned the value of peace and cooperation, setting aside their violent tendencies. The city began to take shape, each warrior gaining a home and a newfound sense of purpose. As they worked harmoniously, Cadmus hoped for a future where all would embrace wisdom and peace.|['1.

In ancient times, King Cadmus discovered a grand palace that rose majestically from the earth. With marble walls, a splendid dome, and intricate carvings, it was fit for a mighty ruler. As Cadmus and his loyal followers entered, they encountered a stunning woman named Harmonia, adorned like royalty. Though not his long-lost sister Europa, Harmonia was a celestial being gifted to Cadmus. They lived in the palace, raising a family of joyful children. Despite the grandeur of the palace, Cadmus found equal joy in teaching his children, even creating an alphabet for them. Meanwhile, the wise King Ulysses faced perilous adventures on his journey back to Ithaca, encountering giants and treacherous weather. Ultimately, he sought refuge on a green island, wary of lurking dangers after surviving harrowing trials at sea.|['1.

"King Ulysses was a brave and wise man. On the third day, he decided to explore the island to find food for his hungry crew. He climbed a cliff and saw a grand palace in the distance, surrounded by trees. Smoke rose from the chimney, hinting at a delicious dinner. Ulysses planned to ask the owner for help. However, a bird with purple wings and a golden crown-like tuft appeared, chirping sadly. The bird seemed to warn Ulysses of danger ahead. He heeded the warning, returned to his ship, and shared the news with his crew. The bird then pecked at a tree, occasionally repeating its mournful ""Peep, peep, pe--weep!"" Ulysses, on his way back, hunted a stag and brought it to his companions, who feasted heartily after surviving on seafood."|['1.

The following day, Ulysses and his crew felt as hungry as ever. They gazed at Ulysses, hoping he would climb the cliff again and return with another deer. Instead, he gathered the crew and explained that hunting daily for their dinner was not sustainable. He revealed that the island was inhabited and described a grand marble palace in the distance. Ulysses cautioned them about the dangers they had faced before, like the Cyclops and the Laestrygons, who devoured their comrades. He proposed splitting into two groups to seek food at the palace, with one group staying behind. Eurylochus led the group to the palace while Ulysses stayed with the others. They saw the palace's towers and smoke, and a bird with purple wings appeared, warning them with a sorrowful song. Despite the warning, most sailors pressed on towards the palace, ignoring the bird's plea to return.|"['1.

"In a pleasant wood, a group of travelers approached a magnificent marble palace. As they walked along a neatly kept pathway bordered by sweet-smelling flowers, they caught glimpses of the stunning palace getting closer. The group marveled at the beauty of the palace and the surrounding landscape.

One member of the group suggested that only savory herbs should be grown in the palace gardens for cooking. They came across a crystal spring where they saw distorted reflections of themselves, causing laughter among the group. Despite feeling a sense of impending adventure, they continued towards the palace, guided by the enticing smell of food from the kitchen.

Upon nearing the palace, they were greeted by wild beasts like lions, tigers, and wolves, which surprisingly behaved like friendly pets.

Despite his warning, his comrades were captivated by the pleasant voices and the hum of the loom. They decided to reveal themselves to the lady and her maidens. Eurylochus hesitated, observing the beauty of the woman approaching them with a welcoming smile. As his friends entered the inner room, he remained behind, puzzled by the strange happenings.

At the grand dinner, despite sitting on golden thrones, the guests behaved like pigs, gorging on food and drink. The beautiful hostess and her maidens were unimpressed by their gluttony.

Circe showed Ulysses the intricately woven cloth on the loom, created by her and the nymphs since the mariners' arrival. The tapestry depicted his friends indulging in a feast.

She recognized him as the wise mortal who could resist her enchantments. Ulysses demanded Circe to reverse the transformations she had cast upon his companions and others. Reluctantly, Circe agreed and led Ulysses to the sty where his friends, transformed into swine, resided. The swine, though behaving like beasts, showed a hint of their humanity. With Circe's magic, the swine transformed back into men, resembling their former selves. Ulysses, satisfied, saw his comrades restored, ready to continue their journey.|"['1.

Once the swinish quality had taken root in the characters of the twenty-two restored individuals, it proved difficult to eradicate. The mischievous hamadryad, fond of causing trouble, tossed a handful of acorns before them. In an instant, they wallowed shamefully, gobbling up the acorns. After collecting themselves, they rose looking foolish. The purple bird, who had been observing from above, hoped Ulysses would remember his past help. Ulysses commanded Circe to make the bird a king, leaving him unchanged. King Picus descended majestically, dressed regally. Ulysses and King Picus exchanged courtesies as equals. Picus, no longer proud, saw himself as a servant to his people. Ulysses decided to keep the lions, tigers, and wolves in their current forms to warn of their true natures. The group, including the wise Eurylochus, settled in Circe's palace to rest from their journey.|"['1.

The sea nymphs agreed to wait for Proserpina to return. While she was away, they decided to rest on a soft sponge bank under the water. The air felt too dry for their liking that day. They promised to keep an eye out for Proserpina by popping their heads up every few minutes. Meanwhile, Proserpina ventured into the fields to gather fresh and lovely flowers for her friends. She found exquisite violets, fragrant roses, superb hyacinths, aromatic pinks, and many other beautiful blossoms. As she explored, she stumbled upon a large shrub covered in magnificent flowers. Although hesitant at first, Proserpina decided to uproot the shrub to bring it home. However, as she pulled, a deep hole emerged beneath it, followed by a rumbling sound. Out of the hole emerged a team of four sable horses pulling a golden chariot with a noble but sullen man inside.|['1.

Proserpina was terrified by the stranger's appearance and voice, which rumbled like an earthquake. She tried to call for her mother, but her voice was too faint. The stranger swiftly grabbed her, leaped onto his chariot, and raced away. Proserpina cried out, leaving a trail of flowers behind. The stranger, who called himself King Pluto, promised her a palace of precious stones and jewels. He tried to convince her to stay with him, offering her a crown and throne.

Proserpina found herself in a golden chariot with King Pluto, hurtling through dark and ominous lands. Despite her cries, no one seemed to hear her except for the wind. As they sped on, the landscape grew gloomier, with rocks and shadows surrounding them. Pluto's satisfaction at the darkening world made Proserpina uneasy, but she noticed a glimmer of hope as she saw Mother Ceres tending to the fields. When they approached the gates of Pluto's palace, a fearsome three-headed dog named Cerberus greeted them. Although the dog looked fierce, Pluto treated it with affection, even though its tail was a live dragon. Proserpina couldn't help but feel a mix of fear and curiosity as she embarked on this mysterious journey into the underworld.|"['1.

Pluto, the ruler of the underworld, assured Proserpina that his guard dog, Cerberus, only harmed those who trespassed without permission. As they rode in the chariot, he pointed out the treasures of gold and diamonds in his kingdom. They reached a bridge over a dark and sluggish stream that made people forget their sorrows with a sip. Pluto offered Proserpina the water to ease her longing for her mother, but she refused, preferring to remember her dearly. Inside the palace, adorned with glowing gems, Proserpina remained the only pleasant sight. Despite the grandeur, Pluto's heartache was evident, and he longed for genuine love. He ordered a lavish banquet for Proserpina, hoping she would eat and stay with him forever, as consuming food in the underworld bound one to its realm.|"['1.

But my tale must now leave King Pluto's realm and see what Mother Ceres had been doing since her daughter was taken away. We saw her half-hidden among the grain while Proserpina was whisked off in the chariot. Proserpina's scream as the chariot disappeared was the only one her mother heard. Ceres mistook the noise for thunder, thinking it would help her crops. But Proserpina's cry made her start, fearing it was her daughter. Ceres left her work unfinished as the grain looked sickly the next day. She rushed home to find it empty. Knowing Proserpina liked the seashore, she hurried there to find the sea nymphs, who said Proserpina had left to pick flowers and not returned. Ceres searched the area but found no clues. She then lit a torch and set out to find her daughter, forgetting her chariot and dragons in her haste. Along the way, she found a flower from the shrub Proserpina had touched, suspecting foul play.|"[""1.

All night long, Ceres went from house to house, asking if anyone had seen her missing child, Proserpina. She knocked on doors and called out to tired workers, but no one had any information. Even at grand palaces, the gatekeepers mistook her for royalty, only to be disappointed by the sight of a worried woman with a torch and wilted flowers on her head. Despite the rude responses and threats, Ceres continued her search through the night and into the day without rest or food. She questioned not only humans but also woodland creatures like hamadryads, naiads, fauns, and satyrs, all of whom had no news of Proserpina. On the tenth day, Ceres found a dimly lit cavern where she spotted a strange woman with a dog-like head and a wreath of snakes. She knew this woman enjoyed misery and was not likely to help.|['1.

Ceres, filled with sorrow over her missing daughter, sought the help of the melancholy Hecate. Despite Hecate's discouraging words, Ceres insisted on searching for her daughter. Reluctantly, Hecate agreed to accompany Ceres on the quest. As they journeyed, they encountered Phoebus, a radiant young man with a lyre. Hecate, disliking the brightness, urged Ceres not to approach him. However, Phoebus assured Ceres that he had recently seen her daughter and that she was safe.

Phoebus, with his melodious lyre, told the sorrowful tale of Proserpina's abduction by King Pluto. He described the opulent palace in the underworld where she now resided, surrounded by riches but devoid of warmth and affection. Ceres, the anguished mother, resolved to retrieve her daughter despite the formidable obstacles. Phoebus, a poet of great sensitivity, sympathized with Ceres but could not accompany her due to his strained relations with Pluto. Undeterred, Ceres set out with Hecate, determined to find a way into the dark realms below. As she wandered, her grief aged her, and she appeared disheveled and lost.

Once, on a journey to find the entrance to Pluto's realm, a woman arrived at King Cereus's palace in Eleusis. Inside, she discovered the royal family in distress over the queen's ailing baby, who refused to eat and cried in pain. Queen Metanira sought a nurse and thought the woman before her was the answer. Ceres agreed to nurse the baby but warned the queen not to interfere with her methods. Ceres cared for the child, and he quickly thrived, gaining strength and health.

Mother Ceres was devastated after her daughter, Proserpina, was taken by King Pluto. Consumed by grief, Ceres decided that nothing would grow on Earth until her daughter was returned. Fields remained barren, flowers refused to bloom, and even the vegetables and grains ceased to grow without Ceres' permission. The once vibrant Earth now appeared desolate and aged, mirroring the sorrow of its inhabitants. The starving animals followed Ceres, hoping for her help. Despite pleas for mercy, Ceres remained resolute. To undo the damage, Quicksilver was sent to persuade King Pluto to release Proserpina. Meanwhile, Proserpina, true to her word, refused to eat anything in the underworld, maintaining her resolve even when tempted with delicious treats.

"""My dear Proserpina,"" he used to say. ""I wish you could like me a little more. We gloomy and cloudy-natured folks have warm hearts too. If you'd stay with me willingly, it would make me happier than owning a hundred palaces.""""Oh,"" Proserpina replied, ""you should have tried to win me over before kidnapping me. The best thing you can do now is let me go. Maybe I'd remember you kindly. Perhaps one day I might return.""""No, no,"" Pluto said, ""I can't trust you. You prefer daylight and flowers. Aren't these gems I've dug for you prettier than a violet?"" Proserpina cried, but her tears weren't as bitter as adults'. Shortly after, she was playing merrily again. Pluto wished he could be a child too. Proserpina felt pity for him and held his hand for the first time. Pluto tried to tempt her with food, but she only craved her mother's bread and fruit.

Once the servant left the room, Proserpina couldn't resist examining the shriveled pomegranate on the golden tray. Starved for six months, she felt a sudden craving.

Just then, King Pluto and Quicksilver entered. Quicksilver noticed Proserpina's confusion and the empty tray, suspecting she had taken a nibble. Pluto, unaware, spoke kindly to her, admitting it was wrong to keep her from her mother. Feeling a twinge of guilt, Proserpina shed a tear, realizing Pluto's loneliness after her departure.

During the bustling time of year, the farmers were caught off guard by the sudden arrival of summer. Birds chirped in delight on the blossoming trees. Mother Ceres sat sadly on her doorstep, torch in hand, watching as the flame flickered out. Suddenly, the fields turned green with new life, much like the landscape under a rising sun. Proserpina ran to her mother, and they embraced joyfully. Proserpina confessed that she had tasted a pomegranate, leading to a revelation that she must spend six months of every year with King Pluto. Despite the separation, Proserpina found solace in the thought that she could spend the other six months with her mother. In another tale, Jason, the son of a dethroned king, was taught by Chiron, a Centaur who had the body of a horse and the head of a man. Chiron was a skilled teacher, instructing his pupils in various arts, including playing the harp and combat skills.|['1.

Long ago, the wise Centaur Chiron took care of young Jason in his cave. Chiron was a unique creature with the body of a horse and the head of a schoolmaster. He taught Jason many skills, including playing the harp, using weapons, and even horseback riding. As Jason grew, he learned that he was a prince and that his father had been wronged by King Pelias. Determined to right the wrongs, Jason set out on a journey, dressed in a leopard skin and his father's golden sandals. Along the way, he encountered a raging river blocking his path. Unsure how to cross, an old woman with large, beautiful eyes and a peacock by her side appeared, offering mysterious wisdom.|['Question 1: Who took care of young Jason in his cave?\nA) A wise Wizard\nB) A kind Centaur\nC) A powerful Dragon\nD) A friendly Giant\nE) A mysterious Elf', 'Question 2: What skills did Chiron teach Jason?\nA) Sewing and cooking\nB) Archery and sword fighting\nC) Juggling and acrobatics\nD) Singing and dancing\nE) Painting and sculpting', 'Question 3: Why did Jason set out on a journey?\nA) To become a king\nB) To find a treasure\nC) To explore new lands\nD) To right the wrongs done to his father\nE) To learn more skills from Chiron', 'Question 4: What did Jason wear on his journey?\nA) A crown and a cape\nB) A suit of armor\nC) A leopard skin and golden sandals\nD) A cloak of invisibility\nE) A feathered headdress', 'Question 5: What obstacle did Jason encounter on his journey?\nA) A mountain of gold\nB) A field of flowers\nC) A maze of mirrors\nD) A raging river\nE) A dark forest', 'Question 6: Who offered mysterious wisdom to Jason by the raging river?\nA) A talking tree\nB) A singing bird\nC) An old woman\nD) A magical fish\nE) A wise owl']|['B) A kind Centaur', 'B) Archery and sword fighting', 'D) To right the wrongs done to his father', 'C) A leopard skin and golden sandals', 'D) A raging river', 'C) An old woman']
The old woman requested Jason's help to cross a river to reach the other side with her peacock. Initially hesitant due to the strong current and the risk of both being swept away, Jason eventually overcame his reluctance. Remembering the noble teachings of Chiron, he decided to assist the old woman. With the peacock perched on her shoulder, Jason carried the old woman across the raging river. Despite the challenges and losing a sandal in the process, the old woman assured Jason that losing the sandal was fortunate. She hinted that Jason might be the person the Speaking Oak had mentioned. With renewed vigor and strength, Jason safely reached the opposite shore, setting down the old woman and her peacock.

The elderly lady assured Jason that he would receive a more attractive pair of sandals in the future. She wished him well on his journey, urging him to be cautious of King Pelias, who would be startled by his bare foot. As Jason walked along the path, the lady's regal aura and her majestic peacock left a lasting impression on him. He eventually reached a town near the sea, where a crowd had gathered for King Pelias' sacrifice to Neptune. The townspeople were intrigued by Jason's appearance, especially his mismatched sandals. Feeling embarrassed by the attention, Jason made his way through the crowd and ended up face to face with the king. Pelias, aware of the prophecy that a one-sandaled man would dethrone him, contemplated how to deal with Jason. Despite his initial shock, the king tried to disarm Jason with friendly questions about his origins and education.|"['1.

The voice faded into the soft rustle of leaves, leaving Jason unsure if he truly heard it or imagined the words. Seeking a skilled shipbuilder named Argus in Iolchos, Jason discovered the man's existence, proving the oak's intelligence. Argus agreed to craft a grand galley named the Argo, requiring fifty rowers. The ship took shape as carpenters toiled. Returning to the Talking Oak for advice, Jason saw a branch rustling. He heeded the sign, cutting it to create a figurehead. The carved image, guided by an unseen force, depicted a majestic woman with a Medusa head on her shield. The statue spoke, advising Jason to seek fifty brave youths for his voyage to obtain the Golden Fleece.

With the help of the North Wind's sons, prophets, and conjurors, they set sail on the Argo, facing challenges.

The Argonauts had numerous adventures during their journey. On one island, they met King Cyzicus, who was troubled by neighboring giants with six arms each. The giants were armed with clubs, swords, spears, and bows, but the Argonauts, led by Jason, bravely fought and defeated them. Later, in Thrace, they encountered King Phineus tormented by Harpies, vile creatures stealing his food. The Argonauts tricked the Harpies by setting a feast and ambushed them, making them promise to leave the king in peace. As they continued, they faced a strange attack by birds that shot steel-headed arrows. Unable to find the hidden archers, they sought help from the oaken image for advice.

Upon receiving wise advice, Jason swiftly returned to his comrades, who were more disheartened than when facing the six-armed giants. He instructed them to strike their swords against their shields. The fifty heroes enthusiastically obeyed, creating a deafening noise that scared the birds away. Orpheus, in celebration, played a triumphant tune on his harp. While on the island, they saw a vessel approaching with two handsome young princes, sons of Phrixus. The princes offered to guide the Argonauts to Colchis, warning of a dragon guarding the Golden Fleece. Undeterred, Jason was determined to proceed.

The king spoke to Jason, mentioning the challenging tasks he must complete before facing the dragon. Jason had to tame the fiery bulls with furnace stomachs, plow the sacred earth, and sow dragon's teeth. Medea, the king's daughter, offered to help Jason with her enchantress skills. She gave him a charmed ointment to protect against the bulls' fiery breath. Medea handed Jason a basket of dragon's teeth, leading him to the bulls under the starry night sky. As they entered the pasture, Medea paused, glancing around with a mysterious intelligence in her eyes.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat tasks did the king mention to Jason before facing the dragon?\nA) Tame the wild horses\nB) Plow the fields\nC) Sow dragon's teeth\nD) Hunt for treasure\nE) Climb the mountain"", 'Question 2:\nWhat did Medea offer to help Jason with?\nA) Cooking a feast\nB) Building a ship\nC) Taming wild animals\nD) Enchantress skills\nE) Painting a portrait', ""Question 3:\nWhat did Medea give Jason to protect him from the bulls' fiery breath?\nA) Sword\nB) Shield\nC) Charmed ointment\nD) Magic wand\nE) Potion"", ""Question 4:\nWhere did Medea lead Jason with the basket of dragon's teeth?\nA) Through the forest\nB) To the mountains\nC) Under the starry night sky\nD) To the river\nE) To a cave"", 'Question 5:\nHow did Medea appear as they entered the pasture?\nA) Scared\nB) Excited\nC) Mysterious\nD) Angry\nE) Sad', 'Question 6:\nWhat did Medea have in her eyes as she glanced around?\nA) Tears\nB) Fire\nC) Intelligence\nD) Confusion\nE) Darkness']"|"[""C) Sow dragon's teeth"", 'D) Enchantress skills', 'C) Charmed ointment', 'C) Under the starry night sky', 'C) Mysterious', 'C) Intelligence']"

In the moonlit field, a fierce army sprouted from dragon's teeth, ready for battle. They shouted for victory, eager for bloodshed. Jason, facing the armed men, knew he couldn't fight them alone. With quick thinking, he hurled a stone, causing chaos among the warriors. They turned on each other, fighting fiercely, unaware of the stone's source. In a flash, all but one lay lifeless on the ground. The last survivor, proud in his victory cry, soon joined his fallen comrades. Princess Medea, amused by the scene, remarked on the self-conceit of the fallen warriors. She assured Jason that despite the Golden Fleece's value, having a purpose was essential.
