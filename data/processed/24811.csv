"Iceland is a small country in the cold sea far to the north. People settled there over a thousand years ago. In the warm months, they fished, made fish-oil, hunted sea-birds, gathered feathers, tended sheep, and made hay. But the winters were long, dark, and cold. Families stayed inside, carding, spinning, weaving, and knitting. Around the fire, they shared stories of kings from Norway, long voyages, and epic battles. Skilled storytellers called ""skalds"" sang sagas of Norse heroes, captivating audiences during gatherings. These tales were cherished and passed down through generations in Iceland. During midsummer meetings, skalds mesmerized crowds with songs and stories of bravery, drawing people together in awe and admiration."|['1.

Olaf and Harald trekked across a rugged, untamed land, scaling steep hills made of solid rock with sparse patches of soil. Trees clung to the cracks in the massive rocks, some of which had broken off and tumbled down the slopes. Olaf shared tales of Thor, the thunder god who wielded a mighty hammer, causing thunder, lightning, and hill fractures. Upon reaching the hilltop, they gazed at a lush green valley below, where the sea intruded, forming a dark fiord flanked by towering rock walls.

"The night my creation was complete, I joined my father's celebration. After the feast, when the mead flowed freely, I stood, lifting my cup high, and spoke boldly: ""Living at sea, where others toil for your food, is far superior. A ship smells of adventure, not smoke like a house. A house offers a view of sooty roofs; a ship, of Valhalla."" With those words, we embarked. Late that night, we docked our boat and stealthily approached the farm. It was prosperous, with stables, a storehouse, and a smithy. As we entered, the room was dimly lit, but the fire soon blazed, revealing a feast hall. The farmer, fearful, sat by the fire, while his family huddled in a corner.

One night, on a dark farm, we landed quietly. Leaving guards with our ship, we entered the house. The farmer met us but fell to Thorkel's sword. We secured the others in their beds and barred the hall doors. Amid our excitement, a sudden shout was heard outside. The king and his men had found us.

"Every day, young Harald listened to tales of war and gods until he could envision Thor amidst storm-clouds. He learned that a brave man bears many wounds but never turns his back. In his dreams, he walked into Valhalla, where heroes cheered. ""The bite of the sword is sweeter than a mother's kiss,"" he told Olaf. ""When will I stand on a dragon ship's prow and savor battle?

Harald was an eager learner. Each morning, he rose at sunrise to feed the hunting dogs with a thrall. Thorstein guided him in swimming in the fiord's rough waters. He accompanied the men on hunting trips, mastering horse riding, archery, and spear throwing. Ivar taught him to play the harp and compose songs. Harald frequented the smithy, observing warriors craft helmets, spears, and swords. Over time, he progressed from bellows operation to iron shaping, eventually creating a two-foot spearhead adorned with runes. During a snowy winter, Harald skillfully skied down mountains, felling a tree to fashion a sturdy pole. A wolf attack tested his mettle, but he swiftly defeated the predator with his spear. Undeterred by his injuries, he skillfully crafted a spear using the pole, adorning it with a gold band and decorative nails.|"[""1.

"When Harald turned ten, his father, King Halfdan, passed away. An ancient book describing Harald at that age claimed he was the ""biggest, strongest, and most handsome of all men."" Boys in those times grew rapidly, spending their days outdoors running, swimming, skiing, and hunting. Harald ordered the feast hall to be prepared for a grand event. Men arrived on horseback or by boat, having traveled long distances through rough terrain. The feast commenced at nine in the evening. The hall was adorned with bonfires casting a warm glow, pine branches scenting the air. Men filled the benches as thralls served steaming meat and ale. The hall was a spectacle, with colorful shields and gleaming spear-points adorning the walls, and guests in vibrant attire, their laughter and chatter filling the hall."|"['1.

When the food arrived, the conversation ceased. Norsemen only ate twice a day, and these men were famished after long rides. Three or four people shared a single plate and drank from a large bowl of milk. Without forks, they used their fingers to eat and tossed bones under the table. At times, they used knives from their belts to cut the meat. Later, two large tubs of mead were brought in and placed at opposite ends of the hall. The queen, dressed in blue velvet with a striped apron and a scarlet wool train, called her women to serve the mead. They filled horns and cheerfully delivered them to the guests. The feast continued joyously into the late night, with some guests retiring to the guest house or beds while others slept on the benches. The following night, at another feast, Harald, seated near the high seat, raised a horn of ale and spoke loudly. This prompted the skald to take down his harp and sing of King Halfdan's valor and legacy.|"['1.

King Harald summoned his followers, who brought in a large treasure chest and placed it near his throne. Opening it, he revealed precious gifts such as capes, sword-belts, beautiful cloth, bracelets, and gold cloak-pins. Delighted, he distributed these gifts to all present in the hall, leaving his guests in awe of his generosity. The following morning after breakfast, as the guests prepared to depart, they were each handed a horn of mead by servants. This was known as the stirrup-horn, signaling the time to mount their horses and begin their journey. Before parting ways, King Harald instructed them to deliver an arrow northward to summon all men for war preparations within two weeks. On the appointed day, the fields surrounding the king's house were filled with armed men on horseback, each displaying a unique array of weapons and armor. King Harald, adorned in chain-armor and a distinctive brass shield he crafted himself, led his army with a dragon-adorned helmet and a red cloak.|"['1.

Thorstein displayed a white shield on his spear, a symbol of peace, as he approached King Haki. He quickly shouted his message before riding back. King Harald's men observed the enemy army from a hill, witnessing King Haki's strategic orders. Twenty men rode off and began chopping hazel trees. Meanwhile, King Haki's men descended into the valley, securing the area with stakes and hazel twigs, leaving open spaces towards both armies. A warrior carrying a white shield galloped towards King Harald. Tragically, King Haki met his end in battle, causing his men to flee. King Harald's victorious army returned to camp, bringing back spoils of war. They honored the fallen soldiers by placing them on shields, adorning them with weapons, and laying them to rest on a hilltop overlooking the sea, a fitting burial site for Norsemen and Vikings. The men were given hell-shoes for their journey to Valhalla, and a mound with runic inscriptions was erected to commemorate their sacrifice.|"['1.

Gyda, a woman known for her beauty and pride, possessed exceptional skills in reading runes and knowledge of herbs for curing illnesses. When Guthorm and his men relayed King Harald's proposal to Gyda, she boldly rejected it, expressing her disdain for marrying a king ruling over scattered territories in Norway. Gyda demanded a king who could unite all of Norway under his rule. Her defiance sparked a rebellion as King Harald gathered his army to conquer the land.

"For a while, the king's hair and beard were unkempt, forming a wild tangle of yellow around his head. During a feast, Harald's uncle suggested that Harald should collect taxes and keep some for himself. Harald was also tasked with punishing wrongdoers and maintaining peace in the land. The uncle expressed relief under King Harald's rule, highlighting the peace and stability brought by the king compared to the constant turmoil caused by vikings and warring kings in the past.

However, some chiefs, like Solfi, resented King Harald for his peaceful ways. Solfi, seeking revenge for his father's death by Harald, led raids along the coast, plundering and causing chaos. The people sought help from the earls to stop Solfi, but he remained elusive. Solfi proposed a choice to his followers: submit to King Harald or fight against him.

"Many men shared Solfi's sentiments. When King Audbiorn and King Arnvid launched their war arrows, a vast army assembled. All men arrived by sea. Two hundred ships were moored in the fiord, resembling peculiar swimming creatures with their tall carved prows and vibrant paint. There were crimson and golden dragons with elongated necks and curved tails. Sea-horses emerged from the water. Green and golden serpents coiled around. Sea-hawks perched with wings outstretched, poised for flight. Amidst these curved figures rose the towering, upright masts with lengthy yardarms supporting the furled sails. As the signal horn resounded, and the sails unfurled, it was akin to the unfurling of numerous intriguing flags. Some were striped in black and yellow or blue and gold. Others bore images of a black raven, brown bear, white sea-hawk, or gold sun. A few were trimmed with fur.

King Arnvid's fleet prepared for battle, lowering their sails and masts as they drifted towards King Harald's ships. The sound of the horn signaled the warriors to their positions. With fierce determination, they gripped their swords, eyes flashing over their shields. As the ships collided, swords clashed, darts and stones flew, and arrows rained down. Men fought fiercely, hurling spears and leaping between ships. Despite injuries, the battle raged on for hours. King Harald, undeterred by wounds, continued to lead the fight, eventually emerging victorious. The defeated pledged loyalty, celebrating with feasts and oaths. Gyda, veiled in white linen, witnessed the ceremony where Eric and King Harald were honored for their bravery in battle.|['1.

Many Norsemen set sail seeking new lands. Some traveled to France, where Big Rolf-go-afoot and his men impressed the French king in battle. To secure peace, the king granted Rolf the title of duke, vast lands, and his daughter's hand in marriage. Rolf named his new land Normandy after his homeland. He ruled wisely, and his descendants became kings of England. Others ventured to Ireland, England, and Scotland, establishing themselves through conquest. The Orkneys and Shetlands, islands north of Scotland, became Viking strongholds. The Norsemen's influence spread far and wide, with their carved and painted houses dotting the landscape, their ships dominating the seas, and their warriors instilling fear in all who crossed their path.|"['1.

These warriors remembered Norway well. During summers, they returned to the land and raided its shores, seizing treasures like gold, grain, and fine fabrics. Leaving behind burning homes and sorrowful women, they provoked King Harald to chase them with his fleet. The rugged Norwegian islands provided hiding spots for the raiders, but Harald tirelessly pursued them, scouring every nook and cranny. Despite capturing some, many vikings eluded him, returning each summer to repeat their daring exploits. Determined, Harald assembled a formidable fleet and valiant fighters to confront the vikings in their own settlements. Battles ensued, leaving scars on ships and warriors alike. Eventually, Harald emerged victorious, compelling the remaining vikings to swear allegiance. As peace settled, tales of Harald's reign likened him to a mighty tree, symbolizing his dominion over Norway and beyond, with his descendants destined to rule for generations. Amidst a somber gathering at Ingolf's hall, the mood turned serious as Ingolf brooded by the fire, his thoughts consumed by the challenges ahead.|"['1.

Once the preparations were complete, they stored essential supplies like axes, hammers, fish-nets, cooking-kettles, kegs of ale, chests of hard bread, chests of smoked meat, brass kettles full of flour, and skin bottles of water on the ship. They also brought four head of cattle on board. Understanding the limited space and provisions, the leader planned carefully for the journey, ensuring there was enough food and drink for at least six months. With only enough room for essential crew members, they set sail with thirty oars and one man per oar, with the leader and Leif steering. After a brief rest at the Shetland man's house, they resumed their journey. Despite facing challenges like a crew member falling overboard and rough seas breaking oars, they persevered without fear. Eventually, they spotted an island but found it difficult to land due to its rocky and steep terrain.

Men stood on the flat island, lowering a boat down the steep side with ropes. Once it hit the water, they secured a rope to the rock, slid down into the ship, and sailed away, leaving the desolate sea surrounding them. The sea varied from smooth and shining to turbulent with gray skies and rain. Lost in a fog for three days, they finally saw a white cloud in the distance. Sailing towards it, they discovered a black, hilly shore with a blue ice mountain. They docked in a harbor with a green valley, settling in a stone and turf hut as winter approached. Ingolf and his men explored the land, fishing and sailing along the shore. They lived mostly outdoors by a bonfire, keeping warm and clean. Leif remarked on their simple lifestyle.|['1.

"""This land is truly amazing,"" Ingolf exclaimed. ""It's a mix of Niflheim and Asgard. Here, you find lush greenery, a gentle cradle for humans. Yet, just a stone's throw away, there's an icy mountain where one could freeze. And nearby, a rocky hill, as if forged in fire. Yesterday, I stumbled upon a cave by the sea, its entrance fit for a giant, waves crashing at its doorstep. A thunderous roar echoed from within; I suspect a giant resides there. Giants of fire and frost must have shaped this island. I've seen basins in rocks filled with warm water, resembling giant bathtubs. Boiling water spurts from the ground, and I've felt the earth rumble beneath me, as if a slumbering giant stirs. Once, atop a mountain, I gazed upon a barren desert of sand and rock, whipped by fierce winds. Despite such harsh landscapes, I recall the beauty of warm valleys, envisioning flowers, grazing cattle, and a bountiful sea. These thoughts transform this land into the sweetest home on earth. I've decided to settle here. What say you, friends?"" Leif replied, ""I've pledged to follow you, my brother. This land captivates me.

Leif told Ingolf to return home and bring back their women and belongings. He planned to sail to Ireland for some fun before retiring from battles. Leif promised to return with a ship full of treasures at no cost. As they noticed the glint of Valkyrias' armor, signifying a battle nearby, Ingolf's men began preparing for the journey. They cut down trees, built a new ship, planted crops, and crafted tools. The women wove new clothes as Ingolf sold his possessions. Two years later, Leif returned with thralls and chests filled with treasures. Ingolf and his men then honored Odin by sacrificing horses and sprinkling blood on wooden statues in a temple.

He placed his hand on a tall post next to the raised seat, one on each side. These were the chair's front posts, reaching almost to the ceiling, intricately carved and painted with figures of men and dragons. Atop each post sat a small statue of Thor wielding his hammer. Cattle, sheep, horses, and pigs stood on these posts, while rowers' benches lined the sides. In the stern of each boat was a small cabin for women and children to sleep, with men resting on the central timbers. As the boats set sail for Iceland, tears filled the women's eyes as they bid farewell to Norway. The journey was long, with storms and fog, until they finally spotted land. Ingolf tossed his seat pillars overboard, which were lost in a storm.|"[""1.

The following day, the storm had calmed, and Ingolf docked at a favorable harbor. A tall rocky promontory jutted into the sea, with a wide bay flanked by islands. Beyond the rocky point lay a flat green expanse, with distant shimmering ice-covered mountains. Ingolf's wife reminisced about a joyous Yule feast with friends, contrasted with their current dreary surroundings. Ingolf longed for his foster-brother's laughter and remembered their shared promises.

They loaded supplies onto the boat and set sail until they spotted Leif's homes along the harbor. Upon arrival, they found Leif and his companions dead, stripped of their weapons. Ingolf searched the houses, calling out, but no one responded. The storehouse was bare, and the luxurious decorations were missing. Even the stables were empty, and the boat had vanished. Ingolf mourned the loss of his brave friend, attributing it to not honoring the gods. Despite their differences, Ingolf honored his promise, leaving his spears and drinking horn as a tribute to Leif. They built a mound for the fallen and set sail for the islands Ingolf had seen. Upon reaching one, they discovered the thralls feasting, with Helga and the women frightened nearby.|"[""1.

In spring, Leif decided to plant wheat with his one remaining ox. His other oxen had died in the harsh winter. Leif enlisted the help of his thralls to plow the fields. Despite their hesitant expressions, Leif remained unfazed and even chuckled. When questioned, the thralls explained a bear had attacked the ox but they had scared it off. Leif, undeterred, armed his men with spears to confront the bear in the woods. Meanwhile, the thralls seized the opportunity to ambush and kill Leif and his men, plundering their home and fleeing by boat. Ingolf, shocked by the betrayal, lamented the loss of his brother and the legacy they could have built together. The next day, they packed all belongings onto two ships and sailed to Leif's residence, where they resided for a year. Despite unsuccessful wheat planting, they eventually found the pillars they sought after sailing west along the coast.

Ingolf's buildings were topped with turf, resembling green mounds with vibrant carved walls. He constructed a temple adorned with beautiful carvings and placed the statues from his old temple inside. Additionally, he erected the pillars of his high seat that had been drifting for some time. Underneath, he laid the soil of Norway from a small bronze chest. Ingolf expressed his desire to see sails in the harbor, yearning for new faces and news from Norway. When a ship's prow washed ashore, the Icelanders welcomed the newcomers with tears of joy, fearing the growing power of Harald in Norway.

When Ingolf, an elderly man, passed away, his men honored him in a grand way. They adorned his ship, once a dragon, with fresh paint and gold. They placed him on the deck, surrounded by his sword, spear, and mead-horn. A treasure chest filled with riches, along with weapons, saddles, and bridles, was placed aboard. Horses, hunting dogs, and a mound of earth were also included, signifying his wealth and bravery. The ship was buried under a hill, marking the grave of a great man.

In a grand Norseman's abode stood a variety of structures. The most impressive and spacious was the grand banquet hall. Following that were the bower where women crafted, and the guest lodge for visitors' rest. Additionally, there were storage facilities, stables, workshops, a kitchen, and a dwelling for servants. These edifices were constructed from sturdy, chiseled logs, coated with tar to seal gaps and preserve the wood. The extremities of the logs, the door frames, and the apexes of gables were adorned with carvings of people and creatures, painted in vivid hues. These vibrant structures were clustered closely together, often arranged around a square courtyard. This courtyard bustled with activity, as individuals moved between the colorful buildings. Sometimes, a tall fence with a sole entrance enclosed the area, concealing the lively scene within.|"[""1.

"In ancient Norse culture, people believed having two names brought good luck and long life. Names often reflected qualities like ""Thorstein"" meaning Thor's stone or ""Gudbrand"" meaning Gunnr's sword. To distinguish between people with the same name, nicknames like ""Haki the Black"" or ""Haki the Ship-chested"" were given. These nicknames were sometimes just for fun. Men were proud of their drinking-horns, which were made of cattle horns adorned with gold or silver. During meals, long narrow tables were set up in feast halls, and thralls served from the middle.

In the Norse feast hall, there were special beds called shut-beds. These beds were like big boxes with doors that opened into the hall. Inside, there was straw on the floor with blankets. People would get into these beds, close the doors, and shut themselves in for the night. Olaf's men could have blocked the doors with heavy things to keep people inside. The feast hall itself was long and narrow with fires burning in the middle on flat stones. Smoke would escape through holes in the roof called wind's-eyes covered with oiled skin. Norse children were sent away to foster-fathers to grow up and learn. They would make a vow under an arch made of turf strips and a spear, pledging to be like brothers for life.|"['1.

"**Norse Mythology Tales**

In Norse mythology, **Ran** was the wife of Aegir, the god of the sea. They resided in a cave beneath the ocean where Ran used her vast net to capture shipwrecked men and treasures lost at sea. The cave gleamed with the riches she had collected.

**Valkyries**, the maidens of Odin, served in Valhalla but also observed battles from the skies. Warriors who showed valor were chosen to join Odin in Valhalla. Descriptions of Valkyries depict them with lightning, clad in bloody mail shirts, riding through the air and ocean.

**Odin's Ravens** aided him in overseeing the world. These ravens would fly out each day, returning in the evening to whisper all they had seen and heard. This is how Odin gained knowledge of many things.

**Reykjavik**, meaning ""smoky sea,"" was named by Ingolf due to the hot springs by the sea. It has since grown into a city and serves as the capital of Iceland.

**Peace-bands** were white bands Norsemen used to tie their swords in a scabbard during peaceful errands. If conflict arose, they would break the bands to draw their swords.

**Eskimos** lived in Greenland, Alaska, and northern Canada. They were pushed north by other tribes seeking their lands, eventually settling in Greenland. The timing of these events in relation to Eric's discoveries remains debated"|"[""1.
