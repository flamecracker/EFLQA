Sandy Chipmunk was always on the move, too busy to explain why he was called Sandy. Known for his hard work and play, Sandy dashed past Jimmy and his pals in the pasture with his cheeks full of nuts. Ignoring their calls, Sandy flicked his tail, unable to speak with his mouth stuffed. Frisky thought his name meant plucky, but Tommy Fox knew it came from Alexander. Mr. Crow found it amusing how everyone tried to guess the reason for Sandy's name. In the end, Sandy revealed that they were all right, leaving Mr. Crow with a playful jest.|"['1.

Sandy Chipmunk's mother started teaching him self-care from a young age. She warned him about foxes, minks, and especially weasels. While playing outside, Sandy couldn't relax, constantly checking for predators. Despite his fears, nothing happened until one afternoon when he saw a strange creature in the sky. It had big eyes, a wide mouth, and a long tail that frightened him. However, his mother explained it was just a kite made by Johnnie Green. Sandy's diet mainly consisted of nuts, grains, berries, apples, pears, tomatoes, sunflower seeds, and sometimes insects. But there was a special treat he sought in trees, which he enjoyed after a successful hunt and always cleaned up afterward.|"[""1.

Sandy Chipmunk loved to eat birds' eggs, but he had to be sneaky about it because he didn't want his mother to find out. Despite her warnings, Sandy couldn't resist the tasty treats. As spring arrived, the birds in Farmer Green's pasture caught on to Sandy's egg-stealing ways and grew angry with him. One day, while attempting to pilfer eggs from a robin's nest, Sandy was caught red-handed by the angry birds. Startled, Sandy was glad to escape unharmed, realizing he didn't have to hide his mischievous meal from his mother this time. Feeling independent, Sandy decided it was time to build his own house in a prime location among the beech trees, where he could easily keep an eye out for any potential threats.|"[""1.

Sandy Chipmunk carefully removed his coat and tie before starting to dig his new home. He worked diligently, making the earth fly as he dug beneath the beech trees. By nightfall, there was a large heap of dirt and a sizable hole in the pasture to show his progress. Despite facing challenges like pushing stones out with his nose, Sandy persevered. He ensured to keep his tunnel clean by pushing the dirt and stones out of his doorway. Sandy was meticulous, always kicking the debris away from his burrow. Even after creating a sleeping chamber and storing winter food, Sandy wasn't done yet. There was still more he wanted to add to his cozy abode.|"['1.

Sandy Chipmunk had a cozy chamber underground, but he wasn't satisfied with the messy outside. He dug two neat doorways to keep safe from enemies. Sandy was careful not to leave a trail to his doors to avoid being discovered. Inside, he made a soft bed with dry leaves and stored nuts, grain, sunflower seeds, and wild-cherry pits for the winter.

Sandy Chipmunk was known for his impressive self-control. Despite loving sunflower seeds and other tasty treats, he never indulged in a single nut or grain while gathering food for the winter. His mother had always emphasized the importance of self-control for surviving the winter, and Sandy took her advice to heart. When his mother visited his new home, she was delighted to see his neatly made bed and a storeroom full of food. Sandy's stash of nuts and grain even caught the attention of some forest creatures, like Uncle Sammy Coon, who hatched a plan to steal from him. Uncle Sammy's scheme involved pretending to inspect Sandy's grain, but Sandy saw through his trickery and stood his ground, not falling for Uncle Sammy's attempts to take advantage of him.|"['1.

Sandy Chipmunk happily ate the corn he found under Uncle Sammy's table. Uncle Sammy, a new storekeeper, was unaware of all the items on his shelves. While Uncle Sammy was distracted, Sandy slyly took an ear of corn from a basket. Uncle Sammy, puzzled by the missing corn, suspected Sandy but dismissed the idea due to his small size. Meanwhile, Old Mr. Crow decided not to migrate for winter, citing his age and the forecasted mild weather. Frisky Squirrel and Sandy worked together to gather food for the upcoming winter, with Frisky waiting at the elm tree for Sandy's deliveries.|"[""1.

Sandy Chipmunk thought the deal was fair. Every time he visited the elm tree, he only took what he could carry in his cheek-pouch. He hurried home to store his share before gathering more. Mr. Crow, pleased with the arrangement, believed his winter food was secure. He was content, thinking he wouldn't have to pay Sandy for his work. However, Sandy realized he was essentially paying himself by working for Mr. Crow. The crow wanted corn, not nuts, which Sandy had been collecting. Despite the mix-up, Mr. Crow instructed Sandy to gather corn the next day and pay Frisky Squirrel with his own share. One day near Farmer Green's house, Sandy found a mysterious box on an oak tree, but he was cautious and didn't open it for fear it could be a trap.|"['1.

Mr. Crow heard a story that grew as it spread. Farmer Green set up what was thought to be a trap on a tree, but Mr. Crow revealed it was a mailbox for letters and newspapers. Jasper Jay spread the tale, leading Sandy Chipmunk to believe a man with a wagon of twelve horses left massive loads of mail in the box daily. Sandy climbed the tree to see the man drop a few letters and newspapers with only one horse and a small bag of mail. Disappointed but curious, Sandy found the box open and crawled inside.

Sandy, a chipmunk who couldn't read, found an envelope with a chipmunk picture and thought it was his. He surprised Farmer Green by carrying a letter in his mouth. Farmer Green was puzzled and thought it was a letter theft. Later, Farmer Green learned about letters in the village warning about a new poison for chipmunks and squirrels. He realized Sandy took one of those letters. Farmer Green's family found it amusing. Another story involved Sandy sneaking into a wheat bag on Farmer Green's wagon. This led to an unexpected adventure to the miller's.|"['1. What did Sandy find in the envelope?\nA) A chipmunk picture\nB) A letter\nC) A new poison\nD) A warning\nE) A wheat bag', ""2.

Sandy Chipmunk skipped breakfast and feasted on wheat kernels, planning to stash some for later. Lost in his meal, he didn't notice Farmer Green sealing him in a bag. Startled, Sandy shivered as the wagon set off to the mill. Inside, frightened Sandy overheard Johnnie Green's family chatter. The journey was bumpy, with Sandy too scared to chew his way out. Despite the chaos, the old horse, Ebenezer, calmly navigated the steep hill, unfazed by the commotion. Johnnie's attempts to halt the horse were futile. Eventually, Ebenezer safely reached the bottom, proving his experience trumped Johnnie's commands.|"['1.

Johnnie searched his pockets but couldn't find any string. Instead, he found a variety of items like a jackknife, nails, an apple, maple sugar, a broken watch, and a willow whistle. Remembering the string his father used for the wheat sack, Johnnie unwound it and freed Sandy the chipmunk. Sandy, though lost, was happy to escape. Meanwhile, the boastful Rowdy Red-Squirrel bragged about his fighting skills to Jasper Jay, who found it amusing.

Jasper challenged Rowdy to prove he could defeat Sandy Chipmunk before claiming to beat six others. Unaware of the impending fight, Sandy was surprised by Rowdy's attack. Despite being a ground-squirrel, Sandy bravely fought back as Rowdy leaped at him. Sandy's climbing skills helped him escape and pursue Rowdy along a stone wall.

Rowdy accused Jasper Jay of playing a prank on him, claiming there were six hidden chipmunks waiting to startle him. To Rowdy's surprise, there were actually seven chipmunks, including Sandy Chipmunk. It was spring, and Sandy was struggling to find food in Pleasant Valley as it was too early for fruits, nuts, and insects. Spotting Mr. Crow in a rush, Sandy remembered Farmer Green was planting corn, and Mr. Crow was likely headed there. Mr. Crow beat Sandy to the cornfield and began feasting on the kernels. To his surprise, he found Sandy also enjoying the corn.

Mr. Crow was annoyed by Sandy Chipmunk following him everywhere, even to the corn-patch where Sandy started eating the corn. The cat was furious because Sandy drank her breakfast, so she waited for him to come out of his hole. Sandy then ran off to the cows, asking for milk. The cows, except for a grumpy one, couldn't help. Henry Skunk advised Sandy to go to the barnyard later for milk. Sandy waited until the afternoon to visit the barn, expecting saucers of milk but found the cows being milked instead. Sandy was clueless about milking and the process happening in front of him.|['1.
