I could endure her words, but the moment she laid a hand on you, I couldn't bear it, Flora."" ""I can handle things, dear Flora. I'm strong and resilient; I can endure almost anything,"" I assured her, embracing her once more, feeling she was the only one who truly cared for me.

I was forced to obey everyone in the house, even Ham, the captain's spoiled son. Within a year, life became unbearable due to the family's mistreatment. I was overworked, insulted, and mistreated. I endured it until poor Flora suffered. Clarence, my brother, promised to visit us soon. However, things worsened despite my complaints. Anticipating the arrival of Captain Fishley, I prepared to stand up for us. With an iron poker in hand, I shielded Flora from harm. Despite feeling provoked, I remained calm, recalling my father's lesson on controlling emotions in times of crisis. His guidance helped us successfully combat a fire once. The importance of composure in the face of danger was ingrained in me, ensuring I was prepared for the challenges ahead.|"['1.

I don't want to say that I never got angry, but I made sure to stay calm and collected to avoid making mistakes. On this particular day, I was prepared for the angry outburst of the tyrants. They stormed into the kitchen, furious, but I stood my ground. Captain Fishley and his wife were shocked by my composed demeanor.

He appeared embarrassed and stepped back as I moved forward. The black horse suddenly started, causing me to briefly leave to fix the reins tangled under his feet. Upon returning, I noticed my attacker holding a club. I had a special fondness for my black horse, Darky, and my dog, Bully. Although I cherished both, I had a particular affinity for horses and enjoyed caring for them. Despite my belief in discipline, I never used the whip on Darky. When faced with Ham wielding a club, I had to defend myself. I seized the elegant whip from the wagon, realizing it was better suited for protection. Despite not being inclined towards fighting, I had to stand up against Ham's aggression. I skillfully used the whip to keep him at bay, avoiding his attempts to strike me.|"['1.

He fought hard to gain the upper hand, but I remained calm and kept my distance, using the whip swiftly to defend myself. Eventually, his patience wore thin, and in frustration, he raised a club towards me. The blow landed on my shoulder, leaving me in pain for weeks. Despite this, I didn't show any weakness and disarmed him. I continued to crack the whip near him, making him jump around like a dancer. I warned him to behave better in the future and offered to help him out. As we drove away, I expressed regret for the altercation and hoped he wouldn't repeat his actions.

Our arrival at Crofton's cut short our conversation. Ham jumped out of the wagon, dashed through the gate, and vanished. I continued towards Riverport, hoping Ham would let go of his grudge. Yet, his father's shady dealings and Ham's bragging about tricking customers painted a grim picture. As I reached Riverport, lingering unease about the future haunted me. Later, at the hotel, I learned Squire Fishley, known for his moral standing, was inebriated. Despite his reputation, his drunken state shocked me.

The steamer's bell rang urgently, signaling the start, and I worried that the passenger's loyalty to his friends might lead him to join them down the river. Rushing to the cabin, I found him bidding farewell with a final drink. I hurriedly informed him of the boat's departure. He bid his companions goodbye and followed me to the gangplank. As I stepped onto the shore, a splash echoed behind me. Glancing back, I saw Squire Fishley fall into the river. Acting swiftly, I released a floating log to rescue him. We drifted downstream, unseen in the darkness. Shouts from distant boats guided us towards the shore.

The gentleman, known as Squire Fishley, faced a bitter cold that left him shivering. Advised to warm up, he took a walk to invigorate his blood. Yet, the icy weather was not his sole concern. Remorse and dread of being found out troubled him more. Being a stranger in Riverport, he felt reassured that his identity as the person who had fallen into the river was unknown.

Ham arrived just before breakfast, looking tired and guilty. The senator said grace, a rare event in the house, while casting uneasy glances. Mrs. Fishley mentioned the pleasant weather. In the store, I found the remains of a burnt letter Ham had destroyed. Miss Larrabee arrived looking for a letter that did not arrive. Ham, whistling Yankee Doodle, searched for it but couldn't find it. Captain Fishley also searched but to no avail. Miss Larrabee was upset as she had plans to visit Jim's family but couldn't without the letter.|"['1.

At a critical moment, Squire Fishley stepped in and proposed lending the lady enough money for her journey. Delighted, Miss Larrabee agreed, promising to repay upon her return. As she signed the note and counted the money, she was filled with joy knowing her journey was assured. Meanwhile, I observed Ham closely after the squire and his father left, noticing his deceptive behavior. Despite my discomfort, I remained silent. Suddenly, Ham struck me from behind, leaving painful marks. Enraged, I lunged at him, but he defended himself with a cowhide. In pain, I retreated to the barn to nurse my anger. Feeling unwelcome and mistreated, I contemplated leaving Torrentville with my sister before Clarence's arrival. If not for Flora, I would have left immediately.|"['1.

I couldn't stay in the barn for long without getting into trouble, as the captain wanted me to harness the horse, indicating that he and the squire were planning to ride. I was feeling defiant and decided to break free from their authority. I fed Darky, the horse, and then left without a clear destination in mind. I ended up near a deep stream that led into a swamp, a desolate and gloomy place. I often explored this swamp, having previously navigated it on a raft with a friend. As I sat on a pile of lumber by the swollen creek, I reflected on the injustices I had faced, likening my defiance to a log caught in the stream of life. Despite the risks, I felt justified in standing up for myself and my sister, realizing that I was the only one who could fight our battles.|['1.

That pine stick appeared like a bad influence, drawing other vices and sins towards it. Just as one wrong choice can lead to more, like the first drink or the initial step into crime. I pondered clearing the heap to prevent the river from clogging, akin to how removing the first log of intemperance changed a man for the better. As I prepared to act, a voice interrupted, calling my name. It was Sim Gwynn, a peculiar character from the swamp, who seemed distressed. He shared a tale of hunger and mistreatment by the stingy Barkspear family. Overwhelmed, he sobbed, seeking solace in my company.

Sim Gwynn was starving, a dire situation for him due to his rapid growth and huge appetite. Feeling sorry for him, I hurried home to fetch food to ease his suffering. Finding the house empty except for Flora, I gathered a generous amount of cooked provisions, including ham, corned beef, biscuits, crackers, and bread. Laden with food, I returned to the swamp where Sim eagerly awaited. Without interrupting his meal, I watched from a distance as he devoured the feast. As he ate, I reflected on my situation, feeling that I couldn't stay in Torrentville much longer. Dreaming of a river trip and recalling the joy my brother's plans for a voyage to New Orleans brought me, I realized my love for river scenery and the pleasure my raft had given me on the swamp waters.|"[""1.

Sim Gwynn's decision to leave his unpleasant situation made me ponder my own desire to do the same. With some money in hand, I considered taking my sister to New Orleans. However, lacking enough for the fare and facing restrictions from Captain Fishley, I felt stuck. Still, the idea of building a raft to escape with my sister excited me. I shared the plan with Sim, who eagerly agreed to help in exchange for provisions. Gathering necessary tools, I left him to start the construction. Back at the house, I confided in Flora about the mistreatment I endured. When the wagon arrived, I avoided confrontation with Captain Fishley. After buying supplies, I headed back to the swamp to begin our daring adventure.|"[""1.

I met Sim Gwynn by the swamp, where he could hide with his boat. He had an axe from Squire Mosely, a gift for saving a cow. Sim was content with the axe, and we began building a raft by the creek. We worked together, using logs and slabs to construct a solid platform. Sim provided materials as I nailed the slabs down. As the day progressed, I ran out of nails and had to return home. I left Sim working on the raft and went back to the house. The squire and Mrs. Fishley were occupied with a guest, so I was safe for the moment.

After three days of hard work, we finished building the raft's body. We covered the long logs with shorter ones and added a flooring of slabs on the upper tier. The platform stood over a foot above the water, sturdy and ready to keep us dry. Now, it was time to construct the house, the most challenging yet rewarding part of our project. The house was to be eighteen feet long and six feet wide, placed in the middle of the platform. I crafted frames for the sills and plates, boarded them up and down, and added windows and a door. As we neared completion, a shortage of boards threatened our progress. However, a stroke of luck brought down extra boards in a rainstorm, which we caught with a boom. Unfortunately, a mishap occurred when my companion, Sim, slipped and fell into the water.

Frantically, I attempted to shake him off. The harder I struggled, the tighter he clung, fearing my escape. I thought it was the end, my mind racing with thoughts of Flora. I prayed for forgiveness, feeling overwhelmed by my sins. Just as I felt myself giving in, I made one last effort to survive. Exhausted, I grabbed onto a log, barely holding on.

I pulled down the log to slow it in the swift current, nearly getting dragged myself. By wrapping my legs around it, I managed to stop its movement and pull it to shore. I convinced Sim to crawl along the log to safety after passing the swamp's deepest part. Together, we hauled the log out of the water. Grateful for our survival, I prayed for the first time, feeling a newfound sense of gratitude and a desire to be better. Sim, too, prayed sincerely, mirroring my sentiments.

I sensed the storm brewing, feeling the pressure closing in like a fierce tempest. Those in power were eager to accuse me. Ham, devoid of fairness or kindness, would stop at nothing to incriminate me to save himself. It was clear that without Squire Fishley's testimony, I had no chance of being cleared. Ham, a villain, knew I was innocent of the theft. Though I understood Captain Fishley and his wife suspecting me, I couldn't betray Squire Fishley. Despite having the raft ready for Flora, I doubted she'd join me. With my hands tied by my secret, I contemplated fleeing to avoid facing those who wished my downfall. Convincing Flora to leave Torrentville with me, I saw no other option but to embark on a new adventure.|['1.

We decided to leave immediately on a raft, away from Torrentville, to escape Captain Fishley. I quickly made arrangements to take Flora and her belongings. With three hours before Captain Fishley's return, I gathered Flora's things and headed to the swamp. Despite missing some items, we loaded the wheelbarrow with as much as we could. Sim joined me in the plan. We worked discreetly in the rear of the house, out of sight. I planned to bring Bully, but he was missing. We aimed to make a swift escape before anyone noticed.|"[""1.

The initial steps are always captivating, especially for those taking them. Looking back, the moment we set off from the back of the barn stands out as the most thrilling in my life, except for the time I struggled with Sim Gwynn in the water. Leaving my long-time home behind, we embarked on a peculiar journey down the river on a raft. The emotions were unforgettable. Sim led with a wheelbarrow full of essentials, while I followed with Flora's wagon. Flora, my sister, remained cheerful, untroubled by any fear. After unloading, we boarded the raft, and I secured it before helping Flora settle in. As we glided through the swamp, Flora, now up and about, found comfort by the fire in her cozy room. It was a satisfying end to our preparations for the new adventure.|"[""1.

By nine o'clock, I finished my sister's room, but she refused to go to bed. Worried she might catch a cold, we sat talking in her warm room, more at risk from lack of fresh air than the night chill. As we chatted, I planned our upcoming voyage. When I realized the raft had drifted off without me, panic set in. I hurried to retrieve my money, delaying my pursuit. Pushing off on a small raft, I struggled to navigate the swift current, unable to find my companions. Despite my fears, I remained hopeful, believing they would be safe around the next bend. As I strained to peer through the darkness, my heart raced with anticipation, hoping to reunite with them soon.|"[""Question 1: What did the speaker finish by nine o'clock?\nA) Talking with their sister\nB) Retrieving money\nC) Navigating the swift current\nD) Planning a voyage\nE) Catching a cold"", 'Question 2: Why did the speaker worry about their sister catching a cold?\nA) Lack of fresh air in the room\nB) Drifting off on a raft\nC) Delaying pursuit to retrieve money\nD) Struggling to navigate the swift current\nE) Talking until late at night', 'Question 3: What caused panic in the speaker?\nA) Realizing the raft had drifted off\nB) Planning the upcoming voyage\nC) Struggling to navigate the swift current\nD) Retrieving money\nE) Finding companions around the next bend', 'Question 4: Why did the speaker delay their pursuit?\nA) To navigate the swift current\nB) To find companions around the next bend\nC) To retrieve money\nD) To catch a cold\nE) To talk with their sister', 'Question 5: What emotion did the speaker feel while hoping to reunite with their companions?\nA) Fear\nB) Panic\nC) Hopeful\nD) Anticipation\nE) Worried', ""Question 6: What was the speaker's attitude towards the situation?\nA) Pessimistic\nB) Optimistic\nC) Indifferent\nD) Anxious\nE) Sad""]"|['D) Planning a voyage', 'A) Lack of fresh air in the room', 'A) Realizing the raft had drifted off', 'C) To retrieve money', 'C) Hopeful', 'B) Optimistic']
With the board I had taken from my raft, I paddled with all my strength. It felt like an eternity as I worried about my friends before I reached the bend. The stream sharply turned, and I saw the light on the raft, bringing relief. The current guided me towards it, and I steered with my paddle to keep it steady. As I got closer, I noticed Sim wasn't there to greet me. Concerned, I hurried inside to find Flora safe and calm. Sim was content beside her. We prepared to set off again, thankful for the money we had. After freeing the raft from a tree root, we continued our journey.

As we neared Riverport, the clock struck one. Flora, still in her chair, asked how I could steer the raft and had many questions. She wanted to stay up until we reached the Wisconsin River. Excited, we didn't feel tired. Sim had lunch and felt great, enjoying every moment. Flora liked it but thought it would be nicer in the daytime. As we entered the Wisconsin River, I pointed out Riverport to Flora. She went to bed, and I knew she prayed for me. We were now on the broad river, smaller than the Mississippi we would see. Sim, forward, watched the shores. It was quiet, and I felt the weight of navigating the raft. Sim joined me, and I kept him busy to avoid boredom. After some practice, Sim got the hang of steering. He soon went to bed, ready for the hard work ahead.|"['1.

I stayed up all night, keeping watch on the raft while my friends slept. As morning arrived, the sunlight and the songs of birds greeted me. Despite feeling tired, I let my companions rest. Flora woke up feeling refreshed, and Sim, who would have slept till noon, finally rose after a long slumber. We had a makeshift breakfast without a table or enough chairs. After steering for a while, I took a nap, and my friends allowed me to rest until the afternoon. We encountered various boats on the river without drawing much attention. By evening, I planned shifts for steering during the night. As we entered the Mississippi River, the current grew stronger. I took the helm again while Sim kept watch. Despite some doubts, Sim managed to stay awake and woke me at sunrise, reporting a near encounter with a steamboat during the night.|['1.

I didn't plan to write about our daily journey down the river. Each day seemed much like the next, and all were the same. On the first afternoon on the Mississippi, we neared a village with a steamboat landing. Needing supplies, I tried to stop, but the raft was used to moving forward. We passed the village due to deep water, missing out on milk for my coffee. Later, we reached a larger village. There, I bought a clock, a sail, groceries, and provisions. I rigged the sail and improved our living space. With the sail up, we sailed faster, steering better and saving time by taking shortcuts. Sim and I shared steering duties, using the sail when the wind was right, making our journey easier and more comfortable.|"['1.

"Almost every day we landed in a town during our river journey. On Sundays, we would stop and attend church if possible. One rainy day, we moored by a riverbank. The rain made it uncomfortable to steer the raft, so Sim and I rested while Flora read. I had set up the house on the raft to my liking. In one town, I bought a ""Panorama of the Mississippi River,"" a chart showing towns, streams, and distances. As we reached the Missouri River's mouth, the vastness of the water amazed us. St. Louis, a bustling city, left us in awe. We marveled at the steamboats and flat-boats passing by.

As we observed the steamboats speeding down the river, disaster struck when one of them exploded, sending debris flying through the air. The violent blast shook our raft, causing chaos. Quickly, I abandoned the steering oar to help Sim as the raft spun in the strong current. We hoisted the sail and adjusted the ropes to navigate upstream. Despite our efforts, we struggled against the river's force. Meanwhile, the wreckage from the steamboat floated downstream. Spotting a person in need of rescue, we attempted to reach them but faced challenges due to the distance and the raft's movement. After failed attempts, we secured a long rope to aid in the rescue mission.|"['1.

I was a strong swimmer and felt confident in my abilities to help the person in danger. The Mississippi River's swift current made it a tough swim, but I managed to reach the girl in need. She clung to a stick for support, shivering from fear and cold. I held onto her and the stick while my friend, Sim, tried to pull us to safety.

Flora and I discussed our plan, deciding to remove her wet clothes. I carried her to my sister's room and laid her on a blanket. After closing the shutters and stoking the fire, I left Flora to rest. The stove would warm the house like an oven with the windows shut. Sim asked many questions, testing my patience. Eager to know more about the young lady, I awaited Flora's report. As darkness fell, I paced the raft to keep warm in my wet clothes. I joined Flora in her room, where I saw the stranger's pretty face. She shared a harrowing tale of being thrown into the river. Overwhelmed, she sobbed as I promised to help find her mother. After changing clothes and securing the raft, I sought a way to reach Cairo.

My report was accurate, and I faced a barrage of questions from concerned passengers about the ill-fated steamer. I could only confirm that the boat had been destroyed but that rescue efforts were underway. Soon after, the news was validated upon the steamer's arrival at Cairo. The survivors were aboard the River Queen No. 4, now functioning as a makeshift hospital. The grim sight of casualties and the anguish of the injured filled the air. Among the deceased were Mrs. Goodridge and Mr. Spear. I ensured one survivor's name was moved to the list of the living.

I informed Emily about the plan to send her to New Orleans on the next available steamer heading there. Surprisingly, she strongly objected, stating that she wouldn't leave Flora, whom she considered an angel. Emily preferred staying on the raft, feeling happier there than on a steamboat.

Despite the patient's slow recovery, Flora tirelessly cared for her.

When Emily and Flora were in the chamber, Sim and I secured the raft to a post. Sim was amazed by the sights around us. Leaving him to marvel, I went inside. Emily appeared frail, hinting at being close to her heavenly home. With Emily in need of new clothes, we found a carriage. Her worn appearance drew little notice in the dim light. I couldn't let her go alone, so Flora accompanied her. I left Sim in charge of the raft, promising a swift return. The carriage took us to Emily's mansion, where servants buzzed at her arrival. Her father, expected momentarily, wasn't home. Emily, tearful, revisited memories of her mother. Her father's arrival brought calm tears. I shared our journey with him, and he graciously arranged for the raft's safety. After a trip back, Mr. Goodridge wanted to know more about our story.|"['1.

""I don't blame you for leaving them,"" Clarence admitted. ""I regret not acting sooner after you complained, but I was tied up with work. However, leaving with a tarnished reputation is unacceptable. We must act promptly. I won't let them think you're guilty unless proven. If you are guilty, you are not my brother."" Clarence arranged for Flora's belongings to be moved to his new home and sold the raft from our 1750-mile journey, giving me the proceeds. We returned to Mr. Goodridge's house in the afternoon.

After leaving Torrentville, I found myself on a steamer headed to St. Louis. The journey was enjoyable, and I pointed out sights to my companions, including Emily, who was initially nervous but gained confidence. Arriving in Riverport, I dreaded facing my accusers back in Torrentville. I had written to Squire Fishley about the mail robbery accusations and promised to keep his secret, even if it meant going to jail. A letter from the senator assured me of his support and praised my loyalty. Excited for his arrival, I confided in Clarence about the mysterious benefactor.

I did not respond to the question and quietly left without saying anything. People in Torrentville believed I was the mail thief who had fled to avoid punishment. This troubled me, but redemption was near. I was uneasy that the postmaster had informed my enemies in Riverport about my presence before my crucial witness arrived. To avoid trouble, I decided to lay low. Squire Fishley didn't show up on the second day, causing me anxiety about being caught. I rented a beautiful boat for a day trip with Emily and Flora.

"Before I could speak further, my rough captors, with much commotion and force, pulled me towards the wagon on the road where Captain Fishley sat. I trusted that Sim, once he regained consciousness, could safely guide the boat back to the hotel, so I wasn't concerned about my friends. ""This guy is a wicked scoundrel,"" remarked the postmaster to a stranger, later revealed as a post-office agent or detective. ""This boy has been part of my family for years, yet he tries to blame my son for his crime."" I emptied my pockets, revealing all my money in a new wallet I got in New Orleans, while my old one with a burnt envelope was in my bag at the hotel.
