Lieutenant Cantor will deceive the others while the two launches are being lowered. Ensigns Darrin and Dalzell will then return and report to Lieutenant Cantor.

Just before the house, there was a row of beautiful tropical hedges. Darrin saw this and was about to enter through an opening in the hedge when a person suddenly appeared in the darkness in front of him. Coxswain Riley, sensing trouble from behind, quickly led his men in a fast run towards the area. In a short while, the sentry, likely very frightened, was silenced and tied up securely. With a gesture to his crew, Darrin led the way inside. Immediately, the seven men in the room stood up, staring in shock at the intruders. Despite one man making a move towards a stash of rifles, Ensign Darrin pushed him back. Speaking in Spanish, he urged them to stay put to avoid any harm. The men in the room realized they were outnumbered and did not attempt anything. Ensign Darrin cautiously climbed the stairs to ensure no surprises in the dark. As the situation unfolded, John Carmody revealed that there were more potential threats nearby, prompting a quick retreat to safety.|['1.

"Pass the message to the soldiers to retreat quietly. I am concerned about the quietness behind the hedge. It seems the soldiers have been moved, and we might be ambushed near the sugar mill. Tell the soldiers to fall back cautiously, only shooting if commanded. Dave led his troops in a slow retreat, keeping an eye on the rear.

""At Tampico yesterday, an officer and boatcrew from the 'dolplin' went ashore in a launch. The boat displayed the United States Flag. The officer and men landed to buy supplies. An officer from General Huerta's Federal Army arrested them. They were released later, but Admiral Mayo demanded a formal apology and a twenty-one gun salute to our Flag. An apology was made, but it was unsatisfactory, and the gun salute was refused. Admiral Mayo has issued what seems like an ultimatum to the Mexican Federal commander at Tampico.

For an hour, the two officers remained silent. Cantor gave orders through petty officers below deck. Dave stayed on the starboard side of the bridge, focused on his duty.

In the midst of the intense battle, Lieutenant Trent, an American officer, demonstrated compassion and respect for the captured Mexican soldiers. Despite the fierce fighting between Mexican regulars and rebels, Trent assured the prisoners that they would be treated humanely and exchanged with their government. This act of kindness contrasted with the brutal customs of executing survivors prevalent among the Mexican forces. As the fighting continued, Trent strategically deployed sharpshooters to neutralize the enemy snipers hidden on rooftops and in windows. The Americans, employing a sniping strategy themselves, gradually pushed back the Mexican forces, who eventually wearied of the unequal struggle. Trent's leadership and tactical skills were evident as he directed his men to hold their position until all nearby snipers were silenced, ensuring the safety of his troops before retreating to the Post-office.|"['1.

Lieutenant Trent carefully scanned the rooftops for half an hour with his field glass. Convinced that his mission was accomplished as no more shots came from the building, he ordered his men to return. Leaving the Mexican casualties behind with a notice for the medical team, Trent led his troops back to the post office. There, the prisoners were handed over to the provost officer. Dave finished his meal first and took command from Trent. With two hundred men on standby, they were prepared to aid American forces in the city. Trent explained the challenges of engaging with snipers and the need for caution. Dave, suspecting Lieutenant Cantor's involvement with a bandit, planned a surprise operation. He sent a messenger to request Trent's presence quietly for the mission. Trent directed his men to storm the building to prevent any escape.|"['1.

Two sailors were assigned to guard the rear windows when they noticed a figure disappearing through the cellar doorway. Stone and Boot hurried into a rear room, opening the window. Trent coldly informed Darrin that he would take responsibility for the arrest. Cantor, angered by the situation, refused to explain his presence in Cosetta's house. Meanwhile, Dan and his crew broke down the cellar door and went down the stairs with a pocket lamp. A tense exchange between Trent and Cantor ensued, leading to Cantor's arrest.

Lieutenant Trent's command encountered the American advance line just half a mile into the city. As the sailors and marines engaged in a crackling exchange of fire with Mexican snipers, a man aimed a rifle from a window. Quick to react, Dave fired a shot that sent the man reeling. The sailors returned fire, resulting in casualties among the Mexicans. Amid the chaos, a man escaped from a hotel basement, sprinting towards the sailors seeking safety. He revealed urgent news of utmost importance. Trent ordered continuous machine gun fire and led his men through a storm of bullets towards the hotel. After failed attempts to break down the doors, sailors returned with a makeshift battering ram. Following a fierce conflict, the Americans emerged victorious, with Mexican casualties and wounded sailors.|"['1.

"""We were relieved to see a naval officer, Mr. Darrin,"" said the older man, warmly. ""Tom and I only had our revolvers for defense. I am Jason Denman, this is my wife, daughter, and son.""

""This is terrible news!"" gasped Lieutenant Trent. ""I will inform the commanding officer downtown. Dalzell will escort the Denmans to safety with thirty men.""

Danny Grin had left without orders. Once he confirmed his chum was safe, Dalzell followed the boatswain's mate's party. Dan climbed in through the window with the help of two seamen.

The search found one dead Mexican and a blood trail. Dalzell was warned about the danger of pursuing the fugitives.

Lieutenant Trent led his men back to a park with tents to rest. The Navy pushed forward, dealing with snipers and searching for weapons.

Residents were ordered to surrender arms. Those found armed were to be executed on the spot to stop sniping.

Vera Cruz was no longer a battleground. Trent's team was to protect aviators and watch for enemy airships. One junior officer may assist in making military maps from an airship.

Above the rooftops, a massive hydro-airplane appeared, reaching a height of one thousand feet. These planes, capable of landing and taking off from water, were perfect for the task at hand. Flying swiftly over Vera Cruz, the aircraft headed towards the front line and beyond. Lieutenant Bowers expressed sorrow for Cantor, a missing crew member facing treason charges. The aircraft spotted refugees heading towards safety, mistaking them for suspects. Plans for mediation between the U.S. and Mexico were discussed, with fears of a costly advance on Mexico City. Ensign Dave noted the location of Cantor and a bandit, suggesting a nighttime capture. The sight of suffering refugees, mainly Americans, deeply moved the crew. Such scenes were common in Vera Cruz, with people enduring hardships due to the torn-up tracks.|"['1.

Lieutenant Trent led his men and a group of exhausted refugees to the advanced line. Coxswain Riley expressed mixed emotions quietly as they approached. The cheers and grumbles from the lines welcomed the survivors, grateful they had escaped. Commander Dillingham decided to send for carriages to transport the refugees to the city. He instructed Lieutenant Trent to rest his men until needed, planning a midnight mission to apprehend the Mexicans responsible. Lieutenant Trent strategized to capture the fugitives by surprise, assigning Darrin and a team to flank the house. In a fierce confrontation, Cantor overpowered Darrin, but with timely support, they managed to defeat the bandits.
