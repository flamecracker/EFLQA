For three nights, Frank noticed Bart sneaking out of the room. Then, Bart stayed in bed for two nights, either too drained or out of money. Subsequently, the boys quietly descended the fire-escape from the opened window.

However, he struggled to resist the allure of the game that fascinated him. As his grades slipped below 2.5, classmates questioned his sudden decline. Gage and Snell plotted to trap Frank by exploiting his gambling losses. Despite initial wins, Frank's luck turned, leading to significant financial losses.

Bart confidently expressed his ability to handle challenges, realizing how close he came to a bad path. He offered to make a copy of the map on the ring for safekeeping.

Wat remained silent, feeling doubtful about the man's desperate actions to retrieve an old ring. Frank, too, questioned the man's honesty, as his stories contradicted each other. To prove his sincerity, the man offered Frank a twenty-dollar gold piece in advance, along with a promise of $75 more if the ring was returned within 48 hours.

Bart hastily rose to shut the door, but a gust of wind made his drawing flutter away. He tried to catch it but it slipped out the window. Bart saw it land near the trees by the academy. Worried about facing Frank without the drawing, Bart rushed back to their room. However, Wat Snell had left on a pass to meet his uncle in town. Bart and Frank, determined to find Snell, asked around and headed to the railway station. They learned Snell had been seen heading there. Suddenly, Bart realized Frank had been hurt.
