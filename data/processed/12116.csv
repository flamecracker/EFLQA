When children behave well, following rules at meal-times, during play, and throughout the day, they receive wonderful gifts during Christmas. However, naughty kids who tear clothes, make a mess, and mistreat others don't get any presents. Shock-headed Peter, with messy hair and dirty nails, is an example of bad behavior. On the other hand, there's cruel Frederick who harmed innocent creatures and even mistreated a loyal dog named Tray. Tray, retaliating against Frederick's cruelty, defended himself. In another instance, Harriet played with matches despite being warned not to. Ignoring the warnings, she set herself on fire, leading to a tragic outcome. The story teaches valuable lessons about the consequences of bad behavior and the importance of listening to warnings to stay safe.|['1.

Augustus used to be a plump and healthy boy, but he refused to eat his soup, and soon he became thin and weak. On the other hand, Philip was asked to behave at the table, but he couldn't sit still. He kept fidgeting, giggling, and swinging his chair until he toppled over, causing a mess with dishes and glasses falling. His parents were upset and frustrated, wondering how they would have their dinner now. Philip ended up covered under the tablecloth with all the dishes and glasses on top of him.
