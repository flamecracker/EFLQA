"Laura pleaded, ""Please don't say that this turmoil I feel is just from what I ate. I feel like I could storm Cupp's office, grab her, and lock her up."" Laura continued in a dramatic tone, ""Cupp is just following orders, the real troublemaker is the half-past nine curfew at Lakeview Hall. I promise you, curfew won't ring tonight!"" Nan agreed, ""Laura is right, curfew won't ring. But Cupp will find another way to signal bedtime. Let's start preparing for the new students' initiation."" Nan was drawn to Rhoda Hammond, not for her fancy clothes, but for something in her expression. She wanted to ensure that the newcomer wasn't treated too harshly during the initiation. The girls dressed up Amelia in comical attire, including a pillow-slip with eye-holes and a broom staff with a bag and an owl drawing. Amidst the laughter, they paraded through the hallways.

Nan Sherwood stopped struggling and allowed Laura to blindfold her securely. Although she could have easily removed the bandage since her hands were free, she chose to wait calmly for what would happen next. Nan was aware that the hazing was meant in good fun and not to harm the new girl, Rhoda Hammond. She even assisted in the prank to ensure Rhoda wasn't mistreated. Rhoda was given an old striped silk parasol with some panels split to carry. The group, led by Laura and Amelia, marched with Rhoda closely guarded to prevent her from escaping. Nan worried that Rhoda's serious demeanor might prolong and intensify the hazing. As they descended to the basement, Nan pondered the intentions of the older girls and the mystery surrounding Rhoda's initiation into the school.|"['1.

"Laura gathered the girls and quietly instructed them to stack all the mattresses on the platform under the shaky plank. Amelia, with her eyes shining through the pillow-slip holes, held Nan and the captive back. ""Sawney,"" the tall girl said firmly, ""since you objected to the traditional fire trial of Lakeview lambkins, you will be treated as a robber--No! A pirate. You will walk the plank."" Nan saw Laura fetch water and hand it to another girl who climbed the platform. Laura then took the victim's other arm, and they led Rhoda to the platform. A stepladder was set up against the plank. The mattresses were in place, and a fall from the plank would only be about three feet. Despite the plank's unsteadiness, the girls were confident in their athletic abilities. Laura nudged Rhoda forward, who stumbled on her knees upon landing but quickly recovered. Rhoda expressed her frustration, but Laura assured her she would learn valuable lessons at Lakeview Hall."|['1.

Nan Sherwood carried the liniment to Rhoda's room and returned with Henry's overall suit. In their room, Bess Harley expressed her disdain for Rhoda, claiming the other girls wouldn't like her and they planned to ignore her. However, Nan's influence had kept Bess from acting unwise like Rhoda. The school buzzed with Rhoda's unpopular actions, going against school customs. The older girls smirked at her, while the younger ones were curious. The girls usually hazed newcomers playfully, but Rhoda's resistance was seen as a breach of tradition.

They were bought for me by a friend, mostly in Chicago."" ""Humph! Your mother should have attended to your being properly dressed. This is a practical school, not a theatrical company, you have come to,"" snapped Mrs. Cupp, who was always very severe in matters of dress. The statement sponged the smiles from the faces of all the girls within hearing. Bess Harley fairly sobbed when she and Nan got to their room with the piles of their own garments, which Mrs. Cupp had allowed them to take from their trunks. She had been schooled mostly at home, it appeared. Nan understood--although Rhoda did not say as much--that her mother had personally conducted much of her education until the last two years. Then she had had a governess. ""Why, I thought these Western cowgirls were just like boys--that they were even born with an ability to pitch a ball underhand, for instance, which we girls are not,"" sighed Laura. ""And look at that thing! She doesn't know how to do anything right."" ""Stop trying to make excuses for her, Nan Sherwood,"" commanded the red-haired girl sharply. ""I won't have it.

"Several days passed before the group ventured far from Rose Ranch once more. Each day, they spent a few hours riding, becoming skilled horsewomen, except for Walter, who was already an adept horseman. In the grand drawing-room, there was a player-piano and a top-notch phonograph. The windows opened to the floor, attracting cowboys, Mexicans, and even Ah Foon to listen to the music on the side porch. The ranch owner's wife suggested they dance and enjoy themselves. A spontaneous dance followed that evening. Later, they were formally invited to a cowboy dance at the men's quarters, showcasing real cowboy moves. The event drew Mexican and white girls, along with Indians in modern attire. Walter was surprised by the Indian's views on traditional dances. The group had missed meeting ""Dan's bunch,"" who were out rounding up wild horse herds. The wild stallions in the hills were admired for their vigor and beauty, enhancing the ranch's horse herds during the annual round-up."|"['1.

Rhoda was discussing with Nan about the cattle and how they distinguish them from others. She mentioned attending the round-up where the biggest bunch of horses in a decade was being driven down. Rhoda's father arranged for them to start early the next morning with a grub wagon and cook. Rhoda joked about cyclones and how they twist a pig's tail. The sleepy peons brought the ponies at daybreak, and Rhoda set off with no need for a guard within Rose Ranch. She mentioned how tramps wouldn't get far in that area and how her father's past as a sheriff kept them safe. As they rode out, the red sun rose behind them, casting a golden glow on the plains and mesas. Rhoda explained that people in that region didn't carry guns openly like in the movies.|"[""1.

"""That is the old Spanish Trail,"" said the Rose Ranch girl. ""It is the trail I told you about, by which the old Conquistadors of Cortez reached this part of the country. And it is the most direct road into Mexico.""

""No; I cannot distinguish the horsemen. But I can see the little flashes moving across the saddle of the Gap and down into the valley on this side. And I know they are Mexicans because those flashes are the sun's rays shining on the silver trimming on their sombreros. Yes, they are Mexicans.""

""More. Poor Mexicans--the peons who come up here to find work--do not wear such sombreros. Nor do many Mexicans waste their money in such fashions nowadays. But there is a class that dress just that fancily.""

""Men that the ranchers here will not want to see. I know that daddy will ride over to the rodeo behind us, or I would turn about now and run to tell him. There! they are gone. There must have been a dozen of them.""

""Of course, I am not positive. But I think,"" said Rhoda, closing the glasses and putting them in the case again, ""that they are a band of wanderers.

As the group rode swiftly away from the trail, the unfamiliar noise grew louder. It was evident that something was approaching from the canyon, but the large rocks blocked their view. Rhoda signaled for everyone to dismount and stand in front of the horses, holding the reins tightly. The thundering sound of hooves drew closer, and a cloud of dust emerged above the boulders. Soon, horsemen appeared, leading a diverse herd with horses of various colors. The wild mob surged down the canyon, creating a tumultuous scene. The observers watched in awe as the herd passed by, including young colts struggling to keep up with their mothers.

Rhoda Hammond and her friends watched as a long line of horses passed by at a brisk canter, creating a cloud of dust and an unpleasant smell. Once the last horse had gone, the herdsmen followed, tipping their hats to the spectators. Dan MacCormack, with his red beard and black eyes, acknowledged Rhoda and her companions as he rode past. The procession was completed by chuck wagons drawn by mules, with drivers smoking pipes and cooks lounging beside them. Rhoda then led her group out of the canyon to circle around the herd towards Rolling Spring Valley for branding. As they rode, Bess, Rhoda's horse, expressed distaste for the branding process. The group eventually reached a lush valley with a river and set up camp, waiting for Mr. Hammond to arrive. Lunch was prepared, and they awaited the arrival of the other chuck wagons.

Her father expressed concern about the workload, but reassured them that with many people around, there was no need to worry about any dangers on the ranch. The group learned that the corrals could hold up to a thousand horses and that it would take about three days to manage all the livestock. As they observed the cowboys working, they found them to be helpful and well-mannered. The night passed without any disturbances, and the next day, everyone was up early to help with the horses. Rhoda demonstrated how to handle the horses, and even the visitors got involved in the process. Despite the challenging tasks, the experience was fascinating for the group.

Nan woke to a mysterious sound outside the tent. She cautiously peered through the flap, seeing eerie shapes in the dim light. Realizing it was just her imagination, she quietly dressed, not wanting to disturb her friends. Nan and Walter dried off at the campfire, discussing the wild stallions they had heard.

Rhoda and her friends hurried to the corral to saddle up the riding ponies. Rhoda deftly noosed the ponies and cinched the saddles tightly. As they mounted, the sun's rays illuminated the plain ahead. In the distance, a magnificent horse stood on a boulder, looking regal and wild. This horse, once owned by Mr. Duranger, had become the wildest of the herd after running off years ago. The horse called out to the approaching herd, signaling his presence. The branding of the horses in Rolling Spring Valley brought together many ranch hands and workers. Rhoda, Nan, and Walter watched the activities, staying close to the riverside camp. Nan suspected their caution was due to the Mexican riders seen on the horizon, a warning from Mr. Hammond.|['1.

When the cowboys were finishing up their tasks and preparing to head back to their ranches, a rider appeared from the south, racing across the valley towards the camp by the cottonwood trees. Mr. Hammond, noticing the urgency in the rider's approach, called out to Bill Shaddock from the Long Bow range, asking if the rider was one of his cowboys. The rider, coming from the direction of the Long Bow range, informed them that a group of Mexican thieves had stolen the last bunch of stock meant for their ranch. Bill Shaddock organized a posse to track down the thieves, but Mr. Hammond insisted that the younger folks head back to the house to avoid any danger.

Rhoda, Walter, and Nan set out on a hunting expedition near Rose Ranch, carefully navigating the hills in search of game. Armed with rifles, they spotted a group of grazing animals in the distance. As they approached, Nan noticed a peculiar cloud on the horizon, wondering if it was dust kicked up by animals. Rhoda, experienced in hunting, advised a cautious approach to not startle the animals. Using a clever tactic, Rhoda managed to get closer to the antelopes by riding strategically. When the antelopes sensed danger, they bolted, showcasing their incredible speed and agility.

The wind carried the scent of the chasing group to the antelopes, but they didn't notice Rhoda. She aimed her rifle, ready to shoot. When the others caught up, Rhoda was focused on a slate-colored cloud. Suddenly, a moaning sound approached from the west. A tempest hit, and Rhoda led the group towards the hills for safety. As they entered a gulch, the wind howled around them, but Rhoda remained confident. The group found shelter behind a boulder in the hillside, where Rhoda led them into a dark cavern.

The ranch girl admitted that the mysterious sounds in the hills gave her the creeps, although she didn't believe they were in immediate danger. As they sought shelter in a cave, the roaring tornado outside gradually turned into heavy rain. Rhoda reassured them that the cave was safe from flooding, as the floor was higher than the rising water outside. Despite the darkness and hunger, they found comfort in Rhoda's courage and the calm behavior of the ponies. The girls ventured cautiously through the tunnel, hoping for the rain to subside soon.

The cave's entrance was ten feet above the gulch, filled with water. Rhoda doubted anyone could wade through it. She worried about the tornado's impact on the ranch's horses and cattle. The girls, hearing strange screams from the cave, wanted to move away. The rain stopped, leaving a small puddle at the cave's mouth. Rhoda retrieved her rifle, ready to defend the group.

Rhoda didn't intend to scare her friends, as it would be unnecessary and cruel. However, she couldn't shake off the thought of strangers in the area, particularly a mysterious Mexican near the bears' den. The girls returned to the cave, Rhoda gripping the rifle while they listened for any signs of activity at the entrance. All they heard were the horses' movements and occasional eerie cries from the depths. Rhoda expressed relief at leaving the haunted cave and wanted to steer clear of the area during their time at Rose Ranch.

Tom shared a strange encounter he had while riding back from the rodeo. As he was heading towards the ranch, a magnificent black horse emerged from a gulch. Despite being completely sober, Tom decided to chase after the horse with his rope, seeing an opportunity. The horse led him into a twisty gulch, with its hooves clattering and a distinctive whistle-like neigh. However, as Tom turned a corner, the noise suddenly stopped, and the horse vanished without a trace. Tom searched the area but found no sign of the horse.

The group on a treasure hunt didn't head straight to the gulch where the girls had their adventure during the tornado. Hesitation Kane had supplies to deliver to cowboys herding steers far in the hills. They entered a valley that would have been beautiful if not for recent rain damage. The hills were rocky, and the valley was torn up by water. When they reached Steve's outfit with nearly a thousand cattle, the cowboys were thrilled to see them. The evening was pleasant as the cattle were brought to a safe enclosure for the night. Tom Collins and the cook prepared a delicious supper, followed by songs and stories.

A sudden flash of lightning and a loud peal of thunder startled the camp. The cattle grew restless, snorting and pawing the ground, while huddling closer together. Walter noticed strange horsemen riding towards them from the west, not part of their group. Before he could ask about them, another bolt of lightning revealed one of the horsemen charging towards the cattle, causing a stampede.

A burst of gunfire met the charging cattle just as it seemed Walter Mason would be overrun. The chaos unfolded in the narrow valley between the ridges. The lead cattle stumbled, causing a collision akin to two trains crashing. In the lightning flashes, the scene was horrific. The cattle behind pushed forward, trampling and crushing those in front. Amidst the chaos, Steve and the other herders saw an opportunity. They swiftly rode down the flank of the herd, creating a barrier with their horses. The cattle began to circle, calming down.

Hesitation and his horse vanished as they made their way around a large boulder, leaving the rest of the group puzzled until the pack horse let out a frightened squeal.

In the diagram, there are specific spots marked. Daddy doubts Lobarto's cross marking the hidden treasure's location on a barren hill. This hill is situated between the gulch where they sought shelter from a storm and the gully where Tom Collins pursued a black horse. Daddy finds it unreasonable to dig on the exposed hillside or its peak. He remains skeptical, especially since a part of the gang returned to Mexico with stolen horses. Daddy's posse is searching for the thieves who caused a recent steer stampede. They suspect the gang believed the treasure was buried in that direction. Despite thorough exploration of the cavern and its smaller chambers, no treasure was discovered. However, a crack in the wall at the end of the cave caught Walter's attention, hinting at a potential discovery.
