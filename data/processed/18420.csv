"""Come here, Snap!"" called Mr. Bobbsey. ""Come here at once!"" And he said it in such a way that Snap knew he must come. Snap, with a last bark at the troublesome dog, turned and ran back. ""I wish you could call _my_ dog back as easily as you called yours,"" said the man. ""But I guess I had better go after him myself,"" he added. ""Your dog and mine don't seem to get along well together, and I think it's Rover's fault. But he has never traveled in a train before, and perhaps he was frightened.""

Mrs. Bobbsey was worried about their cat Snoop, who had gotten stuck on the varnished floor. She called Mr. Bobbsey, who hurried home with turpentine to free Snoop. Using a board and turpentine, he softened the varnish holding Snoop's paws and rescued her. The twins, Flossie and Freddie, were relieved. Later, Nan and Flossie prepared invitations for a party. They moistened the envelopes and stamps and got them ready to mail. Nan then gathered ingredients to make a sponge cake. With Flossie and Freddie by her side, she mixed the batter in a brown bowl. Nan was grateful for their help and started baking the cake for the upcoming party.|['1.

Nan and Flossie were baking a cake in the kitchen when a mishap occurred. Flossie accidentally dropped an egg, causing it to crack on the floor. Despite the little accident, Nan remained calm and continued with the baking process. She involved Flossie and Freddie in helping her with the ingredients, ensuring they handled items that wouldn't break. As they worked, Snap, the dog, playfully tugged at them, leading to a comical situation. Eventually, Snap was taken outside to play while the children cleaned up. Later, the kids played a game of hide-and-seek, with Freddie getting stuck while trying to hide. Flossie and Nan had to call for help, and Mrs. Bobbsey came to the rescue, ensuring everything was back to normal.|[]|[]
Mrs. Bobbsey decided to move the piano instead of pulling Freddie out. She pushed it away from the wall, revealing the little wheels underneath that made it easy to move. With the piano now shifted, Freddie could free his head. His ears had gotten caught between the piano and the wall, causing the trouble. Mrs. Bobbsey cautioned Freddie about being careful not to get stuck in tight spaces, sharing a story about cats getting their heads caught in tin cans. A week later, the Bobbsey twins received letters, including one that made Mrs. Bobbsey smile. Bert, Nan, Flossie, and Freddie were told about a plan to find Tommy Todd's missing father, involving a shipwreck. Freddie, determined to help, visited his father's yard with the idea of finding a ship to aid in the search. He carried nails and string, ready for an adventure.|"['1.

"""Would you like to hear a story?"" the watchman asked, starting a fun game. James, who knew many tales from his time in the woods, joined in.

Freddie found himself in a unique play-house made of fallen lumber. The boards formed a peaked roof over his head, creating a cozy space with light filtering through the cracks. Despite trying to call for help, the noise of the lumber wagons drowned his voice. Meanwhile, James assumed Freddie had left and went back to the office. Freddie, being a clever five-year-old, decided to stay calm and pondered his situation. He imagined how fun it would be if his sister Flossie could join him. Realizing he had only nails and string in his pockets, he settled down in the warm play-house. As he drifted off to sleep, a scratching sound woke him, hinting at a possible rescue.|"[""1.

Once more, there was a scratching and mewing sound, and a big gray cat from the lumber yard emerged through a crack. Freddie recognized the cat, who often visited his father's office. The cat purred and snuggled up next to Freddie, who fell asleep with Sawdust beside him. Meanwhile, Mr. Bobbsey searched for Freddie in the lumber yard, asking the watchman and his workers. Unaware, Freddie slept peacefully under a pile of boards, hidden from view.

On a sunny Saturday morning, the Bobbsey twins, along with their friends Nellie and Charley, set out to gather chestnuts in the woods. Bert advised Flossie and Freddie to use small salt bags instead of big baskets to carry the nuts. As they walked through the city towards the woods, they passed Mr. Bobbsey's lumber yard and soon arrived at the forest. Excited children from the neighborhood were already there, searching for chestnuts that had fallen from the trees due to the frost. The kids eagerly joined in the hunt, filling their salt bags with the freshly fallen nuts.

Bert, knowledgeable about trees, pointed out oak, hickory, maple, and elm trees in the woods. Nan, helping Flossie with chestnut burr stickers, found a pile of nuts under a tree. George speculated that a squirrel had gathered them. The group searched and found more nuts hidden under dried leaves. They spotted a tree with burrs ready to drop the nuts. George climbed a tree but it broke, and he landed safely. Bert advised him to choose a sturdier tree next time. George checked the next tree for stability before climbing again.|['1.

Everything went smoothly this time. George climbed up a small tree and stepped onto the branches of a larger chestnut tree with shiny, brown nuts ready to be shaken down. As George shook the branches, a shower of nuts fell. The Bobbsey twins and their friends quickly filled their salt bags with nuts. Nellie helped her brother by collecting nuts while he shook the tree. After gathering the nuts, they set up lunch on a flat stump. Bert even made a cup out of waxed paper for drinking water from a nearby spring. George shared some nuts with a chipmunk, which made a chattering noise before scampering up a tree. Bert explained how to roast chestnuts without them bursting. The children enjoyed their roasted chestnuts and boiled some in salt water for added flavor.

Bert quickly put on his bathrobe and headed out to the hallway. His father, following behind, turned on the light in the boys' room and discovered the broken window. Glass shards covered the floor, and snow blew in through the open window. Mr. Bobbsey decided to close the shutters and cover the window with a blanket to block the snow while letting in fresh air. After cleaning up the broken glass and bricks, the boys returned to bed. Despite the cold room, they enjoyed the cool temperature for sleeping. The storm raged on, preventing the younger Bobbsey twins from going to Sunday school.

The igloo-shaped snow fort delighted Bert, Charley, and the Bobbsey twins for days. However, as the sun gradually melted the snow, a mishap occurred one afternoon. Flossie and Freddie, returning home early, ventured to play inside the snow fort. Suddenly, the family dog, Snap, leaped onto the fragile roof, causing it to collapse. Freddie found himself trapped under the fallen snow, calling for help. Dinah, the cook, hurried outside with a spoon and began digging Freddie out. Reluctant to undress, Dinah opted for a creative solution. She carried Freddie inside to change into dry clothes, cautioning the children to avoid unstable snow structures.

Bert carefully shuffled across the barn floor, trying not to trip on the barrel staves. Charley opened the back door, and Bert stepped into the snow, shuffling along on the smooth wood pieces. The sun had softened some snow, causing Bert's feet to sink. Charley laughed, then waded out to help. They walked over the hard crust, avoiding the soft snow. Bert joked about making snowshoes for Freddie, but Freddie struggled and fell. Winter had arrived in Lakeport, bringing cold and snow for sledding.

Freddie's wish for snow to arrive quickly was not fulfilled immediately. The warm weather persisted for almost a week, causing the remaining snow to melt. This delayed Bert and Charley from demonstrating how they could walk on barrel-stave shoes to Harry. However, Harry observed the shoes' design and decided to make a pair for himself back at Meadow Brook. One chilly night, a sudden cold snap occurred, causing the house's boards to crack. The cold weather prompted Bert, Harry, and Freddie, bundled up warmly, to skate on the frozen lake. Despite not having skates, Tommy joined them after borrowing a pair from Bert. While skating, Freddie noticed Tommy heading towards a dangerous area on the lake. Tommy fell through the ice, but fortunately, other skaters and Mr. Bobbsey helped rescue him.|"['1.

By now, the man who had warned the other skaters had found two planks and placed them near the hole where Tommy fell. Mr. Bobbsey arrived with a rope and tossed it to Tommy, but it fell short. After a few tries, Tommy caught the rope, and with the help of Mr. Bobbsey and Mr. Randall, he was pulled out of the icy water. Tommy was wet and cold, but luckily he hadn't swallowed much water. Mr. Bobbsey suggested that Tommy wear dry clothes and called his wife to send an extra suit. A friend offered to drive Tommy home in a warm car. Bert and Harry were surprised by what happened to Tommy and offered to help. Mrs. Bobbsey decided to assist Tommy's family by arranging for a doctor's visit and helping them find a better home.

Mrs. Bobbsey and her club helped Mrs. Todd and Tommy. They planned to move them to a new house, but because of the cold weather, they decided to wait. Mrs. Bobbsey often sent food to Tommy's grandmother. Bert or Nan sometimes took the basket, and on nice days, Flossie and Freddie went too. Mrs. Bobbsey gave permission for the twins to visit Mrs. Todd, cautioning them to return quickly due to the approaching snowstorm. Unfortunately, the twins got lost in the storm, walking in the wrong direction away from home. They found themselves on the outskirts of Lakeport in a meadow, a place without houses and only a few paths. Flossie remembered the danger of falling asleep in the snow from a story their mother had read to them.|"['1.

Flossie glanced around, observing the heavy snowfall. Surprisingly, the cold wasn't too harsh. Lost in the storm, the Bobbsey twins found a hint of adventure in their situation. Freddie suddenly recognized their location, the meadows where Bert had once searched for muskrats. Determined to seek shelter, they stumbled upon a small snow structure. Flossie suggested knocking, hoping to find warmth inside. Freddie, skeptical, searched for a way in. As they struggled to open the door, Flossie joked about snowflakes in her ear, longing for the comfort of home. Despite the challenges, the siblings faced the unknown with a hint of curiosity and resilience.|"['1.

Freddie and Flossie were exploring outside when they came across a peculiar sight. As Freddie dug into a mound of snow with a stick, they discovered it wasn't just snow inside, but a mix of sticks, grass, and dirt. Suddenly, a furry nose appeared, followed by bright eyes - it was a muskrat! Startled, the children stumbled back. Freddie recognized the animal and assured Flossie they were safe. But Flossie was spooked and urged Freddie to leave, worried the muskrat might chase them. As they called for help, a man emerged from the storm, also lost. The man invited them to shelter and share their story, offering to help them find their way back together.|['1.

Freddie explained how they got lost in the snowstorm and ended up in the meadow. The man, who was also lost, realized he was near Lakeport thanks to the children's help. He shared how he mistakenly got off at Belleville and hired a car that broke down. Determined to find the way, he recalled his past in Lakeport. With the shed as a landmark, he remembered a path to a road for transport. The Bobbsey twins, now feeling safe, ventured back into the storm with the man's guidance. Despite the challenges, the man praised the children for their bravery and assured them he would get them home to ease their mother's worry.|"[""1.
