Reuben was devastated as he recounted the events leading to his unjust accusation. The coachman mistook him for a boy leaving the yard at a suspicious time.

Reuben overheard a conversation about a burglary plan targeting the squire's house. He recognized one of the voices as Tom Thorne's. As Reuben contemplated warning the squire, he was discovered and knocked unconscious by two men. When he came to, Reuben found himself bound and gagged in a ditch. The men debated their next move, with one insisting on carrying out the burglary despite objections from another who didn't want to resort to violence. Reuben could hear their discussion but couldn't make out the details. Eventually, the men moved away, leaving Reuben injured and alone. Despite his efforts to stay alert, Reuben succumbed to his injuries and lost consciousness once more.|"[""1.

Reuben was disoriented, unsure of how long he had been in the cart. Eventually, he was jolted awake as he was tossed to the cart's floor. Four men joined, and the horse trotted off. Reuben's head throbbed, and the tight cords around his arms caused discomfort. Despite the men's jovial chatter, the cart's noise drowned their words. After what felt like hours, they halted, untied Reuben, and sped away, leaving him in a dark, wooded area. With no idea of his location, Reuben ventured back, hoping to find help. As dawn approached, he sought a labourer's aid. Reuben finally made it to a village, where he was unexpectedly handcuffed by a constable.

The chief constable advised Reuben not to incriminate himself and to remain silent. Reuben, however, expressed his indignation at being arrested without evidence. The chief constable mentioned that the story seemed likely but lacked conclusive proof. Reuben's mother, Mrs. Whitney, was upset by the unjust charge against her son, believing there was no evidence to support it. Reuben mentioned a past incident involving a dog that made him suspect the same person was behind his current situation. Despite his good character, Reuben felt unfairly treated. The next day, Reuben appeared before three magistrates due to the burglary incidents, causing a stir in the town.

The defense counsel rose to question the squire, emphasizing the favorable evidence for the prisoner. The squire confirmed the lad had no reason to be upstairs in the house during his employment. The counsel highlighted the lack of evidence connecting Reuben to the robbery beyond his tools found on the premises.

Reuben was relieved to discover that he had been cleared of the charges not because the jury believed in his innocence, but due to the intervention of Kate Ellison, the girl who had always supported him. Jacob, the smith, shared how Kate had convinced him of Reuben's innocence, leading to his acquittal.

A week later, Reuben wandered by the London Docks, observing the bustling activity of loading and unloading ships. His departure from his mother was emotional, but she agreed his journey was best, though she wouldn't venture so far. The squire bid him farewell, offering help, which Reuben politely declined. Walking the docks, he sought work as a carpenter for a voyage to Australia. Despite initial doubts due to his age, Reuben's skills and character impressed the captain, who accepted him to work his passage. The ship, Paramatta, set sail swiftly, with Reuben busy with tasks.

In a short time, the small ship pulled up beside the larger ship, and a ramp was lowered for the passengers to come aboard. There were about ten passengers, including six men, four ladies, and three children who were staying in their parents' cabins. The convicts on deck made rude jokes as the passengers climbed aboard. Reuben learned that only a few passengers could be on deck at a time, with soldiers and sentries stationed around. The ship set sail back to Dover while the Paramatta resumed its journey. Reuben was assigned to the chief mate's watch and was told he would not have to climb the masts but would help with deck tasks. Despite feeling seasick for three days, Reuben recovered and joined the crew on deck, eager to learn from the experienced sailor Bill.|"['1.

Bill and Reuben were discussing the rough sea they encountered while sailing to Sydney. Bill mentioned that experiencing a real gale would be even more intense. He explained that the passengers stay below deck during bad weather, just like the sailors. Bill preferred the open sea without land nearby, as the coast of Africa could be treacherous. The next morning, passengers were on deck when Reuben was asked to secure boxes in the cabins. A young lady, Miss Hudson, observed Reuben working and complimented his skills. The captain, unsure about Reuben's background, appreciated his work ethic and noted that Reuben was an emigrant rather than a seasoned sailor.

"""I find him quite intriguing, Captain Wilson,"" the girl remarked, addressing a gentleman nearby who had been following their conversation. ""If you have the chance, could you chat with our carpenter and uncover more about him?""

""I'd be glad to, Miss Hudson, but I doubt there's much to discover, and even if there is, he might not be forthcoming,"" replied the gentleman. ""Based on what you've said, I'd guess he had a harsh employer and fled.""

""You're so distrustful, Captain Wilson!"" the girl chuckled. ""That's the downside of being a police officer, always suspecting everyone. I prefer to believe people are honest until proven otherwise.""

""True, but in this settlement, caution is wise, with many convicts and thieving natives,"" the girl countered. ""England dispatches its rogues here, and it's a concern for us.""

""Indeed, it's a complex matter,"" Miss Hudson remarked casually. ""We shouldn't bear the burden of England's criminals. When free labor is ample, the colonists will resist convict influx.""

After serving four years, Reuben, a strong and capable young man, received orders to hand over his district to a new officer. Despite being only twenty-three, Reuben's strength and experience made him the right choice for a challenging task in the Goora district. Captain Wilson praised Reuben's qualities of resolution and intelligence, essential for dealing with bush rangers and troublesome natives in the area. Although Reuben couldn't be promoted to inspector yet, he had the opportunity to earn it through hard work. The district was known for its difficulties, with dense bush and dangerous outlaws. Reuben was warned to be both cautious and bold in this risky assignment, where success would bring him great recognition.|"['1.

George and Frances were having a discussion about sending Reuben to a dangerous place. Frances was worried about the risks involved, but George believed Reuben's courage and energy were needed. He explained that they had to address the press's criticism of their incompetence in protecting settlements. George wanted Reuben to prove himself and earn a promotion. Frances expressed her concerns, feeling that Reuben should have accepted a safer job. George assured her that Reuben was capable of taking care of himself and others, especially with the help of a skilled tracker named Jim. Reuben eventually left for his new post at Goora, a small settlement with a troubled history. The sergeant in charge, O'Connor, welcomed Reuben and discussed the challenges they faced with the previous officers. George planned to bring in new recruits to boost morale and effectiveness in dealing with the dangers of bush rangers and natives in the area.|"[""1.

Three days later, the new group of soldiers arrived, and Reuben noticed that Captain Wilson had handpicked a group of young men, half of whom were new recruits. The rest were experienced workers from up-country stations. Meanwhile, eight men deemed least useful were sent back to Sydney, relieved from their duties. Reuben, with advice from O'Connor, dispatched five teams of three men each to protect vulnerable stations, reserving ten for flexibility. He spent two months exploring the district with Jim and two veteran constables to understand the area better before taking action. The attacks had stopped temporarily, allowing Reuben to learn the terrain. Settlers shared tales of losses due to bush rangers and natives. Despite challenges, Reuben's arrival gave hope to the settlers, although the vast and secretive nature of the land posed difficulties in tracking down the culprits.|"['1.

"""Captain,"" he said--for although Reuben had no right to that title, he was always so called by the settlers--""the blacks have been down at my place. They have killed my two shepherds, and driven off the sheep.""

""Some time yesterday afternoon--at least, I judge so. One of the men was to have come in for supplies, and when night came and he hadn't come in, I began to be afraid something was wrong, for I knew that they were getting short. So this morning, at daybreak, I rode out with the hands I have about the house. We could see nothing of the sheep, so we rode straight to the men's hut. There, lying some twenty yards away, was the body of one of the men, riddled with spear holes. He had evidently been running to the hut for shelter, when he was overtaken. I did not stop to look for the other, for no doubt he had been killed, too.""

""He ran into the house, buckled on his sword, put some cold meat and a small bag of flour into his haversack, together with some dampers Jim had just cooked, and then went out again.

Gentlemen, before proceeding, it's crucial to consider station defense against bush rangers who may join forces with the blacks we seek. Married men should remain home to protect their families. Those willing to join the expedition must be prepared to travel for a week or more. Supplies like flour, tea, sugar, and rum will be provided. Meat won't be an issue as sheep along the way will suffice. Spare horses are essential in case of emergencies. The men, led by Mr. Blount, set out at dawn.

Jim and Reuben rode out, discussing the black fellows they had seen. Jim was suspicious of the trackers, believing they were no good. He shared a secret he had witnessed days ago, where the trackers were conversing with other black fellows. Reuben found it odd that the bush rangers always escaped, possibly due to the trackers misleading the search. As they followed the trail, they discovered the remains of sheep that had been hunted and eaten by the blacks. The settlers marveled at how much the blacks could consume when determined.

Reuben mentioned that they wouldn't eat so much with a long journey ahead. He estimated there were about sixty sheep, but only three to a sheep. After a brief stop, they rode for three more hours and found three dead sheep, speared but not eaten. Mr. Blount explained that the natives killed for fun, even if they didn't need the meat. They reached a river after five more miles, where twenty sheep drowned while trying to drink. Mr. Blount predicted they would catch up before night as the sheep would be slower today.

Reuben, along with a few colonists and constables, was on a mission to find the missing sheep. Jim, a skilled tracker, could spot the signs of their movement.

Fortunately, all the members of the group were armed for protection. Without these weapons, they would have been vulnerable to attacks by the indigenous people every time they fired their rifles.

When the sound of approaching horsemen was heard, everyone readied their rifles, but the natives had already started to retreat.

In the early days of settlement, the first colonists were hardworking and mostly poor men. Young men with resources had not yet arrived, so there was little reason for escaped convicts to bother them. However, there were some dangerous individuals like a notorious criminal known as Cockeye. He was a real menace and lived among the indigenous people, avoiding contact with the settlers. With law enforcement still developing, people had to rely on themselves for protection. Once, when I was seventeen, I narrowly escaped an encounter with Cockeye and his group. While returning home on horseback, I heard gunshots and saw a commotion with our cattle. I raced back to warn my family, encountering danger along the way.

I felt very scared as I was being chased by a dangerous man on horseback. He was closing in on me fast, cursing and shouting to stop. I had a head start but knew he was a better rider. I had pistols but wasn't a good shot. I hoped he'd ride up unsuspecting so I could defend myself. He fired warning shots, then one hit my shoulder. I took out a pistol, heard a shot, his horse fell. I rode to safety. My family defended our home from attackers. The man chasing me met a grim fate at the hands of the indigenous people. It was a close call, but we stood our ground.|"[""1.

Rarely did Mr. Blount encounter such dreadful situations, more feared than the bush rangers. While the bush rangers were known to resort to violence, if they felt inclined, they often left people bound if they faced no serious resistance. One tragic incident involved three white men left tied up at an isolated station, only to be found dead from starvation and thirst weeks later. Another account shared involved a group spared by indigenous people during an attack, except for a three-year-old girl taken by the tribe's chief. The child's father, upon returning, found his house burnt and his family members dead, except for the missing girl. Determined, the father relentlessly pursued the tribe, instilling fear in them. Eventually, after months of searching, he successfully retrieved his daughter, who had adapted to a wild life but eventually settled back into society.|"['1.

A collection was raised in Sydney to send the two individuals home. The ship's captain mentioned that the child had adapted to civilization during the voyage and behaved like any other child before reaching England. Mr. Blount explained that troublemakers like Cockeye and Fothergill were exceptions, not the norm. He compared them to highwaymen back in England, targeting travelers for their belongings. Reuben added that although these bush rangers were a nuisance, they rarely turned violent. Dick Caister shared that these outlaws avoided killing to evade the death penalty if caught. He emphasized that once they crossed that line, they became reckless and dangerous. The group acknowledged encounters with bush rangers but highlighted that most were not inherently malicious, often just seeking basic supplies without violence.|"[""1.

Many settlers in Australia encountered convicts who had escaped and resorted to occasional robberies to survive. These settlers often showed leniency towards them, understanding the harsh conditions the convicts faced. The settlers had a mutual respect for the natives' tracking abilities, comparing them to dogs with their keen sense of smell. Jim, a native guide, led the settlers on a mission to track down a group of convicts who had stolen sheep. Despite the settlers' desire to confront the convicts immediately, the settler advised waiting until morning to launch a more strategic attack. The settlers appreciated Jim's expertise and planned to position themselves close to the convicts' location to wait for daylight before taking action.|"['1.

Reuben left his horse with the settler, borrowed a new one, and rode 30 miles to the site of the attack. Upon arrival, he met eight police officers who had lost track of the bush rangers they were chasing.

It was quickly decided that more help was needed before they could confront the bush rangers. Everyone was eager to assist in the search. Dick Shillito and the two Watsons were chosen to ride to nearby stations for reinforcements. At one station, they would find two additional policemen, and as they journeyed, they would likely gather more support from other stations along the way. Once the plan was set, the group paused for a meal. One member recounted an encounter with the bush rangers, where shots were fired, prompting a chase. The next day, the party gathered and set off with Jim leading the way. They followed tracks for five miles to a shepherd's hut, where they questioned the resident about the rangers' visit.

After the meal, a discussion arose among the settlers about their next steps. Some decided to go home to their worried wives, while the rest agreed to stay another day. Mr. Barker learned the whereabouts of the sheep and cattle and sent a group to inform the shepherds and herdsmen. They were instructed to bring the animals closer to the house. The deceased men were buried, and Mrs. Barker took over the household management. Later, Mr. Barker suggested Reuben visit the women for some uplifting conversation. Reuben and Mr. Barker found Mrs. Donald and her sister in the kitchen. The unexpected reunion between Kate Ellison and Reuben Whitney surprised them both. Kate expressed her gratitude to Reuben for his help. Reuben was equally shocked to see Kate in Australia, having believed her to be in England.

Reuben had asked his mother to send him details, but communication between Australia and England was slow. No response had arrived yet.

Mr. Ellison disapproved of the engagement, and after his death, they found only six thousand pounds for his daughters. Mr. Donald had no prospects, so they married and moved to New South Wales to start a new life. Mrs. Donald felt awkward about the situation and her mother's prejudices against Reuben.

As far as I can understand, he tells me at this time of year there is no other water hole, within a long distance; so that naturally there will be many natives making for it. I am glad there are not any of them here, now.""

""Yes,"" Mr. Blount said, examining them, and pulling out a brand that was still glowing. ""Do you see, a lot of sand has been thrown over it. Whoever was here must have seen us coming, and tried to extinguish the fire when they caught sight of us.""

""That is most unfortunate,"" Reuben said. ""The fellows must have made off, to carry the news of our coming to their friends. However, it's too late to do anything now. It's already getting dark, and they must have got a quarter of an hour's start. We have taken quite enough out of the horses, and can do no more with them, if they have to travel tomorrow; but I would give a year's pay if this hadn't happened.

Jim, with his keen observation skills, led the group quietly through the bush. After a long walk, they spotted a fire where two black men rested. The men were tired from their journey to the water hole and decided to wait until morning to continue. Reuben and the party were relieved to hear that the men who could have alerted the bush rangers had been taken care of. However, the news of two men escaping and the possibility of them returning with reinforcements put the group on high alert. They decided to halt a mile away from the bush rangers' location, with Jim leading a group to cut off their escape route. The plan was to deal with the bush rangers first, as they were the main target.

The colonists harbored a deep hatred towards the bush rangers, especially since they were aided by ticket-of-leave laborers. Jim, leading a party, left his horse behind for a night mission. Upon their return, they set up sentries and rested before advancing. At midnight, Jim reported a sighting of the bush rangers' camp, where the natives were joyous over gifts from the rangers. Just before dawn, the party moved towards the camp, attacking as the sunlight hit the hill. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in casualties on both sides. Despite losses, the colonists prevailed, forcing the natives to retreat up the hills.

Shortly after, the group set off. Although disappointed that the gang leader had escaped, they were pleased with the outcome and the minimal losses. There was sadness over Mr. Blount's death, but capturing the bush rangers was worth it. The journey was mostly uneventful, and Reuben was confident they wouldn't face trouble from the scattered tribe. After a break to rest and eat, they resumed. As they traveled, the sergeant spotted a potential ambush spot. Reuben agreed it was risky. When they neared the area, spears flew, and a skirmish ensued. The settlers and police had the upper hand due to their better weapons and firing positions. Despite a few attempts by the natives to rush them, the whites prevailed. With the threat diminishing, they regrouped, tended to their wounds, and continued on horseback.|"[""1.

Reuben, the sergeant, passed on the leadership to another and rode ahead with his son, concerned about the escaped man. Taking four fresh horses from the bush rangers, they set off in the dark. Reuben bid farewell and rode through the night, changing horses every ten miles. Reaching a water hole, signs of the fugitive were discovered, spurring them forward. Resting briefly, they continued at a moderate pace, arriving at an outlying station. Provided with fresh horses and a meal, they sped off with renewed energy, relieved to be galloping swiftly towards their destination. Reuben's worries eased as they approached the Donalds' station, confident in the support of the constables and the safety of his family.|"[""1.

As Reuben rode swiftly towards the horseman, he questioned if his concern for Kate Ellison was wise. Why divert from his journey's end to chase a distant figure? Could it be a stockman or a neighbor? He altered course to intercept the rider ahead. When the man emerged from the trees, Reuben realized it was a fellow soldier. Determined, he urged his horse on, leaving his companion behind. The open plain offered no escape for the fugitive. Reuben shouted in triumph as he closed in. The bush ranger, confident in his shooting skills, halted and awaited Reuben's approach.

With a pistol in hand, the ranger threatened. Reuben halted, pondering his next move. The ranger, noticing Reuben was an officer, not a constable, reacted fiercely.
