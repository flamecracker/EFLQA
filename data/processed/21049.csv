Janet and Teddy were playing by the brook, imagining their toy ships were laden with treasures like gold, diamonds, and chocolate cake. Teddy, pretending to be a pirate, accidentally spilled his cargo of stones and sticks into the water. Janet, not wanting to play the scary pirate game, pushed her ship filled with pretend treasures. As she tried to sail away from Teddy, she accidentally tipped her ship, losing her cargo too. Trouble, their little brother, joined in, adding to the fun with his baby talk. Janet explained to Trouble that the chocolate cake was only make-believe. Despite the mishaps, the children enjoyed their imaginative play by the brook, even if their treasures ended up soggy.|"['1.

Teddy and Janet were playing with their toy ships by the brook. Teddy, pretending to be a pirate, had a ship with swords and guns. Janet hesitated to send out her ship, making Teddy lose interest in being a pirate. As they prepared for a race to the water-wheel, Trouble, their little brother, wanted a bigger ship.

"Once again, Trouble, Ted, and Janet sat in the back seat, while their parents rode in the front. Trouble didn't have his red balloon this time, which he usually enjoyed blowing up until it popped loudly. The children chatted, curious about why Uncle Toby needed their father to come and handle something. ""What's all this fun about?"" their mother inquired from the front, hoping to prevent any mischief. As they drove to Pocono, a small city, and arrived at Uncle Toby's shabby but once-grand house, a strange old lady warned them not to enter.

"Uncle Toby had a noisy ""menagerie"" with trick dogs barking, a mewing Persian cat, a shrieking parrot, and a chattering monkey.

"""I'll tell you about it after we've fed them,"" said Mrs. Watson. ""They'll be quieter after they're fed, and you might as well start in now to give them something to eat. If you're going to take 'em with you and keep 'em you'll have to feed 'em.""

With the help of Ted and Janet, who set out food to the dogs and cat, Uncle Toby's animals were soon all being given things to eat, and this made them quiet.

""He wasn't, when I first came here to keep house for him,"" explained Mrs. Watson. ""But he made friends, once, with a sailor, who had the parrot. When the sailor started off on his next sea voyage, and didn't want to take Mr. Nip, the parrot, with him, Uncle Toby said the bird could stay here.

Uncle Toby asked the narrator to watch over his collection of pets, which included pigeons, dogs, a cat, a monkey, a parrot, an alligator, and some white rats and mice. The housekeeper, Mrs. Watson, was supposed to stay until the Curlytops arrived to take care of the animals. However, Daddy Martin expressed concern about keeping so many pets, especially since they already had a dog and a cat and had recently rehomed a goat and a pony. Mrs. Watson explained that Uncle Toby wanted Daddy Martin to care for the pets permanently if he never returned.

In a moment, objections arose from Ted and Janet as they dashed into the room from playing with the animals. Daddy Martin glanced at his wife. Then, Tip and Top, the dogs, performed some of their best tricks. Tip somersaulted while Top walked on his hind legs and barked on cue. A boy named Bob Nelson arrived, asking for the pigeons promised by Uncle Toby. Mrs. Martin suggested selling the pets and donating the money to a children's home. Bob, content with the pigeons, shared how he cared for them with Uncle Toby.

When the Curlytops and Trouble returned to Uncle Toby's house, they found Daddy Martin by the kitchen stove with a fire burning. He was petting the Persian cat, Snuff, who was purring happily. The three dogs, Skyrocket, Tip, and Top, were snoozing by the fire. In another room, the mice, rats, alligator, monkey, and parrot were all calm, much to Mrs. Martin's surprise. Daddy Martin parked the car in the yard, and the family settled in for the night. The children were too excited about the pets to sleep early. The animals seemed to enjoy the children's company. Mr. Nip the parrot let Jan pet him, and Jack the monkey behaved well around Trouble. Snuff bonded with Mr. Martin, and the dogs played with the kids. The family decided to take the pets home with them rather than sell them, ensuring Uncle Toby's wishes were respected.|"[""1.

After the policeman left, the house grew quiet until morning. Post-breakfast, the water was shut off, and Uncle Toby's home was readied for closure until his return. The parrot, monkey's box, Slider's tank, and the wire cage with white mice and rats were loaded into the spacious automobile, along with the Curlytops and their new pets. Despite the odd collection, the children were content. On their way back to Cresco, they stopped for lunch. Concerned about their pets escaping, Mr. Martin enlisted a young man to watch over them. However, upon returning, they discovered Tip, the white poodle, missing. The young man, seemingly kind-hearted, was as surprised as the children. Trouble, occupied with Snuff the cat, was unfazed. Mr. Martin inquired about the young man's presence and was assured that he had remained vigilant, except for a moment when he felt something rough on his neck.|"['1.

A tall young man named Shorty was explaining how a little alligator scratched his neck. He had been watching the animals in an auto when a white poodle named Tip went missing. Shorty felt sorry for not noticing Tip leaving. Mr. Martin, the father of the Curlytops, asked Shorty to search for Tip down the street. Shorty agreed and promised to do his best to find the missing dog. Mr. Martin suspected that Shorty might have let someone take Tip, but he hoped Tip had just wandered off to see another dog. As Shorty went to search, Mr. Martin had to stop Slider, the pet alligator, from escaping. He looked forward to getting Uncle Toby's menagerie safely home.|"['1.

Mr. Martin and his family were on their way back home with a variety of pets in their car. They had a parrot, a monkey named Jack, white mice and rats, and even an alligator in a tank. However, they realized that their trick dog, Tip, was missing. Despite looking for Tip and Shorty, another missing animal helper, they couldn't find them. Mr. Martin suspected that Shorty might have had a hand in Tip's disappearance. Nevertheless, the family decided to continue their journey back home to Cresco. Teddy, one of the children, suggested that they could put on a show with their pets to earn some money.

The Curlytops arrived home just before dinner. They were busy settling Uncle Toby's pets in the barn, ensuring they were safe for the night. Despite the commotion, Ted and Janet momentarily forgot about their missing pet, Tip. They had so many other pets now that they were occupied. However, they still longed for Tip's return. As the night progressed, the pets were settled in the barn, fed, and given water. Suddenly, in the middle of the night, screams from Mrs. Blake's house next door startled Ted and Janet awake. Mrs. Blake, a widow living alone, was frightened by a possible intruder. Ted and Janet's parents, alerted by the commotion, rushed to Mrs. Blake's aid along with other concerned neighbors. Mrs. Blake believed she had seen a burglar in her room, leading to a tense situation that required investigation.|"[""1.

Mr. Martin, the father of the Curlytops, revealed the mystery intruder under the chair - Jack, Uncle Toby's pet monkey. Mrs. Blake mistook Jack for a burglar due to his fuzzy appearance. Mr. Martin explained that Jack was one of the children's pets that used to belong to Uncle Toby. The family had recently brought Jack home to join the other animals in the barn. Mr. Martin emphasized the need to ensure the animals don't cause trouble for the neighbors, especially at night. He suggested locking cages and securing the barn to prevent any late-night escapades. The Curlytops were entrusted with the responsibility of caring for the pets, including a parrot, another dog and cat, an alligator, and white mice.

Uncle Toby's poodle delighted Ted and Janet with his performance in the barn. The poodle sneezed after walking on his hind legs in a circle, showcasing two tricks. Teddy wished for a list of all the tricks the dogs could do for their circus. The little pet alligator, Slider, surprised everyone by sliding down a smooth board, which Teddy saw as a potential circus trick. Meanwhile, the siblings' cat, Turnover, needed medical attention, and Skyrocket, the dog, had been treated with home remedies before. Despite wanting to help, Teddy's sister insisted he stay with her to watch Slider perform his sliding trick.|"['1.

Janet and Trouble were having fun with Slider the alligator when Teddy called them from the barn. Snuff, the yellowish-brown cat, was showing off his skills on a football in the yard. Snuff balanced on the leather ball, rolling around like a circus clown. Teddy speculated that Snuff might have learned this trick from Uncle Toby or his previous owner. The ball was left out by Trouble, and Snuff remembered how to perform the trick on it. Unlike dogs or horses, reptiles like alligators, turtles, and snakes cannot be trained to do tricks due to their small brains. While the children enjoyed watching Snuff's playful antics, they knew it was more of a natural instinct than a learned behavior.|"['1.

Teddy and Janet were playing with their pets when Trouble wandered off to the barn. Trouble found Slider, the alligator, and wanted to make him slide more. As Trouble stood near the cage, Mrs. Johnson saw a big snake near her baby's carriage and panicked. She thought the snake would sting her baby, Ruth.

"Mrs. Johnson exclaimed, ""There it is! Look!"" as she pointed with one hand while holding Ruth close. The baby, abruptly awakened, was on the verge of tears.

At the dog show tent, an unexpected turn of events unfolded on the platform. The black poodle named King started circling in the center stage, while another poodle began leaping over King's back.

Professor Montelli, the trainer, grew furious when the children called the poodles to them. He claimed that their poodles were white, unlike his black ones. However, a mishap occurred when King, the black poodle, accidentally splashed into a pail of water, revealing streaks of black and white fur. This revelation led Ted and Janet to assert that the poodles were indeed theirs, having been taken and dyed by a young man.

Mrs. Martin shared with the ladies who requested her help to raise funds for orphans that the Curlytops planned to donate all the proceeds from their circus show to support the underprivileged children. Many people, both adults and children, bought tickets upon hearing this. The event was set for an afternoon, requiring extensive preparation. The parents of the Curlytops' friends assisted, leaving Ted and Janet in charge of training the animals for their performances. Jack Turton was to be a chubby clown riding a pony, while Harry Kent and others aided Teddy. Jan's friends offered their help too. Trouble was set to make a quirky entrance with his pets.
