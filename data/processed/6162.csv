Herbert was on his way back home, nearing the small cottage where he lived. The house, although small, had a bit of land where they grew vegetables. It was technically his mother's, but half its value was mortgaged to Squire Leech, James's father. The mortgage amount was exactly seven hundred and fifty dollars, half of what it cost Herbert's father to build it. Herbert had hoped to pay it off gradually, but his father's sudden passing made it impossible. With the annual interest of forty-five dollars, it added to their already tight budget for necessities. To help out, Herbert earned a bit by delivering letters for neighbors. Although not much, it was a welcomed income.

Mrs. Carter, speaking calmly, suggested not dwelling on the matter of her uncle's passing. She felt it was best to avoid high hopes to prevent disappointment. Acknowledging her busy schedule and the distance of twenty miles to the funeral, she felt someone should represent the family. Naming her son Herbert after the deceased uncle, she decided he should attend. Herbert, understanding the financial strain, saw the trip as an opportunity to save money by walking. Despite the lack of a close relationship with his uncle, Herbert energetically chopped wood for his mother. Mrs. Carter, aware of her uncle's selfish nature, did not expect to inherit anything. Herbert, hopeful for a financial boost, even dreamt of a large gold lump left by his uncle.|"[""1.

Herbert hurriedly dressed and had a quick breakfast before setting out on his journey to Randolph, a place he had never been to before. He packed some leftovers from breakfast in his bag as he couldn't afford to buy lunch. Along the road, guideposts helped him find his way. As he walked, a coach passed by, and Herbert recognized James Leech, a boy from his town, on top. James, usually proud, was surprisingly friendly and mentioned he was visiting a wealthy friend in Randolph. Herbert, proud in his own way, brushed off James' attitude. Herbert eventually reached Randolph and had a simple lunch outside the village. After freshening up by a brook, he inquired about his late uncle's residence but decided to wait until after the funeral preparations. Resting under a tree, a well-dressed young man with flashy accessories approached him.|"['1.

Cornelius, a salesman at a dry-goods store, met Herbert at a funeral. They discovered they were distant relatives of the deceased, Mr. Carter. Mrs. Pinkerton, a milliner, and her husband, Josiah, hoped to inherit part of Mr. Carter's estate. Josiah, working as her clerk, feared his wife's dominance. Alonzo Granger, a farmer, and Miss Nancy Carter, the deceased's sister, were also present. Miss Nancy depended on her brother's pension and knitting for income. The other mourners were more interested in potential inheritances than in mourning Mr. Carter. Herbert felt little sorrow for a man who had neglected his mother in life.|"['1.

A generous man named Mr. Carter left his property to the town of Randolph to establish a high school named the Carter School. The lady, unhappy with her share, expressed her disappointment. The lawyer, though, was firm in his decision. Meanwhile, Herbert received Mr. Carter's wardrobe as a legacy. The lady, after some thought, decided to accept her share to save on expenses. Herbert, with only seventy-five cents, worried about staying at a hotel. Mr. Spencer, impressed by Herbert, invited him for supper with his sons. At supper, Herbert was treated equally, much to James' discomfort. Later, the boys enjoyed ripe peaches behind the house, with Herbert feeling content despite James' indifference.|"['1.

Mr. Spencer unlocked a small black trunk with brass nails, revealing woolen clothes inside. He showed a blue coat with brass buttons, recalling how it belonged to James's uncle.

Meanwhile, Mrs. Carter awaited Herbert's return eagerly, hopeful for a legacy. She praised her daughter's independence and the lawyer's kindness.

Squire Leech resided in a grand, white house atop a hill, the finest in the village. The house boasted bay windows, a flower-lined path, a summerhouse, and exquisite furnishings. In a room used as an office and sitting area, Squire Leech and his new superintendent, Amos Banks, discussed hiring a new farm worker. The squire managed his properties and needed help with his farms and investments. Banks suggested his cousin for the job, a hardworking man seeking steady employment. The squire, more concerned about profits than people, considered evicting Mrs. Carter, a struggling seamstress, to gain her property.

Squire Leech had his eye on the Carter's home, plotting to take it from them. He tried to persuade Mrs. Carter to sell, offering a sum that was far below what the house meant to her. Despite his efforts, Mrs. Carter stood firm, valuing the memories and comfort her home provided. Squire Leech, driven by greed, continued to press, even increasing his offer.

Squire Leech hesitated to give up his plan to purchase the house from Mrs. Carter. He believed Herbert was blocking his way, so he visited the widow when he knew Herbert was out. Despite his insistence that he was only trying to help her, Mrs. Carter kindly refused. This angered Squire Leech, surprising Mrs. Carter with his reaction. She didn't realize his true intentions. When Mrs. Carter fell ill for three months, Herbert took care of her and managed the household. By April, she recovered, but their financial situation was dire. The legacy money was nearly gone. Squire Leech persisted in wanting the house for Nahum Brown, offering cash and pressuring Herbert to convince his mother to sell.

After speaking with Squire Leech, Herbert walked home, deep in thought. He realized the danger of their situation. The squire wanted their house for less than it was worth, a small sum for him but significant for the widow he sought to cheat. The squire even hinted at foreclosure if they couldn't pay the interest. Herbert's mother feared they might have to sell their home, a heartbreaking prospect. Herbert knew he needed to find work to help his family. In the village, he visited Mr. Crane, a carpenter, who owned land but lacked time to cultivate it.

With his mother's approval, Herbert set to work on the field near their cottage, focusing on planting potatoes and other vegetables for market. Despite doubts from others, Herbert was resolute in his efforts. As he toiled in the field, a skeptical observer, James Leech, watched from afar.

Herbert, pondering the upcoming due interest, found himself short by $9.50, with only $13 raised. He suggested borrowing $10 to pay the interest and ease their worries for six months. Despite doubts, he sought help, but villagers lacked funds. The landlord suggested Herbert assist a wealthy young man, Mr. Cameron, who needed a companion and reader due to eye issues.

Although he expected Herbert to be downcast, he was surprised to see him in good spirits. The squire, feeling a bit puzzled, thought maybe they had accepted his offer. Frustrated, the squire finalized the deal, vowing to take over the property in the future. Before leaving, he scolded Herbert for his behavior. However, a kind gentleman named Cameron intervened, explaining that the squire might have taken advantage of their lack of knowledge. Cameron, being familiar with cotton manufacturing, offered to evaluate Herbert's father's invention. Herbert, relieved, agreed to show Cameron the model, hoping for a positive outcome.|"['1.

Herbert started reading a treatise on logic as requested, initially finding it dull. However, upon rereading, he grasped the content. He questioned Cameron about the subject, struggling due to unfamiliarity. Despite mistakes, they laughed together. Though usually a college topic, Herbert, at fifteen, found political economy understandable. He engaged with the material, impressing as a makeshift professor. Reflecting on his own father's rags-to-riches story, Herbert discussed the possibility of James attending college. The squire's son, interpreting it as a compliment, praised Herbert's rowing skills. Cameron critiqued their rowing, and Herbert improved with guidance. The squire hesitated to ask for help from Mr. Temple, fearing it was due to their past friendship. He eventually inquired about Mr. Temple's fortunes.|['1.

Squire Leech was a greedy man who loved making money. He had used every chance to grow his wealth. Feeling like he was moving too slowly, he hoped his friend Temple could help him double his money. Excited to see Temple, he introduced him to his family. James, his son, wished they lived in New York for better society. After supper, they discussed investing in a mining stock that could triple in value. The squire, impressed by the idea, saw it as a gold mine.

A simple stroll led them to the pond's edge. Herbert searched for James Leech's boat, only to find two instead of one. Feeling perturbed, Herbert wondered how James could be so bold after he had forbidden him from using his boat. In his haste, James failed to notice that the boat was not his. Convinced that he was the only one with a boat on the pond, James contemplated reporting Herbert for using his property without permission. However, as they rowed side by side, James realized his mistake when he saw his own boat moored nearby. Despite feeling envious of Herbert's new boat, James's father promised to buy him a sailboat if he did well in the future.

Thank you for your kind words. I am excited to meet your mother and believe I will have a better time than at Squire Leech's dinner. It's not about the fancy setting, but the good company. Why is James leaving so soon?” Mrs. Carter liked Cameron. Despite his social advantages, he never acted superior and showed no condescension, unlike some rude individuals. “He drank more cups than we do now, but back then, the cups were smaller. So, his drinking wasn't excessive after all. His overeating, however, was less forgivable.” Herbert took Cameron to his father's workshop, where a significant invention was stored. Cameron inspected it carefully and gave a positive review. He offered to show it to his father, stating it could benefit his business. Herbert lamented his father's passing, saying they expected more years with him. Cameron praised Herbert's dedication to his mother and promised to remain a loyal friend. The evening ended well, and Cameron left at nine. On his way back, James Leech, feeling humiliated, planned revenge on Herbert for standing up to him.|"[""1.
