Lilias quietly left, shedding tears. She understood Cousin Clare's harsh judgment was fair, yet doubted she grasped Everard's deep disappointment. Feeling no desire to speak further or ask questions, Lilias waited for the sorrowful ordeal to end. After the funeral, some guests returned to hear Mr. Bowden read the late Squire's will.

The new student at school seemed unenthusiastic about the usual classes and activities. Gowan Barbour attempted to teach her cricket without much success.

Look, there's one fishing in the lake."" They climbed to a hill-side with rhododendrons and a summer-house. The view of the crimson slope and gleaming lake delighted them.

Carmel confidently proposed a plan to swap chauffeurs, assigning Milner to the Rogers temporarily and Everard to drive her, Cousin Clare, Lilias, and Dulcie back to Cheverley Chase. She was determined to have her way and succeeded in persuading those involved. Everard, influenced by a conversation with Major Rogers, expressed newfound respect for him and a willingness to follow his advice. Everard's return home prompted discussions about his future, with plans for tutoring to catch up on studies before potentially attending Cambridge. Major Rogers recommended Mr. Stacey, a scholarly and kind tutor, to assist Everard during this transitional period.

The three girls returned to school the next day, feeling a mix of sadness to leave the Chase but also excitement to reunite with their friends. Carmel, having overcome her homesickness, now enjoyed Chilcombe and had made many new friends. She was determined to make the most of the autumn term, bringing materials for her hobbies and organizing her belongings in her room. With the door to the Blue Grotto open, she chatted with her friends while settling in. Gowan, busy unpacking, shared information, while Bertha fluttered around like a butterfly.

At Carmel's suggestion, they formed 'The Chilcombe Mafia,' a secret group with mysterious intentions. The initiation was a solemn affair in the woods, where they pledged loyalty in secrecy. Using red ink, they signed a paper and buried it as a symbol of their commitment. Phillida highlighted the importance of keeping their oath by creating a lasting record. However, Laurette's behavior raised suspicions among the group, leading to accusations of dishonesty and manipulation. Gowan confronted Laurette for betraying Miss Herbert's trust by sharing confidential information.

Gowan expressed her frustration towards Laurette, criticizing her for being outdated and suggesting that one day people would make fun of her. Despite Laurette's attempts to interrupt, Gowan continued her tirade. Laurette's friends, Truie, Hester, and Muriel, distanced themselves from the situation, focusing on their books instead. Gowan's harsh words sparked a feud between her and Laurette, leading to sympathy towards Miss Herbert from the rest of the group.

The Mafia members gathered in their schoolroom after dark, ready for some mysterious fun. They used chestnuts for divination, balancing them on the fire grate. Each girl secretly chose a chestnut representing her crush. The chestnuts popped and cracked, revealing their fates. Some were pleased, while others were disappointed. Next, they tried apple peel magic to find the initial of their future loves. The girls carefully peeled the apples, hoping for a clear letter. Some struggled with the task, but all were eager for the results. Gowan suggested trying more advanced witchcraft by pulling a cabbage stalk, but they decided to save it for another time.

Nine girls giggled as they snuck downstairs, delayed by Prissie, who insisted on getting a wrap. They peeked out into the clear night with a full moon and drifting clouds. The vegetable garden was close, making the ceremony quick. Leaving after dark broke the rules, but the temptation was too strong. Prissie had a secret plan. She put on a coat, hat, and a fake mustache, then slipped behind the bushes to surprise her friends. While the girls pulled cabbage stalks to predict their future husbands, Gowan saw the figure with the mustache and gasped. Prissie revealed herself, but then they hid as Laurette approached with her mirror to try the magic of Halloween.

"Prissie, watching silently, realized this was a rare opportunity. She quietly left her hiding spot and peeked over Laurette's shoulder, ensuring her reflection appeared in the mirror. Laurette, suddenly startled by the unexpected sight of a dark mustache, screamed in terror, jumped up, and turned to face her ""ghost."" With another chilling scream, she ran towards the house. The Mafia, emerging from the shadows, chuckled cautiously. Prissie grabbed the mirror, and the group of girls fled through a different path to avoid the servants, managing to sneak upstairs unseen. They placed the mirror back in the Gold bedroom as a surprise for Laurette. The next day, Laurette acted aloof when they mentioned Halloween, but Prissie suspected she was hiding her true feelings. The weather during ""All Saints'"" brought a touch of golden sunshine, with flowers blooming and butterflies fluttering.

As Christmas approached, the school shifted its focus from charitable activities to creating gifts for family and friends. Students worked diligently on sewing projects that had been neglected all term, with a sudden surge in needlework. Miss Walters allowed a select group to go on a shopping trip to Glazebrook for supplies, based on their academic performance. A group of girls walked to town to buy materials, spending time in fancy-work shops and other stores. Unexpectedly, Joyce and two others got a ride back with a friend, leaving Carmel behind. Carmel, realizing she forgot chocolates, hurried to buy them but couldn't find her classmates afterward. She discovered they had left without her, thinking she was already in the car.|"[""1.

Carmel found herself four and a half miles away from school with no option but to walk back unless she could find a taxi. Being unfamiliar with England due to her Sicilian background, she was hesitant to travel alone. Despite feeling scared and out of place, she decided to walk back. As she journeyed, she encountered fog that made her surroundings eerie and disorienting. The mist obscured the familiar landscape, causing her to lose her way. Eventually, she stumbled upon a body of water that blocked her path. Frightened, she retraced her steps in search of the main road, hoping to find her way back before darkness fell.|"[""1.

A strange and eerie atmosphere enveloped Carmel as she found herself alone in the misty moonlight. The fog cleared slightly, revealing a landscape of mysterious shadows. Shapes resembling a vast lake and ghostly structures emerged in the distance, resembling an enchanted castle. Memories of fairy tales flooded her mind, and she felt a deep sense of fear. Recalling a haunting poem, she recited lines about the Erl-King. Overwhelmed by fear, she longed for human company and was startled by a dark figure and the sound of approaching hooves. Terrified, she cried out and trembled against a hedge until a rider approached. Finding comfort in Everard's presence, Carmel's fear subsided, and she rode back to safety, feeling relieved as she watched him depart.|"['1.

During Christmas at Cheverley Chase, the Ingleton children, along with Cousin Clare and Mr. Stacey, had a delightful time. Mr. Stacey was adored by all for his knowledge and fun nature. He helped Bevis with his stamp collection, Clifford with his insects, and even taught Lilias to use a typewriter. His presence brought harmony and joy, making the holidays more pleasant. Mr. Stacey organized activities like skating on the lawn and scouting in the woods, which everyone enjoyed. Everard, who had changed positively after working as a chauffeur, was no longer bossy. Even Carmel, who became friends with Everard, learned about English country life from him. She admired his knowledge and planned to hand over the estate to him when she turned twenty-one.|['1.

Carmel and Everard had a passionate discussion about his future plans. Carmel was convinced that Everard would make a name for himself, either as the head of the family or in some other significant way. Everard, on the other hand, felt the weight of responsibility to his younger siblings and acknowledged his shortcomings. Shortly after, Lilias fell ill due to the damp climate, requiring a change to a warmer place. This led to arrangements being made for the family to visit Casa Bianca in Montalesso, Sicily. The trip was seen as a much-needed break for Everard to study and for the family to explore Sicily together.

Princess Carmel's persuasive skills effortlessly secured the agreement of Mr. Bowden and Miss Walters for their travel plans. Cousin Clare's support and the enthusiasm of Mr. Stacey and Everard added to the excitement. Deciding to sail on the _Clytie_ from Liverpool to Malta, the group aimed to reach Sicily by local vessel. The sea voyage was considered better for Lilias than a train journey, and everyone found the idea of a new experience appealing. Thanks to Mr. Greville's influence, they secured cabins on the 6,000-ton steamer without delay. The ship's layout amazed them, from the dining-saloon to the steward's pantry. Despite the cramped sleeping quarters, they made the best of it by organizing their belongings meticulously. As the _Clytie_ set sail, the passengers bid farewell to England, eager for the adventures that lay ahead.|"[""1.

The first day aboard the ship _Clytie_ went smoothly for the Ingleton family. They enjoyed dinner, socialized with other passengers, and played games on deck. The calm passage made them feel fortunate until they hit a storm in the Bay of Biscay. Initially, the girls found the rocking ship amusing, but as the storm worsened, they fell ill with seasickness. The violent waves tossed the ship around like a toy. Possessions flew about the cabin, and the noise of the storm was deafening. The girls were too ill to care about the danger. The storm raged on, and even the crew had to be secured to the ship. The girls, feeling unwell, were confined to their cabins.

During their voyage on the Mediterranean, time passed quickly and pleasantly for Lilias and her companions. The sea air improved Lilias's health, easing her cough and boosting her appetite. Lilias was sad to leave the ship when they arrived at Valetta, Malta. The Ingleton family spent the day exploring Valetta, marveling at its fortified harbors, gardens, cathedral, and historical sites. They appreciated hearing English spoken and seeing British warships in the harbor. Despite exhaustion, they awaited the midnight mail-boat to Syracuse. After a tiring day of sightseeing, they rested at a hotel before embarking on a boat to the mail-steamer. The night was beautiful with the moon and stars reflecting in the harbor. The rough sea made the journey uncomfortable, but they arrived safely in Syracuse and continued their travels by train to Carmel's home in Montalesso.|['1.

Mr. Greville welcomed the Ingletons warmly at Targia Vecchia, with Carmel rushing into his arms. They were whisked away to the Casa Bianca, a white stone house surrounded by a garden of exotic plants. The Ingletons were greeted by a large group of Carmel's family members, a mix of English and Italian heritage. The hospitality at Casa Bianca made the Ingletons feel like part of the family. The children explored the garden with Dulcie, admiring the marble fountain and orange groves. The Grevilles were fruit merchants with orchards and vineyards, creating a unique blend of northern and southern cultures. The Ingletons settled into the Casa Bianca, with Lilias resting on the piazza and the others enjoying the beautiful surroundings.|"['1.

In early March, Dulcie was amazed by the warm Sicilian sunshine and the abundance of flowers, including pink geraniums and white lilies. The atmosphere was genial and Mr. Greville was kind to his guests. Lilias began to appreciate Sicily's charm. The young people explored groves of orange and lemon trees, admiring the almond blossoms against the blue sky. They saw the sea at Targia Vecchia and the majestic peak of Etna. The group, including Ernesto and Douglas, enjoyed a picnic and marveled at the beauty of Montalesso in spring. Lilias felt a bit uneasy at the sight of smoke from Etna's crater. The young friends reveled in the beauty of Sicily, its landscapes, and the warmth of its people.|"['1.

English individuals frequently exhibit fear towards the ancient volcano, Etna, always anticipating an eruption for their amusement. However, the emitted smoke serves as a precautionary measure, so there is no need for alarm. The observatory provides alerts in the event of any impending danger. While some locals evacuate the area in time, others choose to safeguard their belongings. At Montalesso, located fifteen miles away, the clear air creates an illusion of proximity to the peak, ensuring our safety. Transitioning from lemon groves and almond blossoms, the landscape transforms into a grassy plateau where goats graze. The goatherds, resembling characters from ancient Greek literature, play reed pipes. The picturesque plain is adorned with vibrant wildflowers, including anemones, irises, pimpernel, salvia, grape hyacinths, and narcissus. Among them, the pale pink asphodel blossoms stand out prominently. Mr. Stacey recounts the myth of Proserpine and Pluto, highlighting the immortal significance of the asphodel. The tale unfolds in the Golden Age, where Ceres' daughter, Proserpine, is abducted by Pluto, becoming queen of the underworld. Jupiter's intervention allows Proserpine to split her time between Hades and Earth, symbolizing the changing seasons. Sir Frederick Leighton's painting, 'The Return of Persephone,' captures this poignant reunion between mother and daughter.|"['1.

The tale is an ancient myth from Greece, where Proserpine's time in Hades represents winter, with cold winds and few flowers, while her return symbolizes spring. This story, like many Greek myths, holds a deeper meaning akin to the Resurrection, suggesting that loved ones will return in a more glorious form. Early religions, such as the Egyptians and Greeks, initially grasped pure concepts of God but later faltered due to ignorance. The Greeks emphasized beauty over goodness, leading to a decline in their beliefs. The group's journey was to witness Proserpine's fountain, a special spring surrounded by papyrus. The boats rowed up the river, passing through lush greenery while Sicilian songs filled the air. Despite some tensions among the group, the excursion was enchanting for most, except for Everard, who sulked in the boat, feeling slighted.|"[""1.

Proserpine's fountain, where the boatmen guided them after a short row, was a deep, clear pool reflecting the blue sky, surrounded by papyrus and irises. It felt like a scene from ancient legends, where one could almost picture Pluto with his chariot and black horses taking the nymph to his dark realm. On the return journey, the second boat stopped to gather papyrus reeds, intriguing Dulcie. They learned to make parchment from the reeds, slicing and pressing them to create a coarse but authentic material. The Ingleton children were thrilled, painting Egyptian symbols on their creations. Papyrus crafting became a craze at Casa Bianca, with each cousin trying to outdo the others. Mr. Stacey excelled, creating intricate hieroglyphs. Lilias, enchanted with her personalized papyrus, dreamed of visiting the Nile.|"[""1.

The Ingletons had been staying at Casa Bianca in Sicily for a few weeks and were getting used to the Sicilian customs. They had visited many interesting places like the Castello, an old tower once used by brigands, the ancient Greek amphitheater, and the Temple of Neptune.
