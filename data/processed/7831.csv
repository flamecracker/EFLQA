During the reign of Charles II, often seen as a dark period in English history due to the Court's excesses, the nation actually flourished in trade and naval prowess. Despite the Court's extravagance, governmental issues, the Great Plague, and the London Fire, England's trade expanded significantly. Bravery at sea under notable figures like Prince Rupert led to victories that shifted commercial and naval dominance from Holland to England. A young lad in Holborn, mourning his neglectful father, Sir Aubrey Shenstone, found solace with the caring Lady Parton, whose husband was a former Cavalier. Despite Sir Aubrey's faults, he had some redeeming qualities, like sharing his last coin. Cyril, the lad, benefited from Lady Parton's nurturing and the teachings of a clergyman, experiencing a better upbringing than if left solely with his troubled father.|"[""1.

Cyril was a young lad who had to fend for himself after his father decided it was best for him to stay where he was rather than be with him. Despite worries about money, Cyril managed to sustain himself by selling a trinket his mother had given him. With the guidance of the Curé, he found work at a trader's office, impressing his employer with his skills. Eventually, Cyril received a letter from his father asking him to return to London.

He decided to make a change and find a new room as soon as possible. It didn't matter where, as long as it was different. He thought about the tradesmen he worked for. Maybe one of them had a small attic he could stay in instead of getting paid. Even if they didn't talk to him much, it would be better than being a complete stranger in a new place. The next day, he resumed his work, visiting shops and making up for lost time. His last stop was at a ship-chandler's in Tower Street. The owner, a one-armed man, had returned from years at sea and decided to settle down. He knew the needs of shipmasters and could bring in new customers. His father welcomed him back, offering a place for his wife and child too.|"['1.

I am a responsible citizen now, Mistress Nellie, and do not pretend to be anything else. Those carrying swords are either Court gentlemen, bullies, or highwaymen. Citizens carry swords at night for protection, but in the daytime, it's unnecessary. I'm too young to carry one, my cane is enough. Cyril, welcomed by Captain Dave and his wife, wasn't liked by the apprentices. Robert Ashford, who used to escort Nellie, disliked Cyril. The younger apprentice, Tom Frost, seemed anxious. Cyril suspected Robert of theft. Stock-taking was needed for profit assessment. Cyril explained the importance of a stock-book to Captain Dave. Cyril proposed a ledger for each item to track stock accurately. Captain Dave found an old stock-book but never found it useful.|"['1.

John Wilkes had just started a new sales-book, and Cyril needed to check some details from past records. He meticulously recorded the goods in stock and sales made in the ledger, comparing them to purchases. After a month of hard work, he finished on the same day as the stock-taking. Cyril asked Captain Dave for a private discussion, showing discrepancies in the accounts. He pointed out that heavy items matched but smaller items like ropes and copper were missing. The total value of the stock was significantly lower than expected, indicating a loss of £804 over fifteen months. Captain Dave was shocked but recognized the need to investigate further. Cyril's careful analysis revealed potential discrepancies that needed attention.|"['1.

Cyril was confident in his findings. He suggested that a city accountant could verify his figures. He doubted the apprentices' involvement, as it seemed unlikely they could have stolen items without John Wilkes noticing. Cyril advised involving John Wilkes discreetly to avoid alerting the apprentices. He proposed that the thieves might have found a way to access the store unnoticed. Captain Dave agreed but worried about John Wilkes's reaction if informed. Cyril suggested a discreet investigation, emphasizing the importance of verifying the accounts with an accountant. They discussed the possibility of an external entry point to the warehouse. They examined the yard from a back room, observing the surrounding area for clues about how the thefts might have occurred.|"['1.

Captain Dave and Cyril suspected a thief in their midst. The captain believed that a pirate had been stealing goods from their shop for over two thousand pounds. Cyril, after finding discrepancies in the books, brought this to the captain's attention. The captain planned to involve their first mate, John Wilkes, to investigate further. Despite John's initial disbelief, the evidence pointed to theft. The captain assured John that the figures did not add up, indicating that the theft had been ongoing for over fifteen months. To catch the thief, they decided to inspect the door and shutters of the warehouse when everyone was asleep.

John, if this list is accurate, it seems items have been disappearing without our knowledge. We need to find out how this is happening."" John replied, ""I've kept my records diligently, but it seems packages have been leaving unnoticed. We must investigate."" The Captain added, ""It's likely someone has been sneaking in at night.

"""I agree with you, Captain Dave,"" said John Wilkes. ""How the thieves make an entry, I can't imagine, but I don't think it's through the wall of the warehouse. The robberies must have been frequent, but in small amounts each time to avoid risk. We now know they come, so finding out how should be easier.""

Captain Dave nodded in agreement. He praised the idea of keeping suspicions of treachery to oneself until ready to confront the traitor. He planned to discuss the shed with John in the morning and involve Cyril later in the day. The yard, about sixty by twenty-five feet, was thoroughly examined for any signs of disturbance. The space had a crane and a loft that was now empty. Captain Dave and John measured the area, discussed the wall height, and inspected the gate leading to the lane. The conversation shifted to creating more space in the warehouse. Cyril noted the loft's trap-door but didn't think much of it. The night watch was arranged, with Captain Dave and Cyril taking turns to keep an eye out, ensuring security due to a looming storm.|"['1.

Cyril was assigned the first watch duty, with the Captain taking over at one o'clock. By nine, the family had gone to sleep. Fifteen minutes later, Cyril quietly descended from his attic to John Wilkes's room. The door was slightly open, and a candle was still lit. Cyril extinguished the candle and positioned himself by the window. Initially, the darkness obscured his vision, making him fear the warehouse could be robbed unnoticed. He cracked the window open slightly and, as his eyes adjusted, he discerned the warehouse's roof below. As time passed, he reminisced about his past in France and his friend Harry Parton's teachings. Upon hearing the bell strike ten and then eleven, Cyril suddenly stood up as he heard a scraping noise on the warehouse roof. He rushed to inform John Wilkes about two figures on the warehouse roof, suspecting them to be apprentices sneaking out. A lightning flash briefly revealed a figure on the roof, followed by thunder. Cyril speculated that Robert might be assisting the other person in entering the warehouse through the roof. John decided not to confront them that night, hoping it was just mischief and not something more serious.|"[""1.

"Half a minute later, a sudden gleam of light shone below, revealing an open door. Footsteps echoed, followed by light on the outer gate fastening, where two figures worked a key on the padlock. The gate swung open as the wooden bar was lifted. After a hushed conversation, the figures left and returned, securing the gate behind them. Inside the warehouse, the light vanished, and the door closed. ""They've outwitted us cleverly,"" remarked one. ""Let's close the casement to avoid suspicion,"" suggested another.

John Wilkes explained his decision to wait before catching the criminals, as he wanted to capture the main culprits who had tempted his apprentices to steal. After a week of surveillance, they caught the apprentices and the receivers of the stolen goods with the help of the watchmen, his foreman, and Master Cyril Shenstone.

Shortly after, a boat with four men arrived to transfer the cargo silently. The captain planned to sail to Ipswich on the next tide, aiming to avoid delays. Cyril, recovering from a head injury, rested on the locker. The crew soon set sail, towing the boat due to a fading breeze.

Captain Dave insisted on clearing the table before allowing Cyril to recount his adventure. Once settled, Cyril shared his tale, evoking pity from some and anger from the Captain upon learning of Black Dick's escape to Holland. Captain Dave praised Cyril's narrow escape from the villains, particularly Black Dick, known for his crimes in London. Cyril hesitated to reveal details that could harm the captain who saved him. The next day, they visited the Guildhall, where Cyril's silence about the captain's identity raised suspicions. However, Captain Dave defended Cyril's decision, highlighting the importance of keeping promises and the risk of future harm if promises were broken.

The Alderman expressed his regret upon learning the news. He had hoped the culprits were still hidden in the City, with a chance for the constables to apprehend them. However, he anticipated their return soon. The wrongdoer would likely come back seeking more gain or due to familiarity with the area. The Alderman assured that if caught by the City Constables, they wouldn't escape again. Cyril was advised to remain cautious even with this knowledge. The interruption caused by Marner's capture might prompt others to harm him. The loss of a market would inconvenience them, as they could easily sell melted-down goods but struggle with bulkier items. Cyril escorted Nellie to St. Paul's to hear a renowned preacher. The cathedral served as a meeting place for people of all backgrounds. As they walked through the crowd, Nellie encountered a man from Court who assisted her earlier. Cyril, protective of her, expressed concerns about the man's intentions. He emphasized the need for proper introductions through her father.

There was a lot of talk about it, father, the night I visited Dame King's. Some gentlemen present had dealings in the East, with one even having shares in the English Company trading there. After supper, they discussed the matter at length, disappointing some of us who had hoped for dancing or singing. Dame King seemed perturbed that her husband had brought in the unexpected guests. However, the conversation intrigued us, focusing on the renewed friendship between England and Spain, resulting in increased commerce. The Dutch's actions sparked tensions, leading to reprisals by Sir Robert Holmes, capturing Dutch forts and ships. The Dutch retaliated, causing significant damage.

The watch must have been asleep, leading to a surprise attack on the ship. The crew was captured, and the vessel's cargo was stolen. Young Pettigrew took responsibility, feeling guilty for the mishap. Despite the dire situation, the captain encouraged Pettigrew to think of a plan to escape. The crew was tied up and locked in a dark place on the ship. The captain reassured Pettigrew that it was not solely his fault and that they needed to focus on finding a way out. They discussed freeing themselves, reaching the rest of the crew, and fighting back to regain control of the ship. The captain emphasized the importance of taking action and trying to escape rather than giving up hope.|"[""1.

After talking, we agreed that the Moors might not come down for a while, assuming we could endure without food or water until they reached Tunis. We then focused on loosening our ropes. Wriggling didn't work, so we struggled until the cords cut into our skin. It took a while to reach the knife. Eventually, I found the string behind his neck, grabbed it with my teeth, and pulled until the knife reached his throat. John then grabbed it with his teeth, and the hard part was over. Next was simple. John held the knife's handle, Pettigrew the blade, and together they managed to open it. After some effort, Pettigrew got the knife in his hands. I moved back and forth until the blade cut through my wrist's rope, freeing us. We discovered the boarding between us and the main hold was weak. With the knife and our strength, we removed a board. Pettigrew, the smallest, crawled through, and we got another plank down. The hold was partly filled with cargo. We searched quietly for weapons but only found kegs of powder. Without arms, we decided to wait until night to seize the ship. We planned to fill the lazaret with bales and a keg of powder to blow up the cabin above if necessary. We identified the main hatch as our only escape route. Pettigrew suggested using a slow match to blast the cabin overhead while preventing the ship's bottom from blowing out.|"[""1.

Very carefully, we gathered packages and bales below the hatchway, creating a platform about four feet under it. We planned to stand together, lift the hatchway, and swiftly escape. Pettigrew convinced us to proceed with the plan under both hatches, suggesting the explosions would cause chaos among the crew. After preparing powder kegs with fuses, we waited under the main hatch, ready to ignite them if the crew attempted to open the hatches. We cut the woodwork around the staple to gauge the light above. Despite the heat and thirst, I urged the men to wait until nightfall. Once darkness fell, we heard the first explosion aft, followed by chaos on the deck. We quickly removed the hatch and escaped, encountering minimal resistance as most of the crew had been incapacitated by the explosions.|['1.

The second explosion was more destructive, as the crew, in their panic, rushed forward. Many jumped overboard, leaving behind weapons on the deck. Frenzied and thirsty, some men charged at the Moors, who quickly leaped into the water. The fire was extinguished after a quarter of an hour, revealing Pettigrew dead from a gunshot. The crew regrouped to recapture the barque, now a short distance away. The vessels were running before the wind, with the barque slightly ahead. The crew armed themselves and closed in on the barque. The Moors, scared by the explosion, did not retaliate. The crew lashed the corsair to the barque and boarded it triumphantly.|"[""1.

As they passed through Cheapside, many people were rushing in the same direction, curious about the fire's location. A Fire Company, equipped with buckets, ladders, and axes, sprinted past them. Even in Cheapside, the glow of the fire ahead was visible, but it wasn't until they reached the top of Ludgate Hill, after passing St. Paul's, that the flames shooting high into the air became apparent. The crowd thickened as they neared Temple Bar. Women leaned out of open upper windows, observing the spectacle. Men poured into the street from every lane and alley, adding to the bustling crowd. The fire, located at a mansion in the Savoy, was still some distance away. Another Fire Company arrived near the spot, working alongside City officials, gentlemen, and soldiers to contain the flames threatening nearby houses.

Cyril expressed his excitement at the possibility of a promising future. He pondered the chance of securing a position through a powerful friend at the Admiralty.

During a fierce naval battle, the English and Dutch fleets clashed with equal strength. Admirals Tromp and De Ruyter led the Dutch, while Monk and Deane commanded the English. In the heat of the fight, a Dutch chain-shot fatally wounded Admiral Deane. Monk, witnessing the tragedy, covered Deane with his cloak to conceal his death from the fleet, preventing a morale drop. Despite the loss, the English managed to gain an upper hand, causing the Dutch to retreat after a long battle. The English pursued, but bad weather intervened.

Around two o'clock, the officers yelled that the Dutch were retreating. They fled in disarray, and some of our lighter ships chased them. The Dutch Admiral fought fiercely until our heavier ships arrived and he was defeated. We had little time to watch the pursuit as our ship needed urgent repairs. At night, the Dutch ships reached the Texel while we anchored nearby. We had destroyed many of their ships, losing only two frigates to fire-ships. With repairs needed and the Dutch unlikely to emerge soon, we returned to England. I received my discharge and reunited with Captain Dave later.

Cyril's sudden change in fortune left him feeling less excited than expected due to money concerns. As a Volunteer, he wouldn't be paid and had to keep up appearances with his noble companions.

Cyril's new path was unexpected but promising, with introductions promised after the war. His newfound opportunities came after a heroic act during a fire, altering his life's course.

At one o'clock, Lord Sandwich signaled the Blue Squadron to come together as they advanced against the enemy's line. His squadron broke into the Dutch line, engaging in fierce combat. Fire-ships were a significant threat, and the battle roared with the sound of cannons and shouts. Amidst the chaos, Cyril and Sydney rushed to the mizzen-mast, grabbing hatchets to defend their ship.

During the outbreak of the Plague, John and Cyril decided to stay together and assist those in need. They believed that fear was a significant factor in the spread of the disease and were willing to help others. Despite the widespread panic, some areas remained unaffected, and efforts were made to contain the outbreak. Many individuals, including women and clergy, worked tirelessly to care for the sick and prevent further spread of the Plague. The infected houses were closely monitored, and those inside were not allowed to leave. Despite the challenges and dangers, Cyril ventured into the affected districts to explore ways to provide assistance. The community faced immense hardships, with entire families succumbing to the disease due to the strict containment measures.

It was common to see people throwing themselves down in despair on the pavement, which horrified Cyril. He often ran errands for those trapped, receiving money in a dish lowered from above. Cyril would buy food or medicine and return with it in a basket. Although the watchmen usually ran these errands, they were unhelpful due to mistreatment. Many houses had secret exits, and even locked doors were not secure. Cyril sometimes entered open churches, where a preacher's inspiring words uplifted him. The preacher urged the congregation to fearlessly serve others during the plague, just as Christ would. Cyril was moved by the call to show courage and compassion in the face of danger, understanding that true service to others was service to a higher purpose.|"[""1.

She is not well, Cyril. The night in London has taken a toll on her, which is not surprising given her years of sorrow. The recent events have deeply affected her. She grieves like David over Absalom's death, mourning her son's wickedness. However, she supports the measures taken concerning him. At her request, provisions have been made to prevent his absolute want, ensuring he has no excuse to turn to crime due to poverty. Mr. Goldsworthy is yet to reach him, but once he does, he will inform him of monthly financial support. If he proves himself in America, he may receive an estate. Despite uncertainties, Cyril plans to travel after the war, avoiding the Court's distractions. He values Mr. Harvey's advice on foreign universities, aiming to continue his education and language skills.

Prince Rupert, a royal officer, suspected a trick by Louis to help the Dutch. Despite doubts, he readied the fleet to sail. He then restored Sir Cyril to command.

"""I'm really glad you came along, Sydney,"" Cyril expressed, settling beside his friend near the helmsman. ""I wish the Prince had appointed you as the commander.

After they rounded the Point, most of the sail was taken down from the _Fan Fan._ Even under the reduced canvas, she leaned over until her lee rail was nearly submerged when squalls hit from the cliffs. The rest of the squadron kept a distance, a magnificent sight as the ships leaned over, throwing spray high into the air and plunging into the waves.

Eventually, a shot hit a block, causing a sail to drop. The Dutch flagship retaliated, but the crew of the _Fan Fan_ cheered as they continued firing back. The ship sustained damage, prompting Cyril to act swiftly. He plugged a hole to stop water from flooding in. Despite their efforts, the _Fan Fan_ was taking on water as they rowed towards safety.

The Prince issued orders to an officer nearby. The officer called some sailors and instructed them to bring short lengths of hawser. Meanwhile, others were tasked with rigging tackle to the mainyard. Thirty-foot hawsers were dropped onto the deck of the _Fan Fan_, with the crew passing them under the ship and knotting them. Strong tackles were attached to the hawsers, and the crew boarded the ship. The tackles were manned, lifting the _Fan Fan_ gradually. The boatswain plugged the hole, allowing water to drain as the ship was raised. Once above water, the bow tackle was slackened, leaving the ship level. The crew pumped out the water, and repairs were made. The Fleet then sailed to Schonevelt, where the _Fan Fan_ was fully repaired. Later, the _Fan Fan_ played a crucial role in a successful attack on Dutch merchant ships and the island of Schonevelt, dealing a severe blow to the Dutch.|"['1.

Sir Cyril returned to London in August. Upon his arrival in the Medway, he stayed at Chatham before heading to the Savoy. There, he settled in and then delivered a letter to the Earl of Wisbech. Finding the Earl away, he went to the City and spent the evening at Captain Dave's. Suddenly, John Wilkes alerted him of a fire in Pudding Lane. Cyril and Captain Dave rushed out to find several houses ablaze. Despite efforts to douse the fire, it raged on due to dry weather.

Cyril cautiously approached the fiery scene, where chaos reigned. Houses blazed, people hurled belongings from windows without care, and the noise was deafening. Amidst the crackling flames, crashing roofs, and alarm bells, Cyril stood watching. The fire spread slowly due to the wooden houses. Balconies caught fire first, then flames crept under roofs.

Amid the boats floated various goods and debris, including charred timber from nearby buildings and warehouses. The wind shifts caused smoke and burning embers to scatter, creating chaos among the boats and risking fires on the goods. Following Frank Watson's suggestion, they disembarked at the Temple after navigating the river for about two hours. Fleet Street was bustling with carts loaded with valuable furniture and belongings heading westward. The pavements were crowded with people carrying their possessions, all moving towards the same direction. Despite efforts to demolish buildings to halt the fire, the lack of order hindered progress. After observing the situation, they returned to Fleet Street. Cyril's servant informed him of the fire's extent and the burnt house where they stayed. Cyril advised his servant to remain at the Savoy and prepare to evacuate if needed. They rowed back to the _Good Venture_ at London Bridge, witnessing the fire's advancement towards them. The night was restless as the flames neared, with crashing buildings and intense heat.

They rowed down the river to Upnor Castle, where preparations for defence were underway. More reinforcements were expected the next day. The Duke and Admiral strategized, deciding to position ships and set up a battery to counter the Dutch. Back at Chatham, they faced challenges as many workers had deserted due to delayed pay. Despite the setbacks, a small battery was set up at Upnor. Ships were sunk in the channel, and some were relocated for defense.

The Dutch fleet arrived at Sheerness from the 7th to the 12th, but due to the misconduct of the men, Chatham's defense was compromised. When the Dutch fleet was spotted on the 12th, the chances of a successful defense were slim. The battle began with a Dutch frigate, led by Captain Brakell, breaking through the chain barrier. The English frigates, undermanned, could not resist much. The Dutch fire-ships followed, setting several English ships ablaze. Despite the English resistance, the Dutch anchored in the river. The next day, six Dutch warships and fire-ships engaged with English ships, but the English managed to repel them. Eventually, the Dutch decided against further attacks on Chatham. The English suffered losses and the Dutch retreated after facing counterattacks.|"[""1.
