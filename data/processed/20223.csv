Doctor Greenwood had been the family physician of the Dudleys for many years. The heads of the families were college mates at Harvard, and continued their intimacy after the marriage of each, so that it was quite natural that their sons should become fond of each other. The fathers were sensible men, and so long as their boys' fondness for athletic sports did not interfere with their studies the gentlemen encouraged them, and, when possible, were present at the contests between the representatives of the schools. When Jack Dudley was presented with a shotgun and allowed to make an excursion down the Jersey coast Fred was his companion, and the two had rare sport in shooting duck and wild fowl. They became quite expert for boys, and before the hunting season set in did considerable fishing in the surrounding waters, and both learned to be skilful swimmers and boatmen. Mr. Dudley was wealthier than his professional friend, though the large practice of the physician placed him in comfortable circumstances. In one of his many business transactions Mr. Dudley found that he had to choose between losing a considerable sum of money and accepting a half-ownership in a ranch in the new State of Wyoming. There seemed little choice between the two horns of the dilemma, for he saw no prospect of ever getting any money out of the Western land, but he accepted the ownership, the other half of which was divided among three gentlemen, one of whom lived in Cheyenne, and the others in Chicago.

Upon receiving prior notice of their impending arrival, the young boys immediately scanned the area for the individuals responsible for guiding them to the ranch. A few figures were visible on the lengthy platform, some adorned in the attire of United States military personnel, while a pair of Native Americans, wrapped in disheveled blankets, eyed them with scowls. Since few passengers typically disembarked at this location, the idle onlookers displayed a natural curiosity. Although the station agent may have initially suspected them of being wayward youths enticed by tales of daring adventures, such assumptions likely dissipated upon observing their intelligent demeanor and well-equipped gear. The boys spotted the man approaching from the direction of the fort. Tall, bearded, and exuding strength, he sported cowboy attire and appeared eager to compensate for his tardiness. After efficiently securing their belongings to the saddles, Jack and Fred mounted their ponies, armed with Winchesters, and signified their readiness to embark on the extensive journey northward. The horses transitioned into a comfortable canter, leaving civilization behind as they ventured into the wilderness. Buoyant and invigorated by the crisp air, the boys marveled at the picturesque surroundings. The vast expanse to the north and east consisted of rolling plains, while to the west, the majestic Wind River range loomed, creating a breathtaking backdrop.

"Hazletine didn't plan to buy it, but circumstances led him to do so. Before selling it, he sent us to inspect it and verify its quality.

We're close to the mountains, and when you're ready, I'll accompany you, ensuring you'll have stories to share for a lifetime."" Hazletine lit his pipe despite the pony's pace, admiring the surroundings. Jack chuckled at the simplicity of the man, emphasizing that practical knowledge of nature surpasses book education.

The friends had a delightful meal in the open grassland. After removing the bits from their horses' mouths, they allowed the animals to graze while they enjoyed their food. Hazletine explained that they brought food in case they didn't find any game on the way home. Fred jokingly said he felt like chewing his saddle due to their hearty appetites. The boys ate until satisfied, leaving some for later. They rested for less than an hour before riding again. Hazletine led them towards the Wind River range, skipping a detour to Sweetwater settlement to save time. The boys trusted his decision. As they rode on, the beautiful weather persisted. They reached a grove for the night, where they set up camp, fed their horses, and enjoyed a warm fire.

The guide wrapped his blanket around him and lay in front of the fire, quickly falling asleep. Jack and Fred sat nearby, discussing the dangers of the wild country. Fred added more wood to the fire, causing the horses to stir. Jack decided to stay alert and moved away from the fire to hide in the grove.

One night, near midnight, Jack noticed movement in the grove where he stood. Hidden by a large oak tree from the campfire's glow, he saw a figure approaching. Despite the stealthy advance, a sudden flare of light revealed an Indian warrior mere feet away.

The young man was confident in his ability to handle the situation, but a hint of fear crept in when he suspected the Native American scout was part of a nearby group. The wise choice for the sentinel was to fire his gun, but as he pondered, he noticed the intruder silently advancing. The scout's stealthy approach made him seem like a statue among the trees. Despite being shrouded in shadow, the Indian was inching closer to the campfire. The youth kept his eyes fixed on the enemy, ready to act. When the buck was just six feet away, the young man stepped forward with his rifle aimed, causing the Native American to freeze in fear.

Far from the campfire's glow, two figures stood in the darkness. The Indian, forced out into the open, mounted his pony silently. The youth, Jack, watched in awe at the silent steps of the horse. The Indian's actions spoke louder than words, showing his skill and alertness. Jack, though inexperienced, showed mercy and honor by sparing the Indian's life. As the Indian rode off, Jack realized his mistake - leaving the camp unguarded. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows, approaching silently.

Before he could aim, the other hid behind a trunk. Jack waited, ready to shoot but hesitant until the truth was clear. Then, a faint whistle reached him, the signal of Fred Greenwood. Relieved, Jack shared his sentinel experience. Fred, surprised, praised Jack's caution. Fred then took over guard duty. Hank slept undisturbed as the night grew colder. Jack, nervous but reassured, joined Fred in sleep. Responsibility shifted to Fred, aware of the danger posed by the vengeful Indian.

Fred and his friend were camping in the woods, and Fred was vigilant. He circled the campfire to stay alert and hidden. Around 1 a.m., he sensed an intruder. It turned out to be a wolf attracted by the smell of their food. Fred readied his rifle and chased the wolf, shooting it dead. Despite the gunshot, their guide Hazletine slept on, trusting the boys to handle the situation. Hazletine's decision to let the boys face danger themselves was puzzling but perhaps meant to teach them to handle risky situations. The boys learned quickly and handled the wolf encounter well.|"['1.

During their first night in Wyoming, the young campers faced danger from an Indian and a lone wolf. Jack Dudley scared off the Indian, who did not return. The wolf also stayed away, typical of a cowardly lone wolf. In winter, wolves can be bolder due to hunger, but in autumn, they find food easily. The unusual part was that only one wolf approached, while they usually travel in packs. The wolf might have been a scout for others. Fred Greenwood, a skilled sentinel, kept watch, ensuring safety. The next morning, hunger struck the boys, with no food left in camp. Hank, an expert, cooked veal for breakfast, sprinkling it with pepper and salt. They ate heartily, grateful for the meal prepared by Hank.|"[""1.

The boys heeded the advice and gazed towards the Wind River Mountains. They marveled at the vast expanse of grazing cattle dotting the foothills and plains, a testament to the fertile Wyoming region. Armed with spy-glasses, they observed the distant cattle, resembling moving mounds of dirt.

Cattle theft poses a significant problem for ranch owners, with desperate individuals risking stealing cattle despite strict laws. The thieves face challenges in selling the stolen cattle due to brands being registered, making it harder for them to escape punishment. While most Native Americans on reservations are law-abiding, a few still engage in cattle theft due to resentment towards the changing times. The cowmen at Bowman's ranch must protect their cattle from both white and Native American thieves. The Indians sometimes engage in senseless killing of cattle out of animosity towards the white man. These incidents highlight the challenges faced by ranchers, including dangerous encounters with thieves.

Jack Dudley felt a touch of homesickness and loneliness as he gazed at the sky, wondering about his parents and their well-being. The fear of never seeing them again crossed his mind, bringing tears to his eyes. As he watched the moon rise over the majestic mountain, casting its silvery light over the landscape, Jack was filled with awe at the beauty and power of nature. The scene was so breathtaking that it made him feel closer to a higher power. Lost in the moment, Jack didn't realize how time passed until he was awakened by Fred's laughter. Both boys had slept through the night, safe and unharmed.

They washed their faces and hands in the cold stream nearby, combed their hair, and did some stretching exercises. Returning to the cave, they found live embers to cook the venison.

"Yesterday afternoon, when we peered into the deep canyon nearby, we called out to you down below, but maybe the rushing water drowned our voices. Anyway, you didn't acknowledge us."" Hank chuckled quietly, hinting at a secret mission below, typical of his mysterious nature. ""It's a long way down, but not far off, there's a gap where the banks are close to the stream.

The boys adjusted their glasses, trying to locate the second signal pointed out by their guide. The vapor was so fine that it amazed them how Hank had spotted it. The signals were at similar elevations, separated by two miles of rugged terrain. Hank warned them about the Indians signaling in secret and stressed the need for caution. He left to investigate further, advising them to stay close. Fred and Jack explored the canyon, following Hank's path. They found the canyon deepening, with a stream flowing swiftly below.

Fred and Jack were perched on a boulder when Jack suddenly pulled Fred back, causing a bit of a commotion. They cautiously peeked out and saw three painted and armed Indians emerge from the pines. Despite not recognizing them, the boys felt safe behind the rocks. The Indians seemed to be in a heated discussion, and one of them made a sudden move to go up the canyon but stopped midway. The other two Indians didn't seem surprised by his change of heart. Eventually, the trio left, disappearing into the pines. Unaware of the danger, the boys decided to continue their hunt, only to be startled by the sound of a rattlesnake.

"Feeling secure, they paused to observe the monstrous creature. They both agreed it was larger and darker than the others they had seen. Despite being on opposite sides of the canyon, they resembled potential mates. The head and tail were raised, with the tail vibrating rapidly, creating a hazy effect at the rattles' end. Jack quoted, ""The heel of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head,"" noting people's impulse to kill snakes. With a sharp crack, Jack's rifle shot decapitated the creature, causing its body to writhe before stilling. Fred praised Jack's accuracy, and they observed an animal on a rock nearby, but it swiftly disappeared. They settled to watch for game, with Jack pointing out a majestic eagle soaring above.

Jack and Fred had heard stories about grizzly bears but nothing prepared them for the monstrous beast charging at them. The grizzly was enormous, four times the size of any black bear they had seen. Its speed was surprising, its claws clattering on the rocks as it ran towards them. With a gaping mouth, red tongue, and glowing eyes, the bear exuded terror. Fred managed to shoot, enraging the bear even more. As they ran for their lives, Fred stumbled, but Jack turned back, firing twice and hitting the bear.

The boys found themselves in a dangerous situation as a bear chased them. Fred, realizing the imminent danger to Jack, turned and fired his Winchester at the bear. The bear, focused on Jack, continued its pursuit despite being hit multiple times by Fred's shots. Jack, desperate to escape, threw away his rifle and ran for his life, with Fred shouting and firing his gun in an attempt to distract the bear.

The incident unfolded when the grizzly bear, despite being struck by several bullets, attempted a daring leap across a canyon, pursuing the fugitive Jack Dudley. Fred Greenwood, in a desperate attempt to save his companion, took aim and fired the last cartridge in his rifle. The shot hit a vulnerable spot on the bear, causing a mortal wound that weakened the beast's attempt to make the leap.

Jack and Fred rushed to the edge and peered down. They witnessed a massive body tumbling into a deep chasm, maintaining a horizontal stance until hitting a point that sent it bouncing against the opposite side. The body then somersaulted like a log downhill. Despite the dark abyss, the sun shone brightly, allowing them to see everything clearly. They watched as the body hit the water, disappeared momentarily, then resurfaced and floated downstream. Observing it get stuck in the current, they felt awed and relieved. They cheered and expressed gratitude towards their deliverance. Afterward, they walked along the canyon until reaching a narrow point where Jack leaped across to join Fred. They then headed to retrieve the stolen Winchester. Fred suspected the Indians, and indeed, he found Motoza, who refused to return the rifle.

The view of the valley delighted both young men. It was a lush expanse of green grass, perfect for grazing thousands of cattle. The valley was uniform in shape, gently sloping on each side with no abrupt changes. The only trees were clustered near a spring, hidden from view. The young hunters were captivated by the picturesque landscape. However, their attention was drawn to a group of antelope grazing nearby. One of the young men devised a plan to approach the antelope for a shot. While one hunter stayed put with his rifle ready, the other sneaked around to get closer to the herd. The plan was to ensure that one of them would have a clear shot at the antelope. As they executed their strategy, the leader of the antelope herd seemed wary but not alarmed. The young men carefully timed their movements, hoping for a successful hunt.|"['1.

Jack was constantly afraid that Fred might accidentally reveal their presence. As time passed without any mishaps, Jack's hope grew. He worried that if the antelope changed direction and headed into the mountains, they would starve. Using his binoculars, Jack tried to track Fred's movements. The antelope were slowly moving closer to Jack's position. Suddenly, the animals spooked and ran. Jack took a shot, hitting one of the antelope. He quickly prepared the meat. Concerned about Fred's absence, Jack searched for him but found no sign. Worried, Jack decided to follow Fred's possible path, calling out and firing his rifle, but Fred did not respond.

Jack was puzzled by Hank Hazletine's behavior. The guide had left him and Fred alone during a hunt in unfamiliar mountainous terrain, which led to Fred's disappearance. Jack worried about the mishaps that might have befallen his friend. Despite Fred's gunshot signaling a successful hunt, he never returned. Jack tried to follow Fred's path but soon realized it was futile. He called out, fired shots, but got no response. Jack felt helpless, unable to find Fred. He lacked the woodcraft skills needed to track his friend. Memories of a tense encounter with a Sioux man haunted Jack, hinting at a grim fate for Fred.

Jack Dudley, a person visibly troubled, struggled to hide his emotions. The hunter, observing Jack's distress, sensed that something was amiss. Hank, true to his word, had not brought back any food to camp, leaving Jack and his friends to fend for themselves. Overwhelmed by grief, Jack broke down in tears. The seasoned hunter, surprisingly delicate, allowed Jack to release his emotions before offering comfort. Jack, determined to be strong, shared the story of Fred's mysterious disappearance.

Jack, a youth filled with despair and dread, lay wide awake in a gloomy cavern. His friend, Hank, stood by the fire, casting shadows. Jack pretended sleep, watching Hank's every move. Hank, after calling Jack's name, assumed the boy was asleep. As Hank left to investigate, Jack followed suit, stepping out into the starlit night. The guide's departure broke their usual rule of keeping watch. Jack hoped Hank would uncover valuable information. The night was long and torturous, Jack's mind alert with worry. The silence of the cavern was broken only by the crackling fire. The mystery of Motoza and the impending danger weighed heavily on Jack's heart.|"['1.

Jack quickly made himself comfortable by folding his blanket and sitting against the rock where he had slept the night before. He threw wood on the fire to ward off wild animals, though there was little to fear. Despite hearing noises and seeing shadows, he eventually fell asleep. Meanwhile, Hank Hazletine, fond of Jack, formed theories about his disappearance but needed more information. Seeing a fire in the distance, he realized it was from an Indian camp and decided to investigate for clues about Jack. Hank left Jack alone, confident in his safety, and approached the camp of three men, not finding the person he was looking for. He observed the men smoking and talking lazily, noting Motoza was not among them.|"['1.

Hazletine believed that the Sioux was involved in Fred Greenwood's disappearance. The absence of the Sioux from camp confirmed this belief. The three remaining individuals seemed unaware of the situation. Hazletine decided to confront Motoza if he had seen him. He walked into the Indian camp and warned them about Motoza's actions. He communicated that a white youth had gone missing and that Motoza was responsible. Hazletine threatened to take matters into his own hands if the missing boy was not returned unharmed. If Motoza returned the boy within 24 hours unharmed, no punishment would be given. Hazletine left the camp feeling contempt towards the individuals. He hoped his message would reach the right person.

Hank thought deeply about the situation and decided to track down Motoza, even though it might be challenging. He was determined to find the truth. Hank made sure the young man was comfortable before resting in the cave. Suddenly, a cowboy with a rifle approached them. Jack was puzzled by the cowboy's presence but remained silent. The cowboy mentioned knowing about the missing boy, leaving Jack intrigued. Hank and the cowboy spoke privately, raising suspicions. Hank was skeptical of the cowboy's knowledge and intentions. Despite the cowboy's claims, Hank doubted his credibility. He suspected Motoza was lying about the missing boy.

During the interview, the visitor believed he had tricked the guide, but it was the guide who outsmarted him. The guide, Hank Hazletine, pretended to be foolish to reveal the truth. It was discovered that Fred Greenwood was kidnapped by both Motoza and Bill Tozer. Tozer had planned the abduction, mistaking Fred's father as a rich ranch owner. Hazletine recalled the conversation with Tozer and shared it with Jack, surprising him. Tozer was a cunning criminal involved in various crimes, always looking for ways to make money. Despite Tozer's mistake in identifying the ranch owner, the information revealed that Fred was alive, giving hope for his rescue. Hazletine warned Jack about Tozer's dangerous nature, emphasizing the need for caution in dealing with him.|"[""1.

You may have heard the saying that evil looks after its own; Bill and Motoza are long-time pals who have been involved in some shady dealings. It seems that Bill may have suspected that the Sioux were nearby and went out to find him. They managed to meet up, and they arranged a plan between them. The guide emphasized the importance of focusing on the present rather than dwelling on the past. If Doctor Greenwood receives a telegraph demanding five thousand dollars to get his child back, he will be shocked and confused. He would likely come to the location with detectives. The cowman warned Jack about the dangerous situation involving Tozer and Motoza. It was clear that the cowman was determined to thwart the evil plans of the criminals.|"[""1.

The cowman left abruptly to pursue his mission but soon returned to Jack Dudley. Hazletine's goal was to locate Motoza and Tozer, especially Motoza. He believed shadowing the Sioux could provide crucial information. Hazletine had to be discreet as Motoza would be vigilant against surveillance. While leaving Jack, Hazletine noticed a flicker among the rocks, indicating he was being watched. To deceive the watcher, he pretended to search for a lost item, hinting at his discovery. Hazletine shared his findings with Jack, who also planned to investigate further. Despite the risks, Jack felt confident he could search without drawing suspicion.

Hazletine and Jack spent hours in the camp, discussing their important business. The guide, trained in patience, struggled to contain his eagerness as the sun set. Jack, keeping an eye on his friend, saw him scanning the landscape. Hazletine, after discovering something, left in a deceptive direction. Jack, realizing the ruse, followed his friend's true path. Using a glass, Jack observed the plateau, the pony, and the surrounding land, noting a distant campfire.

The Sioux's cautious movements as he emerged from the canyon were observed keenly by Jack, who was hiding nearby. Jack noted the Sioux's rugged appearance, painted face, and intense eyes. Jack feared being discovered, yet he contemplated confronting the Sioux to protect his friend Fred. As the Sioux approached Jack's hiding spot, Jack readied his revolver but reconsidered the confrontation's potential harm. Jack pondered the possibility of Fred being held captive within the canyon, contemplating a risky rescue mission.

It's amazing how we can sometimes believe what we want to be true. Jack Dudley thought he saw a rock to jump to, but it wasn't there. He landed in the water and got swept away. Jack stayed calm and avoided hitting rocks. He managed to grab onto one and pull himself out. He lost his gun but was relieved to find his revolver. Jack realized his expedition had failed and decided to leave the canyon. As he tried to climb, something flew past him. It was someone leaping from rock to rock.

Jack found himself in a new location near the canyon's mouth, making swimming easier in the calm pool. Despite losing his smaller weapon, he kept his good spirits. Climbing the bank, he pondered returning to the cavern for warmth. On his way back, he noticed a large wolf following him, causing him concern. Jack hurried to the plateau where his pony, Dick, awaited. The wolf, losing interest, disappeared. Meanwhile, the veteran aimed to locate Motoza, a Sioux, to find Fred Greenwood. This proved challenging as Motoza was wary. Hank stayed cautious, aware of potential threats from Motoza or his ally, Bill Tozer. He planned to continue hunting with Jack, maintaining an innocent appearance if they were to cross paths.|"[""1.

Hazletine, a skilled scout, cautiously advanced near a canyon break to uncover a plot. He climbed, leaped across the canyon, and concealed himself to eavesdrop on Tozer and Motoza.

The words and actions of Motoza left no doubt about the abduction of Fred Greenwood. Motoza seemed to be the main culprit, with Tozer's involvement still uncertain. Motoza concealed a firearm that belonged to the kidnapped boy, planning to use it as proof to show Hank. The eavesdropper, enraged and eager to rescue the prisoner, couldn't hear their full conversation. Motoza and Tozer walked away, making it challenging for the eavesdropper to follow. The hunter, realizing the importance of not losing sight of them, searched in vain as darkness fell. He then decided to explore the canyon, suspecting it might hold the key to the youth's location.

The experienced cowman, Hank, avoided a dangerous misstep in the canyon thanks to his knowledge of the area. Despite the darkness, he navigated carefully. As he reached the spot where his friend, Jack, had encountered trouble, Hank paused to survey the surroundings. By studying the crags above him against the starlit sky, he confirmed his location. Hank's keen eye led him to the next rock he needed to leap to, a move that Jack would have known if he had been there. Hank's search for a rumored gold-studded cavern in the canyon ended in disappointment. Though he found a picturesque spot, there was no gold to be seen. Determined to rescue his friend, Fred, Hank ventured back to the cavern, hoping to find him there.

Tossing the used match into the water, he easily pulled himself onto the ledge. Standing in front of the familiar cave, he called out for the missing boy. The roaring water drowned his voice, but he persisted, lighting matches to search the dark cavern. As he explored, he found a piece of paper matching Fred's stationery. Bewildered by the discovery, he considered the possibility that Motoza, driven by hatred, had harmed the boy. The cowman's mind raced with theories, wondering where Fred could be.

The cowman finished his work and carefully descended to the rock below before making his way through the canyon towards the opening. He sat down to think on the higher ground, realizing it was too late to do more. Determined not to be outsmarted by the ruffians, he refused to pay a ransom until they fulfilled their part. He was surprised to learn that both he and Jack Dudley had taken the same route without knowing.

The young man pondered deeply. The sudden realization of imminent danger was somewhat softened by the fact that the crisis was postponed, though it was uncertain for how long.
