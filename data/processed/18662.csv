Farmer Green had no trouble waking up early with Rusty Wren singing beneath his window. But the Bumblebee family, living underground in Mrs. Field Mouse's old house, struggled to hear the bird's morning song. Lacking an alarm clock, they needed a new way to wake up. While the workers welcomed the trumpeter's loud wake-up calls, Buster Bumblebee, who preferred sleep, found it bothersome. He discussed stopping the noise with friends but felt nervous about it. The trumpeter, always in a bad mood, became the target of Buster's plan. Despite Chirpy Cricket's jokes, Buster worried about the outcome. The trumpeter's grumpy attitude and lack of a hat added to Buster's anxiety.|"[""1.

Buster Bumblebee sat on a sprig of wild honeysuckle, pondering how to block out the early morning noise. Jasper Jay landed nearby, willing to help. Buster shared his idea of using cotton to muffle the sounds. Mr. Crow, overhearing, suggested adjusting the family clock instead. Buster was grateful for the advice. Later, he found a quiet spot and rested, undisturbed by the morning trumpet. Meanwhile, Johnnie Green, tired of hay work, devised a mischievous plan involving the Bumblebee family. He carried a jug of water, listening to the water's roar near their home. Johnnie's scheme brought a mischievous smile to his face.|"['1.

Buster Bumblebee was in a rush to get home and rest, still following Mr. Crow's advice. Along the way, he saw Johnnie and wondered what he was up to. However, once inside, he forgot about Johnnie. Suddenly, there was a loud scraping noise in the hall, but Buster didn't mention seeing Johnnie outside. The workers, including Buster, panicked and thought an enemy was approaching, so they all ran outside. There, near the door, was the strange object Buster had seen with Johnnie. They all buzzed around it, not realizing it was a jug. Johnnie had left it uncorked, and the workers, including Buster, flew inside. Johnnie then corked the jug, trapping them briefly. After some time, they dried off in the sun and returned to their house. The workers were not happy with Buster, thinking him lazy and foolish. They feared the Robber Fly, a fierce enemy of their kind.|"['1. What did Buster Bumblebee see with Johnnie near the door?\nA) A jug\nB) A flower\nC) A book\nD) A rock\nE) A hat', '2.

When Buster ventured outside to explore the flower garden and clover field, he was anxious about encountering the notorious Robber Fly. This villainous insect was known for capturing its victims with sharp feet and a menacing beak. Despite his fears, Buster gradually grew bolder as time passed without any sightings of the Robber Fly. Rumors circulated that the Robber Fly had either met with an accident or moved away. Some even doubted if he would return. Buster, once apprehensive, began to boast that he was unafraid of the Robber Fly, much to the dismay of worker bees who disapproved of his laziness. They plotted to give Buster a scare to teach him a lesson in respecting his mother, the Queen bee.|"['1.

Buster, the Bumblebee, remained oblivious to the danger lurking around him. Despite boasting about his bravery to those unfamiliar with him, the workers in his household saw through his facade, knowing him as a coward. Warned about the Robber Fly's presence in the clover patch, Buster was advised to avoid it and feast on safer hollyhocks instead. As Buster chuckled to himself, he was suddenly seized by a strong grip, believing it to be the Robber Fly. Terrified, he cried out for help, expecting Peevish Peggy to rescue him. However, Peggy too seemed frightened, and Buster remained hidden among the clover leaves. The commotion continued, with the Robber Fly causing panic until several workers intervened, saving Peggy from a close call.|"[""1.

Buster Bumblebee was a carefree drone who lived a life of ease and pleasure. He never gathered nectar or helped make honey like the worker bees. Despite being called lazy and not too bright by others, Buster didn't let their words bother him. One day, after a prank by Peevish Peggy, Buster decided to leave his crowded family home to find a quieter place. He wandered around, humming to himself as he sipped nectar from flowers. Buster didn't have a real home after leaving, but he found comfort in listening to music and the sound of dancing from afar. He would settle in various places for the night, not minding as long as he was close to the flowers he loved.|"['1.

Buster Bumblebee was quite content with his life until Mrs. Ladybug mentioned the skilled Carpenter Bee named Whiteface living by the brook. Intrigued, Buster flew to the big poplar tree where the Carpenter lived. Upon meeting, the Carpenter and Buster clashed immediately, with the Carpenter claiming to be the most peaceful in the neighborhood. Despite their differences, news spread that the Carpenter would build Buster a new house. Excited, Buster's friends asked when the construction would start, but Buster could only say after the Carpenter finished his own house.

Buster Bumblebee hoped the Carpenter would follow his advice. As he wandered away from the Carpenter's tree, he worried about not having a house-warming party for his friends if he didn't get his new house soon. Approaching the Carpenter's house, Buster saw a somber crowd and learned the Carpenter was in trouble. Feeling sorry for his friend, Buster flew to Farmer Green's house where the Carpenter was held captive. Buster found the Carpenter trapped in a glass box looking sad. Buster urged the Carpenter to use his woodworking skills to escape. Meanwhile, two city boys watched Johnnie Green, waiting for him to be stung.|"[""1.

The twins and Johnnie Green were thrilled about Buster, mistaking him for a bumblebee. Unaware that Buster was a harmless carpenter bee, Johnnie watched as the twins caught and imprisoned him.

Farmer Green's guests, mainly men, gathered around timbers on the ground, shouting and talking excitedly. Small boys played around, causing chaos. After a brief silence, Farmer Green directed the men to lift a wooden framework. Some pounded the base with hammers. Buster Bumblebee, confused by the activity, focused on the barn construction, dismissing the idea of a bee-raising event. Despite missing the raising bee, Buster stayed to watch. As the men completed the barn frame, they returned to the farmhouse for a feast. Buster found solace in a sugar-bowl treat.

Buster Bumblebee watched as a boy named Bill overindulged at the feast, causing concern among the guests. Despite warnings from Buster about the consequences of eating too much, Bill ended up with a stomachache, leading to a commotion at Farmer Green's party.

Buster Bumblebee happily joined the lively party at Farmer Green's farmyard, enjoying the wonderful music played by the three fiddlers. As the dancers twirled and the fiddlers played, Buster was captivated by the merry tunes. One fiddler, in particular, stood out to Buster with his infectious love for music. This fiddler's lively tunes kept everyone's spirits high, even when the others needed breaks. Amidst the joyous atmosphere, Buster was surprised to hear a buzzing sound that seemed to come from the fiddle itself. Curious, he perched on a beam above the fiddler, trying to pinpoint the source of the mysterious buzz. Despite investigating a nearby pumpkin, Buster couldn't find the origin of the sound, leaving him puzzled yet intrigued by the musical mystery.|"[""1.

"Buster Bumblebee had no clever reply at that moment. The strange buzzing had ceased, the fiddlers were preparing for more music, and Buster's dispute with old dog Spot slipped his mind. The dance continued until late afternoon when the people remembered their cows and the musicians put away their instruments. Buster regretted the end of the dance. He had planned to meet Jimmy Rabbit the next morning at the hollyhock hedge, but Buster was unsure if Jimmy would show up. Despite wanting to correct Jimmy about the raising bee, Buster enjoyed his breakfast among the flowers. One day, Buster and Jimmy coincidentally met in the garden. Buster excitedly explained that there was no raising bee; instead, Farmer Green's friends had helped build the barn frame. Jimmy corrected Buster, explaining the term ""raising bee."""|"[""1.
