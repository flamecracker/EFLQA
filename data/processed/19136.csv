It was a warm spring day in the village of Hayslope, set in the midst of lush meadows and promising fields. Yet, a sense of gloom hung over the farm-labourers and women-folk due to the ongoing civil war in England in 1644. Two rival Parliaments were in session, one supporting the King in Oxford and the other in London, leading to a somber atmosphere. A young man named Harry returned home to Hayslope Grange, a charming estate with a moat and old-fashioned garden. Despite a warm welcome from his family, Harry seemed preoccupied and reserved, especially during prayers where his father passionately prayed for the King. Harry's silence during the prayer caught the attention of those present, leaving his family puzzled. Maud, his sister, noticed Harry's distant behavior and approached him the next day, suspecting his desire to join the war effort for the King.|"['1.

Maud was deep in thought about Harry and his reluctance to discuss his desire to become a soldier with his father. Bessie interrupted her with news of a visitor from London who wanted to see Harry.

"""We barely escaped danger, Harry. We must leave London quickly,"" said Gilbert as they departed the village, watching soldiers head towards Essex. He shared his past connection with Captain Stanhope. Despite his sadness, Harry chuckled and agreed on a brief London stay. They rested, refilled their purses, and sought Lieutenant Cromwell's army location before rushing to join him. The journey from Essex to London tired Harry, unaccustomed to such exertion. Upon hearing of horses, he eagerly resumed the trip towards Yorkshire where Lord Kimbolton and Lieutenant Cromwell assembled forces. Passing uncultivated fields, they lamented the impact of war on farmers. Gilbert hastened to reach Cromwell, making inquiries at villages and from passersby about the armies' whereabouts.
