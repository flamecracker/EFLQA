Grandfather recounted the tale of a wealthy gentleman who shared the Puritans' beliefs and journeyed with Lady Arbella aboard the ship Arbella to America in April 1630. Alongside them were notable figures like John Winthrop, the first Governor of Massachusetts, and a minister forbidden to preach in England. The vessel was part of a fleet carrying discontented individuals seeking refuge from the king's government. Upon arrival in Salem, the settlers found only a few humble shelters. Lady Arbella temporarily stayed with John Endicott, the leading figure in the settlement. The passengers, including ministers, scholars, and nobles, faced the uncertainties of the sea and the daunting wilderness of the new world. Their voyage was filled with prayers, hymns, and pious discussions as they sailed towards a new life in America.|"[""1.

On a scorching summer day, Lady Arbella, looking weary, gazes out of her window in Mr. Endicott's house, reminiscing about distant England. She observes the settlers toiling in the fields and forests, while indigenous people clad in fur and bone adornments watch. The villagers are busy establishing their homesteads, hunting, fishing, and defending against wolves. Lady Arbella, feeling out of place in this harsh and rugged environment, wonders if she belongs in this untamed land. Meanwhile, Mr. Endicott, a resolute man, tends to various tasks in the settlement, from farming to overseeing construction and administering justice.

In the past, a brave man contrasted with the delicate Lady Arbella, who weakened like a fading English flower in the forest's shadow. The grand chair often sat empty as Lady Arbella grew too frail to leave her bed. Her husband selected a spot for their new home, returning to Salem from Boston on foot through the woods. His heart ached to share the news with his wife, but seeing her weakened state, he knew her true home awaited in heaven. Within a month of her arrival, Lady Arbella passed away. Her grave was dug amidst the pine tree roots, with a church later built on the site. While Charley rode off on Grandfather's stick, Laurence and Clara were moved by the lady's story. Alice, seemingly asleep, listened intently, her eyes filled with tears and then a bright smile when the tale ended.|"[""1.

Grandfather sat with the children gathered around him, eager to hear more about the history of the chair. He spoke of Roger Williams, a clergyman who settled in Salem in 1631 and spent many hours in the chair penning sermons or reading theology by the light of pitchpine torches. Grandfather mentioned an incident involving Williams and John Endicott, where they discussed the Red Cross on the English banner, which the Puritans abhorred as a relic of idolatry. Endicott was troubled by the banner's presence in Salem and Boston, considering it a symbol of subjection to the Pope. Williams agreed, stating he couldn't fight or bless under such a banner. Endicott resolved to rid Massachusetts of the papal banner, showing the strong beliefs and actions of the early settlers.|"['1.

Not long after, a military muster was held in Salem. Every able man in town and nearby areas attended. They were all well-armed with steel caps, iron plates on their chests and backs, and steel gorgets around their necks. When the sun shone on these iron-clad men, they gleamed, dazzling the wild Indians who came out of the woods to watch. The soldiers carried long pikes, swords, and muskets that were almost as heavy as small cannons. These men looked stern and rigid, with hearts seemingly as ironclad as their armor. They were devoted Puritans, much like those who supported Oliver Cromwell. Despite hating Popish superstitions, the banner of the Red Cross flew over them. Endicott, their captain, took the banner and cut out the Papal Cross, showing their allegiance to God over the Pope. This act caused concern among the leaders of Massachusetts, fearing repercussions. The story of Endicott's bold move, though risky, showed his strong Puritan beliefs and desire for religious freedom.|"['1.

"""Yes, Charley,"" Grandfather responded. ""When Roger Williams journeyed through hills, valleys, woods, swamps, and streams to establish his plantation, it took him several days. Now, that little plantation has become a bustling city, and the residents greatly respect Roger Williams. His name is widely known because it appears on their banknotes. It would have surprised him to know that a bank would one day bear his name.""

Laurence chimed in, ""When Williams was banished from Massachusetts and ventured into the wilderness, he likely felt isolated. But now, his legacy is remembered across the country.""

Grandfather added, ""Often, those rejected in one era are revered in the next. Mrs. Anne Hutchinson, a wise and confident woman, faced opposition for her public lectures on religious matters. Her teachings caused a stir, leading to her banishment like Roger Williams."""|"['1.

Once upon a time, Grandfather shared the fascinating history of a chair with the children. He spoke of the early settlements in New England, like Plymouth in 1620 and Hartford in 1635, founded by ministers Hooker and Stone, who trekked through the woods with their congregation. In 1638, Mr. Davenport established New Haven, while others sought refuge in Rhode Island. Communities sprouted along the coast, linked by their English roots. French colonies occupied Canada, Dutch settled in New Netherlands along the Hudson River, and English made homes in Maine and New Hampshire. Grandfather paused his tales as Charley grew restless. The children cherished the chair, imagining the historical figures it cradled. With pride, Grandfather recounted the chair's rich past, connecting it to Harvard College's early days, a beacon of education for future generations.|"['1.

Long ago, Grandfather shared tales of the prestigious chair that witnessed historic events in Massachusetts. President Dunster, in 1642, bestowed degrees on nine young men, marking the first bachelor of arts recipients in America. Grandfather revealed uncertainties about the chair's adventures, hinting at its use by notable figures like William Hawthorne and governors like Winthrop and Bellingham. The chair symbolized authority during council meetings and when receiving important messages. Grandfather delved into the democratic roots of New England, contrasting the settlers' freedoms with those in old England. The chair's era saw a stable period with town incorporations and land deals with Native Americans. Notably, in 1643, a union formed among Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut, and New Haven for mutual defense. The chair also witnessed Governor Endicott's peace treaty with Acadie in 1644.|['1.

During the 17th century, Massachusetts and the rest of New England were fairly self-sufficient, as England was embroiled in a civil war. With King Charles beheaded in 1649, Oliver Cromwell took charge. Being a Puritan, Cromwell supported the Puritan colonies in America. The historical chair from that era, once used by governors, broke its leg and was sold to Captain John Hull, the mint-master of Massachusetts. At that time, money was scarce in the colonies, and people resorted to bartering goods like bear skins, molasses, and musket bullets. To address the need for currency, a coinage of shillings, sixpences, and threepences was established, with Captain John Hull overseeing the minting process. The resulting coins, known as pine-tree shillings, featured a pine tree on one side and the year 1652 on the other. Captain Hull earned a shilling for every twenty coins minted.|['1.

The judges grew suspicious that the mint-master was benefiting more from the deal. They offered him a large sum to stop pocketing a portion of the shillings. However, Captain Hull was content with his share. His hard work paid off as his pockets, bags, and box overflowed with pine-tree shillings. When his daughter, Betsey, was courted by Samuel Sewell, the mint-master readily agreed due to Samuel's good character. On the wedding day, Captain Hull, in a plum-colored coat adorned with pine-tree shilling buttons, sat in Grandfather's chair. Betsey, a hearty maiden, was round and plump from Puritan delicacies. The groom, Samuel Sewell, was attired in fine attire within Puritan customs. At the wedding, Captain Hull weighed Betsey against shillings, revealing his honest share of the coinage.|"['1.

In the past, a mint-master named Samuel Sewell shared a tale with his children. He spoke of the Quakers, who faced harsh treatment in the Massachusetts colony due to their beliefs. The Quakers, including William Robinson and Marmaduke Stephenson, were executed, and Mary Dyer, another Quaker, was also sentenced to death but reprieved. She returned to Boston in 1660, delivering a message from Heaven before being imprisoned. The children were fascinated to learn that Mary Dyer had briefly sat in Grandfather's chair. The story ended with King Charles II stopping the persecution of Quakers in Massachusetts after hearing of their plight from English Quakers. Grandfather then mentioned how the chair was later passed on to Reverend John Eliot, known as the apostle to the Indians for his efforts to convert Native Americans to Christianity.|"[""1.

Grandfather recounted a tale of the Apostle Eliot, who translated the Bible into the Indian language. Eliot believed the Native Americans were descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. He worked tirelessly, hoping to enlighten the indigenous people. Eliot's toil was immense, learning a new language and translating the Bible meticulously. Despite no earthly rewards, he persevered, driven by faith and the promise of spiritual blessings in the afterlife. Eliot's dedication impressed even erudite scholars who struggled with the unfamiliar language. In contrast, young Indian students effortlessly read Eliot's translations, their voices akin to nature's harmonious melodies. The Indian language resonated with echoes of the forest and distant streams, embodying a unique and profound connection to the land.|"[""1.

After teaching, Mr. Eliot would reward the Indian boy with a treat and encourage him to go outside, where he felt most alive. He was kind to children and even joined in their games. His understanding of the Indian ways and influence over the New England tribes were unmatched. His guidance must have been invaluable in dealings with the Indians. Sometimes, the governor and council sought his advice, perhaps to gain control of Indian lands or discuss making them servants. Mr. Eliot believed in treating the Indians as equals and converting them to Christianity. He tirelessly translated the Bible to enlighten and civilize the tribes. His dedication led to the completion of the Bible for the Indians, offering them a chance to reconnect with their heritage.|"['1.

There is no impiety in believing that when Eliot's long life ended, he was welcomed to the celestial abodes by ancient prophets and early apostles. They all preached truth and salvation to the world. Eliot, full of the same spirit, bore a similar message to the new world. Laurence expressed concern that Eliot's efforts seemed lost as the language and people were gone, leaving only the Indian Bible. Grandfather reminded Laurence of Eliot's selfless dedication, urging him to read Dr. Francis's biography of Eliot. Despite the challenges during King Philip's war, Eliot's zeal for the Indians never wavered, evident in his work on a new edition of the Indian Bible. Grandfather emphasized that Eliot's translation work was more glorious than any battle fought. The children gathered around Grandfather, symbolizing the past connecting with the future. Grandfather cherished their innocence, wishing they could remain sheltered from the harsh realities of the world.|"[""1.

But these complaints were just passing shadows in the old man's heart. He had enough faith to believe that the flower's bloom would be even more sacred and joyful than its bud. Despite being at an age when thoughts of mortality often weigh heavily, he felt a bliss within himself that he wouldn't trade for childhood happiness. Grandfather continued the chair's history with optimism, trusting that a deeper wisdom would extract timeless fragrance from life's experiences. Looking back to 1660, he spoke of the Puritans' reluctance to acknowledge Charles II's rule in America. During Charles II's reign, the colonies faced little tyranny. However, James's ascension in 1685 brought fear to New England as he was a Catholic with despotic tendencies. The colonies lost their charters, and Sir Edmund Andros's rule brought absolute power, causing suffering and fear among the people.|"[""1.

Grandfather shared a story about Governor Bradstreet, the last of the Puritans, who governed Massachusetts after the people overthrew Sir Edmund Andros' government. Bradstreet, nearly ninety years old, symbolized the end of an era as he sat in a chair that now belonged to Grandfather. The chair had a rich history, witnessing the transformation of Massachusetts from a wilderness to a thriving province. Bradstreet's generation had laid the foundation of the country, and he was the last remaining link to that time. Despite his age, he saw new faces and realized it was time to pass the torch.

Captain Phips and his crew found a Spanish wreck filled with treasures at the bottom of the sea. They were amazed by the abundance of silver, gold, and precious items they retrieved. Among the loot were silver tables, a golden cup fit for a king, and even valuable gemstones. The crew worked tirelessly using rakes and hooks to bring up the riches. The recovered treasure was estimated to be worth over two million dollars. Despite the immense wealth, one sea captain lost his mind and died raving about the treasures. Eventually, Captain Phips and his crew had to return to England due to dwindling provisions. The Duke of Albemarle and other English lords claimed a large portion of the treasure, but Captain Phips still received a substantial share, allowing him to live comfortably and fulfill his promise to his wife by building a grand house in Boston.|['1.

Sir William Phips, an adventurous man, couldn't sit still after his successful conquest. In 1690, he led a military expedition against French colonies in Acadie, returning with much plunder. He later commanded an unsuccessful attack on Quebec. By 1692, he became the governor of Massachusetts. His story intertwines with the history of the province. Grandfather hints at more tales involving the chair's history. The chair symbolizes the vicissitudes of life, embodying joy and grief.

Grandfather explained that under the first charter, the people held all power, choosing their governors like Winthrop and Endicott. However, the new charter gave the king the sole authority to appoint the governor and other high officials. Despite this, the people could still elect representatives. Sir William Phips, a former ship-carpenter, became governor and hosted ship-carpenters in a grand festival. Grandfather recounted how Phips, though popular, faced criticism as governor, especially during the witchcraft delusion. Children accused innocent people of witchcraft, leading to hysteria. Even prominent figures like ministers were suspected. Innocent individuals, including George Burroughs, were executed. The situation worsened, with more false accusations and even wealthy individuals fleeing or facing imprisonment.|"['1.

Grandfather shared a tale with the children about the Salem Witch Trials. Accusers accused the governor's wife of witchcraft, claiming she flew to witch meetings. The governor, Sir William Phips, was distressed by these accusations. However, Grandfather reassured the children that witches would flee from innocent hearts like theirs. Eventually, the accused were freed, but the innocent lives lost could not be restored. Grandfather then recounted another event during Sir William Phips's time as governor when an English fleet arrived in Boston in 1693. The fleet intended to conquer Canada but was struck by a deadly disease, halting their plans. Sir William Phips later got into altercations and was summoned to England, where he passed away in 1695.

Long ago, in a school over a hundred years past, Grandfather shared tales of how things were run. Imagine being in Master Ezekiel Cheever‚Äôs schoolroom. It's a big, dim room with a sanded floor and windows that open outwards, with small diamond-shaped glass panes. Scholars sit on long benches with desks in front of them. At one end, a large fireplace warms the room, with space for boys in each corner. Logs burn brightly, filling the room with smoke that darkens the walls. The schoolmaster, stern and Puritan-like, sits in a historic chair. He watches over the students, ready to use a birch rod or ferule for any mischief. The scholars study Latin, dressed like little grandfathers, aiming for professions through education at Cambridge.

In the next class, the students learn Arithmetic. These young boys are being prepared for future roles as merchants, shopkeepers, and mechanics. They have traded in marbles and apples, but soon they will trade in broadcloths from England, sugar from the West Indies, and more. Some will work behind counters measuring tape and ribbon, while others will become blacksmiths, carpenters, or shoemakers. Many will even become sea captains.

"""Boys, enjoy your playtime today, for tomorrow is a school day with lessons and discipline. In the early days of Massachusetts, Thursdays were lecture days, and school was out in the afternoons. The schoolmaster, Master Ezekiel Cheever, was a strict but caring teacher who dedicated his life to educating young minds. He passed away in 1707 after teaching for about seventy years. Many great men of that time were molded by his teachings. The school's chair was passed down to the most learned man from his school, Cotton Mather, a renowned minister and author.

Grandfather shared the story of Cotton Mather, a man who believed in evil spirits lurking everywhere. He thought they hid in books and men's hearts. Little Alice, feeling scared, asked Grandfather to stop. He comforted her, saying angels were the only spirits she should think about. Grandfather then talked about the ongoing war between France and England in 1702, causing harm to New England. The New Englanders despised the French for inciting Indian attacks. They aimed to conquer Quebec to secure Canada. Despite past failed attempts, they continued military expeditions. In 1710, Port Royal fell to the English. In 1711, Admiral Sir Hovenden Walker arrived in Boston to prepare for a campaign against Canada. However, disaster struck when ships wrecked, and soldiers drowned. The war ended in 1713, giving New England a much-needed break from the constant military activities that drained resources and manpower.|['1.

The next significant event that Grandfather mentioned was the accession of the Elector of Hanover to the English throne in 1714, upon Queen Anne's death. This event brought relief to the New England inhabitants, including Cotton Mather, as it ensured Protestant rule instead of the feared return of the Catholic Stuart family. Grandfather emphasized the immense importance of this event, comparing it to a Presidential Election but highlighting the long-lasting impact of a dynasty. The proclamation of George the First as king in Boston marked a time of jubilation, with illuminations and celebrations. Grandfather also recounted the appointment of Colonel Shute as governor in 1716, who faced challenges governing the province due to disagreements with the legislature over his salary. Despite his struggles, Colonel Shute managed the affairs of the province until his sudden departure to England in 1722. During his absence, Lieutenant-Governor Dummer led the province and navigated a conflict with the Indians. Grandfather also shared a story about Cotton Mather's concern over the smallpox epidemic in 1721, showcasing the historical significance of the disease and its impact on the early settlers.|"['1.

During a dark time in Boston, the smallpox disease had reappeared, causing fear and concern among the townspeople. This deadly illness had a history of devastating the population whenever it emerged, leaving behind a trail of graves. The source of the disease was often mysterious, sometimes brought by sailors or hidden in imported goods. Cotton Mather, a prominent figure in the community, discovered a method called Inoculation that could potentially lessen the severity of smallpox. This method had been used in other parts of the world with some success. With hope in his heart, Cotton Mather decided to consult with other physicians to explore this new approach. As he left his library, he encountered his son, Samuel, who, despite feeling anxious about the disease, found comfort in his father's determination to find a solution and in their faith.|"['1.

In Boston, during a smallpox outbreak, Cotton Mather, a minister, faced opposition from most physicians when he proposed inoculation. Only Doctor Zabdiel Boylston agreed to try it in his family. The other doctors fiercely opposed them, spreading rumors and causing fear among the people. Many believed it was against God's will to prevent the disease. Mather's past involvement in the Salem witch trials made people doubt his judgment. Despite facing ridicule and rejection, Mather continued to advocate for inoculation. The city was filled with red flags on infected houses, and the streets were somber with the presence of death. The story shows how fear, ignorance, and superstition can hinder progress and compassion.|"[""1.

During a time when the practice of inoculation faced strong opposition, Cotton Mather, determined to save his son Samuel from disease, decided to proceed despite threats from the angry townspeople. Mather's resolve was unwavering, even in the face of danger. Samuel and Mr. Walter, Mather's son-in-law, were successfully inoculated, as were many others by Doctor Boylston. Although some died from the disease, those who followed the physician's advice were spared. Despite the success, the people remained skeptical. An attempt on Mather's life with a hand-grenade containing only brimstone and assaf[oe]tida highlighted the resistance faced by those seeking to do good. Eventually, as inoculation became widely accepted, Mather was recognized for his wisdom and foresight.

Grandfather explained how the governors of the American colonies were often appointed by the king based on connections rather than merit, leading to conflicts with the legislature. Governor Burnet, despite his good character, faced challenges as he was bound by the king's instructions. His term was marred by disputes with the legislature, which ultimately led to his death. The refusal to grant him a salary during his lifetime contrasted with the grand funeral held in his honor. The changing social norms influenced by English fashion and the extravagant lifestyles of the royal governors and wealthy individuals marked a shift towards pomp and ceremony. The old chair witnessed this transformation, likely attending grand balls and festivals characterized by luxury and opulence.|"['1.

Long ago, our ancestors traded not only black slaves from Africa but also Indians from South America and white people from Ireland. The Irish were sold for a certain number of years to cover their voyage costs. Irish girls were even advertised for sale in newspapers. Meanwhile, the ladies of those times wore splendid dresses made of silks, satins, and brocades. They had enormous hooped-petticoats and wore high head-dresses. The men also dressed lavishly in coats of figured velvet and waistcoats made of gold brocade. They wore periwigs like the Tie, Spencer, and Brigadier, along with three-cornered hats laced with gold. The men had shining buckles on their clothes and shoes, and swords with beautiful hilts. Governor Belcher, who adorned Grandfather's chair in the Province House, polished and varnished it, gilding the carved work and adding a blue damask cushion with a golden fringe.|"['1.

Governor Belcher spent much of his term trying to stabilize the currency. The pine-tree shillings were gone, replaced by paper bills valued at three pence or more, but their worth kept decreasing. The people faced endless problems due to the devaluing currency. Suspicions arose that Belcher was trying to impose the Episcopal worship, leading to his resignation in 1740. William Shirley took over, known for his law background but was an active governor. In 1744, war erupted between France and England. Shirley planned an attack on Louisbourg in 1745, a French stronghold near Nova Scotia. The siege required extensive preparation, including gathering soldiers, arms, and support from neighboring colonies. The choice of a general was crucial as military experience was lacking after a long period of peace.|"['1.

During a time of conflict, Governor Shirley chose William Pepperell, a respected merchant, to lead the troops despite his lack of military expertise. Pepperell agreed to become General, rallying the townspeople to arm themselves with whatever weapons they could find. The blacksmiths tirelessly repaired old muskets, horse-pistols, and pikes from past wars. The recruits, mostly farmers and tradesmen, arrived in Boston in their humble attire, marching with determination. Though unpolished, their spirit and courage were unmatched. The army, accompanied by the beat of drums, set sail for Louisbourg in March 1745. The departure marked a moment of calm after the fervor of preparation, leaving the town in a state of quiet anticipation.|['1.

During a time of great anticipation and worry, the community awaited news of their loved ones fighting in the army. The old and women felt anxious, realizing the dangers their sons, husbands, and brothers faced. The boys missed the usual sounds of marching to school. Ministers prayed fervently for New England's army. Families prayed for the safety of their dear ones. Governor Shirley was restless, constantly seeking updates on the troops. Finally, a bell rang, signaling the surrender of Louisbourg. The joyful noise of bells and cannons filled the air, and the streets echoed with cheers.

"""The English Parliament,"" said Grandfather, ""agreed to pay the colonists for all the expenses of the siege. In 1749, two hundred and fifteen chests of Spanish dollars and one hundred casks of copper coin arrived in Boston from England, totaling about a million dollars. Twenty-seven carts carried the money to the provincial treasury. Grandfather explained that war brings physical and moral evil that no amount of gold can compensate. The siege tested the colonists' war readiness for the Revolution. The success against Louisbourg led to a plan to conquer Canada by Shirley and Pepperell, which was not executed. In 1746, fear arose due to the French fleet led by the Duke d‚ÄôAnville, but disasters caused the fleet to retreat. Governor Shirley faced unrest in 1747 when the Boston mob protested the impressment of citizens by British Commodore Knowles. Peace between France and England in 1748 allowed the governor to relax.

The old cat, comfortable by the fire, joined in the warmth and coziness of the moment. Grandfather recounted the history of a chair from the year 1748, highlighting the treaty that restored Louisbourg to the French. The French, fearing another war, built strong fortifications in North America, encircling the English colonies. These forts stood amidst the vast forests, a stark contrast of military might in serene landscapes. The tensions escalated, leading to the outbreak of the Old French War in 1754. Governor Shirley, a key figure, took command in the English forces, leaving behind the comfort of home to face the challenges of war.

During the Old French War, Grandfather found the expulsion of the Acadians most intriguing. Since 1604, the people of Acadia lived uncertain of the ruling kingdom. Despite their peaceful nature, they suffered in wars between the French and English, who vied to mistreat them. In 1755, Acadia was captured by Massachusetts soldiers, accusing the Acadians of aiding the French. About 7,000 Acadians were displaced, some becoming prisoners and sent to English colonies. Their homes were destroyed, and their lives uprooted. In Massachusetts, the Acadians faced a bleak existence, separated from loved ones. Families were torn apart, leaving many in despair.

Many bonds of affection were broken among the exiled Acadians. They had lost their country, friends, and rural wealth. Cut off from the world, they stood on the wharf, surrounded by curious New Englanders. The Boston schoolboys initially teased them but were moved to tears by their despair. Wealthy merchants observed from a distance, seemingly untouched. The Acadians, seeking food and shelter, wandered the streets, sharing their plight in unintelligible words. Some knocked on doors of grand mansions, while others sought help from humble homes. Let's hope no one turned them away hungry. Perhaps some found themselves at the Province House, where they encountered Governor Shirley. Misery gave them the right to enter freely, seeking aid in their time of need.|"['1.

During the Old French War, Governor Shirley faced challenges leading the troops. Shirley seldom enjoyed the comfort of his chair in the Province House as he was often busy with military duties. Despite his efforts, Shirley faced criticism, including suspicion regarding his French wife's loyalty. This suspicion, along with his inefficiency as a general, led to his removal from command in 1756. Shirley's downfall was not only due to his personal life but also his failure as a military leader. The Acadians, who suffered greatly during this time, were exiled from their homes with little hope of returning. The story of their plight serves as a reminder of the importance of peace and the sanctity of one's home.|"['1.

Grandfather's chair, though immobile, held tales of the Old French War. Battles and sieges echoed through Boston, where the woods teemed with warriors. Tribes allied with the French or English, disrupting the forest's peace. Musket fire and cannon roars drove beasts to the coasts. Children imagined couriers galloping with news. Grandfather recounted the Battle of Lake George in 1755, where Colonel Williams fell, but the English prevailed. Disasters plagued the English until Sir Jeffrey Amherst took charge in 1759. The conquest of Canada was the goal. Three armies advanced, including General Wolfe's ascent up a precipice to capture Quebec. The victory at Quebec marked a splendid triumph for England.|"['1.

In 1757, during the fierce battle in America, General Wolfe led his soldiers bravely, receiving a mortal wound but refusing to let go until victory was assured. As the French fled, he peacefully passed away, satisfied with his triumph. Grandfather shared this tale with Laurence, emphasizing the glory of Wolfe's sacrifice. The Old French War concluded with this significant victory, leading to the surrender of French territories to the English in 1763. Grandfather also recounted the great fire in Boston in 1700 and the proclamation of George III as the king of Great Britain. The chair in their possession had witnessed the changing times, from royal proclamations to the fight for independence. Governor Thomas Pownall, who succeeded Shirley, opted for a more passive role during the war, choosing to stay informed from the comfort of the chair.|"['1.

"""Grandfather explained that Governor Pownall faced no criticism when he left Massachusetts to govern South Carolina in 1759, as unity was crucial to protect the country from the French. Laurence imagined a mystical tie between the chair and Massachusetts' destiny. Despite Sir Francis Bernard deeming the chair unworthy in 1760, Grandfather defended him, citing the chair's worn state due to past incidents. Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson, aware of the chair's history, persuaded Bernard to let him restore it, aiming to bring back its original glory from the Earl of Lincoln's oak tree.

Laurence admired Mr. Hutchinson's bright thoughts and imagined the former owners of the chair inspiring him. Grandfather, however, found Mr. Hutchinson's History dull despite his accuracy compared to Mr. Bancroft. Grandfather mused about Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson's reverie by the fireside, reflecting on the changes connected to the chair. Hutchinson, a devoted monarchist, wouldn't mourn the end of the original republican government. He envisioned a future with an aristocratic class and a weakened desire for self-government among the people. Hutchinson saw a society with hereditary rank and envisioned a future of vast estates passed down through generations. Grandfather shared these reflections with Laurence, concluding with a metaphor of Hutchinson's dreams crumbling like castles in the fire. Finally, Grandfather noticed the time and gently touched little Alice, who had fallen asleep on the chair's arm.|"['1.

Grandfather's chair sat beside the fireplace, casting intricate patterns of light and shadow across the room. The children, tired of the stormy weather, were eager to hear more about the chair's history. Grandfather, always ready to share tales of the past, waited for their request. Charley, feeling cooped up indoors, longed to hear stories about the chair rather than be stuck inside. Laurence, intrigued by the chair's connections to famous figures, imagined them sitting in it. Grandfather, acknowledging the chair's age and significance, settled into it to continue his stories. The lion's head on the chair seemed almost alive, evoking a sense of storytelling magic.

"""Very well,"" said Grandfather; ""and you remember this was around 1763, at the end of the Old French War. To understand the chair's remaining adventures, let me explain the New England colonies' situation in brief.""The people adored the English king, even more so as they couldn't see his flaws from 3000 miles away. Their love grew during the war, where they fought beside English soldiers. The colonies had grown in strength and population, feeling less dependent on England. Canada and Acadia were now British territories, removing past fears. However, England passed laws benefiting itself over America, like the Stamp Act, imposing taxes without representation.

Grandfather spoke about the impact of the English Parliament passing an oppressive act, which stirred up the old Puritan spirit in the American colonies. The Stamp Act led to a unified response from the colonies, culminating in the formation of the Congress in New York. This Congress petitioned the king and Parliament for the repeal of the Stamp Act. Grandfather highlighted the importance of this gathering as the first representation of the American people from both north and south. While the Congress sought peaceful resolutions, the people, especially the younger generation, took more direct action, such as hanging effigies on the Liberty Tree to protest against figures like the Earl of Bute and Andrew Oliver. These actions displayed the growing unrest and defiance towards British taxation policies.|"['1.

Lieutenant-Governor Hutchinson was once respected and loved by the people but chose to support the king over their rights. This decision led to scorn and hatred from the people towards him. On a summer evening in 1765, a bonfire was lit in King Street, a signal for the people of Boston to gather. The crowd, including laborers and seafaring men, expressed anger towards high officers like Governor Bernard and Hutchinson. The mob grew angrier, even laughing at the thought of causing destruction. Meanwhile, in his mansion on Garden Court Street, Hutchinson sat peacefully, unaware of the brewing unrest. He had shed his official attire and seemed content in his home, momentarily forgetting about the turmoil caused by the Stamp Act and the king's oppressive rule.|"[""1.

The lit wax candles illuminated a lavish room with opulent furniture. Portraits of Hutchinson's distinguished ancestors adorned the walls, signifying their honorable legacy in the country's history. The setting exuded the essence of a wealthy, aristocratic gentleman, who held himself above the common folk with no fear. In a corner lay the scarlet robes of the chief justice, a position also held by Hutchinson. His beloved daughter sat beside him, gazing affectionately at her father. Suddenly, a shadow crossed her face as distant sounds caught her attention. While Hutchinson remained unperturbed, his family grew anxious, straining to hear the approaching commotion. A neighbor burst in, warning of an unruly mob heading their way. Despite the alarm, Hutchinson, confident in his position, dismissed the threat, only to realize the overwhelming power of the enraged crowd at his doorstep.

During a tumultuous time, a mob violently stormed the lieutenant-governor's house, destroying everything in their path. The rioters shattered furniture, smashed tables, and tore apart valuable manuscripts. The ancestral portraits were ripped from the walls, and even the mirror was shattered. The house was left in ruins, with only the walls standing by morning. Despite the chaos, some neighbors showed kindness to the displaced family.

On a stormy day, the equinoctial gale blew violently, scattering yellow leaves from the Liberty Tree. Mr. Oliver, drenched, looked haggard beneath the tree where Mr. Richard Dana administered an oath. A vast crowd witnessed Mr. Oliver swear off stamp distribution, showing the people's power. Laurence found the event dignified, with the people acting thoughtfully. Grandfather noted the conflict Mr. Oliver faced, torn between loyalty to the king and the people's demands. In 1766, the Stamp Act was repealed due to American discontent. Clara asked about the fate of their chair left under the tree. Grandfather revealed it was repaired and placed at the British Coffee House in King Street. The despotic king and ministry imposed new taxes, leading to British soldiers landing in Boston in 1768, intimidating the free town.|"['1.

In November, additional regiments arrived in Boston, swelling the troop count to four thousand. The Common was dotted with their tents, while some soldiers found shelter in Faneuil Hall, revered for its past liberty meetings. Another regiment occupied the Old State House. The lower floor had been an exchange for merchants, while the upper stories housed judges, representatives, and the governor's council. The soldiers' presence disrupted daily life, with sentinels stationed throughout the town challenging passersby. Even on Sundays, military music drowned out church hymns, unsettling the Puritan descendants. Despite calls for immediate action against the British, wiser heads prevailed. The chair, a symbol of power, was often occupied by loyalists and officers, mocking the locals. Grandfather recounted the tension building as the people braced for further provocations.|"['1.

During this time, a tragic incident occurred due to the escalating tensions between the townspeople and the British soldiers stationed in King Street, now known as State Street. A young German boy, only eleven years old, was fatally shot by a custom-house officer after he fired a musket at some lads who were snowballing his windows. This event heightened the existing resentment towards the British crown's representatives. The soldiers were stationed in a court of guard at the Old State House, with cannons pointed towards the town-house. The custom-house, located near the Suffolk bank, had a sentinel guarding its front. The ill-will between the townspeople and the soldiers led to confrontations, with the younger generation particularly hostile towards the red-coats. The situation was tense, and the stage was set for a tragic event that would significantly impact relations between England and America.|"['1.

Once or twice, arguments led to a fight, but it ended without much attention. Around eight in the evening, an alarm bell rang suddenly for an unknown reason. This caused many to rush out of their homes, thinking it was a fire alarm. However, there was no fire or smoke. Most returned home to talk with their families. Some, feeling a strange event approaching, stayed in the streets. Later, close to nine o'clock, a group of young men passed by the town-house and down King Street. The sentinel in front of the custom-house, his musket gleaming in the light, watched as they approached. The young men, Boston locals, believed they had the right to walk freely. A dispute ensued, drawing more soldiers and townspeople. The tension escalated, and Captain Preston arrived with soldiers, facing the angry crowd. This moment could have been a chance for reconciliation between England and America, but it turned into a crisis.|"['1.

If the king's soldiers harmed any American, it meant a fight to the end. America vowed to destroy royal authority until it lay in ruins. The soldiers faced a furious crowd, ready to charge. Captain Preston signaled, perhaps to fire, amid the chaos. Muskets flashed, filling the street with smoke and echoes. Eleven New Englanders lay wounded or still. Blood stained the snow, a grim reminder of the tragedy. Little Alice wept at the tale's brutality. Grandfather regretted not softening the story for her tender heart. The Boston Massacre stirred the town, leading to a trial where soldiers were acquitted due to provocation. Governor Hutchinson calmed the people, promising justice. The soldiers were removed, and peace was restored.|"[""1.

Grandfather shared with the children a book of portraits depicting various British peers and members of Parliament who either supported or opposed America's rights. Notable enemies included the Earl of Bute, Mr. Grenville, and Lord North. However, friends of America like Mr. Pitt, Earl of Chatham, used eloquence to warn England against injustice. Grandfather highlighted figures like Edmund Burke, Colonel Barr√©, and Charles James Fox, who supported America. Despite differing views, Grandfather emphasized the integrity and honor on both sides during the revolutionary contest. He urged respect for loyalty, even among royalists, who sacrificed for their beliefs. Grandfather noted King George III's unfortunate situation, portraying him as honest but ill-suited for his influential role.

Grandfather recounted the tale of the troubled life of the English monarch who, in his madness and blindness, saw his royal palace as a dark prison. Moving on to the Boston Tea Party of 1773, Grandfather described how the Americans, angered by unjust taxes, refused the tea brought by English merchants. The people of Boston, after much debate, demanded the tea ships be sent back to England. Governor Hutchinson's refusal led to a disguised group dumping the tea into the harbor. These individuals, dressed as Native Americans, remained anonymous to avoid punishment. The event, known as the Boston Tea Party, marked a significant act of defiance against British rule.|"['1.

When news of this daring act reached England, King George was furious. Parliament swiftly enacted a law prohibiting vessels from loading or unloading at Boston's port. The goal was to harm merchants and impoverish the poor by depriving them of work. Simultaneously, another law was passed stripping away rights and privileges granted in the Massachusetts charter. Governor Hutchinson was called to England for advice on American affairs. General Gage, a veteran of the French War and later commander of British forces in America, replaced him. Gage made Salem the new capital by relocating the General Court there. This period was described as the darkest in Massachusetts, resembling the days of Sir Edmund Andros. Boston was desolate, with closed businesses and idle workers. Contributions poured in from across America to aid the suffering Bostonians.|"[""1.

After dusk, Grandfather narrated the tired troops' return to Charlestown, dusty and wounded from the battle. Nearly three hundred lay wounded or dead along the road from Concord. The yeomanry had fought back against the British invaders. The conflict began when the British fired on the minute men near Lexington, sparking the Revolution. As Grandfather shared these historical events, the children wondered about the missing chair from the British Coffee House. Meanwhile, a twenty-thousand-strong army besieged Boston, leading to the Battle of Bunker Hill. General Warren fell, and the British won at a high cost.

The kids gathered around Grandfather, staring at him with admiration. Even little Alice looked up with wide eyes, hanging on his every word. Grandfather hesitated briefly, unsure whether it was respectful to mention Washington in a tale where an old chair took center stage. Nevertheless, he decided to continue, promising a simple account of the hero when necessary. Grandfather shared that upon General Washington‚Äôs arrival at Cambridge, he first surveyed the British troops through his spyglass and assessed his own army of about fourteen thousand soldiers. They were spread across a twelve-mile stretch from Roxbury to Mystic river. To oversee his troops, Washington set up headquarters in Cambridge near the colleges. He made his home in a mansion that might have belonged to a loyalist.

During the early days of leading the army, Washington's soldiers held him in high regard, viewing him as the crucial leader for the country's success against England. The soldiers had unwavering trust in his bravery, intelligence, and honesty. Eager to take action, Washington proposed a risky assault on the enemy but wisely sought counsel from his fellow generals. Among them were Artemas Ward, a lawyer and former troop commander, Charles Lee, a military expert with his loyal dogs, and Israel Putnam, a farmer turned soldier known as Old Put. Gates and Greene, respected officers, were also present. Despite Washington's plan to storm the English batteries, the council advised against it, opting to continue besieging Boston. The harsh conditions in the town, with shortages and illness, weakened the British forces more than any battle had.|"[""1.

In March 1776, General Washington, armed with ample powder, unleashed a fierce attack on Boston from Dorchester Heights. A cannonball struck the tower of Brattle Street church, a mark still visible today. Sir William Howe aimed to cross over and dislodge the Americans but was thwarted by a storm. Washington then set up a battery on Nook‚Äôs Hill, forcing the British out of Boston. Grandfather recounted the sorrow of the loyalists leaving their homes, regretting their allegiance to King George. He painted a picture of Chief Justice Oliver, once esteemed, now bitter and alone, walking the streets of Boston. The once loyal citizens now cursed the king they once revered.

The chief justice hurried through Cornhill, passing the ruins of the Old North church destroyed by British soldiers. He then reached the Old South, now used as a riding-school for dragoons.

Grandfather shared how the historic chair, once graced by General Washington, found itself in diverse settings after leaving Cambridge. It briefly resided in a Boston barber's shop, adorned with oddities and frequented by notable figures of the time.

In the early days, Grandfather shared a tale of significant news from Philadelphia in 1776. The signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4th marked the freedom of the thirteen colonies. The inhabitants embraced the news, ready to fight rather than return to English rule. Laurence admired the courage of those who signed the declaration, comparing it to soldiers in battle. Grandfather recounted key events of the Revolution, mentioning battles and victories like General Burgoyne's surrender and the treaty with France. He highlighted the unity with France and the presence of Lafayette and Count d‚ÄôEstaing in Boston Harbor. As the war unfolded in the Middle and Southern States, Massachusetts established a new government in 1780, electing John Hancock as governor. Despite the absence of a governor for four years, the people maintained order, showcasing their honor and unity. The war concluded with General Greene driving the British from the South and General Washington's victory at Yorktown in 1781. The Treaty of Peace in September 1783 solidified America's independence.|"[""1.

After many years of war, the soldiers from Massachusetts finally returned home in peace. Grandfather spoke of the respected leaders like General Lincoln and General Knox, who walked the streets in their blue and buff uniforms. These brave men deserved admiration for their courage and goodness. Some soldiers came back with injuries, while others never made it home, lost on the battlefield. Unfortunately, a few years later, another conflict arose called Shays‚Äô War, led by Captain Shays due to financial troubles in Massachusetts. Governor James Bowdoin sent General Lincoln to quell the rebellion with little bloodshed. In 1794, Samuel Adams became governor, a patriot who valued history and even bought the ancient Chair of State, where he sat for three honorable years.|"['1.

"""That is all,"" said Grandfather, heaving a sigh; for he could not help being a little sad, at the thought that his stories must close here. ""Samuel Adams died in 1803, at the age of above threescore and ten. He was a great patriot but a poor man. At his death, he left scarcely property enough to pay the expenses of his funeral. This precious chair, among his other effects, was sold at auction; and your Grandfather, who was then in the strength of his years, became the purchaser.""

Grandfather wished the chair could speak, imagining the wisdom it could share after witnessing ages of history. Struck by the idea, he decided to tell a fable about Laurence and Clara. As the lamp dimmed and the fire crackled, Grandfather found himself alone in his thoughts, until he noticed the chair seemingly come to life in the flickering firelight.

Grandfather greeted the ancient chair, surprised by its ability to speak. The chair revealed its silent nature, only speaking on rare occasions. It shared how it groaned when Lady Arbella passed, chuckled at a joke, and capered for joy when Simon Bradstreet replaced a tyrant. The chair also mentioned conversations with notable figures like Sir William Phips, Cotton Mather, and Samuel Adams, offering wisdom during historical events. Despite its insights, the chair admitted to speaking at inconvenient times, often when its occupants were napping or sick.

The wise old chair, with a lion's head, conveyed a profound message to Grandfather about the importance of Justice, Truth, and Love in leading a happy life. Grandfather, though, noted that these virtues were well-known and innate to all. The chair, surprised by this response, decided to remain silent for the next hundred years, promising to share any new wisdom it might gain during that time. As Grandfather awoke from his slumber, he realized it was just a dream induced by his heavy walking stick falling on his foot. The author of this tale, aware of the impact on young hearts, aims to create literature that nurtures rather than pollutes. Edward Temple, a young boy afflicted with an eye disorder, faced the prospect of darkness and isolation due to his condition, missing the light, his family, and his beloved books during this trying time.|"['1.

Little Emily sat next to Edward, acting like a skilled nurse. She observed his every move and expression, trying to fulfill his needs before he even spoke. However, she felt uneasy whenever she looked at the bandage, feeling as if Edward was distant because she couldn't see his eyes. George, a healthy boy, felt awkward around the sick, lacking experience in sympathizing with others' pain. Mr. Temple aimed to share true childhood stories of famous figures to help the children connect with the past. In 1738, a Quaker boy named Ben was born, with high expectations from his family and community. At six, Ben did nothing remarkable, until one day when he drew a picture of a sleeping baby, impressing his mother with his talent.|"['1.

As Ben grew older, he found joy in nature's colors and shapes. He admired the blue violets of spring, the wild roses of summer, and the scarlet cardinal-flowers of early autumn. In fall, he loved gazing at the colorful woods and the sunset clouds. Ben even tried drawing with chalk on barn doors. He made friends with Mohawk Indians who gave him red and yellow paint. With his mother's indigo, he mixed colors and made green. Ben wanted paint brushes but had none to buy. So, he cleverly made brushes from a black cat's fur. His talent caught the eye of a merchant from Philadelphia, who gifted him a paint box, brushes, canvas, and landscape engravings. Ben's artistic journey was just beginning.|"['1.

As Isaac grew older, he became more interested in important matters than making toys. He spent his days absorbed in books on mathematics and philosophy, pondering the stars and their mysteries. Even at a young age, Isaac Newton felt he would one day uncover these secrets. At fourteen, his mother wanted him to help manage the farm, but his passion for learning led him back to school and eventually to the University of Cambridge. Newton later made remarkable discoveries about light and gravity, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe.

In 1727, Sir Isaac Newton passed away at the age of eighty-five, leaving behind a legacy of scientific achievements. Even after his death, many believe he continues to explore the mysteries of the universe. Newton's contributions were immense, inspiring others like George to ponder what more he could have invented if he had lived in modern times. Newton's dedication to studying the stars and celestial bodies, even spending nights in a tower observing them, fascinated many. The conversation between the Temple family members, including the curious George and the thoughtful Emily, highlighted the importance of perseverance and ingenuity, regardless of challenges like blindness.

Sam refused to stand at Uttoxeter market due to his pride and his father's illness. Despite his father's sorrowful departure to the market, the boy's heart ached with guilt. He imagined his father offering books to uninterested people. His mother suggested Sam should have gone instead. Sam's imagination haunted him with the image of his father collapsing in the market, ignored by the crowd. His heart weighed heavy with regret.|"[""1.

God could not forgive Sam yet; he wasn't truly sorry. If he was, he'd have rushed to Uttoxeter, fallen at his father‚Äôs feet, and confessed his fault. But Sam's pride stopped him. He should have done it for himself, his father, and God. After sunset, Michael Johnson came home, saying nothing. No words on Sam's disobedience were spoken. His father passed away, leaving Sam to face the world alone. Sam never forgot the Uttoxeter market story. In his poverty and success, the memory haunted him. The tale made Emily cry, Edward listened intently, and George stayed in the shadows. The village street bustled with traders, farmers, and a puppet-show.

When Noll was just a baby, a strange incident occurred. A giant ape from the family snatched him and climbed to the roof of the house, grinning mischievously. Luckily, the beast brought Noll back safely, and it was seen as a sign that he would achieve great things. One day, a royal messenger came to announce that King James was coming to dine with Sir Oliver Cromwell.

The young boy showed respect to the king, as was the custom in those times. King James, proud of his knowledge, tested Noll's Latin skills and then introduced him to his son. The prince extended his hand for Noll to kiss, surprising everyone. While the adults dined, the children played games like ball or blindman‚Äôs buff.

Once upon a time, a king finished his meal and left, forgetting a long-ago feud between Prince Charles and Noll Cromwell. If only the prince had remembered the lesson his father taught from that quarrel, he might have lived a happier life. When Charles became king, he forgot the importance of treating his subjects as equals. The people, led by the Puritans, fought against him, defeating him in battles and dethroning him. During this conflict, a strong leader played a significant role in the downfall of royal authority. This leader had the power to spare King Charles or condemn him to death. Unfortunately, the king was sentenced to death, and the same victorious general had the chance to save him but chose not to. As Charles met his end, the general watched from a window, reflecting on the events that led to the king's demise.

In the grand palace at Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, a princess named Christina was born in 1626. Her father, King Gustavus Adolphus, known as the Lion of the North, was a renowned warrior. Despite not being conventionally beautiful, the king adored his daughter. When Christina fell ill as a young child, the king rushed to her side, celebrating her recovery with a festival. He took her on his journeys, even to a fortress where cannons thundered in salute. Though initially concerned for her safety, he was delighted to see her fearlessness. The king found joy in playing with his daughter, momentarily forgetting the weight of his kingdom.

Alas! The king could not long enjoy Christina's company. At the age of four, Gustavus was called to lead the allied armies in Germany against the Emperor. His greatest sorrow was parting with his daughter. Before leaving, he entrusted Christina to the Swedish Senators, asking them to care for her like fathers if he did not return. As he prepared to depart, Christina tried to speak to him with a rehearsed speech, but he was preoccupied. When she tugged at his coat, he realized her distress and embraced her, shedding tears despite his bravery. After two years, news of a victorious yet tragic battle at Lutzen arrived, revealing Gustavus's death. Christina, at just six years old, was declared Queen of Sweden in a solemn assembly.|"['1.

The Swedes did not ponder certain questions. Old Lars Larrson held Christina and saw a resemblance to the great Gustavus. Overwhelmed, Larsson declared her the true heir to the throne. As a child, Christina enjoyed the attention of men declaring her queen, but she would soon realize power doesn't guarantee joy. Governed by a regency, she was required to attend public events and behave as a queen. At seven, she faced odd Muscovy ambassadors, feared to amuse or frighten her. Despite her royal status, Christina had a tutor in John Mathias but lacked female guidance. Isolated from women, she excelled in academics and horsemanship but lacked grace. Restless and ill-tempered, Christina's upbringing contrasts with a New England girl's nurturing. Her story serves as a lesson on the importance of character development and empathy.|"['1.

At eighteen, Christina ruled Sweden alone, dressed strangely but with a commanding air. Her fierce eyes intimidated even battle-hardened General Wrangel.
