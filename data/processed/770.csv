"Title: The Bastables and Their Treasure Hunt

Before I delve into the exciting tale of the Bastables and their treasure-seeking adventures, let me paint a picture of our protagonists. The Bastables reside in a semi-detached house with a modest garden on Lewisham Road. The six Bastable children, led by Dora, followed by Oswald, Dicky, Alice, Noel, and the youngest, Horace Octavius, embark on thrilling escapades. Their mother has passed away, but their father is an integral part of their lives.

Oswald, the eldest son, is a bright lad who once won a Latin prize, while Dicky excels in mathematics. The twins, Alice and Noel, add a spark of mischief at the age of ten. As the story unfolds, one of the Bastable children narrates their quest for treasure, keeping you guessing until the very end. It was Oswald who sparked the idea of the treasure hunt, setting the stage for an enthralling journey filled with mystery and excitement."|"[""1.

Dora was busy fixing a big hole in one of Noel's stockings, torn when they played shipwrecked mariners. H.O. got hurt that day, and the scar remained. Dora mended things, unlike the others. Alice once knitted a red scarf for Noel, but he didn't wear it. They used it as a pennon, adding color to their mostly black and grey belongings since their mother passed. The family's fortune declined after their father's illness. Money was tight, and they couldn't afford new things. The silverware was sold, and the new ones weren't as good. They stopped going to school, waiting for their father to afford a good one. Bills piled up, and Father struggled. The children decided to seek treasure to help their family.|"[""1.

Noel proposed revisiting all the books to spark new ideas, but his suggestion was dismissed since he simply wanted to return to his old books. Dicky then proposed a quiet brainstorming session to find treasure. H. O., short for Horace Octavius, needed more time to think. As they pondered, Oswald suggested pretending to rob people on Blackheath like Dick Turpin. Dora objected, likening it to stealing. Oswald then joked about saving someone who turns out to be the Prince of Wales. Dora suggested using a divining rod to find gold. She explained that the rod kicks when it detects gold underground. The children each shared their imaginative ways to find treasure during the brainstorming session.|"[""1.

Dora and Dicky appeared displeased, but I nudged Noel to expedite, and then he expressed his disinterest in playing further. The others seemed eager to argue. I encouraged Noel to act decisively and not be indecisive, and eventually, he pondered between publishing his poetry or seeking a princess to wed. I suggested exploring opportunities to earn money, considering the advertisements promising easy earnings. Dicky, as usual, kept his creations and thoughts hidden until completion. Oswald proposed a treasure hunt as a way to wealth, emphasizing that action is more exciting than mere talk. The narrative aims to focus on the engaging parts, avoiding tedious details, as the essence of stories lies in events unfolding.|['1.

When we decided to search for treasure, we gathered in the cellar and lit the gas. Oswald wanted to dig there, but it had stone flags. After rummaging through old boxes and broken furniture, we found sturdy spades we used at the seaside years ago. We dusted them off, as the girls refused to use cobweb-covered tools. We outlined a square in the garden and began digging. Despite our efforts, we only unearthed worms and stones. We shifted to a softer spot in the flower bed and started a smaller hole. Digging was tough, and we got very hot, but still found nothing. Albert-next-door peered over the wall, unimpressed by our quest. He scoffed at our treasure hunt, not understanding the thrill of adventure. Although we tolerated his lack of imagination, we knew it stemmed from his limited exposure to books.|"['1.

We worked hard digging a deep hole to reach a treasure. Oswald suggested making a tunnel, so we took turns digging. Pincher, our dog, helped too. He's good at digging for rats, though he gets dirty. We encouraged Albert-next-door to dig with his hands in the tunnel, but he was scared. Instead, he dug with his feet and caused the ground to collapse on him. He cried, and we feared the police would come. Dicky went for help, and Albert's uncle arrived. He dug Albert out, showing curiosity about the situation. Alice explained how moral force was used to convince Albert to dig. In the end, everyone was safe, and Albert's uncle found the situation quite interesting.|"['1.

Dora expressed regret for Albert's ordeal, wishing it had been one of them instead. They were digging for treasure, but Albert screamed as they unearthed him. His uncle wiped his face and put the handkerchief in his pocket, continuing the excavation. Albert looked comical, covered in dust and mud. The uncle doubted their treasure hunt's success, having expertise in the matter. They agreed to split the findings, and Albert's spirits lifted. Then, a real mystery unfolded. Inspired by detective stories, they embarked on an adventure. Unable to afford a seaside trip, they found excitement in their own backyard, hidden behind a horse-chestnut tree.|"[""1.

It was sweltering outside, so we played in the garden, creating a tent from blankets and a clothes-horse. Even though it was hot in the tent, it felt different from indoors. We pretended to be shipwrecked mariners, enjoying treats we saved from the sinking ship. Alice wanted to solve mysteries like detectives, but we explained the reality of crime. She dreamed of catching coiners with her bloodhound. Oswald and Dicky discussed detective work, using newspapers to piece together clues. Alice, lost in thought, seemed preoccupied. We even checked the paper for real mysteries, but nothing fit. Although Oswald suspected something in the news about burglars and mysterious deaths in Holloway, we decided to let it go. Holloway was too far away.|['1. What did the children use to create a tent in the garden?\nA) Ropes\nB) Sticks\nC) Blankets\nD) Pillows\nE) Tarp', '2.

Dora and H. O. decided to explore the shops instead of staying in the tents. Oswald, being perceptive, sensed that there was more to it than just a game. Alice shared her concern about seeing mysterious figures moving around in a nearby house with a light on. They contemplated the possibility of burglars. Noel suggested keeping watch that night. During tea-time, they enjoyed a melon and made crafts with the seeds. Oswald convinced Alice to join in watching the house next door, despite the potential danger. As they hid in the chestnut tree, a cloaked figure carrying a mysterious burden emerged from the neighboring garden, surprising them all.|"[""1. What did Oswald sense about Dora and H.

We held our breath as it passed beneath the tree where we stood, then tapped gently on the back door and was allowed in. A light flickered in the downstairs room, but the shutters were closed. Dicky exclaimed, ‘My eye! Wouldn’t the others be envious they missed this!’ Alice, however, was uneasy. She whispered, ‘It's not burglars; they were bringing things in, not taking them out. They must be counterfeiters. Let’s retire for now and come back later with help.’ Oswald, the eldest, climbed a flower-pot to peek through a hole in the shutter. Instead of coiners, he saw two young ladies having supper. As he tried to see more, Dicky accidentally caused Oswald to fall among the pots. Alice, quick to act, ran to get help. Just as Albert's uncle arrived, Oswald lost consciousness.|"[""1.

The neighbors didn't come out during the commotion. Albert's uncle swiftly carried Oswald, the unconscious detective, over the wall into their house. Oswald was tended to, his head bandaged, and he was put to bed. The next day, a large bump on his forehead caused discomfort. Albert's uncle later spoke sternly to Oswald, scolding him for spying on the ladies and prying into their affairs. Feeling guilty, Oswald apologized to the youngest lady next door for peeking through their window, explaining they mistook them for coiners. The lady forgave him and revealed they were trying to keep their presence at home a secret. Despite spending most of their treasure hunt earnings, the children decided to continue searching for opportunities to make money.|"[""1.

"Alice attempted to teach Pincher to beg, but he was too clever to beg when he knew there were no treats. Meanwhile, the rest of the siblings were busy roasting potatoes over the fire they intentionally made, even though it was warm. The potatoes turned out well once they cut off the burnt parts, but they scolded Oswald for not washing them first, calling him a ""dirty boy."" Oswald suggested trying to rescue someone instead of focusing on their advertisement idea. Noel, lying on the sofa, dreamily mentioned finding a princess or writing poetry. Dicky questioned if Noel had enough poetry for a book, as only seven poems were understandable. They decided to copy the poems on drawing paper to send to a publisher, with Oswald drawing a picture of a ship sinking. They contemplated sending the poems by post but eventually decided to deliver them in person to a newspaper in London."|['1.

When we left, we walked a long way, and a policeman suggested we return through Smithfield. They no longer burn people there, so it was dull and tiring. Noel, a delicate poet, grew weary. We snacked on buns from our shillings and reached Fleet Street late afternoon. The gas and electric lights illuminated the area, including a vibrant Bovril sign. At the Daily Recorder office, we inquired about the Editor. Directed to another office, we found a man in a glass case who instructed us to write our names and purpose. Oswald sealed a letter marked 'Very private' and handed it to the boy. Surprisingly, we were summoned upstairs after the Editor read Noel's poems. Inside, we found a cozy room with a young, tired Editor who kindly reviewed Noel's work.|"['1.

The Editor of the Daily Recorder invited Noel and me for tea. Noel, overwhelmed, stood speechless as the Editor praised his poetry. Oswald reassured him that it was just the beginning. The Editor shared that their paper did not publish poetry but promised to find a place for Noel's work elsewhere. As we left, the Editor mentioned Lord Tottenham, a mysterious figure who roamed the heath. Despite the Editor's promise, Noel's poetry never made it into the Daily Recorder. Instead, we stumbled upon a story in a magazine that misrepresented our tea with the Editor, but it included all of Noel's poems.

Accidentally, we stumbled upon a Princess while playing in Greenwich Park. Noel had vowed to find and marry a Princess all on his own, and he actually did! It was odd because often what people predict doesn't come true. We love playing in the parts of the park near the Heath. Sometimes we take lunch in a basket and enjoy the day in the park.

"""It's not a bear,"" Oswald assured as we cautiously continued along a winding path and reached a lawn, where we found Noel. His collar was askew, and an inky mark adorned his face from a recent mischief. Ignoring Dora's attempts to clean him up, Noel sported a loose bootlace. He stood mesmerized by a peculiar little girl. She resembled a delicate china doll, with a white face, yellow hair in tight pigtails, and an oversized forehead. Her eyes were small and blue, set above high cheekbones. Dressed in a quaint black frock with button boots, she cradled a blue kitten in a hammock chair. Unfazed, the girl confidently declared herself a princess, impressing us with her imaginative play. As we conversed, she generously offered us flat chocolates from a silver box. Revealing her extensive list of names, including royal titles, she claimed to be Queen Victoria's distant cousin.

We took a sheet of paper from an old exercise-book and made our little brother, H. O., prick his thumb to teach him bravery. H. O. was hesitant but agreed, so I helped him. As his blood formed a red bead, he was pleased, just as I had predicted. We wrote a letter with his blood, switching to crimson lake when the blood ran out. Oswald overheard Alice reassuring the prisoner that it was just a game. The prisoner stopped howling. Albert-next-door's uncle, captured by us, joked about the ransom, saying Albert wasn't worth it. Later, we roasted chestnuts and listened to Albert-next-door's uncle's stories until Father arrived. We planned to start our own newspaper after selling Noel's poetry to an editor.

To win her hand, he used his magic sword to control the dragon, saving the kingdom. They forgave the dragon, and at the wedding, all bones were saved for him.

Oswald, Alice, H. O., Dicky, and Noel decided to pool their resources and try a new way to make money. They saw an ad promising two pounds a week for anyone who could sell bottles of sherry. The children were excited and sent for the sample and instructions. When the package arrived, they found the sherry bottle sealed with yellow wax. As they read through the papers, they learned they had to get people to taste the sherry and then sell it to them. For every dozen bottles sold, they would earn two shillings. The children were hopeful but also realistic about the challenge of selling twenty dozen bottles a week. They were eager to start their new venture and see if they could indeed restore their fallen fortunes.|['1.

Alice and her siblings were experimenting with a bottle of Castilian Amoroso when the butcher unexpectedly visited. Alice, feeling flustered, tried to remain composed as she invited him in. The siblings had added sugar to improve the taste of the wine, and now they were faced with the challenge of selling it. Alice, determined to sell it to everyone who visited, also planned to find outside buyers. The butcher, looking for their father, was seated at the dining table where the bottle of Castilian Amoroso was on display. As Alice nervously fiddled with the bottle, she eventually found her confidence and began speaking rapidly, drawing from the information on a circular.|"['1.

The butcher tasted a little of the wine but found it too sweet. He kindly declined, mentioning that it didn't agree with him. Instead, he ordered some for his uncle, giving a shilling as commission. The next day, a lady came seeking donations for an orphanage. When offered the wine, she tasted it and then hurriedly left, scolding the children for trying to trick her. Alice apologized, explaining that they meant no harm. The lady, understanding the situation, apologized in return and left the room.

I met a lady who seemed nice, but she didn't buy the wine. Alice and I felt sad afterward. We decided not to sell to people who visit us. We kept the bottle dusty. A clergyman came by and invited us to Sunday school. We visited his neat, dry Vicarage. The servant, maybe Jane, let us in. Mr. Mallow, a stout man with spectacles, was writing. He seemed cross and scolded someone outside. We felt sorry for them. We explained we spend Sundays with Father. We decided not to sell sherry to those we like. The visit left us feeling different.|"[""1.

Mr. Mallow, a clergyman, offered to help the children, but his discussion about the dangers of alcohol upset them. The children defended themselves, mentioning that they had only consumed wine with sugar, which did not make them ill. Later, a lady entered the room, and the children tried to sell wine to her. The lady, Dora, got emotional and mentioned her promise to her late mother to take care of her siblings. Dora expressed her struggles and feelings of being misunderstood by her siblings. Oswald, the narrator, comforted Dora, realizing he had been too hard on her. The children reconciled, understanding Dora's sacrifices and promises to their mother. Despite the emotional chapter, they supported each other, showing their bond as siblings.|['1.

At around eight o'clock, there was a knock at the door. Eliza answered it, and it was poor Jane from the Vicarage. She brought a brown-paper parcel and a letter. Shortly after, Father summoned us to his study. On the table lay the open parcel with our bottle and glass on top, while Father held a letter covered in small black writing. He gestured towards the bottle and asked, 'What have you been up to now?' Father expressed doubt that clergymen could afford such costly wine but expressed interest in tasting it. We shared the remainder with him, deciding to give up our pursuit of earning extra money. The Castilian Amoroso sherry cheered Father up. Oswald realized that consulting with adults often made things seem less appealing. H.O.'s idea of a coconut-shy was abandoned due to lack of resources, and the plan to have Pincher dance with an organ was dropped upon realizing the cost. Despite a wet day and a tough mutton hash dinner, we found joy in imaginative play.|"['1.

We took out the flags, wooden sword, and drum. Oswald played while the girls washed up until Eliza mentioned having a toothache. The noise bothered her, so Oswald stopped immediately. When you're polite to Oswald, he always listens to your requests. Dicky paused and smoked the peace pipe we used for bubbles in the summer. We put tea leaves in it, but girls weren't allowed to smoke. Oswald said, 'Continue.' Dicky shared his idea about glass bottles being cheap. He proposed selling medicine bottles. The group discussed inventing a cure, debating on what illness to target. Dora suggested a complexion enhancer, but they recalled a soap incident. Noel wanted to create the medicine first. Oswald suggested a wound cure, but Dicky disagreed. They finally settled on choosing the disease before inventing the medicine.|['1.

After Dicky decided to catch a cold for an experiment, the rest of us tried various remedies to cure it. Alice made herb tea with sage, thyme, savory, marjoram, and parsley, which disagreed with Noel. Oswald concocted a mixture of alum, turpentine, sugar, and aniseed, but Eliza threw it away. Dora's gruel helped Noel's chest but couldn't pass as medicine. Dick's lemon-juice and sugar blend was well-liked, while H. O.'s peppermints dissolved in hot water were the favorite. Despite the failed attempts, it was a fun time with Noel's cold, having a fire in his room and the girls reading to him all day.

Oswald's cold persisted, troubling his head but not enough to confine him to bed. One day, he accidentally tripped over Alice, who was sitting on the stairs in the dark. Upset, Alice expressed her worry about Noel being unwell and Eliza refusing to call the doctor due to expenses. Feeling concerned, Oswald comforted Alice and encouraged her not to lose hope. Alice, fearing for Noel's health, decided to take matters into her own hands. She left secretly, asking Oswald to cover for her. Upon returning, she reassured Oswald that everything was fine. Later, when Eliza left to mail a letter, a knock at the door made the children think it was her. However, it turned out to be Albert's tired uncle.|"['1.

Albert's uncle sat on the edge of the shaky bed and checked Noel's pulse. He scolded the children for playing recklessly and giving Noel a cold. The uncle emphasized the importance of health and how risky their actions had been. He reminded them of the promise they made to their father and lectured them about the consequences of their actions. Despite feeling remorseful, Alice confessed to using a bad sixpence from the exchequer to send a telegram to the uncle. She was torn between her actions and the fear of being a thief. The uncle's stern words made the children realize the seriousness of their actions, and they apologized.

The following day, Albert's uncle took Noel away before Oswald could convince Alice to reveal the sixpence incident. Alice was unhappy, especially at night when guilt weighs heavy. None of us had money except Eliza, who demanded a reason for lending it. Oswald worried about the tainted sixpence and feared the police might come for Alice. Desperation grew as we couldn't find a solution. Oswald encountered Mrs. Leslie and, despite family honor, asked for a loan. Sacrificing pride, he sold flowers for tenpence to clear Alice's name. Oswald's actions, though not noble, saved his sister. Days later, a snowfall led to an unintended mishap with the Water Rates, teaching us a valuable lesson about consequences and responsibility.|"[""1.

We all deserved the punishment because the others would have shoveled down snow just as we did if they had thought of it. Even wrong things sometimes lead to adventures, as in stories about pirates or highwaymen. Eliza dislikes us being sent to bed early because it means she has to bring meals up and light the fire in Noel's room earlier than usual. But on this particular day, we got Eliza in a good mood by giving her a fake brooch, so she brought extra coal and chestnuts for us. While playing Red Indians in blankets, we heard noises downstairs, like someone moving a chair or poking a fire. Curious, we decided to investigate, thinking it might be a cat that got in. Oswald felt both scared and brave, preferring to face the unknown rather than wait in fear.|"['1.

The dim gas lamp barely flickered as we cautiously tiptoed out, cloaked in our blankets. We paused at the staircase, straining to hear any sound. Oswald signaled to Dicky, who fetched the broken toy pistol. As the eldest, I took charge. We weren't sure if it was the cat, but Dicky armed himself with the poker, ready to confront the intruder. Oswald proposed a game of burglars, with Dicky and him leading the way. As we descended, the light under Father's study door caught our attention. Emboldened by the thought of scaring the others, Oswald burst into the room, only to face a real robber. The intruder, though shabby, surrendered peacefully, revealing a pitiful collection of items.

The thief agreed and shared his past adventures with us. He mentioned being a highway robber and a pirate captain in his previous life. He expressed how being a pirate was an exciting profession, sailing the high seas, chasing prizes, and feeling the wind in his favor. The robber described the thrill of having a crew ready to support him and cannons aimed at trading ships. Despite the ups and downs, he found it to be a grand life. The children listened in awe as he recounted his daring escapades. Dora, dressed in her best, engaged in conversation with the thief, showing compassion for his past.

Alice inquired if the man had ever been involved in counterfeiting. They shared their experience of suspecting the gang next door of such activities. The man expressed relief that he had never engaged in counterfeiting, criticizing the unattractive modern coins and the secretive and dangerous nature of the business. Oswald, emulating his father's hospitality, offered the man a drink. The man mentioned his unsuccessful bush-ranging attempt earlier in the day and his encounter with the Lord Mayor's coach, finding no money except for the footman's pennies.

Our robber informed my Father about the other burglar and expressed regret for letting him escape. However, my Father was understanding, mentioning that the other burglar might have kids at home. He then inquired about the initial incident, finding it somewhat entertaining. The robber proceeded to recount how I had burst into the room with a pistol, creating a commotion. Despite feeling embarrassed by the exaggerated praise from the robber, I mustered the courage to clarify that it was all a misunderstanding and merely a game. Father commended my honesty, calling me a brave young individual. We then enjoyed a makeshift feast with bread, cheese, and mutton, sitting informally and relishing the moment.

We all chuckled and stopped talking loudly at each other. Noel's poetry is hilarious, and that piece turned out to be oddly accurate. When arguments start, they often spiral out of control, and before you know it, everyone is upset. Sometimes I find it so ridiculous that I want to laugh, but it's best not to because it only makes things worse. Have you ever noticed that? Alice suggested that Noel should be the poet laureate, and she even went outside to gather laurel leaves to make him a crown. We followed Alice around as she pretended to use a divining rod to find treasure. It was all fun and games until we realized the floorboard was loose, and we were just digging in the wrong place.|['1.

We believed she was joking, but when she tried to fit into the small hole, we realized she was serious. I suggested taking a closer look, but even lying down, we couldn't see anything. Except for Noel, who stood and likened us to great serpents at a magical pool, wanting to be a knight. Alice spotted something shiny, a half-sovereign, possibly dropped years ago by H.O. Dora suggested waiting to ask Father about it. H.O. wished to buy a discounted mask, but Dora urged patience. Albert's uncle, known for his articulate manner, joined the conversation. Oswald recounted the events, leading to the discovery of the coin. Albert's uncle praised the find and advised informing Father. The group left, with H.O. reflecting on the lesson learned.|"[""1.

Father informed the children that their Mother's Indian Uncle would be joining them for dinner the next night. He requested them to avoid moving the furniture overhead excessively and suggested that H.O. wear slippers to minimize noise. The children discussed how to spend a half-sovereign given by Father, deciding on a grand feast. They bought various items, including figs, almonds, raisins, a rabbit, and flowers for the dinner table. Eliza, the cook, prepared for the Indian Uncle's visit. The children placed the feast items in H.O.'s drawer, making him shift his belongings to Father's old portmanteau. They swore not to touch the feast until Dora permitted the next day. Despite efforts to be quiet, Eliza accidentally made a loud noise in the kitchen. Later, the children discreetly enjoyed the leftovers on the stairs.

When he returned to the study, he forgot to close the door properly. That door had always been troublesome ever since we removed the lock to retrieve the pencil sharpener H. O. had lodged in the keyhole. The Indian Uncle and Father engaged in a conversation about business, with Father asserting it required only a small amount of capital. The Uncle disagreed, suggesting it needed management instead. Feeling uncomfortable, Father swiftly changed the subject to vintage and poured the Uncle a drink. Oswald realized they shouldn't eavesdrop, even unintentionally. Dora complained about the dinner, mentioning wet brussels sprouts, grey potatoes, and burnt soup. Feeling sorry for the Uncle, they invited him for a delicious meal the next day to make amends.
