In the wilds of Africa, Arthur Spencer, a renowned trapper, encountered a terrifying ordeal that surpassed any adventure most hunters could imagine. Separated from his party, he awoke to the eerie laughter of spotted hyenas. Realizing he was surrounded by a pack of a hundred, he feigned death, hoping they would spare him. The hyenas, sniffing and biting at him, eventually carried him to their den, believing him to be dead. Throughout the night, he endured excruciating pain, thirst, and the putrid stench of the cavern. Left in the care of two hyenas, Spencer knew his only hope was to wait for a chance to escape, as attempting to fight them unarmed would mean certain death.|"['1.

The unfortunate man found a glimmer of hope as the hyena seemed to be leaving. Hour after hour, the animal lingered near the cave, causing the man to fear the return of the pack. Finally, on the second morning, the hyena grew restless and left for short periods but always returned. Eventually, around noon, the hyena left and did not come back. The man cautiously ventured out, finding no one in sight. Weak and faint, he managed to escape and was later rescued by a group of Boers who tended to his wounds and helped him to safety. Despite his injuries, his strong will and iron constitution led to a swift recovery. Meanwhile, Jim, a young Englishman at the Vega Verde mine, felt his chance to prove himself had arrived.

The foreman assured the group that he would take responsibility for the situation, mentioning the influence of Saint Gavino over the workers. As preparations were made for potential emergencies in the Asturias wilderness, the foreman armed himself cautiously. Meanwhile, a young lad in a blue jacket emerged from the background and headed towards the machinery. Jim Cayley observed the workers and ore heaps with the snow-capped mountains in the backdrop. He noticed the workers behaving suspiciously near the machinery. Suddenly, a tragic incident unfolded as a man was accidentally thrown to his death from a bucket.

In the past, California was a haven for sportsmen with abundant wildlife. The hills were alive with quail, and various waterfowl filled the lagoons, offering excellent hunting opportunities. Further inland, snipe were easily found in the swamps, and plains were home to antelope. The Sierra Nevadas housed deer and bears, providing a true paradise for hunters. A journey on the ship _Arizona_ took us to San Pedro, where we camped by the sea and hunted ducks. Moving inland, we stayed at a sheep ranch surrounded by picturesque hills. Despite the beautiful setting, we were stuck with a conservative Chinese cook who served boiled pork and beans relentlessly. Seeking bigger game, we ventured into the hills for deer and even encountered a grizzly bear.|['1.

My initial response was to shoot and take my chances, but then caution intervened, and I recalled that at a short distance buckshot would only injure and enrage a grizzly, known for their resilience. I remembered tales of Californians who suffered death or severe wounds from grizzlies. I refrained from firing, sat down quietly, and watched the bear move away. As I continued downstream, I spotted deer in the distance and prepared to stalk them when a noise behind me revealed the bear approaching rapidly. In a sudden turn of events, the bear attacked my companion, Halley. Despite my attempts to defend us, the bear turned its fury towards me. I fired at close range, narrowly escaping the bear's attack. After a tense encounter, the bear lay lifeless, and I rushed to aid the injured Halley, bandaging his wounds and seeking medical help.|"['1.

One day, a brave young man encountered a bear in a canyon. Excited and nervous, he fired at the bear, but his gun jammed, forcing him to run for his life. Fortunately, he had wounded the bear, allowing him to escape. Later, he tried to retrieve the bear's skin, but it was torn. The young man then fell ill and had to go to Italy with his mother for treatment. During his recovery, he read books and studied Italian antiquities, though he found them uninteresting. Before leaving, he traded his dormouse for a revolver, which he believed would protect him from brigands in Italy. He practiced using the revolver, preparing for any dangerous encounters.

We journeyed through Paris and other places, making stops along the way. I was still weak, and my mother was cautious about my health until we settled in Sorrento, a stunning place on the Bay of Naples with orange trees everywhere. The drive from Castellamare to Sorrento on a cliffside road was breathtaking. Despite being close to Vesuvius, my mother forbade me from going near it, much to my frustration. After spending weeks in Sorrento, I became familiar with the area and its people, even picking up some of the local language. One day, my mother needed things from Naples but couldn't go herself. She hesitantly asked if I could go for her. Though eager inside, I played it cool. Eventually, I embarked on the journey to Naples, enjoying an exciting day there. On my way back, I almost missed the train but negotiated a fair price with a driver to get me safely back to Sorrento.|"[""1.

The man, pale as a ghost, urged his mules to rush through the town. Upon reaching Meta, where houses dotted the streets, I paid him and warned him of the consequences of his actions. As we arrived at the hotel, he seemed to recover and even joked about the situation. Meanwhile, Fred and Hugh were preparing supper at their campsite near a remote New Zealand lake. Hugh expressed concern about the Maori wizard priest, Horoeka, who had a reputation for cruelty and fanaticism. The atmosphere turned tense when Dick, the younger brother, went missing, and the Maoris in the area were uncooperative in helping to locate him.

Before the two young men angrily walked away from the village, Hugh, who knew some Maori, cautioned the locals that the law would punish them severely if any harm came to his brother. The natives only responded with disrespectful laughter. Hugh and Fred searched the bush desperately for two hours, calling out in hopes of hearing Dick. As night fell, they realized it was futile. Back at camp, Hugh couldn't eat, consumed by worry for his brother's safety. He decided to return to the village under the moonlight.

Hugh felt his heart race as he heard a faint whistle coming from the third hut on his left. Without hesitation, he hurried over and gently knocked on the door, knowing time was of the essence. Inside, he found his brother Dick tied up. With a swift cut of his pocket knife, Hugh freed Dick, who fell into his arms in tears. Just as they thought they were safe, the council inside the hut broke up, and Horoeka, their enemy, spotted them escaping. They ran through a hole in the palisade and into the bush, narrowly escaping the pursuing Maoris. Eventually, they reached the lake and were rescued by a boat.

"Around 8 p.m., darkness enveloped the area, and the sound of an animal munching could be heard below. I aimed and shot twice at a dark shape, but it turned out to be a bush, not the panther I thought I was targeting. Unfazed, the hungry animal continued its meal, either ignoring the shots or mistaking them for thunder. As the moon rose, a third shot hit the panther, causing it to retreat wounded. Amid a thunderstorm, we stayed dry under our rugs and rested, thinking our task was completed. At sunrise, the native guide and I descended to inspect the scene. Suddenly, a loud roar echoed nearby, prompting the guide to shout ""Tiger! Tiger!"" and flee. We followed the blood trail cautiously until we discovered a fierce confrontation between the wounded panther and a tiger. The panther climbed a tall tree to escape, but my shot missed. The panther eventually fell, and as we continued tracking, the panther surprised me by leaping out and attacking, resulting in a dramatic struggle."|"['1.

One day, while out hunting near the village of Brookfield, I encountered a trail of blood and mysterious footprints in the snow. This discovery piqued my curiosity, especially given the recent attacks on local farms. Determined to solve the mystery and possibly claim the reward offered for capturing the culprit, I followed the trail into the woods. As I ventured deeper, the woods grew denser, and the shadows lengthened, creating an eerie atmosphere. The hunt for the elusive predator led me into uncharted territory, where danger lurked at every turn. Despite the risks, I pressed on, driven by a mix of fear and excitement.

In the woods, I noticed the large footprints of an unknown animal. The offer of a reward for its capture intrigued me. Uncertain of the danger, I decided to seek John Vidler's help. We set out cautiously, following the faint trail. Suddenly, a massive panther emerged, ready to attack. Startled, the mare bolted, but I held on to Vidler, saving us from harm. Without a weapon, we retreated. Gathering a group of skilled hunters, we returned to the woods. Orson Clark led us, and tension filled the air. A gunshot rang out, followed by a victorious shout from Orson's son, who had bravely taken down the panther.|"[""1.

In the Western cattle-ranche, the man from the West is reserved, making it hard to know if he likes you. As a newcomer, avoid bragging about Europe or your adventures. By observing quietly and being willing to get your hands dirty, you can thrive on the ranch. Nearby was another ranch owned by an old settler with his wife and daughter, Edna. The cowboys respected and cared for her, especially Tom, who seemed more than fatherly. Life on the ranch lacked some comforts but was incredibly enjoyable. Riding over hills and herding cattle was thrilling. Learning to use the lasso was a significant part of ranch life. While it seemed easy, mastering it took time and practice. Attempting a mounted throw was a humbling experience, showing that skills on the ground didn't always translate to success on horseback.|"['1.

One evening, while at the ranch, we heard Bain returning with news of wild cattle causing trouble in the cornfields. A plan was quickly formed to capture the beasts for the rodeo. The next night, under the dark sky, we set out on a midnight raid. Lying awake in anticipation, I realized the risks involved in lassoing wild cattle. It requires skill and expertise to avoid trouble. The thrill of the upcoming raid filled me with excitement, knowing that success would depend on our ability to rope the beasts effectively.

"The next day, we went to the old settler's ranch known as ""Edna's house"" up the valley. We sought help from some of our neighbor's men as we prepared for our midnight adventure. Edna, a fearless and skilled horsewoman, wanted to join us. Tom agreed to look after her, so she was allowed to come along. As the clock struck midnight, we saddled our horses and headed towards the cornfield. I was eager to see how they would capture the wild cattle but was too inexperienced to play a significant role.

In the quiet of the night, under the half-moon's gentle glow, a daring chase unfolded. Two wild cattle broke free, racing across the land with unmatched speed. Despite efforts to follow, the cattle vanished into the hills. Knowing the danger, the rider wisely let them go, avoiding a perilous fate. Returning to the oak-trees, the night remained serene, untouched by the earlier commotion. Suddenly, the peaceful silence shattered as the thundering hoofs of a galloping horse echoed through the rocky river-bed.

It was raining heavily. The works appeared even more dreary under the gray sky. Puddles turned into lakes, machinery shone like it was freshly oiled. A fast-flowing light-brown river raced by. The wind echoed, mingling with the sounds of the gang working on Section D. Garstin, feeling cold without his coat, was not curious about his surroundings. Trevannion walked silently, plotting revenge against Garstin. They reached Section D's edge, overlooking a massive pit with steep walls. Solid piles supported the earth against the river. Trevannion noticed the need for pumps soon due to excess work. Despite the slippery beams, Trevannion stepped onto one, but Garstin hesitated, showing fear.

However, despite his intelligence, it is believed he wouldn't excel as a practical engineer due to his lack of nerve in emergencies.

Carefully navigating through debris, Garstin and Trevannion headed towards Section D. Halfway there, Garstin paused, hearing what seemed like blows. Trevannion, suspicious, swung his lantern for more light. Suddenly, another sound made him stop. As Garstin struggled in the dark, Trevannion reached Section D to find water seeping in due to a buckling pile. He shouted to Garstin, who was above him. Trevannion, disoriented, realized he was on a beam with his legs in water. With a broken arm, he felt his legs were numb.

He gazed up wearily in the dim light. Only glimpses of the sky peeked through the dark beams. The only sound was the water dripping and splashing. Fear gripped him momentarily, but as fatigue set in, he calmed down. Memories flooded back - he was pushed into the section. He remembered a disgruntled laborer seeking revenge. Garstin would have gone for help, but why the silence now? Anxiously waiting, he strained to hear any sign of rescue. After what felt like an eternity, a flicker on the water revealed Garstin with a lantern and rope.

I filled my pocket with paper from a big pile on the table and confidently left the room, acting as if hunting escaped lions was a daily routine for me. An elevated train quickly took me to East 19th Street, a long stretch with numerous stables. After some searching, near Irving Place, I caught wind of the lion's location. A thunderous roar erupted, causing everyone to flee as news spread of a savage circus lion on the loose. Determined to get the scoop for the _Evening Smile_, I approached a group near the stable doors. Men armed with pistols and crowbars stood ready, likely circus workers. I joined them, explaining my purpose as a reporter. The men confirmed the presence of the lion, known as Old Yellow Hair, and expressed doubts about safely removing it. Other reporters soon arrived, eager to cover the sensational story. We learned of an empty loft above the stable, and with a ladder, we began climbing up to investigate further.|"[""Question 1: What was the main purpose of the protagonist's visit to East 19th Street?\nA) To catch a train\nB) To search for a lion\nC) To meet circus workers\nD) To buy a newspaper\nE) To visit a stable"", ""Question 2: What caused people to flee near Irving Place?\nA) A thunderstorm\nB) A circus performance\nC) A lion's roar\nD) A gunfight\nE) A parade"", 'Question 3: Why did the protagonist join the group near the stable doors?\nA) To buy a ticket\nB) To escape the lion\nC) To get the scoop for a newspaper\nD) To watch a circus show\nE) To rest for a while', 'Question 4: What were the men near the stable doors armed with?\nA) Swords and shields\nB) Cameras and notebooks\nC) Pistols and crowbars\nD) Whips and chains\nE) Nets and traps', ""Question 5: What did the reporters learn about an empty loft above the stable?\nA) It was a secret entrance\nB) It was filled with hay\nC) It was a lion's den\nD) It had a hidden passage\nE) It was available for rent"", 'Question 6: Why did the protagonist climb up to investigate further?\nA) To escape the circus workers\nB) To find a better vantage point\nC) To take photographs\nD) To hide from the lion\nE) To get a closer look at the lion']"|"['B) To search for a lion', ""C) A lion's roar"", 'C) To get the scoop for a newspaper', 'C) Pistols and crowbars', ""C) It was a lion's den"", 'B) To find a better vantage point']"
Before ascending, I stationed a messenger-boy on the street below to deliver my article to the _Evening Smile_ once I finished composing it. Writing for an evening paper in New York often requires working in challenging and unexpected locations. The primary rules are to gather the news quickly and worry about accuracy later. In a dark loft that smelled of hay, we suddenly heard a lion's roar beneath us, causing all the reporters to scramble up into the rafters in a panic. The trap-door in the floor revealed a scene below with figures and a lion sprawled across a dead horse. The reporters bravely continued writing and passing their articles down to the waiting messenger-boys, cheered on by spectators below.

Excitement filled the air as a monstrous lion roared, causing chaos among the men holding a ladder for Samson to ascend. The ladder slipped, sending Samson crashing down, but he managed to grab hold of a ledge. Reporters helped him up, and he bravely descended into the lion's den. A commotion ensued below as the lion roared, guns fired, and the strong man fought back with a crowbar. The crowd outside waited anxiously, expecting a ferocious battle to unfold.

In a short time, the fighters were forced out of the building without causing any harm. Interestingly, they were actually close friends pretending to fight as part of a plan. The next day, Doctor Mullen, a geologist, along with his son Mark and assistant Tom Ellison, visited the Museum. They discovered that some valuable stones had been stolen during a commotion the previous day. The missing stones were pieces of an ancient slab with inscriptions. The Doctor suspected the theft might be related to the stones' deciphering. Later, while searching in the Salt Range mountains, they encountered a suspicious boy with a hidden piece of the stolen slab. The day ended with discussions about the mysterious theft and the potential dangers surrounding the missing stone fragments.|"['1.

Harry Burton was a smart officer in the Indian police, known as Koj Burton Sahib to the Salt Range locals for his tracking skills. He was asked by the Doctor to occupy Mark's tent for a while. As he pondered about the broken slab and Mark's disappearance, he was alert to the sound of approaching footsteps. Tom informed Burton about Mark's absence and shared his experiences. Burton instructed the villagers to search for Mark, suspecting an accident. He later embarked on a secret mission. Meanwhile, a Fakir ventured into a cave where Mark thought a porcupine had disappeared. The Fakir discovered something significant after exploring the cave.

The Fakir cautiously made his way through the dark passage, stopping frequently to listen and keeping an eye out for side galleries. After passing three narrow side galleries, he suddenly extinguished his lamp upon hearing voices and seeing a distant light. Mark, held captive by the group, warned them that his father would offer stones in exchange for his release. The group, determined to find missing parts of a broken slab, vowed to keep Mark prisoner until their goal was achieved. The Fakir, eavesdropping on their conversation, overheard their plans to guard a secret within the Cave of Hydas. As the group discussed their next move, the Fakir prepared to intervene, armed with his revolver. He observed their departure and decided to act swiftly. Stealthily, he descended a rope ladder to confront Tom Ellison and a native in a struggle.

Many hours were spent by the Englishmen trying to uncover the hidden Temple of Hydas, but its mystery eluded all their attempts. They also failed to find any remnants of the shattered slab that could have assisted them in their quest. Their search for Appoyas, who vanished while his cry for revenge echoed through the Cave of Hydas, was equally fruitless. To the seasoned traveler, Earth's boundaries seem confined, yet for most, our planet is filled with unexplored territories. Nestled in the East, where the Indian Ocean meets the China Sea, lies the Malay Peninsula, one of the least explored regions despite its significance as a gateway to valuable island territories.

We eluded the Mongols upon entering the mountains, crossing lush forests and dense jungles. The Sakis might have spotted us, but we were preoccupied with avoiding reptiles and wild animals. Phil, our young and enthusiastic ethnographist, anticipated encountering unique human specimens. Stewart, recounting a close call in Sumatra, was interrupted to spare us the harrowing details. As we trekked along the river, flanked by a thick forest of palms, ebony, and bamboo, we planned to blaze a trail through the thicket to reach the towering mountains.

As we approached the dark mountains, the river's path narrowed into a deep gorge where the rushing waters resembled a massive mill-race flood. To avoid the danger of falling into the abyss, we sought refuge in the forest. Despite the high altitude, the air remained damp and oppressive, with occasional foul odors that made us feel faint. We discovered that these noxious vapors emanated from large cactus-like plants in the area. One of these plants, with wide leaves and a bulbous flower, emitted toxic gases. When one of us touched the plant, it bit back, revealing itself as a carnivorous species. After a close encounter with the plant, we encountered a strange creature in the trees, which startled us with its human-catlike eyes. As we continued, we were attacked by a group of wild beings hurling sharp darts, prompting us to defend ourselves cautiously.|['1.

On a bright September day, I anchored my yacht, the _Thelma_, in a serene East-coast estuary, relishing my escape from the City's hustle. Alone, I spent the day fishing lazily under the sun's warmth, with no one in sight but a private wherry nearby. As the afternoon waned, a sudden chill heralded the arrival of a thick sea-fog, prompting me to hastily row back to the _Thelma_ before it engulfed the estuary. Grateful for the flood tide aiding my swift return, I barely made it back as the mist encroached. With the hills vanishing from view, I secured the yacht just in time, ready to retreat to my cabin for a cozy tea. The fog veiled the surroundings, cloaking the village and the wherry in a ghostly shroud.|"['1.

The lantern, hanging above, cast a gentle glow, the kettle hummed on the stove, and the freshly caught fish tasted heavenly. I take pride in my cooking skills during these moments. The bustling city of London and the worries of daily life felt distant, like they belonged to another world. It must have been around 10 p.m., with no moon in sight and a fog thicker than I had ever experienced. Initially, I could barely see anything beyond the cabin's light, just the mizzen-mast behind and the lower part of the main-mast ahead; everything else was hidden in the dense mist. The eerie silence was broken only by the occasional distant hoot of a steamer's horn, likely a coal ship cautiously navigating through the fog. As I settled in for the night, a scream pierced the stillness, distant and muffled, sending shivers down my spine. Unsure of its origin, I listened intently but heard nothing more. Eventually, I convinced myself it was a mere figment of my imagination and drifted off to sleep. Later, in the dead of night, a sudden knocking jolted me awake, followed by a chilling realization that the knocking came from outside the boat. Startled and disoriented, I mustered the courage to investigate, only to discover a young, unconscious girl in a drifting boat, her delicate features marred by a bruise on her temple. Overwhelmed by a mix of emotions, I brought her aboard,|"['1.

It was quite a challenge to quickly figure out how to help the mysterious visitor who appeared on my yacht. I managed to carefully bring her from the unsteady boat to the cabin, where I laid her down comfortably. Though she was alive, I struggled to determine the best way to help her due to her unconscious state. As she gradually regained consciousness, I realized her insensibility might have been caused by a blow to her head. After some time, she started to show signs of waking up, but it was only a transition to another state of unconsciousness. Despite my ignorance about her identity and the events leading to her arrival, I decided to wait for her to wake up and explain before taking any action. In the meantime, I made her comfortable and waited for daylight.|"[""1.

"I heard no cries, no search sounds at night or since dawn, which seemed odd. If the young man drowned, it would explain the lack of search. Those on the boat might think visitors reached shore, while those ashore might believe visitors stayed on board due to fog, leading to no search or alarm. ""It was owned by a villager,"" she said. ""We borrowed it as the man who usually rows for the Smalls was away, saving Mr. Small the late-night row ashore."" They wouldn't be missed until the boat owner noticed its absence. I realized I might have to break the news of the young man's loss. I reassured my companion and rowed to the village to report her safety and send for her family. The fog was clearing, hinting at a lovely day. I feared the worst as I approached the village, but the innkeeper's news of the missing Miss Burfield was met with relief when I shared she was safe on my yacht.

John, with a lazy drawl, remarked that being late wasn't worth fussing over. He believed in taking things easy, quoting his Irish friend's advice to be as easy as possible. The morning turned gloomy as a thick fog suddenly surrounded them, shrouding the ship in a white wall. The passengers, previously lively, fell into hushed conversations or silence. Moisture collected on surfaces as the fog settled in, making it hard to see or hear. This unexpected change in weather contrasted the bright days they had spent exploring various places like St. Mary's and the Scilly Isles. Despite the fog, John proudly defended his silk top hat's durability and comfort. As the ship slowed, they debated heading to the bridge for a clearer view.|['1.

We arrived on the upper deck, a place filled with figures in cloaks and capes, damp and quiet. The bridge marked the front part of the upper deck, where the helmsman steered the ship, glancing between the compass and the bow. The captain paced between the paddle-boxes, scanning the foggy sky ahead. Behind the funnel, passengers with saloon tickets could roam freely, but no one was allowed on the bridge without the captain's permission. Our friend John, claiming a distant relation to the captain, engaged in a lively chat with him. The captain, though puzzled by the supposed connection, welcomed us warmly. As the ship sailed through the mist, the captain's attention was drawn to a distant sound, prompting him to signal the engines to increase speed. The passengers, hushed by the eerie atmosphere, heard the bell toll, signaling our approach to land.|"['1. What is the main setting of the text?\nA. A bustling marketplace\nB. A sunny beach\nC.

A buzz of conversation filled the air among the passengers, sparking laughter among the younger ones. Suddenly, the captain, after a quick look at the compass, called for silence. As the noise faded, the sound of waves crashing grew louder. The ship was heading towards the shore. Despite the chaos that ensued when the ship grounded, the captain assured everyone of their safety. Passengers were asked to move to the back of the ship to help lift the bow from the sand. Despite the commotion, some faces showed distress. The captain discovered they were at Porth Curnow, not Penzance as planned, due to a navigation error. John, calm amidst the chaos, realized they were about eight miles from Penzance.|"[""1.

The ship faced an unexpected problem with the compass after grounding, veering four points westward. This peculiar incident caught the attention of scientific minds. The captain's cousin, John, offered help unloading the cargo. The captain, inspired by John's idea of using the telegraph station, signaled for assistance. Passengers gathered at the bow, ready to disembark with their belongings. Villagers and farm workers joined in, offering aid and transportation to Penzance.

John, a bit of a fop, revealed a peculiar rigidity in his coat collar and breast area, likely caused by a hidden support. After leaving the ship, negotiations for our luggage and mail were made.

I encountered a moment of peril when facing a lion and lioness in the wild. Misinterpreting the local language, I believed the guide advised me to stand my ground, but he actually meant for me to flee. Following his unheeded guidance, I chose to confront the fierce animals. Surprisingly, my abrupt halt caused the creatures to pause, growling with visible anger. As we stood at an impasse, they hesitated to approach the unfamiliar sight of me. Minutes felt like hours as we locked eyes. Eventually, I resorted to a bold tactic, startling them with loud noises and erratic movements, prompting the startled lions to vanish into the bushes.

Recognizing it as their midday meal spot, the boys eagerly scrambled off to relieve their stiff limbs. Maharaj carefully placed Piroo's body on the ground and stood guard.

Maharaj, unusually quiet, seemed remorseful for the accident. As dawn approached, Maharaj signaled it was time to leave, and they continued their journey.
