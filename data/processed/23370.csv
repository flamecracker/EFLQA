Mrs. Blyth expressed concern about William's temper and the potential consequences for Nell. Bessy, however, insisted on her admiration for Bill Bowls, even suggesting she would marry him herself.

Leaving Alexandria, Nelson sailed in search of the French, pressing on day and night to find them. Despite returning to Sicily for supplies, he faced criticism in England for his unsuccessful mission. Nelson defended his actions, stating that waiting for certain information would have been futile.
