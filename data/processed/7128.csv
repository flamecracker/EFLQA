"From the farthest West to the farthest East, the tales we hear share a common thread. While lands differ in soil and character, fairy tales remain constant in plot and essence. Many of the stories known in the West have roots in the East, particularly in India. Evidence suggests that Crusaders, missionaries, and traders brought these tales from India to Europe. The Jatakas, a collection of Indian folk tales, are among the earliest in the world and have influenced European stories for centuries. Miss Frere's ""Old Deccan Days"" marked the beginning of modern Indian folk tale collections. These stories, rich in history and tradition, continue to captivate children globally. The tales selected shed light on the origins of fables and folk tales, providing a glimpse into the shared heritage of storytelling across cultures."|['1.

All the people in her father's country then went about their work and finished it.

At midnight, when everybody had gone to bed, the princess came down from her roof, and went to her room; and when she was in bed and asleep, the Raja's son got up softly, and sat on his bed.

Once upon a time, there was a Raja who adored his daughters dearly. Since their mother's passing, they took on the responsibility of cooking his meals to ensure his safety from any harm. However, when the Raja discovered mud in his food, he thought his daughters were careless. Despite this, he didn't scold them. One day, the Prudhan's widow asked for firewood, and Balna, one of the daughters, was upset. The Raja, angry at the widow's actions, summoned her. Surprisingly, the widow explained that she did it to meet the Raja. Impressed, the Raja married her. Unfortunately, the new Ranee mistreated the seven Princesses. They found solace by a pomelo tree on their mother's grave. The Ranee's daughter discovered this and told her mother. The Ranee, wanting the tree, pretended to have a headache that only the tree's water could cure. She tricked the Raja into uprooting the tree, but the daughters' kindness prevailed.|"['1.

Once upon a time, near the Ranee's tomb, there was a small tank. The Princesses discovered that the tank was filled with a creamy substance that turned into a delicious white cake. Excited, they ate the cake daily. However, their cruel stepmother's daughter found out and told her mother. In fear of losing her stepdaughters' love, the stepmother pretended to fall severely ill. She demanded a cure: the blood of the seven Princesses on her hands would save her. Reluctant to harm his daughters, the Raja took them to the jungle but left them there to protect them from their stepmother. The Princesses were found by seven Princes who married them.

Later, she transformed into a bamboo by the tank where she drowned. A passerby, a Jogi, thought the bamboo would make a great fiddle. The bamboo instructed him on where to cut, creating a magical fiddle with a superior tone. The Jogi's music enchanted many, including the Bonga girl's brothers. They offered to buy the fiddle, but the Jogi refused. Eventually, the fiddle was stolen while the Jogi was intoxicated. The chief's son played the fiddle beautifully, not knowing the Bonga girl was the one preparing his meals. When he discovered her, they fell in love, and everyone rejoiced.|"['1.

Once upon a time, in a distant land, there was a girl named Bonga who sought revenge. She served water and rice to some visitors, only to scold them for the mistreatment she endured from their wives. The crane and the crab also had a quarrel. The crane deceived the fish, while the crab outsmarted the crane, leading to a standoff. The crab bravely challenged the crane, and in the end, it was the clever crab who emerged victorious. In another part of the kingdom, Prince Majnun and his friend Husain Mahamat enjoyed playing in the king's garden, learning from a wise teacher.

Once upon a time, a curious crow and a troubled fish named Rohu crossed paths. The crow warned Rohu of a Rakshas inside him before flying away.

Laili and Prince Majnun prayed to Khuda to become young again so they could get married. Khuda instructed the prince to touch Laili's clothes to ignite them, turning them both young. They celebrated their marriage and visited Laili's parents, who had become blind from crying for her. Laili prayed for their sight to be restored, and it was. They rejoiced and had another wedding.

Laili hid in the garden, watching as Prince Majnun and Husain Mahamat strolled through the lush greenery. King Dantal, now elderly, and Husain Mahamat, looking older than his years, joined the prince. The trio gathered fruits, reminiscing about their childhood. Suddenly, Majnun, startled by Laili's presence, mistook her for a demon and fled with Husain in fear. Despite King Dantal's disbelief, Majnun refused to return to the garden. The following day, Laili transformed into a dog, endearing herself to Majnun. However, when she reverted to her human form at night, Majnun, convinced she was a demon, recoiled in terror.

The king regretted believing the goldsmith, wept for his mistake, and vowed to rule justly. The serpent-king and tiger-king pledged to uphold justice. The goldsmith fled but was caught and forgiven by the generous Gangazara. Gangazara postponed marrying the princess to visit his brother.

The brothers conversed about their adventures. Both traveled to Ujjaini, where Gangazara wed the princess and became the ruler. He reigned long, benefiting his brother. A Brahman named Harisarman lived in a village. Poor and with many children, he wandered begging until employed by Sthuladatta. Harisarman's family served Sthuladatta, but at a feast, he was ignored.

Young Rasalu lived secluded for eleven years, playing with his colt and talking to his parrot. In his twelfth year, yearning for change, he rode out on his horse Bhaunr. At a river, he washed himself and his clothes. Riding to his father's city, he rested by a well. Playfully, he broke the women's earthen pitchers, leading them to complain to the King. Recognizing Rasalu, the King feared looking at him before twelve years passed, so he replaced the pitchers. When Rasalu pierced the new pitchers, the King remained cautious.

The prince and the vizier's son devised a clever plan to rescue Princess Gulizar. Disguised as a fakir and his disciple, they tricked the king and saved the princess from a ghoul's curse. The fakir explained to the king how the ghoul had stolen the princess's necklace and left burn marks on her back. The king, fearing divine retribution, agreed to the fakir's demands. Under the cover of night, the prince and his companion revealed their true identities, freed Gulizar, and treated her wounds.

Once upon a time, a prince, his bride Gulizar, and the vizier's son embarked on a journey back to their kingdom. Along the way, they demolished a robbers' tower, defeated the thieves, and claimed their amassed treasure. Upon returning home, the king welcomed his son and his splendid entourage. In another tale, the Sun, Moon, and Wind dined with their relatives Thunder and Lightning. While Sun and Wind selfishly enjoyed the feast without saving any for their mother, the gentle Moon saved portions under her nails for her. When asked what they brought back, Sun and Wind admitted to bringing nothing, but Moon shared her saved feast with their mother. The mother then blessed Moon with eternal brightness for her kindness, while Sun and Wind were cursed for their selfishness. Lastly, an old man divided his wealth among his sons, who mistreated him once they received their inheritance. A friend later advised the old man, leaving him with four bags of stones and gravel.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a Pigeon and a greedy Crow teamed up in a cunning plan. The Crow, lured by the Pigeon's promise of food, agreed to join forces. While the Pigeon pecked at cow-dung, the Crow indulged in fat worms. The clever Pigeon warned the Crow against gluttony, but the Crow's desire for more led to a disastrous end. When a feast of fish arrived, the Crow's greed got the better of him. Despite the Pigeon's advice, the Crow's loud groans gave him away. The cook caught the Crow red-handed, plucked his feathers, and coated him in a spicy mixture as punishment. The moral of the story: greed can lead to a bitter outcome.|"['1.

The literary tradition of India owes much to the moral transformation inspired by Gautama Buddha. His teachings led to a trend of weaving popular stories around him, especially due to the widespread belief in metempsychosis. The Buddhists skillfully integrated Buddha into existing folk tales and fables, presenting him as the central figure. This allowed them to incorporate a vast array of stories into their sacred texts, appealing to the storytelling nature of people. The Jatakas, tales of Buddha's past lives, were compiled with a unique framing technique, where each story of the past was linked to a moral lesson from Buddha's current life. These stories, totaling 550, are akin to Aesop's fables, suggesting a historical connection between the two traditions.|"['1.

During the Middle Ages, various collections of tales influenced by Buddhist traditions reached Europe. One such collection, the Fables of Bidpai, derived from Buddhist sources, was adapted by Brahmins during the Hindu reaction against Buddhism. It is believed that the Fables of Bidpai, known as the Panchatantra, influenced European folk tales. The tales were translated into thirty-eight languages, with twenty versions in English alone. Other collections like The Tales of Sindibad and Barlaam and Josaphat also made their way to Europe. The Gesta Romanorum, a popular collection, was derived from Oriental and Indian sources. These tales were widely used by monks and friars as exempla in sermons to captivate audiences. The influence of these tales extended to Italian Novellieri, Boccaccio's works, and even to Shakespeare's writings, showing a rich tapestry of storytelling traditions connecting Europe to India.|"['1.

"In India, the tradition of collecting and sharing stories has a long history. Some famous tales include ""Vikram and the Vampire"" and the seventy stories of a parrot called ""Suka Saptati."" These stories were compiled in the ""Katha Sarit Sagara"" by Somadeva around 1200 A.D. This vast literature was translated by Mr. Tawney, but only parts were selected due to its complex nature. The Jatakas are one of the oldest collections of such tales, and many others are over a thousand years old. Prof. Benfey argued that most folk-tale incidents originated in Indian literature. Miss Frere and others collected Indian folk-tales, and Major Temple's analysis marked a significant step in studying folk-tales scientifically.

The study of folk-tales has seen significant progress with the research conducted by M. Emanuel Cosquin in his book _Contes populaires de Lorraine_. This work, published in Paris in 1886, provides valuable insights into the various forms of tales found not only in Europe but also in the East. Cosquin's collection of eighty-four tales from Lorraine sheds light on the common elements shared by different countries in Europe and beyond. While he argues that these tales originated from the East, particularly India, the exact transmission routes remain a topic of debate. Additionally, scholars like Mr. W. A. Clouston have drawn parallels between Indian and European folk-tales, suggesting a potential shared origin. The ongoing research in this field highlights the interconnectedness of folk traditions across different cultures and regions.|"[""1. What is the main focus of M.

In this case, we may have doubts, but in other instances, like the story of the rat's tail up the nose (refer to Notes on _The Charmed Ring_), the Indian influence is unmistakable. Particularly when the tales are fantastical and have a true fairy-tale essence, the likelihood points to India due to the enduring presence of animism and metempsychosis throughout Indian history. Hindus readily believe in animals speaking and humans transforming into plants and animals. While Europeans may have once held similar beliefs, they are now considered remnants of the past. The fairy tales common in the Indo-European realm likely originated in India and then spread through cultural exchanges. The Hindu tales, with their backdrop of metempsychosis and a populace with literary skills, have overshadowed the native European tales. This is similar to how Perrault's stories have eclipsed traditional English folk tales. Europe's shared fairy tale treasury is largely indebted to India, as evidenced by the significant overlap in stories across European countries.|"['1. **Question:** According to the passage, what is a significant reason why the Indian influence on fairy tales is unmistakable?\n- A) The presence of animism and metempsychosis in Indian history\n- B) The popularity of fairy tales in India\n- C) The influence of European beliefs on Indian tales\n- D) The absence of fairy tales in European countries\n- E) The dominance of European folklore in Indian storytelling', '2. **Question:** What is one way in which Hindu tales differ from traditional European tales, as mentioned in the passage?\n- A) Hindu tales have no fantastical elements\n- B) Hindu tales do not involve animals\n- C) Hindu tales do not include metempsychosis\n- D) Hindu tales feature animals speaking and humans transforming\n- E) Hindu tales have no literary value', '3. **Question:** The passage suggests that the belief in animals speaking and humans transforming into plants and animals is more common among:\n- A) Europeans\n- B) Indians\n- C) Australians\n- D) Americans\n- E) Africans', '4. **Question:** Which of the following best describes the relationship between European and Indian fairy tales, based on the passage?\n- A) European tales have completely replaced Indian tales\n- B) Indian tales are adaptations of European stories\n- C) Indian tales have overshadowed European tales\n- D) European tales have no similarities with Indian tales\n- E) European tales are entirely independent of Indian influence', ""5. **Question:** What is the main reason cited in the passage for the indebtedness of Europe's fairy tale treasury to India?\n- A) The lack of storytelling tradition in Europe\n- B) The dominance of European folklore in India\n- C) The significant overlap in stories across European countries and India\n- D) The absence of animism and metempsychosis in Indian history\n- E) The influence of American tales on European folklore""]"|['** A) The presence of animism and metempsychosis in Indian history', '** D) Hindu tales feature animals speaking and humans transforming', '** B) Indians', '** C) Indian tales have overshadowed European tales', '** C) The significant overlap in stories across European countries and India']

"It is hard to believe that the migration of the tale did not occur from East to West.

Raja Rasalu, a figure possibly from history, thrived in the eighth or ninth century, as per Capt. Temple's research in Calcutta Review. Sirikap ka-kila near Sialkot is believed to be Rasalu's traditional dwelling by the Indus, close to Atlock. Herr Patzig argues for the Eastern roots of the tale, tracing its earliest Western appearance to the Anglo-Norman troubadour Thomas' _Lai Guirun_ in the Tristan cycle. The gambling incidents in the Rasalu legend have parallels in Celtic and other folk tales. This narrative is also found in Somadeva's _Katha Sarit Sagara_ and has Æsopic parallels. Avian, writing in the third century, translated Babrius into Latin, incorporating more Eastern elements. The Ass in the Lion's Skin tale likely originates from India, providing a motive for the masquerade. This fable is present in Jacques de Vitry's _Exempla_ and Bozon's _Contes moralisés_. Rudyard Kipling includes a similar story in _Life's Handicap_.|"[""1. What is the main focus of Capt.
