Jean and her faithful dog, True Tammas, greeted the morning with a walk to the house. Jock, still recovering from an injury, playfully barred the door. Undisturbed, Jean sat outside, singing.

"""Come on, Grandfather,"" she called, her brow stern and curls bouncing. ""You're moving like you're seventy-five with rheumatism! Come churn, it'll loosen you up.""""Nonsense!"" Jean interjected.

It was a day like any other in the Highland home near Glen Cairn, where Jock and Tam were chasing a rabbit. Little did they know that Angus, the Laird's gamekeeper, was nearby. Angus was a man of great zeal, always on the lookout for poachers. As Jock and Tam raced down the hill, a mishap occurred, and Jock accidentally sent Angus tumbling into a brook. Angus, dripping wet and furious, blamed Jock for the mishap. He dragged Jock back to the gray house where Jean, Jock's sister, stood up to Angus's bullying.

Angus released Jock's ear in shock, and Jock hurried to his sister's side. Tam growled and showed his teeth sensing trouble. Angus accused Jock of trespassing and hunting a rabbit. He threatened to involve the law. Angus then lunged at Jock, leaving mud on the floor. Jean intervened, pointing at Angus's muddy feet. Angus, feeling embarrassed, quickly left.

On a bright Sabbath morning, the Campbell family rose early to complete their chores before seven o'clock. After breakfast, Jean brought the Bible to her father, and they all sat quietly while he read a lengthy chapter about family lineage. Following the reading, a prayer ensued, so long that True Tammas fell asleep by the fire dreaming about rabbits. The kettle nearly boiled over during the extended prayer, causing a moment of panic for Jean. Once the prayer concluded, the family hurried to attend the church service in the village, leaving True Tammas behind to guard the sheep. Despite the troubles of the previous evening, the beauty of the spring morning lifted their spirits. The world seemed full of joy and promise as they made their way to the Kirk, passing by familiar faces and enjoying the sights and sounds of the season.|"['1.

Andrew Crumpet's farm lay near the Campbells', so they often walked together to talk. As they headed home, Andrew expressed concern about being forced off their land. He criticized the rich for making the poor suffer. The children overheard this and parted ways as the adults reached a bridge. At home, the family shared a simple meal after a long walk. The children found the afternoon tedious, spending it avoiding things they wanted to do. With no school due to the teacher's illness, they helped with chores. The next day, Jean washed clothes in the stream, enlisting the boys' help. A mysterious boy appeared, sparking Jock's warning about the gamekeeper.|"['1.

"""Well,"" said Sandy, ""law or no law, Angus is against it, and the Auld Laird is terrible particular. He's going to turn out all the farmers in this region and make it into a great game preserve. Nothing else. You're strange hereabouts, I doubt, or you'd ken all this yourself. Where are you from?""

""Eppie's not my aunt,"" said the boy. ""She's a friend of my mother, and my mother got her to take me in because I've been sick, and she thought I'd get strong up here, and I'm not going to have my summer spoiled by Angus Niel or any other old bogie man. Stand back now while I cast.""

He swung his rod over his head, and the fly fell with a flop in the middle of the pool. He waited a breathless instant while Jock, Sandy, and Jean watched the fly with him, and then, as nothing happened, he cast again. When several such attempts brought no result, he said, ""You're sure they 're there?""

Jean sprang to her feet and took the rod, though she had never had one like it in her hand before. She made a mighty sweep with it as she had seen the new boy do, but somehow the fly flew off in an unexpected direction and caught in a tree, while the line wound itself in a hopeless snarl around the tip.

Sandy, full of swagger, boasted about fishing, claiming it's better to catch fish yourself than play with a toy. Alan, intrigued, decided to try guddling for trout with his friends. After a successful fishing trip, they returned to Jean's house for tea. Alan, soaked from falling into the stream, borrowed old kilts to wear while his clothes dried. The boys, now in high spirits, entertained themselves by marching and singing in the kitchen. Jean, exasperated but amused, cleaned up the mess and served them tea.

The Shepherd shared a story with the children, about a water cow at Loch Leven. The cow appeared gentle and let the children play around her, even putting a wreath of daisies on her neck.

"As the Shepherd spoke, the room grew dark as twilight turned to night. Shadows played tricks in the corners, dancing with the fading fire's flickering flames. Jean felt a shiver down her spine, glancing nervously behind her. Jock's eyes widened in fear. The Shepherd reassured them, ""Good children need not fear the fairy folk."" He then suggested a bagpipe tune, prompting the children to help stir the fire and check on their clothes. Soon, the room was bright again, and the children danced a lively Highland Fling. Suddenly, a loud knock interrupted the merriment. A man appeared, delivering clothes for Alan. After changing, Alan bid farewell, promising to return the next day.

Whistling and listening for a response every few steps, they climbed over rocks and fallen trees, staying close to the stream. Suddenly, they reached a stunning waterfall gushing from giant rocks among the pine trees' topmost boughs. Alan disappeared behind the fall, beckoning Jean to follow. She found a hidden opening behind the fall and climbed a narrow dry channel. They emerged onto a ledge with a breathtaking view over the treetops to a little gray house. Between a wall of water and a rock cliff, they found a cave accessible only through a hidden stair. After tucking the basket away, they continued their search and discovered a beautiful mountain lake. As they admired the serene lake, a majestic stag appeared but was shot by a poacher, Angus Niel.

Jean was amazed, unable to trust her eyes. The two kids lay low, watching a man pull a boat from hiding among bushes, paddle silently to a dead stag, load it swiftly, then return with a string of rabbits. He rowed across the lake, unloading his game and vanishing into the woods. Jean exploded in a fierce whisper, calling him a poacher. Alan explained that the man sells the game in cities like Glasgow and Edinburgh. Suddenly, two faces appeared across the stream. Alan signaled them to meet at the waterfall. When they arrived, Jock and Sandy were already there. The four kids shared a secret plan away from the poacher's sight.|"['1.

"Jock demanded, ""What have you got to show us? I hope it's something to eat."" Regretting his decision to search for food in the forest that morning, Jock and the children were famished. Alan cautiously led them to a hidden cave under the fall. Excitedly, he revealed their secret hideout, boasting about its superiority to Robinson Crusoe's shelter. Jock believed it was where Rob Roy once hid, and Sandy was so impressed that he nearly toppled Jean in his excitement. Unpacking the basket, they found bacon, eggs, and scones, causing Jock and Sandy to cheer. Alan warned them to stay quiet to avoid detection by Angus Niel, who was armed.

"""We need twigs, dry pine-needles, and branches,"" Jock explained. ""It'll be tough to haul them up the narrow stair. A rope would help. We can hoist a basket of fuel easily."" The trio vanished down the stairs. Meanwhile, Jean fashioned a support for the frying-pan with stones. The boys returned with plenty of fuel. Soon, a fire crackled on the rock, filling the air with the aroma of sizzling bacon. Seated around the fire, Jean cooked while the boys ate. Sandy teased Alan about missing out on the fun due to measles. Jock proposed a plan to torment Angus Niel. Jean objected, not wanting to trouble her brother.

Alan chuckled, explaining the oath to obey the Chief. Suddenly, an idea struck him. Sandy, not a Campbell or McGregor, needed a blood brotherhood to join the Clan. Alan, with a knife, cut his wrist, then passed it to Jock. Sandy, squeamish, reluctantly followed suit. Mixing drops of their blood, Alan initiated Sandy into the Clan. Assigning roles, Alan proposed a symbol like Clan Alpine's in 'The Lady of the Lake.' Ordering henchmen to fetch Evergreen Pine sprays for their bonnets, Alan led with vigor. Meanwhile, Angus Niel, returning, detected the aroma of bacon. Enraged, he suspected poachers cooking meat nearby. Determined, he stealthily climbed the rocks, spotting smoke above.|"['1.

With a quiet growl, Angus Niel, the gamekeeper, set out to catch the poachers who dared to steal from the Laird's land. While he searched the rocks, Sandy and Jock gathered evergreen pine sprays. Suddenly, they spotted Angus and hid behind a boulder. The poachers dashed into a secret stairway like squirrels, joining their clan in a cave. Alan, like a lizard, peeked through leaves to watch Angus below. Unaware of being observed, Angus struggled to find the poachers, climbing a pine tree covered in pitch. Frustrated, he tried to descend but got stuck, causing a commotion. Helpless and angry, he howled in pain, echoing through the narrow passage. Angus found himself trapped, unable to move up or down, a situation that left him furious.|"[""1. What was Angus's profession?\nA) Poacher\nB) Laird\nC) Gamekeeper\nD) Lizard\nE) Squirrel"", '2.

The children were hiding and heard strange sounds. They realized it wasn't an animal because animals don't swear. Alan chuckled, saying Angus was stuck in a secret stairway due to his size. Alan peeked down and saw Angus's head and gun. The Chief acted quickly, grabbed a pan, filled it with water, and poured it on Angus. Confused, Angus thought he was under a spell by unseen creatures. Alan poured more water on him, and Angus, terrified, freed himself, leaving in a hurry. Alan scared him off with a banshee-like cry. They planned to return the next day to improve their hideout. The next morning, the Clan gathered with supplies from Eppie to head to the woods.|"['1.

Jean quickly gathered a handful of cooking tools, and shortly after, the group set off, carrying food supplies and proudly sporting a sprig of pine on their hats, the symbol of their clan. The sky looked gloomy, and the forest appeared dark as they headed towards the waterfall. Upon reaching the falls, Alan instructed Sandy and Jock to gather wood while Jean watched over the basket at the base of the rock. Alan then ascended the hidden staircase with a rope, lowered it down, and Jean secured it to the basket handles. After pulling the basket up, emptying it, and sending it back for the wood collected by Sandy and Jock, they all worked swiftly. As darkness fell and thunder rumbled, they managed to gather six basketfuls before the rain poured down. Seeking shelter in a cave, they lit a fire with the wood collected, and Jean cooked a meal over the flames. Amidst the feast, they listened intently as Alan read a story, captivated by the tale until the sun's rays illuminated the cave, signaling the end of the day. Packing up their food and extinguishing the fire, they cautiously descended to the ground, only to discover Tam, the dog, causing a commotion near the little gray house. Determined to protect Tam, the children hid among the trees, watching the unfolding events.|['1.

Just as a rapid movement caught their attention from the garden wall, Tam dashed after it, barking loudly. Jock, filled with excitement, cheered Tam on while Alan clung to his coat. Unseen by Jock, Angus took aim and fired a shot as Tam grabbed the rabbit. In pain, Tam dropped the rabbit and limped back towards the house. Angus swiftly appeared, snatched the rabbit, and vanished into the woods. The children quickly tended to Tam's wound, cleaning and bandaging it. Later, Alan and Sandy set off towards the village. Alan instructed Sandy to spy on Angus Niel's movements the next day. Sandy observed Angus heading in a different direction than before. Reporting back to Alan, they hatched a plan to deal with Angus, ensuring he got what he deserved.|"['1.

Jean, Alan, and the Rob Roy Clan embarked on a mission to uncover Angus's secret game hiding place. With stealth, they rowed Angus's boat to the opposite shore, under the shelter of a dead pine. Following a trail into the woods, they kept the sun behind them to avoid getting lost. As they cautiously explored, Alan spotted a shelter hidden by rocks and pine boughs, indicating they were close to their target. Alan and Jock crept closer while Jean and Sandy watched from a distance. The shelter revealed signs of Angus's activities, with deer hides and a curing hide.

Whispering to Jock, Alan pointed out the stag's skin. Determined, Alan stealthily entered the camp, leaving a message in blue chalk under a rock. Quickly rejoining Jock, they hurried to Jean's hideout. Meanwhile, Jean, feeling anxious and alone, heard a rabbit scurry away and the leaves rustling above her. Spotting a figure in the distance, she let out a loud call. Startled, the boys hid as a dog and a man approached. Jean, realizing the danger, rushed back to Sandy, urging him to prepare the boat. The man, discovering the chalk marks, realized he was discovered and chased after the boys.

Jean anxiously called out for the boys, worried about their safety. The boys, Jock and Alan, were hiding nearby, waiting for a safe moment to return. When they heard a signal call, Sandy rowed to their rescue, and they quickly boarded the boat and hid from a man searching for them. With clever tactics, they outwitted the man and safely returned to their side of the lake. They devised a plan to transport the boat to their secret cave, using teamwork and ingenuity. The Clan celebrated their successful mission, enjoying a meal in the boat before heading home.

The children worked quickly as time was running out. Within an hour, the boat was floating in the fishing-pool, tied securely to a pine tree. They packed pots and pans in a basket, lowered it over a rock by a rope, and Alan drew a pine sprig on the cave wall with the initials R. R. C.
