A group of French soldiers executed a clever plan to outsmart the Prussian forces. While a few soldiers stayed behind to protect the fort, the rest surrounded the village and captured the sentries without a fight. The surprised prisoners were taken back to the fort. When the French fired shots into the air, the Prussians guarding the houses rushed out and started shooting, but their vision was impaired by the transition from light to darkness.

Credit was given to little Jeanne for giving the lancers to the French soldiers. If she hadn't done this, the French might have faced the Prussians openly, risking many lives.
