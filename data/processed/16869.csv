In the heart of the Ohio forests near the Miami river, a bustling Indian town with lodges resembling a vast apiary bustled with activity. The scene unfolded on a radiant spring morning, with dew glistening on the grass, birds chirping joyously, and the sky painted in a pure blue hue. Amidst this vibrant setting, Hans Vanderbum stood out as the lone figure engulfed in unhappiness. The Indian lodges, though simple in design, exuded comfort and practicality, each constructed with skins and bark in a cone shape. A thin wisp of smoke spiraled from the top of the lodge where a Shawnee squaw tended to the morning meal, while Hans Vanderbum, a lazy Dutchman, lay in a corner trying to steal a few more moments of sleep. His stepsons, two lively little boys with mischief in their eyes, completed this unique family portrait.|['1.

Hans Vanderbum lay flat on his back in the warm wigwam, his belly rising and falling like the sea. His throat made a rattling sound, but the boys, Quanonshet and Madokawandock, were inside as their mother Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock had forbidden them from going out. Hans, their father, was angry, but the boys tried to act sorry. When Hans woke up, he scolded them in Shawnee, shaking his head furiously. He didn't contribute much to the family, unlike the typical Indian husband. Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock did most of the work, while Hans fished and slept a lot. He admired his wife and tried to flatter her while she prepared breakfast. Hans had forgotten his first love after being adopted into the Shawnee tribe.|"['1.

The wife gave a spiteful nod, and Hans Vanderbum shambled up beside her. The food, with meat and simple vegetables, was spread on a table without legs. Quanonshet and Madokawandock quickly satisfied their hunger. The boys eagerly tumbled outside, followed by Hans. Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock attended to household chores. The boys played until Hans called them. He tried to teach them the German alphabet but they didn't know. Hans asked for his pipe, but the boys laughed and blamed each other. Unable to determine the culprit, Hans punished both. He lamented the boys' mischief to his wife, who consoled him. Hans worried about their future behavior.|"['1.

Her husband realized his mistake and attributed the fishing skills to his wife, Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock. Hans, complying with his wife's wishes, gathered his fishing gear and headed to the river. As he observed the Shawnee Indians going about their daily activities, he sensed an unusual tension among them. Despite hearing strange sounds and glimpsing Indians watching him, Hans proceeded to fish. He carefully baited his hook, cast the line, and settled on a tree trunk over the water. Unaware of the tree's instability, he sat down, focused on his fishing. When the branch broke, Hans fell into the river but managed to swim to safety.|"['1.

Glancing around, he noticed a hook snagged in his clothes, causing the fishing line to reach the shore. Unfazed by his unexpected swim, he continued fishing. Before climbing back onto the tree, he checked the roots to ensure his mischievous sons hadn't caused more trouble. Satisfied, he resumed fishing, unaware of the amused Shawnees. As the fish bit eagerly, he caught enough for a hearty meal. Contemplating heading home, he was interrupted by floating bark pieces snagging his line. Puzzled by their origin, he suspected the Shawnees but found no evidence. Observing the peculiar bark canoes floating downstream, he realized they were deliberately sent to catch his attention. Spotting a swaying limb and a hand near the tree, he understood someone was covertly watching him. Hans Vanderbum remained vigilant, careful not to alert the Shawnees to the mysterious observer.|['1.

Hans Vanderbum cautiously retreated to the shore, making sure not to raise suspicions among the Shawnees. After hiding his fish and line, he took a long detour up the river to evade the Shawnees. Suddenly, a low whistle caught his attention. Turning around, he saw a Huron friend approaching. They exchanged glances and the Huron signaled for Hans to follow him. They moved deeper into the woods to ensure privacy. The Huron revealed that the Shawnee village held a captive friend, seeking Hans' help. Grateful for the Huron's trust, Hans hurried back to the village, eager to assist. On his return, his wife demanded an explanation for his absence, reminding him to focus on his duties. Hans handed over the fish for cooking and strolled through the village, pretending nonchalance while planning his next move to aid the captive.|"['1.

"""What do you have there?"" he asked, pushing through the crowd with anger in his voice. The people he spoke to remained silent, waiting for him to see for himself. Inside, he saw a young girl, about fifteen or sixteen years old, sitting next to a Native American woman. They had stopped trying to communicate due to the language barrier and sat quietly. Hans Vanderbum felt pity as he looked at her. She wore a simple dress, her hair falling around her shoulders. Her demeanor was meek and resigned, evoking sympathy from those around her. Hans Vanderbum's heavy breathing caught the girl's attention. She stood and approached him, sharing her story of being captured by Shawnee warriors.

Hans Vanderbum realized his conversation upset the prisoner and sought to make amends. He assured her Oonomoo, a messenger, might help her. The girl asked to relay a message to Lieutenant Canfield. After talking to the Indians, Hans returned home. He pretended to eat lunch to avoid suspicion but was anxious to meet Oonomoo. Later, he met Oonomoo at their usual spot, where they discussed Miss Prescott. Oonomoo left quietly, and Hans returned to the village. The warm day seemed unusual, with Shawnees idling by the Miami River. Back home, Hans was surprised to learn Miss Prescott would stay with them but under strict guard.

During the time following Anthony Wayne's victory over the Indian tribes, peace settled along the frontier. However, true peace only came with the Indians' removal beyond the Mississippi. Captain Prescott, trusting the treaty of Greenville, built a mansion on the frontier. He left for the army, leaving his wife and daughters with servants. His absence extended, and during a visit with Lieutenant Canfield, a romance blossomed between the young officer and Mary Prescott. Despite the feelings between them, Mary's mother cautioned against hasty decisions due to her daughter's youth. Lieutenant Canfield respected this, promising not to seek Mary's hand until her parents approved.

The lovers, Lieutenant Canfield and Mary Prescott, found a way to send messages through the faithful Huron, Oonomoo. He traveled between Captain Prescott's mansion and his post, delivering letters back and forth. Oonomoo was highly regarded by the whites for his loyalty and skills as a runner, scout, and hunter. He was known for his daring exploits and had a wife and child hidden in the forest. When Shawnees attacked, Mary was taken captive. Oonomoo, sensing danger, cautiously approached his canoe by the river, realizing an enemy was lying in wait. Despite no obvious signs of disturbance, he knew he was being watched.

Oonomoo had hidden his canoe carefully by the riverbank and left his paddle in it with the blade slightly moved. This small change alerted the Huron to potential danger. He cautiously observed and decided his enemies were not between him and the river. He chose to face them rather than swim away. Moving upstream, he planned to retrieve his canoe, being mindful of any misstep that could expose him. The Shawnees discovered the canoe, suspected it was left by a foe, and waited for the owner. The canoe mysteriously moved inch by inch, alerting the Shawnees. They saw the canoe dart off, revealing Oonomoo's clever escape plan.|"['1.

"With a loud yell, the three dashed forward, while the Huron ran at the top of his speed over the slight distance that lay between him and the river. Reaching the shore, he changed the canoe from his rear to his front, and holding it like a shield above and before him. With one foot in the edge of the water, he concentrated all his strength for the effort and leaped far out in the stream--the canoe falling with a loud splash perfectly flat upon the surface. The impetus thus given caused it to shoot like an arrow for a long distance, when the Huron, inclining his body to the left, careened it so much, that his own person was concealed from any who might be upon the shore, while, by reaching his hand over into the current, he was enabled to use it as a paddle, and continue his onward motion.

Oonomoo was fully aware that the delicate structure of the canoe was no obstruction at all against a rifle-shot. Accordingly, while descending the river, he had taken precaution to ensure his safety, in case of such an occurrence as had now transpired. A large, rotten limb, hardly the length of his own body, was carried with him. At the moment of lifting the canoe from the ground, the limb was placed within it, and thus was carried back to the edge of the river.

Lieutenant Canfield spotted a glowing light from afar, resembling the moon. Unaware of its true nature, the next morning, he met Oonomoo, a Huron, who shared the Shawnee attack on Captain Prescott's house and the kidnapping of his daughter.

We went to our room, blew out the candle, said our prayers, and went to bed.

The soldier searched through the ashes and cinders in hopes of finding more family valuables but found nothing. He then took a watch and led his horse into the woods, motioning for the nervous negro to join him. Lieutenant Canfield, alarmed by the negro's fear, cautiously approached the clearing. There, he saw Shawnee Indians exploring the ruins. Lieutenant Canfield and the negro quickly retreated into the woods to observe the Indians from a safe distance. The Indians, in their war paint, scavenged through the debris, collecting any metal objects and even burnt nails. One Indian, excited about a board, suddenly leaped in pain when it burned him. Others also fell victim to the hot coals and objects in the debris. The Lieutenant and the negro watched, hidden from view, as the Indians scoured the area for items of interest.|"['1.

The Lieutenant and Cato were greatly amused by various incidents, with Cato almost unable to control his laughter. However, their mirth was abruptly halted when they noticed eight Indians tracking them. The Indians had halted at the edge of the wood, consulting among themselves. The Lieutenant realized the danger they were in. Just as they were about to move, a rifle shot rang out, causing the Shawnees to rush off in a different direction. Later that night, Oonomoo, a Huron, returned and revealed that he had diverted the Shawnees' attention away from the Lieutenant and the negro by firing his gun and leading them away.

The Huron continued his journey through the swamp, his eyes scanning the surroundings with a calm demeanor. The swamp maintained its unique character - a vast expanse of water dotted with twisted trees and hidden roots. Shallow areas contrasted with deep sections where the water seemed to vanish into the depths below. As he ventured deeper, the trees abruptly gave way to a clear lake. The Huron, filled with anxiety, carefully observed his surroundings. Satisfied, he summoned a hidden canoe, skillfully navigating the waters. A whistle echoed, and soon his son, Niniotan, appeared in another canoe. Together, they glided through the swamp with precision. They reached a concealed mound, their secret home, where Oonomoo, Fluellina, and Niniotan lived in seclusion.

In the past, Oonomoo's dwelling was a simple mound, but inside, it was filled with luxurious furs and skins, providing comfort for his wife, Fluellina. The place was adorned with gifts from Oonomoo's white friends, such as rifles, knives, and a gold watch from a lady grateful for Oonomoo's help. Fluellina, a gentle Huron woman, was educated at a missionary station and was a devout Christian. She regularly visited a missionary with her son, where they learned about faith. Oonomoo, a fierce warrior, struggled with the idea of loving his enemies but found solace in the teachings.

Fluellina and Oonomoo, a Huron warrior, shared a tender moment in the woods of their island home. Oonomoo admired Fluellina's arms and they gazed at each other in silence, their hearts full. Eventually, Oonomoo rested his head on Fluellina's lap as she ran her fingers through his hair until he fell asleep. Moved by her husband's determination and sacred vows, Fluellina knelt in prayer, her face glowing with happiness. Oonomoo, touched by his wife's devotion, spoke of their son's admiration for him and his longing to join him on the warpath. Fluellina then read from a Bible, sharing the awe-inspiring verses of the twenty-first chapter of Revelations, filling them both with profound emotions.

The Huron pointed to a rock by the river, signaling Lieutenant Canfield that a canoe was hidden nearby. They cautiously discussed the situation, ensuring no one could overhear them. Suddenly, a canoe emerged with five savages heading towards them. Oonomoo remained calm, but Canfield felt uneasy. The savages landed downstream, and Oonomoo decided to retrieve his canoe to continue the journey. As the Huron swam to his canoe, Canfield noticed a Miami Indian waiting in the canoe below. Realizing the danger, Canfield understood that the Miamis were aware of their presence and potential threat.

The warrior left behind had clear instructions: shoot the savage upon his arrival and, if he had a companion, call for help from his friends waiting nearby. The Miami warrior faced great danger, as the returning Indian could easily attack him from the rock above. The Huron quickly realized the risks and decided to confront the Miami rather than risk capture. Using his quick thinking and agility, the Huron managed to overpower the Miami in a struggle underwater. Despite the danger of being discovered, the Huron skillfully maneuvered to keep the fight hidden from the other Miamis on the bank.

On the second morning of his captivity, Hans Vanderbum woke up early, thinking he had an appointment with Oonomoo, the Huron. He walked slowly to the meeting spot, not wanting to be early due to the Huron's punctuality. On his way, a tree branch fell near him, startling him.

Hans Vanderbum pretended to be sick to stay inside while Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock worked on planting corn. This was his chance to go fishing. He told his wife he'd be back with fish for supper, thanks to a special ingredient given by a Huron Indian to help the kids sleep. On his way, Hans kept tripping over grass knots his mischievous boys made. When his log broke and he fell in the water, he realized his kids were up to no good. After catching fish, he hid from his wife to avoid her anger. Returning home nervously, he found his wife surprisingly calm.

The question clarified everything. Thinking he was ill, her feelings were not angry but concerned. Hans wiped sweat from his forehead and, without realizing, responded: Now, for Hans Vanderbum's plans to succeed, he needed to cook the fish to mix the gum in it. However, his wife kindly refused. Surprised by this setback, Hans devised a clever plan to outsmart her. The children stayed outside without being told. The obliging woman rushed forward, allowing Hans to mix the gum with the fish.

The girl caught sight of two shadowy figures and quickly retreated into the lodge, positioning herself behind a figure on the ground. The two figures passed by without noticing her. Feeling safe in the hands of Keewaygooshturkumkankangewock, she cautiously stepped out again. Meanwhile, Hans Vanderbum realized he was being too noisy and sealed his lips, though his breathing was still audible. As they moved forward, the moonlight outlined Hans' large form against the sky.
