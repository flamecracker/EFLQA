Gerald helped the girl by pulling her feet down and lifting her under the arms. Dry leaves rustled under her boots as they entered a dark cave. Their eyes adjusted to the darkness, revealing a stone cave that led to a narrow gully filled with ferns and grass. Following a path of flagstones covered in leaves, they descended to another arch.

"They ventured into the maze, the feeling of enchantment growing stronger with each step, making them wary of their own footsteps in the silent expanse. Passing through the rose garden, they reached a yew hedge with an arch leading into a maze akin to the one at Hampton Court. ""In the heart of this maze lies the secret enchantment,"" declared Gerald, urging his companions to draw their swords and proceed in silence. The heat within the maze, surrounded by dense yew hedges, made the path to its center elusive. Despite multiple returns to the entrance, they persisted, aided by a red thread that guided them to a circular grassy area. There, they discovered a lady in a resplendent gown, asleep on a stone seat under the sun. Kathleen identified her as the Sleeping Beauty, her attire reminiscent of historical figures. The group, captivated by the unfolding magic, pondered the possibility of Gerald being the Prince destined to awaken her, while Jimmy's skepticism was met with laughter, unsure if the lady was indeed a princess from a bygone era."|"['1.

When Jimmy woke the Sleeping Princess, she invited the three children to her palace for a meal. They felt they were in a magical place as they walked towards the castle.

Inside the castle, the Princess warned them not to talk due to the magic. She returned with bread, cheese, and water, promising the food would transform into anything they desired. Kathleen pretended to enjoy the bread, not wanting to admit any faults. The Princess mentioned wanting roast peacock, while everyone ate and felt better.

The Princess slowly adorned Kathleen with a ruby bracelet, showcasing its splendor. Kathleen was fascinated by the jewels and the silver-framed mirror.

Kathleen was surprised to find herself embraced by invisible arms belonging to Mabel, the housekeeper's niece. Mabel had played a trick to pretend to be invisible, but now she was regretting it. The children, Gerald, Kathleen, and Jimmy, sat in the Temple of Flora, listening to Mabel's despair. Mabel expressed her concern about her aunt's reaction to her invisibility, fearing it might cause her aunt great distress.

Gerald followed the note-folding technique he learned from a lady in India, and Mabel guided them on a quicker route out of the park. The walk back was much shorter. During their meal with Mademoiselle, a mysterious voice accused Gerald of lying about thinking of someone all the time, similar to a falsehood about being adopted by a motor lady. The scene at the table was peculiar as food seemed to vanish into thin air. Gerald worried about Mabel's disappearing breakfast antics causing trouble.

Alright, after breakfast, you'll need to wait here until we find something to bring up to you. Be careful to avoid Eliza when she comes to tidy up. Mabel, feeling hungry and annoyed by the delay, whispered to Eliza, who seemed startled and pale. Eliza diligently cleaned the room, even under the rug and by the fireplace.

The aunt at Yalding Towers opened the door for Mabel, who looked pale and trembling. The aunt scolded Mabel for giving her a fright but then hugged her tightly, relieved she was safe. The aunt felt like she was in a trance and might be getting ill. Gerald, outside, thought there was more to the castle than met the eye. As he walked through the grounds, he felt different, like he was in another world full of magic. Something white appeared under a willow tree, a creature with horns and goat's legs.

As Gerald walked through the garden, he encountered a massive stone lizard that appeared to come alive in the moonlight. Startled by the touch of its stone tail, he ran towards the safety of the house, feeling fear creeping up on him. Inside, he locked the door behind him, seeking refuge from the strange encounter. As he explored the house, he found himself in grand rooms filled with ancient furniture and historical artifacts. Despite his invisibility, he couldn't locate the kitchen.

Gerald closed the door quietly. He felt relieved. The men outside seemed dangerous, and he didn't want to be near them. Gerald had stumbled upon a burglary. The men were stealing silver from the strong-room. They had picked the lock. Gerald knew he had to act fast. He wrote a note and threw it through a window to alert Mabel and her aunt.

Eliza slumped onto a box, puzzled by the strange events. She noticed the bed first empty, then occupied, thinking she might be going crazy. Vowing to tell Mamselle about the mysterious tricks, she expressed frustration at finding black marks on the sheets. Meanwhile, Gerald, the detective hero, searched the room for a missing ring. As the search proved futile, Gerald hinted at other pressing matters. The group then headed to the churchyard wall, where Gerald recounted a tale of moonlit gardens, statues coming to life, and a beast in stone. He continued with a thrilling story of burglars and a warning letter.

"Mabel quickly clarified her point to her friend, ""I think the castle garden might only reveal its liveliness when you're invisible, not its stoniness."" ""You might be onto something,"" he agreed.

Johnson's cottage sits just beyond the town near the blacksmith's forge. The children journeyed through the woods to reach it and returned the same way, passing through the town's narrow streets to the timber yard's towing path. There, they explored the area, playing on the trunks of large trees and creating a see-saw from pine planks and elm roots. Gerald, concerned about being seen by Johnson, used a unique signal by blowing his nose. The children quickly abandoned their play to follow Gerald, who led them in a playful procession, admiring Johnson's distinctive boots.

Mabel asked her friend if she could help search for a lost ring. They scoured the room, checking under the bed and furniture, even looking up at the ceiling. Despite their efforts, the ring was nowhere to be found. Disappointed, they waited for Mabel's sister to arrive. When a strange man appeared at the door, Eliza, the maid, seemed to know him.

Mademoiselle started the applause during the garden scene with her quick French claps. Eliza's hands followed, then more joined in, making a dull sound. Nine faces turned to the stage, seven with painted paper faces. The applause grew as Mabel glided forward, her pose drawing even more. Suddenly, Mademoiselle and Eliza shrieked and fled, causing chaos. Gerald blamed Mabel for making the Ugly-Wuglies come alive. He wished them back to normal and tore through the door. Inside, he encountered strange, living beings with no roofs in their mouths, asking for a hotel recommendation. Gerald, terrified, realized he had to act.|"[""1.

The Ugly-Wugly creature spoke in a language that Gerald couldn't quite understand. Despite the odd appearance of the Ugly-Wugly, it seemed to gain respect and recognition in the neighborhood. Gerald, trying to explain the situation, mentioned a peculiar law that only deaf people could run hotels due to the hops in beer being good for earaches. The Ugly-Wuglies crowded around, discussing lodging options. Gerald, feeling a sense of responsibility, offered to help them find a place to stay.

"As Gerald approached the iron balcony, he couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The peculiar creatures below, known as the Ugly-Wuglies, appeared eerie in the dim light. However, despite the oddity of the situation, Gerald found himself surprisingly calm. He knew their appearance was deceiving, made up of mere clothes and props. As he ascended the steps, the creatures conversed in their peculiar language, with sounds of 'oo's and 'ah's filling the air.

Behind the colored-glass door, Gerald left the yard teeming with the fantastical beings. Ahead lay the quiet house, inhabited by his frightened family members. Gerald, in possession of a magical ring that shielded him from fear, understood the terror his family felt. In an attempt to comfort them, he pretended excitement about the Ugly-Wuglies, assuring his family that they were kind and friendly. Despite his facade, the reality of the situation lingered, and Gerald knew the true nature of the creatures would soon be revealed."|"['1.

Gerald swiftly donned his coat and hurried up the stairs, leaving the others in the hall. They could hear his cheerful knock on Mademoiselle's door, followed by his comforting words and the ensuing conversation. Gerald explained that it was his duty to escort Mabel home, as his brother and sister would enjoy the outing. Despite the suggestion that Eliza could accompany Mabel, it was dismissed due to Eliza's nighttime nerves. Gerald then entrusted Mabel with a secret task, praising her bravery and loyalty.

The Ugly-Wuglies, bizarre characters with golf club and hockey-stick feet, approached Mabel. She stood by a lamp-post, fighting her fear. Gerald, a friend, introduced her as a princess. Mabel, anxious, tried to stay calm, repeating to herself that they were not real. The Ugly-Wuglies, with their odd manners, led her through the town. Gerald admired Mabel's courage as she politely interacted with them. The odd procession reached the Castle gates as the moonlight cast eerie shadows.

Gerald and his companions ventured through the moonlit garden, guided by the dim light of a bicycle lantern. As they passed through the fern-covered path, they marveled at the beauty of the Italian garden. Suddenly, Hermes, the statue, seemed to come to life, but only Gerald could see this magical sight. With the help of a mysterious ring, he revealed the hidden movements of the statue. The group then approached a pool where a prehistoric beast lurked beneath the water's surface. Continuing their journey, they reached the Temple of Flora, where a narrow doorway awaited them. The Ugly-Wuglies, once friendly, turned hostile and resisted entering the doorway, causing chaos and fear among the group. Gerald and Mabel, standing outside, watched in horror as the creatures tried to escape into the night, their eerie sounds filling the air with dread.|"['1.

Gerald felt a hand on his arm, and suddenly all his fears turned real. In a flash, he realized what Mabel had given him. A strong shoulder separated them from the Ugly-Wuglies.

The man finished his story and explained that the coats would turn back to normal after a certain number of hours. The stranger, speaking gently, offered to walk the children home. As they chatted about their adventures, they cleaned up the mess from the night before. Walking towards Flora's Temple, they reflected on the fear they had felt the previous night. Upon reaching the temple, they noticed the man they were supposed to meet lying on the ground with a cut on his forehead. They also saw a paper face peeking out from a nearby bush.

"""I never know what you mean by good-looking,"" said Jimmy. Suddenly, a shadow fell beside them, and a fourth voice spoke, not Mabel's.

Gerald felt unwell and dizzy, struggling to recall why. He tried to comfort the City man who used to be Jimmy until time would reverse the spell. Suddenly, a voice broke the darkness, not the City man's but Jimmy's, Gerald's little brother. Confusion reigned as they found themselves in a dark passage. Jimmy, now rich and old due to a wish, thought they were buried alive. Gerald reassured him it was just a dream. The thin curtain between magic and reality was breached by Mabel and Kathleen's urge to return to the Temple of Flora. When Gerald and Jimmy yelled, a crack of light appeared, and they found themselves back in the temple, greeted by Kathleen and Mabel. Mabel suggested returning the treasure to end the ordeal.|"[""1.

The children made their way to the castle once more. Mabel revealed the hidden jewels by activating a secret spring, including the ring among the ordinary trinkets. Each child tried to imbue the items with magical properties, but nothing happened. Mabel realized that the ring's power was in what they believed it to be. Worried about her sudden growth to four yards tall, Mabel sought refuge at her friends' house for the night. She penned a note to her aunt requesting picnic supplies, attributing her absence to feeling tired from her rapid growth.

There was bread, butter, milk, water, cake, and plump gooseberries. Mabel cautiously emerged from the bushes, and they all enjoyed the feast in contented silence.

The path was steep as Kathleen raced under the bright sun. Her brothers caught up just before she reached the looming shadow of the dinosaur.

Mabel was concerned about the ring, urging the others to retrieve it from Kathleen's hand before her time ran out. Gerald, realizing the gravity of the situation, explained their plan to the statue, hoping it could hear him. He then strategized with the group, deciding to leave Mabel hidden in the woods with the coats to stay warm until Kathleen reappeared.

The sun had set behind the trees, and the moon was rising. Mabel, covered in layers of coats, waistcoats, and trousers, slept peacefully in the evening chill. Inside the dinosaur, Kathleen, trapped in marble, also slept. She had heard Gerald's words and seen the matches, but the marble held her still. It was warm and comforting inside, not cold or hard. Kathleen waited patiently, feeling safe and at ease. Suddenly, she realized she was standing, with tingling feet and stiff arms. The dinosaur was moving! Kathleen feared for Mabel's safety and hesitated to escape through a hole in the beast's underside.

Phoebus Apollo, the Sun-god, complimented Kathleen's charm and modesty before being drawn to the white water that beckoned him. As he dived into the lake, rings of liquid silver spread out. Kathleen, determined to find her friend Mabel and head home, wished she could easily carry Mabel back with her. Kathleen hurried towards the rhododendron bushes, where she found Mabel transformed into a long, worm-like form covered in clothes. Kathleen gently woke Mabel, who explained that they were statues temporarily brought to life by the moonlight.

Mabel hesitated before Phoebus's offer to turn her into a living statue until dawn. She was concerned about the potential consequences of her wish. Phoebus explained that the ring's power is precise but needs specific instructions to avoid unexpected outcomes. To reassure Mabel, he described the magical experience she could have until dawn as a marble statue, promising a return to her original form afterward. After some reluctance, Mabel finally agreed, deciding to remove her shoes and stockings first. Together, they swam effortlessly in a beautiful setting under the moonlit sky, surrounded by water lilies and enchanting scenery.

Phoebus chuckled in response to her question about the extent of his knowledge. He explained that statues can come to life under the moonlight, especially in beautiful temples where the images of priests and warriors awaken and wander. However, these occurrences are rare and can only be witnessed on a special night. He mentioned a festival of harvest where the moonlight illuminates certain temples, including one hidden under a mountain in Hellas and another in a grand garden. As the Sun-god played his lyre, enchanting music filled the air, captivating the listeners and transporting them to a world of beauty and joy. Suddenly, the marble figures around them sprang to life and disappeared into the night, leaving the children standing in the cold grass.

Leaving the sunrise behind, the group descended stone steps leading to an underground passage. The light dimmed as they relied on a bicycle lamp.

The pleasure of cooling your feet in a stream after a hot walk remains indescribable. I could write volumes about it. When I was young, there was a mill-stream with fish, spinning leaves, willows, and alders that made it cool. But this isn't about my life. After a rest, tea was made with milk, cakes, gingerbread, plums, and a melon with ice. It was a feast fit for the gods! The bailiff seemed uneasy when Jimmy shared a tale of statues coming to life.

Gerald disguised himself cleverly and realized a new way to fool others. The governess, Mademoiselle, transformed magically overnight, looking vibrant and stylish. Lord Yalding arrived in a smart wagonette, and they all set off to explore Yalding Towers. The children revealed hidden passages in the castle to their guests. While Lord Yalding and Mademoiselle grew tired and sat in the garden, the children continued their adventure. They encountered a peculiar man named Jefferson D. Conway, who showed interest in the mansion's secrets. Mabel explained the legal situation but proposed a solution for him to rent the place.

Mabel shared tales of Sir Rupert, a headless ghost, and a lady in a pink dress with diamonds in her hair seen at night. The American visitor, armed and bold, challenged the ghosts with his gun. Lord Yalding hosted a lavish lunch, and the children found themselves surrounded by weapons. Later, they were dared to spend the night in the state chamber. As they settled into their beds, a gunshot pierced the silence. To their horror, they saw Sir Rupert, head under his arm, and the American firing shots.

The lights suddenly went out, and when the boys woke up, it was morning. The room was filled with grey light, and rain was pounding against the windows. The American was nowhere to be found. Gerald later explained that their plan had worked. The American had left early to deal with his other house and finalize the purchase of the haunted one. Jimmy, meeting Lord Yalding in the picture-gallery, shared how they made sure the American saw the ghost to seal the deal. Lord Yalding revealed that the American was impressed with the ghost and had an early morning discussion about it. Lord Yalding, while walking through the halls with Mabel and Jimmy, must have felt a mix of bewilderment and wonder, questioning if he was dreaming. The children's belief in the ghost and the fulfillment of their wish left him pondering whether he or they were the ones who were truly mad.|"['1.

I can't give you any hint about what Mademoiselle was thinking or feeling. I just know she was happy, evident from her beaming face. Her guardian had tricked her by sending her to a convent to prevent her from marrying a poor lord, only to run off with her fortune to South America. Left with no money, Mademoiselle had to work as a governess. She chose a job near Lord Yalding's home, hoping to see him, even though she believed he no longer loved her. When they finally met, she must have pondered these events as they walked hand in hand through his house. Meanwhile, Jimmy was determined to make Lord Yalding believe him, a matter of utmost importance to him. Mabel tried to reveal hidden jewels by finding a secret panel, but the jewels remained elusive until the ring was back in the room.

Six individuals witnessed a mesmerizing moonrise, transcending time. The moonbeam illuminated a stone, attracting ancient beasts, winged dragons, mammoths, and colossal birds. Following them, stone gods from Egypt and Assyria, along with cathedral figures and marble deities, converged in silence. No words were exchanged as understanding transcended speech. Each entity entered the light circle peacefully, akin to tired children finding solace at home. The group experienced a profound enlightenment, leaving them forever changed, though unable to recall the specifics. A wave of unity surged through the assembly, culminating in a magical ring's transformation, binding two souls eternally.
