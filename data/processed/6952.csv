In history, the men of Holland and Zeeland fought a long and challenging battle to worship freely and gain independence from Spain. The Dutch faced a powerful enemy led by a ruthless ruler who sought to impose his religion or destroy them. Despite being fishermen, sailors, and farmers with little unity, they bravely defended themselves. The struggle turned peaceful workers into heroic fighters, with women and children showing equal courage. The fight lasted so long that only part of the story is told here, ending with the murder of William of Orange. Rotherhithe in 1572 was a village of seafarers, where ships sailed to and from London. The village had a Dutch influence due to trade with the Low Countries. Captain William Martin's home in Rotherhithe was a replica of his wife's Dutch childhood home, built by her family as a wedding gift.|"['1.

""We would fight them, you may be sure,"" Captain Martin said, ""to the last; but Spain is a mighty power, and all know that there are no soldiers in Europe can stand against their pikemen.

The words spoken by the young man, Ned, were filled with passion and determination. His father cautioned him against rash actions, explaining that any violent act against a Spaniard could lead to dire consequences for many innocent people. Ned, feeling chastised, expressed his desire to join the sea beggars under La Marck if he couldn't fight the Spaniards directly. His father acknowledged the reasoning behind Ned's words, mentioning the desperation of the people living under Spanish rule. The conversation then shifted to the sea beggars' fleet at Dover and the political tensions between England and Spain. The mariners discussed the potential consequences of siding with the Low Countries against Spain and the need for decisive action before it was too late. Despite the heavy topics discussed, the gathering ended on a lighter note, touching on maritime matters and the challenges faced by sailors.

Ned, a young sailor, believed that the Queen would not stop her people from aiding the Netherlands. He was eager to help the Dutch in their struggle against tyranny. Despite his enthusiasm, his sister Constance doubted their father would allow Ned to join the cause. The Good Venture, their ship, set sail for Brill with a cargo. Upon arrival, they encountered a fleet of sea beggars, feared by many. As the sea beggars sought provisions, the captain of the Good Venture hesitated, wary of the consequences. The sea beggars, led by Lord Treslong, were starving and sought help. Ned's encounter with the sea beggars sparked a dilemma about providing aid without risking the ship.

"""We come in peace, Captain,"" the man assured, ""but our crew is in dire need of provisions. The Sieur de Treslong has provided funds to purchase supplies from your vessel. To avoid suspicion, armed men accompany me so you can claim they forced their way aboard if questioned.""

Captain Martin responded, ""I'll gladly share what provisions I have, but they won't last long. Tell Sieur de Treslong that I support the cause and will aid his followers.""

Returning to the ship, provisions were distributed. Koppelstok joined the admiral's vessel to deliver a message to the town. The news caused panic, and the magistrates agreed to negotiate. The town surrendered peacefully, leading to the establishment of the Free Republic of the Netherlands. The conquerors occupied the town, plundered churches, and unfortunately executed some individuals."|"['Question 1: What did the man assure Captain Martin?\nA) They come in peace.\nB) Their crew is in dire need of provisions.\nC) The Sieur de Treslong has provided funds.\nD) Armed men accompany him.\nE) All of the above.', 'Question 2: Why did armed men accompany the man?\nA) To intimidate Captain Martin.\nB) To force their way aboard the vessel.\nC) To purchase supplies.\nD) To avoid suspicion.\nE) To engage in a battle.', ""Question 3: How did Captain Martin respond to the man's request for provisions?\nA) He refused to help.\nB) He agreed to share what provisions he had.\nC) He called for reinforcements.\nD) He demanded payment.\nE) He asked for more details."", ""Question 4: Who joined the admiral's vessel to deliver a message to the town?\nA) Captain Martin\nB) Koppelstok\nC) Sieur de Treslong\nD) The armed men\nE) The magistrates"", 'Question 5: What was the result of the news delivered by Koppelstok to the town?\nA) Panic\nB) Negotiations\nC) Peaceful surrender\nD) Establishment of the Free Republic of the Netherlands\nE) All of the above', 'Question 6: What unfortunate actions did the conquerors take after the town surrendered peacefully?\nA) Occupied the town\nB) Plundered churches\nC) Executed some individuals\nD) Established a new government\nE) Celebrated their victory']"|['E) All of the above.', 'D) To avoid suspicion.', 'B) He agreed to share what provisions he had.', 'B) Koppelstok', 'E) All of the above', 'C) Executed some individuals']
De la Marck, a fierce noble, disregarded orders to treat captives kindly. He vowed vengeance for a relative's death. After capturing Brill, the Good Venture arrived, bringing hope to the city. When Count Bossu attacked, the sea beggars defended Brill fiercely. A carpenter flooded the land, aiding their victory. The Spaniards, overwhelmed, retreated to Utrecht. Captain Martin and his crew watched from afar. He refused Ned's request to witness the battle, fearing Spanish retaliation. Brill's triumph over Bossu was a joyous victory. Despite the magistrates' agreement, the Spaniards broke their promise, causing chaos in Rotterdam. The ruthless Spaniards committed atrocities, slaughtering hundreds.|"[""1.

Captain Martin finished unloading his cargo two days after Bossu's failed attempt on the town. A messenger from Flushing arrived that morning with news that the Seigneur de Herpt had urged the townspeople to drive out the small Spanish garrison. As soon as they succeeded, a large enemy reinforcement arrived, sent by Alva to complete the fortress. Herpt convinced the townspeople to resist further, as they had already provoked the Spaniards. The governor of the island tried to persuade the citizens to return to allegiance, but De Herpt and his followers opposed, reminding them of the harsh consequences of revolt. The governor left, and the citizens of Flushing offered arms and ammunition in exchange for experienced fighters. Two hundred beggars, led by Treslong, set off for Flushing. The appearance of Treslong's men was striking, dressed in plundered church garments, singing sea songs of vengeance against the Spaniards and the Papacy.|"['1.

The Good Venture briefly docked in Flushing but left promptly as there were no cargo opportunities. Captain Martin decided to sail to England to consult with the merchants he worked for due to the changing circumstances. Daily news of rebellion spreading across Holland, Zeeland, and Friesland fueled the desire for freedom. Despite Spanish forces in Flanders, the Dutch towns revolted. The uprising began in Brill and Flushing, inspiring other towns to rebel. The States of Holland renounced the Duke of Alva's authority and supported the Prince of Orange. However, a setback occurred when Huguenot troops were defeated by the Spanish in July. The Prince of Orange faced challenges but remained determined to fight for freedom. Tragic events in France shocked Protestant Europe but pleased Philip of Spain. The Prince of Orange disbanded his army and prepared to face the fate of the provinces that stood by him.|"['1.

In a letter to his brother, Count Louis of Nassau expressed his intention to make his sepulcher. Facing surrender, his French soldiers refused to resist after the king's change of heart. The city surrendered, and the garrison left with their weapons. However, instead of upholding the terms for the townspeople, a council of blood was established. For months, between ten to twenty inhabitants were executed daily. The news of the St. Bartholomew massacre and the atrocities in the Netherlands fueled anger in England. The queen mourned but hesitated to aid the Netherlands. Sophie Martin, worried about her family in Amsterdam, sent a letter with her husband, Captain Martin, urging them to come to London. The Netherlands was in turmoil, with all classes vulnerable to Alva's Council of Blood. Spies abounded, and false accusations led to executions. Captain Martin and his son, Ned, feared for the safety of Sophie's family as they sailed towards Amsterdam.|"['1.

Upon reaching the bustling city of Amsterdam, Captain Martin and Ned docked their ship alongside the quays. The city was rich in trade and wealth, with many monasteries and authorities loyal to Spain. Despite some citizens supporting freedom, they were powerless against the pro-Spain regime. The next morning, after clearing their papers, they moved the ship to the crowded port. Captain Martin then went ashore with Ned to visit the merchants. They planned to unload the cargo the following day. As they walked towards Vordwyk, they were shocked to find the house they often visited in ruins. A villager informed them that the residents, including old man Plomaert and his sons, were taken away and executed for attending a field preaching event. The property was seized, and the house burnt down. The man warned Captain Martin of the dangers of associating with the condemned.|"['1.

Captain Martin's sorrow and anger overflowed as he cursed the Spaniards for their cruel deeds. Ned, feeling stunned by the news of his family's tragedy, had never realized the extent of the danger his relatives faced. His father, stirred by the loss, expressed a desire to join the fight against the Spanish oppressors. Ned, eager to defend his Dutch heritage, proposed joining the prince's forces to fight for freedom. His father, cautious of the dangers of war, promised to discuss the matter when Ned was older. As they made their way back to the ship, Captain Martin's crew expressed their outrage at the massacre, longing for vengeance. Ned, restless and agitated, shared the news with the sailors, igniting their fury. The crew fantasized about a retaliatory mission, dreaming of justice for the slain.|"[""1.

The following morning, the sailors began unloading the cargo. They worked diligently, eager to leave the place that one of them described as smelling of blood. In the afternoon, a boy about Ned's age arrived on board. He was the son of the merchant who owned most of the cargo. The boy handed Captain Martin a letter from his father, urgent in nature. The letter revealed a serious accusation against Captain Martin for insulting the King of Spain and others. Captain Martin, a rare sea captain who could read and write, realized the gravity of the situation. The letter warned of a potential arrest, but Captain Martin strategized with his crew to evade capture. Despite a risky escape plan to row to Haarlem, he hesitated to leave the ship due to fears of confiscation. The captain pondered the dilemma of protecting his crew and the ship while navigating the political tensions between England and Spain.|"['1.

Peters expressed concern about the French ship blocking their way out of the port. He mentioned the presence of Spanish war vessels that could send rowboats after them. The next day, while unloading continued, the French captain shared his urgent need to move his ship to the wharf due to personal reasons related to the Spaniards. He sought Captain Martin's help to quietly shift his berth at night for a safe escape. Captain Martin advised waiting until dark to avoid suspicion. The plan involved greasing the blocks for a quiet departure towards the southwest wind. The French captain acknowledged the risks but hoped for a successful getaway to avoid the pursuing warships. Captain Martin had a contingency plan to row to safety if needed.|"[""1.

Ned, who had been keeping a close watch all day, noticed two Spanish officials on the wharf near the ship. They seemed idle and unconcerned. He informed his father that they might be watching. Later, the merchant arrived and spoke to Captain Martin on deck. As night fell and the wharf emptied, Captain Martin prepared for a quiet departure. The crew greased the ship's blocks for silent operation, lowered a boat with muffled oars, and armed themselves against potential threats. The men were determined to protect their captain and the ship. Ned, ensuring the coast was clear, reported back to his father about the quiet surroundings. The crew was ready for a stealthy departure under the cover of darkness.|"['1.

"""Let's start now, Ned,"" said Captain Martin. ""There are still sounds in town, so any noise we make won't be easily noticed."" The sailors, barefooted for stealth, prepared the ship. The cannons were loaded, stones placed on deck for cover, and tools readied. The plan was set in motion quietly. The boat was manned, a sailor cast off the bow hawser, and the ship began to move out. They rowed silently, avoiding attention, with Ned steering carefully. As they moved away, the tension eased, and they watched the shore lights for direction. The ship sailed smoothly, evading the anchored vessels. Captain Martin extended the rope for Ned to stay ahead and watch for obstacles.

"""Pull in the sails, everyone,"" Captain Martin instructed, signaling to move quickly. Shortly after, the boat reached the side of the ship. ""Let it drift behind, Peters,"" the captain directed as Ned and the rowers climbed aboard. Suddenly, a guard boat approached, causing a stir among the crew. They armed themselves and stood ready as the boat neared. In a tense moment, the guard boat demanded the ship to stop, but Captain Martin explained they were sailing with the wind. However, the guard boat then attacked, and chaos ensued. Despite the danger, Captain Martin urged the crew to raise the sails swiftly to escape.

Captain Martin and his crew on the Good Venture were in high spirits after successfully evading the Spaniards. As they sailed under the moonlight, they joked about the pursuit. The crew hoped for a worthy adversary to make the chase more thrilling. Suddenly, a distant gunshot was heard, but Captain Martin was confident in their safety due to the distance. The moonlight could reveal their ship to the enemy, but the crew remained optimistic. They knew the Spaniards couldn't identify them yet, mistaking them for other vessels. Despite the light wind, the crew was prepared for any encounter, especially with enemy ships.

Several shots were fired, but they fell behind. Captain Martin believed they were too far for the cannon to reach. He sent Ned to keep watch from the foretop. The moon gave them an advantage against any potential threats ahead. The captain estimated they had a two-mile lead if it was the pursuing galleys. They were moving at four knots, while the galleys might row at six. The crew prepared to defend the ship, knowing they had provoked a conflict. Peters readied the guns for an impending attack.

"Captain Martin and Peters stood on the poop deck, watching as the two boats trailed behind, the rowers urged on by officers. When the boats closed in, they prepared to defend their ship. ""Lie down, men,"" Captain Martin ordered the sailors, deciding to focus their fire on one boat. As the boats approached, they fired their cannons, sinking one boat instantly. The Spaniards in the other boat tried to board but were met with fierce resistance. Boiling water and pitch rained down on them, and the sailors fought back with pikes and axes. In a few intense minutes, the Spaniards retreated, leaving many behind. The crew cheered as the threat passed. Peters noted the enemy picking up survivors, but most had been defeated."|['1.

"Captain Martin climbed to the stern of the ship. Soon, the boat joined another one that had fallen behind, its crew scalded and unable to row. They reported discouraging news, and the third boat decided not to pursue. Some rowers transferred to the other boat, and they turned back to Amsterdam. ""There's no way around it,"" the mate agreed. ""She's got big guns, and our small boats are no match. Trying to fight her head-on wouldn't work."" Peters asked about boarding, but the captain had a plan. They sailed straight at the enemy ship, taking a broadside hit. The crew then sang a sea beggar song to intimidate the Spaniards. As the Spanish ship fired again, missing their mark, the Good Venture closed in. Captain Martin outmaneuvered the enemy, showing their superior speed and skill."|"['1.

"""No, you won't, Peters; my place is the place of danger. But if you like you can lie under the bulwark there after you have fired, and be ready to take my place if you see me drop. Now, lads, get ready."" So saying the captain put down the tiller. The Good Venture swept round under the stern of the Spaniard at a distance of some forty yards, and as she did so the guns loaded with bullets to the muzzle were fired one after the other. The effect was terrible, and the galleries and poop were swept by the leaden shower. Then the captain straightened the helm again. The crew burst into the wild yells and cries the beggars raised when going into battle. The Spaniards, confused by the terrible slaughter worked by the guns of their enemies, and believing that they were about to be boarded on the port side by a crowd of desperate foemen, hastily put up the tiller, and the ship bore away as the Good Venture swept up, presenting her stern instead of her broadside to them.

To the momentary relief of the Spaniards their assailant instead of imitating their maneuvers kept straight upon her course before the wind, and instead of the wild cries of the beggars a hearty English cheer was raised. As Captain Martin had expected, the guns on the port side had not been reloaded after the last discharge, and the Good Venture was two or three hundred yards away before the Spaniards"|['1.

"""I am afraid it has, captain,"" Peters said ruefully; ""and it is no use my saying that it has not. I think, sir, we had best put in at Enkhuizen. We are not above four or five miles from it now, and we shall find surgeons there who will do all they can for you.""

""Well done, Englishmen!"" the voice exclaimed, and the boat at once rowed out to the brig. ""You cannot come in tonight,"" the Dutch official said, ""for the chain is up across the harbour, and the rule is imperative and without exception; but I will gladly take your captain on shore, and he shall have, I promise you, the best surgical aid the town can give him. Is he the only one hurt?""

""One of the men has been injured with a splinter, but he needs but bandaging and laying up for a few days. We have had a shot or two through our bulwarks, and the sails are riddled.

The mattress upon which Captain Martin was lying was brought out and lowered carefully into the stern of the boat. Ned took his seat beside it, and the boat pushed off.

The burgomaster, though deliberate, was a valuable assistant. Ned thought his promise to expedite the ship's sailing was just words until they boarded.

I don't think my friends would complain, Ned, as they're all close to me and usually happy with what I do for them. But in business matters, it's crucial to be strict and follow a set routine. I would have calculated the ship's usual earnings for the time it was away and paid my partners their share as if it had been trading normally. Just because the ship is partly mine and profitable doesn't give me the right to divert it for my own gain. It's essential to prioritize others' interests over our own in business dealings. Always remember, lad, to do a little extra in all you undertake. That extra effort sets you apart and earns the trust and confidence of those who rely on you. Your duty is to ensure their trust is well placed, even if it means a personal loss. So, always think more of others' interests than your own.|"[""1.

Ned easily secured the use of a house in Enkhuizen at a reasonable rate through the agent. The burgomaster's wife arranged for two servants and a nurse for his father.

Ned informed his father and prepared him for the transfer to the new house. The doctor ensured a smooth transition, covering his father on the litter to shield him from the cold air.

"""This is no robbery, sir, but a rescue,"" Ned explained to Mynheer Von Bost. ""You must ride with your wife to Sluys or another seaport immediately to save your lives.

Two hours later, he arrived at St. Nicholas. He could have continued straight to Bergen op Zoom, the port where he hoped to find a boat. However, he decided to check Genet's papers for urgent matters. With Genet's death, he no longer feared being discovered. After securing his horse at an inn, he ordered a meal and examined the papers. Among them was a list of twelve names, including Von Bost, with some crossed out. The documents ordered the arrest of those named and their families. Another document from the Council instructed assistance to the bearer. There was also a list of suspected residents. Ned realized he needed to warn them. He obtained the addresses of the three to be arrested, all prominent figures. Ned visited the first, a cloth manufacturer, and revealed the false charges and impending execution. He advised fleeing before the authorities caught up, providing the document for proof.|"[""1.

Ned swiftly departed before the stunned man could express his gratitude for the help. He then visited two other men facing arrest orders, who received him more kindly. Ned gently informed them of their situation and advised them on how to escape. One man had connections in Sluys and the other in Axel. Ned handed them the arrest orders for burghers in those towns, and they promised to warn the suspects. Grateful for their rescue from death, they thanked Ned profusely. After completing his tasks, Ned rode to Bergen op Zoom, a key town near the Scheldt River. He was familiar with the town's divided loyalty to the Spanish cause. Ned sought refuge at a waterside inn where he hoped to find a way to return to Rotterdam. The innkeeper, cautious of strangers, was surprised by Ned's appearance. Ned explained his temporary departure from the sea to aid the Dutch cause due to family tragedies. The innkeeper warned Ned of the dangers posed by Spanish ships in the area.|"['1.

"The men's expressions shifted, and both stood and greeted Ned warmly. ""That was a courageous act, young man; your father's name is esteemed in every town in Holland.

The landlord intervened, urging them to depart promptly. They headed to the boat, a ten-ton craft, and set sail. The wharves appeared deserted. Ned was welcomed by the sailors, who were eager to hear about his recent encounter with the Spaniards. After a meal, the skipper advised Ned to keep busy in case authorities searched the boat.

The men rowed back with a good catch of fish, which would fetch a good price in town due to scarcity. They were informed that city constables had been searching for a man, but found nothing suspicious on board. The skipper planned a safe route through the river, avoiding Spanish-held towns. The crew prepared to navigate past forts and warships under the cover of darkness. They used poles wrapped in sail strips to silently drift down the river. The captain instructed the crew to maintain silence and be ready to act quickly if needed. As they set off, the men followed the plan cautiously, keeping close to the wall to avoid detection.

Slowly, the boat moved along with the men using poles against the wall to guide it. The captain steered close to the wall, reaching the end where the forts stood detached. Approaching a dangerous area, they left the shadows and moved openly. The mist thickened, hiding the forts from view. As they continued, a dark object appeared, and the boat collided with a large ship. Challenges and threats were shouted from the ship, but the crew remained silent. The ship disappeared into the mist, and the crew prepared to row away. Ned suggested tying a line to the ship's stern to follow it unnoticed.

In a short time, the captain signaled to stop rowing as the line had tightened. A bright light from the Spanish ship served as a guide for the boats. Soon, two large boats filled with soldiers arrived. Those in a nearby boat overheard the Spaniards' disappointment at finding an empty vessel. The soldiers decided to anchor the boat and leave a few men onboard. They planned to capture the Spaniards after they settled in for the night. The group waited until the Spaniards were settled, then quietly approached the ship. They cut the cable, allowing the boat to drift away unnoticed.

"The ship's cabin at the rear was used by the captain and passengers, while the crew stayed in the forecastle.

The captain assured the soldiers that they would honor the agreement and let them leave unarmed, valuing lives over violence. After a brief discussion, the soldiers agreed. Ned watched to ensure the soldiers disarmed before they departed. The sailors stood ready in case of any last-minute treachery from the Spaniards. However, the Spaniards feared betrayal more than the sailors did. They left the ship one by one, under the watchful eyes of the sailors, and boarded a boat in the dark. Once everyone was on board, the boat was cast off, and they set sail. The captain mentioned that they were safe from the Spanish garrison, and they set course for Rotterdam.

The brutal events at Naarden surpassed the horrors of Zutphen. The massacre only fueled the Hollanders' resolve for freedom. With Naarden fallen, only a slim strip of land facing the sea remained loyal to the cause. The rest of the Netherlands bowed to Spanish rule. Holland and some Zeeland islands were the last bastions. The threat was dire; the Spanish vowed extermination to any city resisting. Ned's father, recovering and ready to sail, invited Ned to join the Good Venture to Haarlem.

The next day, Ned set sail with the fleet. The wind was gentle as they navigated towards Haarlem. Suddenly, the wind ceased, and the ships anchored. The weather had turned bitterly cold, causing the sea to freeze. Ned and his crewmates gathered to discuss their situation. They decided to huddle the ships closely together to defend against any potential threat. Despite the thin ice hindering their movements, they managed to create a channel around the ships by breaking the ice. As night fell, crews rotated in rowing boats to prevent the water from freezing.

Ned, during breakfast, shared his strategy against the Spanish attack with the lieutenant. The plan was to surprise the Spaniards on the ice, using skates and arquebuses. The Dutch crew, skilled skaters, prepared to face the Spanish troops approaching from Amsterdam. As the Spanish struggled on the ice, the Dutch skaters swiftly fired their arquebuses and retreated to reload, repeating the tactic. The Spanish, unaccustomed to the ice, found it challenging to aim accurately. When the Spanish reached the water belt around the Dutch ships, they faced a barrage of cannon fire, causing heavy casualties. The Dutch crew's effective use of skates and arquebuses gave them the upper hand in the battle against the Spanish troops.|"[""1.

The Spanish commander ordered a retreat as they were attacked by the Dutch. The Hollanders used skates to swiftly move over the ice, surprising the Spaniards. The Spanish soldiers learned from this tactic and practiced skating. The next day, a strong wind and rain broke the ice, allowing the Dutch ships to escape back to Enkhuizen. Ned, concerned about the Spanish threat, urged his aunt to leave Haarlem for safety. Despite the danger, his aunt hesitated. Ned suggested seeking refuge in Leyden, but time was running out. The Spanish forces were closing in on Haarlem, and Ned knew they had to act quickly to ensure the safety of his family.|"['1.

Dame Plomaert hesitantly agreed to follow her nephew to her father's house, but her father was absent. When he returned, he supported the idea of leaving for the safety of her and the girls. Despite previous discussions, Elizabeth was reluctant to leave. Ned quickly arranged for horses, as the city was under siege and horses were of no use. Unfortunately, reinforcements arrived, closing all exit routes. Dame Plomaert preferred to stay and wait out the siege, confident in the city's defense. Ned planned to seek help from the prince in Leyden. The garrison, led by Ripperda, was determined to resist. Some of the magistracy had tried to negotiate secretly with Alva, but were caught and executed. Sainte Aldegonde was sent to reorganize the magistracy.|"[""1.

At the start of the siege, the defenders of the town numbered about 3000 men, vastly outnumbered by the 30,000 Spaniards encircling the city. The Spaniards, led by Don Frederick, positioned themselves at the north walls, while other regiments closed in from the east and west. The fog provided cover for supplies to be smuggled into the city by brave men, women, and even children. The garrison, reinforced by volunteers, now stood at a thousand pioneers, three thousand fighters, and three hundred fighting women, led by the courageous Kanau Hasselaer. The siege began with a fierce attack by the Spaniards, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Despite the odds, the defenders valiantly repelled the initial assault, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.|['1.

After the Spaniards retreated, the city was joyful. Ned's aunt surprised him by taking her daughters out during an alarm, carrying balls of flax soaked in oil and turpentine to hurl at the Spanish column. She then calmly returned home. The Prince of Orange sent a force towards the town, but they got lost in mist and were attacked by the Spaniards. The citizens retaliated by throwing heads of captives into the Spanish camp. Ned suggested building a hiding place due to the dwindling provisions. He proposed using the wood cellar, which was whitewashed and half-filled with wood, for this purpose. With his aunt's approval, Ned began planning the construction in the cellar.|"[""1.

"""We must act quickly,"" he told the girls who trailed behind him. ""Our first task is to stack the wood to create a passageway. I will fetch a pick to remove the bricks at this corner."" ""That's a good plan, Lucette; however, we need more room to work. Let's start by removing the bricks up to the top. We can seal it later.

During the siege of Haarlem, a fierce battle raged underground as Spaniards and Dutch fighters clashed man to man in narrow passages lit only by torches. The Dutch, with their strength and fearlessness, countered the Spaniards' weapon skills. The air thick with powder and sulfur, combatants fought tirelessly in the dim light. Despite the heavy casualties, the battle persisted for a fortnight until Don Frederick, realizing the futility of his efforts, withdrew his troops. Meanwhile, the besieged city received reinforcements and prepared for the impending breach of the Cross gate. As the Spaniards launched a midnight assault, the citizens valiantly defended the breach using boiling oil, stones, and torches, holding off the attackers until reinforcements arrived, showcasing their unwavering spirit and determination.|"['1.

During the siege of Haarlem, the Spanish forces faced unexpected challenges. After a successful attack on the ravelin, they were surprised by a new wall hidden from their view. The citizens had prepared an explosive trap, causing the ravelin to blow up with soldiers inside. The Spaniards, facing harsh conditions and diseases, struggled to sustain their siege. The citizens, though suffering, had a slight advantage due to their better living conditions. As the siege dragged on, the citizens endured a monotonous life, trying to provoke the Spaniards into attacking again. However, the Spanish commanders, aware of the citizens' dwindling supplies, chose to wait out the city through a slow process of famine. Eventually, the frost broke, ending the suffering from cold, and spring brought new challenges for both the besiegers and the besieged.|['1.

Don Frederick, feeling provoked by the response, resumed military actions, much to the relief of the besieged. The artillery fire recommenced, leading to daily skirmishes. One foggy night, the besieged attempted to sabotage the principal Spanish battery but were all killed in the attempt. Count Bossu, constructing a fleet in Amsterdam, breached the dyke, cutting off communication. The Prince of Orange, building ships at the opposite end of the lake, aimed to aid the city. He sought reinforcements from Germany or France but faced challenges rallying volunteers. His strategy focused on severing the road along the dyke to isolate Amsterdam. Sonoy, under the prince's orders, attacked the dyke, causing flooding. Despite a fierce battle, the Dutch were overwhelmed, and many retreated. The valiant John Haring defended the dyke until he swam to safety, a heroic act. The Spanish retaliated with brutal executions, inciting vengeance among the citizens. Amid the carnage, Captain Curey, driven by duty but haunted by the violence, displayed remarkable courage in battle despite his inner turmoil.|"['1.

On the 25th of March, a daring attack was launched by a group of one thousand defenders in Haarlem. They managed to drive off the Spanish outposts, causing significant losses to the enemy. The besieged were able to capture cannons, standards, and provisions, which they successfully brought back into the city. Despite facing reinforcements from veteran Spanish regiments, the people of Haarlem were more focused on the lake for aid. A fierce naval battle ensued on the 28th of May between Admiral Bossu's Spanish fleet and Martin Brand's Dutch ships. The Spaniards emerged victorious, capturing many Dutch vessels. With their supplies dwindling, the inhabitants of Haarlem resorted to extreme measures, consuming all available food sources to survive the relentless siege. Despite the dire circumstances, they held out hope for a rescue plan from the prince, even as starvation loomed.|"['1.

During June, Ned struggled to resist touching the precious food supply. His aunt had become frail, barely moving. The girls showed signs of hunger, their faces silently pleading for food. Ned risked his life to gather grass for them. The town faced death as people fell in the streets, left unburied. Deputies tried to negotiate peace with the Spanish, but failed. The prince gathered volunteers to relieve the city. Despite being aware of the plan, the Spanish set a trap. The relieving force was ambushed, resulting in a devastating defeat. With no hope left, the townspeople decided to make a final stand. Men formed a protective square around the vulnerable, preparing to fight their way out or face death together.|['1.

The news of the citizens' decision reached Don Frederick, who anticipated a fiery retaliation from the burghers of Haarlem. In response, he sent a letter, posing as Count Overstein, promising no punishment upon surrender except for those deemed guilty by the citizens themselves.

Following the surrender, a brutal massacre ensued, sparing only the German soldiers. Ned, assisting his family, provided them with food and shelter in a hidden refuge. The citizens were subjected to a ruthless execution, sparing only those who could pay a ransom.

Ned cautiously made his way through the silent camp, where he discovered a group of German soldiers gathered around a speaker. The soldier was passionately addressing the men about the injustices they faced in the service of Spain, urging them to demand their rightful pay and share of the loot. The soldiers, in agreement, voiced their support loudly. Understanding the mutiny unfolding, Ned quickly left the camp and continued his journey to Leyden. Upon arriving, he learned that the Prince of Orange was in Delft and promptly rode there. The prince welcomed him warmly and inquired about the situation in Haarlem. Ned reassured him that while there were executions, it was not a full-blown massacre. The news was crucial as it could give the prince time to prepare for the advancing enemy forces.|"['1.

The prince was pleased to hear the news of the mutiny among the troops. This gave them some time to breathe, which was much needed. The Spaniards could easily overpower them if they advanced now. The prince acknowledged Ned's loyalty and bravery in their cause. He offered Ned a position leading a company of volunteers, but Ned humbly declined, preferring to stay by the prince's side and assist in any way he could. The defense of Haarlem had been costly, with 10,000 soldiers lost in battle or to disease. Alva tried to win back the people of Holland with a proclamation, but it was met with laughter and jokes. The people knew they could not trust Spanish promises. The Prince of Orange struggled to raise a force to relieve towns under siege, with cities reluctant to contribute money or soldiers. The prince's brother was raising an army, but success was uncertain. The prince focused on building a fleet to combat the Spanish at sea. Ned dutifully delivered messages for the prince, aiding in their efforts.|"[""1.

Ned, feeling unsure about his age and rank, decided to do his best for the prince's mission. Later, Ned received new clothes and armor, transforming his appearance. He laughed at his reflection but felt ready for the task. Ned thanked the prince and received final instructions before setting off with soldiers to Alkmaar. Upon arrival, he noticed the townspeople fleeing due to the advancing Spaniards.

Within an hour, 800 troops arrived from Egmont Castle and Abbey, where they had been stationed while the citizens hesitated. Four citizens assigned them lodgings, and Governor Sonoy met with the chosen representatives. Ned outlined the organization used in Haarlem, emphasizing the need to group armed men, record women's details, and assign tasks based on abilities. Children were to assist their mothers.

The attack on Alkmaar was relentless, with fresh troops repeatedly trying to breach the city's defenses, only to be pushed back each time.

During the last days of Alva's rule, chaos reigned as his plans crumbled. His army retreated from Alkmaar, facing naval defeat. Despite his impending departure, Alva's cruelty persisted. Nobleman Uitenhoove was gruesomely executed, roasting over a slow fire. Alva left behind massive debts in Amsterdam, abandoning the city and its people to financial ruin. His successor, Don Louis de Requesens, arrived in Brussels, bringing a glimmer of hope to the suffering Netherlands. However, Requesens continued Alva's oppressive policies, demanding Protestants recant or leave. Amidst this turmoil, a battle loomed over the besieged city of Middleburg.

The Prince of Orange faced a devastating blow with the loss of his two brothers and the defeat of his army. His dedication to his country had drained his fortune and led to constant threats on his life. The Spaniards had control over most of the Netherlands, leaving the prince in a precarious position. Fortunately, the Spanish soldiers, despite their victory, demanded payment and mutinied. They extorted money and goods from the citizens of Antwerp until their demands were met. Amidst their revelry, a cannon fire interrupted as Boisot attacked the Spanish fleet, burning fourteen ships. The siege of Leyden was lifted, but the citizens failed to prepare for a potential second siege despite the prince's warnings. The Spaniards returned to find Leyden unprepared, highlighting the consequences of apathy in times of crisis.|"['1.

Leyden was surrounded by lush pastures reclaimed from the sea, with charming villages and flourishing gardens. Canals crisscrossed the area, forming the city's streets and shaded by trees, connected by numerous bridges. A tower of ancient origins stood in the city center. Valdez and his troops took control of the Hague and the surrounding areas. English volunteers fled to Leyden, seeking refuge, but were turned away by the city's residents. The Spaniards laid siege to Leyden, constructing a ring of redoubts, isolating the town. Despite the odds, the citizens relied on their courage and the promise of Prince of Orange for relief. The prince urged the citizens to hold out, assuring them of a plan for their rescue within three months.

While waiting for the water to rise, provisions were gathered in towns, and 200 small vessels were prepared. Unfortunately, the prince fell ill with a fever from anxiety. A letter arrived on August 21st, stating that the town had food for two months and then only malt cake for four days. The prince assured them the dykes were breached, bringing excitement. The Spaniards doubted the prince's plan, but the relief force of 2500 set out. The Land Scheiding dyke was captured, but the Greenway dyke posed a challenge.

A message was received by Boisot, a peasant, about a low dyke dividing two villages. Boisot swiftly sailed in that direction. Despite a strong Spanish force stationed there, they fled in fear due to rising waters, the fleet's presence, and the reputation of the daring sailors. The dyke was cut, villages burned, and the fleet moved towards North Aa. The Spanish abandoned their position and retreated to Zoetermeer, a fortified village near the city walls. The fleet faced delays at North Aa due to the Kirkway dyke. The Prince of Orange, recovering from illness, motivated sailors, and ordered the destruction of Kirkway. Meanwhile, Leyden suffered greatly, with citizens starving and dying from famine and plague. Despite the hardships, the people of Leyden refused to surrender to the Spaniards, determined to fight till the end.|['1.

The east wind persisted, causing concern for Admiral Boisot. However, a fierce gale from the northwest, then shifting to the southwest, reinvigorated the fleet. The water surged onto Holland's southern coast, breaching the dykes. Within a day, the fleet was afloat once more. Despite the storm and darkness, they advanced. Spanish vessels aiding the defenders were swept aside. The fleet navigated past obstacles, harpooning and battling the Spaniards. Many perished, but some escaped to the Hague. Zoeterwoude fell, but Lammen remained a formidable barrier. Boisot planned to attack Lammen the next day. Leyden awaited the fleet's arrival. The citizens, eager to aid their brethren, decided on a daring sortie. A tense night passed, and in the morning, Lammen was found abandoned by the Spaniards, securing Leyden's salvation.|"[""1.

In March 1576, the siege continued as Requesens, the Spanish leader, fell ill and died suddenly. His death was partly due to the stress caused by a mutiny among the troops.

Don John negotiated and stalled, while secretly rallying support against democratic towns and religious freedom.

Sir Edward Martin was in Antwerp when he learned about the prince's murder. He was deeply saddened by the loss of his friend and admired leader. Initially, he feared that the Netherlands' cause was lost with the prince's death. However, the successful defense of their cities and the people's determination brought hope. Unfortunately, there were blunders in preparing for Antwerp's defense. The Admiral of the fleet, Treslong, disobeyed orders, delaying vital supplies. Despite initial despair, the citizens rallied under Sainte Aldegonde's leadership. There were disagreements about strategic decisions, like piercing the dyke. The city's fate was sealed by the prince's death and the burghers' stubbornness. Antwerp's defense was further weakened by indiscipline among English and Scottish regiments and the militia's insubordination.

During the siege of Antwerp, the Duke of Parma strategically positioned fortified posts along the Lower Scheldt, obstructing river navigation. The forts of Lillo and Liefkenshoek, located nine miles below the city, were key points. Liefkenshoek fell to the Spanish forces after a surprise attack, resulting in the loss of its entire garrison. Lillo, defended by Antwerp volunteers and foreign troops, withstood a fierce assault by the Spaniards. Mondragon, leading the siege, faced difficulties breaching the fort's defenses. A failed attempt, coupled with high tides and a counterattack by the defenders, forced the Spanish to retreat, abandoning the siege.

Ned recounted a chaotic scene at the town hall, where twenty men shouted, ignoring each other while the rest added to the noise. Sainte Aldegonde regretted the lack of a strong leader like the prince to guide them. On the Flemish side, the sluices at Saftingen were opened, flooding the land except for Kalloo and nearby villages. The Lord of Kowenstyn urged cutting the dykes to prevent Spanish advancement, but it was too late. Parma's forces gained an advantage by bringing in supplies through the Scheldt. Despite efforts to resist, Parma's strategic fortifications posed a significant threat. The capture of Teligny was a setback, and Parma eventually called for Antwerp's surrender.

When Hohenlohe returned with 2000 fresh troops and found the gates shut, he had to leave due to his own mistakes. He had encouraged his followers to plunder, causing the failure of the mission. If he had waited for the main force or left a guard at the gate, success was possible. Parma acknowledged that the siege of Antwerp would have been abandoned if the rebels had succeeded. The winter arrived, preventing the blocking of the river. Parma built a strong bridge of boats defended by 170 guns to overcome the river obstacles. Despite despair among citizens, Parma faced financial and troop issues. He smiled outwardly but felt despair within. Meanwhile, Brussels surrendered, and Parma's attempt to surprise Ostend failed due to soldiers' plundering, leading to the enterprise's abandonment.|"['1.

The residents of Antwerp faced a critical situation. Armed vessels from Zeeland, supported by troops from Fort Lillo, successfully recaptured Fort Liefkenshoek and Fort St. Anthony. However, a delay in following orders allowed Parma to reinforce the broken dyke near the bridge, preventing the destruction of the barrier. Despite this setback, the patriots regained control of the river up to three miles from the bridge. Gianobelli, an Italian inventor, proposed a plan to destroy Parma's bridge using ships filled with explosives. Unfortunately, the Antwerp Council only provided two small vessels for this purpose. The plan involved loading the ships with a chamber filled with explosives and heavy materials. The operation, set for April 5th, faced challenges as fireboats were prematurely launched, and the mine ships were detected by the Spaniards. The attempt to destroy the bridge ultimately failed.|"['1.

Two ships approached the bridge. The Fortune came first, but did not touch the bridge as it grounded near the shore. Despite a faint explosion, no damage was done. Sir Ronald Yorke boarded to investigate the cargo but found it impossible. Meanwhile, the Spaniards mocked the failed attempt. The Hope followed, striking the bridge and catching fire. Soldiers rushed to extinguish the flames. A sudden explosion occurred, causing havoc. Many lives were lost, and the bridge suffered severe damage. The Zeeland fleet was ready to attack but retreated due to poor leadership. Parma worked to restore the bridge quickly. Antwerp learned of the breach too late.

On the dyke were three forts named St. James, St. George, and the Fort of the Palisades, each a mile apart. A battle occurred on the 7th of May when Zeelanders landed between St. George's and Fort Palisade. They were overpowered by the Spanish attacks and retreated, leaving ships behind. Later that month, a grand attack was launched from Zeeland and Antwerp. The Spanish saw fireships approaching and prepared for an assault. The Zeelanders and the Antwerp fleet, led by Sainte Aldegonde, joined forces. A fierce battle ensued, with the patriots gaining ground. With the dyke breached, a Zeeland barge floated triumphantly, signaling victory. The patriots, including English and Scotch troops, entrenched their position and drove the Spaniards back into their forts. The commanders, Sainte Aldegonde and Hohenlohe, rushed back to Antwerp to share the news of their triumph.|['1.

During a fierce battle on a narrow dyke, the Spanish forces led by Mondragon launched several assaults against the patriots' position. The fight was intense, with the patriots repelling the Spaniards three times before a fourth assault succeeded. The Spaniards, believing they were led by a deceased commander, gained fresh courage and breached the entrenchment. As the tide ebbed and the Zeelanders' ships drew off, the patriots, feeling abandoned, panicked and tried to escape to the ships. The English and Scotch soldiers valiantly held their ground, but most were overwhelmed. Amid the chaos, Ned Martin and Justinius of Nassau swam to a Zeeland ship and escaped. The failed attempt on the Kowenstyn dyke led to Antwerp's surrender in August, marking a turning point in the struggle for Dutch freedom.|"['1.
