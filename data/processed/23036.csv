After the battle, the wounded were attended to by the baymen. They washed the blood off the table and bandaged the wounds. The lad was then taken to a bunk, where he was given a drink to help him rest. Dave Darrin, accompanied by a junior officer, went to another room where fallen seamen lay. Dave paid his respects to each brave soul. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Fernald explained that a submarine threat was looming. Suddenly, a mine exploded near the ship, causing panic. Despite the chaos, the Dutch skipper worked diligently to lower lifeboats. Some passengers needed help, and the sailors bravely jumped into the cold water to assist. The situation was dire as the liner began to sink rapidly. The sailors had to act swiftly to save as many lives as possible.|['1.

Seaman Streeter, a hero in the tragedy at sea, saved several lives before mysteriously disappearing. Despite the valiant efforts to find him, he was not located. His selfless act of rescue was not forgotten, as his orphaned sister in Iowa received heartfelt recognition from the Navy Department and a touching letter from Lieutenant-Commander David Darrin. The rescue operation continued, with the rescued being transferred to shore for medical attention. Darrin emphasized the importance of saving every innocent life and ensuring safe navigation paths. As dawn approached, the destroyers were back at sea, ready for more challenging tasks ahead. The story unfolds with mine-sweepers working diligently to prevent further disasters. Despite the dangers and losses, the crew remained determined to protect lives and ships at sea.|"['1.

In the sky, a small English dirigible approached, recognized as a 'blimp' by Fernald. The crew prepared the anti-aircraft gun, but as the dirigible passed over, friendly waves were exchanged with men on board. The crew discussed the importance of aircraft in detecting submerged submarines. As they neared a shoal, a smoke bomb was released from the dirigible, indicating a lurking submarine below. The crew prepared to drop depth bombs to neutralize the threat. The submarine attempted to release a mine, but the crew's swift action, aided by the dirigible, thwarted the attack. The mine was safely disarmed, and the area secured. The collaboration between aircraft and surface vessels proved crucial in safeguarding against submarine threats.|"['1.

The submarine was in distress after the contact bombs exploded, letting water in at multiple points. The crew of the enemy submarine was drowning without a chance to save themselves. Darry urged for calm, wanting to observe without drawing attention. The crew used gasoline for their engines, not hot air engines. Dave was fascinated by the workings of the craft and how efficiently it covered the sea. The submarine successfully disabled an enemy destroyer's rudder with a single shot, rendering it helpless. The crew managed to capture the enemy vessel with the help of two destroyers. The crew skillfully handled a dangerous mine found in the water. Mr. Hartley explained the deadly nature of the mine's studs and how it could cause catastrophic damage if detonated.|"['1.

Dave calmly praised the quick action of the helmsman for steering away from danger. He acknowledged how close they had come to disaster but showed no fear. Mr. Hartley emphasized the importance of retrieving the mines to prevent harm to other ships. Despite the rough seas, the crew continued their mine-sweeping mission diligently. Dave planned to return to the area the next day to clear more mines. As the weather worsened, safety precautions were taken on the ship, with life-lines and life-belts being worn by all.

"As he struggled in the water, Darrin caught a glimpse of a sailor battling the waves towards him. The wave carried him forward, lifting him over the rail into the sea. Darrin stayed calm, knowing his belt would bring him back up for air. As he cleared the spray from his eyes, he saw the ship ""Grigsby"" in the distance before it disappeared in the waves. After a while, he spotted a faint shape that he hoped was the ship returning for him. Despite the difficulty of being seen in the dark, he hoped his friend Dalzell on the ship would notice him.

Dave was on a ship battling a headwind when a face appeared above the rail. He was dragged along with the hull but refused to let go.

"Dave had already expressed his gratitude to the hospital staff and bid them farewell. The two young naval officers then left the hospital and headed towards the waterfront. They soon boarded the ""Grigsby"" and informed the watch officer of their arrival. Dave noticed that the damaged forward gun had been replaced after the fight with German destroyers. They proceeded to the chart-room where Dave examined two papers that caught his attention. One document listed ships that had encountered mines in the area they were operating in. The other report detailed the sinking of a fighting submarine and a submarine mine-layer. Dave shared his observations with his fellow officers, suggesting the need for mine-sweepers to clear the mines on three specific shoals. He then met with a British admiral to discuss the situation further and secured three patrol boats equipped with sweepers.

Dan, through night glasses, spotted a dangerous transfer of mines between two craft. Relieved to see his friend approaching, Dan knew German treachery could be at play.

Dave, aware of the crew's fears, assured them they would be treated as prisoners of war, not harmed.

Darrin explained that dropping bombs from an airship on submarines required precision to ensure a direct hit. On the destroyer, Dave prepared for another attack, successfully destroying the submarine. The blimp reported a suspicious steamer, prompting caution due to potential anti-aircraft threats. Despite the haze, the blimp's movements were closely monitored from the destroyer. Threatened by armed assailants, Darrin bravely faced the danger without drawing his weapon. Ensign Peters maneuvered the launch to safety, despite the hail of bullets. The situation escalated as the attackers demanded the destroyer to leave.

Dave quickly glanced at the deceased man but had no time to spare. He blew a long whistle and rang the fire bell, signaling to abandon ship.

Dave, speaking to Lieutenant Fernald, shared his suspicions about a potential prank by the admiral due to the unusual orders they received. The boat headed for the destroyer where they met a British naval staff officer concerned about German submarines in the waters.

Shivering, Dave stood by, getting reports from the leadsmen in the two compartments. The canvas patches were giving way to the water pressure, and no more patches could be added.
