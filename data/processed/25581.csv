Once upon a time in the Kingdom of Rinkitink, near the vast Nonestic Ocean, lived King Kitticut, a ruler of Pingaree. This island, shaped like a green wedge, was adorned with lush trees and cozy houses where the inhabitants dwelled. The island was rich in pearls, found within large oysters in the ocean's waters. Once a year, King Kitticut sent boats laden with pearls to the Kingdom of Rinkitink for trade. Pingaree's people, peaceful pearl-fishers, had once bravely defended their land from fierce warriors of Regos and Coregos, driving them back to the sea. King Kitticut, now older and wiser, feared another invasion from his enemies.

King Kitticut's concern for the safety of Pingaree led him to keep a vigilant watch for unfamiliar boats, with a guard patrolling the beach. However, he was wise enough not to let fear overshadow the happiness of his people. He, along with his Queen Garee and their son, Prince Inga, lived contentedly in their palace. The prosperity of Pingaree grew each year, bringing joy to its inhabitants. Prince Inga, despite his young age, was diligent and responsible. He had a keen eye for finding pearls along the coast and was skilled in pearl diving. Although there was no formal education on the island, King Kitticut taught his son basic literacy and numeracy from manuscript books. Inga would study in a secluded grove, perched on a tree platform, absorbing the knowledge written on sheepskin pages. King Kitticut, recognizing his son's potential, began to involve Inga in matters of state, preparing him to one day rule Pingaree.

"Inga declared, ""The people of Regos and Coregos will not enslave us. I intend to free my parents and all my people, bringing them back to Pingaree."" Rinkitink chuckled, finding Inga's audacity amusing. He praised Inga's determination but noted their lack of strength. Rinkitink proposed going to his City of Gilgad, where Inga would be honored and taught to be good. Inga made a bargain, suggesting a rowing challenge to Gilgad. If Rinkitink succeeded, Inga would go willingly; if not, they would go to Regos. After preparing the boat with supplies, including oysters for Rinkitink, they embarked. It was a challenge to get Bilbil, the clumsy goat, aboard, but they managed. Finally, they were ready to start their voyage."|"['1.

The King and Inga rowed towards Gilgad, singing a merry tune. Despite the King's initial struggle, Inga effortlessly took over and the boat glided swiftly through the water. As they left Pingaree behind, the purple waters of the Nonestic Ocean surrounded them. Inga rowed tirelessly, even setting up a canopy to shield them from the sun. Rinkitink, ever jolly, sang whimsical songs to keep their spirits up. Bilbil, the goat, remained skeptical of the King's singing talents.

King Rinkitink and the goat shared a merry moment, laughing heartily. Prince Inga, focused on rowing the boat towards the islands of Regos and Coregos, paid little attention to their banter. He pondered his strategy against his enemies, realizing a direct battle was impractical. However, with faith in the Magic Pearls, Inga believed they would safeguard him. As the boat swiftly approached the islands, Inga observed the stark contrast between Regos and Coregos. Regos, ruled by King Gos, harbored mines worked by enslaved captives. On the other hand, Coregos flourished with fertile lands. A bridge of boats connected the two islands, facilitating trade and travel. Inga's resolve to protect his companions from the impending danger grew stronger as they neared the treacherous shores.|"[""1.

The natives of Regos and Coregos were divided into warriors and trembling servants. King Gos and Queen Cor were feared and hated by others for their cruelty. After a victorious raid on Pingaree, a feast was held to celebrate the plunder. King Gos then sent the captured Pingaree men to work in the mines and the women and children to the fields. The islanders thought they had seen the last of Pingaree until a boat arrived carrying an unexpected trio: a boy, a fat man, and a goat. The warriors were puzzled by their arrival. Prince Inga boldly challenged the warriors, claiming to have powerful magic. Despite their laughter, Inga, Rinkitink, and the goat advanced fearlessly, protected by unseen forces.

In the land of Regos, a fierce battle loomed as the warriors prepared to attack Inga, King Rinkitink, and Bilbil. Arrows and spears were launched at them, but a mysterious power from the Pink Pearl shielded them, causing the weapons to bounce harmlessly away. Bilbil, the goat, enraged by the attacks, charged at the warriors, causing chaos and fear among them. The warriors, confused and frightened, fled back to the city, with their leader Buzzub tumbling in defeat. Despite the gates being barred and the walls armed, Inga's strength, aided by the Blue Pearl's magic, easily broke through the city gates. King Gos, astonished by the display of power, had no choice but to surrender as Inga and his companions triumphed without striking a single blow.|"[""1.

King Gos and his warriors were terrified by the small boy, fat man, and goat who easily conquered their city. Despite all their warfare experience, they couldn't harm the trio. The wicked King fled in fear as Prince Inga calmly advanced. The warriors, like their master, abandoned the city, fleeing to the Island of Coregos. The citizens, long abused by the warriors, rejoiced at their defeat. Inga and King Rinkitink took possession of the palace, sharing a bedroom for safety. They dined in splendor, with Rinkitink praising Inga's bravery and magic. The joyful King turned the battle into a joke, amazed at Inga's power.

After dinner, they explored the palace filled with treasures stolen by King Gos. Tired, they retired early. The boy, preparing for bed, planned to search for his family from Pingaree. The next morning, eager to start the search, Inga woke to find one shoe, holding the Pink Pearl, missing. Rinkitink admitted throwing something at a cat outside, possibly the shoe. In despair, Inga realized the lost shoe held their protective magic. They searched but couldn't find it. Inga confided the pearl's power to Rinkitink.

With heavy hearts, they returned to the palace. In a secluded room, away from prying eyes and ears, the boy held the White Pearl to his ear, seeking guidance. Heeding advice, Inga cautioned Rinkitink not to reveal the loss of the shoes and their powers. A new pair of red leather shoes was crafted for Inga by the shoemaker of King Gos. Accompanied by the King, Inga walked through the city, receiving bows from the people. While some feared his strength, others bowed in respect. Inga refrained from using his powers and focused on governing Regos with kindness. Meanwhile, the former King's followers, too afraid to return, plotted on the neighboring island. Unbeknownst to Inga, a charcoal-burner named Nikobob found the lost shoes, unaware of their significance. As he journeyed home, he encountered the fearsome Choggenmugger, a beast dreaded by all in Regos.

The boy desperately offered the girl his shoes, promising wealth and granting any wish. Queen Cor, enraged over a delay, entered to find Inga with Zella. She attempted to strike Inga, but he wore the shoe, and her blows fell futile. Inga then faced the Queen, calmly seizing her whip. As the Queen attacked with a dagger, Inga smiled, the blade bouncing off him. Queen Cor, realizing Inga's power, feared her reign's end. Inga freed the Pingaree slaves, reuniting families. Queen Cor fled, colliding with Bilbil. Rinkitink and Bilbil rejoined Inga. Inga sought his missing mother, finding only her scarf. The search for Queen Garee began across Coregos, but she remained elusive.|"['1.

When they got back to Queen Cor's palace, Rinkitink found out that the bridge of boats had been taken away again, separating them from Regos. They suspected Queen Cor had fled to her husband's island with Queen Garee. Inga was confused about what to do. They returned to the palace to discuss. Zella was upset because she couldn't sell her honey to return to her parents on Regos. Inga comforted her and promised protection until she could go home. Rinkitink found Queen Cor's purse and gave Zella gold for the honey. Inga ordered a feast and beds for the women and children of Pingaree. They talked about rescuing King Kitticut first for his army. Zella suggested going by boat along Regos' shore to avoid conflict. They planned to leave the next morning. Zella cooked dinner and breakfast for Inga and Rinkitink.

Once more, they boarded the boat and sailed along the winding coastline towards the south until they believed they had found the correct spot. As night fell, after a day spent searching for the mines' entrance, Zella advised them to spend the night on the boat to avoid the wild beasts on land. Unaware of the cunning plans of Queen Cor and King Gos, they anchored in a bay, enjoying dinner and lively conversation under the stars. Zella shared her simple history, praising her hardworking father. Rinkitink entertained them with a song, despite Bilbil's protests.

The report worried the boy, not for himself, but for his father. He hurried into the mines, passing through guards without resistance. In the depths, they found slaves toiling for gold under the watchful eyes of cruel guards. Inga searched for his father among the captives from Pingaree but found no trace. Undeterred, he pressed on, breaking chains and freeing the oppressed. The guards, fearing his strength, dared not challenge him. Inga rallied the liberated slaves, organizing them for a march to Regos. Despite initial reluctance, Zella joined them for safety. Returning to Regos, Inga met with Captain Buzzub, learning of Queen Cor's fearful actions. The warriors, uneasy at Inga's return, stood aside, allowing him to proceed without hindrance.|"[""1.

Cor explained to Gos the plan to prevent Prince Inga from using his magic to harm them. She suggested taking Inga's parents, the King and Queen of Pingaree, to the Nome Kingdom for protection. Gos agreed and quickly went to the mines to fetch the King. Meanwhile, Cor prepared a boat with gold and jewels to bribe the nomes. They swiftly departed with the King and Queen as captives. Inga, determined to rescue his parents, promised to find them wherever they were taken. Upon arrival in Regos, Zella's parents were relieved to see her safe.

The charcoal-burner earnestly pleaded to forget the promise, fearing that becoming rich would make him a target for thieves and marauders. King Rinkitink acknowledged the wisdom in the charcoal-burner's words and sought his counsel in the emergency. Nikobob, the charcoal-burner, emphasized the joy of living unnoticed and unknown. Prince Inga appointed Captain Buzzub to lead the warriors and allowed King Gos's former slaves to return to their countries. Inga's people were instructed to rebuild their homes and await the return of King Kitticut or Prince Inga. Nikobob skillfully directed the restoration of Pingaree, and Inga ensured that the island was refurnished with goods taken back from King Gos and Queen Cor's palaces.

King Kaliko, the ruler of the nomes, approved of the treasures brought to him by King Gos. The prisoners turned out to be the King and Queen of Pingaree, who were captured for their evil intentions. Despite being sympathetic towards the prisoners, King Kaliko decided to keep them in his underground caverns for safekeeping, as a show of loyalty to King Gos. The Nome King was well-informed and candid, stating that he preferred dealing with the strong rather than the weak. King Kitticut of Pingaree tried to argue for his release, but Kaliko remained firm in his decision. The prisoners were given a good supper and freed from their chains by a nome named Klik, who locked their door, providing them a sense of relief from their previous captivity under King Gos.|"[""1.

In the royal cavern of King Gos and Queen Cor, a feast was laid out to celebrate their successful plot. They reveled with the Nome King until late at night. The next day, they left for the shore where their boat was anchored, cautioning Kaliko not to release the prisoners without their orders. Inga, guided by the White Pearl, pursued the boat of King Gos, reaching the Wheeler Country shore a day after their arrival. The rowers guarded Queen Cor's barge but did not reveal the prisoners' location. The White Pearl advised Inga to follow the path to the nome caverns. Reluctant Rinkitink, carried by Bilbil, accompanied Inga. They hid from Gos and Cor, who passed by without noticing them.

Bilbil felt proud of his achievement, and Rinkitink found the Nome King's appearance amusing. However, Kaliko was clearly upset as he struggled to fix his crown after the incident. Inga sensed the King's anger and worried it would turn him against them. The Nome King ordered repairs and a new crown. As they waited, Kaliko's scowl made Inga uneasy. When the new crown arrived, Kaliko led them to a balcony overlooking a vast cave filled with armed nomes. Kaliko blew a whistle, summoning the nomes to display their military power. Afterward, he returned them to his chamber and warned Inga of his formidable army. Despite the warning, Inga remained determined to free his parents.

Rinkitink and Inga, determined to free King Kitticut and Queen Garee, sought advice from the White Pearl but received vague counsel to be patient, brave, and determined.

Despite encountering countless nomes, they couldn't find Inga's parents' location. Lost in the maze, Klik guided them back. In the night, Inga heard a grating sound and found himself locked in.

In three newly carved caverns, Inga felt a sense of solitude as he explored. In the third cavern, he hesitated at a dark corridor but decided to press on. Suddenly, a steel door sealed his exit, and he found himself chained in a circular room. Using his strength from the Blue Pearl, Inga broke free and confronted a giant with fiery eyes in the cave. The giant, a hairy monster, posed a grave threat. Inga, realizing his physical disadvantage, used a heavy iron post to strike the giant, rendering it motionless. As the giant fell, the room darkened, and Inga cautiously retreated. The floor collapsed behind him, revealing a deep chasm. Inga narrowly escaped a perilous fall, saved by his quick reflexes.|['1.

By the light of a match, Inga saw an opening across the cave. He thought he could leap over the gulf with the strength from the Blue Pearl. Inga felt one powerful jump might get him to safety. He ran through the cave and corridor, then leaped over the dark gulf. He landed safely on the ledge. In the next cavern, he faced a blazing furnace of coals. Inga couldn't go back or leap over the coals. He thought hard and found a solution. He tore rocks from the wall to create stepping-stones over the coals.

A magical breakfast appeared, and Klik summoned the King to see King Kaliko.

Dorothy expressed her gratitude to the Ruler of Oz and bid her farewell, as she was eager to set off immediately. She found the Wizard of Oz planting shoe-trees in the garden and shared Inga's story with him. The Wizard gladly agreed to join Dorothy on the journey to the Nome King's caverns, as they had conquered the nomes before without difficulty and were unafraid. The cheerful Wizard, with his bald head and winning smile, harnessed the Wooden Sawhorse to the Red Wagon and loaded Ozma's Magic Carpet. Together, they swiftly traversed the Land of Oz to the edge of the Deadly Desert using the Magic Carpet. Upon reaching the Nome King's dominions, they approached the entrance to the nomes' caverns. Dorothy carried a basket of eggs, a powerful weapon against the nomes, who fear eggs as it can strip them of their immortality. Inga was determined to free his captive parents, despite the Nome King's resistance. As they prepared to face the challenges ahead, Klik rushed in to alert them of Dorothy and the Wizard's arrival, causing concern among their group.|"['1.

"Dorothy reassured her companions, ""I know all about your troubles and have come to help you and King Rinkitink. King Kaliko, you should be ashamed of treating these honest rulers so poorly."" Dorothy demanded the King and Queen of Pingaree be brought to them immediately. The Nome King argued, but Dorothy stood her ground, insisting on reuniting the family. The emotional reunion of the King and Queen of Pingaree with their son, Inga, moved everyone. The Wizard revealed that Bilbil the goat was actually the Prince of Boboland under a powerful enchantment. The group decided to seek Glinda's help in breaking the spell in the Land of Oz. They bid farewell to King Kaliko and returned to Oz, where they were warmly welcomed by Ozma and prepared for a grand banquet.

Bilbil finally agreed to Glinda and the Wizard's experiments to break the evil magician's spell on Prince Bobo. Glinda, a powerful sorceress, transformed Bilbil into a lamb and then an ostrich but failed to restore Prince Bobo. She eventually succeeded in turning the ostrich into a tottenhot and then a mifket before transforming him back into Prince Bobo. The banquet awaited them, where Bobo, now a prince again, joined in. Rinkitink, seeing his goat turned prince, felt a mix of emotions. The group enjoyed the feast with Ozma, the Shaggy Man, Jack Pumpkinhead, and others. King Rinkitink found the animal guests amusing, especially Hank the mule, and sang a comical song about him. The gathering was joyful, with everyone celebrating the restoration of Prince Bobo and the reunion of friends.|"['1.

On a certain day, they bid farewell to their friends in Oz and embarked on a journey. They crossed the Deadly Desert safely on a Magic Carpet, passed through the Nome Kingdom and Wheeler Country without any trouble, and reached the shores of the Nonestic Ocean. There, they found the boat with a silver lining undisturbed on the beach. As they arrived at the pearl kingdom, they were astonished by the island's transformation. All the houses were rebuilt, more beautiful than before, with green lawns and flower gardens. King Kitticut's new palace stood tall and magnificent, a testament to the hard work of Nikobob. Impressed by Nikobob's efforts, King Kitticut appointed him Lord High Chamberlain and entrusted him with the pearl fisheries and island kingdom's affairs. The group settled comfortably in the new palace, with King Rinkitink enjoying his stay and spreading joy with his merry disposition.|['1.
