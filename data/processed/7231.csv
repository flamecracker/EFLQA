I miss you terribly in this cold, proper country. If only I could run to you now! I long to return to the mountains, the sea, and our old house.

Please give my love to everyone, especially Hannah Croneen, little Mike, Bridget Murphy, Squire Murphy, and all who remember Nora O'Shanaghgan. My heart yearns for our native soil more than anything. I am becoming restless and wild; my heart bleeds. I've written a proper letter to Mother but pouring my true feelings to you. Call for me if you need me, and I'll come flying back.

Two young girls were about to embark on a journey. Mrs. Terry, a kind-hearted woman, made sure they had supper before their departure. She promised to wake them early and ensure they caught the morning train from Euston. Mrs. Terry accompanied them to the station, guiding them through the shortest routes.

The Irish girl joyfully exclaimed, “I'm home again!” as she walked on the platform. She praised the Irish accent and urged her friend to speak to an old man selling apples. The man, nearly blind, wished them well. Nora, the Irish girl, believed her presence would help her weak father. As they boarded the train, Nora expressed gratitude to her uncle and praised his country. The slow Irish train meandered along, stopping for a stray animal on the tracks. Nora's return home was met with warmth by the station guard. Upon arrival, a luxurious carriage awaited, upsetting Nora, who expected the old car.

"The Squire's face glowed with color, his eyes sparkled, and his voice regained strength. Squire Murphy, standing close, patted his shoulder. Nora, kneeling by her father's bed, kept her face turned from her mother, tears in her eyes but gratitude in her heart. She knew she did right. The men-servants and Dr. Talbot appeared, ready to assist. The Irish groom, Angus, and Hannah Croneen joined Nora. Dr. Talbot, after examining the patient, suggested fresh air and natural care. The Squire insisted on it, dismissing the doctor's treatment. Mrs. O'Shanaghgan left, followed by others. Squire Murphy exclaimed, ""Routed!"" and offered his last bottle of potheen.

About a week after moving to the barn, Nora was out late alone. She had been collecting seaweeds and shells by the seashore when she heard her name whispered behind her. Startled, she turned to see a ragged man grabbing her arm and pulling her into the underwood. Despite her fear, Nora bravely confronted him. The man, Andy, pleaded his desperate situation, claiming hunger and rejection by the community. Nora, once sympathetic, now felt betrayed by his actions. Andy, driven to extremes, insisted it was his turn for power. As he dragged her further into the underwood, Nora, though strong, realized she was no match for his brute force.|['1.

Nora was filled with worry after her encounter with Andy Neil. She knew his desperate state and the dangerous threats he made. Andy, driven by hunger and misery, demanded Nora to convince the Squire to let him return to his small cabin. Nora understood Andy's fierce nature and the potential danger he posed.

The Squire of Castle O'Shanaghgan was a generous man, loved by many, but his hard side had emerged when dealing with tenants like Andy Neil. Andy, evicted by the Squire, sought revenge after losing his home and children. In a failed attempt on the Squire's life, Andy wounded him and now threatened fresh harm. Only Nora suspected Andy's intentions but struggled with the decision to involve the police to protect her father.

Nora had a plan forming in her mind as she got ready the next morning. She considered giving Andy permission to return to his cabin. However, she knew it wouldn't be easy as the evicted cabins were guarded to prevent tenants from going back. Despite this, she decided to visit Andy's cabin to assess the situation. Nora felt a bit relieved with this decision and rushed downstairs. Her uncle was leaving for England, and the carriage was waiting. Nora's mother was upset with her late arrival, but her uncle understood her Irish spirit. Nora thanked him for letting Molly stay and promised to take care of her. She expressed her gratitude and love for her father to her uncle. Nora asked her uncle to convey a special message to her Aunt Grace, explaining that her actions were for her father's sake.

Nora and Molly set out early that morning towards Slieve Nagorna. They reached the foot of the mountain, where Nora tied Black Bess to a nearby tree. The girls began their climb, with Nora moving swiftly while Molly struggled to keep up. As they ascended, they came across the remains of a small cabin. Nora reminisced about the past when the cabin was a home filled with warmth and family. Molly found the desolate place eerie and couldn't imagine anyone calling it home. Nora expressed her desire to rebuild the cabin and bring back the man who once lived there. Despite the hardships he faced, Nora believed he deserved peace. As they turned to leave, Nora mentioned her plan to visit John Finnigan in the village.|"['1.

Nora swiftly descended the mountain, with Molly following closely behind. Black Bess remained still as Nora dismounted and rushed to the village with Molly. Luckily, they found John Finnigan there. Nora left Molly with Black Bess and entered the modest Irish-style house where Mrs. Finnigan greeted her warmly. Inside, Nora found the children having a messy breakfast. Despite the chaos, Nora felt at ease with the family. After some time, Finnigan joined Nora in his study. He expressed his frustrations about losing his job to a Scottish steward. Nora urged Finnigan to return Andy's cabin, but he hesitated, fearing it would affect his chances of regaining his position. Disheartened by Finnigan's response, Nora returned to the Castle deep in thought.|"['1.

Molly was instructed to entertain her father in the barn while Nora and Angus discussed a plan. The Squire, now recovering, enjoyed Molly's stories and declined her offer to read the paper. Nora, with a determined look, entered the room and assured her father that she would be busy that day. The Squire, teasingly, said he could manage without her, as her mother would keep him company. Nora and Angus made plans to make the barn more comfortable for a visitor. Angus suggested using the white pony and a tarpaulin to create a cozy space.

Nora instructed Hannah to pack provisions, including potatoes, bacon, and a bottle of potheen. They also needed fagots, turf, and a blanket for their trip. With everything set, Nora, Molly, Angus, and Hannah set off in a cart with a pony. Molly enjoyed the bumpy ride, but Nora was up to something secretive. They met John Finnigan but managed to pass without suspicion. Upon reaching the foot of Slieve Nagorna, the pony couldn't pull the cart uphill, so they loaded the tarpaulin on the pony's back and climbed the mountain. At Andy's cabin site, they set up a temporary shelter with a fire, food, and blankets. Nora planned for Andy to stay there. Later that evening, Nora went to the shore to meet Andy, but he didn't show up. She feared John Finnigan's interference and called out for Andy in vain.|"['1.

The Squire mentioned feeling sleepy and ready for bed, with his son Angus helping him. Nora, his daughter, hid her worry behind tiredness. She asked the cook for a basket of food and a bottle of brandy. She kissed the cook's forehead and left for her room to change her clothes. Nora then sneaked out of the house late at night, avoiding Molly, to embark on a mysterious mission. She fed the dogs, left through a window, and found herself on the lawn.

Nora disliked anything that reminded her of the English and their customs. She felt rebellious, wondering why her Irish land and people couldn't be left in their wild freedom. She sneaked into the yard, where the moonlight allowed her to see clearly. Sitting in the barn's shadow, she was ready to stay all night to protect her father. Nora was determined to prevent any harm from reaching her father, even if it meant facing the dangerous Andy Neil. She trusted in God and believed she was doing the right thing. Although she had secured the yard, she suspected Andy might be hiding there. Nora listened to the old clock strike midnight, thinking about the Banshee from her family's folklore.

Nora had a mix of thoughts, but she felt comfort in knowing that Someone was watching over her. As she heard her father in bed, she felt like his guardian angel. Suddenly, a soft footfall caught her attention, making her alert. The night was quiet, the sky dark, and the stars shining. Nora sensed danger approaching her father.
