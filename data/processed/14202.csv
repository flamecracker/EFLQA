Susy Parlin's story could start on New Year's Day, but Christmas is too special to skip. The charm of Christmas brings to mind a shining fir tree with candles and toys, a jolly Santa Claus with gifts, and a waxen angel known as the Christ-child. The three Parlin sisters, Susy, Prudy, and Alice, eagerly dream of presents. Susy is clever and full of ideas, with eyes like the evening sky. Prudy has sunny features and a small mouth, while Alice, called Dotty, is round with dimples. Dotty is quiet but expressive, using signs before she started talking. Aunt Madge visits, and the girls rely on her wisdom for Christmas plans. Susy works on a secret project, making a lamp mat for Auntie. However, secrets are hard to keep from Prudy, who struggles to hold them like a sieve holds water. So, special hours are set for Susy and her cousin Florence to work on gifts undisturbed in Aunt Madge's chamber.|"['1. What does the charm of Christmas bring to mind for the Parlin sisters?\nA.

Prudy remembered at the last minute to give Susy a piece of candy she saved for her. Susy received many gifts, including a bottle of rose otto, which made her feel like a young lady. Percy gave her a mysterious gift that she couldn't open until the next morning. Susy was excited about the surprise. Prudy, on the other hand, was scared of the horses on the slippery streets. Mr. Parlin surprised Susy with a black pony, and she rode it joyfully. Susy planned to share rides with a girl named Jessie. Prudy, envious of Susy's attention, wished for a sore throat like Susy's to wear a compress too. Susy's gift of a pony led to thoughts of needing a stable, saddle, and sleigh for the pony.|"['1.

Susy was filled with excitement during the holidays. She dreamed of her pony, Wings, being able to fly like a magical creature into the clouds. She imagined building a grand castle on the moon and returning home each night. Susy's joy was infectious as she raced Wings through the countryside, leaving her sister, Prudy, in a mix of fear and excitement. Despite the playful banter about names for the pony, Susy was content with her choice of Wings. She even wished Wings had a soul so he could be christened like a baby.

Susy was thrilled with the story her aunt Madge had shared about the fountain of Pirene gushing from a hillside. Her imagination soared to the other end of the world where Pegasus and Bellerophon, with his magical bridle, rode a white horse with silvery wings named Helicon. Flossy, however, dismissed fairy tales, preferring her doll Queen Mab. Susy defended her preference for living things like canary birds and babies. When Grandma Read cautioned against washing canaries, Susy insisted on bathing her birdie gay. Despite the bird's resistance, Susy gently bathed him, cooing and comforting him throughout. The scene unfolded in the kitchen as Grandma Read starched her cap, Susy tended to her canary, and Flossy fussed over Queen Mab, showcasing the different preferences and interactions of the characters.|"['1.

"""Look, mom, there he is, shaking out his feathers, all bright and happy again. O, you cunning little Dandy, now we'll hang you up in the sun to dry. See him hop on one foot; that is just to make me laugh,"" exclaimed Mrs. Parlin, patting Prudy's curls. ""This is a droll little head for fancies,"" she continued, looking at grandma Read. ""Do you know, mother, that for several days she has made believe she was lame Jessie, and has hobbled about whenever she could think of it.""

""O, no, mother,"" said Mrs. Parlin, smiling, as Prudy limped out of the room. ""I have examined her knee, and there is nothing the matter with it. She is only imitating that lame child. You know Prudy has all sorts of whims. Don't you know how she has wanted us to call her Jessie sometimes?""

""Why, no, indeed, grandma, she isn't lame,"" said Susy, laughing. ""Sometimes she will run about the room as well as I do, and then, in a few minutes, when she thinks of it, she will limp and take hold of chairs.

Mothers have a special bond with their children, willing to endure any suffering to protect them. Mrs. Parlin felt this deeply when her daughter Prudy fell ill. The doctor restricted Prudy's activities, making her stay still and quiet. Despite her restlessness, Prudy understood her mother's worry.

Susy, the young girl, sat by the window, feeling comforted by her grandmother's words. As she listened, the sadness on her face faded, replaced by a hint of a smile.

Susy, Prudy's sister, tried to entertain her during the day, cutting paper dolls and playing with her. Susy was fearless and skilled at ice skating.

Susy was a lively child who loved outdoor adventures, climbing trees and ladders with ease. Her aunt disapproved of her wild ways, but Susy thrived in the fresh air, collecting wild roses for her cheeks. Despite her love for outdoor activities, Susy also enjoyed reading fairy tales and Rollo's Travels. However, when her younger sister Prudy fell ill, Susy had to give up her beloved hobbies to care for her. Initially selfless, Susy found it challenging to sacrifice her pony rides, skating, and reading time to be with Prudy, who demanded constant attention and entertainment. Prudy, unaccustomed to being sick, struggled with patience and often demanded immediate assistance with her playthings and imagined ailments. Despite her mother's reminders to be patient and trust in God's love, Prudy questioned why she was sick if God truly cared for her.|"['1.

The splint for Prudy's wounded limb was crafted from sturdy wood and brass, secured with plaster strips that needed daily tightening. Mrs. Parlin used a key to wind up the plaster without causing Prudy any discomfort. Meanwhile, Susy showed kindness by dressing Dotty's doll simply but with care, despite its ragged appearance. Susy, learning a lesson in patience, later tended to Dandy, a bird she cherished deeply. Unfortunately, Dandy passed away, leaving Susy heartbroken. Amid her grief, her cousin Percy arrived to take her for a promised sleigh ride, but Susy, devastated by Dandy's death, found no joy in the outing. Percy's teasing about the bird's demise only added to Susy's sorrow, leading her to express her pain through a heartfelt poem.|"[""1.

Percy, a lively boy, hid his tender emotions well. Susy, feeling sorrowful, barely noticed the beauty of the day. After a stormy ride, Percy surprised Susy by carrying the cage into his home. Susy rejected the idea of stuffing Dandy, her pet. Later, neighbor Annie Lovejoy joined Susy and her friends for a game.
