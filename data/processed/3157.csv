In 1815, a period of peace finally emerged after twenty-two years of relentless war. Across the globe, from the forests of Canada to the pampas of South America, the impact of war was deeply felt. People everywhere yearned for lasting peace, leading to a shared desire among rulers and subjects to prevent future conflicts. Two prominent figures, Czar Alexander I of Russia and Prince Metternich of Austria, took the lead in advocating for peace. Metternich, in particular, aimed not only to prevent war but also to restore autocratic rule to maintain order. However, the spirit of liberty that had emerged from the French Revolution continued to stir unrest among the populace. In the Americas, revolutions spread, leading to the birth of new republics and a shift towards democratic governance. This wave of change challenged the traditional notion of Divine Right and set the stage for a clash between absolutism and democracy, with England caught in the middle. George Canning, the English foreign minister, championed the cause of freedom, seeking to balance the powers of Europe and support the independence of the American republics.|['1.

On October 9, 1823, a significant proposal arrived in Washington. The response was to be crafted by skilled and experienced statesmen. President James Monroe, with a long history of public service, was at the helm. He had served in various diplomatic roles, showing early signs of impatience and independent thinking. Over time, he matured and earned respect for his character and leadership. John Quincy Adams, the Secretary of State, stood out for his exceptional abilities. Despite his unconventional demeanor, Adams was a master of diplomacy and international law. He was honest, dedicated, and had a deep belief in American principles and potential. Adams opposed an alliance with England, fearing it could compromise American interests and values. He envisioned natural expansion of American territories over time, without outside interference. Adams believed in America's strength and greatness, standing firm against pressures that could undermine its sovereignty and future.|"['1.

Cooperating with England posed risks, but they seemed minor compared to the threat of absolutist armies and navies in the New World or a French Cuba and Russian Mexico. President Monroe and Thomas Jefferson supported accepting Canning's proposal to detach England from Europe, as the British Navy was the main defense against foreign intervention. Adams argued that England was already detached and the British Navy protected America regardless of its stance. Rejecting England's assistance would be foolish. The President's message to Congress declared the US's stance against European intervention, offering compensation by abstaining from European affairs. Adams believed in creating a separate sphere for American interests, rejecting interference in Europe. The Monroe Doctrine, based on Adams's policy, shaped American foreign relations, emphasizing self-determination and non-interference.|"[""1.

In the early days of the United States, it became clear that the nation could not ignore the affairs of its neighboring countries. The events in nearby nations had a significant impact on American life and limited the country's independence. As early as 1780, it was predicted that the United States would need to take a more active role in Cuban affairs. Over the years, American policies evolved to ensure the country's independence and security. The Monroe Doctrine, established in 1823, aimed to keep European influence out of the Americas. While the methods have changed, the core principles of American foreign policy have remained constant. The United States has always sought independence and non-interference in the affairs of other nations. The following chapters will explore how American interests expanded in line with the Monroe Doctrine and the diplomatic challenges faced by Secretaries of State. The relationship between the United States and Great Britain has been marked by both friendship and disputes, with constant controversies that have sometimes brought the two nations to the brink of war.|['1.

In 1841, new leaders took charge in both England and the United States. The English Tories and American Whigs were open to finding common ground. Daniel Webster, the American Secretary of State, took on the responsibility. Known for his worldly wisdom and engaging personality, Webster was a sought-after guest. Lord Ashburton, representing Britain, was chosen for his ties to the U.S. Both men aimed to find a middle ground. They met in Washington, away from the formalities of London. Despite their loyalty to their countries, they sought compromise. Webster's legal expertise was crucial in settling border disputes. The negotiations were amicable, with both sides making concessions. They resolved the Caroline affair and agreed to patrol African waters to curb the slave trade. By compromising and focusing on practical solutions, they successfully settled boundary disputes from Passamaquoddy Bay to the Lake of the Woods.|['1.

The friendly negotiations between Webster and Ashburton marked a time of peace between the United States and England. The U.S. added Texas and Oregon peacefully, expanding its territory but facing transportation challenges due to the Great Plains and the Rockies. With the U.S. now stretching to the Pacific, communication relied heavily on sea routes. To connect the nation, the U.S. sought isthmus routes through Central America, negotiating with nations like New Granada and Mexico. The isthmus route became a key focus of American diplomacy, with Commodore Vanderbilt pushing for the Nicaragua route. However, tensions arose with Britain over control of the route near Belize. Diplomatic clashes ensued, leading to a treaty that aimed for a neutral canal, but ultimately posed challenges for American control.|"['1.

In the mid-1800s, a significant treaty, known as the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty, stirred tension between the United States and Great Britain. It forbade both nations from fortifying or claiming dominion over Central America. This went against the United States' stance of not being on equal terms with European powers in the Americas. Despite efforts by American officials like Webster and later Buchanan, disputes arose, including British support for Confederate commerce raiders. The Fenian Brotherhood's attempt to invade Canada further strained relations. Claims against Britain for losses during the Civil War, including indirect damages, led to demands for substantial compensation. Charles Sumner proposed extreme measures, suggesting Britain cede all of British America to the U.S. to avoid future conflicts. Though not ratified, the treaty continued to complicate relations between the two nations.|"['1.

"During the 1870s, tensions between the United States and Great Britain were high due to disputes like the ""Alabama Claims."" Fortunately, skilled diplomats like Caleb Cushing and John Rose worked towards reconciliation. Despite this, Senator Sumner's opposition hindered progress. President Grant, angered by Sumner's actions, removed him from key positions. Eventually, a Joint High Commission was formed, leading to the Treaty of Washington in 1871. This treaty established a tribunal to address disputes, including the ""Alabama Claims."" The tribunal, held in Geneva, resulted in an award of $15.5 million to the United States.

In the mid-1800s, there was a strong desire for expansion in the United States. People believed that by growing and strengthening the nation, they could attract others to join under the American flag. This idea was not driven by political parties but was a national ideal. Despite some special interests, the core of this expansionist sentiment was not based on their support. The hope was that the happiness and success of the American people would inspire others to adopt similar systems. However, the outbreak of the Civil War put a pause on expansion plans. It wasn't until 1867 that an opportunity arose to purchase Alaska from Russia. Secretary of State Seward negotiated the deal, and after some back and forth, the United States acquired Alaska for $7.2 million. Despite some opposition to expansion, the acquisition of Alaska marked a significant moment in American history.|['1.

The purchase of Alaska for seven million dollars was not solely based on its financial worth, but rather on a sentimental bond between the United States and Russia. Despite the historical political differences between the two nations, a tradition of friendliness existed due to the vast distance separating them. This sentiment was further fueled by Russia's actions during the American Civil War, where it was perceived as siding with the Union against potential threats from Great Britain and France. The purchase of Alaska was seen as a gesture of goodwill towards Russia, influenced by public perception of a secret agreement hinted at by the appearance of Russian fleets in American harbors. This sentiment was also tied to the American public's anger towards British sympathies for the Confederacy. The acquisition of Alaska, the only successful expansion scheme during that period, was seen as a strategic move by Secretary of State Seward, who capitalized on the existing sentiment to secure the purchase. The subsequent management of the seal fishery in Alaska highlighted early conservation efforts by the U.S. government, aimed at preserving the seal herds from overexploitation by foreign sealers. This led to conflicts in the Bering Sea and eventually resulted in diplomatic efforts to protect the fur seal fisheries involving multiple nations.|"['1.

In the late 1800s, the United States and Great Britain faced a diplomatic challenge over Bering Sea. When Canada influenced the negotiations, it complicated matters. Lord Morley noted how Canada's interests affected Britain's decisions. During the talks, the U.S. and Canada had competing interests in the Atlantic fisheries. The Senate was critical of the agreement, leading Britain to withdraw. The change in U.S. leadership from Cleveland to Harrison, and from Bayard to Blaine, brought new dynamics. Blaine, though lacking legal knowledge, had a charismatic presence. He defended U.S. claims over Bering Sea, but faced opposition due to conflicting views on maritime rights. Despite tensions, both nations agreed to arbitration, showcasing their commitment to resolving disputes peacefully. Ultimately, the tribunal ruled in favor of open waters and imposed damages on the U.S. Blaine's efforts led to regulations for seal herd protection, a significant step in international conservation efforts.|"['1.

Between John Quincy Adams and James G. Blaine, the Monroe Doctrine was believed to have halted European territorial expansion in the Americas. The United States was spared constant war preparations and the tension of Europe's power shifts. The British Navy played a crucial role in supporting the Monroe Doctrine. Canning's policy in Europe weakened unity, allowing the United States to resist European influence. During the Civil War, the U.S.'s internal division exposed its vulnerability. European nations like Spain and France eyed American territories. Napoleon III aimed to establish a French-influenced empire in Mexico. General Bernhardi suggested that Britain missed a chance for global dominance. After the Civil War, the U.S. rejected European encroachments, solidifying its international position. The Monroe Doctrine's aim of uniting American nations under U.S. leadership made little progress. The U.S.'s influence waned post-Civil War, while European powers expanded their reach, hinting at potential future challenges.|"['1.

Blaine, once poised to shape foreign policy under President Garfield, faced setbacks due to Garfield's assassination. His vision of American leadership in the Western Hemisphere was evident in his efforts to mediate conflicts between Latin American nations and European powers. Blaine aimed to establish peace and prevent disputes, but his lack of execution hindered success. For instance, his attempt to resolve the Chili-Bolivia-Peru conflict was marred by incompetent agents. Similarly, his proposal to intervene in the France-Venezuela dispute was cut short. Blaine also opposed European influence in the Americas, advocating for American control of the Panama Canal. Despite his efforts, political constraints and opposition thwarted his initiatives. Blaine's legacy lies in his vision for American leadership and influence in international affairs.|"[""1.

Blaine's vision for cooperation among the American republics was a key focus during his time in office. He aimed to unite the nations for common goals without merging them into the Union. Drawing inspiration from historical events like the Panama Congress of 1826, he pushed for a Pan-American Congress to discuss arbitration, trade agreements, and mutual interests. Despite facing challenges and only achieving partial success due to concerns about European relations, Blaine's efforts led to the establishment of the Bureau of American Republics in Washington.

In 1872, an American naval officer struck a deal with the chief of Tutuila, a Samoan Island, for the use of Pago Pago, the prime harbor in the area. This marked the beginning of a closer relationship between the United States and the Samoan people. By 1878, a treaty was established allowing Americans to utilize Pago Pago as a coaling station. The treaty also obliged the U.S. to assist in resolving any disputes between Samoa and other friendly nations. Tensions escalated when Germany sought a similar harbor agreement with Hawaii, leading to naval activities in the region. The Samoans, known for their social customs and minor conflicts, found themselves entangled in the power struggles among the U.S., Germany, and Great Britain. The situation took a dramatic turn in 1884 when the German consul raised their flag in Samoa, sparking a series of events that culminated in a storm ravaging the warships in 1889. The nations involved then cooperated to establish a compromise, resulting in a joint foreign-controlled government in Samoa.|['1.

The events surrounding the Hawaiian Islands in the late 19th century were pivotal in shaping American foreign policy in the Pacific region. The United States, under various administrations, engaged in diplomatic agreements with European powers in the Pacific, creating a new policy for protecting American interests in the region. The proximity of the Hawaiian Islands to the U.S. coast and the historical ties between the two nations led to discussions of annexation. Despite initial attempts at annexation in the mid-1800s, it wasn't until a revolution in 1893 that the U.S. intervened, leading to the establishment of a provisional government. However, President Cleveland later withdrew the annexation treaty, emphasizing non-interference in Hawaii's domestic affairs. This episode highlighted the complex relationship between the United States, European powers, and the Pacific islands during this period.|"[""1.

Grover Cleveland faced significant personal abuse during his presidency, but over time, his integrity and courage won the approval of his countrymen. His firm grasp of administrative duties earned him acclaim as a statesman. Unlike his contemporary Blaine, Cleveland's thoughts were sound and consistent, yet he lacked constructive power and tact, especially in foreign relations. During his first term, he negotiated with Great Britain over the northeastern fisheries issue, reaching a modus vivendi. In his second term, a boundary dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela brought forth a diplomatic challenge. Cleveland took a serious stance, viewing it as a test of the Monroe Doctrine. He urged arbitration with Great Britain but faced challenges due to undiplomatic statements made by his Secretary of State, Richard Olney. Despite this, Cleveland stood firm, emphasizing the importance of maintaining national boundaries and sovereignty.|"[""1.

Perhaps no American document concerning diplomacy has ever caused such a significant reaction worldwide. The unexpectedness of the situation amplified its impact, catching even the United States off guard. Unlike typical Anglo-American diplomacy, this negotiation was long-term, with written exchanges rather than face-to-face meetings. The looming threat of war unsettled the public, causing stock market drops and drawing global attention. The intricate bonds of friendship and interests that would be severed due to a minor boundary dispute made war between the U.S. and Great Britain seem unimaginable. However, as tensions escalated, Germany's actions further complicated matters, leading to a realization of shared interests between Britain and the United States. The British Government initially hesitated to act swiftly, hoping for a delayed resolution until after President Cleveland's term. Ultimately, diplomatic efforts led to a peaceful resolution, emphasizing the importance of maintaining peace and international relations.|"[""1.

In the late 19th century, President Cleveland's approach to foreign policy had a profound impact on the United States. While his actions aimed at peace, they were not mere bluffs. He believed in establishing principles, even at a cost, and used methods he deemed necessary to awaken England to America's strength. Cleveland's diplomacy not only averted war but also fostered a newfound friendship between the two nations. In the U.S., his policies united the country and sparked a serious interest in foreign affairs among the American people. This era saw a shift towards a more nationalistic sentiment, with a growing awareness of America's place in the world. The development of the American Navy and a focus on national defense were central to this evolving sense of American identity.|"[""1.

In the mid-1990s, scholars studying current trends sensed a forthcoming change in national history. The exact nature of this transformation remained uncertain, awaiting a defining moment. While efforts like Blaine's Pan-Americanism fell short, tensions with Great Britain were not enough to alter the peace-seeking trajectory. The nation awaited a crisis that would unite its people and solidify its direction. This pivotal moment emerged in the Caribbean during the Venezuela conflict. Cuba's status had long concerned the U.S., with early hopes of annexation. By the late 1840s, the U.S. shifted towards supporting Cuban independence. The outbreak of revolution in 1868 garnered American sympathy, but intervention was restrained due to past conflicts. The Cuban struggle for freedom deeply resonated with the American public, leading to various forms of support for the insurgents.|"['1.

During the Cuban revolution, the landscape and population played unique roles. The island's mountainous terrain and fertile plains provided perfect hiding spots for insurgents who swiftly attacked and vanished before troops could respond. The number of rebels was small, with many switching between rebellion and peace. The sympathetic majority helped insurgents blend in seamlessly. The Spanish government, despite deploying a large army, struggled to quell the revolution. General Weyler's harsh tactics included starving rebels by destroying crops. This led to the internment of civilians in unsanitary camps, causing widespread suffering. American interests were affected by Spanish actions, sparking resentment. The emergence of modern newspapers, led by Hearst and Pulitzer, ensured the public was well-informed, influencing American reactions and eventually contributing to the Spanish-American War.|"[""1.

President Cleveland followed the lead of Grant and Grant's Secretary, Hamilton Fish. He did not acknowledge Cuba's independence to avoid war with Spain. The U.S. did not even recognize Cuba's belligerency, fearing a repeat of past mistakes. Despite wanting to prevent aid to Cuban insurgents, Cleveland struggled due to lack of formal recognition of war. When McKinley took office, he aimed to free Cuba while maintaining peace with Spain. Negotiations were tense, but McKinley hoped for a peaceful resolution. Spain's new government promised reforms in Cuba, offering hope for progress.

"Public sentiment in the United States was strongly against Spain in 1898. Two significant events fueled this sentiment.

Second, the U.S. battleship Maine exploded in Havana harbor, killing many crew members. Though the cause was unclear, it heightened tensions. The U.S. suspected Spain's involvement.

The negotiation became too intense for the elderly John Sherman, and it was handled by William Rufus Day, an Assistant Secretary and a close friend of the President, though not well-known to the public. When Day officially took over from Sherman on April 26, 1898, he faced intense public scrutiny. He managed the Cuban negotiations, served as Secretary of State from April to September 1898, and was President of the Paris Peace Commission in October. After nine months of significant national service, Day retreated to a quieter role on the United States circuit bench. Despite later becoming a Supreme Court Justice, he never regained national prominence. The Secretary of State sent an ultimatum to General Stewart L. Woodford, the Minister to Spain, on March 27, 1898. The ultimatum included immediate amnesty until October 1, cessation of the reconcentrado policy, and relief for suffering Cubans from the United States. Spain abolished the reconcentrado policy in western Cuba on March 30 and offered to arbitrate issues on the sinking of the Maine. General Woodford indicated Spain's interest in an armistice that didn't imply submission, suggesting intervention by the Pope. However, the U.S. decided to use its fleet as needed. Spain granted amnesty on April 9, following a request from European powers. General Woodford proposed that the U.S. could secure autonomy, independence, or the cession of Cuba.

President McKinley reluctantly decided not to inform Congress about securing American policy acceptance. On April 11th, he recommended using force after reviewing negotiations. Congress then on April 19th urged Spain to withdraw from Cuba and empowered the President to use force if needed. It was declared that Cuba should be free and independent, ruling out other solutions. This reflected the American people's belief in freedom. The resolution was signed on April 20th. Admiral Sampson's fleet blockaded Cuba on April 21st, and war was officially declared on April 25th. The American Navy, though evenly matched with Spain, showed superior personnel. The Navy Secretary appointed a Naval War Board, including Admiral Sicard, Captain Crowninshield, and Captain Mahan. The fleet lacked essential support vessels, and uncertainties about naval warfare lingered. Despite these challenges, American heroism prevailed in the face of untested modern warship technology.|"['1.

While negotiations were ongoing with Spain, a fast vessel departed from San Francisco to Honolulu under Secretary Long's command. The vessel carried essential ammunition for the warship Baltimore, which quickly set sail for Hongkong. This ammunition was crucial for Commodore George Dewey and his Asiatic squadron to engage in the war. Despite receiving the necessary ammunition, the squadron faced a unique predicament. It couldn't obtain supplies or coal from neutral ports without being interned for the war's duration. The only viable option was to act swiftly. The United States Navy Department saw an opportunity in the squadron's proximity to the Spanish Philippines. Commodore Dewey, well-prepared and eager to execute a bold plan, set sail for the Philippines to capture Manila. His strategic move was time-sensitive, as indicated by the swift actions taken by his fleet upon reaching Hongkong. Dewey's squadron, though small by today's standards, proved formidable against the Spanish fleet and harbor defenses.

Dewey, a naval officer, found himself in a risky situation with limited support and a long distance from America. It took two months for reinforcements to arrive. Dewey blockaded Manila, besieged by Filipino insurgents, to distress the enemy and obtain supplies. He was cautioned not to form alliances with Filipino factions. Foreign nations sent warships to the area, causing anxiety at home. The presence of a large German force raised concerns. European sympathy favored Spain, with France heavily invested in Spanish bonds. Austria was tied to Spain through the Austrian Queen Regent. There was a fear in Europe of the economic power of the United States. Germany sought colonies and eyed Spain's territories. The Kaiser expressed interest in the Philippines but was disappointed by Dewey's victory. European powers hoped for peace in the conflict between the US and Spain.|"[""1.

During the tense times leading up to the Spanish-American War, the United States found a crucial ally in Great Britain. Despite initial concerns over Britain's political isolation, the British Government and the public showed strong support for America. The new American Ambassador, John Hay, played a key role in maintaining smooth relations. Both countries shared a deep sentiment for humanity, evident in their responses to global suffering. The British Navy even offered practical assistance to the United States if needed. As tensions escalated in Manila Harbor, the presence of German warships caused unease, but British support for the Americans was unwavering. Ultimately, the war's outcome hinged on the level-headedness of Commodore Dewey and the naval strength of both the United States and Spain.|"[""1.

The primary task of the navy was to safeguard the American coastline. In 1885, the War Department devised a plan for coast defense, but only a fraction of the necessary funds had been allocated by 1898. Mines and torpedoes were deployed at harbor entrances during the outbreak of war, yet there was a shortage of high-power guns. Reports of a potential attack by swift Spanish cruisers kept coastal cities on edge, prompting petitions for naval protection. The Naval War Board had to balance defending the coast and commerce while focusing on attacking Spain. Concentration of naval forces was crucial for success. Captain William T. Sampson led the North Atlantic fleet, with the Oregon traveling from the Pacific to the Atlantic for service. The fleet was divided into major and flying squadrons to enforce blockades and patrol coastlines. The Spanish also dispatched a fleet, but the American Navy maintained superiority.|['1.

For almost a month, the Spanish fleet was out of sight, causing fear along the American coast. People were worried about Cervera's plans, speculating whether he would attack different places. The Spanish fleet's threat seemed larger due to uncertainty. Sampson correctly guessed Cervera would head to San Juan, Puerto Rico. But when he didn't find the Spanish fleet, he returned. Schley, with the Flying Squadron, was then sent to Cienfuegos. Meanwhile, Cervera avoided American scouts by taking a southern route. Upon learning Sampson was at San Juan, Cervera sailed to Santiago de Cuba. Despite being safe in harbor, Cervera's options were limited. The American fleet successfully blockaded him, establishing naval superiority and securing the American coast.|"[""1.

The failure of the Merrimac experiment forced the American command to consider a new plan to release the American fleet by reducing Santiago through a military and naval attack. Cervera's choice of Santiago determined the direction of the first American overseas military expedition. The Spanish American War contrasts starkly with the Great War in terms of national atmosphere and preparation. The Spanish American War felt like a national picnic with an amateurish approach due to the belief in the vast disparity in resources between Spain and the United States. The American press played an active role, revealing military moves and even formulating courses of action. The navy was more professional and independent in its actions compared to the army, which faced challenges in adjusting to the new conditions of war. The army's reliance on the militia, lack of modern warfare knowledge among officers, and insufficient training highlighted the need for military reform.|"[""1.

The army's lack of preparedness compared to the navy during the Spanish-American War cannot be solely attributed to logistical challenges. Secretary of War Russell A. Alger, despite his military background, failed to grasp the essence of his role. His book about the war reflected his ignorance and lack of seeking professional advice. The absence of a general staff further hindered decision-making. The allocation of funds for coast defense, while the navy fulfilled its duties, was unnecessary. The regular army's numbers increased to 56,365 by August 1898, with a reliance on volunteers. The recruitment of officers for the volunteer army posed challenges, with many lacking proper training. The appointment of senior officers based on age rather than merit also impacted the army's effectiveness. Ultimately, the inadequate training of officers was a significant factor in the army's struggles during the conflict.|"[""1.

In 1898, the decision to send an unprepared American army into Cuba was made due to the urgent need for action. The army was ill-equipped for the tropical jungle climate and faced health risks. The responsibility for this decision lay with the nation, and the lack of readiness led to sacrifices. The army was sent to invade Cuba without proper consideration of its fitness for the task. Despite the inexperience of the American command, they were unaware of the dangers posed by tropical diseases like yellow fever and typhoid. General Miles and the Department had differing opinions on the objective, but eventually, Santiago became the logical target. General Shafter was ordered to sail with 10,000 men, and after delays, the troops arrived off Santiago on June 20th. The Spanish troops in Cuba were numerous, but the American commanders relied on morale and strategy to overcome the challenges. The campaign against Santiago involved a march overland to the city, with the support of the navy. The first engagement at Las Guasimas saw the Americans defeating the Spaniards, leading up to the major battle on July 1st.|"['1.

"Between the opposing forces was the little river San Juan and its tributaries. The Spanish left wing was at El Caney, supported by a stone blockhouse, rifle pits, and barbed wire, but with no artillery. About four miles away was San Juan Hill, with more formidable works straddling the main road which led to Santiago. Opposite El Caney, General Lawton was in command of about seven thousand Americans. The fight here began at half-past six in the morning, but the American artillery was placed at too great a distance to be very effective. The result was a long and galling exchange of rifle firing, which is apt to prove trying to raw troops. The infantry, however, advanced with persistency and showed marked personal initiative as they pushed forward under such protection as the brush and grass afforded until they finally rushed a position which gave opportunity to the artillery. After this they speedily captured the blockhouse.

The battle of El Caney was perhaps unnecessary, for the position lay outside the main Spanish line anal would probably have been abandoned when San Juan fell. For that more critical movement General Shafter kept about eight thousand troops and the personal command. Both he and General Wheeler, however, were suffering from the climate and were unable to be with the troops.

General Hawkins bravely led the charge against the enemy's center, while General S.S. Sumner and Colonel Roosevelt guided their men to take over San Juan Hill. The Americans, now in possession of the San Juan position, faced the challenge of unlocking the fortified city of Santiago, just over a mile away. Despite the American losses, reinforcements arrived, boosting their numbers. Meanwhile, the Spanish commanders, believing Santiago's fall was inevitable, decided to attempt a naval escape. The American blockade, meticulously organized by Admiral Sampson, proved effective. On July 3rd, Cervera's fleet attempted to flee but was met with a well-coordinated response.

Heading westward, the Spanish ships tried to cross the battle line, but the American vessels matched their speed. The engagement was intense for a while as most ships from both fleets were involved, with the Spanish harbor batteries joining in. At 10:15 A.M., the Maria Teresa, Admiral Cervera's flagship, ablaze and heavily damaged, turned towards the shore. Shortly after, the Oquendo, following a duel with the Texas, also headed inshore. The Brooklyn led the American ships, closely tailed by the Oregon, which displayed exceptional speed beyond its capacity. These two ships pursued the Vizcaya and the Cristobal Colon, while the slower vessels handled the Spanish destroyers, Furor and Pluton. By 11:15 A.M., the Vizcaya, battered by the Brooklyn and Oregon, surrendered. Admiral Sampson, aboard the New York, was nearing the scene and directed most vessels back to their positions.

During the Cuban campaign, the American Army faced a health crisis due to the harsh climate. The soldiers, once full of energy, were now weakened by illness. The army's fighting strength was depleted, risking defeat had the Spanish commander held out longer. Concerned officers like Generals Wheeler, Sumner, and Lawton, along with Colonel Roosevelt, urgently requested General Shafter to move the army to prevent further loss of life. By early August, many soldiers were sick, with thousands suffering from yellow fever. The Secretary of War authorized the withdrawal of troops to prevent more casualties. The soldiers were moved to Camp Wikoff, where about twenty thousand were ill. This experience led to improvements in tropical sanitation, better army administration, and a focus on soldier health.

The American expeditionary force to Porto Rico was smaller than initially planned, consisting of about 15,000 men. They faced approximately 10,000 Spanish troops gathered to the north and in the interior. The American Army, dispatched from ports like Charleston and Newport News, swiftly occupied areas like Guanica, Ponce, and Arroyo with minimal resistance. The main objective was to capture San Juan, the only fortress, located on the northern coast across a mountain range. By August 13th, American forces were making progress, with General Wilson clearing mountain ranges, General Schwan occupying Mayaguez, and General Henry advancing through Arecibo. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, General Merritt led American troops to support Dewey's victory, preparing to occupy Manila.

The main focus of the peaceful battle between Admiral Dewey and the German squadron was the reaction of the onlookers in the harbor. Admiral Dewey, uncertain of the German squadron's intentions, warned of the impending attack and cleared foreign ships from the line of fire. On August 13th, Dewey positioned his fleet before the city, passing the British ship Immortalite, receiving a salute. The British commander, Captain Chichester, took a position between the American fleet and the German squadron. The Filipinos, eager for action, fired upon the Spaniards once the American assault began. Spain sought peace on July 18th through French mediation. Despite delays, a protocol was signed on August 12th, leading to the eventual capture of Manila. Peace negotiations in Paris ensued, focusing on the independence of Cuba, the end of Spanish rule in the Americas, and the cession of Porto Rico to the United States.|"[""1.

"The American commissioners faced a crucial decision regarding the Philippines during the negotiation. Dewey's unexpected victory in the Philippines led to debates about annexation. Many Americans initially viewed it as a military move rather than a step towards annexation. As sentiment grew in favor of keeping the islands, discussions intensified. Some argued for retaining the Philippines to fulfill a missionary impulse of spreading civilization. Calls for the U.S. to take up the ""White Man's Burden"" gained traction, emphasizing the duty to civilize the less developed nations. McKinley sought opinions on the matter, with religious leaders and those eyeing trade opportunities supporting annexation. General Merritt's reports from the Philippines reinforced the view that the U.S. must stay due to the chaotic local conditions. The situation in the Philippines made it unlikely for Spanish rule to be restored, leading to a growing belief in the inevitability of annexation."|"['1.

Admiral Dewey observed the conditions in areas where Spanish rule had ended but American control had not yet begun. Reports of cruelty towards religious and civil leaders troubled him, leading him to believe that the natives were not capable of self-governance. There was a fear that if the United States did not take over the Philippines, Spain might sell its rights to another power. Some Americans even suggested letting Germany take control. President McKinley, reflecting the majority sentiment, emphasized the need for the U.S. to take on the responsibility of governing the Philippines. Despite internal divisions among American commissioners, the U.S. ultimately decided to acquire the entire archipelago. The treaty, signed in 1898, involved Spain relinquishing control over Cuba and ceding the Philippines to the United States for $20 million.|['1.

The treaty between the United States and Spain after the war was a significant moment in American history, signifying a shift in the nation's relationship with the world. Despite opposition, efforts were made to downplay this new era. The acquisition of the Philippines was contested, with arguments about historical claims and the strategic importance of the islands. Unlike previous expansions, the Philippines presented unique challenges due to their distance, dense population, and lack of potential for assimilation. The terms of the treaty left the future status of the territories uncertain, with Congress to decide their fate. The subsequent presidential campaign highlighted the differing views on colonial expansion, with the Republicans supporting the Administration's policies and the Democrats advocating for self-government and independence for the territories. The period following the Spanish War saw the U.S. adapting its foreign policy to changing global conditions, with figures like John Hay playing a crucial role in shaping American diplomacy.|"['1.

Hay discovered better tools than many Americans had expected. The American diplomatic service abroad has not always been commendable, with both capable individuals and others who were unwise and rude. The State Department in Washington, however, has largely avoided political upheavals and benefited from dedicated officials. Between 1897 and 1913, the overseas service was established on a foundation of continuity and advancement. A significant shift occurred in the American public's view on annexation during this era. The United States annexed Hawaii and Samoa, purchased islands from Spain, and acquired naval stations in strategic locations. The U.S. also showed integrity in its dealings with Cuba, honoring promises made even when not in its immediate interest. The country worked diligently to help Cuba achieve self-governance. Similarly, in Puerto Rico, the U.S. implemented a unique form of governance, eventually granting its residents American citizenship. These actions showcased America's commitment to fairness and dedication to assisting other nations in their development.|"[""1.

On the other side of the world, the United States faced a challenging situation in the Philippines. Unlike the Cubans who sought independence, the Filipinos demanded redress of their grievances. Even though the US had helped Aguinaldo return to the islands, they did not officially recognize his authority. When Aguinaldo saw Spanish power fading, he advocated for the end of foreign rule. However, the US legally owned the islands through the treaty with Spain. The Filipinos were not a united nation but a mix of different peoples and tribes. Despite facing initial resistance, US forces, led by General Otis, engaged in hostilities with Aguinaldo's troops. The Americans, though outnumbered, had advantages in their military and naval power. General MacArthur's successful advance into Filipino territory showcased American bravery and tactics.|"[""1.

Not far from there, the Rio Grande, a river 400 feet wide, needed crossing using a railroad bridge by Colonel Funston and the Twentieth Kansas. They found an old raft and two soldiers swam across with a rope, securing it to the enemy's trench works. Colonel Funston then set up a ferry to transport troops. Despite the challenge of only carrying six men per trip, they successfully crossed the river, earning the respect of the natives for American soldiers. General Lawton led a successful battle at Zapoti Bridge, bringing a significant part of the island under U.S. control. The fighting evolved into guerrilla warfare, requiring innovative tactics. The American troops adapted well, fighting in diverse terrains and scenarios. The Filipinos, fighting in small groups, used their knowledge of the land to their advantage. The outcome of the conflict depended on the Filipinos' willingness to reconcile and the American people's commitment to the occupation.|"['1.

Two significant events marked the end of uncertainties in the Philippines. First, William Jennings Bryan lost the presidential election in November 1900, granting President McKinley four more years to continue his policies. Second, on March 23, 1901, Aguinaldo, who had been in hiding, was captured. Despite his diminishing control over the insurgent forces, Aguinaldo remained a central figure in the revolt. Funston orchestrated a clever plan to capture him, successfully tricking Aguinaldo into revealing his location. After his capture, Aguinaldo acknowledged American sovereignty in the Philippines, bringing an end to the armed resistance. With the insurrection leaders either captured or surrendered, peace prevailed in the region. The United States, lacking laws for governing territories, entrusted the Military Governor with control. The democratic principles of the U.S. Army were reflected in the establishment of local governing bodies and the introduction of popular elections. President McKinley appointed a commission to advise on a permanent government system, leading to the appointment of Judge Taft as the new governor.|"[""1.

The outbreak of war with Germany showcased the loyalty of the Filipinos to American interests.

Japan gained Formosa and the recognition of Korea's separation from China after a military victory. This victory allowed Japan to show its potential for expansion. However, the European states believed that Japan's victories upset the balance of power in the Orient. Germany, Russia, Great Britain, France, and Italy each secured ports in China to expand their influence. The United States, with long-standing relations with China and Japan, had a history of trade and missionary work in the region. Despite the American government's honorable conduct in the Far East, there were tensions due to immigration policies.

Secretary Hay responded decisively to the crisis, taking on a leadership role. The United States promptly agreed to assist in the international effort to aid foreign ministers trapped in Pekin. American support was swift and effective, with naval forces quickly deployed to Tientsin and troops dispatched from the Philippines. Despite Germany's larger land force, the U.S. played a significant role. Secretary Hay's diplomatic efforts were pivotal in preserving China's integrity and ensuring fair trade practices. In a subsequent conflict between Japan and Russia, Hay's diplomatic interventions helped maintain Chinese neutrality and limit the war's impact on China.

In the late 1800s, Secretary Hay crafted a policy for the United States in the Far East that emphasized cooperation with other major powers while respecting the right of nations to govern themselves. This policy aimed to protect China's integrity and secure trade rights. Despite some challenges, the United States briefly led the global powers in the region. After Hay's death, Secretary Root continued the policy, fostering an understanding with Japan to maintain peace and commerce in the Pacific. However, tensions arose over Japanese immigration to the U.S., leading to discriminatory laws and agreements to limit Japanese entry.

When President Wilson took office, the United States was quick to support the new Chinese republic. In 1913, the President stated that the loan conditions seemed to challenge China's independence, and the U.S. did not want to be involved. This decision renewed America's policy of non-interference. While American troops were active in the Philippines and China, dealing with diplomatic issues closer to home was still a challenge. The Spanish-American War had changed America's global role, making foreign affairs more important. The U.S. improved its diplomatic services, and other countries began taking America seriously. Germany, for example, made friendly gestures, hoping to influence American support. France and England also sought to strengthen ties with the U.S. However, these gestures did not mean the U.S. would always get its way. Disputes, like boundary issues with Britain, were still resolved through legal means. Despite occasional tensions, the U.S. and Britain maintained a cordial relationship, working towards peaceful resolutions.|"[""1.

The discovery of gold in the Yukon in 1897 sparked a need for action regarding the boundary between the United States and Great Britain. By 1899, a temporary agreement was reached, leading to arbitration in 1903. The arbitrating board included members from both nations. The decision favored the United States, giving them control of the coast and its harbors. This settlement established a mutually accepted boundary on all frontiers. The discovery of gold in Alaska initiated its economic growth. A joint agreement in 1911 with Great Britain, Japan, and Russia helped regulate international fisheries. Diplomatic relations between the United States and Canada involve resolving minor differences. Reciprocity agreements and commissions have helped address various issues, including the establishment of the International Fisheries Commission in 1908. The Atlantic fisheries off Newfoundland have been a point of contention, with negotiations dating back to the early 19th century.|['1.

In 1902, Hay and Sir Robert Bond of Newfoundland tried to create a new agreement, but the Senate rejected it. Newfoundland then obstructed American fishermen, causing tension. The matter went to the Hague Court in 1909 for resolution. Meanwhile, the Spanish War highlighted the need for an Atlantic-Pacific canal. Hay worked to change the Clayton-Bulwer Treaty with Britain to allow US control over the canal. After Senate rejection, a new treaty was accepted in 1901, giving the US control over the canal's military protection. This treaty removed obstacles to the canal's construction. The Panama and Nicaragua routes were debated, and in 1902, Roosevelt chose Panama. This decision marked a significant step towards building the canal.|"['1.

The United States faced challenges in acquiring the rights to construct the Panama Canal. Initially, a French company held rights and equipment for the project. The US government purchased these assets for $40 million, establishing a direct relationship with Colombia. Negotiations with Colombia were complex due to the terms of a treaty from 1846. Despite the rejection of an initial treaty proposal, President Roosevelt took a firm stance. He explored alternative options, including the possibility of Panama separating from Colombia. When rumors of revolution surfaced, Roosevelt acted swiftly, dispatching navy ships to protect American interests. Eventually, Panama declared independence, leading to the US recognizing the new republic. This event marked a significant step towards the construction of the Panama Canal.|"['1.

The United States acted quickly to recognize the new state of Panama, a move that differed from past practices. While the U.S. had criticized Great Britain for recognizing the Southern Confederacy during the Civil War, it now supported Panama's separation from Colombia. President Roosevelt justified this by emphasizing the importance of upholding agreements to maintain global peace. The U.S. secured a zone to build the Panama Canal, a strategic waterway connecting oceans. The U.S. also established itself as a key player in the Caribbean region, ensuring its strategic interests were protected. Over time, the U.S. expanded its influence in the Caribbean through treaties and strategic positions, safeguarding against potential European interventions. The U.S. remained vigilant in protecting its interests, especially in the face of emerging global powers like Japan.|"[""1.

In 1912, the United States became aware of Japan's negotiations with Mexico for control over Magdalena Bay, prompting Senator Lodge to introduce a resolution in the Senate. The resolution expressed concerns about foreign powers occupying strategic locations in the Americas that could threaten U.S. safety. It highlighted the potential dangers of European financial claims against Central American states and the need to prevent permanent control through debt leverage. The passage also discusses historical events, such as Germany's attempt to collect debts from Venezuela in 1902, which led to diplomatic tensions resolved through arbitration. President Roosevelt's actions to protect the Monroe Doctrine and prevent European intervention in the Americas are highlighted, emphasizing the importance of U.S. interests in the region.

In the early 1900s, several Caribbean nations struggled to pay their debts, not due to lack of resources but because of constant political turmoil. The Dominican Republic, in particular, faced financial ruin, leading to a unique intervention by the United States. President Roosevelt extended the Monroe Doctrine in 1905 by agreeing to manage the Dominican Republic's debts and customs houses, ensuring the nation's territorial integrity. This move was met with criticism in the U.S., seen as imperialistic. Similar agreements were attempted with Nicaragua and Honduras but faced challenges. The U.S. also intervened in Haiti to protect its independence. These actions reshaped the Caribbean, with the U.S. playing a significant role in stabilizing the region. The Pan-American movement aimed to foster unity among the Americas but faced challenges due to suspicion and national pride among some Latin American powers.|"['1.

During the early 1900s, the United States aimed to foster friendly relations with Latin American nations. Despite doubts from some publicists about the ability of these countries to stand alone, they acknowledged Germany's influence in Brazil and Japan's interest elsewhere. The U.S. sought cooperation over control, respecting each nation's adherence to the Monroe Doctrine. Close ties with Mexico were evident through numerous agreements and shared investments. However, the revolution led by Francisco Madero in 1910 brought uncertainty. The U.S. and other nations were concerned for their citizens and investments. Madero's presidency was short-lived, as he was overthrown by Huerta in 1913, sparking further unrest. The U.S. responded by restricting arms trade to Mexico to quell violence. The era of disturbance in Latin America persisted, challenging American policies under the Monroe Doctrine.|"['1.

When President Wilson assumed office on March 4, 1913, he faced a continent in turmoil. The situation in the Caribbean was clear, and Pan-American unity was on the rise, yet its direction remained uncertain. Chaos gripped Mexico, posing a significant challenge for the United States in the Caribbean and the potential for cooperation among the Americas. The U.S. foreign policy evolved beyond regional focuses to embrace a global perspective. While peace talks were prevalent, the looming threat of war persisted. The concept of buffer states as peacekeepers had faded, and the balance of power was questioned. Advocates like Theodore Roosevelt and Admiral Mahan pushed for military readiness, while others championed international tribunals for conflict resolution. The idea of a world court gained traction, fostering treaties for peaceful dispute resolution. Despite Senate reservations, the push for global cooperation and peace continued.|['1.

In the early 1900s, President Taft worked on treaties that required countries to reach agreements before going to court. The United States made deals with various nations to settle disputes peacefully. Over time, the U.S. engaged in international collaborations on issues like trade, health, and agriculture. The country also joined efforts to establish global standards and regulations. As the world became more connected through travel and communication, the U.S. played a significant role in shaping international relations. The nation's development mirrored global changes, with democratic ideals spreading worldwide. By the 20th century, the U.S. had evolved into a major power with vast territories and international commitments. While America once aimed to avoid entanglements, it now sought to promote cooperation and prevent conflicts through diplomacy and treaties.|"[""1.
