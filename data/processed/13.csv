"In the first part, the Bellman is overly concerned about appearances, having the bowsprit varnished frequently. However, when it came time to replace it, no one knew which end went where. The Bellman's strict adherence to the Naval Code made it impossible to question him. This led to the bowsprit being haphazardly attached, causing the ship to sail backward. The crew's attempts to steer were futile due to Rule 42 of the Code. Additionally, the pronunciation of ""slithy toves"" and other complex words is explained using Humpty-Dumpty's theory. The poem also mentions a Beaver who saved the crew from wreck, a Baker who forgot things, and a Butcher who could only kill Beavers. The Bellman, with his peculiar crew, sets off on an adventure."|"[""1.
