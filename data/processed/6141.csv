Pa found himself in a challenging situation with the Indian tribe after an incident involving a dog and a bear. The Indians tested Pa's bravery by asking him to kick a dog, which he did reluctantly. Later, Pa was expected to face a grizzly bear, but when the bear approached, Pa's courage faltered, and he ran away. Despite this, Pa tried to redeem himself by teaching the squaws how to make buckwheat pancakes, which they enjoyed immensely. Subsequently, Pa was tasked with a coyote hunt, where he impressed the tribe by demonstrating how to use baby trundlers for the papooses. However, the squaws misunderstood and carried the wagons on their backs, causing Pa frustration.

Pa's advice to the squaws to demand recognition as equals and refuse to be drudges led to a chaotic situation. The squaws, after organizing a woman's rights union, took charge of the tribe. They tied up the Indian men and declared themselves as the bosses, ordering the men to do all the work while they relaxed. However, a sudden twist occurred when the Indian men rebelled, overpowering Pa and planning to burn him at the stake. In a clever turn of events, Pa used an electric battery and phosphorus to create a supernatural illusion, convincing the Indians of his power. Eventually, Pa negotiated a deal for some Indians and squaws to join his show at a high salary, diffusing the tension and leaving with a sense of victory.|"[""1.

On the way to the ranch, where we were to meet the cowboys and make the show a success, the cowboy Pa had along told Pa that while it might be easy to fool Indians with tricks, cowboys were a different story. He said Pa needed to be a cowboy himself to lead them. Pa claimed he could rope, but when he tried, the saddle cinch broke, and he ended up chasing a steer across the plains. The cowboys rescued Pa and praised his efforts. Pa then hired some cowboys for the show. The next day, we visited scientists excavating petrified bones. They showed us bones of dinosaurs that once roamed the land. The cowboys teased Pa about live dinosaurs in a valley to the north, but the scientists assured him they were extinct.|"['1.

Pa asked the other cowboys if they had ever been to that dinosaur valley. They winked and said they had heard of it but lacked money to go, as it was dangerous. Bill, the storyteller, claimed to have seen a live dinosaur there. Pa, excited, planned to capture one for a show. However, Henry, his son, thought Bill was lying. Pa insisted on the expedition, comparing it to finding extinct animals like the buffalo. The group set out, but soon encountered robbers led by Curry. They were captured, and Pa realized he had been tricked. The cowboys were part of the gang. Pa was asked for a ransom. Henry, who once admired train robbers, now saw the harsh reality and the lack of glory in their criminal activities.|"['1.

After Pa and I were captured with the treacherous cowboys, the first couple of days were quite pleasant. We ate canned food and elk meat, while Pa kept the gang entertained with news from the outside world. The gang didn't read newspapers, so Pa filled them in on the latest happenings. When they robbed a train, they spared the newsboy to avoid surprises. Pa shared stories of reform sweeping the nation, politicians taking on big businesses, and insurance companies being caught red-handed. The gang leader admired Teddy Roosevelt's potential as a train robber but lamented his focus on politics. Pa even suggested the gang leader could excel in legitimate business with his financial skills. However, the gang leader felt it was too late for him to switch paths and expressed reservations about exploiting the vulnerable for personal gain.|['1.

Pa, a captive of train robbers in the mountains, debates with a bandit about the merits of a life of crime versus high finance.

Pa decided to contemplate the offer of sharing the stolen money but wanted the option to return it if his board of directors disapproved. The gang leader agreed, and they prepared to leave the wilderness. They spent the day packing and playing games with hundred-dollar bills. That evening, they had a banquet in a cave, dining on canned soup, sardines, elk, baked beans, and coffee.

Buckskin Bill, a former Chicago alderman, shared his past and encouraged his colleagues to repent.

We were heading back home after recruiting Indians, cowboys, rough riders, and highway robbers for our next show. Pa felt youthful when we reached the railroad after parting ways with the robbers at the Hole-in-the-Wall in the mountainous region. Arriving at a bustling town along the railroad, filled with gambling houses and saloons, caused a stir due to our arrival. Pa discovered most of the money from the robbers was in good greenbacks, except for a bundle of old confederate money. After burning the worthless money, Pa decided to stay a few days to rest and try his luck at the faro banks. Despite my attempts to persuade him to return home to report to the circus managers, Pa was intrigued by a man selling buffalo herds nearby.

We guided the buffalo herd up to the ridge, out of sight of Pa, by nudging and patting them. Suddenly, the lead bull's head appeared above the ridge, just ten rods from Pa. Gunshots rang out, and the herd, about 20 strong, trotted towards the shed for salt. As Pa's shots ran out, we revealed ourselves on the ridge. Pa, with a peck of salt, tripped and spilled it. The buffalo, harmless according to the rancher, surrounded Pa, licking up the salt. They ignored him until the salt was gone, then licked his face and hands. Pa, in distress, called for help.

Pa had a rough time at the circus. Bouncers tossed him out, mistaking him for a ticketless man. The manager refused to let him back in. Even when Pa tried to explain, they didn't believe him. His face was red and sore from a buffalo licking, which had also turned his hair white. No animal wanted him around, except the sacred bull and cow. The zebras, lions, hyenas, wolves, tigers, and elephants all acted aggressively towards him. Pa's only solace was with the monkeys. Eventually, Pa changed his appearance back to normal and was welcomed back warmly. The circus closed, everyone bid farewell, and the tents were packed up.

We had to pass through the busy part of town, and my dad glanced at familiar faces, puffing up with pride as if he owned a brewery. He instructed me to release the vehicle's brakes, and I followed suit. As I did, a fruit vendor with a cart was crossing the street. Our car's cowcatcher snagged the cart, sending bananas and oranges flying. The vendor landed on his head, cursing in Italian. Dad cheered, but our wild ride continued. The car careened, causing chaos, spooking horses, and leading to a fiery hay incident. The situation escalated, with a herd of cattle blocking our path.

Dad was a mix of bravery and cowardice, especially when his stomach was upset. A trip through Yellowstone Park made him rethink his life. At the hotel, bears would come for garbage, but they were more interested in eating than attacking. One evening, Henry, the boy, tricked his dad into a bear encounter to get his adrenaline going.
