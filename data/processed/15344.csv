"Grace laughed happily at the thought of Ethel Post, a classmate, owning a movie theater at Coney Island. The futures predicted for the other students were equally unlikely. Finally, it was time for the senior class president to speak to the juniors. She compared them to babies just learning to stand and advised them not to rush. Julia Crosby, a junior, smiled as the senior president reminded them of their dignity. Julia then thanked the president for her guidance and acknowledged that they were still learning. The juniors hoped to grow wiser and stronger by the time they became seniors. Grace admired Julia's speech and saw her potential to be a strong leader in their class. The event ended with everyone singing ""Auld Lang Syne"" and the senior class cheer. The atmosphere shifted from sentimental to cheerful as families and friends gathered around the graduates."|"[""1.

"""I wonder who will win the freshman prize this year?"" Grace pondered. ""I hope it's a girl who truly needs it. I do know one thing; no one will claim the hundred-dollar prize this year. Anne broke the record.""

""If you reject the truth, that's fine,"" David responded. ""Oh, and I have an invite to share. Miriam wants all of you to come to our house right after the ceremony tonight. It doesn't matter if it's late. Graduation only happens once a year.""

""Shh,"" Hippy hushed. ""Let's be quiet. We're entering Assembly Hall. Due to my experience, I'll take charge of your behavior. Nora O'Malley, stifle that giggle,"" he ordered sternly, despite his jovial appearance.

Diplomas were handed out, and the freshman prize was awarded to a timid girl with pleading brown eyes. Grace observed her closely and decided to learn more about her.

The group marveled at the beautifully set table. A large favor pie shaped like a red rose adorned the center, with ribbons leading to each seat. Hand-painted place cards in red and gold, the sophomore colors, were also present.

The guests enjoyed the delicious meal. The favor pie, with personalized favors for each guest, sparked much amusement. After eating, toasts were made.
