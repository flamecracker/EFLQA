Nerle grew bored of the games and dancing quickly, missing the excitement of his father's castle. Feeling out of place among the ladies, he became discontented.

The next morning, Marvel and Nerle attempted once more to depart from the Kingdom of Spor and its unattractive king.

In a curious land called Twi, Prince Marvel and his companion Nerle encountered a strange sight. Everything appeared in pairs: two trees, two cows, two cottages, and even two little boys playing. The boys were twins, mimicking each other's every move. Startled, two women emerged from the cottages, indistinguishable from each other, and scolded the boys in perfect unison. As the men arrived, also twins, chaos ensued with everyone reacting in sync. The soldiers, identical in every way, captured the prince and Nerle. The land of Twi was a mirror image of itself, with double everything from buildings to people.

The Red Rogue, frightened but not defeated, planned to trick Prince Marvel. His castle held two enchanted mirrors crafted by his wise master. These mirrors could trap reflections and render bodies invisible. When the Red Rogue exposed one mirror, Lady Seseley and her maids vanished, their reflections captured. The esquire, sent to find them, saw their reflections but not their bodies. King Terribus, rushing in, also disappeared. Prince Marvel, sensing treachery, couldn't dissuade the curious twin High Ki from entering. They, along with Nerle and Wul-Takim, saw their reflections in the mirror but not the prince's due to his fairy nature. The mirror could only hold mortal forms.|"[""1.

Prince Marvel sighed with relief and closed the curtain over the mirror, knowing the Red Rogue of Dawna was finally imprisoned. As they left, the Red One's followers searched for their master but found only silence, fleeing in fear, never to return. Rumors spread of the haunted castle, and travelers avoided the area. They rode happily towards the Kingdom of Heg, invited by Nerle's father, Baron Neggar. Nerle reflected on contentment, realizing people often desire what they can't have. The High Ki of Twi decided to return home, escorted by men-at-arms. King Terribus bid farewell, heading back to his kingdom with Wul-Takim. Lady Seseley and her companions found a home at the baron's castle, where she later married Nerle. Prince Marvel, despite enjoying the festivities, grew thoughtful as the party dispersed. As they entered the forest, a sudden transformation saw Prince Marvel vanish, leaving behind only Lady Seseley's cloak.|"['1.
