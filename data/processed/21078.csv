In the summer nights, she transforms into a fierce hunter, prowling the fields with a dangerous demeanor.

From the moment Spot met Miss Kitty in the kitchen, he harbored a dislike for her. Despite claiming to be pleased to see her, he was already planning to have fun chasing her. Inside the farmhouse, Spot was on his best behavior, but Miss Kitty's unfriendly glare under the table made it clear she wasn't fond of him either. Spot wanted to bark at her but held back. Miss Kitty hissed at him, which Spot found amusing. He warned her that he would have fun with her outside. Spot cautiously left the house, keeping an eye on Mrs. Green's broom.

"Once in a while, Frisky Squirrel visited Farmer Green's place. Despite the dangers he encountered, he always came back for more adventures. As he scampered across the farmyard, he glanced around nervously. He hoped no one had witnessed Miss Kitty Cat chasing him out of the barn. Explaining that to his farmyard pals would be tricky. They would surely find it amusing. Miss Kitty Cat didn't usually talk to Henrietta Hen. She didn't care much for hens, preferring eggs and chickens.

Frisky Squirrel hadn't seen a cat before but was curious. He assured Mr. Crow he wouldn't harm her and hurried along the stone wall. In the farmyard, he searched for corn but found none as Henrietta Hen had eaten them all. Then, he smelled beechnuts by the woodshed, left by Johnnie Green. As he nosed around the beechnut shucks, Miss Kitty Cat, inside the woodshed, caught his scent. Upon seeing her nose, Frisky tumbled in surprise, dropping a beechnut shuck. Miss Kitty Cat, alerted by the sound, dashed out, and Frisky, sensing danger, leaped ahead in fear. He raced to a tall elm, knowing a tree was his safest escape from the approaching cat.|"['1.

Frisky Squirrel was startled to see the fierce creature, realizing it was the cat from the farmhouse. He warned her not to come closer to avoid getting hurt. Miss Kitty Cat cautiously watched from a safe distance as Frisky climbed higher into the tree. Suddenly, something about her presence made Frisky shiver and lose his grip, causing him to slip and fall from branch to branch. Despite his concern, Miss Kitty Cat gracefully landed on her feet, unharmed. Impressed by her agility, Frisky complimented her as he regained his balance. Meanwhile, Mr. Crow, known for his wisdom, was puzzled by the concept of a cat having nine lives and decided to seek answers from Miss Kitty Cat herself.|"[""1.

Mr. Crow taunted Miss Kitty Cat about her supposed nine lives, trying to learn more about the mystery. Miss Kitty Cat ignored him and went into the woodshed. In the buttery, Mrs. Green skimmed cream from milk and lowered it into a well. Miss Kitty Cat purred by Mrs. Green, hinting at her innocence. Later, cream traces in the buttery puzzled Mrs. Green, suspecting a thief. Farmer Green checked Miss Kitty Cat for cream stains but found her clean.

Farmer Green's wife was puzzled by the disappearing cream from the milk pans. She suspected a thief and told Farmer Green to feed the milk to the pigs. Spot, the old dog, thought it was a waste. Miss Kitty Cat was aloof, but Spot caught her slipping through a chimney hole to steal cream. Spot exposed her when she couldn't clean her face in time. Farmer Green sealed the hole, and Miss Kitty had to return to drinking milk from a saucer.

Mr. and Mrs. Wren adored their small home, while Miss Kitty Cat disliked it for the same reason - she couldn't fit inside. The opening, a syrup can mouth used as a door, was too tiny for Miss Kitty but just right for the Wrens. Miss Kitty believed the Wrens would prefer a larger home like hers. She suggested they build in the cherry tree, where there was space for many homes. Miss Kitty boasted about visiting other bird families but was actually eyeing the Wrens' nest. Rusty Wren returned to find Miss Kitty perched on their nest, endangering his family. Mrs. Wren warned Rusty of Miss Kitty's true intentions. She pretended to be friendly while plotting harm.|"[""1.

The Wren family's feathered friends arrived in all directions, taunting Miss Kitty Cat. Some even swooped close, as if to attack her. The mysterious stranger teased her cunningly, howling from the lilac bushes and meowing from the farmhouse hedge. Despite her efforts, Miss Kitty couldn't spot the culprit. Puzzled, she pondered the oddity of a voice without a visible cat. Frustrated, she wished the noisy stranger would reveal himself for a fair fight. Suddenly, a slate-colored bird, Mr. Catbird, burst from the bushes, revealing the prank. Surrounded by mocking birds, including Mrs. Wren, Miss Kitty retreated to the haymow, averse to the noisy commotion. Old dog Spot questioned why Mrs. Green kept Miss Kitty instead of using mousetraps. Miss Kitty defended her skills, claiming smart mice outwit traps, while Spot argued for the practicality of traps over feeding a cat.|"[""1.

Spot, the wise old dog, proudly declared his duties of driving cows and guarding the house and barns at night, emphasizing his importance. He dismissed the idea of catching mice, stating that mousetraps were ineffective for such tasks. Miss Kitty Cat agreed, noting that traps lacked the warmth and playfulness she offered to mice she caught. Mr. Mouse complained about the lack of food due to Miss Snooper's presence, reminiscing about the delicious cheese Mrs. Green used to leave. Moses Mouse expressed distaste for their current diet of putty and wished Miss Snooper had to eat it instead. Spot then noticed a box in the cellar, sparking curiosity among the mice.|"['1.

"Moses Mouse and his wife enjoyed a meal of raw potatoes in their cozy cellar. The pale moonlight illuminated their feast as they relished the cool dampness and musty smell of their surroundings. Lost in their meal, Moses noticed eyes peering at them. Startled, he gasped, ""Miss Snooper!"" and vanished, leaving behind a potato in his place.

Master Meadow Mouse had witnessed the whole event and recounted it to Moses Mouse. He saw a wagon carry Miss Snooper up the road and over the hill, vanishing from sight. Moses Mouse rushed home to share the news, but no one cared about Miss Kitty Cat's disappearance. The Mouse family couldn't believe she was truly gone until two days passed without her presence. Meanwhile, Kitty Cat found herself in a predicament. She was lured into a peddler's wagon with food and then trapped in a basket.

The peddler clucked to his horse, starting the journey up the hill. Miss Kitty, uncomfortable in the bumpy wagon, gritted her teeth at every stone the wheels hit. Despite being taken away in the peddler's cart, Miss Kitty remained alert inside the basket, planning her return to Farmer Green's farm. She knew the twists and turns as they traveled up and down the hills, with moments of level stretches in between. Miss Kitty thought about the mice back at the farm, realizing the need for her hunting skills. After being tossed into the cellar by the peddler's wife, Miss Kitty missed the comfort of Farmer Green's home.

Miss Kitty had walked a mile and stopped by a brook to drink water. She was very thirsty as she hadn't drunk since the evening before. She saw a pretty wood beyond the brook, filled with chirping birds and playful chipmunks. Miss Kitty thought of her breakfast and stayed a while to scare the birds away by sharpening her claws. After bothering the birds, she continued her journey to Pleasant Valley, traveling through fields, roads, and stone walls. She hid from passing wagons until the road was clear. Despite her adventure, she missed Mrs. Green's house, especially the kitchen's delicious smells. Miss Kitty quickened her pace, feeling homesick. She found her way back without explaining her whereabouts, leaving the mice to play and feast in her absence.|"['1.
