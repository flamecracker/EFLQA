The boy, barefoot and dressed in worn blue-jeans overalls and a faded gingham shirt held together by a single strap, wore an oversized Scotch golf cap. Mr. Conant, frustrated, read a letter aloud to the boy, emphasizing the need to follow instructions. Irene, in her wheelchair, expressed joy at the prospect of a ramp being built. Aunt Hannah checked the kitchen supplies while the Conants settled in. As Irene and Bub bonded, she learned about the nearby Barker and Bigbee houses and their neighbors, including Doolittle. Their friendship blossomed as they prepared for a simple dinner at Hillcrest Lodge, a cozy retreat on the mountainside.|"['1.

"Will Morrison was a skilled hunter and fisherman. The ""den"" at the Lodge displayed his hunting and fishing trophies. It was filled with stag and doe heads, large trout, wild mountain sheep antlers, rods, guns, and hunting knives. The room also had fishing equipment like reels, flies, and creels. Bear, deer, and beaver rugs covered the floor, and a shelf held books on sports. Mr. Conant reserved the den for his evening pipe. Bub Grigger helped with chores but mostly whittled aimlessly. The girls found the den fascinating. Irene even got the adjoining bedroom. Bub avoided the girls, making it hard for them to befriend him. Mr. Conant left for a trip, leaving the girls alone. They planned to read, eat, and sleep. Irene found solace in the old books in the den. The girls enjoyed their solitude until a surprise visitor interrupted their peace on Thursday afternoon."|"['1.

The new lady who arrived was strikingly beautiful, appearing to be around thirty years old. She wore a stylish walking-suit that complemented her figure, along with a small hat adorned with a single feather. Her dark hair and eyes stood out against the rosy hue of her cheeks. Carrying a walking-stick, she introduced herself as Agatha and preferred a casual atmosphere in the wilderness. She mentioned staying at the Bigbee house and expressed her eagerness to read, lamenting the absence of books there. Irene offered her library, containing around fifty books, some of which were old but still enjoyable. Agatha shared her belief that the content of a book matters more than its appearance, while Irene appreciated beautifully bound books for enhancing the reading experience. Despite their differences, the girls engaged in pleasant conversation with Agatha, who shared stories about her worldly experiences and her preference for driving herself instead of relying on chauffeurs.|['1.

After a while, they entered the house, and Miss Lord was introduced to Aunt Hannah, who greeted their neighbor warmly. Agatha eagerly picked out two books from the den to take home. While Irene casually flipped through some volumes, she noticed an old letter tucked inside one of them. Intrigued, she examined the fine handwriting on the yellowed paper. Suddenly, Agatha's expression caught Irene's attention—tense and triumphant. It unsettled her. Irene closed the book decisively, signaling she needed more time before answering questions. As Agatha continued browsing titles, Mary Louise sensed tension between the two. Curious about the letter, she refrained from mentioning it in Miss Lord's presence. Eventually, after some pleasant conversation, Agatha left gracefully. Irene assured Mary Louise she would explore the letter further, leaving her friend to ponder its mysterious contents.|"['1.

"""I can drive any car with wheels. Two years ago, before Talbot arrived, I used to drive Will Morrison to Millbank every week to catch the train and then bring the car back,"" explained Bub.

Irene, a girl in her late teens, casually walked towards the house without asking for permission. Miss Lord, a visitor, went inside to pick a book without anyone paying much attention. After fifteen minutes, she returned with a book, and Irene, feeling relieved after seeing the title, resumed reading. As the sun moved across the mountain, casting shadows over the landscape, Mary Louise explained how the shadow acted as her sundial to tell the time. When it was time for Miss Lord to leave, the group disbanded, with Aunt Hannah preparing dinner and Mary Louise planning a dessert. Irene inspected the den, ensuring it was undisturbed, before retiring to her room to think about important matters.

Sarah Judd arrived at Hillcrest Lodge on the tenth of July, expecting to start work as Mrs. Morrison had instructed. However, Mrs. Morrison was not there, leaving Sarah in a predicament.

Sarah prepared meals for the family with skill and efficiency, impressing Mrs. Conant and proving her capability. The Conant family appreciated her help and decided to keep her around, seeing her as a valuable addition to their household.

Irene, lying in bed, carefully hid a letter in her chair cushion. She cut the stitches, placed the letter inside, and sewed it back up. She pondered what to do next. In the dark, she found the letter again, ripped open the cushion, and hid it under the chenille cover of her dresser. Irene, feeling like a conspirator, went back to bed. The next morning, Mary Louise found Irene's wet cushion and advised her to sew it up. They all went for a drive, with Bub driving cautiously down the mountain and then speeding up on the plain.|"['Question 1: What did Irene do with the letter in the chair cushion?\nA) She threw it away\nB) She burned it\nC) She hid it inside the cushion\nD) She gave it to Mary Louise\nE) She left it on the floor', 'Question 2: Where did Irene hide the letter after finding it in the dark?\nA) Under her pillow\nB) Under the rug\nC) Under the chenille cover of her dresser\nD) Inside a book\nE) Inside a drawer', 'Question 3: How did Irene feel while hiding the letter in the chair cushion?\nA) Angry\nB) Happy\nC) Sad\nD) Confused\nE) Like a conspirator', ""Question 4: Who found Irene's wet cushion the next morning?\nA) Bub\nB) Mary Louise\nC) Irene\nD) Their neighbor\nE) The maid"", 'Question 5: How did Bub drive down the mountain?\nA) Slowly\nB) Recklessly\nC) Carelessly\nD) Speeding up\nE) Backwards', 'Question 6: What did Irene do after feeling like a conspirator and going back to bed?\nA) Went for a drive\nB) Sewed up the wet cushion\nC) Called the police\nD) Went to the kitchen\nE) Took a shower']"|['C) She hid it inside the cushion', 'C) Under the chenille cover of her dresser', 'E) Like a conspirator', 'B) Mary Louise', 'A) Slowly', 'B) Sewed up the wet cushion']
Mary Louise found it amusing to observe the unique driver, barefoot and dressed in blue jeans and a hickory shirt, with a Scotch golf cap pulled low over his eyes. He took his job of driving the car very seriously, just like a city chauffeur. Mr. Conant muttered to himself about a letter he deemed important. Despite Irene having read it, he felt the need to confirm its significance. As they rode, he remained silent, fiddling with a locket on his watch chain. Before heading back, the driver, Bub, shared his thoughts with Mary Louise, cautioning her about a woman named Agatha Lord. Meanwhile, Irene had an unexpected encounter with Agatha Lord, who sought information about Mary Louise. Agatha tried to establish a friendly rapport with Irene to learn more about Mary Louise's background.|"['1.

The talk between Miss Lord and Irene did not touch on the letter or Colonel Weatherby. They conversed on other topics, maintaining a friendly facade. Irene felt she had revealed too much but kept the truth about the Colonel hidden. The letter was safely stashed away, challenging even Miss Lord to find it. Reflecting on this, Irene checked her hiding spot, finding the letter secure. Unaware, she missed a face at the window. Later, in the afternoon, Sarah Judd, the servant, discovered the letter in Will Morrison's rifle stock. She made a copy in shorthand and left a note on a blank paper.

Sarah Judd wrote the strange passage after consulting a hidden book in her hair filled with odd characters. Satisfied with her work, she went to the shed to talk to Bub.

Later, Sarah heard a sound and found the front door open and the den door closed. She caught Nan, who was pretending to be Miss Lord's maid, searching the house.

Sarah admitted to knowing the whereabouts of the letter that Nan Shelley was seeking. Despite Sarah's advice that finding the letter wouldn't aid in convicting Hathaway or locating him, Nan Shelley seemed intrigued by the challenge.
