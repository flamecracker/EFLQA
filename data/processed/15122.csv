Lloyd's excitement started when her dad took her to town to pick out a steamer trunk for their upcoming journey. She kept packing and unpacking it, eagerly awaiting the adventure. Her dad surprised her with a special diary for their trip, suggesting they record their memories. Lloyd loved the idea and planned to include photos, making it a cherished keepsake. Once on the ship, her mom felt seasick, and Lloyd found it hard to write due to the ship's motion. She convinced her dad to make the first entry in the diary, capturing details like steamship letters and ship facts.

Lloyd wandered to the other side of the deck, curious about the story. There, she found a row of people lounging in steamer-chairs. Among them, a girl in a scarlet jacket caught her attention. Despite not fitting Lloyd's beauty standards, she found the girl intriguing. The girl's long hair tied with scarlet ribbons and her scarlet cap stood out. As Lloyd observed, two noisy boys playing recklessly bumped into her. They were grabbing snacks from the deck stewards, causing a commotion. The boys then started calling for Fido, although there was no dog in sight. The situation escalated into a quarrel between the boys and the girl in the scarlet jacket. Lloyd was shocked by their behavior, contrasting it with what she perceived as proper English manners.|"[""1.

The Little Colonel felt her face flush with embarrassment. She was upset at being compared to the rude children and walked away swiftly. As she reached the cabin door, she encountered a maid holding something wrapped in an embroidered shawl. The maid gently revealed a bright little French poodle, making Lloyd smile with delight. The poodle wore a tiny diamond bracelet on its paw, some teeth even filled with gold. Despite the maid's scolding, Lloyd found the poodle charming and shared stories of her beloved pets back home. The boys, initially disinterested, gradually became captivated by Lloyd's tales, forgetting their usual mischief. Lloyd's storytelling skills captured their attention, offering a break from their usual scoldings and moral lessons.|"['1.

The poodle had a maid to ensure its comfort, while the boys were well-clothed and fed but lacked attention. Their questions were often dismissed, leaving them with no bedtime talks. The Little Colonel's stories captivated them, drawing them closer. Despite fears of bugaboos, they followed her around, eating bananas and listening intently. Their devotion amused and later gratified her. Others praised her for keeping the boys entertained. However, the constant storytelling became tiresome. Fidelia shared how the boys' mischief led to Beauty getting soaked and sick. With the boys locked up, Lloyd finally had a chance to speak with Fidelia alone.|"['1.

"""Fidelia, why do you feel sorry for them?"" asked the Little Colonel, feeling embarrassed. She couldn't explain that it was because a poodle got more attention than Howl and Henny due to Fidelia's nagging. Changing the subject, she asked what Fidelia wanted to see in Europe. Fidelia replied, ""Nothing! I only want to go to brag about it."" In contrast, Lloyd expressed her excitement about visiting châteaux, places from songs, and the homes of famous authors. She particularly looked forward to Switzerland for its heroic tales. Fidelia found Lloyd's interests strange, and Lloyd felt offended. Despite this, Lloyd made new friends on the ship and enjoyed playing games and listening to stories. The captain even shared sea tales with her, making her wish they could sail endlessly."|"[""1.

In July, they arrived in Switzerland after weeks of travel. They decided to take a break in Geneva, a beautiful old town. The Little Colonel, having breakfast at a hotel, couldn't eat as she was captivated by the view of the lake. Pleasure boats glided on the water, and the quay was bustling with people. The sound of pianos filled the air, and a band played on the pier. In the distance, Mont Blanc's snowy peak and the River Rhône framed the town. Mrs. Sherman planned to shop for unique music boxes and other musical items. Lloyd suggested surprising Mom Beck with a singing mirror. A kind old French soldier named Major Pierre de Vaux, with a heroic dog named Hero, caught their attention. The waiter mentioned that Hero was very smart and understood everything people said to him.|"['1.

After breakfast, Mrs. Sherman went to her room for her hat, leaving Lloyd waiting in the hall. Lloyd sat in a tall, carved chair near the elevator, which unexpectedly played music when she sat on it, embarrassing her. As she hurriedly left, she bumped into the Major, who kindly introduced her to a large, beautiful dog named Hero. Lloyd was charmed by Hero's appearance and friendly nature, exchanging affectionate gestures with him. Despite the initial embarrassment, Lloyd was delighted by the encounter and bid farewell to Hero, hoping to see him again.

Lloyd enjoyed the morning drive by the river, admiring the foreign signs above the shop doors. Passing the quay, they met the Major and his dog. The Little Colonel waved, reminded of her grandfather by the Major's empty sleeve. Watching Hero, she waited while her parents discussed enamelling. Sitting in the carriage, she observed the bustling streets, guessing at the foreign signs' meanings. A band played nearby, children with dolls and balloons hurried past. The coachman, tired from a fête, dozed off. The old horse, once spirited, startled as a board fell, triggering memories of past runaways. In a panic, it bolted down the street, recalling its fear of falling ladders.|"['1.

The sudden turn tossed the sleeping coachman off the carriage, sending the horse into a wild sprint. The Little Colonel, accustomed to driving, tried to regain control but couldn't. As the carriage careened through the streets, she saw flashes of memories. Nurses, dogs, and bystanders scrambled out of the way. Lloyd's fear grew as the carriage hurtled on, her thoughts racing. The carriage hit something, but the chaos continued until a figure stopped the horse. It was Hero, a familiar face in the foreign crowd. Confused and frightened, Lloyd was comforted by a familiar voice - the Major. In his embrace, she found solace after the terrifying ordeal.|"['1.

The Major led the Little Colonel across the street after Hero, the St. Bernard, bravely stopped a runaway carriage. Hero had been trained as a police dog before becoming an ambulance dog. The Major was proud of Hero's quick actions. The Little Colonel, grateful and tearful, hugged Hero tightly. When the Little Colonel's parents arrived, they were relieved to find her safe. Hero had known many masters, but the Little Colonel's love was special. Everyone praised Hero for his heroism, and a newspaper even took his picture.

The Major sat with his head bowed, lost in memories, when the Little Colonel entered the courtyard. She had dressed early and gone to the reading room but upon seeing the Major, she set her book aside. The sight of his lonely expression, furrowed face, and empty sleeve touched her heart. Lloyd was glad she came when she saw the Major's smile and Hero, the dog, wagging his tail. The conversation began with Hero as the topic. The Major shared about the Great St. Bernard Pass, where a monastery stands for over seven hundred years. He recounted his encounter with the monks and the heroic dog, Barry, who saved many lost travellers. Barry's bravery is immortalized in a monument in Paris.|"['1.

Forty lives saved is a good record. Barry, the heroic dog, was tenderly cared for in his old age. The monks provided him with a pension and sent him to Berne for a warmer climate. When he passed away, a taxidermist preserved his skin, and he was placed in the museum at Berne, where he remains today with a flask around his neck. Despite being just a dog, Barry was honored as a hero for his service to humanity. Trained like a soldier, he obeyed commands faithfully, even in treacherous conditions. Reflecting on Barry's loyalty, the narrator wished for rescue dogs like him during his own time of need. Inspired by Barry's bravery, the narrator, along with Herr Bungartz, founded a society to train ambulance dogs for battlefield rescue missions. The society supports kennels with over a thousand members, including royalty and military leaders, dedicated to training dogs for service.|"['1.

Almost a year ago, an elderly man shared a heartwarming story about his loyal dog Hero. The man had taken Hero to a skilled surgeon, who cured the dog's injured leg.

The Major was touched by Lloyd's efforts to learn French. Her sweet nature and kindness made him feel less lonely. Mrs. Sherman, moved by the Major's story about his daughter, invited him to dinner. This led to a warm friendship where the Major joined their outings, often accompanied by Hero, the St. Bernard. Lloyd and Hero became inseparable, exploring the town together.

Henri Durant, a compassionate friend, was deeply moved by the suffering of wounded soldiers after the battle of Solferino in Italy. Witnessing the lack of care for the wounded, he took action. Henri wrote a book that sparked international interest and led to the signing of a treaty in Geneva over thirty years ago. This treaty ensured that the Red Cross, a symbol of peace and safety, could provide aid to any wounded soldier regardless of nationality. Before this treaty, wounded soldiers faced horrific fates if captured by the enemy. Now, thanks to the Red Cross, soldiers are protected and cared for in times of conflict. Clara Barton, a heroic nurse, served tirelessly during the Civil War, offering comfort and aid on bloody battlefields.

"""No,"" replied her father, ""that is a sad truth. No matter how much we wish for the moon, it hangs too high for us to reach.

"His couch sat near the window, where the glistening lake sparkled in the sunset like pink mother-of-pearl.

Mr. Sherman accompanied the Major to Zürich the next morning. Lloyd saw the Major off while he was resting on his couch, smiling and waving goodbye. During Christmastide, as Lloyd wrote to Betty, she couldn't help but feel emotional thinking about the Major. She appreciated his sacrifice to go to the hospital alone. Lloyd was excited to reunite with her friends in Lucerne and Paris. She eagerly anticipated surprising them by arriving earlier than expected. Despite the old-fashioned charm of the Hotel Bordeaux in Tours, Lloyd was initially hesitant about the lack of modern conveniences.

Excitedly, Lloyd urged her mother to follow the porter carrying their trunk up the winding stairs. She joked about a song her mother used to sing, comparing the stairs to a circus act. As they ascended, Lloyd playfully imitated the movements of an elephant circling around. Suddenly, a boy slid down the banister with great speed, surprising Lloyd. She wondered if all their acquaintances were present, hoping a certain boy wouldn't bother her for stories. Her father reassured her, and she hurried to their rooms, overlooking a bustling boulevard. Mesmerized by the passing soldiers and schoolgirls, Lloyd lost track of time until her mother called them for lunch.|"['1.

"They quietly polished away for a few minutes, then Lloyd spoke once more. ""I surely have enough reminders of the memories I am trying to leave behind me.

Lloyd expressed how the trip would change his approach to studying and reading, focusing on English history for future visits. The Little Colonel shared the thoughtful gifts she had chosen for her friends back home, each with a special story behind it. Betty, however, felt her simple gifts lacked the grandeur of the others but explained the sentimental value they held. She gifted lava from Vesuvius, pebbles from Waterloo, and pressed buttercups from Anne Hathaway's cottage. Betty believed that the sentiment behind a gift mattered more than its monetary value, especially when given to someone who appreciates the thoughtfulness behind it.|"['**Question 1:**\nWhat did Lloyd focus on for future visits after the trip?\nA) Science experiments\nB) English history\nC) Art museums\nD) Cooking classes\nE) Sports events', '**Question 2:**\nWhat did the Little Colonel share with her friends back home?\nA) Postcards\nB) Souvenirs from a theme park\nC) Thoughtful gifts with special stories\nD) Books about traveling\nE) Gift cards', ""**Question 3:**\nHow did Betty feel about her gifts compared to the others' gifts?\nA) She thought hers were the best\nB) She was proud of her luxurious gifts\nC) She believed hers lacked grandeur\nD) She thought hers were too expensive\nE) She was indifferent"", ""**Question 4:**\nWhat did Betty gift to her friends?\nA) Expensive jewelry\nB) Handmade cards\nC) Souvenirs from a zoo\nD) Lava from Vesuvius, pebbles from Waterloo, and pressed buttercups from Anne Hathaway's cottage\nE) Art supplies"", '**Question 5:**\nAccording to Betty, what mattered more than the monetary value of a gift?\nA) The size of the gift\nB) The brand of the gift\nC) The sentiment behind the gift\nD) The color of the gift\nE) The price of the gift', '**Question 6:**\nWho appreciated the sentiment behind a gift according to the passage?\nA) Someone who only cares about expensive gifts\nB) Someone who values thoughtfulness\nC) Someone who prefers practical gifts\nD) Someone who dislikes surprises\nE) Someone who collects expensive items']"|"['** B) English history', '** C) Thoughtful gifts with special stories', '** C) She believed hers lacked grandeur', ""** D) Lava from Vesuvius, pebbles from Waterloo, and pressed buttercups from Anne Hathaway's cottage"", '** C) The sentiment behind the gift', '** B) Someone who values thoughtfulness']"
Betty carefully packed her gifts, including a mosaic pin for Cousin Hetty, the most expensive item. She thought of how Cousin Hetty rarely received presents and hoped she would be pleased. Despite having a loving family, Betty briefly felt envious of herself if she were in her cousin's shoes. As the journey with Cousin Carl neared its end, Betty felt both happy and sad.

The Little Colonel expressed her gratitude to the British captain with a bright smile, preferring to be tied up herself than to have Hero confined in the hold.

Three years later, I learned from the news about the devastating floods in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys that left thousands homeless. Bertie, who was only six at the time, heard about the children who were crying in the streets because they had no shelter or food. Without saying a word, he climbed up to the mantel and took down his small red savings-bank. Even though we were still living in a cabin and had managed to save a little money from good crops, Bertie poured out all his savings amounting to ninety-three cents. He then added his cherished tin soldiers and his grandmother's knitted mittens to the table. Bertie even sacrificed his Sunday clothes, a new suit, shoes, and cap, to show his gratitude to the Red Cross for their help during the floods. The gentleman in our group shared his experience with the Red Cross during the Mississippi floods of '82, where he witnessed the immense support and aid provided by the relief committees to those in need. Contributions poured in after the disaster, and the Red Cross efficiently distributed supplies to the affected communities. The Red Cross plays a crucial role in collecting and storing donations for immediate use during emergencies. The society's work is essential in ensuring that aid reaches those who need it most. Additionally, a physician in Bedford, Indiana, donated a vast tract of land to the American National Red Cross, a place dedicated to peace and disaster relief efforts.

Lloyd couldn't sleep, haunted by images of destruction and disasters. Betty tried to comfort her by sharing a funny story about a flooded table floating to the ceiling. But Lloyd's fears persisted, imagining the water rising around her. Betty then recited calming lines from a Quaker poet that eased Lloyd's mind. Later, as they crossed the ocean, Mrs. Sherman handed Lloyd a letter from Allison Walton, revealing that the Waltons had moved to a new house called The Beeches. The news brought excitement as Lloyd and her friends were close to the Walton family. The letter shared stories about the Waltons, including Ranald, the youngest army captain.

The Knight demands the spell that has enchanted the Prince, plucking seven golden plums from a silver apple-tree. As a result, the Prince is restored to his true form, and the grateful King rewards the Knight with the Princess's hand in marriage and half of his Kingdom. The Fairies rejoice in a chorus as the evil plans of the Ogre and Witch are thwarted. The Princess, in distress, pleads for help as the Ogre drags her and the Prince towards a tower, setting the stage for a thrilling and magical adventure.|"[""1.

"_Witch._ Pour drop by drop onto Prince Hero's tongue. Initially, he will bark. His hands and feet will transform into paws, making him appear as a dog. Seven drops will complete the change.

_Godmother._ You could not soften his heart of stone. He would keep you captive in his lair. Only Princess Winsome can undo your despair. I will climb the tower and, before the sunset fades, ask her to weave a counter charm with Love's Golden Thread. Take courage, dear Queen! Be strong! Love will always find a way!

A few miles away from Lloydsboro Valley, where a fast stream flows by the remains of an old paper-mill, there is a roaring waterfall that bubbles and splashes. Even during the dry summer months, it remains green and refreshing, with the mist from the waterfall revitalizing the ferns and turning the moss a vibrant emerald color. Nearby, in a sloping pasture surrounded by wooded hills, is an ideal spot for a small camp. Mrs. Walton and Miss Allison arrived there one warm afternoon with a wagon full of children for a camping trip. The kids scattered around like busy ants, exploring the area as preparations were made for their stay. Mrs. Walton remarked on the responsibility of looking after sixteen children in the woods for a week, but she was confident that keeping them occupied with games and activities would keep them out of trouble.|"['1.

At night, sleeping in narrow cots under tents with no roof was uncomfortable for the campers. The fear of snakes, lizards, bugs, and ants made it unsettling. They preferred the safety of a house. Upon reaching the camp, a well-laid supper-table greeted them. The girls and boys eagerly grabbed their seats, with Freddy showing his lack of manners. While some boys were seen as horrid and greedy, others showed chivalry. Betty found poetry inspiration in the soldier's cup and fork. Malcolm helped the group create rhymes, leading to a fun and silly game during dinner.
