Early humans lived in a world filled with fear and hunger, surrounded by enemies like wolves, bears, and sabre-toothed tigers. They left no homes or tools behind, only their bones, showing they existed over two thousand centuries ago. These humans had a basic understanding of the changing seasons, knowing winter led to spring, then summer for ripe fruits and corn, followed by animals preparing for hibernation in fall. Competition for food led to deadly fights, forcing some to flee. Eventually, a glacier descended, destroying the valley and its inhabitants. Those who survived had to adapt, learning to make clothing from animal fur to endure the cold. By hunting and utilizing resources wisely, they overcame challenges and thrived.|['1.

Long ago, man faced housing challenges. Animals sought shelter in dark caves, inspiring man to find a grotto to call home, even if it housed bats and insects. During thunderstorms, lightning struck trees, igniting forest fires. Man learned that fire provided warmth. The simplicity of these discoveries may seem amusing now, but they were groundbreaking then. The introduction of fire for warmth and cooking marked a leap in civilization. As man evolved, so did his living conditions. From caves to homes on stilts, his dwellings improved. With time, tools and weapons advanced, allowing man to thrive. The transition from caves to structured homes marked the beginning of history. Man's journey from basic survival to thriving communities showcases his resilience and adaptability over time.|"['1.

Long ago, a woman, tired of kitchen chores, noticed clay hardening in the sun. In modern times, we store food in jars and cans for future use. Man invented containers like iron gas-tanks and pots for this purpose. These inventions ensure we have food year-round. The story shifts to Egypt and western Asia, where civilizations thrived. Egyptians influenced language and math. Phoenicians and Jews spread moral laws. They built bridges and roads, ruling vast regions with order. Egyptians excelled in arts and sciences, writing books and teaching math. Their writing, once on temple walls, coffins, and papyrus, influenced alphabets. Despite their advancements, their language faded with Roman rule. French General Buonaparte's visit to Egypt in the 18th century helped decode ancient Egyptian writing.|['1.

During Napoleon Buonaparte's time, a young officer named Broussard was stationed at the fortress of St. Julien near the Rosetta River. Jean Francois Champollion, known as Champollion Junior, dedicated his life to deciphering ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. While his countrymen fought battles, Champollion focused on understanding the language of the Copts in Egypt. At nineteen, he became a History professor and began translating Egyptian writings. The Rosetta Stone, found by the English in 1801 and now in the British Museum, held clues. Hieroglyphics were sacred carvings created by Egyptian priests to preserve knowledge. Champollion's patient work unlocked the secrets of these ancient symbols, revealing stories of queens and farmers along the Nile.|"[""1.

"The word ""phonetic"" originates from Greek and refers to the study of speech sounds. It stems from the Greek word ""phone,"" meaning voice, also found in ""telephone."" Ancient Egyptians used phonetic writing, moving away from pictorial language. Their symbols evolved to represent sounds like ""fu"" or ""em,"" aiding in writing various topics easily. Living by the Nile, Egyptians developed a distinct identity, calling themselves ""remi."" Isolated by deserts and seas, they were insular, valuing their customs and gods over others.

In ancient Egypt, the powerful forces of nature were believed to be controlled by gods. Osiris, the god of all living things, was loved by his wife, Isis, and envied by his wicked brother, Seth. One day, Seth tricked Osiris into trying on a coffin-like suit and then shut him inside, throwing the coffin into the Nile. Isis, devastated by the loss of her husband, searched for his body. She found and reassembled Osiris, bringing him back to life. Osiris became the king of the underworld, where souls journey after death.

Long ago in Egypt, the deceased were given elaborate burials. The tombs were filled with cooking utensils, weapons, and statues of bakers and butchers to serve the dead. To ensure the safety of the mummy, a low brick wall surrounded the grave. One Egyptian, grieving for his mother, built a monumental structure atop her grave, towering hundreds of feet high. The King, not to be outdone, had a massive pyramid built for himself. Over a hundred thousand workers labored for twenty years to construct the grand tomb. The Nile played a crucial role in the organization of the Egyptian people into a well-regulated empire.

In ancient Egypt, every village had Village-Elders, wise old men who guided the community. In times of crisis, a strong man, chosen by the Elders, led the soldiers during wars and managed flood situations. This leader was given the title of a King or a prince, respected and obeyed for the common good. In return, he collected taxes to fund communal needs. This system of nobles evolved from simple beginnings. For instance, Mr. Fish, a successful farmer, sold his grain in Memphis, while Mr. Sparrow struggled due to past misfortunes. The Sparrow family's troubles stemmed from a past deception by a Phoenician trader, leaving them in dire need. This historical setup highlights the origins of leadership structures and the challenges faced by different members of society.|"['1.

Long ago, along the banks of the Nile, a humble farmer named Fish rose to become a powerful figure in Egypt. His descendants faced poverty as others like the Sparrow family grew prosperous. Civilization, always on the move, shifted in unpredictable directions. In Egypt, power shifted from Memphis to Thebes, uniting Upper and Lower Egypt. The rulers expanded their influence, conquering lands far and wide. They built infrastructure to control the mighty Nile's floods and encouraged learning in mathematics and astronomy. These ancient Egyptians even traded with foreign lands, a departure from tradition.

All human societies, including states and dynasties, follow patterns of growth and decline. The once-prosperous rulers of the Egyptian Empire, after four centuries of success, grew complacent. Rather than leading their army, they stayed secluded, enjoying music within their palace walls. When rumors of pillaging tribes surfaced, an army was sent but was annihilated by fierce Arab invaders. The Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, seized power for five centuries, ruling harshly. A Theban uprising led to their expulsion, but the lesson was learned: Egypt needed a strong defense. King Tethmosis expanded into Asia, but the empire weakened due to military focus. Assyria's rise led to Egypt's defeat, marking the decline of the once-great Egyptian Empire.|"['1.

In 1472, before Columbus found America, Venetian Josaphat Barbaro traveled through Persia and saw old temples cut into the hills near Shiraz. The temples were in ruins, but Barbaro noticed long inscriptions in a strange script that looked like scratches. He shared his discovery, but it was forgotten due to the threat of a Turkish invasion. Two centuries later, Roman Pietro della Valle visited the same hills and copied the inscriptions. In the 18th century, King Frederick V of Denmark led an expedition to western Asia, where all but one member died. Patient efforts by German schoolmaster Grotefend led to deciphering the inscriptions. Henry Rawlinson, serving in Persia, decoded the cuneiform language from the Behistun inscription. This solved a human mystery from the land of Sumer, revealing their worship practices and history.|"['1.

The Sumerians, a nomadic people who settled in Mesopotamia, built towers resembling hills to honor their gods. Babylon, visited by the Jews, had impressive towers from the Sumerian era. The Tower of Babel was a remnant of these structures. Mesopotamia was a melting pot, absorbing various tribes over centuries. The Akkadians, a Semitic tribe, conquered the Sumerians and lived harmoniously. Hammurabi, a ruler of Babylon, established an empire based on fair laws received from the Sun God.

In ancient times, the Assyrians under the rule of adventurous leaders like Bulu attempted to expand their empire. They conquered lands like Asia Minor, Armenia, Egypt, and Babylonia, ruling with cruelty and greed. However, their empire faced internal strife due to excess military focus over agriculture and governance issues. The Assyrians faced constant battles, depleting their soldiers and leading to the recruitment of foreign fighters who lacked loyalty. The Cimmerians, displaced by the Scythians, invaded Mesopotamia, causing havoc. Meanwhile, the Chaldeans from Ur waged war against the Assyrians. Nebuchadnezzar's reign saw the rebuilding of temples, palace constructions, and irrigation projects. The Babylonians conquered Egypt and destroyed Jerusalem, taking Jewish hostages. They also studied the skies, discovering the first five planets known as Jupiter, Venus, Mars, Mercury, and Saturn.|"['1.

The Babylonians were clever inventors who divided the equator into 360 degrees, the day into 24 hours, and the hour into 60 minutes. They used a sun-dial to measure time. They used both the decimal and duodecimal systems, with the latter accounting for 60 minutes and seconds and 24 hours. The decimal system we use today doesn't include these convenient divisions. Despite their intelligence, the Babylonians couldn't avoid their fate. Alexander the Great visited Babylon in 331 B.C., marking its decline. The Persians conquered the fertile valley, leading to Babylon's downfall. Babylon had been a spiritual and intellectual center for centuries. In Egypt, Joseph, a Hebrew, managed food distribution during a famine. The Egyptians, after overthrowing foreign rulers, disliked outsiders. Moses, a Jew, faced an Egyptian threat, highlighting tensions between the two groups.|"['1.

Long ago, the Jews and Egyptians faced a deadly disease. The Jews, who followed strict health laws learned in the desert, survived. In contrast, the Egyptians, weaker and not following these laws, suffered greatly. The Jews worshiped many gods, including animals revered by the Egyptians. Moses, having learned to honor the powerful God of the Storm, relied on divine protection. Palestine, a small land strip, was inhabited by the Canaanites, who were traders living in fortified cities. Initially, the Jews and Canaanites were at odds but eventually became allies against the Philistines, a European group that had settled on the Mediterranean shores. The Philistines posed a constant threat to the Jews, who fought many battles but struggled to maintain their independence.|['1.

The Jews fought bravely but were overpowered by the Assyrians, Egyptians, and Chaldeans. Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and the temple in 586 BC. The Jews rebuilt their shrine over 70 years, but it fell to a second invasion. Romans under Pompey took over in 65 BC, modernizing the city. Herod restored the temple, but it was neglected until the Romans set it on fire under Emperor Titus. The Romans misunderstood the Jewish faith, leading to further conflicts. Eventually, the Romans destroyed the city in response to Jewish rebellions. Despite its rich history, Jerusalem lies in ruins, a testament to the passage of time and the changing tides of history.|['1.

Damascus, once a humble fortified town, evolved into a bustling center of commerce. Initially settled by the Amorites, it later became a trading hub with the Hittites. Over time, the Aramaeans assimilated the original inhabitants. Despite these changes, Damascus remained a vital trade hub, strategically located on the route between Egypt and Mesopotamia. The Aramaeans, seeking efficient communication, developed a new alphabet, simplifying trade. Their language, Aramaean, became the lingua franca of the ancient world. The spirit of exploration drove pioneers beyond familiar horizons, risking the unknown. While some perished, the Phoenicians embraced the challenge, transforming the vast ocean into a safe passage for trade.|"['1.

Phoenician sailors, Semites from Arabia, built ancient cities like Tyre and Sidon. They sailed the Mediterranean, trading with far-off lands. Their trading posts in Europe attracted locals who marveled at the goods from the east. Over time, these posts grew into bustling marketplaces. Modern cities like Marseilles and Cadiz trace their roots to Phoenicia. However, the Phoenicians were known for shady practices, like trading slaves and cheating others. Despite being skilled navigators, their dishonesty led to their downfall when other nations learned to sail. Tyre and Sidon lost their commercial dominance due to their unethical ways. While ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia had unique writing systems, our modern alphabet is a mix of various influences. Its origins remain a mystery awaiting discovery through further research.|"['1.

In the past, I shared about the Aramaean traders' language, a common tongue in western Asia. Unlike the Phoenicians, whose language was not favored, their writing system spread widely. The Phoenicians, practical traders, developed a simple alphabet for efficient communication. Their alphabet, with only 22 letters, replaced complex hieroglyphics. This innovation, born out of necessity for quick business dealings, later influenced the Greeks. The Greeks adapted the alphabet to suit their language, adding new letters. This streamlined system, with vowels included, became popular and is now used worldwide for writing and passing down knowledge. Ancient civilizations along the Nile, in Mesopotamia, and the Mediterranean laid the foundation for our modern world, marking a shift from nomadic life to settled societies, exploration, and moral discoveries.|"[""1.
