Jack and Dick were students at an Academy in the highlands near the Hudson River. Jack, who had money for his education and to help his mother, was focused on his studies and didn't want distractions. The school term was over, but they were going to a summer camp arranged by Dr. Wise, the principal, for some outdoor fun and a bit of school work. Jack, interested in boats, had a plan. He fixed up an old rowboat with an engine, propeller, and lights, turning it into a new-looking vessel for less money. He surprised Dick with the boat's transformation, impressing his friend. They were excited to test out the boat's speed and enjoy their summer camp adventures.|"['1.

Jack and his friends boarded the boat. Percival observed Jack's expertise as he smoothly operated the engine and steered the boat down the river towards the railroad station. As they passed, two boys on the wharf taunted them, but Jack remained composed. The bullies threatened to throw them into the river, but Jack remained unfazed. Despite the provocations, Jack advised his friends to ignore them. As a steamer approached, the bullies' boat struggled in the waves, causing them distress. Percival, feeling indignant, wished to confront the bullies, but Jack advised against it. Despite the taunts, Jack skillfully navigated the boat, avoiding the steamer's path.

The boys visited the News office where Jack shared news items with the editor, typing them out while Percival watched in admiration. The bully threatened Jack for an accident involving Erne, but Percival cleverly pointed out the bully's own issues. The camp, located by the river near town, had a cheerful cook named Bucephalus. Colonel Bull oversaw physical training, while the professors handled academics. Many boys had boats, including Harry, Arthur, Herring, Merritt, and Percival. Percival's boat was lavish but slower than Jack's. Billy teased J.W., the smallest boy with a boat. The colonel reprimanded the bullies for a risky river incident. Herring accepted the colonel's decision, knowing it was fair.|"['1.

On a pleasant afternoon, Herring regretted boasting foolishly as he watched other boys enjoy boating on the river. Feeling left out, he realized that speed wasn't the only fun aspect of boating. Envious of Jack's skill and his own boat's superior performance compared to his expensive one, Herring plotted with Merritt to sabotage Jack's boat. Under the moonlit sky, some boys sailed their boats gracefully on the water, while Herring and Merritt sneaked out to tamper with Jack's boat. Startled by the noise, Jack intervened, and the boys were caught red-handed. Acknowledging the need for a watch, Jack offered a reward, and young Smith, who was inspecting the engine, revealed the culprits.

"""I'm glad you scared them off,"" Jack said. ""They could have caused a lot of damage. I would have noticed the hole when I put the boat in the water, unless they filled it with sand.""

Miss Margaret, a charming young lady, was adored by her father but puzzled her mother by preferring a practical career over high society. Her father praised the well-mannered Hilltop boys, contrasting them with typical boarding school behavior. Margaret defended the boys, understanding their curiosity about nature and fruit trees.

"""I believe so!"" Percival exclaimed passionately. ""You cannot predict the consequences of such actions. Imagine if the detective had apprehended you before you had a chance to explain? It would have been a lengthy process to clarify everything.""

Percival informed Jack that he was aiming for the poetic prize, which motivated Jack to put in his best efforts instead of feeling envious. On the night of the competition, Billy felt restless due to an upset stomach. He followed a dark figure in the camp but couldn't determine if it was a burglar or a dream.

""Everything seems to connect well, Art,"" said Harry. ""Pete Herring has always harbored animosity towards Jack since his arrival. Do you recall Jack's clever response to Pete's disrespectful question about his deceased father?""
