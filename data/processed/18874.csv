""The wood and foliage of coniferous trees like spruce, fir, and pine are so full of turpentine and resin that they burn like tinder. The heat is almost beyond the power of words to express. The fire does not seem to burn in a steady manner, the flames just breathe upon an immense tree and it becomes a blackened skeleton which will burn for hours.""

""The actual temperature in advance of the fire is so terrific that the woods begin to dry and to release inflammable vapors before the flames reach them, when they flash up and add their force to the fiery hurricane.

Forestry and bullying may seem unrelated, but as the Chief Forester explains, they share surprising similarities. Just like a school is made up of different boys, a forest consists of various trees, each with its individuality. In schools and forests alike, there are individuals of different values. Some boys or trees may be bigger but less valuable, often crowding out the more worthy ones. A Forester's duty is to ensure the valuable trees have the best chance to thrive, just like teachers nurture students. By understanding how to manage trees for optimal growth, Foresters can shape forests much like educators guide schools. This comparison sheds light on the importance of proper care and attention to help the best qualities shine in both schools and forests.|"['1.

In the forest, trees grow differently based on their surroundings. Trees in ravines with little wind and light have shallow roots and thin trunks, while those in dense forests grow tall but weak. When trees on the forest edge are cut down, inner trees are vulnerable to strong winds. Even losing a branch can lead to decay from insects and fungi. To prevent inner trees from falling, leave deep-rooted trees on the outside. Just like riding a pony, acting without thinking can lead to trouble. Wilbur learned this the hard way when the sorrel pony bucked him off. Despite the wild ride, he kept trying to stay on until the inevitable fall. It's important to consider consequences before acting, whether in the forest or on a horse.|['1.

The chestnut horse began bucking and kicking with even more energy. Bob-Cat calmly rolled a cigarette while staying on the horse effortlessly. He then dismounted and spoke to the boy, mentioning others who were better riders. Bob-Cat advised against buying the horse for forest work. After supper, Wilbur felt sore from the ride and went to bed. The next morning, he saddled his horses and bid farewell to Bob-Cat before meeting the Ranger. As they rode through the desert, Wilbur asked about the Ranger's hunting skills. The landscape transitioned from barren slopes to wooded areas with towering peaks.

The Ranger shared fascinating insights about wolves with Wilbur during their ride. He explained that wolves, while not typically dangerous to humans, can be surly and savage when cornered. In the Rockies, wolves rarely attack people, with only two instances involving lost children. The Ranger mentioned a Russian trapper's tales of Siberian wolves preying on travelers, especially horses. Despite being mean critters, wolves mostly trouble sheep rather than cattle. The Ranger then stopped at a shack where a tall woman, accustomed to rural life, expressed discomfort in crowded towns. She found cities overwhelming due to the bustling crowds and lack of personal connection. The woman preferred the spaciousness of rural areas where she felt more at ease, likening herself to her hogs in size.|"['1.

The Ranger abruptly paused his horse and continued ahead on the trail, lost in memories. The boy wisely stayed quiet. As the afternoon progressed, they left the foothills for a forest trail. The shadows grew long, evening approaching. The Ranger chose a spot by a ravine with tall pine trees for camp. Wilbur and the horses were tired. The Ranger suggested Wilbur camp further at a settlement. Wilbur was excited about his first open-air camp. After unsaddling the horses, Wilbur prepared beds with fir branches.

In front of him, near the spring, sat a large wild-cat, with twitching ears and a rabbit under her claws. When Wilbur approached, the cat was unable to move the rabbit due to a root holding it in place. Wilbur hesitated, unsure of what to do. Despite having a revolver, he was not a sharp shooter and feared provoking the wild-cat. The cat showed signs of aggression, and Wilbur was scared but determined to get water from the spring. Remembering an old fable about wild animals fearing human eye contact, Wilbur stared at the cat. As the cat struggled to free the rabbit, Wilbur grew angry and decided to advance with his revolver, causing the cat to retreat.

Wilbur found himself in a difficult situation, holding a pot of water in one hand and a rabbit in the other. As a wild cat leaped towards him, a stick he was carrying accidentally hit the cat, diverting its attack. The cat landed on Wilbur's leg instead of his neck, causing injuries. Despite being wounded, Wilbur managed to fire his revolver at the cat, eventually taking it down. A Ranger arrived, assessing Wilbur's injuries as minor. The Ranger advised Wilbur against getting involved in hunting prey, emphasizing the risks involved.

The lumberman compared cutting down a tree to graduation, explaining how the tree had grown and matured like a student before being used for timber. He emphasized the importance of conservation and replanting new trees to sustain the forest. The Supervisor highlighted the value of forest nurseries in nurturing young seedlings, drawing a parallel to caring for children. Wilbur expressed interest in transforming forests by removing inferior trees and promoting the growth of superior ones. The Supervisor mentioned how different forest workers find various aspects of forest management fascinating, such as combating tree diseases or transforming tree species.

Once, while I was a Ranger in the Gunnison Forest, I encountered a trespassing man who had cut Douglas fir telephone poles on government land. When I confronted him, he became aggressive, brandishing a Winchester rifle in a threatening manner. Sensing danger, I swiftly disarmed him near a waterfall, ensuring our safety. I then seized the poles and reported the incident to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The Commissioner tasked me with negotiating a settlement with the trespasser. When the trespasser refused, he and his son challenged me to a fight. However, I stood my ground and gave them a final ultimatum.

The head ranger had planned to accompany Wilbur to show him his assigned range, but instead, Rifle-Eye would guide him. Wilbur was advised to ride different horses daily, as they were crucial for the job. He was to cover three trails over three days to patrol his area effectively. The Supervisor emphasized the importance of promptly reporting fires and not engaging in timber sales monitoring. The focus was on efficiently managing the forest for the nation's benefit. Wilbur was reminded that forest work was not just about the picturesque aspect but a serious business. The use of the telephone had been instrumental in preventing disasters.

The tent is close to a spring, providing access to a nearby lake with plenty of trout. There's a cache of flour, groceries, and canned goods, along with a small garden from the previous Guard. Seeds are available upon request. Shooting rabbits is an option, although they may not be in prime condition currently. The Irishman wishes them luck and plans to start a fire to deter any logjamming trouble. Even though only a day has passed, it feels like more time due to the events. The Ranger explains that McGinnis, an expert lumberman, is hired for short periods to assist with timber sales.

Just like what you did before. There's a slight difference where people have traveled, maybe just a few small plants have been stepped on, and there's a path between the trees that's a bit straighter than an animal's trail. It's so faint that the more you think about it, the less certain you become. But eventually, you reach a point where you can't help but follow it in any weather. The old hunter, realizing the need to teach Wilbur about the pine forests, gave him hints all the way to his camp. When they arrived, Wilbur was thrilled. The camp, close to a spring bubbling from the hillside, offered a view of a lake shimmering like a silver fish in the sunlight. A flagstaff with a flag ready stood nearby, and a telephone was attached to a tree for communication.

That entire day was an eye-opener for Wilbur, showing him the beauty and vastness of the forest he was responsible for overseeing. The Ranger took him off the main path to visit miners' cabins and Indian shacks, emphasizing the importance of kindness. Despite the late return to camp, Wilbur was thrilled with his tent home. The Ranger taught him about keeping the stream clean and the consequences of polluting it. After supper, Wilbur prepared his daily report and started writing a letter but soon felt sleepy. The Ranger advised him to rest for the next day's work to protect his eyesight. The following days were spent riding trails, meeting settlers, and learning the forest landmarks. On Sunday, the Ranger left Wilbur to work independently, promising to visit occasionally. Wilbur bid farewell, grateful for the guidance and looking forward to future meetings.|"[""1.

"When they arrived at the mill, they exchanged greetings with some of the workers, engaging in friendly teasing with McGinnis. The Supervisor requested to meet the boss, and Peavey Jo emerged. Wilbur could tell from his appearance and demeanor that Peavey Jo was of French descent, possibly with a hint of Native American heritage. Wilbur, having spent time in lumber camps up north, recognized the type. Following Merritt's advice, he decided to speak cautiously.

A smile spread among the mill workers, indicating some were aware of the trespass and admired Peavey Jo's cunning. As the men conversed, Ben, the local boy with limited understanding, approached Wilbur and whispered. Meanwhile, Merritt and Peavey Jo eyed each other. Suddenly, Ben intervened before a conflict could escalate, preventing a punch aimed at the Supervisor.

The fight took a different turn as McGinnis remained focused and composed despite the intense blows coming his way. His agility and precision dodges kept him safe until he seized the perfect moment to deliver a powerful uppercut that knocked down his opponent, Peavey Jo. While McGinnis was concerned about the impact of his blow, the Supervisor turned his attention back to the logs' location, which led to the confrontation. Ben, who had faced the lumberman's anger earlier, hesitated to reveal the information but eventually shared it when he saw Peavey Jo still recovering.

The journey back was unusually quiet. McGinnis and the simple lad were both silent, with Ben nursing a swollen jaw and McGinnis feeling weak from the fight. The Supervisor was upset that things had turned physical, but he understood McGinnis' actions. Upon reaching base, the horses were stabled, and the men prepared supper. Merritt began a detailed report for Washington, while McGinnis and Ben rested. During dinner, Wilbur praised McGinnis for the fight outcome. McGinnis acknowledged the lad's strength but shared concerns about potential retaliation. He then recounted vivid tales of lumber camp life. The next day, Wilbur returned to his camp, eager to resume his fire patrols.

That night he called headquarters to report putting out the fire. However, he was gently scolded for not investigating its cause and advised to ride back the next day to look into it. The following evening, as he sat down for dinner, the phone rang, and the Supervisor was on the line. The boy explained that the fire was started by city fishermen who lacked a guide. He guided them on proper fire-making. The next day, Wilbur was surprised to find a serious gathering at headquarters. They were concerned about the spread of Rifle-Eye beetles in the forest.

In a casual chat, Rifle-Eye discussed Cholera, a peculiar disease that moves through a city in a unique manner, affecting one side of a street at a time. He likened it to a wandering spirit. However, he doubted the theory, especially when he found wagon tracks leading to the affected spots. Wilbur, after a short stay at headquarters, helped trace the wagon that brought infected trees into the forest. This led to the discovery of all the places where diseased trees were planted. Wilbur had to inspect the area weekly to ensure the threat was contained. Despite the added workload, he diligently patrolled the forest for bark-beetles.

Wilbur, a diligent forest ranger, found himself in a tricky situation when a group of campers disregarded the danger of starting a forest fire with their fireworks. Despite his efforts to warn them, they brushed off his concerns. Determined to prevent any harm, Wilbur decided to keep a close eye on the campers until they left the forest area. He even sought help from an old Ranger to address the situation. Despite facing resistance from the stubborn campers, Wilbur remained patient and tried to build a friendly rapport with them to steer them away from their risky behavior.

Once again, the well-known teacher shared his thoughts on the Ranger's involvement in the forest, expressing more annoyance since entering the woods than if he had stayed out. He grew very angry. Rifle-Eye calmly responded: The educator fell into the trap, passionately describing his views on helping the poor and modern plans for better living conditions. When he paused, he seemed pleased with himself. Rifle-Eye then pointed out the educator's hypocrisy, stating that actions speak louder than words. The Ranger, not well-versed in social economics, emphasized the importance of politeness. He criticized the professor for threatening a boy and behaving poorly.

Wilbur and his chief worked hard to clear a trail through the brushwood. Merritt, the chief, showed Wilbur how to work efficiently and save energy. After a long day's work, they finished five miles of trail. The Supervisor then sent Wilbur to fish at a nearby lake. Wilbur caught four trout and they had a good meal. The next day, they completed the remaining four miles of the trail by noon. Merritt explained the importance of forestry to Wilbur, sharing the value of different tree species and the potential of wood byproducts.

On the way back home and during dinner, the Supervisor chatted non-stop. The boy, however, couldn't shake off the dream he had about a perfect future where every piece of land in the United States was used wisely. He envisioned the dry land being irrigated from mountain streams, rivers navigable without floods, farms with well-tended wood-lots, and forests covering every inch of the hills and mountains. Despite his dreams, the next morning Wilbur was up at five, facing the harsh reality of another day's work. A thunderstorm had left everything fresh but wet, and Wilbur had to wrangle the horses in the soggy underbrush. When they set out, Merritt's horse, known for being difficult, began to buck. Wilbur realized the challenging nature of the Supervisor's riding skills compared to what he had seen before. They rode to an unfamiliar part of the forest, coming across a young pine plantation and later encountering a herd of cattle being driven by two cowboys. Merritt stopped to chat with them, emphasizing the importance of building friendly relationships with people in the forest.|"['1.

After riding down the road for about a mile, it became steep, and Wilbur saw potential trouble ahead. As they approached a spot where the bridge was under repair, the bank on the right side dropped sharply, forty to fifty feet deepening with each step forward. Merritt and Wilbur, along with the cowpunchers, slowed down as they neared the bridge. Grier and Rodgers crossed first, then Merritt followed, dividing the cattle into two groups. Wilbur was instructed to gradually increase the pace to avoid overcrowding. However, Kit, the horse he was riding, sensed fear among the steers. Wilbur contemplated maneuvering to the front of the herd but realized the risk of being forced over the edge. As the road widened, he saw Grier and Rodgers waiting, assessing the situation. Wilbur found himself between a group of steers and the main herd, with a valley below and a tent by the creek. He realized the danger if the steers started running and focused on keeping the two herds apart to avoid a stampede.|['1.

In a fleeting moment, the boy sensed a shift. The steers grew uneasy, and he knew Kit could sense his fear. When a horse feels the rider's fright, chaos looms. Wilbur's wits remained, but panic brewed. The herd closed in, the pace quickened, and a stampede erupted. As the steers thundered, Wilbur's nerves stilled, calming Kit with voice and touch. Amid the frenzy, he found himself teetering near the cliff's edge. With no escape route, he braced for the worst. A menacing steer lunged at Kit, provoking Wilbur to act. A shot rang out, sending the steer plummeting. Kit leaped into safety, evading disaster. Racing ahead, Wilbur spotted two oblivious figures in their path. Merritt's swift intervention averted catastrophe, rescuing the man and boy just in time. Amid the chaos, Merritt's heroics shone, ensuring their narrow escape from peril.|"['1.

For a few nervous moments, Wilbur observed the ground below his horse's hooves, but glimpses of the dusty road revealed nothing. Once more, Wilbur was pushed to the road's edge, but the cliff was getting shallower, and they were only twenty feet above the valley. A hillock suddenly rose a couple of hundred feet ahead, almost reaching the road level. Wilbur decided to guide the pony towards it, hoping for safety. He reined the pony hard, leaped from the saddle, and led her to the jump. The pony landed safely, but Wilbur, unable to estimate the jump, landed in a heap and tumbled down the hill, unconscious. Kit nudged him back to consciousness, and weakly, he mounted her. They cantered across the valley to meet the tired herd, herding them back with the help of others. Despite injuries, Wilbur insisted on going back to find Merritt. On their way, they encountered the Supervisor, who praised Wilbur for his bravery during the stampede.|"[""1.

The supervisor rode ahead, leading the way. After a while, they rode in a line, and despite the boy's claim of being fine, the sun made his head ache and body stiff. A cabin appeared, and the boy asked for water. The doctor's laughter filled the house, contagious even to the boy. The doctor's wife tended to the boy's wound gently.

A couple of years after, Burns started to intrude on the minds of some friends. When it got out that a specific drink could enhance these dreams, the camp quickly ran out of it. I tried it myself, it's potent stuff. The boys started dreaming that Burns appeared to them, pointing to the ground. They all went in different directions, but I wasn't convinced. Two years ago, I found the bones of an old mule with a saddle, likely Burns's. It gave me a sense of direction. The days got hotter, Wilbur hoped for rain, but the sky stayed clear. He abandoned his routine to patrol every other day, straining the horses. One day, he found campers in the forest, panicked by the risk of fires. He rode to meet them, relieved to see they were cautious. They invited him to join them, easing their fears of his arrival.|['1.

Wilbur was certain and hurried toward his horse. He paused halfway, then relaxed his muscles in the shade. He reached the cliff's edge, scanned the area with his glasses, and confirmed his suspicions. He rode back to his horse, checked the gear, and rode to the cliff's edge again. He saw a dull dark silver gleam, indicating vapor. As he rode, he felt a sense of urgency, with the forest seemingly urging him to hurry. Despite wanting to rush, he remembered Merritt's advice not to push the horse too hard. He resisted the urge to use the whip, focusing on guiding the horse safely. After two hours of riding, he left the trail and navigated through challenging terrain. The exhilaration of the ride was interrupted by the smell of smoke, signaling the fire's proximity. Wilbur tied his horse securely, equipped his climbing irons, and ascended a tall tree to assess the situation.|"[""1.

The fire was closer than Wilbur thought. The smoke rose for at least half a mile, but the flames couldn't cross the gully. Wilbur needed to act fast. He climbed down a tree in a hurry, almost slipping. His horse was scared, neighing frantically. Wilbur calmed the horse and rode down the gully. They reached a stream, and the horse refused to cross. Wilbur, desperate, used the spurs and even struck the horse with a quirt for the first time. The horse finally leaped into the stream, and Wilbur urged him across, holding on tightly. The horse climbed the opposite bank, trembling but safe. They had crossed the gully, escaping the fire.|['1.

Wilbur hurriedly crossed the little stream and galloped along the gully towards the fire. He rode until he reached the end of the mile-long fire, where flames leaped among the needles. He guided his horse down the creek, making his way to the other side where the bank was steep. Wilbur then tied up his horse, grabbed a shovel, and started beating the fire with it. His hands blistered, his lips parched, but he kept going, working tirelessly to put out the fire. As the afternoon wore on, the wind began to rise, threatening to spread the flames. Despite his exhaustion, Wilbur fought on, determined to contain the fire. As darkness fell, he raced against time, battling the wind and flames to prevent further damage. Despite his worn-out shoes and fatigue, he chased down a spreading fire, fighting to save the forest from the blaze.|"['1.

Wilbur, a young boy, felt sick and heartbroken as he struggled to hold back tears. Despite feeling stunned and fatigued, his determination pushed him forward. He returned to his horse and headed home, feeling like a traitor for leaving a fire he couldn't conquer. On his way, he spotted another fire in the distance. He called the Ranger for help, reporting two fires. The Ranger advised him to keep trying and get back to work. Wilbur quickly prepared, mounted his horse Kit, and rode off into the night. Exhausted, he fell asleep in the saddle, relying on Kit to lead him in the right direction. The Ranger later praised Wilbur for taking a brief rest, acknowledging the importance of staying alert during the night.|"['1.

Wilbur attempted to recount the fire incident but soon became confused. As they rode, his story faded, and he fell asleep. The old hunter stayed close, ready to catch him if needed. Rifle-Eye woke him as they veered off the trail into the forest. Wilbur felt better but noticed his hands and feet hurt. He realized they were near the fire and expressed relief at sleeping most of the way. The old hunter reassured him, hinting at a plan to halt the fire. They approached the fire's glow in the distance. Wilbur saw the raging fire consuming the forest. The old hunter swiftly dug a furrow to contain the fire's advance.

Wilbur was tirelessly working to put out a fire that had started in the forest. As he reached the top of a ridge and saw the fire spreading, his energy returned. He quickly approached a hunter nearby and informed him about the situation. The hunter explained that they needed help from axmen to contain the fire. Wilbur was tasked with riding to Pete's mine to gather more hands. Despite his exhaustion, Wilbur mounted his mare and set off. He navigated through the burnt forest, with flames on either side. Eventually, he encountered a group of horsemen led by the Supervisor. Together, they rode towards the hill to confront the fire. As they rode, the Supervisor questioned the origin of the fire, a thought that had not crossed Wilbur's mind until then.|"[""1.

"The Ranger warned, ""You ain't got much chance."" He suggested they move to the ridge on the other side of the river to hold off the fire. The Ranger left, and the other party hurried towards the mill. There was chaos at the mill; everyone was working to save it from the approaching fire. The horses were taken, lumber wet down, and buildings soaked. Peavey Jo was bellowing orders, blaming the Supervisor for the fire's spread. Wilbur, exhausted, kept working mechanically.

In a dramatic turn of events, a massive tree near a bridge suddenly exploded, sending a flaming branch crashing down, blocking the path. The horses panicked, but the experienced miner calmed them. Quickly, the miner and Merritt mounted the horses, racing against time as the bridge started to smoke. With a burst of courage, they spurred the horses to leap over the fiery obstacle. On the other side, they saw the mill untouched by the forest fire, yet flames were visible inside. As they watched in shock, a figure emerged from the mill and ran towards the bridge. The bridge collapsed, but the brave boy, Ben, managed to free some timbers and rode them downstream to safety. Despite the danger, the men stayed, relieved as Ben escaped the flames. The Supervisor, angered by Peavey Jo's words, vowed to save the boy and rode down the river trail, leaving a tense atmosphere behind.|"['1.

As the wind howled fiercely, a raging fire approached, threatening to trap Peavey Jo and his companions. With the flames closing in, they spurred their horses to escape.
