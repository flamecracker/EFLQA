The clerk assured Scrooge he would, and Scrooge left with a grumble. The office closed swiftly, and the clerk, with his white scarf trailing, slid down Cornhill, celebrating Christmas Eve. Then he dashed home to Camden Town to play blindman's buff. Scrooge had a somber dinner at his usual tavern, read the newspapers, and occupied the evening with his accounts before retiring to bed. He lived in dark chambers that once belonged to his late partner, in a gloomy building that seemed out of place. The yard was so dim that even Scrooge, familiar with it, had to feel his way.

In his cozy room, Scrooge ensured everything was in place. No one hiding under tables or beds, just a small fire crackling in the grate. With his gruel simmering, he double-locked the door, an unusual move for him. As he settled by the fire, the warmth was scarce from the dwindling flames. The fireplace, adorned with Dutch tiles depicting biblical scenes, failed to distract him from the haunting image of Marley's face. Suddenly, a disused bell in the room began to swing, followed by a clamor of bells throughout the house. A heavy chain dragging noise emerged, and then, Marley's ghostly figure appeared before Scrooge's eyes.

Scrooge was skeptical even as he examined the ghost closely, trying to deny what his senses told him. The ghost sat down, unfazed by Scrooge's disbelief.
