The first place I remember well was a pleasant meadow with a clear water pond. On one side, there was a plowed field, and on the other, our master's house stood by the roadside. When I was young, I lived on my mother's milk and couldn't eat grass. We spent our days running together, and at night, I slept close to her. During hot days, we sought shade by the pond, and in the cold, we had a warm shed near the grove. There were six older colts in the meadow, and we used to gallop around the field together. One day, my mother advised me to be well-mannered and gentle, as we were bred from a good lineage. Our master was kind, providing us with good food and lodging. He treated us with kindness, just like he did with his children.|"[""1.

"When I was just a toddler, something unforgettable occurred. It was a crisp spring morning with a light mist in the air. The colts and I were grazing in the field when we heard what seemed like the baying of hounds. The eldest colt perked up, recognizing the sound and exclaimed, ""The hounds are on a hunt!"" We all galloped to the upper field to catch a glimpse of the action. The dogs and men on horseback were in hot pursuit of a hare, creating a ruckus. Amidst the chaos, tragedy struck as two horses fell near the brook. My mother, an old and wise horse, pondered the senselessness of the hunt, questioning why men engage in such perilous pursuits. It was a moment of both excitement and sadness, a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in the thrill of the chase."|['1.

One day, while I was growing into a handsome horse, a tragic event unfolded. Young Gordon, a lad from the neighborhood, had a terrible accident while riding his black horse, Rob Roy. The farrier, Bond, discovered that Rob Roy's leg was broken and had to be put down. The sorrowful news spread quickly, and soon a somber procession of black horse-drawn carriages arrived to carry young Gordon to his final resting place. The church bell tolled mournfully as they made their way to the graveyard. My mother, deeply saddened by the loss of Rob Roy, vowed never to return to that part of the field.

My owner proceeded to train me for harness work. I had to wear various new items like a stiff collar around my neck, blinkers that limited my side vision, and a saddle with an uncomfortable strap under my tail called a crupper. Despite my initial dislike, I adapted to these changes over time. One beneficial part of my training involved spending time in a meadow near a railway, where I encountered trains for the first time. Initially frightened by the loud noises and speed of the trains, I eventually grew accustomed to them. Thanks to this exposure, I am now calm around trains. My mother also played a crucial role in my training, teaching me to behave well and always aim to please my owner. Eventually, I was taken to a spacious stable with excellent amenities, including a box stall where I was left loose to move freely.|"['1.

Merrylegs, a handsome horse, introduced himself to a new horse moving in next door. He warned the new horse, named Ginger, about Ginger's habit of biting. Merrylegs explained that Ginger had a tough past and might be ill-tempered because of it. However, Merrylegs hoped that the new horse, who had never bitten anyone, would get along well with Ginger.

"The next day, I was presented to my master. I recalled the advice from my mother and my kind old master, and I endeavored to follow his instructions precisely. I noticed that he was a skilled rider and considerate towards his horse. Upon his return, his wife greeted him at the entrance. ""Well, my dear,"" she inquired, ""how do you find him?"" Later, when John entered the stable, he informed James that the master and mistress had chosen a meaningful name for me. They chuckled, and James remarked, ""If it wasn't for evoking the past, I might have named him Rob Roy, for I have never seen two horses more alike."" ""That's no surprise,"" John replied. ""Didn't you know that Farmer Grey's old Duchess was the mother of both?"" This revelation astonished me; thus, poor Rob Roy, who met his end during the hunt, was my sibling! It was no wonder my mother was so distressed. John took great pride in me; he meticulously groomed my mane and tail, speaking to me frequently.

"John stood beside me, gently stroking my neck as I felt the heat weighing me down. The doctor emerged with his riding-whip, but John assured him, ""Black Beauty will keep going. Please take care of him, sir; I wouldn't want any harm to befall him."" The journey back was tough, with the doctor not being as skilled a rider as John. Despite my exhaustion, I pushed myself to the limit. As we reached the park, the doctor allowed me to catch my breath.

Miss Jessie, Flora, and their governess bid farewell, hugging Merrylegs fondly. Master had sold Ginger and me, but Merrylegs was gifted to the vicar under the condition he'd never be sold. Joe was to care for him. The last day arrived as the footman and luggage had departed. The carriage was readied for the final journey.

At the station, the mistress blessed John, and the train departed, leaving heavy hearts. The next day, Joe took Merrylegs to the vicarage.

We were led to a bright, airy stable and settled into boxes next to each other. John and York, the new coachman, examined us carefully. John praised us, but mentioned our differences. The black horse had a gentle temperament, while the chestnut had a more irritable disposition due to past mistreatment. York understood the challenge of keeping all grooms consistent. They discussed using a check-rein, which the black horse had never worn, and the dealer blamed for the chestnut's temper. York preferred loose reins but acknowledged the need for a check-rein for appearances. The next day, Lord W---- approved of us, considering us suitable for the carriage. We were harnessed, and my lady, a tall and stern woman, inspected us before getting into the carriage. Despite the check-rein being new and slightly uncomfortable, we adapted.|"['1.

York, the stableman, respectfully adjusted the reins on the horses, explaining they hadn't been used to it for years. The lady insisted on a quicker adjustment, causing Ginger, one of the horses, to rebel. She reared and kicked, causing chaos. York managed to calm her down and attend to the injured horse, who was sore and upset. The lady's impatience and insistence on tightening the reins caused distress among the horses. The stableman, York, was left to deal with the aftermath, realizing the consequences of the lady's demands.

Lord W--- was upset when he found out what had happened. He blamed York for giving in to his mistress, but York stated that he would prefer to only take orders from Lord W--- in the future. I thought York could have defended the horses better, but maybe I'm not the best judge. Ginger never rode in the carriage again. Once she healed, one of Lord W---'s younger sons expressed interest in having her as a hunter. Meanwhile, I continued to ride in the carriage with a new partner named Max. Max had always been used to a tight rein. He explained that dealers and horse-doctors know that buyers prefer horses to carry their heads high and step high. This unnatural position caused me discomfort, making me froth at the mouth and struggle to breathe. Although I was well-treated, I had no friend to help me. I was among various horses, some in good condition and others worn out and neglected. Buyers examined us closely, some showing compassion while others were indifferent.|"['1.

There was a man at the fair who caught my attention. He wasn't a gentleman, but his small, well-made frame and quick movements showed his familiarity with horses. His gentle manner and kind gray eyes appealed to me. His fresh scent, unlike that of beer and tobacco, made me like him instantly. He offered twenty-three pounds for me, which was declined. As other potential buyers came and went, the man returned and bid twenty-four pounds, sealing the deal. He led me out of the fair to an inn, where he prepared a saddle and bridle. After a good feed of oats, we embarked on a journey to London, passing through scenic lanes until we reached the bustling city.

My first week as a cab horse in London was tough. The noise and rush of the city made me anxious, but my driver, Jerry, was kind and caring. He never harshly whipped me and always made sure I was comfortable. In the stable, he provided us with movable bars for freedom of movement, kept us clean, and gave us plenty of food and water. Sundays were our rest days, much needed after a hard week's work. The winter brought cold and wet weather, making it challenging for us horses. Slippery streets were especially hard on us, straining our muscles and balance. Despite the tough conditions, there were kind people like the gentleman who appreciated our hard work and comfort. Jerry and I developed a strong bond, understanding each other like only a horse and man can.|"['1.
