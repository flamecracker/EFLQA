Rosanna lived in a beautiful home in Louisville, a city known for its stunning houses. Her house, made of red brick, had wide front and side porches. The house had a large garden on the right, surrounded by a high stone wall for privacy. At the back of the garden was a garage covered in vines, big enough for four cars. Next to the garden, there was a small cottage built just for Rosanna, where she kept her dolls and played. Additionally, there was a stable for her tiny pony with a shiny cart. Rosanna had a schoolroom in the house, but she didn't like it since she was the only student.

Rosanna's situation was indeed pitiful. Her dear, loving parents were no longer alive, leaving her in the care of her proud and stern grandmother, Mrs. Horton. Despite having a young uncle who could have been a source of comfort, he was distant due to being away at college and then in the army. Rosanna's only communication with him was through letters, which her grandmother closely monitored. Mrs. Horton, consumed by family pride, isolated Rosanna from other children, believing they were beneath her.

Children filled the street: little girls played with dolls on doorsteps, while others happily walked in groups or skipped rope. Boys on bicycles circled around, shouting to each other. Passing through a poorer part of the city, they found the same joy among the less well-dressed children. Despite their differences in attire, they all shared a carefree look in their eyes. Rosanna watched longingly as Mrs. Horton noticed her gaze. During lunch, Mrs. Horton mentioned that Rosanna should try to meet the girl living over the garage, implying it would be impossible due to the window arrangement. After Mrs. Horton left for a bridge party, Rosanna pondered about the mysterious child.

"Father constructed a small ladder and secured it to the tree trunk using wires to avoid damaging the wood. With Mrs. Horton's approval, he plans to install a tiny platform in this splendid spot. I can then study here, where it's cool, breezy, and filled with whispers from the leaves. Don't you enjoy the sound of leaves whispering? He intends to add a railing to prevent us from falling off. 

The little girl shared, ""Mother believes it's unfortunate that I don't have many friends. She says I must make more friends to avoid becoming selfish. Wouldn't you dislike being selfish? I imagine you have many girls to play with. Your beautiful garden must bring joy to everyone! Mother says we should share things with others, just like sharing two big red apples. Giving one away makes you feel good everywhere. Do girls visit you daily?""

The stranger responded, ""Why learn negative things from other girls? You should only learn what you want. Teaching them good grammar and avoiding slang would be nice. My mother says if you're like putty, you'll remain unshapely, but if you're like good stone, you can become something beautiful. Your grandmother's perspective is different. Where's your mother? Is she away visiting?""

Rosanna happily skipped to Helen's house, eager to practice the piano. She admired Helen's clean appearance and lovely features, dreaming of having a dimple like hers. As Rosanna played the scales, a nagging thought about her grandmother's approval of her friendship with a girl from the garage crept into her mind.

"Rosanna never considered it before, but now it felt childish and dependent. She resolved to dress herself from now on. To change the topic, she suggested, ""Why don't you come down to the garden? I'd like to show you my playhouse and the pony."" Rosanna heard light footsteps approaching from the stairs to the apartment above the garage. She sat on the rustic bench, waiting patiently. It felt like a long wait before Helen finally appeared at the small gate in the wall. Helen explained, ""She didn't mention _you_ specifically. She said I could invite anyone, and I chose you. It's fine. You can ask Minnie; she heard her say I could have company."" Helen reassured Rosanna, ""I'll go inform my mother. She wasn't sure if I should come."" After disappearing through the gate again, Rosanna waited, feeling uneasy.

Her grandmother judged people based on their family background. Rosanna, feeling guilty, decided to inquire about Helen's family, even though it seemed impolite. Perhaps Helen had a family, which could resolve everything harmoniously. Holding hands, the girls skipped toward the playhouse, Helen's bobbed blonde hair gleaming in the sunlight while Rosanna's dark, long hair swayed as she danced. Helen moved around in a daze,"|"[""1.

Both girls were stunned by the sight before them. Minnie paused her work as the cries echoed around them. The wails were strong and accompanied by deep sobs, creating a symphony of sorrow.

The kids devoured ham sandwiches, lettuce and egg sandwiches, hard-boiled eggs, crackers, olives, fruit salad, and very thin iced tea with lemon. As they ate, the younger ones warmed up, chatting excitedly. Myron, usually quiet, had hidden food under the tablecloth. When caught, he defended himself, insisting on taking the leftovers home to share with his family. Mary gently explained it wasn't polite, but Myron insisted, holding onto his treasures.

Once, two young boys named Walter and Harold were on a long journey to their new home out West. They were allowed to bring their beloved kitten along under the condition that they took care of her during the trip. The boys packed everything they needed, including food and milk for the kitten. On the train, they played with the kitten when the conductor wasn't around. However, during a stop at a station, an exciting distraction made the boys forget about the kitten. She wandered off and was mistaken for a stray by the brakeman, who put her off the train. The boys were heartbroken, but after a long ride, the brakeman surprised them by finding the kitten hanging on outside the train.

Helen pondered quietly. She was a truthful and sincere girl, feeling a bit out of place with Mrs. Hargrave. While Rosanna accepted her regardless of wealth or status, Helen sensed a difference with Mrs. Hargrave. The thought of her background being revealed troubled Helen. Despite her efforts, the conversation never steered in the direction she desired. However, a delightful idea emerged. Mrs. Hargrave suggested a carriage ride downtown to visit a jeweler's shop. The girls enjoyed the adventure, observing the bustling streets. Mrs. Hargrave expressed her joy at their visit and bought them matching notebooks to remember the pleasant day. The next day, Mrs. Hargrave had to leave for a sick cousin, leaving Minnie worried about potential misunderstandings due to Mrs. Horton's high standards.|"[""1.

Rosanna was making progress every day. Minnie felt happy and proud seeing how Rosanna was becoming more independent and learning new skills. Rosanna's sewing skills were impressive, especially as she worked on a dark blue dress similar to Helen's, adding her own cross-stitching with Minnie's guidance. The dress became Rosanna's favorite item in her wardrobe. Despite feeling the need for advice, Minnie couldn't consult with Mrs. Hargrave, so she decided to trust fate. Rosanna, too, felt uneasy due to past experiences with her grandmother's strict standards. On the other hand, Helen's mother, Mrs. Culver, emphasized important values like obedience, truthfulness, kindness, and good behavior, which she successfully instilled in Helen. Rosanna, feeling a bit fearful, made a mistake that she regretted. She struggled with how to explain it to her grandmother without causing distress to Helen.

"They returned to the merry-go-round and enjoyed a happy half-hour riding the carousel animals. As the sun started to set, it was time for supper. Eating a picnic supper always takes a while, and by the time they finished, dusk had arrived. The stars began to twinkle in the sky, and suddenly, Fontaine Ferry lit up with dazzling electric lights. ""Isn't it beautiful?"" exclaimed Helen, her eyes wide with wonder. ""I wish Mrs. Hargrave could see this! The younger Mrs. Hargrave inside the older one would have such lovely thoughts about it, don't you think?"" ""You must come over early tomorrow,"" Rosanna said, squeezing Helen's hand as they headed home. ""I owe grandmother a letter, and we can write about all we've seen today.

""I haven't misbehaved,"" Rosanna defended. ""I did exactly as you instructed. I saved your letter to show you if needed. Please, grandmother, I've been good! I've been so happy.""
