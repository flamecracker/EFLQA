Sam suggested asking Jackson at the telegraph office for more information. The telegraph receiver was active, and Jackson, in charge, was noting a message.

Two days had passed, and the boys were feeling comfortable back on the farm after the stress of exams and school events. Sam noted they were back to their usual selves, ready for anything. During this time, they received a telegram from Mr. Rover in Philadelphia, saying he had found his target but lost him again. He mentioned his return on Sunday, shared on Monday, making the boys wait a week to see him. Tom couldn't resist his pranks, causing chaos with barn mice in the pantry, ink on stones in the coal, and a fake snake scaring the hired man. He even played a joke on Aleck, inflating a rubber rabbit in his coat. They decided to spy on Aleck's visit to a widow's home in the nearby village of Dexter's Corners, leading to a humorous adventure.|"['1.

Tom assured Aleck that they would appreciate the help given, knowing the widow's dire financial situation. Sam suspected chicken thieves were at play. The Rover family swiftly prepared to pursue the culprits, equipping themselves with weapons and heading into the cornfield turned peach orchard. As they cautiously advanced, a sudden attack left Tom on the ground, prompting a chase after the fleeing figures. Despite the challenging terrain and darkness, the boys persisted, with Dick firing a warning shot. The pursuit led them to the riverbank, where they realized the need for backup. Dick instructed Jack to seek assistance from the nearby Ditwold household while they prepared to follow in Dan Bailey's boat, although the absence of oars posed a new challenge.|"[""1.

The barn was far away, and the boys didn't want to run that distance to get oars. Instead, Sam found a board to use as a paddle. They pushed a rowboat into the river, with Dick steering using the board. As they floated downstream, they heard the distant roar of Humpback Falls. Suddenly, they spotted another rowboat heading towards the opposite shore. Dick tried to steer their boat in that direction but struggled due to the strong current. They hit some rocks and almost capsized. The other boat spun around in alarm but managed to steady itself and disappeared into the shadows near the old flour mill. The boys landed their boat safely and decided to follow the men who had landed at the mill. The Henderson mill was abandoned and falling apart, a haven for tramps. It was challenging to navigate the rocks and darkness to reach the mill. Tom carried a shotgun cautiously as they crept closer to the building to eavesdrop on the mysterious men.|"['1.

With bated breath, the three Rover boys cautiously approached the open doorway of the ancient mill, aware of the nearby strangers. Leading the way, Dick proceeded to the enclosed stairs leading below. Carefully descending on tiptoes, he prevented his brothers from potential falls on the decayed steps. Inside the wheel room, a streak of light beckoned from a closed door, secured with bolts inside and out. The boys overheard a conversation involving Sid Merrick, a notorious figure from their past. Realizing the danger, they readied their weapons as the men discussed their illicit plans.

A group of six individuals embarked on a thorough exploration of the woods and nearby roads close to Henderson's mill after a swift explanation of the situation. Despite a night-long search, no significant discoveries were made. Law enforcement was alerted, but the culprits remained at large. The stolen boat used by the perpetrators was traced back to its rightful owner near Oak Run. Evidence of their presence was found at the old mill through remnants of meals. The boys, having nothing else to occupy their time, engaged in fishing, swimming, target practice, boxing, and gymnastic exercises. Meanwhile, Dick penned a lengthy letter to his dear friend Dora Stanhope. Shortly after, Mr. Rover arrived, looking weary but relieved to be reunited with his family. After a hearty breakfast, the family gathered for an important discussion initiated by Mr. Rover, who had significant news to share.|['1.

Silas Merrick, the brother of the infamous Sid Merrick, passed away leaving his estate to Sid and their deceased sister's son, Tad Sobber. The plot thickens as we delve deeper into the story. A nobleman named Parmonelli, fleeing a revolution in Central America, entrusted his vast wealth of gold and diamonds to Mr. Stanhope's shipping firm. Tragically, Parmonelli was shot by revolutionists, who then hid the treasure on a West Indies island. The revolutionists' plan to divide the fortune led to a deadly dispute, resulting in the treasure being concealed in a cave by heavy rocks. The group's capture and imprisonment left only two survivors, Doranez and Bahama Jack, the latter having spent much time in the Bahama Islands. Mrs. Stanhope considers organizing a treasure hunt, seeking advice on the matter. The hunt for the hidden treasure involves tracking down Bahama Jack and Doranez.|"[""1.

However, the truth is that the treasure, if found, belongs solely to Mr. Stanhope's estate, which includes Mrs. Stanhope, Dora, and the Lanings. Despite some uncertainties, Dick is determined to locate the island where the treasure is hidden.

Anderson Rover provided detailed information about the treasure, his conversations with Bahama Jack, and his plans for the expedition. The treasure was believed to be on Treasure Isle, a coral island shaped like a horseshoe covered with palm trees. The cave holding the treasure was said to be at the center of the island, surrounded by reefs making it inaccessible by ship. To reach the treasure, they would have to land on the island in a small boat. The group planning to search for the treasure included Anderson Rover, his three sons, Mrs. Stanhope, Dora, the Lannings, Fred Garrison, Songbird Powell, and Hans Mueller. Aleck Pop also joined the group as a general helper. The expedition was set to begin from Philadelphia around the Fourth of July, heading to the steam yacht for the voyage to Treasure Isle.|"['1.

Mr. Rover was concerned when he found out that Merrick had joined a captain on a tramp vessel for a treasure hunt. His worry deepened when Dick informed him that letters had been stolen from his coat pocket, including one from Mrs. Stanhope about the hunt. Anderson Rover doubted Merrick's loyalty, knowing he would act independently. The group planned to go to Philadelphia to prepare the steam yacht for the journey. They were welcomed by Captain Barforth, a friendly man. The yacht had spacious staterooms in white and gold decor. The boys were fascinated by the modern engine that could reach high speeds.

While driving along a peaceful country road far from the city, Dick and his friends encountered a reckless driver who threw a firecracker at their car. In retaliation, Tom threw it back, causing the reckless driver to get burnt. As they reached a hill, both cars effortlessly climbed it at high speeds. Dick, concerned about the reckless drivers' behavior, decided to stop at a hotel for ice cream. While the group enjoyed their treats, Dick noticed the drivers drinking heavily. Worried about their safety, Dick took matters into his own hands. He swiftly started one of the cars and drove off, leaving the reckless drivers behind.

There was not enough time for more words as the car bounced over the stones vigorously. Alarmed, Dick, who had already turned off the engine, pressed the brake, but he was unfamiliar with it and jammed it, failing to completely stop the car's forward movement. Below, the road was narrow with a rocky gully on one side and thick bushes on the other. In the path was a farmer with a wagon filled with lime.

"Early the next morning, Bahama Bill arrived, creating quite a scene. Despite the boys knowing his appearance, they struggled to stifle their amusement. He was a short, stout man with broad shoulders and noticeably bowed legs. His long reddish hair and thick beard added to his unique look. One eye squinted, giving him a perpetual over-the-shoulder glance, while his voice alternated between a squeak and a rumble. ""He's a character,"" Dick remarked. Bahama Bill entertained the group with sea tales, keeping everyone engaged. As the steam yacht set sail down the Delaware River, the master, doubtful of a successful treasure hunt, anticipated a worthwhile journey. The pleasant July day on the water delighted the passengers, observing various vessels along the way.

The boys and girls were fascinated by the steam yacht, the _Rainbow_, exploring every nook. Captain Barforth was welcoming, but the first mate, Asa Carey, was aloof, and the assistant engineer, Bill Bossermann, was gruff. Hans found Bossermann opinionated and unfriendly. One day, as Tom and Sam played catch, they were unaware of the first mate nearby. Captain Barforth's absence left the first mate in charge, overseeing the ship's course.

"""I'll take care,"" replied Rover cheerfully, then tossed the baseball high into the air. Suddenly, the steam yacht lurched, causing the ball to hit the mainmast and bounce directly onto Asa Carey's head, knocking his cap over his eyes. Tom stepped forward, explaining, ""We didn't mean to hit you, just having fun. We hired this yacht and have the right to enjoy ourselves as long as we don't disrupt the ship's operation. Please return our ball."" Asa Carey sneered, accusing Tom of seeking protection from the captain. The weather grew warmer, and the group relaxed under deck awnings. They tried fishing and enjoyed singing and games. A mist enveloped the ocean, leading to reduced speed and increased lookout. Tom mentioned his new camera, eager to use it once the sun reappeared. Bahama Bill shared a tale about a thick fog off Lower California, recalling a dangerous incident with a lost girl. Rover joked about a fort wall built from fog for defence during an attack."|"[""1.

The old sailor aboard the _Rainbow_ was about to share some words when a loud cry interrupted him. Suddenly, the ship shook violently as it collided with something. The captain and Mr. Rover rushed to assess the damage. Asa Carey took charge, preparing the lifeboats. Thankfully, it was just a small hole in the bow, and the crew worked swiftly to repair it. The decision was made to head to Nassau for proper repairs. Nassau, the capital of the Bahamas, offered the necessary facilities. The journey was completed without further incidents, and the crew docked for repairs while the passengers enjoyed the amenities of the island.|['1.

On the edge of the town, there was a lovely flower garden with unusually beautiful roses. One day, some girls and ladies visited the garden, accompanied by Dick and Songbird. Meanwhile, Tom and Sam went to the docks to check on the repairs of the _Rainbow_ and watch the ships coming and going. They found out that the passengers had already disembarked, with a few people at the dock handling some delayed baggage. Peter Slade, a former student of Putnam Hall, was approached by Tom to share any information about Sid Merrick and his plans. Peter, wanting to unravel the mystery, revealed some details. Mr. Rover, after returning from the flower garden visit, immediately set off to find Sid Merrick and the tramp steamer _Josephine_. The next day, they discovered the steamer had left the harbor, raising concerns about a race to locate Treasure Isle. The _Rainbow_ was prepared to sail the following day, with a new deckhand named Walt Wingate joining the crew. The steam yacht departed Nassau and set course southward around Cuba, passing several islands and keys along the way.

During a voyage to Treasure Isle on the steam yacht, the Rainbow, Dick noticed something suspicious about the new deckhand, Walt Wingate. Dick saw Walt drop something into the sea late at night. Curious, Sam also observed this mysterious act. The captain, concerned, investigated and found an iron chain and an anchor tied to one of the rowboats. The crew worked together to pull it aboard. The captain realized they narrowly avoided a potential disaster by uncovering the hidden anchor. The crew's teamwork and quick thinking prevented a possible accident as they continued their journey through the challenging waters filled with surprises like hidden reefs and shifting ocean bottoms.|"['1.

A search was conducted, with all the boys, Mr. Rover, and Aleck participating, but the missing deckhand, Wingate, was not found despite a thorough search of the steam yacht. The captain offered a reward of ten dollars to anyone who could find Wingate, but to no avail. The machinery of the yacht was inspected, and some wire was found twisted around the propeller, but it was removed without causing damage. Concerns grew among the passengers about Wingate's potential presence on the vessel, leading to extra precautions at night. Bahama Bill shared a story to pass the time, recounting a past incident with an orangutan on a ship.

Twenty-four hours passed before the fog lifted, revealing the location of Treasure Isle. Captain Barforth directed the steam yacht towards the beautiful tropical isle. As they neared, they saw the palm trees and the blue waters. The old sailor, Bahama Bill, guided the yacht to the south shore, avoiding the dangerous sea around the island. The crew decided to wait until morning to explore the island. Tom, Dick, and Sam, along with two sailors, rowed ashore with supplies, planning to spend the night. Despite warnings about a cave on the island, they were eager to explore. Hans stayed behind, preferring the safety of the ship. Bahama Bill shared a story about encountering a snake on land, reaffirming his preference for the safety of the ship's bunk.|['1.

The boys were thrilled as they navigated the rowboat through the reef passage. Despite initial fears of taking on water, the skilled rowers safely guided them into the horseshoe harbor. Once ashore on a sandy strip near palm trees, the boys marveled at the beauty around them - towering palms, lush vines, and vibrant flowers filled the air with a sweet fragrance. Eager to find the cave at the center of the horseshoe curve, they trudged along the sandy shore until they encountered a muddy flat and thorny bushes. Pressing on, they followed a faint trail winding through rocks and trees, likely used by locals gathering fruits. As darkness fell, the boys concealed themselves as a group led by Sid Merrick approached with lanterns, including their rivals Tad Sobber, Cuffer, and Shelley.|"[""1.

"""I don't know,"" replied his uncle. ""They are laying outside the reef. I think they are unaware of the landing on the other side of the island."" ""Let's hurry if we want to intercept them. I didn't expect them to arrive so quickly."" The group from the _Josephine_ moved forward, illuminating their path with an acetylene gas lamp, passing right by where the Rovers were hiding. The boys stood still, fearing discovery, until the others were almost out of sight. Dick suggested they follow and stop Sid Merrick's party from getting the treasure, but they faced challenges. The other party had more members and weapons. Whispering, Sam expressed concerns about confronting them openly. They cautiously trailed the Merrick party, staying about a hundred feet behind.

The Rover boys found themselves lost in the forest with no way to determine their location or how to get back to Foreshow Bay. Setting up camp, they took turns keeping watch while the others slept. Suddenly, Dick was attacked by Merrick and Shelley, who tied up him, Tom, and Sam. The boys struggled to free themselves but to no avail. As the night passed, they realized they had to act fast to prevent Merrick from reaching the treasure cave before their father arrived.

As dawn approached, Tom predicted the morning's arrival. The sun's rays didn't reach them yet, but it painted the tree's tops in gold, allowing them to see each other clearly. Dick suggested testing their luck with a loud call, which all three boys joined in, alternating for an hour. Tom decided to take a risk with a louder cry, hoping for a response. After a moment of silence, a sudden pistol shot broke the quiet. Mr. Rover and Captain Barforth planned to search for the treasure cave at daybreak. They discussed the changes on the isle, caused by a hurricane. Bahama Bill was found with Walt Wingate, claiming Walt tried to poison him in his sleep. Walt confessed that he was manipulated by Sid Merrick to sabotage the yacht and make Bahama Bill ill.|['1.

Bahama Bill was furious and wanted to confront the prisoner, but Fred and Songbird held him back. Walt Wingate, the deck hand, confessed humbly about Merrick's plans. Captain Barforth deemed him dangerous and locked him up. The crew of the _Rainbow_ spotted a light on Treasure Isle, suspecting someone moving towards the treasure cave. Mr. Rover, Bahama Bill, Aleck, and the Rover boys armed themselves and went ashore with provisions and tools. Guided by Bahama Bill, they reached a dead-end trail with a deep pit blocking their way.

Aleck and Hans were rescued from the deep hole with the help of Anderson Rover. Covered in dust and scratches, they ventured into the jungle but got lost. Breaking an oil lantern reduced their light. They decided to head back to find Mr. Rover's sons. The colored man found the boys tied up and freed them. Mr. Rover realized the seriousness of facing Sid Merrick for the treasure. The path led them through rough terrain with spider webs and large spiders. They reached a swamp and followed footprints westward through water and thick brush. Bahama Bill warned of an approaching storm, recalling a hurricane in Cuba. The group pressed on, facing challenges in the wild.|"['1.

The group's spirits were lifted upon hearing that the treasure cave was nearby, despite the heavy rain. They followed Bahama Bill eagerly, but their excitement turned to disappointment upon seeing a pile of rocks blocking the entrance. Anderson Rover and his sons realized that reaching the treasure would be a monumental task due to the massive rocks and the possibility that the treasure might have fallen through the cave floor during the earthquake. Determined, Anderson Rover suggested using dynamite to clear the rocks, aware that it could take weeks or even months. After seeking shelter from the rain, they explored the area and planned how to access the treasure buried beneath. Bahama Bill hoped they wouldn't have to move too many rocks to reach the treasure. The group then focused on finding a path to the bay to ease their access to and from the yacht. Despite the challenges, they remained hopeful and determined in their quest for the treasure.|"['1.

The captain mentioned having enough gunpowder on the ship for saluting and signaling. For dynamite, they would need to go to a larger island. The next day, Mr. Rover, Captain Barforth, and Dick, Tom, and Sam went ashore. Asa Carey stayed on the steam yacht, ready to send help if needed. They landed safely near a cave and brought tools for digging. Mr. Rover suggested blasting rocks to explore the cave. Dora overheard a conversation about Walt Wingate trying to thwart Mr. Rover's treasure hunt by bribing the mate and assistant engineer. Songbird suspected Carey and set off to find Mr. Rover and the captain. Upon hearing a gunshot, he rushed towards the beach where the Rover boys were and found their father and the captain not far behind.|"['1.

The captain sternly warned against mutiny and robbery, suspecting the crew's intentions. Dick speculated that the mate might be seeking counsel from Sid Merrick to hinder their treasure quest. Upon seeing Walt Wingate in conversation with the mate, Hans sensed trouble. Fred, sensing a plot, fired a shotgun as a distress signal to alert Songbird. Asa Carey, angered by Fred's actions, threatened to report to the captain. Fred stood his ground, asserting the charter's ownership. The crew gathered to discuss the unfolding events. Eventually, the _Rainbow_ approached another ship, likely the _Josephine_. Walt Wingate communicated with the other vessel, but the boys couldn't discern the conversation.|"['1.

Norton nodded silently while the mate glanced at Fred, hesitated, then left. A small boat was quickly manned by the mate, Bossermann, Wingate, and the lazy sailor Ulligan. They set off for the _Josephine_ as the _Rainbow_ sailed away, causing concern. The Rovers decided to climb a hill near the treasure cave to keep watch. Dick suggested using a spyglass from the tallest tree to see around. They climbed carefully, using vines for support. From the top, they observed the _Rainbow_ approaching the enemy vessel. Suddenly, fireworks were launched from the steam yacht, causing chaos in the rowboats. The enemy retreated, and both ships raced out to sea. The Rovers realized the enemy was on the _Josephine_, leaving their treasure hunt undisturbed for now. They returned to the cave area, waiting anxiously.|['1.

Mr. Rover emphasized the importance of planning before working haphazardly to avoid wasting energy. The treasure hunters, eager to uncover the hidden treasure, discovered chests filled with gold, jewelry, and precious stones. Despite the danger of falling rocks, they diligently unearthed the valuable items. As night fell, they successfully brought the treasure to the surface, estimating its worth to be over a hundred thousand dollars. However, their joy was tempered by the uncertainty of the _Rainbow's_ fate and the threat of the _Josephine_ capturing their steam yacht. Exhausted but content, they rested under the trees before preparing to transport the treasure back to their vessel for safekeeping.|"['1.
