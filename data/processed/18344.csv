Once upon a time, there were three Princesses: Roussette, Brunette, and Blondine. They lived quietly with their mother, a Princess who had lost her former grandeur. One day, an old woman visited and asked for a meal. Little did they know, she was a fairy. After the delicious dinner, the fairy promised to reward their kindness and vanished. Shortly after, the King, his brother, and the Lord Admiral came by. Struck by the Princesses' beauty, the King married Blondine, his brother married Brunette, and the Lord Admiral married Roussette. The good Fairy blessed Queen Blondine with three beautiful children, each adorned with jewels and stars on their foreheads. Unfortunately, jealousy and wickedness brewed, leading to a treacherous plot against the children. Despite the evil plans, the children were set adrift at sea and miraculously saved by a Corsair and his wife, Corsine. The Corsair and Corsine were amazed by the jewels and treasures that flowed from the children's hair, leading them to reconsider their way of life.
