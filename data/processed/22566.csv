The train from 'Frisco was very late. It should have arrived at Hugson's siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the open shed that served for the station-house. As it came to a stop the conductor called out in a loud voice: At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the car, carrying a wicker suitcase in one hand and a round bird-cage covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked under her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and then the engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and moved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was because all through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and trembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the rails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. So he moved the cars slowly and with caution. The shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and did not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray light not a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person in sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy standing near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked toward it and found the horse tied to a|"[""1.

Suddenly, a loud tearing sound split the earth beneath the horse, causing the buggy and its passengers to plummet into a dark abyss. They braced for impact, fearing the worst. Dorothy, overwhelmed, briefly lost consciousness, while Zeb, terrified but alert, clung to the buggy. As they fell, the buggy acted like a parachute, slowing their descent. Rocks and debris pelted them, causing panic. Despite the chaos, Dorothy noticed the horse Jim and Zeb beside her. The group floated towards six glowing balls below, emitting vibrant colors. As they approached, the lights illuminated the space, revealing a surreal scene. Dorothy, dazed but curious, observed the transformation of Jim and Zeb under the radiant lights. The buggy rolled but righted itself, continuing their strange journey towards the dazzling suns.|['1.

As they peered over the edge of the buggy, they saw the land below, not too far away. Floating slowly, almost like a gentle descent, the children had time to take in the breathtaking sight. Below them stretched a landscape of mountains, plains, lakes, and rivers, all bathed in the vibrant hues from the six suns. Houses sparkled like clear glass, reflecting the colorful lights. The city they were approaching had tall buildings with glass domes and spires sharp as spear-points. Jim, the horse, and the children were filled with awe and fear. Landing on a glass roof, they were surrounded by a city of transparent buildings. A man in brilliantly colored clothing appeared, his serene face showing no surprise at their arrival. He walked gracefully off the roof, disappearing into one of the glass buildings below. The pink kitten, unfazed by the unusual landing, purred softly, remarking on its inability to fall in this strange country. Dorothy and her companions marveled at the wonders of this inner world, where floating seemed like a natural way to travel.|['1.

The horse, feeling old and weary, shared stories of his past as a cab driver in Chicago with the young girl. Worried about finding food in this strange place, the horse expressed concerns about the possibility of glass oats. Despite his fears, Zeb, the boy, summoned the courage to step to the edge of the roof with Dorothy's help. Following their lead, Jim, the horse, trotted off the roof and gracefully landed on the glass pavement below. As the crowd gathered to marvel at the newcomers, a man with a star on his forehead approached Zeb, the tallest of the group, and questioned the truthfulness of the Sorcerer's predictions regarding the Rain of Stones.|"[""1.

"The thorn-covered man confidently proclaimed, ""My sorcery tells the truth! I predicted one Rain of Stones, but this second event was a Rain of People-and-Horse-and-Buggy, with some stones mixed in."" The Prince and his subjects hurried out to witness the unfolding spectacle, while Dorothy and Zeb joined the curious crowd. Meanwhile, the Sorcerer remained composed on his throne. High in the sky, a balloon-like object descended slowly, catching everyone's attention. As the balloon gradually grew larger, indicating its descent towards the Land of the Mangaboos, the onlookers waited patiently. Dorothy hoped the arrival might bring help for their predicament. Finally, the balloon landed gracefully in the square, revealing a bald, elderly man who had accidentally landed in this strange land. The Prince welcomed him, acknowledging that even the most skilled Sorcerers can make mistakes. The Wizard, though hesitant, followed the Prince inside the grand hall, with Dorothy and Zeb trailing behind."|"['1.

"""Listen up, kids! The little man was serious when he said you should join the circus. He's part of a big show with three rings under one tent and a menagerie on the side. It's a fantastic group, he assured. He usually goes up in a balloon to attract people to the circus. But this time, he had a mishap and landed lower than planned. However, he's excited for you to see the Land of the Gabazoos. The Wizard then performed a magic trick with piglets, creating many from one and then making them disappear.

The group then headed to the public gardens, and Jim the horse was eager to join for a potential tasty treat. The Wizard, along with the kids and the kitten, rode together in the buggy."""|"['1.

The group continued through the city, with the Sorcerer's bearers leading, followed by the Prince, Jim pulling the buggy with the strangers, and lastly the heartless vegetable people. The glass city had beautiful streets, leading to a vast plain with gardens and streams. The gardens had paths and glass bridges over the brooks. The changing colors of the flowers and plants under the six suns amazed Dorothy. The Mangaboos buried the Sorcerer's halves, watered the earth, and explained their lifecycle. These creatures attached to plants only gained motion and speech when ripe. The Prince revealed their long life span. They reached a garden with ripe Mangaboos, each in different stages of growth, from bud to adult. The central figure, a girl, stood elegantly, captivating Dorothy with her beauty and grace.|"[""1.

The Prince of the vegetable land expressed his discontent about the cycle of life where beings must yield to others as they grow. He intended to rule until he could deal with the uninvited strangers in their land. The Prince planned to keep the Wizard for his skills but intended to destroy the rest of the visitors. Hungry, Zeb noticed strawberries and melons in the gardens, but the Prince forbade them from picking, ordering their destruction soon. As they were about to face their fate, the Wizard suggested picking the Royal Princess, believing she would rule more kindly. With a gentle pull, they freed the Princess, who expressed gratitude to the strangers for saving her from the Prince's selfish rule. The people then escorted the Princess to her palace, acknowledging her as their new ruler. Dorothy, Zeb, and the Wizard explored the gardens, experiencing unique phenomena in the fairy land.|"['1.

In the gardens, they discovered strawberries, melons, and other tasty fruits. The kitten pestered them for milk and meat, annoyed that the Wizard couldn't conjure them magically. The Wizard, confiding in his friends, revealed it was all a trick to deceive their enemies. To satisfy the kitten, the Wizard fashioned a fishing line from a pin and string, using a bright blossom as bait. He caught a fish, but the kitten snatched it away. Dorothy found crackers in her suitcase, which the piglets happily devoured. The Wizard decided to claim the Sorcerer's house, as the Prince had promised to keep him until they found a new Sorcerer. They ascended to the upper halls with glass furniture but no beds. After unharnessing Jim and settling Eureka, Zeb napped on a glass bench. The Wizard woke up to the six suns shining on the Land of the Mangaboos, feeling refreshed and ready for the day.|"['1.

The boy fetched the items, and Dorothy woke up. They pondered their next move but were stuck. Jim the cab-horse's voice interrupted. The Princess and her people arrived, threatening to throw them into the Garden of the Twining Vines. The Wizard claimed he was a better Sorcerer. The Princess challenged him to show his powers. The Wizard conjured piglets, amazed the Princess, and lit lanterns. He created a fiery display to test the advisors. They failed, withering in the flames.

The Wizard saved the children and himself. Jim and Eureka didn't want to go to the Black Pit, and Dorothy promised to help them. For a few days, they were left in peace at the Sorcerer's House. They explored the gardens and saw the Garden of the Clinging Vines, filled with writhing green vines. They narrowly avoided being ensnared by the vines. The Wizard's piglets played in the room, venturing out into the hall. Suddenly, the Mangaboos, with thorns in hand, surrounded them. The animals were driven out of the city and towards a mountain. Despite a valiant effort to fight back, they were eventually forced into a dark cave, with glass rocks blocking the entrance. Eureka managed to escape and sought help. Dorothy, the Wizard, and Zeb prepared to rescue their friends.|"['1.

As the group emerged from the dark tunnel in the glass mountain, they were greeted by a delightful valley. The valley resembled a cup with lush green hills and a rugged mountain on the other side. The landscape was adorned with beautiful lawns, gardens, and orchards bearing unknown fruits. Crystal-clear brooks meandered through the flower-strewn banks, and charming cottages dotted the area. The valley was bathed in a soft, unseen light, casting a magical glow over everything. Despite its beauty, the valley appeared mysteriously deserted, with not a single inhabitant in sight.

"The mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to granite. Jim carefully guided the buggy over the loose rocks until they reached the green lawns below, with paths and orchards. The nearest cottage was still a distance away. ""We can't walk in the air here,"" called Eureka, who had tried and failed. The Wizard mentioned they were closer to the earth's surface than in Mangaboo, making everything more natural. They heard a bird's twitter but couldn't find it. Slowly walking to the cottage, piglets raced beside them. They found a low plant with a single fruit, as large as a peach, fragrant and appetizing. Dorothy found it delightful and exclaimed. Jim gathered the piglets, ensuring their safety, and they continued to the cottage. It was charming, with vines on the porch. Inside, a table was set with food, and the cutlery moved mysteriously. Laughter followed Dorothy's surprise, and they were welcomed to eat. The woman's voice explained the dama-fruit's power to make them invisible to bears in the Valley of Voe. They sat down to eat, tempted by the dama-fruit's sweet scent. A young voice warned about the bears and the benefits of being invisible. Dorothy discovered two invisible children, a girl, and a smaller boy, feeling their soft features."|"['1.

In the Valley of Voe, beauty is not displayed outwardly, but rather through good deeds and pleasant behavior. Appreciating nature's beauty, like the delicate flowers and green fields, is important to the people living there. Although they can't see the birds or bears due to sharing food, they enjoy the sweet bird songs and catch fishes from the brooks. The children were initially scared of a small animal resembling a bear, but Dorothy assured them it was harmless. Eureka, the kitten, curiously explored the table, only to be mysteriously lifted into the air. The Wizard sought a way out of the Valley, learning about a spiral staircase in Pyramid Mountain leading to the Land of Naught where Gargoyles reside. The unseen people shared a secret with the travelers to walk on water using leaves rubbed on their feet to escape enemies.|"['1.

"""Thank you!"" exclaimed the Wizard cheerfully. He quickly rubbed a leaf on Dorothy's shoes, his own, and then on the kitten's paws. Zeb applied it to his feet, Jim's hoofs, and the buggy wheels. Suddenly, a low growl startled them. The horse kicked wildly. Their unseen friend warned, ""To the water, or you are lost!"" The Wizard steered the buggy onto the river, aided by the plant's magic. Zeb and Jim followed. The Wizard battled invisible foes with his sword, defeating a red bear. They continued across the water safely. The Wizard tended to Jim's wounds. Zeb harnessed Jim again, and they sped toward Pyramid Mountain. Jim galloped swiftly, spurred by fear of more bears. Zeb playfully growled, causing Jim to race even faster. They reached the mountain abruptly, tumbling off the buggy in a comical heap. Dorothy clung to safety, while the mischievous kitten meowed in protest, and Jim's laughter filled the air."|"['1.

"The tall mountain in front of them was cone-shaped, reaching so high that its peak vanished into the clouds. Facing Jim, there was an arched entrance leading to a wide staircase cut inside the rock. The stairs were gently sloping and broad, spiraling like a corkscrew. At the start, where the flight began, the circle was quite large. A sign at the staircase's base read: ""Light was dim, and soon they entered total darkness, prompting the Wizard to light lanterns. Advancing steadily, they reached a landing with a crevice letting in light and air, revealing the Valley of Voe below. After a brief rest, they continued the ascent.

The braided man expressed his desire for a blue hair-ribbon, as his braids were tied with various colors but lacked blue. Dorothy, feeling sorry for him, quickly fetched a blue ribbon from her suit-case, bringing joy to the man. He shared a peculiar story of how he fell into a deep hole that led to a lonely cavern, where he now resided, passing time by creating rustles and flutters. Despite the absurdity of his tale, Dorothy found it amusing, while the Wizard hinted that he might be crazy. Politely bidding him farewell, they resumed their journey through the mountain, reaching a landing with a view obscured by thick clouds. Resting, the Wizard revealed nine tiny piglets, now visible outside the magical Valley of Voe. Eureka, the kitten, expressed hunger, but Dorothy reminded her of proper kitten food, not piglets. Jim, the horse, warned Eureka against harming the piglets, emphasizing their importance as pets.|"['1.

"In that case,"" she said, ""I'll leave them alone. You haven't many teeth left, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. So the piglets will be perfectly safe, hereafter, as far as I am concerned.""No one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breath for the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard often had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keep it from jamming against the rocky walls.Jim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck his head above the rocky sides of the stairway. Then he halted, ducked down and began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the others.""See here, my good steed,"" broke in the Wizard, ""little Dorothy and I have been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escaped without harm.

A group of strange creatures, known as Gargoyles, were discovered near some stairs. They stared motionless at the Wizard, children, horse, and kitten. The little man warned that the Gargoyles were armed with wooden clubs and meant mischief. The Gargoyles, with evil eyes, advanced towards the group. The horse, Jim, kicked and scattered the Gargoyles, but they regrouped and planned their attack. The Wizard and the group prepared for battle.

The boy decided to use the king as a weapon, pulling the prisoner out of the buggy. The bound Gargoyle had long arms that extended beyond its head, making it a good club when grasped by the wrists. The boy, being strong from working on a farm, proved to be a formidable opponent compared to the Wizard. As the next group of Gargoyles approached, the adventurers began yelling loudly, causing even the kitten and Jim the cab-horse to join in. Despite their efforts, the wooden creatures overwhelmed them, capturing Dorothy, Zeb, and the Wizard. All of them were carried by the Gargoyles over miles of wooden land to a wooden city with square and tower-like houses.

Dorothy and her companions were in a tight spot. After a daring escape on the flying horse, they found themselves pursued by a group of Gargoyles. To deter their pursuers, the Wizard set the wings of the horse ablaze, creating a barrier of flames. As they ventured through the mountain, they encountered obstacles, including a narrow passage that required them to dismantle and reassemble their buggy. Despite the challenges, they pressed on, navigating through cracks and rough terrain. Eventually, they reached a vast cave illuminated by eerie yellow lights that swayed and flickered.

The Wizard reflected on the joy he found among the Munchkins, Winkies, Quadlings, and Gillikins in the Emerald City. Dorothy signaled Ozma, and in an instant, she and the kitten vanished, leaving the group in the underground prison. The Wizard anticipated their departure to the Land of Oz. Suddenly, they found themselves in a magnificent emerald-green city with inviting gates to a grand palace. The servants welcomed them with respect, recognizing the Wizard's fame. The boy marveled at the opulence around him. Jellia Jamb, a green maiden, was puzzled by the cab-horse, a creature unknown in the Land of Oz.

The steward respectfully informed Jim that they didn't have whole oats but offered oatmeal, a common breakfast dish. Jim, feeling a bit arrogant due to the newfound respect he received in the Land of Oz, was served oatmeal by the royal attendants. The next morning, he ventured out to find grass for breakfast and encountered the Sawhorse, a peculiar wooden horse with golden-shod legs and a diamond-studded saddle. Jim boasted about his fine points, like whisking away flies with his tail, to which the Sawhorse retorted that Jim missed out on real pleasures like enjoying food and fresh air. Suddenly, two savage beasts, a Lion and a Tiger, appeared, causing Jim to hesitate in fear. The Sawhorse bravely warned Jim of the danger, and they faced the intimidating creatures together.|['1.

Zeb was surprised by his defeat, and when the Princess laughed at him, he challenged a boxing match with the Munchkin. However, when Zeb landed a blow on the Munchkin's ears, the Munchkin sat down, crying. This made Zeb and Ozma laugh. They then decided to have a race. Jim, the cab-horse, and the Sawhorse raced. The Sawhorse won, but Jim, feeling ashamed, kicked the Sawhorse. In response, the Tiger leaped at Jim, knocking him down. Jim apologized, realizing his mistake. The Tin Woodman fixed the Sawhorse, and Princess Ozma crowned it Prince of Horses. Festivities followed, and Dorothy and Ozma searched for a missing piglet, suspecting Eureka.
