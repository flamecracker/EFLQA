Father and the boys welcomed the old woman who entered slowly, clad in a black cape and hood, leaning on a cane. She emptied a bag into a pot, circled it thrice, and a red light emerged. Reddy shared a rhyme about lemons and pie. The boys teased and were playfully warned. They knelt, faces in flour, creating a cloud. A paper pie with ribbons and snap-crackers adorned the table. The girls received kittens as gifts at Beth's lawn party. Patsy rescued them during a pony cart ride. Jerry hosted friends for a jolly evening. Mary's club held a successful fair for charity. The scouts' camping and baseball adventures showcased teamwork and rivalry.|"['1.
