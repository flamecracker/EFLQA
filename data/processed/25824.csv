Rusty Wren and his wife were searching for the perfect spot to build their nest. Rusty was worried that if they chose the wrong place, their nest might fall to the ground, especially if they had eggs in it. His wife agreed but insisted on living near the farmhouse. After exploring various locations around Farmer Green's buildings, Rusty finally found an ideal spot - an old tin can nailed to a tree. Inspired by a story in the weekly paper, Johnnie Green created the perfect home for the wrens by modifying the tin can to have a small round hole for a doorway.

Once the tiny pair found a spot to call home, they wasted no time in constructing their nest. They diligently gathered twigs, filling their new abode swiftly. In the heart of the twig mass, they crafted a cozy nest using dried grasses, all the while chirping cheerful tunes. Johnnie Green was captivated by their work, often lingering in the dooryard to observe. Farmer Green, pleased with their industry, even joked that the newcomers were already paying rent. Rusty, the wren, served as a natural alarm clock for the household, singing a melodious morning song at dawn. Despite initial grumblings, even Johnnie came to appreciate Rusty's timely wake-up calls, realizing the benefits of rising early for a day full of vigor and productivity.|"['1.

Johnnie and his mother were delighted by the surprises Farmer Green had brought home from the village. This made Farmer Green even happier than usual. He went to bed early, feeling he had extra work the next day. Farmer Green was puzzled by the absence of the wren's song under his window, suspecting the cat had caught it. But to his surprise, the wren was perched on a limb. Farmer Green wished his new clock was an alarm clock to ensure he woke on time. The wren, feeling replaced by a cuckoo brought from the village, decided to stop waking Farmer Green at dawn. This change caused the household to oversleep, much to Rusty Wren's satisfaction. Rusty criticized the cuckoo's singing and flew off to sing his dawn song in the orchard, surprising Jolly Robin with his beautiful melody.|"[""1.

"As time passed, the Green family kept oversleeping, and Rusty grew tired of the constant ""Cuckoo! cuckoo!"" that echoed through the kitchen window of the farmhouse. The stranger in the kitchen never left, so Rusty decided to ask Jimmy Rabbit to find Mr. Crow for some advice. When Mr. Crow arrived, he mentioned that it didn't matter to him if Farmer Green slept in. He suggested that Rusty continue singing by Farmer Green's window for now but consult him next spring. Rusty agreed, feeling grateful for Mr. Crow's wisdom. Rusty's wife was a diligent cleaner, chirping happily while she worked. Rusty, on the other hand, was a bit messy and often left things lying around. When Mrs. Rusty chirped in a less pleasant tone, Rusty would quickly find an excuse to leave the house."|"['1.

One day, after a trip to the pasture, Mr. Rusty Wren's wife, Mrs. Rusty, noticed a strange smell in the house. She suspected her husband, who seemed guilty. She found a piece stuck to his feathers and scolded him for littering. Feeling worried, Mr. Rusty tried to escape outside. Mrs. Rusty thought he brought tobacco and smoke into the house, making her upset. Mr. Rusty felt guilty and left the house, hoping his wife would calm down. He had never smoked and only smelled like smoke from Farmer Green's burning stumps. The tobacco on his feathers was a mystery. By the afternoon, he hoped his wife's anger had faded. But he had never seen her so upset before.|"['1.

The smoker returned home, causing Rusty Wren to abandon his merry song for a hunt for food. After feasting on insects, Rusty felt cheerful and sang as evening approached. Rusty, unafraid unlike Mr. Crow, explored the farm buildings. Inside the carriage house, he found tobacco leaves. Rusty decided to bring his wife to see the tobacco. They had a nest in a syrup can on a cherry tree, chosen by Johnnie Green, hoping for wrens to nest. Jolly Robin enjoyed cherries from the tree, causing concern for Rusty's family.

Jasper Jay had heard about the cherries on Rusty Wren's tree and announced his intention to visit. This news upset Rusty Wren's wife, fearing Jasper's bullying behavior would prevent them from finding food for their hungry children.

For a few days, everything went smoothly in Rusty Wren's home, making his wife feel better. Jasper Jay didn't bother them, and Chippy, Jr., worked hard to provide food. Mrs. Rusty couldn't find any worries, and Rusty thought hiring Chippy, Jr., was lucky. They were so focused on their children that they didn't notice Chippy, Jr., growing taller than Rusty. They also missed that he struggled to fit through the door due to his increasing size. One day, when Rusty returned with food, Chippy, Jr., got stuck in the doorway. After some confusion, they managed to get him inside, but Mrs. Rusty worried about feeding such a big boy. She suspected Chippy planned it so they would keep him.
