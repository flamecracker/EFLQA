The pirate Hassan captured an unarmed brig loaded with wine and fruit, carrying two valuable passengers, beautiful sisters heading to Malta. With a plan in mind, Hassan seized a British flag and sent armed men to capture a port captain. The Algerines tricked the captain into captivity.

At the Dey's palace in Algiers, Achmet Pasha, a tall and dignified man, spent time on the roof with his advisers and a nearly full-grown lion. The palace roof offered a serene view of the bay and mountains. Achmet, a respectable Dey, faced challenges with courage, while his adviser, Sidi Omar, appeared troubled.

Omar continued a lengthy conversation, advising the Dey to grant an audience to the Spanish consul who claimed two ladies as his countrywomen.

"In the past, slaves in Algiers were from various backgrounds, including sailors, merchants, and scholars from different countries at war with the Dey. English, French, and Spanish slaves were eventually freed due to diplomatic efforts. The harsh conditions forced them to work like oxen under the scorching African sun. Some slaves, like an old man and a seaman, endured the labor, while others, like a sickly youth, suffered greatly. Blindi, an Algerian with a naval background and knowledge of English, served as an interpreter for British ships. Despite his nickname ""Blind Bob,"" he was not blind and often showed off his language skills to impress others.

Omar warned Blindi, the interpreter, not to claim protection from the British consul, threatening severe punishment. Blindi was led to a dark chamber for punishment, with stone pillars and chains. Initially to be beaten on his stomach, he protested, but was then beaten on his feet. The punishment was stopped after his cries. Blindi, aware of the city's cruelty, felt little gratitude towards Omar. He returned to find the sick old man and gave him water. The Dey, adorned in riches, sat in a decorated room with a lion footstool.

Don Pedro expressed regret to the king, explaining that he had contacted his ruler about the debt and was confident of a swift resolution. The king threatened to send Don Pedro to work in the quarries if the money wasn't received promptly. The consul's dismissal was due to the barbarians' ignorance of diplomatic norms. Later, Sidi Hassan, a pirate captain, was summoned by the Dey. Despite being appointed as the British consul's attendant, Hassan found the role demeaning.

The overseers noticed this and stationed themselves close to him. Just then, the young man saw Angela Diego being brought into the market, looking more captivating and sorrowful than ever, to be sold as a slave. Mariano had been deeply moved by the sisters' plight when he first saw them on the pirate ship. Seeing the younger sister now, his prudence vanished, and in a fit of rage, he confronted Sidi Hassan, striking him to the ground. Mariano was seized, bound, and taken to the whipping-house. Meanwhile, Sidi Hassan, unaware of Mariano's actions, encountered Bacri the Jew. They struck a deal, and Angela was handed over to Bacri's wife. Sidi Hassan returned home with his pockets full, his nose swollen, and in a better mood. Later, Bacri walked through the old town of Algiers, which remains much the same today as it did back then.

"The Moor continued, ""We fought until our eyes were black, noses red, and some teeth were knocked out, but the sailors overwhelmed us. We had to surrender, as courage can't beat numbers. We were taken aboard a frigate and examined."" Ali remarked on the similarity of his experience with others. The Moor then shared how he became a British sailor, fought in battles, but never received promotions or prize money due to unexplained circumstances. One night in Algiers, the Moor's identity led to a near war with England, but the British consul intervened. As they approached Bab-el-Oued, they discussed the cruelty and cheapness of life under Turkish rule. Ali left to attend to business, leaving Ted Flaggan to observe the harsh realities of the place. The sight of executed criminals and mistreated animals made Ted ponder on the stark differences from his homeland."|['Question 1:\nWhat did the Moor and his companions have to do after being overwhelmed by the sailors?\nA) Keep fighting\nB) Surrender\nC) Negotiate for peace\nD) Run away\nE) Call for reinforcements', 'Question 2:\nWhat did the Moor attribute their surrender to?\nA) Lack of weapons\nB) Lack of courage\nC) Lack of food\nD) Overwhelming numbers\nE) Lack of leadership', 'Question 3:\nWhat prevented the Moor from receiving promotions and prize money during his time as a British sailor?\nA) Lack of skill\nB) Unexplained circumstances\nC) Lack of experience\nD) Lack of connections\nE) Lack of courage', 'Question 4:\nWhat almost caused a war with England for the Moor in Algiers?\nA) Theft\nB) Identity\nC) Betrayal\nD) Sabotage\nE) Misunderstanding', 'Question 5:\nWho was left to observe the harsh realities of Bab-el-Oued?\nA) Ali\nB) The Moor\nC) Ted Flaggan\nD) The British consul\nE) The sailors', 'Question 6:\nWhat made Ted Flaggan ponder on the differences between his homeland and Bab-el-Oued?\nA) The weather\nB) The food\nC) The mistreated animals\nD) The executed criminals\nE) The architecture']|['B) Surrender', 'D) Overwhelming numbers', 'B) Unexplained circumstances', 'B) Identity', 'C) Ted Flaggan', 'D) The executed criminals']
He stood watching the diverse crowd of Turks, Jews, Moors, and others moving about. Rais Ali had explained the distinctions between them. Suddenly, a group approached carrying a man bound hand and foot. They laid him down and prepared to break his leg. The man, a Moor, was in anguish. The brutal scene continued with more blows breaking his other leg and arms. Despite the excruciating pain, the man remained alive. Witnessing this cruelty, Flaggan felt sickened and horrified. Such acts of inhumanity serve as a reminder of the evil that exists in the world. Later, Ali and Flaggan encountered Sidi Omar and the cadi, discussing a marriage. Omar hinted at a potential revolution, causing a delay. As they strolled, they encountered a frightened boy, and Flaggan observed the city's beauty with a mix of admiration and contemplation. The next day, Mrs. Langley rode to the cadi's palace for the wedding, stopping first to visit Rais Ali's imprisoned bride.|"['1.

Upon entering the city gate, Rais and the ladies got off their horses and walked up a steep street with broad steps towards the citadel. The interpreter then led them down a narrow street to Rais Ali's house, with a remarkable thick oaken door studded with large nails. Inside, they passed through a narrow passage into a small open courtyard with a fountain. Upstairs, they entered a beautifully ornate room with painted tiles, stained-glass windows, and rich decorations. Mrs. Rais Ali, adorned in gold embroidery and jewels, sat contentedly petting a cat. Despite the language barrier, they shared a moment of laughter, breaking the ice and creating a warm atmosphere.|"['1.

After the joyful celebration, Mrs. Langley tried to engage the bride in conversation, but she only responded with brief answers and a giggle. The bride seemed to have little interest in anything outside of household matters. In contrast, Mohammedan women lack proper education and are often naive in their thoughts. The palace, hidden in a narrow lane, had a plain exterior, disguised by beautiful marble columns and intricate carvings at the entrance. Inside, the palace revealed its grandeur with marble pillars, ornate designs, and a bustling atmosphere filled with officials and friends. The women were led to the ladies' chambers on the second floor, passing through a lavish antechamber. The cadi's wife warmly welcomed them into the harem, a mysterious sanctuary forbidden to men. The rooms were adorned with exquisite decorations, from dome-shaped roofs with colored skylights to rich furnishings. In one of the chambers sat Zara, the cadi's youngest daughter, a nineteen-year-old bride whose unfortunate past highlighted the need for women's rights in her society.|"[""1.

Mrs. Langley was amazed by the stunning fairness of many Moorish ladies who were as fair and beautiful as Europeans, revealing their magnificence in dazzling jewels and Oriental attire. The ladies, without their veils, sparkled in jewels like diamonds and rubies, creating a spectacle of splendor. The event, attended only by women due to Islamic customs, was filled with merriment and childlike joy. The British consul's wife, a significant figure, paid compliments to the bride in English and French, later conversing in Turkish. An Italian slave served as an interpreter, facilitating lively exchanges. Coffee and sweet treats were served in delicate porcelain cups, and music accompanied a dance with minimal foot movement and much waving of kerchiefs.

The bride then went up the steps to a shelf in the room, where she sat on cushions to be dressed in bridal clothes. Her outfit was so elaborate that only a lady's pen could describe it accurately. The high head-dress was especially magnificent, and her heavy ornaments made it hard for her to walk without help. Meanwhile, in another room, Fatma and her friends transformed Agnes into a Moor with the help of a slave-girl named Zooloo. They cut Agnes's hair, dyed her eyebrows, nails, and palms, and adorned her face with gold spangles. Agnes was unaware that the changes were semi-permanent. They then dressed her in rich garments. Mrs. Langley was shocked by her daughter's transformation but restrained herself from reacting. Later, Hanyfa and Sidi Hamet discussed the next steps in private.|"[""1.

Giovanni quickly became friends with the Sicilians, learning their sad history as they worked at the artificial neck connecting the island to the mainland. Mariano and his father were tasked with moving stones in intense heat under the watchful eyes of the slave-drivers. Despite the cruelty, some showed hints of humanity, looking away when slaves needed a break. Interactions among the slaves were restricted, with sympathetic individuals separated. Mariano noticed Castello, a fellow slave, exchanging glances and whispers. Castello's mysterious message led to a daring escape attempt, with Mariano tripping a guard into a cellar and Francisco knocking another guard down.

Ten strong slaves joined Castello in a daring escape plan. They swiftly overpowered the guards and raced through the streets, grabbing makeshift weapons on the way. The sudden escape caught bystanders off guard. Despite the alarm being raised, the guards hesitated to pursue, fearing a revolt among the other slaves. As the sun set, the fugitives made a silent dash through the archway, leaving the guards in disarray. The group split up, except for Mariano who stayed with his father. Pursued by the guards, Mariano's quick reflexes saved him from a soldier's attack. With the help of his comrades, they made their way to safety at Pointe Pescade, where a boat awaited them for a chance to escape.

The consul spoke of slaves who tried to escape and are now facing severe punishment. The Dey, angered, questioned the consul's plea for rebels who injured his guards. The consul, respecting the Dey's laws, sought mercy for two slaves tied to his scrivano. The Dey, impressed by the consul's words, agreed to pardon the slaves due to their relation to his scrivano. The Dey then called his secretary to cancel the sentence against the slaves. The consul was invited to see a gift for the Sublime Porte. The gift included horses, jewels, slaves, lions, parrots, and monkeys. The Dey, acknowledging the costliness of the gift, enjoyed the moment with his wise wife.

Ashweesha, though gentle, had a steely resolve. She advised, ""If you don't act against Hamet, he will act against you. I suggest keeping him away from trouble, stroking his ego by assigning him to a respected figure, and subtly reminding him of your authority.""

The Dey pondered Ashweesha's words, seeking the right time to act. Ashweesha proposed involving the British consul's wife to uncover Hamet's plans.

Agnes, excited, entered the room, causing the small negro girl, Zubby, to rock the cradle too vigorously. Zubby's brief expression of remorse was quickly replaced by contentment as Master Jim remained asleep. Mrs. Langley, accustomed to adversity, quickly recovered and decided they should shop before dinner. In those days, shops were holes in the wall, packed with goods.

Mrs. Langley was greeted by Sidi Cadua, a gentle old Turk, at the seraglio. The ladies welcomed her warmly, and Ashweesha joked about Agnes becoming a Mohammedan. Mrs. Langley shared the reason behind Agnes's change, which made the Sultana burst into laughter. The room was adorned with exquisite decorations, from the rich tessellated walls to the carpet of cut velvet adorned with jewels. The walls featured niches with jewellery and Eastern swords and pistols. A gilt four-post bedstead with gold brocade mattresses and blue tiffany curtains embroidered with gold sprigs added to the opulence.

Mrs. Langley was unable to provide much information about Sidi Hassan, as her husband had only briefly mentioned him. The dinner was served in an adjacent room, with a variety of dishes like meat, poultry, and pastries. Little Agnes, forbidden from sweets, was thrilled by the new experience. They sat on cushions around a low silver table, eating from the same dish, Moorish style. The spoons were rosewood with amber tips, and the napkins were embroidered in gold and silver. The main dish was kooskoos, a favorite among the ladies. Agnes felt conflicted enjoying the food despite her mother's rules. Ashweesha tried to learn more about Sidi Hassan but Mrs. Langley had little to share. The British consul's intervention brought hope to some slaves in the gloomy Bagnio.

The new leader was kinder than his predecessor, providing occasional comforts to the hardworking slaves, such as extra bread or a glass of spirits during tough times. Despite maintaining a strict work environment, he brought a slight improvement to the city. However, a darker cloud loomed when Sidi Hamet, commander-in-chief of cavalry, visited the Jew, Bacri, hinting at significant events to come. Bacri, feeling uneasy, engaged in a conversation with Sidi Hamet about a plot unfolding in the city. The Jew shared insights with a young lad, explaining the political dynamics of the city and the impending anarchy caused by the selection of a new Dey.

"""It is dreadful,"" said Bacri, ""that the European powers are aware of this situation in Algiers but still tolerate and even support it through tribute payments and consular presence.

The guards were still on duty for another hour, making it the perfect time for Mariano to embark on his mission. Bacri advised Mariano to wait until the moon was lower in the sky to begin. Mariano made the necessary preparations, securing a rope around his waist and concealing it under a scarf. With a lantern in hand, he was ready to go. Bacri instructed Mariano to follow him to a neighboring house with a roof that could be easily accessed. The irregular rooftop was like a maze, providing cover and a challenge for Mariano's journey. Bacri warned Mariano to tread carefully and to follow his directions precisely. As the moon descended, Mariano was to leap to the next roof, where he would find a friendly face.

Mariano was on a mission in the pirate city, pondering the plight of Christian slaves. As darkness fell, he made a daring leap to safety, narrowly avoiding capture by guards. Hiding in the shadows, he navigated the treacherous streets, extinguishing his lantern to avoid detection. Pressed against a wall, he narrowly escaped soldiers by flattening himself against a pillar. Finally, near the city gate, he lay low beside the head of a fallen man, evading the watchful eyes of a Turkish sentinel.

The guard suddenly halted just as Mariano was about to pounce on him. He peered intently at the dead man's head, contemplating the shadow cast by it. Without advancing, he turned and walked away slowly. The moon's light broke through the clouds, unnerving Mariano and hastening his escape. In a swift move, he secured a rope to scale down the wall and fled towards Frais Vallon. Meanwhile, British seaman Ted Flaggan lay in a hammock in the consul's garden, battling mosquitoes. To amuse himself, he tickled his friend Rais Ali, who retaliated by slapping his own head. Flaggan then enticed Rais Ali for a smoke, and they strolled down the road. Flaggan, a keen observer, shared his thoughts on physiognomy with Rais Ali, hinting at his perceptive nature.|"[""1.

Mariano's encounter with Rais Ali led to a series of events filled with uncertainty and tension. Rushing in, Mariano unintentionally collided with Rais Ali, who responded with a forceful kick.

Despite Mariano's struggles, he found himself unable to break free. Luckily, Rais Ali recovered and helped separate the men.

However, most wealthy residents remained hidden, keeping their valuables and money secure. The Jewish community, in particular, avoided public appearances, with some seeking refuge at the British consulate.

"""Ahoy, Ally Babby!"" called out Ted Flaggan as he approached his friend. ""Guess what? That sneaky little Hadji Baba's daughter has been listening in on us. She's onto something about the Riminis. We need to watch out,"" he warned. Flaggan then inquired about the location of the Riminis' new hideout, as he was due to deliver supplies there the next night. Rais Ali detailed the spot at Frais Vallon, which pleased Mademoiselle Ziffa. Later, Hadji Baba accused his old servant of stealing a diamond ring. The case went to the cadi, who cleverly resolved it by awarding the ring to the servant and punishing Hadji Baba for false accusations. Meanwhile, soldiers captured Francisco and his sons, throwing them back into prison. In the midst of this, several ships arrived in Algiers, bringing a mix of relief and despair to their passengers.

In the past, a Sicilian priest arrived to negotiate the exchange of prisoners and ransom Sicilian slaves. The ransom price varied, with noblemen and wealthy individuals paying up to 400 pounds sterling. Despite the delay in executing the Riminis and other Sicilians, hope arose when Paulina and her sister thought their ransom had been secured. However, they soon realized the priest was only there for Sicilian captives, leading to tears. While Mariano's family would be ransomed, Paulina remained hopeful. Unaware of her lover's fate, she found solace in her baby, while the consul, knowing Mariano's impending doom, struggled to break the news. Efforts for peace between Algerines and Sicilians failed, worsening negotiations. Despite the grim situation, captives' executions were postponed, except for those with no ransom offers. Mariano's fate was altered to being buried alive, showcasing the harsh reality faced by the captives.|"['1.

One evening, Ted Flaggan, a peculiar sailor, decided to attend a ball in disguise. He wore a wild boar skin with tusks, impressing Agnes and Rais Ali, who helped him. To avoid drawing attention, Ted planned to wear the costume later at night. As he left the British consul's residence, an old man warned him of an imminent attack on the city.

However, when he was asked to join a dance, Ted's lack of understanding French led to comical mishaps.

Flaggan's friend, the Moor, guided him through a secret path to a hidden cave near the sea. The Moor, a former pirate, shared the cave's location with Flaggan, ensuring its secrecy. Flaggan, determined to escape, considered living with the Bedouin Arabs in the region. As they navigated the cliffs and entered the cavern, the Moor lit a torch, illuminating the dark space. He advised Flaggan to remain hidden during the day and watch for ships at night. The Moor promised to return with food the next evening before leaving Flaggan alone in the cave.

In a few days, rumors reached Algiers that England was serious about sending a fleet to bombard the city. Colonel Langley discovered that Padre Giovanni's report was partly wrong. The old man misunderstood the message and thought the fleet was near, but it had not left England. During a Mohammedan festival, the Dey heard the news. He was celebrating, deciding whether to punish Denmark and Spain for unpaid tribute. A wrestling match was about to begin in the palace. Guests saw Omar's menagerie with lions, panthers, and monkeys. Slaves were put to work fortifying the city, with some facing death if they didn't finish in time. Mariano feared being buried alive in the concrete blocks he was making. The Dey prepared for defense against England, gathering supplies and troops. A storm damaged the harbor and strained relations with the French consul.

"During a strong windstorm, several Moorish ships were pushed close to the town walls. A French privateer accidentally sank one of the Moorish vessels.

The town and its inhabitants were ready for action, sparking a lively discussion. Everyone agreed that the invaders must be stopped, and Lord Exmouth was chosen to lead the mission. Described as a fearless sea-lion, he was a seasoned sailor who followed in the footsteps of the legendary Nelson. Despite warnings about the impregnable fortifications of Algiers, Lord Exmouth remained determined. He strategically planned to attack with a small fleet, confident in the power of his ships. While most believed a ship needed time to be effective, Lord Exmouth defied expectations by swiftly commissioning, preparing, and leading his fleet to victory in just two months.

Due to a change in plans, Rais Ali was moved to the lighthouse battery. Witnessing the destruction of his comrades' guns, he boldly took charge and loaded the remaining cannon. Before he could fire, a shot from the enemy ship hit, causing chaos. Undeterred, Rais leaped onto the ramparts, defiantly waving his scimitar.

The proud pirate chief, unmoved by the terms read to him, agreed to all. Lord Exmouth ordered a public thanksgiving for the victory over the ferocious enemies. Over 3000 Christian slaves were freed, raising conflicting emotions. Some cheered, wept, or fell on their knees in gratitude. Others, too ill or broken, were carried on board. The sight of their deliverance stirred varied emotions. The long-held slaves, callous to joy or sorrow, faced freedom with indifference, unable to reclaim lost years or loved ones. Omar reluctantly released Paulina Ruffini and her family. Lord Exmouth ensured every captive was set free, although some may have been concealed. In 1816, after centuries of piracy, the Pirate City suffered a fatal blow. Attempts at revival failed, and in 1833, France conquered Algeria, ending the era of piracy.|['1.
