Mr. Melville, eager to see the submarine boat 'Pollard,' emphasized punctuality, hinting at a possible investment. He expressed confidence in Don's capability to lead the boat, citing his experience as a sailor on the family yacht. Mr. Melville envisioned a reorganization of the business with Don as captain, pending their investment.

"""Only sixteen?"" Mr. Melville asked, surprised. ""He's too young to lead a boat-building company. Don is young but experienced. Benson, your youth can stay aboard as crew if Don agrees. It's almost two o'clock,"" Mr. Melville said impatiently, showing his watch to Mr. Farnum. Farnum, distracted, saw a strange craft emerging from the water. Captain Jack Benson steered the boat skillfully to a mooring buoy. Eph Somers, in a navy uniform, secured the boat. Melville teased Don about beating Benson's efficiency. Farnum praised Benson's organization skills. Benson, Hal, and Eph, slightly older from previous adventures, stood on the deck.

"Captain Jack Benson's expression turned pale in an instant. He didn't waver, but he felt a sharp pain in his chest. Hal Hastings let out a quiet gasp. Eph Somers, filled with anger, turned and walked into the motor room. ""I'm set to lead this boat and any others that may be constructed; that's a condition set by my father for providing the needed funds,"" explained Don Melville. ""I will choose my own assistants and crews. If you three prove your competence and show respect for authority, I might find a place for you on this boat and the new one being built. Do you now understand who I am?"" With a touch more warmth, Don Melville bid farewell as he climbed the spiral stairway. Captain Jack, now composed, remarked, ""Don Melville seems to have had a privileged life. He's accustomed to getting his way. But that doesn't mean he's foolish. Wealthy sons are often quite clever. The success of many American fortunes in the second generation proves that."" The three submarine boys soon headed back to shore, feeling heavy-hearted. Despite their efforts to enjoy the village, the weight of apprehension lingered. They realized that their carefree days might be over if Don Melville took command of the ""Pollard.""

During these days, David Pollard, the inventor of the submarine boat, was absent. He was away in secret, working on new inventions for the boat. Jacob Farnum, a trusted friend, handled the business matters. Three boys, Eph, Hal, and Jack, were in the cabin. Eph was determined to confront Farnum about a newcomer taking over. Jack suggested testing the boat's equipment. As Jack left for shore, he met Farnum, who was in a lighthearted mood. Farnum shared his need for capital to expand the business. Jack invited Farnum to watch a demonstration on the 'Pollard.' Farnum had not disclosed plans for a change in command, as another investor was quietly trying to gain control.

"""What is it, sir?"" asked Mr. Melville, turning to Jack. The stern tone used to address him was meant to unsettle the young captain, but it had the opposite effect. Though it caused a quick blush, Jack replied politely. After ensuring everything was prepared, Captain Jack waved to the onlookers on the shore as the ""Pollard"" slowly left its dock, heading to deeper waters. Submerged, the submarine disappeared beneath the surface. Farnum expressed his confidence in Captain Benson, acknowledging his freedom as a captain. Suddenly, Farnum spotted Jack's head above water, swimming back to shore after the submarine sank.

"When the shore boat arrived, Captain Jack inspected the anchor and then returned to shore. Moments later, the conning tower of the ""Pollard"" resurfaced near where it sank. Captain Benson emerged in his uniform, signaling to those on shore. Despite objections from Mr. Melville, the secret remained Captain Benson's.

"Captain Jack Benson, after reaching the ocean floor with the ""Pollard,"" put on his swim gear and entered the tube from the back. Hal Hastings opened the outer port and released compressed air into the tube, propelling Jack out into the water. Using his natural buoyancy, Jack swiftly swam to the surface. To return, he dove down near the anchor cable, grabbed it, and pulled himself back to the outer port of the torpedo tube. Once inside, he knocked on the rear port, prompting Hal to release a moderate amount of compressed air. Eph, inside the boat, closed the forward port. After the rear port opened, Jack crawled back into the boat. The group then discussed the importance of having enough compressed air for the submarine's operations.

Jacob Farnum, in a choked voice, urged everyone not to panic. He rushed to the telegraph station to call for help to raise the 'Pollard' submarine. The newspaper reporters quickly sent out urgent messages for the evening news. The inventor, overwhelmed with relief, almost fainted as the rescue efforts began. The submarine rose to the surface, revealing the crew safe inside. Jack explained that the 'Pollard' was designed to ensure crew safety even in emergencies. Despite curiosity from journalists, Farnum kept the submarine's innovative features confidential.

"None of the thirty skilled individuals in the group could uncover how Captain Jack managed to leave and return to the ""Pollard"" while it was submerged in the harbor. After exploring the boat and sinking with it, Jacob Farnum hosted the group for lunch at his home. With tact, he kept them together until it was time to take them to the train station. This prevented them from falling into the hands of the Melville group. The newspapers the next day praised Captain Jack Benson's work with the ""Pollard"" submarine but failed to mention any rival boatyards in Dunhaven. Jack explained an automatic device he and his friends created for crew members to escape in case of an accident, leaving one member behind to operate it. David Pollard praised their invention and asked about their future plans for it."|"['1.

The newspapers have caused a stir in the Navy Department, hinting at big opportunities for Farnum's submarine boats. David Pollard worked tirelessly to perfect the device that Captain Jack and his friends had planned. Broughton Emerson, a wise man, arrived and showed interest in investing in their venture despite George Melville's doubts. Melville's son, Don, schemed to discredit Jack but failed. Benson offered to share knowledge about the 'Pollard' design. Emerson considered investing but insisted on banning the boys from Farnum's. The group tested an ingenious escape mechanism on the submarine, celebrating its success. Farnum praised the safety of the 'Pollard,' asserting their leadership in submarine technology.|"[""1.

The five friends were overjoyed, shaking hands happily. Eph went to dry off and change, while Jacob Farnum signaled their success with triumphant whistles. Little did they know, a spy was watching, reporting back to Don Melville, who had devious plans to ruin them. Don intended to use Jack to steal valuable submarine designs. Mr. Melville convinced a reluctant investor, Mr. Emerson, to witness the deception. Despite his discomfort, Mr. Emerson agreed to spy on the meeting that evening. He called Jacob Farnum, arranging for him to observe without being seen. The mysterious plan left Mr. Emerson feeling uneasy, but he knew uncovering the truth was essential before investing.|['1.

Pollard found it strange as he thought about the incident. The thief stole important drawings of a new device created by Benson and his friends, causing more distress than losing a large sum of money. Meanwhile, Jacob Farnum followed Mr. Melville and Mr. Emerson discreetly, feeling disgusted with himself for spying. Despite his discomfort, he tried to justify his actions by trusting Emerson. Smoke from a cigarette signaled Don's presence, and a low whistle initiated a secret communication. George Melville felt ashamed when Farnum uncovered his son's involvement. Broughton Emerson stayed behind, observing the unfolding events as a peculiar procession moved through the woods.

As the submarine boat and the gunboat continued on their paths, efforts were made to ensure the comfort of the passengers. The ladies were provided with dry clothes and served coffee.
