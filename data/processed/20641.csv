During the battle at the final house, Captain Bullen was shot in the chest and fell instantly. Seeing this, the Pioneers charged ahead with anger, captured the fort, and attacked its defenders.

His face was shielded from flies with branches for comfort. As they neared camp, a messenger informed them of the incident. The Pioneers gathered to witness Bullen's return, somber and silent.

I must thank you, Colonel, for your kindness since my father's passing. I know I've overstayed, but I understand the need to move to the hills and cannot accompany you. You mentioned going to England for a commission, and I agree. A group of sick individuals leaves tomorrow, and I'll join them to Peshawar. From there, I'll head to Calcutta or Bombay. I have enough funds for the journey. Remember, it's crucial to attend a top-notch school or hire a private tutor to pass the competitive exam for the service.

Lisle explained his plan to the officer, detailing how he would join the sick convoy but slip away briefly to meet Robah for his uniform and rifle.

From what I hear, Colonel Kelly will be the commanding officer of the column, and we could not wish for a better. I hear that there is another column, and a much stronger one, going from Peshawar. That will put us all on our mettle, and I will warrant that we shall be the first to arrive there; not only because we are good marchers, but because the larger the column, the more trouble it has with its baggage.""

""Baggage is the curse of these expeditions. What has to be considered is not how far the troops can go, but how far the baggage animals can keep up with them. Some of the animals are no doubt good, but many of them are altogether unfitted for the work. When these break down they block a whole line; and often, even if the march is a short one, it is very late at night before the last of the baggage comes in; which means that we get neither kit, blankets, nor food, and think ourselves lucky if we get them the next morning.""

In March 1895, a proclamation was issued by the government of India warning the Chitralis not to help Amir Khan. Mr. Robertson, who had to leave Chitral, moved to a fort for safety. Hostilities began, and troops were assembled to march to his aid. A native officer with forty men and ammunition was blocked at Buni, but reinforcements were sent. Lieutenant Edwards' party was detained, and Captain Ross faced an enemy attack in a narrow defile. The coolies dropped their loads and fled when fired upon. Captain Ross decided to retreat to Koragh due to the enemy's strategic advantage. The situation was tense, with troops mobilizing and facing opposition.|"[""1.

Captain Ross commanded Lieutenant Jones to retreat with ten soldiers, secure the lower part of the narrow passage, and protect the withdrawal. Eight men were injured during the retreat. Upon learning this, Captain Ross instructed them to return, seeking shelter in two caves. Their plan was to wait until moonrise to escape. However, they faced a barrage of rocks from above, forcing them back to the caves. An effort to ascend the mountain was thwarted by a cliff, leading them back to the caves for the next day. They decided to break out at 2 a.m. but were met with enemy fire, resulting in casualties including Captain Ross. Lieutenant Jones and his men reached a clearing, providing cover fire to aid more soldiers. After facing enemy charges, they retreated to Buni for defense until reinforcements arrived.

At sunset, the enemy's gunfire stopped during Ramzam, the month when Mahomedans fast from sunrise to sunset. The group gathered on the roofs till dawn, exhausted from a day without food and little water. Half the men left their posts at daybreak for a meal cooked from found flour and a small meat ration. The enemy fired continuously but didn't attack, allowing the men to sleep in turns. Lieutenant Fowler and volunteers fetched water at night. The next day, the enemy charged, but the garrison fought back, causing the assailants to retreat. The following night, they stormed sangars for water but faced heavy firing at the fort. A white flag was raised, an armistice arranged, but it was a trap. British officers were captured during a polo match, and a fierce attack ensued. The garrison under Lieutenant Gurdon held the fort. The news reached Peshawar, prompting the Pioneers to march to Gilgit. Colonel Kelly led the troops, and Major Borradale led the Pioneers, joined by Lieutenant Stewart with two guns.

The soldiers had set up small tents using their waterproof sheets. Colonel Kelly had a tent, while the other officers slept in a cow shed. The group was so small that the pioneers invited others to share meals, each bringing their own utensils. They were warmly welcomed by the locals on their long and challenging march. Upon reaching Gupis, the animals were left behind due to impassable terrain, and locals were hired to carry the baggage. Lisle, enjoying the journey and the camaraderie, had become a favorite among the soldiers. Despite his sorrow over his father's recent passing, Lisle's cheerful demeanor lifted the spirits of his comrades. The soldiers admired his positive outlook and jovial nature, contrasting their own serious demeanor.

Lisle enjoyed night picket duty more than anything else. While others avoided it, he found it delightful to stand alone, rifle in hand, watching the snow for any movement. The silence soothed him, allowing him to reflect on the past better than in his tent. Lisle's sharp eyesight helped him spot lurking threats, impressing his comrades with his accuracy. He attributed his skill to practicing with his father's rifle during hunting trips. One night, during a quiet day, Lisle's picket was attacked.

The defenders also sprang to their feet, and their rifles flashed out with a stream of fire. But the vacancies thus caused in the enemy's ranks were immediately filled. Then, with a cheer, the six men and the sergeant rushed forward. Much as the Afridis feared the bayonet, confident in their strength they withstood the charge. They had, fortunately, emptied their rifles before rushing forward but, drawing their knives, they fought fiercely.

Lisle bravely faced the challenges, making light of difficulties and lifting his comrades' spirits with jokes. Escaping thirst, he volunteered to help build defenses upon arriving at Laspur. The next day, the remaining forces joined the camp and spotted enemy campfires three miles away. Despite the small force, they refrained from attacking and returned. The following day was spent preparing for advancement, recruiting native coolies and gathering supplies. A native chief provided coolies who proved invaluable in work and intelligence gathering. The troops left the snow behind at Rahman, learning of an imminent enemy confrontation near Mastuj. Lieutenant Beynon scouted the enemy's position and reported back for an attack the next day.

The battle lasted an hour after the first shot. Our side had one man severely wounded and three slightly injured. After a brief break, the troops moved on and stopped at a nearby village. They found a ford, crossed it, and encountered part of the enemy garrison. The baggage column was under attack, and the 4th company was ordered to help. They rushed to the scene, scattering along the baggage line. The enemy retreated briefly but regrouped. The officer decided to hold the position to protect the baggage. The Punjabis, led by an English officer, climbed a steep hill to engage the enemy. Despite being outnumbered, they drove the enemy back. A defensive wall was quickly built, providing cover from enemy fire. The Punjabis then focused on another enemy group across the valley.

The leader's defeat demoralized the tribesmen, who retreated as we fired at them. We pursued them up the hill, causing many casualties. The colonel praised the young man's sharpshooting skills and decided to reward him with twenty rupees. The colonel commended the young man for his bravery in battle and expressed his desire to see him receive a commission instead of pursuing traditional education. The force arrived at Mastuj, finding the garrison well-established. The next day, a group was sent to destroy the enemy's defenses, and the remaining Pioneers arrived.

When they arrived at the open field, they discovered it was a gentle, grassy slope. The troops were organized with two companies in the front line, two in support, and the Kashmir company in reserve. They advanced in this formation until they faced enemy fire from the fortified sangars. Stewart deployed his cannons. Eventually, the levies' gunfire forced the enemy out of one sangar, while three Pioneer companies focused on another. Beynon was sent to scout a path down to the valley but found a steep drop. With ropes and ladders, the sappers descended to the streambed. A dynamite explosion halted their progress. Lisle, armed with a rifle, joined the sappers in engaging the enemy.

The situation at the fort was grim. The men were suffering from poor health due to their long confinement, limited food, and unsanitary conditions. They were unaware of the approaching forces of Colonel Kelly or Sir Robert Low. However, during a truce, they raised a union jack as a symbol of defiance, boosting morale within the fort.

The battle was fierce as the Gordon Highlanders and the Borderers faced strong resistance during their direct attack. The hillside was ablaze with fire as the Scottish regiments pushed forward, supported by gunfire. The enemy, unable to hold their sangars, fled down the slopes. The action lasted from 8:30 A.M. to 2 P.M., resulting in significant losses for the enemy. The 1st Brigade then moved to the Swat Valley, while the 2nd Brigade took their place. The enemy attempted to attack, but the mountain battery and troops repelled them. The tribes in the Swat Valley were shocked by the capture of the passes, as they had never been breached before. Despite initial hostilities, the tribes came to respect the magnanimity of the British forces. On the 5th of April, the 1st Brigade camped, while the 2nd Brigade advanced.

On the 9th, the main command met up with the 2nd Brigade at Chakdara, and the 3rd Brigade set up camp on the river's southern side. By the 11th, the main command and the 2nd Brigade reached the Panjkora River. A bridge was constructed, but on the 13th, a flood washed it away just as it was completed. A group was dispatched at dawn to burn the villages that had been attacking the 2nd Brigade. Despite completing their mission, they were ambushed by a large enemy force. With the bridge gone, the situation turned perilous, and a retreat was signaled. The Brigade covered their withdrawal from the opposite bank. The enemy pursued fiercely, causing casualties. The force then fortified themselves with the help of a Maxim gun and endured heavy enemy fire overnight. The next day, the 4th Sikhs crossed on rafts to join them after more than two days without food. Another bridge was swiftly built in 48 hours to restore communication.|"[""**1.

"""It was an impressive feat for a young man to plan and execute,"" one remarked. ""Not many could maintain such character, let alone engage in a campaign. I'm certain, Colonel, we all hope his commission request is approved; he truly deserves it."" The remainder of the campaign was uneventful. Lisle smoothly transitioned back to his previous life, now as an officer. Having already grasped much of the work, he easily picked up the rest of his duties. By the time the regiment returned to Peshawar, he was as competent as other officers. Lisle received a sum from his agents in Calcutta, enabling him to cover his mess expenses. The journey down was pleasant, with no rush needed. The men were jubilant over their successful mission to aid Chitral's garrison. Lisle was delighted to learn he had been gazetted as a lieutenant, dating from their arrival at Chitral. He expressed gratitude for the opportunity, despite his reluctance to leave the regiment. After outfitting in Peshawar, he proceeded to join his regiment at Rawalpindi. There, he was warmly welcomed and introduced to the other officers. Lisle shared his background, revealing his birth in India and his father's military service.

Colonel Kelly praised Lisle for his bravery and quick thinking during a dangerous mission. Lisle, who had disguised himself as a private to join the regiment, impressed the officers with his courage and resourcefulness. Despite being only sixteen, Lisle's actions earned him a temporary officer position. The men in his new regiment admired him for his kindness and willingness to connect with them. Lisle found himself welcomed by the officers' wives, who were fascinated by his story. Life at the station was filled with social activities like tennis, dinners, and dances. Lisle excelled at sports but avoided gambling, unlike some officers who were drawn to high-stakes games like baccarat. One lieutenant, in particular, struggled with gambling and often paid with IOUs. Lisle tried to advise his friend against reckless behavior, but the lieutenant found it hard to resist the allure of the game.|"['1.

It is true that I owe a significant amount of money to Sanders. He has purchased all my IOUs, and now he insists that I repay him promptly. Despite having only eighteen hundred pounds from my late aunt, which barely covers my debt, I fear I may need to resign. However, Lisle suggests a different approach. He believes Sanders cheats at baccarat, withdrawing money when the dealer is strong and adding to his stake when the dealer is weak. Lisle proposes that if we catch Sanders cheating with the help of a few others, I could avoid paying him. While accusing someone of cheating is serious, the stakes are high for me. With the support of Lindsay, Holmes, and Tritton, we could expose Sanders and prevent further financial ruin for me and other officers.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat does the speaker owe to Sanders?\nA) His late aunt's inheritance\nB) All his belongings\nC) A significant amount of money\nD) A valuable painting\nE) A luxurious estate"", ""Question 2:\nWhat is Lisle's suggestion to avoid repaying Sanders?\nA) Borrowing more money from friends\nB) Selling his late aunt's belongings\nC) Accusing Sanders of cheating at baccarat\nD) Working extra hours to earn more money\nE) Ignoring Sanders' demands"", 'Question 3:\nWho supports the speaker in exposing Sanders?\nA) Lisle\nB) Sanders\nC) The dealer\nD) Lindsay\nE) Tritton', 'Question 4:\nWhat does Lisle believe Sanders does during baccarat games?\nA) Withdraws money when the dealer is weak\nB) Adds to his stake when the dealer is strong\nC) Plays fairly at all times\nD) Cheats by switching cards\nE) Gambles with borrowed money', ""Question 5:\nWhat is the potential consequence of accusing Sanders of cheating?\nA) Financial gain for the speaker\nB) Legal trouble for the speaker\nC) Increased debt for the speaker\nD) Loss of friends' support\nE) Improved reputation for the speaker"", ""Question 6:\nWho could help the speaker expose Sanders according to the passage?\nA) Sanders and Lisle\nB) Sanders and the dealer\nC) Lindsay, Holmes, and Tritton\nD) The late aunt\nE) The speaker's creditors""]"|['C) A significant amount of money', 'C) Accusing Sanders of cheating at baccarat', 'D) Lindsay', 'B) Adds to his stake when the dealer is weak', 'B) Legal trouble for the speaker', 'C) Lindsay, Holmes, and Tritton']
Tonight, four young officers gathered to watch Captain Sanders closely. They observed his trick at the card table. Sanders would place five sovereigns under his hand, then push out the card. If he believed it was a good card, he would withdraw four sovereigns, leaving one. If he thought it was bad, he would leave all five. The officers, including Lisle, noticed Sanders closely watching the dealer's reactions. They saw him leave two sovereigns on moderate cards but only one or five on extreme cards. When Sanders was caught with four sovereigns under his hand, Lisle exposed the trick. Sanders attempted to strike Lisle but was restrained by the officers. The colonel arrived, and Lisle explained the situation, backed by the observations of the other officers. The colonel promised to investigate the matter further.|"['1.

The colonel expressed hope that the unpleasant situation had been resolved. Sanders, a soldier, urgently had to leave for England due to family matters. The decision was made to hold off on discussing the issue to avoid tarnishing the reputation of both regiments. The officers were instructed not to mention the incident outside the regiment.

Lisle quickly became a favorite among the officers and the ladies of the regiment due to his exceptional skills in shooting and cricket. The tension on the frontier escalated as news of tribes rising and attacks spread. The Mad Mullah, claiming miraculous powers, incited the tribes to revolt.

To fight the tough enemies with strong positions, a large force was needed. Time was essential to gather the troops and the necessary supplies. While preparations were underway, an expedition from Peshawar was sent to the Mohmund country before the main operation began. The Malakand division and Mohmund field force were tasked with punishing the tribes between Lalpura and the Swat River. Colonel Meiklejohn advanced to Malakand to relieve the garrison, facing heavy enemy fire. Sir Bindon Blood took command, with Colonel Goldney successfully flanking and routing the enemy. The main column faced opposition but eventually overcame it. The enemy was driven out, and many were captured or killed. The casualties during the Malakand fighting were significant, with the garrison at Chakdara holding out. The fort was under siege, but the troops defended it bravely.|"['1.

They reached the village of Palel, garrisoned by Manipuri soldiers, whom they defeated. Moving on, they faced more challenges, including a bridge set on fire and the enemy fortified in trenches.

The night passed peacefully. At dawn, the enemy approached, but Lieutenant Grant deployed thirty men to hold them back. When the enemy returned in the afternoon with a large force, Grant strategically positioned his men and opened fire, causing heavy casualties. Despite the enemy's artillery fire, Grant's men held their ground. As darkness fell, the enemy tried to outflank them, but Grant's clever tactics forced them to retreat. Grant's bold actions and deceptive strategies kept the enemy at bay, leading to negotiations and a temporary ceasefire.

In 1877, a canal project near the Swat river led to a deadly clash with Swat villagers at Sappri. The British envoy, Cavagnari, demanded justice for the coolies' murder, but the Khan ignored him. With troops at Murdan, Cavagnari kept his mission secret until the last moment. The soldiers, surprised by the sudden call to arms, prepared for battle. Despite facing a smaller force, the British were unprepared for the fierce resistance they encountered. The intense heat and lack of supplies made the battle challenging. The cavalry's failure to support worsened the situation, leading to a disastrous defeat. The day ended in chaos, with many lives lost and a retreat to Kandahar.

The fort was a formidable structure, with solid stone walls, fortified by mud and timber. These walls stood at a towering height of fourteen feet and a thickness of eight feet, topped with towers and battlements for defense. In front of the main gate, a concealed loopholed wall shielded the entrance, followed by a deep ditch filled with obstacles. A band of obstacles extended to a steep spur from a nearby mountain. Despite attempts to breach the fort with mountain guns, a direct assault was necessary. Ghoorkhas and sappers charged the west wall, breaching a weak point in the obstacles and gaining access to the courtyard. Captain Aylmer, R.E., used gun cotton to breach the main entrenchment, sustaining severe injuries in the process. The daring attack caught the enemy off guard, leading to the fort's capture. Subsequent efforts to ascend a ravine led to a successful storming of the enemy's position, showcasing remarkable bravery and tactical skill.|"['1.

Major Daniels decided to go on the offensive and attack the enemy who had gathered in large numbers in a nearby village. At 3:30 PM, Moberley led thirty-five men to launch an assault on the village. Despite fierce fighting and some casualties, they managed to secure a position in the outer houses. However, due to the village's strong defense and Moberley's severe injury, they retreated to the fort. The enemy continued firing until 8:30 PM when Major Daniels, with only a hundred and forty men, decided to attack again, despite facing four to five thousand foes. Dividing his forces, he approached the village from two sides. The battle lasted two hours, resulting in heavy casualties, including Major Daniels. The remaining troops retreated to the fort by 11:30 PM. The native troops faced a daunting task attacking a heavily fortified village with overwhelming numbers.

Upon reaching Khusalghar, the soldiers discovered numerous regiments already stationed there with a vast amount of supplies and luggage. The officers promptly inspected the fort, previously defended by brave Sikhs who valiantly fought until the end against the enemy. Even when outnumbered, the Sikhs displayed remarkable courage. After a brief stay, the regiment proceeded to Shinawari to join forces for the upcoming mission. General Lockhart's column was stationed at Fort Lockhart, approximately thirty miles away, unable to provide immediate assistance due to challenging terrain and strong enemy presence. The assembled force at Shinawari included various regiments and artillery units. The soldiers were accompanied by an extensive convoy of transport animals and camp followers.

The Ghoorkhas advanced in two quick pushes towards the summit, causing the enemy to flee. However, upon discovering a village nestled in the plateau's hollow and enemy defenses along the ridge, they were recalled by the general. General Westmacott, waiting for two hours, was about to retreat due to enemy movements threatening their left rear. Just in time, General Kempster arrived after facing resistance and losing two officers. General Lockhart was stationed at his fort with a regiment while planning to divide the forces in the Khanki Valley. The reconnaissance aimed to assess a passable route for baggage. The withdrawal was necessary due to the lack of water, enemy massing potential, and unprepared commissariat. After three days, General Yeatman-Biggs' column began the ascent up the Chagru Pass, encountering enemy forces at the Dargai crest, leading to intense combat.|"['1.

Tomorrow morning, General Gazelee was set to launch his attack. Generals Westmacott, Kempster, and Hart, along with their artillery, were positioned at the base of the pass to provide support. The troops advanced in a specific order: first came the Queens, followed by the 2nd and 4th Ghoorkhas, Yorks, and 3rd Sikhs, with the 30th Sikhs, Scottish Borderers, and Northamptons trailing behind. As dawn broke, the enemy's fires were visible on the distant ridges. Despite a slight delay, the batteries moved forward. The enemy fired the first shot at half-past six and quickly retreated. The regiments advanced steadily, with the artillery opening fire at half-past seven, forcing the enemy back. The Ghoorkhas and Queens faced enemy fire but managed to drive them out with the help of the Sikhs and Borderers. The pass was eventually secured, and the troops descended into the Mastura Valley. The tribesmen had fled, leaving their homes ablaze. The valley was lush with groves, and the troops, running low on provisions, resorted to making chupatties from the flour found in the villages. Casualties were minimal, and the soldiers hoped for little resistance ahead. After a day's rest, the 3rd and 4th Brigades were ordered to move at daybreak, with the 2nd Brigade following suit.

As the troops entered the valley, they were surprised by the lack of resistance. The livestock was gone, but each house was stocked with provisions like Indian corn, wheat, and potatoes. Bagh was the center of the tribe, where orders to attack the British were issued. The mosque, with its mud roof and twenty-one pillars, was left untouched. Despite initial peace, the enemy attacked a foraging party and a baggage train. The troops settled in, awaiting surrender terms from the Afridis. Negotiations were tense, with the tribesmen reluctant to give up their rifles. The camp faced nightly attacks, and a foraging party was ambushed. Captain Rowcroft's group was trapped but rescued just in time. General Westmacott retaliated, setting the eastern valley ablaze. Unfortunately, Captain Watson was fatally shot during the chaos.|['1.

On the 9th, a reconnaissance mission was launched towards Saransur, a tall peak east of Maidan valley. General Westmacott led two British and two Sikh regiments, along with two batteries and Madras Sappers, towards the pass leading to Peshawar. The terrain was rugged, with hummocks and boulders, making the advance challenging. The troops faced shots from well-built sangars as they approached the hillside. Despite the enemy's gunfire, the Northamptons and Sikhs ascended the steep cliff, facing magazine fire but pushing forward. By eleven, they secured the summit, driving the enemy away. The intelligence officers noted signs of the Zakka-Khels tribe's presence. Concerned about a potential enemy return, the force began its return march at two o'clock, facing an ambush that caused casualties.

As the Northamptons retreated through the forest, the first four groups passed without trouble. But when the fifth group reached the open area, they were met with a sudden attack. The wounded soldiers slowed the retreat, and it wasn't until evening that they reached the base of the hill. The enemy, familiar with the terrain, took advantage of the landscape to gain the upper hand. They started advancing through the ravines, increasing their numbers rapidly. Casualties rose as soldiers tried to carry their injured comrades to safety, becoming easy targets. Despite the intense engagement, the Northamptons persisted in rescuing their wounded.

A fierce battle ensued as the enemy, misled by a small rear guard, attacked with overwhelming numbers. Captain Abbott, low on ammunition and facing many wounded soldiers, called for reinforcements.

The plan was well thought out. Before dawn, the luggage was packed. The Ghoorkhas were to go up the hills beside the village, with three Borderers companies leading. The wounded soldiers were to follow on stretchers, and the mountain battery would position itself to protect the retreat. By 8 a.m., the last of the luggage was close to the stream. The signal was sent to the outposts using heliographs. The Sikhs, joined by a Borderers company, fought off an attack on the baggage by Pathans. Despite some losses, the troops made it through the gorge safely. Lisle, who fell into the water during the fighting, was saved by an Afridi leader. He was held captive in a village, where he plotted his escape.|['1. What was the initial plan for the retreat?\nA. To stay and defend the village\nB. To retreat through the gorge\nC.

On the tenth day, he was finally able to walk with less difficulty. One morning, he noticed the women of the house gathered around the guards, discussing something exciting. It seemed like news had arrived from the Tirah valley. Knowing everyone in the house was present, he quietly made his way downstairs. He found men's clothes hanging on the wall and quickly grabbed a disguise. Confident he wouldn't be disturbed, he hid the clothes in his room. As the women were still occupied, he descended to the storehouse below. Spotting a coil of rope, he took it upstairs and hid it. The day passed calmly, and as night fell, he changed into the disguise, secured a rope, and quietly escaped the house. Evading the guards, he headed towards the valley, waded through a river, and finally rested among the rocks. The next morning, he observed a group of tribesmen pass by, assuming he had joined the British camp, allowing him to remain hidden.|"['1.

He felt the need to give his leg another day of rest before moving on. The next day, he felt very thirsty but didn't risk going to the river. As darkness fell, he resumed his journey. Soon, he spotted something white behind a rock - the body of a fallen Afridi warrior. Next to the body was a Lee-Metford rifle, a valuable discovery. To avoid being recognized due to his distinct garments, he dressed in the warrior's clothes and armed himself. He also camouflaged his face with plant juice. As he approached the Maidan, he noticed a gathering of natives and distant gunfire. Realizing he couldn't reach the camp unnoticed, he decided to join the British troops engaged in a skirmish.

After a brief lull in the gunfire, sporadic shots echoed around the camp as night fell. Lisle fearlessly crept closer, spotting Afridis in white dresses behind rocks.

Lisle, once known as 'the boy' among his comrades, had matured at the age of eighteen due to his experiences. He returned to find himself promoted to a full lieutenant. The regiment had seen changes with new officers joining and casualties in battle. The troops under General Lockhart were unaware of the Mohmund hill force's operations until the commander's visit. Orders were given to march through the Mohmund country towards Shabkadr. The force successfully seized the bridge over the Panjkora. General Meiklejohn managed the line of communication as the brigades crossed the Panjkora. An attack on the camp at the foot of the Ramjak Pass occurred, leading to casualties. Despite the darkness, the troops defended the camp and later pursued the enemy. The next day, the force continued its march up the valley, encountering the enemy in a village on the hill.|"[""1.

Two groups of the 35th Sikhs were ambushed by a large enemy force. Despite fighting bravely, they were forced to retreat due to their wounded comrades. The enemy closed in, attacking fiercely with swords, causing severe casualties among the Sikhs. Fortunately, reinforcements from the Buffs and the 11th Bengal Lancers arrived in time to drive the enemy back. Meanwhile, the third detachment, after destroying villages, joined the main force. The guns provided cover fire as the Sikhs on a hill ran low on ammunition and faced heavy enemy pressure. The Guides regiment came to their aid, fighting off the tribesmen. Despite a storm and losing their way, they eventually reached camp safely. General Jeffreys returned with his brigade, and a village was fortified for defense.

At midnight, four groups of soldiers returned after searching for the general, clearing the enemy from the village. The battle was fierce, with heavy casualties - two officers and thirty-six soldiers killed, and five officers with a hundred and two soldiers wounded. The next day, the troops set off towards a fortified village in the valley, about six miles away. As they approached, the enemy prepared for an attack. The soldiers from different regiments stormed the heights, while the Guides destroyed the village without any losses. They collected grain and captured several villages. Despite facing enemy resistance, the arrival of Bengal Lancers always made the tribesmen flee.

The enemy became bolder, with only a small distance between them and Captain Uniacke's troops. In a risky move, Captain Uniacke decided to entrench for the night. He led a small group to hold a house against a hundred tribesmen. By pretending to have more men than he did, he scared off the enemy with a clever bluff. As night fell, anxiety grew as reports came in of looting and attacks on followers near the camp. A rescue mission was launched to save the rear guard. Despite challenges and confusion, the troops managed to regroup and continue their march the next day. The brigade's order was rearranged, with the 23rd leading the way and special instructions for flanking parties.

The Barkhe ford was the next obstacle encountered by General Westmacott's forces. As they advanced, a clash with the enemy ensued, resulting in a fierce battle. The fighting was intense, with the ammunition running low for some regiments. Despite the challenging terrain and continuous enemy attacks, General Westmacott's troops showed great courage and resilience, defending their position with determination. Eventually, after a grueling day of fighting, the forces were able to secure a ridge for the night, fending off a final rush by the Afridis. The night in camp was harsh, with no provisions and bitter cold. The next day, the troops continued their march, facing further resistance from the enemy as they made their way to Swaikot.

The first phase of the Tirah expedition came to a close as the rear guard concluded their march. The mission had achieved its goal by punishing the Afridis and demonstrating the reach of the British Government.

The infantry and artillery had arrived, causing the enemy to retreat to a village two miles away. A squadron of the Guides attacked and dispersed them into the hills. Simultaneously, our camp faced an assault, but the guard successfully defended it, causing the enemy to scatter and seek surrender. This battle dampened the natives' spirits, allowing our column to move through their territory without resistance. Mr. Bullen's bravery led to his promotion to a vacant aide-de-camp position due to his gallant defense of a hut. Despite his initial reluctance, he accepted the offer, recognizing the opportunities it could bring. Assigned to reconnoitre a pass, Lisle found himself under fire, sacrificing his horse to save his life, earning the admiration of the enemy leader and the tribesmen.|"[""1.

When the work began, Lisle offered to help defend the village. The chief accepted his aid, and Lisle worked hard alongside the villagers. There were only three towers for defense, and everyone gathered in them. Men and women worked together to fortify the village. The livestock were kept inside with a strong guard. After two weeks, the enemy approached. The cattle were brought in, and the villagers prepared for battle. Lisle asked for a rifle but had to settle for a pistol and a sword. He proved to be a skilled shot, taking down the enemy leaders. The defenders held their ground behind the hedge, inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers. When the enemy tried to rush the village, the chief's strategic plan and the defenders' accurate shooting repelled the assault, causing the enemy to retreat.|"['1.

The leader quickly commanded his soldiers to stop shooting and take cover on the lower level, made of sturdy stone walls that bullets couldn't penetrate, unlike the upper floor. The enemy kept firing rapidly but eventually ceased when they received no response. After a long pause, the leader signaled for ropes soaked in oil to be brought up quietly. The ropes were cut into three-foot pieces, and they waited as darkness fell. Suddenly, the attackers rushed in, but the defenders fought back fiercely, causing the assailants to retreat. The next morning, the enemy offered a truce to retrieve their dead and wounded, agreeing to the old terms. Despite the peace, the chief warned of a lasting blood feud and the need to stay vigilant in the future. Lisle, having learned the language, was informed of the dangers of leaving due to ongoing tensions. Precautions were taken against further attacks, with guards stationed all night. Though there were attempts at surprise attacks, the garrison's readiness thwarted them. Lisle, content with his stay, was treated well by the villagers and the chief's family.|['1.

Furthermore, once having shown them our strength, it would be a shame to diminish it further. In the event of a Russian invasion of India, these fighters would fiercely resist.

Colonel Willcocks was a source of comfort for Lisle during a difficult time. Lisle, who had won the V.C., was feeling unwell and disoriented. However, under the care of the colonel, he gradually recovered. Lisle's memory improved, and he decided to visit his aunt in Somersetshire. Later, he received a summons from the War Office to join an expedition to Coomassie. Lisle quickly made preparations and set off for Liverpool. On board, he met other officers bound for Africa. They were disappointed not to be heading to South Africa but hoped for opportunities to distinguish themselves. Upon arrival at Cape Coast, they learned about the formidable Ashanti tribe and the ongoing conflict. Despite the unexpected mission, the officers were ready for the challenges ahead.|['1.

Sir Francis Scott led an expedition against the Ashantis to curb their rebellious spirit. A small garrison was left to control the capital, and the king was captured. The Ashantis, though aware of white soldiers' superiority, underestimated the black troops. The force at Cape Coast, comprising the Hausa Constabulary and two guns, was deemed insufficient. Troops from Sierra Leone, Lagos, and Nigeria were gathered, armed with modern weapons. The men, mainly Hausas and Yorubas, were confident in their abilities. The challenge lay in organizing these troops, especially those from Northern Nigeria, scattered over vast distances. Despite facing rough seas, the troops were ready to disembark and confront the Ashantis, marking a unique war led by native troops.|"[""1.

Most of our troops are unable to advance, with their posts nearly surrounded. News of the fort's siege reached Cambarga, 340 miles from Coomassie, on April 18th. Three British officers and 170 men, armed with a Maxim and seven-pounder, led by Major Morris, marched to Kintanpo. After 13 days, the force grew to seven officers, 330 soldiers, and 83 native levies. They faced opposition near N'Quanta, with a successful engagement and some casualties. Later, they encountered an ambush and had continuous fighting. Major Morris was injured, but Captain Maguire captured a stockade. Two more stockades were passed without resistance due to a brief truce with the besieged garrison. The force was the third reinforcement, following troops from Gold Coast and Lagos. Captain Hall's contingent from Northern Nigeria also moved forward, securing a treaty with the Adansi king before reaching Coomassie.|"['1.

The Ashanti tribe, known for their fierceness, was kept in check by Esumeja's occupation. Captain Hall was joined by a hundred troops from Lagos and fifty Sierra Leone frontier police. The force's strategic position on the main march line was crucial in intimidating the Kokofu and aiding further relief efforts. The garrison at Coomassie was well-equipped to defend the fort but faced shortages of ammunition and supplies. The construction of stockades by the Bekwais complicated matters, as they were hidden by the bush, surprising approaching troops. The next morning, Nigerian troops arrived, and Lisle, a V.C. holder, was appointed to lead a company. The town had European houses owned by mixed-race natives descended from British merchants. Women bore the burden of work, showcasing superior physique and upright posture from carrying loads on their heads.

A narrow valley stretched from the shore up to a swamp behind the town, where all the waste was dumped, causing a foul smell and spreading fever. The Dutch and British governors neglected to improve the town's sanitation due to lack of funds. Nigerian troops arrived, and Lisle took charge of a company. They marched into the forest, where shooting skills were less important. The Adansi tribe attacked, causing chaos. Colonel Wilkinson ordered a halt, awaiting more reinforcements. The troops set out on a rainy morning, struggling through dense forest. They camped at Akroful, facing a storm.

The damp air, heavy with the scent of rotting plants, the stillness in the air, and the quietness broken only by the drip of water, weighed on the soldiers' morale. The ground had turned into mud from recent rains, making the journey to Mansu challenging. At Mansu, carriers deserted, prompting a search for replacements. A telegram was sent to Cape Coast to arrest deserters. Mansu, a more pleasant stop, had bungalows for officers and a clearing. The soldiers enjoyed fires, creating a picturesque scene at night. The officers found the march gloomy, contrasting the cheerful native troops. Lisle and Hallett, close friends, checked the camp's status after a hearty meal.

On the afternoon of the following day, the troops reached Prahsu after marching twenty miles. Most of the buildings were offices and stores, but a few tents were set up for shelter. They quickly built huts using bamboo and palm leaves. The Prah, a river about 150 yards wide, surrounded three sides of their position. To cross, they used old pontoons and canoes found from a previous expedition. Messages arrived from Captain Hall detailing battles at Kokofu and Kwisa. As they advanced, they encountered a village called Dompoasi with a well-defended stockade. Captain Roupell, leading the advance, was ambushed near the stockade but fought back with rifles and cannons, despite sustaining injuries.|['1.

Lieutenant Edwardes, despite being wounded early in the battle, bravely continued to operate his gun. His team lay injured around him, but he managed to fire shells using a stick. Even after being shot in the left arm, he switched to a Maxim gun and kept fighting until a shot to the face forced him to seek medical help. Colonel Carter was also wounded and passed command to Colonel Wilkinson, who led despite his own injury. The soldiers charged the enemy's stockade, forcing them to retreat.

When the group continued marching, they took great care to avoid any surprises. A small team of twelve men walked ahead and fired shots now and then. In dense areas, scouts cleared a path with their bayonets. Progress was slow, only moving three-quarters of a mile per hour. Carriers struggled on cheerfully, trudging through mud and occasionally stumbling. Gun carriers faced the toughest challenge, needing four men to carry the heavy parts on bamboo poles. Despite the hardships, the group pushed forward. They crossed the rising Fum River, facing challenges due to its increased volume. After failed attempts with a raft, Lisle discovered bamboo could be used to build a more suitable raft. This innovative idea provided a solution to their river crossing dilemma.|"['1.

In a short time, the entire small group and carriers were busy dismantling the huts. An issue arose about how to tie the stakes together. During the discussion, Lisle proposed a solution that was quickly accepted. Creepers from the forest were used to tie bundles of bamboo with crosspieces to create makeshift hammocks carried by four men. The telegraph wire was utilized to create a contraption to cross swift streams while keeping the rice dry. The successful experiment brought relief to everyone. The next day, fifty soldiers and extra ammunition arrived to reinforce the garrison at Fumsu. Despite crossing four rivers and covering five miles without incident, the troops encountered heavy fire while ascending a steep hill. Captain Wilson tragically lost his life in the skirmish.

I wonder what the next move will be. At any rate, we shall be in good shape at Prahsu, and can regain our strength before moving again. There should be plenty of supplies there, and Hall and Wilkinson might be low on food. One day, they encountered a deep river that blocked their path. The Pioneers estimated it would take two days to build a bridge. Facing a food shortage, a plan was needed. Lisle decided to swim across with a Sikh soldier. They laid a wire to guide them across the river. Lisle prepared for the swim, armed and ready. The plan was for the Sikh to swim with him, securing the wire on the opposite bank.

Lisle emphasized the importance of determining the enemy's whereabouts and ensuring the safety of their friends. If the Ashantis had retreated, they could swim across the river to join their allies. However, if the Ashantis remained, it indicated a lack of a ford. After finding an abandoned village with fruits, they swam back across the river. The distant sounds of gunfire confirmed the Ashantis' presence. Lisle predicted a tough journey back to camp due to the enemy's increasing numbers.

"Lisle and his companion found themselves in a challenging situation when they were suddenly confronted by four natives. Unsure of their intentions, the two men sought refuge in the divisions of a giant cotton tree. These divisions, acting as sturdy buttresses, provided protection from the natives' gunfire.

In a swift exchange, Lisle managed to defend himself using his revolver, causing two natives to fall. The remaining native, realizing the odds were against him, fled the scene. Despite being wounded, Lisle decided to head back to camp for reinforcements, leaving his companion with provisions for safety.

Upon reaching camp late in the evening, Lisle was greeted with relief and surprise by his comrades, who had feared the worst. Exhausted but determined to continue, Lisle recounted the events that had transpired, revealing the victory of the British force over their assailants.

As Lisle replenished his strength with food and drink, the camaraderie among the soldiers shone through, celebrating his return from what seemed like a perilous situation."|"['1.

We set up camp just three miles from the river, hoping you'd arrive by morning. At daybreak, we faced a serious threat. We left a few men to protect our group and sent out two companies on each side to engage the enemy. They fought bravely, leaving many behind when they retreated. The river's current carried us across to the opposite shore, where we hid under bushes, listening to enemy chatter. The next day, the voices stopped, and we headed towards camp, finding it abandoned as expected, with the Ashantis in pursuit. As we moved through the forest, we heard distant gunfire and saw the enemy fleeing in fear. We took cover near a cotton tree when four men approached. Despite being outnumbered, we managed to defend ourselves. I tended to a wounded Sikh, leaving him armed before rushing for help. The Sikhs, upon hearing of their injured comrade, immediately volunteered to assist. We prepared to move out, anticipating a surprised enemy if they returned.|"['1.

The colonel commended the Sikhs for their bravery and ordered them to rest and eat. He left two companies for protection, confident the enemy wouldn't attack until the afternoon.

While stationed at Prahsu, the soldiers were left with idle time, wondering about their next actions. Colonel Willcocks, keeping his strategies secret, noticed that the enemy somehow got wind of their plans. Several wounded officers were sent back home due to the lack of medical equipment in the colony to remove bullets. Meanwhile, reinforcements from the West African Regiment and other troops were en route. As Colonel Burroughs arrived with a strong group, preparations were made to advance. False alarms and grumbling ensued, but eventually, the soldiers resumed their duties. They received minimal rations, with only a pound of rice a day. Scouts were deployed to clear the main road and locate ambushes. A French letter arrived, urging for urgent supplies and warning of enemy fortifications. Despite efforts to seek help, no assistance arrived. Sir Frederick Hodgson was making his way back with an escort. Colonel Burroughs encountered resistance on the journey north, engaging in a fierce battle at Sheramasi and Kwisa, where the village had been destroyed. The troops proceeded cautiously towards Dompoasi, anticipating another intense confrontation.|['1.

The heavy rain worked in favor of our troops as it masked their approach on the enemy's camp near Kwisa. While the enemy was caught off guard during their evening meal, our troops swiftly advanced into the village. Chaos erupted as the enemy scrambled in confusion, attempting to defend themselves. Despite their efforts, our troops managed to capture guns, ammunition, and supplies without any casualties. The following day, the troops destroyed enemy stockades and buried the fallen. A subsequent attack on Kokofu proved challenging, resulting in casualties on both sides. Eventually, the troops safely retreated to Bekwai. Meanwhile, reinforcements led by Colonel Willcocks were mobilizing to continue the mission towards Coomassie. Additional supplies were sent to Kwisa to sustain our forces.

The following day, the troops embarked on a challenging and rainy march to the little village of Amoaful, where Sir Garnet Wolseley had won a crucial battle. The soldiers explored remnants of the past fight while signal guns alerted the enemy of our approach. After a three-day respite, the column continued towards Esumeja. A clever strategy to deceive the enemy at Kokofu was successful, reducing resistance along the main road. Reinforcements were dispatched by the Ashanti army due to the ruse. The force, now at full strength, faced grueling conditions with ceaseless rain and swampy terrain. Despite the hardships, the soldiers persevered, even carrying the loads of fallen carriers.

Colonel Willcocks, leading the troops, faced fierce resistance at a fetish stronghold. The plan was to fortify a spot before attacking the stockades. However, upon arrival, the fetish town was deserted, and the original plan had to be altered due to nightfall. The Ashantis had entrenched positions on rising ground, firing high. The battle began with heavy fire from the bush. The enemy had a stockade protecting them until they reached the main stockade. After an hour and a half of intense fighting, a strange silence fell.

The main companies advanced and aligned themselves, with some moving to the front and others to the rear flank. The charge began with a rousing cheer, propelling the advance guard into the dense bush. The thick vegetation slowed their progress, forcing them to cut through with knives while maintaining their war song. As they broke through the undergrowth and over the stockade, the enemy fled in fear. With daylight fading, the troops were called back. Colonel Willcocks led them down the broad road towards Coomassie, the sight filling them with joy. Despite the eerie silence, they marched steadily, anxious yet hopeful. The distant bugle signaled their arrival, met with cheers and the gate opening to welcome them.

The fort was too small to house even a fraction of the people seeking refuge. Troops were called from the barracks to encircle the fleeing individuals. A rope ladder was the only way in, allowing one person at a time to enter and preventing a chaotic rush. Huts were set up around the walls to shield the refugees from the harsh weather. Days and nights were filled with fear and interrupted sleep due to rebel occupation of nearby buildings. When a fierce attack was launched, Captain Marshall and his troops bravely defended, causing heavy losses to the enemy. Despite dwindling supplies, a daring plan was devised for some to escape while a small group remained.

The soldiers faced challenges on their journey to Coomassie. Captain Marshall was wounded, and many fell from exhaustion. Carriers abandoned their loads, struggling to keep up. After a grueling march, they reached Terrabum, where they rested briefly. Despite losses, they pressed on, crossing swollen rivers, and finally arrived at the coast, starved and exhausted. Meanwhile, at the fort, Captain Bishop and his men faced attacks but held their ground. Sickness spread, with some succumbing to smallpox. Desperation grew as supplies dwindled, leading to high prices for basic goods. Eventually, with most troops buried and the rest weakened, they resorted to foraging. The three white officers vowed not to be captured alive, facing grim circumstances with courage.|['1.

On the 14th of July, reports came in about hearing gunfire. The news seemed unbelievable until an old native officer confirmed distant shots. It wasn't until the next day at four o'clock that a continuous roar of guns assured them a relief column was near. The three captive officers celebrated with the last of their champagne as a toast to their comrades. Sadly, some troops succumbed to the excitement during the battle. Finally, the Ashantis fled in fear, and buglers signaled the relief's arrival. The garrison welcomed their rescuers, firing star shells to signal success. The satisfaction of their efforts was evident as they occupied the quarters and rested, relieved that Coomassie was secured.|"['1.

"Lisle jokingly remarked, ""I doubt you'll ever grasp that,"" referring to a sensitive topic. He promised not to mention it again to spare Hallett's feelings. Concerned, Lisle believed the rest was harming Hallett, who had been good company. The aftermath of the siege was evident everywhere, with bullet-ridden walls and remnants of the enemy's camps. Troops were dispatched to demolish stockades and burn enemy camps. The intricate defensive strategy of the enemy was unveiled, with entrenchments and stockades forming a fortified circle. The soldiers worked to clean the unsanitary conditions left behind. The fort, with its towers and amenities, was a desirable place to stay, but the troops were soon to depart.

Major Eden led the force left, comprising three officers, a doctor, three British non-commissioned officers, 150 West African Frontier Force men, and some Gold Coast Constabulary gunners. They had 54 days' rations and ample ammunition. The column, with many invalids, wounded, women, and children, camped halfway to Pekki. Villages en route were burned, crops destroyed to deter future opposition. The soldiers enjoyed the task. Arriving at Pekki, the king arranged a market for the hungry force. The group split, Colonel Willcocks heading to Bekwai directly while the others, including the wounded, took two days. They rested at Bekwai, addressing health issues. Preparations began for an attack on Kokofu, a threat to troops. General Moreland led the six companies, later increased to eight, with larger guns. They moved swiftly to surprise the enemy. The Hausa company advanced to breach the stockade without firing, paving the way for the guns.|"[""1.

To their surprise, the area was deserted. The shock was total. It was evident that the foe had no clue about their arrival; the sentries from the fortress had gone to eat in the military camp. The bugle warned them of the impending attack, and thousands of dark figures swiftly advanced towards the fortress. The only option was to charge, and the Hausas charged ahead with fixed bayonets, ignoring the intense gunfire they faced. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the sight of the shining bayonets and the cheers of the Hausas overwhelmed the enemy. The enemy fled after a few shots, with the Hausas in hot pursuit. The pursuit continued until they reached the other end of the town. Half the company was allowed to chase the Ashantis further. The soldiers were thrilled and ran off into the night. After a while, they were called back, and the company marched back to the town center. The main force had also returned. The town was systematically destroyed, and over two hundred guns were burned. The soldiers were jubilant as the Ashantis had suffered two major defeats.|"['1.

Hallett expressed relief that the tinned beef would last a while, as it was hard to eat when exhausted. He suggested writing to the P.M.O. for more medical supplies. Despite some grumbling, Hallett was commended for his resilience. The news of victory at Kokofu spread quickly, and Denkeras joined the native levies for a punitive campaign. Captain Wright oversaw crop destruction in the Adansi country, while Akim levies flanked under other commanders. Convoys resupplied the route, still needing escorts north of Fumsu. Troops foraged in villages, returning with supplies. A flying column led by Major Beddoes, after facing challenges, captured an enemy camp with the help of a prisoner guide.

As the troops moved forward, they faced a fierce attack from all directions. The enemy even tried to seize the seven-pounder cannon, but the West Indian Rifles bravely defended it with heavy gunfire. Lieutenants Phillips and Swabey were badly injured, while two other officers sustained minor wounds. The Adansis fought desperately to protect their camp until dusk, aiming to cover the retreat of their families and belongings. Meanwhile, sickness spread in Bekwai, and the death toll rose. The situation remained tense as Major Melliss prepared to defend Pekki from an impending attack. Despite challenges along the way, the troops arrived safely and were warmly welcomed by the villagers.

Their strategy was soon uncovered, and to counter it, a cannon loaded with shot was placed in their path. Infantry readied to fire in controlled bursts, and a Maxim gun was set for rapid fire. Soon, the enemy rushed to the next hiding spot, but the big gun and troops fired accurately, causing chaos as the enemy fled. The assaults stopped, and the group continued, pleased to have outsmarted the Ashantis. Upon reaching the fort at six in the evening, they found the garrison had faced snipers but no major attacks. Plans were made to tackle four remaining stockades. Two columns, each with 300 soldiers, were to attack two each. The start was at ten, and initially, all seemed calm. However, upon reaching the village of Bantama, the enemy emerged. A stockade was spotted, and a fierce battle ensued, with the Maxim gun proving vital.

The Ashantis, unafraid of the bayonets, fiercely fought back through their loopholes. The attackers breached the stockade, and amidst a brutal hand-to-hand combat, the outnumbered enemy eventually fled. The victors pursued but were called back to burn a nearby village. The war camp was destroyed, and the troops moved to Bantama, a sacred village with a history of human sacrifices, which was also razed. Major Cobbe's column faced heavy resistance, but eventually prevailed after sustaining casualties. The troops faced challenges due to thick grass and slow progress. Another group engaged a stockade, facing heavy fire until a successful flanking maneuver led to the enemy's retreat. The losses were significant, with casualties among white officers and Sikhs.

The plan to assault the stockades faced challenges: either attack and return through Pekki or leave and go back on the main road. Neither option was ideal as both left half the mission incomplete. A risky night attack was proposed, using only bayonets to avoid detection. With the moon rising early, the assault was planned for eight o'clock. Despite the superstitious nature of the black troops, it was decided to proceed. Captain Loch scouted the enemy's position successfully. The attack was scheduled for the next day, with only five hundred men chosen to proceed. The troops were instructed to maintain silence and use bayonets only.

Lisle and Hallett were relieved when the troops returned after ten days without much fighting. They discovered the area around the lake was densely populated, but many villages had been destroyed and sacred trees cut down by the enemy. The enemy's morale seemed low, indicating the end was near. Lisle and Hallett were grateful for their comfortable stay in a hut, unlike the troops who had to sleep in the open.

Ah! I can have breakfast with coffee or cocoa. Next time I march, I'll bring cocoa in my box. I've often wanted a cup when we start at three in the morning. I've wondered why I didn't bring some. I hope I won't have to go through this again. I'd volunteer anywhere but Western Africa. Troops at the Cape have it easier. They go days without rain. They even get jam with their rations daily. I've missed jam since I was a boy. I look forward to having jam on fresh bread when I return. It's a great comfort that we face slugs in battle, not rifle bullets. It's hard to guard the roads for months. They get regular rations and get fat. I'd buy a ground sheet, a tent, a mackintosh, and stock up on tea and chocolate if I had to do it over again.|['1.

Before embarking on the final advance, preparations were made for the campaign in Western Africa during the wet season. The lack of essential items like mackintoshes and ground sheets was noted, prompting a suggestion to the War Office for better provision. Lieutenant John Hallett humorously added cocoa and tea to the list of necessities. The successful Central African Regiment returned with spoils of war, including valuable loot and captured enemy correspondence. Major Cramer's levies were dispatched to address locust issues, while Colonel Wilson was tasked with reorganizing forces in Accra. With the Adansi and Kokofu regions secured, the focus shifted to clearing Northern Ashanti. The stage was set for the final push, leaving behind the conquered territories and preparing for the advance towards the Ashanti capital.|"[""1.

The decision was made to relocate the headquarters staff and the advance base to Coomassie, with Esumeja chosen as the point between it and Kwisa to be held with a strong force. The plan involved sending all supplies, carriers, and troops via Pekki to minimize the risk of attack. Simultaneously, a fighting column with minimal transport would advance through Kokofu to capture Ejesu, the queen mother's residence and the remaining Ashanti army's headquarters. Colonel Brake, the most recent arrival, was chosen to lead the operation. The troops were in high spirits upon learning that Bekwai would be abandoned due to its unsanitary conditions and ongoing smallpox epidemic. The forces faced challenges due to heavy rains and poor road conditions, but they pressed on towards Coomassie for what was anticipated to be the final battle of the year.|['1.

"""We find ourselves in a tricky situation,"" Lisle remarked. ""If we stay put till night, we risk being discovered by the enemy. Our best bet is to wait until darkness falls, then quietly make our way back to the path and head in the opposite direction. It's a gamble whether we'll encounter the enemy or not, but we must be prepared to fight to the end if we do. We can't afford to be captured alive.""

As night descended, they cautiously emerged from their hiding spot, wary of the nearby natives. Navigating through the dense foliage, they eventually reached a junction where two paths diverged. Unknowingly, they chose the left path and trudged on for hours before resting.

Upon waking at daybreak, Lisle realized their error. They had veered off course and needed to find food. Despite the risks, they opted to press forward, stumbling upon another path that might lead them to safety."|"['1.

Two exhausted officers, Lisle and Hallett, found themselves near an Ashanti village after a long walk through the dense forest. They cautiously observed the village activities before moving forward. As darkness fell, they stealthily gathered bananas for a meal. Deciding to explore a different path, they encountered enemy forces, engaging in a fierce battle. Despite injuries, they managed to defeat the attackers. Continuing their journey, they stumbled upon looted baggage, with Lisle suspecting they were close to Coomassie.

Bullen and Lisle devised a plan to end the war peacefully. They decided to create a flag of truce using a sapling and a sheet. With renewed hope, they approached the Ashanti village. The villagers initially reached for their weapons but calmed down upon seeing the officers were unarmed. Chiefs from the village came forward to listen to the message from the governor of Coomassie. The officers conveyed that further resistance would bring ruin and offered a peaceful surrender with a small fine. The chiefs expressed their desire for peace as their men were tired of fighting. Lisle guaranteed their safety and hoped for a future of peace and cooperation between the two sides. The chiefs agreed to return with the officers to the fort, ending the conflict.|"['1.

Lisle and Hallett were optimistic about their reception, hoping they would be treated well under a flag of truce. Two women arrived with a meal of chicken, rice, water, and spirits, which was eaten in silence. After the satisfying meal, Hallett expressed gratitude, feeling at peace. They assured the chiefs of fair treatment and offered honorable terms. The group, including the chiefs and armed followers, set out towards the camp. Despite initial challenges, they were allowed to pass thanks to Lisle's intervention. The chiefs were pleased with the reception and agreed to end the war, accepting the governor's terms.

Hallett played a crucial role in their success, according to the colonel. The two men were surrounded by cheering locals who were thrilled to hear their stories. The men showed their appreciation by shaking hands and even performed a war dance. After resting in a shelter, they ate and agreed to return to duty soon. The colonel praised their bravery and mentioned he would commend them in his reports. The natives, led by their chiefs, surrendered their arms peacefully, avoiding further conflict. However, not all chiefs were as cooperative, leading to trials and punishments to deter future violence. The campaign had its tragedies, like Captain Benson's death due to the cowardice of the native levies. The disciplined British troops were contrasted with the undisciplined levies, highlighting the challenges faced in the region.|"['1.

A group of soldiers rushed to help Captain Willcox but returned without reaching him as he had moved further east. They found no enemies but learned that the southern area was peaceful. The location of Captain Benson's battle was chaotic with dead bodies and discarded weapons. The white men took shelter with volunteers but had to retreat due to low ammunition, resulting in Captain Benson's injury. Another team arrived after five days, finding deserted villages and headless skeletons. To the north, Ashanti rebels regrouped for a fight. The garrison demonstrated firing heavy guns, impressing local leaders. Lisle noticed swelling around his neck, suspecting mumps. His friends suggested remedies and advised consulting a doctor due to sudden weather changes.|"['1.

The next day, the swelling had lessened, and two days later, they left the hospital. They were thrilled to learn that a new column was forming, including their companies. The column, almost a thousand strong, set out towards the northwestern region with supplies for twenty-eight days. The enemy, led by Kofia, refused to surrender and planned to target officers first. A skirmish ensued 25 miles from Coomassie, with the enemy resorting to sniping. Despite initial losses, the West African Field Force charged forward, pushing the enemy back. Captain Stevenson, chosen by a coin toss to join the force, tragically lost his life in the battle. After some negotiation, the enemy surrendered, only to regroup with reinforcements.

Nine miles were covered without any resistance. A small Adansi outpost retreated upon their approach. The commandant chose to stop for the night at an abandoned village, destroyed by rebels. The troops had to sleep in the open under heavy rain. The Europeans sought rest in makeshift shelters, but strong winds blew them away. The following day, the troops marched in drenched clothes under the rain. Suddenly, a fierce fire erupted. The advance guard engaged the enemy, who fiercely defended their position. Reinforcements were called, and eventually, the enemy was forced to retreat. The main column, led by Major Melliss and Sikhs, faced the enemy. Melliss was wounded but saved by a fellow officer. The enemy fled as heavy fire was directed at them. The village was taken, and many enemy casualties were found. The victory was achieved with minimal losses.|['1.

The return journey the following day was more challenging. Parts of the tracks were submerged under two to three feet of water. Fortunately, the bridge, though underwater, stood firm, allowing the troops to cross without difficulty. Upon reaching camp that evening, the soldiers had completed their mission without facing any opposition. The exhausted troops urgently needed a long break after months of continuous service. The number of sick soldiers sent to the coast daily was increasing, with a long list of those falling ill. The lack of fresh supplies was keenly felt, and the large troop gatherings not only caused discomfort but also led to various diseases, including smallpox. Colonel Willcocks decided to issue a proclamation promising to spare the lives of surrendering rebels, resulting in many enemies surrendering.

The railway to Coomassie has made it easier to send troops quickly from the coast to the heart of the country. Companies mining gold will help keep peace as the miners will be well armed.

Captain Bullen was deeply saddened by the news of Colonel Houghton's fatal accident. Despite the severity of his injuries, the colonel found solace in the fact that he had no close relatives to mourn his passing. As Lisle, the colonel's adopted son, took charge of the funeral arrangements, he was surprised to learn that he was the sole heir to the colonel's substantial fortune of nearly sixteen thousand pounds. Overwhelmed by the unexpected inheritance, Lisle expressed his gratitude but also felt conflicted, as he had been content with the allowance the colonel had provided him over the years. With the guidance of his friend Hallett, Lisle contemplated his future, including the possibility of leaving the army and pursuing a life with Miss Merton, whom he held affections for.
