"""I have to say, you're all so cheerful--not!"" Jennie exclaimed. ""Ruth is like a strict grandmother, and the rest of you aren't much better. I refuse to think of my dear Henri as cannon fodder. No way! By the time he and Tom get involved in that awful business again, the war might be over. Have you read the reports in the newspapers about our boys? They're really pushing the enemy back."" Jennie was the life of the party, trying to lift everyone's spirits. Helen and Ruth, who had recently said goodbye to Tom Cameron, weren't in the mood for banter. Even Jennie's jokes seemed more like a performance out of obligation. The road trip in the car was an effort by the friends to cheer each other up. At the Cameron's home, things were too distressing since Tom had returned to France. Helen mentioned how Ruth was on edge at the Red Mill, where Aunt Alvirah and Jabez Potter weren't exactly cheerful company. The friends had brought Jennie Stone along after returning from New York bidding farewell to Tom and Henri Marchand.

Dakota Joe's show was a hit, drawing crowds from various towns. The afternoon performance was a spectacle of cowboys, Indians, and daring acts. Among the audience were four girls from Cheslow, eagerly awaiting Wonota's rifle shooting act. Despite Dakota Joe's unpleasant behavior towards Wonota, she remained composed. When Dakota Joe's actions startled her pony, Wonota skillfully regained control. Confronting Dakota Joe with her rifle, she displayed remarkable calmness. Though her words were in Osage, her actions spoke volumes. Ignoring Dakota Joe's interference, Wonota proceeded with her act, showcasing her incredible marksmanship skills. The crowd watched in awe as she expertly hit her targets, proving her prowess as a sharpshooter. Dakota Joe's attempt to disrupt her act failed, and Wonota's talent shone through.|"[""1.

The moving targets were broken by Wonota quickly, as the man swiftly set them swinging. He then tossed glass balls filled with feathers into the air for the Indian girl to shoot. However, Wonota was not performing as well as usual due to her nervous pony, agitated by Dakota Joe's whip. The tension between Wonota and the show's owner affected the target man, making him erratic. When a ball was thrown dangerously close to the audience, Wonota refused to shoot, aiming instead at Dakota Joe. This unexpected act shattered a ball in his hand, causing him to retreat. The audience cheered, thinking it was part of the show, but Ruth and her friends sensed the real animosity between Wonota and Dakota Joe.

Silas Bassett had a good idea, but it wasn't written down. Trains used to stop for him when he needed a ride to town, but that changed when the railroad switched owners. Aunt Alvirah Boggs shared a story about Silas encountering Indians on a journey. The Indians, with feathers and guns, startled the travelers but only sought a doctor for a sick child. A white doctor in the group helped the child, and the Indians joined the travelers peacefully. Ruth worked on a plot before Mr. Hammond arranged for Princess Wonota to leave Dakota Joe's Wild West Show for a film company.

Ruth and her friends traveled to a far-off town to watch the Indian girl perform in the Wild West Show. They saw Wonota during the break between shows and had dinner with her.

The next day, Mr. Hammond faced obstacles in getting Wonota to join their show. Ruth, Helen, and Jennie later witnessed a dramatic chase involving Wonota in her traditional attire.

Wonota was far ahead of the Westerner, riding her horse with remarkable speed and grace. She guided the horse with her voice instead of using a harsh whip. The determined pony responded well, although it was evident that it had traveled a long way to reach the old mill farmhouse, thirty miles from the Wild West Show. Ruth, not waiting for Wonota's report, hurried towards the house, while Sarah called for help from Ben, the hired man. As Dakota Joe approached in anger, Ben swiftly intervened, disarming and unseating him. Dakota Joe ranted about the show being ruined by Hammond and the girl, but the old miller stood up for Wonota.

Ruth, Helen, and Jennie met some riders who had worked on Ruth's previous Western movie with Mr. Hammond. The cowboys were eager to entertain the girls from the East. The next day, Helen and Jennie were pampered by the cowboys for the movie scenes, while Ruth worked with Mr. Hammond and the film crew. The group set off for the Hubbell Ranch, known for its horses and mules. The ranch was chosen for the movie due to its abundance of half-broken horses and mules.

Mr. Hammond returned to the railroad after overseeing the prologue scenes at Benbow Camp. He had other tasks to handle beyond the film production. The script called for a river scene with an Indian maiden in a canoe. Jim Hooley's team created the effect of disturbed water and debris in the river. The loggers from Benbow Company assisted by creating a log boom across the river to control the water flow. The plan was to release the boom, simulating a rush of water for the scene with the Indian maiden. Safety measures were in place with two canoes on standby and crew members along the shore. Ruth joined Mr. Hooley to brief the loggers, including an unexpected encounter with Dakota Joe Fenbrook, who expressed his grudge against Ruth for taking the Indian girl.

"""I could never love him,"" confidently stated the Indian girl. ""He is too silly. Even when we are about to engage in one of the most thrilling scenes, he looks first in the handglass to see if his hair is parted right.""
""It is not a manly task,"" said Wonota, disgusted. ""And the Indian man who is the villain--Tut! He is only half Indian. And he tries to look both as though he admired me and hated the white man. It makes his eyes go this way!"" and Wonota crossed her eyes until Ruth had to cry out.
""But,"" Jennie interjected, ""Wonota is only a single generation removed from arrant savagery. She calls a spade a spade. You shouldn't blame her. It is civilization--which is after all a sort of make-believe--that causes us white folk to refer to a spade as an agricultural implement.""
Mr. Hammond naturally focused on the commercial aspect of Wonota's improvement. Ruth, on the other hand, aimed to guide the Osage maid towards something more meaningful than just money.
Wonota responded positively to Ruth's guidance. She had a natural refinement. The Indian is not inherently coarse and crude but merely different from the whites. Wonota seemed to choose the better things available to her when given the opportunity--the superior customs of the whites rather than the rougher ones.
