After carefully arranging the East Indian article in its designated spot, the room exuded a sense of belonging that seemed to have lasted for decades. The parlor was secured once more, the hallway mat tidied, and the front door locked. Meanwhile, Miss Winn requested a hammer and chisel to open a box. In the sitting room, Cynthia felt the chill linger, prompting her to consider lighting a fire. Eunice, on the other hand, was engrossed in knotting fringe for a bedspread, captivating the young observer. The child was taken aback to discover that a nine-year-old had no knowledge of sewing, never having hemmed ruffles, done overseam, or knitted. The child, eager to share her knowledge, spoke of Greek heroes like Alexander the Great and philosophers from China and India. She also recounted a touching story of a mother's sacrifice at an Indian temple, shedding light on her own inner turmoil and longing for her father.

I don't believe in spoiling children. I'm not a fan of the woman. Do we need to keep her around? A nine-year-old can start taking care of herself, managing her clothes and room. Those eyes of hers are quite expressive. She doesn't have a Leverett mouth, and her full lips are bold and cheeky. Letty Orne was quite pretty. It's odd that this child was born in this house. She won't be exceptionally beautiful, that's for sure. Eunice, look at the time! Let's not waste it. I'm exhausted. The fish was prepared deliciously. Eunice moved gracefully, making no noise with the dishes. The table looked inviting with tea, bread, gingerbread, cake, fruit, and preserves. Chilian and the guests arrived. Elizabeth checked the rooms, wanting to ensure she could trust the newcomers. The beds were tidy, but the closets and drawers were messy.

Elizabeth found herself in a puzzling situation, feeling disoriented and suffocated. She heard birds singing and laughter, which brought some clarity.

Despite initial hesitations, Chilian acknowledged the generous provisions made for the child and the changes it would bring to their quiet life. Elizabeth struggled with the idea of accepting this new responsibility, considering how to impart important values to the child.

Chilian kissed his mother's soft red lips before leaving. In New England, affection was scarce, especially among those with few family connections. The market was bustling that morning, adorned with evergreen branches and sawdust. Stalls displayed vegetables, meats, and household items like iron holders and crockery. Customers bartered with vendors, measuring goods and haggling over prices. Miss Elizabeth praised Boston but considered it on par with Salem due to the East India trade. Cynthia explored the garret, discovering old family heirlooms like a mahogany cradle. She marveled at the history behind each item, including iron fire-dogs and tarnished kitchenware.

As the evening approached, Cynthia gazed out of the windows in the four gables, standing on a box to see the South River, the Neck, and the bustling shipping activities. The sky was overcast, hinting at a storm brewing. She observed the North River winding its way and the vast ocean she had crossed. Old St. Peter's Church stood tall, a landmark in the distance. Reflecting on her past, Cynthia shared stories of hardships during the war, losses of loved ones, and the kindness of Cousin Chilian.

Elizabeth observed the child closely, sticking to her belief that kids should sleep early, not linger on laps. A struggle ensued when she tried to wake them. She stood firm, hoping for a peaceful outcome, relieved that Chilian was present. Elizabeth didn't approve of children leaving quietly; she preferred them to resist. Chilian, hoping for no drama, lifted his book. The child, raised with strict Puritan values, bid good night sleepily, linking arms with Rachel. Elizabeth disapproved of children staying up late, neglecting prayers. She straightened the room as Eunice rolled up her work. The child begged to sleep together due to fear of the big, lonely bed. Elizabeth would have disapproved of the child seeking comfort. The storm raged outside, shaking trees and lashing the ocean.

During the early days in New England, no one foresaw the bustling mills that would soon produce cotton cloths and calicoes. These fabrics were once imported and expensive. People dyed plain colors for their dresses, and some wove ginghams on hand looms. Eunice pondered the purpose of the treasures stored in the attic, wondering why they were accumulating so much.

"""Oh no,"" she said with a slight smile. In the old days, boys were under their fathers' authority until they turned twenty-one.

The ships' cannon were being prepared for protection. Maybe Cousin Chilian will show you the bridge one day and share all the details.

Spring had finally arrived on the New England coast after a long and bleak winter. The willows bloomed with silver catkins, the lilacs showed purple buds, and the elms and maples blossomed. The grass sparkled in the morning sun, attracting bees to its sweet tassels. Snowdrops, crocuses, and other flowers dotted the landscape. As the warm air rushed into the room, the man and the girl prepared to continue their Latin lesson. The man praised the girl's efforts and mentioned the Upham children, who would soon join her for play. The arrival of spring brought a sense of renewal and joy to the surroundings, signaling the end of the cold season.|['1.

In Salem, signs of spring were everywhere. The town was bustling with activity as people cleaned their homes. Windows were washed, carpets beaten, and blankets aired out. Women tended to gardens, men worked on vegetable patches, and fences were painted. Despite the weariness, everyone was busy preparing for the new season. Cynthia, who had recently arrived at the _Flying Star_, visited the place often. The storm had caused some damage to the ships, and boys were collecting driftwood. The local newspaper reported sad news of people lost at sea, but Captain Corwin remained optimistic. Mrs. Upham suggested sending Cynthia to school with her daughter Betty, emphasizing the importance of learning practical skills like sewing. Mrs. Upham admired Miss Eunice's needlework and hoped Polly would learn the craft too. Betty tried to befriend Cynthia, but the new girl seemed hesitant and turned to Miss Eunice for comfort.|['1.

Miss Winn was contemplating sending the young girl to school. She felt uneasy about Chilian's interest in teaching her Latin, preferring the multiplication table instead. Despite managing the household well, Miss Winn noticed the child's foreign-looking clothes and peculiar knowledge gaps. She was skillful and delicate, showing interest in books and geography. Chilian, on the other hand, found her irreverent and felt she needed to start school soon. The child's behavior was a mix of compliance and independence, leaving Chilian puzzled. While he believed in the influence of temperament, he realized the impact of environment on behavior. Despite the child's puzzling nature, she was not a troublesome presence in the household.|"['1.

"Elizabeth had one more point to make. She inspected her collection of fabric pieces. Among them were yards of brown and white gingham, sufficient for a simple dress without any extra decorations. Holding the fabric, she gently knocked on the half-open door. Inside, Rachel had laid out a few plain white dresses on the bed, suitable even for the modest style of Salem. ""Cynthia starts school on Monday,"" Elizabeth announced. ""I think this gingham would be perfect for her school dress. It's easy to keep clean. Children here dress differently, and you'll get used to it."" Rachel examined the gingham thoughtfully. ""I don't think it suits her,"" she said softly. ""Her father always preferred to see her in white. It looks fresh every time it's washed. These colors fade and look worn out. Besides, she'll outgrow these dresses soon."" Rachel Winn replied calmly, ""I've been thinking about that. I wear white often myself. I found a laundry service on Front Street where they do a good job at a fair price.

"Elizabeth Leverett had a firm opinion about children's upbringing and was wary of boarding arrangements despite having ample resources. She had a strong influence on the children she cared for, much like Charles Lamb's ""Children of Alice."" Although Elizabeth had married twice without love, she held traditional views on child-rearing. She interviewed Dame Wilby, an elderly woman who ran a small school that catered to the neighborhood's children.

"""Yes,"" she replied to Miss Winn's explanation. ""Miss Leverett was talking about her. I was teaching school here when she was born, and then the captain took her away to the Ingies again."" Most people said it that way. ""Rather delicate little thing--I suppose it was the climate over there. They say it turns the skin yellow. Let's see how you read, sissy?""

No. Did she know her multiplication tables? No. The capital of the state? She knew that. When did the war start? When was peace declared? ""You'll sit on that bench,"" the teacher said, ringing the bell as the other children entered, staring at her. Cynthia felt uncomfortable under their gaze. The attention bothered her. She was then given a worn-out spelling book to study a column. Another class read an easy lesson about a dog that captured her interest, causing her to forget her own task. While the older children worked on math problems, one by one, the younger students came up to the desk to spell words from a book. Attention wavered, and the teacher reprimanded those who lost focus.

"Miss Elizabeth was bustling around, rushing to finish the chores. The weather was changing, and the clothes had dried too quickly in the hot sun. She preferred them to bleach on the line like the grass. Miss Drake had to leave for the Appletons due to sickness, leaving everything in disarray.

Complaining about the ironing, Miss Elizabeth mentioned she never ironed the four blankets but shook and folded them, letting them rest overnight before hanging them in the garret. The main task was quite extensive, hoping the wind would blow out the wrinkles.

In the warm afternoon, two boys misbehaved and were punished, resulting in loud protests. Meanwhile, Cynthia struggled with her math, slowly grasping the concept of adding numbers.

She couldn't recall where she left her book. Dame Wilby had instructed her to take it home for studying. Eventually, she remembered placing it just inside the gate under a clump of ribbon grass. Despite Cousin Elizabeth spotting it, the book was safe. Mastering the spelling was easy, but the unusual words posed a challenge. They then moved on to practicing tables and figures. As she often printed instead of writing, her school position was peculiar. An incident with a mischievous boy behind her led to her being kept in for saucy remarks.

Rachel had a different upbringing compared to Cynthia. She was taken care of by a wealthy lady in Scotland who had servants for everything. At the age of ten, she was sent to a school where she learned a lot, but she still had gaps in her knowledge.

Eunice finished her beautiful basket quilt, a true work of art. She spent her mornings and evenings in the flower garden, sometimes joined by Cynthia, though she wasn't a gardening expert. Evenings were spent on the porch, sometimes visited by neighbors, or Eunice would walk to South River under the moonlight. In July, they gathered wild green grapes for preserves, with Cynthia finding it fun until she grew tired. Front Street, once the old river path, was now transforming into Wharf Street with docks. The town buzzed with activity, preserving fruits for winter, pickling, and house-cleaning. The quilt was carefully stored away. Cynthia made friends with the Upham children, enjoying games like tag and blind-man's buff. She admired Polly's needlework for a white frock and sampler with intricate designs.|"['1.

They met Cousin Chilian, who was engrossed in a chess game. Bentley bid goodnight, inviting the little girl for another visit. The weather turned cool, painting the world with colorful leaves and ripe fruit scents. They explored unique spots on walks. Bentley joined, impressed by the girl's knowledge of distant lands. Bentley lamented Polly's busyness with lacework and studies, contrasting it with the girl's love for learning. They stumbled upon ancient houses with a history rooted in the Indian name Naumkeag, later renamed by Reverend Higginson.

Religion is often associated with goodness and pleasantness, but not everyone who is religious is kind. Cousin Elizabeth, who was very religious, could be unpleasant. However, Cousin Chilian, who rarely scolded anyone, was also religious but in a different way. He never talked about religion but went to church. The narrator, a little girl, studied the Catechism but had trouble understanding it. She believed that being good meant following the Golden Rule, loving God, and treating others kindly. She admired Roger Williams for founding a city where different religious groups could live together peacefully. The little girl's father was away at sea, and she believed he would return someday. She found solace in the bustling wharves, watching the ships set sail, and sending messages with them.|"[""1.

Cousin Giles visited and spent two days in the warehouse, where they had not taken her. She helped Cousin Eunice cut stems of garden herbs for drying and perfumery. Lavender, sweet marjoram, and sweet clover scented the house. Cynthia preferred these scents to sandalwood and Oriental perfumes. Autumn storms arrived, anchoring vessels securely at the docks. Fires warmed the chilly house. Nearby, an East Indiaman wrecked, with fragments floating around. Lives were lost, unsettling the little girl. Cousin Giles, a strong man with white hair and penetrating eyes, made little progress with her. Chilian Leverett, cautious of the girl, hoped the fortune had been left differently. The East India Marine Society, filled with curiosities, had a wider mission.

In the winter, Cynthia disliked the cold, despite the warm fires indoors. Chilian defied Elizabeth's wishes and installed a stove in the hall, allowing large logs to smolder all night. This was a new and extravagant addition, as wood was plentiful back then. People believed sleeping in warm rooms was unhealthy, yet they shut themselves in without fresh air. Snow arrived, bringing joy to the inland towns with sledding and snowball fights. Despite catching a cold, the little girl was indulged by her guardian, much to Elizabeth's annoyance. She wasn't seriously ill, just pale and thin, with large wistful eyes. Chilian made her comfortable in a rocking chair while Bentley and Polly visited, sharing stories from school and games they played.|"[""1.

As a child in England, we used to dance on the green for fun. Everyone participated, even during special occasions like Christmas and weddings. The ladies would dress in fancy silks and satins and dance with the butler and footmen, while the lord would dance with the maids. Cynthia wondered if she could have a party like the Perkinses did when they moved into their new house—a house-warming party. She eagerly listened to Polly's description of a party. Polly demonstrated some dance steps that fascinated Cynthia. She longed to grow up quickly to experience dancing and being part of society. School seemed dull compared to the excitement of dancing and dreams of keeping company and getting married.|"['1.

The next was his day in Boston. But late in the afternoon, after Miss Eunice had been visiting her an hour or so, she went to the study and sat by the window, where she could see him come. He glanced up and she waved her hand daintily. All day he had been wondering how he should find her.

"It's a pity for one young girl to have all that money. There should have been three or four children. Fifty years ago, the Leveretts had such large families they seemed likely to overrun the earth, but now they've dwindled down to almost nothing. Cynthia Leverett was showing great improvement in every way. She was no longer the thin, pale girl who had arrived from India. She had outgrown her clothes, a positive sign, according to Eunice. ""There's that gray fabric of mine that's too nice for everyday wear. I could have it dyed, but I already have two nice black dresses in addition to my silk one. I've often wished I had the money it cost, invested. And the fabric..."" Eunice was surprised at her own complaints. She had always dressed Cynthia beautifully. She noticed more attention being paid to children's clothing in church on Sundays, and after indulging in such sinful thoughts, she read the chapter in Isaiah where the prophet condemned the excessive adornments and predicted severe punishments for them.

Money was not the main focus, although it was valued. It was often reserved for men, as fathers believed their daughters would marry well and inherit less. Chilian Leverett, unlikely to marry, might inherit the undivided fortune. The house was dimly lit, even on special occasions. Cynthia led the girls upstairs to change. They wore elaborate hats and muslin dresses with long sleeves to protect their skin. Skirts were simple, stockings matched slippers, and necklines were square with lace. Cynthia wore a blue silk dress and slippers. Many girls wore coral necklaces and styled their hair with bows or combs. The room was filled with heirloom clothes that perfumed the air. Cynthia's room had her mother's belongings, and she preferred simple muslin dresses over silk.|['1.

In the old house, Miss Winn showed the children a room filled with ancient treasures. Among them were items from Cousin Chilian's ancestors, like a clock from 1640. The children marveled at the old furniture and quilts, noting how they never get upset like people sometimes do. After a delightful supper, they played games in the front parlor. Mr. Leverett entertained them with word games from his youth. Despite the fun, it was agreed that Cynthia was a bit spoiled. The children also explored the bay of Fundy, interacting with locals.

When Cynthia and her companion traveled to Boston, she felt a deep sense of loneliness. She had been enjoying the silent admiration she received, evident in the way he looked at her with reverence and a hint of fear, and how his cheeks flushed when she met his gaze. This new form of worship intrigued her. Visiting the Uphams, she admired Polly's beautifully framed sampler with an acorn border and a tree motif resembling those from Noah's Ark. Polly shared that her father had gifted her the frame and glass in exchange for shirts she made for him. Cynthia also learned about Gitty Sprague's elegant pelisse made of gray watered silk. The conversation shifted to a young cousin named Anthony, whom Polly found pleasing, unlike another relative named Leverett. However, Cynthia's attention was soon captured by the return of Captain Corwin, an old sailor who had a significant impact on her life. His arrival sparked her curiosity and made her consider running away, but he reassured her, sharing heartfelt memories of a departed friend who valued her safety.|"['1.

I waited eagerly at first, sometimes wishing I could soar like a bird. Oh, the adventures we could have if we could fly! During a cold winter, I fell ill from waiting. Cousin Chilian brought news from Mother, bringing joy to her. Despite the challenges, I had wonderful times. Cousin Chilian and Cousin Eunice cared deeply for me. Cousin Elizabeth would have too if she had lived longer. I engaged in various activities like studying, traveling, making friends, and painting. Although painting the sea proved challenging, I persevered. Our journey faced a severe storm near Torres Strait, causing damage and loss of crew members. However, we managed to reach the harbor in poor condition. After exploring Hong Kong and engaging in trade, I returned to Salem to captain the _Aurora_. The changes in Salem surprised me, but the pull of home was strong. The journey and dangers felt surreal as we gathered for supper, with Miss Eunice expressing her astonishment.

In the past, old Salem's history of witches and ghosts was fading from memory, becoming mere curiosities.

Cynthia, busy with painting and music, navigated the social scene with grace. Society expected young women to socialize and eventually marry, but with propriety.

The beautiful wedding was a hot topic for days. Miss Leverett received visits from girls, which she found amusing to be called. She was invited to join a sewing group that crafted garments for widows and children of sailors who drowned, a common occurrence on the New England coast. Her compassionate nature was stirred by the heart-wrenching stories she heard. One day, she told her cousin Eunice about a poor sick woman she visited with the committee. The woman, a mother of three, resorted to washing clothes when she was well. Despite receiving driftwood and scraps from ship-yards, and having her rent paid by a company, the family lived in dire conditions. Miss Leverett was moved to help after witnessing the destitution.

Chilian Leverett sat back in his chair, pondering deeply. The child had become precious to him, a gift from her father. A tumultuous pain gripped his soul at the thought of living without her, missing her every day. Loneliness would creep in during the long, winter evenings. Despite her youth and the joys it brought, she deserved love. He decided to let her enjoy a few more carefree years before needing to be cautious.
