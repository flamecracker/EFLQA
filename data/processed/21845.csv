"Peter Mink was quite different from everyone in Pleasant Valley and Blue Mountain. Firstly, he had no home, and secondly, he had an unusually long neck.

Despite his unkempt appearance, young animals like Jimmy Rabbit and Frisky Squirrel enjoyed his company.

The following day, a similar incident occurred. Peter Mink praised the taste of eel, which Fatty Coon disagreed with, preferring green peas.
