The Little Colonel rode her pony down the long avenue from the house to the entrance gate. The pathway was filled with the sweet scent of locusts. Overhead, the giant trees formed a white arch of bloom, while fallen blossoms covered the ground like scattered snowflakes. Everyone in Lloydsboro Valley knew Locust, one of the prettiest places in Kentucky. The great stone house at the end of the avenue was a sight to behold, with its gleaming white pillars peeking through the Virginia creeper. Old Colonel Lloyd, an ex-Confederate soldier, was a familiar sight in the Valley. He was often pointed out to visitors as the grandfather of the Little Colonel, a charming and mischievous young girl. The Little Colonel, dressed in white with a black velvet hat, rode her pony named Tarbaby, adorned with locust blossoms. She planned to visit the post office and then maybe go see her friend Bobby Moore.|"[""1.

As she talked, she rode through the gate to the main road, a wide path with a train track on one side and a horse trail on the other. After a quick ride, she reached another gate leading to Judge Moore's house, Rob's grandfather. Looking in, she hoped to see Rob but found only squirrels playing and a bird chirping. The girl, tall and graceful, with hazel eyes and pink cheeks, turned away. Suddenly, she heard a horse approaching. It was Rob, riding fast on his gray horse. He greeted her warmly, happy to be back in the countryside. They rode together, catching up on their winter activities.

"""I never saw her,"" said Lloyd, ""but I feel as if we had always been old friends. Her mother and mine used to go to school together here in Lloydsboro Valley at the Girls' College, and they've written to each other once a month for fifteen years. Mrs. Ware is a widow now, and they have had tough times, for they are poor, and she has four children younger than Joyce. But Joyce has had lots of things that neither Eugenia nor I have had. Last year her cousin Kate took her abroad with her, and she studied French, and she had lots of beautiful times where they spent the winter in France. Mrs. Ware sent some of the letters to mother that Joyce wrote. One was about a Christmas tree that they gave to thirty little peasant children,--and so many strange things happened behind a gate that they called the 'Gate of the Giant Scissors,' because there was a pair of enormous scissors hanging over it, you know. Oh, it was just like a fairy tale, all the things that Joyce did when she was in Touraine.""

""Why, that's just what mother calls the place,"" cried the Little Colonel, ""the cuckoo's nest! She says that the cuckoo is the most careless bird in the world about the way it builds its nest.

The child had a tiring day, starting early with chores in her small room. She helped with breakfast, churned butter, and finally finished her tasks by ironing towels. After a quick break in her room, she freshened up and headed out to explore. Walking through the orchard and down a leafy lane, she reached a gate where Davy, a quiet boy, joined her. They walked to a wooden church with a graveyard behind it. Inside, a red bookcase caught Betty's attention.

In Betty's attic room, she cherished twelve special books from her godmother, Mrs. Sherman. These books were like windows to a new world for Betty, far from her everyday life. The children weren't allowed to touch them, even Davy had to keep his hands behind his back when looking at the pictures. Betty read these books repeatedly, knowing them by heart. The other books in the meeting-house were less exciting, often with overly moral stories. Betty spent afternoons reading to Davy, who lay outside staring at the sky. Today, as they heard a horse approaching, Betty hoped they wouldn't be seen climbing in through the window, as it might not be respectful to the church people.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Betty cherish in her attic room?\nA) Toys\nB) Special books\nC) Clothes\nD) Paintings\nE) Board games', 'Question 2:\nHow many special books did Betty have from her godmother, Mrs. Sherman?\nA) Five\nB) Ten\nC) Twelve\nD) Fifteen\nE) Twenty', 'Question 3:\nWhy did Betty consider the special books like windows to a new world?\nA) They were magical\nB) They were made of glass\nC) They were written in a foreign language\nD) They showed her different perspectives\nE) They were about space exploration', 'Question 4:\nWho had to keep his hands behind his back when looking at the pictures in the special books?\nA) Betty\nB) Mrs. Sherman\nC) Davy\nD) The church people\nE) The horse', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Betty do with the other books in the meeting-house?\nA) Ignored them\nB) Threw them away\nC) Donated them\nD) Read them repeatedly\nE) Used them as decorations', ""Question 6:\nWhy did Betty hope they wouldn't be seen climbing in through the window as they heard a horse approaching?\nA) She was afraid of horses\nB) She didn't want to disturb the church people\nC) She wanted to surprise the church people\nD) She wanted to play a prank\nE) She wanted to ride the horse""]"|"['B) Special books', 'C) Twelve', 'D) They showed her different perspectives', 'C) Davy', 'D) Read them repeatedly', ""B) She didn't want to disturb the church people""]"
It was late when Jake noticed Davy's yellow hair and called out cheerfully, asking for Betty. Betty, excited, leaned out of the window urging Davy to fetch the letter from Jake. Jake decided to hand it over himself. Betty, filled with joy, recognized her godmother's handwriting on the envelope. She savored the moment, inhaling the faint scent of violets as she opened the letter. Inside was an invitation to a house party at Locust, hosted by Lloyd Sherman. Overwhelmed with happiness, Betty shared her dreams of meeting her godmother, playing with other girls, and traveling on the train for the first time. Davy, noticing a tear on Betty's face, asked why she was crying. Betty explained that the invitation made her feel like she was reuniting with her true family, especially her godmother who was like a mother to her. Excited, they rushed home to share the news with Cousin Hetty.|"[""1.

Betty, a young girl with tousled curls and a shining face, closed her book and knelt briefly at the altar in the meeting-house. She then put on her sunbonnet, climbed out the window, and ran hand in hand with Davy, singing joyfully. The world seemed more beautiful to her that day, with blue skies and golden sunshine. She skipped down the lane, cherishing the moment. Meanwhile, Eugenia, feeling homesick during her vacation, received letters from her friends at boarding school. She longed to return to the school's excitement and the company of her friends. Despite being in a luxurious hotel, she missed the fun and camaraderie she shared with Mollie, Fay, and Kit Keller.

Eugenia gazed around the lavishly decorated room with a dissatisfied breath.

Mr. Forbes, proud of his daughter Eugenia, smiled as they sat in an alcove at a house party.

Betty's departure was a serious moment as she settled into the wagon after her trunk was loaded. The other kids lined up on the porch to see her off. Dressed in her usual dark blue gingham and white sunbonnet, she seemed like an adventurous explorer to them. They had never ventured past Jaynes's Post-office. Betty, who had only been as far as Livermore, felt a mix of excitement and nervousness as the wagon lurched forward, leaving behind familiar sights. The children bid her goodbye noisily, like a chorus of birds. As they passed the church, Betty took a last look at the window where she read to Davy. The graveyard with its white headstones and peaceful atmosphere also bid her farewell. At the station, the approaching train felt daunting, but Davy's presence comforted her.|['1.

In a far-off land, near a castle hidden in a quiet forest, there dwelt a young maiden named Olga. She was an orphan, but not alone, for an elderly woman, who lived in a thatched cottage nearby, had cared for her since she was a baby. This kind old woman, a flax-spinner, had been like a family to Olga, taking the place of parents and siblings. Every day, Olga helped by fetching water, gathering fruits, and tending to the linen. One day, while at the spring, she met the prince of the castle, who was charmed by her grace and beauty. Invited to the castle for a grand event, Olga worried about her humble attire, but the old woman worked a magical charm to create a special gift for her to wear.|"['Question 1: Who cared for Olga since she was a baby?\nA) The prince of the castle\nB) Her parents\nC) An elderly woman\nD) Her siblings\nE) A young maiden', 'Question 2: What was the occupation of the elderly woman who cared for Olga?\nA) Flax-spinner\nB) Castle guard\nC) Baker\nD) Blacksmith\nE) Farmer', 'Question 3: What tasks did Olga help with every day?\nA) Cooking and cleaning\nB) Gardening and sewing\nC) Fetching water, gathering fruits, and tending to the linen\nD) Hunting and fishing\nE) Painting and sculpting', 'Question 4: How did Olga meet the prince of the castle?\nA) At a marketplace\nB) At a ball\nC) At the forest\nD) At the spring\nE) At the cottage', 'Question 5: What did the old woman create for Olga to wear to the grand event at the castle?\nA) A crown\nB) A necklace\nC) A dress\nD) A magical charm\nE) A pair of shoes', ""Question 6: Why did Olga worry about her attire for the grand event at the castle?\nA) She didn't want to go to the castle\nB) She wanted to impress the prince\nC) She didn't like the old woman's gift\nD) She wanted to wear her own clothes\nE) She wanted to wear a crown""]"|['C) An elderly woman', 'A) Flax-spinner', 'C) Fetching water, gathering fruits, and tending to the linen', 'D) At the spring', 'D) A magical charm', 'B) She wanted to impress the prince']

Olga stood at the castle gate, tears streaming down her face, dressed in rags. She had demanded to be adorned in the finest garments, hoping to catch the prince's eye and become his bride. But as she tugged at her necklace in frustration, the beads scattered into the darkness, except for one she clutched tightly. The night wind seemed to whisper a familiar charm, reminding Olga of the old flax-spinner who had shown her kindness. Overwhelmed with regret, Olga realized that only the old charm could bring her true happiness. Reciting the charm, a magical transformation occurred.

This morning, we were in for a delightful surprise! After breakfast, Lloyd arrived at the house on her horse, Tarbaby, with another horse for Eugenia and two ponies for Joyce and me to ride. Eugenia, being an experienced rider from a New York school, got the elegant bay mare, while Joyce and I each got a pony. My pony, Lad, was a lovely brown one, a welcome change from the farm horses I'm used to. As we galloped through the valley, we caught the attention of onlookers, feeling like a circus troupe. Passing by Taylor's grove, we encountered a Butchers' Union picnic with a brass band. Joyce's pony, Calico, surprised us all by dancing to the waltz!

I doubt I could ever truly love Eugenia as she often makes me feel uneasy. Her condescending manner can be quite irritating. Yet, she can be captivating when she chooses to be friendly and engaging. We spent the morning in her room, listening to her stories. Living in one of the world's largest hotels must be amazing, with all the sights she gets to see. She showed us a picture of her three best school friends in a beautiful locket adorned with sapphires. Eugenia seems to hold her friends in higher regard than her own parents. It's interesting how being around her can influence your thoughts and actions. She has already persuaded Lloyd to consider attending her exclusive school in New York. Eugenia believes that some schools claiming to be selective are no better than public schools, which upset Joyce. Despite Eugenia's airs, Joyce surprised her by speaking French, revealing a hidden talent. Joyce explained that mixing languages is considered improper, a fact that Eugenia found astonishing.|"['1.

"""Yes, indeed!"" replied Betty enthusiastically. Eugenia smiled in agreement, having heard Lloyd talk about the MacIntyre boys and eager to meet them.

Doctor Fuller mentioned cases in a nearby gypsy camp. The girls remembered a sick baby they saw at a fortune-teller's tent. Mrs. Sherman decided to call the doctor to check for measles.

One day, Davy tried to catch a fish to cheer up Betty, who was sick. He proudly brought a catfish to her room, but the fishy smell made her feel worse. Davy even fried the fish for her lunch, but Betty couldn't eat it. She had to pretend to save Davy's feelings. Later, she tossed the fish out, but the smell lingered. Despite the kind gesture, Betty felt lonely and miserable in her hot, dark room all day. Meanwhile, her friends were having fun at a house party.

"Betty carefully pulled up the basket, worried the rope might slip, as ""the surprise"" was hefty. As she safely landed it and turned it over, four chubby fox-terrier puppies tumbled out.

I had an old cat named Muff. When my mother went downstairs, I decided to pack Muff away in camphor balls. I put her in a pillowcase with mothballs and tied it tight. Muff mewed and scratched, but I managed to open a chest and put her inside with other furs. Luckily, my mother found an astrakhan cape in the chest later, saving Muff from suffocating. When she opened the lid, the pillowcase startled her. Bridget, our helper, thought the furs were bewitched and called Dennis. He untied the pillowcase, and Muff tumbled out, nearly smothered. I cried because they let her out, fearing moths would ruin her fur. My mother explained that Muff could care for her fur.
