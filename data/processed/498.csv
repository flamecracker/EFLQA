The old stagecoach traveled along the dusty road from Maplewood to Riverboro on a warm day in May. Mr. Jeremiah Cobb, the driver, focused on delivering the mail while the hills rolled by and the horses trotted on. In the coach sat a small, dark-haired passenger in a stiff calico dress, clutching a pink sunshade and a bead purse. Her mother had entrusted her to Mr. Cobb's care, asking him to keep an eye on her during the journey. As the coach rattled along, the little passenger, Rebecca, leaned out of the window, her black braid swaying, playfully trying to poke Mr. Cobb with her sunshade. Despite her mother's instructions to behave, Rebecca's excitement bubbled over as she recounted the adventure of leaving the farm and traveling by various means to her destination.|"['1.

"""Does it cost more to ride up there with you?"" she asked. ""It's slippery and shiny down here, and the stage is too big for me. I rattle round till I'm black and blue. The windows are small, and I've nearly broken my neck trying to see if my mother's trunk fell off. She cherishes it."" Rebecca sat down carefully, smoothing her dress with precision and placing her sunshade between the driver and herself. ""Only two hours,"" she sighed, ""that will be half past one."" She talked about her lunch and the growing day. ""I never put it up when the sun shines; pink fades awfully, you know,"" she said about her sunshade. Mr. Jeremiah Cobb noticed she was different from his usual passengers. He admired her clean, faded calico dress and her unique appearance, especially her eyes that seemed to hold hidden depths.

"""They're precious, but quite a hassle, and expensive to take care of,"" she continued. ""Hannah and I have been responsible for putting the little ones to bed every night and waking them up in the morning for many years. But it's all over now, which is comforting. We'll have a wonderful time when we're all grown up and the mortgage is paid off.""

""No, I mean there won't be any more; our family is complete. Mother says so, and she always keeps her word. There hasn't been a new addition since Mira, who is three now. She was born the same day father passed away. Aunt Miranda wanted Hannah to join her in Riverboro instead of me, but mother couldn't spare her; Hannah is better at household chores than I am. I told mother last night that if there were more babies while I was away, I'd need to be called back. When there's a baby, it requires both Hannah and me, as mother handles the cooking and farm work.""

""Close? It must be thousands of miles away! We traveled from Temperance by train. Then we journeyed a long distance to cousin Ann's and went to bed. Later, we traveled quite a way to Maplewood, where the stagecoach was waiting. Our farm is secluded, but our school and church are in Temperance, just two miles away.

Rebecca was full of dreams and ambitions. She talked about her plans to go to school and then to the seminary at Wareham. She wanted to be a painter, inspired by Miss Ross. Even though her shoes were new and had to last six months, she was determined to learn her lessons. Rebecca also shared her imaginative thoughts about Paris and Milltown.

Mr. Cobb dismissed Milltown as nothing special, yet Rebecca was thrilled by his simple act of tossing a newspaper onto a neighbor's doorstep. Imagining a row of houses to throw papers at, she felt a rush of excitement. As they neared Riverboro, Rebecca's nerves tingled with fear and anticipation. She compared her journey to visiting her Aunt Mirandy's house to venturing into a dark cellar, where there might be ogres or fairies. Mr. Cobb described Riverboro as a quiet village with no bustling main street. Rebecca longed for the grandeur of parades and circuses, recalling the enchanting snake charmer in a red and gold chariot. She shared her admiration for the charmer's beauty, evoking a sense of wonder and awe.|"[""1.

Mr. Cobb felt uneasy, but he diverted attention by suggesting a grand entrance. He proposed driving fast with a whip, the child holding a bouquet and a red parasol. The girl hesitated, wanting to appear genteel. As they approached the Sawyer girls' house, Mrs. Perkins noticed the niece, Rebecca, who seemed different due to her dark complexion. Despite being called the Sawyer girls, Miranda and Jane were spinsters, while Aurelia had a romantic marriage. Her husband, Mr. Randall, was artistic but struggled financially. Though Aurelia's marriage wasn't practical for money, her sisters believed there were worse things than being an old maid. Mr. Randall's mother felt the twins' talents were unevenly distributed, with Lorenzo being talented but lacking practicality like his deceased brother.|"['1.

Rebecca grew up in a household with a mix of ordinary and extraordinary traits. Her parents, Aurelia and Lorenzo de Medici Randall, faced financial struggles, with Lorenzo's investments failing to secure their future. Rebecca's sister, Hannah, was the responsible one, helping her mother manage the household. In contrast, Rebecca was known for her creative and mischievous nature. Despite lacking her sister's patience and her brother's persistence, Rebecca was full of energy and spirit. She amused her family with her antics but was not considered particularly important. Hannah, on the other hand, was dependable and mature for her age, taking on many responsibilities at home. When the aunts, Miranda and Jane, invited Hannah to live with them, Rebecca was also meant to join them, with hopes that the change would positively influence her future.|"['1.

Miranda expressed doubts about her ability to care for a child, feeling uncertain about the arrival of Rebecca, the wild young girl. Despite her reservations, Miranda had prepared for Rebecca's arrival by buying materials for her to sew. Miranda, a diligent and frugal woman, had a practical approach to life, focused on managing the house and farm. In contrast, her sister Jane had experienced deeper emotions due to her fiancé's involvement in the war. Jane's nursing of wounded soldiers transformed her, adding warmth to her otherwise reserved demeanor. As they awaited Rebecca's arrival, Miranda worried about the potential havoc a child could wreak on their home.

Jane felt downcast and fearful due to Miranda's ominous predictions. While Miranda pondered how they would endure Rebecca, Jane wondered how Rebecca would cope with them. In a moment of inspiration, Jane placed flowers and a pincushion on Rebecca's bureau. Rebecca arrived at the house with Mr. Cobb, and Miss Sawyer greeted her sternly. Rebecca was guided to her room, where she felt a mix of emotions. Despite the room being comfortable, the unfamiliar surroundings left her overwhelmed.

Dear Mother, I have safely arrived here. My dress wasn't too wrinkled, and Aunt Jane helped me smooth it out. I really like Mr. Cobb; he chews but tosses newspapers right up to the doors. I sat outside for a bit on the ride over but moved inside before reaching Aunt Miranda's house. I didn't want to, but I thought you'd prefer it that way. Miranda is such a long name, so I might just say Aunt M. and Aunt J. in my Sunday letters. Aunt J. gave me a dictionary to look up all the tough words. It takes a lot of time, and I'm glad people can talk without having to spell. Talking is much easier than writing and a lot more enjoyable. The brick house looks exactly as you described. The parlor is impressive and gives you shivers when you peek inside. The furniture is elegant too, but aside from the kitchen, there aren't many comfy places to sit. The same old cat is here, but they don't keep the kittens when she has them. She's too old to play with. Hannah once told me you ran away with father, and I can see why that would be nice.

I am feeling very unhappy this morning. I heard a story from Cora, The Doctor's Wife, about her mother-in-law being unkind, similar to Aunt M.'s behavior towards me. I wish Hannah had come instead of me, as she is better behaved and doesn't argue as quickly. Aunt J. needs some pieces of my buff calico to fix a button on my dress. The styles in Riverboro are lovely, much better than in Temperance. School is going well. The teacher can answer more questions than the one in Temperance, but not as many as I can ask. I am smarter than all the girls except for one, but not as clever as two boys. Emma Jane is very good at math and spelling but lacks imagination. I am in the Sixth Reader, but Miss Dearborn might move me to a lower class because I struggle with the seven multiplication table. I am trying for the spelling prize but worry about making mistakes in poetry. Last Sunday, I learned the correct spelling of ""seraphim"" and realized my mistake. Miss Dearborn advises using words I can spell correctly. I sew dresses in the afternoons while the others play. I am happy that our cow had a spotted calf.

Rebecca started her education journey on a Monday at Riverboro Centre's school, a mile away. Miss Sawyer drove her there, meeting the teacher, Miss Dearborn, and setting her up with books. Despite Miss Dearborn's lack of formal training, she taught with natural skill. Rebecca loved her walk to school, taking a shortcut through the woods. She crossed streams, passed through meadows, and climbed over stiles, reveling in the beauty of nature. Rebecca cherished her school days, carrying her books and lunch while reciting poems. She and her friend, Emma Jane, acted out poems with great enthusiasm. Rebecca's passion for learning and drama shone through, making her school days delightful.|[]|[]
At the last pair of bars, the two girls sometimes met the Simpson children, who lived in a black house with a red door and barn. Rebecca was intrigued by the Simpsons because they were numerous and patched like her own family. The schoolhouse stood on a hill with fields and a river nearby. Inside, it was plain with wooden desks and a stove. Rebecca struggled with writing but excelled in history. She read with Dick and Living, studied arithmetic with Thuthan, geography with Emma Jane, and grammar with Miss Dearborn. Despite her clever thoughts, she found writing challenging. Rebecca learned about the Revolution with Alice's class. Samuel, known as Seesaw, was indecisive and admired Rebecca's strong character. He often imitated her actions, like drinking from the water pail. One day, when Rebecca asked to drink water, Seesaw followed suit, causing laughter in the classroom. Miss Dearborn, displeased, asked Rebecca to stand by the water pail.|"['1.

"""Rebecca, please don't touch the dipper,"" said Miss Dearborn with sarcasm, noticing Rebecca's shame and anger. Singing the last exercise, Minnie Smellie chose ""Shall we Gather at the River?"" which seemed to have a secret association with the situation. Miss Dearborn noticed Rebecca's distress and decided to end the song early. She explained that she asked Rebecca to stand by the pail to break the habit of constant drinking. Rebecca's classmates sympathized with her by offering gifts. Eventually, Rebecca regained her composure during her grammar lesson.

It was a lovely moment inside the building with Emma Jane's apron around her hair; the bars felt like cold iron against her head, and her eyes seemed to reflect Charlotte Corday's sorrow. Charlotte suggested moving some stones to create a secret place to play prison. However, Rebecca warned against revealing the hiding spot to the other children, fearing they might steal. The conversation turned to Mr. Simpson's trading habits, which often landed him in jail. Suspicion fell on him when the Widow Rideout's sleigh went missing. Despite Abner Simpson's protests of innocence, the sheriff took weeks to prove his guilt. The townspeople helped support the Simpson family, with the children attending school when they had enough clothes. In the villages along Pleasant River, spare time was filled with conversations under trees, over bridges, or by the stove, providing ample opportunities for discussions and social gatherings.|"['1.

However, girls are encouraged to write for it, and the best pieces are chosen. Rebecca was hopeful about contributing. The elderly couple then joined Rebecca in the kitchen, where they noticed her frock had been washed but still had smudges. Despite attempts to improve it, the stains remained visible. Rebecca, feeling the need to face any scolding promptly, decided to leave. Uncle Jerry expressed sympathy for her as she departed.

Rebecca, after contemplating the worth of self-punishment, decided that neither the haircloth worn close to her skin nor the pebble in her shoe was suitable. The haircloth was missing, and the pebble would draw attention from her watchful aunt and hinder her daily activities. Her first attempt at self-sacrifice by skipping the Sunday-school concert had failed miserably, causing chaos among her classmates. Determined to make amends, she chose to part with her cherished pink parasol. With a heavy heart, she tossed it into the well, symbolizing her dedication to self-improvement. Despite initial doubts, Rebecca felt a sense of peace and renewal after this act.

Riverboro was working hard to help the Simpsons, their fellow town residents, by providing them with food and shelter until the children could support themselves. Mrs. Simpson did her best to feed and clothe her family, but they often had little to eat and wear. The children found ways to satisfy their hunger by sitting outside neighbors' kitchens during meal times. To bring some excitement to their dull lives, the young Simpsons decided to sell soap for rewards. With the help of their friends Clara Belle and Susan, they planned to expand their soap-selling business to neighboring villages.

Rebecca and Emma Jane shared a special bond as they embraced in the dusk. Emma Jane worried about the expense of the lamp gifted by Rebecca.

"Every drop of blood in Rebecca's body seemed to stand still, and her heart almost stopped beating. Mrs. Cobb's excited breathing could be heard distinctly in the silence. There was nothing extraordinary in Mr. Burch's request. In his travels among rural church communities, he often met young members who had ""experienced religion"" and joined the church at a young age. Rebecca, at thirteen, had already taken on responsibilities within the church. When Mr. Burch assumed she was a devout member, she faced a dilemma. How could she refuse? How could she explain she wasn't a member? How could she pray before all those elderly women? Rebecca felt overwhelmed as she stood up to pray, her mind filled with images and phrases from Mr. Burch's teachings. Despite her internal struggle, she began to pray slowly and hesitantly, blending hymns and her own thoughts.

"The day before Rebecca left for the South with Miss Maxwell, she was in the library with Emma Jane and Huldah. They were looking at dictionaries and encyclopedias. As they left, they passed locked cases with fiction books, forbidden to students. They glanced longingly at the titles, like hungry kids peering into a bakery. Rebecca spotted a new book called ""_The Rose of Joy_."" She wondered about its meaning. Huldah imagined her own rose of joy as a year in a city with money, horses, fancy clothes, and entertainment. Rebecca couldn't stop thinking about those words. She even considered if the rose of joy could mean sacrifice. The journey southward, the ocean view, the new experiences with Miss Maxwell made Rebecca feel alive and excited. She was eager for knowledge and love, making life rich and full.

Once upon a time, a weary Princess lived in a small cottage by the roadside between two bustling cities. Despite her hardships, she remained grateful for what she had. One day, as she sat exhausted by her toil in the fields, she spotted a magnificent golden chariot approaching. To her surprise, it stopped at her humble abode, and out stepped a Fairy Godmother, a sight she had only read about in stories. The Fairy Godmother asked the Princess why she endured such heavy labor. The Princess explained that while the work was hard, she found solace in knowing that it would yield a bountiful harvest. The next day, a strong man arrived at her door with a message from the Fairy Godmother, instructing the Princess to rest while he tended to the plough.

The Princess walked daily in the green forest, listening to the wind sing in the branches and seeing sunlight filter through the leaves. Thoughts that had been asleep in the stifling air of the cottage awakened as she pricked them on leaves with a needle, sending them into the air. People picked them up, holding them against the sun to read the King's messages. The Princess added thoughts of her Fairy Godmother on the leaves, spreading love and gratitude. Other Princesses followed suit, and their thoughts lived on forever. The Fairy Godmother may one day deliver a message to the King, who will recognize her service. At Wareham, the summer term ended, leaving Rebecca and Emma Jane to represent Riverboro. Mrs. Robinson hosted a ladies' party with strawberries and a rooster feast.|"['1.

"There was only an hour for preparation. Will would drive Rebecca to Temperance and send Jenny back from school. He volunteered also to engage a woman to sleep at the farm in case Mrs. Randall should be worse at any time in the night. Rebecca flew down over the hill to get a last pail of spring water, and as she lifted the bucket from the crystal depths and looked out over the glowing beauty of the autumn landscape, she saw a company of surveyors with their instruments making calculations and laying lines that apparently crossed Sunnybrook at the favorite spot where Mirror Pool lay clear and placid, the yellow leaves on its surface no yellower than its sparkling sands. She caught her breath. ""The time has come!"" she thought. ""I am saying good-by to Sunnybrook, and the golden gates that almost swung together that last day in Wareham will close forever now. Good-by, dear brook and hills and meadows; you are going to see life too, so we must be hopeful and say to one another:--Will Melville had seen the surveyors too, and had heard in the Temperance post-office that morning the probable sum that Mrs. Randall would receive from the railway company. He was in good spirits at his own improved prospects, for his farm was so placed that its value could be only increased by the new road; he was also relieved in mind that his wife's family would no longer be in dire poverty directly at his doorstep, so to speak."|"['**1.
