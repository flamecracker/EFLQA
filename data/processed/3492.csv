During the unexpected and solemn walk up the aisle, the village choir's soprano stopped singing in the middle of the Doxology, leaving the other voices to finish the hymn. Some attendees couldn't recall the exact words of the opening prayer later. It was seen as a sign of Providence that Nancy Wentworth had a new winter dress after five years, matching her beaver muff and victorine. Her outfit had been discussed in Edgewood for weeks, expected as a gesture of respect for the church's reopening. Justin's identity became clear to the congregation during the sermon. When the contribution plate reached them, Justin placed a ten-dollar bill, surprising everyone. Nancy remained composed, proud of Justin's generosity. This act improved Justin's reputation in town, leading to assumptions about his newfound wealth. The neighbors believed that Nancy's influence would bring success to Justin. The passage describes the beauty of the apple orchards in spring, with delicate petals falling like snow and the landscape painted in shades of green and white.

The excitement of her new surroundings had her mind spinning. She surprised her mother with a unique version of the Lord's Prayer before settling into bed.

Dear Martha was a patient and devoted companion to Susanna. As they toiled together in the bright, spacious kitchen, every surface gleamed like a mirror. Martha, a member of the Society since infancy, shared her wisdom with Susanna. She noticed a fleeting worldly allure in little Sue, despite her gentle nature. Susanna, worried about Sue adapting to Shaker customs, recounted Sue's request to cut her curls. Martha, a woman of few words, believed in living out one's beliefs rather than debating. She was a talented musician, composing hymns that she considered divinely inspired. The barn, a place of reflection, stood tall and proud, offering a serene view of Massabesic Pond and the distant White Mountains. Susanna often sat by the open window, sewing while Sue played at her feet, building castles out of corncobs.|"[""1.

Sue noticed that someone didn't care much about what others did and shared a poem she needed to learn. The poem described different foods served on China dishes. Sue's friend advised her not to talk too much. Sue then recounted a story about Elder Calvin Green, a Shaker who received a sign from a quail in the woods, leading him to establish a settlement. They met a girl named Polly Reed who wanted to join the Shakers. Polly later became a teacher, Eldress, and preacher. Sue wondered if she could endure a similar journey like Polly. The story continued with the Believers gathering on a Sabbath day, dressed in traditional attire. Tabitha reminisced about the old times when visions and spiritual manifestations were common among the Shakers. Hetty Arnold expressed a desire for more religious experiences like the ones in the past.|['1.

In the past, our church was young, and we needed signs and pictures to understand our faith. Now, we think and reason more, putting away our old ways. We've received revelations guiding us to change our worship practices. Today, our service began with a solemn song, followed by a visiting elder's words and prayer. Then, we rose and danced rhythmically, symbolizing our souls' journey to redemption. Susanna, contemplating joining the Community, shared her thoughts. Elder Gray assured her time to decide without pressure. The group supported her decision. Eldress Abby reminded all of the sacrifices required to follow the Lord.

Young Brother Nathan quietly expressed his concern for the weaker members of the community. Inspired, Tabitha, Abby, and Martha sang a powerful Shaker song, symbolizing spiritual unity. The group, led by the Brethren, marched in circles, embodying the four dispensations of Shakerism. As the worship intensified, the believers felt faith-infused, with Sister Martha deeply absorbed. The hymn grew in strength, filling the room with fervor. After a moment of silence, the group left solemnly. Susanna pondered her decision to leave her husband and son as she returned to her building. Nathan and Hetty, raised in the Shaker faith, had a platonic relationship until a moment of unspoken connection changed everything. Their gaze conveyed love, creating an invisible bond that neither could break.|"['1.

"Hetty and Nathan found themselves in a moment of turmoil. Hetty's kerchief fluttered as her face blushed, while Nathan's knees shook with nervousness. The Elder's sacred march began, and Nathan struggled to stand still, fearing the upcoming meeting with Hetty. As they walked side by side among the Believers, Nathan wondered if Hetty could hear his racing heart. Meanwhile, Hetty was equally anxious, hoping Nathan wouldn't notice her embarrassment.

After the meeting, Nathan sought solace in the barn, while Hetty sat by a window with a book, lost in thoughts. Nathan, consumed by guilt and remorse, suffered more than Hetty, who was still unsure of her feelings. One morning, as Hetty and Susanna worked in the herb-garden, Nathan approached, catching Hetty's attention. Susanna noticed Hetty's flushed cheeks and quickened breath, hinting at her feelings for Nathan.

Susanna observed the unfolding emotions between Nathan and Hetty, realizing the challenges of human nature within the Shaker community. Despite the strict warnings and teachings, the natural instincts of the young members surfaced, leading to a delicate situation. Susanna empathized with the youngsters, understanding the internal struggles they faced in a life of celibacy and self-discipline within the Shaker community."|"['1.

"Hetty whispered, ""You're right, Susanna, but the world outside isn't easy for girls like us. Here, we must behave like angels, confessing every wrong thought. Out there, people can do as they please."" She sobbed, feeling trapped. Later, she met Nathan, and they shared their struggles. Nathan expressed bitterness towards his father, while Hetty felt abandoned by her family. The strict rules of the Shaker Community governed their interactions, yet Nathan and Hetty found solace in each other's company. Despite the constraints, they longed for freedom and considered leaving. As they embraced under the spruce tree, the barriers of their sheltered lives dissolved, and they shared a forbidden moment of connection, defying the teachings of their faith."|"['1.

Nathan and Hetty left the Shaker village, venturing into the world like Adam and Eve from the garden. Despite Eldress Abby's teachings echoing in Hetty's mind, Nathan's voice drew her closer. The Shaker Sisters, always busy, knitted socks diligently, even the children. Sister Martha led hymns, and Sue, usually impulsive, knitted with grace, joining in the singing. Sue's cap mishap led to a charming moment. Later, Sue marveled at her knitting, feeling a sense of accomplishment. Meanwhile, Jack, in a letter to his mother, shared his daily life, including Aunt Louisa's strict rules and his longing for a new knife. He also mentioned his father's upcoming plans and the school book prize. Jack humorously remarked on his adventures, leaving his mother with a mix of amusement and concern.|"['1.

Recently, Susanna received messages reminding her of home duties and responsibilities. She worried about John giving up the store, fearing he might have worsened in solitude. Concerned about her children's future if she were to die, she wondered if her daughter Louisa would care for Jack. She pondered if the Shakers would take Sue, leaving her children divided. Distressed by unanswered questions, Susanna felt unbalanced. Sue, trying to comfort her, believed some things were different, like the climbing and sliding kinds. Sue wished her father and brother would visit, imagining a happy family moment. Eldress Abby, feeling a heaviness despite material prosperity, sought solace in prayer.

Hetty's wild nature was unforgettable during her first month. She couldn't contain her laughter during a meeting and caused a ruckus. Eldress Abby tried to calm her by asking her to repent in silence, but Hetty's mischievous spirit prevailed. Instead of reflecting, she mischievously cut buttonholes in Abby's apron strings with scissors. Elder Gray chuckled at the memory, acknowledging that Hetty and Nathan, two children from less religious families, had caused some trouble. Abby worried about Hetty's influence on others after ten years of training in the Shaker community. Meanwhile, Elder Daniel expressed concern about Susanna, a gifted teacher who seemed to be slipping away.

She lay down beside Sue, seeking warmth and comfort in her touch, falling into a serene sleep until the next morning. Susanna faced challenges, as did John Hathaway. The gossips assumed Susanna's absence meant a permanent separation. Jack was only partly content with his aunt, and Louisa's demeanor indicated she kept him for Susanna's sake.
