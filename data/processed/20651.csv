I was a skilled swimmer and could dive proficiently. While learning to swim underwater, I hadn't practiced much of it at that time. Almost ready to leave the water, I decided to dive from a post at the end of the wharf and swim towards the shore underwater. My plan was to stay submerged until I reached shallow water where I could stand and walk ashore. After a few strokes, I touched the bottom and prepared to resurface, but I unexpectedly hit a hard object. Realizing I was under a large mud-scow, I panicked as my breath ran short. Feeling disoriented, I struggled to find my way out from under it. Just when I feared the worst, I spotted a pair of legs through the water, belonging to a boy named Rectus, who I didn't know at the time. Despite the circumstances, I felt relieved and weak with gratitude, eventually managing to wade ashore. Rectus, known for being exceptionally well-behaved, earned his nickname at school and was well-liked by his peers, even though he wasn't academically gifted.|"['1.

After completing my studies at the academy, the principal encouraged me to go to college, but I decided to take a break. I wanted to travel, so I planned a trip to Florida and some Southern States, maybe even the West Indies. My parents supported the idea, except my younger sister, who wanted to come along. However, due to financial constraints, I had to travel alone. Dr. Mathews, our family physician, suggested this trip to help me relax after years of studying. Despite the professor's preference for me to attend college, he agreed that traveling would be beneficial. Eventually, Mr. Colbert proposed that his son, Samuel, accompany me on the journey, offering to pay me a salary for looking after him. My friends teased us, but we all had a great time at a pre-travel supper hosted by my mother.|"[""1.

I waited on the steamer for Rectus, who was running late. The ship was set to depart at three, and it was already past two. The weather was nice, but I was getting cold from waiting. Finally, Rectus arrived with his parents in a carriage. It had been almost a year since we last saw each other. He hadn't changed much. His parents were happy to see me. We went to the upper deck, and Rectus's father took me into the captain's room for privacy. He gave me money for my trip, advising me to keep it safe. He didn't mention any specific plans for the journey, leaving me surprised and with no time to ask questions before they rushed off the ship.|"['1.

I promised Rectus's mother, a friendly lady, that I would take excellent care of her son, especially during storms. She seemed comforted by my assurances. After Mr. Colbert escorted his wife ashore, Rectus and I observed them leaving in a carriage. Although Rectus didn't appear as happy as expected for our exciting journey, seeing familiar faces made a difference. Harry Alden, Scott, Tom Myers, and his brother George surprised us in our small state-room. We all laughed as they struggled to fit into the tight sleeping shelves. As the ship departed, we were already a good distance from the dock, but we were thrilled to begin our adventure.|"[""1.

Tom Myers and his brother George were heading to the pilot-house when Rectus yelled to stop the engine. Rectus, about to go below, was reassured by Scott that going back with the pilot would be fun. Scott explained that pilots often take passengers part of the way. They all enjoyed the busy scene on deck. However, Tom and George seemed unhappy. Realizing the situation, the narrator decided to inform the purser that some passengers weren't going the full trip. The purser asked about the gong, but Tom and George had not inquired about it earlier. The narrator refrained from commenting on the captain's worsening mood.|"['1.

Scott decided to be honest and explained how they chose to stay on board the steamer quietly after realizing it had already departed. He expressed concern about their return and the professor's reaction. Tom and George Myers quietly cried, trying not to cause a scene. Scott mentioned putting them on a vessel back to New York, feeling they had behaved poorly. They all hoped to find a craft willing to take them back. Despite the cold, they stayed on deck looking for a suitable ship. They considered the large vessels unsuitable and trusted the captain to handle the arrangements. Feeling too cold, they eventually went below deck, unaware they could warm up near the smokestack.|"[""1.

"Scott exclaimed, ""Hurrah! We're heading back on a pilot-boat!"" We hurried to the lower deck as our engines halted. A small, rough schooner with a large ""17"" on her sail was close by, changing direction. The purser mentioned they were coming to us. Concerned about the boys needing money for their passage, I offered to lend some to Rectus, who agreed. I handed a banknote to Scott, who promised to return it in his first letter. The pilot-schooner sent a boat with two men to our ship. The captain called out, inviting the boys aboard the pilot-boat. Scott and Harry rushed down to the boat, while Tom and George bid us farewell. Rectus and I watched as the boys boarded the schooner, waving goodbye. As we considered our roles, I pondered whether to supervise Rectus or travel as friends. After dinner, the ship's movements made me unwell, forcing me to retire to bed."|"['1.

After a long sleep, I woke up to find Rectus on a bench, sucking a lemon. Despite feeling sick, he claimed it helped. The ship tossed, sending him headfirst. The next day, we stood near the smoke-stack, trying to stay warm. Rectus, usually not great at calculations, spent time mapping our journey from Sandy Hook to Savannah. He tried to predict our location, but his map needed frequent adjustments. Early the next morning, we were awakened by commotion on deck. The ship was rocking more than before. The first officer and sailors used a lead to measure the water's depth. Rectus and I watched as they checked the bottom's type to determine our location. It was fascinating to see how they navigated the ship using such methods.|"['1.

Rectus went to speak with Mr. Randall about the depth of the sea, holding a piece of tallow in his hand. Despite my initial annoyance, Rectus meant no harm. By breakfast, all was well again. The next morning, the weather warmed up, and the sea was calmer. Rectus, looking pale, shared his calculations, suggesting we had passed the mouth of the Savannah River and were off the Georgia coast. We were the first off the ship, reaching the hotel ahead of others. In Savannah, we explored the beautiful city with its green squares and blossoming gardens. Rectus wanted to buy a straw hat, but I pointed out that the locals knew best how to dress for their mild winter weather.|"['1.

Rectus didn't know the answer, and the topic was dropped. There is a lovely park behind the town where we strolled, sat under trees, admired the flowers, and watched the fountain. It was a delightful experience, especially for Rectus, who seemed more animated than usual. We arrived in Savannah on Tuesday and were scheduled to depart for St. Augustine on Thursday afternoon. Thursday morning, we visited the Bonaventure cemetery, a beautiful place with long avenues of live-oaks draped in gray moss. Rectus had a unique notion that it was a graveyard for old men who hung their beards on trees. This idea surprised our driver, but Rectus was in high spirits, feeling awakened by the warm weather. When we reached St. Augustine, we eagerly awaited the high tide to enter the harbor. The town looked picturesque, like a painting, with its green trees, low houses, and an ancient Spanish fort. We couldn't wait to explore the town and the historic fort.|"['1.

"We didn't stay at a hotel. I had a letter for Mr. Cholott. On our way up, someone called his name. I gave him the letter, and we had a chat. He suggested a boarding house, cheaper and more fun. He spoke about the Minorcans, descendants of natives from Minorca. They settled in town and are good people. We didn't board with them but stayed at a lady's house with a view of the harbor. We saw the ""Tigris"" sail out. We decided to buy straw hats. St. Augustine had narrow sandy streets with houses having balconies that almost touched.

"We tried on many straw hats in town and bought a few from a small house where young women crafted them. Rectus whispered if one of the women was a Mohican, but I quieted him. Rectus often confused ""Mohican"" with ""Minorcan,"" but he took corrections well. I got a regular hat, while Rectus chose a wide-brimmed one resembling a Japanese umbrella. After stuffing our felt hats in our pockets, we headed to the fort but realized it was supper-time. The sea air had given us big appetites. Sea-beans, hard seeds from the West Indies, wash up on Florida's shores. Rectus shared an encounter with a man who mistook him for a Spaniard due to his hat."|"['1.

"In this town, there is much to discover about fish and many other interesting things. Once we finish exploring the fort, we can embark on an exciting expedition. After breakfast, we headed to the fort located just outside town. The fort, now known as Fort Marion, was originally called San Marco by the Spanish. As we crossed the drawbridge and entered the fort, we encountered a group of Native Americans dressed in United States military uniforms. They greeted us with ""How?"" and friendly handshakes. These Native Americans were actually prisoners taken by the U.S. troops from the far West and were being held as hostages. Mr. Cholott, our guide, showed us around the fort, including the ramparts, Indian barracks, and lookout towers. We even explored the dungeons where famous chiefs like Osceola were once imprisoned. It was a fascinating and slightly eerie experience, but we learned a lot about the fort's history and the lives of these Native American prisoners."|"[""1.

After Mr. Cholott left, we explored the fort on our own. That afternoon, we sat on the outer wall by the harbor and watched the sailboats and fishermen. We saw sharks swimming near the town, a first for us. Rectus was concerned about the imprisoned Indians, some unfairly captured. An old man named Menendez offered us a boat. Later, we walked by the sea-wall on a starlit night. Rectus wanted to sneak into the fort at night, so we crossed the drawbridge but found the gate shut. We contemplated climbing the walls with a rope due to dents from past bombardments. We bought a rope and a grapnel to scale the walls but needed a plan to secure the rope.

"A few days passed as we prepared for our plan to surprise the fort. During our visits, we encountered many Indians who roamed freely. Despite the distance from their homes, they seemed content. One notable figure, a large man named ""Maiden's Heart,"" stood out with his intimidating demeanor. Another, a young chief named Crowded Owl, showed us kindness despite the language barrier. We discussed strategies, including muffling our grapnel to avoid detection.

"I was on the brink of yelling, but decided to stay silent. I quickly resolved that if I didn't hear or see him soon, I would dash to the gate and alert those inside with a loud noise. Yet, it turned out unnecessary as the rope descended once more, and I grasped it. Tugging on it, I found it secure and began my ascent. Climbing swiftly, I felt a few pulls from above, as if someone was trying to hoist me up. Despite their efforts, I was too heavy compared to Rectus. As I approached the top, a hand grabbed me and helped me over the wall. There stood Rectus, and the one who aided us was the tall Indian, ""Maiden's Heart."" Before we could speak, Maiden's Heart motioned for us to follow him to a corner near a lookout tower. Silently, we entered the tower, with the Indian indicating for us to lead the way. Inside, he stood before us, waiting for our words. ""I doubt it,"" I said. ""But now that we're here, what's our plan?

"""No, they wouldn't,"" I said. ""For I hadn't much more change with me. And if I had had it, I wouldn't have given them any more. I'd have called up the captain first. The thing was getting too expensive.""

""Well, I'm glad I'm out of it,"" said Rectus. ""And I don't believe much in any of those Indians being very innocent. I thought Maiden's Heart was one of the best of them, but he's a regular rascal. He knew we wanted to back out of that affair, and he just fleeced us.""

We were both out of conceit with the noble red man. Rectus took his proclamation out of his pocket as we walked along the sea-wall, and, tearing it into little pieces, threw it into the water. When we reached the steam-ship wharf, we walked out to the end of it, to get rid of the rope and grapnel. I whirled the grapnel round and round, and let the whole thing fly far out into the harbor. It was a sheer waste of a good strong rope, but we should have had a dreary time getting the knots out of it. I was not very well satisfied with our trip over the walls of San Marco.

At the bustling wharf, Crowded Owl approached us with beans, but I firmly declined. Unfazed, he lingered as we moved on, persisting with his offer. Growing impatient, I refused more forcefully, causing him to retreat. Later, near the club-house, he conversed with Maiden's Heart, sharing his harsh views on Indians due to his past in the Seminole war. Despite our efforts to reason with him, his bitterness remained. We then ventured to North Beach, where we learned to fish under the guidance of Old Menendez. After rolling up our pants and wading into the water, we cast our lines with bait into the surf. Despite my decent throws, Menendez's casts outshone mine, while Rectus struggled with his technique. Nonetheless, we embraced this new fishing experience with enthusiasm.|"['1.

We stood in the sand, waiting for a bite as the waves lapped at our knees. There wasn't much action. Menendez blamed the low tide, but I've learned there's always an excuse when fishing. Suddenly, Rectus made a misstep, getting his pants soaked. We rushed to help him as he struggled in the water. I grabbed him and pulled him back. Menendez removed the hook, revealing a large bass thrashing on the sand. Then, we noticed a girl and her father watching us from a sailboat. The girl, around thirteen, wished she had a fishing line to catch a fish. Their presence made us uncomfortable, especially since we were barefoot. It seemed like a good time to call it a day.|"['1.

The young girl was eager to fish, willing to wade into the water. Her father, preferring her to stay dry, tied her line to his and cast it far into the surf. Focused on her task, she stood on the sand, ready for a big catch. Her father advised her to be silent to not scare the fish, sharing his fishing wisdom. Despite waiting patiently, the fish did not bite. As the tide was low and a storm approached, they decided to call it a day. The girl's father bought the fishing line, and they all headed back to their boat, hungry but content.

He stood up and grabbed an oar, trying to push the boat free, but it remained stuck. We had left him far behind, but Rectus suggested going back to help. Menendez hesitated, feeling it unfair to delay dinner for a man who ignored advice. Reluctantly, we turned back and found the boat grounded badly. The man admitted they should have seen the sandbar. With the tide low, the only option was to wait. Concerned for his daughter, he asked us to take her to town on our boat. As they sailed off, the daughter explained her father's stubbornness. She introduced herself as Cornelia but preferred Corny. Her father, seeking a cure for a weak lung, ignored warnings and got them stranded.

Arriving at Tocoi, a small place where we quickly boarded a steamboat on the St. John's River. The river was vast but night fell fast, signaling dinner time. We had to spend the night in Pilatka due to a scheme to profit from travelers. The next morning, we boarded a peculiar boat, like a river wheelbarrow, and set off down the St. John's River. The town was pretty with orange groves instead of potato patches. Before departing, we rented a rifle for potential game sightings. The boat was small, accommodating only a few passengers, with most enjoying the upper deck. Mrs. Chipperton stayed in the saloon, observing quietly.|"['1.

"As we boarded the boat, a peculiar party caught our eye. It consisted of a lady and two gentlemen who were hunters. The lady, although not a hunter herself, was dressed in attire suitable for accompanying men in hunting gear. The men wore tall yellow boots and carried all the necessary hunting equipment. Matching their boots, the lady wore yellow gloves. As we sailed up the St. John's River, the men strolled around casually, displaying their comfort with the hunting lifestyle. They were at ease, as if wearing such attire daily was second nature to them. Rectus amusingly dubbed them ""the yellow-legged party."" After traveling about twenty-five miles up the river, we navigated into the forest through a narrow passage. The Oclawaha River welcomed us with its enchanting scenery, resembling a fairy-tale land. The river meandered amid towering trees, creating picturesque views with greenery, hanging moss, and reflections on the tranquil water. Rectus surprised us with his keen interest in hunting, eagerly scanning the surroundings for game. Meanwhile, the lady in the yellow gloves expressed her excitement about spotting alligators, adding a touch of thrill to our peaceful journey through the serene river."|"[""1.

Corny spotted an alligator while on a boat trip. Startled, she screamed loudly, causing a commotion among the passengers. The alligator quickly slid off the log it was resting on and disappeared before most could see it. The ladies on board were annoyed by Corny's loud reaction and advised her to scream softly if she saw another alligator. Despite the scarcity of alligators on the trip due to the cool weather, Corny went to the upper deck hoping to spot more. However, her hat got caught on a tree branch, and despite her request to stop the boat, the captain informed her they would have to retrieve it later. Corny then reappeared on the lower deck wearing a seal-skin hat and tried her hand at shooting with a pistol, but she missed her target.|"[""1.

And off she went. Rectus and I stopped practicing with our rifles. We couldn't hit anything, and the idea of harming a bird without purpose led us to follow Corny's lead and put away our gun. However, the other shooters continued until sundown. As we sat on the deck admiring the scenery, Corny returned to us. She mentioned that the people speaking French on board were not really French, as she understood their English conversations better. Corny decided to confront them, and as she boldly spoke up in English, we all burst into laughter. The group she addressed turned red and avoided further conversation in French.

Corny, a self-taught and spirited girl, impressed the narrator with her unique way of speaking French. Despite lacking a formal teacher, Corny's father believed in pronouncing words as they were spelled. As the group continued their journey along the river, the boat navigated through obstacles with ease, guided by skilled men using poles to maneuver. At nightfall, a fire was lit on the boat, illuminating the surroundings like a magical scene from a fairy tale. The narrator and Rectus were captivated by the enchanting sight, reluctant to leave the deck even for supper. Mr. Chipperton marveled at the spectacle, suggesting that theater artists could draw inspiration from the mesmerizing display for their performances.|"['1.

Before bedtime, our steam-whistle started to blow, and in the distance within the forest, we could hear another whistle occasionally. The captain informed us that a boat was approaching down the river and would soon pass us. Although the river seemed too narrow for two boats, when the other whistle sounded closer, we navigated our boat to the shore among the spatterdocks, waiting in a cove to yield the channel. Soon, the boat appeared illuminated, with a blazing fire in its iron box. It was a magnificent sight emerging from the dark forest. The water was crystal clear as we had entered a stream from Silver Spring, the end of our journey into the cypress woods. The transparency of the water was strikingly different from the river. Upon reaching Silver Spring, resembling a small lake with houses on the bank, we docked, preparing to disembark for a few hours.|"['1.

Rectus expressed his regret, wishing he had brought a bottle filled with sweet oil and phosphorus to lower into the wells. He envisioned the bottle shining as it descended, allowing them to see the depths clearly. As they leaned over the boat, Corny emerged from the water, her face upturned, eyes wide open, creating a mesmerizing sight. Corny explained how she accidentally fell in but managed to keep her eyes open underwater. The gentleman and his family in another boat were unaware of the incident until Corny was rescued. Rectus and the narrator took Corny for a brisk run to warm her up after the dip.

As the boat was ready to depart, Mr. Chipperton arrived with a load of gray moss. After hearing about Corny's mishap, he paused his task and acknowledged the help we had provided. He mentioned how Corny always seemed to find trouble whenever he left her side. Despite the tree being cut down, he saw it as a travel trophy. Our return journey had fewer gunshots, more alligators, and the yellow-legged group stayed with us until St. Augustine. Rectus was more lively, showing a change in attitude towards Corny. The day after returning, Corny met us at the sea-wall, sharing that she had something important to discuss. She gifted us a box of dominoes as a token of gratitude for our help in saving her.|"['1.

As we strolled through the town, we noticed that the locals were as abundant as the conch-shells, but much more spirited. The colored folks were carefree and full of life, spreading joy wherever they went. Some of the young ones were so energetic they could outlast a shrimp in a dance-off. Most of our fellow travelers opted for the town's grand hotel, a sturdy structure reminiscent of exotic lands with arches instead of doors. However, Mr. Chipperton was disappointed by the lack of fireplaces, deeming it too tropical. Despite this, he soon realized that gathering around a hearth wasn't a common pastime in the warm town. For a week, Mr. Chipperton explored the island with his family in a horse-drawn carriage, while Rectus and I preferred walking, allowing us to observe more.

Corny explained that there was a colony of native Africans in town, rescued from slavery by an English man-of-war. They wore old, patched clothes and had their own governor, with a queen among them.

Corny, Rectus, and I were in agreement about the peaceful re-enthronement of the African ex-sovereigness. We aimed for a quiet restoration of her regal status without causing a commotion. Our plan involved placing her in a suitable royal position and seeking recognition from her people. Rectus, chosen as the leader, suggested that the queen need not handle governance directly, much like Queen Victoria. Instead, she could appoint a good man as a Prime Minister to manage affairs. As Treasurer, I proposed appointing an emissary, and we all agreed on Priscilla, a lively and sharp young girl we knew from the hotel market.

The queen's residence was not a grand palace but a modest house barely big enough for a traditional four-posted bed like those at Aunt Sarah's. Despite the small living space, the queen, a dignified woman in her sixties, sat outside surrounded by sugar-cane and pepper-pods, waiting for customers. Determined to help her, the children decided to buy her stock and put an end to her door-to-door sales. With a sense of style, the queen agreed to the plan with a nod and a courtesy. They left her with some money for daily expenses and gifts for the children.

"""I can't tell,"" I said. ""But I doubt they will. They don't mind the black governor, and our queen won't interfere with them. She only deals with the native Africans who keep to themselves."" ""Regarding revenue,"" Rectus chimed in before we reached the hotel, ""I don't think these people have much money. They should provide provisions instead. It could be organized, like a weekly supply of conchs, sugar-cane, and yams. This way, it wouldn't burden anyone."" I noticed differences between Corny and Rectus. Corny, though less educated, could reason well with facts. Rectus excelled in learned concepts but lacked in independent reasoning. Corny, earnest as ever, seemed more thoughtful, maybe due to her important tasks. Despite her impulsive speech, she was a good girl. Later, we held a meeting with Priscilla, who swiftly dismissed the young sellers. The local currency is English, but American money is common due to U.S. visitors. Small transactions use English currency, while American currency is used for larger amounts.

We spoke with her about her responsibilities, each of us sharing our thoughts. We explained that she needed to be available every afternoon to accompany Corny if needed on our trips to the African settlement. After outlining our plans for the queen, which intrigued her, we asked her to gather around twenty intelligent Africans for a meeting. The gathering was scheduled for the next afternoon at the Queen's Stairway, a staircase carved into limestone leading out of a ravine. We decided it was a suitable spot for our meeting. Later, Rectus and I visited Goliah Brown, the African governor, a kind man with a house slightly better than his peers'. We discussed appointing him as the prime minister, but he was reluctant due to his current position and the queen's lack of English skills. Despite his reservations, we persisted, explaining the importance of the role.|"[""1.

The situation seemed discouraging. Just when the elderly man believed he had resolved the issue, a bright idea struck me: we could establish the monarchy as an independent system. Goliah might agree to this, as long as we didn't interfere with his governance. If Poqua-dilla was acknowledged as a queen, crowned, and given a sufficient income to prevent her from engaging in retail, that would be the best outcome for her at this stage in life. She likely wouldn't want to govern. The few subjects we would recruit would serve more as courtiers than anything else. Rectus acknowledged the challenges but suggested we could cover the income ourselves until after the coronation. The following day, around noon, we visited the actual governor of the colony. Though Rectus and I were indifferent, Corny insisted, fearing the authorities. We took Priscilla along for respectability. At the governor's grand house, Priscilla guided us to a side entrance, bypassing the front where the English flag flew. Inside, the governor's office was well-appointed, and he welcomed us graciously. If not for Corny, he might not have paid us much attention, but a girl like her easily captured interest. The secretary treated her courteously, and Corny explained our unconventional plan for a black queen from Africa.|['1.

Rectus and Corny spoke to the governor about an old African woman who was believed to be of royal descent but was living in poverty. They wanted to acknowledge her royal heritage and give her a little taste of being a queen among her people. The governor agreed to their plan and assured them there were no rules against it on the island. He provided them with a paper commission to carry out their coronation, emphasizing the importance of not making the woman a pauper. The governor bid them farewell, and they left feeling grateful for his support. Corny, Rectus, and the others discussed the encounter on their way home, with Corny making a lighthearted comment about Rectus' school nickname.|"[""1.

In the afternoon, we held a big rally at the Queen's Stairway. Corny couldn't join us as her mom wanted her to rest at home and work on the new flag for the coronation. The flag we designed had a black background with a yellow sun rising in the middle, though it looked more like a yellow cog-wheel in mud. As Rectus and I reached the stairs via the old fort, Priscilla appeared with a group of barefoot kids. We made them stay at the bottom of the stairs to address them. We spoke to them while Priscilla tried to keep them quiet. The next day was the coronation, and we reminded our supporters to be there early. We also enjoyed watching the local dive tradition, where the boys dived for coins. It was fun to see them swim and search for the coins in the clear water.|"['1.

The following day, everyone was busy at work. Corny and her mother visited the queen's house to plan and make it more comfortable. Mrs. Chipperton contributed to the budget, and they bought items to spruce up the place, transforming Poqua-dilla's room. They even upgraded the rocking-chair. To prepare for the ceremony, they hired a man to set up a flagpole and started creating a crown. After much searching, they found a brass saucepan that served as a base for the crown. With rented tools, they crafted the crown, giving it a royal look. The next morning, they gathered at the queen's house, ready for the ceremony. Various court officials were appointed, adding to the grandeur of the event. Corny was in charge of crowning, while a speech was to be delivered. The ceremony was set to begin at ten o'clock, with a crowd of curious onlookers, mostly locals, eagerly waiting to witness the proceedings.|"[""1.

"We planned to hold the coronation inside the house, but the crowd was too big. So, we moved the rocking-chair outside, in front of the only window in the palace. The yard was spacious enough for many people, and those who couldn't fit in had space on the road. We wanted Poqua-dilla to remove her turban as a crown on a turban seemed odd, but she refused. With the neighbor-woman as an interpreter, we realized it was best not to push Poqua-dilla too much. Around ten-thirty, we led her out and made her sit in the rocking-chair. Mrs. Chipperton and the neighbor-woman held her hands, but she soon pulled away. Corny held the crown, padded with red flannel. I stood facing the crowd, ready to speak. When I finished, I signaled Corny to place the crown. The queen stood tall, and I called out, ""Long live the queen!"" The crowd erupted in cheers and celebrations. Later, I gave a bag of coppers to Priscilla, and the kingdom rejoiced."|"['1.

They all shouted and scrambled until Priscilla, dancing with her bag, threw into the road. Each person broke free, and a new rush was made, creating a fresh group in a minute. We laughed until our backs hurt, but when I glanced at the house, I saw the queen on her doorstep, sadly watching the chaos. Even her neighbor had joined in, leaving her alone. I was pleased to see the queen, still wearing her crown (a saucepan), wisely staying out of the fray. I gave her a shilling, making her happy. After a few scrambles, Priscilla threw out the remaining pennies, racing to collect them first. We left, promising to return. Later, we saw a commotion at the African settlement. Priscilla, now crowned, sat in a rocking chair with a fan, looking regal. The Lord High Chancellor and courtiers seemed downcast, possibly due to a change in power. The Hof-rath appeared troubled, hinting at a struggle for the throne.|['1. What did Priscilla throw into the road during the chaos?\nA) Bag\nB) Crown\nC) Pennies\nD) Fan\nE) Saucepan', '2.

Priscilla was speaking and fanning herself gently with her fan. She seemed to be telling the others her plans but was abruptly interrupted by the Hof-rath, causing her to erupt in anger. Standing on a chair, she proclaimed herself the queen and demanded that the Hof-rath be seized. Determined to stop this unjust act, we sought help from two yellow-leg men we encountered. Together, we charged towards Priscilla's house. The crowd scattered as we approached, and Priscilla fled inside, discarding her crown and escaping through a back door. We pursued her, but she swiftly evaded us, running barefoot towards the town's outskirts. Despite our efforts, Priscilla's agility and speed outmatched us, leading her to vanish into a limestone quarry, leaving us in awe of her escape skills.|"['1.

We strolled home along the road near the harbor. The refreshing breeze from the water was delightful. Upon arriving at the hotel, we discovered Mr. and Mrs. Chipperton and Corny waiting for dinner outside in the courtyard. Many armchairs were always available for guests to relax while waiting for meals or any other expected event. Corny was deeply shocked upon hearing the distressing news about the fall of our kingdom, and Mrs. Chipperton seemed on the verge of tears. Despite Corny's eagerness to rush to Poqua-dilla's house to assist, we advised against it. The situation could wait until after supper, and the old woman would be safe for the night.

Corny explained the new issue to his friends, Rectus and his dad. A lawsuit over a tiny four-inch overlap between their house and a neighbor's lot in New York. The neighbor sued, demanding the wall be moved. Rectus's dad refused, leading to them having to return to New York. Rectus was calm about it all, despite the tension. Eventually, it was revealed that the neighbor suing was actually Rectus's father.

I couldn't offer much help, and it's understandable that you're both upset with each other. I'm truly sorry for how things have turned out. It felt so different here yesterday. It must have seemed strange to see a boy and a girl shaking hands in front of the hotel. A young boy took advantage of the situation and sold us some overpriced liquorice seeds. Nassau wasn't very exciting at that time. My friend Corny and I found it quite dull. Even Mr. Colbert didn't seem happy. Our disagreement didn't affect the locals, the sky, or the taste of bananas. The days were cloudy, and I wasn't a good customer at the market. Colbert and I maintained a cold distance. One evening, I found him writing in my room. We had planned to go home together, but now he might stay. I found a box of dominoes Corny gave us and invited Colbert to play.|['1.

He didn't prepare for bed but instead went to the window for a while before returning to the table. He printed neatly on the lid of the domino-box, displaying names and titles skillfully. After finishing, he readied for bed, leaving the box with an inscription. The next morning, we decided to explore unvisited places in Nassau. We chose to visit Fort Charlotte, an old fort with underground rooms and passages. The fort, devoid of soldiers, was a peaceful sight. The group, including Mr. and Mrs. Chipperton, a lady from Chicago, and Mr. Burgan, went on foot. The fort, atop a hill, had a shoemaker as the guide. He led us through dark, rock-carved rooms, reminiscent of a coal mine but cleaner. One room was the governor's, a private retreat created by the Earl of Dunmore, an intriguing historical figure we had learned about.|"['1.

The fort had a hidden underground passage that led to a dark well with winding steps. The general-in-chief took us down the passage under the fort, through a moat that used to be full of water. The passage was narrow and dark, leading to a lookout point. We explored cautiously, aware of the risk of the walls collapsing. After our adventure, we decided to visit an old woman named Poqua-dilla. Mrs. Chipperton suggested leaving her to her own devices, but we felt compelled to offer some help before departing. As we left, we realized Mr. Chipperton was missing and went back to find him near the shoemaker's work area.|"['1.

The cobbler quickly sprang up, and with our help, the bench was moved and the trap-door opened swiftly. Mrs. Chipperton turned pale upon seeing the open well and no sign of Mr. Chipperton. Eagerly, we followed the man with the lamp down the winding stairs. Despite our assurance that they need not come, everyone joined. At the end of the narrow passage, Mr. Chipperton stood holding a lit match, examining something on the wall. As we rushed in, he smiled, about to speak when Corny and his wife embraced him. He explained that he stayed behind out of curiosity, emphasizing the importance of staying put if ever left alone in unfamiliar places to avoid getting lost and frightened like those lost in the Mammoth Cave.|['1.

When I first visited this place, I was with a group of men and women. We sailed on a big boat and took some divers along to fetch interesting things for us from underwater. These divers were ordinary folks in linen pants for diving, similar to those who dive for coins in town. My plan was to dive at the coral reef and find something for myself, like a sea-fan, to bring home as a souvenir. While I wasn't as skilled a swimmer as the divers, I was good at diving and swimming. So, with my friend Rectus, we rented a sailboat and headed to the reef with just the captain. The next morning, we set off early with the yacht's tall captain, Chris, and two boys, anchoring over the reef after a pleasant sail. I made a couple of attempts to dive, grabbing a coral knob on one dive, but it wouldn't budge. On my next try, I aimed to find something I could bring up, but I couldn't stay underwater like the experienced divers could.|"[""1.

As I descended into the water, I landed on a sea-fan and swiftly grabbed it. Expecting it to yield easily, I was startled when my right foot landed on a large round sponge, sending a chill through me. The slimy, sticky sensation felt horrid, like a cold, woolly mouth trying to swallow my foot. Startled, I released everything and resurfaced, gasping for air on the boat. Rectus advised against trying again, mentioning that three attempts were enough. Despite his concern, I was determined to retrieve something from the seabed. After a brief rest, I dove back down, seizing a massive sea-feather. Struggling to dislodge it, I faced the challenge of holding my breath and eventually surfaced with the sea-feather in hand, despite the tide pulling me away from the boat.|['1.

Neither of them would agree to let go of my prize. They wanted me to abandon it, then they'd grab me and take me in. We argued and drifted farther away until Captain Chris appeared, swimming like a shark. He swiftly stripped off his clothes and leaped in upon seeing the situation. With one hand under my right arm clutching the sea-feather, we swam back together to the boat. It felt like being towed by a tugboat. Captain Chris was the strongest swimmer I had ever seen. After a quick rubdown and change of clothes, I examined my prize. It was heavy due to a young rock attached to its root. The captain lamented that I had disturbed one of the most beautiful things in the garden. The piece of rock brought up with the sea-feather was adorned with shells, mosses, sea-weed, sponges, and sea-plants of various colors. While the sea-feather was too large for me to keep, I took a piece of the rock as a souvenir. The following day, we ventured to the caves with the Chippertons, but the lack of light prevented us from exploring further for pirate treasures. Corny, intrigued by tales of Blackbeard, wished she had brought a candle to uncover hidden riches.|"['1.

"In a cave filled with banyan-tree roots and trunks, we found treasures in the form of long ropes stretching from the cave's roof to the floor. These ropes were roots or young trunks from banyan-trees growing above, making the cave a unique underground forest. Excited, we gathered some of these ropes, some over twenty feet long, to keep as souvenirs. The banyan-trees, also known as wild fig-trees, were truly fascinating. The next day, we attended a service at a local church to hear a celebrated preacher. The people, though modestly dressed, were neat and devout. After a brief stay, we hurried to board the ""Tigris,"" which was leaving that evening.

"Once the pilot-boat departed, the ""Tigris"" swiftly set sail on its journey, while we wearily headed to our berths. The return trip was less pleasant than our initial voyage to the Bahamas. The following day was overcast, with rough seas and a brisk wind that made it uncomfortable on deck. Rectus quickly realized his mistake in wearing a wide straw hat and switched to a Scotch cap. Despite the challenging conditions, we had a more sociable time with the few passengers on board. As the wind intensified, the ship rolled from side to side, causing some passengers to feel uneasy.

The ship was in the midst of a storm, with wind blowing fiercely and waves crashing against the vessel. The captain, concerned for the safety of the passengers and the ship, decided to change course to face the storm head-on, which made the ship more stable. Despite the rough seas, the crew worked together to handle the situation. As the storm raged on, a fire broke out near the hatchway where freight and baggage were stored. The crew sprang into action, trying to contain the fire with hoses and equipment.

In a rush, I went to the Chippertons' cabin aboard the ship, knocking loudly on their door. As the steward attended to other passengers, I instructed Rectus to check the situation on deck and return. Grabbing life-preservers from our room, I emerged into the saloon, causing a stir among passengers. With the commotion escalating, I believed it wise to have the life-preservers ready. As everyone hurried to the deck, the seriousness of the situation became apparent as crew members prepared the lifeboats. Concerned, I ventured forward to witness the extent of the fire below deck. Returning to our group, I shared the captain's instructions, prompting us to head to the nearest lifeboat. Rectus reminded me to wear my life-preserver as we prepared for potential evacuation.|"['1.

When the boat was ready, there was a rush to get aboard. Most ladies were to board first, and some officers held back the men. Rectus, Corny, and I were among those held back. The boat was finally lowered into the water, and as it pitched and tossed, we could barely see through the thick smoke. Mr. Chipperton called for Corny, and we quickly secured her with a rope and lowered her into the boat. Mr. Chipperton instructed the men in the boat to row away. Despite the chaos, there was no panic, everyone focused on the task at hand - getting off the ship quickly. People were calm and knew what needed to be done.

I saw them moving away from the ship. The fire was now visible in front. The vessel seemed to have turned, rolling and smoke not coming back. Untying the line from Corny, I noticed only us three aft. Both boats were missed. Mr. Chipperton had helped his wife into one boat, intending to return for Corny. The life-raft, a large structure with air-tight cylinders and canvas, was launched. It floated safely, and we boarded. The raft was pushed off, floating away from the blazing ship. Crowded and uncomfortable on the raft, we held on as the waves swirled around us. Despite the discomfort, I felt safe knowing the captain and trustworthy crew were with us. The raft held fourteen, including ten crew members.|['1.

As we sat on the raft, watching our ship burn and drift away, the captain assured us that passing vessels in the Gulf Stream's path would spot our fire. Even though we couldn't see the other boats, the captain remained optimistic. Rectus stayed calm, trusting in the captain's reassurances. Corny, however, worried about her parents. Despite our efforts to comfort her, she remained anxious, her eyes scanning the waves. The captain sadly noted the ship's sinking, a heavy loss for him. The night grew darker, and the burning ship's departure left us feeling desolate. As morning approached, we felt the chill, hunger, and thirst set in. Corny eventually fell asleep, giving us a brief moment of relief amidst the turmoil of the sea.|"[""1.

As daylight finally appeared, we eagerly scanned the horizon. A distant top-sail caught our attention, but it was too far for our raft to be visible. Uncertain if it was approaching us, hope dwindled as we felt weak, cold, and hungry with no provisions aboard. Some crew members grumbled, regretting not setting off immediately after the fire to stock up on supplies. The captain, focused on spotting a passing vessel, remained silent. Among us was a red-faced, bearded sailor who surprised us with his complaints. As time passed, our optimism waned, wondering if any ships would ever come our way. Eventually, at noon, a sail reappeared, and a seasoned sailor on our raft astutely identified its type and direction, leaving us in awe of their keen eyesight.|"[""1.

We all came alive and prepared to signal for help. Luckily, the pole was on the raft, secured by the captain in advance. We used our wet but white handkerchiefs to create a flag. Tying them together, we made a long pennant and hoisted it on the pole. The flag fluttered as the sun shone brightly, drying us and making us more at ease. Despite the high waves, we spotted the ship approaching, though it seemed to veer off course due to the wind. The captain explained she had to tack. As the ship drew nearer, a man on board threw a life-preserver towards us, but it drifted away. Eventually, the ship turned back and sailed directly to us, offering hope for rescue.|['1.

On the raft, we heard a cry as the ship moved farther away. Some men seemed ready to swim after it, but then the vessel turned back. The men on board hauled us in, and I felt a mix of relief and exhaustion. The women on the ship took care of us, warming us up and giving us food. I was so grateful for their help. As I lay in the hammock, I drifted off to sleep. When I woke up, I felt safe and cared for. An officer, perhaps a doctor, brought me tea, soup, and bread.

After some time, our captain approached my hammock. He appeared much improved from the last time I saw him and mentioned he had a good rest. He reassured me that Corny was doing well and resting, under the care of the mate's wife. Rectus, in a nearby hammock, snored contentedly. The captain praised the kindness of the Russian crew, explaining that the bark's master had placed the vessel under his command to search for the missing boats. Despite twenty-four hours of searching, they had not located the boats but believed they were safe. Upon waking, I found my clothes dry and neatly pressed, with a package of money returned to us. The captain insisted we need not pay for our stay on the ship. We joined Corny on deck, where she appeared older and tearful but gradually brightened as we comforted her. Both captains were optimistic that the missing boats had either reached the Florida coast or been rescued.|"[""1.

"Around dusk that evening, we arrived at the entrance of the Savannah river and boarded a small boat to head towards the city, as our ship continued its journey. Fourteen grateful passengers descended from the Russian ship to the tugboat we had signaled. Some of us regretted not being able to speak Russian to express our gratitude more clearly. Upon reaching Savannah, we were warmly received at the hotel where we had stayed before. The news of the burning of the ""Tigris"" shocked everyone, and the government dispatched ships to search for survivors. Determined to take action, we decided to hire a tugboat to aid in the search. Despite doubts about its effectiveness, we were driven by the need to help and bring closure. Corny, a companion in distress, joined us in the quest. The tugboat, though modest, was deemed seaworthy, and we eagerly awaited the next morning to begin our search."|"['1.

We sailed down the Savannah River at a good pace, but I was relieved when we left it behind as I had grown weary of it. Our goal was to travel along the coast in search of any news about the missing boats. They might have landed in areas where the revenue cutters wouldn't have spotted them. Once at sea, the water was calm, although there was a gentle swell. The captain mentioned he wouldn't have ventured out if the seas were rough, which worried me as he might abandon the search at the slightest sign of a storm. As we headed towards smoother waters by midday, with land in sight on the ocean side, I questioned the captain. He explained we were taking the inside passage, sheltered by islands that line the Georgia coast, offering a safer route for smaller vessels. Despite my objections, the captain was convinced this was the best course of action to potentially hear news of the missing boats.|"[""1.

"""No, it isn't a trick,"" he replied, quite warmly. ""They explained everything to me. They knew, and I knew, that there was no point in searching for two boats that had been put out during a severe storm four days ago, way down on the Florida coast. But they could see that this girl wouldn't give up until she had the chance to do what she felt she had to do, so they agreed to let her. But they warned me not to keep her out for more than twenty-four hours. That would be enough to satisfy her, and any longer wouldn't be right. They really know what they're doing.""

""Well, it won't be enough to satisfy her,"" I said, and then I went down to the lower deck. I couldn't convince the man to turn back. I had thought the tug was hired to go wherever we wanted, but I was mistaken. I felt like we had been tricked, but there was no point in discussing it until we got to the city.

I didn't wake Rectus to share the news. It wouldn't help, and I was worried Corny might overhear. I wanted her to sleep as long as possible, and I dreaded the moment she would wake and realize everything was over.

We sailed swiftly now. There were no stops. I sat on the deck, reflecting and dozing a bit. By morning, we were in the Savannah River. I loathed this river more than ever.

The tide was high as the tug approached the wharf. Just then, a man caught a fish and leaped off the post, revealing himself as Mr. Chipperton. Corny swiftly bounded off the tug onto the wharf, embracing her father joyfully. Rectus and I, on the tug, couldn't help but laugh and cry with happiness. Mr. Chipperton, in his peculiar outfit, held his daughter tightly with one arm and the fishing pole with the other, as the fish dangled in the air. Amidst the emotional reunion, a boy unhooked the fish, breaking the moment. We rushed on shore, overjoyed to see them. The Chippertons had a harrowing journey, but were finally reunited thanks to a vessel bound for Florida Keys and a steamer to Savannah.

When I explained this to Uncle Chipperton, he quickly dismissed it as nonsense, insisting that the trip should not cost me a penny. He argued that the joy of the journey outweighed any financial concerns and assured me he would take care of all expenses. Despite his kindness, I knew he didn't owe me anything, as any help I had given him was without charge. Even if I had considered accepting his offer, my father would never agree. Politely declining his offer to lend me money, I packed my bag for the trip. Rectus, who was also preparing, mentioned his father had arranged for him to access funds from a Savannah bank.

"""Yes,"" he agreed. ""Why not? I got new clothes yesterday, and my wife and Corny are ready for the trip. We can leave easily, even in my green pants if needed.

I thought I'd meet them in Willisville, but they came to New York to meet the Chippertons. It was a great decision. The Chippertons fit right in.

After lunch, we gathered in a parlor for a family meeting. We chatted for hours, discussing our plans. I was set to start college in the fall, a decision made long ago. Despite looking ready for the challenge, my parents wanted some quality time with me before I dived into studies. Corny's schooling was a topic of debate; Uncle Chipperton favored a school near him, while Mrs. Colbert believed she needed space to focus. The conversation then shifted to Sammy, Mr. Colbert's son, who was to join the family business. I shared my thoughts on Sammy's newfound interest in education after his travels.

Uncle Chipperton was very upset when he learned that an injustice was still ongoing. To distract from the tension, everyone started chatting about various topics and agreed to meet again the next day. Father decided to stay in the city for a few days, and Uncle Chipperton planned to delay his trip to his country home until the weather improved. As they discussed future activities, Uncle Chipperton suddenly suggested hosting a dinner for the group the following evening. Despite objections, he insisted on arranging the dinner at a restaurant in the city. The next day was busy as they replaced lost items from a recent trip. Uncle Chipperton, eager for the dinner, involved the narrator in planning the seating arrangements. However, just before the dinner, Uncle Chipperton decided not to attend to avoid potential conflicts, ensuring a harmonious gathering.|"['1.

Uncle Chipperton wanted a happy family dinner without any clouds of suspicion. Despite disliking the dinner plan, I couldn't stop it since it was his affair. My father also disliked the situation and found it unwarranted. He didn't want to take another man's place at the head of the table. I visited Corny and her mother at their hotel, where they felt sad about the plan. To keep the mood light, I avoided telling Rectus about it. I arrived early at the restaurant to check everything for the dinner. The table was beautifully set with each guest's name on a card. Everyone was late, including my father, making me nervous as I waited.|"[""1.

The restaurant's head waiter checked if my friends knew the dinner time. Delay would spoil the meal. I assured him they were aware but late. Puzzled, I searched the place and street, finding no sign. I pondered, suspecting my father avoided a potential quarrel by staying at the hotel. Others likely hesitated due to Uncle Chipperton's absence. I sat at the table, the only one present, and began the meal. The head waiter, amused, saw the empty seats and burst into laughter. The scene was comical, and we all chuckled.|"[""1.
