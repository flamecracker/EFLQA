But he was a boy who usually clung tenaciously to an idea. Sitting down, he focused on the plan he had made. Eventually, a possible solution came to him.

He remembered his bravery on that dark night, perfect for his mission. The trembling stopped, replaced by hope. Kneeling on the stone ledge, he clutched his makeshift rope tightly and descended from the window. It took immense effort to prevent himself from falling, the rope scorching his palms.

Ned quickly left the shop behind, wearing a thick serape and a sombrero, blending in with the Mexican culture. Despite having little money left, he aimed to find work beyond the city. Walking towards La Viga, a canal leading to the lakes, he sought passage on a boat. Passing through the city, he encountered officers but kept a low profile. Approaching the palace, he spotted General Martin Perfecto de Cos, whom he distrusted. Finally, at the canal, Ned offered to help row a boat down to Lake Xochimilco, securing a place among a family onboard.

Ned boarded the boat, grateful for his rowing skills during this crucial moment. He realized his hosts, a humble peon family, were heading back home after selling vegetables and flowers in the city. With Igarritos, they rowed as the boys slept. Juana, the wife, covered them with a serape and sat quietly. She noticed Ned's Mexican attire but sensed he was not entirely Mexican. Despite her curiosity, she remained silent. Ned, feeling the weight of his situation, respected her silence. As they rowed down the canal, they were stopped by an officer and soldiers.

Ned rowed with newfound strength, feeling relieved as the night lightened. Mexico's landscape, filled with thorny plants, passed by as they navigated the canal. The distant mountains loomed in the gray light. Passing other boats, they reached Xochimilco at dawn. The serene morning inspired them, contrasting the bustling city. After a hearty breakfast, Benito and his family offered Ned work in the spiky fields. Despite the soreness and rough food, Ned cherished his freedom under the open sky.

"The President, protector of all, the great General Santa Anna, is growing angrier at the Texans, the wild Americans who have ventured into the far North wilderness,"" he said. ""They speak of an upcoming army against them and of a bold escape."" One Texan, held by Santa Anna, a fierce boy who slipped through his window bars, has escaped. They want him back urgently for reasons beyond Benito's understanding. Ned, with elder boy Carlos, fished until twilight, returning to a serene scene where Juana prepared food.

Ned firmly declined the gifts, offering his last dollar for a sturdy knife. Reluctantly, Benito accepted the dollar and gave him the knife. Ned, despite the sudden change in plans, promised to follow the advice. Juana provided him with a bag of food, which he secured under his serape. With a midnight blessing, he set off, waving goodbye to the kind couple who had helped him. Walking along the lake and then veering east, he felt courageous and hopeful, armed with the knife. Ned navigated the rough terrain, crossing a dangerous lava field with caution. Resting in a cypress forest, he observed the city below, feeling a sense of duty to warn his fellow Texans.

Ned, armed with a machete, found himself pursued by a pack of dogs. With quick thinking, he defended himself atop a rock formation. As the dogs closed in, he struck down the leader with a single blow, causing the rest to flee in fear. Continuing his journey cautiously, Ned sought refuge in a thicket of cacti to rest.

Looking eastward, Ned saw hills and a small mountain in the arid, volcanic landscape. The basalt, evidence of ancient races, was visible everywhere. Despite the desolation, Ned felt the weight of history in Mexico. He journeyed through the desert, confident in his course. With limited food, Ned pressed on, passing soldiers on the road to Vera Cruz. Approaching the Teotihuacan River, he spotted the Cerro Gordo mountain and two pyramids, the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon, ancient monuments rising in solitude. Overwhelmed by the eerie surroundings, Ned battled his fears, venturing towards the Pyramid of the Sun, defying superstitions and embracing the solitude of the mysterious land.|['1.

As the sun set, Ned bravely approached the ancient ruins, feeling his superstitious fears fade. Among the stone fragments and ancient walls, he noticed traces of ancient streets and a massive earthwork enclosing a square with small pyramids. Tumuli and a causeway leading to the Pyramid of the Moon added to the mysterious atmosphere. Alone with the majestic remains, Ned heard voices and saw Mexican soldiers setting up camp.

Ned slowly climbed the pyramid, hearing the soldiers' chatter below. He saw fires and relaxed soldiers near the pyramid but noticed vigilant sentinels. As he ascended, he found a dark opening but hesitated, wary of hidden dangers. Reaching a safe platform covered in vegetation, he felt relieved. Looking down, he saw fires burning and heard music, creating a peaceful atmosphere. Despite the pleasant surroundings, Ned remained cautious, knowing the potential danger from the Mexican soldiers. He settled in a safe spot on the pyramid, clearing the area of vegetation to avoid unwelcome guests.

He dozed off to the pleasant mandolin music and woke up to a dazzling sun. Blinking to adjust to the bright Mexican sky, he realized it was late morning. Expecting the Mexicans to have left, he was dismayed to hear their presence below. With the sun scorching, he craved water, especially after spotting the Teotihuacan river nearby. Despite the tormenting view of the river, he tried to focus on other thoughts. The relentless sun made him long for shade and water. Refusing to give in to his thirst, he fought the temptation of the river’s sight. The day dragged on with the heat intensifying, and Ned's frustration grew as the Mexicans showed no signs of leaving.

He returned to his small hiding spot among the bushes and prayed for the comforting arrival of night. He feared that the soldiers would linger for days, making his situation akin to a sailor stranded without water. With no other choice, he planned to sneak away under the cover of darkness. As the sun set, the scorching heat faded, bringing relief. Night fell, cooling the surroundings, and the stars appeared in the dark sky.

Ned sat for a while, feeling rejuvenated as he ate the food provided by Benito and Juana. He expressed gratitude and caressed the palm leaves gently waving in the wind. Observing Teotihuacan from the pyramid's edge, he felt a sense of defiance towards it. Ned considered the pyramid his home, familiar with every inch of its crowning platform. Despite hunger and thirst being satisfied, he decided to stay put, knowing escaping through the Mexican lines was futile. As dawn approached on his second night, Ned saw the soldiers still asleep, feeling a connection to the ancient city's history. He cut another gash in the water palm for a drink, realizing its limited supply. Ned remained courageous, awaiting unforeseen events.

Ned noticed the leader of the new group, General Martin Perfecto de Cos, Santa Anna's brother-in-law. Ned recognized him as a cruel man tasked with defeating the Texans. Mexican troops kept arriving, confirming Ned's suspicions. The camp organized, guitars silenced, and General de Cos's domineering presence was clear. As night fell, Ned went to the palm tree for water, but the flow weakened. Despite his thirst, Ned conserved water, knowing he must. The next night, he cut the palm again, noticing its decline. Upset and restless, Ned's nerves were frayed. The following day, he barely got a few sips of water, forcing him to be extra cautious.

The boy sat quietly throughout the day, fixated on the palm tree. Ignoring the sounds below, he was certain the Mexicans would not leave. At times, he fell into a fevered stupor, only to awaken to the night. Thirsty, he quickly cut the tree for water, knowing it would wither. Ned, a mix of amazement and despair, understood this fate. With no water and the Mexican camp lingering, he had to act. As darkness fell, a glimmer of hope emerged with the dark clouds. Despite the land's dry nature, he hoped to find water. Realizing his chances were slim, he decided to descend under the cover of night. Gathering his courage, he prepared to face the eerie ruins and the looming threat of thirst.|['1.

He pulled the large hat low over his eyes, considering his options. Fluent in Spanish and its Mexican dialects, he hoped to pass as a local. Determined, he descended the pyramid carefully in the rain, observing the campfires flickering wildly. Spotting sentinels, including the one guarding Martin Perfecto de Cos, he planned to stay in the pyramid's shadow. Despite the cold rain, he felt invigorated, ready to slip past the sentinels to quench his thirst at a pile of canteens. He grabbed one, but it was empty. Eyeing the vigilant sentinel, he waited for an opportunity to move forward.|"['1. What language is the character fluent in?\nA) French\nB) Spanish\nC) Italian\nD) German\nE) Portuguese', '2.

Ned was determined to find water in the desert. After searching through several empty canteens, he finally discovered one with water. Despite the mud at the bottom, he drank eagerly, feeling revitalized. He filled another canteen and hung it across his shoulder, knowing its value in the dry lands ahead. On his way back, Ned slipped on a stone, alerting the sentinels who mistook him for an intruder. Dodging their bullets, he reached the safety of the pyramid.

He decided to climb back up the pyramid, carrying a canteen of water. As he ascended, he encountered a Mexican soldier with a lantern. In a moment of panic, he struck the soldier, causing him to fall but not get seriously hurt. Hearing more people approaching, he grabbed the lantern and found a hidden opening in the pyramid to escape. Descending into darkness, he cautiously used the lantern to navigate the narrow stone steps. Despite the eerie feeling of being in a tomb, Ned pressed on, driven by the urgency of his situation. The cold stone walls and ancient atmosphere gave him a sense of the deep history of Egypt. Though normally filled with superstitious fear, Ned focused on his escape, descending step by step.|"['1.

The air in the pyramid was pure, reminiscent of great caves in the States. Ned discovered a deep square well, its walls lined with stones. The lantern revealed no water, giving the impression of a ceremonial or sacrificial purpose. Despite a narrow path around the well, Ned chose not to proceed further, settling on the steps for safety. The sense of ancient history surrounded him, yet he felt relief from his recent escape. Ned rested, using his serape as a makeshift bed. Upon waking, he drank from his canteen and ate, indifferent to the time of day. Tempted to check the camp, he resisted, focusing on conserving the lantern's oil. As night fell, he observed lights below but stayed put. After hours of waiting, Ned finally ventured back to the entrance.|"['1. What did Ned discover inside the pyramid?\nA. A hidden tunnel\nB.

Ned looked out and saw an empty scene, the army had disappeared, leaving behind only remnants of their camp. He extinguished his lantern, grateful for its help, and climbed to the pyramid's summit to survey the valley. Finding no signs of life, he descended, enjoying the fresh air. He bathed in the Teotihuacan waters, then resumed his journey, paralleling the army's path towards Vera Cruz. Lost in the mountains, he encountered a fierce storm on a sandy plain. Seeking refuge in a hut, he fell ill after eating wild fruits. Overwhelmed by despair, weakened and far from his destination, he succumbed to unconsciousness, unable to continue his mission.|"['1.

When Ned regained consciousness, he found himself surrounded by men, initially mistaking them for his fellow Texans. However, as his mind cleared, he realized they were Mexican soldiers. Despite his weakness, lying on the ground covered by a serape, he felt no strong emotions. Gradually, his strength returned, and he noticed the soldiers, about two hundred lancers, in a valley with their horses nearby. They treated him decently, offering him a meal of beans and chopped meat. As he ate, he revealed his nationality, which was already apparent to them. An officer, the troop's commander, approached with a friendly smile, signaling a new chapter in Ned's unexpected journey.|"['1.

"""We march in an hour,"" Almonte informed Ned. They were heading to meet General Cos on the Vera Cruz road, a journey that would take two to three days. Due to the rough terrain, Almonte suggested Ned ride a burro instead of a horse. Despite the lack of horses, the burro proved reliable and comfortable on the basalt and lava paths. Ned, grateful for Almonte's kindness, enjoyed the cheerful Mexican's company. As they rode, Ned absorbed the joyous atmosphere of the lancers singing Spanish and Indian songs. Despite the pleasant ride, Ned remained vigilant, knowing he carried a crucial message to his people. The landscape, ancient and mysterious, revealed hidden ruins and peons working the land. The troop's slow progress led them to camp in a mountain depression by nightfall, where a warm fire of giant cactus stems provided comfort against the chilly wind.

Ned was mesmerized by the image of the dashing young officer playing his guitar with passion, embodying both a musician and a vigilant soldier. The setting was filled with an air of adventure and romance, making Ned momentarily forget his own mission to reach the Texans. Despite the biting cold on the heights, he found warmth by the fire under the serapes. As they journeyed towards Vera Cruz at dawn, Ned's keen observation skills were put to use, taking in the majestic sights of the Mexican landscape, including the towering mountain peaks. Colonel Almonte expressed his deep love for Mexico's natural beauty and his determination to protect it from Texan secession.

A grand tent stood tall for General Cos, who dined outside it while a chef served him fine meals and a servant poured red wine. His stern face darkened at Ned's presence, yet he greeted Almonte politely. Almonte, highly regarded in the Mexican army due to his family and skills, reported the recapture of a Texan who fled prison. General Cos, Santa Anna's powerful brother-in-law, displayed a sinister smile upon hearing the news. He interrogated Ned in Spanish, questioning his escape from the capital.

As night fell, Orizaba's majestic peak shone in the distance, offering Ned a sense of peace. The next morning, Ned marched with the Tlascalans, struggling on foot without his burro.

They stopped for an hour at noon, and Ned had some simple food and water with the Tlascalans. Grateful for the brief break, he tried to regain his strength. Almonte approached him with a flask of wine, which Ned drank to revive himself. The color returned to his face, and he felt rejuvenated. Almonte shared that General Cos didn't want Ned around but would try to help him. Despite the rest, the march continued under tough conditions, leaving Ned exhausted.

"The expression on Santa Anna's face changed suddenly, causing a stir. His eyes filled with anger, and he appeared threatening. General Cos instinctively reached for his sword, but Santa Anna motioned him to sit back down. Santa Anna's demeanor shifted once more, becoming serious but not menacing. ""Easy, Cos,"" he said. ""Remember, he is just a boy who doesn't comprehend. He may have turned away from a bright future, but he still has your hospitality to rely on."" Cos chuckled, followed by Santa Anna. Though their laughs differed in tone, they had the same chilling effect on Ned. The next morning, Santa Anna departed with his entourage for the capital, while General Cos headed to Vera Cruz. Ned, feeling neglected by Cos, journeyed on foot with the Tlascalans. As they reached the tropical lowlands of Vera Cruz, the oppressive heat and unfamiliar surroundings weighed heavily on Ned.

Ned was swiftly processed by the governor, then escorted by two guards down a narrow, damp stairway to a cell with iron doors. Locked in, he found himself in a small, grim room with a high cement ceiling and a hole for air. The place was desolate and eerie, unlike anything he had experienced before. The solitude weighed heavily on him, and he fought back tears, feeling utterly defeated. The chill in the air was initially refreshing but soon turned cold. Exhausted, he tried to rest on a meager blanket, slipping in and out of a troubled slumber. Suddenly, a faint, steady sound caught his attention.

After a period of fear, the boy observed a hole in the ceiling providing fresh air. However, it was too small for him to escape. When a soldier brought food and water, Ned tried to converse but received only brief responses. Alone again, he attempted to shake the door and call out to neighboring cells, but no sound returned. Determined to find a way out, he paced his cell until he grew dizzy. Despite his efforts, sleep eluded him. When the soldiers returned with another meal, Ned remained silent, refusing to ask questions.

The following day, Ned had a fever, the day after he felt worse, and by the third day, he became unconscious. He experienced a peculiar time, filled with a mix of vibrant and fleeting scenes. The moments he lived through seemed to repeat in a disorderly manner, taking him back to encounters he had already faced. From vivid memories with Mr. Austin to adventures in Texas with Comanche and buffalo, his life felt like a jumble in a kaleidoscope. As his mind swirled with colors and actions, he eventually drifted into darkness and silence. When he emerged, weak and disoriented, he realized he was back in the dungeon under the sea. His body felt frail, and as he observed his hand, it appeared ghostly and unfamiliar. Upon confirming it was indeed his hand, he noticed his hair was cut short and thin.|"['Question 1: What symptoms did Ned experience on the second day?\nA) Fever\nB) Unconsciousness\nC) Weakness\nD) Disorientation\nE) Short hair', ""Question 2: Where did Ned find himself when he regained consciousness?\nA) Mr. Austin's house\nB) Texas\nC) Under the sea\nD) In a dungeon\nE) In a hospital"", 'Question 3: How did Ned feel when he first woke up in the dungeon?\nA) Strong and energetic\nB) Confused and disoriented\nC) Excited and happy\nD) Calm and relaxed\nE) Anxious and scared', 'Question 4: What did Ned observe about his hand when he woke up?\nA) It was missing\nB) It was ghostly and unfamiliar\nC) It was injured\nD) It was holding something\nE) It was normal', 'Question 5: What did Ned notice about his hair when he woke up?\nA) It was long and thick\nB) It was cut short and thin\nC) It was dyed a different color\nD) It was styled differently\nE) It was missing', 'Question 6: How did Ned describe his experiences during his unconscious state?\nA) Clear and organized\nB) Disordered and repetitive\nC) Dark and silent\nD) Colorful and vibrant\nE) Quiet and peaceful']"|['A) Fever', 'D) In a dungeon', 'B) Confused and disoriented', 'B) It was ghostly and unfamiliar', 'B) It was cut short and thin', 'D) Colorful and vibrant']
He realized he had been very ill to feel so weak. Wondering how long he had been unconscious, he focused on the sound of the sea, confirming he was still in the Castle of San Juan de Ulua. When a man brought him soup, Ned ate eagerly, feeling stronger. He decided to hide his recovery to plan an escape. The soup calmed him, clearing his mind. He knew his captors didn't want him dead, evidenced by his care. Later, a tall man entered his cell, locking the door behind him. Ned observed the man's tall, thin figure and fiery red hair, realizing he was not Mexican but of his own race.|"['1.

Ned was sent to the castle by Santa Anna and Cos because he suspected their motives. Despite the decent treatment, Ned doubted Santa Anna's intentions and believed he aimed to crush the Texans. Escaping, he planned to warn Texas. Obed White offered partnership to help Ned escape, forming the firm of White & Fulton, aiming to dig tunnels or engineer submarines.

Ned eagerly devoured his breakfast the next day, still craving more. Despite feeling hungry after dinner, he pretended to be weak as part of his plan. He repeated this act during supper, all while anticipating the senior member of White & Fulton to call him. When the senior partner finally arrived, he remarked on Ned's apparent improvement and strong pulse. The partner's lively conversation lifted Ned's spirits, making him feel strong enough to attempt an escape. However, Obed advised against it, cautioning Ned that his current strength was merely temporary.

Ned knew he was right, but despite his youth and strength, his recovery was slow after a harrowing experience. He tested his strength often, but always found himself lacking. Obed White, his companion, wisely advised patience, hinting at an approaching storm that could aid their escape. They planned to disguise themselves as Mexicans to flee the island prison. Waiting for the guard's nightly visit, they prepared for their daring escape. Ned and Obed remained silent, ready to overpower the guard and seize their chance for freedom. The sound of the sea outside contrasted with the absolute silence within the cell.

He didn't usually hear the soldier's key turning in the lock, but this time he did, and his heart raced. Glancing at White, the gray figure against the wall remained still. The door swung open, and the soldier, carrying a tray, entered. Behind him, another man with a musket followed. In an instant, strong arms grabbed the second man and pulled him into the cell. The door closed, and the grip shifted to his throat. The man with the tray heard the commotion and turned. Ned pounced on the soldier, knocking him down. White assured the soldier they meant no harm. Ned tied their arms with a red handkerchief. They took the pistol and gathered ammunition, preparing for their escape from the Castle of San Juan de Ulua.|['1.

Ned and Obed, disguised in the soldiers' clothing, prepared for their daring escape. They seized the men's weapons and secured the key to unlock the door, leaving the Mexicans locked in the cell. Moving cautiously through the dimly lit corridor, they approached a large room with sparse furniture and old uniforms. Obed, skilled in lockpicking, attempted to open the door quietly as Ned stood ready with a pistol. With bated breath, they pushed the door open slightly, revealing a barracks with two windows and an exit. The room was empty, but their escape was far from over. The fate of the Texans hung in the balance as they ventured further into the unknown territory of San Juan de Ulua.|"[""1.

Ned gazed out of the window and saw a sky full of moving clouds under a whistling wind. It was the most beautiful sight he had ever seen after being trapped under the sea. Determined to reach freedom, he beckoned to White, and they entered a room with a Spanish-style décor. They encountered an officer, but Obed quickly took charge, aiming his musket at the officer, who remained calm. Obed and Ned searched the desk for a pass, planning their escape.

Two guards stood at the entrance, and Ned handed them their passes. The guards quickly checked the signatures, opened the gate, and just like that, Ned and his companion found themselves outside the imposing walls of the San Juan de Ulua castle. The night was dark, allowing them only a glimpse of the stone they stood on and the turbulent sea ahead. The castle loomed behind them, a massive and solemn structure. A strong wind blew in from the gulf, howling and whistling around the walls. The bitter rain pelted them, but despite the harsh conditions, their spirits remained high. They knew they faced a daunting challenge - a fierce wind and a half-mile of rough waters separated them from safety. Determined, they hurried along the edge, braving the elements. Hearing the alarm from the castle, they spotted a small boat. With no time to lose, they untied it, jumped in, and rowed away as musket shots rang out.

Many torches lit up the wharf near the castle, with men shouting. The small boat rocked in the sea as shots were fired, missing their mark. Obed suggested heading for the land below the town to escape pursuit. Suddenly, the sound of a cannon from San Juan de Ulua signaled danger. Despite the threat, they continued rowing southward, evading large boats chasing them. When a pursuing boat approached, Obed fired a shot, causing confusion and buying them time. As they rowed on, the night's darkness shielded them from further pursuit. Guided by the wind, they reached the shore undetected, deciding to abandon the boat and disappear into the sandy land.|['1.

The high wave lifted them and carried them swiftly to shore. They landed on a sandy beach, the boat hitting the sand. They jumped out, taking an unloaded musket, and ran. The receding water tugged at them but couldn't pull them back. Exhausted, they collapsed on the ground. The alarm gun sounded from San Juan de Ulua, signaling they couldn't stay. In the dark, they walked through sand dunes, knowing a search would be conducted. They found dry grass, made a bed, and fell asleep. The night passed, and the day dawned.

Two men, Ned and Obed, awoke in a field near a castle, dreaming of the sea. They overheard peons nearby singing a song of love and sacrifice. Deciding to leave, they admired the fortress of San Juan de Ulua before heading north. Hungry, they approached a hut, pretending to be poor Spaniards heading to Mexico City. They traded their musket for food and serapes, using their loaded pistols to inspire fear. Their goal was to reach the mountains, guided by the silver cone of Orizaba. As night fell, they planned to continue their journey, fueled by the necessity of survival.|"['1.

The Mexican man, along with his wife and seven children, observed the strangers with suspicion, resembling wild animals. He falsely claimed that two Texan prisoners had drowned in the bay after escaping. Obed corrected him, stating the escapees had different descriptions. The Mexican agreed to a deal, exchanging a musket for food and serapes. Obed warned the man that their pistols were loaded, ready for danger in the hills. The Mexican, content with the trade, did not want trouble and kept silent. Obed and his companion continued walking after sunset, wary of brigands.

Ned and Obed woke at dawn after a dreamless night. They discovered a pool on the hill's far side for a refreshing bath before breakfast, feeling stronger than ever. Packed with food for two days, they also counted on wild fruits and possible supplies from locals. Despite the dense vegetation, they were armed and determined to reach Texas. As they ventured into the tierra caliente's lush landscape, Ned marveled at the grandeur. The towering trees, lianas, and vibrant blooms surrounded them. They navigated narrow paths due to the dense foliage and encountered various plant species like mahogany and cacti. The journey led them through clearings where they found tropical fruits and received corn-based food from villagers. Tropical rains and scorching heat tested their resilience, but they pressed on, wary of jungle creatures.

Ned and Obed lay flat on the ground as a second ocelot appeared. The wind was in their favor, concealing them from the fierce creature. From afar, the ocelot seemed massive, resembling a tiger as it hunted its prey. Both boys dreaded encountering it, even armed. Suddenly, the ocelot sprinted up a tree and vanished into the foliage, likely having caught its meal. Ned expressed his unease with the jungle's vastness and hidden dangers. Lost the next day, they stumbled upon a cold creek, offering relief from the jungle's heat. They rested on grassy banks, the soothing sound of the stream invoking thoughts of the northern lands. Obed assured they would soon reach a safer zone, easing Ned's apprehension. As they dozed off, a distant growl interrupted the night, causing Ned a brief scare until he remembered his trusty pistol.|"['1.

The sounds grew louder, like a repeated p-u, p-u, p-u. Ned, feeling an indescribable fear, summoned his courage. With a pistol in hand, he cautiously moved along the stream's edge. Suddenly, a massive black beast emerged from the jungle, standing before him with a menacing presence. Its red eyes, sharp fangs, and powerful physique left Ned frozen in terror. Summoning his last ounce of strength, he fired at the beast, but it leaped towards him. In the nick of time, Obed fired another shot, saving Ned. The creature fell lifeless, revealing a wound from each bullet. As Ned regained his composure, Obed explained that it was a black jaguar, a rare and dangerous predator. The encounter left Ned shaken but grateful for his friend's swift action.|"['1.

Ned felt a chill run down his spine once more. The sight of the majestic black jaguar, even in death, filled him with fear. Its strength was both magnificent and ominous, heavier and mightier than a tiger. Obed expressed his desire to have the jaguar's skin as a trophy for his future grand home. With their pistols empty and no ammunition left, they decided to stick together closely in the jungle. Fearful of the jaguar's potential mate seeking revenge, they found refuge on a small island in the river. Ned was roused by a distant pu-pu-pu sound, likely the mourning call of the jaguar's mate.

Obed and Ned were walking through a remote region near the high sierras when they were suddenly ambushed by a group of brigands led by Captain Juan Carossa. The brigands demanded tribute, but Obed and Ned had nothing to offer. The brigands searched them thoroughly but found nothing of value. Disappointed, Captain Carossa expressed his frustration at the wasted effort. Despite the tense situation, Ned and Obed remained calm and cooperative. The brigands eventually let them go, realizing they had nothing to gain from the encounter.

"""It's not our fault,"" he stated. ""We had some money, but we spent it on food. We also had arms, but they too went for food. So, you see, Captain Carossa, we have nothing left for you.""
""But you have two good serapes,"" the Captain remarked. ""If you had money, we wouldn't take them. Captain Carossa and his men must not leave empty-handed. I hope you don't find me unreasonable.""
""We can't easily give up these cloaks,"" he replied. ""But since we must, we can't stop it. We request your hospitality. The mountain nights are cold. Without our cloaks, we'd freeze. Take us with you, and tomorrow in the warm sun, we'll continue.""
Carossa chuckled. ""You have spirit, Santiago,"" he said. ""You may come with us, but tomorrow you leave without your cloaks. My men must be paid. You may be a Gringo, but that doesn't matter. I yield to your request because you won't betray us to Santa Anna's soldiers.""
Obed While smiled, acknowledging Carossa's craft and courage. The brigand captain held firm on taking their serapes and coats but showed them respect first. They walked through the forest, following a man with a red serape carrying a lantern. They arrived at a group of ancient stone buildings in a rectangular layout under the moonlight."|"['1.

"Captain Carossa gestured dramatically towards the grand building, ""My home! The quarters of myself and my men,"" he declared, his pride evident. The building's origins remained a mystery, existing long before Cortez's time, now serving as their refuge. The peon feared the place, shunning it due to Carossa's presence and rumored ghosts. With a lantern in hand, Carossa led the way through a narrow passageway into the grand structure. Inside, Ned and Obed marveled at the massive doorway made of colossal stones, a testament to ancient craftsmanship.

The whispers among the men grew louder. Carossa conversed with one of them who retrieved a stone jar from a hidden spot. Tin cups appeared, and everyone, including Carossa, sipped pulque made from the maguey plant. They offered it to Ned and Obed, but both refused. The pulque didn't make the men more argumentative but seemed to lull them into drowsiness. Some hummed sad tunes, reminiscent of homes they couldn't return to. One man wept before lying down on his serape to sleep. Others followed suit. Two guards near the massive doorway with muskets seemed to doze off. Ned wrapped himself in his serape, observing Obed about eight feet away. The wind rose, creating eerie sounds in the ruins. Ned was relieved not to be alone. The coals faded, leaving only ash. Ned, wide awake, noticed the guards asleep and was startled to see Obed rising. They exchanged glances, stood up simultaneously, and understood each other without words.|['1.

Obed and Ned quietly approached a pillar where the brigands had left their guns unguarded. They seized two American rifles, along with ammunition and machetes. Feeling empowered by the rifles, they believed they could overcome the brigands. Obed led Ned through a narrow passage to an outdoor courtyard surrounded by ruins. Grateful for their escape, they also took food supplies and began their journey northward under the moon and stars. Passing through the central plateau of Mexico, they anticipated a change in the landscape to a drier region with unique flora. After finding water, they rested in a thicket, confident in their ability to evade pursuit. Upon waking, they found themselves undisturbed, ready to continue their journey.|['1.

As they journeyed across the open plain under the scorching sun, Ned and Obed trekked steadily, relying on their rifles for protection. The landscape was a dusty gray expanse, a stark contrast to the lush forests they had left behind. In the distance, majestic mountains loomed, cloaked in greenery that stirred a longing for the shade of the woods. Obed and Ned shared a moment of camaraderie, reflecting on the fleeting nature of desires. Despite facing challenges like tropical storms and river crossings, they pressed on, their Spanish knowledge and rifles offering a shield in unfamiliar territories. The encounter with a jaguar led to a barter in a humble village, where they observed the simple joys of the local people.

Ned and Obed journeyed across harsh plains, enduring extreme weather. A Norther storm almost claimed them, but their serapes offered protection. Resting by a brook, they replenished their water and continued through desolate landscapes. The moonlit nights held an eerie beauty, with sand swirling in the wind. Wolves' mournful howls echoed, but they avoided the travelers. Spotting sheep herders, Ned and Obed sought human contact but were left alone. Obed's hunting skills provided fresh food, and they rested, preparing for a dry stretch ahead. Passing through barren lands, they reached a river, relishing a bath and a feast.

Ned and Obed were resting by the river, enjoying the cool night. Suddenly, Ned spotted a cougar approaching their deer, hanging from a tree. The cougar tried to leap for the deer but failed each time, much to the amusement of the boys. Despite the cougar's efforts, he couldn't reach the deer due to the clever way it was tied. Eventually, the cougar gave up and left, exhausted and embarrassed. The boys slept peacefully, and the cougar returned in the morning but was scared off by their scent.

The vast cactus forest stretched for miles, with towering stems rising over sixty feet high. These stems, sometimes branching out, were lined with ribs and thick yellow buds that sprouted spines. The greenery and colorful flowers provided relief to the travelers who had journeyed from the scorching desert. Despite the lack of shade or water, they encountered friendly indigenous people gathering fruit. Communicating through gestures, they shared food and received guidance towards Texas. As they traversed mountains and evaded detection, they encountered Mexican cavalry approaching, likely part of General Cos's army.

A shout erupted from the lancers in the cornfield when they spotted the two running. Ned likened his feelings to that of a fox fleeing hounds. Despite the tremors, Ned's mental training kicked in, bolstering his willpower as he and Obed sprinted purposefully. Seeking rough terrain and thick forests to evade the thundering lancers behind them, they strategized to conserve bullets for when truly needed. Dodging through thorn bushes that horses couldn't navigate, they aimed to outpace their pursuers. As they emerged onto rugged ground, both panting and sweating, the pursuit's noise expanded. Suddenly, two lancers charged at them. Obed swiftly dodged, while Ned, momentarily frozen, witnessed a fatal shot from Obed's rifle. Reacting, Ned fired at the second lancer, who fled wounded.

Ned and Obed, now hunters instead of the hunted, hid in the bushes as Mexican soldiers searched for them. Obed calmed Ned, waiting for the soldiers to tire.

Two Texans found themselves cornered by a group of Mexicans in the wilderness. Seeking refuge in a hollow at the base of a mountain, they fortified their position with a fallen oak log. As they waited for the enemy's approach, tension filled the air. Suddenly, a massive rock hurled from above narrowly missed them, a treacherous attack by the Mexicans. The Texans, Obed and Ned, stood their ground, ready to defend their makeshift fort. The enemy's attempt to dislodge them failed, but the threat lingered. As the hours passed, silence enveloped the forest, heightening the suspense. The Texans braced themselves for the next move, knowing that the standoff was far from over.|"['1.

Ned and Obed, lying in wait, were surprised by the bombardment of heavy rocks. The first stone landed in front of them, providing an unexpected advantage as a protective barrier. As more rocks fell, they strategically used them to fortify their position against potential attackers.

Encouraged by the besieged's silence, the Mexicans advanced closer, growing careless. Ned spotted one behind a bush, fired, and the man fell. Watching the bush stir, Ned hoped the man survived. The Mexican fire ceased, leaving a quiet in the woods. Wisps of smoke drifted among the trees, carried away by the wind. Ned and Obed chatted optimistically, speculating the Mexicans might try to starve them out. Suddenly, a shot grazed Ned's cap, forcing them to take cover. Realizing a Mexican had climbed a tree for a vantage point, Obed strategized to stay low until the next shot. When the Mexican fired again, Obed swiftly retaliated, silencing the threat. The impending storm urged them to seek shelter, anticipating a fierce downpour.|"['1.

A bright lightning flash lit up the sky, revealing the forest and hills for a brief moment before darkness enveloped everything. Two figures huddled against a stone wall, watching the storm's fierce display. Ned, despite his courage, felt a deep sense of awe at the grandeur and danger of the storm. The thunder roared like great guns, and the lightning flashed rapidly, alternating between blinding light and impenetrable darkness. A strike nearby felled trees, and the wind's howl echoed through the gorges. As the storm raged, Ned found solace in the companionship of Obed White. The fierce elements temporarily halted thoughts of the Mexican attackers. When the rain poured like a waterfall, Obed suggested they move before the Mexicans returned. They ventured into the forest, wary of the dangers lurking in the darkness.|"['1.

Obed and Ned found themselves in a valley, relieved after their escape. They rested by a stream that had swelled due to the storm. As the waters receded, they crossed it and lay down to sleep despite the dampness. The next day, Ned awoke to find a saddled horse grazing nearby. Suspicious of its presence, he woke Obed. The horse was riderless, and they pondered over its appearance. Ned kept watch, but the owner did not return. They decided to investigate the mysterious horse in the valley.|"['1.

As they descended the slope, they spotted the horse grazing peacefully in the grassy circle. Ned realized it was the soldier's horse from the day before, driven away by the storm. Obed, recognizing the horse's value, approached it with a gentle whistle, winning its trust. With a stroke of its head, the horse accepted Obed's touch. They decided to keep the horse with them, knowing it missed human company. Obed also found a pair of holster pistols and ammunition on the horse's saddle, a fortunate discovery. Over breakfast, they planned to acquire another horse from General Cos's army nearby. Obed was confident he could secure one, easing their transportation needs.

"""He resembles an American horse,"" Obed remarked happily. ""Maybe he was taken from the Texans. He'll carry one of us through miles of sand and cactus without a problem. But he needs a companion. Horses aren't meant to be alone. My sympathy for him and the need for another mount drive me to this plan,"" Obed explained. ""You stay here with the horse, and I'll go check if Cos is nearby. We need to know where the horse is before we capture it.""

Ned settled comfortably in the long grass, feeling safe and rested after their recent challenges. He watched the bay horse grazing contentedly at the end of its tether. Suddenly, the horse sensed danger, galloping in fear and causing Ned to notice a tawny jaguar creeping towards them. It was a moment of tension as they faced their old enemy once again."|"['1.

Ned was furious. After surviving a jaguar attack, he now faced another stalking their horse. Feeling sorry for the helpless animal, he knew he had to act. Cutting the lariat might make the horse flee forever. Instead, he decided to use his rifle. With careful aim, he shot the jaguar, saving the horse. Calming the trembling animal was no easy task. Eventually, he led the horse to safety. Later, Obed returned with news of Cos's army nearby. They planned to sneak in at midnight. Riding through the dark night, they spotted the campfires below.

They tied up their own horse and quietly made their way down the hill. As they reached the edge of the forest, the campfires became more visible. The fires were dying down, but they could still make out the outlines of tents and nearby, a dark mass which they assumed to be the horses of the lancers and cavalry. Moving closer, they noticed no guards near the horses but saw figures further away. Obed instructed Ned to stay put while he attempted to secure a horse. Ned watched in awe as Obed expertly approached the horses using a soft whistle. After a tense wait, Ned saw Obed successfully riding a magnificent black horse back to him. Pleased with their new supplies, they set off for Texas with the message. Riding through the night, they reached a desolate plain with no water but were prepared. Despite passing Cos's army, they remained cautious of Mexican patrols and feared encounters with mounted Indians in the north.|"['1.

At noon that day, Ned and Obed noticed four horsemen approaching from the left. The horsemen seemed to be Mexican scouts. Ned and Obed, riding powerful horses, maintained their pace, ignoring the scouts. Obed suspected the scouts would keep their distance due to the Texans' rifles. Despite being able to converse in Spanish, they avoided interaction with the scouts. Eventually, the Mexicans veered off, avoiding a confrontation with the well-armed Texans. As evening approached, Ned and Obed found a stream with fresh water and good grazing land for their horses. They refrained from lighting a fire for safety and settled for a cold meal. Obed, troubled but composed, suggested they rest, acknowledging the need for sleep after a long journey.

In a clearing among the trees, Obed found tracks of mighty hoofs mixed with horses' hoofs, causing him concern. The unshod hoofs indicated riders had passed by days ago, possibly not returning. Despite his worry, Obed returned to camp, vowing to stay alert. Yet exhaustion won, and he succumbed to sleep. Suddenly, a distant thundering sound stirred him awake. An approaching mass of buffalo, driven by fierce, almost naked riders, prompted Obed and Ned to swiftly gather their gear, mount their horses, and flee northward.

After a quick glance, they sped north on their large, powerful American horses, grateful for their steeds. Trying to outrun the Lipans, they heard a shout behind them, realizing they were spotted.

Around two in the morning, Obed suggested to Ned that he should lie down between blankets to rest better. Reluctant at first, Ned eventually agreed. Positioned on a swell with a clear view, Obed stood guard near Ned, watching the horizon for any signs of danger.

The warm water refreshed the horses as Ned and Obed refilled their bottles, allowing the Lipans to draw closer. Determined, they quickened their pace, widening the gap. Obed noted that the Lipans faced the same challenges. Vultures circling above cast a shadow, signaling danger. Despite the oppressive heat, Ned hoped for a lucky break.

In the desert, Ned and Obed faced danger when they encountered Lipan warriors. A fierce battle ensued, with shots fired and war cries echoing.

Ned and Obed rode through a fierce sandstorm, struggling to keep their eyes open and their clothes free from the scratching sand. The wind howled, the horses neighed in fear, but the two friends pressed on. After three long hours, the storm finally passed, leaving them covered in sand. As the sun emerged, they laughed at their sandy appearance. Obed joked about taking a drink and a bath, but they soon spotted their enemies, the Lipans, approaching in the distance. Ned felt a sense of dread at their relentless pursuit. However, the landscape began to improve, with cacti and trees appearing, giving them hope.

Ned and Obed reached a small stream at twilight where they and their horses drank and refreshed themselves. They feared being caught by the Lipans and hurried on. The horses showed signs of fatigue, one even limping. They hoped to lose the pursuers in the changing landscape, moving from yucca to oak trees. Crossing streams and entering a forest, they found a spot to rest. After a much-needed bath, Obed and Ned prepared for a possible fight with the Lipans. The tired horses were allowed to rest in a grassy glade while the two men fortified a cluster of trees as their defensive position.

Soon, Ned spotted movement near the edge of the woods, likely a Lipan scout. Obed proposed they cover the area together. Despite the tense situation, Ned remained composed and focused.

Obed and Ned lay low behind the logs, cautiously watching the quiet forest after a tense stand-off with the Lipans.

"""Do you think you could rest a bit, Ned?"" asked Obed, persuasively. ""I'll wake you at the first alarm, or if the alarm itself doesn't rouse you. Rest prepares us for challenges, and one must be at their best in battle.""""Only the brave and determined can do it,"" replied Obed, slyly. ""Napoleon rested before Austerlitz, and while we're not facing Austerlitz here in Northern Mexico's wilderness, there's no reason the capable can't follow a great man's lead.""He settled behind the log with his rifle, shut his eyes, showing Obed his calm demeanor in danger.

The riders ahead numbered four, with the one wearing a grand feathered headdress appearing as their chief. Ned aimed at him, but the Lipan leader's swift movements hindered his shot. Finally, seizing the opportunity, the Lipan chief raised his head to shout, yet Ned's bullet struck him down instantly. Obed's rifle echoed with Ned's, hitting another Lipan. The Lipans, startled by the gunfire and the formidable barrier, retreated in haste, leaving two fallen comrades. More men emerged from the trees, and Ned and Obed greeted them warmly. Among them was Jim, a man of medium build with dark features, resembling a warrior despite hailing from New York. Another notable figure was Henry Karnes, a renowned scout from Tennessee.

Ned grinned, uplifted by the praise from these renowned Texans. He had crucial news to share, and he knew Obed awaited it.

During the scorching afternoon, they continued riding until twilight. Even after nightfall, they crossed the Rio Grande, entering the land that would become Texas.

It was clear that the Mexicans were not going to act yet as the night fell dark and cloudy. The anxiety among Gonzales defenders grew, knowing the cover of night could hide any danger. Ned and Obed stationed themselves near the Guadalupe, watching the river darken. Ned, despite his youth, understood the importance of vigilance. Suddenly, a shot rang out, narrowly missing Ned. Obed reassured him, pointing out the Mexican shooter across the river. As morning approached, Ned and his companions gathered by the Guadalupe, observing movement in the Mexican camp.

The boy, Ned, and his companion, Obed, were part of a Texan force preparing to confront the Mexican camp. Ned expressed his loyalty to Texas, considering it his true home. As they rode towards the river, the Texan group remained silent and stoic, armed and ready for the impending conflict. Upon reaching the river, they splashed through the water towards the Mexican camp, prompting gunfire from the Mexican sentinels. The Texan leader, Moore, decided to delay the attack until the next morning, setting up a camp for the night. Obed advised Ned to eat and rest, cautioning him against rushing into battle.

Ned followed the advice given to him and settled into his blankets, knowing he would be called for his turn at one in the morning. He focused on controlling his nerves and body, reminding himself that he was among friends who would watch over him while he slept. Despite his hopes for a restful night, slumber came quickly. When he was roused at the designated time, he joined the other sentinels. The night was cold and dark, with mist obscuring his view. As he paced back and forth to stay warm, he noticed flickering lights from the Mexican camp. The thickening air and rising fog made it difficult to see, but he could hear distant voices and horse hooves. Curiosity led him closer to the camp, where he discovered the Mexicans were retreating with their arms and horses. Ned's companions planned to follow and engage them, ready for whatever the Mexicans might decide next.|"['1.

"The three friends came to a halt and strained their ears, picking up on the sounds of the retreating force. Yet, the thick white fog obscured their view entirely. ""A smart move,"" remarked Obed. ""The prairie ahead offers smooth riding. We've little to worry about unless a stray lamb from the Mexican herd stumbles upon us. Even then, he's more likely to be captured than to capture us.""

""They've paused,"" whispered the Ring Tailed Panther, excitedly. ""Looks like they're ready to stand their ground and fight. Expecting reinforcements, no doubt, or they wouldn't hold their position.""

""We need to scout out their position,"" Obed suggested. ""Details matter when we report back to Colonel Moore. We must relay everything accurately.""

""You're the real deal, Obed White,"" praised the Ring Tailed Panther. ""Let's tie our horses here and approach quietly. They might hear the horses but not us.""

After securing their horses, the trio advanced cautiously. Ned, with sharp eyes, spotted a looming shape through the fog, resembling a mist-clad iceberg. Drawing closer, they observed Mexicans fortifying a mound with a bushy base. The Texans anticipated a fierce battle ahead."|"['1.

Ned and his companions found their horses safe and were ready to ride back to the main group with news of the Mexican presence. However, Mexican sentinels spotted them and raised an alarm. A brief exchange of gunfire followed before the trio decided to head back to camp. The fog provided cover as they raced away, dodging bullets. The Mexicans, showing bravery, pursued them until they reached the Texan camp. Upon arrival, they warned of the Mexicans fortifying on a nearby hill. In response, Moore swiftly directed his men to man the cannon and fire a warning shot. The Texans, emboldened by the cannon's roar, charged towards the mound as the sun dispersed the fog. A tense standoff ensued until Captain Castenada approached with a white flag, signaling a desire to parley. Moore, accompanied by Ned and Obed, met Castenada halfway, setting the stage for a crucial negotiation.|"['1.

The Texans cheered and charged at the enemy, causing the Mexicans to panic and flee. Ned, Obed, and the Ring Tailed Panther were at the forefront of the rush, unharmed by the enemy's shots. Despite the victory, Ned foresaw challenging times ahead as the Texans were few and the Mexican retaliation would be fierce. Moore, the leader, cautioned against pursuing the fleeing Mexicans, knowing they needed to conserve their energy for the future battles.

San Antonio was a far journey to the west, and they set out at dusk fully prepared.

They crossed the Guadalupe River for the second time that day. Riding past the mound where the Mexicans briefly made a stand, the three remained silent. The hill, the site of their initial battle in the Texan struggle, loomed in the moonlight, now tranquil.

They followed the path of the fleeing Mexicans, who they believed were headed towards Cos and San Antonio. Guided by the Ring Tailed Panther, they could also trace the Mexican trail under the moonlight. Grim remnants like two deceased horses and a shallow grave marked their path.

The Texans swiftly approached the house, demanding surrender from the Mexican guard. Ignoring their plea, the guard fired a shot, narrowly missing. In response, a Texan shot and killed the guard. They then charged the house where Sandoval and his men were holed up. Despite the door holding firm, the Texans obtained axes from nearby houses and broke in. A chaotic scene unfolded as the Texans rushed in, causing most of the Mexicans to flee through the back doors and windows into the darkness. Sandoval, captured by the Ring Tailed Panther and Obed, made threats but was silenced. The Texans, unsure of what to do with the captured Mexicans, decided to release them on parole later.

Ned and his companions slept in an adobe house before heading towards San Antonio. They rested in a pecan grove and continued their journey the next day. They met a Texan who warned them about Cos's formidable force in San Antonio. The Texan confirmed that Texans were gathering to attack the Mexican fortress. They encountered Don Francisco Urrea, who had saved his uncle from guerrillas. Bowie, eager for a conference with leaders, rode ahead with Ned and a few others. They avoided Mexican lancers and camped on the prairie. Bowie led them cautiously towards San Antonio, wary of ambushes. Ned noticed a glint of light in the timber, possibly from a lance. This raised concerns about potential dangers ahead.|"['1.

The Texans spotted the approaching Mexicans, riding fast with lances raised. Ned admired how calm Bowie and his men remained. The horses stood in a perfect line, reins loose, rifles ready. Ned, flanked by Obed and Bowie, held his nerves steady. As the Mexicans closed in, Ned aimed his rifle, ready for the clash. With a swift shot, the Mexican line shattered. Horses and men fell, but some kept charging. Empty rifles didn't deter the Mexicans, until Ned drew his pistol, taking down a lancer. As the dust settled, Ned recognized the fallen foe – the man who had once struck him. It felt like fate's justice, but Ned kept silent about the eerie coincidence.|"['1.

The Texans gathered the weapons left by the fallen Mexicans, excluding the lances they didn't need. They found rifles and pistols, rode on swiftly towards San Antonio. The next day, they neared the valley by the San Antonio River and the San Pedro Creek. Ned admired the lush scenery, a stark contrast to the prairies. Despite being October, the greenery persisted in the southern region. They rode through oak groves and pecan trees, spotting springs and wildlife. While the land had a rich history, signs of decay were evident. The group arrived at an abandoned stone convent near the river. Ned felt a sense of desolation seeing the ruins stripped by raiders. As night approached, they decided to stay in the convent. Ned discovered a room without a floor and suggested sheltering the horses there due to the cold and impending rain.|['1.

The wind picked up, and cold raindrops fell on Ned, making him shiver. It seemed like it would be a chilly night, common in the southwest, with rain that would seep through. Finding shelter at the convent was a relief. After tending to the horses, they joined Bowie and the others working in the main part of the convent. Despite the ruin, the Spaniards' sturdy construction held up well. Ned felt anger seeing the plundered chapel but turned away sadly. Upstairs, the nuns' sleeping quarters were bare, but from a broken window, Ned could see the San Antonio River and dense forests. The rain intensified, driven by a howling wind. Ned, grateful for the shelter, returned to the main room where the group gathered. Despite some suggesting a fire for warmth and light, Bowie believed the room was cozy enough with the open windows. Everyone settled in for the night, except Ned, who had the first watch. He longed to be wrapped in his blanket, listening to the rain outside, but duty called. Standing guard at a broken door, he kept watch over the horses, while the others slept in the room, and the remaining sentinels were positioned throughout the building.|"[""1.

In the quiet old convent, Ned imagined hearing his comrades breathe, but it was just his fancy. The horses were still, finding refuge from the storm. Outside, the wind howled and rain pounded the roof. Ned peered out a large opening towards the river, seeing the dark pecan trees swaying. Inside, he counted his sleeping comrades, noticing empty picture frames and a rope leading to a bell. As the night dragged on, the sky remained covered, the wind relentless. Ned, feeling a sense of unease, wrapped himself in a blanket. With the second watch approaching, he thought of rest. Suddenly, he thought he saw a projection on the adobe wall, but it vanished, reminding him of the eerie atmosphere in enemy territory.

Ned gazed at the adobe wall, puzzled by the strange protrusions. Doubt crept in – was it his imagination playing tricks? Fear of ridicule kept him from seeking help. As the projections multiplied, Ned's resolve grew. Braving the storm, he saw them transform into savage figures. Shocked, he rang the bell, alerting his comrades. Bowie praised Ned's quick thinking, saving them from danger. The eerie howls faded, but Ned's courage shone bright.|"['1.

Ned swiftly dodged a bullet as it whizzed through the open doorway. The Comanches retreated into the darkness and rain without firing another shot. The defenders, armed and alert, felt secure thanks to Ned's timely warning. Despite the tension, Ned felt a surge of pride for saving the group, earning praise from Bowie. As they remained vigilant, uncertainty loomed about the Comanches' next move. An hour passed since Ned rang the bell, signaling for help. With the Texans and Mexicans at odds, the Comanches saw an opportunity for a raid. Bowie instructed Ned to ring the bell again, hoping to attract allies.

"Not a Texan stirred, but they breathed heavily. Above them, the grand bell tolled solemnly, while Ned, gripping the rope, poured all his heart and might into the task. A rifle shot rang out, a bullet whizzed past the Texans, hitting the stone wall. In response, a Comanche fired from the grass, met with a death cry.

Bowie and his men continued fighting the fire, while three sharpshooters, including the Ring Tailed Panther and Obed, targeted the Comanches. The Texans, skilled marksmen armed with rifles, drove the Comanches back. As the moonlight filtered through, the Comanches found no refuge from Texan bullets.

Ned's eyes filled with water as he felt a mix of emotions. He admired Mr. Austin for his peaceful ways in contrast to the rough Texans, but knew war was inevitable. Despite Mr. Austin's failed attempts for peace, Ned saw his weariness. Meeting famous men in the tent, including Urrea, Ned shared Mexican intel. Concerned for Mr. Austin's frailty, Ned's resolve against Santa Anna grew. As the camp buzzed with activity, Ned learned of Houston's imminent arrival and Cos's defensive preparations in San Antonio.

They cautiously approached the town on foot under the cover of darkness, aiming to reach the Mexican sentinels in San Antonio within an hour. The Ring Tailed Panther, eager for action, was a product of the rough border world, living by the sword or rifle. Despite his rough exterior, he was generous and kind, forming a strong bond with Ned.

They quietly continued creeping forward, pausing only briefly when a sentinel stopped to light a cigarette. Once well beyond the fires and within the ring of sentinels, the Ring Tailed Panther signaled for them to rise. They were now close to the town, seeing dimly lit houses in the poorer part of San Antonio. The Mexican homes were mostly huts or jacals made of adobe or mud and wattles. Feeling confident in themselves and the cover of night, they advanced. A barking dog was silenced by Obed's strong Mexican curse. Passing peons without suspicion, they observed earthworks and soldiers' camps. As they approached the town center with its stone houses resembling fortresses, the risk heightened with barricades and soldiers patrolling. The Ring Tailed Panther led them to the Vice-Governor's house, where they heard music and laughter emanating from within.|"['1.

He guided them along a narrow path, lined with rough stones, where the sounds of music and laughter grew louder. Governor Veramendi was indeed hosting a ball, confirming the Panther's hunch about Cos's presence. They reached a gate leading to a spacious courtyard filled with lush plants and palms. The Ring Tailed Panther boldly entered, disappearing among the foliage. Ned, filled with anticipation, knew the risks but also the potential rewards of eavesdropping. Positioned in dense shrubbery with Obed, the Ring Tailed Panther, and Urrea, they observed the lively scene of officers and elegantly dressed women dancing and mingling. The Texans listened closely as idle chatter and jests floated from the piazzas. As the music resumed, Ned recognized General Cos's troubled demeanor, hinting at more serious discussions ahead.

The bold border horsemen dared to besiege San Antonio, insulting Mexico. Ugartchea warned of an imminent attack, urging further fortification. Amidst questioning about defenses, a noise startled all. Hidden Texans were discovered, prompting chaos. Cos and Ugartchea fired as the Texans fled. In a daring escape, Ned, Obed, and the Ring Tailed Panther sought refuge in a hay-filled loft. As they hid, Ned realized Urrea was missing, likely captured. The Ring Tailed Panther growled in frustration, realizing they were now only three.|['1.

Ned and his companions found themselves in a precarious situation, hiding in the hay of the Vice-Governor's barn. They were at the mercy of Cos and his soldiers, unable to leave without risking capture. The sounds of the hunt echoed around them, with torches lighting up the alley outside. Despite the uncertainty of their fate and the worry for Urrea, who was also in danger, the group remained silent and hidden. As the night grew quiet, Ned realized that the hunt was likely over, and the Mexicans would assume they had escaped. Still, the fate of Urrea weighed heavily on Ned's mind, and the group remained in the hay, waiting for a plan to unfold.

After waiting for a full hour, Ned and his friends cautiously left the hay where they were hiding. Veramendi's house was dark and quiet as they sneaked out into the street. Despite hoping to see Urrea emerge from hiding, there was no sign of him. They boldly claimed to a passing soldier that they were sentinels heading to their duty at the farthest outposts, managing to pass through without interference. As dawn approached, they reached the outskirts of San Antonio. Recognized by the Texan sentinels, they were escorted to Mr. Austin's tent. Ned shared their observations with Austin, Houston, Fannin, and others. While some urged an immediate attack on Cos's forces, Austin hesitated due to the small Texan force. Houston, recognizing the Texans' fighting potential, disagreed. Ned later found Urrea at the camp, safe but injured, sharing his escape story with joy and relief.|"[""1.

Mr. Austin instructed Ned and a group to scout near San Antonio for a new position. The party, led by Bowie, included Fannin and 'Deaf' Smith. They rode boldly toward the town, challenging the Mexican army. Despite Mexican scouts watching, the Texans remained defiant. Ned felt like a knight in a story, proud to be among such brave men. As the day turned to evening, Bowie led them to a secluded spot by the river. The position seemed strategic, with the river forming a natural barrier. The Ring Tailed Panther, Bowie, had plans for the night, hinting at more action to come. The group settled in, ready for whatever might happen next.|"['1.

Ned and his companions secured the horses near the forest's edge, allowing them to graze on the grass within reach. Bowie strategically placed pickets in the woods, anticipating any potential threat. During the first watch, Ned, Obed, and the Ring Tailed Panther stood guard. Ned patrolled the area, keeping an eye on the river, its clear waters reflecting the last light of the setting sun. As darkness enveloped them, Ned's imagination transported him to a primitive world, feeling centuries away from civilization. The tranquil river's surface hinted at ancient tales, sparking visions of Indian canoes gliding silently. Suddenly, a faint metallic rattle caught their attention. Recognizing the sound of an approaching cannon, Ned and the renowned scout, Henry Karnes, tensed, ready for the looming danger.|"[""1.

The soft yellow light transformed suddenly into a brilliant red-gold hue. The mist and fog vanished under the bright rays, revealing the river, forest, and prairie in sharp detail. Ned took a deep breath as he observed the Mexican forces, outnumbering the Texans five to one, preparing to charge. The Mexican cavalry, infantry, and cannons were poised for battle, ready to overwhelm the Texans. Undeterred, the Texans stood firm, their resolute eyes fixed on the approaching enemy. The Ring Tailed Panther fired the first shot, taking down a Mexican officer. The battle erupted with thundering hooves, gunfire, and smoke.

They turned their horses and, upon reaching the crest of the next rise, San Antonio vanished from view. Ahead lay the prairies, nearly as barren as when only the Indians roamed freely. Passing a few deserted cabins nestled among trees by a spring, the group pressed on, the cabins abandoned, their occupants seeking refuge in town. One cabin appeared recently vacated, the hearth's ashes still warm, a bucket of water with a gourd left untouched. The Ring Tailed Panther felt a pang of emotion. Leaving the cabin undisturbed, they rode faster, heading northeast towards the Brazos settlements. As night approached, they encountered a buffalo hunter who mentioned rumors of Mexican cavalry north of San Antonio. Urrea dismissed the rumors, laughing at the skepticism of the old hunters. That evening, they camped in a lush forest near a cool spring. Ned and Obed scouted, finding the area teeming with wildlife. Despite the temptation, they refrained from hunting. The campfire provided warmth as November's chill set in. The Ring Tailed Panther skillfully kindled the fire, creating a cozy, secluded spot. After a long day's journey, they ate warmed food by the fire before settling in for the night. Ned chose a bed of fallen leaves under a beech tree, readying himself for sleep.

Urrea had silently moved to the other side of the glade, his feet brushing the dry leaves as he approached. Ned noticed an unusual tension in Urrea's posture, indicating anticipation. Despite the normal behavior of a sentinel, Urrea seemed poised for action, with his figure coiled like a spring and leaning forward. Ned, trying to ignore his instincts, closed his eyes once more, but the feeling of impending danger persisted. When he opened his eyes again, he saw Urrea facing the sleeping campers, scrutinizing them intently. As Urrea grabbed a burning stick from the fire and disappeared into the bushes, Ned sensed that something extraordinary was about to unfold. With wilderness training guiding his actions, Ned swiftly followed Urrea, who moved silently through the forest.

Urrea climbed high up the tree, his feet on a branch, swirling a burning stick. A wheel of fire appeared above the forest, a strange sight that stirred Ned's anger. Ned considered aiming his rifle but decided to wait. Urrea paused, then spun the torch in the opposite direction. After a while, he dropped the torch, signaling. As he descended, moonlight revealed his contemplative face. Ned struggled to reconcile the signal with Urrea's demeanor. Urrea, realizing he was discovered, turned pale.

Ned, Obed, and the Ring Tailed Panther were on guard as they continued their journey after a tense night. Urrea, suspected of treachery, was closely watched. Despite his silence, the group remained cautious, ensuring he was unarmed before resuming their march at dawn. The Ring Tailed Panther skillfully bound Urrea, allowing him some comfort despite his captivity. Ned, torn between compassion and doubt, pondered Urrea's fate but kept his thoughts to himself.

The group rode through the timber belt and reached the vast open prairie with antelope in the distance. As they advanced, they spotted a trail made by many horses, likely of white men. The Ring Tailed Panther and Obed noticed the fresh trail leading into a dense forest. Suddenly, Urrea attacked the Panther, triggering chaos. Urrea swiftly fled into the woods, prompting a whistle that Ned recognized as a signal. Ned's quick action saved him as Obed and the Panther were ambushed by Mexicans. Obed was captured, but the Panther remained unharmed. Despite the turmoil, Obed remembered Ned and made sure to shout out, showing his care for the young boy.|['1.

Ned acted on impulse, riding away alone after his comrades were captured. Bullets flew around him, but he spurred his horse faster. Despite the urge to turn back, he realized he could help his friends more by escaping. Leaning low on his horse, he evaded the shots and focused on his own safety. Riding north across the prairie, he heard the pursuing Mexicans but felt confident in his horse's speed. As the gap between them widened, Ned glanced back to see the Mexicans trying to lasso him. He aimed at their leader, hitting him before speeding away. The confusion among the Mexicans allowed Ned to increase the distance between them, eventually losing them behind the hills.|"['1.

Certain that he had successfully escaped, Ned slowed his horse to a walk. The horse was covered in sweat, so Ned made sure it cooled down gradually. Losing his horse would mean being lost. After walking for another hour, he halted to give his horse a proper rest. Ned couldn't spot any Mexicans around. The prairie seemed deserted except for him. To his right, he saw the forest's dark outline, but everywhere else was open land to the horizon. He had managed to get away! They had set out as a group of four, but now only he remained. Urrea had turned traitor, and his friends Obed and the Ring Tailed Panther were either captured or worse, a thought Ned refused to entertain. He was certain they were alive. Ned's horse rested, he mounted again, riding towards the forest where he knew the settlements lay. Despite the praise he would receive for escaping the ambush, Ned's only focus was on rescuing his friends. His gratitude towards Obed and the Ring Tailed Panther was unwavering. As he rode further into the forest, Ned was aware that it was the same one where his friends were taken. He believed the Mexican band would stay in the forest, which suited him well for working covertly. Ned was convinced the band would soon head south to reinforce Cos in San Antonio, so he needed to act swiftly. Riding through the forest of oak, ash, maple, and sweet gum, Ned felt safe from ambush due|"['1.

"Ned had already made up his mind. The sight of the creek had convinced him. He thought the Mexicans must have set up camp near the water source, so all he needed to do was follow the stream. After securing his horse, he ventured into the dense undergrowth, moving silently and swiftly. A few miles ahead, he spotted a faint light, confirming his suspicions of the Mexican camp. As he approached, the sound of voices grew louder, and upon reaching the edge of the thicket, Ned's belief turned into certainty.

The Mexican forces were gathered in a semi-circle by the creek, with horses tied on the far side. Around several bright fires, eighty to a hundred men rested comfortably, knowing no Texan troops were nearby. Ned, hidden in the bushes, observed Urrea, a figure he once respected, moving confidently among the camp. But seeing his former allies, Obed and the Ring Tailed Panther, alive but captive, ignited a fierce determination in Ned's heart."|"['1.

Obed and the Panther stood still by the tree, showing no interest in the Mexicans. Ned, unable to help, watched Urrea approach them with a sneering expression. Ned felt anger as Urrea taunted the captives. As the fires in the Mexican camp dimmed, Ned, hiding in the bushes, had an idea. The rustle of the leaves sparked a plan. He gathered leaves, ignited them, and set a forest fire toward the camp. The fire spread rapidly, driven by the wind, approaching the Mexican camp.|"['1.

Ned stayed close to the fire, dodging sparks and smoke. The flames cut a narrow path through the woods like a blazing sword. Watching from the haze, he saw the Mexican camp in chaos. Startled men and spooked horses scattered in panic. As two riders passed, unaware of him, Ned grabbed a third man on foot, causing a tumble. Obed White and the Ring Tailed Panther collided with them, all falling to the ground. Luck was on their side as Urrea, searching for prisoners, rode by without noticing.

Texans and Mexicans clashed in a fierce battle for survival. The Texans, armed with spades and shovels, toiled through the night to create a trench for protection.

Despite the danger, the Texans pressed on, unifying in a strong house. Ned, Obed, and the Ring Tailed Panther fought bravely, aiming to take down the enemy gunners. The Mexicans fortified their positions, preparing for a final stand. With women and children seeking refuge, San Antonio braced for a bloody conflict.

The Ring Tailed Panther spoke grimly about the upcoming struggles, emphasizing that the fight was far from over. Ned woke up with the taste of gunpowder in his mouth, a result of the ongoing battle. The Texans, well-prepared with food and ammunition, spent a long and monotonous day with intermittent firing. As night fell, the Mexicans launched another attack, met by Texan resistance. Restless and eager for action, the Texans broke into a new house, escalating the conflict. The death of Colonel Milam spurred the Texans on, leading them to storm more buildings and fortifications. Despite the loss, they elected a new leader and prepared for the challenges ahead. Ned found himself in the thick of the battle, growing accustomed to the chaos and hardship of war.|"['1.

"""You needn't laugh, Ned,"" said Obed. ""You're just as black as we are. This thing of changing your boarding house every night by violence and the use of firearms doesn't lead to neatness. If fine feathers make fine birds then we three are about the poorest flock that ever flew.""

""But when we go for a house we always get it,"" said the Ring Tailed Panther. ""You notice that. This place belongs to Antonio Navarro. I've met him in San Antonio, an' I don't like him, but I'm willin' to take his roof an' bed.""

Ned took the roof but not the bed. He could not sleep that night, and it was found a little later that none would have a chance to sleep. The Mexicans, advancing over the other houses, the walls of all of which joined, cut loopholes in the roof of the Navarro house and opened fire upon the Texans below. The Texans, with surer aim, cleared the Mexicans away from the loopholes, then climbed to the roof and drove them off entirely.

But no one dared to sleep after this attack, and Ned watched all through the dark hours. Certainly they were having action enough now, and he was wondering what the fourth day would bring forth. From an upper window he watched the chilly sun creep over the horizon once more, and the dawn brought with it the usual stray rifle and musket shots. Both Texan and Mexican sharpshooters"|"['1.
