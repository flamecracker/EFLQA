Young Osten stood at the ship's edge, gazing back at the chalk cliffs with regret. He tried to justify leaving by recalling his father's harshness, but memories of his father's kindness and his mother's sorrow haunted him. Below deck, his conscience troubled him, even in dreams.

The captain explained that the sea contains salt and lime, with the equator having saltier and hotter water due to faster evaporation. The movement of water from the equator to the poles and back causes commotion, aided by shellfish extracting lime for their shells. Coral insects also contribute to this process. The Gulf Stream, a warm water current, flows from the Gulf of Mexico towards Europe, softening climates. Eddies in the ocean, like the sargasso seas and the 'Doldrums' in the Atlantic, create stagnant areas. The ship _Foam_ encountered fair winds near Cape Horn, historically known for its stormy weather, before entering the peaceful Pacific Ocean.|['1.

Young Osten built magnificent castles on the mountains, some even outdoing Eastern architects. But the true splendor lay not in size or opulence, but in a humble cottage. This cottage, nestled in a palm-wood on a coral island, surrounded by nature's beauty, housed a captivating fifteen-year-old girl. Will, the dreamer, was captivated by her auburn hair and radiant smile. As dark clouds loomed, the captain's urgent orders to reef sails signaled a fierce squall approaching. The crew scrambled as the ship was tossed on its side, battling the raging sea. For two harrowing days, the _Foam_ fought for survival, facing coral reefs and towering waves. Despite the turmoil, Mr. Cupples' somber demeanor remained unchanged, adding a touch of gloom to the already perilous situation.|"['1.

It is hard for those who have never been at sea to understand the emotions of men suddenly awakened to the fact that their ship, their home for weeks or months, is sinking. The crew of the _Foam_ worked desperately at the pumps as water flooded in. When hope was lost, the captain calmly prepared to abandon ship. He ordered the crew to hoist out the boats and pack provisions. The men, inspired by the captain's leadership, followed orders. The boats were lowered, but a tragic mistake led to the loss of lives. Despite this, the remaining boats were launched safely. As the _Foam_ sank, the crew watched in sorrow.

The captain spoke in hopeful tones but felt deep anxiety for his companions. They spent a stormy night without rest, their spirits buoyed by the approaching dawn. As the sun rose, hope filled their hearts. Exhausted and haggard, they shared a meager breakfast. Suddenly, they spotted something black floating in the water - the capsized jolly-boat! The men sprang into action, rescuing three survivors. These men, including Mr. Cupples and the steward, were barely conscious. They recounted being capsized and clinging to the boat in a state of partial insensibility. Captain Dall estimated they were nearer to coral islands than the coast of South America.

"The cook replied, ""I usually stay in the background for dirty work, letting you lead, as it's your calling. Look, the sun is setting, boys,"" he sighed, lighting a smoke. The news of another dark night sinking in dampened their spirits. They sat quietly, watching waves and the sunset. Suddenly, Will Osten pointed, ""Land!""

Will and the crew faced a dire situation on the island. Supplies were running low, and their spirits were fading. Will proposed a plan to create a massive signal fire to attract potential rescuers.

Will Osten, the youngest and most hopeful of the group, was slowest to accept the looming disappointment and the harsh reality of their situation. As he lay in the tent, his mind raced with the possibility of death drawing near. Suddenly, a dark object in the distance caught his eye, disrupting his thoughts. It was a canoe approaching from the sea, filled with unknown figures. The group quickly realized they might be in danger. The captain, well aware of the savagery of the islanders, debated whether to trust them or prepare for a possible attack.

When the council ended, the sailors gathered at the water's edge as a war-canoe approached. Filled with warriors, the canoe neared the shore, led by a chief adorned with tattoos and a unique hairstyle. As the canoe halted and the warriors disembarked, a misunderstanding arose when one of the sailors inadvertently caused a commotion by grabbing a musket. Captain Dall intervened by using a traditional greeting, rubbing noses with the chief to defuse the tension. However, despite the attempt at peace, the sailors were outnumbered and overpowered by the natives.

After the sailors were secured, the islanders gathered the supplies left by them and loaded them onto the canoe. This took a long time as they meticulously combed the island, leaving nothing behind that seemed valuable to them. Meanwhile, the white men were left lying in the leaking canoe. Larry was in danger of drowning, but our hero, Will, managed to help him by allowing him to rest his head on a paddle. The captives were then carried to a village where they were bound and left in a hut. While some like Captain Dall appeared calm, others like Will were restless and anxious. Larry was vocal about his distress, while Muggins remained stoic. The men awaited their fate, each reacting differently to the impending doom.|['1.

Several hours passed as evening approached and darkness enveloped the hut where the prisoners were held captive. The savages outside shouted and sang, occasionally glimpsed through the logs. As night fell, fires were lit, revealing a feast and dance. Suddenly, chilling screams pierced the air. The captives recognized the voice of their fellow seaman, George Goff, now deceased and being carried by the natives for a gruesome ritual. In a frenzy, O'Hale struggled against his bonds. The hut was soon invaded by the tattooed and painted natives, but a tall, painted savage intervened, ordering the prisoners' release. Speaking English, the stranger revealed himself as an Englishman, offering help in exchange for obedience. Captain Dall expressed gratitude and confusion at the unexpected turn of events.|"['1.

The tall man, known as Buchanan among the natives, was a runaway sailor who had earned respect by defeating the strongest men in the tribe. He had married the chief's daughter and become a prominent figure. When he learned about the captured men, including Larry O'Hale, he knew they were in grave danger. Buchanan offered them a chance to join forces with the tribe to defend against an impending attack. The prisoners had no choice but to agree. They were painted in intricate designs with red, white, and black earth. Despite the seriousness of the situation, even in the midst of fear, they couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of the painting process. Larry, in his enthusiasm, nearly caused a conflict by attempting to paint himself further. The situation was diffused by Buchanan, preventing potential violence.|"[""1.

When the painting was finished, their guardian guided the men (now no longer white!) to the chief's hut. At first, Bukawanga was met with a cool reception. The chief, a large, distinguished old man named Thackombau, with a massive head of curly hair, eyed the newcomers suspiciously, and the warriors around him seemed unfriendly. Sensing danger, the prisoners felt their lives were in jeopardy. However, things took a turn when their ally stood up and spoke to the group. Bukawanga had not yet explained why he returned suddenly from the war. The chief and his men were alarmed to learn that a rival tribe was on their way to attack. When Bukawanga suggested preparing for defense and offered the prisoners as allies, the mood improved. Eventually, Thackombau agreed to work together, and they were sent to another hut for supper. Their savior knew they couldn't handle dining with the natives, who planned to eat their fallen comrades. To distract them, he shared tales of his adventures while they enjoyed a meal of baked pig, yams, soup in cocoa-nut shells, and other dishes. Despite the unfamiliar food, it was surprisingly delicious. They were offered the juice of young cocoa for a drink and advised to avoid the intoxicating ava beverage.

"""They're getting ready for action,"" he said, jumping up. ""Now, lads, follow me. I'll get you weapons, and, listen closely,"" he added, with a somewhat strange smile, ""I heard some of you say you don't want to shed blood where you have no quarrel. Well, there's no need to do so. Only act in self-defense, and that'll be enough; do you understand?"" The man chuckled briefly as he said this, then led his countrymen from the hut towards a temple, near which a large group of warriors was busy preparing for the upcoming fight. The horrors of war are not pleasant to discuss or think about. Therefore, we will refrain from delving into the full details of the bloody fight that followed the arrival of Wandering Will and his friends on the island. It is enough to say that many lives were lost. Although the loss of life was not comparable to civilized warfare, the savagery and brutality were abundant. During the fight, the sights and sounds were appalling, turning the hearts of the white men sick with a desire to escape. The war was mainly fought in the bush, which allowed the sailors to act as spectators.

A dreadful mistake was made by Larry when he accidentally hit one of the village chiefs with a club while aiming at something else. The chief was furious and cursed them as they fled. The group decided to hide in the mountains to escape the wrath of the villagers. The journey was tough, with steep cliffs and thick undergrowth, but they persevered. The captain showed determination, while Larry's strength and Will's agility helped them along. They found a cave on a high cliff with a commanding view, deciding it was a good place to hide from the pursuing tribes.

For three months, Wandering Will and his group hid in the mountains. They were pursued by the natives but surprisingly the search was abandoned after a week. They ventured out for food and puzzled over the sudden change in the natives' behavior. They survived on fruits, vegetables, and hunted pigs and birds. The island was abundant with resources like breadfruit trees and cocoa-nuts. They used the bark of the cocoa-nut palm for clothing. Will and Captain Dall discussed the beauty of the island and the need for missionaries. Meanwhile, a tragic event unfolded in the native village as armed seamen attacked the villagers over a dispute, resulting in casualties. Their discussions on religion, philosophy, and politics filled their days in hiding.|"['1.

A week after a missionary ship anchored off the village, aiming to spread Christianity. The islanders, still resentful from past events, initially threatened the missionaries. A sailor, recovering from a wound, rushed to protect them. His efforts convinced the islanders to allow the missionaries to land. The missionaries faced challenges common in missionary work. They began building a church and teaching the natives. The natives found joy in receiving clothing but struggled to wear it correctly. A chief wearing a petticoat unknowingly led two fugitive white men to the missionaries. The encounter brought laughter and curiosity. Despite challenges, the missionaries and the natives began to interact and learn from each other.|"[""1.

"""I have decided to go back to the village with this gentleman in the red coat to see if everyone there is dressed the same way. I feel like we've been living here without a purpose,"" said Will. Larry interrupted, mentioning how well they've been living and how Mr. Cupples and Muggins are getting fat. Will insisted on going to the village. The captain thought it was madness, Mr. Cupples shook his head, Muggins felt they should all go together, and Larry refused to let Will go alone. Will convinced them that his plan was best. He argued that it was better for one person to take the risk while the rest had a chance to escape. Eventually, they agreed, and Will set off with his friend in disguise.

That evening, Bukawanga and Thackombau went to a mountain-cave. They explained the village's situation to the occupants and brought them to the mission-house, where they settled in. They were warmly welcomed. Mr. Westwood, who had not seen fellow countrymen for a long time, was delighted to hear English voices. He shared many missionary stories with them and the next day showed them the church under construction. Mr. Westwood mentioned the classes for women and girls, the native-taught school, and the growing attendance at their meetings. He pointed out the church being built by former enemies now working together. Wandering Will and the seamen helped with the building.

Before Will could think of another way to start the conversation, they arrived at the church. In front of the open door lay a unique gift to Christianity. It wasn't money but items like bamboo filled with coconut oil, mats, native cloth, fruits, vegetables, and baked pigs. The natives generously offered this. Suddenly, a cannon-shot echoed, and a ship appeared. The congregation rushed to the shore to meet it. The ship's captain, planning to scare the natives for water, was surprised by their fearlessness. He was humbled by the church's presence. The captain, with good humor, praised religion in the South Seas. Later, the crew discussed leaving the island on the ship to England. Captain Dall spoke with the captain, who offered them passage. Will, overwhelmed with emotions, confessed his love to Flora before their potential departure.|"['1.
