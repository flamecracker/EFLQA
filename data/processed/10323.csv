In a moment of bravery, Tom, Frank, Stanley, and others rushed to hold the heavy pole up, preventing a disaster. The boys managed to save Billy and Charley just in time. Grateful for the rescue, the small students thanked their peers. The broken flagstaff was replaced with a larger, sturdier one. The incident led to Dick being chosen as the freshmen's class leader. Later, a plan to play a prank on Tom by altering a photograph was revealed, causing tension in the air. The Rover boys planned a trip to town to check on their friends at Hope Seminary.|"['1.

For the first part of the race, the two rowboats stayed close together. One boat would edge ahead a bit, but the other would catch up quickly. Then, the Rover boys got into a strong, steady rhythm and pulled ahead. They rowed faster and soon started to pass the other boat. However, a mistake by Tom caused them to fall behind momentarily. Determined, the Rovers increased their speed even more, leaving Koswell and Larkspur far behind. The cheering crowd celebrated the Rovers' victory as they crossed the finish line, winning by a significant margin. Despite their defeat, Koswell and Larkspur were sour and vowed revenge.

Tom and Dick were dressed in formal attire, but still wore linen coats buttoned up to their necks. As they walked, they unexpectedly came upon a back road almost as good as the highway they left. They saw two cyclists speeding ahead with heads bent low over the handlebars. After fixing a flat tire, they continued their journey but felt less carefree. At the garage, they shared their road mishap with the manager. The Rovers then snuck into a bicycle room, where they found bikes belonging to various students. They cautiously made their way to a specific room, avoiding detection.

William Philander was dressed in a light gray suit, looking somber as if attending a funeral. Tubbs, wearing patent leather shoes with spats, a cream-colored necktie, and matching gloves, was unexpectedly ambushed by six sophomores. They grabbed his arms and snatched his cherished gold-headed cane, causing a scuffle. Amid the chaos, Tubbs had his collar torn, his necktie ripped, and his coat split. A tug-of-war over the cane ensued, with Tom and Sam managing to secure it. Meanwhile, other sophomores taunted Tubbs, using his hat as a football and piling on top of him. As a crowd gathered, a spirited but good-natured struggle unfolded over the cane's fate. Eventually, Sam seized the opportunity, leaped on a sophomore's shoulders, and snatched the cane, fleeing towards the dormitory.

After the girls left for Hope Seminary, Sobber and his lawyer, Martin Snodd, visited Mr. Laning and then me. Sobber was angry, claiming he and his deceased uncle were cheated out of the treasure. Snodd hinted Sobber might settle if given 75% of the fortune. Mr. Laning suggested a smaller settlement, but Sobber refused and obtained a court injunction, freezing the money in the banks. Snodd is involved on speculation, aiming to get half of the outcome. The case may take months to resolve in court, with concerns about manufactured evidence. Dick and Tom worry about the outcome, fearing Sobber's deceit and the involvement of others like Sid Merrick's relatives. The legal battle looms, with uncertainty about who will ultimately claim the fortune.|"['1.

I will not go into all the details of the football game between Brill and Roxley because there are many other things I want to share. However, I feel compelled to talk about the unforgettable second half. In the first half, Roxley dominated with two touchdowns and a field goal. The Brill team, feeling the pressure, changed their tactics and played a more open game. They used a clever trick that gained them significant yardage and eventually led to a field goal. The game intensified, with both teams fighting fiercely. Brill, initially facing defeat, started to see a glimmer of victory. In a crucial moment, Dick, despite his injuries, managed to break through the Roxley defense and make a remarkable run towards the goal. The crowd cheered him on, and even Dora, who had been oblivious to him before, stood up in excitement, waving a banner.|"[""1.

After a thrilling football match, Brill emerged victorious against Roxley. Tom and Dick, the heroes of the game, were surrounded by friends celebrating their win. Despite the excitement, there was tension between the friends due to misunderstandings involving Dora. The boys longed to reunite with Sam and the girls, Nellie and Grace, but found them gone. Sam's visit to Dora at the seminary caused further discord among the group. The boys continued to excel in subsequent games against colleges from Delton and Speer. As Thanksgiving passed at Brill, some students left for the holiday, including Dudd Flockley and Jerry Koswell. Meanwhile, rivals like the dude and his friends were biding their time, looking for opportunities to cause trouble for the Rover boys.|"['1.

Dick, Tom, and Sam excelled in their studies and got along well, except for their strict teacher, Professor Sharp. Despite his demands, they followed the rules diligently, avoiding lectures or punishments. Meanwhile, news from home revealed that a legal case against their families was escalating. Mr. Rover suspected fabricated evidence from the opposing lawyer, Tad Sobber. Fate seemed to conspire against the boys when they ventured into the woods one December afternoon. While searching for nuts, they unexpectedly encountered Minnie Sanderson and her friends. The group spent a pleasant time gathering nuts together. Minnie's warm invitation to join them in cracking nuts by the fire during winter left a lasting impression on Dick. The peaceful woods inspired Songbird to recite a poetic verse about the tranquil surroundings.|"['1. What did Dick, Tom, and Sam excel in?\nA) Sports\nB) Studies\nC) Music\nD) Art\nE) Cooking', '2.

"""Look, a carriage is coming,"" said Dick as he moved onto the road to get a better view, with the rest of the group following. Soon, the Hope Seminary carryall appeared, carrying several girls, including Dora, Nellie, and Grace. ""Hello! Look over there!"" exclaimed Tom, tipping his cap, with the other boys doing the same. Dora and her cousins glanced at the group, blushing slightly, before exchanging stiff bows as the carryall continued on its way. The encounter left a somber mood, and the girls felt it. After a brief chat, they parted ways with the Rovers and Songbird. ""I plan to visit them all,"" Songbird mentioned.

"""It's not okay, and we'll investigate right away,"" declared Dick, leading Tom and Sam to Flockley and Koswell's room. They knocked, and after a pause, the door opened. Nellie's note mentioned a court case, but lacked details. Dora and Grace's notes were similar, with Grace asking Sam to write back. Dick suspected Flockley's presence in Ashton wasn't a coincidence. Disappointed they missed talking to the girls, they wrote lengthy letters. Snow arrived, bringing a fun snowball fight at school. The boys planned gifts for their family members.

When the boys excitedly shared their plan to go to Dexter's Corners, the old folks were initially doubtful but eventually relented. Bundled up in warm clothes, they set out on a long, chilly journey with the best horses and a sturdy cutter. Upon reaching the postmaster's house, they eagerly awaited news from home. The postmaster returned with a picture postcard for Mrs. Randolph Rover and some mail for their father. The boys were delighted to find packages from their friends, including neckties, books, diaries, and homemade fudge. After spending the morning writing letters, they shared updates with their friends, including Songbird Powell's crush on a girl they had helped before. As the storm cleared, they enjoyed sleigh rides, skating, and catching up with friends before returning to school with renewed determination to excel academically.|"[""1.

Tom correctly predicted that Flockley wouldn't perform well on the team, and his errors led to his dismissal. Songbird Powell replaced him and the team won three consecutive games, pleasing the Brill students. Minnie Sanderson, a close friend of Songbird, cheered heartily at the games. Meanwhile, Dick briefly spoke to Minnie, but didn't linger. Eventually, the boys received letters from Dora and the Lanings, detailing their time in Philadelphia and the trouble at Hope Seminary caused by Tad Sobber. Dora's letter to Dick was affectionate, easing their previous misunderstandings. Despite little snow that winter, the boys enjoyed snowball fights and skating on the river, with Tom having a skirmish with Jerry Koswell during a skating race, resulting in a fierce but brief altercation.|"[""1.

As Spring arrived, the boys eagerly awaited the return of their friends Dora, Nellie, and Grace to Hope. Excited to meet them in Ashton, the boys were a bit nervous despite the warm letters they received. When the girls' train arrived, there was a flurry of greetings and laughter. Meanwhile, the boys discussed a trip to the deserted Jamison place. As they planned, Larkspur schemed with Koswell and Flockley to get the Rovers in trouble. The boys set off for Rushville in a carriage, unaware of Larkspur's plot. On the way, they passed the haunted house, a lonely and eerie spot. Undeterred, they explored the dilapidated structure, surrounded by silence and overgrown with nature.|"['1.

"""This mansion was once grand,"" Dick remarked, shining the lantern light around. ""But now, it's worthless,"" he added, surveying the decay. The dining-room was in a wing, accessed through nearly closed folding doors. Passing through, a mysterious rustling sound caught their attention.
