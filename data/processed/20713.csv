Jack sprinted up the tree like a squirrel, disappearing from Bessie's view. Anxious but hopeful, she waited. Within minutes, Jack reappeared with Zara. They ran into the woods, fleeing from Farmer Weeks. Jack, a speedy runner, led the way with Zara and Bessie close behind. As they ran, the pursuers' shouts grew louder. Jack led them to a hidden cave entrance, covering it with branches to conceal their hiding spot.

To be a Wood-Gatherer in the Camp Fire group, one must desire to follow the Fire's law, consisting of seven points. The Wood-Gatherers are then taught this desire by the Council Fire. Moving up to become a Fire-Maker requires faithful service as a Wood-Gatherer and completing tasks that are not overly difficult.

Bessie found herself deep in dense woods, surprised by a wire fence ahead. Beyond it, a colorful bird hinted at the pheasants she was meant to scare.

As she neared a crouching figure, she accidentally alerted him, revealing her enemy, Jake Hoover. Quick to act, she bravely restrained him until a game-keeper intervened. With a whistle, more help arrived, including General Seeley. Bessie's courage and determination paid off as justice prevailed in the end.|['1.

"""What? At it again?"" he said, angrily, as he saw Bessie. Jake was hidden by the game-keeper, and General Seeley thought at first that it was Bessie who had fallen to the trap he had set. Bessie said nothing--she couldn't.

""No, General. It wasn't the girl, after all,"" said the game-keeper. ""Never did seem to me as if it could be, anyhow. Here's the lad that did it all--and I caught him in the act. The feathers are all over him still.""

""It wasn't me! She did it! I saw her, and I took the feathers from her,"" wailed Jake, anxious, as ever, to escape himself, no matter how many lies he had to tell, or who had to suffer for his sins. But the game-keeper only laughed roughly.

""Is that so? Well, you shall have the best wardrobe money can buy, Bessie, just as soon as Mrs. Chester can get it for you. I'll make that my present to you--as a way of making up, partly, for the way I behaved to you. How will you like that?""
