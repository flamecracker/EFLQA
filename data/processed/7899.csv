Imagine a calm lake. It appears motionless, but when a stone is tossed in, ripples spread out until they reach the shore. Similar to this, hitting a drum creates sound waves that travel outward. Electricity works in a similar way; it remains dormant until activated. Just as the lake ripples after a stone is thrown, and sound waves emanate from a drum when struck, electricity needs a disturbance to create waves. Hertz discovered how to generate and transmit these waves, allowing communication across vast distances. The doctor explains that the wireless telephone converts sound into electricity and back, amplifying it significantly. This advancement in technology allows sound to travel around the world at incredible speeds. By understanding and utilizing this technology, we can benefit from improved communication and education.|['1.

After much discussion and eager questioning, the young experimenters were content with their purchases. Dave Slocum sold more copper wire in one afternoon than in the past five years, along with other items like insulators and detectors. The boys bundled their purchases and headed out. Bob suggested a plan to set up a mast on the chimney and barn for their aerial. They crafted a mast from lumber, planed it, and fixed a hook for the aerial wire. Climbing onto the roof, they secured the aerial to the mast. Moving quickly, they repeated the process on the barn. Despite the physical effort, they were excited about receiving their first radio signals. The boys admired their work, feeling proud of their accomplishment.|['1.

"Jimmy complained in a hurt tone, ""Just because I'm not as slim as you guys, you assume I eat more. Nobody could eat more than you, Herb, and survive."" Bob objected, ""It's getting dark, let's plan the wiring diagram tomorrow. Come over after dinner to start the tuning coil."" Reluctantly, Joe agreed. They reconvened at Bob's house at 8 p.m., excited for the project. Mr. Layton showed mild interest but left them to work. Jimmy suggested having milk chocolate to begin, sharing a bar. Bob started winding shellacked paper on a wooden core using a lathe, while Joe and Herb assisted. Jimmy joked from the sofa. Bob teased them for not letting him rest.

Working with wire proved to be a challenging task for the boys. They had to wind the wire carefully, ensuring it lay smooth without any gaps between coils. There were moments when they had to unwind and rewind coils multiple times before achieving a satisfactory result. Despite the difficulties, they managed to finish the task with pride. Joe compared their work to a coil he saw in New York, feeling it looked just as good. Bob, on the other hand, believed they could have done it just as well, albeit taking longer. As they contemplated mounting the core with sliding contacts, they decided to pause for the night. The mention of apple pie and milk from Bob's mother prompted them to rush upstairs, joking about who would get the smallest piece. Jimmy, arriving last, engaged in a playful argument about pie etiquette with Bob, all while enjoying the delicious treat.|['1.

"""I understand how he feels,"" Joe remarked. ""It would be heartbreaking for him not to work on this radio project. I'm excited for the day we can pick up our first message or music from the air."" The boys collaborated and crafted a tuning coil using brass rods and a spring contact. They scraped off the insulating enamel to expose the copper coils. Joe mentioned the need for a condenser but admitted not fully grasping its purpose. Bob explained it as an equalizer for the electric current, storing and releasing energy to prevent damage. Herb suggested using tinfoil for the plates, recalling a forgotten collection from his childhood. They planned to resume work after supper, eager to hear the sounds their tuner would capture.

"Joe quickly introduced his friends in a rush, and soon they were assisting the elderly man out of the house and into the car. They excitedly shared tales of radio technology with him, almost overwhelming him with their chatter. ""Let's have the kids ride in your car,"" Joe suggested hurriedly. ""There's more space, and they won't bother the older folks. And ask the driver to go slow,"" he added. ""This car isn't great on shocks, and we don't want to jolt them too much. Take it easy, Joe."" The children were thrilled for a change and adventure, bringing tears to their mother's eyes as they settled in the back of the Atwood car. Bob thought it might not be so bad if Aunty Bixby didn't show up, but he kept quiet. Meanwhile, Aunty Bixby approached them with determination, followed by Jimmy. Joel Banks courteously made room for her in the car, and Bob noticed a hint of amusement in his eyes. Bob nudged Jimmy to introduce the two elderly guests, but Aunty Bixby struggled with the names despite her ear trumpet. ""Not that it matters,"" she grumbled, urging them to get going.

As predicted, the bullies were entangled on the floor, fighting amongst themselves. The radio boys achieved their goal and left the bullies struggling in the dark. They returned to Jimmy's house, laughing at the situation. Joe mentioned they were lenient on the bullies for stealing Doughnuts' equipment. Jimmy was grateful for getting his set back. The boys decided to teach the bullies a lesson to leave them alone. After enjoying rice pudding, they went home satisfied. Bob remembered a place the bullies mentioned but joked about not wanting to go there. The bullies, Looker and Lutz, were too intimidated to start a fight after their encounter with the radio boys.

In every area with a radio inspector, there are directional finders. These finders use a loop aerial, compass, and radio set to track signals. By turning the loop to the loudest signal and noting the compass reading, a map is marked with lines showing the signal's source. These lines intersect to pinpoint the offender's location. Brandon proposed a plan to locate the man the next day, enlisting Bob and Joe's help. Excited and hopeful, they left the store discussing their mission. Bob, eager to see justice served, devised a plan involving Miss Berwick and lawyer Mr. Wilson. The next day, they all met at Hall's garage, ready to track down the culprit.|"['**1.

Dan Cassey was very scared and tried to stall, stuttering and turning red in the face. The lawyer was firm and made him hand over a paper from a drawer. Mr. Wilson checked it and smiled, saying it was the mortgage, settling the account with Miss Berwick. Cassey begged for mercy, but the lawyer scolded him, saying he deserved jail. Miss Berwick forgave him, sparing him punishment. They left Cassey ashamed and went back to their car. They rode through Ocean Point, a familiar place for the boys. The adventures of the boys will continue in the next book. They were excited about the Ferberton prize to be awarded that night. Mr. Ferberton talked about wireless wonders and the radio sets were tested. Jimmy received honorable mention.|['1.
