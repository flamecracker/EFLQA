Martin and Barney found themselves in a strange situation after escaping pirates and wandering into the woods. They stumbled upon a hermit's dwelling, where they were welcomed. The hermit listened intently to their tale of adventure and danger. He then instructed them to rest for the night and promised to speak with them the next day. The hermit provided hammocks for the tired travelers. The next morning, Martin woke up feeling weak and discovered blood on his feet. The hermit, knowledgeable about vampire bats, explained how these creatures feed on blood and had attacked Martin during the night. He treated Martin's injuries with herbs and bandages. The hermit shared details about the vampire bats' habits, including their sharp teeth and leaf-like lips.

"Barney exclaimed, ""Och, the blood-thirsty spalpeen!"" as he got up and went to inspect the bat nailed against the wall. ""Bad luck to them, they've ruined Martin entirely.""

""I'm relieved to hear you say so,"" Martin replied. ""It would be tiresome to stay here when I have so much to explore. I already feel better. Please, if you could provide me with some breakfast, I'll be fully recovered.""

As Martin spoke, the hermit, now dressed in a brown hunting-coat, set a generous meal on the table. They all enjoyed the feast, including cold meats, fresh venison steak, coffee, fruit, honey, and cakes made from mandioca-root flour.

Barney, enjoying the food, asked about the meat. The hermit explained that the coffee, cakes, and honey were sourced locally, and he elaborated on the various fruits and roots grown in the region.

Barney, content, remarked on the unique country, prompting Martin to joke about his hairy friend's protection from mosquitoes. Martin then requested the hermit to share more about the peculiar land they were in.

The recluse stood up and fetched some tobacco and a nearly foot-long cigar from a box. He lit the cigar swiftly, puffing like a chimney, while his small pipe glowed. Sitting down, he crossed his arms, leaned back, and grinned, displaying an Irish smile. The thick smoke drove mosquitoes away, letting Martin in his hammock view the orange and coffee trees, palms, and flowers. The hermit, after puffing thoughtfully, decided to share his tale. He recounted his ancestors' arrival in Brazil in 1500, led by explorers like Pinçon and Cabral. He narrated a shipwreck in 1510, where the crew, except the captain Carreo, met a tragic fate at the hands of the natives. Carreo narrowly escaped, aided by the chief's daughter, averting a gruesome end.|"['1.

"The captain, Diego Carreo, displayed quick thinking when faced with hostile savages. Realizing that fighting or fleeing was futile, he cleverly used his musket to gain their trust. By showing a gesture of peace and respect to the chief, Carreo managed to win over the tribe. Over time, he became a respected figure among the natives, even marrying the chief's daughter. Known as ""Caramuru,"" meaning 'The man of fire,' he played a significant role in the settlement and prosperity of Brazil. However, challenges arose with the arrival of the Portuguese, Spaniards, Dutch, and English settlers. Despite the progress made under King John VI, obstacles like the negative influence of certain Roman Catholic priests hindered the country's advancement.

Padre Caramuru, a former priest turned merchant, discovered the power of the Bible, realizing salvation came through faith, not works.

In Brazil, there is a vast array of resources and wildlife. The land offers dyewoods, cabinet-woods, drugs, gums, and hides from wild cattle. The fields yield rice, tapioca, cocoa, and a variety of fruits and vegetables like bananas, oranges, and pineapples. The forests boast numerous trees, some over thirty feet in circumference, with dense undergrowth making it impassable in parts. The country is home to wild horses, hogs, goats, and diverse wildlife such as tiger-cats, jaguars, and sloths. The population is a mix of Portuguese settlers, native Indians, and Negroes, with Roman Catholicism as the dominant religion.

Armed with a spear, the hermit and his companions ventured into the forest. Barney noticed the hermit's unusual weapon and asked about it. The hermit pointed out an armadillo attacking a stone. The bird flew off, and the stone transformed into the armadillo, swiftly burrowing out of sight. The hermit explained the armadillo's defense mechanism. As they walked, they encountered colorful parrots and toucans. The hermit shared knowledge about the birds and their habits. The group also spotted blue herons and hanging nests of orioles. The hermit cautioned that wild animals often stayed hidden from travelers. Suddenly, a red monkey surprised Barney, leading to a comical encounter. Later, they rested under trees, listening to the bell-birds' unique calls. Barney mistook the bird's sound for a blacksmith's hammer.

"In front of them, a terrifying creature dashed across their path. Martin thought of St. George and the Dragon as he saw the hideous lizard with bright scales and a long tail. The hermit swiftly killed it to show it was harmless. They then entered a dark valley with giant plants and ferns. The hermit pointed to majestic trees, calling them his ""cows"" that provided milk-like cream. The milk-tree's fruit yields rich pulp and vegetable milk that tastes like cow's milk.

Barney suggested that the spalpeen might be hiding in a cave where Martin left his gun. As they approached, a low sound interrupted Barney's speech. The hermit pulled him back and stood firm, spear pointed at the cave. An arrow was shot, resulting in a savage roar and a jaguar leaping out. The hermit faced the beast bravely, but the spear broke, and the jaguar fell on him. Martin quickly shot the jaguar dead, saving the hermit. After the encounter, they continued through the woods, ensuring they reached their destination before nightfall. Along the way, they dealt with an iguana and an armadillo. The hermit lit a fire to force the armadillo out, comparing its defense to an ostrich's behavior. Finally, they returned home for a well-deserved rest and refreshments.

The hermit was about to embark on a trading trip when Martin shared their interest in exploring the interior with him. The hermit agreed to take them along as muleteers. Martin and Barney were eager to repay their friend for his hospitality. The hermit revealed they could find work as canoe-men on the Amazon, assuring them of opportunities if they could endure the heat and hard work.

The travelers adapted to the climate, leaving umbrellas aside. They traversed a diverse landscape with unique plants.

Approaching mid-day, the hermit and his companion found a tree for a rest. Water was available in a stump. Frogs swam in a small lake within it, but the water was fresh. Later, they saw mules with Negro drivers heading to town. A Brazilian merchant led the way, giving a nod. They stopped at a roadside public-house with no sleeping space. They bought farina and prepared supper outside. Barney cooked various dishes with fruits and vegetables. The hermit was amazed. They were told of a festa nearby but decided to finish smoking first. They walked to the village in the evening, where music and fireworks entertained the locals. The hermit explained to Barney that it was a way to amuse and mislead the people. They met an old Negro who confirmed the hermit's explanation. Young girls in white dresses adorned with fire-flies passed by, looking like supernatural beings with their radiant appearance.|['1.

Barney and his companions were amazed by the vibrant village they entered. The church, brightly lit, stood out with its two towers. The streets were broad and overgrown with lush vegetation, making it seem like a place taken over by giant weeds. The houses, painted white or yellow with green doors and windows, looked like grown-up toys. The village was alive with revelry and arguments, filling the air with noise. They encountered a diverse crowd - priests in processions, girls selling treats, Brazilians in various attire, and indigenous people in loincloths. Amidst the festivities, they stumbled upon a massive wild fig tree sheltering a bustling fandango. As they strolled through a grove, a woman's scream led them to a violent altercation. Barney intervened, thwarting a potential tragedy. As the situation escalated, they fled the scene, pursued by angry villagers.

Many months have passed since our brave explorers last departed. They journeyed across vast lands and reached the source of a river flowing into the Amazon. There, they met a trader, a free mulatto, deserted by his Indian crew, a common occurrence in that region. The trader hired them, and they bid farewell to their hermit friend. The hermit gifted Martin a tiny marmoset monkey and Barney a loyal dog. The monkey, with a tragic past, drank coffee and slept peacefully. Martin adored it, but the monkey adored Barney's dog. While on the river, the marmoset played with the dog, Grampus. The trio descended the river, encountering villages and plantations, until they reached the mighty Amazon. Barney attempted to hunt an alligator, but the creature's tough scales proved impenetrable. The vulnerable spots on an alligator are its throat and leg joints, known to jaguars, its natural enemy.|"['1.

The Amazon River, at its mouth, resembles a wide lake more than a river. It is the largest river in the world, flowing for nearly four thousand miles through South America. Originating in the Andes, it receives water from various tributaries, making it enormous when it reaches the Atlantic Ocean. The Amazon is divided by the island of Marajo, with the larger branch being ninety-six miles wide. The river is navigable for three thousand miles inland and is affected by tides up to four hundred miles. During the rainy season, the Amazon overflows its banks, creating a vast aquatic environment. The river is surrounded by hills and flat shores, with towns and villages dotting its course. Despite its richness, the region remains underutilized due to the lack of enterprise among its people.|"[""1.

Barney, Martin, and an old trader were exploring the Amazon River in a canoe when they encountered a massive serpent that had swallowed an entire ox. The old trader explained that anacondas in the region often devour large animals whole. As they inspected the serpent, another anaconda appeared, causing Barney to flee back to the safety of the boat. The group then discovered a sandbank where turtles lay their eggs, which are collected by locals for food and oil production. Despite the turtles' efforts to conceal their eggs, humans gather them in large quantities. The eggs are crushed and boiled to extract oil used for lamps and cooking. This practice results in very few turtle eggs reaching maturity.|"['1.

When the young turtles venture into the water, they face many enemies. Alligators, jaguars, eagles, buzzards, and wood ibises lurk to catch them. Even if they manage to dodge these threats, large fish await in the stream. It's a wonder any survive. An old trader swiftly collected a hundred eggs, pleasing Martin and Barney. He skillfully shot a large turtle underwater with a bow and arrow, while his companions prepared a fire for a meal. Dinner included an omelet, turtle-steak, and jaguar meat. The turtle eggs, with leathery shells and edible yolks, were a favorite. The group continued up the Amazon, encountering wealthy cacao planters along the way. These planters, mostly Brazilians, appreciated the goods the adventurers offered. The journey revealed the extremes of the land, from elegant ladies in modest homes to half-naked populations in the next village. At a plantation with a pond frequented by alligators, the adventurers decided to join a hunting expedition.|['1.

Barney paused to observe the vibrant wildlife surrounding them, feeling a mix of awe and confusion. The air was filled with the cacophony of parrots, cuckoos, hawks, and many other birds, while various animals like jaguars and armadillos roamed the land. The symphony of sounds was overwhelming, with parakeets screeching alongside buzzing insects and croaking frogs. The narrator emphasized that the reader couldn't truly grasp the intensity of the jungle noises. Amidst this chaos, the group settled near a shed by a lake infested with alligators. As night fell, they braved the mosquito bites and alligator snorts, eventually resting in hammocks. The next morning, the Senhor Antonio and his team of slaves prepared for an alligator hunt, fueled by a breakfast of alligator-tail. The slaves waded into the shallow waters armed with long poles, a perilous task that amazed Martin and Barney. Despite the dangers, accidents were rare, and the hunt began with Sambo leading the way, warning of an alligator named Jim who could leap down their throats.|['1.

Sambo, a skilled alligator hunter, swiftly subdued a massive twenty-foot alligator that emerged from the lake. With a swift thump and a strategic blow, he directed the beast towards the shore. A group of Negroes awaited the alligator's arrival, expertly ensnaring it with a lasso. Despite the creature's fierce resistance, they managed to restrain it and render it harmless. Sambo's triumph was evident as he swiftly subdued the alligator. Meanwhile, Barney, inspired by the Negroes' expertise, attempted to lasso an alligator himself, causing a comical mishap. Laughter erupted among the group, and even the alligators were stirred up in the chaos. Ultimately, the captured alligators were processed for their fat, which was melted down into oil.

While exploring the Amazon, Martin and Barney encountered fascinating fish species. The pirarucu, a large fish covered in beautiful red-spotted scales, impressed them. They also learned about the peixe boi, a cow-fish with unique features like fleshy lips and milk-producing breasts. The cow-fish is harpooned for its fat and tasty meat. The adventurers were surprised by a fish that exploded when stepped on. Startled, they thought it was an earthquake but discovered it was a fish that inflates and bursts with a loud noise.

Barney and Martin found shelter in a rudely constructed hut near the Amazon river. As they settled in, ominous clouds gathered, signaling the start of the rainy season. Soon, a dried-up alligator emerged from the hut's floor, surprising them. The rain poured heavily, causing the roof to collapse, and the river to flood the hut. Suspended in their hammocks over the rising water, they realized the unique challenges of living in the Amazon's _Gapo_ region, where the land transforms into an extensive lake during the rainy season. The natives adapt to this by living on rafts and in canoes, becoming almost aquatic. The area is home to distinctive animals and trees, with the natives expertly navigating the flooded landscape using subtle clues left by previous travelers.|"['1.

Due to the sudden start of the rainy season, the old trader decided to return to a nearby village for several months. Martin and Barney were frustrated by this as Martin wanted to explore further inland, and Barney dreamt of visiting the diamond mines, even though he had no idea where they were. Eventually, their stay in the dull village came to an end as the old trader announced the flood had peaked, and they could resume their journey. They set off in their canoe with their belongings, including their animal companions Marmoset and Grampus.

After gathering enough fruit, the group continued their journey. They sailed into a sunny grassy lake teeming with lilies and unique water plants. Among these were little yellow bladder-worts and other unknown plants, including one with a thick stalk, curious leaves, and bright blue flowers. Passing the lake, they entered the dark forest again, paddling among tall tree trunks rising from the water. Despite the gloom, they found amusement in the bustling animal life. Birds fed overhead, with parrots, blue chatterers, and toucans adding color to the scene. Bright-yellow flowers adorned the trees, along with white, spotted, and purple blossoms. The group then reached the main Amazon stream, where waterfowl and floating islands of grass drifted by. Hungry, they longed for solid ground to cook a meal, settling for farina and water.

Though he avoided close friendships to focus on his mission, he was kind to all. A tall silent Indian shadowed him, ensuring his movements. The tribe prepared for a feast focused on drinking and dancing, rather than eating. Women adorned in paint and flowers brewed an intoxicating drink from maize. The chief performed rituals before drinking, followed by the others. Martin pitied the tribe's debased state, recalling the need for the Bible in Brazil as he left the scene.|"['1.

During his walks near the Indian village, Martin found beautiful spots where he liked to go in the evenings after work, always followed by his vigilant friend, the tall savage. One favorite spot was under a banana tree on a cliff overlooking a valley and distant mountains. Martin saw these mountains as the gates of his prison, with great campos and forests beyond, where the Portuguese lived, and further on, what he thought was the Atlantic Ocean. Desperate to escape, Martin planned to jump off the cliff into a pool below, making it seem like an accident. He aimed to land on a narrow rock near a whirlpool, the only place to climb to safety. The risky plan required him to face death twice, but he was determined to outwit his pursuers.|"[""1.

Martin knew the terrain well, having been there before. His challenge was to jump over the cliff in a way that seemed accidental to the Indian watching him. If he succeeded, the savages would assume he drowned and not search for him. Luckily, there was a ledge covered in shrubs just below the edge where he needed to land. It was a risky plan, but the thought of freedom gave him courage. With a loud scream, Martin fell onto the ledge and then leaped into the water below. The Indian, thinking Martin was gone, rushed to the edge only to see his hat vanish in the water. Martin, however, managed to grab onto a rock and escape the vortex. Grateful for his escape, he planned to return to the Indian village at night to get supplies, risking capture but driven by necessity.|"[""1.

After a daring escape from an Indian village, Martin found himself in a safe spot near a cool mountain stream. He had gathered essential items for survival, like farina, a knife, and a bow with arrows. As he rested and prepared breakfast, he reflected on his escape and the pet he had left behind. Suddenly, a monkey appeared, reminding him of his beloved Marmoset left in the village. Regret filled his heart as he realized he had forgotten his loyal companion in the rush to flee danger.

In the forest, Martin made cakes on a stone over a fire. Suddenly, a snake slithered by. Martin, scared, killed it with his axe. After a simple breakfast, he slept in a hammock. Later, he continued his journey, reaching a swampy area with alligators. Unable to sleep due to mosquitoes, he climbed a tree to rest. From there, he saw a jaguar attacking an alligator. The alligator fought back, dragging the jaguar into the water. Martin watched in awe. As Martin traveled through the forest, he faced various challenges and met with unique experiences, surviving on game and fruits.

One evening, while walking in a beautiful country with lakes and streams, Martin encountered a terrifying tapir. This large animal, resembling a mix of an elephant and a hog, had a tough, brownish-black hide and a long nose with a short proboscis. Despite its appearance, the tapir was peaceful and timid, fleeing from danger. Martin, feeling defenseless with his arrows, shot at the tapir to no avail. The tapir, unharmed, quickly retreated. On another occasion, Martin encountered the great ant-eater, which feasted on ants with its long tongue. Not wanting to harm the creature, Martin observed its unique feeding habits and continued on his journey through the forest. Eventually, he found a beaten track, bringing hope of civilization, and spent a restful Sabbath day beside it, reflecting on his solitude and the importance of rest.|"['1.

The next day, after breakfast, he got ready to leave. He was unsure which way to go as the path didn't align with his previous direction. While pondering, he heard voices and felt a mix of hope and fear. He hid behind a tree as a group of Brazilians on horses approached. He explained his journey, seeking a way to the sea or a town for work. A Brazilian offered a spare horse, and they headed towards a diamond mine. The overseer, Baron Fagoni, was fond of English speakers but needed an interpreter. The Brazilian, offering to be the interpreter, led him to the mines. The overseer initially seemed irritable and locked him up, but later surprised him with a grand supper, leaving Martin puzzled by the eccentricity of his host.|"['1.

"Martin couldn't tolerate the situation. ""Sir,"" he exclaimed, rising abruptly, ""if this is a prank, it's gone far enough. If you are truly holding me here against my will, basic decency should prevent you from compounding the offense with insult."" The Baron didn't respond to Martin's stern words. Instead, he suddenly embraced Martin with such force that it nearly crushed him. ""Oh, my dear boy, bless your face! It's really you, no mistake! Stay put, Martin dear.

Baron Fagoni had a challenging time with his captors. Separated from his friend Martin, he was bound and taken to a village in the mountains. Imprisoned for weeks, he tried to communicate with an old Indian woman who brought him food. One day, she dropped a knife, hinting at escape. Seizing the opportunity, Baron Fagoni cut his bonds and fled into the forest. Pursued by the savages, he stumbled upon a river and was about to swim when he heard a waterfall downstream. Terrified, he backtracked, waded upstream, and climbed a tree to hide among the dense foliage. The savages searched the riverbanks but failed to find him.

Barney's heart sank as he sat catching his breath in the tree, knowing he'd be found soon. He decided to act boldly. Sliding down, he sprinted back towards the village, blending in on the main path. Dodging a few pursuers, he hid until they passed. Then, he circled the village and dashed into the woods opposite his original path. Following a trail away from the village, he reached a wide river. Spotting a canoe, he swiftly launched it, paddling downstream. The current carried him fast, narrowly avoiding rocks. After hours, he joined a trading canoe, unable to speak English but offering help. They reached a town where Barney briefly worked in the rubber shoe industry. Unhappy, he joined traders heading to the diamond districts, facing various challenges before reaching the mines. Disappointed by the reality of diamond mining, he decided to head to the coast and set sail, regretting leaving his companion Grampus behind.|['1.

Barney took Martin to visit the diamond mines the next morning. On the way, they saw a group of slaves warming by a fire in the cold weather of July, one of the coldest months in Brazil. In this region, summer and winter are reversed. The diamond district, Minas Geraes, is a wealthy province where most people are involved in mining or supplying miners. The miners and shopkeepers are the main groups, with shopkeepers having a more stable income. Mining can be uncertain, with some miners spending a lot of money and time without much success. The merchants, on the other hand, profit by selling goods to miners and exchanging them for diamonds and gold. The poor miners continue to dig in hope of finding valuable gems. Barney explained the mining process to Martin as they watched the slaves washing the earth for diamonds.|['1.

In Brazil, slaves once searched for diamonds in the _lavadeira_ canal. They carefully washed cascalho in wooden platters to find the precious gems. Sometimes, they found many diamonds in one plate, bringing luck to their day. The overseers collected the diamonds in a plate for selling in Rio Janeiro. Barney, a worker, shared tales of fortunes made from diamonds. He told of Juiz de Paz, who sold a big diamond for £6000 but learned it was worth much more.

"While conversing inside the cottage, they heard voices outside, possibly arguing. Suddenly, a man rushed in with an interpreter. ""Alright,"" whispered Barney to the interpreter, ""give him what he needs."" After seeing the Brazilian out, Barney resumed smoking his pipe. The man seemed suspicious, possibly involved in theft, but Barney had horses to sell and accepted his money. Barney and Martin planned to head to the coast soon.

"The jump was bound to happen. Martin leaped like a deer, while Barney, gripping the saddle, charged like lightning. In the heat of the moment, he bellowed, ""Hoist all sails! Stun-sails and sky-scrapers! Keep her steady! Hooray!"" Barney was lucky to grab onto the saddle; he was struck hard by the horse's head during the leap, but managed to stay on as it cleared the ditch. Later that day, Martin and Barney, feeling sore from their horseback ride, rested by a fire on the campo. Despite the discomfort, they found joy in the beauty of the plain.

Barney and Martin sought water in the woods after securing their horses. Startled by Barney's serious tone, Martin rushed to him. Barney stood somberly over a man's lifeless body. They found gold and diamonds in the man's possession, suspecting he died of illness. Despite the treasure, Barney insisted on giving the man a proper burial. They dug a grave, laid him to rest, and rode on. Their journey took them through diverse landscapes, from open fields to dense forests and steep hills.

Barney sang and danced until he collapsed on the grass, exhausted. Martin struggled to resist joining him, mesmerized by the vast ocean shimmering in the setting sun. The calm sea, like a mirror, was a breathtaking sight for the two sailors who had been away from the ocean for nearly two years. The distant sea was still far from where they stood on the Serra dos Orgos. But with their sturdy horses, they swiftly made their way to the beautiful bay of Rio de Janeiro. In Rio, Barney handed over the gold and diamonds he found to his employer, who generously rewarded him and his friend. The two sailors sold the bag of treasure they found on the dead man, as its rightful owner couldn't be traced. Barney's friend purchased it at full price, and as they boarded a ship back home, each had four hundred pounds in their pockets. Martin's mind wandered back to his adventures on the coast, recalling encounters with various animals and the hermit's cottage. He remembered sailing the Amazon, facing wild Indians, and discovering diamond mines. As he snapped back to reality, he found himself surrounded by the vast sea. Arthur Jollyboy, a businessman in Bilton, pondered over a large sock order and playfully grappled with his clerk in excitement. His thoughts drifted to Mrs. Grumbit, who had disappeared after losing hope upon Martin's absence. Despite his efforts to find her, she had vanished.|['1.

Martin listened quietly to the story, then abruptly stood up, shook Mr. Jollyboy's hand, and declared he was off to Liverpool, promising a reunion. Rushing out with his friend, they reached Ashford village in no time. Martin, yearning to see his childhood home, found it deserted, evoking a deep sadness. Overwhelmed, he wept on the doorstep.

Martin left the room and returned with warm soup and a roll for Aunt Dorothy, who eagerly ate. She fell asleep, and Martin sat by her side until she woke up. A young man entered, claiming to be a doctor sent by a policeman. Aunt Dorothy showed no surprise, embracing him as he wept. She thought it was a dream but felt it was real. With Martin's care, she recovered fully, returning home to Ashford. Her old chintz curtains and high-crowned cap were back, and a white kitten, the grand-daughter of her old one, joined her. They celebrated her return with a housewarming, where Aunt Dorothy quietly enjoyed tea and added sugar to Martin's cup. Martin became successful, caring for his aunt and learning the joy of giving.
