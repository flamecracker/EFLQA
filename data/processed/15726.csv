Bessie was shocked to hear Zara's story about running away from Hedgeville to escape a miser who wanted to bind her to work for him. Zara expressed gratitude for Bessie's help in finding her and preventing her from falling back into the miser's clutches. Bessie encouraged Zara to focus on the positive things in life to overcome the memories of the hardships she faced. Zara reflected on her tough experiences with Maw Hoover and the chores she had to do, realizing that it's the people, not the places, that determine happiness. Charlie Jamieson offered to be Zara's lawyer to help her father out of trouble, despite his skepticism about her father's honesty. Eleanor vouched for Charlie's legal skills but teased him about his busy schedule. Despite the challenges ahead, Zara remained hopeful for a better future.|"[""1.

The lawyer, Mr. Jamieson, warned Zara to be cautious as there seemed to be hidden dangers in Hedgeville. He advised her not to go out alone and to ignore anyone who tries to talk to her. He emphasized the importance of seeking help from the police if anyone bothers her. Mr. Jamieson assured Zara that if she mentioned his name to the police, they would assist her. Zara shared her concerns about the mysterious circumstances surrounding her parents' disappearance. She revealed that they had left her with the Hoovers in Hedgeville, promising to return for her but eventually stopped communicating. This left Zara feeling uncertain about her parents' fate and the secrets that may be lurking in the shadows.|"['1.

Eleanor Mercer was upset, expressing how unfairly Bessie was treated by the Hoovers, who made her work without pay. Bessie shared that while Maw Hoover called her lazy, it was actually Maw and Jake who made her life difficult. Jamieson pointed out that Bessie had every right to leave since she wasn't officially adopted. They discussed the challenge of proving the Hoovers were unfit guardians. They were concerned about unknown individuals like Weeks being involved. Jamieson suspected Weeks might have been motivated by money to keep Zara accessible. They speculated on possible reasons for secrecy, including political influence. Despite the uncertainties, Jamieson vowed to work diligently to uncover the truth.|"[""1.

Bessie smiled at the young lawyer's strong feelings and Zara's approving glance. She believed Jake lingered to seek revenge on her. Jamieson warned that Jake must behave or face consequences without his mother's protection. Bessie doubted Jake could afford to stay in the city long without his mother's money. The lawyer hoped Jake would leave soon, but Eleanor suggested keeping Bessie and Zara close due to being spied on. Eleanor assured them they were welcome guests, not charity cases. Bessie appreciated Eleanor's kindness, acknowledging that few would do the same. Eleanor's trust in people differed from Bessie's skepticism.

Bessie observed Jake Hoover's suspicious behavior from the porch as he stealthily trailed Mr. Jamieson. She decided to take action and called Mr. Jamieson's office to warn his clerk to meet him and alert him of the situation. Left alone, Bessie, once fearful of Jake's past bullying, now feared the trouble he might cause. Remembering a past incident where she had outsmarted Jake, she summoned the courage to follow him and uncover his intentions. As she ventured through the unfamiliar city streets, the peaceful suburban setting gradually transformed into a bustling area with streetcars and pedestrians. Despite the changing surroundings, Bessie remained determined to keep an eye on Jake and ensure Zara's safety.|"[""1.

Bessie found herself in a bustling city, trying to evade Jake's notice as she maneuvered through the crowded streets. She had relied on trees for cover, but as she neared the city center, the urban landscape offered no such refuge. Surrounded by a sea of people, she felt a sense of protection in the anonymity of the crowd. Despite the chaos of trolley cars and vehicles, she pressed on, determined to keep Jake in sight. However, in the heart of the city, she lost track of him near a busy square. Feeling lost and worried about her absence from her group, Bessie decided to head back home. As she walked, she paused to glance at a store window, only to be startled by Farmer Weeks accusing her of theft. Frozen in fear, she couldn't move or speak, caught in a moment of unexpected danger.|"[""1.

As Farmer Weeks raised his voice, calling for a policeman, Bessie learned a lesson in how city crowds can be captivated by anything unusual, no matter how small. The already crowded pavement swelled with more people, forming a ring around them, eager to see what was happening. Farmer Weeks pretended to be a naive countryman, dressed in old-fashioned attire, while Bessie, in her new clothes, passed as a city girl. Despite her fear, she found humor in Weeks' antics to gain sympathy from the crowd. Just then, Tom Norris, a friendly train conductor who had helped them before, arrived and demanded Weeks to let Bessie go. The crowd backed Norris, showing support against Weeks' unfair treatment of Bessie. The situation escalated until a real policeman arrived, diffusing the tension.|"['1.

"""Run away! I never said I'd give you any money,"" Farmer Weeks told Norris, glancing nervously at the crowd. The people, who had initially supported him, now sided with the upset newsboy. The boy, while angrily demanding his payment, clung to Weeks' arm. Reluctantly, Weeks took out a purse and handed the boy five pennies. A policeman intervened, dispersing the crowd and questioning Weeks about the commotion. Weeks accused Bessie of theft, but Tom defended her, asserting that Weeks was dishonest. The policeman discovered that Weeks' wallet was empty, revealing his deceit. Fearing the consequences, Weeks released Bessie and fled as the crowd gasped at the unfolding events."|"['1.

"""That's a good riddance. Maybe he'll go home and stay there,"" said the conductor. ""He won't try his dirty tricks on you again,"" he added, turning to Bessie. ""If he does, you'll have a friend in Mike, here.""

""I'm glad you turned up, boy. You saved me from making a fool of myself,"" said the policeman. ""To think he'd put up a job like that on a slip of a girl, and him old enough to be her father--or her grandfather!""

With Tom Norris by her side, Bessie started her journey back to the Mercer house. She shared her adventures since leaving Hedgeville with him.

""I thought I might be able to help. I didn't like to see him following Mr. Jamieson,"" Bessie explained.

Jamieson, surprised to see Bessie, listened intently to her story. ""They might try to get hold of Miss Bessie as a witness,"" the conductor added. ""A good lawyer keeps his clients out of court,"" Jamieson remarked. ""It's the shyster lawyers, like Isaac Brack, who are always going to court.""

Jamieson identified the person he believed was spying on him and expressed his determination to counter their actions. He acknowledged that the spy had been cautious but felt confident in his ability to outsmart them. Bessie, although puzzled by Zara's behavior, respected her friend's need for privacy. Zara, distressed but secretive, refused to disclose the cause of her distress. Despite Bessie's efforts to comfort her, Zara remained unwilling to share. Bessie, realizing the importance of giving Zara space, decided to leave her alone. When asked about Zara's condition, Bessie explained that Zara preferred to be left alone until she felt better.

Looking out of the window, Bessie saw a big green car speeding away from the Mercer house. She was frozen in place, unable to move or shout. However, she managed to memorize the car's number - 4587.

Frustrated, Eleanor decided that Zara and her father would have to fend for themselves if they didn't want help.

The conductor chuckled, mentioning the motorman, Hank, who swiftly started the car due to morning excitement. Bessie worried about being connected to the car theft accusation.

Excitedly studying the map, the group felt disheartened as they realized there were no stops between their current station and Tecumseh. However, Dolly had a clever plan. Hank, the conductor, had to make an unscheduled stop that day. He slyly suggested that they could discreetly disembark when the car halted, and he wouldn't notice. With a quick wave goodbye to the conductor, they followed Dolly's directions, confident they could reach Tecumseh safely. Bessie made a commitment to avoid indulging in soda or candy between meals, feeling it was better for her health.
