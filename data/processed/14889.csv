"Margery firmly stated, ""I wouldn't do that. I'd do what makes me happy. It wouldn't be right for Tommy to leave us alone all summer. Tommy, say you won't go unless we can come too.""

The car raced around the bend, startling Miss Elting, who screamed in alarm. Grace, hearing the scream, misunderstood it as a friendly greeting and waved back. Miss Elting frantically gestured and pointed to warn them. The two girls on the hill froze in fear momentarily. Suddenly, Grace realized the danger and turned towards the oncoming car enveloped in dust. With no time to stop, the car and Tommy locked eyes. Hazel sprinted down the hill, followed by Tommy, to aid Miss Elting. Margery, gathering her courage, rose and followed at a slower pace. Unexpectedly, Margery tripped on a fence, falling near Grace.

"""Tommy, why did you come up here, Miss Elting?"" asked Tommy, eyeing the teacher suspiciously. ""Do you want us to go for another nice little walk? No, thank you. I've walked with you before. Thank you very kindly. My feet are too sore and Buthter is too tired. Harriet's brother says that Buthter was born with that tired feeling. I guess he's right. Don't you think so, Miss Elting? Sit down and rest, and I'll tell your fortune with a daisy.""

Just then, the car that had caused all the trouble came honking towards them, slowing down with a series of loud bangs. The young woman driving the car leaped out, ran to Grace, and hugged her tightly. ""Oh, my darling, my darling. My blessed little Tommy. Did I almost hit you? Wasn't it just glorious the way I dodged the old thing? I knew it was going to be a close shave, but I made up my mind I'd beat them out even if I took off the hind wheels of my car. Get in, you dears. I'll drive you home.""

For a good while, they walked through the woods, tripping over vines and bumping into trees but managing to stay on the log road. Night birds' calls startled Margery and Tommy, making them anxious. The forest at night is filled with strange sounds, and the girls heard them all. Without their guardian, some might have panicked. Suddenly, a scuffle broke out when Harriet mistook Jasper for something else in the dark. Laughter followed the tension release, except for Tommy, too scared to speak. Jasper, annoyed, explained he was resting on the suitcases. As they neared a fire, Harriet noticed the fire safety measures, learning a lesson in woodcraft.

They walked along a dark path in the deep forest, with towering trees above them. Margery was out of breath, and Tommy whimpered occasionally to show her discomfort. The final stretch felt never-ending. The Meadow-Brook Girls hadn't eaten since morning, except for a cold lunch from Miss Elting.

During the day that just passed, Harriet barely spoke with Patricia and Cora. Patricia was Harriet's age, while Cora was a bit older and had a proud demeanor, unlike the typical Camp Girl. When bedtime came, Harriet bid them good night as she settled into her cot. The girls were slower to sleep, and a reminder from a guardian about lights out prompted them to quickly extinguish the lantern and get to bed. Harriet heard them talking but didn't ask for silence. In the dark, figures entered the tent where Harriet and her friend Tommy slept. There was a sudden commotion, and Harriet found herself restrained. Realizing it was a prank by fellow campers, she cooperated. Tommy, on the other hand, resisted fiercely and was taken away from the camp.

Startled, Harriet realized the cries were Tommy's, meant to stir the camp and expose the fleeing girls. Tommy's plan caused a commotion as girls rushed out of their tents in panic.

When the lesson ended, it was time for lunch. The girls spoke quietly, carrying on conversations in hushed tones. Harriet noticed Miss Elting's distance from Grace and herself, feeling hurt by the avoidance. Miss Elting refrained from discussing the hazing incident, leaving it for the Chief Guardian to address. Later that afternoon, a group of girls gathered around a tree, appearing excited. Patricia hinted at a mysterious aspect to the situation, suggesting that the two girls involved might have orchestrated the commotion.

The dinner that evening was filled with anticipation, setting a tense atmosphere before a crucial event. As darkness approached, the Council Fire blazed brightly, casting light among the trees. The girls emerged from their tents in ceremonial khaki costumes adorned with leather, shells, and beads. Each bead symbolized an earned honor, and emblems on their sleeves represented their roles. The Meadow-Brook Girls awaited their costumes, causing disappointment. Harriet, skilled with a needle, planned to create her own. A procession led by a Torch Bearer approached the campfire, signaling the beginning of an inquiry. Harriet, lost in thought, was reminded to join. The ceremony was both unusual and impactful, leaving Harriet pondering the camp's future. She was called forward, unsure of what lay ahead.|"['1.

Harriet positioned herself near the fire, letting its light highlight her features against the dark night. Despite the intense scrutiny, she remained composed. The Chief Guardian addressed her solemnly, discussing recent camp incidents. Six girls confessed to hazing new campers, unaware of the severity. The culprits who initiated the hazing remained unknown. The girls received mysterious notes, leading them to Harriet's tent for initiation. No one claimed responsibility for the notes.

Since arriving at Camp Wau-Wau, I have been exhausted. The moment I hit the bed, I'm out like a light. Last night, I barely woke up before tripping over a tent rope in response to the alarm. It was quite the jolt. The guardians have made a decision about the six girls who confessed. While they can't act on the others yet, they believe the six acted in jest, not malice. So, the remaining campers will vote on their punishment. Despite some objections, the penalty of 24-hour solitary confinement in their tents was imposed. Harriet received honors for her bravery and forgiving nature. The Council Fire session ended with Harriet feeling sorrow for the girls facing punishment and those who didn't confess. She understood the difficulty of admitting guilt but knew honesty was key.|['1.

Miss Elting smiled warmly at Harriet, choosing to speak to her as a friend rather than a guardian at Camp Wau-Wau. She reassured Harriet that if someone else had made a discovery like hers after denying involvement, they wouldn't be obligated to inform the Chief Guardian. Miss Elting suggested letting things be for now, hoping the guilty party's conscience would lead them to confess. As they walked back to camp, they encountered Patricia Scott, who showed clear disdain towards Harriet. Miss Elting noticed this unfriendly behavior. Harriet then asked about a tall tree's safety from lightning, but their conversation was interrupted by a reckless driver approaching the camp.

Mrs. Livingston decided to wait until the next morning to solve the mystery of the tampered soup. If the culprit didn't confess by then, they would launch an investigation. The Chief Guardian and the girls left the tent, sparking excited conversations. Most defended Harriet, doubting she would sabotage her own chances at winning an honor.

Patricia quickly stood up, her eyes fierce and her hands clenched tightly. She noticed the Chief Guardian approaching and paused in her anger towards Crazy Jane, who had ignored her earlier.

"Harriet lay completely still. Her breath was barely noticeable. Suddenly, an animal emerged from the shadows and paused with its ears perked up, almost standing between her and the campfire. ""Oh, it's just a big dog,"" she muttered. Unconcerned by the unusual presence of a dog in such a remote area, she spoke aloud, startling the creature.

Guardians warned them to run, but the girls ran towards the intruder, causing the bear confusion. Bruin, a young bear, panicked and fled towards the stream after Jane hit it with the chair rung. Harriet then singed the bear's hip with a torch, prompting it to leap into the creek. Jasper tried to intercept, but his axe fell short.
