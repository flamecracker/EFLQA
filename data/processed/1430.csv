In life, some seek honor, love, and friendship in old age, but find curses instead. Dreams can be ambitions, but often they are just shadows. Ambition can be dangerous, leading angels astray. Love others and be humble, for arrogance can be a downfall. Sometimes those who say little are seen as wise, but if they spoke, they might reveal ignorance.

People can offer comfort, but true understanding comes from experiencing pain. Conscience can hinder action, and habits can be both good and bad. Love all, trust few, harm none.
