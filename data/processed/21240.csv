The smoke from the wagons has mostly dissipated, leaving a faint haze lingering around them. The bandits are now rummaging through the boxes and bales, some of which are charred from the fire. Their leader, with a stern command, stops them from scalping the dead. In just a few minutes, Wilder and Hamersley sneak out and ride away. The man with the beard, speaking Spanish, stops inspecting the corpses and looks puzzled. A cry from outside signals an enemy trying to flee. The man hurries out and sees two riders in the distance heading towards the cliffs. He mounts his horse and races after them, determined to catch one of them. He had a plan to use the smoke as cover, but soon realizes it won't last. The pursuers are closing in, and the fugitives must change direction to avoid the cliffs.|"['1.

"What should they do now? Ride out from the smoke-cloud or stay under its shelter? Either way, they risk being discovered and chased. The smoke was clearing fast, and the Indians were putting out the fires to protect the treasure they were after. The men knew they would soon be visible from the wagons. Without hesitation, they turned their horses left, racing along the bluff. They emerged from the smoke into bright sunlight, but the joy was short-lived. A yell from the savages signaled they were spotted, and a group of horsemen was galloping towards them. A cliff promontory lay ahead, closer to the pursuers than to them.

Frank Hamersley reluctantly abandoned his loyal horse, a magnificent creature from Kentucky, renowned for its superior breed. The horse seemed to understand the impending separation, expressing affection and confusion through a soft neigh. Despite the emotional bond between them from many shared journeys, Hamersley had to leave his steed behind due to the urgent pursuit by armed men. As the guide directed him towards safety, Hamersley hesitated, torn between his attachment to his horse and the need to escape. With a heavy heart, he let go of the reins, watching his horse gallop away as the pursuers closed in. The guide, also on foot, urged Hamersley to hurry towards safety, while struggling to guide his own reluctant horse through a narrow passage in the cliff.|"['1.

The guide pulled out his knife, stained with blood, and slashed the horse's throat, forming a gruesome barricade against attackers. With the rifle ready, the guide prepared to defend against approaching enemies. Despite the temporary safety, the group faced a grim fate, trapped without escape. The guide revealed a hidden passage to evade the encroaching danger. The plan involved distracting the enemy to make a swift escape through the cliffs.

"""It's all done now,"" said the guide, turning away from the carcass and crouching to where his comrade waited. ""Come on, Frank. If they don't discover the trick till we've got time to speed up the cliff, then there's still a chance for us. Come on, and keep close after me!""

Hamersley followed without a word. He trusted Wilder, knowing there was a reason for everything. Danger lay ahead, but certain death behind.

In less than a dozen paces, the chine opened into a wider space, closing like a pair of callipers. It was an elliptical hollow, surrounded by precipitous sides, except for the sloping ravine above. The narrow outlet to the open plain hinted at its formation, with ferruginous veins in the sandstone telling tales of time.

As they ascended the rock-strewn gorge, hope flickered. Reaching the summit-level of the cliff could give them an advantage. The contest of speed with their savage pursuers would be on foot, where the white men believed they had the upper hand."|"[""1.

As they climbed the cliff, hope filled their hearts. Dodging bullets and arrows, they pressed on, their escape within reach. Suddenly, cries echoed behind them, urging them to hasten. Concealed by rocks, they were safe for now. But the path split, causing a dilemma. After a quick survey, they chose the right fork, leaving a marker to mislead their pursuers. The ascent seemed simple until it led to a dead-end platform. With the Indians closing in, they searched for a hiding spot. A dark crevice caught their eye, resembling a well opening. Quietly, they descended into the narrow shaft, disappearing without a trace. The cavity proved treacherous, requiring careful maneuvering to avoid a deadly fall. Slowly and cautiously, they descended, aware of the perilous drop below.|"['1.

They stopped around thirty feet from the top to hide quickly. They were cautious as they knew the Indians might be above and could hear them. The hope was that the Indians would think they had gone left to the plain above. The Indians would search both parts of the ravine, and if they suspected the two in the shaft, they would be in trouble. They found a ledge to stand on in the darkness, trying not to make a sound. They saw the Indians above, talking about vengeance. The Indians split up, with one group following the false path and the others coming up the correct one. The fugitives were lucky to find the hole, avoiding capture. They entered a grotto, safe from the stones the Indians threw. The Indians paused, planning their next move.

The narrow entrance to the cave barely allowed a man to pass through. Hamersley noticed smoke rising from a fire near the opening. Suddenly, falling debris filled the shaft, followed by suffocating smoke. Realizing it was toxic stink-weed smoke, they used a coat to block the entrance. They held the coat tightly to prevent the deadly fumes from entering. They remained silent, knowing the Indians above would wait until they were sure of their demise. The Indians hesitated, unsure if the men were in the shaft. The men endured the bitter smoke, relying on their wits to outsmart the Indians. The sounds of burning brush being thrown in stopped, signaling the Indians may think they had succeeded in their plan.|['1.

The red-skinned fumigators stopped their cruel task, leaving their victims in silence. Suddenly, a rumbling noise and a crash indicated something terrible. A thick substance oozed in, but it started thinning and rising like smoke up a chimney. As the danger seemed to pass, the fugitives cautiously considered leaving their shelter.

For a brief moment, Wilder's clever trick slowed down the pursuers. However, the Indians quickly caught on to the deception. As they split up to search the area, the tube and cap trick failed to fool them. They swiftly moved up the ravine, seizing Wilder's rifle and continuing their pursuit. They paused briefly at a red kerchief, suspicious of another trick. Splitting into two groups, one went left and the other right, eventually discovering the hiding spot of the fugitives.

Following the chief's orders, some gathered the bodies of their fallen comrades for burial. However, others, acting independently, continued to desecrate the white victims' bodies, mutilating them further. They decapitated the victims, impaling their heads on spears, tossing them around, and laughing maniacally. The intense anger from unexpected resistance led to this gruesome display. The bodies were subjected to brutal treatment, slashed with tomahawks, pierced with spears, and beaten with clubs. The scene turned bizarre when the contents of wagons were distributed among the group. The Horned Lizard oversaw the allocation, favoring himself and his companion with luxurious fabrics, while the rest settled for simpler items. The Indians then drank whisky from the caravan, leading to intoxication and a gambling game involving horse-tail tug-of-war to determine ownership of goods.|"[""1.

Some non-gamblers, driven by mischief and amusement, tie their belongings and race across the land, leaving tracks far behind. In their wild play, they forget their fallen comrades, still unburied. They cheer, yell, and laugh until the cliffs echo their demonic joy. A rare and original riot—a true savage revelry. They now realize the cause of the strange noise that puzzled them—the rumbling followed by a crash. It wasn't an accidental cliff collapse, but a deliberate act—a massive rock rolled by the united strength of the savages to seal off a shaft. The two trapped men, resigned to their fate, understood they were entombed alive. The guide's futile attempts to move the rock revealed its immovability. Hamersley inspected the rock's edge in darkness, feeling the warm remains of a fire used for fumigation. The rock snugly sealed the opening, leaving them to perish in the dark catacomb.|"['1.

The two men found themselves trapped in a shaft, surrounded by rock. The Kentuckian suspected it was either lime or sandstone. Feeling the rock, he confirmed it was sandstone, a soft material that could help them escape. With determination, they began chipping away at the stone using a knife. The dull echo of the steel against the rock indicated their chances of breaking free. Despite the challenges, they remained hopeful, planning to quarry their way out while the Indians were distracted. The Kentuckian's knowledge of the boulder's size would aid their escape. With a mix of guesswork and determination, they started cutting the stone, knowing time was of the essence. As they worked, they were cautious of the stink-weed that drifted into their alcove, a reminder of the dangers surrounding them.|"['Question 1: What type of rock did the Kentuckian suspect they were surrounded by in the shaft?\nA) Granite\nB) Limestone\nC) Sandstone\nD) Marble\nE) Basalt', 'Question 2: How did the two men plan to escape from the shaft?\nA) By climbing the walls\nB) By calling for help\nC) By chipping away at the sandstone\nD) By waiting for the Indians to rescue them\nE) By using explosives to break free', 'Question 3: What sound indicated the progress the men were making in breaking free?\nA) Loud banging\nB) Soft murmurs\nC) Dull echo of steel against rock\nD) High-pitched ringing\nE) Complete silence', 'Question 4: Why did the men choose to quarry their way out while the Indians were distracted?\nA) To have a competition with the Indians\nB) To find a hidden treasure\nC) To avoid confrontation with the Indians\nD) To trade with the Indians\nE) To learn from the Indians', ""Question 5: What did the stink-weed drifting into their alcove serve as a reminder of?\nA) Fresh air outside the shaft\nB) The presence of water nearby\nC) The dangers surrounding them\nD) The need for a break\nE) The Indians' cooking nearby"", ""Question 6: What was the Kentuckian's knowledge of the boulder's size supposed to help with?\nA) Finding a way to communicate with the Indians\nB) Planning their next meal\nC) Aiding their escape\nD) Starting a fire\nE) Keeping track of time""]"|['C) Sandstone', 'C) By chipping away at the sandstone', 'C) Dull echo of steel against rock', 'C) To avoid confrontation with the Indians', 'C) The dangers surrounding them', 'C) Aiding their escape']
Walt wanted to help Hamersley at work but was refused. Hamersley was cautious, not wanting to be heard by any lingering savages. Wilder waited below anxiously, unable to see what was happening. Hamersley had let some light in but cutting a path out was proving difficult. He noticed a draft coming from below, suggesting a possible escape route. They descended the shaft and found themselves at a wider point, making further progress risky. Wilder dropped a powder-horn to gauge the distance, hearing it hit something soft.

As they played blind-man's buff, the sudden appearance of light ended the game. A stream of light entered through a side gallery, guiding them to an opening big enough for escape. Despite hearing their enemies outside, they hesitated. The risk of being caught was high, but staying in the vault posed a different danger. Walt warned that the moonlight would expose them if they tried to leave at night. Wilder spotted a decoy they had left behind, realizing the savages had not taken the bait. They decided to exit through the aperture, creeping along a ledge back into the ravine. They pondered if they had chosen the right path to escape their pursuers.|"[""1.

"""I wish I could recover my rifle,"" Walt said anxiously as they fled. ""It's too valuable for the Indians to leave behind. It must have gone back to the wagons."" The shouts of their pursuers grew louder as they climbed. Walt whispered, ""We can't stay close to them, even if they're drunk. Let's put some distance between us. They might come after us next."" The two men reached the summit of the cliff, overlooking a vast plain. In the silence of the desert, they ran, hoping to escape the Indians.

Wilder quickly understands the situation without needing any explanation. In the dim light of the cave and the smoke from their escape, he hadn't noticed the blood soaking his companion's clothes. Hamersley, barely aware of his injury, begins to feel weak as the blood seeps from his side. The wound is serious, but Wilder, experienced in such matters, assures him it's not fatal. They find a hiding spot in the grass to rest. As the day wanes, they can finally stand again. The cool evening air revives them, and they continue under the cover of night, feeling rejuvenated and ready to move forward.|"[""1.

"""Great!"" exclaimed the guide. ""I'm happy to hear you speak that way. If we can put some miles between us and those noisy savages, we might have a chance of being saved yet. The worst part is, we don't know which way to go. It's a toss-up between them. If we turn back towards Canada, we might encounter them again, right in front of us. To the west lies the Del Norte settlement, but we might run into the same Indians if we go that way. I'm not sure if they're Tenawas. To the south lies the endless Staked Plain until you reach the Grand River, which is not ideal. Heading east, slightly south, we might reach the headwaters of the Louisiana Red River, and once on a running stream, we can navigate down it with a rifle, powder, and a few bullets.

Two men find themselves in a forest of shin oaks, perfect for hiding as the trees grow only 18 inches tall. Feeling safe from pursuers, they decide to rest until sunrise. One of the men, Walt, is restless due to the recent danger they faced. He is used to such perilous situations from his days as a Texas Ranger. Despite his anxiety, he falls into a deep sleep, only waking occasionally from nightmares. As dawn breaks, Walt wakes up, ready to assess the situation and ensure they are safe before continuing their journey southeast.

In the wilderness, two weary travelers, Hamersley and his giant companion, discuss the mysterious figures they encountered. Hamersley ponders the mixed heritage of the Comanche tribe and the outlaws among them. Despite the danger, they decide to press on, setting fire to their wagons to erase the evidence of their encounter. Dividing into two groups, the larger Tenawa Comanchey band led by Horned Lizard heads east, while the smaller party veers southwest. Their journey takes them past the Rio Pecos and Gran Quivira, an ancient Spanish town now in ruins. Zigzagging north-west, they aim to cross the Sierra Blanca towards the Del Norte valley, avoiding the well-known trail to remain undetected.|"['1.

One of the men in this group had a large beard and whiskers, while another had fewer of these features. The remaining two had no facial hair. All four men had dark bronze skin and appeared to be pure-blooded natives. The fact that the bearded men spoke Spanish did not necessarily mean they were not Indians since many Indians in New Mexican territory speak Castilian as well. The man with the beard, who seemed to be the leader and the tallest, had not left behind his share of the loot. It was being carried by seven mules, guided by the two men without beards who were skilled in handling the animals. The man with the beard rode a magnificent black horse, different from the Mexican mustangs his companions rode, showing it was the same horse Frank Hamersley had to abandon earlier.

As the two horsemen ventured into a mountain pass, the rocky terrain challenged their journey. The path wound through canyons and narrow clefts, barely accommodating the mules carrying their loads. Eventually, they halted in a rugged area branching off from the pass. Despite its untouched appearance, the horses and mules navigated it confidently. Beyond a large boulder that initially seemed impassable, a hidden entrance revealed a cavern within the cliff face. The riders and animals entered without hesitation. The following day, the party emerged transformed, now resembling peaceful merchants on a trading expedition. The leader, now dressed in town trader attire, signaled to continue their journey towards Albuquerque.

After traveling through the mountain defile, the group continued north-westward towards the Rio del Norte valley. The path was rugged, barely a bridle path marked by occasional tracks. As the sun set, they reached the broad plain of the valley. Riding through the night on a country road, they approached the village of Tome. From there, they headed north to Albuquerque. Disguised as traders, they quietly passed through the town towards a hacienda outside the suburbs. The guard let them in without questions. Inside, the Colonel and his companion celebrated their successful heist. The Colonel explained how he had information about the caravan's route and defense, keeping his lieutenant intrigued.

They would depart from Van Buren, Arkansas, taking a new route along the Canadian River towards New Mexico. The lieutenant praised the plan, comparing it to the strategies of great leaders. However, his expression turned bitter, hinting at hidden troubles. Meanwhile, two fugitives, weakened by hunger and thirst, struggled across the Llano Estacado.

Not far away, there are other living creatures that appear to be happy. Besides the shadows of the two men, there are also the silhouettes of large birds with dark feathers and red necks, known as _zopilotes_ in Mexico. These vultures are following the men, as if expecting a meal from their bones. Walt Wilder is worried but hides it from his companion, Frank Hamersley. The exhausted travelers continue silently, with Walt suggesting they eat the vultures to survive. He plans to go search for water in the hills nearby, leaving Frank with the task of cooking the bird.

Her attire is quite unique, matching her gear. Riding her mustang in a Mexican style, she carries a light gun slung over her shoulder. A woolen shawl drapes across her left shoulder, covering a velveteen vest. Below, an embroidered skirt leads to white calzoncillas over her booted feet. Despite her masculine appearance with the gun, her feminine features are evident in her delicate skin, petticoat skirt, and slender fingers. Accompanied by mastiff bloodhound dogs, she rides with grace. Suddenly, a bird startles her horse, prompting her to pause and observe a flock circling above.

A mile is traversed, and the birds are drawn closer, yet the hidden object remains unseen. It could be concealed among the artemisias or behind a tall yucca plant. As the rider nears the yucca, she slows her mustang to a walk. Witnessing the vultures circling above a spectacle of death evokes a mix of pity and awe in her. Approaching the scene, she notices a dead vulture impaled on the yucca's spikes. Thinking it was a person attracting the birds, she realizes it's only a fallen vulture. The rider contemplates whether the birds are mourning or planning to feast on their fallen comrade. Bloodhounds rush ahead, drawn by a scent more appealing to their nature. Amidst the confusion, a man emerges from the plant, startling the rider with a bloody knife. Despite her initial fear, she observes the man's pallor and demeanor, realizing he is not a threat.|['1.

During the peculiar speeches and actions, Frank Hamersley, standing in amazement, sees two large, fierce dogs, a strangely adorned horse, and a young girl in unique attire. Initially, he hears the threatening growls of bloodhounds followed by a sweet, melodious voice. Startled from his dream by the dogs, he now perceives an angelic figure instead of the previous demonic vision. Overcome by surprise, he almost falls until he grabs a yucca plant for support.

During the time leading up to New Mexico becoming part of the United States, the province was plagued by frequent revolutions, with military leaders often acting as dictators. The power of the military was oppressive, especially in the northern frontier provinces. The ongoing conflict between the priestly and patriotic factions fueled this chaos, with power shifting between them. New Mexico's fate mirrored that of the nation's capital, with the ruling party influencing the province. While periods of good governance occurred under the Patriots, corruption resurged when the Church-backed party regained control. The Church's vast wealth and influence, combined with superstition, ensured its dominance, leading to cycles of revolution and repression.

In the past, the soldiers in New Mexico had immense power due to the constant threat of hostile Indian tribes surrounding the province. The soldiers, led by the likes of Santa Anna and Manuel Armijo, abused their power by oppressing the citizens and secretly collaborating with the very enemies they were supposed to protect against. This abuse of power was rampant, with theft, murder, and oppression being common occurrences. Colonel Miranda, who briefly held power in Albuquerque, was removed due to the political turmoil caused by Santa Anna's rise to dictatorship. Despite his military successes, Colonel Gil Uraga is a deeply unhappy man, haunted by disappointment in a love affair and a thirst for vengeance. His misery is compounded by a scar across his face from a duel, serving as a constant reminder of his past mistakes.|"['1.

The colonel carefully plans his next move, ensuring secrecy and avoiding scandal. After dismissing the corporal, he interrogates the Indian prisoner, extracting valuable information about the valley where the exiles have sought refuge.

Pedrillo swiftly leaves the room upon receiving instructions, a malevolent glint in his slanted eyes indicating his dark purpose. The elevated plateau, Llano Estacado, stretches over three hundred miles in length with an average width of sixty to seventy miles. It runs between the former Spanish provinces of New Mexico and Texas, with their capitals, Santa Fe and San Antonia de Bejar, situated on opposite sides. In the past, a military road crossed this plateau connecting the two provinces, marked by tall stakes due to the shifting sands. This region was once safe for Spanish colonists, but as Spanish power waned, cities fell into ruin, and settlers had to fortify against Indian attacks. The old Spanish trail across the Staked Plain fell out of use, only traversed by US army expeditions in recent times for exploration.|"[""1.

The Texan Rangers faced a perilous journey towards the Llano Estacado. The absence of water and landmarks made getting lost a real danger.

Because of the rifle I gave to Senor Gualtero, he can keep both provisioned. He has managed to kill bits of birds skillfully, preserving their skins perfectly.

They listen intently, trying to locate the source of the sound. They realize it's coming from below. As they ponder this, they hear men's voices mixed with laughter, unlike anything they expected. The laughter is hearty, not like that of Mexicans or Spaniards. It sounds more like Celtic or Anglo-Saxon laughter. Then, they see horsemen approaching, not like Uraga's men but different, sparking gladness instead of fear. The men are ruggedly dressed, armed, and fearless. The sight surprises them, especially seeing a man tied up outside the hut. Despite the mystery, they advance without fear. Fifty men in somber attire, armed to the teeth, arrive at the house. Their appearance contrasts sharply with the previous troop. The ex-Ranger is electrified by their arrival, rushing out with a thunderous shout of joy. The renegade is equally shocked, recognizing Walt Wilder and Hamersley, who he thought had perished.|"[""1. What do the characters hear that surprises them?\nA. Mexican voices\nB.

Walt quickly shared the harrowing tale with his former companions, introducing Hamersley as his companion in the perilous ordeal.

They managed to keep moving forward until they reached the head of the valley, where a stream flowed between towering cliffs. The once small and clear brook they saw earlier had transformed into a deep, red, and roaring torrent. The water was white with froth, crashing against the cliffs on either side. The river had risen six feet, filling the entire channel. It was impossible to wade through, and swimming across would mean certain danger. Even the strongest horse or the mighty river-horse of Africa would be swept away. Hamersley and Walt Wilder realized the severity of the situation.

Colonel Uraga listened to his adjutant's advice on how to handle the situation with Miranda. The plan was to negotiate with Miranda, ensuring his sister, Adela, would become the colonel's wife and receive a portion of Miranda's property. The adjutant suggested that they could bypass waiting for official approval by arranging a quick marriage at a nearby church with less strict priests. Uraga considered this new perspective, realizing that there was no harm in trying this alternative approach. He decided to give it a chance, knowing that if it failed, he could resort to his original plan.

Before proceeding further with the affair, there are important considerations to take into account. The Colonel must ensure his escort remains unaware of crucial details. This group of ten individuals are all hardened criminals, loyal to their commanding officer. Each one has a dark past, some even tainted by murder. Such behavior is not uncommon among Mexican soldiers under Santa Anna's rule, extending to their officers as well. As the main body separates, Uraga carefully selects his escort, knowing they are capable of carrying out violent acts without hesitation. The Colonel instructs his men to search for an escape route, leaving only Galvez to watch over the prisoners. Suspicious actions unfold, causing unease among the captives.
