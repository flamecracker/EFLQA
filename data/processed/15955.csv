Long ago, the land we now call Scotland was a vastly different place. If we could peek through a magical mirror back to the time when the Romans, led by Agricola in 81 A.D., first arrived, we would find a landscape shrouded in mystery. The rivers overflowed their banks, forests teemed with majestic red deer, elks, and boars, and lakes dotted the terrain. The people of that era were skilled in the use of iron tools and weapons, even employing wheeled vehicles. Their art and culture, akin to the Late Celtic period, flourished with beautiful bronze artifacts and epic tales reminiscent of Homer's heroes. As time passed, the Romans built forts and roads in the region, leaving behind traces of their presence that we can still see today through archaeological excavations.|['1.

Rome's influence can be seen in Scotland with forts, a wall between the firths, and antiquities like the station at Newstead. St. Columba brought Christianity to the Picts, converting them as far north as Inverness. He settled in Iona, performed miracles, and spread the Gospel. His diplomacy and evangelism were remarkable, as seen in his recognition of Aidan as the rightful king. The 'Life of Columba' by Adamnan provides insight into daily life in the Highlands during that era. The monastic discipline of St. Columba shaped the missionary work in Scotland, with settlements of clerics and peculiar customs. Scotland's history is marked by wars between various kingdoms, each with its own language and culture. The English element influenced the Lowlands, while the Celtic kings adopted the language, leading to the dominance of English in the region.|"[""1.

During the early years of Scottish history, Kenneth MacAlpine of Kintyre played a crucial role. He hailed from Dalriada on his father's side and was of Pictish descent through his mother. Kenneth's victory over the Picts in 844-860 marked a significant turning point. By Pictish tradition, the crown passed through the maternal line, aiding Kenneth's claim to the throne. This event saw the merging of the Scots and Picts, establishing the Scottish dynasty. Kenneth's reign faced challenges from Viking invaders and internal conflicts but managed to maintain a stronghold. The relocation of the capital from Iona to Scone under Kenneth's rule demonstrated the shifting dynamics of power. Kenneth's lineage and subsequent rulers like Malcolm III shaped the course of Scottish history, paving the way for the nation's development amid turbulent times.|"[""1.

Shakespeare's portrayal of Duncan as a respected elder and Macbeth as a power-hungry Thane, influenced by witches, is widely accepted. In reality, Macbeth was the Mormaor of Murray and supported his stepson Lulach, linked to the House of Aodh. Malcolm Canmore's rule (1057-1093) strengthened Scotland's ties with western Europe. His marriage to Margaret, sister of Eadgar AEtheling, aimed to resist Norman influence in England. Margaret, known for her gentleness, built Dunfermline Abbey and brought refinement to Scotland. Malcolm's conflicts with the Normans led to his defeat and death in 1093. Margaret's death marked a shift in Scottish church affairs, with English monks replacing Celtic clergy. The Scottish Church, under Margaret's influence, saw reforms and closer ties to Rome. The absence of a Metropolitan caused disputes with English sees, impacting episcopal appointments. Scotland's relationship with Rome remained complex and challenging.|"[""1.

Scotland faced many challenges, but the marriage of Malcolm and Margaret, along with the arrival of nobles from the south, introduced feudal law peacefully. Malcolm's death led to a struggle for the throne between Donald Ban, Duncan, and Eadmund. Eadgar eventually ruled, promoting anglicization. Alexander I faced battles in the north and established religious houses. The clergy secured independence from English sees, aiding in Scotland's fight for freedom. With David I's reign, English law and institutions were introduced. David associated with Anglo-Norman nobles, founding the Stewart dynasty. His wife, Matilda, aimed to secure Northumberland. Domestic conflicts with the Celts led to the forfeiture of the Earldom of Moray, further anglicizing the kingdom. The Celts' strength shifted to the west.|"['1.

In the years 1135-1136, after the death of King Henry I, David supported his niece Matilda as the Queen of England against Stephen. In 1138, David led his forces from Orkney to Galloway into Yorkshire, facing opposition from his Anglo-Norman allies. The Battle of the Standard took place on August 22, 1138, where English soldiers fought as dismounted infantry, a tactic later seen in their French wars. The battle saw the wild Galloway men charge, only to be defeated by the English. Despite this, Prince David's heavy cavalry caused some chaos, but the Scots were eventually defeated. David's reign saw advancements in Scotland, and upon his death in 1153, his grandson Malcolm ascended the throne. David's policies helped integrate Scotland into the Feudal System, which was based on written laws and charters, transforming the social and political landscape.|"['1.

"During the reign of David I, the process of Anglicisation in Scotland was gradual, with less expropriation of the Celtic people but rather a disguise of their names under new family titles. Territorial surnames often hid the true Celtic origins of families. In regions like Galloway and Ayrshire, Celtic names like Kennedy remained, while the Highlands kept their native magnates. David I, known as a ""sair saint for the Crown,"" granted lands to religious orders, establishing centers of learning and skilled agriculture. The regular clergy's orderliness and focus on agriculture benefited the State. The introduction of stable middle and urban classes under David and his son William the Lion regulated the rights of existing free towns, creating burghs with elected magistrates and organized internal structures. The towns became hubs of trade, commerce, and governance, following an English model."|"['**1.

During the reign of King David, the royal court traveled annually between Dumfries and Inverness as there was no fixed capital. In later years, regions like Scotia, Lothian, and the lawless Galloway had their own Grand Justiciaries who presided over the Four Pleas. Local courts were held by earls, bishops, abbots, and barons with their right of pit and gallows. By the law of 1180, the Sheriff of the shire or his agent had to be present at these courts, ensuring royal justice extended over local courts. The process initiated by William the Lion slowly replaced wild justice with royal authority, sheriffs, juries, and witnesses. Abbeys held courts based on laws sanctioned by popes and councils. Scotland under David and his successors became more civilized, with beautiful abbeys showcasing high art and education. Malcolm the Maiden faced challenges from Celtic uprisings and alliances with England and France, shaping Scotland's future.|"[""1.

During the reign of King Alexander, peace prevailed in Scotland. He managed to settle disputes and maintain order, allowing the clergy to hold councils independently. Alexander married Joanna, daughter of King John, and their union helped secure peaceful relations with England. Despite being a child king, Alexander showed wisdom beyond his years. He married Margaret, daughter of Henry III of England, fostering further peace between the two nations. Alexander's reign saw the integration of the western isles of Scotland, previously under Norse rule. He also navigated political challenges with England, avoiding vassalage under Edward I. Tragically, Alexander's lineage was cut short, leaving his granddaughter, the Maid of Norway, as heir to the throne. However, her untimely death led to a power struggle in Scotland, with rival factions vying for control and seeking English intervention.|"['1.

In May 1291, Edward arrived in Norham-on-Tweed and declared himself Lord Paramount, supported by twelve Crown candidates. The nobles betrayed their country to serve their ambitions, while the people's protest was futile. Edward acted as lord, listening to pleas and evidence in autumn 1292. He ultimately chose John Balliol over Bruce the Old as the rightful heir. Balliol, unpopular and weak, was subjected to Edward's rule. In 1296, Balliol surrendered his royal claims to Edward after a war. William Wallace emerged as a leader, resisting English rule. Wallace led a successful attack against the English at Lanark in May 1297. The English army was defeated at Stirling Bridge in September 1297 by Wallace's forces. Edward retaliated at Falkirk in July 1298, defeating Wallace's army. The conflict continued until July 1304, with Bruce alternating between serving Edward and plotting against him. Wallace was eventually captured, handed over to the English, and executed.|"['1.

The story of William Wallace, a hero of Scotland, is shrouded in mystery and legend. Despite the fragmented historical accounts, Wallace is described as a brave and unwavering leader who fought for his country's independence. His loyalty to Scotland and refusal to bow to English rule set him apart from other leaders. Similarly to Joan of Arc, Wallace inspired his people and achieved great victories against the English. However, like Joan of Arc, he was eventually betrayed, captured, and executed. The English attempted to subdue Scotland, but Wallace's legacy lived on, fueling the Scots' fight for freedom. Another key figure in Scottish history was Robert Bruce, who, after a tumultuous journey, emerged as a pivotal leader in the quest for independence. Through strategic battles and unwavering determination, Bruce and his allies turned the tide against the English, ultimately securing Scotland's status as an independent nation.|"['1.

Bruce, the King of Scotland, faced challenges but also achieved significant victories during his reign. Despite an unsuccessful attempt to conquer Ireland in 1318, where his brother Edward Bruce fell, Bruce's daughter Marjory and her husband, the Steward, were set to inherit the throne in the absence of a male heir. Scotland reclaimed Berwick in 1318 and won a decisive battle against the English at Mytton-on-Swale in 1319. In 1320, Scottish representatives declared to the Pope their unwavering determination to resist English rule. Bruce's military successes continued in 1322 with a resounding victory at Byland Abbey. His son David was born in 1324, and in 1328, the Treaty of Northampton secured Scotland's independence. Bruce's reign marked a period of constitutional development, including the inclusion of Burghs representatives in Parliament. Despite subsequent challenges during David II's reign, Bruce's legacy as a courageous and strategic leader endured in Scottish history.|"[""1.

"During the tumultuous period of Scotland's history, internal conflicts arose between supporters of Balliol and patriots like young Randolph, the young Steward, Sir Andrew Murray, and the wavering Douglas, known as the Knight of Liddesdale. Amidst the chaos, Bruce's sister and Randolph's daughter, ""Black Agnes,"" displayed remarkable courage in defending Kildrummie and Dunbar Castles. Balliol's alliances with the Lord of the Isles led to shifts in loyalties, with the Celts turning to the English. Edward III's focus on claiming the French crown diverted his attention from Scotland, allowing for Scottish victories like the recovery of Edinburgh Castle by the Knight of Liddesdale. David's reckless actions, including ill-fated battles and political intrigues, led to his capture and eventual death in 1371. The ascension of Robert II marked the beginning of the Royal Stewart line, ushering in a dynasty that lasted for centuries.

"During the reign of David II, Parliament intervened in the King's affairs due to his misfortunes and lavish spending. They controlled coinage, justice, and peace terms with England, even challenging hereditary officers. To avoid lengthy and costly Parliament sessions, a ""Committee of Articles"" was created, but it often became a tool of the Crown or nobles. The reign also saw Scottish authors like Barbour, Wyntoun, and Hucheoun. Robert II succeeded David, leading a peaceful time with England. Battles against English castles occurred, and truces were fragile. In 1388, the Battle of Otterburn was a famous moonlit encounter. Robert II's death marked the weak rule of his son, Robert III, overshadowed by Albany and Rothesay. Rothesay's actions led to his tragic death in 1402. The Highlanders were in turmoil, evident in a clan duel in 1396."|"[""1.

"Upon Rothesay's demise, Albany took over as Governor, while Douglas was captured in the significant Border defeat at Homildon Hill, near Flodden. Subsequently, Douglas allied with Percy, leading to Percy's clash with Henry IV, their defeat, and Hotspur's demise, followed by Douglas's capture at Shrewsbury. The reign of Robert III is immortalized in works like Shakespeare's ""Henry IV"" and Scott's 'The Fair Maid of Perth.' Robert III faced misfortunes, including the capture of his son James by the English in 1406. Robert passed away in April 1406, leaving Albany as Regent until his death in 1420. During James's English captivity, Scotland faced lawlessness, Lollard heresies, and the foundation of St Andrews University. The Celts' last united effort in 1411 at Harlaw against Donald, Lord of the Isles, is also notable. Albany's death in 1420 marked the beginning of Scotland's involvement in the Hundred Years' War, aiding France.

During his reign, King James faced challenges that led to his unpopularity. In 1425, he imprisoned the Duke of Albany and his son, Alexander, seizing their castles. The Albanys and Lennox were executed, their estates forfeited. His harsh reforms and cruel punishments made him feared and resented. In 1427, at Inverness, he captured Highland magnates, some were hanged or imprisoned. The Lord of the Isles did penance at Holyrood. James faced resistance from the Highlanders due to his severe justice. In 1431, Donald Balloch defeated Mar at Inverlochy, later fleeing to Ireland. James's reign was marked by violent punishments causing unrest. The lack of a standing army in the Highlands made it hard to maintain peace.

During the reign of James I, the powerful Houses in Scotland were greatly affected by political factions and private greed. The royal person was moved between Crichton in Edinburgh and Livingstone in Stirling Castle, leading to battles and alliances among various noble families like the Boyds of Kilmarnock and the Stewarts. The queen-mother's capture by Livingstone and her husband's mysterious demise marked a turbulent period. The young Earl of Douglas, a significant figure, cautiously navigated the political landscape. The Douglas family's power and wealth posed challenges to the monarchy, resulting in conflicts and shifting alliances. The era saw private wars and conflicting loyalties, with the Bishop of St Andrews opposing the Douglas party.

During the 15th century in Scotland, laws were enacted but not consistently enforced, except for the ban on importing poisons due to the country's lack of chemical capabilities. Political intrigue between the House of York and Lancaster led to conflicts. Battles such as Towton in 1461 forced Henry VI into exile in Scotland under Kennedy's protection. Despite a treaty with England, Douglas's alliance with the Celts was short-lived. The Lord of the Isles engaged in diplomacy with England through a renegade Douglas. Bishop Kennedy's influence wavered between supporting England and Scotland, eventually leading to peace in 1464. Internal struggles continued, with James II being seized by rival factions in 1466. The rise and fall of powerful noble families like the Boyds and Hamiltons shaped the political landscape. Ecclesiastical corruption and power struggles characterized this period, culminating in the downfall of the Lord of the Isles and the beginning of James II's troubled reign.|"['1.

The events that unfolded after the death of James are shrouded in mystery. Chronicles of that time are scarce, and later accounts by historians like Ferrerius, Lesley, and Buchanan are riddled with rumors and contradictions. The State Papers of England shed light on the treachery of James's brother Albany, but how James outwitted him remains unknown. James's brothers Albany and Mar were well-liked and skilled horsemen. Cochrane, accused of manipulating James, led to Mar's imprisonment on charges of treason and witchcraft. Witches were burned, a rare occurrence before the Reformation. Mar died in prison, while Albany, also accused of treason, fled to France. Albany's attempts to betray Scotland to England were thwarted by James's death, leading to a period of stability under Henry VII. James's efforts to reform the Church and negotiate marriages and territorial disputes with England were met with accusations of disloyalty. The rebellion against James, led by the Douglases, persisted for generations, culminating in a failed attempt to overthrow James. His strength prevailed, quelling the rebellion and solidifying his rule.|"[""1.

During James IV's reign, he was crowned at Scone in 1488 at the age of seventeen. He faced challenges from rebellions and political betrayals, such as Angus negotiating with England while playing cards with James. The Church was also divided, with conflicts between archbishops and the rise of the Lollards. James laughed off accusations against the heretics, showing leniency. He also dealt with Highlanders and the Isles, some being hanged or imprisoned. In 1495, James supported Perkin Warbeck's claim to be Richard, Duke of York, in retaliation against English plots. Despite marrying Perkin to his cousin Catherine Gordon, James's invasion of England in support of Perkin failed, leading to a truce negotiated by the Spanish envoy de Ayala in 1496.|"['1.

During the 16th century, Scotland faced internal conflicts among clans like the Campbells and the Huntly Gordons. The Macdonalds, Lords of the Isles, resisted Lowland influences and sought aid from England. In 1506, Donald Dubh, a son of Angus Og, caused trouble but was later captured. The marriage between James and Margaret Tudor in 1503 did not ease tensions with England. James faced challenges from Henry VIII after Henry VII's death in 1509. In 1511, James prepared for war against England due to pressure from France. Despite attempts at diplomacy, war became inevitable. On September 5, 1513, James led his forces to Flodden Edge, where he faced defeat by the English under Surrey. The battle highlighted James's lack of military strategy.|"['1.

In 1513, the Battle of Flodden took place, where James IV of Scotland met his demise. Despite his valor, Scotland faced turmoil in the aftermath. The country's fate teetered between allegiance to England or France. The young James V's reign was marred by English interference and internal strife. The nobles vied for power, the Church was embroiled in corruption, and the question of Scotland's religious affiliation loomed large. The Beatons' astute diplomacy shielded Scotland from English dominance, paving the way for the rise of Calvinism and Presbyterianism. The political landscape was treacherous, with alliances shifting constantly. As James V's mother, Margaret Tudor, grappled with her loyalties, the realm was fraught with uncertainty.

After a series of political maneuvers and conflicts, Forman eventually secured the position he sought. Albany briefly served as Regent and maintained favor with the queen-mother until discord arose with her husband, Angus. Margaret and Angus fled to England, where Margaret gave birth to their daughter, Lady Lennox. Angus and Home then reconciled with Albany, who was targeted by Henry for removal from Scotland. Albany sought aid in France and renewed alliances against Henry's wishes. The Scottish factions, led by Arran and Beaton for France, and Angus for England, clashed in street battles. Albany's return and subsequent departures marked a period of unrest. Angus held the young king, while Lennox sought to free him.

"In Scotland, the reasons behind the religious transformation were numerous. The opulence and extravagance of the upper clergy and those residing in the abbeys had long been the subject of ridicule and intense anger from the public. Benefices, both large and small, were exchanged among the popes, kings, and nobles. Uninformed and immoral members of noble families were appointed to significant church positions, while the lower clergy remained remarkably ignorant precisely when new critical knowledge, including Hebrew and Greek, was changing the study of sacred texts. The celibacy of the clergy had turned into a mere joke, with dispensations granted for them to acquire church positions for their illegitimate children. The kings were setting an undesirable example too. Both James IV and James V granted the wealthiest abbeys to their illegitimate offspring. These issues had been present for a long time. In the early 13th century, some of the abbots of Jedburgh, supported by their chapters, had given some of their churches to priests with the right of inheritance for their sons. Unjust practices where the clergy demanded a payment known as ""the upmost claith"" or its monetary equivalent as a death duty were enforced through excommunication, causing great suffering for the poor. The curses on wrongdoers were no longer feared but had turned into a joke, and purgatory was merely a means to collect money for masses.

In the past, King James faced many challenges in his personal life and political affairs. He had relationships with different women, including Margaret Erskine and Madeline, daughter of Francis I. His marriage to Mary, a lady from the Catholic house of Lorraine, brought him closer to the Catholic cause. Despite pressure from Henry VIII to make changes within the Church, James preferred to try and reform it. Tensions between James and Henry escalated, leading to conflicts on the Border. Unfortunately, James faced defeat and lost many men in battles against the English. His reign was marked by political intrigue, betrayals, and ultimately, his untimely death due to shame, grief, and despair.

When James passed away, Henry VIII held a strong hand in the game for control of Scotland. He had influential figures like Angus and George Douglas under his control, ready to support England and Henry's beliefs. Additionally, Henry had noble captives from the Battle of Solway, who were willing to help him claim the Scottish crown. Henry's plan was to secure the child king, the Cardinal, and key strongholds to advance his agenda. After James's death, a Regency Council was formed to rule Scotland, with Arran as the leading figure due to his claim to the throne. However, internal conflicts arose, with accusations of forgery against Beaton and shifting allegiances. Eventually, Arran released Beaton from captivity, leading to further political turmoil.

Henry's envoy, Sadleyr, encountered Mary of Guise and her young daughter. He found the child impressive but struggled to navigate the complex web of political schemes. The Catholic party, being the least divided, held the most power. Upon the return of Scottish ambassadors from Henry in July, the national party swiftly took control of Mary, offering her hand in marriage to Arran's son at Stirling. However, Arran's supporters contradicted this claim. Both parties accepted Henry's terms but delayed formal approval. Henry, growing impatient, seized Scottish ships on August 16. Although the Treaty was ratified on August 25, Arran demanded compensation for the seized ships. The political landscape shifted rapidly, with alliances changing frequently. Ultimately, Mary was crowned at Stirling while political tensions escalated, leading to feuds and betrayals among nobles.|"[""1.

In September 1545, Hertford led an English force to destroy religious houses in Melrose, Kelso, Dryburgh, and Jedburgh. Meanwhile, the Douglases conspired in Ayrshire with Cassilis to plot against Beaton and Arran. Beaton's capture of George Wishart, a Protestant preacher, led to his doom. Wishart was burned in St Andrews on March 1, 1546. Beaton was later surprised and slain by Norman Leslie in his castle on May 29th. The murderers held St Andrews Castle against all attempts. Beaton's fight against treacherous foes defended Scotland's independence. His defeat of Henry made Presbyterian Calvinism possible. Beaton's death left Scotland vulnerable. The murderers, aided by England, held the castle despite attempts to dislodge them. John Knox arrived at the castle and preached, leading to his capture by the French in 1547.|"[""1.

In 1547, the English plotted with Scottish nobles to betray their own fortresses, leading 2000 Scots to fight against their country under England's flag. An English force of 15,000 marched north, clashing with the Scots at Pinkie in September. Despite the Scots' strategic position, they were defeated. The English leader, Somerset, captured some Scottish strongholds but achieved little else. The young Scottish queen was moved to safety, negotiating a marriage with the Dauphin. French forces arrived, capturing Haddington from the English. Mary of Guise favored French advisors, causing unease among Scottish Catholics. Knox returned to Scotland in 1555, advocating against the Mass and idolatry. The Scots sought a compromise, but Knox's uncompromising stance led to tension.|"['1.

In the mid-16th century, John Knox, a key figure in the Scottish Reformation, firmly believed in the impossibility of tolerance. He preached in Scotland until June 1556, associating with influential figures like Lord Lorne, James Stewart, and the Earl of Glencairn. Despite facing a trial in Edinburgh, Knox's strong support from the laity prevented any legal action. By July 1556, he traveled to France but received a compelling letter from Scottish nobles urging his return to advance the glory of God, potentially risking civil war. Knox hesitated, concerned about inciting conflict, especially with hostilities between England and Scotland. The Protestant movement gained momentum, culminating in a covenant signed by Scottish nobles vowing to defend Protestant preachers and establish the Word of God. This period was marked by political intrigue, religious fervor, and the growing Protestant movement in Scotland.|['1.

"All these events were part of a deliberate plan and not mere accidents. Mary of Guise had intended to visit France, not to persecute heretics. However, due to her failing health and doubts about her recovery in April 1559, the situation took a different turn. Preachers like Willock and Methuen were summoned for trial in February 1559 due to their teachings inciting violence. Despite attempts at reform by moderate Catholics, tensions rose. When Knox arrived in Scotland just before a trial in Stirling, the opportunity for change arose. The Regent's weakness, the strong Congregation, and England's support fueled the movement. The preachers were outlawed for not appearing at trial, leading to unrest in Perth. Eventually, a composition was reached between the Regent and the insurgents, with some nobles joining the cause against ""idolatry.""

During the religious reform in St Andrews, the ecclesiastical buildings faced destruction similar to what happened in Perth. Knox, through his sermons, encouraged the reformers. It is assumed that the boys took pleasure in breaking windows and images. In a latrine of the monastic buildings, a damaged head of the Redeemer was discovered. James Stewart, acting as the Commendator, might have acquired valuable items like the golden sheath of the Apostle's arm-bone and sacred church plate. Lethington managed to secure most portable possessions of St Salvator's College, except the silver mace gifted by Kennedy. The monastery of the Franciscans was razed, with only a fragment of the Dominicans' chapel remaining. By mid-June, the Regent had to withdraw French soldiers from Fife, leading to the sacking of Scone Abbey and the palace. The Congregation took over Edinburgh, Holyrood, and the Mint stamps. The Regent accused them of rebellion and collusion with England, which Knox initially denied. Arran was proposed as a suitor for Elizabeth. The Congregation evacuated Edinburgh and Leith in July, following a disputed treaty. Knox visited England in August but was dissatisfied with his diplomatic skills. Fresh French forces arrived at Leith, reinforcing Catholic resistance. The Congregation proclaimed the Regent's deposition in October, based on forged documents and seals. After a defeat, they sought refuge in Stirling, where Knox rallied them.|"['1.

During the events in Scotland in 1560, the English diplomat Sadleyr informed Arran that a fleet was coming to support the Congregation, who were taking over Paisley Abbey and acting in the names of Francis and Mary. The fleet arrived just as the French were about to capture St Andrews, ruining their plans. The dying Regent found refuge in Edinburgh Castle, which remained neutral. The Congregation formed a league with England on February 27, with Elizabeth as Scotland's Protectress. Mary and Francis couldn't assist due to unrest in France. Mary of Guise had trouble with Huntly, a Catholic who later joined the Congregation. Negotiations led to the Treaty of Edinburgh on July 6, 1560, but Mary Stuart never ratified it, as she felt it compromised her English succession claims. The Confession of Faith was drawn up and approved, with penalties for Mass attendees. The document was heavily influenced by Calvin's teachings.|"['1.

The Book of Discipline, written by Knox and other ministers, focused on provisions for paying preachers, supporting universities, and aiding the poor. However, it was not officially approved by the Estates, unlike the Confession of Faith. The Book of Discipline endorsed the Book of Common Order for public worship, which guided ministers in prayers without a fixed liturgy. Ministers were chosen through popular vote after moral and knowledge assessments, with no ordination by laying on of hands. The Scottish Sabbath was established with strict rules, including the abolition of festivals like Christmas and Easter. The preachers wielded power through clerical excommunication, a practice retained from Rome, and private morals were monitored by elders in kirk-sessions. The system was based on the belief in the literal inspiration of the Bible and the authority of the preachers. These unique practices originated from Geneva and were enforced in Scotland due to historical circumstances.|['1.

In January 1561, the Scottish Estates instructed James Stuart, Mary's brother, to visit her in France. During spring, they met, along with an envoy from Huntly, representing the Catholic party. Huntly proposed that Mary land in Aberdeen and lead the Gordons and other northern clans south. However, Mary, wary of Huntly's treachery, chose to trust her brother instead. James Stuart's return through England convinced Elizabeth to acknowledge Mary as her heir. Despite this, Elizabeth refused to settle the succession, and Mary declined to ratify the Treaty of Edinburgh. Consequently, Elizabeth forbade Mary from traveling home through England. On August 19, 1561, Mary arrived in Leith amid fog, unexpectedly and without a warm reception. She pardoned some artisans for a Robin Hood frolic, which Knox believed was done against religion. Mary's first act was to allow Mass in her private chapel, but Knox vehemently opposed it. Despite insults to her faith, Mary remained composed and aligned with Lethington and her brother in hopes of reconciliation with Elizabeth.|"['1.

The court was lively with young French nobles, including Bothwell, a Protestant who had supported Mary of Guise in 1559. Bothwell, aged twenty-seven, was reckless, charming, bilingual, and well-educated. In December, a plan was made for bishops to share their wealth with preachers and the queen. This caused a divide between preachers and politicians like Lethington and Lord James. The Earl of Mar was secretly made Earl of Murray after Huntly's defeat. Mary sought a meeting with Elizabeth to discuss religion, but it never happened. Knox opposed it, fearing Mary might become Anglican. Mary's reign was marked by conflicts, including an incident with Huntly, who died in a fight. Mary's brother became Earl of Mar and later Earl of Murray. Knox criticized Mary for dancing, linking it to events in France. The affair of Chatelard, a poet who hid under Mary's bed, ended tragically in 1563.|"[""1.

During Easter, priests in Ayrshire were imprisoned for holding Mass, following the law. The queen tried to influence Knox, who resisted, leading to Archbishop Hamilton and other clerics being imprisoned. The Estates met on May 27 but did not pass the Book of Discipline. Instead, they condemned witches to death, resulting in cruelty. Knox and Murray reconciled in 1565. Elizabeth requested Mary to allow Lennox to return, possibly to marry Darnley. Knox supported Lord Robert Dudley. In 1564, discord persisted between the Kirk and the Lords. Knox defended the right to imitate the slayings of idolaters. Elizabeth asked Mary to withdraw permission for Lennox to visit. The intrigues between Cecil, Leicester, and Elizabeth aimed to prevent Mary from marrying.

In 1561, David Riccio arrived in Scotland as a musician and quickly gained favor with Mary and Darnley. Accusations of conspiracy against Murray arose, leading to the organization of an armed force by the godly in June 1565. Mary called upon Bothwell, a man of the sword, from exile. Despite tensions within her camp, Mary married Darnley on July 29th. Murray, facing charges of treason, was outlawed in August. Mary's actions hinted at a shift away from moderation towards France and Rome. Her marriage to Darnley influenced her policies, causing further discord. A Parliament was planned for March 1566, but Mary's intentions regarding religion were unclear. The nobles, including the exiled Lords, were plotting against her, with Darnley's jealousy of Riccio fueling the fire. The conspiracy unfolded mechanically, leading to Riccio's murder and Mary's escape to safety at Dunbar.|"['1.

On June 19th, in Edinburgh Castle, Mary gave birth to her son, James VI. After recovering, Darnley's behavior became intolerable, making him even more disliked, while Bothwell gained favor. In October, most Lords, including Murray, signed an agreement to set Darnley aside, not for his murder. Darnley accused Mary of neglecting Catholic interests to Spain, France, and Rome. Mary fell seriously ill in mid-October in Jedburgh, where Bothwell was welcomed, and Darnley was coldly received. By late November, Mary stayed at Craigmillar Castle with Murray, Argyll, Bothwell, Huntly, and Lethington to discuss Darnley. Plans were made to arrest Darnley, who fell ill with smallpox in Glasgow. Despite Mary's attempts to reconcile, Darnley was found dead after an explosion in his house, orchestrated by Bothwell. Mary was later imprisoned in Lochleven Castle, where she signed her abdication. She escaped briefly but was eventually captured and imprisoned by Elizabeth.|"[""1.

Mary was once a strong believer in the Church but did not always follow its rules, like marrying Darnley before getting permission from the Pope. Philip of Spain, the French envoy to Scotland, and the French Court doubted her innocence in Darnley's death. The Pope couldn't decide who was better between Mary and Elizabeth. While imprisoned in England, Mary became the hope of English Catholics. The two sides in Scotland, influenced by Elizabeth, waited for English inquiries into Mary's guilt. Elizabeth's goal was to make Mary respond to accusations. Mary was not allowed to defend herself during inquiries, and her own commissioners proposed compromises she refused. Mary stood firm, rejecting all compromises and insisting on her rights as queen. Intrigues continued as various proposals were made to Mary, all involving her giving up her crown, which she adamantly refused. Elizabeth's hostility towards Mary increased when she learned of a plan for Mary to marry Norfolk. Murray, who governed Scotland, was shot, and Mary's cause faced challenges.|"[""1.

Randolph was now sent to Edinburgh to prevent peace between Mary's party and her enemies. He succeeded; the parties armed themselves, and Sussex attacked the Border as revenge for a raid by Buccleuch. On May 14, Lennox, with an English force, went north, devastated the Hamilton area, became Regent in July, and in April 1571, took revenge on Archbishop Hamilton. George Buchanan, Mary's former tutor, used this to publish a new account of Darnley's murder. Edinburgh Castle, under Kirkcaldy with Lethington, resisted. Knox left Edinburgh for St Andrews. Many of Mary's Lords abandoned her. Lennox was shot, succeeded by Mar, inspired by Morton. The discovery of a plot led to the Duke's execution and harsher treatment for Mary. Morton and his allies refused to give up lands, while Lethington and Kirkcaldy held out in Edinburgh Castle. Knox predicted Kirkcaldy's hanging. The castle surrendered in 1573 after being attacked by English forces. Kirkcaldy was hanged. Knox died, leaving Morton in power. The Church saw new trends with Morton appointing bishops for financial gain. Peace between Church and State was elusive.|"[""1.

During the 16th century in Scotland, there was a struggle for power and influence within the nobility and the church. The Privy Council ignored the demands of preachers who wanted harsh penalties against Catholics. Morton, a powerful figure, controlled the preachers and manipulated the church for his benefit. However, in 1575, Andrew Melville challenged the authority of bishops in the Kirk, leading to tensions. Morton faced opposition from various nobles, including Argyll and Atholl. Despite economic growth, political intrigue and accusations of murder haunted Morton's rule. The rise of Esme Stuart d'Aubigny and his alliance with James Stewart signaled a shift in power dynamics. Eventually, Morton's downfall came when he clashed with the Hamilton leaders, leading to his exile. The intricate web of alliances and betrayals shaped the political landscape of Scotland during this turbulent period.|"['1.

Lennox sought strength by aligning with the Kirk. Meanwhile, Elizabeth dispatched Bowes to undermine Lennox's efforts to aid Mary or the Guises. Lennox's acquisition of Dumbarton Castle, a French stronghold, prompted Elizabeth to incite Morton to act against him. However, Elizabeth rescinded her orders shortly after. Bowes was recalled, leaving Morton to fend for himself. Morton was warned by Lord Robert Stewart of a plot against him, leading to his arrest for involvement in Darnley's murder. Elizabeth's threats of war ensued. The preachers railed against Lennox, and a plot to murder him and capture James was foiled. In a bid to appease the preachers, the king and Lennox signed an anti-Rome Covenant. Subsequently, Morton was tried and executed, marking a turning point in the power struggle between the Kirk and the monarchy.|"[""1.

In February 1567, the tragic life of Mary Stuart ended with her public execution at Fotheringay. James, her son, refused to accept payment for her death from Elizabeth. During James's reign, he faced challenges from various factions, including the Presbyterian nobles, Catholic families, and Protestant preachers. Bothwell, a Catholic supporter, plotted against James, backed by the widow of Gowrie and preachers, with encouragement from Elizabeth. Intrigues involving priestly emissaries and Spain complicated Mary's plots. In 1587, an Act passed attaching ecclesiastical property to the Crown, which James used to create temporal lordships. The mysterious Gowrie Conspiracy in 1600 involved the Earl of Gowrie obtaining Church lands. James's ability to enrich nobles shifted their loyalty, and he faced challenges from the Spanish Armada. Elizabeth discovered letters proving Catholic earls were colluding with Spain in 1589, leading to their brief imprisonment. James's leniency towards the Catholic earls caused ongoing trouble due to his reluctance to persecute.|"[""1.

"In 1592, a series of events unfolded in Scotland. The General Assembly offered prayers for the oppressed Puritans in England, while Queen Elizabeth supported plots against Puritans in Scotland. The Puritans sided with Francis Stewart, Earl of Bothwell, who aimed to capture the king. A conspiracy within Clan Campbell resulted in the murder of the Earl of Murray. James faced accusations of involvement due to suspicions about his connections to Bothwell. The discovery of the ""Spanish Blanks"" revealed a plot involving Scottish Catholics seeking aid from Spain. Bothwell, with support from Cecil, attempted to seize the king but was eventually forced to flee. James repudiated his forced engagement with Bothwell, who then allied with Catholic earls. James ordered levies to combat the earls, leading to conflicts and political intrigue. Throughout the Tudor period, England engaged in conspiracies against Scottish rulers.

In 1597, James used his cunning to reduce the Kirk. He called a Convention in Perth, persuading ministers from the north to vote for a General Assembly. They agreed to his proposals on Church government modifications, forbidding certain activities and preaching against Acts of Parliament. The Catholic lords were to be converted. Despite opposition from Andrew Melville, decisions were ratified in a May Assembly. James granted Church lands to nobles, reducing their conspiracies. In 1598, some ministers were allowed to participate in Parliament. James wrote 'Basilicon Doron,' revealing his views on kings' rights over the Church. He introduced bishops to control preachers. Relations with England were strained, and plots were encouraged against James. The mysterious events in Perth involving the Earl of Gowrie and James raised suspicions among preachers. The conflicting versions of the incident made it challenging to ascertain the truth.|"[""1.

Lennox and his group forcefully entered the area between the gallery and the turret, concluding the situation except for the rowdy gathering of townspeople. The man with the dagger had escaped but later turned himself in; he was Gowrie's steward named Henderson. Henderson had accompanied the Master to Falkland and back to Perth to warn Gowrie of James's arrival. Henderson admitted that Gowrie had instructed him to wear armor under false pretenses and had stationed him in the turret. Henderson's arrival at Gowrie's house by half-past ten from Falkland was confirmed, yet Gowrie had not readied for the royal visit. Robert Oliphant, M.A., revealed in private conversation that Gowrie had offered him the position in the turret earlier, which he declined. It is clear that James could not have orchestrated these events, making it implausible. Consequently, the two Ruthvens conspired to seize him early in the day, attempting to divert James's entourage by claiming he had already departed. The deceased Ruthvens and their residence were forfeited. Mr. Bruce, a preacher, adamantly refused to accept James's version of the events at Gowrie's house in August 5. Bruce sought a leader among the nobles for the ministers' faction. In 1593, the young Earl of Gowrie allied with Bothwell, and in April 1594, Gowrie, Bothwell, and Atholl sought the Kirk's support.

During the Tudor dynasty, James ruled Scotland through the Privy Council, opting for a more administrative approach. This method persisted until the Union of 1707, posing various risks as the king became detached from his people. Noteworthy figures in the Privy Council included Seton, Hume, and Thomas Hamilton. The elevation of bishops, like Spottiswoode, led to tension with the nobles and the Kirk, sparking civil unrest. James employed underhanded tactics to suppress the Kirk, leading to clashes with ministers and the populace. His attempts to establish Episcopacy faced backlash, culminating in the establishment of High Commission Courts. Despite his efforts to unite England and Scotland, James faced opposition from both sides.

James, the king, faced challenges with the Presbyterian Church and nobles. The clergy's demands led to absolutism and clashes. Border clans like the Armstrongs faced punishment, and Scottish settlers were sent to Ulster. Catholics suffered persecution, and Father Ogilvie was hanged. James enforced the Articles of Perth, causing unrest. His rule was marked by witch trials and clan feuds. His reign ended before enforcing decrees. James's upbringing influenced his character. He encouraged witch trials and promoted colonisation. His reign saw turmoil in the Highlands and the Orkneys. Charles I's reign began amid religious tensions in England and Scotland. Puritans and Anglicans vied for power, leading to threats and persecutions. Religious fears and hatreds plagued both nations, setting the stage for future conflicts.|"['1.

"In Scotland, national defense expenses caused anger, worsened by Buckingham's mismanagement of military matters. The ""Act of Revocation"" in Scotland aimed to restore Church and Crown lands granted since 1542 to the Crown, sparking opposition between nobles and preachers. James VI had previously annexed ecclesiastical property to the Crown, but Charles threatened temporal lords' holdings. This led to the redemption of their lands and empowered landowners to buy tithes directly, ending the oppressive tithe system. The introduction of Anglican practices and the imposition of a Book of Canons by Charles in 1635 caused further unrest among the populace, nobles, and clergy.

"In 1637, the Scottish people strongly opposed King Charles I's attempt to enforce a new Liturgy in St Giles' Church in Edinburgh. This resulted in a chaotic brawl, with women leading the charge against the Liturgy, even throwing stools at the Dean. The conflict escalated, leading to what became known as ""The Bishops' War,"" marking the beginning of the Civil War. The Tables, a committee formed by the people, demanded the removal of bishops from the Privy Council, questioning who should govern the country. The Presbyterians sought the withdrawal of the Liturgy and other demands, facing off against the king's refusals. This led to the signing of a covenant against popery and for the maintenance of true religion, ultimately shaping the course of Scottish history and leading to the conquest of Scotland by Cromwell."|"[""1.

The Covenant, a powerful agreement, led to bloodshed and sorrow for over fifty years until it was abandoned in 1689. It was signed by many with zeal, and those who refused faced persecution. The terms were seen as aggressive and not divinely inspired. The country fell under the control of zealous preachers, causing chaos. The Marquis of Hamilton was sent to represent the king's wavering, but he hesitated to act. A General Assembly in Glasgow in 1638 condemned bishops, leading to their removal. The press was censored, and ecclesiastical laws were overturned. The conflict escalated into war in 1639, with both sides struggling for control. Negotiations ensued, resulting in a temporary truce. The Scots signed a treaty for new assemblies and parliaments in the following months.|"['1.

"In the past, Charles faced a crucial decision. He could have chosen to fight, risking defeat but gaining honor. The Covenanters urged him to fight, believing that even if he fell, England would rise in revenge. However, Charles decided to retreat to London, leaving behind unresolved conflicts. The new Assembly ratified all Acts from 1638, including compulsory Covenant signing. Charles' refusal to denounce Episcopacy and meet with Scottish envoys further fueled tensions. Meanwhile, the Scots imposed military taxation through ""The Blind Band."" In England, the Short Parliament clashed with Charles over supplies. The Long Parliament later condemned key figures, including Strafford and Laud. Eventually, Charles conceded to Scottish demands, returning home with a substantial sum. Amidst political turmoil, religious divisions within the Kirk emerged, hinting at future conflicts. Montrose's clandestine actions against Argyll were revealed, leading to further intrigue and accusations within the Committee of Estates."|"['1.

"The entire situation is puzzling; nevertheless, Ladywell was executed for spreading false rumors, a crime that was not previously punishable by death. Montrose and his companions were imprisoned in the castle. Presumably, he had intended to accuse Argyll of treason before Parliament. On July 27, 1641, during his trial before Parliament, he declared, ""I am resolved to uphold fidelity and honor until my death."" While in jail, the king visited Edinburgh from August 14 to November 17, 1641, seeking support against the English Parliament. Charles became subservient to the Scottish Parliament, agreeing to an Act that required its approval for his appointments of State officers. Hamilton and Lanark had cultivated a close relationship with Argyll. Charles narrated a peculiar incident on October 12, where Hamilton had requested to leave Court due to fear of his enemies. The following day, Hamilton, Argyll, and Lanark actually departed. On October 22, the brothers claimed they had learned of a conspiracy to harm them. The details are muddled and conflicting, with accusations that Hamilton and Argyll had assembled 5000 men in town. Despite Charles' requests for a public inquiry, the matter remained unresolved. Charles elevated some of his adversaries in the peerage, making Argyll a marquis and releasing Montrose from prison. On October 28, Charles reported on the Irish uprising and massacre, which he was accused of instigating. This"|['1.

The Scots were pleasantly surprised when the English agreed to the new alliance. Led by Alexander Leslie, their aging commander, the Scottish army crossed Tweed in January 1644. This move might not have happened if Charles had heeded Montrose's advice to attack the Covenanters in Scotland in the fall of 1643. In December 1643, Hamilton and Lanark, who had differing views from Montrose, met the king at Oxford. Montrose refused to work with them and decided to go abroad. Hamilton was later imprisoned for treason due to his wavering loyalty. Montrose's plan involved using exiled Macdonalds against the Campbells, despite strong objections. Montrose's victories began at Tippermuir, near Perth, where his forces defeated a large Covenanting army with only 2500 men. These successes continued at Aberdeen, Auldearn, and Inverlochy. Despite Montrose's victories, Cromwell's triumph at Naseby and the rise of the Independents posed challenges to the Covenanters. Montrose's final victory at Kilsyth against General Baillie's forces was a decisive moment, showcasing his military genius and the valour of his troops.|"['1.

In the past year, Montrose successfully drove out the militant Covenanters from Scotland, but his forces became irregular and many left after each battle. Eventually, Montrose found himself abandoned by key allies, such as Colkitto and Aboyne, relying on unreliable supporters like the Homes and Kers. Facing overwhelming opposition led by Leslie and Argyll, Montrose retreated to Philiphaugh near Selkirk with a small force. In a surprise attack on September 13, Montrose's army suffered heavy losses, with most of the Irish fighters perishing. Montrose, along with some loyal horsemen, managed to escape Leslie's forces. Despite his efforts to support the Royalists in England, Montrose's strategy backfired due to the betrayal of the Border lords and the clergy's harsh treatment of captives.|"[""1.

The main goal of the English opponents of the king was to expel the Scots from England. Charles, in a desperate situation, negotiated with various factions, willing to compromise on everything except imposing presbytery on England. The French ambassador, Montereuil, noted that this matter was not their concern. Charles eventually placed his trust in the Scots, but Montereuil described any assurances he had as mere verbal promises. The Scots saw Charles as a means to secure payment for their wages. There was deceit on both sides, and misunderstandings likely occurred. Despite verbal promises of safety, honor, and conscience, the Scots forced Charles to sign the Covenant and mistreated him. They took him to Newcastle, breaking their assurances. The Scots left with money, leaving Charles in English custody despite promises of safety. The situation led to conflicting opinions within Scotland, with different factions at odds over the king's fate.|"['1.

The godly people in Scotland celebrated when their army was defeated. The forces from Ayr, Renfrew, and Lanark took over Edinburgh, with Argyll and the Kirk party in control. Cromwell visited Edinburgh in October and was hosted by Argyll. The Covenant's left wing joined forces with the Independents, enemies of presbytery. This seemed like a breach of the Covenant, a pact with God. Charles believed these divisions were God's punishment for rebellions. Argyll and Johnston demanded laws against those involved in the failed king rescue. The Act of Classes barred many from office, weakening Scotland against England. Charles agreed to sign the Covenant under pressure, leading to Montrose's defeat and execution. Montrose remained loyal to Charles despite dishonorable actions by others.|"['1.

In Scotland, while his supporters were executing his loyal followers captured in Montrose's defeat, Charles crossed the sea. He signed the Covenants on the ship and landed at Spey's mouth. By breaking his promise, he gained the guilt of perjury. The more honest but wild Covenanters distrusted him, knowing he had lied. They believed his arrival brought divine wrath. Charles was separated from his deceitful friends and Royalists. He couldn't be with his army, as preachers removed anyone not meeting their sanctity standards. They aimed to please God by purging experienced officers and replacing them with inexperienced novices. This absurdity stemmed from emulating ancient Israel, initiated by Knox. Charles had to sign a false declaration to appease those who blamed him for wrath. Cromwell's army reached Musselburgh in July, and a battle ensued at Dunbar in September, where the Scots suffered a significant defeat.|"[""1.

In history, Charles was crowned at Scone on January 1 and signed the Covenants again. Leslie held Stirling, avoiding a fight. Lambert crossed the Forth at Queensferry and defeated Scots at Inverkeithing. Monk captured many at the General Assembly. Cromwell moved to Perth, attacking Leslie's main force at Stirling. The Scots then invaded England, reaching Worcester on August 22. Cromwell's larger force defeated Charles at Worcester on September 3. Monk captured the Committee of Estates and some preachers. England ruled Scotland for nine years, establishing a temporary administration. Attempts at union failed, leading to heavy taxation and confiscation of estates. The English protected people from persecution and witch trials. Monk's aversion to Argyll began, and a fair English Commission of Justice was established. The Protesters and Resolutioners' quarrel weakened the Kirk, and Middleton's insurrection failed. With Cromwell's protectorate, Free Trade was offered, but the Union legislation failed. After Cromwell's death, Richard Cromwell's Parliament included Scottish members. The Rump's dissolution delayed a new Union Bill. Monk led his army south in 1660, leaving the Resolutioners and Protesters divided, awaiting change. The Covenants continued to fuel unrest in Scotland.|"['1.

In Scotland, after the king's return, there was much celebration among the people. The dark times seemed to be over, with the English no longer ruling with their strange ways. The nobles hoped to regain their lands and be compensated for their losses. Offices were up for grabs, and everyone was eager for the rewards. However, the people were divided. Some, like the Resolutioners, sought a moderate approach with Episcopacy, while others, like the Protesters, were vehemently against it. The ruling classes favored bishops over strict Presbyterianism, but the common folk and preachers saw Episcopacy as a betrayal of their Covenant. Scotland was in turmoil, with different factions vying for power and influence. The struggle between the Resolutioners and Protesters continued, with each side pushing their agenda.

In 1661, Parliament commenced with Middleton as Commissioner. Sir George Mackenzie described it as the most compliant Parliament ever. The king was declared the highest authority, undoing Acts between 1633 and 1661, similar to the Covenanters' actions. The king received an annual sum of 40,000 pounds. Argyll was tried and executed due to incriminating letters. The Church matter was left to Charles and his advisors, a complex issue. The preachers' demands conflicted with the State's existence. The Restoration Government faced challenges from the Kirk. The introduction of Episcopacy and removal of beloved ministers led to rebellions. The period saw violent persecutions and uprisings due to the Church reforms. Ultimately, the Restoration brought Episcopacy back, leading to further unrest and discontent among the Scottish populace.|"['1.

In June 1663, the Parliament convened under Rothes, using unconstitutional means to select the Lords of the Articles. Waristoun was brought from France, tried, and executed, causing fear. Lauderdale's Act fined those who abstained from parish church services. In 1664, Sharp, disliked by Lauderdale and Glencairn, established a Court of High Commission to punish nonconformists. Turner was tasked with coercing nonconformists, but his soldiers' brutality fueled discontent. Conventicles, secret religious meetings, grew in number, with scouts and sentinels. In 1666, rebels conspired to seize key castles but were thwarted. The rebellion lacked foreign support and began casually. Turner's soldiers mistreated an old man, sparking a revolt. The rebels, led by Wallace, displayed courage but were defeated. Cruelty was inflicted on prisoners by the Council under Sharp. The rebellion was quelled, with rebels hanged and torture used for information. The situation escalated with Ballantyne's increased brutality and dissent among officials.

In 1667, a plan for partial toleration was discussed, resulting in increased disorder. Bishop Leighton aimed to reduce Episcopacy, but a book called 'Naphtali' promoted violence against oppressors. This led to an incident where a preacher named Mitchell shot at Sharp, causing a delay in conciliation efforts. By 1669, the first Indulgence was introduced, allowing some outed ministers to return. Despite opposition from Holland exiles, the Indulgence gained followers, causing a split in the Kirk. Lauderdale faced opposition in the Parliament of 1673, leading to charges against him. Despite attempts to challenge him, Lauderdale remained in power, ruling through relatives and allies. Leighton, feeling disillusioned, resigned due to insults from the Kirk. Disorder persisted, with landowners refusing to sign a peace bond, leading to the intervention of the Highland Host in 1678.|['1.

In 1668, Mitchell missed Sharp and accidentally shot the Bishop of Orkney, leading to his arrest and confession in 1674 after being assured of his life by Rothes and Lauderdale. However, he later retracted his confession before the judges. Despite requesting to examine the Council's Register, the Lords of Justiciary refused, and Mitchell was eventually tortured and tried again in 1678. The prosecution led to his unjust hanging in January 1678. Subsequently, armed conventicles arose, with Balfour of Kinloch and Robert Hamilton leading a sect that rebelled against the authorities. The rebellion culminated in the murder of Sharp by Balfour at Magus Moor in 1679. This act of violence sparked further unrest, leading to clashes between the rebels and Royal forces, ultimately resulting in defeat for the rebels at Bothwell Bridge in June 1679.|"[""1.

"The Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679 led to a split among the Covenanters. Extremists like Robert Hamilton, Richard Cameron, and Cargill formed the ""Remnant,"" becoming fiercer as their numbers decreased. The Covenanters faced harsh punishments - two ministers were hanged, many were banished to the American colonies, and some drowned in a shipwreck. The ruling officials, led by James, Duke of York, fined and ruined hundreds accused of aiding rebels. The Remnant, led by Cargill, excommunicated the king and others, causing unrest. Cargill was captured and hanged, while James, as Royal Commissioner, passed Acts securing the right of succession and the Test Act.

It was clan hatred that led to the downfall of Argyll. His trial was unjust, and though Charles protected him from capture in London, it is unlikely he would have allowed the unfair sentence to be carried out. The escape was likely planned, making Argyll an enemy of the Government. The trial of Jerviswoode was particularly unfair, leading to his execution. The conspiracy involving Carstares was serious, aiming to remove Charles and James from power. The Covenanters, led by Renwick, declared war on their opponents. The Apologetical Declaration led to severe repression, with military execution for those who refused to abjure. Margaret Lauchleson and Margaret Wilson were drowned in Wigtown. The killing of John Brown by Claverhouse was due to his possession of ammunition and treasonable papers, not solely for his religious beliefs. These events occurred during the reign of James II.|['1.

In 1681, Argyll sailed from Holland but faced challenges. His principality was occupied, and his own House did not support him. Lowlanders like Sir Patrick Hume and Sir John Cochrane wanted to join forces with the Remnant in the west but faced obstacles. The Remnant distrusted Argyll's religious fervor and feared Claverhouse. Government ships patrolled the coasts, hindering Argyll's movements. Eventually, he was captured near Glasgow by Sir John Shaw of Greenock and executed. About 200 suspected persons suffered in Dunottar Castle. The Covenanters were subdued, and Renwick was hanged later. James sought toleration for Catholics and made changes in the government. The Kirk was divided, and the Revolution saw compromises. Prince of Wales's birth raised fears of a Catholic succession. The Prince of Orange's invasion was expected. The Privy Council in Scotland was left vulnerable, and chaos ensued after James fled. Dundee kept some troops while Perth was imprisoned. The Cameronian societies caused unrest in the south-west. Atholl held power in Edinburgh, and a Convention in Edinburgh in 1689 marked William's authority.|"['1. What challenges did Argyll face during his sailing from Holland in 1681?\nA.

In Edinburgh Castle, the Duke of Gordon was convinced to stay by Dundee and Balcarres. Dundee suggested a Jacobite gathering in Stirling. Melfort persuaded James to send a letter against his party's wishes. Atholl, who pledged to join, backed out. Dundee's life was in danger, so he rode north, following Montrose's spirit. Mackay brought Dutch regiments to Edinburgh, intimidating the Jacobites. William gained control of Stirling Castle. The Convention, led by Hamilton, rejected James and his son. William and Mary were proclaimed rulers. The Convention passed the Claim of Rights and condemned Episcopacy. Scotland faced hardships under the Restoration, with law twisted for unjust convictions. Corruption was rampant among rulers. Torture was used after plots to extract false confessions. The Covenanters suffered, clinging to their beliefs. Presbyterianism's power waned, paving the way for religious tolerance.|"['1.

"During a period when the political landscape in Scotland was tumultuous, the Convention, recognized as a Parliament by William in June, began to resemble the English Parliament for the first time since Charles I's reign. The Secretary in Scotland was William, Earl of Melville, and the Duke of Hamilton was the Royal Commissioner. However, officials like Sir James and Sir John Dalrymple faced criticism and opposition from a group of more radical Liberals known as ""the club."" This club, led by Hume of Polwarth and Montgomery of Skelmorley, pushed for swift Parliamentary liberties that William was reluctant to grant. Meanwhile, tensions rose with the emergence of Viscount Dundee in the north, leading to a confrontation between Dundee's Highland clans and the forces of Mackay, a Dutch officer supporting the Whigs.

When the Whigs, afraid of Dundee's impending arrival at Stirling with the Highland clans and Lowland cavaliers, learned of his demise, their grief turned to joy. King James's cause suffered a severe blow with the loss of the esteemed Graham, the only one capable of leading the Highland troops. Without his guidance and with doubts about General Cannon, the clans began to desert the Royal Standard. The Cameronian regiment, stationed at Dunkeld, found themselves isolated when faced with an attack by Highlanders. Despite being outnumbered, Colonel Cleland's Cameronians defended the Abbey church and castle successfully. Cleland perished in battle, causing the clans to disband. Subsequently, the Cameronians rebelled due to lack of payment, sparking unrest in the Lowlands. The Club leaders, advocating for constitutional rights, presented an address to William and Mary in London. However, some Club members conspired with Jacobites for James's restoration, leading to internal strife. Eventually, parliamentary freedom was secured, and the Kirk underwent significant changes, marking the end of a long-standing conflict between the church and the state.|"[""1.

Before December 31, the chiefs, except Glengarry and MacIan or Macdonald of Glencoe, submitted in fear of conflict. Dalrymple sought war rather than peace. By January 9, 1692, Dalrymple, in London, learned that Glencoe had not arrived by January 1, causing regret. By January 11, Dalrymple was pleased that Glencoe had not sworn the oath in time. Glencoe attempted to take the oath but faced delays due to weather and the absence of the Sheriff. Orders were issued to eradicate the Glencoe clan. On February 13, soldiers under Campbell of Glenlyon attacked Glencoe, resulting in a massacre. Despite the late arrival of Hamilton, many residents escaped. The incident was condemned as unprecedented and unjustifiable. King William, preoccupied with other matters, eventually pardoned the MacIans. The General Assembly's refusal to swear allegiance caused tension, leading to a Commission investigating the Glencoe tragedy.

In 1695, William passed an Act to establish a Scottish East India Company, aiming to promote Scottish trade. However, the Darien Expedition, intended to set up a trading post in Panama, turned into a financial disaster. The venture faced challenges from existing English companies and Spanish opposition. Despite these obstacles, Scottish investors eagerly participated, unaware of the risks. The English Parliament opposed the Scots' venture, causing panic among investors. The expedition encountered hostilities with the Spanish, leading to its eventual surrender. Scottish settlers faced starvation and harsh conditions, with some ships returning to Scotland.

At home, the country was filled with discontent due to a series of unfortunate events. William's agent in Hamburg had hindered foreigners from investing in the Scots company, leading to significant financial losses and loss of lives. English colonists were also prohibited from supporting Scottish adventurers. The situation escalated to the point where passions raged against William, reminiscent of a turbulent period in 1641. The news of the colonists' surrender only fueled the anger further. Despite the legal foundation of the Darien colony, William hesitated to support it due to potential conflicts with Spain and his English subjects. The Estates demanded compensation for the financial losses incurred. William suggested a scheme of Union between the two kingdoms, but the English Commons rejected the proposal. The passage of an Act in 1701 aimed to prevent wrongful imprisonment and delays in trials, yet cases like Nevile Payne's continued to be unresolved. The Revolution of 1688-89 had altered Scotland's relationship with England, necessitating either Union or the risk of war. The country faced challenges in agriculture, with untilled lands and tenant grievances hindering progress. Union between Scotland and England became a pressing issue, with each side facing unique challenges and uncertainties.|"[""1.

The life of the towns, their political and trading activities, was not much different from medieval times. The Scots resisted learning new skills from foreign and English artisans. Laws were made to support trades, but they didn't work well. Companies were formed but failed due to English tariffs and competition. Many energetic Scots left for abroad, finding success in business and military roles. Meanwhile, a large group of beggars relied on local hospitality. The delicate issue of adjusting tax proportions and parliamentary representation for a Union was clear. Differences in Church Government also caused tensions. The Scottish Parliament, still active after William's death, faced challenges in reaching a decision on Union. The last Scottish Parliament, divided between pro-Union and anti-Union factions, struggled with issues of religion, law, and trade.|"['1.

In 1705, tensions between England and Scotland escalated over trade disputes and political differences. England imposed harsh restrictions on Scotland, threatening military action if they didn't accept the Hanoverian succession. The Scottish people found themselves in a difficult position, with their ancient ally, France, unwilling to support them unless they proclaimed King James, a Catholic. However, the Scottish Church prohibited this move, leaving Scotland with no choice but to accept the Union. The Duke of Argyll, a strong supporter of the Union, was appointed Commissioner, further pushing for the agreement. Friction between the two nations grew, leading to conflicts like the hanging of an English captain in Scotland. As negotiations for the Union progressed, Scotland had to compromise on key issues, such as merging into one Parliament with England. Despite initial resistance, the Treaty of Union was eventually signed in 1706, marking a significant change in Scotland's political landscape.|"['1.

In the early 18th century, the political landscape in Scotland was tumultuous. The Cavaliers, led by Hamilton, were courted by Louis XIV and the Pretender, but Hamilton hesitated due to friendly warnings. On the other end, extreme Presbyterians like the Cameronians opposed the Union fiercely. Plans for armed resistance in Edinburgh caused panic, but before it could materialize, Hamilton was intimidated. The Cameronians' intentions were never formally approved. Riots erupted during parliamentary sessions, but peace was maintained by Argyll and Leven. The Treaty of Union was eventually passed in 1707 despite Hamilton's failed attempts to sabotage it. Friction over taxes and smuggling ensued. Intrigues by Colonel Hooke, acting for French interests, were exposed, leading to failed attempts to land James in Scotland. The period saw political maneuvering, religious tensions, and ultimately, the peaceful ascension of George I to the throne.|"['1.

For a year, the Scottish Jacobites, along with Bolingbroke, who fled to France and became James's Minister, mishandled the affairs of the unfortunate prince. By February 1715, the Earl of Mar, who had fallen out of favor with George I, was organizing a rebellion with the clans, expecting support from Charles XII of Sweden between March and August 1715. Charles had even invited Dean Swift to his Court, hoping to gain insights into Bolingbroke and Oxford's policies. The ill-fated uprising in 1715 was prompted by the Duke of Berwick's counsel to James, urging him to go to Scotland to avoid dishonor. The events that followed were marked by confusion and missteps, with Mar taking actions without proper authorization, leading to a series of failed attempts and missed opportunities for the Jacobites.|"[""1.

In the north, Ross-shire and Inverness faced obstacles while Lovat succeeded. Mar, leading from Perth to Dunblane, sought a ford over Forth. His Frazers and some Gordons deserted on November 11. At Ardoch, Mar learned of Argyll's approach. Mar's force took position at Sheriffmuir: the left was chaotic, the right well-ordered, but the terrain hid the wings. The Macdonalds and Macleans charged, defeating Argyll's regulars. Despite the victory, Mar's center and left fled. Argyll withdrew to Dunblane, while Mar abandoned guns and fled to Perth. The battle, though drawn, revealed Mar's weakness. Dutch reinforcements were expected for Argyll. Huntly behaved poorly, and clans began to surrender. James landed at Peterhead on December 22. James, facing adversity, saw the bleak reality. Mar struggled against Argyll, while Whig clans held the north. Argyll drove Mar's men from Fife. James, low on ammunition, faced a bleak situation. He wept as his army left Perth. James sought aid from the French Regent. Lacking supplies, James fled to France with Mar, evading a bounty on his head. The fighting clans dispersed. Argyll was dishonored despite his earlier successes.|"[""1.

"During the early 18th century in Scotland, tensions ran high due to the treatment of Scottish prisoners of war and the unpopularity of the Union with England. The country felt conquered and defenseless, leading to Jacobite hopes and intrigues. James, a Catholic, faced many challenges from England, and his son Charles Edward Stuart was born into a world of political turmoil. Meanwhile, domestic politics in Scotland saw personal strife between factions like the ""Argathelians"" and the ""Squadrone volante."" The proposed Peerage Bill, popular discontents, and resistance to taxes like the Malt Tax caused unrest. Enclosures and evictions led to uprisings, with the military getting involved.

The clans in the Highlands were not disarmed after 1715. Around 6000 muskets were brought in during the events at Glenshiel in 1719. General Wade was tasked in 1724 to assess the situation in the Highlands. Lovat had already submitted a report. He highlighted that Lowlanders paid for protection against Highland raiders. Independent Highlander companies, previously funded by the Government, were disbanded in 1717. Lovat sought a company and pay for himself. Wade estimated the clans' strength at about 22,000, split between Whigs and Jacobites. Wade recommended having independent companies at forts, cavalry stationed between Inverness and Perth, and holding Quarter Sessions at Fort William and Ruthven in Badenoch. From 1725 to 1736, Wade constructed military roads and bridges connecting the forts. James faced challenges with his Ministers and internal party conflicts. Prince Charles, James's son, displayed bravery during the siege of Gaeta in 1734. Lovat's loyalty shifted towards Prince Charles in 1736, leading to his dismissal from his positions.|"[""1.

In 1736, two smugglers, Wilson and Robertson, faced death but attempted a daring escape. Wilson, a large man, got stuck trying to flee through the widened window-bars of their cell, allowing Robertson to flee. During a church service before their execution, Robertson made a run for it, evading capture, while Wilson fought off guards. Wilson was later executed. The lieutenant of the Town Guard, John Porteous, was blamed for the chaos that ensued. The public turned against him, leading to his hanging on September 8. A mob, outraged by the events, stormed the prison, captured Porteous, and hanged him. The aftermath saw political upheaval, with the dismissal of the Provost, Wilson, and the abolition of the Town Guard. The incident left a scar on the community, sparking debates and actions that rippled through society.|"[""1.

In 1737, the Jacobites began to stir once more. A committee of five Chiefs and Lords was established to manage their activities. John Murray of Broughton went to Rome and became enamored with Prince Charles, a tall and handsome seventeen-year-old with captivating brown eyes. Murray played a significant role in the Rising of 1745. Meanwhile, the Kirk faced internal turmoil between 1720 and 1740. The teachings of French mystic Antoinette Bourignon reached Scotland, gaining traction among some divinity students, including Rev. John Simson. Simson, from a family known for its turbulence since the Reformation, faced accusations of heresy. The Assembly of 1726 branded him a heretic, leading to a split in the Kirk over doctrinal disputes, ultimately resulting in a schism. The disagreement centered around the balance between faith and works, with some clergy opposing moral preaching and advocating for congregational autonomy in electing preachers.|['1.

In 1732 and 1733, Mr. Erskine delivered sermons that upset the Assembly due to his views on patronage. He refused to apologize and, along with three others, formed a new Presbytery, citing various reasons for their separation. One of these reasons was the salary of Emeritus Professor Simson. The new Presbytery believed in the eternal binding of the Covenants on Scotland and wanted to return to old ecclesiastical practices, opposing the Act of 1736 that abolished witch burnings. The conflicts between different factions within the Kirk, such as the Burghers and Antiburghers, had long-lasting negative effects. These disputes eventually led to the significant Disruption of 1843. Meanwhile, political tensions were rising, with Jacobites preparing for action, and France being misled about the strength of the Jacobite cause. In 1744, Prince Charles, eager for war, arrived in France, ready to make his move.|"[""1.

The Prince's force was strengthened by various clans like the Macdonalds, Camerons led by Lochiel, and Macphersons under Cluny. However, the crafty Lovat and the abstention of Macleod and Macdonald of Sleat hindered the effort. Clan Chattan, led by Lady Mackintosh, and the Macgregors under James Mor also joined. Sir John Cope, with about 2500 to 3000 men, tried to resist the clans but faced challenges due to political rivalries. Charles marched south, while Cope moved north to intercept him. The clans held the Corryarrick Pass, forcing Cope to retreat to Inverness. Charles then moved to Blair Castle, gathering more supporters. As the race for Edinburgh began, Charles made a daring move, crossing the Forth and advancing towards the city, with only demoralized dragoons in his path. On September 16, Charles reached Corstorphine, while Gardiner's dragoons fell back on Coltbridge.|"[""1.

The officials communicated with the Prince through a messenger. They were asked to surrender, but they shuttled back and forth in a carriage between different locations. Eventually, Lochiel and his men burst in, surprising them. Charles then entered Holyrood Palace, while King James was declared the ruler in Edinburgh. Despite efforts to gather volunteers, Edinburgh didn't provide many. Meanwhile, Cope was preparing his troops at Dunbar. On September 20, Cope advanced towards Charles, who also started his journey. The two forces eventually faced each other near Prestonpans. The clans' tactics forced Cope to adjust his position, but he was constantly on the defensive. A local man informed Charles of a path through a marsh, which helped the clans attack. Charles cared for wounded soldiers from both sides after the battle.

Charles faced a challenging situation in England, with a bounty on his head and the French troops waiting for a victory. His aim was to influence France by invading England. While the French forces were delayed, Charles held a war council. Despite the French supplies at Stonehaven and troops in Dunkirk, they were not prepared. Charles contemplated crossing the Border, but his men preferred an independent Scotland with a Catholic king. The Prince planned a significant move near Northumberland to weaken England. However, Lord George Murray proposed a march through the west, risking Wade's forces. The Prince concentrated his troops at Dalkeith, while a diversion was created towards Carlisle. Ultimately, the Prince's army moved towards Newcastle, hoping to confront Wade at Brampton. Despite some setbacks and disagreements among the commanders, the army's spirits remained high.|"[""1.

In December, as Charles planned to meet Lord John Drummond and his Highland forces in the north, Lord John disobeyed orders. Charles left Manchester men at Carlisle, which was later taken by Cumberland, resulting in many executions. Meanwhile, Lord Lewis Gordon defeated Macleod at Inverurie and Aberdeen. Charles's army, led by Lord George, retreated admirably, reaching Penrith on December 18, where they defeated Cumberland's dragoons. On December 19, they reached Carlisle, and later forded the flooded Esk. Charles and Lord George met at Hamilton Palace on December 26. Charles stayed briefly at Dumfries and Glasgow, where he learned of Seaforth's betrayal. Lord John Drummond, Strathallan, and Lord Lewis Gordon prepared to meet Charles at Stirling, aiming to capture the castle, but faced obstacles due to weak artillery. Charles, unwell, stayed at Bannockburn House. At Falkirk, Charles's forces, including Macdonalds and Camerons, outmaneuvered Hawley's troops, leading to a surprising victory.|"['1.

During the Battle of Falkirk, Prince Charles Stuart's army faced a fierce storm that disorganized their right flank and prevented them from reloading their muskets. The left flank engaged with Hawley's forces but was outflanked and defeated. Despite the confusion, some regiments under Hawley's command managed an orderly retreat. The Prince's army, lacking discipline and facing adverse weather conditions, narrowly escaped annihilation. The accidental shooting of a young soldier sparked a blood feud among clans. As Cumberland's army approached, the chiefs believed resistance was futile due to desertions. Charles, however, was determined to face Cumberland, but the retreat from Culloden later proved disastrous. The Prince's forces were ill-prepared and hungry, leading to a defeat that could have been avoided.|"[""1.

The fight began with a clash of cannons, where the clans suffered heavy losses. Their few guns were ineffective, and their right side was vulnerable due to a fallen wall. After a risky delay, Lord George ordered an attack despite a fierce storm of sleet. He and Lochiel charged in with swords drawn. The Camerons, Clan Chattan, and Macleans led the assault, met by Wolfe's regiment. The Highlanders broke through Barrel's regiment, overran the guns, but fell to the bayonets of the second line. The Macdonalds on the left faced cavalry and grape-shot, losing leaders like Keppoch and Macdonnell. Charles tried to rally his men but had to retreat. The battle was a perilous move for Cumberland, with a ruthless pursuit. Despite brutal orders, only around a thousand men were lost. The Highlanders endured atrocities but remained defiant. France's aid was futile, leading to the Prince's escape. The aftermath saw executions, exiles, and betrayals, with the Cause's spirit persisting. Religious persecution targeted Episcopalian clergy, and harsh laws suppressed Jacobitism.|"[""1.

In 1754, an Act was passed that gave the forfeited estates of the Jacobites back to the Crown. These estates were restored in 1784, with the profits intended for improving the Highlands. Tenants who cooperated received better terms, while Jacobite tenants faced eviction for unpaid rent. On May 14, 1752, Campbell of Glenure was shot while attempting to evict tenants in Appin. James Stewart of the Glens was wrongly convicted and hanged for the crime. Allan Breck Stewart was involved but escaped to France. The murder caused great turmoil, rare in Highland history. The assimilation of Scotland to England between 1745 and 1780 saw significant historical events. Scotland's literary Renaissance and political alliances with England are notable aspects of this period. The Reform Bill of 1832 marked a turning point in Scottish politics, with Radicalism gaining momentum.|['1. What event led to the restoration of forfeited estates of the Jacobites in 1784?\nA.

"In the 18th century, the word ""enthusiasm"" gained significance in literature, religion, and politics, despite the initial aversion to it. By 1740, a shift towards enthusiasm and a return to nature began, eventually influencing the Romantic movement with figures like Coleridge and Scott. The religious landscape saw changes as well, with the Wesley movement reshaping the Church in England and enthusiasm spreading in Scotland's Kirk. The issue of lay patronage of livings evolved over time, leading to conflicts like the Strathbogie imbroglio. Dr. Chalmers championed a return to the primitive Knoxian rule, advocating for the people's right to elect their ministers. The ecclesiastical life of Scotland, influenced by Knoxian ideals, continues to be felt, even today, shaping the religious landscape. The Scottish universities have also seen transformations, benefiting from increased wealth and generosity, offering efficient education rooted in medieval foundations. Roman military life in Scotland during Agricola's time to Lollius Urbicus's invasion can be explored through works like Mr. Curie's 'A Roman Frontier Post and Its People' and Dr. Macdonald's 'The Roman Wall in Scotland,' shedding light on the relics and life of that era."|"['1.
