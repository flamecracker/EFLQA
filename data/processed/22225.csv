Josie and Mary Louise struggled to find the five-acre plot, despite having a map. Eventually, they stumbled upon a rocky area at the end of a desolate lane, matching the description. Covered in rocks with little vegetation, the land's low value made sense. Surrounded by well-kept farms, the rocky valley was fenced off. Josie noted Mr. Cragg's peculiar situation, owning only this rocky land after selling valuable property. They observed the rocky field from a distance, finding it unremarkable. Josie deduced that Mr. Cragg had liquidated his assets, raising suspicions. Mary Louise suspected him of being a miser due to a large sum of money changing hands with another individual. They planned for Mary Louise to seek work from Mr. Cragg to investigate further, confident in uncovering the truth.|"['1.

Josie had a clever plan to gain an audience with Old Swallowtail, but a slip of the tongue led her to pretend she had real estate to sell. Now seated in Mr. Cragg's office, she needed a new strategy. The room was small, with a dim, unwashed window facing the street. Josie's keen eyes noticed a partition that likely led to Old Swallowtail's private room, locked securely. Mr. Cragg, a man of stiff dignity, demanded to know her business. Josie had to think fast. She had intended to sew dresses for Mary Louise but now needed a reason to stay in Cragg's Crossing.

"""He has surrounded her with privations, if not with actual want,"" said she. ""Only the night before last he was in such a violent rage that he tried to smash everything in the house. That is surely an evil example to set before the child, who has a temper of her own, perhaps inherited from him. He has, however, bought her a new dress--the first one she has had in more than a year--so perhaps the old man at times relents toward his granddaughter and tries to atone for his shortcomings.""

""Perhaps,"" he presently remarked, ""Mr. Cragg has but little money to buy dresses with. I do not imagine that a man so well educated as you report him to be would prefer to live in a hovel, if he could afford anything better.""

They were to have Ingua's dress fitted by Miss Huckins that morning, and as Josie was fast asleep Mary Louise went across to the cottage to go with the girl on her errand. To her surprise she found old Mr. Cragg sitting upon his little front porch, quite motionless and with his arms folded across his chest. He stared straight ahead and was evidently in deep thought. This was odd, because he was usually at his office an hour or more before this time.

Mary Louise hesitated whether to advance or retreat. She had never as yet come into personal contact with Ingua's grandfather and, suspecting him of many crimes, she shrank from"|"[""1.

"""I'm not sure about that,"" he replied, staring intently at Ingua. ""Old Swallertail gave me this bill not ten minutes ago and said his granddaughter could buy whatever she wanted within the money limit. The whole thing seemed suspicious. Just a few days back, Old Cragg bought Ingua a dress and paid for it, but now he suddenly wants her to get ten dollars' worth of shoes and things. Doesn't that seem odd?"" he questioned.

""Because it's the first time he's spent money on the kid in ages, always talking about being poor and how prices are rising due to the war. If he's that broke and suddenly hands me a ten-dollar bill for his kid's stuff, something's fishy. I got burned by a similar bill before, so I won't hand over any goods until I confirm if it's real money or not.""

""Tomorrow, a sharp salesman from the city is coming. He'll quickly tell us if the bill is fake. If he approves it, then Ingua can make the trade. But I won't take any risks,"" he concluded.

""We'll get the items, Ingua,"" she assured. ""Wasn't it wonderful of your grandfather to be so generous despite having little money? And the ten dollars will suit you perfectly. I just wish there was another store at the Crossing to trade at,"" she added.

In the five-acre stone property owned by Mr. Cragg, there is a hidden cavern where counterfeit money is being made. Ned Joselyn was seen leaving with fake bills, and Old Swallowtail warned him to use the money honestly. Another man from the gang was operating the printing press. Josie O'Gorman, a young detective, is working on gathering evidence to catch the gang. She plans to involve the Secret Service once she has all the proof in place. A ten-dollar bill given to a storekeeper by Mr. Cragg accidentally reveals the counterfeit operation. Josie and her friend Mary Louise visit the store to investigate further.

Josie smiled at Ingua's quaint speech. She sympathized with Ingua's unwavering belief in the honesty of the Cragg family, even though her grandfather was involved in counterfeiting money. Josie shared how her city experience helped her spot counterfeit money easily. She appreciated Mary Louise's influence in helping Ingua improve her speech and even convincing her grandfather to give money, which no one else could have achieved. Josie explained that Mary Louise's genuine and sweet personality naturally wins people over, unlike their more assertive natures. Ingua's new outfit, bought with the help of Mary Louise and Josie, brought excitement to Cragg's Crossing. The generous additions to her wardrobe, including silk gloves, delighted Ingua.

The hotel at the Crossing was not grand, resembling more of a house than a business. It had a small office with a desk, chairs, and sawdust boxes for spitting. The Hoppers ran the place well, especially known for their twenty-five cent farm dinners. On Sundays, they served chicken hoping to catch passing tourists. The building had two guest rooms upstairs, but they were rarely used except for stranded travelers. Meanwhile, Nan was at her father's side, revealing her plan to outsmart a girl named Josie who had been prying into their affairs. Nan had intercepted a coded message intended for her father, who was a government worker. She was determined to thwart Josie's investigation and prove her own cleverness. Old Swallowtail, her father, watched her with a grin, a rare sight that Nan did not notice. Despite the serious situation, he found some amusement in his daughter's boldness.|"['1.

A detective must think fast. Josie's mind raced. She realized that if Nan, Old Swallowtail's daughter, found out about Josie's case against her father, things could go wrong. Josie respected Nan's intelligence and didn't want to face her in a battle of wits again. It was crucial that Nan remained unaware of Josie's plan to arrest her father for counterfeiting. Josie also knew that Ingua might spill all she knew to her mother, Nan. So, she decided to mislead Nan by saying she was on a wild-goose chase looking for a missing man. Nan seemed to know more than Josie thought, but Josie stayed composed. Later, Old Swallowtail arrived, and Nan and Ingua were surprised to learn Josie's true identity.

The stranger stealthily navigated through the town toward the west, crossing the bridge and winding through the connecting path to the lane. After reaching old Cragg's stone lot, he spent an hour among the massive rocks on the hillside, where Josie had found the entrance to the underground cave. Despite his efforts, Mr. Sinclair didn't uncover the entrance and eventually retraced his steps back to town.
