Jumper the Hare felt relieved and safe as he sat still, hidden in the snow. Whitey the Snowy Owl was nearby, but mistook Jumper for a snow heap due to his stillness.

Every day, Whitefoot the Wood Mouse grew sadder. Instead of playing joyfully in the Green Forest, he sat moping as evening approached. Even the beautiful song of Melody the Wood Thrush brought him sorrow rather than happiness. The joy of others seemed to deepen his unhappiness.
