Cousin Jack decided to teach the children a fun game using paper strips and scissors. He handed out long strips of white paper, instructing the kids to cut through the middle without tearing it. The challenge was to do it quickly but carefully. As the children started cutting, Cousin Jack encouraged them to find the right balance between speed and precision.
