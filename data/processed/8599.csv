"The promises made by the sorceress queen did not reassure King Beder, given his past experiences with enchantment. However, old Abdallah assured him that the queen's powers did not extend to him and that he could protect King Beder. The next day, the queen visited Abdallah's shop again, reminding him of his promise to send King Beder with her. Abdallah expressed his concerns about his nephew's safety to the queen, who reassured him that she would not harm King Beder. She then unveiled her beauty to King Beder, who was captivated by her appearance.

Afterward, the queen presented King Beder with a bag of gold coins and a horse to ride. As they set off, the people's reactions to the queen made King Beder realize the true nature of Queen Labe.

King Beder received advice from Abdallah, who warned him about the sorceress's cake and how to counter her magic. He was instructed to eat a cake secretly given by Abdallah and then offer the sorceress a cake from him. The sorceress tried to transform him into an animal, but her spell failed.

Queen Labe, a sorceress, was transformed into a beautiful mare by King Beder. Overwhelmed by her new form, she shed tears, a sight never seen in a mare before. King Beder, unable to reverse the spell, led her to a stable but none of the bridles fit her. They journeyed to old Abdallah's, where the mare was finally bridled. Abdallah advised King Beder to return to his kingdom on the mare. As he left the city, he encountered an old man and woman who showed great interest in the mare. The old woman offered to buy the mare, and when King Beder challenged her to produce the money, she did. The old man warned King Beder about the city's strict no-lying policy.

Abdallah, addressing Queen Gulnare, expressed his willingness to serve the King of Persia if the lady he proposed for marriage agreed and the King of Persia allowed him to reside at court. This proposal prompted the King of Persia to suggest another marriage to Queen Gulnare. Initially confused, she realized he meant her son, King Beder, and gladly approved. King Beder, however, had already given his heart to the Princess of Samandal. Queen Gulnare accepted his choice and suggested involving the King of Samandal to seek his daughter's consent. With a magical intervention, the King of Samandal agreed to the union, and the Princess Giauhara accepted, expressing her obedience to her father's will.

The sultan planned to marry Nouronnihar off but found his sons in love with her. He proposed a challenge: the princes must find a rare curiosity, and the one with the most extraordinary object would marry Nouronnihar. The princes agreed and set off on separate journeys.

Prince Ahmed agreed to buy the apple for forty purses if it cured the sick person. The experiment succeeded, and the prince eagerly awaited the return of a caravan to take the apple back to the Indies. In the meantime, he explored the wonders of Samarcand, including the beautiful valley of Sogda.

Overwhelmed with gratitude, he expressed his devotion to the fairy and asked to be admitted to her court. The fairy, being her own mistress, proposed to accept him not as a slave but as her husband. She showed him the splendor of her palace, filled with precious jewels and marbles. After a delightful meal, the fairy led Prince Ahmed to a feast where they were entertained by music and a lavish spread. The fairy and the prince enjoyed days of celebration and joy. After six months, Prince Ahmed expressed a desire to visit his father, seeking the fairy's permission. She advised him on how to conduct himself and provided him with an escort for his journey. Prince Ahmed left for his father's capital, where he was warmly welcomed by the people and embraced by the sultan with great joy.|['1.

Prince Ahmed recounted to the Sultan of the Indies about the mysterious incident when he shot an arrow that disappeared in a vast plain. Despite losing in the contest, he didn't complain but sought to find his arrow alone. After searching where his brothers' arrows were found, he finally found his arrow near some rocks. Prince Ahmed interpreted this event positively, believing it held a secret advantage for him. He expressed contentment and happiness to the Sultan. The Sultan allowed him to visit often but asked him to reveal where he could be found if needed. Prince Ahmed, however, kept this information as part of the mystery. Over time, some viziers misled the Sultan, making him suspicious of Prince Ahmed's intentions. To uncover the truth, the Sultan secretly sought the help of a sorceress to discover where Prince Ahmed went after leaving the court.|"['1.

Prince Ahmed set out early the next morning without saying goodbye to the sultan or his court, as was customary. The magician watched him leave, but lost sight of him as he disappeared into the rocky terrain. She suspected he had gone underground to a place inhabited by genies or fairies. Unable to find an entrance, she returned to the sultan and assured him she would uncover Prince Ahmed's actions in due time. The sultan, pleased with her efforts, granted her time and patience to unravel the mystery. Meanwhile, the magician, aware of Prince Ahmed's monthly visits to the fairy Pari Banou, devised a plan. Pretending to be ill, she caught the prince's attention and convinced him to help her. Prince Ahmed, showing kindness, offered assistance, unknowingly aiding the deceptive magician.

Two women, following Fairy Pari Banou's orders, took the magician to a luxurious room and tended to her. They gave her a special potion from the fountain of lions to cure her fever. The magician pretended to be ill but drank it. After lying down, she claimed to be instantly cured. Eager to leave, she was led to Pari Banou's grand hall. The fairy graciously allowed her to continue her journey. The magician, in awe of the splendor, couldn't express her thanks. Pari Banou bid her farewell, and the magician left.

The Sultan of the Indies, despite his confidence in Prince Ahmed's good nature, felt uneasy after the old sorceress's warnings. He thanked her for the caution and sought advice from his advisors. They suggested arresting Prince Ahmed to prevent any harm. However, the magician proposed a different approach. She advised the Sultan to ask Prince Ahmed to use his fairy wife's powers to procure a tent that could shelter the entire army. This way, the prince would be overwhelmed with impossible demands, causing him to retreat from the world, ensuring the Sultan's safety without resorting to extreme measures. The Sultan, impressed by the magician's wisdom, decided to follow her advice. The next day, he asked Prince Ahmed to seek the fairy's help in providing a miraculous tent for the army, showing trust in his son's influence over his fairy wife.|"[""1.

Prince Ahmed was taken aback by the Sultan's request, finding it incredibly difficult, even impossible. He doubted the power of genies and fairies to provide such a tent. Although he had married the fairy Pari Banou, he had never asked her for anything beyond her kindness. Reluctantly, he agreed to ask his wife for the pavilion, fearing he might displease her. When he returned, the fairy noticed his distress and pressed him for an answer. Eventually, Prince Ahmed revealed the Sultan's request, causing the fairy to explain how a woman he once pitied had betrayed his secret happiness.

Once upon a time, a fairy named Pari Banou comforted a troubled prince named Ahmed. The prince was anxious because he had imposed a rule on himself to only love the fairy and not ask for any favors. This made him hesitant to fulfill his father's request for water from the fountain of lions, which could cure any fever. The fairy reassured Prince Ahmed that she could easily grant his father's wish. To prove it, she showed him a magical pavilion that could shelter armies. Prince Ahmed was amazed and apologized for doubting her abilities. He took the pavilion to his father, who was astounded by its size-changing magic. The sultan, now feeling jealous of the prince's powerful connections, asked him to bring water from the fountain of lions. Prince Ahmed, torn between his loyalty to his father and his concern for his wife's well-being, hesitated to fulfill this challenging task.|"[""1.

The following day, Prince Ahmed visited the fairy Pari Banou and recounted all that had occurred at his father's court. He described the tent gift and the new request from his father. The fairy advised against fulfilling the new desire, as it was wicked. She provided him with a ball of thread, instructions for two horses, and a bottle for water. The next morning, Prince Ahmed followed the fairy's guidance, passing the lions at the castle gates to fill the bottle at the fountain. He safely returned to the sultan's palace, where the lions escorted him to the gates. Prince Ahmed presented the water to the sultan, who was grateful and curious about how he succeeded. The sultan's jealousy grew, leading him to request a man of unique characteristics, causing concern for Prince Ahmed.|"['1.

Prince Ahmed doubted the existence of the man his father described but was urged by the Sultan to find the fairy that could perform extraordinary feats. The fairy assured Prince Ahmed that the man, Schaibar, was real and not to fear him. The fairy summoned Schaibar, a small man with a massive iron bar, who arrived with a fearsome appearance. Despite Schaibar's intimidating look, Prince Ahmed greeted him calmly. It was revealed that Schaibar was the fairy's brother and was willing to help Prince Ahmed. The next day, Prince Ahmed and Schaibar approached the Sultan's palace, causing panic among the people. Upon reaching the council-hall, the Sultan, startled by Schaibar's presence, met a tragic end when Schaibar struck him down.

The grand vizier advised the sultan to give Prince Camaralzaman more time to consider marriage. When the year passed with no change in the prince's stance, the sultan, in a council meeting, urged him to marry for the good of the state. The prince's refusal angered the sultan, who then ordered his imprisonment in an old tower. Despite being confined, Camaralzaman found solace in his books. One night, a fairy named Maimoune visited him and was captivated by his appearance. As she departed, she encountered a rebellious genie named Danhasch.

Maimoune, a powerful spirit, challenged Danhasch to speak the truth about the princess in China. Danhasch described the princess's beauty and the luxurious palaces her father, King Gaiour, built for her. Despite suitors' interest, the princess refused to marry, valuing her freedom and the comforts provided by her father. When a rich king proposed to her, she rejected him, angering her father. Consequently, the king confined her to a single apartment, believing her to be mad. He even offered her hand in marriage to any physician who could cure her.

Maimoune and Danhasch, two supernatural beings, were in a dispute over the beauty of their respective charges - a prince and a princess. To settle the argument, they decided to awaken the prince and princess one after the other and observe their reactions. Maimoune transformed into a gnat and stung the prince to wake him up. The prince, upon waking, saw the sleeping Princess of China next to him and was captivated by her beauty, exclaiming with admiration. He even kissed her, but she remained asleep due to an enchantment. The prince's reaction amazed both Maimoune and Danhasch. Ultimately, another magical being named Caschcasch was summoned to judge the beauty of the prince and princess.

For a whole year, we lived in peace and love. As my wealth grew, I decided on a sea voyage for trade. In Balsora, I bought a ship and loaded it with goods from Bagdad. With fair winds, we sailed to the Indies, reaching land on the twentieth day. The sight was strange; the town was still, its people turned to stone. I explored further, finding a grand palace with guards frozen in place. In a room, a queen sat adorned in gold and pearls. The palace was richly decorated with Indian fabrics and silver art. A throne of gold and a diamond as large as an ostrich egg caught my eye. Curiosity led me to a chamber where a young man prayed, the only living soul in the petrified city.

The door was slightly ajar, so I pushed it open and entered. Standing tall before a niche, I recited a prayer aloud: 'Thank God for the safe voyage and protection until we return home. Listen to my plea.' The young man looked at me, curious about my presence. I shared my journey and asked about the desolate city. He promised to reveal the city's tragic fate and his miraculous survival. He explained that the city worshiped false gods until a thunderous voice commanded them to worship the one true God.

The sailors spent several days unloading my cargo and replacing it with precious items from the palace - jewels, gold, and money.

Once upon a time, a princess bravely fought a genie in a fierce battle. Despite her victory, she was fatally wounded by the genie's fiery attacks. As she lay dying, she explained to her father, the sultan, how the genie's defeat had come at a great cost to her. The princess's body was consumed by flames, leaving only ashes behind. The sultan, overwhelmed with grief, mourned the loss of his daughter and fainted from sorrow. The tragic news spread throughout the kingdom, and the people mourned the princess's demise for seven days.

Once upon a time, a young man inherited a vast fortune from his father. He spent his wealth recklessly, only to realize later that money is fleeting and time is precious. Regretting his past actions, he decided to sell off his belongings and embark on a journey to the East Indies.

I was shocked to discover the ship had left without me. I searched everywhere but could not find any of the fellow travelers who had arrived with me. Eventually, I spotted the ship sailing away in the distance, disappearing quickly. My heart sank, and I was overwhelmed with sadness. I cried, beat my head and chest, and collapsed on the ground in agony. I regretted not being content with my previous voyage's earnings. As the sun set, the sky darkened suddenly, caused by a massive bird flying towards me. I realized it was a roc, and the large white object nearby must be its egg. I tied myself to the bird's leg, hoping it would carry me away from the deserted island. The next morning, the roc flew off with me, and after a wild ride, it dropped me in a valley surrounded by mountains. The valley was filled with huge diamonds and terrifyingly large serpents. I sought refuge in a cave, terrified of the serpents lurking outside. The next day, I cautiously emerged from the cave, still trembling from fear.|"['1.

I always thought the tales of the valley of diamonds were mere stories until I experienced it firsthand. Merchants devised a clever plan to obtain jewels from the valley. They would visit when eagles had young ones, tossing meat into the valley. Diamonds would stick to the meat, and as the eagles carried the meat to their nests, the merchants would scare them away, claiming the diamonds. I thought I was trapped in the valley until I saw a way out. I gathered diamonds, tied meat to myself, and let the eagles carry me to their nest. Surprised merchants saw my diamonds and were amazed. We left the valley, encountered giant serpents, and reached the Isle of Roha, known for camphor trees.

In my younger days, I took adventurous voyages that made me forget the dangers I faced. But as I grew older, the lack of purpose wearied me. I embarked on a journey from Bagdad to Balsora with valuable goods, sailing with merchants. We traded at various ports until a fierce storm hit us at sea, driving us off course. Struggling, we reached an island port inhabited by savage dwarves covered in red hair. They overpowered us and took our ship to another island.

The enormous giant returned, devouring another of our group before sleeping and snoring until morning. Faced with a terrible fate, some comrades considered leaping into the sea rather than enduring such a strange death. One brave individual suggested a plan to rid themselves of the tyrant. They constructed rafts from timber on the coast, preparing for a daring escape. In a bold move, they blinded the giant, fleeing to the shore and launching the rafts. The giants pursued, hurling stones and sinking all but one raft. Rowing desperately, they evaded the giants but faced the mercy of the sea's wrath.

I was fortunate to find myself stranded on an island after a shipwreck. The island provided us with fruit and fresh water, saving our lives. However, our misfortune had left us disheartened. The next morning, we explored the island and were captured by black men who intended to fatten us up to eat us. They fed us a herb to dull our senses and later rice to plump us up. Suspecting their plan, I avoided eating too much and managed to keep my wits about me. While my companions were eaten, I fell ill but survived. Eventually, I escaped and encountered people gathering pepper. They spoke my language and were surprised by my story. They took me to their king, who treated me well.

As I approached the bottom of the cave, a dim light revealed a vast underground chamber about fifty fathoms deep. The air was thick with a foul stench emanating from numerous corpses strewn about. I could almost hear their last sighs. After leaving my coffin, I wept in solitude, lamenting my fate. I scolded myself for my greed, wishing I had perished in a storm instead.

We sailed past many islands, including the Isle of Bells, about ten days from Serendib. The Isle of Bells has mines producing lead, Indian canes, and camphor. The king of the Isle of Kela, rich and powerful, also rules the Isle of Bells. The inhabitants are barbaric, still consuming human flesh. After trading, I sailed to Bagdad with riches.

I bought goods, waited for a ship, and set sail with merchants. On a desert island, we found a roc egg. The merchants broke it, angering the rocs. They attacked our ship, killing all but me.

When I ventured further into the island, I encountered an elderly man who seemed frail. Sitting by a stream, I initially thought he was a fellow shipwreck survivor. Upon approaching him, he gestured for me to carry him across the stream to gather fruit. I obliged, but to my surprise, the feeble man turned out to be strong and clung tightly to my neck, almost strangling me. Despite my struggles, he forced me to gather and eat fruit all day, never leaving my side. One day, I discovered a calabash filled with grape juice that lifted my spirits. The man, wanting some, got drunk and danced recklessly on my shoulders. When he loosened his grip, I seized the chance to crush his head with a stone, finally freeing myself from his tyranny. Rescued by a passing ship, I was taken to a city where I joined merchants in gathering cocoa-nuts in a forest filled with apes.

For two months, I played a dangerous game, killing an elephant daily from different trees. One day, the elephants changed their usual path and surrounded me with a deafening noise. Frozen with fear, I dropped my weapons as the largest elephant uprooted the tree I was on. He lifted me onto his back and led the others to a hill covered in elephant bones. I realized this was their burial ground, a message for me to stop hunting them for their teeth. Returning to the city, I met my patron, who thought I was lost. Overjoyed by my survival and the ivory we collected, he granted me freedom and riches. Grateful, I declined his offer and prepared to return home, having learned a valuable lesson about respect for nature.|['1.
