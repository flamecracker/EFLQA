In the meadow, Mr. Meadowlark flew towards the swampy area where the rushes grew to find his friend, the Red-winged Blackbird. Perched on a cattail, the Blackbird informed Mr. Meadowlark that their mutual friend, Bobby Bobolink, would arrive later than expected due to the delayed season. Mr. Meadowlark expressed admiration for Bobby's joyful singing, contrasting it with his own sweet but different melody. The Blackbird complimented his own striking appearance, but acknowledged Bobby's unique charm with his black, white, and buff feathers. Bobby Bobolink, known for his late arrivals from the South's rice fields, was expected soon in Pleasant Valley.

Mr. Red-winged Blackbird agreed with Mr. Crow and was about to mention how carefree Mr. Crow's winter life in the South seemed, with Farmer Green in Pleasant Valley year-round. But a sound from the meadow caught his attention. Mr. Meadowlark was enjoying Bobby's songs, joined by Jolly Robin and Rusty Wren. Despite Rusty's summer house chores, he couldn't resist visiting the meadow to see his friends. Mr. Red-winged Blackbird greeted Bobby with joy, admiring his singing skills.

The lady in the meadow was always delighted by Bobby Bobolink's singing. His friends, although they sang for her too, were not disheartened when Bobby won her over and stopped their serenades. Mr. Meadowlark, an admirer of Bobby's voice, thought of inviting him to join the Pleasant Valley Singing Society. He shared this idea with Buddy Brown Thrasher, who was not immediately enthusiastic. Being a discerning singer himself, Buddy wanted Bobby to pass a test before joining the society.

Mr. Meadowlark decided to return to the meadow after meeting everyone, where he found Bobby Bobolink still singing joyfully. Bobby's singing was so captivating that Mr. Meadowlark couldn't wait for it to end. He explained to Bobby that they have singing sessions almost every nice day and that Bobby's husband needn't attend every time. However, newcomers like Bobby needed to sing before the Society to become members. Despite some skepticism from others, Bobby sang a rapid and beautiful song that amazed everyone. Some suspected he had help from hidden friends, but it was all Bobby's talent.

"""It was wonderful!"" everyone exclaimed, except for Buddy Brown Thrasher. He grumbled that he made a mistake because he didn't know the song himself and found it too fast for his liking. They had to find a good spot for their nest. Bobby Bobolink suggested the center of the meadow, while Mrs. Bobolink preferred a moist area near Cedar Swamp for comfort in hot weather and easy access to water. They gathered weed stems, leaves, and grass for the nest, making the outside sturdy and the inside soft. Bobby made sure to hide the nest from predators like Henry Hawk by bending grass stalks over it. They kept the nest location secret to prevent theft by Mr. Crow, Jasper Jay, or Mr. Blackbird.

Bobby Bobolink and his wife had a delightful secret to share. In their nest, five pointed, grayish-white eggs rested. Bobby sang with even more joy, and the neighbors noticed his increased musicality. Soon, the reason for his happiness became evident as Bobby and his family were busy gathering food. Mrs. Bobolink took great care to conceal the nest, moving cautiously when leaving or returning to prevent others from discovering it. However, one day, Mrs. Bobolink faced a moment of panic when she spotted Johnnie Green approaching with a tin pail. She feared he was after her nest, not realizing he was merely searching for strawberries. Mrs. Bobolink regretted not heeding her husband's advice about the nest's location.

Mr. Crow boasted, revealing a surprising secret about their friend, the Skunk Blackbird. With a mocking laugh, he flew off before anyone could respond, a trick he often played. Nearby, Mr. Catbird lived in lilac bushes near Farmer Green's garden. He enjoyed mimicking sounds, especially teasing the cat. When she stalked by, he would mimic her meows, much to her annoyance. Despite this, he was beloved by other birds for his kindness and help in times of need. Feeling mischievous one day, Mr. Catbird decided to prank Bobby Bobolink and his wife by imitating their songs. However, his attempts turned into strange sounds, leaving the Bobolinks puzzled.

Bobby Bobolink found joy in laughter and song, ignoring the Hermit's warnings. Unlike Mr. Crow, he flew in zigzags, singing with zest.
