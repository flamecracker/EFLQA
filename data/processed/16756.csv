Picnics are fun but must eventually end. As the shadows grew longer, Mr. Bobbsey realized his coat was missing, worrying about the money and papers in its pockets.

The trucks returned to Lakeport without any more accidents, taking a longer route back. As they approached the town, the children began to disembark near their homes.

"Mr. Bobbsey chuckled and reached further under the table, causing a little scuffle with Snoop as the cat tried to keep hold of the item. Snoop clung tightly with teeth and claws, getting dragged across the smooth floor. Mrs. Bobbsey explained that the fur piece was left on the hall table after the picnic. Snoop mistook it for a strange animal and took it away. The fur piece resembled an animal with yellow glass eyes and four little legs attached. Mr. Bobbsey suggested a visit to Meadow Brook Farm and the Bolton County Fair. The school's delayed opening due to repairs gave the family time to plan. Daddy Bobbsey called the younger twins ""Fairy"" and ""Fireman"" as he ushered them to bed.

At the County Fair, the Bobbsey twins, Flossie and Freddie, were safely strapped to their wooden lions, and Nan was capable of looking after herself. Mr. Bobbsey opted for a seat in one of the gilded cars for older individuals who preferred not to ride wooden animals. He observed Bob Guess efficiently collecting tickets for the carousel. A boy near the merry-go-round dropped iron rings, including a few brass ones, into a hollow arm for riders to try and catch. The challenge was to grab the brass ring for a free ride. Nan almost caught it but missed, as did others. When a girl on a camel behind Nan picked up the brass ring, she offered it to Nan. Later, they all enjoyed lemonade. The Bobbsey twins had a lot of fun at the fair, exploring prize cattle, hogs, and bulls, but lost track of Freddie, who wandered off to the stable with the racehorses.|['1.

As many stablemen were busy outside with their animals, some leading them back from the track and others preparing for the next race, not many people were in the stable when Freddie wandered in. He found a horse in a box stall and managed to climb onto its back by standing on a keg. The horse walked out onto the race track with Freddie holding on tight. Just as a race was about to start, the horse began trotting around the track, mistaking the bell for a signal to race. Despite Freddie's attempts to stop the horse, it only went faster. A jockey noticed the situation and raced after them. The commotion caught the attention of Mr. Bobbsey and the other children, who saw Freddie riding off on the horse with a jockey in pursuit.|"['Question 1: Why did Freddie wander into the stable?\nA) To watch the race\nB) To find a horse to ride\nC) To look for Mr. Bobbsey\nD) To help the stablemen\nE) To get a drink from a keg', ""Question 2: How did Freddie manage to climb onto the horse's back?\nA) By using a ladder\nB) By standing on a keg\nC) By asking the jockey for help\nD) By pulling himself up\nE) By using a rope"", 'Question 3: Why did the horse start trotting around the track?\nA) It mistook the bell for a signal to race\nB) Freddie kicked it to go faster\nC) It was trying to escape\nD) It was following the jockey\nE) It was tired of standing still', 'Question 4: Who noticed the situation with Freddie and the horse?\nA) Mr. Bobbsey\nB) The stablemen\nC) The other children\nD) The jockey\nE) The race officials', 'Question 5: What was the reaction of Mr. Bobbsey and the other children when they saw Freddie on the horse?\nA) They laughed\nB) They cheered\nC) They were worried\nD) They ignored it\nE) They joined the race', ""Question 6: What did the horse do when Freddie tried to stop it?\nA) It slowed down\nB) It stopped immediately\nC) It only went faster\nD) It turned around\nE) It followed Freddie's commands""]"|['A) To watch the race', 'B) By standing on a keg', 'A) It mistook the bell for a signal to race', 'D) The jockey', 'C) They were worried', 'C) It only went faster']
The Bobbsey family was relieved when the jockey caught Freddie as he rode his horse. Mr. Bobbsey promised to take them to the fair again soon. He wanted to talk to some people he had met and especially to Mr. Blipper. The twins, along with Harry, were gathering corn in the field. While Flossie and Freddie shelled corn, the older ones played hide and seek. Flossie wandered off and took a nap in the corn, causing a brief scare. Mr. Bobbsey fulfilled his promise and took the children to the Bolton County Fair the next day, with everyone going along. Uncle Daniel and Aunt Sarah planned to visit the fair on a different day.|['1.

Bert and his family were concerned about the strong wind blowing that day. Bert worried if the wind was too strong for the big balloon to go up. His father shared his concern, suspecting a storm approaching. Mrs. Bobbsey comforted the disappointed children, assuring them they could try again the next day. Meanwhile, Freddie's playful antics with a pumpkin caused laughter and a rolling race down a grassy hill. Fortunately, the pumpkin reached the bottom first, avoiding any potential harm to Freddie. The children then enjoyed a merry-go-round ride, with Nan receiving a special ride for catching the brass ring. Despite the wind and possible storm, the family found joy in the simple pleasures of the day.|['1.

"""They're getting ready to send it up!"" exclaimed Harry as they approached the balloon. Mr. Bobbsey explained the concept of gas making the balloon rise. The big bag, already partly filled with gas, swayed with a network of strong cords attached to a large square basket. The basket had ropes tied to bags of sand, anchoring the balloon to the ground. The Bobbsey twins and their relatives inspected the balloon closely. Flossie and Freddie, accidentally separated, found themselves near the balloon basket. Ignored by the excited crowd, they climbed into the basket and snuggled in blankets. The balloon unexpectedly took off with the children, causing panic. The balloon man reassured that the balloon would gently descend when the gas ran out, likening it to a parachute. An anxious Mrs. Bobbsey was comforted by the man's words, knowing a search party would be organized to find the children."|"['1.

As the commotion unfolded below and a rescue team prepared to save Flossie and Freddie, the two children were safe in the balloon basket. They were secure for the moment, unable to fall unless they climbed out. Drifting high above, they avoided obstacles, with no other balloons or planes in sight. Nearby, a broken airplane couldn't take off until repairs were made. Flossie found the gentle motion enjoyable, akin to soaring with birds. Freddie cautioned her from looking over the edge to prevent accidents. They explored the basket's contents, finding mysterious objects, snacks, and blankets that shielded them from rain. Suddenly, the balloon descended toward a lake, landing softly on an island. The children tumbled out unharmed, surrounded by fallen items.|"[""1.

At the fairgrounds, everyone eagerly pitched in to help Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey rescue Flossie and Freddie, who were taken away in a runaway balloon. The owners of the balloon quickly devised a plan. While Nan, Bert, and Harry stayed with Mr. Blackford, who offered them a ride home in his car, Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey, accompanied by some balloon handlers, set off to the lake to rent a boat and search for the missing children. As they prepared to leave in Mr. Blackford's car, Bob Guess rushed over through the rain. The storm had closed down the fair's attractions, including the merry-go-round. The group learned that the balloon had been spotted descending near Hemlock Island. Despite the gloomy weather, they set out on a motorboat, guided by Captain Craig, who believed they would find the children on the island. The rain and fog made the journey challenging, but they pressed on, determined to locate Flossie and Freddie.|"['1.

"""I believe they'll be okay,"" her husband reassured. ""Flossie and Freddie, along with Bert and Nan, have been in tough situations before, but the Bobbsey family's luck usually holds up. They manage to come out of it fine."" ""I'm going to check on them,"" said the captain. ""At least we're safe on the shore. We can't sink."" The fog momentarily lifted, revealing a rocky shore with hemlock trees. ""We've run straight into the rocks!"" Captain Craig muttered, peering through the closing fog. Meanwhile, let's see what's happening with Freddie and Flossie, the younger Bobbsey twins. They had fallen from the balloon basket during a storm onto Hemlock Island. Luckily, they landed on soft leaves and were unharmed, although Flossie was wet. Hungry and wet, Freddie sought to comfort Flossie by gathering food and finding shelter in an old cabin they stumbled upon."|"['1.

Flossie insisted that Mr. Blipper wasn't at the merry-go-round when they looked for him. The siblings rowed a leaky boat, not bothered by the water seeping in. Freddie skillfully turned the boat around, and they rowed back, wet from the rain. They shared some lunch from the balloon basket and headed to the shack. Freddie searched for matches while Flossie called out, spotting Mr. and Mrs. Bobbsey and their friends. Captain Craig assured them the boat wasn't sinking but was stuck on the rocks. The balloon man was confident they would find Flossie and Freddie on Hemlock Island. The search party waited in the rain as Captain Craig examined the boat, determining it needed fixing before they could leave the island.|['1.

"""There used to be campers' huts here,"" the captain explained. ""Maybe some left a rowboat. I could go to the mainland for help. Anyone can join me."" The deflated balloon lay draped over bushes and trees, its gas almost gone. It had carried Flossie and Freddie away from the fair. Meanwhile, Bert and Nan, back at Meadow Brook Farm, were worried. The storm raged, and they felt helpless. Uncle Daniel and Aunt Sarah chatted quietly. Suddenly, a knock interrupted. Bob entered, frustrated with Mr. Blipper's accusations. He sought Bert and Nan's help in identifying their father's handwriting on a letter. Bert recognized it from his father's office, sparking hope for news about Flossie and Freddie."|"['1.

Bob slowly explained that he found a letter in the tent where he and Mr. Blipper live while traveling to different fairgrounds with their merry-go-round. Bob revealed that Mr. Blipper claims he's his adopted son, but Bob doesn't view him as a good adopted father. Bob noticed the letter falling out of Mr. Blipper's coat, which was new after a breakdown at a Sunday school picnic. Bob overheard a quarrel between Mr. Blipper and his partner, Mr. Hardy, regarding business issues and mistreatment towards Bob. Bert shared that his parents planned to investigate if Bob was truly adopted by Mr. Blipper and threatened to have Mr. Blipper arrested for taking a coat.

The younger Bobbsey twins were finally persuaded to change into dry clothes and go to bed. They quickly fell asleep from their tiring adventure. Mr. Bobbsey discussed their island rescue, the repaired motorboat, and their safe return with Bob Guess. Mr. Bobbsey expressed suspicions about Blipper, calling him a thief. The next day, the storm passed, and they met with a policeman and a lawyer. Bob Guess revealed that Blipper had taken items that didn't belong to him.
