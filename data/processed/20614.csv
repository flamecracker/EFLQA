The group continued their journey without pause, with Red Angel suddenly veering to the right and refusing to return when called by George. Angel seemed to have sensed the direction the missing team had taken, indicated by the tracks. George was disappointed by the absence of the honey pot, knowing Angel's fondness for it. Suddenly, Angel began chattering excitedly and leaping between tree limbs, leading the boys on a chase. Eventually, they found the wagon with the yaks missing, the front wheel broken, and the tongue torn off. Despite the setback, they decided to camp in the wagon for the night and head home in the morning. The boys were attached to the yaks, which they had to replace after the loss. Upon returning home, they started preparing for the planting season, interrupted by their previous journey. They also resumed their exploration and hunting activities on the island, utilizing the metals they found for their workshop needs.|"['1.

When planting crops, it's crucial to consider if the soil is suitable. In the early days of the United States, settlers would venture far inland to find land, even though fertile soil was closer. This was because plants thrive in soil that meets their needs. Different plants grow in different soils - for instance, only a few out of thousands of flowering plants in central Europe grow in peaty soils. The soil affects the plant's growth, and over time, cultivated plants like carrots and cabbages have evolved from wild, unproductive varieties. The boys, Harry and the Professor, set out to retrieve a lifeboat left by the river. They found a yoke used by their yaks, indicating the animals were safe. After securing the lifeboat, they set off with oars in hand.|"['1.

The first tool made by primitive tribes was a bolo, a heavy blade duplicated for expeditions. They cut trees, made oars, and rowed down the stream. They rounded the point, reached the Cataract River, and utilized its water power. Finding a boat near the cataract, they aimed to explore the island. Harry planned to make weapons, focusing on firearms. George and the Professor trained a new team of yaks. They discussed the properties of metals like brass, which is harder and polishable. The boat discovery would impact their journey and help their companions. They prepared for possible encounters with island natives and the need for proper weapons.|"['1.

Metals are often combined to enhance their properties. For instance, coins are alloys of silver and gold with harder metals to prevent them from being too soft. Some metals like aluminum, zinc, and copper can be used alone, but others like arsenic and bismuth are too brittle. The ancient Celts used a bronze alloy of 12 parts tin and 88 parts copper. Manganese, when added to steel in small amounts, can increase its strength and toughness. The construction of hulls in ancient times involved shaping flat bottom boards and sloping sides due to limited bending capabilities. Stringers were used to support the structure, and the sides were overlaid with thin boards. This method created a sturdy and functional vessel.|['1.

In addition to the cross seats, similar arrangements for comfort were made along the sides. Beneath the side seats were spaces for supplies. The space forward of the mast had a roof sloping in both directions with provision for two berths. This setup provided protection and kept the area dry for comfort. The Professor explained that ships are designed to be easily maneuvered. The hull's shape affects its movement in water. A tapering rear end helps the ship to turn smoothly. The wider part near the stern reduces resistance. Red Angel, an orangutan, had amusing habits. He imitated the boys' singing and whistling during their concerts. His attempts at whistling were comical, bringing laughter to everyone. Despite his unique sounds, Angel was proud and eager to learn more tones. The Professor believed that the orangutan's imitation abilities could be further developed to learn simple words or sounds.|"['**1.

Animals can learn sounds through patience. Birds repeat notes with constant practice. Dogs can follow commands even if they can't speak. Nature expresses itself through movement, known as vibration. Sound, light, and other sensations are all results of vibration. Sounds have pitch, intensity, and character. Pitch depends on vibration speed, intensity on amplitude, and character on the source. The boys were busy with their boat and plowing but also had mysteries to solve on the island. They found a lifeboat, sparking curiosity. The Professor suggested preparing provisions and weapons before exploring. The boys were eager for adventure but agreed to finish the boat first.

After nine months of their lives, George and Harry, with their newfound insight, observed natural phenomena keenly. George pondered the absence of rainbows at midday, explaining that rainbows result from sunlight refracting through water droplets in the air. He illustrated how light vibrations create colors, akin to musical notes. The boys embarked on a mission to retrieve their wagon, left at the forest's edge since the yaks vanished. With a new team, they quickly repaired the wagon and replaced the broken wheel. The yaks, seemingly waiting, were found nearby. The boys made no conclusions about the situation but efficiently fixed the wagon and prepared to return home.|"['1.

The goal is to give the bullet a spinning motion as it flies through the air. Metals are not evenly dense all around, especially with molded bullets. This uneven weight distribution can cause the bullet to veer off course when fired, leading to inaccurate shots. The spiral spin helps counteract this issue. A cavity at the back of the bullet was created to make the lighter end at the rear, ensuring the bullet aligns with the grooves in the gun barrel for a stable trajectory. The molds used were made of a solid brass mix and had to be cast upright to prevent metal density variations from affecting the final product. The passage also touches on the exploration of a cave on an island, where characters are preparing a boat for the journey, weaving sails, and building anticipation for the adventure ahead.|['1.

Within the following week, the boat hull was nearly finished and required caulking. The hemp was broken up and cleaned to fill in the gaps between the planking. The mast was installed, and manilla rope was twisted for the sails. The sails were not yet ready, but progress was being made. George suggested that Angel, their helpful animal companion, should accompany them on test trips with the small boat before sailing. George enticed Angel into the boat with honey, and after initial hesitation, Angel joined them. As they sailed, Angel was startled by the waves but eventually enjoyed the rocking motion of the boat. They rescued a boat along the shore and Angel proved to be a good sailor, delighting in the journey. The sail lasted over three hours, and as they returned home, Angel frolicked in joy, creating lasting memories for all.|"['1.

The Professor and the boys were thrilled to discover their lost boat, now named No. 1, washed ashore after being lost at sea for three months. They marveled at the differences between how savages and civilized people use boats, noting the importance of a fulcrum in human advancement. The boat's notched gunwale suggested it had been used extensively. They debated whether to wait for settled weather or embark on an overland journey. To prepare for potential challenges, they practiced loading and firing weapons daily. The scene resembled a military camp, with guns, bullets, and powder meticulously arranged. Harry's innovative idea of storing powder in individual tubes and caps in bamboo holders streamlined the reloading process. The group eagerly anticipated uncovering more mysteries on Wonder Island.|['1.

During gun practice, Harry discovered a flaw in the cap removal process after each shot. To address this, he devised a solution by creating an opening in the stock and using a sliding piece with a finger to easily remove the cap. Testing the improved firearm, Harry found it took nearly 15 seconds to reload and fire. Not satisfied with this speed, he devised a plan to wrap powder in a paper tube attached to a reduced rear end of the bullet, eliminating the need for bamboo tubes. Harry then proposed making paper for this purpose. Moving to the marine works, the vessels were prepared with sails and Angel admired the sight. The Professor and George praised Harry's work, and a celebration ensued with cheers for the new ship. Angel's confusion at the celebration led to a humorous moment as he quickly descended the mast.|['1.

After the laughter subsided, George suggested three cheers for Angel. Everyone removed their hats and cheered. George's smile lit up his face, and he gestured like he had seen others do, marking progress in his learning. They all turned to the Professor, discussing how to transport a boat to explore a cave with cliffs. Preparations were made with lamps, boards for mapping, and weapons. The boat was secured in a wagon and taken to the cave entrance. Inside, they heard a mysterious beating sound near daylight. As they approached the noise, they readied their guns, ready to face whatever awaited them.|"['1.

"The region intrigued George and the Professor, but practical Harry suggested sailing along the coast instead of up the river. As they sailed south, the coast turned southwest towards the mountains. The wind shifted, making progress slow, and the temperature dropped. They turned north, facing a strong wind that caused concern. The wind intensified, leading to a split mainmast support. They sailed up the river, landing safely. The Professor examined a slab with cave tracings, revealing hidden characters. Harry recognized the slab from the pirate's cave.

All the stuff they gathered was more than expected when they left the Cataract, so not bringing the team was a big regret. However, in just an hour, they managed to get the team, and it was a pretty good load from the pirates' hideout to their home on the river. The ancient pistols were ineffective due to the low-quality powder and short barrels. But with modern advancements, powders burn instantly, improving efficiency. After returning, the interest in the items was high, and the disappearance of Angel was forgotten. When Angel returned dragging something heavy, it turned out to be a rusted gun barrel. The guns they found were too rusted to use, but the silver vessels were handy.

The Earth's magnetic poles are not exactly at its rotational poles but slightly off to the side. Despite this, the magnetic poles are close enough that a compass needle points towards what we call the north pole. All magnetized objects have two poles, one north and one south. For example, in a bar of iron, one end is north and the other is south. The flow of currents in magnets determines their behavior. When the currents flow in the same direction, the magnets attract each other, but when they flow in opposite directions, the magnets repel. By understanding these principles, we can create temporary magnets by passing electricity through a wire wrapped around a bar. This process enables us to pick up pieces of iron or steel using the magnet.|"['1.

After three days of preparation, the crew set sail with Angel by their side and a new flag waving in the breeze. The little craft glided down the waters of Cataract under a bright sun, heading towards an uncertain future. With the wind gently blowing from the north, they steered westward, passing a cape that jutted out into the sea. As night approached, a mist obscured their view, making it hard to gauge how far they had traveled. The boys tried to estimate their progress, considering the wind's impact on their speed. The Professor explained how the wind's direction affected the sail's efficiency, using diagrams to illustrate the concept. By setting the sail at an angle, they could harness the wind's power more effectively.|"[""1.

In sailing, understanding the pressure of wind on a sail is crucial. Imagine a sail is 10 feet square, and the wind blows at 20 miles per hour against it. By squaring the wind speed (20 x 20 = 400), we find the pressure per square foot of the sail to be 2 pounds. With a sail area of 100 square feet, the total pressure on the sail is 200 pounds. Each angle of incidence has a coefficient, with 45 degrees having a value of .666. Multiplying this by the pressure gives a total of 133.2 pounds. The importance of time and speed at sea cannot be overstated. Accurate timekeeping and estimating speed are essential skills for sailors. Observing passing water can help determine speed. The ability to chart mentally and possess a sense of direction are invaluable traits for sailors. Reflecting on past challenges can highlight growth and achievements, showing the progress made over time.|['1.

The boys, now working like men, impressed the Professor with their growth in strength and courage. He looked upon them with admiration and love, finding joy in their progress. As they charted the coast using a compass, the Professor explained the cardinal points: north, south, east, and west, as well as the intermediate divisions like northeast and southwest. By aligning the compass with the charting board, they ensured their boat's direction. The boys learned about shipboard time, divided into watches of four hours each, with dog-watches from 4 to 8 P.M. to rotate duties. This system allowed each to have three hours of uninterrupted sleep, fostering teamwork and efficiency.|"['1.

During the night, the wind changed direction to the north, making progress slow and requiring many turns. When the Professor took over, the ship was still heading north. Harry reported the wind had been steady during his watch. Soon, the western shore disappeared, and they sailed NWW until mid-morning. Then, they tacked WbS. The winds were tricky the next day. After a calm, the wind shifted west, forcing them to sail close to the wind when they turned SSW. They made slow progress. On the third day, they faced headwinds, tacking frequently. No signs of people were seen. However, the boys spotted lights to the south at night, raising hopes they were nearing an island. The next morning, they sailed SWbW, staying close to the shore. As the wind grew stronger from the southwest, they struggled to make headway. Lights were seen as they neared human habitation, but the wind forced them to turn north for safety.|['1.

The boys were in a dire situation as leaks sprung from all sides of the boat. Harry, feeling despair, worked tirelessly to plug the leaks with oakum and caulking. The Professor, rejuvenated after a brief rest, took control of the helm once more. With nearly a foot of water in the boat, they needed to reach the shore on the lee side of the land. The Professor, though exhausted, asked the boys to raise the mainsail. As they approached the shore, the boat was hit by a giant wave, causing significant damage.

After the meal, a detailed inspection was done on the boat. The entire left side, from the front to a third of the way back from the middle bulge, was completely shattered. Sand had filled the inside due to the impact. Repairing it without proper wood and tools seemed impossible. They sat down, not in despair, to make a wise decision. The Professor shared his thoughts, suggesting they couldn't predict the river's course as they passed it at night. They decided to head towards West River, about 75 miles away, preparing for a journey on foot. They secured provisions, moved the boat inland, stored supplies, and covered them carefully. They sadly left behind bedding but took ramie items for cover. They aimed to cover ten miles before night, facing rough terrain.

When Angel rejoined the boys, their fear vanished, and the creatures in the trees watched calmly as the boys passed by. The animal's presence deeply impacted everyone. George, who had educated the creature, felt a strong bond with him. The next day, as they journeyed home, they passed familiar landmarks, like the Cataract River and a clearing where they had encountered bears. Seeing the flag atop Observation Hill filled them with joy. As they neared home, Angel sensed danger and led them to investigate. They found no disturbances, but Angel's warning proved valuable. The boys, Angel, and the Professor returned home safely, grateful for their shared adventure.|"[""1.

The group cautiously approached the house. Harry quietly opened the door with a secret bolt. Inside, they found an empty room. A trap-door was opened, giving a view of the shop and cattle-yard. With guns ready, they filed out towards a man in the distance. The man seemed startled at first but then relaxed. The Professor extended his hand, but the man showed no fear or recognition. The Professor spoke, and the man, about fifty years old, seemed curious but said nothing. They noticed his torn clothes, with a shirt that had George's initials. The mystery of the missing shirt was solved. The man ate voraciously when given food, showing a faint smile afterward. He was given new clothes and a chair to rest in.|"['1.

He dressed himself automatically and was left alone for a while. Harry sneaked to the port and observed the stranger, who remained unfazed. Spotting a knife, the stranger tried to hide it under his shirt, possibly out of instinct for self-defense. The observers noted that the man seemed to suffer memory loss, a condition not fully understood by medical experts. They discussed how even in a state of mental confusion, nature provides beings with an instinct for survival. The boys thoroughly searched the area and found evidence of the man's stay. It was apparent that his time on the island had affected his mental state. Despite attempts to communicate with him in different languages, the man remained unresponsive. The man followed George on a walk, causing a brief moment of unease, but the group continued their activities undeterred.|"['1.

They climbed the steep hill instead of taking the easier route, and when they reached the top, the stranger finally showed interest. He gazed at the flag, then out to sea, shielding his eyes from the sun. On the way back, George shared the encounter with the Professor, who noted the man's familiarity with the sea. The group pondered their next move: by sea in a damaged boat or by land? The decision leaned towards land exploration. The stranger, previously uninterested, found fascination in the workshop's machinery and the electric battery. The Professor thought giving him tasks might spark memories. When handed tools, the stranger skillfully planed a board and handled a saw. They named him John and planned to include him in their future endeavors on the island.|"[""1.

When Harry arrived at the shop where he worked, he mistakenly called a man John, causing the man to react with surprise. Harry noticed this and informed the Professor. The Professor, intrigued, went to investigate. The man seemed to recognize the name John but couldn't recall why. The boys, including John, prepared a bed for a newcomer, and John enthusiastically helped. When taken to the boathouse, John's eyes lit up at the sight of the boats but then dimmed again. The next day, he showed familiarity with milking cows. Later, at the laboratory, he examined a skull with a fractured side, displaying a keen interest in the injury. The Professor tried to jog his memory without success. The group needed to restock on food, especially butter, prompting plans for a cream separator to simplify butter production.|"[""1.

The machine works like this: Milk is poured into tube D and spun quickly. It flows down into ducts (H, H), then into horizontal tubes (F, F) where the cream is kept from reaching the outer tube I by the heavier milk. Only milk goes through the inner tube and out through duct (J), while cream exits through small tubes (K). In the colony, the search for vegetables became a daily task since the garden wasn't producing yet. John went missing one morning but returned before noon with a load of vegetables. Harry was thrilled to see beets, which John had found. The Professor praised John, recognizing his efforts. John's intelligence shone when he went on a trip with the yaks to the forest, showing signs of recovery by collecting samples but forgetting them due to his condition. The hope was to restore him to normalcy. Guns were taken for hunting, and the boys had success bagging pheasants and squirrels while the Professor and John prospected.|"['1.

When the Professor came back to the wagon with loads of samples, George wanted to explore further into the forest towards the South River falls. Soon, they found the trail left by yaks fleeing months earlier. Not far from the falls, Angel, their companion, sensed danger and the yaks grew restless. Harry investigated and found a large bear near a fallen tree. The Professor grabbed a gun, but John instinctively took a spear and approached the bear. The bear, focused on the honey, ignored the group. John bravely faced the bear with his spear, injuring it. The Professor warned against shooting to avoid hitting John. Eventually, John's bravery subdued the bear, earning him respect from the group. They worked together to skin the bear, and John's courage won him admiration from the team.|"['1.

The group's excitement over the battle made them forget about the honey tree until Angel reminded them. He had found his way there after the battle and was joyfully indulging in the sweet treat. With no way to carry the honey home, they remembered their previous attempt and successfully transported it back to the hive. A celebratory lunch was prepared, and they enjoyed the sugar-free meal. As they made their way back along the trail the runaway yaks had taken, they reached the river. John stood gazing at the falls, hinting at a memory he couldn't quite grasp. The group pondered the mysteries surrounding John's memory loss and the peculiar rope they found. George reflected on the eternal quest for knowledge that drives humanity, emphasizing that the pursuit of the unknown is what gives life its richness and purpose.|"[""1.

Upon returning home, the Professor and John carefully took the samples they had collected to the laboratory. Angel particularly enjoyed the cleaning of the copper receptacles for the honey. Initially shy around John, Angel gradually grew comfortable with his presence. Despite the mystery surrounding John, the trio felt a strong connection to the island and a curiosity about what lay on the other side. Plans were made for an overland journey, as retrieving the wrecked boat near West River would be challenging due to the ongoing monsoons. The boys were fixated on the cave, discussing it constantly. One day, George proposed exploring it further. Armed with lamps and weapons, they ventured into the chamber to the east, discovering a luxurious room filled with gold and silver vessels, now covered in a shroud of decay. Silently exploring the chamber, they marveled at its grandeur despite its ruinous state.|"['1.

In history, great floods and volcanic eruptions have wiped out civilizations, like Atlantis, leading to the reemergence of life and the need to rediscover arts and sciences. The impact of sunlight on health is remarkable. The Professor emphasized its benefits, from aiding chemical reactions to enhancing muscle function and skin health. Sunlight's unseen rays have curative effects, like combating diseases and purifying tissues. Creatures like eyeless microbes and butterflies thrive in sunlight, showcasing its vital role in life. The US Government's initiative to flood the new post-office building in Washington with sunlight sets a positive example.

Below the Cataract, near the river's mouth, lay a small cove with deep water and a sandy shore where the group stopped to fish. The Professor used a fly to fish at the water's surface and caught a large specimen first. Salmon have a habit of staying in saltwater during winter, then moving to rivers to spawn. The eggs are laid in rivers, but many are destroyed by enemies. Harry caught a 15-inch fish with a cylindrical body and a striking color pattern. George and John also enjoyed fishing. They were working on a violin, but forgot about the strings. The best strings are made from sheep intestines and are used in various products. These strings are also used in internal surgery because they are absorbed by the body over time.|"[""1.

"The items were thoroughly cleaned as they would be used for specific purposes, although the exact purpose was unknown at that time. They needed to be soaked and stripped of their inner and outer linings. Potash solution was recommended for this task. After that, they had to be drawn through small holes for consistency and stored in a container filled with sulfur fumes to fumigate them. Once prepared, they were ready for use.

The group was preparing for a journey, gathering supplies and making synthetic foods to lighten their load. They worked on creating white lead by fermenting metallic lead with vinegar and tannin bark. George suggested making synthetic foods to reduce the burden of carrying provisions. The Professor, already working on this, asked for tubes and bamboo to make the food. Guns and ammunition were readied, food prepared, and barley bread baked. They packed the wagon with supplies, including sugar, honey, and some vegetables. They set out the next day, leaving a message on Observation Hill.

John observed the preparations keenly and was among the first to stand by the wagon. When the Professor suggested he sit, John hesitated at first but eventually complied after a few hours of walking. At noon, they stopped by the Cataract before turning southwest towards the South River. The journey became more challenging as they encountered rough terrain and dense forests. They decided to head west with a slight northward trend away from the river. The night in the forest was disrupted by strange sounds, and a wildcat attacked one of the yaks. John swiftly fired his gun, saving the yak from harm. The tense situation was diffused, and the group settled back in for the night, surrounded by the eerie sounds of the forest.|['1.

One night, John and the boys had an exciting adventure in the forest. A crash made them pause, unable to see beyond the thick trees. The boys eager to return caused the lamp to fall and extinguish. The yaks were frenzied, howling intensified. After relighting the lamp, the beasts retreated. Jack had a laceration, but no major damage.

"Jack's injured shoulder was not as severe as expected. By noon, the pain had lessened, allowing them to save time by following the marked path. This decision brought them together much earlier than Harry had predicted. George's patience in teaching Angel was admirable. Hours were spent on this task, and even before leaving home, the animal could understand commands like ""come"" and ""go."" Tests were conducted to determine if Angel's actions were based on understanding or repetition. The group camped for the night, hoping for an easier path the next day. They found a recent campfire, indicating recent activity in the area. Traveling cautiously due to the dense underbrush, they considered climbing trees for a better view.

Harry spent over an hour mastering the art of maneuvering a hoop to ascend. Carefully, he climbed thirty feet to the first branch, pausing to admire the expanding view and catch his breath. After a brief lunch break, the group headed west towards the river. Jack, exhausted from the day's journey, stopped after just five miles.
