"Betty was ready to comply when a clever idea struck her. Her pepper gun! She had purchased it the day prior from her father's chauffeur's son, deeming it unsuitable for a nine-year-old boy and had stored it in her car as the most accessible spot. The pepper gun was loaded with good red cayenne pepper, just as it should be! A few miles later, Betty slowed down her car to wait for Mollie and the rest to catch up. Grace, still recovering from the scare, had not yet mustered the courage to ask questions. Betty, with a mix of laughter and tears, shared, ""He would have regretted it if I hadn't acted first. It was risky, but I wasn't going to let him take our money without a fight.""

""Arnold Dempsey's message, written to his dad when he thought he might never see him again, doesn't belong to us,"" he said firmly.

The boys stayed at the lodge for a few days, and the Outdoor Girls, except for Betty, were very happy. However, Betty couldn't shake off a feeling of being left out because her friends had their boys back while she didn't. Despite the attention from the boys, especially Allen, who used to compete for her favor, Betty missed having Allen around. The girls were sad to say goodbye to the boys, even though it was only for a short while. They enjoyed their time together, engaging in various activities like swimming, fishing, and hiking. As they watched the boys leave, they felt a sense of longing. Grace suggested a moonlight swim, and the girls had fun racing in the swimming pool.

The journey back across the river was eerie and surreal for the girls, akin to a haunting nightmare. Their peculiar passenger, appearing the most surreal of all, was mostly quiet. However, at times he would startle and glance around frantically, only calming down when Betty reassured him about his sons, Jimmy and Arnold. Betty urgently pleaded not to ask questions but to assist them, promising to explain later. They introduced the broken old man as Professor Dempsey to Mrs. Irving, who was too stunned to comprehend fully. They settled him in Betty's room, where he swiftly fell into a deep slumber. Despite their exhaustion, the girls took turns watching over him through the night in case his madness resurfaced. The morning revealed a weary group of Outdoor Girls. Betty, exhausted yet concerned, inquired about the patient, who woke up with a familiar polite tone but no memory of recent events. He connected his distress to the news of his sons' passing, expressing relief upon learning they were safe and well.|"['1.
