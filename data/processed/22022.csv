The delightful journey down the Ranee River from Dinan to St. Malo was a pleasant memory for Lavinia and Amanda. They enjoyed a cozy breakfast at the charming Hôtel Franklin courtyard and explored the old town, admiring churches and resisting the allure of antique jewelry shops. Lavinia regretted not buying a special watch, while Amanda longed for a Breton collar and cross. Matilda, an aspiring art student, planned to sketch the cathedrals they encountered. Amidst the hustle of the town, Amanda cautioned against engaging with strangers. The group encountered typical Continental tourists, but Matilda innocently interacted with the surroundings, attracting the attention of curious Americans. As they embarked on a carefree journey to Le Mans, laughter filled the air, and even the Raven joined in, shedding her worries.

Florence was a place filled with treasures, but not all were appreciated by the writer. They found Italy to be overrated but enjoyed some art pieces, particularly those by Titian and the busts of Roman emperors.

Livy was disappointed not to enter Rome in daylight to exclaim, 'Roma! Roma! the eternal city, bursts upon my view!' The next morning, her sister excitedly looked out the window, eager to see the Spanish Steps and other landmarks. A soldier caught her attention, posing for her with his uniform. Suddenly, Agrippina, the maid, rushed in, warning of a flood from the Tiber River. The friends, leaving their cozy breakfast, found the city submerged. The Piazza del Popolo had turned into a lake, and boats filled the streets. People were stranded on balconies, and breakfast deliveries were halted.

During a severe flood in Rome, the soldiers worked tirelessly to rescue people and provide food. The priests who usually helped stood by, blaming the disaster on the people's treatment of the Pope.

A great commotion stirred among the officials, with splendid figures in fresh uniforms darting in every direction. Carriages brought esteemed guests to welcome their lord, General Marmora, a thin, energetic man, was bustling everywhere, as the new order encountered some hitches. Dorias and Colonnas delighted the commoners, who cheered from the Commander-in-Chief to a servant carrying breakfast.

Sister Matilda and Lavinia shared their true feelings in the quiet of the Campagna, away from the superficiality of social gatherings. Matilda admitted that genius was scarce in the art studios, while Lavinia found parties lacking in intellectual stimulation. Their critiques of art and social events were harsh but honest. Amanda suffered silently through it all. When Lavinia suggested escaping to the mountains to avoid further moral decay, Matilda and Amanda eagerly agreed. Despite the rustic setting of Albano, the women found solace in the simplicity of nature and the absence of pretentious gatherings. A chance encounter with a charming young gentleman led them to explore a villa for rent, which turned out to have ties to the Buonaparte family.

After the initial excitement faded, Lavinia rejected the idea of boarding with a greedy noble who relied on his ancestors and charged for everything. She decided to only look at the place but not enter or owe anything to the resident. The group led the griffin through the town, passing the villa's less appealing side. They saw two Napoleonic heads at the window and Lavinia's father in the garden. Amanda, in a car with a charming officer and a quiet young man, engaged in conversation. They shared a joke about a Baron Rothschild and his plain wife. However, the meek man turned out to be the Baron's secretary. In Rome, the officer joined Amanda, expressing his joy at her presence and offering his horses for rides. Amanda cautiously accepted, wanting to introduce him to her American acquaintances first.

The servant dashed away, but the master stayed to protect the Signorina as no trains were due for hours, and it was unsafe for a lady to be alone. Amanda agreed, curious about her adventure.
