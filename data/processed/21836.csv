Jasper noticed that Noisy Jake hadn't seen the owl, but he decided not to correct him. Jasper thought it might be best to let Jake believe he was still leading the party, as his loud voice would surely catch the owl's attention.

Jasper Jay was a loud and rowdy bird who caused a commotion at the Singing Society meeting. Despite his antics, the group found his behavior amusing and had a great time. Jasper's sulky attitude lingered for days, but he eventually stopped bothering Buddy Brown-Thrasher. Another bird, Reddy Woodpecker, also loved beechnuts and planned to stay in Pleasant Valley for the winter. Both Jasper and Reddy were colorful and mischievous birds known for stealing eggs and young birds. When Jasper learned about Reddy's plans to stay, he was furious and sought help from Jimmy Rabbit to keep Reddy away from the beechnuts. Jasper was not keen on facing Reddy's strong bill and welcomed Jimmy's assistance in dealing with the situation.|"['1.

Jimmy Rabbit led Jasper Jay through the woods, guiding him to a swampy hollow where water pooled. Jasper Jay grumbled about standing in a cold puddle. Jimmy Rabbit instructed him to stay absolutely still to avoid a fight with Reddy Woodpecker. Satisfied with his plan, Jimmy hopped away. Meanwhile, he found Reddy Woodpecker eating beechnuts and overheard Reddy complaining about Jasper Jay's greed and vanity. Reddy admitted he couldn't stop eating beechnuts, comparing it to Johnnie Green's love for peanuts. This winter, Reddy would feast only on beechnuts until the last one was gone.|"['1.

"""Do exactly as I tell you,"" he ordered. ""And don't even whisper to me, please! I'm going to show you where you must stand. Though the place may not be as dry as you might prefer, you'll have to follow my directions and say nothing--if you want to get rid of Jasper Jay.""

Jimmy Rabbit waited while Reddy hunted in all his pockets. He turned every one of them inside out. And since he had fifteen pockets, and he had to turn them all back again, and replace their contents, the proceeding consumed a good deal of time.

So the red-capped scamp managed to keep quiet, though it was such hard work that he began to feel terribly hungry. Jimmy Rabbit watched him for a short time, smiling and nodding his head, as if to say:

Though Reddy did not know it, Jimmy Rabbit stopped as soon as he was out of sight and crept behind a bush, from which hiding-place he could watch the cedar tree, without being seen by the two beechnut lovers who stood so still beside it--for there was Jasper Jay, standing in a puddle on one side of the big tree, and there was Reddy Woodpecker, standing in another puddle on the opposite side of the tree!
