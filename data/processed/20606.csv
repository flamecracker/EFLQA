The nurse, caught up in the excitement, allowed Philip to take the toys. He hurriedly gathered bricks, blocks, chessmen, and more to create a grand temple in the drawing-room.

The two towns were linked by a bridge made from a yard-stick Philip had taken from the servants' sewing-room. All the servants were his friends, especially Susan, who was the first. As Philip admired his creation with Mr. and Mrs. Noah as the townspeople, the nurse appeared unexpectedly. She shook Philip and scolded him for being untruthful, hitting his knuckles with the yard-stick. Philip was pale but didn't cry. Later, Susan found him asleep with wet eyelashes. Philip was upset about Helen leaving and the nurse's behavior, fearing the city would be destroyed before Helen saw it.

Philip found himself standing on a vast plain, surrounded by darkness. In the distance, he spotted a steep bridge leading to a mysterious height illuminated by the moon. As he approached, he realized it was more like a ladder, stretching up into the dark sky. With no rungs, only narrow ledges, it resembled something out of a fairy tale. Despite his fatigue, Philip decided to climb the ladder, which had a daunting 308 steps on one side. Exhausted but determined, he finally reached a terrace at the top. Resting on the cold ground, he caught his breath. Surrounded by silence, he discovered an archway leading to a deserted square with a fountain shimmering in the moonlight.

"Philip felt a sudden wave of sleepiness wash over him. Leaning against the wall, he soon found sitting down more inviting, and lying down even more so. A distant bell chimed twelve, but as he drifted off, he missed the final bell tolls, nestled comfortably in a quilted dressing-gown made by Helen. In his dream, life was back to normal before the arrival of ""That Man"" who took Helen away. But abruptly, he awoke on the cold floor of a grand gate-house, not in his cozy bed at home. Startled by a man in a red coat, Philip found himself surrounded by soldiers. Curious yet polite, he inquired about his predicament, only to learn of a prophecy about a trespasser causing trouble. The captain, taken aback by Philip's innocence, explained their duty as guards to prevent any trespassers from entering the Magic town."|"['1.

Every evening when the bright stars twinkle, the guards gather for a drink at the stroke of two. But on starless nights like tonight, they prefer to have their drinks brought to them. A soldier, following a prophecy, opens the door, expecting drinks to be served. However, to everyone's surprise, a dozen greyhounds enter, each carrying a coconut around its neck. The soldiers pierce the coconuts with their bayonets, filling pewter pots with delicious coconut milk for everyone. The captain explains that the coconuts will be used to make coconut ice for the army breakfast to avoid wasting anything. Just as things seem settled, Lucy, a familiar face, enters the room, much to Philip's dismay.

In the quiet room, Philip felt uneasy as the soldiers stared at him. He blamed Lucy for intruding where she shouldn't have. Frowning, he watched as the captain comforted Lucy, making her a makeshift bed. Despite having his own cloak and bench, Philip was upset with the disruption. The next morning, the soldiers enjoyed an odd breakfast, which Philip found unsuitable. As they marched to the Hall of Justice, Philip observed the diverse crowd in various colorful attire. Feeling out of place in his own clothing, he noticed the uniqueness of each nationality's dress. Walking alongside Lucy, he tried to hide his fear by pretending to be brave, even though he felt uncomfortable in the unfamiliar setting.|"[""1.

Philip hesitated, withdrawing his hand and uttering a quick 'No' before recalling his decision to remain silent. Despite his denial, the sight of the building triggered a vague memory within him. As two attendants laid out a thick yellow mat before the judge, Philip observed the solemn proceedings. The trial concluded swiftly, with minimal words from the captain and judge, while the prisoners were not given a chance to speak. Sentenced to death or life imprisonment based on the judge's whim, Philip and Lucy were escorted up a dark, winding staircase to a sparsely furnished room.

"Philip observed the nurse's flat feet and the lower part of her grey skirt as she worked on the table above, destroying his city as promised. He noticed a black column, part of the table, and heard the nurse's movements as she tidied up. In a dream, he found himself at home with Helen waking him up to meet a clever white pony. The dream ended abruptly as he awoke to an empty room flooded with sunlight. Philip indulged in the bath, relishing the hot and cold water, various soaps, brushes, and sponges.

A boat with a thousand spears stood on its deck, racing fiercely towards another boat with an ivory mast and woollen sail. The two boats collided and sank, creating a stupendous wreck. Under the waves, a sea mouse escaped until caught and caged by the narrator. As the narrator lay in the sea, a voice called him back to reality, ending his giant adventures. Reluctantly, he left his magical ships behind and returned to dry land. In his hurry, he forgot to properly fasten his bootlaces and dropped his collar-stud, prompting him to remember his dream. He searched the entire empty house, from the nursery to the servants' quarters, finding no one. Fearing something terrible had happened, he pondered if it was magic or a kidnapping.|"[""1.

The stable-yard was tranquil, with only the soft sounds of the surroundings breaking the quiet.

Philip hurriedly left the room and entered the elegant drawing-room. He carefully arranged the ivory chess pieces on the exquisite chess table with mother-of-pearl and ivory squares. Trying to distract himself, he attempted to play a game against himself, but the white pieces, moving first, always won. Frustrated, he abandoned the game and stored the chessmen back in their cabinet. He then turned to a book of photographs, but found no interest. Next, he attempted to play with ivory spellicans, but his shaking hands hindered him. Despite his efforts to avoid it, memories of a dream flooded back. He recalled a promise to a friend and a moment of cowardice. Overwhelmed with guilt, he looked out the window, only to have his boot nudge a hidden object.

Philip was puzzled when a wooden figure suddenly came to life and picked up a yellow disc. The figure rolled it up and started walking towards Philip. Startled, Philip heard a loud voice from a curly object he found. Although confused, he knew Helen would return after receiving a telegram, and he must find the lost Lucy before her arrival. Determined to act like a hero, Philip quickly built a structure using a chess table and other items. However, he realized he couldn't enter the building he had made.

The nurse scolded the child for playing with building blocks again. She threatened to teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget. The child, Philip, felt determined as he walked through a domino path into a vast, dark archway. He felt small and weak, but determined. He passed through arches made of silver candlesticks and a book, entering a hall of towering silver pillars. As he walked, the pillars seemed endless, and he grew tired.

Philip found himself in a vast field, reminiscent of an endless prairie, adorned with patches of vibrant flowers. As he walked along a path, he pondered the idea of abandoning his belief in magic to return to his normal size and bring Lucy back. However, a voice in his head reminded him that Lucy's belief in magic might keep the enchantment alive for her. Despite his doubts, Philip pressed on through a hall of silver pillars until he reached a small door leading to a bright blue light of day. Stepping through, he emerged into the quiet expanse of the field. Despite expecting hunger after walking for hours, he felt oddly satiated. The solitude of the open country weighed heavily on him, with only the sound of his boots on the path breaking the silence.

Philip was caught off guard by the dragon's sudden awakening. As it lunged towards the Princess, Philip's instincts kicked in, propelling him down the tower stairs with lightning speed. Gripping his sword tightly, he raced towards the Princess, engaged in a frantic race against the dragon. With his heart pounding and his feet heavy, Philip closed in on the beast. Taking a deep breath, he lunged forward, striking the dragon with all his might. The impact knocked him down, and he blacked out momentarily. Upon regaining consciousness, Philip found himself surrounded by cheering onlookers. The dragon lay lifeless beside him. In a desperate attempt to rid himself of the princess, Philip unveiled her face, revealing a beautiful maiden standing before him. The scene unfolded on a vast grassy plain adorned with vibrant flowers, reminiscent of Philip's childhood carpet. Amidst the silence that followed, Philip's frustration simmered, leaving everyone at a loss for words.|"[""1.

Philip marveled at the grandeur of the City of Polistopolis as Mr. Noah welcomed him and Lucy. They were led into a lavish dressing-room filled with an array of colorful clothes and accessories. Philip chose a soft shirt of chain-mail for the banquet, only to be interrupted by the Master of the Robes, Double-six, who helped him dress in a white tunic and coat of mail. Double-six, with a unique attire of dominoes, prided himself on being the Master of the Robes and an expert in dressing distinguished individuals.

The grand banquet was set on three tables, arranged in a vast room. Mr. Noah sat at the center of the high table, with Lucy and Philip beside him. The table displayed an array of delectable foods on pink-and-white painted wooden plates from Lucy's old dolls' house. When a dish of jelly was offered, Philip eagerly reached for it, only to discover it was hard and inedible. Mr. Noah whispered to pretend, revealing the banquet was make-believe. As more dishes were served, Philip realized they were all glued to the plates, including a fat goose.

The feast presented to Philip and Lucy consisted of wooden foods on dishes. Despite the variety of dishes, including a turkey, raspberry jam tarts, a pineapple, a melon, oysters, bacon, and mutton, all the items were inedible due to being wooden. Pretending to enjoy the feast, the hungry children sipped from goblets filled with a liquid resembling wine. Thirsty and hungry, they awaited the end of the banquet, where they were relieved to be served bread and milk in a cozy room. After the meal, Mr. Noah informed them that to leave the place again, they must perform seven noble deeds.

Lucy shared her fantastical adventure with Philip, where she was mistaken for a Princess by soldiers and taken to the palace. Philip, feeling guilty for leaving Lucy alone, didn't share her joy. Lucy found wonder in the unexpected, like fairy tales and dreams coming true. Mr. Noah assigned Philip a task, acknowledging that not all deeds need to be heroic. He mentioned the fruit supply and the Dwellers by the sea as important tasks. The clocks in their world ticked differently during Philip's absence, but reset when he rescued Lucy from the dragon. Mr. Noah assured Philip that he had time to complete the task and could seek help if needed, with a three-month timeframe before the Pretenderette's chance would come.|"['1.

The tall Dutchman reassured Philip, telling him not to worry about the incident. They would take the woman bothering people to the hall of justice. Her punishment would be imprisonment until the offended party decided otherwise. Lucy eagerly agreed to help Philip with the task of unraveling a crochet mat made of red wool that was causing trouble. With the assistance of twelve bluejackets and a capstan, the carpet was quickly unraveled to the amazement of the crowd. Mr. Noah, impressed by Philip's success, decided to make him a baronet as a reward.

Public entertainment was too challenging a rhyme for our skilled astrologers. Lady Lucy's costume choice was inspired. Mr. Noah believed banquets distracted from serious matters.

Lucy asked if they should be afraid too. Philip confirmed that she did intend to come but wasn't expected if she was scared, as girls weren't expected to be brave. Mr. Noah, eager for the expedition, asked what they wanted to ride on for the long journey to the Dwellers by the Sea. He was relieved they didn't ask for a bicycle due to a law requiring machinery use. They headed to the stables, which were like the ones for toy horses, but filled with various animals for riding, including elephants, camels, and even a Hippogriff.

Mr. Noah had a unique group for his expedition: one camel, two dogs, two children, and a talking parrot. Despite the tradition of having two of everything, Mr. Noah insisted that one camel was enough for Sir Philip to handle. The children, Philip and Lucy, packed their belongings atop the camel, led by a lively procession out of the city. As they journeyed through flowery meadows and past the Stonehenge ruins, they were headed towards the vast and mysterious Absolutely Unknown. The sun shone brightly, and the camel's proud melancholy was briefly lifted as they traveled. Lucy marveled at riding a camel while the parrot recited poetry. At an oasis in the desert, they camped for the night, enjoying cocoa and a peaceful sleep.

Philip quickly gathered dead palm scales and leaves to revive the dying fire. As the flames roared back to life, a mysterious movement caught his attention beyond the bushes. He pondered if the shining pairs of objects in the darkness resembled the eyes of lions. Meanwhile, Lucy, near the fire, contemplated the situation, likening it to a dragon. The parrot nodded in agreement, and a hush fell over the group. Suddenly, Lucy leaped up. The expedition, faces lit by the fire, awaited the dawn, observing the strange glints and rustlings in the shadows. Brenda abandoned her tree-climbing plan and huddled close to Lucy. The camel, trembling with fear, sought solace with Philip. Eventually, they all prepared to confront the lions, securing ropes around the trees to subdue the sleeping beasts. Lucy devised a plan involving the dogs to disarm the lions, and the group worked diligently to remove the paint from the wooden lion figures. After a hearty breakfast, the expedition successfully dismantled the lions, revealing them to be mere wood.|"['1.

When they reached the courtyard of the castle, they discovered a bustling scene with a variety of animals, similar to those found in a zoo or a Noah's ark toy set. Each animal had a rider, and together they rode out onto the beach. Among the animals were ones without names, like the graibeeste, a creature with rabbit ears, a fox-like size, and a tail in an unusual position. The parrot explained that these were the graibeestes, created by toymakers who grew tired of painting realistic animals and started making them in whimsical colors. The hunt began, with dogs barking, riders shouting, and the blugraiwee leading the way. After a thrilling chase, they returned with a pinkugger and graibeestes for their meal. The Lord High Islander shared a tale about their island's unique way of life, where they lived as carefree children, hunting and cooking for themselves with the help of the M.A.'s, who enjoyed teaching them.|"['1.

"The game was skinned and cut up in the courtyard, and the intentions of the Lord High Islander had certainly been carried out. For the blugraiwee was plum-cake, and the other animals just what was needed. After dinner, the Lord High Islander took Lucy and Philip up to the top of the highest tower. They lay in the sun eating toffee and gazing out over the sea at the faint distant blue of the island. ""Because we couldn't live away from the sea. We're islanders, you know; we couldn't bear not to be near the sea,"" explained the Lord High Islander. ""That's why it's one of your deeds to take away our fear.""

A young blugraiwee cautiously peeked out of its hole after a restless night, checking if humans were awake or if it could search for yellow periwinkles, its favorite food. Spotting no one on the deserted beach, it boldly walked out, leaving the safety of the rocks. The sea had risen, washing away the castle, huts, and inhabitants. Lucy, awakened by the castle alarm, saw a bustling courtyard below. Quickly dressing in better clothes than seaweed, she prepared to seek refuge in the ark.

Lucy and Mr. Noah watched a procession of animals being herded up a long road to the ark tower. Below, M.A.'s were busy with seaweed bales. From above, the scene resembled ants scurrying about.

Once inside the ark, the animals were comfortably settled in stalls, unlike a typical Noah's ark. The interior resembled a luxurious liner, complete with cabins. The group gathered in a grand saloon with walls adorned with mother-of-pearl and pink coral. The room was illuminated by phosphorus-filled glass globes invented by one of the M.A.'s.|"['1.

Mr. Noah reassured everyone that safety was certain as the waters would either recede or the ark would float.

Billy mentioned that anyone could steer the ark, and Lucy volunteered. With Mr. Noah's guidance, Lucy effortlessly steered the ark into the harbor. Arks are unique vessels that move without sails, engines, or oars. Steering an ark is simple; the steersman only needs to give directions like 'Port,' 'Starboard,' 'Right ahead,' and 'Slow,' and the ark obediently follows. As Lucy guided the ark towards a town's domes and pinnacles, the town's people cheered upon their arrival. Mr. Noah announced the arrangements for the islanders, M.A.'s, and animals to camp in the public park while consulting the oracle.

Philip peeked through the bushes nearby and overheard a mysterious word that made him tremble. It was the first time he laid eyes on the Pretenderette, Lucy's nurse, who had been unkind to him. Wondering how she ended up there, Philip felt uneasy and hoped to avoid her. As the Hippogriff flew away, leaving Philip alone on the island, he found solace in the beauty around him. The island was a paradise with various fruits and flowers growing together. Philip explored the orchards and discovered a frozen lake, reminiscing about tales of a magical island.

Mr. Noah explained that the Somnolentians' main industry is gathering pineapples, which they consider a vegetable, not a fruit. They spend their time singing songs in honor of the Great Sloth, who influences them to sleep most of the time. Philip's task is to keep the Great Sloth awake and busy. With the parrot's guidance, Philip and Lucy set sail on a yacht towards a river. The parrot hinted at a magic word that could help understand animal talk. They were warmly welcomed by Max and Brenda.

"""I'm sure nobody would dream of whining,"" said Brenda. ""I know I'm too sensitive; but you can do anything with dear little dogs by kindness. And as for whining--do you know it's a thing I've never been subject to, from a child, never. Max will tell you the same."" 

""Hullo!"" cried more than one voice, and the ship shot out of the dark cavern into a sheet of water that lay spread under a white dome. The stream that had brought them there seemed to run across one side of this pool. Max, directed by the parrot, steered the ship into smooth water, where she lay at rest at last in the very middle of this great underground lake.

""I think it's out of a book about Mexico or Peru or Ingots or some geographical place,"" said Lucy; ""it had a green-and-gold binding. I think you used it for the other end of the outer justice court. And if you did, this dome's solid silver, and there's a hole in it, and under this dome there's untold treasure in gold incas."" 

All eyes now perceived a dark hole in the roof, a round hole exactly in the middle of the shining dome. And as they gazed the dark hole became light. And they saw above them a white shining disk like a very large and very bright moon. It was the light of day. 

The bright disk was obscured; confused shapes broke its"|['1. What did Brenda say about whining in the passage?\nA. She loves whining\nB. She is very sensitive to whining\nC.

"Lucy, Philip, Max, and Brenda found themselves in a perilous situation. Lucy and Brenda were lifted up in a bucket towards an unknown place as the others watched from below. With fear and uncertainty, the group waited anxiously for the bucket to return. Suddenly, a loud metallic clang echoed through the cavern as the bucket descended rapidly. In a moment of panic, they thought Lucy was hurtling down, but she managed to throw Brenda to safety before the bucket plummeted back down. The group below was left in suspense as the lid above was shut, leaving them with only their imaginations to picture the dangers above.

They hauled up the bucket and secured the well with a lock, the key tucked safely away. Lucy faced a man in a peculiar red tunic, his round head reminding her of something she couldn't recall. Two others in similar attire stood behind him. Lucy argued that dropping pineapples into the well wasn't against the law, threatening to unleash her fierce little dog if they didn't comply. The man, a leader, admitted they were enslaved by the Great Sloth, longing for sleep but finding no relief. The city, once grand, now lay in ruins, its inhabitants dressed in distinct colored tunics denoting their roles. Lucy, learning from the women, realized the danger posed by the Great Sloth and the need for swift action to outsmart it.|"[""1.

"""I will go and sing to the Great Sloth,"" she said, ""and you must go around and say the name of power to everyone you meet, and tell them you're the Deliverer. Then if my idea doesn't work, we must overpower the Great Sloth by numbers and... You just go around saying 'Halma!' - got it?""

The temple of the Great Sloth was made of solid gold. It had stunning pillars, doorways, windows, and courts, each paved with gold flagstones. In the center was a large room entirely feather-bed, where the Great Sloth spent its days eating, sleeping, and listening to music.

""You have a kind nature,"" said the Great Sloth, emerging and peering at her with sleepy interest. It was massive, as big as a young elephant, walking on hind legs like a gorilla, and very black.

Something pushed the Great Sloth out, revealing a vast feather-bed being moved by a force stronger than the sloth itself. Lucy watched as the Great Sloth retreated into the room, now filled with a complex machine it was operating.

""Quick!"" she urged, ""the Great Sloth is pumping water for you. Dig a channel for the water. The Deliverer has returned your river.""

Lucy promised to speak to the Great Sloth about behaving, reminding the people to work and chant 'Halma!' every time the clock struck to remember their freedom and destiny."|"[""1.

The Halma people were once full of energy and hard work until the arrival of the Great Sloth. With the Sloth now working eight hours a day, its sleepiness no longer affected the villagers. They worked diligently like ants, rebuilding their community. A banquet was held to honor the Deliverers, serving only pineapple and water due to time constraints. Despite some disappointment, the speeches were flattering. Lucy suggested visiting Polistopolis to investigate opened books. They discussed a method involving cucumbers to progress towards their goal slowly but surely, akin to politics. Lucy proposed finding someone interested in driving a motor for a living.|['1.

Once upon a time in Halma, a man who loved machinery wished for a motor car to escape the monotony of pineapple gathering. To his surprise, a powerful B.S.A. sixty horse-power car appeared out of nowhere. The children, Philip and Helen, enjoyed the peaceful ride through familiar cities until they reached Polistopolis, where the streets were eerily empty. Sensing danger, they decided to disguise themselves and sneak into the city. Tired and accompanied by their pets, Max and Brenda, they sought refuge in a mysterious house. Inside, they were greeted by a captain who questioned their intentions but eventually realized they were not a threat. The children found themselves in a precarious situation, unsure of what awaited them in the unfamiliar city.|"['Question 1: Why did the man in Halma wish for a motor car?\nA) To collect more pineapples\nB) To escape the monotony of pineapple gathering\nC) To impress his friends\nD) To go on a vacation\nE) To start a taxi service', 'Question 2: What type of car appeared for the man in Halma?\nA) Toyota Corolla\nB) Ford Mustang\nC) B.S.A. sixty horse-power car\nD) Volkswagen Beetle\nE) Tesla Model S', 'Question 3: Where did Philip and Helen enjoy a peaceful ride in the car?\nA) Through dense forests\nB) Through unfamiliar cities\nC) Through the desert\nD) Through a mountain range\nE) Through a swamp', 'Question 4: Why did Philip and Helen decide to disguise themselves in Polistopolis?\nA) To blend in with the locals\nB) To surprise their friends\nC) To hide from their parents\nD) To avoid danger\nE) To participate in a costume party', 'Question 5: Who greeted Philip and Helen inside the mysterious house in Polistopolis?\nA) A chef\nB) A captain\nC) A doctor\nD) A teacher\nE) A musician', ""Question 6: How did the captain initially react to Philip and Helen's presence in the house?\nA) He welcomed them with open arms\nB) He ignored them\nC) He questioned their intentions\nD) He asked them to leave immediately\nE) He offered them food and shelter""]"|['B) To escape the monotony of pineapple gathering', 'C) B.S.A. sixty horse-power car', 'B) Through familiar cities', 'D) To avoid danger', 'B) A captain', 'C) He questioned their intentions']
The captain explained that the Queen, claiming to have done seven deeds, had guards surrounding the city, preventing any messages from getting in or out. These guards were not from their land but were summoned by the Queen from a book. She tricked the people into pulling down the Hall of Justice by luring them with the promise of fruit within the giant books it was made of. The soldiers, known as the Sequani and the Aedui, emerged from the opened book. A diverse group gathered for a council meeting, including servants, soldiers, and even a pirate. Lucy felt responsible for telling the Queen about barbarians and legions, which inspired her to summon these soldiers. Philip called upon Caesar for help, and the book unleashed an army of armed men led by Caesar himself.|"['1.

Caesar commanded Titus Labienus to drive the rebels back into the book where they belonged, daring to escape after nineteen hundred years. He inquired about their leader and ordered their freedom. Leading the soldiers to the main gate, Caesar prepared for the fierce battle ahead. Meanwhile, Lucy and Philip hid in the ruins, awaiting Caesar's return to the book. As the town woke up with its usual sounds, the clang of swords and battle cries signaled the fight's commencement. The barbarians fled before Caesar's legions, leaping into the open book one by one.

The Romans calmly passed through the ruins towards the marble-covered book, disappearing two by two. Each saluted the mighty conqueror with silent respect. A girl ran down the steps and approached Caesar, who playfully pinched her ear. Caesar warned her about hearing the world through a pinched ear after a battle. The Pretenderette, who had shown courage against them, confessed her actions. She revealed her ambitions to be Queen and her struggles as a servant. Caesar sentenced her to teach the Great Sloth to enjoy work in Briskford and to find love among the Halma people. Her penance would end when the Great Sloth loved his work and the Halma people cherished her.|"['1.

Lucy felt torn between wanting to apologize to the Pretenderette and feeling like it wasn't her fault to do so. As Caesar bid farewell, the children were dazzled by the rising sun's glare on his armor. Suddenly, Lucy exclaimed, 'Daddy!' as the sun's rays revealed Caesar's departure. Three days later, Mr. Noah arrived by elephant, announcing Philip's new title as King. The coronation was grand, but Mr. Noah sadly informed them that in a republic, kings and queens couldn't stay. The children built a house with blocks from Mr. Noah before a strange dizziness overcame them. The room vanished, and they found themselves outside the Grange with Helen and Mr. Peter Graham.|"[""1.
