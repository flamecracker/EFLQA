In the afternoon, the parson's wife helped Grandma get dressed for church. Grandma expressed missing Mrs. Pepper and the children, longing to see them again. Mrs. Henderson, tired but willing, offered to read letters from the Pepper children to Grandma. Excited at the mention of letters, Grandma settled in a big chair by the window. Remembering the stand where Joel Pepper used to search for peppermints, she felt comforted to have it nearby. Peletiah, the parson's son, was asked to read the letters to Grandma. Worried about Polly being hurt, Grandma anxiously awaited the news from the letters.

Joel found himself surrounded by a group of boys who mocked him for talking about his granddad. As the boys teased him, a sudden thunderstorm hit, causing panic in the boat. Lightning struck, capsizing the boat and plunging everyone into the water. Joel tried to help them get into his boat, but chaos ensued as the boys struggled to stay afloat. Despite Joel's warnings, some boys attempted to grab his boat, prompting him to threaten them with his oar. Eventually, Joel managed to get everyone into his boat or clinging to the overturned one. As they rowed back to shore, tensions ran high among the boys, with a shift in leadership from Mike to Jack. The storm raged on, drenching them all, but they made it back safely, albeit with a sense of betrayal and unease lingering in the air.|"['1.

"Joel, with his black curls dripping from the rain, nodded in approval at the group of boys.
