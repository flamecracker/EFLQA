The camp was attacked by a group of Indians who rushed in with fierce shouts and shots fired in the air. Despite the boys and Hank trying to defend, the raid overwhelmed them.

The fire lit by Joe revealed the chaos left behind by the Indians. Hank managed to prevent the horses from running off. The boys were upset about their films being taken, but Hank explained that the Indians likely mistook the film boxes for food due to hunger. They did not harm the boys and only wanted to scare them.

Blake was concerned about the distance the raiders would cover if they waited, but Hank assured him they wouldn't go far before stopping to eat and rest.

The film crew embarked on a return journey to their hotel after visiting different filming locations. Packing their belongings with the help of an automatic camera was a quick task, and soon they were traveling down the coast again. They received a warm welcome from the members of the theatrical colony. Mr. Ringold had moved the company to a small fishing settlement called Chester for filming. The fishery owner, Chester, had a fleet of motor boats used by fishermen to pull up nets twice a day. The captured fish were packed in ice for transport, and local dealers visited daily to collect their orders. The crew stayed in a large cottage by the beach, where they had comfort similar to a hotel. The location provided a picturesque backdrop with heavy surf waves, ideal for their film scenes.|['1.

"The hand engine was positioned for emergency use by the fish concern. It had proven valuable in past small fires. Fishermen efficiently passed buckets to douse a blaze near the tank.

The boat was carefully guided down the sloping beach using rollers and planks until it was right at the water's edge. The engine roared to life as the boat remained tethered by a rope secured with a unique knot. With practiced eyes, the men monitored the waves to ensure a safe launch. One man stood ready to release the knot, signaling the launch. The boat glided into the water, battling the breakers as the engine propelled it forward. Despite the rough waters, the craft stayed afloat and sped towards the fishing nets. The fishermen hauled in a bountiful catch while the boys captured the action on camera.

They walked by the sea, exploring different spots that caught their attention. Passing a cluster of small oak trees away from the shore, they climbed a gentle slope to see the Pacific Ocean. Suddenly, they heard voices as they were about to step into a clearing. Carefully, they moved closer and hid behind some trees, peering into the open area.

Mr. Boundley advised against venturing out that night due to safety concerns in an unfamiliar area. The government man suggested waiting until daylight to gather clues safely. The group agreed and decided to return to the lighthouse. They discussed their plan to track down the wreckers the next day, motivated by a personal interest in proving someone's innocence. The boys prepared to film the wreckers and searched the area for clues the next day, using their experience with the Moqui Indians. Despite their efforts, they struggled to find a lead on the wreckers' whereabouts. Joe speculated that the wreckers likely moved along the coast, away from the lighthouse and closer to the shore to execute their plan.|"['1.

"Joe Duncan quickly joined his friend's side. Excitedly, he examined the piece of cloth snagged on a thorn bush, torn from someone's clothing. Not weather-worn, it indicated recent placement. ""Blake, you're correct,"" agreed his friend. ""They passed this way, perhaps to mislead or find an alternate beach route,"" as the cloth clung inland. They ventured into the dense foliage, lacking a clear path. Aware the wreckers aimed to conceal their tracks, the boys pressed forward cautiously. Discovering a fragment of metal, Blake inferred it was from the wreckers' lantern, confirming their pursuit. Tracing a narrow trail along the coast, the boys detected fresh footprints diverging in various directions, strategically confusing potential followers.

"""Yes, they're setting up the same lantern on a rock pile,"" Joe noted. Both boys recognized the device they had seen before. The men were hurriedly placing it, working fast to make up for lost time. ""It's the same group,"" Blake observed. ""They must know a ship will pass soon, or they wouldn't rush.

"""That's a fantastic plan,"" exclaimed one of the government officials. ""Capturing them on film! They won't be able to deny being there when they were caught,"" he said with a dark chuckle. Luck favored our friends in two crucial ways during their pursuit of the wreckers. Otherwise, the criminals might have escaped, fleeing quickly when the alarm sounded. However, the leader, Hemp Danforth, stumbled and fell, giving Tom Cardiff an opportunity to apprehend him. Despite a fierce struggle, Tom managed to overpower the man with his strength. Meanwhile, the secret service agents had also subdued their targets. Just when it seemed some of the wreckers might escape, reinforcements arrived in the form of four fishermen armed with clubs. With the additional help, the remaining wreckers surrendered, and the captured group was secured. Tom expressed relief at their success, ensuring all the criminals were apprehended."|"['1.

"""That's correct!"" exclaimed Blake, trying to stop the bleeding from a cut on his face, obtained during the scuffle he and Joe had with their captive. Joe himself was somewhat battered. ""A bit later and we would have only caught half of them,"" continued Blake. 

""Fishermen! You men have never done an honest day's fishing!"" shouted Abe Haskill. ""Fishing! When you weren't smuggling, you were wrecking or stealing from other honest fishermen. You're a group of scoundrels, and it's the best thing we've done in years to capture you!""

""Yes, heard by these two boys, whom you pursued but couldn't capture. I think when Blake Stewart and Joe Duncan go to court and testify about hearing you discuss wrecking ships with your false lantern, the jury will convict you, for sure!""

""This, and it's a good one. You believe you can convict us based on the testimony of Nate Duncan's son. Well, Nate is one of us! His son's testimony wouldn't hold. Plus, a son wouldn't help convict his father. That's a good one. Nate Duncan is one of us!""

Late that afternoon, Mr. Hadley praised the moving picture boys for their work capturing the wreckers. Excited about the film they had made, he urged them to focus on their future projects. Mr. Ringold shared his plans for a sea drama but expressed concerns about making a wreck scene realistic. As preparations for the film continued, a storm approached, causing alarm among the locals.

The coast guard scanned the horizon, spotting a vessel in distress. Blake and Joe glimpsed the ship's broken masts through a spyglass. Urgently, plans were made to set up rescue equipment on the beach. The crew prepared to save the stranded sailors as the storm raged on. Blake rallied the fishermen and the life savers to assist in the perilous mission. The vessel was rapidly approaching the treacherous Dolphin Rocks.

The doomed ship was closer to shore now, with sailors visible on the wave-washed decks, some tied to masts and rigging. The life savers were preparing to use the breeches buoy to rescue them. A mortar was loaded with a projectile connected to a line, coiled neatly on the sand. The projectile was fired towards the ship, aiming to get the line onboard. Once secured, the sailors on the ship would haul a heavy cable. The cable was raised high above the waves on wooden shears, with the breeches buoy ready to transport people to safety. The sailors on the ship began pulling the line, and the rescue operation was in full swing, with everyone working together to bring the sailors ashore to safety.|['1.

"The men worked harder, with Blake and Joe assisting in the rescue while Mr. Hadley supervised. ""Two of them are clinging to the buoy!"" shouted Blake. The ship was breaking apart too quickly for another trip. The rescuers hesitated, feeling the impossibility of saving both in time.

I knew I could not deny it, especially then, and a sudden need to depart to China arose, prompting my immediate departure. I understand now that it might have seemed suspicious, particularly after the accusations against me. However, I am now prepared to confront the situation. I can demonstrate my innocence in the wrecking incident and how I distanced myself from Hemp and his group as soon as I learned of their involvement. If we can locate Hemp, I can easily make him confess to this. Unexpectedly, after years of searching, I learned she had been raised in a minister's household and had recently gone to China as a missionary's assistant. Upon hearing this, I promptly decided to embark on a sea voyage to bring her back.
