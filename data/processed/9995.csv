"When people talk about ""Our New Possessions,"" they are referring to the recent territories acquired by the United States, including Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and the Philippines. Cuba, however, is not part of this list as it is on its way to becoming an independent country. Puerto Rico, located in the Atlantic Ocean east of Haiti, is the smallest of the Greater Antilles Islands. Its mountainous terrain is covered with lush vegetation, cultivated plantations, and coffee orchards that thrive due to the fertile soil and abundant moisture. With over twelve hundred rivers and numerous springs hidden in the mountains, Puerto Rico's landscape is a mix of green hills and rich valleys. Discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, the island's natural beauty and resources have made it a significant area of interest."|"['1.

In 1508, the Spanish navigator Ponce de Leon explored an island that he found to be beautiful and inhabited by friendly natives. The natives welcomed him with gifts and showed him gold. Unfortunately, the Spaniards repaid their kindness with cruelty, enslaving and killing many of them. A revolution ensued, leading to the demise of most natives. The island, known for its perpetual summer, boasts a pleasant climate with cool nights and trade winds. It experiences two seasons: a rainy period from July to December and a dry one from January to June. While the island is generally healthy, it faces occasional hurricanes and fevers due to poor drainage. Residents can anticipate a hurricane by a sudden calm before the storm hits.|"['1.

As the wind gradually picks up speed, changing directions unpredictably, it signals an approaching storm. Suddenly, a deafening roar fills the air as a hurricane strikes the island, causing chaos and destruction. Trees are torn from the ground, crops are ruined, and houses are demolished. Villages are leveled, and lives are lost or altered forever. In preparation for such calamities, people seek shelter in caves or cellars, stocking up on supplies like cane juice and food. To fortify against the hurricanes, homes are built with sturdy stone walls, reinforced doors, and windows. When the storm nears, the town is deserted, with doors and shutters tightly secured. The anxious wait during the hurricane is harrowing, with the constant threat of collapsing structures and flying debris. It is a relief that Puerto Rico is spared from such devastating storms.|['1.

Our stateroom felt stuffy, so we headed to the deck for fresh air. The steward brought our meals as we relaxed in steamer chairs, watching waves, seagulls, and porpoises. As we sailed into warmer seas, we shed our wraps for lighter clothes and donned shade-hats to shield our eyes from the sun's glare on the water.

In the vibrant streets of San Juan, children of different ages and hues play freely, while adults stroll casually, puffing on dark cigars.

In the market, vendors often overcharge Americans, assuming they are wealthy. Fruits like oranges, bananas, and vegetables like yams, sweet potatoes are common. Houses in Puerto Rico have flat roofs and iron balconies. The upper stories have balconies that project over narrow streets. The interiors have open central courts with fountains and trees. Families gather here to enjoy cool sea breezes. The poor live in crowded rooms, while the rich occupy upper floors. Walls are adorned with paintings and tropical plants. Water is collected in cisterns from rain. Ice is a luxury, and water is stored in porous jars to keep cool.

In Puerto Rico, business people often have breakfast with their employees at a long table in a veranda or a room. In the afternoon, everyone takes a siesta. Houses near the wharves are usually one story high, made of wood, and poorly ventilated. They are crowded with poor residents. The people can be divided into five classes: upper-class Puerto Ricans, lower-class whites, negroes, mixed-race individuals, and foreigners. Women in families spend time embroidering and gossiping in patios or on balconies. Labor is seen as degrading by the wealthy, who employ many servants. Some servants are paid, while others receive only board and clothes, yet all are content. City children often live in crowded basements with limited bathing opportunities, while country children enjoy playing in streams. Education is not a priority for girls, and only a small fraction of the population can read or write.|"['1.

In Puerto Rico, schools have between fifty to one hundred and twenty-five students in each room with a few teachers. The students sit on benches or on the floor with boys and girls attending separate schools. Some children miss school due to lack of clothes or because they prefer playing outside. Parents often don't encourage education. Fortunately, the United States is rapidly improving schools and providing capable teachers across the island. Puerto Ricans have many holidays, but have recently added Washington's birthday and the Fourth of July to their calendar. They celebrated the Fourth with speeches, fireworks, races, and processions. Puerto Ricans now show loyalty by doffing their hats when the flag is lowered. They make their guitars and use a unique instrument called a guida. Sundays are for church in the morning, followed by activities like cockfighting or bullfights. Cockfighting is a popular pastime with game-cocks challenging each other.|"['1.

The cock fights happen on weekends and special days, lasting most of the day. The birds are taken to the arena, described, and bets placed. One fight follows another, with large sums won and lost. In Puerto Rico, due to poor roads, people carry heavy loads on their heads, shoulders, or backs. Banana and plantain vendors carry their fruit on poles, while vegetable sellers carry their goods on long boards on their heads. Butchers bring meat on horseback, and poultry is transported in coop-strung ponies. The island has limited transportation, with only one good road from San Juan to Ponce. The best roads are along the coast, except for the military road connecting Ponce and San Juan. Away from the coasts, bridle paths are used, but roads are often impassable during the rainy season. People use pony carriages, saddlehorses, ox-carts, and travel on foot, with donkeys or ponies as pack animals. Farmers make up most of the population, living in scattered homes across fertile lands.|['1.

A farmer is walking down the street towards the market. His horse looks thin and mean. He carries his produce in baskets with a machete sticking out of one. The machete is like a large, long knife he always has with him. He uses it to cut paths through the forest or overgrown bridle paths. The farmer is content with his simple life, owning a horse, a cow, game-cocks, a gun, and some land. He wears a cotton jacket, a white shirt, check pantaloons, and a broad-brimmed hat made of grass. The farmer's house is basic, made from poles and palm bark, thatched with leaves or grass. There are no chimneys, few windows, and minimal furniture like gourd dishes, earthen pots, hammocks, and a machete.|"['1.

At night, the residents of Puerto Rico sleep on the floor or in hammocks. During the day, they swing in hammocks, play guitars, and smoke. The landscape is filled with coffee, sugar cane, and tobacco plantations, alongside stock farms. The land is fertile, with streams watering the lush pasture lands. Herds of horses, cattle, and sheep graze on the plains. The sheep's wool is similar to goat hair, not like the wool in other countries. Peasant laborers live in huts provided by landowners near the plantations. They tend gardens and wash clothes using soapberry tree seeds or the soap vine. After washing, they spread clothes to dry on bushes. Tired women rest under trees, chatting until evening. They bundle up the dry clothes and head home up the mountain.|"['1.

In the tropical island of Puerto Rico, where lush forests and beautiful beaches abound, my friends and I spend our days exploring the unique wildlife and enjoying the warm sea. Little crabs scuttle across the floor and friendly lizards croak from the walls. Instead of a morning bath, we take a refreshing dip in the sea and enjoy a breakfast of turtle eggs, breadfruit, plantain, and coconut milk on the veranda. Hammocks sway in the sea breeze as we relax, taking in the stunning views. Our host introduces us to mountain cabbage, a tasty palm tree bud. We join him on walks to discover more about the island's animals, like the agouti, armadillo, and iguana. Though the birds are fewer due to hunting, we still marvel at the beauty of the singing mockingbirds, wild canaries, and more.|['1.

The iguana is a lizard that primarily eats fruits and vegetables. It can grow up to three to four feet long and is not considered a visually appealing creature. They typically avoid conflict unless provoked. Iguanas are arboreal, meaning they live in trees, bushes, and the crevices of rocks. Hunters sometimes use smoke to drive them out of hiding places. The meat of iguanas, when cooked, resembles chicken or veal and is a local delicacy. However, the most delicious meat comes from land crabs and crayfish. These creatures are caught in large numbers during their migration from mountains to the coast for egg-laying. Sponges, once thought to be part of the plant kingdom, are now known to belong to the animal kingdom. Mollusks like mussels and clams have various uses beyond food, such as making buttons and road materials. Cultivated fruits, flowers, and vegetables are grown multiple times a year for a continuous supply. Ferns can grow into large trees with hanging fronds, while some plants have vibrant colored leaves. The coconut tree, found abundantly in Puerto Rico and the Antilles, produces heavy fruit loads near the coast. The tree's trunk is slender, yet it bears the weight of the fruit. Harvesting coconuts involves cutting bunches and lowering them with ropes. The green, shiny husks cover the nuts. The palm tree's trunk is used by locals to make boats, furniture, and houses|['1.

The fibrous material found at the base of the foot stalks of a tree serves various purposes. It is used for making sieves and woven into clothing. The flowers of the tree are used to make medicine, while palm wine is made from the flower-stalks. The juice extracted from the tree is used to make sugar and vinegar. Additionally, water, jelly, and meat can be obtained from the fruit or nut of the tree. The kernel of the tree produces oil, and the leftover parts are used as food for fowls and cattle, as well as for manure. Another useful tree is the calabash, or gourd tree, which provides natives with household utensils. The tree's fruit, resembling a gourd, is used to make items like bottles, cups, and musical instruments. The dye used for coloring butter and cheese comes from the annotto bush, a plant that grows to the size of a quince tree. The rosy flowers of the annotto bush are followed by fuzzy red-and-yellow pods containing seeds used to make a crimson paste. This paste is dried into cakes and then used to color butter and cheese. Bay rum, a perfume for baths, is derived from the leaves of the bay tree, which also bears fruit used to make this fragrant product.|['1.

The nutmeg tree grows to a height of around thirty to fifty feet. When ripe, the fruit resembles an apricot from the outside. It splits open to reveal a dark nut covered with bright scarlet mace, which is then flattened after being stripped off. The shells are cracked open when fully dried, and the nuts are powdered with lime to ward off worms. Other significant crops include pepper, which can bear fruit for up to thirty years, vanilla beans, and cacao, which takes eight years to fully mature. The streets of even the smallest villages are paved, and public squares are adorned with trees, flowers, and bandstands. The people of Puerto Rico are eager to provide their children with educational opportunities like those in the United States, indicating a promising future for the island. Geography and history lessons should emphasize the interconnectedness of all countries and peoples, fostering a sense of global unity and understanding. Maps and globes should be utilized regularly in the classroom to enhance geographical knowledge. Students should learn how to interpret maps and time cards effectively, starting with their own homes as reference points.|['1.

Pupils will have the opportunity to choose the routes or roads for their travels. Each student must provide a reason for their preference, along with the distance and time needed for the journey. The majority vote will determine the final route, and preparations for the trip will be made. It's important to research the best time to visit each country, suitable clothing, estimated expenses, and currency exchange details. A designated Guide will gather travel resources like timetables and maps. The class will be led through the journey, exploring cities, populations, occupations, and historical landmarks. A Geographer will discuss the geography and climate, while a Librarian will provide reading materials. A Photographer will manage visual aids, and curiosities and stamps will be collected for a class museum.|['1.

This building work can be done by students after school under the guidance of the historian and artist. The dolls, once dressed, can be used to create scenes like courts, homes, fields, or forests on a sand table. A musician can share the country's music and talk about famous singers or composers. They can even perform the national song. A literary expert can discuss famous figures from the country we're exploring and take us to their homes. They can highlight the literature and read excerpts from renowned writers. Before our trip, we reserve our cabins. Let's plan our luggage. Why do we need a steamer trunk? How big should it be? What about hand luggage? We must pack warm clothes for the ship and lighter outfits for our destination. To inform our friends of our safe arrival, we can use a cablegram, which can be sent from Puerto Rico.|"['1.

"When selecting a guide for a trip, it is crucial to choose someone who is polite, tactful, patient, and good-natured. Why? Because guiding a group can be challenging, and patience is essential. After a few conversational lessons, students can start keeping diaries to write about what they observe, hear, or learn during their studies or visits. Describing experiences on a vessel and narrating interesting events during the voyage can help improve their expressive skills. Encourage students to collect seaweed, ocean shells, sponges, and pictures of sea creatures for a lesson on sea life. To conclude a study on a country, consider organizing an ""Afternoon or Evening Abroad"" event where students can share their knowledge with parents and friends. Decorate the room with tropical plants and set up tables displaying products from the studied country. Invite merchants to lend imported or native products for a more engaging experience."|"['1.
