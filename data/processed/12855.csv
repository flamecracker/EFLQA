The United States traces its origins back to the citizens, colonists, and pioneers who ventured to the New World known as America. The groundwork for these pioneers was laid by the sea-dogs of the Elizabethan era, led by Sir Francis Drake, who secured England's command of the seas. These sea-dogs paved the way for English sailors to navigate to Spain's New World, kickstarting Anglo-American history. Meanwhile, in Italy, renowned cities like Florence, Genoa, and Venice flourished in arts, navigation, and trade. Among these Italian cities, Giovanni Caboto, a Genoese sailor, found his way to Venice, a hub of sea-borne commerce. Renamed Zuan in Venice, he later settled in Bristol, a key English port with strong merchant guilds already engaged in international trade. The English, particularly those from Bristol, were known for their ventures to Iceland for fishing and trade, connecting distant lands through commerce routes.|"['1.

Henry VII, the first Tudor monarch and Queen Elizabeth's grandfather, was known for his thrift and practicality. Despite being presented with evidence of lands to the west by Columbus, he initially turned a deaf ear due to his own troubles in England. However, after Columbus discovered America and the Pope divided heathen lands between Spain and Portugal, Henry decided to take action. In 1497, he granted John Cabot and his sons authority to sail under the English banner to seek out unknown lands. Cabot, sailing in the ship _Matthew_, reached Cape Breton, marking the beginning of English exploration in North America. Despite concerns from the Spanish ambassador, Henry VII recognized Cabot's achievement with a royal gift and continued support for further voyages westward.|"[""1.

During the Age of Exploration, John Cabot set sail with a fleet of five ships, but only four continued the journey as one turned back. Eventually, John disappeared from history, and his son Sebastian took over. Sebastian was known for his ability in various roles and his gift of storytelling, although he left no written records. He led expeditions to Newfoundland, where the waters were teeming with codfish, a valuable resource for trade. Sebastian's tales of the abundance of codfish may have had some truth to them, as cod were known to grow to impressive sizes and even swallow unusual items. The discovery of the cod banks led to a thriving fishing industry that attracted various European nations. Sebastian's explorations extended to Greenland and the northeastern coast of North America in search of a route to the riches of the East. Despite his efforts, North America was initially seen as an obstacle to reaching Asia, and trade ventures did not yield significant results. Subsequent explorers like Jacques Cartier furthered the exploration of North America, with his journey up the St. Lawrence River being particularly noteworthy.|"['1.

In the seventeenth century, both French and English sought to establish colonies in what is now the United States and Canada. A joke at La Salle's expense highlighted the risks of venturing farther into unknown territories. European opinion in the sixteenth century warned that those who explored beyond Mexico would face challenges. Columbus's fame surpassed that of the Cabots due to his early discovery, writings, and successful publicity. Southern lands linked to Columbus and Spain were lucrative during the sixteenth century, overshadowing the Cabots' discoveries in the north. Columbus's four hundredth anniversary celebration garnered global attention, while the Cabots' discovery of North America went unnoticed outside Bristol and Cape Breton. Sebastian Cabot, though not widely known, made significant contributions to navigation and cartography, leaving a lasting legacy in historical maps.|"[""1.

During the intense conflicts between Francis and Charles, the English Channel teemed with warships, privateers, and even pirates. England sometimes officially opposed France, but even in times of peace, many Englishmen turned to privateering and piracy. The Narrow Seas served as a rigorous training ground for seamanship, where only the swiftest ships survived. Spain and the Netherlands suffered from constant raids. Despite weaker naval forces compared to his armies, Charles managed to wage sea battles in the Mediterranean and the English Channel, stretching from Antwerp to Cadiz. Henry, facing threats from Scotland, France, and Spain, defied the Pope by divorcing Catherine of Aragon and breaking ties with the Roman Church. He built a formidable fleet, employing innovative tactics like tacking, which revolutionized sailing. Henry's modern navy enabled him to confront Francis in 1545, showcasing England's pioneering naval tactics crucial for global dominance.|"['1.

In 1555, the persecution of English heretics began under Queen Mary, making the sea a safer place for those against the Pope. The Royal Navy was neglected, leading to an increase in battles with traders, privateers, and pirates. Seaports became hubs of anti-Mary sentiment. In 1556, Sebastian Cabot vanished from history aboard the _Serchthrift_ bound for Muscovy. By 1557, England lost Calais to France due to Philip's maneuvers. During the war, an English squadron aided Philip in defeating the French at Gravelines. Stories from Hakluyt's _Voyages_ show English ventures in America in the 1530s. 'Master Haukins' succeeded in trading with Brazilians, while 'Master Hore' failed in Newfoundland, resulting in a tragic shipwreck and cannibalism. Life at sea in the Tudor era was harsh and only the strongest survived.|"[""1.

Here are some verses from the oldest genuine English sea-song known. They were penned in the fifteenth century, before America was discovered, and may have been slightly edited by the scribe. The original manuscript is now in Trinity College, Cambridge. It's a true nautical piece, a rarity as authentic sea-songs were not often published and weren't popular with landlubbers. The song portrays a merchant ship carrying passengers who amuse the sailors with their discomforts. Some nautical terms like _Howe—hissa!_ are still used on deepwater vessels. Seasickness and the effort to hide it seem timeless. Another sea-song is sung by the sailors themselves, expressing disdain for soldiers who look down on them. There's also a piece of advice for young men aspiring to improve their fortunes through navigation. The vocabulary used on Tudor ships was a mix of Mediterranean and Oriental terms, with some technicalities that would still be familiar to modern sailors.|['1.

"In the sixteenth century, life at sea brought encounters with America. The experienced sailor, Captain John Smith, Governor of Virginia and Admiral of New England, detailed the tactics for capturing a prize in ""The Seaman's Grammar."" When preparing for battle, the ship would be stripped down to its fighting sails to maintain agility. The crew would strategically engage the enemy with cannons and board the ship if needed. In the aftermath of a skirmish, wounded sailors would be tended to, and the fallen honored with a salute.

During Elizabethan England, the country's governance was a complex interplay of Crown, nobles, parliament, and the people, each with distinct roles. The sovereign was tasked with safeguarding the nation's well-being within the limits of Crown resources. In times of crisis, the nobles and commoners were expected to contribute to the common good. Noblesse oblige dictated that those with estates or privileges must support the nation when needed. Elizabeth I skillfully managed the country's finances, paying off debts and investing in defense and prosperity. England's wealth grew, foreign trade boomed, and domestic industries thrived. The transition from medieval peasant farming to prosperous yeoman holdings boosted the economy. The Tudor monarchs, lacking a powerful army, relied on diplomacy and governance to unify the nobility and commoners around the throne, ensuring stability and progress.|"[""1.

Elizabethan society displayed stark contrasts. While some areas in England saw an increase in enclosures due to the profitability of sheep-raising over farming, this led to tenants losing their land and becoming vagabonds or seeking opportunities in London or at sea. The smaller towns had limited prospects as trade was controlled by medieval guilds. The dissolution of these guilds began as craftsmen formed new industrial settlements. There were also issues with wages due to rising prices caused by the influx of gold and silver, making basic necessities unaffordable for many. These economic challenges pushed young men towards maritime professions like privateering or piracy in pursuit of wealth. Monopolies, speculation, and smuggling further influenced the sea trade, with risky ventures attracting adventurous individuals seeking fortune. Marine insurance, although different from modern practices, was already in existence during this period, laying the foundation for future developments in the industry.|['1.

During the Elizabethan era, joint-stock companies were a popular way of investing in businesses. This concept of 'going shares' dates back to ancient times and was common among medieval and Elizabethan traders. Initially, people who shared investments knew each other and the business well. The favorite number of shares was sixteen, as seen in various ventures like land-shares in Celtic households and shares in theaters like the one Shakespeare profited from. As investments grew larger, the number of shares increased, especially with ventures like the New River Company and the Ulster 'Plantation.' Speculation on ventures like the Virginia 'Plantation' attracted a wide range of investors. The idea of company-promotion was prevalent, with prospectuses describing the benefits of investments. Monopolies granted by the Crown and speculation led to the formation of trusts, similar to modern-day trusts, with some ventures failing despite promising prospects. Playwrights like Ben Jonson satirized the absurdities of these investment schemes in their works.|"['1.

The Newcastle coal trade developed into a powerful trust with a government monopoly, as long as taxes were paid. The Starch Monopoly was profitable, allowing Elizabethan fashion to flourish with starched ruffled collars. However, America was seen as a land of opportunity, with a belief that it held hidden riches waiting to be discovered. Monopolies in America were viewed as obstacles, but also as a way to regulate trade. Monopolists acted as government agencies, managing trade, revenue, and regulations. While monopolies had their drawbacks, they played a role in governing the economy.|['1.

During the Elizabethan era, England and Spain were fierce rivals. Spain sought tribute while England sought trade. Elizabeth, a skilled businesswoman, led England's overseas trade, ensuring English ships traded wherever possible. When foreign authorities discriminated against English goods, English sea-dogs defended their interests fiercely. Elizabeth's extravagant court served strategic purposes, attracting the upper classes and showcasing royal power. Despite her lavish spending on 3,000 dresses and opulent jewelry, Elizabeth's sound financial management protected the state. The influx of wealth led to extravagant fashion trends, with bizarre attire becoming the norm. Citizens and burgesses, eager to display their newfound riches, adopted outlandish styles. The era was marked by a clash of cultures, with England's unique fashion choices drawing both admiration and criticism.|"[""1.

During the 16th century, the seas were bustling with trade, as explorers like Verrazano and Cartier ventured into new territories. Queen Elizabeth of England ensured that trade paid customs to her treasury, funding shipbuilding. France, under Francis I, explored the Americas, sparking conflicts with Spain. England's relationship with Spain shifted due to anti-Papal sentiments and sympathy for heretics. The discovery of Potosi's silver mines reshaped global economics, empowering Spain. English sea-dogs like John Hawkins engaged in the slave trade with New Spain, despite conflicts over trade restrictions. Hawkins' voyages to Sierra Leone and Hispaniola marked the beginning of English involvement in the transatlantic slave trade, challenging Spanish dominance in the region. The era was characterized by intrigue, rivalry, and a growing thirst for power and wealth.|"['1.

"In 1564, undeterred, Hawkins set sail with four ships and 170 men. Queen Elizabeth herself invested in the expedition, lending the ""Jesus of Lubeck,"" a ship of 700 tons. Slavery was unquestioned then. While Spanish missionary Las Casas condemned Spanish cruelty towards Indians, he believed Africans, who could be domesticated, could replace Indians who couldn't. The argument for slavery was that Africans thrived if treated well. The argument against, based on mistreatment, emerged slowly. During departure, a tragic accident occurred, killing an officer. Hawkins set rules for his ships to stay together, using signals for communication and safety. John Sparke chronicled the voyage vividly, encountering new sights like Caribs, alligators, and more. The expedition's stop in Teneriffe surprised them with armed Spaniards, mistaking Hawkins for a privateer due to previous English and Huguenot privateering successes. After clarifications, they were warmly received by the Spaniards."|"[""1.

"Sparke marveled at the Arbol Santo tree on Ferro Island, which provided water for the inhabitants and cattle. Despite having three springs on Teneriffe, water was scarce. The Arbol Santo, a massive laurel on a rocky ledge, collected water from the morning mist on its leaves, filling two cisterns. Hawkins encountered the Sapies in Africa, who were enslaved by both black conquerors and later white men. Sparke noted the unique canoes in Sambula, resembling cradles, carved and painted in red and blue. Hawkins faced challenges with the negroes, losing men to attacks and sharks. Despite difficulties, he traded in the West Indies and Florida, encountering resistance from Spanish officials.

Three European powers, Spain, France, and England, were vying for control in Florida during the 16th century. The French attempted two colonies, but both failed due to internal strife and lack of resources. The Englishman Hawkins, originally not bound for Florida, ended up there and engaged in trade. The French colonists, mostly former pirates, were unruly and disrespectful. They were eventually captured by the Spanish, with some executed and others imprisoned. The French had an interesting habit of smoking herbs. Hawkins, after a successful voyage, returned to England as a wealthy and respected man. Meanwhile, the Spanish, led by Menendez de Aviles, eradicated the French presence in Florida and established St. Augustine. This event heightened tensions between Spain and England, with Hawkins now under Spanish scrutiny.|['1.

In 1567, Hawkins embarked on his third challenging voyage, supported by old and new backers with a fleet of six ships: the _Jesus_, the _Minion_, the _William and John_, the _Judith_, the _Angel_, and the _Swallow_. This marked the start of two decades of maritime battles that culminated in the clash with the Armada, where Drake took command of the _Judith_. Despite a setback in 1566 due to a diplomatic incident, Hawkins sailed in 1567. The voyage faced immediate troubles, including a storm that scattered the ships and encounters with hostile natives. Despite challenges, Hawkins managed to trade with the Spaniards, even though the governor of Cartagena later rebuffed them. A storm forced the fleet back to St. John de Ulua, where they encountered a Spanish fleet. Hawkins found himself in a precarious position with a hundred slaves to sell and uncertainty about the approaching Spanish fleet.|"['1.

There was not much time for discussion; the very next morning, 'we saw open of the haven 13 great ships, the fleet of Spain.' It was a dreadful situation. '_Now_, said I, _I am in two dangers, and forced to receive the one of them_.... Either I must have kept out the fleet, which, with God's help, I was very well able to do, or else suffer them to enter with their accustomed treason.... If I had kept them out, then there had been present shipwreck of all that fleet, which amounted in value to six millions, which was in value of our money £1,800,000, which I considered I was not able to answer, fearing the Queen's Majesty's indignation.... Thus with myself revolving the doubts, I thought better to abide the jut of the uncertainty than of the certainty.' After agreements were made and hostages exchanged, the thirteen Spanish ships sailed in. The small island remained in English control. The Spaniards made promises, but secretly prepared, attacked the English suddenly by land and sea. All Englishmen on land were killed, except a few who escaped to the _Jesus_. The _Jesus_ and the _Minion_ fought off the Spanish fleet, sinking two ships and setting another on fire. Despite the valiant defense, the Spaniards overwhelmed the English on the island and fired into their ships at close range. Hawkins, calm and collected, ordered the crew to abandon the _|"['1.

The ten Spanish captives were discovered safe and unharmed on the ship Jesus. Despite having the right to kill them by the laws of war, Hawkins spared their lives. Meanwhile, the English hostages remained in captivity. Hawkins described the voyage as a series of miseries that would require a skilled writer to document fully. This disastrous journey marked the end of their hopes for New Spain and initiated twenty years of conflict with the Great Armada. Looking back to 1545, the year the Old World realized the wealth of the New World, King Henry assembled a significant fleet. In that same year, the British National Anthem was born at sea. It was also the year Francis Drake, a renowned sea captain, was born in Devon. Despite his family's modest background, Drake's upbringing was tumultuous due to religious tensions during his childhood. He apprenticed on a bark and eventually inherited it, showing early signs of his future as a daring sailor.|"['1.

Elizabeth quickly realized that the English sea-dogs sought revenge upon hearing about the news from San Juan de Ulua. The decision was made to bring the treasure to England, considering it safer there than aboard any Spanish ship in the Channel. Elizabeth acted swiftly to claim the gold, as it belonged to Italian bankers who had provided the funds. This move angered the Spanish ambassador, leading to threats from Alva to seize English assets in the Netherlands. In response, Elizabeth seized Spanish property in England. The situation escalated as England teetered on the edge of conflict with France over support for the Huguenots. Despite this tension, Elizabeth managed to navigate diplomatic waters successfully, avoiding immediate conflict.

Drake, with a small force, landed at Nombre de Dios, a key point for Spanish treasure transport. Despite the Spanish being prepared, Drake's men swiftly took control, causing panic in the town. With strategic moves and fierce determination, Drake led his men through the streets, capturing the town's riches. His bravery and skill in battle were unmatched as he fearlessly faced the Spanish defenses. The daring raid resulted in the English seizing a vast amount of silver.

A powerful storm erupted, forcing the soldiers to seek shelter. The King's Treasure House remained impenetrable. The Spaniards regrouped to attack upon realizing the English were few. Some of Drake's men grew fearful, but he bravely took charge. Despite a concealed wound causing him to faint, he continued to lead. The men, seeing his determination, rallied. After tending to his wound, Drake ordered the men to retreat back to their boats. They sailed to the Victualling Islands, where they encountered a Spanish officer seeking their true strength. Drake engaged in a diplomatic exchange, keeping their true intentions veiled. The Spanish officer departed with compliments, leaving both leaders uncertain of each other's plans.

One day, Drake's crew almost rebelled due to the lack of food. Drake reminded them of God's constant help. Soon, a Spanish ship appeared, loaded with food. The crew thanked God for the timely help. However, sickness struck the crew, and many fell ill, including Drake's brother. Despite this, Drake prepared for an attack on Panama. With a small group, they marched towards Panama, spying on Spanish movements. They planned to ambush a Spanish convoy carrying gold and jewels. As they waited, a drunk Englishman almost blew their cover but was subdued. Eventually, they attacked what they thought was the gold convoy, only to realize it was a trap.

In 1573, Sir Francis Drake led a successful raid on a Spanish train carrying gold and jewels. Using a clever ambush, Drake's men overpowered the guards and seized the treasure. They then made a daring escape back to their rendezvous point along the coast. However, upon their return, they found no one there. Drake improvised a raft to reach their boats and sailed away with the loot. The plunder was divided between the French and English crew. Meanwhile, Captain Têtu and his men were captured by the Spaniards. Drake's actions caused tension between Spain and England. Eventually, a diplomatic solution was reached, and Drake's plunder was secretly shared among the involved parties. This event marked a turning point in the relationship between the two nations.|"['1.

In 1575, Drake returned to England with his friend Thomas Doughty, who was a soldier-scholar. However, Doughty's connections with the Earl of Essex caused suspicion due to his Italian influence. The following year, the 'Spanish Fury' erupted as Philip's sea power was challenged by English privateers. The Dutch mutinied in Antwerp, weakening Philip's hold and strengthening Dutch resistance. Elizabeth's policy was complex, with plots involving Don John of Austria and the Duke of Anjou. To counter Spanish influence, Elizabeth sought Drake's advice on how to retaliate against Spain. Drake proposed raiding the Spanish Indies, which Elizabeth embraced, swearing secrecy to protect the plan. Despite Lord Treasurer Burleigh's caution, Elizabeth was determined to seek revenge on Spain. Drake's daring scheme was set in motion, with plans to raid the Pacific to retaliate against Spanish injustices.|"[""1.

Drake's flotilla faced fierce storms as they approached the Land of Devils in the South Pole region. The crew believed they were under a spell cast by a crew member or native witchcraft. Thomas Doughty, suspected of treachery, attempted to incite mutiny among the crew. Drake, realizing the threat, held a trial that led to Doughty's execution. Despite their past friendship, Doughty accepted his fate as an officer and gentleman. Drake sought unity among his men, emphasizing their loyalty to Queen Elizabeth and the importance of their mission. He reprimanded troublemakers and reinstated their ranks, reminding them of their duty to their country.

Next week, Drake set sail for the feared Straits. Before entering, he renamed the ship Pelican to Golden Hind, honoring Sir Christopher Hatton. All ships lowered their sails in respect to the Queen, signifying all discoveries were in her name. Enduring seventeen days of peril in the Straits, facing icy squalls. The Pacific proved worse, with a relentless gale for fifty-two days. The English vessels fought for survival. The Marigold sank, and Parson Fletcher thought it a judgment. The storm eased near Cape Horn, where Drake landed. He navigated northwest, then northeast, reaching the Chilean Islands. In Valparaiso, they seized a Spanish ship with treasures. Drake cleaned the Golden Hind in Salado Bay, searching for lost ships. The news of his arrival spread fear among the Spanish authorities. Drake captured vessels, taking their treasures and letting them go. Amid encounters with Indians and Spaniards, Drake's bold actions caused chaos along the coast.|"['1.

As Drake approached Lima, he hastened his speed to avoid alerting the annual treasure ship of 1579. A smaller treasure ship had been emptied of its silver just in time to thwart him. Drake hoisted all sails on a ship he found and left it drifting to sea with two other emptied vessels. Under cover of darkness, he anchored near Lima, where Spanish ships, unguarded, were mostly empty. Spotting a promising ship from Panama, Drake's crew set off after it but faced gunfire, resulting in an English casualty. Drake then pursued the Panama ship, causing chaos by cutting the harbor cables. The Panama ship held valuable news: the prized _Nuestra Señora de la Concepcion_ was en route to Panama. Despite setbacks, Drake closed in on the treasure ship by capturing additional vessels that provided crucial updates. With the chase intensifying, Drake made strategic moves to catch up, eventually engaging in a successful confrontation that led to the capture of the Spanish captain, Anton.|"['1.

During the night, the day after, and the following night, Drake sailed west with his incredible prize to steer clear of the busy coastal trade route. The entire treasure's contents remain a mystery, but it was worth millions today. Notable items included 13 chests of pieces of eight, 80 pounds of pure gold, jewels, silver weighing 26 tons, and various other valuables. The Spanish pilot's son was amazed by the sight, as Englishmen renamed their ship from Spitfire to Spitsilver. Drake treated the prisoners kindly, even hosting a banquet for Don Anton and sending a message to Don Martin. The Spanish were in chaos upon hearing the news, unsure whether to attack or defend. Captain Don Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa felt Drake wouldn't return, leading to confusion among the Spanish. Drake's success strengthened his crew's loyalty, and even prisoners praised his leadership and well-equipped ship.|"['1.

In the 16th century, the famous English explorer Sir Francis Drake ventured to northern California, where he and his crew were mistaken for gods by the indigenous people. The natives, torn between love and fear, were in awe of Drake's leadership and kindness. Despite their admiration, Drake and his Protestant crew were uncomfortable with being worshipped. They prayed, sang Psalms, and read from the Bible to show the natives their beliefs. The Indians, enthralled by the Englishmen's religious practices, engaged in their own rituals to honor Drake as a divine figure. Drake, recognizing the potential benefits for England, declared the land New Albion and established an English protectorate. The natives, deeply devoted, sought healing and blessings from Drake before his departure, showing immense sorrow when he left. Drake's diplomatic success in trading for spices and forming alliances in the Moluccas solidified England's influence in the region for years to come.|"['1.

Leaving Ternate, the _Golden Hind_ sailed through the Archipelago until January 9, 1580. Suddenly, a violent shock hit the ship, causing it to crash onto a reef. Drake and his crew prayed and tried to free the ship, but it was stuck. They had to throw ten tons of cargo overboard to lighten the ship. At dawn, they held a religious service and continued to struggle to free the _Golden Hind_. Finally, with a strategic move and the rising tide, the ship broke free and floated. Despite facing more dangers and rumors of his demise, Drake had survived the perilous situation. The story continued with political tensions and the looming threat of the Great Armada against England. Elizabeth's diplomatic skills were put to the test as she navigated through turbulent times.|"['1.

Into this complicated situation sailed the _Golden Hind_ with a cargo of gold and silver ballast. Drake inquired about the Queen's health and learned of sickness in Plymouth, giving him a reason to anchor in the harbor. His wife and the Mayor visited him, advising caution. Drake wrote to the Queen and loyal Council members, who were hesitant. Despite a divided Council, Elizabeth decided to see Drake's treasures. The Spanish ambassador was furious. Elizabeth stood by Drake, justifying his actions as reprisals. The public admired Drake's adventures, and the Queen publicly supported him, even knighting him aboard the _Golden Hind_, defying the King of Spain.

After Drake was knighted by the Queen, he became a hero to most Englishmen, except for extreme Roman Catholics and merchants trading with Portugal and Spain. The merchants initially opposed England's policies due to their business interests. However, their views changed when Philip of Spain seized their goods and ships to build the Great Armada. The merchants realized the necessity of supporting the war effort. Meanwhile, tensions escalated between England and Spain, with threats of attacks and assassination plots. Elizabeth's council made strategic errors in naval defense, but these were overshadowed by international events. Despite the looming danger, plans for a raid on New Spain and the exploration of Virginia continued. The merchants, once in favor of Philip, now saw the importance of supporting England's military actions. The cunning tactics of figures like John Hawkins played a crucial role in thwarting Spanish plots and securing England's interests.|"[""1.

In 1585, England prepared for the 'Indies Voyage,' a significant event that captured the attention of the entire country except for the Marians. The fleet consisted of twenty-one ships, eight pinnaces, and twenty-three hundred men of various ranks. The Queen held a major stake in the expedition, led by Admiral Drake, with Vice Admiral Frobisher and Rear Admiral Knollys. This private fleet departed amidst secrecy, with no official shareholders revealed. Drake faced challenges due to delays caused by intricate diplomatic matters. Sir Philip Sidney's unexpected involvement added to the complications. The fleet made a stop at Vigo, Spain, where they confronted the governor over embargoes. After a storm and a skirmish, they set sail for the Spanish Main, following a strategic plan to raid various locations. Drake's bold actions and strategic brilliance marked the beginning of a daring adventure.|"['1.

In Hispaniola, the town of San Domingo was taken by Drake's soldiers after a fierce battle. The Spaniards, fearing the English, abandoned the town but left no treasure behind. Drake demanded ransom, but when a Maroon boy was killed by a Spanish officer, tensions rose. Drake threatened to hang two Spaniards daily until the murderer was punished. Eventually, after some skirmishes and negotiations, the English burned parts of the town until a small ransom was paid. The English seized Spanish ships and equipment, freed galley-slaves, and dealt a blow to Spanish pride. Drake's wit shone when he mocked a Spanish motto.

Once again, there was a lack of treasure to be found. The Spanish were becoming cautious about storing their valuables where they could be easily taken. Negotiations continued, marked by gradual destruction, until sickness and the lateness of the season put the English in a difficult situation. The raid on the city resulted in much less loot than expected. The men, all volunteers hoping for rewards from the spoils, started to grumble at their lack of success. Many were injured, some killed, including the loyal Tom Moone. A hundred died, more fell ill. Councils were held, one naval and one military. The military officers agreed to give up their shares to the men, but the naval officers, who were poorer and responsible for ship expenses, could not agree. Eventually, 110,000 ducats were accepted. The plan to take Havana was abandoned due to sickness and losses. Drake narrowly missed the treasure fleet and then headed to St. Augustine, Florida, destroying it and taking some goods. The fleet then sailed north and reached Raleigh's colony of Roanoke. Governor Ralph Lane was offered a free passage home but decided to stay. Drake left a ship with supplies, but it was wrecked in a storm, leading the colonists to change their minds and leave with Drake. Despite not gaining as much treasure as expected, the naval mission was a success. Upon returning, Drake wrote to Burleigh about the impact on Spain. This success was followed by the defeat of|"['1.

In 1586, Turkey faced diplomatic challenges. Antonio, a pretender to Portugal's throne, sought Turkish and Portuguese support against Spain, Catholic France, and Scotland. Meanwhile, the Great Armada posed a threat, and Drake aimed to weaken it. However, Queen Elizabeth's reluctance to openly confront enemies complicated matters. Drake defied orders, attacking Cadiz's ships, disrupting the Armada's plans. Despite initial success, Drake faced opposition at Cape St. Vincent. His second-in-command, Borough, favored traditional tactics, causing conflict. Drake's bold strategies clashed with Borough's caution, leading to Drake's decisive actions and Borough's arrest.

Sagres Castle, situated at Cape St. Vincent, was a formidable fortress. Perched on cliffs covering around a hundred acres, it stood tall at two hundred feet high, except for a narrow entrance defended by a gate just two hundred yards wide. Sir Francis Drake led the attack with his men. Half of his eight hundred soldiers engaged the Spaniards on the walls, while the other half rushed faggots to set fire to the gate. After two hours of intense fighting, the Spaniards called for a truce as their leader fell, and the gate caught fire. Drake, offering them mercy, captured the castle without further bloodshed. The nearby forts surrendered, and Sagres was dismantled. Drake's next target was Lisbon, but realizing it was heavily fortified, he withdrew after gathering valuable intelligence.

The East-India trade by sea revealed vast profits through secret documents, leading to the establishment of the East-India Company in 1600. This marked a significant milestone in trade history. Drake's strategic naval tactics disrupted Philip's plans, particularly during the Armada crisis of 1588. Philip's lack of expertise in amphibious warfare and his underestimation of the English navy's power led to a flawed strategy. Despite efforts to mobilize troops and ships, the Spanish Armada's composition was ill-suited for battle against the agile English fleet. The mismatched fleet, overloaded with soldiers and lacking proper armament, struggled to navigate the English Channel. Santa Cruz's plea for better guns highlighted the Armada's shortcomings. The campaign, known as the singeing of King Philip's beard, showcased the English navy's superiority and the flaws in the Spanish strategy.|"['1.

Santa Cruz, a respected leader, passed away, leaving the command to the unqualified Duke of Medina Sidonia. The Spanish Armada faced a crisis as volunteer sailors dwindled due to Sidonia's ineptitude. Meanwhile, the English navy, under Lord Howard of Effingham, prepared for war against the Armada. Drake, a naval genius, advocated for attacking the enemy's fleet as it left port, a strategy crucial for modern naval warfare. Despite political challenges and limited resources, Drake led the English fleet towards the Armada's gathering point at Corunna. The decisive moment approached as both fleets prepared for battle, with the English facing supply shortages while the Spanish struggled with inexperienced crew members.

On the 12th of July, the fleet returned to Plymouth, urgently restocking supplies. Howard and Drake were pivotal in their roles. Howard's leadership set the tone for all under his influence, displaying unwavering confidence. The southwest wind that initially hindered Drake's progress gave the Spanish Armada an advantage. Amidst a tense situation, Drake and Howard were alerted of the Armada's proximity, prompting swift action. Despite the initial setback caused by low supplies, the English fleet, under Drake's strategic guidance, swiftly set sail to confront the approaching Spanish Armada. The English crews worked tirelessly to prepare the ships for battle, while beacons signaled the urgency ashore. The next morning, Drake's fleet encountered the Great Armada, initially appearing superior in size but lacking the skilled seamen crucial for naval battles. As the conflict unfolded, the English fleet's superior seamanship and armament proved decisive in securing victory.|"['1.

On the 20th of July, a decisive battle unfolded between the Spanish Armada and the English fleet. The Spanish crews prayed for victory, while the English, led by Drake and Howard, used their naval skills to outmaneuver the Armada. Despite the Spanish's resolve, the English gained the upper hand by cleverly positioning their ships and using superior tactics. The English fleet, under Drake's command, surprised the Armada, taking advantage of the weather and positioning themselves strategically for the attack.

As the Armada sailed steadily up the Channel, a few exhausted ships dropped out along the way. One night, Drake noticed several unfamiliar vessels passing by. Unsure of their intentions, he decided to investigate. Drake couldn't risk all his ships following suit as they were not trained for coordinated maneuvers. So, he extinguished his stern light, turned around, and approached the strangers. To his relief, they were confused German merchant ships. As Drake was returning to his position, a Spanish flagship appeared next to his own. Drake wasted no time and demanded surrender. The Spanish admiral, Don Pedro de Valdes, a brave commander, initially hesitated but eventually surrendered upon realizing it was Drake. Despite accusations of treasure hunting, Drake's actions were honorable. Meanwhile, Howard's strategic fire-ship attack near Calais caused chaos among the Armada, leading to their disorderly flight along the Flemish coast. In the Battle of Gravelines, the Spanish suffered heavy losses and were pushed out of reach of their ally, Parma. This marked the turning point in the conflict, preventing Spanish dominance over the seas.|"['1.

In 1588, the Spanish Armada sailed north, facing losses as it passed the Orkneys, Hebrides, and Ireland. The Armada arrived in Spanish ports in a sorry state. The following year, the Lisbon Expedition failed due to disputes between Drake and Elizabeth I. The English fleet faced challenges with supplies despite defensive squadrons in the Narrow Seas. The expedition, led by Drake and Norreys, marked the first modern English fleet and army collaboration. The army and fleet were well-organized. Norreys achieved a victory at Corunna. A drummer was shot, leading to a swift trial and execution by the Spanish. The expedition then marched to Lisbon but failed due to logistical issues and losing communication between the fleet and army. Drake seized a Dutch and German fleet loaded with contraband before returning home with fewer men and resources. The expedition was considered a failure, leading to Drake's loss of favor.|"[""1.

In 1591, Sir Richard Grenville made history aboard Drake's old ship, the _Revenge_, in an epic battle against the Spanish fleet. Despite being outnumbered 53 to 1, Grenville refused to surrender, showing immense courage and determination. The battle lasted through the afternoon, evening, and into the night, with the _Revenge_ holding its own against multiple Spanish vessels. Lord Thomas Howard, outnumbered and low on supplies, had to make a tough decision to retreat to save his remaining ships. The bravery and resilience displayed by Grenville and his crew in the face of overwhelming odds have been immortalized in prose and verse by Raleigh and Tennyson. This battle remains a testament to the valor and fighting spirit of the English seafarers of that time.|['1.

Drake, once a hero, now faces disfavor at court. The Queen criticizes his costly fleets, diplomats speak of resolving complex issues, and courtiers debate peace or war. Amidst this, the common folk wonder about the sea's mysteries. Yet, Drake's feats pale against the vast empire England became post-Spanish conquests. The sea, a blend of land and water, is vital for global trade, diverse life, and natural beauty. It offers wealth, sustenance, and teaches lessons. Navigation tames this untamed beast, aiding commerce, battles, and exploration. The sea is a realm of action, meditation, and knowledge, nurturing Earth and its inhabitants. England, a realm unconquered, stands as a bastion against invasion. Drake and his ilk were conquerors and prospectors, not settlers. The age of colonization began after their time, with Virginia, New England, and New France emerging later. Drake and his sea-dogs were explorers, like Raleigh, seeking fortunes ashore but falling short of establishing lasting colonies.|"['1.

In 1584, Amadas and Barlow set sail to explore North Carolina for Sir Walter Raleigh. They discovered various harbors in the region, including Roanoke Island and Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds. Barlow vividly described the enticing scent of the summer land, which intrigued Bacon and Dryden. The royal charter granted Raleigh's colonists the same rights as English citizens. In 1585, Sir Richard Grenville escorted a colony to Roanoke, led by Ralph Lane, but they were unsuccessful and were taken back to England by Drake in 1586. Grenville later returned with supplies but found the colony gone. Unfortunately, conflicts with the natives arose due to harsh actions by the English. Thomas Cavendish, another adventurer, circumnavigated the globe and engaged in battles with the Spanish. Meanwhile, Raleigh continued his colonization efforts, establishing the City of Ralegh in Virginia in 1587. However, the city faced challenges, and the fate of the earlier colonists left by Grenville remained a mystery.|"['1.

After a month, Governor White returned home for more men and supplies, leaving most of the colonists at Roanoke. He found Elizabeth, Raleigh, and others working hard to meet the Great Armada. Despite the events of 1588, Raleigh managed to spare two pinnaces with fifteen colonists aboard, well-equipped with essentials. Unfortunately, a Spanish squadron forced the pinnaces to retreat. Two more years passed before White could sail back to Virginia. In August 1590, his trumpeter sounded familiar English calls as they approached the fort, but there was no response. The colony was lost forever. White had instructed the colonists to leave a mark if they moved, and the word CROATOAN was all that was found. The fate of the colonists remains a mystery, with only a wandering tradition surrounding the story of young Virginia Dare, the first native-born American.|"['1.

Between 1587 and 1602, there was a 15-year gap in English attempts to colonize America. In 1602, Bartholomew Gosnold led a group to Maine and Cape Cod, but disagreements and supply shortages led to the project's failure. In 1603, Martin Pring explored Massachusetts Bay for sassafras but did not attempt colonization. In 1605, George Weymouth explored Maine and returned with a positive report. These expeditions renewed interest in colonization, leading to the formation of the London and Plymouth Companies in 1606. The London Company aimed to settle between 34° and 41° latitude, while the Plymouth Company targeted 38° to 45° latitude. In 1607, George Popham's attempt to colonize North Virginia failed due to harsh conditions, leading to the project's abandonment.|"[""1.

In 1589, Drake faced disfavor due to his failed Lisbon Expedition, a critical misstep in a time when the navy was vital for revenue. Despite this setback, in 1595, England called on Drake and Hawkins to strike against Spain to aid France. The call to action came as France faced the League of French and Spanish Catholics, with Henry IV's conversion causing a united front against Spain. Drake and Hawkins, though an unhappy pairing, set sail with troops under Baskerville's command to intercept a Spanish treasure ship. The expedition, funded by Elizabeth, set sail for New Spain in August 1595. Drake's strategic decisions were crucial as they navigated challenges like the strong defenses at Las Palmas before pushing on to the West Indies.|"['1.

When Drake arrived in Porto Rico, the Spanish were prepared for his arrival. Despite surprising the garrison by boldly entering the harbor and dropping anchor near a hidden battery, the Spanish quickly retaliated. They accurately fired at Drake's flagship, causing chaos and casualties. Meanwhile, Hawkins, exhausted from his efforts, tragically passed away. The setbacks, along with the formidable defenses of Porto Rico, deeply affected Drake. He retreated, regrouped, and launched a fiery attack on the Spanish fleet. However, the Spanish responded fiercely, forcing Drake to retreat once more. Undeterred, Drake plundered La Hacha and other towns for treasure. As tensions rose, a larger Spanish fleet and obstacles in Panama threatened Drake's mission. Despite setbacks and illness, Drake navigated to Puerto Bello, where he passed away after a sudden outburst and peaceful end, leaving a legacy of bravery and adventure.|"['1.

In the sixteenth century, there was no clear distinction between naval and other types of ships. The sovereign had fighting vessels, which evolved into the Royal Navy in the seventeenth century. However, this modern system was challenging in England. The English monarch needed Parliament and public support to maintain a large army and navy. When not at war, the king used ships for trade or rented them to merchants. Privateers, specifically built for combat, were more successful than merchant ships converted for war. King Henry's first modern warships were inspired by an Italian merchant ship model. The galleon, a hybrid of galley and sailing ship, was developed as oceanic trade routes expanded. England excelled in naval architecture despite being behind in original ideas. The English navy became crucial for the country's global standing, much like the British Empire later on.|"['1.

During the Tudor era, England's naval architecture was evolving rapidly. Shipwrights like Fletcher of Rye, guided by Henry's vision and the people's instincts, worked tirelessly to improve sea vessels. Mistakes were common, but the need for superior sea power drove progress. The transition from oared galleys to sailing galleons marked a significant advancement. The galleon era, starting with Drake, revolutionized sailing tactics and shaped global history. The famous _Great Harry_, though lavishly decorated, was criticized for its impractical design. It was the last great English medieval ship, soon replaced by more efficient fleets. The galleon became the backbone of naval warfare, with broadside fire tactics proving effective against enemies. The evolution of English ships, from the galleon to modern battleships, reflects the constant innovation and adaptation in naval architecture.|"['1.

During the 16th century, advancements in naval technology were evident, particularly in the evolution of the pinnace, a precursor to modern frigates and cruisers. Originating from Norse long-boats, pinnaces transitioned from oar-propelled vessels to primarily sailing ships, capable of engaging larger Spanish galleons. Under Queen Elizabeth I, pinnaces were equipped with square sails and multiple guns, enhancing their combat capabilities. The era saw a shift from row-barges to larger sailing vessels, marking progress towards broadside-sailing-ship fleets. Innovations in naval gunnery, range-finding techniques, and weapon development were significant during this period, laying the foundation for modern naval warfare. The establishment of Woolwich Dockyard and advancements in navigation aids further contributed to maritime progress. The legacy of figures like Henry VIII, Elizabeth I, Shakespeare, Bacon, Raleigh, and Drake underscores their enduring impact on naval history.|['1.
