Mr. Farnum agreed to proceed with the plan, emphasizing the need to excite the public's interest to secure more funding for their boats.

They peered down what seemed to be a well, disproving the guide's claim about it being part of the secret passage. Everyone had a good laugh and found it amusing. As they were about to leave, Benson noticed a familiar figure approaching. Jack teased Hennessy about using ""American strategy"" to handle situations calmly."|['1.

Jack Benson shared with the entire group how Kamanako had been caught spying on the submarine's controls that very morning. Everyone was content to let the Japanese man deal with the consequences of his actions. Jack, the young captain, expressed his willingness to be tested, suspecting that the charming but dangerous spy was planning something. He was eager to discover her true intentions and which country she represented. As they prepared to leave, Mlle. Nadiboff spoke to her driver in a foreign language, and the car sped off. Jack noticed they were moving away from Spruce Beach but was more focused on unraveling Mlle. Nadiboff's strategy against his loyalty. He was not swayed by her attempts to charm him, knowing she might try to entice him with gifts.|"[""1.

Jack Benson was quick to pick up on the situation, thanks to Mr. Graham's guidance. He confronted Mlle. Nadiboff, a seasoned spy, who was attempting to manipulate him. Despite her years of experience, Mlle. Nadiboff found Jack to be more clever than expected. Realizing she couldn't outwit him, she decided to involve M. Lemaire, a renowned spy. As M. Lemaire arrived, the spies communicated in Arabic, a language Jack didn't understand. Jack, unfazed, demanded a clear explanation of the situation, showing his shrewdness and determination in the face of espionage.|"[""1.

Captain Jack Benson was direct and firm in his response to M. Lemaire, not beating around the bush. He expressed his skepticism, questioning the honesty or intelligence of M. Lemaire if he pretended not to understand. Dismissing Mlle. Nadiboff, who had left the conversation, Jack urged M. Lemaire to get to the point of his scheme. M. Lemaire hinted at paying Jack for certain drawings and papers, to which Jack cautiously agreed. Despite his urge to attack the Frenchman, Jack instead evaded and subdued the chauffeur. M. Lemaire proposed a payment of ten thousand dollars, emphasizing the secrecy of their deal. Jack reminded M.

The Frenchman quickly agreed to a deal with Captain Benson, offering him twenty thousand dollars for submarine plans in three days. M. Lemaire suggested that Benson should ride back with Mlle. Nadiboff, who welcomed his company. However, things took a dark turn when Mlle. Nadiboff suddenly threw sand at Benson's face, and Gaston and Lemaire restrained him. Lemaire warned Benson of the consequences of defying them and bound his ankles and gagged him. The submarine crew seemed unconcerned about what information Mlle.

At three o'clock, Eph agreed to take naval officers on a tour from the gunboat to showcase the 'Benson.' Eph waited for Jack, but he didn't show up. Mlle.

A lot of work went into building a hidden cave under a hill near the Florida coast, close to Cuba, where smuggled Havana cigars were stored. The cave was a safe spot for the smugglers until they were caught by customs officials. Jack Benson, a young submarine captain, found himself trapped in the cave, hungry and thirsty. He doubted anyone would come to his rescue, especially considering his captor, Lemaire's cruel nature. Suddenly, Gaston, the chauffeur, appeared with a lantern, surprising Jack. Despite his dire situation, Jack managed to crack a joke, relieved to see a friendly face after hours of yelling for help in vain.|"['1.

In complete silence, the driver moved forward, placing the lantern on the ground a few feet away from the boy. Sitting on the boards, the Frenchman took out a paper package from his pocket, catching Jack's keen interest as he untied it. It was clear the driver wasn't interested in eating or drinking but was tormenting the captive. Gaston strategically positioned the sandwiches and water out of Jack's reach. Angrily, Jack taunted the Frenchman, calling him a coward. Gaston warned Jack about his temper and demanded an answer to take to his master, M. Lemaire, threatening to leave Jack without food or water for another day if he didn't comply. Suddenly, Hal Hastings's voice echoed in the cave as he entered through the tunnel, ready to confront Gaston. Despite his efforts, Hal struggled against Gaston, leaving Jack defenseless. Gaston, now facing two opponents, boasted about his strength, but Hal's arrival changed the dynamics of the situation.|"[""Question 1: What did the driver do with the lantern?\nA) He threw it away\nB) He placed it on the boy's lap\nC) He placed it on the ground a few feet away from the boy\nD) He used it to hit Jack\nE) He handed it to Gaston"", 'Question 2: What did the Frenchman take out from his pocket?\nA) A knife\nB) A map\nC) A lantern\nD) A paper package\nE) A gun', ""Question 3: Why did Gaston position the sandwiches and water out of Jack's reach?\nA) To keep them safe from Jack\nB) To offer them to Jack later\nC) To torment Jack\nD) To eat them himself\nE) To share them with Hal"", ""Question 4: How did Jack react to Gaston's actions?\nA) He thanked Gaston\nB) He ignored Gaston\nC) He called Gaston a coward\nD) He laughed at Gaston\nE) He praised Gaston"", 'Question 5: Who entered the cave through the tunnel to confront Gaston?\nA) M.

Jack chose to cut across the grounds instead of taking the road to the hotel. As he hurried along, a fit young man emerged from behind a tree, blocking Jack's path. The Englishman, holding a heavy walking stick, demanded Jack to stop, mentioning the arrest of a young woman due to Jack's interference. Jack swiftly dodged the Englishman's blows, causing him to drop the stick twice. The Englishman revealed that the woman was a spy caught trying to steal submarine secrets. Another man, Mr. Trotter, arrived with a Secret Service badge, insisting the Englishman, Drummond, accompany them. Jack retrieved Drummond's cane and encountered Mlle. Nadiboff, who surprisingly greeted him warmly after her stroll.|"['1.

Mlle. Nadiboff sought a trustworthy friend to vouch for her and help explain or forget things. She implored Kamanako not to fail her, promising to send for him if needed. Kamanako, with his unwavering Japanese smile, acknowledged being accused of spying, restricting his movements at Spruce Beach. Jack Benson, aware of the Secret Service presence, pondered the possibility of more spies evading capture. Despite the danger, Jack remained fearless, attributing his courage to the constant perils he faces. The spies, now on the defensive, were expected to bide their time before making further moves. The atmosphere of danger had made Jack almost indifferent to fear, accepting peril as part of his daily life.|"['1. What did Mlle.

Jack waited ashore until 9:30 pm, hoping for news from the Secret Service agents or Uncle Sam's representatives. Hearing nothing, he headed to the beach. Hal joked about Jack standing watch on land and advised him to rest. Machinist Williamson took the midnight watch on deck. Despite the calm night, he sensed something odd. Two men on the shore hid a metal cylinder and a battery. Unseen, they swam towards the ship, towing the cylinder. Back on land, they connected the wire to the battery. Williamson, sensing trouble, investigated and found the suspicious cylinder. Acting fast, he disconnected it from the ship, averting a potential threat.|['1.

Ensign Foss decided to bring the cylinder aboard the ship 'Waverly' for investigation. The marines were to stay until further instructions from the commanding officer. Lieutenant Commander Kimball would arrive after the investigation. Captain Jack suggested finding the wire cut by Williamson to trace it back to its source. Lieutenant Foster nodded in agreement and ordered the boat to row slowly while the marines gathered the wire. They discovered a box imprint with a magneto battery meant to detonate a mine. Hal suggested it might be a joke, but Lieutenant Foster suspected foul play. As another cutter approached with Lieutenant Commander Kimball, they decided to return to the ship. Captain Jack advised Williamson to rest while keeping watch. The submarine was monitored by a cutter from the gunboat. Jack went back to sleep, waking up to the smell of coffee and bacon. He doubted the involvement of known spies in the incident.|"[""**1.

Jack, lost in thought, nodded in agreement as he ate his breakfast. He decided to inform Mr. Farnum and Mr. Pollard about the surprising news. Finding them at the Clayton, the two men were astonished by the night's events. Jack was still unsure about the spies at large, including M. Lemaire, Mlle. Nadiboff, and Kamanako. He contemplated visiting Gaston in jail to gather information. Upon reaching the jail, Jack shared the story with the keeper, who was shocked. Jack suspected Gaston's involvement due to his potential motives. Later, Jack met with Mr. Trotter, who considered the information a crucial lead. Soon, news arrived that suspects had been apprehended in a nearby town. The suspects were small men with a defiant demeanor and were found with a significant amount of money.|"['1.

Mr. Trotter whispered to Jack about the possibility of the two men talking later under pressure. The Secret Service men confirmed the identity of the men as Gaston's visitors from the day before and had them locked up. Leroux and Stephanoulis were surprised when captured. Jack overheard a conversation hinting at trouble ahead involving Mlle. Nadiboff. Mr. Farnum warned Jack to be cautious as the foreign spies might seek revenge, especially targeting him. The situation was escalating, and precaution was advised to stay safe amidst the unfolding events.|"['1.

Trotter explained that they were uncertain about the situation but knew that their actions were being closely watched.

Jack, after pondering the spy-related issues, shifted his focus to the beach crowds. Many people were enjoying the sun and sea, while others strolled along the sand or built sand structures. Despite the lively scene, some seemed bored and in need of excitement. Jack chuckled at the missed opportunity for excitement if the mine had detonated the night before. Feeling a bit drowsy from the afternoon air, he turned away from the beach. As he walked, he heard a sharp sound, possibly a shot. Hal suggested investigating, leading to a growing crowd. Jack discovered a hollow steel ferrule in the spy's walking stick, revealing a concealed weapon. The spy threatened Jack to secure his release, but Jack remained calm and collected, unfazed by the danger.|"[""1.

A doctor in the crowd ordered a lot of milk for two young men, Jack and Hal, who were struggling to breathe due to smoke inhalation. When they drank the milk as instructed, they felt their strength returning. After a while, they began to move around again, though they still felt weak.
