In the sixteenth century, the _Water Wagtail_ crew embarked from Bristol on a perilous voyage. Paul Burns, a brave and educated hero, led the crew, while the devoted Oliver Trench followed him faithfully. Despite the crew's shady characters, they set sail for Norway. Facing storms and damages, they braved the Atlantic's fury. The crew, including burglars and pickpockets, struggled to survive the relentless squalls.

One evening, Paul sat at the cabin table and put his hand on his friend's arm, urging him to let him lock up a bottle. Paul was concerned that his friend, who was at the helm, had been drinking too much to navigate the ship safely. Despite the man's half-offended expression, Paul was determined to act. He grabbed the bottle and tossed it into the sea, surprising everyone around. The skipper, affected by the alcohol, initially reacted with astonishment but then softened as Paul approached him with a smile. The crew, facing tough conditions, began to discuss changing course towards Newfoundland for a better life. Swinton, suggesting a new direction, faced opposition but remained confident.

A serious conversation followed, deciding to sail to Newfoundland instead of Norway. Big Swinton suggested it to the captain but was rebuked. That night, he and a group captured the captain, his son, and Paul Burns. The officers were also taken. Swinton offered the captain a choice to navigate to Newfoundland or be thrown overboard. Grummidge secretly freed them, and chaos ensued as a squall hit. The ship broke apart on rocks near an island. The crew faced the danger bravely or with fear. Some were defiant, others begged for mercy, and a few remained composed. The incident revealed the crew's true characters.|"['1.

Oliver watched his friend Paul leap into the water, heading towards the shore strewn with boulders. Paul signaled to Oliver using a line, instructing him to pay out or haul him in. Oliver, with guidance from his father, managed the line with care. When he felt two pulls, he hesitated, but his father advised waiting. Eventually, three strong pulls came, indicating Paul was ready. Oliver secured the line to the ship, and Paul helped him reach the shore safely. On the island, they found shelter, wood, and water but no food. With their provisions lost, they faced the daunting prospect of starvation.|"['1.

"""My friends,"" he said, ""instead of chattering, why not spread out along the shore and salvage what you can from the wreck?

Paul enthusiastically agreed, suggesting that the laws should be referred to as the laws of God. He then revealed to Master Trench that he possessed some of these laws in a book. Master Trench, acknowledging the truth, watched as Paul took out a fragment of the Gospel of John from his breast-pocket. The skipper, handling the manuscript with reverence, expressed his admiration for Wycliffe and his translation work. Paul shared that his mother, deeply knowledgeable in Scriptures, was taught by her father, who had been converted by a missionary trained by Wycliffe. This missionary had preached a sermon that transformed Paul's grandfather, leaving a portion of the New Testament in English as a legacy. Through interactions with the Hutchins family, Paul's mother became well-versed in the Bible, passing down this knowledge to Paul. Paul recounted how the Hutchins' son, William, a talented linguist, had also influenced his learning.|"['1.

Olly expressed his good wishes to the Hutchins' family for being able to read despite the scarcity of manuscripts. Paul explained that Lucy Wentworth, who taught Olly to read, had never mentioned the name Hutchins. Paul revealed that Hutchins' real name was Tyndale, and Lucy Wentworth had lived with the Tyndale family before. Paul prophesized that William Tyndale would leave a lasting impact on the generation. Little did they know that William Tyndale would translate the Bible into English. Paul shared a promise from the Gospel of John about truth setting one free. The crew members explored the land and found wreckage and two native lads. The crew prepared breakfast and discussed their findings, including a boat that needed minor repairs to sail again.|"[""1.

"""To be honest,"" he said to Little Stubbs, whom he met while searching on the shore, ""before we found this fishing gear, I had no hope of surviving here. But now, with God's blessing, we can manage until we plan our escape."" The crew turned to Paul Burns for guidance after the incident with the Indians. Some, like Swinton and Blazer, disagreed and plotted against them. Master Trench, Paul, Oliver, and others set off in the boat to fish. Oliver, in his excitement, caught a huge cod, followed by Squill's catch. The boat was filled with fish, leading to a night of feasting. However, disagreements arose over boat usage, causing tensions. Trench and Paul stayed behind to help split fish and set up camp.

Swinton and his group resorted to secret planning to get rid of their envied rivals. Circumstances favored them when they had to cut trees on the other side of the island. Swinton devised a revenge plan with his trusted friends. In the dark of night, they returned to the camp. They subdued the sleeping men without harming them. The captives were taken across the channel to a rocky beach. Despite attempts to reason with Swinton, he remained silent, leaving the captives under the noisy cliffs. Newfoundland, a vast island, was later discovered to be larger than initially thought. Swinton's cruel plan was executed successfully, leaving the captives stranded on the rocky shore.|"['1.

Master Trench was outraged at the thought of being abandoned without food and tied up. Swinton reassured him that there was food around if they searched. As they headed towards the boat, poor Oliver, fearing separation from his father, fought fiercely but was eventually subdued. When the sailors were ready to leave, Garnet, holding Oliver, threw a bag of food at Master Trench's feet. Oliver, noticing an axe nearby, seized it and freed Trench. As the sailors rowed away, Trench questioned how God could be a refuge in their dire situation.

Paul and Olly, along with Captain Trench, found themselves stranded on a remote part of the Newfoundland coast. The towering cliffs made it challenging to find a safe place to camp for the night. After much wandering, they discovered a gap in the cliffs where they could set up camp. Paul and Olly searched the canvas bag they had and found some raw pork and flour cakes. They managed to start a fire using dry grass and twigs. As they cooked the pork, they took stock of their possessions, which included knives, tools, fishing hooks, and some personal items.

The captain and his companions were exploring the woods when they spotted animals and birds. Paul mentioned his skill with the long-bow and the captain's expertise with the cross-bow. They decided to arm themselves before starting their journey to secure provisions. They found suitable wood for making bows and set up a camp with a shelter made of poles, bark, turf, and leaves. They were preparing for their adventure in the new country, leaving behind their shipmates, who had sent them away. The captain was determined to explore the land and find supplies, while Paul and Oliver were enthusiastic about the journey ahead, eager to do what was right and wise.|['1.

The task they had started was much harder than they thought. Paul used to make bows and arrows, but now he had to find the right tree and shape it himself. Making arrows and cross-bow bolts was also a challenge. Despite the difficulties, the group showed determination and persistence. However, they were slower than expected, and nightfall interrupted their work. The shelter they built was small, with walls and a roof made of branches and leaves. During dinner, the captain teased Oliver for not making enough room for everyone. As they slept, the captain's habit of bouncing in his sleep caused their shelter to collapse. Startled awake, they mistook the commotion for an attack until they realized it was just their collapsed shelter. Laughter followed, but a real threat emerged when the fire caught on the fallen structure.|"['1.

Paul held the unfinished bows and arrows tightly as they escaped the fire, losing only their shelter. They rested under a nearby tree, dreaming of home.

The captain missed his shot, Oliver's stone hit a tree, and Paul's arrow missed a bird. A rabbit appeared, and they swiftly took it down.

Oliver and his companions had reached a plateau after a brisk walk along the rocky shore. They discovered a small stream, known as a creek in America and a burn in Scotland, flowing northeast with cascades. Excited, Oliver prepared to fish. At a clear pool, he saw large fish and quickly rigged his line with a feather as bait. Without a rod, he cast the hook across the pool. The fish, unalarmed, eagerly took the bait. As Oliver reeled it in, the fish put up a fight. Finally, he landed a hefty trout, but the steep bank made it hard to lift the fish out. In a rush, Oliver grabbed the fish by the gills, causing him to lose balance and fall into the pool with a yelp.|"['1.

Captain Trench and his companions ventured into the heart of a beautiful land. They navigated through dense forests, tracked deer, and followed a small compass westward. As they trekked, they subsisted on fish and game, struggling with their poor shooting skills. Realizing the importance of hunting, they committed to improving their aim.

Long ago, Hendrick lived in isolation until the white race discovered his island. He was surprised to hear of Columbus and Cabot's discoveries, having had no contact with the outside world for twenty years. Hendrick shared tales from his father about the Norsemen's discovery of Vinland, which he believed predated Columbus. As Hendrick guided his new friends through the beautiful land, they learned about the abundance of wildlife and the favorable climate. Captain Trench was amazed by the island's beauty, contrasting it with the misconceptions spread about its barrenness. Hendrick emphasized the importance of gaining knowledge through experience rather than forming opinions based on hearsay.

The captain's hopes were dashed when the history of Newfoundland revealed that the island's potential was initially misunderstood. The focus on its cod-fishing banks led to neglect of its interior. Selfish monopolists misrepresented the island, leading to repressive laws that hindered colonization. Prejudice and error perpetuated the neglect of the land until recent times. During a hunting expedition, Oliver Trench learned a valuable lesson when he shot at deer out of range. His father, with wisdom, taught him the importance of experience in learning. A sudden encounter with a black bear tested their skills. After a fierce battle, the bear was defeated, highlighting the advantages of ancient arrows over modern bullets. The group continued their hunting and fishing adventures, with Oliver's excitement needing occasional restraint to prevent overstocking their supplies. The tale of Trueheart, a native girl with a mysterious past, added intrigue to their wilderness exploration.|"[""1.

The land the explorers found was abundant with wildlife, providing them with deer, otter, martens, musk-rats, willow-grouse, and rabbits for food. In autumn, they froze meat and fish to keep it fresh until spring when wildfowl returned. Skins and furs from these creatures offered ample clothing. The explorers pondered why the land was so bountiful yet underutilized by man. Paul believed that man's failure to populate and cultivate the Earth as instructed by God and common sense led to unnecessary conflicts and struggles. Despite modern advancements, vast fertile lands remained uninhabited. As they discussed these matters, they decided to rest in Hendrick's camp before continuing their journey inland.

The hunter expressed his concern about the unnecessary killing of animals and warned about the consequences of future food scarcity. This fear was proven true in many places where reckless hunting in the past led to food shortages or extinction. Newfoundland in the early 16th century faced misfortunes one after another, with a severe storm hitting the explorers as they prepared to return. The storm uprooted trees, creating chaos and danger. The travelers sought shelter under a tree, narrowly avoiding disaster as branches fell around them. They eventually cleared a space, creating a hut with the fallen tree as a shelter. Despite the storm's fury, they found comfort and even managed to cook venison, turning their situation from discomfort to cheer. Hendrick then demonstrated how to walk in snowshoes, emphasizing balance and stride.|"['1.

The journey began with a comical mishap as the travelers struggled to navigate the thawing snow. Despite the challenges, they found joy in the adventure, documenting their observations of the land's potential mineral wealth. Paul's optimism about the island's resources clashed with Captain Trench's seasoned skepticism, hinting at the complexities of development. As they continued their trek, encountering wildlife and navigating various terrains, they faced the harsh realities of survival in the wilderness. Meanwhile, back on the island, tensions rose among the crew of the _Water Wagtail_ as they grappled with the betrayal of their shipmates.

Jim Heron disagreed with the idea of violent actions, while George Blazer objected to such extreme measures. Backed by the majority, the crew rejected the proposal. Grummidge expressed concerns about Swinton's behavior, suggesting that he would exile crew members he disliked. To address this, Grummidge proposed confronting Swinton and making him captain in exchange for ending the conflict. The crew agreed to follow Grummidge's leadership to restore order. Grummidge then confronted Swinton, informing him that he would no longer be in charge and would assist in finding the crew members Swinton had betrayed. Despite Swinton's resistance, Grummidge swiftly subdued him, ensuring compliance.

The exploration group did not find the people they were looking for, but they discovered the true nature of the main island. They realized it was not a group of smaller islands as they had previously thought. After giving up on the search, they decided to explore the coast for a new place to stay. Grummidge suggested they prepare for winter by finding shelter and stocking up on food to avoid freezing and starving. The party found a beautiful bay with lush forests and islets. Blazer even managed to catch a great auk, a bird now extinct, using stones as weapons. They decided to hunt more auks for food and eggs, excited about their success and the prospect of settling in a pleasant location for the winter. They quickly set up camp on the main island, protected from the cold winds, and built log huts for shelter.|['1.

When the small settlement was established and the goods were removed from Wreck Island, they resumed fishing near the shore for codfish. Some in the group preferred hunting the great auk or exploring the forests. Squill, while searching for shellfish, stumbled upon a creature that left him breathless with excitement. He rushed back to camp to share his discovery. It was a colossal cuttlefish, measuring an astonishing fifty-two feet from arm to arm. The creature's arms were adorned with countless suckers, and its beak resembled that of a parrot. The next day, Squill and Stubbs encountered a living giant cuttlefish while rowing towards a fishing spot. When the boat collided with the creature, chaos ensued as it latched onto the boat with its immense arms. Stubbs, with quick thinking, managed to sever the limbs, freeing the boat from the monster's grip, saving the crew from a perilous embrace.|"['1.

"In the story, a crew of shipwrecked men discovered a giant cuttlefish, known as a devil-fish or squid. The creature had two arms, one long and thin, about 19 feet in length, and the other shorter, measuring 11 feet. The longer arm had about 200 suckers, while the shorter arm had a double row of suckers. The total length of the creature was estimated to be around 30 feet. The crew, living in Wagtail Bay, Newfoundland, spent their days fishing, hunting, and building shelters. As time passed, tensions arose among the crew, dividing them into industrious and idle groups. The leader, Grummidge, faced the challenge of maintaining order and harmony within the camp as the days grew shorter and the nights longer.

"""Come, come, Dick Swan and Bob Crow,"" called out Grummidge sternly, ""Enough of that. We can't have two liars causing trouble on this ship. One liar is already one too many. If you can't speak politely, we'll have to throw you overboard.""

""That's exactly what I'll do,"" Grummidge continued, striding towards Swan, grabbing him by the collar, and tossing him to the other side of the room. Swan lay still, seemingly thinking he had had enough. ""My job is to maintain order, and I intend to do just that. Agreed, boys?""

Everyone expected Big Swinton to step up, but he didn't. His revenge wasn't about mere disobedience. Instead, someone unexpected, Spitfire, a self-willed and ill-natured fellow, stood up to Grummidge, defying him. The crowd thought Spitfire would meet the same fate as Swan, but they were mistaken. They didn't yet grasp Grummidge's ways.

""My objection,"" Spitfire spoke up, ""is that when you were made captain, there was no vote. You were put in charge by your own friends, and that's not fair. I won't submit to you. You can knock me down if you want, for I'm no match for you, but that won't make wrong right.""

The plan to catch seals using a net was a success. Stubbs suggested making a net from the cordage on the ship, and the crew quickly gathered to help. They made a strong net and set it in the water. When they checked later, they found six fat seals caught in the net. This provided them with meat and oil for cooking. The crew was thrilled with their success and eagerly awaited the next catch. This event marked the beginning of their seal hunting industry. While it may seem small compared to modern sealing operations, it was a significant start. Swinton, a crew member, even managed to catch a seal using a club. The crew's resourcefulness and hard work paid off, ensuring their survival on the island.|"[""1.

"While thinking about his next move, Swinton noticed two seals resting on a patch of ice, one behind a mound. He observed a safe route to approach without alerting them. Swinton crafted a club and cautiously made his way towards the seals. As he got closer, he realized they were larger than he thought, likely a male and a female. Ignorant of seal behavior, he targeted the female, aiming for the nose. However, the male, a fierce ""dog-hood"" seal, inflated its hood in defense. Swinton's arrows were futile, so he relied on his club. A fierce battle ensued, with Swinton using all his strength to combat the enraged seal. Just as the situation seemed dire, Grummidge appeared on the scene, rushing to assist Swinton in the intense struggle against the formidable seal."|['1.

The fight was short-lived. The seal easily tossed the man aside and was about to attack when it spotted Grummidge. The seal reared up to face this new threat. Grummidge, a poor stabber, missed his mark and hit the seal's hood, causing it to collapse. As Grummidge tried to help Swinton, who lay injured, he realized the severity of the situation. Swinton confessed his past wrongdoings, seeking forgiveness. Grummidge, despite their history, acknowledged Swinton's plea. Carrying Swinton on his shoulders, Grummidge embarked on a challenging journey back home. After a long struggle, they finally reached the settlement.

Nature was peaceful and beautiful, driven by the power of love among its inhabitants. The arrival of Paul Burns with the Gospel of John had intensified and purified this love. Paul and Hendrick, naturally sympathetic, grew closer as they shared moments in the forest, by the campfire, and while paddling on the lake. During one evening canoe ride back from a hunt, Hendrick opened up about his wife's Bethuck tribe, revealing their peaceful nature contrasted with the violent raids by the natives of Labrador. Hendrick expressed hope that the Gospel would bring peace to their land, emphasizing the importance of love and unity to end conflict and strife."|"[""1.

"""And will exist until the reign of Jesus extends to every human heart,"" replied Paul. ""It seems to me that what we have some right and ground to expect is, not the stoppage of _all_ war, but the abolition of war between nations calling themselves Christian.""

Soon after this discussion, an event occurred that led both Paul and Hendrick to prepare for battle. It was clear to them that engaging in war was now their duty. As the tall figure emerged from the darkness into the circle of firelight, Trueheart recognized him as a friend. The stranger, an Indian, accepted all attention with solemnity, showing his gratitude with a quiet grunt.

The Indian, known for his reticence, sat calmly and consumed his meal slowly. The hunter shared that Trueheart and Goodred were called the singing-birds due to their sweet voices. The Indian, moved by their harmonious singing, shared that he had no news to tell but was glad to have his heart thrilled. Hendrick joked about the Indian's wolf spirit being subdued after a satisfying meal, to which the Indian's serious response indicated that he had no news to share."|"['1.

The group was in a rush to rescue captives taken by a war party. Paul and his friends, with two boys among them, set off at dawn. The frost helped them move swiftly. They were determined and rested little. Captain Trench admired the view and mentioned that health, strength, and appetite are key to happiness. Oliver and Oscar shared a light moment, finding joy in their innocence. The next day, the thaw began, making the land moist, but progress wasn't hindered much. They were concerned that continued thawing could make the low grounds impassable. The abrupt changes in temperature made the journey challenging, but the beauty of the landscape under the rising sun was a sight to behold.|"['1.

"When rain falls in cold weather, it freezes upon touching the ground, creating a layer of ice on branches and twigs. The ice can build up to half an inch or more, transforming the trees into a glittering spectacle. The sun shining through the ice adds to the magical scene. This phenomenon, known as a ""silver thaw,"" delighted the rescue party as they prepared to continue their journey. The frost hardened the ground and lifted their spirits, while the aurora borealis illuminated the night sky. The party's rest was disturbed by the cracking of ice-laden tree limbs. As they resumed their journey, the group encountered armed men, leading to a tense standoff until a dog's friendly gesture diffused the situation.

When Little Beaver and Rising Sun ventured along the shores of the vast salt lake, they embarked on a journey that led to tragedy. Little Beaver was found dead, his body bruised and bones broken. Nearby, a group of white settlers had set up camp, and it was evident they were responsible for the murder. The tribe, enraged by this injustice, sought retribution. Meanwhile, Hendrick, a visitor, sought the chief's help to locate prisoners from a shipwreck. Paul Burns, intrigued by the land's beauty, pondered on the potential of the country. As they journeyed, they encountered a village of cone-like tents where the prisoners were held. The guide confirmed the sailors were alive but under a death sentence.

"""I know some men from this tribe,"" he said, ""but not all of them, although they all know me by reputation. You can rely on my support for your friends. Let's go down.""

When the hunter revealed himself, the hostile expressions vanished. Bearpaw, the chief, insisted that the men must die for mistreating his braves and killing Little Beaver. Hendrick argued that his friends treated the braves well and were not involved in the killing. The group arrived at a cliff with what seemed to be a cave entrance, guarded by two Indians.

Squill groaned about the harsh conditions they faced, barely having strength left. The young Indian overheard this conversation and led his party to the captives.

The captain's actions after his son's suggestion are unclear. He spent the day in a disturbed state, visiting the prisoners and arguing with Paul and Hendrick. The chief summoned Hendrick and Paul to explain their words on forgiveness and the Great Spirit. The discussion led both sides into deep contemplation, forgetting the captives' fate momentarily. The chief remained firm in his decision, emphasizing retributive justice. Meanwhile, an Indian woman in the wilderness, seemingly young but worn, sat in a trance-like state, singing a mournful song. Her sudden burst into laughter indicated insanity. She then ate a bird raw and struggled with her tattered clothing.

Unaware of her arrival, the grieving mother sat embroidering. Tender hands smoothed her hair, pressing her cheek to a warm heart. The girl's rest was undisturbed, her cheek growing cold.
