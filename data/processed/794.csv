However, we soon realized that getting used to comforts can make them seem ordinary. Father explained that this feeling is known as the deceitfulness of riches.

When the clock struck 12:27, the train arrived, bringing Denis and his sisters to our home after a long absence. Excitement filled the air as we eagerly awaited their arrival. However, upon meeting their stern aunt, who was dressed in black with beady accessories, our enthusiasm waned. She questioned us sharply, making us feel unkempt after a day of play. The awkwardness continued at home, with strained conversations and forced politeness. Despite our efforts to entertain them with books and toys, the visit felt strained and uncomfortable. Only during a game of ‘Letters’ with Father did the atmosphere lighten slightly. As the day drew to a close, we were relieved when bedtime finally arrived, bringing an end to the awkwardness that had filled the day.|"['1.

When bedtime arrived, the children gathered in the girls' room for a secret meeting. Oswald, the eldest, declared that the next day must be different from the last. He proposed a sudden and decisive plan to shake things up. Inspired by the Jungle Book, Oswald decided to create a jungle adventure in the shrubbery. The white mice were sent away, and the children began transforming the garden into a jungle setting. They used pillows and animal skins to create a wild atmosphere. Pincher, the family dog, was colored with slate pencil and creme d'amande to resemble a jungle creature. Denny, Oswald's assistant, helped with the preparations. Despite a mishap with a stuffed fox, the children were excited about their upcoming adventure.|"['1.

Oswald opened the glass case in the hall and took out the stuffed fox with a green and grey duck in its mouth. Seeing how lifelike they looked on the lawn, everyone hurried to bring out more stuffed animals. Uncle had a vast collection, most of which he had shot himself, except for the fox. They also used a fox mask to create a peeping effect. Stuffed birds were hung on trees, and a duck-bill creature sat with an otter. Dicky came up with the idea of creating a waterfall using a hose on a cedar tree branch, but it ended up messy. They covered the steps with raincoats to channel the water, making the scene glorious. They added pink tails to rabbits and sashes to guinea pigs. Beer-stands were used as legs for the tigers, giving them a realistic touch.|['1.

Once, a group of boys and girls decided to play near a waterfall. The boys wore only their bathing drawers and vests to avoid ruining their clothes, while the girls tucked up their frocks and removed their shoes and stockings. H. O. even painted himself brown to become Mowgli, a character from a book. When Oswald claimed he would be Mowgli instead, a playful argument ensued. Eventually, everyone painted themselves brown. As they prepared to act out scenes from the book, chaos erupted when some children began messing about with toy tigers. In the midst of the commotion, a girl named Daisy joined them, unknowingly adding to the chaos. Unfortunately, the playful day took a scary turn when Daisy suddenly fell ill, turning a frightening shade of green. The children tried their best to help her before hearing an unexpected sound at the front gate.|['1.

We were in a bit of a mess, soaked through and through with no clothes to speak of. Daisy was out cold, and the stuffed animals stared at us while the uncle held a cane. Oswald and H.O. got the worst of it. The other boys were safe under the tigers, and the uncle spared the girls. We got bread and water for three days in our rooms. We tried to make the best of it, even thought about taming a mouse. But we knew we had to be good. We were sent to the country to stay with Albert’s uncle, who was writing a book. The Moat House was where we ended up. It's an old manor with a moat, a secret staircase, and a rickety bridge. The house has a unique layout, right next to a churchyard and a fruit garden at the back.|['1.

The man who owned the house loved new homes. He built a large one with gardens and a stable. He left the Moat House, and Albert's uncle moved in. My father visited on weekends, and Albert's uncle lived with us full-time, writing a book. We were not to disturb him, but he would watch over us. We arrived late but saw the big bell atop the house. H.O. pulled the bell's rope, causing a stir in the village. Father scolded us, but we explored the house. The breakfast room was like a story, with oak panels and locked china cupboards. After breakfast, Father and Albert's uncle left for town. We promised not to misbehave. We waved goodbye and explored the house, finding a hayloft where a head popped up, startling us momentarily.|"['1.

When the head had explained more and left, we operated the chaff-cutting machine without any mishaps, despite the warning that touching it would result in losing fingers. Sitting on the dirty but interesting floor, we contemplated our misdeeds while confined with bread and water. Determined to turn over a new leaf, we, Dora and Alice Bastable, along with Daisy, envisioned starting a society focused on nobility, goodness, and selfless acts. The aim was to rise above temptations and extend kindness to all, regardless of status. Oswald, though indifferent, kept his thoughts to himself out of courtesy. The girls and Denny embraced the idea, brainstorming names like the Society for Humane Improvement or the Society for Reformed Outcast Children. Ultimately, they settled on the latter, and everyone eagerly set out to draft rules and compose poetry for the society's minute book.|"['1.

"Dicky declared, ""I'm not the same anymore."" He suggested they find useful tasks like fixing or cleaning, not just showing off. Tea was quiet, and Oswald played draughts while the others seemed bored. Albert's uncle noticed their gloominess and asked what was wrong. Oswald thought of blaming the Wouldbegoods Society but stayed silent. The next morning, Oswald woke up early, feeling regretful about the Society's mischief. He decided to start the day positively by playfully tossing a boot at Denny. The night before, Oswald had secretly polished a candlestick, which the servants cleaned again. Oswald then retreated to his study, warning everyone not to disturb him until 1.30 pm. Later, he proudly fixed the dairy window that wouldn't open."|"['1.

Dicky expressed his frustration over a mishap with a milk-pan that fell into the moat. Despite trying to retrieve it with a sheet, they faced challenges. The group decided to continue their efforts by the orchard. They sought permission to pick gooseberries, and after a failed attempt to use the sheet to retrieve the milk-pan, they ended up tearing it.

Let's build a raft! We found an old door in the stable and some tubs on the fence. With tools, we made holes in the tubs and tied them to the door's corners. It took a while. We launched the raft in the afternoon. Oswald towed it back when it floated too far. We were careful not to overload it. Only four of us could board. Some were afraid, but we set sail. The raft was named the Richard after Dicky. We used hop-poles to steer. The girls held on to stay steady. As we glided, we hit a barn wall, causing a splash. We laughed and said we'd need dry clothes for tea.|['1.

We bravely continued our journey until our boat reached the port beneath the dairy window. There stood the milk-pan we had endured so much to find. The girls, without waiting for orders, reached out eagerly, causing the raft to capsize. As we fell into the dark waters, the ship seemed to stand upright like a house roof. While Oswald and Dicky could swim, the girls needed help. Dora, screaming in fright, stepped on a jagged meat-tin, causing cuts and blood. Oswald assisted her to safety on a brick ledge. As we pondered how to retrieve the raft, a boat emerged, rescuing us. Dora, injured but in good spirits, hoped to be a blessing during her recovery.

Relaxing a bit, some lit pipes while others sat on the grassy roadside. The officer approached the children, showing them the gun's workings and ammunition boxes.

Her name was Mrs. Simpkins, and she lived in a cottage beyond the churchyard, opposite our house. Whenever there were military events, Mrs. Simpkins would stand at her garden gate and watch. After the soldiers left, she would wipe her eyes with her apron. Alice noticed this gesture. We believed Mrs. Simpkins liked soldiers, so we tried to talk to her, but she shooed us away. Oswald, being polite, made us leave her alone. However, we were curious about her behavior. We discovered that Mrs. Simpkins cried because her only son, who was twenty-two, had gone to war in April. She cried when she saw soldiers because she feared for her son's safety. We decided to visit her cottage early in the morning to help with gardening. The cottage had a charming thatched roof, resembling drawings from girls' schools.|"['1.

We admired the garden, noticing its neatness except for one patch overrun with weeds. Determined, we grabbed our tools and worked diligently to clear the area, revealing the clean brown dirt beneath. Despite the hard work, we felt joy in our unselfish efforts. Suddenly, the soldier's widowed mother burst out of the cottage, her eyes fierce. She accused us of ruining her turnips and cabbages sown by her son before he left. Although upset, we left peacefully. Later, while sorting through letters, we found a postcard stuck in a magazine addressed to Mrs. Simpkins. Respectfully, we only glanced at the address, following the rules of honor. The soldier's mother, after reading the postcard, showed a mix of emotions, leaving us with a somber feeling as we walked away.|"['1.

Alice and the other girls were sad about the soldier's mother's grief. They wanted to do something to honor her son, who had been shot. Noel suggested a heartfelt idea - to put up a memorial in their garden for him. They decided to make a wooden sign with his name and decorated it with white flowers. The soldier's mother was deeply touched and cried tears of gratitude. She visited the memorial daily and appreciated the girls' kind gesture. One day, a wounded soldier in a red coat arrived, and the mother rushed out joyfully to greet him. Her face lit up with happiness, showing how much the gesture meant to her.

The note was a mistake; he was only missing. There was a pipe and a whole pound of tobacco left from our keepsake to the other soldiers. We gave it to Bill. Father plans to employ him as an under-gardener once his wounds heal. He'll always be slightly lame, so he can't fight anymore. It was tough on Dora with her foot injured, but we took turns staying with her, and she was very understanding. Daisy was mostly with her. I don't dislike Daisy, but I wish she had been taught how to play. Because Dora is naturally like that, and sometimes I've thought that Daisy worsens it. Oswald made sure she had the right books to read, and he was pleased when she woke up early to finish Monte Cristo.

In a tale about mischievous deeds, I won't recount specific incidents of wrongdoing. One day, Noel tumbled down the kitchen chimney, bringing bricks, soot, and a starling's nest. H. O. found trouble in the dairy, locked in by Mrs. Pettigrew for a milk mishap. Oswald, the eldest, set a prank that backfired on Mrs. Pettigrew. The girls and white mice were not boldly wicked but borrowed needles, irking Mrs. Pettigrew. A pillow-fight ensued one morning, leading to a long walk. Oswald delayed, creating a prank for Dicky, sparking the pillow-fight. Dora and Daisy, unable to join, observed from afar. Oswald, H.

During a lively battle, Mrs. Pettigrew intervened by snatching away the pillows and scolding the children. Despite her rough manner, she also used some unexpected language. She urged the children to go for a walk and offered them a snack as compensation for missing dinner.

We explored the tower, where the bellropes hang with furry handles like caterpillars. The bells were big and dusty, surrounded by dirty beams and windows with no glass. Climbing up the narrow, dark stairs, we reached the top of the tower. The flat roof had names carved on it, a turret, and low walls like castle battlements. From there, we saw the church roof, the farm, and the village. We noticed cornfields, meadows, pastures, and trees that looked like the map of the United States. In the distance, a tower stood on a hill. We rested in a meadow by a stream, eating a snack and drinking water from the brook.

The man assured the girl that the hidden area behind a stone slab was safe during daylight, despite tramps occasionally sleeping there.

Oswald and his siblings found themselves in a tricky situation after a man tricked them into revealing their pocket contents.

A new rule was set: no walks off the high-roads, and Pincher had to come with either Lady or Martha. Despite disliking rules, this one was fine.

In the garden, Oswald felt like a hero facing opposing forces. He was upset because Noel took the ball after eating a coconut. Martha, a stout dog, accidentally knocked the ball out of Oswald's hands. This led to a scuffle where Noel ended up on the ground. Feeling annoyed, Oswald decided to investigate secretly. He climbed up to the attic through a trap-door, finding himself in a mysterious space between the ceiling and the roof. Walking along a narrow passage, he reached a door opening to the rooftop.

Oswald spent the entire afternoon by the river, engrossed in Percy’s Anecdotes about lawyers and munching on apples. While reading, he absentmindedly played with a cricket ball that eventually rolled away. The next day, they set out early for the river, stopping at the ‘Rose and Crown’ for ginger-beer. The landlady, busy preparing for a fishing competition, explained the event where anglers catch fish to win a prize and then dine at her inn.

We often walked along the river and became acquainted with the bargees, who are the captains and crews of the large barges towed by horses on the river. The horses walk on the towing-path with a rope tied to them, pulling the barge along. The bargees we knew were kind and allowed us to explore the barges when they were in a good mood. One day, we decided to play a kind prank by opening the lock to flood the pen where the barge was parked. Inspired by the idea of being heroes, we found crowbars to open the lock.

The water rushed through the sluices, cutting through like a knife, creating a green and solid flow. It cascaded down in a magnificent waterfall over the stones, forming a white foam that spread like a moving counterpane. After finishing the lock and the weir, which involved wheels and chains, we marveled at the beauty of nature. The bargees would surely be grateful when they found their barge free from being stuck. Despite the impending rain, we knew our noble actions were their reward. As the rain poured down, leaking through the ceiling, we sprang into action, moving beds and placing basins to catch the water. Oswald, always resourceful, devised a clever solution to redirect the water flow. Despite the chaos, we worked together tirelessly, knowing that Mrs. Pettigrew might need to be called for help.|"[""1.

Denny shared a story about fixing a leak in a cottage roof. By making holes in the ceiling, the water only came through the holes, which they caught with pails. They worked hard to prevent the water from flooding the floor. Oswald discovered a cricket ball blocking a gutter pipe that caused the leak. Despite knowing the truth, Oswald stayed silent as the workers investigated. Later, it was revealed that someone had maliciously drained the pen used for angling, ruining the anglers' day and causing a barge with coal to capsize. Oswald regretted his role in the incident and learned a valuable lesson about honesty and taking responsibility for his actions.|"['1.

Alice revised the record of the incident more positively after scratching out Dicky's initial version. They decided to perform noble acts and document them in the Golden Deed book. Dicky pointed out that using Father's ink for the tea wouldn't be their noble act. Each member suggested ideas for noble deeds. Albert’s uncle suggested a play to keep them occupied while Daisy proposed staying out of the way during a crucial decision. However, the animal race game idea didn't excite them due to the lack of a worthwhile prize. The group enjoyed ratting in the barn, especially Pincher, but the girls ended up in tears over the rats, showing their compassionate nature.

The forts, Pincher, and the girls crying passed the time pleasantly until dinner. Roast mutton with onion sauce and a roly-poly pudding were served. Initially, the jam roly-poly brought a sense of calm, but soon Oswald was ready for more. Daisy pondered the animal race, munching on grass. I explained that a tortoise and a peacock were needed for fun. Never before had we had such a lively array of animals. Dora suggested teaching the animals for a circus. She planned a circus lineup: a bull for bull-fighting, a horse, a goat for daring feats, a donkey for see-saw, white pigs, turkeys for applause sounds, dogs for various roles, a large black pig as an elephant, calves as camels, and a paddock by the orchard was chosen as the venue.

We gathered the animals in the order listed by Denny, starting with the black bull who lived in his own field away from the cowhouse. Oswald and Alice led the bull with a halter and a whip to guide him gently. Oswald even joked about riding the bull like in a bull-fight. When the bull didn't respond, Oswald flicked him with the whip, making the bull pay attention with a loud roar. Meanwhile, old Clover the cart-horse was content grazing, so she became the Elephant in our circus. The pig took on the role of Learned, the calves joined in easily, and the pigs were coaxed out of their houses to participate.

Daisy quietly took material from Mrs. Pettigrew's dressing table without permission. Meanwhile, Noel and Denny wanted to look like highwaymen. They wore brown-paper top-boots, slouch hats, and Turkish towel cloaks. H. O. was waiting for Dora to dress him up as the other clown. As they were getting ready, they saw the dogs chasing the sheep in the paddock. Lady, the deer-hound, was chasing a fat sheep. The children ran to stop the dogs from hurting the sheep.

As we approached the brook at the northern edge of the paddock, we noticed the sheep struggling in the water. Despite the shallowness of the stream, the sheep refused to stand up and save itself. With determination, Alice, Dicky, and I waded in, pulling the sheep by its shoulders until it could rest on our laps at the bank. The sheep, kicking all the while, gave one final kick that propelled it onto our laps like a pet dog.

In the countryside, unexpected adventures often find you, unlike the city where you must seek them out. A group of children once found themselves in a peculiar situation involving a pig and a curate. Despite the mishap, the children were let go after explaining themselves. The lady of the house even asked for their names and addresses to inform their father. As they left, they advised her to be lenient with her aunt. The children managed to bring the pig back home, a more thrilling task than catching a donkey.

Despite some initial gloom, the tranquil surroundings soon lifted their spirits. As they followed the stream, they encountered a water-rat and engaged in playful stone-throwing.

Arriving at the burning bridge, the young heroes knew that merely wetting caps or straw hats wouldn't douse the flames.

I cannot describe all the twists and turns of the stream. It wound through fields, woods, and meadows until the banks grew steep and the trees arched overhead. We felt like fairy tale princes on an adventure. Eventually, we reached a dark stone arch where the stream vanished, and we couldn't see light at the other end. Despite the darkness, Oswald led the way with a candle through a cramped underground tunnel. Emerging into daylight, we found ourselves in a marshy area with unique plants and flowers. The hot, swampy terrain was filled with insects, but we pressed on, scratched by brambles and squelching in water-filled boots. We left the stream behind, tracking it to its source as we trudged on, enduring heat, bugs, and thorny bushes.|['Question 1:\nWhat did the stream wind through?\nA) Fields\nB) Deserts\nC) Mountains\nD) Oceans\nE) Skyscrapers', 'Question 2:\nHow did the group feel while following the stream?\nA) Anxious\nB) Bored\nC) Excited\nD) Tired\nE) Hungry', 'Question 3:\nWhere did the group end up after passing through the dark stone arch?\nA) Desert\nB) Meadow\nC) Underground tunnel\nD) Marshy area\nE) Snowy mountain', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Oswald use to light the way in the underground tunnel?\nA) Flashlight\nB) Lantern\nC) Candle\nD) Torch\nE) Glow stick', 'Question 5:\nWhat was the terrain like in the marshy area?\nA) Rocky\nB) Sandy\nC) Hot and swampy\nD) Snow-covered\nE) Dry and arid', 'Question 6:\nWhat challenges did the group face as they tracked the stream to its source?\nA) Snowstorms\nB) Hail\nC) Heat, bugs, and thorny bushes\nD) Clear paths\nE) Gentle breeze']|['A) Fields', 'C) Excited', 'D) Marshy area', 'C) Candle', 'C) Hot and swampy', 'C) Heat, bugs, and thorny bushes']
Oswald, the natural leader of the group, takes charge, especially when it comes to his own ideas. He understands that leaders have responsibilities beyond just leading. One duty is to help weaker or injured members of the team, whether from the Polar or Equatorish regions. So, while the others moved ahead, Oswald assisted Denny, who was struggling due to sore feet. Unfortunately, Denny's feet were in pain because he had lost his stockings when he was a beaver. This made his journey uncomfortable. Suddenly, Denny started screaming in agony as black slug-like creatures attached themselves to his legs. Oswald tried to help by pulling them off, but they wouldn't budge. Remembering a story he read about leeches, he attempted to stop them but couldn't. With Denny in distress, Oswald carried his boots and supported him as they headed back to the group, who had heard Denny's cries and were on their way. Thankfully, a man passing by heard Denny's screams and rushed to assist them upon seeing the situation with the leeches.|"[""1.

Our hero, a young man in his prime, rescued a suffering man by removing leeches with salt. The man's mother helped, showing kindness. The hero received praise and coins for his good deed. Meanwhile, the wounded explorer rested as we enjoyed tea. Suddenly, Mrs. Pettigrew interrupted, leading to a mysterious conversation with Albert's uncle. The children were left to ponder the situation, finishing their treats. Albert's uncle returned, scolding them for causing trouble. The children faced consequences, learning a valuable lesson.

After strolling down the lane, we reached a beautiful clover-field followed by a cornfield and another lane leading to the mill. This mill was unique, boasting both water and wind mills alongside a charming house and farm buildings. The miller warmly welcomed us and gave us Eiffel Tower lemonade and Marie biscuits. He then graciously showed us around the mills, explaining how they worked. The water-mill felt like a fairy palace, with everything powdered white like sugar on pancakes.

As we strolled down the lane and crossed the cornfield and cloverfield, reminiscing about the vanished Baby, we noticed the absence of the tramps and the perambulator. Alas, the Baby was nowhere to be found. Noel whimsically expressed a desire to be a fish, evading hooks in a tranquil pool. Speculating about the missing Baby, we pondered the lordly perambulator's potential to reveal the culprits. On our way home through a shortcut, we encountered a peculiar sight near the Parson’s Shave—a white object concealed among the foliage. Investigating further, we uncovered the abandoned perambulator, discreetly camouflaged with leaves. Oswald proposed withholding our discovery from the authorities to avoid suspicion and preserve the scene intact. Amidst Oswald's narrative, Daisy and Alice shared a mysterious amusement, leaving Oswald puzzled and intrigued.|"[""1.

Oswald, a kind-hearted boy, invited Dora to join him and the other boys for a meal. However, Noel stayed behind with Alice, entertaining the baby. Dora later returned to the shepherd's house for dinner, where Mrs. Pettigrew was upset but still kept her some warm mutton. The boys then went fishing, but without success. Meanwhile, the girls and Noel appeared distressed, with Daisy holding a mysterious object resembling Alice in Wonderland. When Daisy accidentally touched meal-worms in Oswald's pocket, chaos ensued, causing Dora to have hysterics. Oswald ended up caring for the screaming baby, trying to calm it down while the others tended to Dora.

Oswald realized that the high-born baby had finally stopped crying. He hurried back to the sheep-house, feeling as tired as if they had all participated in a long athletic event. The Bastables and their friends wearily made their way back across the fields. Oswald had to continue holding the baby to prevent it from waking and crying again. They covered the baby with Dora's petticoat to keep it warm. As they approached the house, they were cautious in case they encountered Mrs. Pettigrew. Once in Oswald's room, they carefully placed the baby on the bed to ensure it stayed asleep. They took turns watching over it to prevent any sudden movements. Despite initial doubts, they realized the baby was a gentleman, not as high-born as they thought.

Not everyone can know everything without being informed. For instance, hunting foxes in August is a no-go in the country, but in Lewisham Road, even observant kids miss the memo. It's essential to clarify that none of us would ever shoot a fox intentionally, not even to save ourselves. However, if a man had to protect girls from savage foxes, it'd be a different story.

Fellow classmates, listen up! Albert's uncle plans to excavate a Roman site tomorrow. Wouldn't it be a shame if they found nothing? Inspired by a story, we decided to create our own archeological surprise. We crafted pottery by the stream, baked it under a bonfire, and buried it along with rusty hinges and buttons. With girl Councillors hiding the artifacts in their pinafores and the boys armed with tools, we sneaked to the Roman ruins. After digging a tunnel and carefully placing our items, we covered our tracks and hurried back, almost missing tea time. Later, we discovered more Roman-looking objects in the library and decided to bury them too. Prepared with peppermints for the chilly night, we embarked on our moonlit adventure, promising more daring escapades in the future.|"['1.

We chose two unbroken crooked jugs, similar to flower-pots, from Alice's collection. Carefully, we dug a deep hole, placed the jugs inside, filled it with earth, and covered it with turf. The next day, the Antiquities arrived for a gathering under the trees with cakes, bread, fruits, and flowers decorating the tables. As the men dug up Roman remains, the Antiquities seemed uninterested until they reached the spot where we had placed the jugs. Excited chatter ensued, indicating our successful sale. Despite not understanding the speeches, we joined the group to explore the Roman ruins. The crowd, dressed in umbrellas and overcoats, examined the unearthed items with little enthusiasm. It became evident that our extras had captured their attention, marking a successful transaction.|['1.

The bonnets and coats started to disperse towards the house, signaling the end of the event. We hurried home discreetly, catching the President conversing with Albert's uncle. The crowd of Antiquities gradually vanished from the lawn, leaving behind only remnants like dirty teacups and plates. The Dentist shared the tale of their mischievous plot, with a slight assist in storytelling from us. Albert's uncle noted the Roman pottery, revealing that the jugs were sold unknowingly. The realization of their unintentional theft weighed heavily on Oswald and Alice. They sat under the quince tree, lost in regret. As darkness fell, they pondered their predicament, unable to find a solution. The moonlight illuminated their troubled faces as they contemplated their next steps. Oswald discreetly sought permission to go to Maidstone the following day, hoping to rectify their mistake.|"[""1.

Alice and her brother went to the Secretary of the Maidstone Antiquities’ house, but he was not there. They were directed to the President's house, Mr. Longchamps. Upon arrival, they found a room filled with ancient artifacts collected by Mr. Longchamps. Alice confessed that they had unknowingly taken two real Roman jugs and placed them in a barrow as a prank. Mr. Longchamps kindly understood the situation and returned the jugs. He advised them to be cautious in the future and not to be deceived when dealing with Antiquities. He reassured them that mistakes happen and bid them farewell, reminding them that youth is a time for learning from such experiences.|"[""1.

On top of the ancient wall in the Three Tree pasture, we had just finished a fierce battle with bows and arrows. Oswald, Alice, Noel, and Denny defended the fort with all their might. Dicky, who was hit on the nose by an arrow, had to retire for repairs. While the defenders were distracted, he sneaked up and pushed Oswald off, causing the fort to surrender. Despite the tramp's dusty appearance, ragged clothes, and cheerful demeanor, we outnumbered him on the wall. The tramp shared his struggles with us, lamenting the lack of work for honest men. Feeling empathy, we quietly left some money for him to find when he woke up. The dogs, who had been with us, seemed to trust him, confirming our belief in his honesty.|"[""1.

After dinner, we sat by the stream with our feet in the water. Some say it upsets your stomach, but it never bothers us. There's a fallen willow that seats eight of us, but those at the ends can't dip their feet properly, so we switch spots. We chewed on liquorice root, which helps us think. Dora mentioned how tricky it is to change places on the willow, crawling over each other. We joked about starting a Benevolent Bar to listen to people's stories. We prepared in secret, sewing sun-blinds and petticoats for shade. The girls used Mrs. Pettigrew's sewing machine in the cellar without her knowing. We planned to set up the Benevolent Bar the next day, knowing that delays are risky.|['1.

They had to balance it on one end of the beer-stand. It was not easy. While they were doing the sewing we boys went out and got willow poles and chopped the twigs off, and got ready as well as we could to put up the awning. When we returned a group of us went down to the shop in the village for Eiffel Tower lemonade. We bought seven-and-sixpence worth; then we made a great label to say what the bar was for. Then there was nothing else to do except to make rosettes out of a blue sash of Daisy’s to show we belonged to the Benevolent Bar. The next day was as hot as ever. We rose early from our innocent slumbers and went out to the Dover Road to the spot we had marked down the day before. It was at a crossroads to be able to give drinks to as many people as possible. After breakfast, we got the big zinc bath they wash clothes in, and after filling it with clean water, we just had to empty it again because it was too heavy to lift. So we carried it vacant to the trysting-spot and left H. O. and Noel to guard it while we went and fetched separate pails of water; very heavy work, and no one who wasn’t really benevolent would have bothered about it for an instant. Oswald alone carried three pails. So did Dicky and the Dentist. Then we rolled|['1.

More people passed by than we served lemonade to. Some refused because they thought they were too important. One man mentioned he could pay for his own drink if he needed one, but thankfully he didn't. Others inquired about beer, and when we didn't have any, they judged us. A man complained about not getting anything for free and left sadly without a drink. Our helper from the Tower of Mystery event passed by, and we shared our lemonade with him. He appreciated it and praised us. However, a group of boys started gathering, and one boy demanded more lemonade after having three glasses. Oswald refused, leading to a confrontation. The situation escalated when the boy returned with four others, but our tramp friend arrived, diffusing the tension. The boys' behavior improved with his presence.|"['1.

One of the men claimed he was blessed, followed by another agreeing. Despite this, the third man dismissed the blessings and focused on the drink. The men requested a drink, causing the dogs to growl. Oswald, the protagonist, decided to offer them drinks to avoid conflict. However, the men were disrespectful, setting their glasses on the table. Oswald then signaled to his companions to leave as he felt it was time to go home after nearly four hours of benevolence. Suddenly, a disturbing incident occurred when one of the men spat out the whisky, leading to a confrontation. Feeling outnumbered, Oswald called for help, and their tramp swiftly intervened, leading to a scuffle.

The Pig-man called for the police, and H. O. rushed to get help. The scoundrels managed to escape from under Dicky and the tramp, shaking off the dogs and fleeing down the road. The Pig-man instructed the boys to go home and shooed them away. H. O. returned as they left, and we stood breathless and tearful at the scene. Oswald and Dicky's tears were of pure rage. We tended to the tramp's lump and the Pig-man and his friends helped us carry our belongings home. The Pig-man advised us not to act kindly without adult supervision. We've learned our lesson and won't be helping strangers again without proper guidance. The tramp got a job thanks to the Pig-man and has been doing well.

After a rainy day at the Benevolent Bar, the children struggled to find indoor amusement. While some played the disliked game of Halma and others wrote poetry, H. O. sang loudly.

Oswald and Dicky ventured into the woods to gather ash-sticks despite the harsh weather. They collected eight long sticks, returned home, and peeled them. The sticks got dirty quickly, and even after washing their hands, they left marks on anything white. They decorated the sticks with paper rosettes to mimic cockle-shells. Some pilgrims tied their boots with white tape to resemble sandals. Denny was one of the dedicated pilgrims who did this. They considered wearing nightgowns but opted for their regular clothes to blend in at Canterbury. The next morning, the pilgrims had breakfast before setting out with lunch packed by Mrs. Pettigrew. The group was accompanied by their loyal dogs, except for Martha, the bulldog who disliked walks. They carried rolled-up newspapers, including the Globe and the Westminster Gazette, with them.

We knew the way to Canterbury well as the old Pilgrims’ Road runs above our house. It's a charming, narrow road, often shady and perfect for walking. Carts avoid it due to its roughness, allowing grass to grow in patches. Despite the warmth, we pressed on as pilgrims, silencing complaints. The Prioress and the wife of Bath abandoned their usual antics due to the heat. We marched cheerfully until Denny, feeling unwell, stopped abruptly. After a lunch break, Denny confessed he cheated by placing peas in his shoes to seem more dedicated to the pilgrimage.

We returned to Denny, where the girls fussed over him. Oswald and Dicky, being older, stayed serious and distant, realizing that being good wasn't enough; we had to get Denny home. So, Dickie and Oswald crafted a sedan chair and carried Denny to the main road. We waited in a ditch, hoping for a ride. Eventually, a brewer's dray passed by, but the driver was asleep. We missed the chance to stop the horses. A lady offered to take Denny and the girls to Canterbury, a short distance away. The city was smaller than expected, with a quaint inn named the 'George and Dragon'. After exploring the church and other sights, we found Canterbury charming but petite.

The actual name of the place was Hazelbridge, not Canterbury. We visited Canterbury on another occasion. We weren't upset with the lady for misleading us about it being Canterbury because she had kept up the charade very well. When we returned to the inn, we noticed her dogcart and a grocer's cart. She kindly offered the girls a ride in her cart, while the boys rode with the grocer. The grocer's cart was quite bumpy. As we arrived home in the evening, we expressed our gratitude to the lady, hoping to see her again. She reciprocated the sentiment and waved goodbye as Albert's uncle suddenly appeared. He swiftly fixed a flat tire on a bicycle, then rode off at a remarkable speed. We speculated about his connection to the lady, pondering if she was his long-lost relative. The girls found the idea of being bridesmaids exciting, while the boys found girls to be unpredictable. The mystery surrounding the lady and Albert's uncle remained unsolved for the time being.|"['1.

We explored the grand Canterbury Cathedral with a guide who spoke loudly, making it feel less like a church. Some visitors even laughed, which seemed more disrespectful than forgetting to remove a cap like H.O. did. Meanwhile, Albert's uncle, on his bicycle, seemed preoccupied with finding someone. The tale then shifts to the burial of a pig in the garden, with the children digging and hoping to find hidden treasures. As they uncovered something hard and hollow, they briefly thought it was a pot of gold, but it turned out to be a bone buried by their dog, Pincher. This unexpected discovery led to a discussion about skeletons and fears, reminding them to be cautious about what they share with younger siblings before bedtime.|"['1.

Oswald didn't pause to argue. He spotted a keeper who knew about setting snares and wanted to discuss ferrets, so he left with Dicky, Denny, and Alice. Daisy and Dora went to finish reading. H.O. and Noel were left with the bony head. They took it away. The incident faded from Oswald's mind until the next day when Noel and H.O. came in looking hot and anxious. They hadn't washed and signaled Oswald secretly. They found a camp of soldiers, armed men, a historical encounter. Disbelief reigned until they reached the hilltop and saw the real camp with soldiers in grey and red tunics. The group, astonished, didn't lie in ambush but observed the soldiers. Oswald felt shocked to see the enemy cleaning a pot in an English field. Their plan to mingle with the troops seemed futile. Noel's revelation stunned everyone.|"['1.

"The soldier chuckled, revealing the secret behind their padded tunics. He described their comical morning baths in a bucket at dawn, a hilarious image that haunted our thoughts. Alice urgently nudged Oswald, warning him not to waste time chatting with the soldier, suspecting a ploy to delay us. As we retreated to the wood in silence, Oswald considered an ambush, but the wet ground deterred us. Alice, pulling H. O. and Noel, hurried us to the road. Denny, acknowledging our collective responsibility, joined us. Oswald admired Denny's growing sense of honor amidst the house of Bastable. Reflecting on the consequences of the sown dragon's teeth, we learned the importance of knowing our seeds.

"Some of us hesitated to let the girls leave, but it seemed unkind to object. However, a sense of relief filled at least one heart when Dora and Daisy decided to stay back and guide passersby on the correct road. Dora explained, ""It would be dreadful if someone ended up in Dover instead of their intended destination like buying pigs or rushing for a doctor."" By dinner time, the girls returned home, completely unaware of the situation. As we strolled with Martha looking after them, Lady and Pincher accompanied us. Despite the late hour, thoughts of dinner were set aside, though we knew it was roast rabbits and currant jelly that day. Walking in pairs, we sang patriotic tunes to feel connected to the British Army. Unexpectedly, we encountered soldiers in grey and silver lounging at a crossroads. The soldiers joked about being out of generals but having affordable majors and captains. A brief debate led Alice to bravely approach the Colonel, convinced he wouldn't harm a girl. All six of us stood before the Colonel, agreeing to salute him on the count of three. Amidst the attempt, H.

"Before the Colonel could respond to the Cocked Hat, Alice addressed him. She had confided in me earlier as we navigated through the resting soldiers. Noel interjected, ""We're not just a Band of Hope, we're British! Maidstone is in peril, the enemy is near, and you're here smoking."" Noel, on the verge of tears, urged us boys to lead. It was empowering to march at the regiment's forefront. Alice rode with the Colonel, perched on a red-roan steed as if from a tale. The Colonel mentioned South African horse terms as we guided the British Army discreetly towards Sugden's Waste Wake pasture. At the gate, he halted, selecting Dicky and Oswald as guides to investigate an ambush. As we maneuvered through quietly, twigs betrayed our presence. The Colonel, after a squint, acknowledged our strategic advantage with a vintage exclamation. He swiftly directed the troops, emphasizing the need to regroup.

The Colonel hurriedly directed everyone to take cover in a ditch as the enemy approached. Hiding alongside the horses and the Cocked Hat, Alice, we crouched in the muddy ditch, forgetting about our boots in the tense moment. Oswald, feeling the water seeping into his boots, listened intently as the footsteps of the approaching foe grew louder. Suddenly, the enemy's officer spoke, causing confusion among their ranks as they tried to escape through the hedges. Our Colonel bravely approached the enemy's Colonel, demanding surrender. The enemy's Colonel defiantly refused, but as our men began firing, the enemy quickly gave in, admitting defeat. The enemy's Colonel then ordered his men to regroup, signaling the end of the conflict. In the end, it was revealed that the Bastables, including Denis Foulkes, had cleverly infiltrated the enemy ranks to gather valuable information, inadvertently causing the chaos.|"['1.

Oswald recounted the story with humility, giving credit to others. Despite interruptions of 'Bravo!' even from the enemy's Colonel, they reached the British camp. The Colonel graciously invited them for tea, including the enemy's Colonel. H.O. revealed their names, prompting the Colonel to commend Oswald's bravery and offer a reward. Oswald declined the money, emphasizing the team effort. The Colonel acknowledged their honor and offered soldier's pay.

The end of our holiday was fast approaching. We were soon to head back to Blackheath, leaving behind the joys of the countryside. Despite the impending return, we felt a mix of sorrow and excitement to share our adventures with our families and friends. The council meeting was somber, making it easier for Oswald and Dicky to propose their ideas. Oswald expressed his surprise and swiftly put it to a vote. With H. O., Noel, and Alice on their side, Daisy and Dora found themselves in the minority. We tried to lift their spirits by reading from the Golden Deed book. After the Wouldbegoods group was dissolved, Noel recited a poem, bringing a sense of closure. As the council concluded, Oswald felt a sense of relief and a newfound desire to be a better person.

A noble deed gone wrong led to a tea-tray disaster. Oswald took the blame, hoping his siblings would own up too, but they didn't. In bed, Oswald planned to uncover the lady in the red hat who paid the grocer to drive them. His siblings, feeling guilty, joined him. Oswald proposed a march to Hazelbridge to find the lady. Despite Oswald's strict shoe rule, all siblings volunteered. On a fine day, the eight set off, not as heroes but eager to do good.

With joyful hearts and no discomfort, the journey to Hazelbridge was cheerfully undertaken. We brought our lunch along, accompanied by our beloved dogs. Later, we regretted bringing all of them, but they were eager to join. Even Martha, our slow walker, was allowed to come. At Hazelbridge, we entered B. Munn’s grocery store for ginger-beer. The warm glass surprised us, but we used it as an excuse to chat with B. Munn. Despite our efforts, he was reluctant to share more. However, when we ordered extra-strong peppermints, his heart softened. As he packed them, Dora's question prompted him to reveal the lady’s address. Martha's foot trouble led us to take turns carrying her home. Although some suggested returning without her, we persevered, hoping for a kind soul to offer us a ride.|"['1.

We reached a well-maintained hedge with a ditch and chains to keep people out. A gate labeled 'The Cedars' stood before us. Alice, exhausted, expressed doubt that it was Albert's grandmother's house, suspecting his sweetheart instead. Oswald suggested delivering a gift anyway, hoping Albert's uncle might appreciate it. He bravely approached the house alone. The others hid nearby. Oswald saw the tidy house and hesitated, realizing his dusty boots. Just then, Alice signaled all was well, deducing the lady was Albert's sweetheart, not his grandmother. Martha wandered off and got caught, revealing their presence.

"It seemed pointless to involve more excited actors in the ongoing scene. We stood motionless. The man, a clergyman, stood up. Later, we learned he was the kindest we knew, similar to Mr. Briston from Lewisham. At that moment, I didn't like him. He questioned, ""How long since you fled the asylum, my dear? And where is your keeper?"" The lady intervened, explaining our misguided attempt to find her for Albert's uncle. The clergyman, intrigued, asked about the other visitors hiding nearby.
