The Argono river flowed near Mollie's house, and the four girls set off on a barge down the stream. As they chatted about Amy's secret and the fun ahead, the sun began to set behind the clouds.

The five-hundred-dollar bill remained in Mr. Nelson's safe, with no news of the owner. An advertisement was published again.

Their initial destination for the night was Rockford, a town about sixteen miles away, where Betty's aunt resided. They planned to spend two nights there, with a day set aside to visit an old historic mill. After many goodbyes and well wishes from friends, Betty, the chosen leader, assessed her group. Though small in number, the girls were a charming sight that June morning under the trees.

The day was perfect, neither too hot nor too windy, with a sweet scent of flowers in the air. The group walked along a country road lined with maples, offering shade from the promising noon heat. As they continued, they admired the sights, like a cow in a meadow. They stopped by a brook and spring for a break, enjoying a picnic under a great oak tree.

If the girls had expected their first day of hiking to go smoothly, they were in for a disappointment. Unaware, they walked and chatted, missing the signposts they passed. Amy was the one to realize the mistake caused by a farmer. At a crossroads, they encountered a new sign from a local car group. A boy nearby informed them they were not lost and gave directions to Bakersville. He mistook them for actors, which made the girls laugh. Despite feeling a bit deflated, they continued on, admiring the sky and the scenery. As darkness approached, Grace worried they wouldn't reach their destination in time. They considered staying overnight in a nearby hamlet as farm sounds filled the air.|['1.

"Mollie confidently stated, ""I'll ask if we can hire a team to drive us to Rockford."" Betty, sensing danger from a growling creature, grabbed an empty olive bottle for protection.

She paused, unsure of what to say. They faced a dilemma - needing a place to stay that night, ruling out the option of a strange farmhouse. Finally, they decided to call Betty's anxious relative. After a hearty supper, they set off to Mrs. Palmer's with the farmer's team. The drive was short, the early sun casting streaks through the trees. They had stayed longer at Betty's aunt's home, enjoying her warm welcome. Grace's shoes had been sent to Rockford, telephoned for. Mr. Palmer insisted they stay longer, boasting about the walks around Rockford. The girls had a pleasant visit, enjoying the old-fashioned rooms and meeting new friends. They even inspired the local girls to start a walking club named after Betty. They went for a drive, visited local spots, and had a surprise party in the evening, making it a delightful day.|"['1.

"""I think we all feel the same way,"" Grace said softly. She couldn't help but steal a glance at Amy, whose expression was a mix of emotions that Grace couldn't quite decipher. Was it disappointment or longing? The mystery surrounding Amy's past had clearly left an impact on her. Despite this, Amy didn't let her mood affect their group. Sensing Grace's gaze, Amy laughed and pulled her into an impromptu dance on the grass.

Mollie, taking charge of their lunch packed by Mrs. Palmer, expressed her excitement about the meal. Grace, feeling hungry and disappointed about missing chocolates, suggested they stop for a break. They found a peaceful spot by a stream to rest. Grace used the break to mend her stockings while they enjoyed the serene surroundings.

There was no choice but to go back the way they came. They could have taken a break at a roadside eatery, but those were rare, and the few they passed didn't seem appealing. Aunt Sallie had packed a delicious lunch. The girls arrived at the resting spot sooner than expected, maybe because they walked faster. When they saw the peaceful grassy area, Mollie pointed out it was theirs. Betty's voice trembled as she acknowledged it was their lunch. A man approached and handed the missing lunch to Betty. The Little Captain surprised everyone by offering him some food, explaining they were on a walking tour. The man ate in a nearby grove, and as he left, he dropped some papers. Betty picked them up, but Grace cautioned her not to read them, suggesting they find the man to return his forgotten letters.|"[""1.

"""Girls!"" called Betty excitedly, showing her friends a letter. ""This man might be the one we're looking for! He mentioned the money we found, and his writing resembles the note on the five hundred dollars. We need to find him!"" 

Betty admitted, ""I don't think he was a tramp. He mentioned a disguise and searching for something. He must be looking for his lost money. But which way did he go?"" 

Despite their efforts, they couldn't locate the man. As they reached Middleville, inquiries yielded no leads. Disheartened, Betty lamented, ""I hoped we'd solve the money mystery. Now it seems farther away. I'll keep this torn letter as evidence. He must have had high hopes for that five hundred dollars only to lose it.""

Betty realized the rail break was dangerous, especially for the express train. The track-walker, grateful for their alertness, flagged down the oncoming train with a red flag. He promised to fix the rail with Jimmie's help. The girls were praised for their quick thinking. The track-walker mentioned that the railroad company might reward them, just like they did for someone named Mike Malone in the past.

When the girls saw the train pass by safely, relieved that they helped prevent a potential disaster, they continued their journey. They paused for lunch in a small grove, enjoying tea, cake, bread, and meat from Amy's cousin. Amy's torn skirt was quickly mended by the roadside. Suddenly, they heard a bear on the road and ran in panic. Luckily, they managed to avoid a fall. As they dashed through the underbrush, a bugle call caught their attention. They saw a man in a red jacket handling the bear. Feeling safe, they returned to the road. The man with the bear performed tricks, and the girls continued on their way, passing through a village and reaching their destination just before a heavy rain started. They sought shelter on a porch as the rain poured down.|"['1.

The girls, soaked from the rain, abandoned formality and rushed into the hall through the front door. Inside, they found a parlor and a sitting room. Betty, noticing the rain seeping in, urged the others to close the windows. Breathless, they waited for any sign of life, but the house remained silent. Betty led the way upstairs, where they found empty rooms. Only a friendly Maltese cat greeted them. With the storm raging outside, they closed all the windows. Grace remarked on the well-kept house, suggesting the owner wouldn't leave it open in a storm. The rain continued steadily, with gusts of wind howling around the house.

Grace interrupted to ease her sister's worry, assuring her that their uncertain arrival date was not a concern. The worry was about finding shelter and food due to the storm. Mollie firmly decided they would stay in the well-ordered house. They planned to pay the owners if they returned and offered to compensate for looking after the house.

The group of friends had been enjoying a week of camping in the woods, with the boys in a tent and the girls in a bungalow, making the most of the beautiful weather. They sang songs around the campfire at night and even went out on the lake with a small boat owned by Mr. Smith. As they were getting ready to leave, the girls received fresh outfits just in time. Despite the boys' pleas to join them on their journey to Judgeville, Betty insisted they stick to their original plan of traveling alone. The girls were looking forward to the gaieties planned by Betty's cousin in Judgeville before heading to Deepdale. The weather took a turn for the worse, forcing them to stay indoors for a few days, but when the sun finally came out, they set off on the next leg of their adventure. While walking along a highway near a railroad track, the friends discussed finding a five hundred dollar bill and stopped for lunch near a trestle bridge. Suddenly, a man leaped from the bridge into the stream below to avoid an oncoming train, disappearing under the water in a dramatic turn of events.|"['1.

"""I had a narrow escape today,"" the young man shared, still a bit shaken. ""I shouldn't have been on that bridge as a worker warned me about an approaching train. Railroads seem to bring me bad luck. This isn't the first time I've had trouble on this line.""

The other young man, now wringing out his vest, responded, ""From Deepdale, right? I've passed through there on the train. Does this line go there?"" he gestured to the line he had hurriedly left.

""The railroads have caused me trouble twice,"" the young man continued. ""I nearly got hurt now, and lost money on this line before.""
