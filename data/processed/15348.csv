In 1883, a violent volcanic eruption in Krakatoa inspired a tale set in the eastern seas. The devastation caused by the eruption led to a desire to share the story with young readers. The facts in the story are based on the Krakatoa Committee's report and works by A.R. Wallace, H.O. Forbes, and Darwin. On a dark night in 1883, a brig in the Indian Ocean near the Malay Archipelago was becalmed. Two men, one tall and one short, walked on the deck. The short man, the captain, advised the young man, Nigel, to avoid getting lost in poetry and to focus on his duties as a seaman. Nigel's father praised his mother's poetic abilities but warned Nigel against indulging in poetic flights.|"['1.

The storm arrived from the Sunda Straits, where the captain and his son had been discussing. They had to scud before it with almost bare poles. Throughout the night, it raged, growing more intense towards morning. A back-stay of the foremast broke, causing additional strain on the other stays, leading to their parting. The fore-top-mast snapped off, taking the main-topgallant-mast with it. After the havoc, the storm began to calm, reduced to a stiff breeze at sunrise. Nigel Roy, the amateur first mate, energetically helped secure everything. His father, the captain, took a practical view of the situation, emphasizing that what seems bad may turn out good. The captain then shared the tale of the Keelin' Islands, volcanic with a coral top-dressing, once uninhabited until claimed by a Scotsman named Ross.|"[""1.

Before 1836, Hare left for Singapore, where he passed away, leaving Ross in charge, known as the 'King of the Cocos Islands.' Under Ross's son's leadership, the Group thrived, trading coconuts and excelling in boat-building. However, the presence of unruly coolies from Java, former criminals, caused constant unrest. To maintain order, strict rules were enforced, such as no overnight stays on uninhabited islands without permission. In 1862, a cyclone devastated the island, prompting Ross's son to summon his engineering student son from Glasgow for help. The young engineer transformed the island, replacing the criminals with upstanding citizens, developing infrastructure, and introducing education. Despite a second cyclone in 1876, the island thrived, with 500 happy residents.|"[""1.

Around midnight on the 28th, a fierce gale struck the island. The darkness was thick between lightning flashes, and the roaring wind nearly drowned out the thunder. To survive, people had to hide in ditches and hollows. Mr. Ross and his group sought shelter near a wall. Suddenly, a schooner approached on a massive wave, heading straight for them. Mr. Ross shouted a warning, and they clung to the wall as the wave crashed over, destroying his house but sparing the wall. The schooner got stuck just before reaching them. Despite the devastation, the islanders survived the cyclone seven years ago and are now thriving. As night fell, the gale calmed, allowing them to navigate to the calm lagoon inside the reef. Nigel Roy observed the phosphorescent fish and coral life with great interest. The calm lake was surrounded by a coral reef, with islets and vegetation scattered within. They were warmly welcomed by Mr. Ross, the governor of the Cocos Islands, and offered resources to repair their ship, the _Sunshine_. Captain Roy only requested a stick to rig a foretop-mast to sail to Batavia for repairs. The islanders, skilled sailors, lived in well-furnished cottages with boats at the water's edge. Nigel was charmed by their innocence and kindness.|['1.

After a long walk, Mr. Ross bombarded the captain with questions about the latest news from civilization, especially new engineering inventions. The island king excused himself for kingdom duties until dinner. The captain then offered the boy a choice: row on the lagoon or visit a family he loved. They went to a neat cottage on a high ridge with a view of the ocean and lagoon. The children were thrilled to see the captain, who had won their hearts with sea stories. The mother, fluent in English, warmly welcomed them. The captain playfully introduced his son and engaged the children with stories. They were interrupted by more kids welcoming the captain.

The young man happily agreed to offer advice on perspective to Kathy, who had learned about it from Mr. Ross's brother, an engineer. Both artists were engrossed in their work, surrounded by the peaceful sounds of nature. They observed snipe, curlews, hermit crabs, lizards, spiders, and ants. Nigel and Kathy then enjoyed a meal of nuts under the palm trees. Kathy shared fascinating facts about a large crab that can crack open coconuts. After finishing their work, they discovered a young boy had stowed away in their boat. On their way back, Nigel and the boy marveled at the vibrant colors of the coral reefs and fish below.

The hermit's cave served as both a dining room and kitchen, with a table lacking a tablecloth and a small stove emitting savory odors. Nigel noticed his host's reserved nature, polite yet distant. The hermit, though gentle, maintained a quiet dignity that discouraged familiarity. During the meal, Nigel tried to learn more about the hermit's motives but found him evasive yet courteous. Despite the hermit's serious demeanor, Nigel gradually felt more comfortable. Nigel discovered that the hermit treated Moses as an equal rather than a servant. The hermit offered Nigel a position as his attendant and companion, requiring shorthand skills for note-taking and canoe-paddling. Suddenly, the cavern shook, revealing the region's seismic nature. The hermit explained the island's history of earthquakes and volcanic activity, emphasizing the unpredictability of supposedly extinct volcanoes.|"[""1.

His friend nodded in agreement, acknowledging the lack of proper geographical and scientific education in primary schools. Java, an island similar in size to England, boasts forty-nine towering volcanic mountains, some reaching heights of 12,000 feet. These mountains are active, with frequent eruptions and various volcanic activities like hot springs and mud-volcanoes. The hermit explained that Krakatoa Island is situated at the intersection of two significant fissures in the earth's crust, hinting at a potential volcanic revival. The hermit's library contains valuable resources on volcanoes, and he invited his guest to explore more. They climbed the Peak of Rakata to a sunlit plateau, serving as the hermit's observatory for stargazing. The hermit showcased his collection of telescopes and microscopes, including a large six-foot telescope.|"[""1.

The hermit explained his unique way of harnessing sunlight using mirrors to light up his cave. He also showed how he could redirect the sunlight using mirrors on a distant peak. The hermit then pointed out nearby islands that were once part of a massive volcano blown into the air in 1680, leaving only remnants above water. He warned of a potentially active vent called Perboewatan, indicating a possible eruption due to increased earthquakes. Despite the danger, he mentioned that people in the area were accustomed to volcanic activity. The hermit invited his guest to explore the lush forests of the island, offering to guide them along with his companion, Moses.|"['1.

Returning to the cave, they found that the active man had finished his morning meal, washed the dishes, and tidied up the kitchen. He was ready with a bag and a gun when his master asked him to prepare for a day in the forest. Instead of following them, we turn to matters of more interest at the moment. After a delightful day exploring the lush tropical vegetation on the island, visiting an extinct crater, bathing in hot springs, and collecting botanical and geological specimens, they returned to the cave-house eager for food and rest. The cave was dark when they entered, but Moses lit a lamp, illuminating the space. They had supper and then became a bit more sociable. Nigel was shown his sleeping spot in a recess with a blanket. As he lay down, he observed his host and Moses engaged in conversation, which kept him awake for a while. Eventually, he fell into a deep slumber but was abruptly awakened by strange sensations and sounds, leading to a restless night.|['1.

The hermit and his companions observed the volcano, Krakatoa, which they initially thought was dormant but turned out to be moderately active. The cone of Perboewatan was visibly erupting with molten lava, rocks, and smoke. The hermit explained that although Rakata, the highest cone, was distant from the main activity, the volcanic energy might seek other vents first. The explosions were intense, with rocks hurtling through the air and lightning flashing around the vapour-column. Fine white dust covered the island, and pumice floated into the Indian Ocean. Despite scientists describing the eruption as moderately violent, to the observers, it seemed far more severe. The hermit reassured them that the explosions were decreasing, but Nigel felt it was safer to leave the island while the volcano was active. The hermit prepared to depart, and Nigel, eager for adventure, was ready to follow, despite the potential risks.|"['1.

A steamboat was prepared for a sightseeing trip on the morning of May 26th. Captain David Roy, accompanied by a group of tourists, decided to visit a volcano out of curiosity. The group arrived at the eruption site on May 27th after witnessing explosions and earthquakes the night before. They observed the aftermath of the eruption with white dust covering the islands. The party identified Perboewatan as the active volcano and approached it on the steamboat. Explosions occurred at regular intervals, and the steam-cloud lit up with a fiery glow each time. The merchant shared experiences of volcanic activities from other places. Captain Roy realized finding his son on the island would be challenging due to dense forests and decided to continue the ascent with the group. Later, Nigel and the hermit arrived at the volcano, witnessing the immense crater and the deafening roar of the eruption.|"['1.

The loud explosions and crackling rocks meeting in the air, alongside the bubbling lava, created a scene that resembled the very depths of hell. Nigel, lost in the spectacle, was jolted back to reality by Moses, pointing out other visitors nearby. As Nigel observed them, a nautical man appeared, equally mesmerized by the volcanic display. After a moment of mutual shock, they exchanged warm greetings, momentarily halting a photographer setting up to capture the scene. Despite the awe-inspiring power of nature, science's influence was evident as the photographer prepared to capture the volcano on film. Nigel's father bid farewell, cautioning his son about the potential dangers of living near such active volcanoes. As they parted ways, Nigel's father reminded him to stay safe on his upcoming travels to wild and remote places.|"['1.

The hermit and his companion prepared to set sail on their canoe adventure. Nigel, the newcomer, was shown the cargo stored near the landing spot. Bags of pemmican, fresh water, gunpowder, tea, sugar, and biscuits were neatly packed. They also had mysterious bags and boxes ready for the journey. A small monkey named Spinkie, the cave's resident, was their unexpected passenger. Nigel made friends with the affectionate monkey, cementing a bond. After a simple breakfast, the men readied their beds and equipment. Armed with hatchets and knives, they launched the canoe. Nigel was instructed on using the apron to keep dry in rough weather.

The hermit explained the canoe's unique features to Nigel. The deck had watertight boxes to keep water out, and a pump to handle any leaks. The hermit showed Nigel a narrow box under the deck with useful tools and a small mast with a sail. The hermit paddled with a double-bladed paddle, while Moses used a single blade. Spinkie, the monkey, joined them on the deck. As they glided over the water, the hermit assured Nigel that Spinkie could take care of himself. With powerful strokes, they set off eastward, benefiting from the canoe's design and their strength. They soon left the land behind and marveled at the sunrise over the sea. Nigel pondered the purpose of their journey and the hermit's mysterious background. The group passed through the Sunda Straits and entered the island-filled archipelago. Moses shared baked bird with Nigel, but Spinkie eagerly grabbed the food, causing a silent laugh from Moses.|['1.

Nigel sat back, enjoying a biscuit and a drumstick, eyes on the tranquil sea under the bright sun. The equatorial heat didn't bother him; he loved it. Van der Kemp and Moses felt the same way. Sea-birds circled the canoe, hoping for scraps from Van der Kemp. Nigel and Moses fed them, feeling the birds were grateful. Nigel believed animals, like dogs, showed gratitude. The trio refreshed with water and paddled towards a wooded islet to spend the night. Passing native boats and ships, they received cheers of recognition. As they landed on the islet, they prepared a meal and settled by the fire, enjoying the peaceful night after a day of hard work. Spinkie, the monkey, enjoyed his biscuit and cocoa-nut scraps before retreating to sleep in the wild.|['1.

"""Have you ever explored the interior of the bigger islands?"" Nigel inquired, hoping to hear tales of encounters with untamed creatures or people. ""But the forests aren't valuable for trade, are they?"" Nigel probed further, catching Van der Kemp's attention. ""Not valuable for trade?"" Van der Kemp echoed in surprise. ""You seem unaware of our archipelago's riches. Borneo, larger than your British islands combined, is engulfed in forests. New Guinea surpasses Borneo in size. Sumatra is slightly smaller. France is dwarfed by some of our islands. Java, Luzon, and Celebes match Ireland's size. Eighteen islands are as big as Jamaica, over a hundred like the Isle of Wight, with countless smaller ones. Our archipelago spans 4000 miles east to west and 1,300 miles north to south, eclipsing Europe."" Nigel had finally piqued Van der Kemp's interest. The hermit shared fervently about the islands' treasures, defending his homeland with pride. ""And what about the wildlife?"" Nigel prodded, but the hermit, lost in reverie, replied, ""Ah, the days gone by. You're too young to grasp the sorrow of lost memories.

By the time the fire had faded, and not needed for warmth, it had not been restocked. The dim light of the rising moon, not yet above the horizon, only made the darkness visible, obscuring Moses' figure in the bush's shadow behind him. As a boat neared the island, Moses noted it was a large boat, likely to stay the night. The crew landed on the opposite side, so the voyagers remained still to avoid notice. As the moon rose, voices approached. Nigel saw Van der Kemp's transformed expression, and the crew stayed quiet. Nigel, taking charge, quickly readied the canoe for departure. They paddled away silently, avoiding detection. Nigel suggested heading for land due to impending bad weather, but Van der Kemp's silence indicated they would stay put.|"['1.

The night had turned pitch black as a thick cloud veiled the moon and stars, making it hard to see more than a few yards ahead. The air was eerily calm, with only the distant glow of Krakatoa's fires visible. Nigel, feeling a mix of awe and fear, wished to be safely ashore. The hermit and his monkey companion prepared the canoe for a sudden squall, equipping themselves with waterproof gear. As the wind picked up, they swiftly adjusted the sails, with Nigel lending a hand. A violent squall hit, submerging the canoe, but they managed to weather the storm.

The hermit, Nigel, and Moses battled the storm in their canoe. Waves crashed over them as they fought to keep the canoe afloat. Nigel felt a mix of fear and excitement as they navigated the tumultuous waters. The hermit's skilled paddling saved them from capsizing. They used a floating anchor to shield themselves from the worst of the storm. Despite being drenched, they huddled together, seeking refuge from the raging elements. Amidst the chaos, Nigel found solace in prayer, reflecting on the power of the Almighty. As the storm raged on, they clung to the hope of survival. Finally, as the storm subsided, they prepared to resume their voyage, grateful to have weathered the tempest.|"[""1.

When the mast was reset and the sails hoisted, the boat raced ahead like a speck of foam. Sunlight broke through the clouds, casting a green spot on the sea. Spinkie, the monkey, leaped out and settled by the mast. The wind calmed, sails unfurled, and they sailed smoothly. As the sun shone, the wind eased, and the sea grew calm. Nigel worried about reaching Borneo, but Van der Kemp explained a plan to get help from passing ships. Suddenly, they spotted something in the distance. Moses prepared a rope to secure the canoe to a steamer that approached. The steamer slowed down, and ropes were thrown to secure the vessels together.

"The captain shouted, ""Haul away!"" Instantly, the canoe was lifted into the air by Van der Kemp and Moses. Simultaneously, the steamer surged forward at full speed. Nigel found himself on the deck of the steamer, bewildered by the sudden turn of events. Van der Kemp explained that he often hitched rides on ships for quick travel in the Java seas. Later that night, as they walked the deck, Nigel learned more about his friend's adventurous life. Curious about the laughter coming from the sailors, Nigel approached to find Moses engaging in banter with the crew.

Keep the ball rolling, boys, and each one do his best to make the world a happy place - that's how man is blessed. Treat others around you with kindness and honesty, and in return, they will do the same for you. The sailors, clearly delighted, joined in the chorus enthusiastically. The weather improved as the hours passed, and after a smooth journey of about twenty-four hours across the Malay Sea, the three travelers were lowered into their canoe near Borneo. The captain bid them farewell, expressing his regret that their paths were parting. The sea was calm as they approached Borneo, paddling up a stream surrounded by mangrove trees. The roots of the mangroves in the water looked like twisting snakes in the dim light, adding an eerie atmosphere to their journey. Unbeknownst to them, they were nearing a group of people known as Head Hunters, who believed that taking a life was a rite of passage to manhood. These Head Hunters were a dangerous group, and our adventurers found themselves unknowingly approaching their camp.

Nigel found it strange that his master had to secretly follow strangers twice in a short span. The hermit, experienced from riding with the Vaqueros of America and hunting with the Rockies' Indians, showed no fear of being caught. A plot to attack another tribe was in motion, and Nigel was determined to help save his friend. Armed with a revolver and a cutlass, they stealthily paddled the canoe down the river, aiming to avoid the Dyaks. However, the pirates detected their presence, leading to a tense confrontation.

"""No need to hide now,"" said Van der Kemp calmly. ""We must paddle swiftly for safety. Nigel, if you must use your weapons, do so sparingly. Moses knows my stance on this and needs no reminder. Taking life is easy; only God can give it.""""They are strong and numerous,"" said the hermit. ""They might catch up in calm waters, but a rapid ahead will slow them down and us as well. If we reach it, we'll be safe.""Moses heard the cheers and the approaching rapid. Glancing back, he saw a boat with a figure in the bow closing in. Suddenly, the figure fell back with a crash and a yell, causing chaos. The canoe navigated the rapid skillfully, using eddies to advance. The hermit devised a plan to outsmart their pursuers by carrying the canoe over land spits to gain distance quickly. After crossing the land spits and creating a significant gap between them and their enemies, they stopped for the night.

Moses thanked Nigel and shared food with him to pass on to their master. They settled down for the night on the boat, with Nigel accidentally touching Van der Kemp's head, waking him up. The monkey, Spinkie, usually nestled with Moses, observed his human friends as they emerged from their resting places. The group continued their journey inland without much rest, noticing the changing landscape from swampy regions to lush forests.

"Nigel extended his hand, shaking the naturalist's hand warmly, marking the beginning of a true friendship. The professor was pleased to discover Nigel's shared interest in his favorite studies. ""We will hunt and study together, my friend,"" he declared. As they conversed, a hermit named Van der Kemp interrupted, warning them of a conspiracy against the Rajah, a mutual friend. The naturalist, deeply loyal, insisted on staying to study butterflies but vowed to stand by the Rajah if needed. Nigel, showing support, offered to accompany him. The Dyak youth and Moses prepared food as they discussed their unusual passion for studying insects. The next day, Nigel ventured into the forest with Verkimier and the Dyak youth, marveling at the lush vegetation and unique flora, including the majestic tree-fern and exotic fruit trees.

Go,"" the professor said to the Dyak youth, ""tell your chief we will come. Better luck next time!"" The next morning, they set out at daybreak. The landscape had transformed into hilly terrain. Dyak villages dotted the hilltops, and rice fields lined their path. They crossed gullies and rivulets using bamboo bridges.

The hunters had a thrilling encounter with an orangutan in the forest. After Professor Verkimier fired his rifle, a large orangutan was hit but managed to move swiftly through the trees. The hunters had to run to keep up. The orangutan showed intelligence by choosing secure tree branches and thick foliage to avoid being shot. Eventually, the creature stopped on a tree, and the hunters took their chance to shoot. Despite multiple shots, the orangutan continued to evade them until it was fatally wounded by Van der Kemp. The hunters were surprised by the orangutan's strength and how quietly it moved. In a dramatic moment, the orangutan attacked Gurulam, a Dyak youth, but was stopped by Van der Kemp's swift action, saving Gurulam's life.|"['1.

The hunt abruptly ended, and preparations began to transport the wounded man and two orangutans to the Dyak village. Bamboo poles quickly turned into a litter for carrying them. The large orangutan, though not tall, was broad and massive. The professor measured it, finding no broken bones on Gurulam. Nigel, with some surgical knowledge, tended to his wounds. While Moses cooked dinner, Van der Kemp and Nigel explored the stream. They spotted a well-fed orangutan eating shoots, a behavior unusual when not starving. The orangutan surprised them by bringing a Durian fruit. As they watched, a crocodile attacked the orangutan, and a fierce struggle ensued, with the orangutan eventually emerging victorious.|['1.

The villagers where the hunters stayed were amazed by the sight of white men, staring as if watching strange creatures. Despite their curiosity, they were kind and offered food generously. The village women adorned themselves with brass rings and wore unique attire. The hunters learned about a pirate threat led by Baderoon, causing concern for their safety. Nigel's friend, Van der Kemp, showed a mix of anxiety and determination upon hearing about the pirate. Van der Kemp decided to flee to Sumatra to avoid a confrontation with Baderoon, seeking safety on a trader's boat.

Van der Kemp devised a plan to reach Sumatra. He intended to navigate through the islands until he could meet a friend who would transport his canoe back to Sumatra. Despite the risks of being pursued by pirates, they set out on their journey, navigating through the sea with Spinkie, the loyal companion, secretly on board.

After spending days preparing and packing provisions, each member of the party carried a load based on their strength. The professor, known for chasing insects, reluctantly accepted the lightest load. They reached a rocky eminence offering a view of a dense forest where they intended to stay. The hermit, familiar with the area, led them down a forest road to a nearby village. The forest was filled with magnificent trees, some reaching up to eighty feet without branches, while others were entangled with creepers. The hermit shared a story of narrowly escaping a tiger attack. The group was warmly welcomed by the natives of Sumatra and treated to a splendid supper in a bamboo and wicker-work building.

In a region teeming with birds, beasts, and insects, the professor and his companions decided to spend a few days. The village chief provided a new house for their stay, with a youth named Grogo as their guide. The professor was pleased that the house was on the village outskirts, allowing him to focus on his work undisturbed. By opening his window at night, he attracted moths and other insects. However, the room soon became overrun, forcing his companions to retreat. Despite some mishaps, including a lamp crash, the professor's enthusiasm for his work remained unshaken.

"""It's amazing how little we truly understand the thoughts of others,"" remarked the hermit with a gentle smile. ""Revenge has no place in my heart. Thank you, young one, for your kindness and bravery. My life holds little value, but your efforts are appreciated. However, I must stay.

The vivid imagination of the man led to a burst of laughter, startling a monkey nearby. Nigel left to write an important letter while the group reached a village to a grand welcome due to the professor's reputation with a rifle against tigers. Despite their journey being possibly stalked by tigers, they arrived safely. The forest was rich in colors despite small flowers. They encountered a unique animal, the Siamang, with a bag under its throat to produce sounds. The professor almost shot it, but the hermit stopped him, emphasizing the need to move on. The hermit's resolve led the group forward despite objections. At the village, a banquet awaited them, but a recent tiger attack had dampened spirits.

He observed the surroundings, adjusted the rifle, and waited for darkness. As night fell, Nigel felt eerie and saw movement near the grave. He thought it might be a tiger but dismissed the idea. He felt uncomfortable, thinking of ghosts, although he didn't believe in them. A mournful wail broke the silence, making Nigel shiver. Eventually, he realized it was a mourning ritual.

A man named Nigel found himself in a perilous situation when he woke up to a tiger creeping towards him. Startled by the sudden appearance of the tiger, he managed to shoot a giant arrow at the beast just as it crossed a boundary line. The wounded tiger roared and leaped over a fence into the jungle.

Nigel was determined to continue his journey to reunite his father and a mysterious woman named Kathleen.

A group of monkeys played in the trees, led by a bold leader who took daring leaps to test his companions. Some monkeys hesitated, unable to make the jump until one bravely followed. Little pink-face monkey with a twisted tail was left behind, scared to jump. The others returned to watch and encourage it. After two failed attempts, pink-face gathered courage, leaped, and missed, falling to the ground. The professor, admiring the monkey's bravery, chose not to harm it. Suddenly, a hermit pointed out a rare Argus pheasant, captivating the professor's attention.

The professor crouched low, trying to blend in, with his hat pushed back and blue glasses making him look like a seal. Carrying a butterfly net and rifle, they watched two Argus pheasants, the male stunningly adorned. The male clears a circle to display his beauty to the female. Crossing a river on a fallen tree, they entered a dense forest with metallic tiger-beetles and butterflies. The path was a tunnel through rattan-palms with sharp hooks. They faced obstacles like a giant mud hole and a fallen tree, but overcame them. The professor spoke of day-flying moss and creatures mimicking others for protection. The hermit teased Moses about pretending when scared, but Moses denied it, saying he shows his fear openly.|['1.

The path deteriorated as they ventured further, becoming hilly and rugged, with swampy areas. Rain fell, and darkness enveloped them, far from the village they sought. Exhausted porters urged to press on due to the wet ground and leeches. Night fell, thickening darkness with distant rumblings hinting at a storm. Forced to camp, a fire was lit to ward off tigers and elephants. Matches failed, and the hermit suspected volcanic activity. Mysterious lights appeared, unsettling the professor, though Van der Kemp reassured it was harmless phosphoric light. The exhausted porters slept despite the dangers. The forest lit up with phosphorescence, revealing a mesmerizing scene of glowing creatures.

The professor cherished the spark, wrapping it carefully in dry bamboo scrapings as if it were the essence of his life. With tender breaths, he fanned the spark, revealing his huge eyes glowing with hope as it burst into a flame. The blaze scattered darkness, bringing joy to the group. Exhausted, they decided to spend the night there. The professor, determined to shoot the prowling tiger, was armed with a rifle, revolver, and a knife. He dug a hole near the goat, waiting for the tiger. As darkness fell, he lay in wait, confident in his plan. The night was dark, but the goat's reflection in the pond was visible.

A brave man, Verkimier, faced a tiger in the jungle. His plan to shoot it failed when the tiger approached from an unexpected direction. With the tiger dangerously close, he couldn't use his rifle. Quick thinking led him to fire his revolver upwards, hitting the tiger in the throat. The wounded tiger fell into the pit, blocking Verkimier's escape. Fearing the tiger might revive and attack, he fired again to end its suffering. The loud shots made him lose consciousness.

Van der Kemp quickly grabbed the python by the tail and tossed it away, unveiling the scientist beneath, unharmed but disheveled and deaf from a gun explosion. The following day, the professor, unable to hear, retired to bed while Van der Kemp skinned the tiger. As the professor dreamt of tigers, Moses entertained himself with imitating growls, leading to a comical incident where the professor startled awake, mistaking a python above him for a tiger. With quick thinking, Van der Kemp used a pole to remove the snake, but the professor's attempt to swing the python failed, resulting in a chaotic struggle until Nigel and Moses intervened, ultimately ending the python's life.

The story takes us to a mountainous region where the professor's ankle injury led to the use of a pony for travel. As they reached a volcano crater, the group witnessed a fascinating natural phenomenon. The crater held a basin of hot mud, which suddenly erupted, creating a spectacular sight with steam and noise. The native porters were terrified by the volcanic activity, while Moses, familiar with such events, remained unfazed. He even played a prank on the porters, causing them to flee in fear. Despite the dramatic eruption, the mud-lake settled back calmly, ready for its next cycle of activity. The group experienced the power and unpredictability of nature in the presence of the active volcano.|"['1.

That night our group camped near the volcano, enjoying a meal of roasted birds cooked over a steamy crevice. They fell asleep to the geyser's rumble, echoing in their dreams. The pleasant weather briefly distracted them from thoughts of danger. The professor, occupied with catching insects, added to the peaceful atmosphere. However, Nigel suspected volcanic activity nearby. Over dinner in a wood-cutter's hut, they discussed the possibility. Van der Kemp considered relocating due to recent volcanic eruptions. The professor advised caution, likening potential disasters to earthly and celestial explosions. Despite the allure of the island's beauty, the professor decided to stay put. The group bid farewell and continued their journey to the southern coast of Sumatra, where signs of volcanic activity became more apparent. Witnessing a volcanic event, they decided to move on, encountering a mysterious traveler who led them to a treacherous mud spring.|"['1.

Nigel and the stranger followed closely behind the native guide, eager to reach the central pond. But the guide suddenly stopped, warning that it was unsafe to go further. In an instant, the ground collapsed beneath him, and he fell into a chasm emitting sulfuric steam. Nigel, overwhelmed but determined, tried to help but was pulled back by the hermit just in time. The stranger's scream as he vanished was chilling. Witnessing such a tragedy left Nigel and his companions in shock, barely able to focus on anything. As they neared Sumatra, they learned that the volcanic activity was from Krakatoa, erupting after centuries of dormancy.

Telok Betong, a town severely affected by the 1883 eruption, sits at the entrance of Lampong Bay, opposite Krakatoa Island, about forty to fifty miles away. The town, nestled on a narrow strip of land at the foot of a steep mountain near the sea, serves as the main town of the Lampong Residency, the southernmost province of Sumatra. The population is a mix of natives, Chinese, Arabs, and traders from various islands like Borneo and New Guinea. The town's houses are built in a picturesque irregularity due to everyone's unique designs. The hermit reunited with his faithful monkey, Spinkie, who guarded the canoe.

He looks at it for hours and kisses it when he thinks no one is watching."" As they prepared to leave, the hermit arrived, and they set off in their canoe towards Rakata island. The journey was perilous, with Krakatoa's fiery eruptions casting an eerie glow over the horizon. Upon reaching the island, they found the boat wrecked under lava, unable to salvage any belongings.

A strange sensation enveloped the three friends inside the cave, where the loud noises from outside transformed into a deep, continuous groan. Additional sounds rose from the cave's crevices, likely from subterranean fires below. The hermit, unfazed, retrieved papers and a photograph case from a box. He reassured his companions that the lack of smoke or sulfur smell indicated safety from the active volcano's wrath. Despite the growing rain of stones and lava outside, they hesitated to leave the cave due to the violent eruption. The view outside was obscured by smoke and dust, with debris falling around them. With no immediate escape, they retreated to the cave, where they waited and prepared a meal.

It didn't occur to them that the spot they were on was vulnerable to the dangerous fluid darting among the smoke and steam. A loud report drew their attention back to the scene. The summit of Perboewatan exploded into pieces, crackling as they shot upwards. The sound was like musketry in a battle. Lava spewed out, setting everything ablaze. The island seemed to be consumed by fire. Suddenly, a spout of liquid fire erupted, followed by a deafening roar. They were dragged to safety as the tempest of smoke and ashes swept towards them.

Captain Roy, a phlegmatic and self-contained man, found himself embroiled in a delicate mission at the Keeling Islands. His son had sent him to investigate if a hermit was Kathleen Holbein's father. The hermit's status was uncertain, and Kathleen's self-appointed guardians were wary of letting her hopes soar. Captain Roy, though not adept at diplomacy, agreed to undertake the mission discreetly. He planned to take Kathleen to Anjer under the guise of visiting an old friend, ensuring her health and safety. The captain's son had not disclosed the situation to the hermit to avoid false hopes. The captain and Mrs. Holbein decided to keep Kathleen in the dark, maintaining a sense of mystery and caution to prevent disappointment.|"[""1.

Captain Roy used his persuasive skills to address the Holbein objections and convince the girl, Kathleen, to embark on the _Sunshine_ towards Sunda Straits. Despite the impending danger from the erupting Krakatoa, Captain Roy's concern was to communicate honestly with Kathleen about the journey. He valued her qualities and believed in the potential love between her and his son, Nigel. As they sailed closer to Krakatoa, the violent explosions and falling debris instilled fear. Captain Roy ensured Kathleen's safety below deck as the volcanic eruptions intensified, enveloping the surroundings in darkness and fiery glows. The escalating eruptions were heard miles away, causing widespread alarm and disturbances, even in distant cities like Batavia. The continuous explosions rattled the region, creating a menacing atmosphere as nature's forces clashed.|"['1.

Captain Watson of the _Charles Bal_, who was just 10 miles south of the volcano, compared the sounds to artillery discharges. However, ordinary language falls short in describing such extraordinary sounds. The crackling noise was likely due to fragments impacting the atmosphere. The hermit and Nigel were stunned on the ledge of Rakata and heard these sounds. The brig _Sunshine_ approached the island around 5 p.m., but the commotion and darkness made the captain fear continuing the voyage. Warm pumice rained down on the deck, causing no harm due to its light nature. The sky lit up with lightning, painting the clouds as if they were a massive pine-tree. Kathleen found the spectacle splendid, unfazed by the danger. Mud rain fell on the deck, followed by iron cinders. Explosions continued through the night, with the sky alternating between darkness and light. The Krakatoa volcano, close to sea-level, had its safety valves blown away, allowing the sea to rush in and trigger grand explosions.|"[""1.

The molten lava from the volcano cooled as the water rushed in, creating a solid crust at the vent's mouth. The volcano was like a closed boiler, ready to burst. The pressure built up, and on that fateful night, Krakatoa exploded. The explosions occurred at 5:30, 6:44, 10:02, and 10:52 in the morning, causing devastating waves. The crew on the ship noticed the impending danger and prepared for the waves. During the chaos, the captain found his son injured on the ship after a wave hit their canoe.

Captain David Roy's plans were thwarted by the hermit who regained consciousness just as he was being carried to the cabin door. The cabin was dimly lit, adding to the chaos around. Van der Kemp, the hermit, mistook his rescuers for enemies and reacted by standing his ground. He was relieved to see Captain Roy, but still disoriented. Meanwhile, Kathleen, a girl on board, was visibly shaken and stood frozen in the cabin. Despite attempts to keep her away, she ventured out and faced the hermit. As the crew dealt with mud falling from a nearby volcano, the hermit joined in, radiating a sense of peace and joy.

Spinkie, the monkey, found refuge on the mizzen shrouds during the chaos. In the midst of darkness, he saw his old friend, Moses. With a bound, Spinkie leaped towards Moses, clinging to him tightly. As the volcano raged, the crew prepared for the worst. The captain suspected they were near Anjer and feared the damage from the waves. The sea was filled with debris and bodies, a grim aftermath of the disaster. The hermit warned of another imminent explosion and advised cutting the cable to seek refuge near the shore.

"During the tense moments that followed, the hermit returned to Winnie and Nigel on the quarter-deck. He spoke quietly with Nigel while drawing Winnie close with a reassuring arm. Captain Roy took hold of the wheel, and the crew stood ready at their posts for any action required.

""Wait for orders before acting, no matter what occurs,"" Captain Roy commanded in a commanding voice that carried across the ship, even through the storm and the volcanic activity. A sense of impending disaster hung over everyone.

""Winnie, my dear,"" the hermit said gently, leaning down to look at her face. ""I fear another explosion is imminent, but take solace in knowing that no harm will come without His permission. He will guide us.""

Suddenly, a deafening crash and a massive eruption of smoke, fire, and lava shook the ship. Witnesses described the terrifying spectacle as the volcano unleashed its full fury. The eruption obliterated two-thirds of the island, claiming thousands of lives.

As a colossal wave approached in the darkness, the crew braced for impact. Their only chance was to ride the wave stern first, hoping to avoid being capsized.

The volcano suddenly erupted for the fourth time, not as violent as before but still terrifying. The explosion revealed the mountains of Java ahead and a monstrous wave rushing behind them. Captain Roy steered the vessel straight into the wave, climbing its towering side. Nigel helped the injured Van der Kemp as Winnie took the wheel. The brig rode the massive wave, passing over the demolished town of Anjer. Nigel was amazed that no survivors were visible.

On went the boat _Sunshine_, amid chaos and destruction, on its peculiar journey across land and sea until a sudden halt was felt. It wasn't the anticipated crash or an abrupt stop. Initially, there was a hissing and scraping noise against the boat's sides, followed by a gradual slowdown that strained the rigging. Back-stays snapped, the foretopsail ripped with a loud bang, and then a deafening tearing sound signified the loss of both masts. Despite the relative calm that followed, water still surged beneath them, the wind blew strangely, and unfamiliar scents filled the air. The people of Anjer experienced the catastrophic 27th of August with a massive wave that engulfed the town, leading to immense destruction and loss of life.

"On a particular day, a significant event occurred in Batavia. The gas lights were abruptly extinguished, causing the pictures on the walls to shake as if there was an earthquake. However, this disturbance was not due to seismic activity but rather the air-wave produced by Krakatoa. The ensuing noise was described as ""deafening."" The impact of these explosions was felt across great distances, with various regions mistakenly interpreting the sounds. For instance, in Java, the noises were mistaken for a vessel in distress, prompting rescue efforts. Even as far as South Australia, the explosions were heard, awakening people and prompting reports.

The massive sea-waves, ranging from 50 to 135 feet, resulted from the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. Islands and headlands lessened their impact, but they still caused havoc worldwide. In the Java sea, the waves traveled 450 miles, affecting even the Indian Ocean and English Channel. At Galle, Ceylon, a unique tidal event with waves up to 8 feet 10 inches was observed. Fishermen seized the moment to harvest stranded fish, only to be driven away by the returning sea. Sharks were displaced, and the dust from the eruption circled the globe for months, creating stunning skies.

The event on November 29th was truly spectacular. The sky displayed a magnificent and diverse show of colors that left a lasting impression. As the sun set, a yellow bow appeared in the south, rising rapidly and extending across the sky towards the zenith. Sailors identified it as the Northern Lights, shining in all its splendor. The sky transformed into shades of purple and red, creating a magical atmosphere. The dust from Krakatoa, examined under a microscope, revealed tiny glassy particles with air bubbles and crystals. These particles, carried high into the atmosphere, reflected sunlight in various hues, creating a mesmerizing display.

Nigel was struck by two new ideas, realizing Winnie's father would be part of their future household if she was to be its main feature. Another odd thought was having a servant and a monkey attendant. The group landed near a cave on Rakata mountain, split in half by a volcanic eruption. They observed the vast changes caused by the explosion, with islands disappearing and new ones emerging. Winnie faced challenges navigating the pumice-covered terrain, but Nigel carried her through the rugged path. Despite Moses joking about Winnie being mistaken for a butterfly, Nigel swiftly picked her up, showing his strength.|"['Question 1:\nWhat struck Nigel in the text passage?\nA) The sight of islands disappearing\nB) The idea of having a servant and a monkey attendant\nC) The split cave on Rakata mountain\nD) Moses joking about Winnie\nE) The challenges of navigating pumice-covered terrain', 'Question 2:\nWhere did the group land near in the text?\nA) A lush forest\nB) A volcanic eruption\nC) A river\nD) A cave on Rakata mountain\nE) A deserted island', 'Question 3:\nWho faced challenges navigating the pumice-covered terrain?\nA) Nigel\nB) Moses\nC) Winnie\nD) The servant\nE) The monkey attendant', 'Question 4:\nHow did Nigel help Winnie through the rugged path?\nA) By joking about her being mistaken for a butterfly\nB) By carrying her\nC) By navigating the terrain himself\nD) By disappearing into the cave\nE) By finding a new island', ""Question 5:\nWhat did Moses joke about in the text passage?\nA) The disappearing islands\nB) The split cave\nC) Winnie being mistaken for a butterfly\nD) The monkey attendant\nE) Nigel's strength"", ""Question 6:\nWhat did Nigel's actions show in the text passage?\nA) His fear of volcanoes\nB) His love for islands\nC) His respect for pumice-covered terrain\nD) His strength\nE) His navigation skills""]"|['B) The idea of having a servant and a monkey attendant', 'D) A cave on Rakata mountain', 'C) Winnie', 'B) By carrying her', 'C) Winnie being mistaken for a butterfly', 'D) His strength']

With beads of worry dripping down his face, the hermit let out a loud cheer. Nigel sighed deeply, finding relief, but Winnie stayed put, understanding her father's peril better. The descent was trickier than the climb. The hermit reappeared and began the slow journey back. The tension eased as they saw the ledges were wider than they seemed. Yet, a rockslide startled them. Van der Kemp stood on a narrow ledge, separated from them by a sheer rock face. Nigel tried to reach out to help but couldn't. Moses suggested a risky plan to save the hermit by swinging him towards safety. Despite the perilous situation, Van der Kemp remained calm, accepting his fate.|"[""1.

With closed eyes, the hermit silently prayed, then braced his shoulders against the cliff to prevent himself from falling towards his friend. Their outstretched hands nearly touched before finally clasping. Nigel let out a shout as the hermit swung off, barely catching the edge of the cliff. The hermit yelled for Moses not to let him go as he struggled to regain his hold. Moses, despite his pain, held on until the hermit secured a grip on the ledge. After the rescue, Moses found his leg stuck and broken. They carried him down to the boat, where Winnie, relieved but exhausted, helped tend to Moses.
