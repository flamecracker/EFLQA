"Listen, dear. Beacon wouldn't enjoy going. We could not get for him the food to which he is accustomed, nor would they admit him to the picture galleries which we shall visit. I doubt if he would even care for the gondolas.""

""No, I'm sure he would not like the gondolas,"" admitted Jean smiling faintly, ""because Hannah and I tried him on the swan-boats in the Public Garden and he hated them; he just barked and snarled all the time, and wriggled about so in my arms that he nearly went overboard and carried me with him.""

"Hannah had a strict standard, judging every experience by Boston norms. To her, anything different was ""ridiculous."" Jean, however, found joy in every moment of the voyage. She loved being at sea, playing shuffle-board and exploring with Uncle Bob. When they reached Gibraltar and saw Spain, Africa, and Italy, Jean was in awe, feeling like she was living a dream. Rushing to Florence, they briefly stopped in Naples. There, Jean marveled at the Naples Vase, an ancient piece from Pompeii.

From Naples, Uncle Bob swiftly took his puzzled companions to Rome and then to Florence. While he handled his business, Hannah and Jean were under the care of a guide who showed them countless paintings and churches. Hannah grew weary of the endless masterpieces and spires, wishing only for an east wind and baked beans. However, upon arriving in Venice and seeing their first gondola, even Hannah had to admit its beauty surpassed the Boston swan-boats. At night, they arrived at a platform where gondolas floated, lit by twinkling lights. Uncle Bob hired a gondolier, and the group glided through the moonlit canals. Jean was thrilled by the novelty, eager to explore every corner. As they prepared for a gondola ride, Jean's excitement was palpable, eager to experience the magic of Venice's waterways.|"['1.

When Uncle Bob learned of Jean's exciting journey, he wasted no time in seeking out Giusippe Cicone. A message was dispatched to Murano, requesting the boy's presence at the hotel. The following day, a festival day with the glass works closed, Giusippe arrived after breakfast. He was modestly dressed but neat, with a face that exuded honesty and warmth, instantly earning Mr. Cabot's favor. Giusippe, with his handsome features, thick brown hair, hazel eyes, and sun-kissed olive complexion, carried himself with grace and pride. He shared the rich history of glass-making in Venice, highlighting the legacy of his family in the craft. Giusippe explained the esteemed status of glass-makers in Venice, their guilds, and the meticulous skills required for different glass products.

In the past, the Venetians guarded their glass-making secrets with absolute loyalty. Giusippe explained that those who tried to take these secrets elsewhere faced severe consequences. They were warned to return to Venice, and if they refused, their relatives were imprisoned. If the disloyalty continued, the person was tracked down and killed. This strict rule ensured that the art of glass-making remained exclusive to Venice, leading to the city's prosperity. The Venetians became renowned for their glass, with a thriving trade that included sending beads to places like Africa and India. The popularity of Venetian glass even reached foreign lands, with a prince causing a stir by wearing curls made of finely spun black glass in Paris. The story of Venetian glass-making was cherished by the people, but some Venetians betrayed their city by selling secrets for personal gain, spreading the art to France and Germany. Despite this, the Venetians' early mirrors, though crude by today's standards, were considered marvels in a time when reflections were seen in water sources or polished metal.|"['1.

During the 1600s, Venetians experimented with glass mirrors, backing them with mercury or tin. The process involved covering the surface with tinfoil, smoothing it down, and then coating it with quicksilver to create an amalgam with tin. These mirrors were set in elaborate frames of glass, silver, wood, and more. Venetian nobles often gifted them to royalty, but there were quarrels between glass-makers and mirror-framers. In 1600, the French stole the mirror-making secret, leading to the decline of Venetian artisans. Some mirrors are now in museums. French glass-making was aided by penniless Huguenot gentlemen. Colbert, under Louis XIV, bribed Venetian workmen to make mirrors for France, leading to France and Germany mastering mirror-making. Despite this, Venice remains renowned for its filigree and spun glass craftsmanship.|['1. What was the process involved in making glass mirrors during the 1600s?\nA.

In the past, mosaic makers played a crucial role in art by inspiring the creation of stained-glass windows. In Venice, these artisans transitioned to crafting exquisite Venetian glass. One notable figure, Radi, along with Dr. Salviati, revitalized Venice's glory by replicating ancient glasswork like Arab lamps and mosaic pictures. While Salviati's smooth mosaics differed from the traditional San Marco mosaics, both held artistic value. The durability of mosaics, exemplified by Pope Urban's preservation efforts, ensures their lasting beauty. Giusippe, intrigued by the artistry, dreams of exploring these wonders someday. Mr. Cabot recognizes Giusippe's potential and offers him a chance to journey to the United States, believing in his ability to succeed. This opportunity could open doors for Giusippe to thrive and contribute during the trip.|"['1.

The pots in the glass-making process are like a lottery. Sometimes they last for months, serving well, while other times they break on the first use, causing chaos. Ladling out the melted glass carefully is crucial to avoid upsetting other pots. The raw material is charged solidly, but as it melts, it shrinks, requiring refilling after ten to twelve hours. The temperature must be high enough to melt the glass immediately to prevent imperfections. Crude oil is used as fuel to avoid specking the glass. Impurities are skimmed off after the glass is in a fluid state, a process called plaining. The glass is then cooled and refined before being blown into shapes. The glass-blower collects the right amount of glass on a blowpipe to make a pitcher, then blows it into shape with incredible speed. The glass is shaped, reheated, and handles are added swiftly before being baked.|['1.

"""In glassmaking, the process of annealing is crucial to prevent glass from breaking due to exposure to heat or cold. The glass is placed in an oven after being formed, and gradually cooled to strengthen it. This is necessary because glass is very brittle and sensitive to temperature changes. The annealing kiln ensures that both the inside and outside of hollow glassware cool simultaneously to avoid fractures caused by temperature differences. A lehr, a type of oven, is used in some factories for quicker and more controlled cooling. Each group of workers in a glass factory specializes in making specific glass items, like pitchers or vases. Once the glass is annealed, it undergoes inspection, packing, and shipping. Imperfections are checked by dipping the glass in water and examining it under light. Complex designs are shaped using moulds and blown into the desired form by skilled workers."""|['1.

Glass cutting is a skilled craft where designs are etched onto heavy crystal using white outlines. The cutter then uses an emery wheel to grind out the patterns, with wet sand cooling the wheel to prevent overheating. After cutting, rough edges are smoothed on a fine-grained stone. Jean was captivated watching the cutters at work, gaining a clearer understanding of the process. Excited about visiting Pittsburgh, Jean anticipates seeing Beacon and Uncle Tom, while Giusippe looks forward to his new job at Mr. Curtis's factory. They discuss their upcoming trip to New York, where they will meet Miss Cartright and visit a stained glass window studio.

In a large room, glass-blowers were hard at work by the furnaces. Each glass-blower had a wooden staging over a pit in the floor, opposite a furnace opening. The staging allowed them to swing the glass mass as they blew it, while the pit provided space for the glass to grow longer. The process began with gathering a lump of glass on a pipe, cooling it, and collecting more until there was enough. The blower then expanded the glass on a hollowed wooden block before starting to shape it. The blower constantly blew air into the glass to maintain its shape. The blower's skill determined the glass's thickness and size. The process involved reheating the glass, swinging it, and blowing air into it until it formed a cylinder. Thicker glass cylinders were opened using hot metal or scissors after air was forced inside.|"['1.

In a glass factory, a cylinder is crafted by detaching it from a blowpipe. The glass is then split open using a diamond point, creating a flat sheet. The sheet is then heated, flattened on a stone, and smoothed by a worker using a polissoir. After cooling, the glass is inspected and categorized based on quality. The best pieces are polished to make patent glass. The process involves blowing cylinders, opening, flattening, and annealing them quickly. Larger sheets are harder to handle and prone to breakage. Crown glass, used for bull's eye windows, is made differently and has a brilliant surface but yields smaller pieces due to a central defect. The factory tour continues to the plate glass department for further exploration.|"['1.

Before you leave, you need to know that plate glass is different from other types of glass. It is not blown but poured onto an iron table to cool, like molasses candy. In the room, there are annealing ovens on each side, and a casting table in the center on wheels. The molten glass from the furnaces is taken to this table, lifted by a crane, and poured out. The thickness is controlled by iron strips. The glass must be finished quickly while hot to avoid flaws. Rough plate glass is used where light is needed but not transparency, like in office doors or skylights. To make it into polished plate glass, it must be ground with sand, emery stone, and water, then polished with rouge. Wired glass with embedded wire is used for strength and safety. Making a perfect sheet of polished plate glass is a meticulous process requiring care from beginning to end.|['1.

It's great to have a busy life, but the toll it takes on the nerves can be harsh.""""I can't say for sure. These cases are tricky. What he really needs is rest--to take a break from work and stay at home. Engage him in activities like reading, going for drives, walking, keep him entertained. These things will benefit him more than medicine.""""Do you really think I can be of help here?"" the girl asked in surprise. ""Uncle Tom doesn't--you're saying he _needs_ me; that I could make a difference by staying?"" A blush colored her cheeks. The thought of being needed was unbelievable.

"""No, dear. I wasn't asleep. I can't sleep these days. Last night, I heard the clock strike almost every hour. It's been like this for a while. I can't remember the last time I had a full night's rest. As soon as I go to bed, my mind races over everything I've done during the day. There's no peace, no stopping it.""

""We'll make it better, dear. Don't worry, Uncle Tom. The doctor says you're just a little tired, and he'll give you medicine to help you feel better. You need to stay home and rest. Tomorrow, you'll have breakfast in bed, and later, when it's sunny and warm, I'll take you for a nice motor ride.""

""I decided it myself. Would I leave you just when you're here at home and have time to entertain me? No way! Now that you're not busy, we'll do lots of fun things. We'll go on motor rides, see places, walk, and read books together. We'll have a great time.""

""I'm glad you're staying, little girl. It would be hard if you left now. I'd miss you, but if I have to be home, I can't bear to have you gone.""
