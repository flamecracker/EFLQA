While passing through the low country, the youth realized the necessity of being armed. He admitted that weapons were unfamiliar and distasteful to him, preferring his trusty cudgel. The conversation turned to the likelihood of soldiers coming to the hills for plunder. The ruins of his childhood home stood as a stark reminder of the devastation caused by war. The troops had ransacked the place, leaving behind destruction and desolation.

They quickly arrived at a gap in the bushes by the road and spotted a small wooden hut at the end of a clearing. Young Armstrong guided them towards it.

Young Armstrong was content with the information he received. He didn't feel the need to pry into others' business, much like Pedro. Armstrong, being open and trusting, accepted his companion's words despite his reserved demeanor. He shared that he had unexpectedly taken over his father's sugar mill after his passing, without prior knowledge of the business. His father had intended to retire on his fortune, leaving Armstrong uninformed about the mill's operations. Pedro suggested that Armstrong's father might have had money in a bank. Pedro, heading to Buenos Ayres, offered to guide Armstrong there. Pedro explained his duty to escort a girl to her father, a chief near Buenos Ayres, due to a debt of gratitude.

In times of war, it's hard to avoid deserters and troublemakers. Nearby, there are outlaws like Conrad of the Mountains.

Suddenly, his companion aims a pistol at the hut's doorway. They see a pair of intense eyes, gleaming teeth, and dark lips. Pedro hesitates to shoot as the eyes belong to a black man approaching unarmed. The man, Quashy, recognizes Lawrence and laments his late arrival. Quashy's father was a freed servant from Kentucky.

Lawrence expressed hope that if they encountered the feared bandit, he would be friendly. Riding ahead to inquire about their location, Lawrence signaled to Pedro that he was done conversing. Pedro understood and reined back his mule. Not a native of Scotland, Lawrence pointed out the farm where they would spend the night, nestled in a narrow, gloomy valley. As they journeyed through varied landscapes post crossing the Andes, they observed rocky barren lands and fertile areas with farms. Pedro noted that bandits often lurked in such places, camouflaged as honest men. Discussing a notorious man named Conrad, Lawrence expressed reluctance towards taking a life, even if deserved. They reached a farm where a sick stranger, possibly robbed, was being cared for. The man was gravely ill, likely due to exposure and fever from injuries sustained during a robbery. Lawrence found the man in a dilapidated hut, in critical condition.|"['1.

Lawrence recognized the robber Antonio at first sight but kept his knowledge hidden. He pretended not to know him and offered him soup. The robber, surprised and alarmed, recognized Lawrence but remained composed. As Lawrence listened to the man's false story, he felt disgust at first but later pitied him due to his weakness and fear. Lawrence comforted the man, which was more effective than medicine. A storm trapped them in the mountain hut, where Lawrence cared for the patient and tried to guide him towards a better path.

Pedro turned to inspect the mules' fastenings, inspiring confidence in Lawrence with his calm demeanor. As they rode, Lawrence pondered the source of this trust. Was it Pedro's self-assurance, truthfulness, or modesty? Perhaps a mix. Suddenly, the girl pointed to a breathtaking view of mountains, cliffs, and a roaring river below.

As he spoke, one of the baggage-mules accidentally nudged the cliff with its load, causing it to lose balance. Despite its hind-legs hanging over the edge, the mule valiantly clung on with its front hoofs, even appearing to hold on by its teeth. Two peons rushed to help, but the mule slipped and tumbled down the slope into the river with a splash. Miraculously, the mule resurfaced and struggled to reach the bank, eventually finding a shallow spot to stand and recover. Meanwhile, the party, with their colorful mules and lively peons, descended the winding path. The men, armed and initially wary, were relieved to find the travelers were not bandits.

As Lawrence reached the summit of the pass, a fierce storm loomed, closing in on the group. Struggling against the gale, Quashy's hat flew off, sparking a frantic chase. The hat, a prized possession, was more than it seemed, a valuable heirloom. Snow began to fall, thickening the air. Lawrence, worried about losing their way, offered his poncho to Manuela. The group pressed on, seeking shelter in a distant hut. The guide explained that these huts were havens against mountain storms. As they descended a steep slope, the blizzard hit with full force, swirling snow and fierce winds.

The loud noise from the blast covered the shout, but Lawrence noticed the hand wave and worried expression before the snow blocked his view. Urging his startled horse with Spanish spurs, he rode next to Manuela's mule, grabbed the reins, and pulled it forward. Despite the animal's resistance, the steep road aided them, and they safely descended. The hut, designed for a specific purpose, was sturdy against severe weather. Constructed of brick and mortar with a solid foundation, it stood about twelve feet high with an external brick staircase leading to the entrance. The living area was elevated above the snow, featuring a twelve-foot square room with a brick floor and arched roof. Dimly lit by small openings, the room lacked furniture except for charred wood remnants and a small pile of firewood left by previous travelers. Pedro, preparing for the night, mentioned the door's replacement and set up a screen for Manuela's sleeping area. Quashy built a warm fire, creating a cozy atmosphere with the smell of cooked food. The guide, Pedro, remained composed and unflappable, akin to a rock amidst tumultuous seas or a strong tower in any situation. While enjoying supper near the fire, Lawrence inquired about the hut's history, prompting Pedro to hint at the grim tales associated with the place.

During a political change in South America, Pedro was crossing the mountains. The region often faces turmoil during such transitions. Sometimes, governments engineer chaos to incite change. Despite having business on the western side of the Cordillera, Pedro turned back to aid his friends. He was informed that ten travelers were trapped by a fierce storm, risking their lives. Pedro, disheartened by the locals' cowardice, loaded his mules with supplies and set off alone. Eventually, three men joined him, and they found six of the travelers dead. The survivors, weakened by hunger and despair, were saved by Pedro's team. Pedro mentioned the Incas, an ancient civilization predating the conquest of Peru, with advanced architectural remains in their capital. One of the Incas, Manco Capac, was believed to be a figure of great influence, teaching the people various skills.|"[""1.

In ancient times, Manco Capac was believed to be the first Inca ruler, establishing the city of Cuzco. The Inca government was described as despotic yet benevolent, with a patriarchal style that endeared them to their subjects. Their civilization flourished, evidenced by impressive public works such as roads, bridges, and grand buildings. The Incas were known for their wealth, adorned with gold and silver, which they used to embellish temples and palaces. However, prosperity led to a desire for conquest, causing internal strife among the Incas, ultimately resulting in the arrival of the Spaniards in 1532 and the subsequent conquest of Peru.

In a secluded hut, Lawrence Armstrong pondered his belief that the Indian girl was a princess. He envisioned her in the ancient Inca capital, a princess with a unique beauty. The storm outside raged fiercely, snow swirling around the hut. The following day, the travelers awoke to a wintry scene, with snow covering the landscape. Despite the adverse conditions, they found solace in each other's company. As the storm subsided, Pedro assured them of better days ahead. They ventured out, guided by Pedro's knowledge of the terrain. Descending into warmer regions, they encountered hospitable locals and found comfort in their journey.

With this explanation, Lawrence had to be content, as Pedro seemed uninterested in further questions. Noticing Pedro's distant demeanor, Lawrence rode back to join Quashy.

One significant event in my life marked a turning point. While traveling with Gauchos one evening across La Plata's pampas, we encountered chaos at a post-house. Indians were in a scuffle outside. Witnessing this, most Gauchos pursued the fleeing Indians, ignoring a woman's distressing scream from inside. Peeking in, I saw an Indian attacking a man while a girl tried to stop him. Without hesitation, I intervened, striking the Indian. Sadly, the man was fatally wounded. The girl, Mariquita, lost her family in the brutal attack. I felt a deep connection to her and vowed to protect her. Over time, our bond grew, and I realized the importance of selflessness and compassion.

Despite the suffocating dust and smoke from fires in the ruined town, he heard voices nearby. Recognizing them as lawless individuals, he ceased calling out. Eventually, he managed to create an opening to the outside world, but his escape was hindered by a large beam and solid masonry. Looking out, he saw distant figures searching among the ruins.|"['1.

Leaving the main road to avoid the bands, a group followed a familiar path led by their guide. In the afternoon, they spotted a tired traveler struggling up the hill. He spoke of being robbed by a bandit named Conrad of the Mountains and sought help to reach his family in San Ambrosio, devastated by an earthquake.

Lawrence expressed regret at missing the chance to capture a bandit, wondering if it was Conrad of the Mountains. He believed the bandit was not Conrad due to his unkind behavior. The bandit was Fan, a notorious villain who led a group of criminals. Fan once attacked a convoy carrying silver, promising to spare lives but later killed them all. Although captured, the robbers escaped punishment due to government disputes. The scene shifts to Lawrence waking from a nap near a river, where he sees Manuela and a curious blue-bird. Quashy, with a swollen mouth, reveals it was the blue-bird's antics that startled Lawrence. Pedro explains the bird's loud calls were due to Manuela's beauty.

Parrots are abundant in the regions between the Atlantic and Pacific, often seen in large flocks. They are known for their loud, discordant voices that can annoy sensitive travelers. In South America, where parrots gather in trees, they flutter their wings, chatter loudly, and show off their colorful plumage. Despite their vibrant and gaudy breast feathers, their backs blend in with the environment. When startled, they shriek and reveal their bright chests before flying off. A flock of parrots once surprised our friends during a siesta, showcasing their vivid colors in the sunlight.

Before resting, the Indian girl knelt by her hammock and prayed. Her companions noticed this act of faith, with Lawrence even inquiring if she was a Christian. Pedro confirmed she was, but avoided further discussion. As dawn broke in Central South America, creatures stirred, singing praises to their Maker. The Indian hut was clean, a contrast to Tiger's tribe. Tiger's wife, Mrs. Tiger, was clean and pleasant-looking, unlike their unruly children. Quashy, a helpful man, invited Mrs. Tiger to breakfast. The sick little girl found comfort in Quashy's care. Lawrence examined her and expressed hope but noted the need for constant nursing. Since no one spoke the local dialect, he turned to Manuela to convey instructions. Manuela, feeling a connection to the girl, agreed to help with the child's care.|"['1.

"""Alright,"" he said, explaining to Manuela how to care for the sick. After the instructions, Manuela approached Tiger's wife with a warm smile, comforting her and feeding the sick child with alligator-ragout gravy. The child seemed content and nestled close to Manuela. Lawrence, noticing Manuela's tears, thought she must be an Inca princess known for kindness. Facing language barriers with the Indians, Lawrence used gestures and a monkey incident to communicate. The Indian grasped the message and demonstrated his archery skills. Despite struggles, they tried to convey ideas to the Indian, resorting to a dramatic play with a jaguar-skin and a spear, which amused the Indian.

Lawrence swiftly grabbed the pole thrown by Lawrence and charged at the jaguar, piercing its heart. Hurriedly, he picked up Tiger's bow and arrows, placed them in a small canoe, and launched it into the river. Waving with one hand while holding on with the other, the realization dawned on Tiger. With a dignified smile, he armed himself with a lance and bow, returning to the canoe. Lawrence armed himself with a shotgun and pistols, the negro following suit. As they paddled down the river, they marveled at the beautiful scenery. Towering trees, thick bushes, and various fruits surrounded them. Animal life abounded, with water-hens and wild-fowl in sight. Lawrence's goal was to hunt a jaguar, aiming to bring back its claws and skull. As they advanced cautiously, Quashy's excitement was palpable, contrasting Tiger's calm and focused demeanor.

Lawrence initially grabbed his fowling-piece, loaded with ball, but as time passed and the Indian didn't approach, he set the gun down and took up his paddle. The canoe had touched a mudbank, so Lawrence used one of the Indian's lances to push off. Suddenly, a jaguar leaped at the Indian, missing him and falling into the water. The jaguar tried to climb into the canoe, but Lawrence, using the lance, thrust it down the jaguar's throat, causing it to drown. They then paddled back to the Indian's hut. The Indian, recovering, expressed gratitude towards Lawrence. Lawrence assisted the injured Indian to rest, and the Indian's family showed joy at the jaguar's defeat. Despite Manuela's endearing smile, Lawrence struggled with his feelings due to her being a native woman.|"['1.

When they sat on the grass outside the hut with Manuela, who left her duty to eat, Quashy sighed and asked if Tiger would hunt the next day. Lawrence said no, fearing Tiger's return. They decided to leave early before Tiger woke up, having Manuela persuade him to stay. The next morning, Lawrence and Quashy rose before dawn, took a canoe, weapons, and a boy from the family. They explored the stream, and the boy shot a monkey with a blow-pipe. They found a timber structure and the boy set up a trap for an alligator.

Decided to please the boy, they landed and went with him into the forest. He expected them to do so and lead the way. He walked briskly ahead, carrying his bow. Lawrence was rewarded with a beautiful walk through stunning scenery. The trees formed long aisles and arches, some so orderly it seemed man-made. In other areas, the mix of plants seemed random, but Lawrence believed in a higher order. They saw tall ant-hills, colorful orchids hanging from trees, and encountered parrots, monkeys, tapirs, and jaguars. Lawrence was surprised by a large spider that snatched his hat.

After their simple meal, they headed back to the river. The young boy rushed ahead, signaling something exciting awaited them. Lawrence, not far behind, matched the boy's enthusiasm. They discovered an alligator, about six or seven feet long, had swallowed a monkey and was thrashing about wildly. With great strength, they managed to subdue the alligator and save the monkey. During this time, Lawrence also befriended the various pets in the household, including a tapir and a jaguar. On the third evening, as they sat around a fire, the jaguar suddenly attacked Manuela.

I found myself suddenly in the river, aware of the alligators lurking in the waters. Despite the fear, I swam vigorously towards the opposite bank, splashing to deter the predators. As I swam, a chilling sensation crept over me. Suddenly, I heard alarming sounds behind me. To my relief, it was my friend swimming towards me with a knife, realizing we could create a distraction together. We both reached the bank, narrowly escaping danger. My friend urged me to hurry as our foes prepared to pursue us in canoes. He revealed a hidden canoe, instructing me to navigate the rapid ahead. With his guidance, I paddled swiftly downstream, evading arrows and the chase behind me.

After their midday rest, the hunter's canoe landed near his father-in-law's home. The old man, dressed casually, warmly welcomed the family with their pets. Pedro declined the chief's offer to stay and they continued their journey in a larger, more comfortable canoe. Pedro relaxed on top of the cabin, smoking, while Tiger steered the craft effortlessly downstream. As the sun set, Pedro and Tiger discussed the foolishness of war and the greed of some white men. Tiger shared a story of how a surplus of spectacles was sold by forcing the indigenous people to wear them during festivals.

Pedro felt sorry for his friend's anger but couldn't help but smile at the absurd situation. The Indian misinterpreted his smile due to his upside-down mustache and a cigarette. Angrily, the Indian threw his spectacles into the river, declaring he was once a Christian but not anymore. His friend, Tiger, disagreed with his views on religion but acknowledged the mistreatment of Indians by the Spaniards. The Spanish exploited the rich mines in Peru, forcing Indians into slavery. The harsh conditions in the mines led to the death of many natives. The conquerors also abused trade, selling useless goods to the Indians. This cruelty towards the indigenous people has left a legacy of bitterness and suffering in South America.|"[""1.

The soldiers, miners, and governors set a bad example for the priests, who became greedy and abusive. One priest demanded extravagant gifts from his congregation, including thousands of animals and eggs, before he would perform mass. Another priest cruelly demanded a widow's son as payment for a burial fee. These acts of extortion and cruelty were not isolated incidents but were common for many years. Despite some good individuals, tyranny and injustice were rampant in Peru. Pedro expressed disappointment in the lack of unity and compassion among the people. The Indian, reflecting on the past, noted that greed and violence have always been part of human nature. Pedro acknowledged the challenges but remained determined to continue his mission. Meanwhile, Lawrence and Manuela bonded over language lessons, revealing Manuela's slow progress in learning English, which relieved Lawrence as he realized he was not in love with her.|"['1.

On a low-lying spit, they parked the canoe and set up camp among the bushes, close to the river. A vast tree shielded them from the night dew. Lawrence felt solemn and incredibly sad that night, standing by the river under the moonlight. While his companions prepared dinner, he pondered over past, present, and future, feeling a deep sense of dissatisfaction with himself, his companions, and his surroundings. The beauty of the moonlit river, the sounds of alligators, jaguars, frogs, and howling monkeys filled the air with a mix of romance and danger. Despite his reflections, Lawrence couldn't shake off his discontent. A sudden war-cry shattered the peaceful night, revealing it was the Indian's pet parrot mimicking the tribe's war-whoop. The weather in Peru and Bolivia turned stormy, and the travelers stumbled upon a gruesome scene of turtle massacres, a sight that left them appalled.|"['1.

A group of Indians killed over three hundred turtles solely for their valuable yellow fat, not for food but for trade. Later that evening, the party used green muslin to create mosquito curtains. As there wasn't enough material for everyone, Quashy ingeniously crafted a unique net with hoops inside to keep mosquitoes at bay. Despite Lawrence's concern about mosquitoes already inside, he demonstrated how to clear them out and effectively wear the net to keep insects away. However, Quashy's innovative creation couldn't prevent mosquitoes from attacking him during the night. They swarmed around his face, taking advantage of any opening in the net. As a result, Quashy woke up the next morning with two swollen noses due to the persistent mosquito bites.|['1.

One night, a fierce hurricane hit the group while they were sleeping in hammocks with veils. The storm tore the veils, scattered their belongings, and soaked them. Seeking shelter, they built a crude hut with branches and blankets. Despite the darkness, it only provided partial protection. They huddled together, shivering until morning. The storm passed, and they dried their clothes in the sun. Forgotten were the discomforts of the night as they enjoyed breakfast. The group encountered more Indians, occupied with turtle hunting. The Indians shared a meal of turtle eggs and bananas with the travelers. While waiting for nightfall to hunt turtles, the Indians engaged in various activities, including grooming and playing games. The travelers observed and learned about the Indians' customs, including their unique cup-and-ball game.|"['1.

As night fell, the Indians left their games and went to the sand-flats under the leafy shelters. Their visitors followed. The dark night with few stars gave a solemn feeling, making even the most carefree thoughtful. Lawrence and Pedro waited in silence. The guide spoke of the contrasts in nature, from storm to calm. Quashy crept in the dark. The sound of swirling water grew louder. Turtles emerged, laying eggs with great speed and effort. They dug trenches, laid eggs, and covered them in a rush. Some turtles got buried in the process. After finishing, they hurried back to the river. The Indians, waiting for this moment, sprang into action with yells of excitement.|['1.

There was a method to the madness of the Indians as they captured turtles. Instead of risking a direct confrontation, they cleverly rushed the flanks of the host, grabbing the animals' tails and flipping them over. Quashy, one of the captors, initially struggled with the turtles but eventually mastered the technique. In his excitement, Quashy even managed to turn a particularly large turtle, showcasing his skill. However, his success was short-lived when he fell into a trench, pinned down by the turtle. Fortunately, Lawrence Armstrong heard his cries and rescued him just in time. Quashy's accident made him more cautious, especially when indulging in turtle-egg ragout. The captured turtles were later harvested for their valuable fat, which was highly prized for its commercial value.|"[""1.

I'm a government agent, volunteering to promote peace and prevent war. While some may find this idealistic, I believe in self-defense and the right of oppressed nations to fight tyranny. Wars often lack just cause, and arbitration should be the preferred method to settle disputes. Do you share these views?""

Lawrence nodded in agreement, showing his support for Pedro's beliefs in peace. Manuela, understanding the conversation, observed with interest. Pedro continued, explaining the peace-loving faction in the country and the ongoing efforts to establish a stable government.

The guide explained his plan to start the journey at dawn the next day. He asked for Quashy to prepare while he spoke with Manuela. Manuela, feeling like an Inca princess, objected. Pedro, a bit exasperated, laughed and reminded her of his warning. Canoeing felt slow, but looking back, they had covered many miles. Lawrence, not impatient, enjoyed the journey through fascinating lands. Pedro and Spotted Tiger were knowledgeable companions, and Quashy was courageous and cheerful. Manuela intrigued Lawrence, though he denied romantic feelings. He pondered over her beauty and spirit while sketching in the woods. Lawrence concluded he admired her spirit, not her appearance, a novel feeling for him.

His thoughts were interrupted by a melodious sound that made his heart skip a beat. His hand froze mid-sketch, and his mouth hung open, unable to utter a word. It was as if an angel had descended, singing heavenly tunes. Peeking through the bushes, Lawrence spotted Manuela strolling by, lost in her thoughts, humming softly. He sat in awe, speechless. To his surprise, it was Manuela singing, a rare sight. As she approached, he heard her singing in Spanish, which puzzled him. Could an Indian girl learn Spanish songs by rote? Startled by his presence, Manuela blushed and stopped singing. Lawrence, quick-witted, realized the impropriety of his feelings and swiftly decided to treat her as a sister. This clever move diffused the situation, and Manuela burst into laughter, correcting him with a smile. As they shared a laugh, a sudden eerie sound echoed through the forest, filling them with alarm. The ground trembled beneath them, reminiscent of past terrors. Amidst the rising panic, a familiar galloping noise approached, sending shivers down their spines.|"[""1.

The town, with its white houses and gleaming church, bustled with a diverse mix of people in vibrant attire - merchants, priests, muleteers, adventurers, and elegant senhoras. As evening fell, our travelers, now on horseback, entered the town amidst ringing bells and a festive atmosphere. The streets were filled with intriguing characters, and the arrival of our party, including the elegant Manuela, garnered mixed reactions.

Tomorrow or the following day, I might meet Colonel Marchbanks to discuss our work. Although I'm not under his command, I collaborate with him closely as we share similar ideas for peace.

She will probably stay till I return unless the Indians intervene. The conversation ended as they arrived at the inn where they met a tall Englishman in a Tweed shooting outfit.

Manuela expressed her frustration at the secrecy imposed upon her by Senhor Pedro, who defended his actions by highlighting her father's objections to her relationship with Senhor Armstrong. Despite Pedro's efforts to protect her, Manuela's father remained opposed to the match. Pedro revealed that Senhor Armstrong had developed feelings for Manuela, even against his own will, and that her father was furious.

Quashy rode silently beside Colonel Marchbanks, feeling frustrated by his master's whims.

As they rode, the troop reached the vast South American Pampas, a sea of grass stretching to the horizon. Lawrence and Quashy, on their good horses, marveled at the new landscape after passing through the bush. The scene was a refreshing change, with grassy plains and scattered thickets resembling islets. The riders felt a sense of freedom and joy as they galloped over the open plain. Lawrence, unaware of a princess in the group, found the scenery magnificent. Quashy's exclamation was cut short by a sudden horse stumble, but they continued their journey.

After dinner, Lawrence felt a bit down as he pondered military questions about rear-guards and advance-guards. This made the rest of the journey less enjoyable, even Quashy's attempts to cheer him up failed. The estancia, mentioned by the colonel, sat on a small hill surrounded by algaroba-trees. Lawrence spent time after arrival caring for his mules and gathering food. Later, he sat in a garden under a tree, contemplating the peaceful moonlit night. Despite feeling sad about Manuela, Lawrence resolved to focus on his mission to rescue women and children. He reflected on the justification of war for self-defence and helping the helpless.

Before dawn the next day, a messenger rushed in from Pedro, reporting that the Indians were camped ahead with captives and loot just half a day's ride away.

Lawrence Armstrong, filled with the noble idea of rescuing the helpless, spurred his horse ahead of the troop, followed closely by Quashy. They noticed a savage carrying what seemed to be a child. Determined to save the child, Lawrence and Quashy chased the savage. The savage dropped the load, revealing it was not a child but a sack of property. Enraged and disappointed, Lawrence was consumed by revenge. In pursuit, the savage led them towards a dangerous area with holes. Lawrence's horse stumbled, causing him to fall and lose consciousness. Upon waking, Lawrence found himself alone with Quashy in a vast, empty plain. Determined to find the trail, Lawrence rode eastward, hoping to reunite with the troop and captives.

As the sun started to set behind the distant Andes, turning them into a hazy blue range, Lawrence and his steeds began to tire. Anxious to catch up with the troops, Lawrence had pushed the horses hard. Despite his efforts to sound cheerful, his worries were evident. Quashy, the simple-minded companion, took Lawrence's demeanor at face value and cheerfully prepared the camp. Although lost on the vast Pampas, their immediate situation was not dire. They had enough food for several meals, the weather was calm, and the setting, in a way, was quite romantic. From their vantage point, they could see the entire horizon and the rolling grass of the Pampas resembling ocean waves. Lawrence, however, was too preoccupied to appreciate the beauty around him. The arrival of a Gaucho chasing an ostrich in the distance briefly diverted their attention. After a long day and a modest supper, Lawrence and Quashy settled down under the stars for a much-needed rest. The next morning, as the sun rose, Lawrence felt grateful for the restful night and the renewed sense of strength. Despite the initial tranquility of the morning, the harsh reality of their situation soon set in, reminding Lawrence of the urgency to rescue the captives and save Manuela.|"['1.

"""Come, Quashy!"" shouted Lawrence, jumping up and shaking the negro awake. ""We need to go. Where are the horses?"" From the hill, they scanned the plains but found no trace of the horses. Lawrence decided they needed to search. He and Quashy split up, each going in opposite directions. They marked their spot with a poncho. Lawrence searched all day without success. Quashy, after two hours, found the horses grazing in a hidden hollow. He tried to signal Lawrence but he was too far. Lawrence named his horse Ole Scrubby, despite it being young and fine. The horse teased Lawrence, refusing to be caught. Quashy scolded the horse, but it continued to play hard to get, frustrating its master."|"[""1.

Repeatedly, the man tried to approach the horse, but each time he failed. Quashy, however, was determined. He spent hours coaxing, pleading, scolding, and even trying to bribe the horse to no avail. Frustrated, he resorted to threats and accusations, but the horse remained unfazed, joyfully prancing around. Despite his efforts, Quashy couldn't catch the horse. Lawrence, a kind man, had a way with animals, winning their hearts with sugar. As night fell, they encountered a group of Gauchos, who welcomed them warmly. The Gauchos, six in number, were skilled riders, including a young boy who rode with grace beyond his years.|"[""1.

The leading Gaucho suggested that the senhor seek refuge in their humble mud hut for the night due to an impending storm. The Gaucho assured that they would be well-fed, rested, and ready to continue their journey in the morning. As the sky darkened with menacing clouds, the Gauchos galloped off, leaving Lawrence and his companion with no choice but to accept the invitation. Racing towards the Gaucho huts, the storm swiftly approached, unleashing its fury with fierce winds, blinding rain, and booming thunder. Seeking safety, they finally arrived at the huts, where they were welcomed by the Gaucho leader and his wife.

The Gauchos of the Pampas, though unconcerned with looks, still hold the manners of their Spanish ancestors. They gathered for supper around a spit with roasted beef, sticking it into the mud floor. Lawrence was offered a horse's head to sit on by the hut's master. They ate with long knives, hungry and silent, washing down the food with water. After supper, they slept on the floor covered with ponchos, only their feet visible. In the morning, a cock crowed, signaling a new day. Lawrence and Quashy found their horses missing, which turned out to be due to the Gauchos driving cattle with loud noises. Quashy, a young boy, caught a pig but was dragged by it until it escaped. The young boy, full of energy, then mounted a horse to chase after the pig.|"['1. What did the Gauchos use to eat their supper?\nA) Spoons\nB) Forks\nC) Long knives\nD) Chopsticks\nE) Hands', '2.

Near the hut where they spent the night, Lawrence noticed other huts in a small hamlet enclosed by a ditch for defense. Quashy, their companion, was stunned by something ahead, showing a depth of emotion Lawrence hadn't seen before. Quashy, in awe, tried to speak while dancing around Susan. The village men prepared for an attack by a group of Indians, arming themselves with rustic weapons. Lawrence and Quashy joined the defense at the entrance, blocked by cactus bushes. The attackers, led by a fierce warrior, charged towards them. A shot missed its mark, but subsequent shots wounded several attackers, causing them to retreat in surprise. While the front attack was repelled, Lawrence found himself surrounded by more enemies in the rear.|['1.

The Gaucho leader bravely fought his way back to his hut, escaping safely inside. Lawrence and Quashy, outnumbered, fought back to back. Quashy skillfully wielded his sword, while Lawrence used his gun as a shield and a cudgel to fend off attackers. Despite their efforts, Lawrence was struck on the temple and fell. Alone, Quashy fought valiantly but was eventually overpowered. When Lawrence awoke, he found himself bound next to Quashy. Together, they observed the savages regrouping for another attack. As the chaos unfolded, a new group of assailants arrived, including what appeared to be Colonel Marchbanks and Manuela. Lawrence, recognizing a familiar face, shouted out in desperation.|['1.

"""There's no time to explain,"" Ignacio said urgently. ""Listen carefully. I and others are secret foes among these outlaws. When you're free, stay quiet and be smart. You'll need all your courage. Don't acknowledge me—stay silent and wise."" The elderly hunter swiftly got up, sheathed his knife, and hurried away as he spotted a gang of bandits approaching. Leading them astray with a diversionary tactic, he diverted their attention from where Lawrence and his companion were still tied up. ""It's a puzzle, sir,"" gasped Quashy, stunned. ""If only the strength in my heart could go to my muscles, I'd break these ropes like Samson."" The hunter explained, ""We can't afford more captives; the soldiers are on our trail. These men won't fetch a ransom. Let's leave them be."" As they moved on, they encountered Antonio, who freed them from their bonds, settling an old debt.

As the firing-party advanced, followed by a group of ruffians, Lawrence felt deep interest and pity as he recognized their friend Pedro among the condemned. Determined to save him, Lawrence quietly joined the procession, unnoticed by Pedro. With Quashy and Antonio by his side, Lawrence marched on, resolved to do something to rescue Pedro, even if it meant risking his own life. When Pedro was ordered to face the firing squad, Lawrence stepped forward, positioning himself in front of Pedro, demanding the firing-party to stop. The situation escalated as more allies appeared, pointing muskets at Cruz and his men.

Cruz, despite the advice given by the colonel and his comrades, decided to heed the warning and choose discretion over valor. Realizing that it was wiser to retreat for now, he gathered his men silently and departed. Lawrence, finding Manuela and Mariquita among the group, refrained from showing too much emotion in front of the colonel. Instead, he greeted them calmly and congratulated them on their escape. Antonio, on the other hand, offered to surrender and join forces with the colonel, urging his comrades to do the same. However, his companions preferred their current way of life and declined the offer. Ultimately, the colonel accepted Antonio's surrender, gave a stern warning to the rebels, and parted ways.

It was not a large group, but it was made up of rare and strong materials. Pedro, also known as Conrad of the Mountains and the Rover of the Andes, led the way. Colonel Marchbanks, Manuela, and Mariquita followed. Antonio, Spotted Tiger, the sportsman, and his friend came next, while Lawrence with Quashy and Sooz'n brought up the rear. They galloped across the roadless plains, veering slightly as needed but heading towards the rising sun in a straight line. Riding freely over the plains is exhilarating, with few obstacles, flat land, and untouched nature. The absence of fences, ditches, and ploughed fields allows for an uninterrupted gallop through vast space, limited only by the endurance of the horse and rider. Although there are challenges, life's incidents can be both drawbacks and advantages, adding zest to life.|"['1.

The colonel spurred his horse, leading Lawrence to follow suit. Quashy and the rest of the group joined in the chase, racing at full speed. The thunderous sound of hooves pushed the runaway horse even faster. The race became a fair competition as each rider showcased their abilities. The course stretched from the Andes to the Atlantic, and all were determined to keep up the pace. Lawrence, the Inca princess, and their horses raced ahead, leaving others behind. As they approached a line of bushes, Manuela's horse leaped like a rocket, while Lawrence crashed through. He managed to catch the falling princess, rescuing her in a providential moment. The runaway horse finally stopped, content to graze quietly. The group later arrived at a Gaucho hut, discovering a corral filled with vultures and hawks perched on rough posts.|"['1.

The area surrounding the mud hut was littered with bones, horns, and carcasses, prompting travelers to stay upwind. The family, descendants of an esteemed Spanish lineage, displayed dignity and manners despite their primitive lifestyle. Led by a gracious middle-aged man, the household welcomed the visitors with Pampas customs. While the group planned to eat quickly and continue their journey, Colonel Marchbanks observed the Gauchos training horses. Meanwhile, Quashy stayed behind to ensure a special meal for Susan, Manuela, and Mariquita. A young girl and her brother efficiently prepared a hen by scalding it to simplify feather removal.

At the corral's gate, the eldest son, Pizarro, received the lasso's end. He resembled the conqueror of Peru in courage and vigor. The young horse resisted leaving its companions but was lassoed and tamed. Pizarro saddled the horse, mounted it, and held on as it wildly tried to unseat him.
