Once upon a time, there was a little woman who went to market to sell her eggs. She fell asleep on the king's highway and a pedlar named Stout cut her petticoats. When she woke up, she shivered and cried, not recognizing herself. She mentioned her little dog at home, who would know her. As she walked home in the dark, her dog barked, making her realize it was indeed her. In another tale, a little man had a farm with a dappled cow and a plough. His dog was named Fidelle, and he had a pony and a frisky pig. His maiden, Ann, stumbled while milking, causing chaos with the cow, pig, and dog. The pony lifted its heels, causing the man to fall and nearly crack his crown.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, a ship sailed on the sea, filled with treasures like raisins and almonds. The crew? Twenty-four white mice with rings. The captain? A duck in a jacket, who quacked as they set sail. Meanwhile, a little sparrow chirped merrily from a tree. On another day, a crow watched a tailor, leading to a comical mishap with a sow. The tale ends with a request for brandy. In a playful chant, the cuckoo and ducks seemed to say more than they did, causing confusion. And as one misty morning unfolded, a man in leather greeted with a nod. The moon housed a man named Aiken Drum, who played a ladle. Lastly, a rhyme about Billy Pringle, his pig, and a sad end.|['1.
