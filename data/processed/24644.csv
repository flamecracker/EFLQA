Once upon a time, in a town nearby, there was a very wise man. He did a peculiar thing; he jumped into a thorny bush and scratched out both his eyes. Surprisingly, he then jumped into another bush and scratched his eyes back in! Imagine if the world was made of apple-pie, the sea of ink, and trees of bread and cheese, what would we drink? It's a riddle that makes you scratch your head! In another tale, a little wife did all the chores, even bringing flour from the mill in no time.

Little Robin Red-breast was perched on a tree, while Pussy-cat tried to catch him with glee. Robin ran away as fast as he can, teasing Pussy-cat with a plan. Robin then hopped on a wall, with Pussy-cat close behind, almost taking a fall. The little man with a gun shot a duck in the head, then brought it home for Joan to roast instead. A pie sat merrily on a pear-tree, singing heigh ho with glee. Boys and girls were called to play outside, leaving their supper and sleep aside. Ding, dong, bell, Pussy fell in the well, rescued by Johnny Green and Stout, a tale to tell. Let's dance on the green and have some fun, the longest dancer will be crowned and won.

"Once upon a time, a little maid pondered, ""What shall we eat, eat, eat?"" Will the love you hold dear ignite the kitchen fire? Or will the god of Love turn the spit, spit, spit? I once had a lovely wife, the fairest of all, who washed dishes, kept the house clean, and even went to the mill for flour, returning in less than an hour. She baked bread, brewed ale, and told tales by the fire. The queen of hearts baked tarts, the knave stole them, but the king got them back. The king of spades kissed the maids, the queen got upset, but then forgave. The king of clubs quarreled with his queen, and the knave intervened. The diamond king and queen were interrupted by a haughty knave. The story continues with poor children left in the woods, and Old King Cole calling for his fiddlers three. Remember the babes in the wood and the tale of the bachelor who went to London to find a wife. King Cole's merry soul called for his pipe, bowl, and fiddlers three. Now, let's learn to slide and skate, light candles, and make a cozy fire."|"['1. What did the little maid ponder?\nA. What to wear\nB. What to eat\nC. Where to play\nD. How to dance\nE.

It is still very cold, but the days are longer. The yellow crocus is blooming, and the mezereon tree is covered in blossoms. White snow-drops are peeking out. Can I pick one? Yes, but always ask before picking a flower. Listen to the rooks cawing and building nests. A man is ploughing a field; soon barley will be sown. Wheat is sown in autumn. Sometimes oxen pull ploughs instead of horses. Feel the wind blowing; it could almost blow you away. Look, a tree has fallen. The wind is from the north, making it cold.

"Now, as the birds sing and the trees bloom, flowers emerge alongside butterflies fluttering about as the sun shines brightly. Suddenly, rain falls, mixing with the sunlight, creating a colorful rainbow in the sky. The rainbow displays a beautiful array of colors that fade away as it moves further. Listen closely, the cuckoo calls out, ""Cuckoo! Cuckoo!"" announcing the arrival of spring. Have you heard the nursery rhyme about the cuckoo? It sings as it flies, bringing good tidings without deceit. The cuckoo heralds the nearness of spring by sucking small bird eggs to clear its voice. Let's enjoy the pleasant month of May by taking a walk in the fields. The hawthorn trees are in full bloom. Let's gather daisies, cowslips, and crow-flowers to create a sweet-smelling nosegay. Harry has found a nest of young birds after climbing a tall tree to reach them. These baby goldfinches are featherless, so we must keep them warm and feed them with bread and milk until their red heads and yellow wings grow in, making them quite beautiful."|['1.

Let's have a tea party outside! Bring the tea set. It's lovely. But there's no table. What can we use? Ah, there's a big tree stump! It'll be a perfect table. No chairs?

Get the fork and rake. Spread the hay, shape it into stacks, and have fun jumping on top. Cover Harry with hay. The scent is delightful! It's hot, but work hard while the sun's out. Everyone's busy.

It's a lovely evening. Look, Harry, at the setting sun in the west. Little boys say he's going to bed. The sun looks pretty now, not as bright as at dinner. The clouds are beautiful, crimson, purple, and gold. The sun is half gone and now disappeared. It's very hot; the grass and flowers are burnt from no rain. Water your garden or plants will die. Let's find the watering-pot. It's shady under the trees, cooler. Come to the arbour; a bee is on the honey-suckle. It's getting honey for the hive. Want to swim in the river? It's shallow. Take off your clothes, jump in, don't be afraid. Swim like the little frog. Let's check the ripe corn in the fields. It's brown, ready to harvest. Farmer Diggory, bring a sickle to cut it. Tie the corn in sheaves and make a shock.|"[""1.

Would you like some nuts? Please bring the nut-crackers. Let's peel this walnut. I can craft a small boat from the walnut-shell for you to sail in a pan. We need to pick the grapes, or the birds will eat them all. Here are black grapes and white grapes. Which do you prefer? Grapes are used to make wine. What bird is that? Even though it's dead, it's beautiful with its scarlet eye and colorful feathers. It's a pheasant, delicious to eat. Let's pluck its feathers and ask Betty Cook to roast it. We also have a hare, caught by the hounds. It's dark and gloomy outside with the rain. But indoors, we can sit by the fire, read, share stories, and admire pictures. I wonder how less fortunate boys stay warm without fire, shoes, food? Here's a halfpenny, Harry, to help them buy a roll. Christmas is near, and Betty is busy preparing apples, chopping meat, and seasoning for mince-pies. Do you enjoy mince-pies? They are delicious!|"['1.

"Look at the lovely robin flying against the window. Open the window. What do you need, little robin? Just a few bread crumbs. Give him some, and he will happily hop around the room, perch on the screen, and sing sweetly all day long! Make sure the mischievous cat doesn't harm him. No, kitty! You must catch mice, not the robin. The little boy then saw a bee flitting from flower to flower. He asked, ""Pretty bee, will you play with me?"" The bee replied, ""No, I must gather honey."" Next, he met a dog and asked to play, but the dog had to hurry to catch a hare for dinner. The boy then saw a bird collecting hay for its nest and a horse ready to plough. Realizing everyone is busy, the boy decided he must also stay active. He rushed to school, learned well, and was praised by the teacher.

One sunny morning last summer, Harry and I packed some cake for lunch and embarked on a long walk. We strolled through the Home Meadow with its tall elm-trees, then entered the corn-fields. The sun shone brightly as a lark sang high above us. Mesmerized, we watched it land near a tuft of grass by the hedge. As we continued, we heard a tapping sound in the woods. Climbing a hedge-bank, we discovered two woodpeckers on a tree trunk hunting insects. Further along, we spotted hares and a rabbit in the clover. A commotion led us to a tree filled with titmice, engaging in various activities. Harry found a mole caught in a trap, surrounded by bees. We then encountered partridges and heard the cuckoo's call. Harry was thrilled to see two squirrels and later found pheasant tail feathers to adorn his hat. Finally, we observed a fly-catcher hunting bees and flies on a bramble.|['1.

We left the forest and walked along a footpath until we reached a road. Sitting near a stile was a girl who had been collecting sticks with her father in the woods. Tying the sticks into a bundle, she asked for help to carry them on her head. As we continued, we crossed a bridge over a river where we saw boats passing beneath us. Watching two swans gracefully sail up the river, we marveled at their regal appearance. Moving along the riverbank, we observed an otter catching a fish before a hawk swooped down to snatch a duckling. The hawk was soon chased away by a flock of birds, leaving the duckling unharmed. Later, we encountered a heron and saw swallows skimming the water for insects. Finally, we met Uncle George, who gave us a ride home in his gig.|"['1.
