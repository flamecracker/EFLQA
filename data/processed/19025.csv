There are many swallows that make their home in the old chimney every year. They have a specific day they arrive, almost like they are following a routine. The girls watch them circle and dive down the chimney, fascinated by their synchronized movements. After the last swallow disappears, they head back to Mrs. Hardy's house where they listen to stories about California. They get so engrossed in the tales that they forget about Bubbles, the little girl they left on the roof. Dimple's mother reminds them that Bubbles is just a child and asks them to inform her if Bubbles misbehaves instead of taking matters into their own hands. As they plan for Dimple's upcoming birthday, they discuss the joy of turning nine and the delicious treats they will have.|"[""1.
