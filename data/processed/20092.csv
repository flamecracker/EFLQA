During a time of religious conflict in France, known as the Huguenot wars, the struggle between Catholics and Protestants was fueled by political ambitions as well. The powerful Philip of Spain sought to extend his influence over France through the Catholic house of Guise. The Protestants, facing persecution and massacres, took up arms in self-defense. The Catholic Church, with its vast organization, worked to eradicate the growing Protestant movement. Many Huguenots fled to England, settling in towns like Canterbury. Among them was Gaspard Vaillant, a former landowner who had embraced the reformed religion. In Canterbury, he established a successful weaving business with fellow immigrants, helping them find stability and support in their new home.|['1.

Francois urged his aunt to hasten, reminding her of his mother's urgent instructions. The group swiftly mounted their horses and rode towards the chateau. Arriving at the gate, the Countess awaited them. Francois dismounted, and as Philip stopped, the countess warmly embraced her sister Marie. Despite a long separation, both women had aged gracefully. The Countess, tall and regal, had weathered the years with dignity. Marie, leading a tranquil life, appeared content and happy. The Countess praised Marie's peaceful existence and successful marriage, contrasting it with the turbulent times in their homeland. Expressing delight at meeting Philip, the Countess noted his English upbringing but recognized his French heritage in his demeanor.

Many new purchases have been made for defense. Thirty men-at-arms, experienced soldiers, will be sent to the field if needed. Additionally, about twenty tenants will join. The estate could raise up to three hundred fighters, but a third are Catholics who can't be relied on to fight against their own. To protect the Catholic tenants and the chateau, only a select few are called to arms. The rest will guard the estate. The young sons of the tenants will form a garrison. The walls and towers were built for security against attacks during the civil war. The countess's garden now sits inside the new wall. Storehouses are stocked with grain, and the garden can be turned into a stockyard if needed. The moat and the stream provide further protection.|"[""1.

This is the grand hall, also serving as a salle d'armes. Here, arms and armor for a hundred men are stored. While all tenants must appear fully armed when called upon, there may be shortages. For the past eight years, they have been trained and drilled weekly. Fencing is practiced with pike, sword, arquebus, and crossbow. Footmen train in the hall, while mounted men practice maneuvers and charging. Two officers teach fencing here. The swords used were long and straight, sharpened on both edges, used for cutting and thrusting. Philip, having learned English and French fencing, prefers the English style. He believes it's more effective for battle. The two faced off differently in their fencing styles, with Philip standing upright and Francois leaning forward. Their bout was evenly matched until the maitre d'armes called a halt.|"['1.

"I am a new follower of a different belief. Your approach is superior to ours, especially when the hand is skilled in protecting the body. The strain of holding the arm outstretched, as I am doing, is much more taxing than when you stand. Ultimately, you will outlast anyone not skilled enough to defeat you before their arm tires. 

""Is that true?"" the maitre d'armes asked, surprised. ""I thought he was your elder. He will be a renowned swordsman when he reaches adulthood. His defense is remarkably robust, and although I don't concede he surpasses you with the point, he'd be a formidable foe in a melee against our best swordsmen. If he's more accustomed to edge strikes, I'll challenge him myself tomorrow. The English are known for striking more than thrusting, which is advantageous in a melee on horseback where a strong blow can break armor.""

""Not at all. I lack experience in such matters, aside from casual encounters in noble houses. Jousting has fallen out of favor in England, and while I can ride, I lack knowledge of knightly pursuits. My father is a modest landowner, and until leaving England, I was merely a schoolboy.""

There was a debate on whether Francois' troop should march to join the Admiral at Chatillon-sur-Loing or proceed southeast where parties were evenly matched. They decided to march to the Admiral as it was crucial. The French court in Meaux was unaware of the danger. A spy was sent to Chatillon to report on the Admiral's actions. On the 26th, fifty troops armed with breast and back pieces, steel caps, lances, swords, and pistols gathered in the chateau courtyard. Francois and Philip wore complete armor. The troop held a service before riding out. Francois and Philip discussed the use of armor in battle, with Philip finding it cumbersome. They considered abandoning armor due to advancements in arquebuses and cannons. They rode out with a sense of duty, fighting for their right to worship and protect loved ones.|"[""1.

My cousin, previously without strong religious beliefs, embraced Huguenot faith. He is not an extremist but a gentle, refined man respected by all. A friend of the Guises, he accompanied Marie Stuart to Scotland. During the 1562 war, he fought for Conde at Dreux and showed valor at the Admiral's side. After the war ended with the death of Francois de Guise, he retired to Brittany. Despite his military prowess, he values peace and displays courtly manners. Loved by both rich and poor, he avoids conflict but will lead when necessary. His peaceful nature contrasts with his military skills.

Now that all fear of persecution was over, many citizens who had hidden their support for the new religion now openly admitted it. La Noue was pleased to see that the town could be safely entrusted to the Huguenots, with only a few men as leaders. He chose these leaders from the gentlemen who had accompanied him. Once they took charge, he could focus on other matters. They spent two days forming a council of citizens, mostly Huguenots, to manage the town and maintain order. A young nobleman was appointed as the military governor. Huguenots capable of fighting formed companies to defend the city. Three nobles supervised the town's food supply. Old soldiers trained the new recruits and ensured the town's defenses were strong.

Their extra chargers allowed them to ride every day, while half the troop took turns resting.

The Count praised Pierre's resourcefulness, even suggesting making him the camp's provider. La Noue shared a similar sentiment, appreciating a rogue's ability to ensure comfort during a campaign. The Huguenots were puzzled by the Constable's delay in battle, especially with Aremberg's approaching reinforcements.

D'Arblay and his companions, Philip and Francois, often visited Huguenot supporters near Toulouse. They gathered support and funds for their cause. One day, while resting in a wood, they spotted a group of Catholic horsemen approaching. D'Arblay and his men prepared for a confrontation. The Catholics split their forces, trying to surround the Huguenots. Undeterred, D'Arblay saw an opportunity in the odds. When the Catholics attacked, the Huguenots swiftly turned the tables. The Huguenots defeated the Catholics, with minimal casualties on their side. As they regrouped, they encountered the other half of the Catholic troop.

Francois and Philip stood side by side with their leader, D'Arblay, during a fierce combat where Philip's brave act of defeating the lieutenant ended the fight. Witnessing their officer's fall, the defeated soldiers quickly retreated. D'Arblay praised the young men for their courage and strategic thinking in battle. After the skirmish, they decided to move to Merlincourt for safety. D'Arblay split the treasures among three lackeys for safer keeping. He then left with a few men to visit a gentleman's chateau, while Philip stayed behind with the others.

Philip commanded the men to saddle up quickly as a pistol shot had been heard, indicating a possible ambush on their comrades. He instructed them to advance to the edge of the wood and be prepared to support their fellow soldiers. A soldier named Fletcher offered to go into the village to gather information, leaving his heavy armor behind to run faster if needed. He assured Philip that he would double back to throw off any pursuers. Upon his return, Fletcher brought news that their comrades had fallen into an ambush, and prominent figures had been captured and taken to Toulouse.

Many of the city's leaders resided in grand homes outside the city walls. Philip devised a plan to capture some of them to secure the release of their friends. They quickly set off for Toulouse, a wealthy city surrounded by elegant villas. Stopping at a farmer's house, Philip demanded his help in locating the homes of important officials. Threatening the farmer, Philip instructed him to guide them discreetly. The group planned to visit ten houses, starting with the President of the Parliament and the Judge of the High Court.

After discussing with his wife, he sought advice from Philip Fletcher. Philip assured him that their pledge would likely be respected, but he recommended selling their property and moving to La Rochelle or England to ensure their safety.

The journey back was smooth, and they reached La Rochelle without facing any enemies. However, the army needed money to pay the German soldiers who had helped them. The soldiers refused to march without payment. The Admiral asked his troops for help, and they generously gave up their valuables to pay the Germans. With the army now united, they headed back towards Paris. Negotiations for peace had been ongoing, but only when the Huguenots seemed strong did the court take them seriously.

The Huguenots were not surprised to find that the treaty they had agreed to was quickly broken. The Catholic churches openly denounced the treaty, leading to violent attacks on the returning Huguenots. The persecution worsened after the war, with many Huguenots being murdered. The Countess de Laville expressed disappointment in the Huguenot leaders for agreeing to a treaty without guarantees. Despite the peace, the Huguenots faced continued hostility.

Hostilities between the Catholics and Huguenots were imminent due to the Catholic leagues established in various provinces, determined to eradicate the reformed religion. The situation worsened as outrages in Paris forced Conde and Admiral Coligny to seek refuge in Noyers and Tanlay. Chancellor L'Hopital's calls for toleration fell on deaf ears as the Cardinal of Lorraine gained influence. The king demanded Huguenots swear an oath, which they refused. With L'Hopital out of the council, the Lorraine party planned to arrest Huguenot leaders. Warned in time, Conde, the Admiral, and their families fled, facing numerous obstacles but finding an unguarded ford to cross the Loire, evading capture.

"""I fear, countess,"" the Admiral said, ""that our arrival at La Rochelle will bring trouble upon all the country round it. We had no choice between that and exile.

Here at La Rochelle we shall be in communication with Navarre and Gascony; and doubt not that we shall, ere very long, be again at the head of an army with which we can take the field, even more strongly than before; for after the breaches of the last treaty, and the fresh persecutions and murders throughout the land, the Huguenots everywhere must clearly perceive that there is no option between destruction, and winning our rights at the point of the sword.

Philip was relieved that he had his back turned to the speaker, as he recalled the past event where he had struck someone. He was confident he wouldn't be recognized since his face was mostly covered by his helmet. The first speaker expressed optimism about their current situation, mentioning their control over most of France and plans to capture key figures.

They arrived downstairs at six in the morning and had a simple meal of bread and spiced wine. By seven, carts filled with barrels of wine stopped outside the cabaret. One cart carried the farmer's wife with eggs, fowls, ducks, and butter. The farmer agreed to let them help load his boat and transport the barrels to Bordeaux in exchange for a passage. As they worked to load the boat, the farmer expressed concern about their reliability. Despite the doubts, they quickly loaded everything onto the boat. The sail was raised, and they set off towards Bordeaux, grateful for the faster journey compared to walking. Upon reaching the warehouse, they swiftly unloaded the barrels.

The innkeeper shared a rumor that a lady was heading to Paris to assure the king she was not involved in the troubles. Philip worried about crossing the bridge due to rough troops.

If I were in your place, I don't know that I should do so; but as you say that you could do it, without your conscience pricking you, I certainly should not put pressure upon you to say 'yes.' However, I hope you may never be asked the question, and that we shall meet with no more interruptions until we get to Nerac. There can be little doubt that, at present, the Catholics have received no orders to seize the queen and her son at Nerac; although they have orders to prevent her, at all costs, from going forward to Paris except under escort; and are keeping a sharp lookout, to prevent her from being joined by parties of Huguenots who would render her force formidable. I should hope that, by this time, we are past the last of their bands. Those we met just now doubtless belonged to the force gathered in Bazas; and it is in the direction of the north, rather than the west, that the Catholics are most vigilant. If she succeeds in making her way through them, it will be well nigh a miracle. Because, sir, in that case you would have insisted on pushing on to Nerac, so as to enter it before the gate is closed; and in that case I doubt whether, with the best will, I could have got that far, and I am sure that Jacques and Roger could not have done so.

Philip listened to a conversation at the next table where four gentlemen discussed the capture of Jeanne of Navarre.

Philip was concerned that the queen might slip away back to Navarre before any direct orders arrived from the court. He knew that once in Navarre, it would be difficult to capture her. The queen's stronghold in Nerac wouldn't withstand a long siege, and her loyal followers would make it challenging to apprehend her. Despite being a Huguenot, she commanded respect and loyalty. Philip, disguised as a Catholic gentleman, wandered the streets, trying to gather information without raising suspicion.

Count Raoul chose not to question the situation further, allowing the matter to conclude. However, the governor of Agen, Monsieur D'Estanges, felt obligated to investigate the stranger who had caused trouble by killing an officer. Despite Monsieur D'Estanges' lack of knowledge about the Englishman, he believed the man to be honorable. Yet, due to the Englishman's nationality and religion, the governor suspected him of aiding rebels and conspiring against the king. The Englishman was placed under close watch, with orders to prevent his escape. As he was led through the city, he spotted Pierre but received no acknowledgment. Confined in a room overlooking the river, the Englishman pondered his precarious situation, hoping for Pierre's resourcefulness to aid in his escape.|"['1.

Philip was content that his signal had been seen, so he withdrew it and watched the boat. It traveled a short distance up, turned, and drifted back down the stream. Once it passed the bridge, Philip relaxed on the couch. He listened to a sentry pacing outside his door before dozing off. He awoke to the sound of the bars being removed and a man entering with food. Later, he heard a commotion in the courtyard and suspected a nighttime expedition. Philip hoped they were reinforcing guards for the queen's safety. He wished Pierre and others were alert, ready to warn the queen. The sentry's behavior changed, hinting at a possible escape plan.

Philip needed to act swiftly. He had to untangle the rope from his body, which luckily didn't make him appear bulky due to his lean frame. The rope, though not thick, was new and sturdy with knots every two feet. Roger waited below in a boat. Jacques had left on horseback upon learning that troops were assembling. He and Roger had taken the horses outside the walls and left them at a nearby farmer's place. Jacques planned to follow the troops on foot and then mount a horse at the farmhouse. If the troops headed to Nerac, he would wait on the other side of the river. If they followed the river downstream, he would ride fast to warn the queen. Philip quickly descended the wall using the rope, landed in the boat, and Roger poled it against the tide. Roger shared how he had observed Philip leaving the town and decided to wait for his return. Later, he saw Philip being escorted as a prisoner by soldiers, realizing the urgency to act.

As soon as we set off, I ventured to explore the castle. My main goal was to discover where you were housed. If you were in a cell facing outward, I believed you would signal me knowing I was searching for you. If I saw no sign, my plan was to approach a castle servant leaving the premises, befriend them, and through conversation over a drink, learn your location within the castle. Upon rowing back, we made our arrangements. Jacques would carry out your previous instructions regarding troop movements and alert the queen if there was peril. Roger would be waiting with a boat at the wall's base after nightfall. My task was to secure your escape. Initially, I secured a rope, concealed it under my doublet, and waited by the wall. Jacques informed me that most troops would assemble at eight o'clock, simplifying my entry unnoticed among the bustling crowd. When darkness fell, Jacques and I exchanged attire, and I proceeded towards the open gates, knowing they wouldn't close until midnight due to the constant flow of people. I mingled with a group of footmen and made my way inside. The courtyard bustled with men, but I swiftly located the staircase leading to the river-facing wall.

"After all, I gained nothing by the duel; for the governor, with a troop of horse, came up just as it concluded, and as I could give no satisfactory account of myself, I was hauled off a prisoner to the castle.

The soldiers advanced in the afternoon and were instructed to halt at a village twelve miles away. Knowing the next day's journey would be long, they set off early. By late afternoon, the army, now joined by an additional two hundred soldiers, reached Perigueux. Earlier, five hundred horsemen had gone ahead to secure the bridge. The seneschal, anticipating their arrival, stationed horsemen on all roads leading north from Bergerac. Perigueux, caught off guard, attempted a brief resistance but was quickly overpowered. Many fled to the castle where D'Escars was stationed. Despite having a larger force, the disorganized troops were unable to mount a defense.

"In half an hour, a dull sound was heard by those inside the chateau. Gradually, it grew louder and above the noise of horses, the clash of steel became distinct. The sound approached until it stopped a few hundred yards away. A figure was seen creeping towards the moat, pausing at its edge before retreating. Believing the chateau was asleep and unguarded, the attackers advanced eagerly. Suddenly, a voice shouted, ""Give fire!"" and a deadly barrage of arquebus fire and crossbow bolts rained down from the walls, causing confusion among the assailants.

Philip assigned Eustace to lead the men at the lower windows, and Roger to command those on the upper floor. Philip and Jacques positioned themselves on the first floor, where the enemy planned to place their ladders. Fires blazed in all rooms, with cauldrons of water ready to douse attackers. Boys with pails stood by, prepared to throw boiling water when needed. The walls around the courtyard weren't thick enough for fires, but flames burned in the courtyard with boiling water ready. Huguenot gentlemen oversaw defenders along the wall. The besiegers, lacking cannons, attacked with ladders and planks. The defenders, armed with crossbows and arquebuses, repelled the assailants. After a fierce two-hour assault, the attackers retreated, unable to breach the stoutly defended walls. De Brissac decided on a fiery assault next to force the defenders' surrender.|"[""1.

No response came as the group assessed their injuries from the failed assault. Some nobles had lost their lives in the unexpected fierce battle. De Brissac quickly organized soldiers to gather materials for defense. Francois and Philip strategized to defend the castle from the impending attack. They decided to use cattle carcasses to block the entrances, making it impossible for the enemy to breach. The men swiftly slaughtered the cattle and piled their carcasses as barricades. Skinning the carcasses and using the hides to create slippery barriers ensured the safety of the defenders.

As the men with arquebuses and crossbows neared, they opened fire. Four hundred arquebusiers advanced, firing heavily towards the wall. Philip ordered them to retreat, while he observed from a turret. Sacks were emptied on soaked planks, covered with earth and water, then faggots were piled against the door. A torch ignited the faggots, forcing the assailants back under fire. The defenders poured boiling water to douse the flames. Despite casualties, the defenders prepared to repel the next assault. The countess distributed wine to boost morale. The gates crashed down, signaling a renewed attack. The Catholics advanced on the gate, while others targeted the posterns. Separate groups readied planks and ladders to bridge the moat and assault different points.|['1.

The defenders quickly sprang into action, firing relentlessly at the advancing attackers. Behind the barricade, fifty men-at-arms stood ready, with a dozen armed with arquebuses. The Catholics, confident of victory, charged forward with loud shouts, only to meet a fierce resistance. The arquebusiers rained bullets on them, forcing them to retreat. Despite their efforts, the assailants couldn't breach the barricade, faced with a wall of slippery hides and a line of pikemen. The attackers also failed to clear the blockades at the posterns. In the end, after losing hundreds of men, the Catholics retreated. The defenders, led by Francois and Philip, acted swiftly to secure their position, averting a potential disaster.

The initial step is to care for those who are injured. The deceased need to be laid to rest, and the wounded must be brought in for treatment. An empty granary will be transformed into a hospital. Eustace is instructed to prepare a makeshift bridge over the moat to follow the Catholics. A hundred and thirty wounded soldiers are tended to, with the countess and her helpers applying salves and bandages. Seven surviving gentlemen are found and taken to a room in the chateau. The defenders use a barricade made from ox hides to repel the attackers. The Admiral arrives with reinforcements, praising the courageous defense. Horses are rested, and food is provided while the newcomers settle in the chateau. Scouts confirm the enemy's retreat to a village seven miles away.|"['1.

During the winter, while the armies rested, efforts were made to involve other European powers in the conflict. The Pope and Philip of Spain supported the Guises, and the Duc de Deux-Ponts prepared to aid the Huguenots with troops from German Protestant states. Cardinal Chatillon sought help from England for the Queen of Navarre, who requested assistance with men, money, and munitions. Queen Elizabeth, appearing supportive while denying involvement, lent funds to the King of Navarre and sent supplies to La Rochelle. As spring approached, both armies readied for battle. The Huguenots, weakened by disease and desertions, planned to join forces in Guyenne. The Royalists, reinforced by German troops, aimed to confront them. The two armies converged near the Charente River, setting the stage for a decisive clash.|"['1.

Anjou had readied bridges and stealthily crossed the river on the night of March 12th, catching the Huguenots off guard. Upon learning of the enemy's crossing, the Admiral swiftly dispatched messengers to rally scattered divisions. Unfortunately, due to lax discipline and delayed communication, the Huguenots were slow to regroup. As they prepared to retreat towards the main army, the Royalists launched a surprise attack. Despite being outnumbered, De la Noue and his cavalry valiantly engaged the enemy. Francois and Philip led their men in a strategic charge, breaking through the Catholic cavalry and regrouping to fight another day.

After Conde's valiant charge, the Admiral managed to retreat without further loss. However, the Catholics were jubilant over Conde's death. The Huguenot cavalry suffered heavy casualties, with many nobles among the dead or captured. Despite this setback, Coligny's retreat to Cognac was successful. The Queen of Navarre, a brave leader, inspired the troops to continue the fight. Meanwhile, D'Anjou, intoxicated by his victory, delayed capitalizing on his success. He even dishonorably displayed Conde's body. Subsequent sieges on Cognac and other towns were met with fierce resistance. The Huguenots suffered the loss of D'Andelot and other brave soldiers.

Pierre expressed concern to Philip, anticipating that their pursuers would not easily give up.

During the battle, the German cavalry and Huguenot infantry faced a crushing defeat. The German cavalry panicked and fled, causing chaos among the ranks.

La Noue was among those taken prisoner. The battle ended with significant casualties on both sides, with two thousand Huguenot infantry and three hundred knights perishing. Despite the defeat, the heroic Queen of Navarre's arrival uplifted the Huguenots, rallying them to continue the fight. Coligny regrouped the army, leaving a garrison at Niort and moving to Saintes.

A messenger arrived with proposals from the governor, stating that the town would not surrender without orders from the Prince of Navarre.

During a conflict between Coligny's army and Cosse's forces, both armies faced heavy losses.

In the evening, a grand party was held at the Louvre for the important people of Paris. There was a splendid masquerade after dinner. The following days were filled with more celebrations. The king was kind to the Admiral and the Huguenot lords, hinting at breaking free from his mother's control. Protestants hoped for war with Spain. There were debates about a massacre plan against Protestants, but evidence suggests otherwise. The queen mother felt threatened by the Admiral's growing influence. She, her son, and others conspired to eliminate him. Some Huguenots sensed danger and left, while others stayed, trusting the king's invitation. A sense of impending doom loomed, and a loyal friend urged caution. Fear of an attack by the Paris mob led to preparations for a possible escape.|"['1.

"I have been inspecting the house, and I noticed that you can access the roof from an upstairs window. Last night, in the dark, I confirmed that it's easy to walk along the roof. The tenth house from here is where Count de Valecourt stays, and we can enter through a roof window. Some of your friends might be there. Alternatively, we could pass through the houses in between. The first three houses before the count's lodging house Huguenots, while the rest are Catholic. We could potentially pass through without being seen and exit onto the street discreetly.

Pierre, you've made wise decisions. Even if it turns out to be nothing but a nightmare, we've only spent a few coins. However, if it's an actual danger, we'll be prepared, and those coins might save our lives. If, hypothetically, we find ourselves disguised among a mob chanting against the Huguenots, where should we head next? 

When I purchased the monk's robe, I hadn't considered a female companion, sir. That was an afterthought. But your point is valid. I'll arrange for a different disguise for you, perhaps as a butcher or a blacksmith.

It all hinges on whether the soldiers side with the mob and the Guises in an uprising. If they do, Paris will be chaotic, and the gates will be shut.

Philip and his cousin had a limited time in Paris, just a week. They were advised to stay indoors as much as possible and be prepared to rise quickly at night. Philip was surprised when Pierre, his companion, went missing. Pierre had taken Philip's horses to a nearby village for safekeeping and returned to Paris by climbing over the walls during the night.

They influenced the feeble king's thoughts, convincing him that Coligny led a conspiracy against him, suggesting that only by eliminating him and his followers could France find peace. Suddenly, Charles joined their cause, going further than expected, decreeing the death of all Huguenots. This drastic change, and his subsequent behavior until his death, hint at his mental breakdown, absolving him of blame. Philip spent much of the day at the Louvre with Henry of Navarre and others, feeling reassured by their calm. However, a discovery of white crosses on doors of Huguenots raised suspicions of danger.

They chatted until nightfall, Pierre quietly in the corner, pretending to sleep most of the time. When darkness enveloped them, they retrieved their regular clothes and, stepping out, Philip and Pierre changed into them. Claire merely slipped off the dress placed over hers. After a meal, they headed to the nearest wall steps. They secured a rope to the parapet, lowered Claire down, and followed suit. They walked for three hours to Pierre's horse farm. Claire waited as Philip and Pierre readied the horses. Philip arranged his cloak for Claire to sit on, and they departed. They avoided big towns, lodging in village inns, journeying southward daily. The villages showed less religious tension than the towns, and news of the Paris events had not spread widely. They bypassed bridges, crossing by ferries or fords. They skirted Chatellerault to reach Laville chateau after an eight-day, two-hundred-mile journey. Philip entrusted Claire to his aunt at the chateau, introducing her as his betrothed, and shared the distressing news of events in Paris. His aunt comforted Claire and promised to hear Philip's account. Outraged at the king's actions, she found it unbelievable that he would betray his guests and break his promises.

The countess stood tall, denying the notion that her son, a loyal servant, would abandon the prince in a time of need. The horror of the massacre weighed heavily on her, mourning the loss of the brave Admiral and many others. Plans were made to flee to La Rochelle, a safer place, as danger loomed over the chateau. The bell rang, alerting the tenants, who armed themselves for the impending threat. Despite the losses and destruction, a sense of determination and defiance filled the air. The countess assured them that new leaders would rise, rallying the Huguenots to fight back against oppression. The resolve was clear: never again would they trust the faithless king or lay down their arms.|['1.

At noon the following day, everyone from the chateau set off for La Rochelle. The tenants, along with their animals and belongings, had left earlier in the day. By nightfall, the countess and her group caught up with them at a large encampment. The women and children slept under the wagons, while the men rested by their fires, taking turns to watch over the animals. The group had grown significantly since they began their journey, as many Huguenot villagers, upon hearing of the massacres, joined them on the road to safety. After four days of travel, they reached La Rochelle. The countess and Claire were welcomed by Monsieur Bertram, with Philip finding nearby lodgings. The community warmly received the influx of refugees, with Claire receiving care to recover from the traumatic events. The countess, in the absence of news about her son Francois, threw herself into organizing the defense of the city, making sacrifices and working tirelessly to protect their religion and homes.|"['1.

When a flag of truce arrived, announcing Monsieur de la Noue's presence on behalf of the king, the news was met with disbelief. There was anger at the count's perceived betrayal. Initially denied entry into the town, de la Noue eventually met with a group outside the gate. The encounter was unsatisfactory, with citizens claiming the man they knew was not at a Catholic camp. Negotiations resumed later, but the citizens found de la Noue's guarantees unacceptable. Despite his difficult position, citizens recognized his loyalty, accepting him as governor. The siege resumed vigorously, with de la Noue leading the defense. Many Catholics in the army, though gallant, disapproved of the St. Bartholomew massacre. The Duke of Alencon considered switching sides, while de la Noue tried to reconcile factions. He was relieved to find Francois and Philip alive and helped Philip with his plans to marry and leave for England.

Monsieur de la Noue kept Philip unaware of the negotiations. One evening, upon his return from the royal camp, he entered the room with two servants carrying heavy bags.

A week later, Philip and Claire married in La Rochelle's main church. The siege weakened, and Philip, Claire, and Pierre sailed to England. Claire believed in winning tolerance for Huguenots. In England, they were joyfully received by Philip's family at his new estate. Claire's dowry expanded the estate, making Philip a significant landowner.
