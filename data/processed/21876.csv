No one stepped forward. Each man glanced at his neighbor but stayed put. The city and its outskirts had been thoroughly searched by the Committee, resulting in only two hundred thousand dollars raised. Colonel Hathaway pledged twenty-five thousand himself. Seeing the reluctance, he pledged another twenty-five thousand and called for more patriots to join. Alora's father, Jason Jones, added twenty-five thousand more to his fifty thousand pledge. Jake Kasker, initially distrusted, took the stage. He expressed his disapproval of the war but declared his loyalty to the American flag, offering two thousand dollars in Liberty Bonds. He then increased it to five thousand, challenging others to match his commitment. This sparked laughter, anger, and eventually, a line formed as more people signed up for bonds.|"['1.

"""We will convince people to buy,"" she said confidently. ""We will ask nicely, armed with strong arguments. Time is short, and we need to raise a lot of money quickly."" Alora Jones suggested they put on their costumes, all prepared in a box, and grab the banners for their cause. By ten o'clock, they must be working.

The citizens of Dorfield were like men everywhere during the war. They were not fully aware of the responsibilities of the struggle. The war seemed distant, and life at home continued as usual. They couldn't grasp the impact the European war could have on their prosperity, freedom, or even their homes. Fear hadn't set in, and pity for allies was minimal. The war hadn't touched their hearts yet. Mary Louise and the Liberty Girls were determined to sell bonds for the war effort. They had already sold $32,000 worth of bonds and aimed for $100,000 more. Mary Louise convinced Mr. Chisholme to buy $50,000 worth of bonds, showing the importance of supporting the war. Despite some resistance, businesses like Stacks, Sellem & Stacks and Denis Hardware Company bought bonds, but Silas Herring's grocery store proved a tough sell.|"['1.

"""This is outrageous!"" exclaimed Herring angrily. ""When men can't force us into supporting England's selfish schemes, they send girls to charm money out of us.

Annie Boyle observed a wealthy woman and wished for her financial security. Annie discussed how the woman's sudden wealth raised suspicions among the townspeople. Josie, overhearing the conversation, noticed peculiarities in the hotel's menu card that led her to suspect Tom Linnet, the night clerk. Josie deduced that Tom might be involved in a conspiracy, possibly printing disloyal circulars. She realized that Tom's nighttime duties provided him with the opportunity to engage in illicit activities. Josie's encounter with Kauffman had inadvertently led her to uncover a potential criminal plot. She reflected on the recklessness of criminals and how their actions often left behind clues for discovery. Josie's investigative instincts were now on high alert as she pieced together the puzzle of the suspicious activities happening in the town.|"['1.

Josie went out after breakfast and bought an asbestos table-mat from a hardware store. She returned to her room, locked the door, and carefully replaced the fuse in a bomb with asbestos fiber to prevent an explosion. Josie cleverly hid the bomb in a satchel and placed it back in a room nearby. When Kauffman, the occupant of the room, returned, Josie had to quickly escape using the fire-escape to avoid being caught. She climbed up to the next window and saw an old lady resting inside.

Suspicious pamphlets have circulated in Dorfield, aiming to disrupt Liberty Bond sales, provoke resentment towards conscription, and foster animosity towards our allies, the English. These pamphlets were penned by John Dyer, the school superintendent, masquerading as a patriot. Printed in the Mansion House basement by night clerk Tom Linnet, who was handsomely paid. Evidence found in Dyer's desk implicates him as a German agent receiving large sums from the Imperial German Government. Abe Kauffman, posing as a suspender salesman, acts as the link between Dyer and the Master Spy. Kauffman orchestrated a bombing at the Airplane Factory through Linnet, who has now acquired wealth. Kauffman possesses another bomb, likely targeting the steel works. Dyer, accompanied by Mrs. Augusta Charleworth, a German sympathizer, is en route to Washington to retrieve incriminating evidence.

Josie had carefully devised her plans that afternoon, determined to shadow Abe Kauffman every step of the way. With the early darkness setting in, she quickly changed into a dark, inconspicuous outfit and armed herself with her father's pearl-mounted revolver. Her focus was on Kauffman, anticipating his movements. However, her attention was diverted when she spotted Tom Linnet pacing in the deserted alley. Concerned about potential interference, she observed him waiting for someone, suspecting he might be involved with Kauffman's schemes.
