"**Table of Subvocals and Aspirates**

In articulating subvocals and aspirates, the vocal organs are positioned similarly, but for aspirates, breath is forcefully expelled without any vocal sound. Examples include:  
- Subvocals: b (babe), p (rap), d (bad), t (at), g (nag), k (book), j (judge), ch (rich), v (move), f (life), th (with), th (Smith), z (buzz), s (hiss), z (azure), sh (rush).  
- Aspirates: p (pull), f (life), t (at), s (his), h (rush), k (cap), ch (machine), k (chaos).  

**Substitute for**:  
- a as in o (what), y as in i (hymn), e as in a (there), c as in s (cite), e as in a (freight), c as in k (cap), i as in e (police), ch as in sh (machine), i as in e (sir), ch as in k (chaos), o as in u (son), g as in j (cage), o as in oo (would), n as in ng (rink), o as in oo (work), x as gz (examine), u as in oo (pull), gh as f (laugh"|"['1.

Vices go against nature. Foolishness is never satisfied with itself. Pride desires a lot, not nature. The small gossip laughed during the storm. Titus helps the difficult outcasts. A greedy partner lacks wealth. None of you know where the problem lies. Sometimes, you must endure what can't be fixed. You can't fool experienced people. Respect others' opinions. Lightning flashed, and thunder roared. Holding hands affectionately. They grew shrubs and plants. He chose his words carefully. His lips twitched, showing a hint of disdain. Wisdom brings joy. Oh, wind, guiding me! Stop boasting about things to be ashamed of. After life's challenges, he rests. Can you pierce his skin with sharp objects? Stars shining brightly. And crowns of angels on the ground. Waking up late in the morning. Bad habits don't change quickly. You guided the old boats over the cliffs. You fixed the torn, shipwrecked sails. The shepherd's cold. The heiress in casual clothes is funny. The brave knight acts conservatively. The delightful idea of champagne and sugar.|"[""1. What is the main idea of the passage?\nA.

It is important to understand the distinction between the rising and falling inflections in sentences. The rising inflection usually occurs at the end of a question, while the falling inflection is often used at the end of a statement. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For instance, when a sentence concludes with a negative clause or a contrast, it may end with a rising inflection. Emphasis can also influence the inflection used in a sentence. In cases where a word requires the rising inflection but is emphasized, it may take the falling inflection instead. Understanding these nuances in inflection can help convey different meanings in speech.|['1.

"In a tale of contrasts, Shakespeare's Hamlet showcases the power of emphasis through tone. When faced with a poisoned king and a son's perceived disrespect, Hamlet's retort contrasts the severity of crimes. The rising and falling inflections mark the irony in the Spaniards' false promises of protection to the Peruvians. The hypothetical use of the word ""so"" in a conditional context demonstrates the importance of inflection changes. Emphasis, whether through force, inflection, or tone, serves to highlight essential words in a sentence, guiding the reader's understanding. This literary technique, marked by accents and inflections, adds depth and meaning to the text, enhancing the reader's experience."|"[""1.

Emphasis is crucial in reading and speaking, giving life to language. It includes accent and inflection, but emphasis is key. Pauses for emphasis, even if not grammatically required, are essential. These pauses, known as rhetorical pauses, occur before or after an emphatic word or phrase. Each sentence in conversation has varying tones and forces, with a prevailing pitch or key. This key sets the tone for the voice, with a range above and below called its compass. Choosing the right pitch is vital; too high tires the lungs, too low risks unclear speech. Monotony and improper pitch changes can make speech dull. Practice is essential to improve voice modulation, starting from a comfortable low pitch to gradually reach the highest pitch and back down. Different tones convey different emotions and styles, from persuasion to command, passion, sorrow, and argumentation.|['1.

Practicing with varying degrees of loudness can enhance the strength of your voice. Just like in music, where the same note can be played softly or loudly, sentences can also be pronounced with different levels of volume while maintaining the same pitch. To improve your vocal range, practice speaking softly and loudly on different keys. Remember to pause slightly at the end of each line to emphasize the rhythm and allow the listener to appreciate the harmony. It's important to adjust the pauses based on the sense of what you are reading. For example, when reading lines about Franklin's death, adjust the pauses to convey the meaning effectively. It's crucial to honor those who have made significant contributions to society rather than glorifying those solely driven by ambition.|"['1.

It is said that Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, faced a challenge when he couldn't read a petition due to his eyes being dazzled. His private secretary was absent, and the soldier who brought the petition couldn't read. A page was called, but he read too quickly and unclearly. The King then called another page who read slowly and with too much emphasis, which annoyed the King. Finally, a young girl, the daughter of a gardener, who had received a good education, was asked to read. Despite her initial nervousness, she read clearly and confidently for the King, showing that education and practice are key to effective communication.|"[""1.

Ernestine, a young girl with a passion for reading aloud, captivated her neighbors with her skill. She could decipher all kinds of handwriting, aiding those who couldn't read themselves. Once, the King handed her a petition, and as she read it, her emotions overflowed. The petition was from a widow pleading for her delicate son, drafted into the army against his wishes. Touched by the widow's plight, Ernestine's heartfelt reading moved the King to understand and act. Impressed by her abilities, the King tasked her to write an order for the son's discharge. This act of kindness not only reunited the widow with her son but also kickstarted the son's career as a portrait painter.

The clock conversation went like this: The pendulum felt tired after calculating it had swung 86,400 times in a day. The dial, surprised by the pendulum's weariness, asked for six strokes to prove a point. The pendulum found no fatigue in the six strokes but dreaded the millions it had to do.

The weights urged the pendulum to carry on, and the clockwork resumed its normal rhythm, showing that a moment at a time is all that's needed.|"[""1.

Once in your life, a button missing from your shirt can lead to a big fuss. If you didn't get upset, Mr. Caudle, you don't know how you act when you're angry. I'm always ready to sew buttons back on, taking care of you and the children. Yet, if a button goes missing from your shirt, why the outcry? It's a rare occurrence, Mr. Caudle, just once or twice. You should remember how well I look after your buttons. If I had kept your shirts from when we first married, you'd see the difference. You always shut me out when I try to speak, thinking a wife's only concern should be her husband's buttons. Marriage is more than that. It wouldn't be surprising if women knew the truth, they might think twice about marriage. It's strange, I suspect you removed the button just to have something to complain about.

The bear, a massive creature standing ten feet tall, faced relentless attacks from the hungry waves. First, one wave would strike his hindquarters, then swiftly retreat into the sea. Following, a more daring wave would crash onto his back with such force that it seemed to threaten his very existence. Yet, the bear remained unperturbed, the waves only serving to cleanse his fur. As the bear turned to confront his assailants, they would retreat into the depths. Subsequently, another wave would charge at him head-on, but the bear remained calm, his mane glistening with the sea's touch. The waves continued their assault, surrounding the bear, but he emerged unscathed, his fur untouched by the fierce onslaught. The scene was a masterpiece of nature's artistry, with the waves sculpting the ice with delicate precision and adding hues of emerald and azure to the spectacle. The climax came when a massive iceberg began to crack and fall, creating a breathtaking display of power and beauty.|"[""1.

The quail is a bird that stays close to home, living where the farmer works. In all seasons, from spring to winter, you can hear his cheerful whistle from the same places. Treat him kindly, and he may even visit your barnyard and sing for you in the apple tree. When May arrives, the quail pairs off to raise their young in safety. During the oat harvest, be careful not to step on their eggs. The mother quail is devoted to her children, teaching them how to survive. Her dedication is a beautiful example of parental love, unlike some creatures who do not show such care. The mother quail will call her chicks with a distinctive sound, and they will gather around her, showing the purest form of family unity.|"['1.

The wealthy man's son inherits desires, longing for luxurious food, while the hardworking peasants toil with bare arms. The rich son grows weary in his comfortable chair, a legacy one might not desire. In contrast, the poor man's son inherits strong muscles, a resilient heart, and a spirit unyielding. He is the master of his labor and art, a heritage fit for a king. The poor man's son finds joy in simple things, content with the merits of hard work. He inherits a rank earned through labor, a heart that sings in toil, and a fellow-feeling that brings blessings.

Philosophy is the study of reasons and causes, whether it's about a crazy man's dreams or roasting potatoes. Have you thought about it? Let me ask you a question: Why does the damp breath on a good knife disappear faster than on a bad one? It's not just about the polish. It took me a week of experiments to figure it out. The answer lies in the compactness of the material. A well-tempered blade has smaller pores, so the breath evaporates quicker. It's like how a wet sponge dries slower than dry wood. Another mystery is why the earth freezes harder under a trodden path. It's not just compactness, but the obstruction of warm air streams. The trodden path blocks the warm air, letting frost penetrate deeper.|"[""1.

The teacher, Mr. Bunker, challenged Locke to explain why smoke rises. Locke used a small cast-iron cart box and a tin cup filled with water to demonstrate. He asked the boy if he had ever noticed the difference in air temperature near the ceiling of a heated room compared to near the floor. The boy realized that cold air settles down, pushing the hot air up, just like the water in the cup with the iron box. The hot air carries the smoke up, similar to feathers in a whirlwind.

In the woods during autumn, red and gray squirrels are busy casting down chestnut burrs. They are so engrossed in this activity that you can hear the burrs falling all around you. A sportsman even witnessed a green chestnut burr mysteriously appearing far from any chestnut tree. In winter, squirrels bury nuts under the snow, creating hidden stashes. Their paths in the snow lead directly to these buried treasures, showing their remarkable memory or sense of smell. Red squirrels make their winter homes underground near evergreens, strategically close to nut-bearing trees. They meticulously cut off pine cones before they ripen, ensuring a food supply for winter. The nuts left on the ground or buried beneath it are perfectly positioned for germination, thanks to the squirrels' actions.|"['1.

Sometimes, while walking through the woods in the autumn, you might hear a noise like a twig snapping. Looking up, you could spot a jay pecking at an acorn or a group of them gathered in the treetops to break it off. The jays then fly to a branch, hold the acorn under their foot, and start hammering at it, making a tapping sound like a woodpecker. They keep a lookout for any danger, nibble on the meat inside, and often drop the remains to the ground. William Barton noted that jays are vital for spreading seeds of trees and plants they eat. Squirrels also play a role in dropping nuts in open areas, contributing to the growth of oaks and walnuts. Every new tree starts from a seed, and these birds and animals help in replanting cleared lands.|['1.

In the natural world, animals display remarkable abilities without the need for tools. They construct homes and nests using instincts and resources provided by nature.

In ancient times, discouragement was a common theme. People would deter others from new inventions, like the wheel, by pointing out flaws and failures of the past. They believed that traditional methods were sufficient and that new ideas were unnecessary and doomed to fail. These discouragers would highlight any imperfection, no matter how small, to undermine the success of innovative projects. Even today, there are individuals who thrive on spreading negativity and doubt. They find fault in every endeavor, focusing solely on the flaws rather than appreciating the beauty or potential of the creation. It is essential to recognize and ignore these discouragers to pursue our dreams and innovations without being held back by their pessimism.|['1.

Some individuals who pour cold water on new ideas have various motivations. Some do so out of genuine fear that new attempts will fail, while others may act out of envy or ill-natured intentions. Additionally, there is a sense of power and wisdom in predicting negative outcomes, as it is deemed safer to foresee failure since initial success is rare. Lack of imagination also contributes to discouragement, as understanding groundbreaking inventions like steam engines and electric telegraphs can be mentally taxing for the average person. Inventors often face criticism and are labeled as madmen due to the lack of sympathy and appreciation for their efforts. This unkind discouragement not only affects inventors but also impacts society as a whole, diminishing the joy and hope in daily life.|['1.

The vast number of wild pigeons in our forests is truly remarkable. I have personally witnessed this spectacle many times and still find it hard to believe. In the autumn of 1813, while traveling from Henderson to Louisville, I saw flocks of pigeons flying in astonishing numbers. I attempted to count them but quickly realized it was impossible as they filled the sky. Even during a stop at Young's inn near Salt River, I observed endless legions passing by, creating a breathtaking sight. Their aerial acrobatics, especially when evading a hawk, were like a majestic dance in the sky. These pigeons are not just beautiful but also efficient in finding food, swiftly clearing large areas of fallen mast as they forage.

During certain times when the woods are full of these pigeons, they are hunted in large quantities, yet their numbers don't seem to decrease. At midday, after eating, they rest on trees to digest. As the sun sets, they fly in groups to their roosting spot, sometimes hundreds of miles away. Let's explore one of these roosting places on the Green River in Kentucky. The area was vast, with massive trees and little undergrowth. Broken trees and branches showed the immense number of birds that gather here. People prepared to receive them with sulfur pots, torches, poles, and guns. When the pigeons arrived, it was deafening. They landed in huge masses on the branches, causing chaos and destruction.

"The commotion lasted all night, and curious about its reach, I dispatched a forest expert. He returned after two hours, having heard the noise distinctly three miles away.

The wild pigeon, like many game species, is dwindling yearly. Richard Henry Stoddard, a renowned poet, gives insight into nature's balance and the changing landscape.

Upon his passing, his eldest son George inherited the estate, while Harry, his younger twin, was reminded to show respect.

We then relax our energy and decide not to be afraid of crimes far away. We trust our own strength and dare to approach what we promised never to touch. We enter the realms of comfort and rest in the safety of security. Our hearts soften, and our watchfulness decreases. We start wondering if we can take another step forward and glance at the pleasures awaiting us. With caution, we step into these pleasures, feeling fearful and hesitant, always hoping to navigate through without losing sight of the path of virtue. Temptation follows temptation, leading us to compromise our innocence for fleeting pleasures. Slowly, we forget our original purpose and get lost in the pursuit of luxury and indulgence. As we age, we reflect on our lives with regret and wish we had stayed true to virtue. It's a lesson, my child, to never lose hope in reforming oneself, even when time has passed and strength has waned.
