The St. Augustine Power Boat Club's dock was used for a movie shoot. Mr. Pertell and his crew prepared to film a boat scene. The powerful motorboats were ready, each with a skilled skipper and a mechanic. The cameras clicked as the actors performed their scenes. The boats raced, creating excitement with loud engines and splashing waves. Russ captured the action from different angles. The crew filmed at a fort and an alligator farm. Plans were made to film at Lake Kissimmee and other natural spots. The day ended with a mishap involving Mr. Sneed's coat splashing water on Mr. Towne. Despite setbacks, everyone worked hard to create a successful film.|"[""**1.

During a break in the discussion, Claude Towne politely interrupted Mr. Pertell to inquire about the wilderness they were to visit. He asked if it was a very untamed area. Mr. Pertell, with a serious tone, mentioned the Seminole Indians, an ancient and proud group, suggesting that a formal suit might not be suitable for them. He assured Towne that they wouldn't encounter as many Seminoles as he had seen at the alligator farm due to hunting. The group prepared for their journey to Lake Kissimmee, ensuring they had enough film. There was a mix of excitement and apprehension among the players, with some disappointed by the lack of society at the destination. Despite this, Ruth and Alice welcomed the change.

Ruth asked if anyone had searched for the missing girls, feeling a sense of apprehension as she glanced around the parlor. She then explained that they had met the girls on a train during a trip to the New England backwoods for filming. The girls, Helen and her sister, were helping their father, a naturalist, in his search for a rare orchid. Unfortunately, their father fell ill before he could embark on the expedition. The girls, determined to assist their father, set out on their own in a motorboat to find the elusive orchid. However, they never returned, prompting a search party that yielded no significant leads. The hotel in Sycamore served as a base for the filming crew, surrounded by lush vegetation and serene landscapes that captured the girls' fascination.|"['1.

The play revolved around a Southern girl's elopement, her father's pursuit, her marriage, and her parents' forgiveness. One scene depicted the couple fleeing through the wilderness and resting beneath the palms while evading their pursuers. Mr. Pertell directed Mr. Towne to act as a disappointed lover, urging him to run faster and show more desperation. However, in his attempt to convey anger, Mr. Towne slipped into a muddy stream, splashing his white suit. Despite the challenges of moviemaking, actors often face risky situations to meet the public's demand for realism.

Mr. Bunn found himself in a dangerous situation when he stumbled into a bog during a filming session. His friends, who initially thought it was part of his acting, realized the seriousness of the situation when a steamer hand confirmed the danger. With quick thinking and teamwork, they managed to rescue Mr. Bunn using a rope. Despite the scare, Mr. Bunn showed courage and forgiveness, understanding the risks that come with their line of work. As they made their way back to the steamer, the crew regretted not capturing the rescue on film, realizing it would have made a thrilling movie scene.

A few days later, the filming of Mr. Bunn in the quicksand scene was completed, and it was announced that they would move to a new location down the river for a different backdrop. Some scenes were shot on the steamer. When the captain decided to dock for a while to allow the crew to gather wood, Mr. Pertell agreed. As the boat anchored, Russ continued filming. Suddenly, the boat they were filming started moving upstream unintentionally pulling a sea cow. The sea cow, trying to free itself, created chaos. Paul attempted to fend off the sea cow with an oar, causing it to free itself and swim away. Despite the unexpected scene, Mr. Pertell was confident he could incorporate it into the drama.

They left the area of the alligator hunt and ventured further into the wilderness. Though not far from Sycamore in reality, the palm forests and cypress swamps made it feel like a vast distance. The upper deck of the _Magnolia_ provided a pleasant journey under the shade of an awning, shielding them from the sun. Despite the loneliness and eerie solitude, occasional sightings of fishermen's boats and alligator hunters broke the monotony. The company enjoyed the tranquility interrupted by the harsh cries of passing waterfowl and the occasional appearance of saurians slipping into the water. Mr. Pertell decided to dock for the night at a picturesque spot, promising suitable scenery for their filming endeavors.

Russ confessed, somewhat proudly, that he might have grazed the creature with a shot from his gun.

Russ and Paul decided to stay aboard the boat, deeming it the safest option for the night. As they approached the palm leaf hut on shore, they noticed its crude construction. Despite the hut's appearance, the group pressed on towards it. Russ speculated that it might have been built by a native or hunters seeking temporary shelter. Inside, they found two rough bunks made of sticks and covered with Spanish moss, along with some blankets for comfort. The hut seemed to have been recently occupied, as evidenced by the presence of the moored motor boat.
