The old whaling ship, the _Gull_, was now repurposed for a different adventure. Hank, an experienced sailor, guided the crew towards two whales in the Indian Ocean. As they approached the feeding giants, a mishap occurred when Gloomy, a sailor, lost control of his oar. Startled by the close encounter, the whales vanished underwater. Despite the setback, Hank identified a gray whale nearby and decided to pursue it. The crew, led by Hank, rowed towards the spot where the whale was last seen. With determination and skill, they closed in on the elusive creature, waiting patiently for its next appearance. The tense anticipation filled the air as they prepared for another chance to capture the magnificent gray whale.|"['1.

The whaler explained that whales can stay underwater for about ten to fifteen minutes, sometimes longer. The boat sped towards a whale, but it dived before they could shoot. The whaler guided the boat to the perfect spot where the whale would surface. The whale emerged, and the whaler harpooned it. The whale dove, dragging the boat with it. The men worked quickly to reel in the line. The whale resurfaced, and the whaler harpooned it again. The whale then turned towards the boat, causing a tense moment.

The two oars in front gently dipped into the water, moving the boat a short distance before pausing for the next stroke. Colin wished he could help row to escape the massive whale charging towards them. Hank, however, remained calm. Just as the whale almost reached them, Scotty suddenly shouted. Startled, Colin saw Hank swiftly lunge with a steel lance, causing the whale to dive and resurface spouting blood. Hank managed to evade the whale's next attack and successfully struck it with the lance. With a grin, the experienced whaler reassured Colin about his fear. The whale eventually sank, but the crew on the ship had been anxious until they saw the buoy marking the whale's location. Colin wanted to hear more stories from the old whaler but decided to wait until they were back on the ship.|"['1.

"""Hank is a unique man,"" the captain whispered. ""I doubt if anyone else on the Pacific Coast could have succeeded with a gray whale. I prefer having him aboard over many other mates, and as a gunner, he's like a petty officer.""

""Reef the fore and main topgallants,"" he ordered. ""Take in the topsails. Colin, furl the fore topgallant sail, and if the men are still busy on the topsail yards, secure the main topgallant sail as well.""

""Yes, sir,"" the boy replied eagerly, enjoying being up high. He climbed the shrouds to the fore-topgallant yard and neatly furled the sail.

""What's the difference between a 'finback' and a 'humpback,' Hank?"" the boy inquired, once the sails were stowed and the ship, under auxiliary steam, kept pace with the whales. ""Are they 'right' whales?""

""Neither of them,"" Hank explained. ""There are two types of right whales: the bowhead and the black. They both have fine whalebone, acting as a filter in their mouths. Humpbacks and finbacks are hunted for oil, and they look distinct. A humpback is bulkier with a short fin on its back and is clumsy, often lifting its tail flukes out of the water.

The captain explained that the whaling industry has evolved over time. In the past, whaling ships would go on long voyages, processing the blubber at sea to extract oil. Nowadays, whaling is done closer to the coast using steamers. The process involves blowing air into the whale's body to help it float and be towed to a factory for oil extraction. The blubber is processed into oil, the meat is used, and even the water from the process is repurposed. This efficient method ensures that all parts of the whale are utilized. The story unfolds as the crew prepares to hunt another whale, highlighting the changes in whaling practices over the years.|"[""1.

Unaware of the tragedy that had befallen her calf, the mother whale dove deep into the ocean, not resurfacing for nearly twenty minutes. As she emerged, Colin and Hank on the ship wondered why they didn't pursue her. The old whaler explained that she would come looking for her calf and advised against harming them intentionally. The mother whale soon approached the vessel, circling the lifeless calf. Hank took a shot at her, causing her to dive sharply, attracting a group of fierce creatures known as killers. They attacked the mother whale, causing chaos and tragedy. In a desperate attempt to save herself, the mother whale charged at the ship, resulting in a terrifying collision. The crew was left stunned and the ship was damaged, requiring immediate action to prevent sinking.|"['1.

Hank explained the decline in fur seals due to overhunting, comparing it to the fate of the buffalo. The government now protects them, banning seal hunting at sea. The captain navigated through dense fog towards a seal rookery, where seals performed playful antics. The boat approached a village where Aleuts, now government employees, lived comfortably with schools and fair wages. Colin shared their recent whale encounter and shipwreck with the curious villagers. The residents quickly offered warm meals to the shipwrecked crew.

"""They are often trodden on,"" explained the agent. ""It can't be avoided. Only a few pups stay in the harems, and they are all small. They leave when they are just a week old, wandering away to find playmates. They form 'pods' or nurseries, sometimes with four or five hundred pups in one nursery. They stay there until the end of the season. Look, there's a pod of pups,"" he pointed up the beach, ""about sixty of them, I'd say. They look happy, don't they?""

""A sea-catch doesn't pay attention to anything outside the harem. If a pup is within twelve feet of him, he will fight instantly if the baby is in danger. But once the pup is in the nursery, the bull seal forgets about it. He can't leave anyway, or another sea-catch would take over the harem.""

The agent explained that bull seals don't sleep much, taking short catnaps of five to ten minutes. They are light sleepers, waking up immediately if a cow tries to leave or an intruder approaches. Despite fasting for over three months, surviving on blubber, they remain vigilant, fighting and watching. By the end of June, they are heavy and fat, but by August, they become thin. Cows arrive in waves over six weeks, leading to fights for harems along the water's edge. The agent pointed out ongoing battles between bulls. A cow seal cautiously navigated through the seals, avoiding beachmasters' attention.|"['1.

The cow attempted to escape from her new master, who had cruelly flung her onto the rocks along with his company. Dissatisfied with him, she tried to flee, but the old sea-catch viciously bit and tore her skin, leaving ugly wounds. The agent explained that battles among seals are common, and one cannot intervene in every conflict. As the cow squirmed away from her captor, a younger bull approached, challenging the older bull. A fierce battle ensued, with the younger bull inflicting wounds on the older one. Despite being injured, the old bull retaliated, causing severe wounds on the younger bull. In a surprising move, the younger bull bit and lifted the cow, angering the old sea-catch.

Colin felt a deep sympathy for the injured cow seal lying on the rocks after being mistreated by the beachmasters. Despite her wounds and bloodied appearance, his friend assured him that the injuries were superficial and would heal quickly. The conversation revealed that these seals, especially the females, endured many fights but recovered remarkably well. The importance of not harming cow seals due to their role in giving birth to baby seals was emphasized. The young male seals, known as bachelors, were warned to stay away from the rookery to avoid conflict with the older sea-catches.

The sea-catches create a narrow eight-foot road through the rookery, allowing only two holluschickie to pass at a time. The beachmasters, guarding their harems on either side, vigilantly watch over this path. Any holluschickie straying and touching a cow on the sides of this road will face a savage attack. The old bulls lining the road will not hesitate to defend their territory. Despite the potential danger, the bachelors navigate this road in an orderly manner, moving up and down in the middle without turning to the sides. Observing the peaceful behavior of the holluschickie on the upland plain, Colin marvels at their synchronized movements, akin to a military parade.

The Aleuts carefully skinned the seals with expert precision, leaving only a small patch of the upper lip, the tail, and the flippers' hide. Colin observed the process, impressed by the skillful technique. After finishing, the Aleuts directed Colin to the sea-lions nearby, advising him to approach cautiously. As Colin ventured closer to the sea-lion rookery, he encountered a massive bull sea-lion and its equally imposing female counterpart. When Colin attempted to throw a stone towards the sea-lion, it panicked and clumsily fled into the water, followed by the rest of the rookery.

Long ago, off the coast of Suffolk, England, some fishermen caught a strange creature. They described it as part old man with long gray hair and part fish with a tail. This creature could live both in and out of the water. The fishermen brought it to the Earl of Orforde, but they couldn't teach it to speak. The local priest thought it might be connected to the devil, so they took it to church, but the creature didn't understand the ceremonies. They believed it was evil and tortured it, only to discover it was a fake—a monkey's head and shoulders attached to a fish's body with meticulously placed fish scales.

Colin was torn between his father's wishes for him to take up lumbering and his own interest in joining the Fisheries Bureau. His father, a lumberman, believed Colin should inherit the family timber lands. However, Colin was more drawn to the Bureau due to his passion for fishing. The agent warned Colin about the seriousness of the Bureau's work, emphasizing its value to the people of the United States. Despite the agent's caution, Colin remained enthusiastic about the variety of fish and the Bureau's work. Encouraged by the agent, Colin decided to join the Bureau. The next day, as the revenue cutter prepared to depart for Valdez, Colin hurriedly made arrangements to send a blue fox pup home and packed his belongings. During the journey, Colin's excitement grew as he learned more about the Bureau's work, especially the massive salmon drives in Alaska.|"[""1.

The officer suggested that before Colin made any decisions, he should understand the work involved. He mentioned a friend on the Columbia River studying salmon and offered Colin a letter of introduction. The lieutenant advised Colin to visit the professor's cottage near a fish hatchery in Chinook, Wash., on his way to Santa Catalina. The officer believed Colin should see the work related to the Bureau of Fisheries to grasp his future tasks. Colin then traveled to Astoria and met the professor, who explained his research on salmon diseases. The professor planned an experiment on salmon behavior, emphasizing the importance of understanding fish habits. He highlighted the significance of small details in scientific studies, comparing it to the impact of minor differences in wheat growth.

The professor questioned Colin about the impact of seal hunting on the Pribilof Islands. Colin explained that while pelagic sealing had almost wiped out seals due to their limited reproduction, fish were different as they lay thousands of eggs. The conversation shifted to the importance of allowing some salmon to spawn in rivers to ensure future populations. The professor highlighted the challenge of balancing immediate profits with sustainable fishing practices. He mentioned the role of fishery laws and government supervision in regulating fishing activities. Colin suggested catching salmon on their way back downstream, but the professor explained that Pacific salmon die after spawning, unlike Atlantic salmon. This cycle of life and death in the rivers sustains the fish population for future generations.|"['1.

The Pacific salmon has a unique life cycle. When they are ready to spawn, their digestive parts shrink, preventing them from eating. Male salmon develop a hooked upper lip, making it impossible for them to open their mouths wide enough to eat. As they swim upstream, their scales turn slimy and they face injuries and skin diseases from leaping falls and rapids. The journey for some salmon species can span up to a thousand miles. The instinct of salmon is to swim upstream to spawn, even overcoming obstacles. They create nests in gravel and sand to lay eggs. To transport live fish, a special contraption called a live car is used to ensure their safety. It is important to handle the fish carefully to prevent injuries and scale loss, which can lead to diseases.|['1.

The professor shared that some fish can breathe better out of water for a short time, but their gills stick together, causing them to suffocate. Salmon can survive out of water for a few minutes, with some even lasting hours. Certain fish, like those from Samoa, belonging to the skippy family, live mostly on rocks and jump between them instead of swimming. Some are vegetarians, with smaller gills. These fish are only in the water briefly during high tide, residing in moist seaweed until the tide rises. The boy, tired from fishing, was relieved as the last fish was caught. The hatchery was simple, with water flowing through boxes to hatch fish. The foreman demonstrated how salmon eggs are fertilized and cared for until hatching, a process that takes about five months.|['1.

Nearly a year has passed since the first batch of fish eggs were hatched in the early spring run. Most of the tiny fish have already hatched, leaving only a few eggs in the tray. These newly hatched fish are still attached to the yolk of the egg, making it hard for them to move freely in the water. The foreman explained to Colin that it will take about six weeks for the fish to absorb the yolk completely. They are fed tiny grubs, worms, and liver until they are ready to be released into a natural stream. The foreman then suggested that Colin try sport-fishing while staying over at Santa Catalina. He warned Colin that catching a big salmon would be challenging but rewarding. As they set out on a small catboat for the fishing grounds, the professor mentioned the awe-inspiring sight of salmon leaping up falls and rapids, a spectacle Colin had witnessed in Alaskan rivers.|"[""1.

With a loud scream, the fishing reel made a sharp sound as the fish darted off, pulling almost a hundred feet of line. The angler held the brake tight, quickly tiring out the fish. As the fish turned towards the boat, the professor skillfully reeled in the line at lightning speed. The salmon tried to break away when it saw the boat, but the angler swiftly reeled it in and caught it. This repeated several times until five fish were caught. Suddenly, a strange creature emerged from the water, with a green head, large eyes, and spines on its back. Colin, startled, thought it resembled a sea serpent. Despite the distraction, he continued to fight a salmon until his line snapped. The professor bravely jumped into the water and managed to capture the mysterious sea creature.

Colin, a young angler, impressed Major Dare with his catch of a tuna over a hundred pounds. Despite the fish weighing in at one hundred and four pounds, Colin was awarded a blue button by the fishing club. His enthusiasm for fishing grew, and he landed other impressive catches like a thirty-pound yellow-tail. However, he faced challenges with larger fish, losing three tuna in the following weeks. Colin's interest in squid as bait led to a squid-hunting adventure, despite initial hesitations from his mother. With the help of boatman Vincente, Colin learned about the habits of squid and how to catch them.

Slowly, the two fishermen herded the squid back through the kelp to a bay. The water turned dark as the squid released ink. Vincente swiftly harpooned one, and Colin, with a quick throw, speared another. The caught squid clung to the bottom fiercely. Colin's success turned chaotic when a squid latched onto him, trying to drag him into the depths. Fear gripped him, but he managed to break free. Vincente deftly handled the captured squid, showing how they lose strength out of water. As they landed, they encountered a crab facing off with an octopus camouflaged on the sandy bottom. The sunset painted the sky, but Colin remained alert, watching the sea's wonders unfold.|"['1.

In a sudden turn of events, Colin found himself face to face with an octopus as it lunged towards a crab on the sand. The octopus swiftly wrapped its tentacles around the crab, immobilizing it. Despite his initial repulsion, Colin bravely approached the octopus. Just as he was about to capture it, the creature made a surprising dash back to the sea. Determined to catch it, Colin chased after the octopus, only to trip and fall on top of it. In a struggle, Colin found himself covered in the octopus's inky fluid. With the help of Vincente, Colin managed to free himself from the creature's grasp. After a comical mishap, Colin ended up jumping into the water to clean off the ink. This adventure with the octopus further fueled Colin's passion for marine life, leading him to express his desire to work with the Bureau of Fisheries, much to his father's surprise and skepticism.|"['1.

The Deputy Commissioner explained that volunteer work at the Bureau is usually for specialized research, done by paid assistants or university professors. However, an opportunity arose for Colin to assist a friend at the American Museum of Natural History on a trip to Bermuda. This trip would provide valuable experience in studying sea-life not typically researched by the Bureau. The friend intended to create a model showcasing sea-gardens with sea anemones, corals, sponges, and fish peculiar to coral reefs. This hands-on experience would be a great learning opportunity for Colin, broadening his knowledge beyond the Bureau's focus on backboned fishes.

Following the advice, Colin casually entered the small town and rented a bike. He discovered that the roads were ideal for cycling, with only one steep hill that was challenging to ride. Despite hearing that distances in Bermuda were short, he was amazed that an hour of cycling covered almost half of the main island. Everything appeared small, and armed with a camera, he captured snapshots at every turn, each more captivating than the last. Bermuda's charm proved too subtle for photographs. While heading to Devil's Hole along the south shore, Colin noticed the stark contrast to the desolate north shore. The south shore boasted higher cliffs, rocks jutting into the sea, white sandy stretches, and coral atolls visible on the water's surface. He paused at the former home of Irish poet Thomas Moore and sat beneath the famous Calabash Tree. Colin also explored the stunning stalactite caves, illuminated for visitors. His main destination was Devil's Hole, a mysterious pool surrounded by trees, connected to the sea by underground channels. Colin was intrigued by the fish feeding ritual, where different fish responded to distinct sounds, showcasing their intelligence.|"['1.

In about ten seconds, the water teemed with fish, swirling around and rising in groups from the deep water. They all suddenly turned black, a sign they were about to feed. The narrator mentioned showing this behavior before. Then, in a frenzy, the fish made a dash for their prey, a poor beast that had no chance against the swarm. Despite attempts to rescue it, the groupers devoured it entirely down to the bones. The keeper explained that in Bermuda, it wasn't sharks but moray eels that were the threat, lurking near the coral atolls. He shared a tale of a diver who narrowly escaped a moray attack while collecting specimens.

Colin was surprised but followed his companion's instructions, taking the sketch block and pad while securing his water glass to the boat. His companion had a unique water glass with a lens and a reflector to view the reefs from a different angle. By using this glass, they could observe the reefs accurately and avoid distortions. They each sketched the reefs, one from above and the other from the side, to capture the true colors and perspectives. Colin, engrossed in his work, lost track of time until lunch was announced.

Colin quickly realized that the tasks given to him by the head of the collecting team were not only demanding but also required a lot of creativity. Sometimes he was tasked with finding starfish, which meant traveling to a well-known shoal, possibly on a government boat like the _Phalarope_. They used 'tangles,' which are iron frames with long strips of cotton waste trailing behind, to dredge and catch sea creatures like sea urchins and starfish. Occasionally, they embarked on longer journeys, like to the Gulf Stream on the _Fish Hawk_, the biggest boat in the Bureau's fleet. The excitement of hauling the fish-trap from the _Blue Wing_ boat never waned. Every trip felt like a new adventure, with the hope of discovering new species. The old collector even shared stories of catching tropical fish during storms, explaining how they followed the drifting weed. Despite some fish being unpopular for consumption, like dogfish, efforts were made to explore their potential as food sources.|"[""1.

In the rivers of the Midwest and South, the 'mad-Tom' catfish is known for its spines that can cut and hurt. While there are fish with poison that can harm, like the scorpion-fish and toad-fishes, they are not usually fatal. However, a collector shared a tragic tale of a man who was killed by a Portuguese man-o'-war jellyfish. Swimming in Bahamian waters, the man swam recklessly into the jellyfish and was fatally stung. Another man recalled being paralyzed by a torpedo fish in his youth. Despite these dangers, the Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole was described as an exciting and lively place, with a rose garden and a government pier used by various services.

On the contrary, there are many enemies that threaten oysters. Various fish, like skates, prey on oysters, leading some oyster farmers to protect their beds with stakes. Drum-fish are a threat on the Atlantic coast, and sting-rays require substantial protection on the Pacific coast. Starfish are particularly destructive as they feed on shellfish. They attach themselves to oysters and exert a relentless pull until the shell gives way. Vessels use boiling water to control the starfish population. The oyster-drill, a sea-snail, is the most dangerous enemy, destroying up to eighty percent of oyster crops. Solving this problem is crucial, and the Bureau of Fisheries is working on finding a solution to protect the oyster population.|['1. What is the main purpose of using boiling water in the text?\nA.

Colin proposed a new idea, suggesting a chemical to make oyster shells harmful to drills without affecting the oysters for food. However, the director doubted its effectiveness due to the changing marine environment. Despite this, he believed a solution exists and welcomed suggestions. The director then revealed a surprise about Dr. Jimson's swordfish expedition. Colin, intrigued by the swordfish's power, agreed to join the trip. The next day, he boarded the _Phalarope_ to rendezvous with Dr. Jimson. Colin observed colorful buoys marking lobster traps in the bay, each color representing a different owner. He learned about the demanding and sometimes unrewarding life of a lobsterman, who must rebait traps and release undersized lobsters.|"['1.

Colin, eager to learn about the lobster business, bombarded the captain of the _Phalarope_ with questions as they sailed towards New Bedford, the old whaling hub. Although the town's charm had been marred by cotton mills, Colin felt a thrill seeing swordfish schooners at the pier. The next day, Colin, with sharp eyes, volunteered to spot swordfish from the crow's-nest. He mistook a shark for a swordfish but learned to differentiate the two. Sitting under the scorching sun in the crow's-nest was no easy task, but Colin endured without complaint. During dinner, the sailors relieved him. The captain explained the differences between the spear-fish, swordfish, and narwhal's tusk. Later, on the swordfish schooner, the captain skillfully harpooned a swordfish, showcasing the art of swordfishing.|"['1.

In the Sierra Nevada Mountains, there are three unique streams with brightly colored granite rocks and gorgeous golden trout. These trout have evolved to blend in with their surroundings to protect themselves from predators like fish-hawks and eagles. The United States Government sent a team to study these fish, and they witnessed a remarkable storm while there. The team was determined to save these rare fish from extinction. Thanks to their efforts and the intervention of the President and the Bureau of Fisheries, the golden trout are now protected in the Mount Whitney National Park. Dr. Jimson shared his knowledge about various fish species with a young lad interested in trout. He recounted a fascinating story about a massive halibut caught while attacking a cod.

The scientist explained to the boy the diets of various fishes and how water gets aerated. His friend mentioned the fighting-fish, trained by fishermen for combats that draw big crowds. These fights are advertised widely and bring in significant gate receipts, with a percentage paid to the king. In Siam, these fish are specialized for combat, generating revenue through licenses. Villages own fish or teams, leading to intense rivalries. The Siamese are known for gambling on fish fights, sometimes causing food shortages. Some fish can breathe air and climb trees during tropical storms, hopping back to water afterward.

""Ready,"" the statistician replied. Colin realized they were testing a new net. The Fisheries expert was knowledgeable. Colin rowed with determination, feeling proud to contribute. The dory with two men followed closely. After a long pull, the seine-master exclaimed:"|"['1.

The Fisheries officer worked diligently without a word, handling a new type of net with different features. Despite its complexity, the small man managed to handle it skillfully, impressing the seine-master. The rowers were urged to exert their full effort to enclose the school of mackerel. As the wind picked up and a rain squall hit, the fishermen struggled to pull in the net. Despite doubts about its durability, the net held strong, capturing thousands of fish. The seine-master marveled at the efficiency of the new net, acknowledging its potential to save labor. The rain and wind intensified, adding to the challenge. Eventually, the _Shiner_ approached through the storm, signaling a successful catch despite the adverse weather conditions.|"[""1.

Colin was amazed at how the captain skillfully maneuvered the schooner in the strong wind, coming back precisely to their location. The _Shiner_ swiftly approached, with most of the crew boarding, leaving two behind to secure the seine-boat to the schooner. Colin joined the men on board, and they swiftly began hauling in a large dip-net filled with fish. Suddenly, a nearby foghorn sounded, catching everyone's attention. A gray ship loomed close, causing panic on deck. As the ship bore down on them, Colin witnessed the chaos unfold. The crew members leaped to safety just in time, except for Roote, who leaped overboard. Colin, still on deck, saw Roote hit by debris from the collision. Without hesitation, Colin dove into the water, rescuing Roote. Despite being a strong swimmer, Colin struggled to keep them both afloat in the rough sea. As exhaustion set in, Colin fought to stay above water, realizing the true challenge of swimming in open waters.|"[""1.
