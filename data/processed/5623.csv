The major was upset as he felt the younger generation lacked respect. Sam, a boy in the village, was disliked for his arrogance.

Ben was thrilled to secure a job offer after writing a letter to the advertisers in New York expressing interest in the position. The letter he received stated that he was chosen due to his excellent penmanship. Ben was required to deposit fifty dollars for handling money at the office, a much higher salary than usual for young clerks. On his way to the city, Ben overheard a conversation about possible swindlers in New York, which made him wary. Seeking advice, he consulted a bootblack who warned him about the high salary offer.

Mr. Fitch felt disappointed as Ben was leaving with the fifty dollars. Ben, serious about his decision, made Mr. Fitch anxious. Ben, realizing the setback, depended on Fitch & Ferguson's promises. Unsure of his future, he contemplated returning to his old life in the country. Reluctant to accept offers from Deacon Pitkin or Sam Sturgis, Ben even considered becoming a bootblack. Ben shared three travel options with Tom - by land, steamers via Panama, or a sailing vessel around Cape Horn. Tom and Ben then enjoyed a meal at a modest restaurant. Tom's appearance drew disapproving glances, but he remained unfazed. Ben, new to the city, found everything captivating, unlike Tom, a street-smart New Yorker. They entered a small room where a young lady in a green veil waited to engage passage.|"[""1.

"Dear Uncle Job,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to ask if you could kindly send me the rest of my clothes via express delivery to the hotel where I am currently staying. Unfortunately, the firm I came to visit turned out to be fraudulent, but I have managed to make new friends here. I have some exciting news to share - I will be sailing to California next Saturday. This sudden turn of events surprises me as much as it may surprise you, but I am looking forward to the adventure. I will send you a message from Panama if possible. Please give my love to Aunt and Cousin Jenny. I regret not being able to visit before my departure, but time is short. Rest assured, I am in good health and high spirits, and I believe my future looks promising.

Your affectionate nephew,
Ben

In the dark cabin deep in the woods, Ben feared an attack with no neighbors nearby. He peered through a makeshift window and saw Jack, the intruder, waiting to rob them. Jack fell asleep, giving Ben a chance to escape. But Ben hesitated, not wanting to leave Jake vulnerable. With Jack asleep, Ben faced a dilemma: to flee or stay. Jake was drugged and needed protection. Ben decided to stay the night, ensuring their safety despite the risk of robbery in the morning.|"['1.

During a tense night, Ben came up with a risky plan to protect their money from a potential thief. He decided to quietly sneak out of the cabin to hide the gold coins in a safe place. Ben carefully removed his shoes and stockings to avoid making noise as he descended the ladder. With great caution, he managed to take most of the money without disturbing his sleeping companion. Despite the risks involved, Ben successfully left the cabin without waking anyone. Once outside, he marveled at the towering pine trees surrounding the cabin, feeling a mix of fear and admiration for their immense size. Ben knew he had to find a secure spot to hide the money before dawn, hoping to put some distance between himself and the cabin to avoid any further trouble.|"['1.

Ben searched for a hidden spot near the cabin to stash the gold coins. He scanned the area but found no suitable place until he spotted a decaying tree with a hollow inside. Excited, he decided to hide the gold there, a spot unlikely to be discovered. After marking the tree's location, he returned to the cabin. Ben listened outside, ensuring everyone was asleep. Quietly climbing to the loft, he saw Bradley and Jack slumbering. Although Ben woke momentarily, he pretended to be asleep, curious to see Jack's reaction to the meager loot. Despite the urge to reveal his awareness, Ben remained still, allowing Jack to proceed with his plan, unaware of Ben's vigilance.|"['1.

"Stay! They might have hidden their money. The loft was empty of furniture, but their bags were tossed carelessly. Jack searched through their knapsacks but found nothing. He concluded they were as poor as they appeared. ""I don't want trouble. Hurry with breakfast, I need to leave before they wake. I don't want questions,"" Jack said. Following orders, his wife prepared breakfast. Jack ate without guilt, unconcerned about robbing the guests. Ben debated telling Bradley about the night's events.

Ben and his friend Bradley spent the day and night at Murphy's, generously hosted by the judge and the mayor. Ben eagerly listened to the miners' stories and their luck. If not for searching for Richard Dewey, Ben would have stayed, claimed a spot, and started work the next day. He was keen to experience the miners' exciting life. It felt like a constant adventure with the chance of finding gold anytime if you worked hard. The next morning, after breakfast, they set off towards the mountains to find Richard Dewey. The directions were vague, making success seem unlikely. After a long day, they found themselves without food. They went to a brook, caught trout for supper, and lay under the darkening sky feeling content. Ben was self-reliant and untroubled about the future, focused on making a living. Bill Mosely and Tom Hadley, two men from Missouri, joined them, offering tobacco and introducing themselves as tough and alert.|"[""1.

Bradley remained calm despite Mosely's intimidating demeanor. Ben, less experienced, viewed Mosely as a dangerous outlaw. Bradley shared a story of shooting a man in a saloon for winking at him. Despite the lack of potatoes and pudding, the visitors devoured their trout eagerly. Bradley recounted an accidental shooting incident involving his friend, Jim, whom he cared for until he recovered. He casually mentioned having been involved in numerous altercations, losing count after forty-seven. The visitors, fearing retribution for a past theft, considered stealing the mustangs for safety.

A group formed around the frightened Chinaman and the men who had captured him. The miners bombarded him with questions, some teasing, to break the monotony of their routine. Ki Sing, with his clear intentions, faced laughter from the miners, whom he saw as outsiders to his culture. Despite the humor, no one noticed his mistake. Mr. O'Reilly, not highly educated, was not amused. Dewey, a man of reason, urged the group to release Ki Sing, highlighting the consequences of their actions.

Richard Dewey reached his limit when O'Reilly cruelly pulled Ki Sing's pigtail. Dewey, trained in self-defense, stood his ground against O'Reilly's bullying.

This talk made Dewey think deeply. He was self-reliant but not foolishly so. He didn't want to harm his new friend out of stubbornness.

Richard sat up and scanned the miner's camp. The tents were close, and tired men's deep breaths filled the night. Unusually quiet due to a lack of whiskey, they awaited a new supply.
