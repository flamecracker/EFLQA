Mr. Beasley and a man are in a deal involving ivory, but their stash in the Kuroworo Mountains was stolen by a rival trader named Muley-Hassan. They know where it's hidden and plan to act when he least expects it. The time is right for a lucrative ivory deal due to market shortages. They risk losing big if they don't act fast. They have a map showing the stash's location, marked by mountains resembling an upturned face. The boys are intrigued but cautious. The old man suggests using an aeroplane to locate the ivory.

The Chester Boys found themselves in a tough spot with the ivory merchant they disliked. Despite their reservations, they decided to help Lathrop and his father. A month later, they anchored near Fort Assini on the Ivory Coast after leaving Sierra Leone. The town was a mix of wickerwork huts and a few scattered houses, surrounded by dense forests and hills. The boys, along with Ben, noticed the distinct African scent in the air. As they prepared to start their voyage up the Bia River, Kroomen launched boats through the surf. These skilled Kroomen surprised the boys by speaking English and showing expertise gained from sailing on trading ships. Amidst the commotion, the boys witnessed a daring recovery of stolen field glasses from the sea, showcasing the Kroomen's abilities.|"['1.

The man who had saved Frank's opera-glasses from a thief was overwhelmed with gratitude as Frank presented him with a sovereign. The adventurers, grateful for the man's help, had their baggage stowed on a lighter before landing on the flat, yellow beach facing European houses. The natives' skill in landing the surf boats was impressive, with one man steering and others paddling expertly. Monsieur Desplaines, the consular agent, promised to provide advice and arrange for native carriers and hunters for the boys' journey into the heart of Africa. After dinner at the Desplaines' house, M. Desplaines discussed their mission, focusing on hunting and exploration, including the use of airplanes. The boys were eager for the adventures that lay ahead in the wild Bambara country.|"['1.

It was an unusual sight. The boys and Ben were dressed in hunting attire, M. Desplaines was neatly groomed, and Madame Desplaines and her daughters wore white dresses. In the center stood the imposing ebony Krooman. Billy joked about the Krooman, mimicking his words, which made everyone laugh but also cast a somber mood. The next day, the group prepared for their expedition, packing supplies and sections of the Golden Eagle. Professor Ajax Wiseman, a naturalist, joined them, seeking transportation for his trip into the interior.

"""I have heard of him,"" the other replied with a slight hesitation, barely noticeable. Madame Desplaines called them for breakfast, ending any further discussion. The naturalist seemed deeply interested, even disturbed, by the topic. Frank briefly worried about the Professor joining their group, but quickly dismissed the concern. The Professor's reaction to the ivory trader's name might have been mere surprise. However, Frank decided to keep an eye on him. At breakfast, they discussed the mysterious Flying Men tribe with rudimentary wings. Professor Wiseman mentioned discovering a skeleton with bony frames resembling wings. The tribe was rumored to live in cave-like holes in a giant cliff, using rope ladders made of creepers to move around. The boys were excited about the upcoming adventure. Professor Wiseman hinted at the tribe's witch doctors divining events through special incantations. They later went fishing at the Jumbari Falls, a magnificent sight with roaring waterfalls and lush greenery."|"['1.

At first, the boys were alarmed, thinking an accident had occurred. However, upon seeing Professor Wiseman's reassuring laugh and watching him dive after M. Desplaines, they correctly deduced that the opening led to a hidden entrance at the foot of the falls. The boys descended a steep staircase carved into the cliff, reaching the edge of the swirling pool beneath the thundering falls. Guided by M. Desplaines, they boarded a canoe and drifted downstream while fishing. Unbeknownst to them, the current carried them far from their starting point into unfamiliar waters. Despite their efforts to paddle back, the narrow walls and strong current trapped them. As darkness enveloped them and the river rushed towards a deafening whirlpool, the boys realized they were in grave danger. Desperately paddling, they faced the terrifying prospect of being pulled into the churning waters.|['1. What did the boys initially think had happened when they first saw Professor Wiseman and M.

Before either boy could realize what had happened, they found themselves struggling in the water. Dazed by the mishap, it took them a few minutes to understand they were clinging to a huge tree trunk that wrecked their canoe. Although saved from one danger, they faced another as the trunk battered them in the narrow passage. Wet, bruised, and half-blinded, the boys clung side by side. Despite their despair, they held on with American pluck. A dark object caught their attention in the swirling water. As the current rushed around them, they noticed a hidden rock in the middle of the pool. With a glimmer of hope, they decided to focus on reaching that rock if they were swept away. Eventually, a wave washed Harry from the tree trunk, and he was carried down the stream, his mind set on survival.|"['1. What happened to the boys at the beginning of the passage?\nA.

Frank's persistence had made the boy remember the one chance of rescue in the dire situation. As Harry was carried downstream, he conserved his energy for the impending struggle. Despite feeling dizzy and exhausted, he clung to the hope of survival. Suddenly, he collided with a hard surface, but the slimy weed-covered stone offered no grip. Just as he was about to be swept away, he was rescued by Frank. Both boys found themselves on a rock in the water. The steep rock walls around them formed a triangular prison, with little hope of escape. A vulture circling above added to their unease.

One sunny morning on the West African coast, the boys prepared for a day of adventure. Ben Stubbs, a seasoned seaman, rescued Harry from a cliff, where he had fainted. The boys' African friend, Sikaso, had led the rescue party. After the rescue, preparations were made for a river journey. The Kroomen, who were camp attendants, loaded the canoes as the boys bid farewell to their hosts. The expedition was set to travel to the Bambara country, known for dangerous inhabitants. As they departed on a steam launch, Sikaso, a formidable warrior with a scarred axe, joined them.

The boat and its small group moved steadily up the river all day until nightfall when they reached a clearing with banana trees, hinting at a nearby village. Eager to explore, they disembarked, feeling the distance from home as they heard rhythmic drumming in the distance. Sikaso, their guide, led them towards the village, promising a chance to get food. As they approached, the tom-tom beats grew louder, quickening the boys' hearts. The sight of the African village with huts resembling beehives and bustling women and children fascinated them. The arrival caused a commotion, with the old drum player leaving and armed men approaching. Sikaso introduced the boys to the village leaders, leading to a tense moment when Billy was threatened by a spear-wielding young man after taking a photo.|"['1.

Billy had a close call when an arrow narrowly missed him, causing chaos in the village. Sikaso intervened, calming the situation and dismissing the superstitions.

Frank and Harry were at their camp, discussing the need to ask the Portuguese visitor, de Barros, to leave as their mission was private. They were focused on a map leading to the Moon Mountains, holding vital information to save Mr. Beasley. However, de Barros overheard their conversation and demanded the map. Frank was ambushed by de Barros and his men but managed to resist giving up the map. A scuffle ensued, and just as de Barros was about to harm Frank, his men swiftly took him away in a canoe.

Diego, in his rush, left the map behind, but Frank knew the Portuguese didn't need it to help Muley-Hassan. To prevent Diego from reaching the cache first, Frank hurried to the canoes. The loss of the canoes left the boys stranded, but Frank's optimism lifted their spirits. He planned to take Ben Stubbs with him to search for the ivory cache, leaving the others to guard the camp. Billy expressed a desire to prove themselves capable. Stubbs happily joined the boys for the aerial quest, preparing the craft for the journey. At dawn, the group boarded the aircraft, heading northwest towards the cache. The Kroomen workers marveled at the plane, with Sikaso being the only one not astonished. The engine roared to life, scattering the workers, except for Sikaso, who stood firm.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Diego leave behind in his rush?\nA) The canoes\nB) The map\nC) The ivory cache\nD) The workers\nE) The aircraft', ""Question 2:\nWho knew that the Portuguese didn't need the map to help Muley-Hassan?\nA) Diego\nB) Frank\nC) Ben Stubbs\nD) Billy\nE) Sikaso"", ""Question 3:\nWhy did Frank hurry to the canoes?\nA) To search for the ivory cache\nB) To help Muley-Hassan\nC) To prevent Diego from reaching the cache first\nD) To guard the camp\nE) To lift the workers' spirits"", 'Question 4:\nHow did the loss of the canoes affect the boys?\nA) It left them stranded\nB) It lifted their spirits\nC) It helped them reach the cache\nD) It made them search for the map\nE) It made them guard the camp', 'Question 5:\nWho joined Frank to search for the ivory cache?\nA) Diego\nB) Billy\nC) Ben Stubbs\nD) Sikaso\nE) Muley-Hassan', 'Question 6:\nWho was the only worker not astonished by the plane?\nA) Diego\nB) Frank\nC) Ben Stubbs\nD) Billy\nE) Sikaso']"|['B) The map', 'B) Frank', 'C) To prevent Diego from reaching the cache first', 'A) It left them stranded', 'C) Ben Stubbs', 'E) Sikaso']
The powerful propellers started spinning, creating a loud buzzing noise like a swarm of giant locusts in flight. The massive airplane then gracefully ascended in a long, elegant arc. Half an hour later, it appeared as a tiny speck in the sky to those watching from the camp. Frank, focused on the compass, guided the plane towards the Moon Mountains, a rugged mass of blue and brown in the distance. The mountains looked menacing with their jagged outlines cutting the sky like the teeth of a giant saw. In a clearing below, four huge African elephants were playing a rough game. Suddenly, one elephant turned aggressive, attacking another. The boys, observing from above, intervened by casting the plane's shadow over the clearing, startling the animals. A rifle shot from Harry stopped the aggressive elephant, saving the others. The boys landed the plane in the clearing, surrounded by dense jungle. They quickly retrieved the tusks of the fallen elephant before a group of tribal warriors emerged, resembling massive gorillas with eerie decorations and menacing weapons.|['1.

"Their weight kept her grounded as she raced across the terrain; meanwhile, the local tribesmen unleashed a storm of arrows and spears at her. Luckily, none hit the boys, although Frank sensed an arrow zip through his shirt sleeve. In a flash, Harry grasped the situation and leaped to the controls. Simultaneously, a savage, Harry's opponent, clambered into the airship's chassis. Just then, Ben Stubbs' revolver took down the last man clinging to the plane, and the Golden Eagle ascended. As the airship rose, the terrified savage in the chassis lunged at Ben with a knife. Ben dodged and disarmed him, causing the man to fall to his demise. The Golden Eagle soared triumphantly, while Frank's minor wound was tended to. As they approached the range, its ominous nature became more apparent, with deep abysses and scarce vegetation. The airship landed on a plateau beneath the ""Upturned Face,"" offering a serene campsite amidst the rugged surroundings. Amidst the rocky landscape, the oasis and its bubbling spring provided a refreshing contrast. The group transformed the Golden Eagle into a tent, shielded from ground hazards.

"The rest of the day was spent preparing for their expedition the next day. Their boots were equipped with ""hob-nails"" for the tough climb ahead. Each of the three carried a pick and ammunition in their cartridge-belts. After a supper cooked by Ben, Frank sent a wireless message to the camp for reassurance. The cool mountain air was a relief from the river's heat. Frank couldn't sleep, worried about reaching the ivory cache before Muley-Hassan's arrival. He studied the map, knowing the Arab would come well-armed. Suddenly, a chilling wail echoed through the mountains, startling Frank.

The strange cries ceased that night, leaving the boys awake till dawn, hoping for a recurrence. Despite their theories ranging from cannibals to ghosts, the mystery remained unsolved. They decided to trust chance for a solution and not dwell on the unsolvable. Frank sent a wireless to the river camp, finding all was well. The message worried him due to its irregularity. They began their climb up the mountain to the Upturned Face, carrying water and equipment. The ascent was tough, especially in the scorching sun.

"""No, they are those of negroes I believe,"" he replied after a careful examination, ""and I imagine that Muley-Hassan killed them after they erected the cache so that they would not be able to spread the knowledge of its whereabouts to any of the marauding tribes who might even brave the ghostly voice when such a great treasure of ivory tempted.""A shout from Ben, who had been walking round the pile examining it from every view-point interrupted them.

Lathrop, Billy, Barnes and old Sikaso had wandered into the jungle with their rifles, intent on bringing down some sort of game to replenish the camp larder. For hours they tramped about in the thick jungle and a fair measure of success had fallen to their rifles.

The seasoned fighter laughed, twirling his mighty axe in a dazzling display. He softly sang a war-song in a fierce voice, though the boys couldn't grasp the words, they sensed his prowess. A rhythmic paddle sound approached, signaling impending conflict. The tension of waiting for the battle to commence was palpable. Suddenly, an enemy scout emerged, followed swiftly by an onslaught.

Of the twenty-five men who had assaulted the adventurers' camp, ten were killed, and several others were badly injured. Muley-Hassan, enraged by their defeat against two American boys and a Krooman armed with only an axe, ordered the boys to be brought before him. In a fierce manner, the slave-dealer had a fire lit and confronted the boys with a menacing presence. Diego de Barros, standing by Muley-Hassan, displayed a sneer with yellow teeth, while the tall, determined man wore a white burnoose and had a dark, frowning face. The bodies of the fallen men lay outside the fire's glow. The professor was condemned to death, pleading for mercy as he was taken away and met his end with a chilling scream.

In the dim firelight, a man with jet-black mustaches twisted them thoughtfully, his face showing deep perplexity. It wasn't mercy that troubled him but a money-making idea. Billy and Lathrop, expecting the worst, found themselves captured and guarded. The next day, the camp bustled with activity, tending to the wounded and burying the dead. The boys, just hungry American boys, were fed and felt better. Diego, a scoundrel with some skill, helped care for the wounded. When Diego suspected one of the boys knew Morse code, Lathrop reluctantly admitted it. Threatened by Diego, Lathrop sent a message, hoping Diego didn't understand Morse code. As the camp was abandoned, Diego destroyed the field wireless. The savages, resembling the ones Frank, Harry, and Ben had encountered, followed the Arab into the forest.

"""Well, there's no use wasting time in speculation,"" said Frank. ""It does not look like we can solve the problem that way. The thing to do is to get the ivory quickly. If that man is the forerunner of an attacking band, we need to move fast."" With a swing, the prospector dislodged stones from the cairn. The boys joined in, and soon only a few rocks remained. Frank scanned the surroundings with binoculars but saw no rivals. Beneath a trap-door, they found a king's ransom in ivory. A snake startled Harry, but Frank shot it. They cautiously removed the ivory, finding a few more snakes. By mid-afternoon, they had a pile ready to transport. Ben stayed with the ivory as Harry and Frank rushed to their airship.

The boys witnessed a fierce battle with gorillas who attacked their aircraft. The leader of the gorillas hurled a massive stone at the plane but missed. The boys fought back with rifles and revolvers, eventually emptying their ammunition. They resorted to using hunting knives. When the gorilla leader tried to attack Frank, Ben shot him, causing the leader to scream in pain. The other gorillas, discouraged by their leader's fall, began to retreat. However, a cry from the distance startled the gorillas, causing them to flee up the mountain. The boys mercifully ended the suffering of the wounded gorillas.

The hose was attached to the cylinders, releasing gas into the yellow bag, causing it to swell. Rocks weighed it down, preventing it from rising.

The adventurers, carrying minimal supplies, took off with the wireless apparatus in tow. They landed near a muddy river, halted by Muley-Hassan.

As they sought refuge from the storm, Billy and Lathrop found a hidden cave in the rocks, shielded by vines. The thunder grew louder, signaling the approaching storm. Billy, resourceful as ever, quickly gathered wood for a fire while Lathrop followed suit.

The boys were amazed by this extraordinary community of Flying Men. They were escorted up a rope ladder to the main entrance of the rock dwellings. Inside, they found galleries and passages leading to separate homes. The valley below was fertile, with hedged vegetable patches and humped cattle. The Winged Men cultivated fruits and poultry. Despite their comfort, they were troubled by enemy raids. After a supper and a dream of New York, they were awakened by Umbashi, who informed them that the King of the Flying Men wanted to see them immediately."|"['1.

Without a doubt, Frank discovered cartridges used by Arab slave-traders, indicating that Billy and Lathrop had put up a fierce defense. The possibility of them being taken as slaves struck the group. The realization that they had left most of their fuel behind added to the distress. Harry found an Arab cloak, confirming their suspicions. Ben revealed that a tribe of cannibals was tracking the Arabs. Sikaso, exhausted but determined, rushed to warn the boys of Muley-Hassan's imminent arrival. With his uncanny instincts, he navigated the treacherous jungle to reach the boys in the Moon Mountains. The group braced for a potential showdown, unaware of the twists and turns fate had in store.|"[""1.

Billy and Lathrop felt a bit guilty for suspecting the old black man of abandoning them, but they were mistaken. The old warrior knew he could help them better if he stayed free rather than become a captive of Muley-Hassan. He saw the boys being captured and decided to help them. He lit a fire and saw the boys in their air-ship on a mountain. He set off to find them at a fast pace. The boys had left the mountain, but the warrior found the ivory they had hidden. He took most of it and cooked gorilla meat before heading back to the river. He saw Muley-Hassan and his men exhausted and furious at finding the ivory gone. Later, the boys were surprised by a man approaching their aeroplane, and they lowered their revolvers cautiously. Ben recognized the exhausted man first.|"['1.

The boys hurried to the fallen man's side upon hearing his name. They washed the large black's head with water, and after a short while, he opened his eyes and greeted them with a faint smile. Once he had some food, he fully recovered from his weakness, which he referred to as a spell. The boys stayed up late listening to the black's tale of the camp attack, Professor Wiseman's betrayal and demise, and the boys' abduction. Sikaso joyfully shared how he had hidden the remaining ivory and witnessed Muley-Hassan passing by the looted hiding spot. Meanwhile, Billy and Lathrop, after meeting the chief, settled comfortably in the village of the Flying Men. The next morning, they joined a hunting expedition led by their new friend and ventured into a forest after crossing fields and swamps. During their trek, Billy showcased his hunting prowess by taking down a charging boar, earning praise from his companions. The group proceeded cautiously through the forest, wary of a rogue elephant that had been causing havoc in the area.|"[""1.

Finally, the leader of the group signaled to stop, and they sat down to enjoy some cassava and manioc cakes they had brought along. They sipped a sour drink from a large earthen jar carried by a member of another tribe. Suddenly, a hunter sprang up, alerting everyone to a distant pounding sound, like a drumbeat. The group listened intently, realizing it was getting closer. Despite the danger, they had to press on, not showing fear. As they approached, they discovered a massive elephant performing a strange dance. The boys marveled at the sight until the elephant noticed them. Panic ensued as they scrambled up trees to safety. Billy's rifle mishap nearly led to disaster, but their friend Umbashi bravely saved him from the charging elephant. Billy felt a newfound respect for Umbashi's courage and quick thinking.|"['1.

After a few charges, the elephant grew tired of attacking and stood under the tree, shaking with anger, resembling a bull chasing a boy up an apple tree. It was clear that they needed to either kill the elephant or drive it away to avoid spending too much time in the trees. As the elephant climbed, it dropped its bag of cartridges, catching the attention of the tribesmen in the trees. One man bravely distracted the elephant by running in circles, tiring it out. The plan was to tire the elephant and then spear it to death. However, a man slipped and fell, facing certain death, until another brave man leaped onto the elephant's back, stabbing it in the head, ending its threat. Later, a mysterious religious ceremony involving a Caucasian man with red-robed figures holding knives unfolded, leaving the boys in shock.|"['Question 1: What did the man do to distract the elephant?\nA) Climbed a tree\nB) Ran in circles\nC) Threw stones\nD) Blew a whistle\nE) Lit a fire', 'Question 2: What was the plan to deal with the elephant?\nA) Feed it\nB) Sing to it\nC) Tire it out and spear it\nD) Offer it food\nE) Capture it alive', ""Question 3: How did the elephant's threat come to an end?\nA) It fell asleep\nB) It ran away\nC) It was shot by a gun\nD) It was speared to death\nE) It was captured alive"", ""Question 4: What did the man do when he slipped and faced certain death?\nA) Climbed higher\nB) Ran away\nC) Jumped onto the elephant's back\nD) Called for help\nE) Hid behind a tree"", 'Question 5: What unfolded after the elephant was killed?\nA) A parade\nB) A religious ceremony\nC) A celebration\nD) A funeral\nE) A feast', 'Question 6: Who were the figures holding knives in the religious ceremony?\nA) Children\nB) Women\nC) Men\nD) Animals\nE) Ghosts']"|"['B) Ran in circles', 'C) Tire it out and spear it', 'D) It was speared to death', ""C) Jumped onto the elephant's back"", 'B) A religious ceremony', 'C) Men']"
As the sun dipped below the horizon, a chilling ritual unfolded before the boys. The red-robed men were about to sacrifice an old white man on an altar. Just as the knives were poised to strike, a brave interruption occurred. Billy, with a rifle in hand, stood ready to protect the old man. The setting sun brought a sudden end to the ceremony, saving the victim's life for the time being. The boys, overwhelmed by the winged men, were imprisoned in a dark cell. In the darkness, they met an aged explorer who had been captured by the winged men in 1870. He shared tales of his life and predictions about the tribe's demise. Grateful for their rescue, he thanked the boys and shared stories of his past, bringing a glimmer of hope in the midst of uncertainty.|"[""1.

They didn't have to wait long. The voice that had signaled them whispered through an unknown opening, warning them of poisoned food and instructing them to be ready to fight back. When the man arrived with food, they resisted eating and instead planned to overpower him. With a torch providing light, they pretended to be affected by the drug. As the man checked on them, the boys sprang into action, subduing him quietly. They escaped their cell and were met by Umbashi and Aga, who had come to collect the promised fetishes.

The scene was like a river where Frank and Harry almost drowned. The details became clearer, like a magic lantern view. A white-bearded man looked about to collapse. Billy spoke to him as they paddled. Their torn clothes barely covered their cuts. Mosquitoes buzzed around, adding to their misery. The canoe rushed forward in a turbulent current. The fear on their faces was palpable as they faced the danger ahead. The old man seemed ready to give up, but Lathrop stopped him. The tunnel of rough stone threatened to engulf them, but Billy's quick actions saved them. As they emerged into a lagoon, hippos charged at them. The canoe was tossed, and they found themselves struggling in the water. A crocodile appeared, engaging in a fierce battle with a hippo.

Frank watched as his two friends surveyed the dense jungle around them with despair. Lost in the African wilderness, hope was fading from their hearts.

As dawn broke, they hastily ate and packed supplies for the castaways. Boarding the Golden Eagle II, they flew at sixty miles an hour towards the river. The dying explorer, Mr. Desmond, found peace in his final moments. Landing at the river bank, the adventurers reunited, sharing stories and mourning Mr. Desmond's passing.

The valuable ivory collection was carelessly thrown into the launch by the paid workers of Barr.

When the boys saw through his deception, Barr used chloroform to incapacitate them, allowing his men to load the ivory quickly. As they transferred the ivory to the Brigand, Barr anxiously scanned the surroundings, anticipating the Golden Eagle II's pursuit. The crew, hired from New York, reluctantly worked to get the anchor up. Barr, eager to escape, ordered full speed ahead. However, as they set off, Barr noticed the Golden Eagle II approaching. Realizing the danger of running aground, he decided to proceed cautiously at a slower pace to avoid disaster.|"['1.
