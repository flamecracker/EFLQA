The scene at the port was chaotic with thousands of soldiers unsure of what to do or which transport to board. Theodore Roosevelt heard the confusion and decided the first command to board a transport would prevail. He immediately ordered his men to double-quick to the dock. Rushing to the wharf, they boarded a transport just in time. Roosevelt demonstrated the importance of attending to soldiers' needs beyond the battlefield. Despite challenges like bad food and lack of salt, the troops maintained good spirits with nicknames and entertainment.

The weather was scorching hot, and some were already suffering from fever or its symptoms. Thankfully, bathing was refreshing, and many went in once or twice a day. Bathing in the ocean was a thrilling experience for some plainsmen who had never seen anything larger than a river or creek. They played around like children, organizing races with prizes for the best swimmers. Finally, the transports received orders to sail for Cuba. There were thirty-two in total, including a schooner filled with drinking water. To protect the transports from potential attacks, they were escorted by five war-ships initially, later joined by fourteen more. In total, there were eight hundred officers and sixteen thousand enlisted men on board. The troops were to be landed on the southeast coast of Cuba near Santiago Bay to advance towards Santiago. The journey lasted seven days, with the ships moving in a broad column by day and clustering together at night. The men relaxed on deck during the voyage, chatting, sleeping, or playing games. As the transports approached Santiago Bay, they saw the American war-ships containing Admiral Cervera's fleet. The Rough Riders and other troops landed at Daiquiri, east of Santiago Harbor. The landing was secured by war-ships firing shots to clear any potential threats. Most soldiers disembarked at Daiquiri or a nearby landing. The soldiers were met by Cubans in need of food, showing no sign of enemy presence.|['1.

Individuals and nations alike benefit from a rich history. A nation's happiness is not in its lack of history but in its glorious past. It is better to strive for great achievements, even if faced with failure, than to live in mediocrity. In 1900, during the nomination of the President and Vice-President of the United States, the Republican Party was abuzz with speculation. President McKinley was highly regarded for his leadership during the war with Spain and his stance on crucial issues. The National Republican Convention in Philadelphia saw Governor Roosevelt as a prominent figure. Despite his popularity, Roosevelt remained loyal to McKinley and seconded his nomination with a powerful speech, emphasizing the importance of continuing on the path of national greatness and prosperity.

The intense campaign that followed was arduous for Theodore Roosevelt. President McKinley opted out of making many speeches, shifting the heavy workload to Roosevelt. In the brief period between his nomination and the election, Roosevelt traveled over 20,000 miles by rail, visiting nearly 600 towns and addressing around 3,000,000 people with 673 speeches. Despite encountering warm receptions in many towns and cities, there were instances of hostility. At a labor picnic in Chicago, Roosevelt and William Jennings Bryan set aside their differences to discuss labor dignity. However, there were disruptions, like a stone thrown at Roosevelt in Waverly, New York, and rowdyism in Victor, Colorado, due to differing views on silver mining.

The following day, a hunt took a somber turn as the dogs cornered a mother cougar with her three kittens. The hounds attacked, resulting in the loss of one kitten.
