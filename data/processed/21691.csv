Sir Alexander Mackenzie was a determined explorer in the vast wilderness of British America. He traveled alone with limited resources when discovery was rare. He explored the route recently taken by the Red River Expedition, which was just the start of his extensive travels. Mackenzie traced his namesake river to the Polar Sea and was the first to cross the Rocky Mountains and reach the Pacific Ocean. His journal, though valuable, may be too detailed for young readers. Reuben Guff, a Canadian pioneer, shared his passion for the wilderness with his son Lawrence. Reuben believed in following his calling to explore the wilderness and sought his son's help in navigating their next adventure. Lawrence, engrossed in eating, needed time to decide between joining his father or their skilled guide, Swiftarrow, on the upcoming exploration.|"[""1.

During the previous discussion, the Indian's face showed no emotion until Lawrence's name was mentioned, causing a hint of satisfaction in his eyes. Two days later, the three friends set off in their small canoe, paddling up the river towards Kakabeka Falls. Overcoming the falls by carrying the canoe past them, they continued their journey into the wilderness. Weeks or even months would pass before they reached their destination. One day, they buried their supplies and explored a new area for food. They noticed smoke rising above the trees and investigated cautiously. They found a tragic scene of Indian lodges with deceased inhabitants, victims of smallpox. The disease had spread rapidly, devastating families and tribes. Wolves had scavenged the bodies, adding to the horror. Some had chosen to end their lives to escape the disease's grasp.|"[""1.

Reuben opened the door to find a tragic scene - bodies of men, women, and children lay around a dying fire. An old woman, the lone survivor, believed it was punishment from the Great Spirit. Moved by compassion, they rescued her, providing food and shelter. Meanwhile, Lawrence, a skilled hunter, encountered a monstrous brown bear in the forest.

"Brown bears are mighty creatures. One traveler witnessed the tracks of a large bear that had seized a moose-deer in a river, dragging it a quarter of a mile along the sandy banks before devouring it, leaving only part of the hind-quarters. The moose must have been over a year old, weighing as much as an ox. Lawrence, a brave individual, covered the remains of an unfortunate Indian, his mother's son, with leaves and sticks. He skinned the bear, took its claws as trophies, and brought back some of the Indian's belongings. Reuben, his father, expressed pride in his son's courage. The Indian silently presented the Indian woman with the bloody garments. Reuben decided to take the old woman back to the settlements, feeling it was wrong to abandon her. They all agreed to return the next day. Reuben shared a motto with Lawrence, ""Never give in, 'xcept w'en yer wrong."" They fell asleep by the fire, ready to journey back the following day."|"[""1.

Indian brides are often stronger than those from civilized communities. They can handle tough canoe trips, paddle skillfully, and manage camp affairs efficiently. They even make and maintain moccasins, essential for hunting. The brown bride was a valuable addition to the party, accompanying them to Fort Chipewyan. Reuben hoped they weren't late, eager to reach their destination before Monsieur Mackenzie's departure. At the fort, a man pondered if a river connected to the Polar Sea, just like Reuben did earlier. This man, Alexander Mackenzie, envisioned exploring uncharted territories and adding wealth to the fur company. A Highlander with a fiery spirit, he excelled in the fur trade despite harsh conditions.

Mackenzie, a man of deep blue eyes that could express tenderness or passion, was preparing for an exploration. He organized canoes with Canadian and German companions, and the group included an Indian Chief and his wives. As they faced challenges like icy riverbanks and dangerous rapids, the team grew to include Reuben, Swiftarrow, and Darkeye. A dramatic rescue unfolded when a canoe capsized near a waterfall, and Lawrence Guff heroically saved Darkeye. The group navigated Slave River and reached Great Slave Lake, where the true exploration began.

During the first three weeks of the journey, the travelers faced challenges despite the efforts of skilled hunters Reuben, Swiftarrow, and Lawrence. Thunderstorms, heavy rains, and ice slowed them down, while mosquitoes made their journey uncomfortable. Although they sometimes struggled to find food, the hunters managed to bring in geese, beavers, ducks, fish, and berries. One evening, they encountered Red-knife Indians, led by English Chief, who was loyal to the Hudson Bay Company. The explorers received a warm welcome and shared gifts with the tribe. Mackenzie, the leader, announced plans to establish trade and explore new lands, seeking information about a river flowing into a great salt lake. The Red-knife Indians promised to return with more of their tribe for further discussions.|"['1.

"""We are pleased to hear from our white brother. It is heartening to know that you plan to establish a trading fort in our land, as we truly need one. Until now, we had to travel great distances with our furs. If we entrusted them to the Chipewyans, they often cheated us, giving us very little in return. This left us disheartened, with no motivation to hunt beavers beyond basic needs. We welcome your arrival as it brings us joy. Regarding the great river, we advise against venturing there. It is treacherous, with impassable falls and monstrous creatures. Bears eat trees, and evil spirits lurk, delighting in harming humans. Despite the warnings, Mackenzie remained resolute. Coppernose, a young guide, was initially hesitant due to fear of the river's dangers. However, with additional gifts, he agreed to lead the expedition. Before leaving, Coppernose performed a ceremonial farewell to his family. The group set off in three canoes, encountering challenges and hunting for food along the way."""|"['1.

Reuben, responding to his leader, mentioned the abundance of game but emphasized that they had enough for a feast. Mackenzie chuckled as Coppernose helped himself to half-roasted meat. Following suit, the men indulged in venison steaks, fish, and more. After supper, they relaxed, lit pipes, and engaged in lively conversations. As fatigue set in, each found a spot to rest under a tree. Time passed swiftly as they journeyed down the river, encountering dangers but evading the terrifying creatures described by the Copper Indians. One night, they spotted smoke rising above the trees, leading them to a beautiful area with woodlands destroyed by fire. Replenishing supplies, they set up camp, repaired canoes, and made pemmican from dried fish. Reuben's canoe returned with a bountiful harvest of deer, swans, ducks, and more. English Chief's playful antics caused a bit of concern when he ventured off to observe moulting swans, leaving the group momentarily anxious.|['1.

English Chief and his party were on a swan-hunting adventure. With a loud cry, they paddled swiftly to surprise the swans. Startled, the birds tried to flee, but in their panic, they could not fly properly. The swans ran towards the island, pursued by the hunters. The squaws and comrades scattered to chase the swans. English Chief targeted a large swan and chased it with determination. As the swan tried to escape, it almost got caught by a squaw. The chase led to a comical tangle between the hunters and the swans. Amidst the chaos, the elder squaw bravely subdued a swan with a swift blow.

The weather turned stormy as they journeyed, facing frequent thunderstorms and icy conditions in early July. The soil remained frozen beneath the surface, even during the hottest season. Despite the challenges, they pressed on, with Mackenzie urging them forward. The local natives were wary at first, but through kind gestures and gifts, a friendly relationship was established. Mackenzie's attempts to share tobacco and grog were met with reluctance, but trade items like knives and beads were warmly received. As they continued their exploration, the exaggerated tales of the river ahead from the natives created doubts among the group. Mackenzie's determination prevailed, convincing some to accompany him further, including a Dog-rib Indian named Bluenose, who joined the expedition with his distinctive blue cheek tattoos.|"['1.

The indigenous people, while skilled in alcohol and tobacco, were unkempt and impoverished compared to other tribes. Despite their lack of wealth, they displayed ingenuity through crafting tools from wood, bone, and other materials. Their weapons, resembling prehistoric artifacts, included barbed arrows and bone-tipped spears. They used primitive methods like striking pyrites and flint to create fire and boiling water in watertight baskets with hot stones. Mackenzie faced resistance from a guide named Bluenose, who hesitated to fulfill his duty until physically helped into a canoe. The journey continued through rugged terrain, encountering different tribes, like the Hare Indians who relied on hares and fish for sustenance.

During his short visits to the locals, our explorer faced challenges with theft among the natives and his own men. Some crew members struggled with understanding right from wrong regarding possessions. Additionally, his team often quarreled with each other, the weather, the journey, and fate. Through a balanced approach of firmness and kindness, he kept his diverse group united, showcasing his leadership skills. The river meandered through various channels bordered by tree-covered islands. The frozen riverbanks melted, causing trees to fall into the water. Despite difficulties in choosing the right channel, they continued northward. Finally, reaching the Polar Sea, the team encountered abandoned Eskimo camps, confirming their location. They found whalebone pieces, spilled train-oil, and sled runners, indicating the presence of the Eskimos.

They caught a fish, similar to a herring, unfamiliar to the group except the English Chief who recognized it as a type abundant in Hudson's Bay. They also saw a shoal of white whales, the main food of the Esquimaux, confirming their location. The navigation was challenging due to the Mackenzie River's multiple mouths forming a wide delta. Storms and fogs added to their difficulties. They decided to erect a post to claim the land for the King. The return journey was long and strenuous, with dangers from natives, rapids, and starvation. After 102 days, they reached Fort Chipewyan. Mackenzie, not content with this, planned a voyage over the Rocky Mountains into the west. Three years later, he prepared for a voyage of discovery with Reuben Guff and his son. They embarked on a journey towards the Rocky Mountains and beyond, aiming to build a fort and explore the unknown wilderness.|"['1.

In the past summer, Reuben and Lawrence, who were tough from hard work, had prepared timber, marked a fort's space, and dug a trench for palisades. Seventy natives awaited Chief Mackenzie eagerly, craving tobacco and rum, unlike those from the far north. Building a fort in frost so severe that axes turned brittle was a remarkable feat detailed in a volume. One woman with a swollen breast found relief through Mackenzie's common-sense treatment. Another Indian with a mysterious ailment was cured by a volatile liniment. A young Indian's maimed hand was healed with a poultice and salve. As winter passed, Rocky Mountain Indians shared vital river information. With spring's return, they readied a large birch-bark canoe for a crucial journey.|"['1.

Mackenzie embarked on an adventure with nine companions, Reuben, Lawrence, and Swiftarrow included, and two young Indian hunters as interpreters. The group journeyed through a breathtaking region, adorned with lush greenery and diverse wildlife. Elk and buffaloes roamed the plains, while birds filled the air with melodies. However, their paradise was interrupted by a destructive wildfire and encounters with Beaver Indians. Despite challenges, they pressed on, encountering a grizzly bear and the majestic Rocky Mountains. As they navigated treacherous waters, a near miss with a rockfall tested their mettle.

In an instant, the dog dashed into the herd, scattering the animals as it seized a young calf. Despite the calf's struggle, the hound held on firmly, allowing Ducette to approach and dispatch it. The hunters skillfully skinned and butchered the calf, adding veal to their supplies. Suddenly, gunshots rang out near their canoe, prompting them to investigate. They discovered the canoe at the foot of a challenging rapid. Mackenzie, undeterred by the obstacles, decided to cross the river despite the dangers. The men successfully navigated the river, facing various challenges along the way.

The brave pioneers faced numerous dangers as they navigated the treacherous river. Despite their coolness, courage, and skill, they narrowly escaped disaster multiple times. At one point, they had to traverse a strong current, with men ready to swim for their lives if needed. When the canoe nearly drifted away, one man's quick action saved them from losing their only means of transport. As they faced rapids and dangerous waves, the leader decided to abandon the river and carry the canoe overland. The men, determined to reach the Pacific Ocean, climbed steep hills with heavy loads to set up camp. Mackenzie and a group explored ahead, finding old Indian encampments and realizing they had to cross the mountain on foot. Despite the challenges, the team's perseverance and determination kept them moving forward.|"['1.

"At dawn, their chief gathered the men. ""Team,"" he said, ""the task ahead for the next few days will be tough, but quitting now would be a shame. We're close to the mountain peak, and once we cross it, it's downhill. Let's work hard. Grab your axes, cut through obstacles, fell trees for a path, but leave them standing partly. Lawrence, you're up first."" With a grin, Lawrence swung his axe, felling a tree. For three days, they cut a path from the riverbank, over the ridge, down into a hollow, and up the mountain, hauling baggage and canoe. It was exhausting, with risks and challenges. Finally, at the summit, Mackenzie led on. They cut through various terrains, facing bruises and cuts. Progress was slow.

Mackenzie and his team faced challenges during their expedition. Despite warnings and grumbling from his men, Mackenzie decided to follow the southern branch of the river. Along the way, they encountered beavers and a false alarm of shots fired by Indians. When Mackenzie left with Reuben and two Indians to climb a mountain, his men encountered trouble with the canoe. They fired signals for Mackenzie's return, but received no response. An elder Indian suggested constructing a raft to return, but Mackenzie insisted on finding his men. After a thorough search, signals were exchanged, and the missing party was located. The day ended with a storm, but Mackenzie was relieved to reunite with his team.|"['1.

As they journeyed to the head-waters of the river, they encountered suspicious natives who had been mistreated by other tribes. Despite initial hostility, gifts and assurances of friendship eased tensions. The natives shared tales of white people and a distant river with iron tools. Lawrence, a voyager, found their guide to explore new lands. Disaster struck as their canoe was damaged, but they persisted. Repairing the canoe, they navigated towards the Columbia River, meeting locals and preparing for a journey to the Pacific. Overcoming challenges, they built a new canoe, hid their old one, and set out on foot towards the western coast.

Starting the overland journey, they buried extra supplies and secured their canoe and excess provisions. Each man carried a load of 45 to 90 pounds along with weapons. Guided by a Native American and accompanied by their dog Wolf, they faced hardships. Faced with scarce food, they rationed to two meals of pemmican daily. Battling heat, insects, and unfriendly natives, they struggled. They were later joined by more natives who added to their troubles with capricious behavior. Facing a storm, they sought shelter under thin cloth and trees. Despite challenges, Mackenzie's calm leadership kept the group together.

"After enduring many days of hardships and challenges, the explorer Mackenzie and his companions finally reached an Indian village. Here, they were warmly welcomed and generously provided with roasted salmon, the staple food of the tribe, along with berries. The villagers were known for their cleanliness and peaceful ways, relying more on fishing and gathering than on hunting or warfare. Mackenzie and his party secured new guides and made peace offerings of beads, knives, and trinkets before continuing their journey.

As they pressed on, the group faced a night of discomfort by a lake, battling rain and swarms of sandflies and mosquitoes. The guides grew weary, leading to further ration cuts. To ensure provisions for the return journey, Reuben and his son were tasked with burying reserves of pemmican discreetly. Despite the challenges, they persevered, crossing mountains and encountering native tribes along the way.

Eventually, on July 20th, Mackenzie's determination paid off as they reached the Pacific Ocean. Although faced with obstacles, including a deserting guide, Mackenzie handled the situation with grace and kindness, resolving conflicts and forging ahead towards his ultimate goal of reaching the Pacific."|"['1.
