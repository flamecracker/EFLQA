The South has evolved significantly since 1860 and 1865. The idea of a New South has often been misunderstood. It's not a completely new civilization but a continuation of the Old South's development. The Civil War altered Southern society but didn't change its core. Reconstruction tried to reshape the South but failed to impose new beliefs. The economic growth was hampered during Reconstruction, and the South felt defeated due to economic limitations. The South struggled to rebuild its industrial system post-War. The white South fought for dominance within its region. Despite the talk of utilizing the South's natural resources, little was done to attract foreign investment. By 1880, efforts to boost the economy faced challenges.|"['1.

"One must be cautious not to generalize the South as a single unified region with a uniform population. Historians and writers often refer to ""Southern opinion"" and the ""Southern attitude"" as if they were homogenous, but this oversimplifies the diverse nature of the South. Defining the geographical boundaries of the South poses challenges, with some states like Delaware, Maryland, and West Virginia included while Missouri is excluded. The South encompasses a vast area with a variety of climates, soils, and people. Different regions within the South have distinct economic and social characteristics. Over time, the South has seen changes, with people adapting to new economic and social norms. The emergence of a more hopeful outlook led to the concept of the ""New South,"" popularized by figures like Henry W. Grady, reflecting a region evolving from its past."|"['1.

In the late 1800s, a significant shift was observed in the Southern United States, marking the emergence of what was termed the New South. While remnants of the Old South lingered in certain pockets, the overall sentiment was one of optimism and a forward-looking approach. This transition was characterized by a newfound belief in progress and a desire to actively participate in the nation's affairs. The book aims to delve into this evolving spirit, tracing its development and exploring its various expressions. By 1877, the era of Reconstruction had come to a close, with the withdrawal of federal troops signaling the end of an era. The primary focus for the white population in the South was to maintain their supremacy, especially in states where African Americans formed the majority. Achieving unity among the white populace was crucial, requiring a setting aside of personal differences and a concerted effort towards a common goal.|['1.

During the aftermath of the Civil War, former Confederate soldiers emerged as leaders in the South. The Reconstruction period brought about a shift in power, with Confederate soldiers gaining popularity and influence. The Federal soldiers left, making way for the Confederates to take charge. These ex-Confederates, who had fought against the scalawags and carpetbaggers, were revered for their struggles during Reconstruction. In many states, the organization of voters resembled military operations. The white South was consolidated under Democratic leadership, with military backgrounds becoming a prerequisite for political roles. The past military achievements of candidates held more weight than their qualifications. Despite efforts to unify the white South, some Republican strongholds persisted, notably in the Appalachian region. The mountain people, descendants of early settlers, maintained traditions and customs from Stuart England. Though isolated, they preserved their way of life, living off meager resources and lacking modern conveniences. These mountain communities, while cut off from the outside world, have retained a unique cultural identity.|['1.

During the Civil War and Reconstruction era, various groups in the South showed diverse reactions to the political landscape. The mountaineers, despite being influenced by nationalism, remained loyal to the Union, with over 100,000 enlisting in the Union armies. The Society of Friends, particularly in North Carolina, opposed the war and aligned with the Republican Party even after its conclusion. On the other hand, some individuals in the South, including former secessionists, turned to Republicanism for personal gain, seeking lucrative federal positions. Federal officials, particularly in the revenue service, wielded influence by controlling state organizations and garnering support from both white and black populations. Intimidation tactics, including threats and violence, were used to suppress black voters, ensuring Democratic victories in many areas. Despite challenges, the political landscape in the South post-Civil War was marked by complex allegiances and power struggles.|['1.

"Later, more sophisticated methods were used to influence elections. Candidates or political groups provided ballots, leading to the introduction of the ""tissue ballot."" Multiple tissue ballots could be easily slipped into the box simultaneously. By having a blindfolded official remove surplus ballots, differences in length or quality allowed for the unfair withdrawal of Republican votes. Separate boxes were used for various officials, with incorrect ballots being declared void. Shifting ballot boxes intentionally caused many illiterate African Americans to unknowingly discard their votes. In South Carolina, the ""eight box law"" made illiterate voting ineffective unless aided. Unfair practices like appointing illiterate Republicans as election officers and manipulating votes were common. Despite some fair elections, areas with a significant African American population often faced unfair practices. The issue of finance also arose as Southern states dealt with enormous debts post-Civil War."|"['1.

During the Reconstruction period, the Southern States faced a significant increase in debt, reaching nearly $140 million. While some of this debt was incurred for military purposes and subsequently repudiated, other debts were issued for various purposes such as building railroads, canals, or levees. However, many of these bonds were sold at a discount, with only a small portion of the funds being used for actual construction. The repudiation of these debts damaged the credit of the Southern States, leading to denunciation. The states justified their actions by claiming that the bonds issued by the carpetbag legislatures were often fraudulent and not beneficial to the state. The prompt payment of interest on reduced debts helped restore the South's credit. The governments that followed the Reconstruction period were marked by economy, low taxes, and minimal social legislation, leading to little scandal and honest governance.|['1.

During the late 19th century, a proposed education bill faced opposition in the South due to concerns about federal oversight and historical issues. The Blair Bill aimed to distribute national funds based on illiteracy rates but was ultimately shelved due to these objections. While some Southern representatives supported the bill, many feared it could lead to unwanted interference akin to the Freedmen's Bureau. Despite the opposition, influential figures like Dr. J.L.M. Curry advocated for the bill. In this era, Southern politicians often served long terms in the Senate, maintaining dignified and austere personas. The election of Cleveland in 1884 marked a resurgence of Southern influence in national politics, with key figures from the region assuming prominent roles. However, despite these advancements, tensions arose between Southern politicians and President Cleveland over differing views on governance and policy. The era also saw a shift in power dynamics as a new generation challenged the established order, leading to factional disputes and the rise of movements like the Farmers' Alliance.|"[""1.

In the late 1800s, Southern farmers faced financial challenges due to declining agricultural prices and increasing debts. To address their struggles, many farmers joined the Patrons of Husbandry, or the Grange. This organization, founded by Oliver Hudson Kelley, aimed to support farmers and improve their economic situation. By 1875, over 6400 local granges existed in seceding states, with a total membership exceeding 210,000. The Grange movement also spread to border states, totaling over 355,000 members. While the Southern Grangers did not heavily engage in politics, their unity demonstrated common interests among Western and Southern farmers. The Grange movement led to increased awareness of economic legislation as a potential solution to poverty, laying the groundwork for future farmer alliances and cooperative unions.|"[""1.

"In 1890, the Southern farmer faced economic challenges due to falling crop prices. The Alliance proposed the sub-treasury plan to help farmers by storing their products in government warehouses in exchange for greenbacks. However, many farmers felt oppressed and blamed the ""money-power"" and Wall Street for their struggles. Southern delegates joined the People's party to fight for change, while others opted to work within the Democratic party. The bitterness towards town residents and old political leaders grew as the farmers believed they were being exploited. Despite efforts like the sub-treasury plan, some leaders like Senator John B. Gordon resisted change, leading to tensions within the political landscape. The struggle for economic justice continued as farmers like Reuben F. Kolb fought for fair representation in government."|"['1.

In the Southern States, a small group controlled Democratic councils, deciding on officeholders and policies, mainly focusing on white supremacy. The governments were honest but lacked progressive legislation due to leaders limiting government functions. However, a revolt emerged, led by farmers demanding change. Benjamin R. Tillman, a farmer's advocate, won the governor nomination in 1890, sparking a class struggle. He promised reforms and won the election against opposition. Re-elected later, Tillman's influence grew, causing a significant shift in South Carolina politics. His election marked a revolution, replacing old regime representatives with advocates for change like Tillman, showcasing a shift in power and ideology.|"['1.

The reformers aimed to diminish the power of the ruling class by implementing strict regulations. They established a state-controlled liquor system inspired by the Gothenburg model, limiting sales and consumption on-site. Despite hopes of reducing taxes through revenue, scandals plagued the purchasing process. Successful legislation included founding an agricultural college at Clemson and a girls' industrial school. The Alliance members diverged from the Democratic party, with Populist candidates emerging in most Southern states. The rise of the Populist movement threatened Democratic dominance, leading to political maneuvering and alliances with Republicans. The doctrine of free silver gained traction, culminating in Bryan's nomination at the national convention. Fusion tickets and strategic voting characterized the political landscape, with North Carolina exemplifying the complex interplay of party dynamics.|"['1.

North Carolina's experience with fusion government in the late 19th century had lasting effects on the state's political landscape. The fusion of Republicans and Populists led to changes in county government, allowing black politicians to rise to office. This shift caused lawlessness and violence in some areas. In response, white residents of Wilmington forcibly took over the city government. The Democratic Party regained control in 1898 and sought to disenfranchise black voters through an amendment. While the Populist movement waned, its influence on public education and political intolerance persisted. The movement also challenged the dominance of established political figures, leading to the rise of new leaders who better represented the common man. The South's resistance to federal interference in elections and the emergence of the Populist party further reshaped the political landscape.|"['1.

"In 1890, Mississippi introduced a new constitution that made it harder for people to vote. To vote, a person had to live in the state for two years and in the district for one year. Men aged twenty-one to sixty had to pay a poll tax of two dollars, which could be increased to three dollars. This tax had to be paid by February 1st of the election year along with all other taxes from the past two years. These rules made it difficult for African Americans to vote because many moved frequently, and the tax had to be paid far in advance. The constitution also required voters to read and understand a section of the constitution or provide a reasonable interpretation. These strict rules disproportionately affected African Americans, leading to a significant decrease in their votes. In 1895, South Carolina implemented similar suffrage amendments, further limiting voting rights. Louisiana went even further in 1898 with a ""grandfather clause,"" which allowed illiterate whites to vote if their grandfathers had voted before 1867. This clause effectively disenfranchised illiterate African Americans. North Carolina followed suit in 1900 with a simpler suffrage article, but it still included provisions to prevent illiterate white voters from being disenfranchised."|"['1.

"The ""grandfather clause"" was a cleverly designed law that aimed to disenfranchise a large number of African American voters while allowing white voters to retain their rights. In North Carolina, free African Americans could vote until 1835, and any African American who could prove descent from a former African American voter was exempt from illiteracy tests. Similarly, in 1867, African Americans or their descendants were exempt from educational requirements in some states. The extension of registration time until 1908 further prevented significant disenfranchisement of white voters. Alabama adopted a similar plan in 1901, combining various requirements like residence, poll taxes, and literacy tests. Oklahoma also attempted to disenfranchise illiterate African Americans permanently while allowing illiterate white voters to continue voting. However, this amendment was later declared unconstitutional. These disenfranchisement laws have effectively reduced the African American vote, leading to elections being decided by white voters. Despite attempts to segregate public spaces and limit funding for African American schools, there have been signs of a growing Republican opposition in North Carolina."|"['1.

"After Reconstruction, the Southern states faced the issue of the liquor trade, particularly in rural areas and among African Americans. Laws were passed to ban liquor sales near churches and schools, making much of the South ""dry."" Local laws extended this prohibition, and some states enforced statewide bans outside of towns. By focusing on towns, many became dry, but illicit sales persisted. Statewide prohibition started in 1907, with Oklahoma and Georgia leading the way. Despite successes, the ban led some to turn to drugs like cocaine, causing new problems. The South shifted from opposing such laws to embracing them, with prohibition gaining popularity. While effective in reducing alcohol consumption, moonshining increased. The tenant system and crop lien were common, with landless whites and black tenants relying on country merchants for supplies and credit."|"['1.

In the past, merchants in the South extended credit to farmers for goods like bacon, meal, and molasses. The merchant didn't charge interest but set advanced prices for these items. Farmers could mortgage their crops, tools, and even land to secure credit. This system often led to high interest rates, sometimes up to 100% annually. Farmers who couldn't pay faced serious consequences, like losing their property. The merchant's influence even extended to what crops farmers planted, favoring tobacco and cotton due to their market value. However, this system often left farmers in debt and at risk of losing everything. Despite the high profits involved, many merchants struggled with bad debts and bankruptcy due to factors like crop failure, dishonesty, or unforeseen events.|"['1.

In the Southern regions, the relationship between tenants and landlords has seen various changes since 1865. Different landholding systems were tested, but most have faded away. Currently, two common arrangements exist for renting land. One involves paying a fixed amount per acre or a set quantity of produce after the harvest. The other prevalent method is share tenancy, where both the tenant and landowner share risks and profits. Share tenancy can take different forms, like dividing the crop into thirds for land, resources, and labor. This system has evolved to give labor a more significant share of the crop, especially in cotton-growing areas. Landowners often provide housing, tools, and seed, while both parties split costs and profits equally. This setup essentially forms a partnership between the laborer and the capitalist, where success relies on the worker's diligence and trustworthiness.|"['1.

In some rural areas where the majority of the population is white and land is divided into smaller plots, a common practice involves white farmers who own more land than they can cultivate, setting aside a portion for a tenant, whether white or black, to work alongside them. These tenants may work for the landlord and sometimes even receive pay in kind or cash. Relationships between these families often grow close, and tenants may stay on the property for extended periods. Some tenants eventually purchase the land they work on or nearby land. Landlords, who may also be merchants, provide supplies to tenants, often giving credit at the beginning of the year. Tenants are encouraged to spread out their purchases throughout the year to avoid running out of credit before the crop is harvested. While these tenant-landlord relationships vary, most tenants rely on credit to sustain themselves until the harvest, highlighting the challenges faced by laborers in rural areas.|"['1.

In the South in 1910, there were 866,000 white tenant farmers cultivating 20.5% of the land. Despite farming larger plots than African American tenants, many struggle financially, often in debt and moving frequently. Illiteracy among white farmers contributes to their poverty, along with moral and physical issues. The Rockefeller Foundation is combating the hookworm parasite, a major health concern affecting rural populations. The Foundation invests in eradicating the disease, which impacts digestion and vitality. While white landowners till their land better, some are burdened with debt. Agricultural colleges and experiment stations offer advice, now more accessible to farmers. County demonstrators and youth clubs, like boys' corn and girls' canning clubs, improve agricultural practices. Dr. Seaman A. Knapp's work with the Department of Agriculture led to significant advancements in agricultural education, emphasizing economic improvement for educational development in the South.|"['1.

In 1908, Dr. Knapp initiated the boys' corn club, aiming to establish a club in every neighborhood. Boys were to cultivate a measured acre of land in corn, following specific directions and keeping a strict account of costs. The boys were responsible for most of the cultivation work themselves. The crop yield was measured by impartial witnesses, and successful boys were rewarded with a trip to Washington to meet government officials. This idea sparked the interest of thousands of boys, with many achieving remarkable results, surpassing state averages by significant margins. The success of the boys' corn clubs led to the creation of pig clubs, promoting good stock care. Following this success, girls' canning clubs were organized in 1910, encouraging girls to preserve various fruits and vegetables. These clubs not only generated monetary gains but also enhanced social interaction and dietary variety in homes. The club concept was later extended to poultry clubs, reaching beyond the South and gaining support from Congress.|"[""1.

In the Southern region, efforts have been made to enhance agricultural practices through farm demonstrations, experiment stations, and clubs for youth. Despite these initiatives, the traditional farming mindset remains prevalent, leading to underutilized land and poor soil management. Valuable nutrients are lost due to inadequate farming practices, and essential crops like legumes are neglected. The region heavily relies on external sources for products that could be easily produced locally, leading to a significant outflow of money. However, there are signs of progress with the adoption of modern technologies like tractors, better road infrastructure, and improved access to resources. While challenges persist, there is a growing number of forward-thinking farm households embracing new methods and diversifying their agricultural output, indicating a positive shift towards sustainable farming practices in the South.|"['1.

Since 1910, farmers have seen a rise in the prices of their products, leading to increased prosperity for those who farm with knowledge and method. Taking advantage of the Federal Farm Loan Act, farmers are paying off mortgages and reducing the need for credit. This has enabled many to purchase land and pay for it from the first crop. While the cost of goods farmers need to buy has increased, the value of their products has risen even more. In regions suitable for mixed farming in the South, expenses are relatively low. The Southern farmer's outlook is improving, with a revival of industrial development in some areas. Prior to 1810, North Carolina's textile production exceeded that of Massachusetts. Local manufacturing of clothing, furniture, and other goods was common in the Old South. The South's reliance on other regions for supplies began to shift, and interest in Southern industries declined. Cotton mills emerged in the early 19th century, with small establishments meeting local demand.|['1.

During the Civil War, the mills in the South were heavily used, but after the war, many were worn out or destroyed. By 1870, fewer mills were operating. However, in the following years, hope for industrial success returned. Some mills were making money due to high cotton prices, prompting industry revival. Old mills expanded, and new ones were built, doubling the number of spindles by 1880. The Cotton Expositions in Atlanta and New Orleans boosted mill construction. Despite challenges like buying outdated machinery and training farm workers for mill jobs, progress continued. Southern managers proved capable, and the South embraced industrial growth. By 1890, the South had almost two million spindles, a significant increase showing the success of the industry.|['1.

In the past, Northern textile manufacturers were surprised to find that Southern mills were competing successfully with them, especially in coarse yarns. Some industry representatives from the North even predicted that Southern mills would soon dominate the market. To counter this, some New England mills established branches in the South, while others shifted focus to finer yarns. Allegations were made by Southerners that New England manufacturers funded labor organizers to unionize Southern mill workers unsuccessfully. There were also claims that propaganda for labor legislation in Southern mills was supported by New England manufacturers. The installment payment system allowed the construction of many mills that might not have been possible otherwise. These mills, often owned by many shareholders, were profitable, leading to early dividends. Northern capital was invested in Southern mills managed by locals. The Southern mills have grown in number, but are generally smaller than those in the North, consuming more cotton due to their production of coarser yarn.|['1.

In the past, Southern mills reaped high profits and expanded their facilities using their earnings. Initially, they had several advantages that have persisted over time. Cotton was cheaper when sourced locally, reducing freight costs. Land, buildings, and labor were more affordable compared to the North. Fuel was cheaper, and water power was commonly used. Taxes were lower, and wages were less. However, with industry growth, some advantages have faded. Mills no longer solely rely on local cotton, facing higher transportation costs. Wages have risen, and fuel costs increased. Despite this, Southern mills remain profitable due to lower taxes and building costs. The mills are mainly in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. North Carolina leads in mills and cotton consumption. Southern mills are also expanding in the knitting industry.

The production of fertilizer heavily relies on cottonseed meal, with over a hundred oil mills having fertilizer divisions. Southern Atlantic States boast significant phosphate deposits, making the fertilizer industry increasingly regional. Georgia leads the pack, followed by Maryland, with no Northern State ranking higher than seventh. Lumbering surpasses fertilizers in value, with Louisiana as the second most valuable State, followed by Arkansas, Mississippi, and North Carolina. The South contributes nearly half of the nation's lumber. While the iron industry is important in Alabama, Virginia, Tennessee, and West Virginia also produce notable amounts of pig iron. West Virginia and Oklahoma lead in overall mine product values, with Alabama, Kentucky, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Florida, and Louisiana following suit. North Carolina's mineral production, apart from mica, is not significant, but it houses large aluminum works and abundant precious stones.

Years ago, scattered across the South, many small grist mills ground farmers' wheat or corn in the traditional way with stones. These mills are now being replaced by larger roller mills that handle local wheat and even import some from the West. The South's wheat production has actually decreased since 1880, shifting the industry's focus rather than growing in importance. The South has about 250 industries, with Maryland ranking fourteenth in manufacturing value in 1914. The South's manufacturing output is rapidly increasing, but other regions are growing too. Most workers in Southern factories are native-born, with whites handling complex machines and both white and black workers managing simpler tasks. The textile industry employs the most workers, drawing them from farming communities seeking companionship and better wages. Agriculture was unprofitable for many farmers in the late 1800s due to low crop prices, leading some to find work in mills for better pay and social opportunities.|"['1.

During the early days of the industrial expansion in the South, families who sought to escape loneliness or improve their economic situation joined those who were incapable, shiftless, disabled, or widowed. Some men even exploited their children's labor for personal gain. The cotton mills provided work for the youth, but older individuals, accustomed to farm labor, found it challenging to learn new skills past forty. The low wages initially offered in Southern mills, though lower than in New England, were enough to attract workers from farms. These workers could return to farming if needed, as land was plentiful. Despite low wages, living costs were also low, with affordable rents and basic necessities. As the industry grew and demand for labor increased, wages rose to approach New England levels. Skilled workers were needed, especially for specialized tasks like operating mules for spinning yarn. Southern wages, while increasing, may still differ from New England due to varying skill levels and machinery efficiency.|['1.

In the early days of mills, there were no rules on work hours, age, or who could work. Some mills had long hours, up to seventy-five a week, and paid workers in store credit. Living conditions were sometimes poor, especially since many workers were from rural areas. Over time, as more mills were built, living conditions improved, wages increased, and hours were reduced. Children were still employed, often due to pressure from parents. The use of child labor was a contentious issue, with some arguing for stricter laws. Public sentiment against child labor grew slowly, led by labor unions and activists. The South, where many mills were located, was slower to change due to differing attitudes and economic factors. The ownership of mills was often shared among many individuals, reducing wealth disparities and lessening public outcry.|['1.

The primary reason for the lack of progress in labor issues in the South is the historical focus on agriculture, which still influences the region. The industrial philosophy is underdeveloped, and there is a lingering individualistic approach rooted in agriculture. Attempts to regulate agricultural labor seemed impractical due to the difference between farm work and industrial labor. The transition from farm to mill work was initially challenging, with children preferring work over school. Reformers faced difficulties in addressing unrestricted child labor. Over time, restrictions on age, hours, and night work were imposed, gradually improving conditions. Some mills took on a paternalistic role, providing social amenities, while others made minimal contributions to the community. Recently, larger mills have invested in improving worker conditions, offering recreational facilities, educational programs, and health services. Domestic science instruction is crucial to address poor dietary habits among workers.|['1.

Years ago, the mill workers were known for spending their wages recklessly, often not saving or beautifying their surroundings. Factory villages were dull and unattractive. However, over the past twenty-five years, the cotton industry in the South has seen significant changes. Many families now save money, some buying homes or starting small businesses. Efforts to enhance community spirit have led to more appealing mill villages with landscaped grounds. While some families have moved from mill villages to farms, many remain. A sense of class consciousness is emerging, with workers showing opposition to dominant political parties. The furniture industry employs mostly men, with higher wages and education levels compared to cotton mills. Lumber mills, ranging from small sawmills to large operations, have faced labor issues, including peonage trials in the early 1900s. Despite improvements, the lumber industry still grapples with casual and migratory labor practices.|['1.

The tobacco industry, like the lumber industry, has a variety of labor conditions. Small factories with minimal machinery make plug and smoking tobacco, while larger ones span city blocks. In smaller factories, most workers are black, while larger ones employ both black and white workers. Some do similar tasks side by side, while others segregate by race. White workers usually handle complex machines, while white girls fill containers and inspect. Wages are paid by the day in smaller factories and on a piecework basis in larger ones. Workers in smaller factories see work as a summer holiday, chatting and singing, but this social aspect diminishes with machinery. Despite a diverse workforce, solidarity is lacking, making strikes rare. Negro tobacco workers are content with their pay. Though negroes struggle with regularity, they have shown potential in textiles. The South's labor force, including whites and blacks, lacks strong organization.|['1.

In 1918 and 1919, efforts to organize Southern labor in textile and woodworking industries saw success, causing disruptions in the tobacco and public utility sectors. Employers' resistance to unions led to lockouts and strikes, resulting in disorder and violence. Communities unfamiliar with such conflicts were shocked. Workers gained the right to organize, possibly indicating future industrial tensions. The presence of African Americans in the U.S. has historically divided the nation, with unresolved social status issues. Opinions vary widely, from viewing African Americans as oppressed individuals to being fundamentally different from whites. Predictions about their progress have often been inaccurate, with the African American population growing more slowly than the white population.

Between 1900 and 1910, the white population grew by 20.9%, while the black population only increased by 11.2%. The slower growth of the black population was due to migration to cities, where the death rate among city-dwelling black people, especially in the North, exceeded the birth rate. Since 1910, more black people have migrated to the North, particularly for better-paying jobs and improved educational opportunities for their children. Some also sought to escape racial discrimination and violence in the South. However, not all who moved North stayed due to higher living costs and harsh climates. Most black people in the South are still rural, engaged in agriculture, general labor, or domestic work. Despite owning some land and homes, their overall property ownership and wealth remain relatively low compared to the total population.|['1.

In the South, the right of African Americans to work in manual or mechanical jobs is generally accepted. They work alongside white people on farms and can rent land freely. In towns, you can find African American plumbers, carpenters, and masons working with white men. African American shoemakers and blacksmiths can have their own shops or share with white colleagues. Teamsters, firemen, and engineers include African Americans. They work in tobacco factories and other professions. The only restriction is that African American men cannot work indoors alongside white women, except in certain roles like porters or waiters. Economic challenges faced by African Americans are often due to issues like reliability and regularity rather than racial discrimination. Some professions where African Americans were once predominant, like barbers and waiters, now have more white workers. However, professions like seamstresses are seeing more African American representation. African American professionals like lawyers and doctors generally do not receive white patronage.|['1.

In 1865, most African Americans were unable to read or write. Only a few free African Americans had received education, with some even graduating from Northern colleges. Laws prohibiting the education of slaves were not strictly enforced, leading to a high illiteracy rate of around 90 to 95 percent. By 1910, the illiteracy rate among African Americans over ten years old had dropped to 30.4 percent, with some attaining college degrees. This rate was much higher compared to the 3 percent illiteracy rate among native white Americans. The lack of proper educational facilities in rural areas contributed to the high illiteracy rates among African Americans. As older generations pass away, the overall illiteracy rate is expected to decrease. Despite these challenges, the issue of illiteracy among African Americans is not solely their responsibility. Discrimination has also played a role in limiting opportunities for African Americans, both in the South and the North.|['1.

"In the South, there are strict rules separating black and white people enforced by the white population, who believe in their superiority. Laws prevent intermarriage and mandate separate schools, restaurants, and hotels. Public transportation segregates passengers by race, often providing inferior services to black individuals. Even in streetcars and railway stations, seating is divided by race. The justification for these regulations is to reduce tensions between races. The white community sees these rules as a defense mechanism against discomfort and a way to maintain their perceived superiority. Despite the regulations, there are instances of kindness and support from white individuals towards black people, as long as the latter remain in a subservient role. The South distinguishes between the ""old-time negro"" who is compliant and the ""new negro"" who challenges racial discrimination.

In the Southern states, there is a noticeable shift towards taking better care of the African American community. Towns are improving the neglected areas where African Americans live by cleaning the streets more often, constructing better sidewalks, and providing better lighting. Sanitation officers are paying more attention to these areas. Landowners are investing in better housing for tenants and encouraging them to grow gardens and raise animals. There is an increase in fair treatment of African Americans in legal matters, with juries leaning towards favoring them in cases of doubt. Many institutions are actively working to address the challenges faced by African Americans, including universities organizing Sunday schools and providing educational opportunities. The community is coming together to improve living conditions, with efforts to educate on hygiene and sanitation, and promote racial harmony through various initiatives like Red Cross work and collaborative patriotic efforts. This growing sense of responsibility among the white population is reducing racial tensions and fostering better relations.|['1.

The violent mobs in the South, which have stained its reputation with lawlessness and cruelty, do not reflect the region's best qualities. These mobs, often associated with lynching, are mainly composed of the least respectable members of the white community, not the upstanding citizens. While there may have been a time when lynching was seen as a form of justice, it is no longer the case. Despite some lingering beliefs and fears, there are efforts to oppose mob violence and hold perpetrators accountable. The idea that lynching is a justified response to heinous crimes like rape is outdated and inaccurate. It is crucial to uphold the rule of law and ensure fair treatment for all individuals, regardless of the circumstances. The South is gradually moving towards a more just and lawful society, where violence and lawlessness are not tolerated.|"[""1.

Statistics on lynching vary. Tuskegee Institute reported 38 cases in 1917 and 62 in 1918, while the NAACP documented 67 cases in 1918 and 325 over five years, with Georgia leading in incidents. Lynchings often occur where white and black populations are nearly equal. Solutions to racial tensions are challenging, with proposals like deportation or expulsion impractical. Education and wealth may be key to integrating African Americans into society. Prejudices persist in the US and globally. The movement of African Americans to other regions may not solve the issue. Reconstruction governments established public schools in the South, though their quality was debated. Southern schools initially began as charity institutions, with concerns about the quality of education provided.|['1.

In North Carolina, by 1840, the literary fund had grown to nearly $2,250,000, leading to the launch of public schools in 1839. Each district that raised $20 through local taxes received twice that from the fund. Progress under Calvin H. Wiley as state education superintendent in 1852 saw over 3000 schools by 1860, with a $279,000 expenditure. Illiteracy dropped, and with ten more years, it could have been further reduced. Despite the Civil War, the school fund stayed intact, but some was lost due to bank failures, and the rest misused by the Reconstruction government. Superintendent Wiley persevered until removed in 1865. Schools were better in 1860 than in 1880. Reconstruction set up schools in seceding States, but mismanagement, theft, and misallocation hindered progress. White children were sometimes excluded or faced biased teachings. Post-war, Northern teachers faced challenges in understanding and educating freed slaves.|"['1.

During the period of Reconstruction in the South, efforts were made to bridge the gap between the black and white populations. Teachers, assuming the equality of all races, sought to educate African American students and integrate them into white culture. Despite initial resistance from some teachers, many formed close relationships with their students. However, after Reconstruction, the Southern whites aimed to cut expenses, leading to reduced school funding. This resulted in inadequate educational systems for both white and black children. Basic country schools lacked proper facilities and resources, yet some students managed to learn and seek further education in academies. These academies, though lacking in resources, attracted adult learners seeking to improve their education. Despite the challenges, these early schools laid the foundation for education in the South, fostering a serious and dedicated approach to learning.|['1.

Before 1890, many towns started graded schools using special taxes, but rural education faced challenges. Illiteracy among African Americans decreased, but white illiteracy declined slowly. Schools had short terms and inadequate buildings, yet teacher quality improved. Some districts extended terms through private funding, and new buildings emerged. Progress was subtle but significant, with the Peabody Fund playing a vital role. George Peabody initiated the fund in 1867 to boost education in Southern states. Led by Robert C. Winthrop and Barnas Sears, the fund established model schools, funded universities, and provided guidance. Dr. J.L.M. Curry succeeded Sears, advocating for education through speeches and public sentiment development. Despite poverty hindering progress, advocates believed in education for all, aiming to overcome challenges in the South's educational landscape.|['1.

In the Southern states, the idea of public education faced several challenges. Some believed that education should be the responsibility of families or churches, not the government. There were also selfish individuals who did not want to pay taxes to educate others. Additionally, existing struggling academies, often tied to religious denominations, hindered the growth of public schools. Some people opposed public education altogether, especially for the masses. The issue of educating African Americans also posed a challenge, with many white people feeling negative about the results of African American education. Tax systems and legislative limitations further complicated the establishment of public schools. Despite these obstacles, public sentiment in favor of education grew stronger over time. Legislation increased taxation for schools, improved school facilities, and raised teacher salaries. However, challenges like the mania for small school districts and resistance to transportation services hindered progress in extending school terms. Yet, efforts by philanthropic organizations, denominational boards, and private initiatives helped establish schools for African Americans. Today, there are various types of schools for African Americans, including those under public control, denominational schools, and independent schools supported by private donations.|"['1.

After the Reconstruction period, efforts were made to educate African Americans in the South. Initially, there was support for teaching training programs for both white and black teachers. However, the allocation of funds differed, with more money going towards white education over time. Despite attempts to establish normal schools for black teachers, the supply was insufficient. Many black teachers were inexperienced and some lacked dedication. While black public schools mirrored white schools, challenges persisted. Parents' interest in their children's education waned over time, partly due to financial constraints and the transient nature of tenant farming. The idea of educating African Americans to assimilate into white culture through traditional subjects like Latin and Greek was prevalent. Schools like Hampton and Tuskegee focused on practical education, but many others clung to traditional academic subjects. The introduction of industrial training faced resistance from the black community, leading to limited public funding for such programs.|"['1.

Most schools for African Americans aim for college-level education, although some institutions that claim to be colleges have only elementary or secondary students. Out of 33 schools, only three - Howard University, Fisk University, and Meharry Medical College - truly function as colleges. Despite increased funding for education in some Southern states since 1910, the allocation for African American schools has not risen proportionately. For instance, in North Carolina, the total pay for African American teachers was significantly less than that of white teachers. The disparity in funding can partly be attributed to the lack of demand for high school education among African American children, resulting in fewer resources allocated to their schools. Moreover, public sentiment and the distribution of funds play a role in the inadequate support for African American education.|['1.

Several funds have been established to support the education of African Americans. The John F. Slater Fund, initiated with $1,000,000 in 1882, now totals $1,750,000, primarily aiding training schools. The Jeanes Fund, created by Miss Anna T. Jeanes, focuses on paying rural school supervisors' salaries to enhance hygiene, sanitation, and home industries. The Phelps Stokes Fund, founded by Miss Caroline Phelps Stokes, studies the African American education problem and provides fellowships. In 1914, Mr. Julius Rosenwald offered rural communities up to $300 for school buildings. The General Education Board supports both African American and Southern education, contributing to industrial schools and colleges. Southern whites are increasingly enthusiastic about education, extending school terms, improving teaching quality, and building community-centered schools. The need for more funding requires tax reform and increased taxable property to further develop education in the South.|['1. What was the purpose of the John F.

"Over the past decade, numerous public high schools have emerged, with a majority located in rural areas. While some schools continue with traditional curricula, a new type of institution, the ""farm life school,"" is emerging. These schools often include departments focusing on household economics. The General Education Board reports that $20,000,000 has been invested in improved school buildings since the appointment of secondary education professors in Southern universities. These professors, funded by the Board, play a crucial role in coordinating high school activities and acting as educational advocates. The South boasts numerous colleges, some with rich histories and others driven by faith and ambition. Despite challenges, colleges have seen increased enrollment, with a focus on improving standards and preparation for students. Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, stands out for its substantial endowment and rigorous entrance requirements, setting a standard for college readiness. The growth of public schools has changed the landscape of education, with more students coming from public high schools.

Educational standards have improved due to rising income, influenced by reports from the Carnegie Foundation. While stronger institutions have increased their requirements, weaker ones have shifted to offering two years of college work without granting degrees. Southern States lack consistent supervision over college degree quality, leading to some institutions awarding diplomas for secondary work. Despite challenges, the educational landscape in the South is evolving positively. Rural schools are extending terms and increasing teacher pay. High schools are progressing, and universities are enhancing their capabilities. Although some old prejudices linger, economic growth and changing mindsets are breaking down barriers.

The workers in the Southern factories are mostly born in the South, unlike other regions where immigrants have filled the gaps left by those who moved away. The South's population growth, excluding Oklahoma, lags behind the rest of the country due to fewer immigrants settling there. Many laborers have rural backgrounds or come from farming families, leading to an individualistic mindset without much collective action. Labor unions are not widespread except in some skilled trades, and class consciousness is lacking in the South. Industries in the South mainly focus on raw materials with limited processing. They produce but don't fully utilize resources like cotton, lumber, iron, and steel, relying on other regions for finished products. The South is seeing economic growth and increased capital accumulation, especially during the Great War, leading to potential growth in manufacturing. Labor shortages are emerging, prompting the need for machinery in agriculture. To ensure long-term prosperity, the South needs to increase productivity with fewer workers and adopt modern practices.|"['1.

A practical cotton-picking machine is essential for the South to address its challenges. While families can grow more cotton than they can pick by hand, current machines lack simplicity, efficiency, and affordability. Similar to the reaper and binder, this machine is only needed for a short period each year but is crucial during that time. Introducing such a machine would transform the tenant system, increase food production, and free up labor for other tasks. The future of the Southern economy relies on progress in farming. Despite improvements, the South still depends on other regions for food. The recent rise in agricultural prices has benefited some farmers, but there is a need for increased productivity per worker. The political landscape in the South is changing, with more common people influencing politics. While some politicians uphold traditions, many lack national perspective and international awareness.

"The main party in the South is known as the Democratic party, but today the name does not carry the same meaning as it did in the past. Representatives often align with the views of their district. Some Southern Democrats support ideas that are quite different from traditional democracy, as remnants of Populistic beliefs still linger. The term ""Democracy"" in the South primarily represents the white man's party, reflecting the beliefs of the majority of white men in the region. Although African Americans no longer hold significant voting power, the issue of race continues to influence politics. Prohibition of alcohol is widely supported in the South, leading to strong backing for this cause among representatives. The push for women's suffrage has not gained overwhelming support, as conscientious objections hinder progress in this area. Some states have allowed women to vote in primary elections, but full suffrage is still being debated. Socially, the South is undergoing changes, with old customs fading and a sense of social responsibility emerging. Traditional Southern figures like the ""typical Southerner"" are becoming rare, as the region adapts to new social norms and responsibilities."|"['1.

In the past, orphans were sometimes mistreated if they had no family to care for them. Nowadays, various groups, including religious organizations and community orders, run well-managed institutions for orphans. The issue of delinquent children is also being addressed, with some states establishing facilities for their care. However, young African American offenders, who often lack proper home guidance, still need more attention. The South, once known for its aristocratic society, is now more democratic, with social status less tied to birth. Small Southern towns have simple social lives, mainly organized by women. Men are expected to focus on work rather than leisure activities like hunting or golf. Women are now actively involved in various organizations and community efforts, showcasing a shift towards more inclusive and diverse social engagement.|['1.

Women in the South have played a crucial role in preserving the region's history. The Daughters of the Confederacy, in particular, have shown a deep connection to the past. Recent events, like the Great War, have brought the national government closer to them. This closeness has sparked a sense of patriotism and unity among Southern women. They have actively participated in various activities such as raising money for organizations like the Red Cross and selling War Savings Stamps. Women have also been breaking traditional norms by engaging in public activities like asking for contributions on the streets. This shift in behavior reflects a growing desire for independence and a reevaluation of societal expectations. The influence of public opinion in the South remains strong, but more women are asserting their independence and demanding the right to make their own choices.|"[""1.

In the Southern United States, women make up the majority of church members but have faced inequality in church leadership. Some denominations started granting full rights to their members in 1918, but the Southern Methodist Church bishops delayed this decision. The adult population in the South has strong ties to Protestant denominations, with Roman Catholics being the majority in certain states due to French heritage. Baptist and Methodist churches are prevalent throughout the region, with Presbyterian and Episcopal influences. The evangelical teachings of Baptists and Methodists have shaped the religious landscape, emphasizing a focus on the afterlife. Despite changes over the years, Southern religious communities still hold conservative views on worldly pleasures, with strict observance of the Sabbath and disapproval of activities like dancing and theater-going. Southern culture reflects a sense of gravity and austerity, with little room for frivolity in social gatherings.|"[""1.

"In the South, changes in social standards are evident. The older generation struggles to uphold traditional norms as younger people embrace modern ways. Despite disapproval, activities like bridge clubs thrive, and youth enjoy dancing and theater outings. Southern cities are transitioning from being labeled ""poor show towns"" as Sunday activities evolve, including post office visits, reading papers, and car rides. Some churches focus on social issues, but financial constraints hinder their impact. Rural areas witness a shift as pastors engage in farming and community development, slowing the rural-to-urban migration.

"In the past, the South was often considered a frontier region where people took the law into their own hands due to a lack of trust in the police. Individuals valued their ability to defend themselves and their honor without seeking help. This sense of honor often led to quick reactions to insults, sometimes resulting in violence. The concept of the ""unwritten law"" was used to justify actions, such as acquitting those who sought vengeance for perceived wrongs. While public sentiment in the South has evolved, there are still remnants of this mindset. Some defend the use of the ""unwritten law"" based on low rates of certain social issues, while others caution against the dangers of vigilante justice. The Southerner's individualistic nature sometimes clashes with the idea of a higher, impartial law.

North Carolina has set up more than five thousand school libraries, with the state, county, and patrons sharing the costs. The South has seen an increase in both reading and writing. Southern writers have gained recognition in American literature. While the number of noteworthy writers has grown, there are still few books on national issues. The New South presents contradictions, with advancements in industry alongside primitive economic practices. Despite this, the South remains hopeful for the future. Some Southern states faced debts post-Reconstruction, with Alabama's being particularly large. The debt was reduced through various means, including repudiation, to make it manageable. North Carolina also faced debt issues post-Reconstruction, with a compromise reached in 1879 that significantly reduced the state's debt burden.|"['1.

Not all creditors initially agreed to the compromise offered by the State. Over time, as the State remained steadfast in its position, bondholders began to realize the inevitable outcome. By 1893, over $1,000,000 worth of old bonds were still outstanding. In 1901, a New York firm presented ten convertible bonds to South Dakota, leading to a legal battle in the Supreme Court of the United States, resulting in the collection of the amount owed. South Carolina faced challenges due to incompetence and corruption, with a debt that ballooned from $6,666,000 in 1868 to around $29,000,000 within three years. Louisiana's debt soared to $41,000,000 to $48,000,000 by 1872, despite a debt limit of $25,000,000. The debt was later reduced and restructured to about $12,000,000 with a seven percent interest rate. Arkansas and Tennessee also grappled with debts, with Arkansas repudiating bonds worth nearly $13,000,000, while Tennessee settled its debt by funding a portion at a reduced rate.|"[""1.

Virginia faced significant financial challenges after the Civil War, with a debt of $33 million growing to $45 million by 1870. In 1871, a plan was devised to settle the debt, assigning a portion to West Virginia and restructuring the rest into new bonds with lower interest rates. However, the state struggled to meet its obligations, leading to debates on how to address the debt. A political party called the Readjusters, led by H.H. Riddleberger, emerged advocating for debt reduction. Despite opposition, the Readjusters gained control of the Legislature in 1879 and attempted to pass bills to reduce the debt, which were vetoed. The debt issue persisted until 1892 when a compromise was reached, exchanging $19 million in new bonds for the older debt. West Virginia also disputed its debt share but was eventually required to pay its fair portion in 1915.|"[""1.

Many older books offer historical insights, but the rapidly changing conditions in the South make them less helpful in understanding the present. A.W. Tourgée's _Appeal to Caesar_ (1884) foresaw a future South with a predominantly black population. Alexander K. McClure's _The South; its Industrial, Financial and Political Condition_ (1886) optimistically discussed the economic growth of Southern States. W.D. Kelley's _The Old South and the New_ (1887) provided a Pennsylvania politician's keen observations on economic development. Walter H. Page's _The Rebuilding of Old Commonwealths_ (1902) analyzed factors hindering progress in the South. Notably, recent works fail to fully cover this period, with most focusing on specific aspects. Valuable information can be found in _The South in the Building of the Nation_ series (1909-13) and the _Library of Southern Literature_ (1907-1913). Albert Bushnell Hart's _The Southern South_ (1910) offers a detailed study of Southern sociology, while Edgar Gardner Murphy's _Problems of the Present South_ (1904) provides insightful discussions on unresolved Southern issues. Other works like _The New South_ in the _Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science_ (1910) and _Studies in Southern History and Politics_ (1914) are also recommended for further exploration.|"[""1.

A complete history of education in the South is yet to be written. Various sources shed light on different aspects of education in the region. Edgar W.
