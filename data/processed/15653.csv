Tom mentioned that he was the first to arrive at the picnic spot. He shared how he encountered a woman with hair he admired while looking for the oil can.

The morning had passed quickly, and the afternoon promised to be just as short. Dorothy quickly got her warm clothes, called Tavia, and made it to the lunch table before Nat returned with the Fire Bird from the garage. Surprisingly, Tavia appeared almost happy. Since deciding to stick by Dorothy, much of her apparent trouble had vanished. She seemed brighter than she had been in days, and even Nat dropped the reserve he had shown her recently. At The Elms, they picked up Tom, armed with a hatchet, to bag the game. Despite the stormy weather, they headed to Tanglewood Park. Snowflakes began to fall, and the winds grew fierce, making driving difficult. Upon reaching the castle, they sought refuge from the blizzard. Tom suggested exploring the castle, and while the boys raced around, the girls admired the grand rooms but felt uneasy. Despite the boys' reassurances, Tavia stayed close to the front door, ready to run.|['1.

Tom disregarded Dorothy's objection and slid down the baluster rail to the mosaic floor below. He explored the cellar, intrigued by the scents and the well-preserved condition of the place. Sensing unease, Nat suggested moving the car to a nearby farmhouse. As they ventured out into the snow, a mishap sent them tumbling into a hole. Nat retrieved supplies from the car, and they settled in a room adorned with inviting mottoes. To lighten the mood, the boys entertained the girls with antics. Eventually, they decided to rest for the night, with the girls reclining on couches while the boys stood guard. Despite the eerie setting, the warmth of the lamps and camaraderie eased their fears.|"[""1.

Captain Mayberry was bundled up in warm layers before being helped into the vehicle. Major Dale and Tom Scott accompanied him on the way to the hospital.
