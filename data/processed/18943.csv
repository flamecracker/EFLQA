Tom Slade leaned over the office table, studying the detailed map of Temple Camp. It had been a while since he returned from France, and the sight of the familiar locations on the map made him homesick for the scout camp he loved. The dotted line representing the hill trail held memories of earning his pathfinder's badge. Black Lake, a simple circle on the map, brought back images of moonlit nights and scout activities. Tom preferred this map over those of war zones; it symbolized adventure to him. As he jotted down cabin numbers, he gazed out of the window at the bustling city scene below, contemplating dictating a letter. Despite facing cannons and grenades in the war, Tom found dictating to Miss Margaret Ellison, the stenographer, to be his biggest challenge. He was determined to overcome his fear and gain confidence in expressing himself.|"[""1.

Tom Slade, a dedicated scout, always wore his badge to troop meetings to show his commitment. Despite his forgetfulness due to shell-shock, he eagerly awaited Friday nights with his troop at Temple Camp. The Bridgeboro Troop, with notable members like Roy Blakeley and Peewee Harris, held a special place at the camp. During a lively meeting, Roy jokingly nominated himself and Harris as boss and vice-boss. Another scout, a quiet boy with a pale face, enjoyed the banter silently. Plans were made for the upcoming camp trip, including painting patrol animals on cabin doors instead of numbers. Uncle Jeb suggested this change to avoid cabins looking like they had automobile licenses.|"['1.

Roy suggested painting the heads of their patrol animals on the cabins to make them feel more like scouts. He proposed buying paint for thirty cents each instead of twenty-five.

That morning, everything seemed to go awry. The paths didn't meet where they should have, perhaps due to Lucky Luke's involvement. Tom arrived early at the Temple Camp office on a busy Saturday, finding a personal letter postmarked from Dansburg, Ohio.

"Tom remained quiet. The letter held more significance for him than Uncle Jeb had realized. It struck a chord deep within his simple, steady nature, and his eyes sparkled as he reread it, absorbing its warm, friendly, familiar words. In the midst of the chaos of war, with its perils and hardships, he had found at least one true friend. Despite the explosion that had rocked his world, causing him to lose Roy and his cherished companions, it had brought him a genuine friend. At that moment, he felt the need for a friend more than ever. The cheerful letter momentarily pushed aside the memory of Roy's hurtful words, replacing them with memories of France. ""Perhaps you'd like to hear about it,"" he said to Uncle Jeb. The setting sun painted the sky over the lake with hues of crimson, illuminating the cabins and the deserted cooking shack. Tom's heart swelled with memories of past adventures with Roy, especially their explorations along Silver Fox trail in the mountains. Though challenges lay ahead, he was determined to finish building the cabins and depart before others arrived. Tom envisioned the camaraderie that would flourish among his friends on the hill, except for one missing presence. He hoped Roy would reveal the secrets of Devil's Pool to Barnard and his troop. The toughest part had been ensuring Margaret and Mr. Burton's silence, but now all that remained was for Lucky Luke to construct the cabins and leave. It seemed like a straightforward task."|"[""1.

Suddenly, everything became bright. A fellow stood near me, and a loud noise rang in my ears. Dirt flew, and the fellow yelled. I stumbled and fell into a hot place, like an oven, a new shell-hole. I lay there, my arm hurting, ears buzzing, and a strange pain in my neck. This is how shell-shock starts. The fellow asked if I was okay. I couldn't speak, my throat trembling. My wet sleeve and throbbing arm worried me. He noticed my scout badge and asked my name. Suddenly, a noisy object got stuck above us. He tried to free us with his helmet.

Uncle Jeb, clever and kind, noticed Tom's ambitious but challenging plans. Determined to help, he decided to assist Tom by chopping wood and hauling logs up the hill the next day. Tom, working tirelessly, set up his base on the hill, rarely descending to the main camp. Each day, from sunrise till dusk, he toiled, cooking simple meals over a campfire. Building the final cabin required felling, trimming, and hauling logs uphill using ropes and pulleys. Tom faced challenges fitting the logs in place as the structure grew taller. Building alone was tough; special logs by the doorway and window needed precise cutting. Despite exhaustion, Tom persevered, working late into the night to meet the looming deadline of August first. As the days passed, Tom felt the weight of impending defeat, knowing he must finish before the scouts arrived. Despite his sore muscles and fatigue, he pressed on, longing for Uncle Jeb's return to share the burden.|"['1.
