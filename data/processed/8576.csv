Frank was thrilled with his new task and eagerly began sorting through drawers to select items for display. That evening, he spent his earnings on much-needed undergarments. His employer then ordered showcases for the window, following Frank's suggestions. However, the sailor's cat and macaw garnered so much attention that sailors and their wives flocked to have their own specimens mounted. The sailor even offered to pay more for his beloved cat due to the newfound popularity. Orders poured in faster than Frank could manage, but he dedicated long hours to the shop cases, which became a hit with the locals. Despite the success, the old naturalist, Frank's mentor, expressed concerns about Frank's future, foreseeing that he would seek greater opportunities outside their quiet shop.|"['1.

After settling into his new job, Frank wrote to his friend, the doctor, in Deal, sharing his progress and passion for his work. He asked the doctor to keep his address secret from others until he made further advancements. Frank also wrote a cheerful letter to his friend Ruthven, describing his London adventures and new job at a naturalist's shop. Ruthven later surprised Frank at work, expressing relief at finding him after his mysterious disappearance. Ruthven shared that Frank's father was concerned and eager to reconnect. He urged Frank to either visit home or have his father come to see him soon, as his father had a promising opportunity in mind.

Frank was apologetic for hiding from his friends, admitting he was wrong and foolish. His friend, Ruthven, guided him to his father's home in Eaton Square. There, they chatted in Ruthven's cluttered room until Sir James returned. Ruthven asked Frank to write a note to request cases for a dinner guest interested in such matters. Dick, Ruthven's father, allowed Frank and Ruthven to dine quietly in Dick's room instead of joining the dinner party. Dick advised Frank that it's important to rely on others and not hide from friends. Frank admitted his mistake and shared that he would likely act similarly in the future. The afternoon was spent pleasantly, and Frank learned about Ruthven's future plans. Later, the footman brought the cases, which Dick enjoyed.

Later, Frank and Mr. Goodenough ordered attire suitable for Central Africa. They selected simple clothes like soft flannel shirts, tough flax jackets, and gaiters. Mr. Goodenough advised on essential items like a revolver, carbine, and shotgun. They also arranged for a soft felt hat and a blowgun for shooting.

At midnight, they reached Liverpool and checked into the Station Hotel. The next morning, Frank was surprised by the large pile of luggage in the hall, a common sight due to the frequent steamers departing for America. Their baggage was minimal, just a portmanteau each, as Mr. Goodenough had sent down his boxes earlier. At noon, they boarded the Niger bound for Africa's west coast. The climate contrast between Madeira and Africa was discussed, emphasizing the challenges of the African interior. The conversation touched on the prevalence of fevers and dysentery in Africa, highlighting the importance of proper treatment. Hiring followers in Sierra Leone was discouraged due to the locals' behavior, with plans to recruit carriers from tribes they visit. The assistance of Houssas and Kroomen for protection and support was also mentioned.|['1.

Frank had a thrilling run on shore, but noticed the laid-back atmosphere among the locals in Sierra Leone. The roads were unique, paved with round stones unsuitable for wheeled vehicles. Carts moved smoothly on greased runners, with drivers using candles for lubrication. The people strolled leisurely, soldiers seemed untrained, and shopkeepers showed little interest in customers. Frank and his friend rode a hand sledge down a mountain, marveling at the speed. Mr. Goodenough planned to buy hammocks and cane chairs, appreciating their comfort and lightness. Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, perched above the sea, surrounded by lush hills. Mr. Goodenough remarked on the missed opportunity for Europeans to live healthier lives on the elevated hills. He observed how the allure of the coast and unhealthy habits often led them to forsake the healthier alternative.|"['1.

A fleet of boats, each with ten to twelve men, neared the ship. They waited until the harbor master declared the ship free from quarantine. Then, with shouts and laughter, they scrambled aboard. Mr. Goodenough explained that many were there for fun, some to offer services, and others to fetch luggage. Frank observed a lively scene as boatmen vied for passengers. Amid the chaos, the ladder broke, causing a splash, much to the amusement of all. Mr. Goodenough likened the boatmen to children, noting their jovial and quarrelsome nature. He remarked on their imitative skills and limited originality. As they rowed to shore, Frank marveled at the lush greenery and the vibrant town filled with a lively, diverse population.|"['1.

Sierra Leone was a place filled with joy and laughter. Everyone there was cheerful and eager to share in conversations with laughter. Frank was amazed by the variety of fruits in the market, from sweet oranges to refreshing limes. Mr. Goodenough bought a basket of fruit before they boarded the ship and set off down the coast. Along the way, they passed Liberia and Monrovia, the capital. They marveled at the skilled Kroomen in their light canoes. Despite the canoes being easily tipped, the Kroomen navigated them with ease. The travelers decided to stay aboard a floating hulk due to the unhealthy conditions on the coast. They were welcomed by the agent in charge, who relied on spirits for medicinal purposes. The agent explained the importance of trading goods like calico and beads in Africa. Their journey continued as they planned to meet the local king.|['1.

Frank felt let down upon arriving in Bonny. Sierra Leone had painted a grand picture of African civilization, but Bonny shattered that illusion. The houses, crafted from black mud, lined narrow and disgustingly dirty streets. The palace, a few hovels enclosed by mud walls, housed the king, a nearly naked man. During a meal with the king, disappointment arose when Mr. Goodenough revealed they weren't traders bringing gifts. The king hinted at the oddities of European food choices. Leaving Bonny, Frank anticipated the journey to Fernando Po on the Retriever, a small steamer. The island, owned by Spain, was lush but plagued by poor health conditions. The town of Clarence was unremarkable, inhabited solely by traders. The native Adiza people lived primitively without clothes. The island served as a prison, with convicts on guard ships. Continuing to the Gaboon on a sailing ship, Frank practiced shooting to hone his skills.|"[""1.

Mr. Goodenough discussed the plan to shoot elephants for ivory and meat to cover expenses during their journey. They arrived at the Gaboon after sixteen days, where they saw French forts, English factories, an American mission, and King William's town. Mr. Goodenough found a house on stilts due to disease in the soil. He hired six Houssa guards from Bonny, who had unique sailor-given names. Frank, feeling ill from heat, met a Mpongwe man named Ostik, who spoke English and had traveled with a white explorer. Ostik agreed to accompany them for safety against potential tribal threats.

The luggage included ten large metal boxes, each about 80 pounds heavy, filled with cotton cloths, powder, beads, tea, chocolate, sugar, and biscuits. Three bundles of stair rods, wrapped in canvas, were also part of the load, along with a 50-pound double canvas tent and two folding tressel beds, each weighing 15 pounds. In total, fourteen men were needed to carry everything, along with provisions, portmanteaus, rugs, and waterproof sheets. Additionally, there were six iron chests, four with trays for insects and two for bird skins, all equipped with India rubber strips to keep out moisture and ants. It took four to five days to gather a crew due to the locals' fear of the cannibal Fans. Mr. Goodenough ensured a safe return before proceeding. The party set off in a large canoe with twelve paddlers, armed with Snider rifles and trained in shooting accuracy. To give an impressive appearance, each Houssa was given New Zealand flax trousers and a red sash. They camped at Nenge Nenge, a former missionary station, where they quickly set up a tent for the night.|['1. What items were included in the luggage for the expedition?\nA. Metal tools and ropes\nB.

The men's weapons were secured to a pole to protect them from the damp night air. Ostik immediately began unloading, while the Houssas set up the tent. A fire was lit, and a kettle hung over it. Rice and salt meat were served, more than expected, lifting the men's spirits. In the morning, after breakfast, they resumed paddling. They reached the Fan village of Olenga after six hours. The villagers, different from coastal tribes, were curious about the white men. The chief welcomed them, and gifts were exchanged to show goodwill. Later, a magic lantern show amazed the villagers, causing excitement and fear. The travelers aimed to impress and build trust with the locals.|"['1.

The next scene was initially puzzling for many. It depicted a ship battling rough waters. Some viewers recognized it as the river mouth. There were twenty slides in total, each with movable figures. The last two were chromatropes, dazzling the natives with dancing colors. The show ended, but the village buzzed for hours with excitement. The Fans were amazed by the white men's abilities. Over the next two days at Olenga, the people grew more comfortable. Frank's interactions delighted them. Mr. Goodenough amazed them with a galvanic battery, making everyone jump. He then performed chemical experiments and magic tricks, leaving them in awe. Moving on to Itchongue, they were warmly received. Negotiations secured carriers for the journey ahead, passing through villages and navigating rapids towards the falls.|"['1.

Mr. Goodenough and his team embarked on a journey, ready to start their work. They heard unfamiliar bird calls and expected a good harvest. The priority was finding food beyond the six sacks of rice they had. They spotted hippopotamus tracks and gathered alligators' eggs for food. They used explosive shells to take down the animals. The team successfully hunted and prepared the meat for camp. The next day, they set out again, capturing rare birds and butterflies. Frank excelled at capturing butterflies in a clearing. The team's spirits were high with the prospect of plentiful food and successful hunting.|"[""1.

After breakfast, they once more ventured out, with Frank hugging the stream's edge where he spotted numerous butterflies and kingfisher birds earlier. While walking, engrossed in the trees above after hearing a bird call, a sudden shout from behind made him jump back. A close call, as an alligator lunged towards him with its tail, aiming for food. Thanks to the Houssa's warning, Frank dodged in time. Reacting instinctively, he fired both barrels into the alligator's open mouth, causing it to flip over and struggle in the water. The Houssa swiftly ended its misery with a shot to the eye. The alligator was fished out later, providing them with a meal. Mr. Goodenough stressed the importance of vigilance in alligator territory, where women are often targeted. After a fortnight, they moved deeper into the mountains, anticipating new insect discoveries. They set up camp by a rivulet, ready to hunt baboons for fresh meat with a few armed Houssas.|"[""1.

Travelers followed sounds to find baboons. Males like big dogs, some sunned on rocks, others groomed by females. Babies clung to females' necks, others played. Mr. Goodenough shot a male baboon, causing others to attack. More baboons killed before retreat. Dead baboons skinned, cooked. Frank hesitant but found meat tasty. Setting bait for leopards, warning of danger. Fans scared, stayed in camp. Houssas guarded, accompanied travelers. No leopard sightings. Meat hung up as bait. Mr. Goodenough and Frank waited in tree. Clear night. Explosive bullets ready. Houssas watched camp. Fans kept fires. Unlucky bait placement. Hope to spot leopards soon.|"['1.

In response to the loud roars of the leopards, the locals kept shouting continuously. The roaring persisted for hours, sometimes nearby and sometimes far off. Frank struggled to stay awake, hoping the leopards would leave. He almost fell asleep a few times, his grip on the rifle slipping. Suddenly, his companion nudged him, and he noticed movement below the bait. Another creature approached. They both fired, causing two loud roars. One leopard ran off, and the other fell but managed to get up and follow. Mr. Goodenough fired again, unsure if he hit the second leopard. They decided it was safe to proceed as the sounds indicated the leopards had moved away. The next morning, they planned to track the injured leopards. Approaching cautiously, they found one leopard dead from their shots. Frank marveled at the animal's resilience despite the severe wounds. Mr. Goodenough confirmed that the howls heard earlier were from the injured leopard, now deceased.|"['1.

A thorough search began for the second leopard's trail. The Houssas retraced their steps to the tree and discovered a new path marked by blood. They followed it meticulously, sometimes losing sight of the blood entirely. Suddenly, a roar pierced the air, and a massive body leaped towards Frank. Startled, Frank stumbled, but Mr. Goodenough swiftly fired, saving Frank from harm. The leopard was swiftly defeated. Grateful for the escape, Mr. Goodenough cautioned Frank about the dangers of hunting wounded leopards near trees. Later, Frank fell ill with a severe fever, requiring treatment and rest. After recovery, they resumed their journey cautiously, taking time for rest and hunting. During an expedition, Frank chased a butterfly, losing track of time and direction.

Frank, armed with his revolver, fired six shots into the silent woods, hoping for a response. None came. Realizing he was lost, he resisted the urge to run aimlessly. With darkness approaching, he climbed a tree to spend the night. Despite the eerie sounds of the forest, he stayed alert. Unable to sleep, he remained in the tree until dawn. Descending, he set off southward, hoping to reach the camp by following the sun. After hours of walking, the terrain changed, causing him concern. The swampy ground made him change direction, aiming to find firmer footing.

His progress slowed as he navigated the dense bush, filled with thorny plants and countless creepers obstructing his way. Constantly looking up through the trees to glimpse the sun, his sole guide, added to his challenge. By eleven o'clock, he halted, the sun too high to guide him accurately. Exhausted after nearly six hours of walking without food since the previous day's midday meal, he was parched from rinsing his mouth with the swamp's black water. Fatigued from a sleepless night, he lay down under a tree for hours. Upon waking, he resumed his journey, using the sun as his guide once more. After two hours, he reached higher ground with thinner brushwood, renewed hope propelling him northward. Later in the afternoon, he encountered a native path, offering a chance for food and guidance. Following the path northwest, he heard baboons approaching, one carrying a baby with a string of blue beads. Realizing the baboons had taken a native child, he intervened, rescuing the baby and facing the angered baboons.|"['1.

A group of monkeys attacked Frank, biting and scratching him until he was thrown to the ground. Despite his efforts to defend himself, the situation seemed dire. Fortunately, the monkeys suddenly stopped and some kind villagers helped him up. They carried him to their village, where they tended to his wounds with poultices made from crushed leaves. When Frank indicated he was hungry and thirsty, they provided water and cakes made from yams. Later, a woman brought him a pineapple to eat, which refreshed him.

The next day, Frank discovered what had occurred while he was away. The Houssa returned late at night, explaining that Frank instructed him to stay with the guns until dusk. After firing shots and receiving no reply, he returned to camp, causing concern. The following morning, Mr. Goodenough and five Houssas searched the area where Frank was last seen. Despite shouting and firing guns, Frank was not found. The search continued for days, with fears of a leopard attack growing. After ten days, Frank recovered and the group resumed their journey.

After encountering the natives, it was decided not to venture further into the interior due to the potential dangers. The village was burnt down as a warning, and gifts were given to the locals.

Mr. Goodenough offered to provide eight bottles of medicine to last for two months until the return of the chiefs. He explained that he had a good supply reserved for special occasions. Reflecting on his past, he shared that he was born in a village about seventy years ago, where his father was the chief. The village was smaller, dirtier, and poorer back then. He recalled the hardships of his youth, where everyone fought against each other, taking slaves and selling them to white men. At around seventeen, he joined expeditions to fight other villages and take people as slaves. However, a tragic event changed his perspective, realizing the cruelty of such actions. This experience shaped his strong belief against the burning of villages and enslaving people, a conviction he held firmly.|"['1.

Sam encountered the white men at the mouth of the river for the first time. They were Spanish men who treated the enslaved people terribly. The enslaved individuals were kept in a large shed called a barracoon with minimal food and water. They were whipped if they complained. Eventually, a ship arrived, and they were taken on board, cramped in a low space and chained to the deck. The conditions were unbearable, with extreme heat and lack of air. The ship set sail, but chaos ensued as the ship was attacked. The enslaved people suffered greatly during the voyage, enduring sickness and death. Despite the harsh treatment, some managed to survive with the help of the sailors.|['1.

After that, things improved. The weather was pleasant, and we didn't see any more English ships. They allowed half of us on deck for a few hours every day. They also increased our food rations to fatten us up. We speculated among ourselves that they might be planning to eat us when we reached land. Some considered not eating, but they were whipped for attempting it. They decided it was better to be well-fed if they were to be eaten. Finally, land was in sight. We were kept below until night, then brought on deck to find the ship in a creek. We were taken ashore in boats and marched through the night. At dawn, we were halted. Several white men on horses inspected us, divided us into groups, and led us into the country. Eventually, I and twenty others arrived at a plantation in the hills. We were lined up before a stern white man who explained that if we worked hard, we would be treated well, but slackers would be whipped. I was young and strong, earning a reputation as a diligent worker. The master kept his promise, providing good food and allowing us to grow our food. After a few years, I married a woman from my village, and we were given gifts for our wedding. However, when the overseer took charge, conditions deteriorated. We endured beatings for no reason until one day, he fatally injured my wife and child. In a fit of rage, I struck him down,|"['1.

I knew it wasn't safe for Sam, so I grabbed my hoe and ran as fast as I could. No one tried to stop me. Other slaves danced and sang when they saw the overseer fall. I ran all day through the hills, avoiding plantations until I reached the wild part. Whenever I came to a stream, I walked in it for a while, climbed trees, and ran again to escape the bloodhounds. Eventually, I felt safe and rested for a few hours before continuing my journey. I reached a secluded area and lit a fire. Soon, other runaway slaves found me. We shared stories, and they agreed I did the right thing. We lived in peace for a year, hiding from soldiers searching the mountains.

"The next day, the captain signaled for me to join him. I followed him to the shore where a man stood on a platform with a black woman beside him. Several men approached and examined her. The man shouted loudly, and others said brief things. Finally, he banged on the table, and a man instructed the woman to follow him, and she left. Then a boy was brought up, followed by two more women, and the same process was repeated each time. The man called out, and the captain pushed through the crowd with me, directing me to climb the platform. As I looked around, everyone laughed. The man shouted again, and several men inspected my arms and legs, pointing out the marks left by the whip on my back. They laughed once more. Eventually, the man banged on the table again, and a white man from the crowd approached me, took my arm, and signaled for me to go with him.

Fifteen years flew by, filled with joy, until the old master passed away, followed swiftly by missy. The young master differed greatly from his father. I believe the old man erred in spoiling his son, allowing him too much freedom. While I cherished the young master for the time we spent together, I worried about him inheriting the plantation. His nature wasn't bad; he had occasional outbursts but quickly calmed down. Yet, he indulged too much in pleasure, attending races and staying in town for weeks, engrossed in card games. There were two boys and two girls; the second boy attended West Point and joined the army. After the elders' demise, the household changed drastically. Previously, we hosted grand events with esteemed guests, but things shifted. The young master brought rowdy friends from Richmond, leading to late-night revelry. The young missies tried to reason with him. Eventually, a significant argument erupted, prompting them to move in with an aunt in the city. Matters worsened, and one day, missy handed my wife her freedom papers. Thankfully, the old man had prepared them correctly, foreseeing potential issues.

Sam was relieved when he learned that he and Sally had no children. He thanked the Lord that there were no children to be sold and separated. Despite the sadness of parting ways with Sally, he encouraged her to head north for her safety. Sam reassured Sally that one day they would reunite. He believed it was better to be apart for ten years than to risk being seized and sold to different masters. They tearfully said their goodbyes, and Sally left with the young missy before the plantation was raided and all the slaves were sold. The separation of families during the sale was heart-wrenching.

They placed him in a boat, and Sam went with him to the ship. They examined the wound and found it not very serious. The captain was turning around when they struck, and the blow had glanced off, but it had made an ugly gash. Due to the surprise, loss of blood, and the impact, the captain had lost consciousness. He soon regained consciousness, and Sam explained everything. The captain shook Sam's hand warmly, calling him his savior and asked what he could do for him. Sam decided not to stay on board. He suggested hiding ashore while the ship was searched in the morning. If the five men were found dead, there would be no suspicion on Sam. However, if only four were found dead, it could lead to trouble for Sam. So, the plan was for Sam to hide and swim out to the ship if the coast was clear.|"['1.

For two months, Sam searched all around Philadelphia, looking at every black woman he passed on the streets, but he found no trace of Sally. He then took a job as a waiter at a hotel and wrote to his former owner in Richmond to inquire about Sally's whereabouts, but received no response. Sam realized that a high-end hotel might not be the best place to find a missing person. So, he changed his approach and began selling books in the countryside, traveling thousands of miles and asking every black woman he met if they knew Sally. Despite not finding her, Sam made money and continued his search for three more years. One day, a woman approached him, revealing that she knew about his quest and invited him to join a secret network dedicated to helping slaves escape to freedom.

My task was to journey south and settle in the swamps of Carolina. I was to be transported on a trading schooner, land on the coast, and find my way to a swamp where an old man, Joe, had been working. He was very ill with swamp fever and wanted someone to take over after his passing. It was a challenging journey, with the locals denying knowledge of Joe. Eventually, I found the path to the swamp and discovered Joe had passed away. I took up residence in his hut, offering help to reunite spouses or aid those suffering from cruel masters. Living there for three years was solitary. I assisted slaves seeking freedom, guiding them through the swamps to safety.

In some societies, women are respected when they focus on domestic duties, but lose respect when they take on rough work traditionally done by men. The idea of women's rights and equality of work is debated. In a besieged town, the enemy approached with muskets, but the defenders, led by Mr. Goodenough, prepared by reinforcing the walls with sacks filled with earth and sharpened beams. The enemy's cannon fire was inaccurate, prompting Mr. Goodenough and his team to retaliate with modern rifles. The defenders, armed and ready, awaited the next move of the enemy, who seemed surprised by the town's defenses. Mr. Goodenough's strategic planning and the defenders' readiness to fight showcased their determination to protect their town.|"[""1.

Mr. Goodenough signaled, and Frank and the Houssas started shooting. The Dahomans' cheers turned to cries of anger and surprise. Mr. Goodenough's group continued firing, causing significant damage. Wounded soldiers were carried away, and bodies littered the ground. The enemy retaliated fiercely for hours, but the defenders held their ground. Mr. Goodenough predicted a change in tactics the next day. The most vulnerable point was reinforced with oil. The Abeokutans were encouraged by their success and the enemy's failed cannon attacks. At dawn, the Dahomans regrouped and charged the wall. The defenders, armed with muskets and bows, fought back. Despite the intense battle, the defenders stood firm, ready to repel any attack.|"[""1.

The Dahomans, equipped with muskets obtained from old government stocks, were regretfully not using them for peaceful purposes. These firearms were sold for very little and often ended up in Africa, fueling conflicts. The Abeokutans, lacking direct access to the coast, mainly relied on bows and arrows due to the difficulty of acquiring guns. During a siege, the defenders, led by Mr. Goodenough, used boiling oil and strategically placed spearmen and marksmen to repel the attackers. Despite the attackers' fierce assault, the defenders stood their ground with swords, spears, and firearms. The battle was intense, with casualties on both sides, but the defenders successfully repelled the Dahomans. The attackers, though brave, were forced to retreat, leaving behind their fallen comrades. The defenders, although sustaining some injuries, emerged victorious and held a thanksgiving service to celebrate their success.|['1.

The enemy swiftly positioned their cannons, shielded by sacks, despite the resistance from Mr. Goodenough's riflemen. The new location, a couple of hundred yards away, was fortified with twelve gun openings. The townspeople constructed a protective barrier with beams and sharp bamboos. After relentless fire from Dahomey, a large breach was created in the walls. The Dahomans charged, but the defenders' concentrated fire halted their advance. Despite heavy losses, the Dahomans tried to breach the defenses. The defenders, focusing on the leaders, inflicted significant casualties. After a fierce battle, the Dahomans retreated, leaving many dead. Mr. Goodenough believed the Dahomey power was weakened. The Dahomans resumed the attack at daybreak, firing over the fallen wall. The defenders reinforced the stockade with sacks to shield against the enemy's artillery. As the Dahomans' fire lessened, the defenders held their ground.|"['1.

When night fell, Mr. Goodenough, along with two hundred top troops from Abeokuta, gathered to plan a strategic attack on the enemy's battery. They crafted plugs to fit the cannonballs found in the stockade, ranging from six to eighteen pounds. Under the cover of darkness, the group quietly exited through a gate towards the enemy's position. The Dahomans were caught off guard, with their sentries facing the breach and leaving the flanks unguarded. Mr. Goodenough's party silently approached the enemy's battery and swiftly disabled their cannons, causing chaos among the Dahomans. The next morning, the enemy was in retreat, thanks to the successful operation. The people of Abeokuta were overjoyed and grateful for the assistance. Mr. Goodenough advised fortifying the city with flanking towers and a moat to deter future attacks. Despite their gratitude, the people could only offer a few native treasures to their allies, who were later struck with fever but eventually continued their journey towards England.|"[""1.

In 1828, the British aided the Fantis in defeating the Ashantis, leading to a treaty where the King of Ashanti acknowledged Fanti tribes' independence. Subsequently, in 1844 and 1852, a protectorate was established between the British and Fantis. The British pledged protection from external enemies in exchange for authority over the Fantis, forbidding internal conflicts and imposing a tribute. Despite this, the Ashantis invaded in 1853, 1863, and later. Tensions rose between the British and Dutch due to conflicting tribal loyalties. In 1867, an exchange of territories occurred. Troubles persisted, leading to conflicts between the Ashantis, Fantis, and Dutch. The Dutch eventually offered to transfer their possessions to the British, hoping to avoid further disputes. The British government hesitated, seeking peaceful resolutions to prevent native conflicts.|"[""1. What event led to the acknowledgment of Fanti tribes' independence by the King of Ashanti?\nA.

The handover took place smoothly. We bought the Dutch forts and stores, assuring the people of Elmina that we would only assume control with their approval. They were reminded that rejecting our protection would leave them vulnerable to the Fantis' hostility. After agreeing to our terms, a council was convened on April 4, 1872, where Elmina's king and chiefs confirmed the transfer. We gained possession of Elmina, Atjempon, and the Ashantis returned home. Governor Mr. Pope Hennessey offered peace and an increased annual gift to the King of Ashanti. Negotiations for Ashanti traders' free passage and the release of four Germans were ongoing. Upon landing at Gaboon in 1872, no issues with Ashanti were foreseen. Mr. Goodenough and Frank proceeded to Coomassie, encountering delays but eventually reaching the town amidst a grand reception.|"['1.

The group navigated through the bustling crowd, inching forward as the mass of people thickened with each step. They were guided to a unique house designated for their stay, where they would meet the king the next day. These houses were unlike any they had seen in Africa, made of smooth red clay with no external windows. The entrance led to an open courtyard surrounded by alcoves for seating. The accommodations included fresh food deliveries but a reminder to avoid the streets until meeting the king. Plans were made to present the king with valuable gifts, including rifles to impress him. The following day, they were summoned to the marketplace, a vibrant scene with the king and his entourage under colorful umbrellas, adorned with gold and silk. The king graciously accepted their gifts, sparking awe with the firing of the rifles. They were granted freedom to explore the town under the king's protection, accompanied by lively music back to their residence.|"[""1.

After the gathering had scattered, the two Englishmen strolled around the town. The town was not very large, but the streets were wide and well-maintained. Many houses were bigger than the ones assigned to them, but all followed the same layout. It was clear that most of the population they saw lived in villages outside the town. Three days later, they were summoned to the king's palace, a grand stone building at the town's edge. The king, seated on a raised throne, spoke of plans to drive away a group they had encountered. The missionaries they met later shared insights on negotiations for their release and the grim sacrifices in the land.

Mr. Goodenough addressed his men, advising them to either join the king's army and escape later or slip away immediately to avoid potential harm.

Mr. Goodenough spoke about the importance of hospitality and how travelers should be protected by kings. The king agreed, acknowledging that the men who were taken away were ignorant and should not have been frightened. He assured that if his warriors found them, no harm would come to them.

Frank fell ill with dysentery, but Mr. Goodenough prepared him for treatment and shared his will with him.

Mr. Goodenough fell ill and passed away in the night, leaving Frank and the missionaries mourning. The king, saddened by the news, sent warriors to attend the funeral.

The soldiers marched through the swamp, wading in water up to their knees, then crossed the Dah River at Agogo with water up to their necks. The path was just a narrow track through the forest, with many small streams to cross. Frank, lucky not to have had a fever recently, marched almost thirty miles to Fomanse, a large town with houses like those in Coomassie. He slept in a native house near the palace while the army camped on the ground. The next day, they crossed a hill, continued through the forest, and reached the Prah River where the main army camped. They paused for a week to gather provisions and crossed the Prah in large canoes. If the Ashanti army had moved quickly, Cape Coast and Elmina would have fallen. The English officials made mistakes that worsened the situation, leading to unrest among the Fantis. The Ashanti army, under Ammon Quatia's command, moved cautiously, attacking Assim villages but advancing slowly. Frank was closely guarded, and the army struggled with food shortages despite foraging in the forest. Many soldiers fell ill, losing weight and enthusiasm.|"['1.

After crossing the river, Frank sent Ostik to the general's hut with hot chocolate, which pleased Ammon Quatia. Frank continued to send a cup of hot chocolate daily, as he had plenty of preserved chocolate and milk, ideal for travelers. In return, the Ashanti general showed kindness by sending birds or animals and providing food. On April 8th, hostilities began when Fantis and fifty Houssas blocked the road outside Dunquah. The battle was traditional, with both sides firing from a distance behind trees. Frank avoided discussing tactics to prevent Ashantis from changing their strategy. The Fantis later initiated an attack, repeating the battle with heavy firing. Ammon Quatia and his warriors moved to the coast near Elmina to cut off trade to force the white men to leave. Frank explained to Ammon Quatia about England's strength and the potential arrival of white troops. Ammon Quatia doubted the white soldiers' survival due to the harsh climate.|"[""1.

Frank and the general discussed the English army's potential march to Coomassie. The general believed the army would fail due to local fetishes. Frank disagreed, stating that white men do not fear fetishes. The general, realizing the cultural differences, retreated to his camp. Frank, disguised as a native, observed the Union Jack nearby. The general then led a party towards Cape Coast Castle, planning a blockade. The Ashantis, mostly lazy but capable of exertion, were now better supplied with food. They were content to wait, as time held no urgency for them. The army's delay near the English settlements did not bother them as long as they had food and their families with them.|"['1.

Frank observed the Ashantis with a mix of disgust and fascination. The women worked tirelessly while the men seemed idle. The young girls were pretty, but age and hard work quickly aged them. Frank heard the guns from the English forts and learned that marines had landed. The Ashantis, led by Ammon Quatia, advanced towards Elmina. The English forces, including marines and sailors, engaged the Ashantis in battle. The Ashantis were surprised by the English firepower and retreated. Later, the Ashantis regrouped and attacked the town, but fresh reinforcements from the Barraconta sailors turned the tide. The Ashantis suffered heavy losses and retreated. Ammon Quatia decided not to face the English in open combat again.|"[""1.

After several quiet weeks, news spread of sickness among the white soldiers. Despite many being sent home, more replacements arrived. The 2nd West Indian regiment joined forces with troops from Sierra Leone, and the situation remained tense. The general informed Frank about the upcoming battle against the white men, who were expected to land near the Prah River. Ammon Quatia led fifty warriors to support the Elminas in an ambush.

During a fierce battle, Frank found himself in a perilous situation as English bullets narrowly missed him. Despite the danger, he expressed concern for his English countrymen, which puzzled the Ashanti general. Frank defended his loyalty, explaining that he would warn his own people even at the risk of his life. The general, realizing Frank's bravery, acknowledged his actions and promised to protect him better in future battles. As the wet season intensified, the suffering of the Ashantis grew due to the deadly swamp miasma. Fear spread among them about the English placing explosives in Cape Coast. The Ashanti general planned to wait for more English troops to enter the woods rather than attacking the towns directly, anticipating a strategic advantage.|"['1.

During a time of intense humidity in Africa, Frank battled a severe fever after a failed attack on Elmina. Despite his illness, Frank's resilience and ample supply of quinine helped him recover. The general praised Frank for his dedication to treating the sick soldiers, but feared releasing him due to the king's wrath. Meanwhile, English reinforcements arrived, including officers like Sir Garnet Wolseley, to aid in the conflict. Frank believed the English officers would train local troops, including Fantis, to fight effectively against the Ashantis.

The Ambriz sailed from England on September 12th, stopping at Madeira and coastal towns on the way. News of a naval disaster reached the ship in Madeira. The English government hesitated to send an expedition, but a petition from traders in Sierra Leone and Elmina highlighted the threat to the colony. Recommendations on the expedition varied widely. Some warned of the deadly climate, while others disagreed. Conflicting advice on exercise and alcohol further confused matters. Despite the warnings, the expedition landed, and clashes with the Ashanti forces ensued. The British forces faced heavy fire but managed to push the Ashantis back, inflicting casualties. The Ashantis, initially confident, were forced to retreat. The English suffered casualties, including wounded officers.

After successfully completing their mission, the British troops took a brief break before continuing their journey. They set fire to the village of Essarman, a significant location for the Ashanti people due to the large amount of gunpowder stored there. The explosions caused chaos and anger among the Ashantis, especially their general who was furious about losing two important war drums. The British forces strategically used fire to create a path through the dense bush, preventing any surprise attacks from the Ashantis. Despite the challenging terrain, the British soldiers managed to reach the coast, burning several villages along the way. They encountered resistance in the villages of Akimfoo and Ampene, with the Ashantis eventually retreating into the bush.

The Ashantis were frightened by a sudden attack and fled into the bush. Despite the chaos, Frank's guards did not forget their duty and took him with them in their escape. The Ashantis quickly regrouped and started firing at the camp. The British forces retaliated swiftly and effectively. The battle lasted for an hour and a half, with both sides exchanging heavy fire. The Ashantis fought bravely but eventually retreated. The British suffered injuries but no fatalities. The Ashantis planned to fall back but decided to attack Abra Crampa first. In a subsequent battle, the Ashantis ambushed the British forces in the bush. The British allies showed courage and resilience, but Lieutenant Wilmot was fatally wounded.

The Ashantis missed a strategic opportunity in battle against the English due to their reluctance to charge at close range. By not utilizing their numerical advantage and charging down on the English within a few yards to unleash their firepower, the Ashantis could have easily overwhelmed the English forces. The Ashantis' failure to adopt such aggressive tactics, common among savages, led to their defeat. Despite suffering immense losses and feeling dispirited, the Ashantis hesitated to retreat due to the chiefs' authority and disregard for human life. Ammon Quatia, seeking a victory before retreating, consulted with Frank on the situation. Frank advised a retreat, warning of the English's fortified defenses and the impending arrival of more troops. He urged peace negotiations to avoid further conflict and invasion by the English.|"['1.

Two days later, Frank was abruptly awakened by a loud yell. He quickly grabbed his revolver and rushed to the door, only to find a group of about twenty men attacking Ammon Quatia's hut. The two guards posted there had already been overpowered. Frank called on his four guards and Ostik to join him. Initially hesitant, the guards were inspired by Frank's courage and followed his lead. They fired their muskets at the attackers and charged with swords drawn. Ostik, armed with his sword, closely followed Frank. Frank waited until he was just two yards away from the Ashantis before firing his revolver, taking down six men. Seizing a fallen musket, he used it as a club to fight off the remaining conspirators. The sudden attack caught the conspirators off guard, and they fled into the woods as reinforcements arrived. Ammon Quatia, grateful for Frank's intervention, promised to help him return safely to his friends once the situation was under control. Shortly after, Ammon Quatia ordered the army to launch an assault on Abra Crampa, a village defended by marines, sailors, and native troops under Major Russell's command. The village was fortified with makeshift defenses, including a church turned stronghold. The garrison had been preparing for an imminent attack, as the sounds of Ashantis in the surrounding bush had been constant.|"['1.

Frank was with Ammon Quatia at the front during an attack by the Ashantis. The war drums signaled the start, followed by a powerful war song rising from the forest. The Ashantis surrounded the clearing, firing volleys with a deafening roar. The King of Abra, a tall man, taunted the Ashantis to attack. Despite attempts, the Ashantis hesitated due to the English bullets. The attack resumed at night, but the Ashantis failed to make a silent approach. They were repelled each time they tried to rush, leaving many dead. In the morning, reinforcements arrived, and the Ashantis retreated. Sir Garnet Wolseley led marines to relieve the besieged, facing exhaustion and heat. Eventually, the English forces reached the village without resistance. The Ashanti general, Ammon Quatia, acknowledged the English superiority and helped Frank escape that night as promised.|"[""1.

Frank gave the general his revolver and tin box of cartridges, hoping they wouldn't be used against the English. He packed the necklace and gold from the king, preparing for escape. The Ashanti camp was empty, and they left quietly. They reached Assaiboo safely, meeting English soldiers. Frank shared his adventures and was invited to sleep at Government House. He struggled to sleep in a bed after two years of camping. Sir Garnet asked him to guide the expedition to Coomassie, and Frank agreed to help due to his knowledge of Ashanti tactics and the terrain. He was given officer quarters and rations for himself and his servant.|"['1.

Frank decided to change into English clothing as his current attire was worn out from his travels. Luckily, he easily acquired a uniform from a departing officer. The outfit included a light brown shooting jacket, knickerbockers, and a helmet, which the officer no longer needed in England. Following this, Frank visited the agent of Messrs. Swanzy, the primary African traders on the coast, to cash one of Mr. Goodenough's orders. He settled Ostik's overdue wages and gifted him a generous sum. Despite offering Ostik the option to return to his family, the loyal servant chose to stay with Frank. Frank advised Ostik to deposit his money with the agent for safekeeping. Shortly after, Frank fell ill with fever and was cared for on the hospital ship Simoon. Upon recovery, he was invited by the captain of the Decoy gunboat to accompany him down the coast for a change of scenery. Frank accepted the offer, and they set sail, enjoying the sea breeze and engaging in conversations along the journey.|"['1.

The doctor mentioned that some who attempted experiments died due to suspected poisoning by local practitioners to protect their secrets. Frank found solace in the orderliness aboard the warship after his rugged past. The disciplined crew contrasted the noisy life Frank was accustomed to. The ship reached Accra the next day, revealing a transformed landscape. The captain and Frank disembarked in a surf boat paddled by energetic men with a unique rhythm. The boat skillfully navigated the heavy surf to land on the beach. While the captain attended to official matters, Frank explored the town with a fellow officer. Pigs roamed freely, and the streets bustled with vendors selling colorful beads, a cherished accessory among the locals.|['1.

In Africa, traders sold beads, colorful cloth, and headscarves for attire. They also offered tobacco, clay pipes, knives, mirrors, and matches. Most vendors were women selling food like dried fish, smoked fish, eggs, cooked meats, and native delicacies. Frank and his group returned to their boat with the captain near Addah village. They faced challenging surf to reach the Decoy. Despite the rough waves, they made it ashore and headed to Captain Glover's camp. Along the way, they encountered armed locals preparing for battle, with women serving as carriers. The women ensured the warriors only carried their guns until near the enemy. Despite orders against firing guns, the excitement led to shots being fired around the camp.|"['1.

The group soon reached the camp, made up of bell tents and small huts for the native people. This camp was just the starting point for the natives who were armed and sent up the river on the expedition's steamboat to a larger camp about thirty miles away. The expedition was led by seven or eight English officers, with Captain Glover in charge, assisted by Mr. Goldsworthy and Captain Sartorius. The team also included doctors and an officer of the commissariat. Despite their small numbers, they managed the training and organization of around eight to ten thousand men. The most reliable troops were the 250 Houssas and Yorabas. The officers worked tirelessly, acting as generals, colonels, and more, to maintain order and discipline. After observing the distribution of arms to newly arrived natives, the visitors watched the exciting chase to capture bullocks for the camp. Despite facing challenges, Captain Glover's expedition achieved significant success, yet their efforts were largely overlooked.|"[""1.

Captain Glover asked his guests to stay on land overnight, offering a tent, but declined due to mosquitoes. They returned to the ship. The next day, the ship set sail west. Back at Cape Coast, Frank reported for duty. Chiefs ordered able men to work as carriers. Police seized men from the streets. Some fled, causing lively chases. Excuses were futile. Men were sent upcountry. The town bustled with activity. In the castle courtyard, men carried kegs labeled “pork” on their heads. Women picked up bags of biscuit with babies seated on their bustles. Boys and girls carried kegs of rice. Children were happy to earn money and go on an adventure.|"['1.

Bullocks were brought from other coastal areas to Cape Coast to provide fresh meat for the expedition. The Ashanti army, nearly twenty thousand strong, refused to fight until they had rested. Reinforcements were sent by the king to drive the English into the sea, but tales of the white troops' strength discouraged them. Natives worked on improving the road to the Prah, making swamps passable and building huts. Troops arrived on ships like the Himalaya and Tamar, with more officers for the transport corps. Colonel Wood and Major Russell were at the Prah with native regiments. Frank and the General's staff journeyed to the front, passing through stations with huts and filters. The landscape changed as they reached Mansue, where the forest grew denser.|"['1.

Beyond Mansue, the forest was dense and dark. Climbers twisted around trees, creating intricate patterns before rooting to the ground. Ferns flourished by the roadside, while butterflies were rare, and dragonflies zipped like sparks. The road, though shady, was slippery and muddy from rain and traffic. Emerging from the forest into clearings brought relief from the oppressive atmosphere. Doves cooed monotonously, breaking the silence. Moving past Sootah, the forest's odors turned unpleasant near Fazoo, a site of conflict. The party felt joy upon reaching the open camp at Prahsue, where troops were stationed. The engineers had accomplished remarkable feats in road-building and bridging streams. Major Home and his team worked tirelessly, ensuring the expedition's success.|['1.

On January 1st, 1874, Sir Garnet Wolseley and his team, including Frank, arrived at the Prah. While waiting for the white troops to catch up, Frank had fun watching the engineers and sailors build a bridge over the river. He also visited the native regiments' camp, surprising the men with his ability to speak their language. Frank even helped translate for Captain Buller. The scouts found dead bodies along the road, revealing the Ashanti army's struggles. Strange events in Coomassie caused unrest, like a child born talking and an aerolite falling. Two days later, Frank bravely saved a soldier from an alligator, earning respect from the naval brigade. An Ashanti ambassador was impressed by English firepower, showcasing a Gatling gun. The ambassador left with a message for the king.|"['1.

On the 12th, Sir Garnet received an unsatisfactory response from Coomassie, the Ashanti capital. Mr. Kuhne, a German missionary, reported that many Ashantis had perished on their way back, with two hundred and seventy-six men carrying boxes of bones of chiefs. The army had dispersed, and the king was furious, punishing the chiefs who led the expedition. The decision for peace or war was debated fiercely among the council members, with those who knew the white man's strength advocating for peace. Meanwhile, Frank assisted Lord Gifford's scouts, aiding in the advance towards the Adansee Hills where a priest warned of an impending attack, but the British found the area deserted upon arrival. The Ashantis had fled, fearing the British advance.|"['1.

The Adansee Hills rise to about six hundred feet above sea level. Once bustling with towns and villages inhabited by the Assins, the area was abandoned due to harassment by the Ashantis. European troops could have held a strong position on the hills, advantageous for armed forces with rifles and artillery. However, the Ashantis, armed with guns firing high, posed a different challenge. The narrow crest of the hill provided a strategic viewpoint for scouts overlooking the territory of the King of Adansee. As Major Russell's regiment worked on making the road passable, scouts reported the desertion of the town of Queesa. Despite the eerie signs encountered, the debate continued on whether the Ashantis would engage in battle. Eventually, the Naval Brigade, Wood's regiment, and Rait's battery advanced towards Fomana, the capital of Adansee, revealing the unique architecture and grim remnants of the area.|"['1.

Fomana was a delightful station for the troops, situated high above the sea with cooler temperatures than stations further south. A refreshing breeze blew daily around noon, and the nights were clear with wide streets lined with trees. Two days after arriving, the remaining members of the German mission were sent by the king with a letter expressing a desire for peace. Despite this, the advance continued. Troops moved to Dompiassee and later to Quarman, preparing for a significant battle. The 42d Regiment led the attack, supported by artillery and other regiments forming a strategic plan. The battle was set for the next morning, with troops positioned to counter any flanking maneuvers by the Ashantis. The Rifle Brigade remained in reserve.|['1.

In the early morning, Major Home led the way towards the village of Agamassie, discovering only a small number of men there. Gifford scouted the Ashanti army camp across a stream behind the village. Frank, requested by Sir Garnet Wolseley, accompanied the 42d Regiment due to his knowledge of Ashanti tactics. As they advanced, they faced heavy fire but managed to push through. The battle was fierce, with the sound of gunfire filling the air. The 42d encountered challenges but continued to fight bravely. Despite confusion in the thick bush, they persevered.

After fierce fighting, the Ashantis made a final stand in the thick bush beyond the camp. The 42d Regiment faced heavy fire but managed to clear a narrow path through the dense vegetation. The Ashantis, unable to navigate the thick bush, were eventually driven out of their village. As the battle continued, the Ashantis attempted to flank our troops from the right, but a fortunate turn of events allowed us to reinforce our lines effectively. The battle raged on, with the Ashantis making a desperate attempt to retake the village. However, our troops, including the Bonny men of Wood's regiment and the Rifle Brigade, launched a successful advance, forcing the Ashantis into a full retreat. The battle ended after five and a half hours, with the Ashantis suffering heavy losses. Our casualties were relatively light, with around two hundred and fifty wounded, but most injuries were not severe.|"['1.

During the battle at one o'clock, Quarman faced a sudden attack from Ashanti warriors coming from the west. Captain Burnett led the defense with Lieutenant Jones and a small group of soldiers. Despite being outnumbered, the garrison bravely fought off the enemy, even helping to bring in much-needed supplies. The capture of Amoaful, a town with abundant food supplies, boosted the soldiers' morale. Frank, though injured, was able to enjoy a drink by the campfire. The troops, in high spirits, prepared to march towards Bequah, a town close by. Lord Gifford scouted the area and was met with enemy fire, but the soldiers successfully defeated the enemy and burned the town. The troops then advanced towards Coomassie, leaving Amoaful under the care of the 2d West Indians. The march was slow due to the need to search the area thoroughly and cross several streams.|"['1.

Before the Bonny men had advanced half a mile, they were in a heated battle, much like the one at Amoaful. Lieutenant Saunders courageously moved to the front with his weapon, using grape rounds to clear the path's sides of enemies. Unfortunately, the Bonny men refused to go further, and Lieutenant Byre was fatally injured. Lieutenant Saunders sent word that he couldn't progress without support from white troops. The Rifles then took the Bonny men's place and slowly advanced until they reached a village clearing. With a cheer, the Rifles surged through the open space, capturing the village. Meanwhile, the entire column was engaged in repelling enemy flank attacks. The Ashantis persisted in their assaults, but our troops, using a strong Snider fire, held them back. The baggage was safely transferred to the village, protected by troops along the path. The troops then closed in around the village, fending off continued enemy attacks. The Naval Brigade surprised the Ashantis with a devastating ambush, inflicting heavy casualties. The force prepared for another advance after securing the baggage. The 42d led the way, facing heavy enemy fire, but eventually overwhelming them with a rapid advance, causing the enemy to flee. The news of victory spread, halting the enemy attacks.

The troops disarmed those with guns, causing others to flee, leaving the town deserted. As darkness fell, they camped in the marketplace, once a site for sacrifices. The soldiers endured a grueling day without rest or food, scarce water, and a tough battle with hidden enemies. Despite fever and exhaustion, only a few fell out of line. That night, a fire erupted, contained by engineers. Plunderers caused chaos, resulting in a hangman's punishment and floggings. Sir Garnet sought peace, disappointed by the unrest. Exploring, Frank found cluttered, dusty homes with fetishes and signs of sacrifice. The king's palace held valuable items and traces of blood rituals. The king's bedroom revealed a dark, weapon-filled space, with a notable sword gift from Queen Victoria.|"[""1.

In the palace, chaos reigned as women scrambled to save their belongings before the impending departure. The grounds were dotted with whitewashed mounds marking graves, creating a somber atmosphere.

The troops, relieved at the change of plan, prepared for the journey. As the town went up in flames, Major Home and his team readied the palace for detonation.

The journey across the bridge was slow and difficult. Some planks were missing, so each person had to move cautiously. By 5 p.m., it was clear that the white troops couldn't all cross before nightfall. The river was rising, and it was crucial not to leave anyone behind in case of an Ashanti attack. Sir Archibald Alison ordered the troops to strip down to helmets and guns and wade across. Clothes were carried by swimming natives. One soldier forgot his clothes and had to spend the night in a blanket, causing laughter the next day. Frank decided to head straight to the coast, saying goodbye to friends. He traveled by hammock to Cape Coast and then to England, leaving his friend Ostik behind. The Houssas who escaped made it to the coast safely.
