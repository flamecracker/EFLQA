Once upon a time, there was a boy named Diamond who lived in a small loft above a coach-house. The room was quite drafty, with old boards that allowed the north wind to sneak in. Despite the cold, Diamond found comfort in his bed made of hay, nestled among the trusses stacked to the roof. Sometimes, the hay would create a maze-like path to his bed, and other times, it would form a cozy wall around him. Diamond's makeshift cork to block the wind was no match for the persistent gusts that kept blowing it away. Despite the howling wind, Diamond found solace in his warm bed, feeling like the happiest boy in the world as he drifted off to sleep.|"['1.

Diamond was so engrossed in building a cave by the fire with a broken chair and a blanket that he forgot about a hole in the wall. His mother covered it with brown paper. That night, as the wind howled, Diamond heard a voice. He realized it came from the wall where the paper was. A cold draft made him hide under the covers. The voice, resembling his mother's, spoke kindly. Suddenly, a strong gust blew away the covers, revealing a woman's face with dark eyes and flowing hair. Diamond was captivated by her beauty. The lady's hair gathered back around her, and she disappeared with the wind. Diamond, not yet wise, reached out to her, but she vanished.|"['1.

Diamond hesitated for a moment as he rounded the corner of the hay. The stair leading down to the door was dark, filled with North Wind's hair as she descended before him. Next to him, the ladder led straight down to the stable where his father fetched hay for Diamond's dinner. The stable lantern's faint gleam tempted him. As he descended, he remembered the stable door was locked. Diamond the horse poked his head out of the box, recognizing boy Diamond in his nightgown, wanting his ears pulled. After a gentle moment, boy Diamond remembered Lady North Wind awaited him in the yard. It's always disappointing to think someone's waiting and find no one. Diamond's heart sank as the grand face of the North Wind was gone. He stood barefoot in the paved yard, feeling let down.|"['1.

It was a cloudless night, and the stars sparkled above. Orion stood out with his bright belt and golden sword. However, the moon was just a thin crescent. A lone dark cloud loomed in the sky, its steep side resembling a cliff. The moon, perched on this edge, seemed as though she had fallen from the cloud-hill, awaiting her descent into a pit. Diamond, feeling like he had entered Fairyland, gazed at the peculiar sight. The chilly wind pricked his skin as he ventured towards the kitchen-garden. Remembering Lady North Wind's words about coldness, he turned and felt the wind guiding him towards a door in the wall. Passing through, he crossed the shrubbery into Mr. Coleman's lawn, searching for Lady North Wind, hoping she wasn't upset with him.|"['1.

In the night, Diamond found himself standing alone on the lawn, his night-gown fluttering in the wind. Uncertain if he was dreaming, he gazed at the stars shining above. Feeling a bit scared, he pondered whether to cry or not. As the light from a window in Mr. Coleman's house comforted him, he watched it until it nearly went out, leaving him feeling utterly alone. Overwhelmed, he burst into tears, feeling the loneliness of the night. Fortunately, the old nurse, Mrs. Crump, noticed him and led him back inside.

Diamond's mother had to rise from bed to answer the door when Mrs. Crump knocked. She was surprised to see her and took Diamond back to bed. Diamond woke early, pondering his strange dream. The memory felt real, making him question if he was truly outside in the wind. He decided if his mother knew Mrs. Crump brought him home, she would mention it. After dressing, he sneaked to the stable. Climbing on old Diamond's back, he startled the horse. Old Diamond lifted him gently back to the saddle. Diamond watched as the horse ate, contemplating how to dismount. His mother, worried to find his bed empty, bravely lifted him off Diamond's back. She carried him back to bed, keeping silent to not alarm him. Diamond spent the week indoors due to the frosty weather until he finally ventured out at sunset, marveling at the sky's beauty.|"[""1.

As Diamond gazed at the vibrant colors, the gates swung open, revealing old Diamond and his friend in the carriage, eager to reach their stalls. Diamond, careful not to disrupt the grand spectacle, stepped aside as his father drove past. Recalling a dream, he ventured through the shrubbery to find a lone primrose, a delicate marvel. Mesmerized, he felt it was whispering prayers to the sky. Later, as his father prepared Diamond's bed, the father spoke softly, guarding family matters. Diamond, recalling North Wind's visit, tore off a paper covering a hole in the wall. A young girl appeared, followed by North Wind's laughter.

North Wind, now as tall as a full-grown girl, took Diamond's hand, leading him swiftly across the garden. With graceful bounds, they reached the top of the wall and then stood by the river, full tide and stars reflecting in its calm waters. As they walked along, ripples formed, and the stars vanished. North Wind's hair flew in the breeze as they ran through a narrow lane. Suddenly, a wolf appeared, causing Diamond to fear for the safety of the children in the house they passed.

North Wind, with laughter in her voice, recounted a mischievous encounter where she had to take the form of a wolf to be seen by a girl. As they ascended Primrose Hill, North Wind's form and hair expanded towards the stars. She wove a nest in her hair, allowing Diamond to find safety within it. Rising into the sky, North Wind soared above the earth, carrying Diamond in a woven nest. Looking down, Diamond saw the world rushing past, with animals and buildings becoming a blur below.

Diamond, a young boy, found himself high above the ground in a nest, carried by the powerful North Wind. Looking down, he saw houses rushing past like rocks in a torrent. The sky was hidden by the lady's hair. Diamond wondered if she could hear him. As they descended, he gazed at the lonely streets below. Suddenly, he noticed a little girl struggling against the wind, her broom causing trouble. North Wind assured Diamond that things would be alright. As they landed, Diamond was almost blown away by the fierce wind. North Wind transformed into a tall lady and set him down.

Diamond and the girl walked together, feeling tired and lost in a desolate area. Despite Diamond's doubts about being helpful, the girl was glad to have him by her side. As they approached a garden, a strong gust of wind blew them down a slope towards a door in the garden's wall. The door burst open, revealing the garden.

Diamond and North Wind found themselves in the midst of a fierce chaos, surrounded by flashes of light and peals of thunder. Despite the chaos around them, it felt as though they were standing still at the center.

She believed the song had the power to swallow up fear and pain, turning them into singing. Diamond, however, doubted it would help those in distress. North Wind assured him that the song was growing louder and nearer, bringing comfort and peace. As they approached a cathedral, Diamond was struck with awe at its grandeur.

Diamond stood at the edge, afraid to move. A gentle breeze brushed his face, easing his fear. With each soft puff of wind, his courage returned. Encouraged, he walked along the narrow ledge towards a little open door. Descending a broad stairway, he found himself in the arms of North Wind. Nestled in her embrace, Diamond pondered on courage. He realized that trying to be brave was the beginning of bravery. North Wind explained how her breath had the power to make him strong. The church was dark, lit only by faint starlight filtering through stained glass windows. Feeling the church embrace him, Diamond explored the echoing space. Though he wanted to sing, the loneliness silenced him. Instead, he listened to the echoes of his footsteps in the vast church.|"[""1.

Diamond was exhausted and hurt his arm, but he kept crawling up the steps until he reached a soft carpet at the top. There, he gazed at a dull window high above him. Unaware that the moonlight was casting the window's colors, he thought figures like St. John and St. Paul were coming to help him. As his eyes grew heavy, he tried to stay awake, but eventually fell asleep. In his dream, he imagined hearing whispers and felt the presence of the Apostles around him. They discussed North Wind's actions, blaming her for leaving Diamond there. Despite his efforts, Diamond couldn't open his eyes to defend North Wind, whom he knew wouldn't play such tricks.|"['1.

Diamond woke up in his hay-filled loft, realizing the people he thought were Apostles were actually sextons and vergers pretending to be grand. Angered by their disrespect for North Wind, Diamond defended her, knowing she had a purpose. As he got up, he imagined his horse, Old Diamond, shaking himself awake. Diamond then discovered the aftermath of a fierce windstorm, with the summer-house destroyed and the elm tree fallen. Reflecting on the damage caused by the North Wind, Diamond wished they lived on the sheltered side. The clergyman comforted Diamond, but he was determined to ask North Wind to take him to the country she had mentioned before.|['1.

When Diamond returned home for breakfast, he found his parents already eating. His mother observed him closely and remarked on his elaborate preparations as if he were embarking on a long voyage. Diamond's journey to the sleepy old town, abandoned by the sea, was uneventful. His aunt met him at the station and safely escorted him to his destination. The town, once a bustling seaport, had fallen into a slumber due to its arrogance towards the sea. Diamond explored the quaint streets and shops with his large eyes, marveling at the deserted town. As he visited a toy shop with his remaining pocket money, he encountered a mysterious windmill toy that seemed to move on its own, surprising him with its unexpected voice.|"[""1.

North Wind spoke to Diamond, asking what he wanted with a big voice. She mentioned breaking some toys and advised Diamond to go home as he didn't seem well. Diamond's aunt gave him lemonade, and he felt refreshed, laying his head down to sleep. Suddenly, the wind blew the lattice open, and Diamond found himself surrounded by North Wind's hair. She warned him about trying to understand things beyond his grasp. North Wind mentioned a captain friend with a yacht and shared how she had helped him sail. Diamond listened, learning about the wonders of the wind and the sea.|"['1.

North Wind explained to Diamond that he must help the captain sail his ship, even though he felt he couldn't do as much as South Wind. North Wind emphasized the importance of not doing everything for loved ones without giving them a share in the effort. North Wind pointed out that without his help, the captain wouldn't be able to sail at all. He assured Diamond that he would blow him north on the ship, ensuring they reach their destination safely.

Many hours passed as Diamond lay on the vessel, feeling neither tired nor impatient. The sounds of the ship's movements, the wind, and the waves filled him with a strange joy. As they sailed towards a distant country, the North Wind's music surrounded him, keeping him from tiring. Eventually, the weather worsened, and Diamond was lifted out of the vessel as a hatch blew off. North Wind carried him to a larger German ship bound for the North Pole, where she hid him among the flags. They sailed through icy waters, and Diamond marveled at the strange light of the midnight sun. North Wind led him to an iceberg cave, where he sat in awe of the dazzling blue air, but noticed her weary appearance.|"[""1.

Diamond was on a floating iceberg, feeling faint due to the South Wind blowing on him. He was with North Wind, who started to vanish, her form dissolving into light. She assured Diamond not to worry and to continue straight ahead. North Wind's face faded away, leaving only her eyes in the ice. Diamond trusted her and sat listening to the water around the iceberg. He then saw a shining peak on the horizon, towards which his iceberg was heading. As they approached, the peak revealed itself as part of a mountain range leading to a bay surrounded by steep cliffs with snow and ice. The iceberg gently docked, and Diamond, without looking back, followed a path up the cliff.|"['1.

When Diamond ventured to the back of the North Wind, he found himself on a vast ice plateau, with towering icy structures in the distance. The air was frigid and still, adding to the eerie atmosphere. As he approached what seemed like a valley entrance, he discovered a woman seated against the ice, resembling a figure from an ancient temple. She had a pale face, blue eyes like the ice cave air, and hair as straight as icicles, wearing a greenish robe. Diamond, believing her to be North Wind, reached out to touch her but felt only intense cold. As he continued, the whiteness enveloped him, numbing his senses until he fainted. It was in North Wind's heart that he lost consciousness and tumbled over the threshold, arriving at the back of the North Wind. Despite Diamond's difficulty in recounting his experiences due to the stark differences in the otherworldly place he visited, the essence of his journey remained captivating and mysterious.|"['1.

Two people, Durante and a young peasant girl, had unique experiences in a mysterious country. Durante, an Italian noble, described entering through scorching fire, while the young girl fell asleep in a wood and woke there. Durante found a sweet-smelling land with a gentle wind and a river full of flowers. He claimed it always felt like May there. The girl, Kilmeny, spoke of a land without sin, sun, or night. She described a place of love and light, where a river swayed like a living stream. Durante and Kilmeny's accounts aligned, though Kilmeny's lack of experience hindered her description. Another person, Diamond, found himself at the back of the north wind, where the river sang tunes in people's heads.

When Diamond wanted to know about his loved ones, he had to climb a tree, sit in its branches, and keep still. From there, he could catch glimpses of what was happening with the people he cared about. One day, he saw his mother crying and longed to return home. His wish was to find North Wind, who could help him. Diamond believed she must be somewhere, either waiting for him or on a mission. Determined to reunite with his mother, he searched for North Wind every day. The tree he climbed was magical, allowing each person to be invisible to others while in it. One day, as Diamond looked towards home, he saw icebergs, mountains, and meadows below.

North Wind was calm when Diamond approached her. Her face, once pale as snow, started to change as he touched her, awakening her from a deep slumber. Light sparkled in her blue eyes. With the help of nearby stones, Diamond climbed up beside her, feeling her cold bosom warm as she embraced him tightly. Suddenly, she fully awoke, explaining that time inside her realm differs from the outside world. In an instant, Diamond found himself alone as North Wind disappeared. A small insect-like creature circled him, eventually growing into a weasel, then a cat, and further into a jaguar and finally a Bengal tiger. Unafraid, Diamond watched the tiger vanish into the distance, deciding to slow his pace near the icy cliffs, reflecting on his extraordinary journey with North Wind.|['1.

Diamond, a curious boy, recognized the creatures from a picture book and conversed with North Wind, who he mistook for a tiger. As they flew southwards, the sea shimmered beneath them, and the stars seemed to sail overhead. Diamond fell asleep in North Wind's arms and awoke to his mother's tearful embrace. His mother, aware of his weakness from lack of food, urged him to rest. Meanwhile, Miss Coleman's poor health was attributed to her weak lungs, a past hurtful relationship, and lack of purpose.

North Wind was very active the night she left Diamond at the cathedral. She blew through the Coleman's house, causing chaos. Miss Coleman's maid left a window open, leading to her mistress falling ill. The ship Mr. Coleman owned sank, worsening his financial troubles. North Wind aimed to make Mr. Coleman an honest man, sinking his ship to end his dishonest ventures. The consequences rippled through the Colemans and beyond. Miss Coleman's lover was on the sunken ship, adding to the tragedy. The elm-tree North Wind blew down crushed Miss Coleman's summer-house, symbolizing the collapse of the Coleman family's life.

Diamond remembered a lesson from his father about nature's provisions for birds in winter. His mother, reflecting on a church message, realized the importance of living in the present.

Early in the morning, a young boy rose to the sounds of activity in the yard. He ensured his little brother was safely tucked in bed before venturing out, leaving the door ajar in case his brother needed their mother. Making his way to the stable, he silently harnessed Diamond, the old horse, without seeking assistance to avoid any objections. Despite the challenges, he managed to saddle Diamond with great care. The men in the yard observed in silence, eager to see his progress. As the boy led Diamond out, the men watched with admiration.

Diamond's mother pondered the angels and their whimsical ways, more focused on the dinner for her ailing husband. Diamond, curious and innocent, mused about the angels' enchanting nonsense. He likened it to the joy of a little nonsense, akin to pepper and salt in soup. As he chattered, his words brought solace to his parents. Later, drifting into sleep, Diamond dreamt of a vast garden with blooming roses and enchanting flowers, a place unlike any he had ever seen. Lost in this dreamworld, he wandered through the wild landscape until he found himself under a rose-bush, where he peacefully dozed off, leaving the mystery of the angels' nonsensical songs still lingering in his thoughts.|"[""1.

"Diamond woke up, not from his dream, but within it, hearing a child's voice calling his name, ""Diamond, Diamond!"" Startled, he rose, but everything was quiet around him. The fragrance of the rose bushes filled the air, with the scent resembling the color of the roses, creating a mist that blended with the rosy vapor hanging over the wilderness. The voice called out again, seemingly from above him. Looking up, Diamond saw the deep blue sky filled with brilliant stars, closer and brighter than ever. As he continued to gaze at a twinkling star, it vanished, revealing a merry face with bright eyes. The voice called out once more, urging Diamond to descend a moss-covered stair that appeared before him. Without hesitation, Diamond descended the soft and cool stair, guided by a bubbling stream that climbed the steps to meet him, creating a cheerful melody. Diamond followed the stream until it led him to a stone that shook with its force, allowing him to escape through an opening into a grassy hill. There, he was greeted by a group of naked boys with tiny wings fluttering on their shoulders, who joyfully embraced and kissed him, filling Diamond's heart with pure happiness."|"[""1.

"""Let's have some fun!"" exclaimed one of the angels, and they scattered around, playing joyfully on the grassy hills with Diamond at the center of their amusement. Each angel returned with tools, led by the captain to a different part of the hill. The atmosphere shifted as they began digging for stars, each angel engrossed in their own search. Some found small stars, while others discovered larger ones that gleamed with brilliant colors. The angels celebrated each find with excitement, dancing and fluttering around the uncovered star. Diamond was allowed the first peek through the star-holes, witnessing familiar yet wondrous sights that filled him with overwhelming joy. Finally, one angel unearthed a unique star of a color never seen before. Instead of showing it off, he handed it to a neighbor, then leaped headfirst through the star-hole, disappearing from view. The captain shared a tale about angels similar to them, who visit the stars after they are discovered, preserving their brilliance. As the angels grew sleepy, the captain hinted at the mysterious angels' role in their slumber, leaving Diamond to wonder about the magical world beyond the star-holes."|"['1.

As he spoke, he dropped his spade and fell asleep. The others followed, each dropping their tools and dozing off. Despite his efforts, Diamond struggled to stay awake, feeling the drowsiness creeping over him. He fought to keep his eyes open, glimpsing a faint light on the hill before succumbing to sleep. Upon waking, he found the angels awake and joyful, singing as they worked. Diamond tried to remember their nonsensical songs but struggled as he fully awoke, losing the verses. The next morning, Diamond, relieved of his mother's worry, openly went to work.

Diamond, a cabman, was feeling cold despite his mother helping him with his coat and comforter. He refused to get inside his cab, believing a cabman should not mind the weather. He was called to take a young woman with a heavy box to Wapping, a rough area near the river. As he dropped off the passenger, some troublemakers tried to take her fare. A man, Mr. Evans, intervened, driving them off. Diamond recognized Mr. Evans as the one who was to marry Miss Coleman.

In a grand palace near a magnificent wood, a beautiful baby named Daylight brought joy to the king and queen. Little did they know that a wicked witch disguised as a neighbour lurked in the nearby forest, seeking to cause mischief. Fairies, who traditionally bestowed gifts upon royal babies, were cautious of the witch's presence. At Daylight's christening, the fairies granted her extraordinary gifts, hoping to counteract any harm the witch might intend. Despite the wicked fairy's attempts, history had shown that even her curses could lead to unexpected blessings. Just like the tale of The Sleeping Beauty, where a princess's long slumber protected her until the right prince awakened her, sometimes seemingly unfortunate events could turn out for the best. Fairies, with their inherent powers, always found a way to bring about good in the end.|"['1.

The wicked fairy, uninvited, cursed the child to sleep all day and be awake all night, tied to the moon's phases. The royal family faced sleepless nights, caring for Daylight. She would bloom under the full moon but wither as it waned, resembling a sickly child. Her laughter echoed through the palace, but her condition saddened the household. They learned to anticipate her cycles, reviving her with the moon's return. Daylight's health fluctuated, and she thrived under the moonlight but suffered in its absence.

For a long time, only a few people witnessed the princess awake. As she grew older, she became a favorite, and some around the palace stayed up at night to be close to her. She often escaped her nurses to enjoy the moonlight alone. This continued until she was nearly seventeen. Her parents had grown accustomed to the unusual situation, adjusting everything around the Princess Daylight. She was stunning, with sunny hair and beautiful blue eyes, but as the moon waned, she aged rapidly. She looked exhausted and frail, with a hunger in her eyes. She disliked being seen during this time. One summer evening, she vanished and was found asleep in the forest. Near the palace, there was a green glade where she spent most of her time. She retreated further into the woods as the moon waned, making it hard to find her. Nearby, a prince disguised as a peasant sought refuge after fleeing an insurrection in a neighboring kingdom.|['Question 1:\nWhy did some people stay up at night around the palace?\nA) To escape their nurses\nB) To enjoy the moonlight alone\nC) To find the princess\nD) To witness the insurrection\nE) To adjust everything around the princess', 'Question 2:\nHow did the princess appear as the moon waned?\nA) Exhausted and frail\nB) Strong and vibrant\nC) Younger and happier\nD) Disguised as a peasant\nE) Angry and rebellious', 'Question 3:\nWhat did the princess dislike during her rapid aging?\nA) Being seen\nB) Escaping her nurses\nC) Spending time in the forest\nD) Enjoying the moonlight alone\nE) Being close to the palace', 'Question 4:\nWhere was the princess found asleep one summer evening?\nA) In the palace\nB) In the neighboring kingdom\nC) In the forest\nD) In the green glade\nE) In the moonlight', 'Question 5:\nWhere did the princess spend most of her time near the palace?\nA) In the insurrection\nB) In the neighboring kingdom\nC) In the moonlight\nD) In the forest\nE) In the green glade', 'Question 6:\nWho sought refuge near the palace after fleeing an insurrection?\nA) A princess disguised as a peasant\nB) The nurses of the princess\nC) The parents of the princess\nD) A prince disguised as a peasant\nE) The people witnessing the princess awake']|['B) To enjoy the moonlight alone', 'A) Exhausted and frail', 'A) Being seen', 'C) In the forest', 'E) In the green glade', 'D) A prince disguised as a peasant']
Once upon a time, a prince found himself lost in a vast forest. Hungry and tired, he stumbled upon a small, magical house where a kind old woman, who was actually a good fairy, welcomed him with bread and milk. The prince was amazed by the delicious meal and the strength it gave him. The fairy offered him a place to stay for the night, but the prince, unaccustomed to such kindness, felt a bit offended and walked away. As the prince continued his journey, he reached a beautiful open grassy area under the moonlight. There, he saw a mysterious girl in white dancing and singing like a nightingale. Mesmerized by her beauty and music, the prince watched in awe, afraid to disturb her. The magical encounter left him both enchanted and curious about the mysteries of the forest.|"['1.

The prince lay for a long time, questioning if the princess was real or just a creation of his imagination. Could she be a spirit of the woods? He considered forsaking his kingdom to dwell in the forest near her, building a hut to catch a glimpse of her enchanting presence. As he dreamed of her returning under the moonlight, she suddenly arose, singing and dancing gracefully before disappearing into the distance. Despite his eagerness, he fell asleep. Upon awakening, he searched for any sign of her presence but found none. Encountering a charming house in the woods, he learned it belonged to Princess Daylight.

The prince anxiously waited for the princess to approach his hiding spot that night. As the moon rose, her dance expanded to encompass the entire glade, drawing her closer to the trees where he concealed himself. Enthralled by her beauty, he watched her all night without daring to approach. Overwhelmed by her loveliness, he couldn't tear his eyes away from her. As the moon set, she retreated in smaller circles until she vanished from his sight. Exhausted, he made his way to the old woman's cottage just in time for breakfast. After a long rest, he set out again, worried he might miss seeing the princess. Unfortunately, he lost his way, causing him great distress. When the princess finally appeared in her radiant attire, he was relieved, and his troubles melted away.|"['1.

The prince managed to see the princess three times before the swamp-fairy noticed him. The fairy believed the princess was too proud for any man to approach her without seeing her at least six times. However, the princess was also afraid of the wrong prince. The bad fairy used deceitful spells to prevent the prince from finding the princess. After days of searching, the prince finally found the fairy's cottage, but the princess never appeared. One moonless night, he overheard the princess's attendants discussing her disappearance. Determined to find her, he lit a fire to guide her back. Following a vague circle, he discovered an old woman near a birch tree.

As the prince neared the door, feeling exhausted beyond belief, he saw a frail old woman who suddenly sprang to her feet with the grace of a young maiden. The morning light revealed her radiant face and deep blue eyes, stunning the prince with awe. He realized he had rescued Daylight herself from the forest. Overwhelmed, he knelt before her until she touched his head, then rose in reverence. The children, enchanted by the tale, eagerly awaited more stories from Mr. Raymond. Diamond, bidding farewell to Nanny, left with Mr. Raymond. The kind man had plans for Diamond and Nanny, wanting to test them first. As they walked, Mr. Raymond pondered their future, discussing with Diamond the challenges Nanny might face once she left the care of the sick children's home.

I wandered away, not knowing where I was headed, but drawn by the warmth. Eventually, I reached a street atop a hill. Surprisingly, a house with both its front and back doors open revealed a moonlit garden inside. Entranced, I kicked off my dirty shoes, ran barefoot through the house, and onto the grass, feeling instantly better in the moonlight. The moon fought off crapey clouds, shining brighter each time. Diamond remarked on the moon's beauty, calling it the only worthwhile sight at night. Nanny recalled Mr. Raymond's story of Princess Daylight, highlighting the moon's resilience against the clouds. Despite the clouds' persistence, the moon's radiance prevailed, proving that sometimes the most beautiful things are indeed true and good.|"['1.

Nanny and Diamond shared dreams about the stars, with Nanny wondering if the moon had gone to fetch her. Diamond described a dream where a little man showed him a house in the air with many windows. The man told Diamond his job was to keep the windows clean, even those looking into mysterious places. Diamond asked how to clean the outside, and the man said there were ladders. The man hinted at his age and asked if Diamond had seen the man in the moon, to which Diamond replied he had only seen the bundle of sticks on the moon's back.

He chuckled, but I sensed a hint of offense in his expression. His small nose pointed upwards, and his mouth curved downwards towards his neck, not in anger, though. “Oh, yes!” he exclaimed, “That's all nonsense. What you saw were my dusters. I was about to clean the windows. It requires quite a few, you know. People down there say peculiar things about their superiors!” “It's because they lack knowledge,” I suggested. “Exactly, exactly,” he agreed. “No one truly knows better. I forgive them, and that makes it right, I hope.” “That's very kind of you,” I remarked. “No,” he replied, “it's not kindness. I couldn't be at ease otherwise.” Then, after a pause, he asked, “Are you finished?” “Finished with what?” I inquired. “Finished with your prayers,” he stated. “I wasn't praying,” I clarified. “Oh, yes, you were,” he insisted, “even if you didn't realize it! Now, I must show you something else.” He held my hand and guided me down the stairs, through narrow passages, one after another.

The weather was hot, and the woods were shadowy. As autumn approached, the wildflowers were scarce, having bloomed early to catch the sun. Diamond found solace lying in the grass near the house, breathing fresh air. He often dreamed of the country behind the north wind, recalling the river's songs. Although he no longer drove the cab, Diamond helped his father in the stable and harness-room. Mr. Raymond advised giving Diamond freedom, which made him happy. Living at The Mound, Diamond was employed as a page. His room had a lovely view of green leaves and a squirrel in the treetops. Diamond's mistress encouraged him to read and study. One evening, a tutor visiting Mr. Raymond saw Diamond reading a fairy book under a beech tree.|"['1.

As Diamond sang, darkness enveloped us. A sudden lightning flash left us momentarily blinded. Dulcimer, Diamond's little brother, delighted in the lightning but cried out in fear at the thunder. Nanny and Jim rushed over, pale with fright. Diamond, however, looked pale but thrilled. The splendor seemed to linger on his face. A tree nearby was struck by lightning, and a massive bough fell to the ground. A gust of wind followed by pouring rain prompted Diamond, Nanny, and Jim to seek shelter.

There was no one in the room. Another door was rattling, belonging to a closet he couldn't open. The wind must shake it. He decided to check. The door opened easily, revealing a long, narrow room lit by the moon. Delighted, he danced as the wind blew in. He felt as if he could fly. Suddenly, he saw North Wind, dancing with him. They danced together until she whisked him out the window to a beech-tree. There, she cradled him like a baby. He didn't want to sleep and lose the moment.

North Wind, a mystical character, appeared at Diamond's window, taking him on a magical journey. They floated over a moonlit landscape, with North Wind's hair and clothes billowing behind her. As they descended to an earthy hill with a bubbling spring, North Wind glided Diamond close to the stream's surface. The brook's song seemed to narrate its life story, changing from a tinkle to a rush. They followed the brook to a river, then to a lake with water-lilies, and watched fishes asleep among the roots. North Wind then led Diamond through a clover field and a garden of sleeping roses and lilies. The river widened, passing boats and grand houses with lawns submerged in its waters. The serene journey ended as Diamond observed the tranquil scene below, with people in the houses fast asleep.|"[""1.
