In the past, marriages were often arranged without the initial spark of love, but it could develop over time. The Norman knights and barons were considered more refined compared to the Saxon franklins. The Saxon women, influenced by courteous manners, learned to accept their fate and even found contentment in their marriages to Norman knights. While some women suffered from the harshness of their lords, many adapted to their new lives, finding joy in activities like hunting and riding with their husbands. Mixed marriages helped unite the people, bridging the gap between Normans and Saxons. Cuthbert, a young man with connections to both sides, navigated the complexities of loyalty and kinship during a time of tension between outlaws and the ruling Normans.|['1.

Cuthbert, frozen in place, decided to race to his friends for help. He knew the forest well and reached his outlaw friends deep in its shades. They quickly agreed to rescue Margaret.

In the late afternoon, they spotted Evesham Castle, with armed men riding towards it. The party had just returned from the woods, learning of the Earl's daughter's disappearance and her attendants' fate. As they neared the gate, the Earl, surrounded by knights, rode out and his daughter leaped into his arms. Amid the chaos, Cuthbert explained the situation, enraging the Earl at the Baron of Wortham's actions. The Earl promised the outlaws freedom in Evesham Chase and pledged to help them. The next day, the Earl asked Cuthbert to invite the outlaws to join forces against the Baron. After discussions, the outlaws agreed to aid. The castle buzzed with activity, preparing for the assault on Wortham Castle. Cuthbert was allowed to watch but not to fight. The force set out the next morning, a mix of knights, men-at-arms, retainers, and forest men, ready to attack Wortham. The forest men, skilled archers, planned to fight under Cnut's guidance.

On the day the baron's attempt to kidnap the earl's daughter failed, he realized that a conflict was unavoidable. Swift messengers were dispatched to seek aid from the baron's allies in Gloucester, Hereford, Stafford, and Oxford. Some barons sympathized with the baron's cause, viewing the Earl of Evesham's leniency towards the Saxons as a mistake. The castle was well-defended, with strong fortifications and archers on the keep. Cuthbert, perched in a tree, pondered the challenges of attacking such a stronghold. The foresters engaged in a skirmish to distract the defenders. Despite capturing the outwork, the assailants faced a barrage of projectiles from the castle walls.

My mother believed important work was happening at the castle, but the baron kept it secret. Rumors suggested the masons were creating hidden passages, and those involved mysteriously disappeared. Cuthbert, with a forester's help, found a concealed entrance in the woods near the castle. They discovered a hidden passage covered by ivy. Cuthbert proposed informing the earl discreetly to avoid alerting the enemy. Cnut, appreciating the discovery, decided not to inform the earl immediately, planning to use the secret passage strategically during an attack.

In the early hours before dawn, Cuthbert joined Cnut and a group of skilled foresters armed with crowbars and axes to enter the copse.

Cnut led the way upstairs, followed by the foresters, Cuthbert, allowing several men to come between him and the leader. He carried a short sword and a quarterstaff, a useful weapon in skilled hands. About thirty or forty men were gathered, occupied with shooting crossbows and launching javelins and stones at the besiegers. The soldiers of the Baron of Wortham were taken by surprise when the foresters suddenly attacked from the keep. The defenders had been doing well until then, puzzled by the feeble assault. The baron, surprised by the turn of events, rushed to the keep upon hearing it was captured. A fierce conflict ensued, leading to the baron's demise.

The King of England was already in Normandy rushing the preparations, and each group, as it arrived, marched to the gathering spot on the plains of Vezelay. They were starting to feel the challenges they would face. The English soldiers were marching through a friendly area, so looting was strictly forbidden. However, some leaders paid for what they took, while others helped themselves without paying. The sparse population struggled to provide for the large number of men passing through, leaving even the Earl of Evesham without supper at times. Upon reaching the vast camp at Vezelay, nearly 100,000 men were gathered. The camp was like a town with tents of leaders forming streets and squares.

Cnut and Cuthbert bravely fought off their attackers, but the assailants were too powerful. Cnut was knocked down, and Cuthbert, realizing he couldn't defend himself, ran for safety.

Cuthbert agreed with the prior's plan to escape the city walls openly. The monks brainstormed ways to get him out safely. Disguises were risky due to close scrutiny by the guards.

Cnut faced a challenging task, admitting that keeping watch during the day was impossible. However, he proposed a plan for his band of skilled men to stealthily track the baron at night. Little Jack, despite his size, possessed exceptional skills in shooting, running, and combat. Cnut trusted Jack to vigilantly guard the tent, ensuring no one entered or left unnoticed. Three days later, Cnut reported that a group of five men met in the tent each night, with one standing guard outside. The earl and his page strategized to monitor the baron's movements discreetly.

On the ship carrying the Earl of Evesham's group, there was order and discipline. The earl quickly gave commands as the wind picked up, directing most men below deck and leaving a few on deck to assist. The ship was prepared for the storm, with flags and shields secured. With only a small amount of sail raised, the ship sped through the rough waters. The captain and his crew worked to navigate the storm, avoiding collisions with other ships. As the storm raged on, the ship eventually ran aground near the coast of Africa. Despite the danger, they managed to steer through the breakers and avoid immediate destruction. The crew rested as darkness fell, and in the morning, they saw a town in the distance with ships approaching. Prepared for a fight, they braced themselves to defend against potential attackers.|"['1.

Cuthbert, a young knight held captive, found a glimmer of hope when a mysterious lady showed interest in him. She arranged secret meetings with him, leading him to a room where a lady, surrounded by slaves, listened to his story. The lady was intrigued by his bravery and wanted to understand the Christian world's motives for launching armies against them. Cuthbert shared tales of his adventures and home life, which fascinated his audience. The lady, impressed by Cuthbert's demeanor, sought ways to lighten his captivity. Through a series of clandestine messages, she planned his escape to a country palace. However, the guards grew suspicious, and Cuthbert was abruptly seized, gagged, and taken away on a horse by the governor's men.

Cuthbert found himself in a predicament. Just hours ago, he had hope for freedom, but now he was being taken towards a life of probable slavery. Although he couldn't understand his captors, he gathered that he was bound for Egypt as a gift for a high-ranking official. He suspected the Governor of Jerusalem feared his escape, prompting this transfer. As the journey progressed through the desert, Cuthbert observed the camels closely. He identified the swiftest one, determined that it was his ticket to freedom. Each evening, the camels were tethered, and the Arabs relaxed around a fire. Cuthbert planned his escape, waiting for the right moment. One night, he seized the opportunity, quietly mounting the chosen camel and riding off into the darkness undetected.|"[""1.

Cuthbert relied on the stars to guide him as he made his escape. He armed himself with a spear, bow and arrows, and a bag of dates from the Arabs' belongings. Dressed in Eastern attire and tanned from the sun, he rode through the night, confident he had a head start. By morning, he saw no sign of pursuit behind him. As he entered cultivated lands, he disguised himself as an Arab and rode boldly ahead. Passing villagers with the customary greeting, he continued his journey without pause. By nightfall, he rested near a wood, exhausted but safe from his pursuers. The next day, he was captured by a different group of Arabs who discovered his true identity. Despite his efforts to feign muteness, they bound him and rode towards the Dead Sea, away from Jerusalem. Cuthbert realized they were desert nomads loosely allied with Suleiman's forces.|"['1.

Near their own country, the group of travelers gathered dead wood from the shore and lit a fire. They cooked grain in an earthenware pot, using water from a skin. Cuthbert, tired and sore from his camel ride, asked to bathe in a nearby lake. The Arabs, curious as few could swim, allowed it. Cuthbert, unfamiliar with the Dead Sea's properties, was surprised to find himself buoyant due to the saltiness. Despite initial shock, he swam and felt refreshed. When the Arabs offered him food, he gratefully accepted. Later, while the Arabs slept, Cuthbert escaped into the hills.

Cuthbert was filled with joy at the thought of returning to an active life. The next evening, he knelt before the old hermit to receive his blessing. He showed a unique beaded rosette to a peasant, who recognized it as a token from Father Anselm and welcomed Cuthbert. The peasant provided Cuthbert with shepherd attire and dyed his skin to blend in. Together, they journeyed to a Christian community on a mountain, sustained by goats' milk, cheese, and vegetables. Cuthbert was warmly received. The next morning, guided by the peasant, he moved on to another community in a narrow gorge overlooking the plain and the distant sea. This community was prosperous, with vineyards and olive groves. The village head shared details about the Christian army's struggles against the Saracens.

Cuthbert had been riding at a gentle pace until he heard a challenge. In response, he spurred his horse and raced across the plain at full speed. The Arabs, with a wild yell, started to pursue him.

Richard, filled with anger, struck the Austrian, causing a tense moment where swords were almost drawn. The Austrians, knowing they were no match for Richard's valor, retreated the next day.

Rumors spread, some blaming Richard for the death. The French accused Richard of foul play, leading to a rift with the Duke of Burgundy.

During the campaign, a bond akin to friendship formed between the sultan and King Richard. Saladin and Richard, both courageous leaders, admired each other's qualities. Saladin even sent gifts to Richard when he fell ill, reciprocated in kind by Richard. A meeting further solidified their bond, with Richard promising to return with a larger army to rescue Jerusalem.

Sir Baldwin expressed concern about the lack of chivalry among German lords and decided that Cuthbert, a young knight, should accompany him instead of Sir Cuthbert due to Sir Baldwin's experience in European travel. Sir Baldwin instructed Cuthbert to be his messenger to England in case he didn't return, urging him to inform his family and rally support against his enemies, especially his brother John. Sir Baldwin rewarded Cnut and his archers with gold chains before they set off on their journey. Cuthbert suggested a brief delay in Zara to avoid suspicion, then they traveled in disguise through Italy, encountering the splendor of Padua and Verona.

Cuthbert was on a journey from Italy to meet King Richard in Saxony but faced financial constraints. As they left Italy for Trent, a crucial city at the crossroads of Italy and Germany, they were warned about the treacherous winter storms in the mountains. The landlord advised hiring a guide to navigate the perilous snow-covered paths. The guide emphasized the dangers posed by snowstorms and lurking wolves. Cuthbert bought cloaks for his group to shield them from the cold. The steep ascent required them to walk, leading their horses. As they climbed, the weather worsened, and the guide expressed concern. Despite the challenges, Cuthbert pressed on, anxious about the impending snowstorm and the safety of his group in the unforgiving mountains.|"[""1.

The landscape turned wild with snow-covered crags and mountain peaks shining in the sun. The woods along the path were snow-free, but higher up, they stood dark against the white ground. The wind blew sharply, and everyone was grateful for their warm cloaks. Cnut expressed unease about the eerie silence and the chilling cold. As they pressed on, clouds gathered, and light snowflakes began to fall. The guide sensed a storm approaching. The group struggled to walk against the gusting wind and snow. Cuthbert found solace in the wind, breaking the unnatural silence. They sought shelter from the storm, collecting firewood to light a fire in a hut. The warmth revived their spirits as they huddled around the crackling flames, finding comfort in each other's company.|"['1.

Cnut and his companions found themselves trapped in a refuge during a fierce storm in the mountains. As the wolves howled outside, Cnut's bravado waned, realizing the danger they posed.

"Cuthbert was shocked. ""Someone is in danger,"" he said to Cnut. ""We must help them."" Ignoring the guide's protests, they armed themselves and rushed out into the night.

At night, while sitting by the fire at the inn, a knight asked Sir Cuthbert about his plans. Sir Cuthbert was warned that the town they were heading to was hostile towards his people due to a connection between the town's baron and Conrad of Montferat. Sir Cuthbert defended his king, stating that King Richard had appointed Conrad as the King of Jerusalem. The knight advised Sir Cuthbert to maintain his disguise as a French knight to avoid suspicion. The knight offered to accompany Sir Cuthbert into the town and introduce him as a French knight to prevent any trouble. Sir Cuthbert accepted the offer gratefully as his purse was empty.

The scene depicted the dishonor of England by Austria, which was met with cheers from the crowd. Cuthbert, controlling his anger, realized the futility of reacting. However, Cnut, incensed by the insult to England's flag, leaped onto the car, struck the Austrian figure, and raised the English flag amidst an uproar. The crowd surged forward, but Cnut managed to escape with his comrades down a side street. Cuthbert, momentarily stunned by Cnut's actions, joined the archers but was soon seized by citizens and taken to the castle. Despite his imminent danger, Cuthbert found solace in his followers' escape. He knew the baron's animosity towards the English would escalate, jeopardizing his own life.

A brave young Englishman was facing execution after a dispute with a baron. As he stood ready to meet his fate, an unexpected turn of events occurred. An arrow struck the executioner, saving the young man's life. The English archers on the city wall then caused chaos among the baron's men. In the confusion, the young man escaped, thanks to the help of his loyal friend, Cnut, and a group of brave men. They used a rope to descend the wall and fled across the countryside.

No response was received to the demand to surrender. The attackers used their battle-axes to force open the door of the turret. Upon entering, they were surprised to find it empty. Looking over the wall, they saw the escape route - a rope hanging down. The fugitives had already vanished. Enraged by the escape of those who had challenged them and killed the baron and his knights, the pursuers were ordered to give chase. It took some time before the city gates opened, and a group of knights and mounted men set off in pursuit. Cuthbert was confident a pursuit would begin, so he changed direction, circling the city and heading towards the mountains. The group ran for their lives, eventually finding safety in a village where they learned they were in a Swiss canton, beyond the reach of their pursuers.

Sir Baldwin suggested that Cuthbert should claim his title formally by writing to the king-at-arms and announce his return to Prince John as ""Sir Cuthbert, Earl of Evesham."" However, Sir Baldwin advised against trying to regain his position immediately, as Prince John was unlikely to recognize him. Sir Baldwin emphasized that Cuthbert was young and could afford to wait for King Richard's return, who would likely right the wrongs. They also discussed the risks the Lady Margaret faced, as Sir Rudolph might try to marry her by force.

Sir Baldwin advised Cuthbert not to rush into capturing the castle with his outlaws as he might not be able to hold it against the prince's forces. Sir Baldwin warned that Prince John could easily overpower them with his loyal followers and foreign mercenaries. He suggested that attempting rebellion could lead to dire consequences, including a price on Cuthbert's head. Instead, he proposed that Cuthbert keep his return a secret and avoid drawing attention to himself. Cuthbert disguised himself as a simple knight and traveled to Worcester. Upon reuniting with his forest allies, they pledged their loyalty to him. Cuthbert decided to avoid revealing himself to his mother immediately to prevent any unwanted attention. He sent Cnut to inform his mother of his return cautiously and arrange a secret meeting.

Cuthbert met with the Lady Abbess of St. Anne's to discuss the current challenges he faced. The Lady Abbess welcomed Cuthbert warmly and was pleased to see how he had grown from the young lad she once knew. She assured Cuthbert that the Lady Margaret was eager to meet him and expressed disbelief in any violation of the convent's sanctity, even by Prince John's minions. However, Cuthbert remained cautious, explaining that the news of King Richard's capture had heightened the urgency for those in power to secure their positions. He feared that Sir Rudolph, the cruel ruler of Evesham, might hasten his plans to marry Lady Margaret to claim the earldom. Cuthbert's concerns were rooted in the ambition and greed driving Sir Rudolph's actions, which could endanger Lady Margaret's safety. Despite the Lady Abbess's reassurances, Cuthbert remained vigilant in protecting Lady Margaret from the tyrant's grasp.|"[""1.

Sir Cuthbert and the abbess discussed the safety of Lady Margaret. Sir Rudolph urged her marriage, but the abbess believed she was too young. The abbess hesitated to send Lady Margaret away, fearing Sir Rudolph's search. Sir Cuthbert suggested hiding her with a small franklin, but the abbess disagreed. Lady Margaret, though young, showed maturity beyond her years. Sir Cuthbert expressed his unworthiness but vowed to protect her. Lady Margaret trusted Sir Cuthbert and the abbess, aware of the lurking danger. Cuthbert assured her of constant vigilance and rescue if needed. After bidding farewell, Sir Cuthbert and Cnut noticed a man spying on them. Cnut prepared to confront the spy if he approached.|"[""1.

Cuthbert advised against being seen and suggested avoiding the man's notice to prevent suspicion. As they turned the corner, a man approached and tried to scrutinize them. Cnut pretended to be drunk and pushed the man away. When the man tried to retaliate, Cnut subdued him. Cnut expressed annoyance at the man's interference. They discussed the abbess's information about the convent and decided to keep a close watch. Meanwhile, a man with a dubious past set up a shop near the convent to spy. A group led by Cnut stayed near the convent, while others occupied a deserted grange to observe the area. Tensions rose between outlaws and the Earl of Evesham's men. Rumors of a former leader's return and a noble stranger alarmed Sir Rudolph. He contemplated eliminating Cuthbert or forcing Lady Margaret into marriage. Sir Rudolph, a contemptuous Norman, dismissed threats and plotted against his rivals.|"['1.

Cnut and his companions, disguised as yeomen, gathered near the church where a crowd had gathered. Unable to read, Cnut inquired about the commotion caused by a paper posted on the door. The burgess explained that it was a challenge from Sir Rudolf to a Saxon serf claiming to be Earl of Evesham. Despite his desire to confront Rudolf, Cnut decided to seek his master's counsel first. Realizing the potential danger, he penned a response to Rudolf's challenge, asserting Sir Cuthbert's rightful claim. Later, Cnut's response replaced Rudolf's challenge at the church, sparking astonishment and anger.

The mercer had stored provisions for three days for a large troop. Cuthbert was with them, while Cnut stayed at the grange. On the third day, Sir Rudolph and his men arrived, claiming to pass through. Many of his men entered the town discreetly. The people were surprised, but the Abbess of St. Anne's feared an evil intent. Sir Rudolph demanded the Lady Margaret be surrendered within minutes, threatening force. The abbess warned against sacrilege. Arrows from Master Nicholas's house caused chaos, forcing Rudolph to retreat with losses. The town was alarmed, finding the square deserted except for casualties. Sir Rudolph's departure left confusion. The town secured itself, planning to investigate the incident the next day.|"['1.

In the morning, the town's leaders gathered to seek information but found none. The mayor and two councillors visited the convent, where they met the lady abbess. They learned that Sir Rudolph had tried to break into the convent to take a resident. The abbess had no further details, only hearing shouts and seeing the group outside retreat. Authorities discovered a closed draper's house with signs of a hidden group that likely thwarted Sir Rudolph's plan. The council decided to send a delegation to London to seek redress from the prince. However, King John was already angry, believing the town interfered with his commands. He threatened to punish Worcester but settled on a fine. The mayor and councillors returned, and the town faced a dilemma as mercenaries approached. After much debate, they decided to pay the fine to avoid further trouble.|"[""1.

Two days prior to the arrival of the army near Worcester, Lady Margaret departed from the convent late in the evening through a hidden gate at the back. She was accompanied by two sisters, all disguised as countrywomen. Mules awaited them outside the city gates, where Sir Cuthbert and his archers were ready to escort them. They journeyed through the night and reached a small convent near Hereford by morning. The abbess, a relative of St. Anne's Superior, agreed to shelter Lady Margaret. Sir Cuthbert assured her safety and left for the forest. The forest dwellers had to disperse due to limited resources, with only forty remaining on guard. Meanwhile, Sir Rudolph demanded Lady Margaret's surrender from the abbess, who revealed she had been moved for her protection. Later, Cuthbert received distressing news about his mother's capture by the earl, leading him to strategize a response with his band against the castle.|"['Question 1: How did Lady Margaret and her companions leave the convent?\nA) Through the front gate\nB) Through a hidden gate at the back\nC) Disguised as soldiers\nD) Riding on horses\nE) By climbing over the walls', 'Question 2: Who accompanied Lady Margaret when she departed from the convent?\nA) Sir Rudolph\nB) Sir Cuthbert and his archers\nC) The earl\nD) The forest dwellers\nE) Two sisters', ""Question 3: Where did Lady Margaret and her companions reach by morning?\nA) A castle near Hereford\nB) The city gates\nC) The forest\nD) A small convent near Hereford\nE) The abbess's residence"", 'Question 4: Who agreed to shelter Lady Margaret at the small convent near Hereford?\nA) The earl\nB) Sir Rudolph\nC) The forest dwellers\nD) Sir Cuthbert\nE) The abbess', 'Question 5: Why did the forest dwellers disperse?\nA) To search for Lady Margaret\nB) Due to a disagreement with Sir Cuthbert\nC) Due to limited resources\nD) To join forces with the earl\nE) To seek refuge in the convent', ""Question 6: What led Sir Cuthbert to strategize a response against the castle?\nA) The capture of Lady Margaret\nB) The arrival of the army\nC) The dispersal of the forest dwellers\nD) The demand for Lady Margaret's surrender\nE) The news about his mother's capture by the earl""]"|"['B) Through a hidden gate at the back', 'E) Two sisters', 'D) A small convent near Hereford', 'E) The abbess', 'C) Due to limited resources', ""E) The news about his mother's capture by the earl""]"
Cnut quickly dispatched messengers to carry out Cuthbert's orders, and the band gathered in the woods the next day. As Cuthbert prepared to lead them, a distant horn blast sounded. After a brief absence, Cnut returned with a herald from Sir Rudolph. The herald delivered a message, threatening Dame Editha's life unless Cuthbert surrendered by noon the next day. Despite the grim ultimatum, Cuthbert stood firm, denouncing Sir Rudolph's villainous actions. Cuthbert's followers, enraged, were eager to attack the castle, but he cautioned against it, highlighting the futility of a direct assault. Instead, Cuthbert devised a plan, which he shared only with Cnut, instilling hope in the group. As tensions rose, Cuthbert challenged Sir Rudolph to a duel, calling him out for his dishonorable conduct. The scene was tense, with the fate of Dame Editha hanging in the balance.|"[""1.

"Signaling to two soldiers, they brought forward Lady Editha and positioned her on the castle walls where she could be seen from below. Despite nearing forty, Lady Editha remained stunning. Fearless, she urged her son, ""Cuthbert, I command you to retreat. Let this dishonorable lord carry out his threats against me, for England will echo with his cowardly act. I am ready to face whatever comes."" Some of Sir Rudolph's companions, initially hesitant, now balked at his plan. Sir Hubert of Gloucester confronted Sir Rudolph, expressing regret for his involvement in the scheme. Sir Hubert, along with two others, distanced themselves from the situation, leaving the castle.

Dame Editha realized resistance was futile, so she descended with the men-at-arms. She knew pleading with Sir Rudolph was pointless. With determination, she vowed to seek vengeance for her son. Cnut offered his hand to Dame Editha, leading her to the archers. Meanwhile, Cuthbert entered the portal alone. Cnut then instructed his men to escort Dame Editha to the woods swiftly. He and his men readied their bows, preparing for action near the castle walls. Cnut confronted Cuthbert, accusing him of treason. Cuthbert demanded a fair trial by his peers. Ignoring Cuthbert's plea, Sir Rudolph declared his execution. In a bold move, Cuthbert struck Sir Rudolph and escaped, leaping into the moat. Cnut rescued Cuthbert from drowning and led him to safety. As they fled, archers defended them from the pursuing men-at-arms.|"['1.

Sir Rudolph was stunned by Cuthbert's blow, or he would have led the pursuit himself. The foresters would have fought hard to retreat to their stronghold. The officer leading the mercenaries wasn't eager for a fight. Men were scarce, and Prince John wouldn't be pleased if his costly foreign men were killed. So, the pursuit was called off, and the archers withdrew into the forest. Dame Editha joined them for three days before leaving to stay with relatives in Gloucestershire until things calmed down. Cuthbert was uneasy, knowing Sir Rudolph's interest in Lady Margaret. He feared Rudolph might find her through the convent's connection. Rudolph considered openly taking her or using a scheme. He planned a fake rescue to avoid blame. The lady superior refused to hand over Lady Margaret, warning of excommunication if they used force. The gate was breached, causing chaos among the nuns.|"[""1.

The abbess remained unfazed by the danger as the men barged in. Startled sisters revealed Lady Margaret's location. Upon hearing the commotion, Lady Margaret, fearing abduction, calmly faced the intruders. Despite their leader's presence, she agreed to go, urging them not to harm the nuns. With dignity, she left the convent escorted by the men, heading towards Evesham. En route, armed horsemen intercepted them, claiming to rescue her. Lady Margaret, uncertain of the truth, demanded to return to the convent. Sir Rudolph, Earl of Evesham, revealed he was to wed her by the prince's decree, refusing her request.

Lady Margaret, a courageous young girl, firmly rejected Sir Rudolph's advances, declaring him dishonorable and unworthy of her hand in marriage. Despite being a captive in the castle, she held onto hope for rescue. Meanwhile, discussions were underway among the forest outlaws, led by Sir Cuthbert, on how to save Lady Margaret. Cuthbert revealed a secret passage known only to a few, including himself and the earl. This hidden route could provide a means of escape for Lady Margaret, leading to a chapel unnoticed by the castle's besiegers. Sir Rudolph, fearing the outlaws' strength, had amassed a large force to defend the castle and eliminate the forest outlaws. However, Cuthbert devised a clever strategy to outsmart Sir Rudolph by luring his forces away from the castle, creating an opportunity for a daring rescue mission.|"['1.

Cuthbert and Cnut devised a clever plan to capture the castle. Cnut, disguised as a serf, would drive a cart filled with faggots towards the castle. He would claim to be delivering wood tribute from his master, the franklin of Hopeburn. The unsuspecting guards would lower the drawbridge and open the gates. Once inside, Cnut and his men would seize control, preventing the drawbridge from being raised again. Meanwhile, Sir Rudolph and his troops would swiftly arrive to secure the castle. The plan was to hold the castle for as long as possible, with a secret escape route if necessary. Lady Margaret, however, refused to marry Sir Rudolph, even under threat. The next day, Sir Rudolph and his men set out to confront the outlaws in the forest, facing resistance but making progress. The knights, foot soldiers, and fierce dogs pressed forward, gradually gaining ground and destroying the outlaws' hideouts. The forest was to be cleared of the villains, even if it took months to accomplish.|"[""1.

The heavy wagon crossed the drawbridge, but as it entered the gate, it suddenly stopped. Cnut struck the guard down and freed the oxen, driving them forward. The pile of wood collapsed, revealing twelve armed men who sprang out. The garrison was caught off guard and rushed to arms. Initially panicked, they regrouped and advanced against the attackers. A fierce fight ensued as the men formed a barrier. Cnut's group fought bravely, but when hope seemed lost, Cuthbert and 150 outlaws stormed in. The garrison, overwhelmed, surrendered. The castle was swiftly taken. Lady Margaret, rescued, rejoiced. The farmers' daughters, liberated from captivity, were overjoyed. Sir Rudolph, enraged, prepared for a siege but was thwarted by the castle's defenses. The outlaws' victory left him stunned and furious.|"['1.

During the medieval times, castles were formidable fortresses that could withstand attacks for extended periods. Before gunpowder, the walls were so thick that even large stones hurled from balistas couldn't breach them quickly. The moats surrounding the castles were wide and deep, making it hard for attackers to storm them with ladders. Often, castles fell to sieges due to lack of provisions rather than direct attacks. Sir Rudolph, a castle defender, prepared for a siege by collecting supplies and strategizing with his knights and mercenaries. They attempted to fill a portion of the moat with earth-filled bags to gain access. However, the attackers faced fierce resistance from the defenders, using various weapons like mangonels and Greek fire. Despite their efforts, the attackers failed to breach the castle walls after a ten-day siege. Inside the castle, the garrison was well-prepared to repel any assault with stones, pitch, and other defenses. The siege tactics used in these medieval times were similar to those employed by ancient Romans.|['1.

That evening, a war council was held outside. Large machines sent by Sir Rudolph had arrived. Two castles on wheels were prepared as a backup, with a huge beam hung between them. The next day, this setup was pushed across the moat onto the newly-formed ground. Armed men on the towers operated machines that launched arrows and other projectiles, while others operated the ram. The ram swung back and forth, striking the wall heavily. Stone-throwing machines were also used, along with more towers with drawbridges to storm the walls. Despite the valiant defense by the garrison, the besiegers made progress each day. Eventually, the besieged fell back to the inner keep, where the enemy managed to breach the door after several failed attempts. In the end, Cuthbert decided to abandon the castle to prevent it from being completely destroyed.|['1.

Lady Margaret was thrilled to hear that the time had come for her to escape. The constant sounds of war in the castle made her anxious. She feared for Cuthbert's safety and the lives of the brave men fighting. The attackers had destroyed the door but didn't make further attempts that evening. In the morning, they planned to attack again. Cuthbert revealed a hidden passage in the hall, leading to an exit behind the castle. They made their way through the damp, dreary passage to a deserted friary in the woods. Cuthbert decided to leave Lady Margaret with Sir Baldwin and set off on his journey. They disguised themselves and rode to a convent near Gloucester, where the girls sought refuge. Cuthbert continued to Sir Baldwin's castle to seek advice on safely bringing Lady Margaret there.

Cuthbert decided to head east in search of the missing King, held captive by the emperor. He planned to go to the Tyrol, retrace the King's steps, and gather information about his whereabouts. Realizing his current situation in England was futile without land or vassals, he resolved to join the barons if they raised King Richard's standard against Prince John. However, Cuthbert was warned by Sir Baldwin to avoid being captured by the emperor. As he journeyed to London, Cuthbert learned of the growing dissent against Prince John and his mercenaries. His plans changed when news of a gathering of loyal barons reached him, prompting him to seek out Robin Hood and his outlaws. Together, they joined forces with the loyal barons to face Prince John's army. After a successful battle, Prince John agreed to the demands of the barons, leading to the dismissal of the mercenaries and a return to peace. Cuthbert then set off for London with renewed determination, accompanied by the minstrel Blondel.|"[""1.

Sir Cuthbert, a disinherited knight, shared his story with Sir Adelbert. Upon returning to England, he found the Earl of Evesham in possession of his rightful lands and titles granted by King Richard. Despite being adopted by the Earl and promised his daughter's hand, Prince John favored another, denying Cuthbert his inheritance. Eager to reclaim his birthright, Sir Cuthbert sought Blondel and Sir Adelbert's help. Together, they planned to assess the Baron's castle, where Sir Adelbert could potentially gather support from his retainers to challenge the Baron's force of fifty to sixty men.

"""That is Rotherheim,"" the knight said, pointing to a fortress standing on a crag, which rose high above the woods around it; ""and that,"" he said, pointing to another some four miles away, similarly placed, ""is my own.""

Cuthbert examined closely the fortress of Rotherheim. It was a large building, with towers at the angles, and seemed to rise almost abruptly from the edge of the rock. Inside rose the gables and round turrets of the dwelling-place of the baron; and the only access was by a steep winding path on the river side.

""It is indeed a strong place,"" Cuthbert said, ""and difficult to take by surprise. A watch no doubt is always kept over the entrance, and there we can hope for no success. The only plan will be to scale the wall by means of a ladder; but how the ladder is to be got to so great a height, I own at present passes my comprehension.""

After much thought, Cuthbert went on, ""It might, methinks, be practicable for an archer to approach the walls, and to shoot an arrow over the angle of the castle so that it would pass inside the turret there, and fall in the forest beyond.

The news had spread across Europe that Richard was imprisoned in the emperor's castle. The bishop, representing England, demanded a meeting with the emperor. Surrounded by his nobles, the emperor proposed a ransom of 150,000 marks for Richard's release. The bishop contested the emperor's right to detain Richard and put him to ransom, but pledged to raise the sum. The emperor insisted on trying Richard for various crimes before his release. The bishop expressed faith in the nobles' fairness. The bishop swiftly returned to England to gather the ransom, facing obstacles from Prince John. Despite challenges, preparations began.

The trial began with various accusations, the main one being the murder of Conrad of Montferat. Yet, evidence was weak. German barons who fought in the crusades testified against the charges. Richard refuted the accusations, stating they were absurd. The trial ended with Richard being acquitted. The money was raised, and he was released by the emperor upon payment and a promise to settle the rest.|"['1.
