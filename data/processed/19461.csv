Once, a young woman named Surya Bai was fetching water from the well for the old Milkwoman when the Rajah rode by. Seeing her, he mistakenly believed she was his wife and chased after her. Frightened by the sound of approaching horses, Surya Bai hurried home and hid. The Rajah, finding only the old Milkwoman at the hut, was met with fierce resistance. The old woman, claiming Surya Bai as her daughter, refused to yield to the Rajah's demands, asserting her authority in her own home. Realizing his error, the Rajah sought the truth by visiting Surya Bai's old attendant in prison.

Surya Bai shared her remarkable journey with her parents, explaining how she transformed into a sunflower after escaping death in a tank. The wicked first Ranee discarded the sunflower, leading to Surya Bai's rebirth as a mango tree. Her spirit resided in a mango flower, eventually turning into fruit, where she then leaped into a milk can, marking her destiny. The Rajah, upon hearing her tale, bestowed honors upon her family, granting her father a village and elevating their status. The old attendant, who had been unjustly imprisoned, was appointed as the palace housekeeper and rewarded generously. The first Ranee faced imprisonment, while Surya Bai lived happily with her husband, surrounded by sunflowers and mango trees in memory of her extraordinary experiences. Meanwhile, in Bagdad, the Caliph enjoyed a peaceful afternoon with his Grand Vizier, who expressed sadness over his inability to purchase exquisite wares from a merchant.

On a stormy night, two weary children, Arndt and Reutha, trudged home across a desolate moor. The wind howled as they approached the Baltic sea, their tired faces feeling the sting of the cold. Reutha, exhausted, pleaded to rest on a small mound covered in bushes. Arndt, the caring elder brother, tried to carry her, but she was too heavy. As the moon emerged, the mound seemed like a welcoming refuge. Arndt wrapped Reutha in her cloak, and she settled down, seeking respite.

Arndt frantically searched for his sister Reutha near a small mound and among the bushes but found no trace of her. An old man passing by shared tales of underground dwarfs living in the fairy-hill, taking children as servants and leaving only their shoes behind. The old man mentioned that the dwarfs wore glass shoes and served whoever possessed their green caps. Intrigued, Arndt hid near the mound and witnessed a dazzling underground palace where the Hill-people danced and played. A green cap landed on Arndt's head, and a Hill-man appeared, offering to serve him.

The Hill-man guided the boy through stunning galleries, halls, and gardens, filling his senses with beauty. Arndt's memories of his sister faded as he indulged in the delights of the fairy palace. Days passed in joy until one day, he heard a sorrowful song and saw Reutha, his sister, toiling among mortal children. Touched by her plight, Arndt demanded her release from the Hill-people. Overwhelmed with emotion, he dressed Reutha in his own robes, realizing the disparity in their treatment. Anger flared as he confronted the dwarfs, but they showed him treasures and his reflection, tempting him with riches and vanity. Arndt faced a choice between material wealth and his sister's well-being, a test of his character in the enchanting but deceptive fairyland.|"[""1.

Hans, Fritz, and Franz lived in a forest hut. Fritz and Franz were selfish and ill-mannered, always grumbling and never sharing. Hans, however, was kind and cheerful, always helping his family. One day, a huntsman knocked on their door, hungry and far from home. While Fritz and Franz were rude, Hans offered him water and his last piece of bread. The huntsman thanked him and mentioned the sparkling golden water that turns everything into gold, hidden in the forest of dead trees beyond the blue mountains. Before leaving, the huntsman gave Hans a small bread pellet, advising him to keep it for the journey.

Fritz, the eldest, dreamed of wealth and power from the sparkling golden water. He planned to become a Count, hunt daily, and live lavishly. In contrast, Franz desired ease and comfort, envisioning himself as the Burgomaster. After much debate, Fritz embarked on the quest first. As he journeyed, Fritz faced rejection and hunger. Approaching a desolate forest, he encountered a terrifying unicorn with a golden horn. Despite his intentions, Fritz was flung into a tree, landing in a hollow trunk as the unicorn trotted away. Trapped and injured, Fritz resorted to eating insects to survive. Meanwhile, his family remained unaware of his predicament.|['1.

Franz, Hans, and their mother anxiously awaited Fritz's return. While Hans and his mother couldn't fathom Fritz abandoning them after securing the golden water, Franz, judging his brother's character, believed otherwise. As time passed with no sign of Fritz, Franz's patience waned. Determined to claim the golden water for himself and become Burgomaster, he embarked on the same journey as Fritz, facing even greater challenges due to his resemblance to his brother. Reaching the forest's edge, Franz encountered a unicorn demanding his purpose. When Franz stated his intentions, the unicorn flung him into a tree where Fritz was already trapped. Despite being stuck together, the brothers quarreled and remained silent during their captivity. Back home, Hans struggled to provide for his ailing mother and contemplated seeking help from Fritz and Franz, convinced they had obtained the golden water.

Hans's mother reluctantly agreed to stay with Uncle Stoltz as Hans set out to find his brothers. He easily discovered their path and was warmly welcomed at every stop due to his politeness and cheerful demeanor. Eventually, he reached the forest of dead trees and faced the golden-horned unicorn. Unafraid, Hans calmly stated he sought his brothers, Fritz and Franz. The unicorn, solemnly, informed him that he may have the crystal ball in his pocket. Hans found only the black bread pellet given by the stranger-huntsman. The unicorn declared the pellet a crystal ball, making him Hans's servant. With a flask, the unicorn would take him to the sparkling golden water. After freeing his brothers from the tree, they expressed their gratitude and vowed to be kinder.

The unicorn led Hans to a fountain with sparkling golden water, warning him not to touch it directly, as it turned things to gold permanently. Hans collected the water carefully, but his finger accidentally touched it, turning to gold. The unicorn advised him on how to protect the flask and a crystal ball he carried. Hans intended to return the kindness to his brothers, who planned to deceive him for the golden water. Despite their attempts, Hans held onto the flask tightly.

Hans was growing impatient at the delay and disregarded the unicorn's warning, stepping into the shallow stream first.

The brothers then crossed the stream, but a dispute arose over sharing the golden water. In the scuffle that followed, the sparkling water spilled over Fritz's hand and Franz's foot, turning them to solid gold.

They lashed him through the streets, finally thrusting him out of the gate with a warning never to return. Watching gleefully was Franz, taunting his brother as he was beaten. In contrast, Hans, seeing his brother's suffering, tried to intervene but failed. He later comforted Fritz, who was bitter and ungrateful. The next day, it was Franz's turn to try and win the Princess using a necromancer's false promise. When his plan failed, he faced the same punishment as Fritz. Hans tried to console him, but with little success. Later, a huntsman visited Hans, the same man who had given him the crystal ball.|"['1.

"""I would give my life to win her,"" he said, earnestly, ""but I am certain to fail, and then what will my poor mother do? I have no property to be confiscated, and, of course, I shall be sold into slavery.""

""Don't talk of failure,"" said the huntsman cheerily; ""the way to success is to forget that there is such a word as failure. Now I'll tell you my plan.

Once upon a time, two brothers lived together. One was hardworking, while the other was lazy and only cared about eating and drinking.

Once upon a time, a brave young man encountered ghosts who demanded to know his identity. Refusing to speak, the ghosts heated him on an anvil and flattened him with hammers, but he remained silent. As the ghosts prepared to leave, they blessed him and vanished. The next day, three ladies in white thanked him for saving them and offered to marry him. Choosing the youngest lady, he received gifts—a ham, wine, bread, three dogs, and a magical pipe. With the dogs' help, he explored the world. In a castle, he met a Tiger and his wife, who showed him wonders. However, the Tiger's wife imprisoned his dogs. When the young man fell into a dark cellar, the Tiger threatened him. Using the dogs, he escaped the cellar and obtained a salve from the Tiger.

Once upon a time, a young lad was in the kitchen, sharpening a bread knife. He grabbed a loaf and pretended to cut it in two. He then hid with Dapplegrim, who helped him transform into a fly and later a clod of earth to evade the Princess. They prepared for a grand wedding and rode to the church on Dapplegrim. Meanwhile, in Babylon, a man named Zadig met a wise hermit by the Euphrates. They conversed about destiny, justice, and morality. The hermit's wisdom captivated Zadig, who asked him to stay until they returned to Babylon. They were welcomed into a lavish mansion where the master showed generosity but lacked humility.

At the time of evening prayers, the children reached a city they thought might be where their father, the king, lived. They asked a kind lady for a place to stay, and she agreed as they were polite and well-behaved. The next morning, the girl cleaned the house while the boy watered the garden. Impressed, the lady asked them to stay. The boy said his sister could, but he needed to attend to some business. He set off, praying for success. After days of searching, tired and sad, he sat under a tree. A dove arrived, and he asked for help. The dove guided him to a witch's tower. The witch demanded water from a special fountain. The boy succeeded with the help of a little white bird, freeing enchanted people. The witch fled, and the people thanked the boy, accompanying him back to the city.

Once upon a time, in the province of Candahar, lived a young boy named Rustem. He was the only son of a lord, known as a Mirza, with a good estate. Rustem was destined to marry a girl of his own rank, bringing joy to both families. However, fate took a different turn when Rustem fell in love with the Princess of Cashmere at a fair in Cabul.

The young man lacked funds for a long trip. Wise Topaz would have declined but Ebony provided the money.

Rustem discovered his elephant in a tussle with a rhinoceros. As despair set in over lost horses and companions, they encountered a beautiful, swift striped ass being mistreated by a peasant.

Wang Chih found himself in a strange place where time seemed to have slipped away. The old men playing chess offered him what he thought were date stones, but turned out to be magical sweetmeats. As he lingered, he noticed their beards growing impossibly long. When he tried to leave, the axe he held crumbled to dust. Descending the mountain, he discovered his village replaced by a bustling town. Seeking his family, he encountered only unfamiliar faces.

Returning to the king's house, everyone was happy, preparing for the upcoming wedding between the general and the princess. During the ceremony, the priest declared that only the one who could untie the knot without cutting it would marry the princess.
