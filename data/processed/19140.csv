"""No, I won't upset my uncle; I can forgive him. Joanna needn't be so frightened. There's no such thing as revenge in Christian countries; you're the one being unchristian.

Mrs. Jardine acted wisely by sending her son away to avoid bad memories. She knew he might develop negative feelings. Some wives don't understand their husbands' feelings. Mrs. Crawfurd was a good wife but didn't see her husband's struggles. It's sad to hear a man say he wishes you weren't sacrificing for him. Joanna, proud to help her father, explains how they manage social invitations. Lilias is the wise one in the family. She knows how to handle social events to avoid selfishness.

"""Yes, Joanna can be quite temperamental,"" Mrs. Crawfurd added, continuing her own train of thought. ""People who don't know her well might think she's gentler than Susan, but I've witnessed her outbursts. When she believes she's right, she can be quite stubborn. You're a good girl too, but you can be deceiving."" Joanna's occasional outbursts stem from her sensitivity to injustice and wrongdoing. When she firmly believes in what's right, she can be quite unyielding, much like Cordelia. Mrs. Crawfurd then lamented Susan's forgetfulness of her pearl sprigs, fearing it would ruin her appearance.

In the moorland country where the Crawfurds lived, rough ponies were plentiful for the family to ride. Joanna, though not one to often ride, joined in on this occasion. She was described as a little, soft girl with a thoughtful character. Joanna's mother called her a deception, as she seemed younger than she was and had a kind and easygoing nature. As Joanna and her sister Conny rode near Corncockle Moor, Joanna avoided thinking about recent events involving a tragic incident. However, Mrs. Maxwell unexpectedly interrupted Joanna's plans, insisting that she and Conny join a party. Despite Joanna's reluctance, Mrs. Maxwell was determined to have them stay.

Harry had the flaws common to his kind, speaking proper English to women but resorting to his island slang with men. He admired the spirit of a woman named Joanna, seeing her as both tender and brave. Polly Musgrave, another woman, was seen as practical and worldly, contrasting with Joanna's romantic and chivalrous nature. Despite Joanna's initial dislike of Polly, she acknowledged Polly's good deeds and felt a bit remorseful for not liking her more. Joanna, while not romantic herself, often found faults in others and worried about being critical. Harry's return to Whitethorn created a stir but he remained popular due to his charm and pleasant demeanor. Joanna recognized that external factors influenced Harry's popularity, pondering how his circumstances could change perceptions.|"['1.

The Crawfurds occasionally crossed paths with Mr. Jardine, but their acquaintance had little chance to develop further. Mr. Crawfurd couldn't fetch Harry at Whitethorn, and Harry saw no need to visit the Ewes. Mrs. Jardine, still reeling from her widowhood, began reconnecting with old friends for Harry's sake. She, however, had no intention of renewing ties with the Ewes. The frost had arrived early, blanketing the Highlands of the Lowlands. Joanna preferred the wild moor over the garden. The short-lived beauty of the moor's seasons saddened her. One chilly morning, Joanna stumbled upon a motionless figure on the heather, mistaking it for a tragic memory. To her relief, it was Harry Jardine, unconscious from a hunting mishap. Joanna realized that Harry's recent health struggles had been underestimated, prompting her to take action.|"['1.

Joanna quickly freed herself from the mysterious figure and called out his name while touching him gently. She was relieved to find him breathing but cold and stiff. Unsure of what to do next, she realized he needed urgent help. Joanna raised her voice for assistance in the deserted moor, hoping her family would hear her cries. Desperate, she chafed his hands and prayed for his recovery, fearing the worst. With a sudden idea, she used a bottle of perfume to revive him, pouring it over his forehead, throat, and chest. As she called out for help again, Harry Jardine stirred, slowly waking up as Joanna's family approached, concerned about her absence.|"['1.

Harry Jardine was taken to the Ewes some hours before his mother, who had happily been deceived as to his return on the previous night, was even apprised of his narrow escape. He received kindness from the Crawfurds, and his mother wrote a note to the Ewes, thanking them for their humanity towards her son. Mr. Crawfurd excused her fully. Harry visited the Ewes and found opportunities to come in contact with Joanna Crawfurd. Harry cherished friendly feelings towards the Crawfurds and desired to visit them openly. Joanna, a thoughtful and tender woman, became the one mistress in the world for Harry. Harry confessed that Joanna's image was constantly before him since he awakened from his drowsiness on the moor. Joanna, with the prescience of a woman, avoided Harry, but his determination and passion overpowered her. Mr. Crawfurd was upset by Harry's entreaty for grace. Harry implored Mr. Crawfurd to spare his love for Joanna, emphasizing forgiveness and duty. Harry's mother opposed his suit, but Harry believed in forgiveness and love.|"[""1.

Harry was not entirely in favor of this decision. He was a good person, very good, and he had a deep devotion to Joanna Crawfurd; however, he struggled with feelings of jealousy, irritation, sorrow, and fear when he had to be apart from her. He had to settle for swearing loyalty on his own behalf and seeing her only as a casual acquaintance until their circumstances changed or his loyalty wavered. The world continued its usual course, with seasons passing by, but everything seemed to culminate in a dull and monotonous cycle of vanity and frustration. The frosty wind had stripped the beauty from the landscape, leaving only the damp moss looking fresh when the snow melted. Joanna felt the cold keenly, and even though she assured everyone she was fine, her thinness and paleness worried her friends. Mrs. Jardine, Joanna's mother, couldn't help but notice the resemblance between Joanna and her late sister Anne, who hadn't coped well with a similar situation. She couldn't shake the feeling that Joanna was heading down the same path as her sister. Harry's discomfort with Joanna's cheerfulness surprised Mrs. Jardine, who found herself questioning whether she was being too harsh on her daughter.

Harry responded to his mother with a firm tone, expressing that the situation was his own concern, and no one, not even her, should interfere. He explained that the offer was to lend him money to settle the bank's claims and keep Whitethorn, which he declined out of respect for himself and the lender. Despite hurting his mother unintentionally, Harry stood by his decision. His mother, troubled by Harry's actions, spent the day and night in distress. She pondered if Harry was disrespecting his father's memory and the family's heritage by refusing the loan. The estate held sentimental value, but Harry's rash decisions risked losing it all.

Nelly recovered slowly but with doubt and apprehension creeping over her brightening prospect. Her limbs would never more obey her active spirit due to a relentless malady. The young mother's heart was doomed to drag out a protracted existence linked to a corpse-like frame. Despite her affliction, Nelly never spoke of it and never parted from her baby. She accepted the tangible evil from God's hand with noble resignation. Rising above her hapless lot, the old Nelly Carnegie was in a degree restored.

Nelly was startled by the figure who drew closer, realizing it was no ghost but a mortal. Her fear turned to determination as she held her child close.

"Were these ancient times resurrected by magic? Had a deranged servant revived the vanished duties of his warrior predecessor? Was the ghostly figure of a castle official or soldier summoning a phantom light to pierce the soft air? Was an evil spirit set to confuse and lead a doomed ship to its destruction on the sharp rocks under the eerie calm of the glassy sea? The mist thickened over Earlscraig until, like a bolt of lightning, a burst of flame leaped from a high window and illuminated the gathering darkness. No horn sounded, no bugle called, no horses or rushing footsteps shattered the quiet; the house lay in deep slumber, the sleepers undisturbed, though it was no ghostly glow, no marshy light, but the imminent presence of a dreadful foe. And the smoke billowed thicker, more suffocating; the red flames shot up repeatedly, and burning embers rained down like a swarm of fireflies, before a solitary hurried step stirred an echo already drowned in the roar and crackle of fire. A startled, partially dressed servant dashed out into the courtyard, raised his hands in alarm at the sight around him, then hastened back, and suddenly the great bell rang out its urgent alarm. ""Good people, good people, danger is upon us! For the love of Jesus and for your lives, rise and flee! The angels beckon, Sodom is near--away, away!"" The call was not ignored. Within"|"['1.

Despite her outdoor adventures, Leslie's appearance transformed, becoming robust and weathered. Hector Garret observed her napping in the moonlight, but their interactions lacked intimacy. As autumn arrived, Leslie's enthusiasm waned, and she sought solace indoors. Despite Hector Garret's attempts to engage her, Leslie struggled with feelings of inadequacy and a desire for a more meaningful connection.

Hector Garret was oblivious to the disagreement. He would often humor Bridget, smiling at her harshness as it suited him. If asked, he might have taken Bridget's side and criticized Leslie as touchy and inconsiderate. However, Leslie never sought Hector's judgment, as she was at a disadvantage due to her noble temperament in an unsightly conflict. Bridget troubled Leslie, but Leslie refused to harm Bridget in any way. Despite Bridget's firm friendship with Hector, Leslie doubted she would ever become the wise and supportive woman she once aspired to be. The solitude at Otter was regrettable, especially when few families in the area, some of higher birth than breeding, did not consider Leslie their equal socially. The only unpretentious house in sight was Earlscraig, a grim turret on a peninsula, a reminder of tragedy and ruin in the countryside. Leslie felt like a stranger in the homes of humbler friends, unable to connect with them as freely as the reserved master of Otter. She felt older and disenchanted, reflecting on her past naivety.

Hector Garret found it odd that Bridget, who had been so loyal to the grand lady of Otter, now seemed distant. He wondered if it was due to their child. He felt guilty for stifling Bridget's spirit.

"In his embrace, he showered her with lingering kisses on her eyes, hair, and hands. Even after he departed, she stood still, rooted to the spot. Was it amazement, anger, or terror? Or perhaps a surge of joy for their union? Or was it because she had conquered him, the man who had wronged her, yet remained Hector Garret, the hero of her youth.

In the past, both animals and humans had their time to shine. The sound of horses trotting, their lively neighs, and the swish of their long tails added to the overall appeal. The Yeomen's coats were a vibrant red, adding to the spectacle. The gathering of the troop for ten days brought people from all around the county, creating a lively atmosphere. The tradition of billeting ensured every bed was occupied. Visitors and companions joined in the excitement, making the town of Priorton lively and bustling during the yeomanry weeks. The arrival of country gentlemen and farmers, carrying their cherished symbols, marked the beginning of the campaign. The streets were filled with greetings, horse preparations, and joyful gatherings in homes. The summer setting with green trees, blooming roses, and daisy-covered meadows added to the charm of the event. The bugle's call at dawn signaled the start of the day, drawing youngsters and onlookers to witness the Yeomen's preparations. The sight of the Yeomen in their martial attire, awkward and self-conscious, contrasted with the ease of experienced riders.

In the past, a brave young soldier would challenge a fierce horse, determined to master the wild animal despite its fear of his uniform. With whip and spur, he would command the horse through precise military maneuvers. The horse, in turn, would retaliate when the soldier dismounted, causing chaos. Eventually, a compromise was reached by covering the horse's head, allowing for safer rides. The bugle would sound for morning drills, followed by a lively breakfast. The Yeomen would then go about their daily tasks, some still in uniform. Afternoon drills were tiresome, but evenings brought joy and laughter as the Yeomen socialized with the townspeople. Despite accidents like Sandy's fall, the camaraderie and support among the soldiers were heartwarming.|"['1.

"Dear Mad,

It feels strange to address you again. I remember the days when I called you 'Mad,' a girl with a white face and dark eyes. Was she pretty? Some thought so, but I can't say. Mad and I were close friends when I visited her brother, in a teasing way. I never wanted to hurt Mad, and she never meant any harm. Do you recall how you used to meet your little brother on the moorland road? Your dog was a favorite, and I regret not standing by you. I was fickle, circumstances pulled us apart, and I married another. Yet, I realize now, the value of our friendship. It pains me to learn you are a lonely teacher. I lost a precious jewel in you, Mad.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]"|"['1. What is the relationship between the speaker and Mad?\nA) Siblings\nB) Close friends\nC) Colleagues\nD) Teacher and student\nE) Enemies', ""2.

I was once indecisive, but my wife was far better to me than I deserved. Mad, my wife, was a kind woman, and I cherished her deeply. Sadly, she passed away two winters ago, leaving me with our children. Now, I ponder on my past mistakes and wish to make amends. I think of another woman to whom I wronged greatly. She was unlike any other to me. I wonder if I can make things right with her. This woman, a teacher, has always been true. I seek redemption for my past misdeeds. I am not wealthy, but I am willing to make amends. I recall the memories of Christmases past with her and hope for a chance to make things right. I trust in her magnanimity and hope she will forgive me.|['1.

"Dear Sir,

Teaching at a school is not as tough as you may believe. Miss Sandys is a wonderful woman, a trustworthy friend, and a pleasant companion. The students and their backgrounds present a wide range of personalities and situations, and as pupils, they are mostly caring and engaging. I appreciate your kind words and wish you well in the future, but I must decline your generous offer. Times have changed, and I prefer to move forward. In a gesture of goodwill, I have included some toys for the children. Please give them as inexpensive New Year's gifts on my behalf. 

Miss West felt relieved after sending the letter and toys, hoping to part ways amicably with Bill Nairne. She wanted to ensure her final words were not hurtful. The Christmas atmosphere around her comforted her, and she looked forward to the end of the holiday season, eager to return to normalcy."|['1.

Miss West was startled when a familiar face, Bill Nairne, unexpectedly appeared at the door. Despite her initial surprise, she remained composed, declining Mr. Middlemass's offer to stay for the evening. Mrs. Middlemass intervened, suggesting that Miss West could walk home alone as it was a short distance. However, Bill Nairne insisted on escorting her, reminiscing about their old friendship. Miss West, accustomed to independence, was taken aback by this gesture. As they walked together under the moonlight, Bill felt a sense of regret for straying from his past ideals, realizing the gap between his current self and the man he once aspired to be for Mad. The encounter left both reflecting on the passage of time and the changes it had wrought upon them.|"[""1.
