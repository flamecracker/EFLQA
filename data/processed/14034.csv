This story focuses on the life and actions of King Alfred, as recorded by his chaplain Asser. Additional details about the Athelney period come from later chroniclers, including a sign from St. Cuthberht and the names of the herdsman and nobles hiding in the fen. Alfred entrusted his first fleet to certain Vikings, likely Norse warriors who were either followers of Rolf Ganger or independent rovers driven from Norway by Harald Fairhair. The presence of Norse contingents with English forces during this time was common. The story incorporates historic details from Bishop Clifford's identifications, linking to real locations like Ethandune and Kynwith Castle. The narrative also includes the burning of Alfred's supposed father's hall, events from the Orkney period sourced from Sagas, and the final battles against Danish forces.|"[""1.

Rognvald, a cowardly man, was cursed for slaying Vemund, the husband of a brave woman. Despite the growls of his men, the Jarl stopped any further harm. Troubled and discontent, Rognvald left with his ships, feeling ill at ease for the men he lost. The widow's daughter was urged to remember his face for future vengeance. Harald Fairhair's reign brought new laws that caused unrest. Einar, one of Rognvald's sons, took the viking path to reclaim lost lands. The widow's daughter, skilled in weapons, joined Einar's ship, seeking revenge for her father's death. Together, they raided and fought, eventually facing Harald Fairhair's sons. After a series of events, she sailed with Einar to Norway, seeking answers from King Harald. Upon her return, she found her mother's town destroyed by Danish vikings.

"When we returned to Kirkwall, I shared all my experiences and learnings with the jarl and he expressed deep sorrow upon hearing about my mother's passing. He spoke words that endeared him to me even more. Soon, he mentioned Harald, who could arrive anytime. ""We cannot battle Norway,"" he explained, ""thus, we must relocate to the mainland and wait until Harald grows weary of pursuing us. He likely seeks scatt payments from our islands, using force if necessary. He may try to fine us and then establish a yearly tribute for the jarldom."" The jarl swiftly called a meeting of all Orkney folk who held him in high regard, and they followed his instructions, making the town appear impoverished. In three days, we departed, leaving behind only the appearance of destitute traders. Our journey led us southward to Caithness and then westward along the Sutherland coast to collect scatt for the year. Jarl Sigurd's conquest of these lands and his demise in a Sutherland firth were recounted, underscoring the Orkneys' history with the region. After a week of sailing, we sought refuge in that firth, anchoring in its sheltered hills. The day was memorable as a strange sound, akin to thunder, approached and surrounded us, causing a heavy, silent blow to the ship. The waters of the firth churned, and the air filled with the cries of startled birds. After"|"[""1.

The chieftain appeared troubled, rightly so, for approaching the mound housing an enraged spirit was no trivial task. Positioned high up the firth, it was beyond the ships' reach. Einar, however, displayed remarkable bravery. Despite the crew's apprehension, one man, Kolgrim the Tall, remained unfazed, sitting casually on the mast step. As they rowed towards Sigurd's resting place, the eerie silence and scorching heat enveloped them. The mound's base bore a fresh scar, revealing a stone-built doorway into the grave's depths. The sight struck fear into their hearts, prompting a swift retreat back to the safety of their ships. Yet, a strange boldness compelled one of them to consider returning, driven by a morbid curiosity to confront the unknown, even when gripped by fear.|"[""1.

Kolgrim silently followed me. As we neared the mound, I dared to call out, emboldened by the hero's seeming peace. I desired the sword the jarl spoke of and approached the tomb's entrance.

I bravely entered the dark passage, the sound of the whetstone against the sword behind me echoing. The narrow stone walls made me stoop, feeling my way with one hand. As I advanced, the darkness enveloped me, but I pressed on. Five steps in, I reached the inner doorway where Jarl Sigurd lay. The chamber was quiet, filled with the scent of peat. Stepping forward, I unknowingly trod on dry bones, overcoming my fear. In the chamber, Sigurd lay peacefully on his carven chair, as if asleep after battle. His sword, shield, and spears surrounded him, a sight of solemn peace. As I reached for his sword, I noticed his serene face, resting in eternal slumber, a warrior at rest.|"['1.

I took the jarl's sword, raising his hand and mine together. The hilt slipped from his fingers, and the sword became mine. Feeling grateful, I promised to honor his memory. I replaced his sword with mine, and he gave me a ring. Leaving softly into the sunshine, I found Kolgrim weeping. The mound was closed, as if freshly made.

"After returning from Sigurd's grave mound, Ranald was met with disbelief and awe by his companions. They marveled at the jarl's sword girt to him and the golden ring on his hand. Despite his reticence, the scalds weaved tales of his bravery. Ranald was gifted a great ship by Einar, laden with significance. Choosing his crew, he appointed Thord as shipmaster and Kolgrim as marshal. Kolgrim, in a show of respect, addressed Ranald as ""master"" since their encounter with Sigurd.

We set sail from the firth heading north when a ship approached us. It was not fleeing but coming to join our fleet. The messenger onboard bore a message from King Harald in peace. The messenger, Thiodolf, explained that the king intended to fine the islands for Halfdan's death and return them to Einar. Einar, cautious, sent me to meet the king. Harald, a majestic figure, had a commanding presence. His golden hair and piercing eyes gave him a kingly aura. He welcomed me warmly, acknowledging my lineage. The king promised to respond the next day. That night, a feast was held in my honor, and the scalds sang of King Harald's valor.

The men cheered when I gave Thiodolf the bracelet, and Harald glanced at me. Maybe I had given too much, but Einar said a good scald deserves a good reward. Thiodolf was known as the best in Norway. The feast in Einar's hall was pleasant, but sitting as a guest felt strange. The next morning, I met with the king about Einar's business. Harald suggested I stay a day or two.

They departed, and I summoned a few men to fetch their companions from the town and the guest house where we were staying. Meanwhile, Kolgrim readied the ship for an immediate departure. Suddenly, a commotion erupted at the wharf near the town, with men rushing towards it. I heard my name called from one side and that of Eric, the king's young son, from the other. Just as I prepared to intervene, my men emerged victorious from the scuffle, cheering as they approached me. Observing a ship being boarded, I noticed it was too late to hinder our departure. Thiodolf and his men arrived, presenting me with gifts from Harald, who praised my successful mission. Harald had sent armor and other provisions, acknowledging the danger Eric posed.

Now, Ranald had to part ways with his father, who believed it was best for him to seek his own path as Harald was too powerful for them. Ranald's father chose to stay in Orkney in peace, realizing that it wasn't fitting for a king's son to lead a passive life at a jarl's table. He encouraged Ranald to venture across the seas to make a name and perhaps a kingdom for himself. Despite feeling lonely after his father's departure, Ranald set sail towards Ireland, where he hoped to establish his own kingdom. As he journeyed through the English Channel, a fierce gale forced them to seek refuge on the French shore. When the storm passed, they encountered a peculiar fleet approaching, including unfamiliar large ships that seemed intent on intercepting them.

We could encounter the Danes unexpectedly, unsure of the outcome. It was clear they did not anticipate Alfred's fleet gathering. Hoping to catch them off guard, we sent a swift Norse cutter to scout along the shore at night. As we neared Poole Harbour, we reduced sail to avoid detection. The wind shifted, hinting at the Danes' potential emergence. At dawn, the cliffs of Swanage loomed, with the Danish ships heading towards us. Aligning our ships for battle, we charged towards the Danes, hoisting our flags. The enemy, initially oblivious, soon realized the impending attack. Amidst chaos on their decks, Alfred's ships engaged, swiftly overpowering the Danes. Panic ensued among the enemy fleet as they fled, leaving us victorious.|"['1.

We pursued the Danish ships, and after a fierce battle, we emerged victorious. As we sailed away from the harbor with the rising tide and gusty winds, signaling a brewing storm, our fleet scattered. Thord, the leader, turned back towards home, with the rest of the Saxons following suit. I gathered my men onto the captured ships, waiting for Thord to lead us back to Poole Harbour. The storm hit hard, causing two Danish ships to wreck near the shore rather than face the wrath of the sea. Seeking refuge, we entered the calm waters of Poole inlet, greeted warmly by Saxon fishermen. We were treated to a feast by Odda, who praised our efforts in the battle, though I humbly deflected the credit. An idea struck me to gather intelligence from Wareham, and despite initial reluctance, Odda agreed, trusting my Norse heritage to navigate the Danish territory safely.|"['1.

During a wild gale under a full moon, Kolgrim and I sought shelter by a shed, watching the clouds break apart in the night sky. As we waited for a fisherman to ready his boat, the winds howled, bending trees and whitening the water. The fisherman, eager to aid us against the Danes, swiftly rowed us up the haven towards Wareham town. Approaching the town, we passed broken ships and a ruined bridge, signs of the Danes' presence. Disguised among the townspeople, we overheard news of the large Danish army heading to Exeter. Regretful for not bringing our ships, we realized the missed opportunity to confront the Danes.|"['1.

We had to return the way we came as the storm raged too fiercely for us to take the boat to Poole. The gale was at its peak, thatch flying off roofs. The sea was rough, making the boat trip impossible. We decided to journey by road to reach Odda in Wareham before the Danes discovered their hasty escape. Leaving Wareham seemed risky, but the broken bridge indicated no one had fled the area hastily. A fisherman ferried us across, assuring us of his safety. We embarked on foot, staying near the shore road, wary of any encounters. Passing a farmstead, we spotted two horses tied outside. My comrade suggested taking them, as they might have been stolen by Danes. With swords drawn, we approached the horses, ready to ride off swiftly.|"['1.

"I could not reply, and she gazed at me intently. The moon shone brightly, casting our silhouettes against it. The wind, salty and sharp, blew against her face. It was a dire situation for the maiden, and I was at a loss for words or actions. Leaving her exposed to the Saxons was not an option, nor could I take her to Poole. To calm her fears, I quickly decided on a plan. ""No need for panic. We'll ride to Wareham, hand her to a fisherman, and then head to Poole unnoticed.""

At the riverside, the fisher slept peacefully despite the roaring flood tide. Kolgrim struggled to wake him. Feeling responsible for the lady's safety, I decided to take her to a secure place. I had a new plan in mind. I instructed Kolgrim to stay while I ventured into town. The lady, Thora, noticed my distinct speech and regal helm. She ran to meet a horseman, Osmund, who joyfully embraced her. I concealed myself in the shadows as they departed. Concerned about Thora's well-being, I ignited a fire on the boats to distract any pursuers. Thora's courage impressed me, as she seemed certain of my loyalty to King Alfred.

I waited for the wind to change direction so I could sail westward. Odda led his men ashore, marching toward Wareham and then after the Danes. They aimed to avoid fighting due to the Danes' overwhelming numbers but aimed to protect the land. Meanwhile, the Norsemen left with their plunder, heading to join Rolf Ganger in France. Although they could have been a powerful ally, I was content to see them go. I admired Odda's leadership and felt a strong bond with him. As we sailed to the river Exe, we received good news about the king's successful strategy against the Danes. Despite the success, the Saxon crews quickly left the ships to return home, frustrating me. I contemplated sailing to Ireland due to the lack of support. As I sat on my ship, Thord, Kolgrim, and Harek the scald kept busy while I grumbled about the Saxons' behavior.

Inside the grand tent was like a circular room, carpeted and hung with tapestries in a manner I had never seen before. Many nobles, dressed lavishly, were present, gathered around a raised area near the door where the king sat on a throne in full regal attire. As we entered from the bright sunlight into the cool shade, I was momentarily blinded, but Kolgrim, quick-eyed, tugged at my cloak. The king descended from his throne towards us, adorned in gilded armor under a long blue cloak trimmed with ermine. He wore a crown, but no helmet. It was evident that Godred, as he named himself, was indeed the king, as the bard had correctly surmised. A jovial atmosphere enveloped the tent as the king greeted us warmly. Laughter filled the air, and the king returned to his throne, expressing gratitude for our naval victory. Subsequently, Danish lords arrived to converse with the king, led by Jarl Osmund. They were elegantly attired but unarmed. Invited to the king's banquet, they departed, leaving Alfred to address my men.

My journey with King Alfred came to an end, leaving me content. My men were also pleased, knowing they would have positions of command. I met many noble Saxons before peace was made with the Danes in Exeter. I particularly liked Ethered, the young ealdorman of Mercia, and Ethelnoth, the Somerset ealdorman. Riding with King Alfred to find his cousin Neot was a joyous experience. We journeyed through the wild Dartmoor, a desolate place filled with outlaws. The king's light-heartedness and joy were infectious as we rode armed through the countryside. We rested at a guest house on the fringes of Dartmoor before continuing our journey. In the evening, we hunted bustards with hawks and greyhounds, enjoying the freedom and thrill of the chase.|"[""1.

It was odd if I thought of anything but the game. I knew two riders were nearby, a bit wide on either side, but behind me. We chased and caught a bird, realizing we had lost the Saxons and were together as Vikings. It didn't bother us, for one expects such separations, and Ethelnoth had his own boundaries. We continued and found another bird, which we captured. Then we turned, and a heron rose from a stream below us, a prey we couldn't ignore. I released the falcon, and we were captivated by the breathtaking sight of the hawk and heron soaring high above, battling for supremacy. The heron eventually succumbed, and the falcon swooped down to claim its victory. We rode back leisurely, guided by the setting sun, until darkness fell. Lost in the mist, we settled down to wait for morning under a rock, with the dogs roaming in the fog. Eventually, we spotted a red light in the valley and decided to follow the brook towards it, hoping to find shelter and food.|['1.

We decided to leave our comfortable resting place by the stream and venture down its rocky banks. The mist thickened, but we saw a red glow ahead, indicating a camp of Cornish tin traders. As we approached, we heard unfamiliar voices and a drumbeat followed by a war cry. Sensing danger, we drew our swords. Suddenly, shadowy figures emerged, surrounding us. In the chaos, my companions were overpowered, and I was bound and dragged to the traders' fire. They were a fierce group, clad in animal skins and wielding rough weapons. I feared for our lives, especially upon seeing the golden rings on their arms. As they deliberated our fate, my brave companion began singing ancient verses, which startled and distracted them. Despite the perilous situation, his courage shone through, giving us a glimmer of hope amidst the uncertainty.|"['1.

I watched as the savage men prepared for my turn to dance around the fire. The drumbeat started again, and they untied me. I struggled like Harek, but it was useless. They led me to the circle, and I waited for the right moment. When the two men were about to grab me, I extended my hands to meet theirs, catching them off guard. The man on my right held me firmly, but the other man unknowingly took my hand. My heart raced with hope as I saw my plan working.

I continued through the ring, fearing dizziness. Being the tallest, I matched the chant's pace, eyeing the man to my right. We circled past the dolmen, glimpsing Helmbiter's sword. Crossing the fire, chaos ensued when I broke free, wielding Helmbiter. The wild men, armed and enraged, encircled me. They hurled spears, but I fended them off.

In daylight, the mysterious place revealed itself with purple hillsides covered in heather surrounding a dolmen atop a rise. Encircling the dolmen were standing stones akin to those in the Orkneys. Despite the eerie setting, the wild folk who had ambushed them had vanished. The only remnants left were the tools used to bind them, some food and drink, and the bodies of greyhounds. Among the slain was a chief adorned with gold, whose treasures were claimed by the survivors. As they continued their journey, they encountered an old woman who informed them of their solitude. Reassured, they rode towards the king, who speculated that the wild men might be ancient Welsh or Cornish dwellers. Kolgrim, however, believed their encounter to be of supernatural origin, as he fashioned a sword sheath from the drumhead they found.|['1.

We journeyed quietly with Alfred, a king of wisdom and faith. Neot, his cousin, dwelt in a simple village, offering counsel to the king. Neot's wisdom shaped Alfred's haughty ways into humility, making him beloved by his people. Alfred listened to all, even the lowliest, showing kindness and patience. Neot's guidance led Alfred to seek wisdom beyond earthly matters, singing words of profound insight. Harek, a thoughtful scald, was deeply moved by Alfred's songs, realizing the depth of wisdom they contained. Harek, who had lost his own beliefs, found solace in Alfred's words, recognizing a wisdom beyond mortal understanding.

"The unique song strife at Neot's hillside ended as the sun set, casting a peaceful atmosphere. Alfred bid farewell, and we retired to the village guest house. After spending ten days with Neot, we willingly accepted the ""prime signing,"" witnessed by Alfred, Ethelnoth, and Guerir. Although some misuse the cross for personal gain, we embraced it sincerely, eager to explore the new faith. Returning to Exeter, we felt a sense of belonging under King Alfred's leadership. The city bustled with activity, and we encountered unexpected acquaintances like Osmund, a Danish jarl, and his daughter, Thora.

That was a wonderful Yule for me, but overshadowed by the tale of the most terrible Twelfth Night in England's history. I learned valuable lessons while sitting in the church with Harek, listening to the bright frost and snow outside. The town was full of thanes and their families for Alfred's Yule celebration, despite the ruins left by the recent Danish occupation. The day of Twelfth Night broke bright and fair, with a crisp frost and clear sunshine. I asked the king if I could take the Danish jarl for a ride beyond the town, ensuring his safety. We rode northward through deserted farmsteads until we reached a hilltop. There, we discovered a slain farm thrall, indicating danger ahead. Three armed men saw us and quickly mounted their horses, ready for confrontation.|"[""1.

We were caught off guard, dressed in simple jerkins with only our swords. A group of riders approached, and as tensions rose, I was ready to defend. A man of rank led them, ignoring us. Suddenly, swords were drawn. I swiftly dismounted one, and my comrade took down another. These were no mere wanderers; they were Danes on a mission. The jarl and his men were wary, sensing trouble. The Danes were on the move, a breakaway group aiming to surprise Alfred. Realizing the danger, we decided to act swiftly and silently. We seized their horses and weapons, preventing any word from reaching their main force. With a nod, we let them flee, knowing we had outwitted them.

When we reached the hilltop from where we had recently ridden, we glimpsed back and saw a black speck growing larger on the horizon. It was the Danish army on the move towards Chippenham. With only hours before their arrival, we raced back to warn the town. Alfred, surrounded by his council, was enraged by the breach of peace. The captives were brought before him, and the situation seemed dire. In a moment of courage, I freed the hostages despite the risks. As we hurried to safety, I bid farewell to Osmund and Thora, knowing they couldn't stay among the Danes.

I was relieved and quickly prepared everything for Thora's comfort on what might be a long journey. We rode after the king towards Glastonbury, with the Danes close behind us. Some Danes tried to cut off the king, so we took back roads that Heregar knew, stopping at isolated houses. When we reached Glastonbury, the king was missing, and no one knew where he was. We hurried to Bridgwater, passing through unseen dangers. The Danes followed us closely, even coming to the town's edge. But we were safe for a while, protected by the natural defenses of the land. The area was surrounded by the sea, hills, and rivers, making it difficult for enemies to approach. We hoped to find King Alfred safe in the fortress at Taunton, but he was nowhere to be found.

Soon, the wind changed direction, and heavy rain melted the snow, causing floods in the lowlands. Thankfully, the Danes spared towns and farms, seeking shelter from the storm. The gale lasted for three days before the wind shifted back north, bringing even harsher frost. The locals predicted a prolonged cold spell. However, there was no news of the missing king, raising fears that he might have been harmed unknowingly. A loyal servant, Dudda, shared a rumor about a mysterious lord hiding in the fens near Long Hill. Remembering the king's interest in the area, they set out to search for him, armed with hope and determination. Riding south, they crossed the ridge overlooking the vast and untamed marshes, believing that the Danes had not yet ventured into those treacherous lands.|['1.

As I gazed at the frozen landscape of Stanmoor, with its icy lakes and snow-covered bogs, it seemed unlikely that anyone could hide there. Dudda mentioned hidden islets in the wooded areas, so we searched the lower hills and the edge of the fenland. We asked locals if they knew of anyone hiding, but to no avail. Hope dwindled until we reached Lyng village near Bridgwater and Taunton. Splitting up, Heregar and I sought information from the villagers. Riding down a snowy lane, we approached a cottage. An old woman emerged, seemingly oblivious to our presence. She hammered a nail into a footprint muttering a spell. She indicated the dense alder thickets across the frozen land, where a thane named Godred resided. The old woman shared a spell to counter ill intentions, revealing that she mistook a sad-faced man for the king.|['1.

Alfred and his companions journeyed through the frozen fen, navigating treacherous paths and thickets until they reached a mere. There, they encountered fishermen with unused nets and eel spears due to the thick ice. Kolgrim, puzzled by the oversight, prepared to break the ice for fishing. Guided by Ethelnoth, they traversed the hazardous terrain towards a humble cottage in a clearing, the dwelling of Denewulf the herdsman, the king's thrall. The secluded island of Athelney, surrounded by dense thickets and waterlogged land, provided a hidden refuge for the king and his nobles. Welcomed by sheepdogs and Denewulf, Alfred, skilled in arrow making, greeted his companions warmly.

"At that moment, the dogs barked excitedly at the door, signaling the arrival of friends with cheerful voices outside. Ethered stumbled in, carrying a heavy basket filled with a variety of fish - lean green pike, golden pike, and red-finned roach.

After all the plans were made, Heregar and I rode back to his home and spread the word that the king was safe. However, we were forbidden to reveal his location yet. Only thanes were allowed on the island with him. As more athelings arrived, the island became a secret refuge. We worked tirelessly, felling timber and building earthworks around Stanmoor hill. King Alfred insisted on perfection, stating that it must be the finest fort in all Wessex. Many skilled workers joined us, creating a bustling camp. Despite the hard life, Alfred's cheerfulness lifted our spirits. Hunting, fishing, and snaring wild fowl provided sustenance. The frost thawed, and the Danes gathered nearby. Alfred devised a plan to draw them out. We launched nightly attacks, harassing the Danish posts until they believed we aimed to claim Edington height. One night, armed and eager, we stealthily approached the Danish post on Othery island, ready for battle.|"[""1.

We approached the camp cautiously, hiding among the trees near the tents, as the hilltop was exposed. The sight of the lit tents with sounds of merriment made us chuckle quietly, feeling like mischievous schoolboys. Despite the serious game of war ahead of us, we felt a sense of freedom and excitement akin to schoolboys released for the day. As we neared the camp, we devised a plan to sabotage the tents in a playful yet daring manner. With quick and precise strikes, we cut the tent ropes, causing the canvas and skins to collapse on the unsuspecting Danes. Amid the chaos and confusion, we swiftly moved through the camp, leaving behind a trail of fallen tents and startled foes. Despite outnumbering us, the Danes were caught off guard, and we managed to escape unscathed, leaving them in disarray. Our swift and unexpected attack left the Danes bewildered and unable to retaliate effectively. As we made our way back to safety, the camp erupted in commotion, but we were already disappearing into the cover of the fen, leaving behind a scene of havoc and panic.

During March, with thoughts of my ships in mind, I was concerned about the Danes possibly crossing the Severn sea to join their kin at Edington. Guthrum, the king of East Anglia, had also summoned warriors to aid him. Some blamed him for treachery, but Alfred did not. I rode to Bridgwater to check on the ships being built there. Kolgrim, eager to spy on the Danes, planned to go disguised as a gleeman. Alfred sent messengers to Odda, gathering men for a possible battle. With Odda's arrival, we prepared for a confrontation with Hubba's forces. Despite being outnumbered, we were ready to defend. The evening brought a sense of unease as we awaited the impending conflict, knowing that victory could turn the tide in Alfred's favor.|"[""1.

Heregar rode in on his white horse and saw Osmund, asking about the business they had discussed with the jarl. Thora sat alone, looking up as people entered. She expressed her worries about the upcoming battle, torn between her loyalty to her friends and her kin. King Ranald reassured her that peace might come sooner if her people were driven off. Thora felt conflicted, feeling sorrow no matter the outcome. Ranald promised to wear something in the fight for her, to show he was thinking of her. Etheldreda gave him a glove to wear in the fight, pinning it with a golden brooch. Ranald then joined the chiefs at the fort, waiting for the battle to begin. Hubba's forces surprised them, outnumbering them. The battle went poorly for them, as Hubba's men landed and advanced towards Cannington hill.|"['1.

We fought bravely for an hour, but our untrained men on the flanks began to falter. The battle turned desperate in the center, with only a handful of us holding against Hubba's seasoned warriors. We managed to break free, with Ethelnoth urging King Alfred to retreat to safety at Bridgwater. As the Danes charged, we stood firm, preventing a rout. With the king gone, we faced the enemy alone. Seeing the Danes scatter, we devised a plan to reclaim our banner. We ambushed them in a narrow lane, surprising them and causing confusion. We then retreated to a fortified hilltop, defended by ancient British fortifications. Inside, we faced three times our number of Danes, but the terrain and defenses favored us. Despite the challenges of water scarcity and limited provisions, we held our ground with determination and resilience.|"[""1.

Etheldreda, Alswythe, and Thora tended and comforted the few remaining people on the hilltop, while I watched with Odda. As dusk approached, Odda gave me twenty men to fetch water. We used anything we could find as containers and managed to bring back water safely. When the men went again, Danes followed them back, but we defended our supplies. The next day, we hoped for reinforcements from Bridgwater, but none came. With no food left, we were at the mercy of the Danes. A parley was offered by Hubba, but we refused to surrender. In the early morning, a maiden, Etheldreda, approached us, ready to fight alongside us. It was time to make a stand, even if it meant facing the Danes in battle.|['1.

Heregar recounted a vivid dream where Bishop Eahlstan foretold victory by the low tide. As the Danes stirred, Etheldreda inspired the Saxon warriors with courage and patriotism. Observing the Danes' movements, they noticed a significant number heading towards the ships. This presented an opportunity for the Saxons to strike. Etheldreda was urged to stay within the fort for safety. Odda rallied the men, preparing them for a fierce battle. The wounded were secured, and a strategic plan was devised. With the women safely sent off, the Saxons made a bold move, overwhelming the enemy forces at Cannington hill.

We marched downhill towards Hubba, the Danish leader. His warriors were in formation, ready for battle. I suggested forming a wedge to break through their line. With axes in hand, we charged. The clash of weapons filled the air as we fought fiercely. The Saxons roared with determination, driving the Danes back. Despite the chaos, our wedge held firm. Men fell, but we stood strong. The Danes began to retreat, realizing they were outmatched. We pushed forward, forcing them to flee towards their ships. Victory was in sight as Hubba's defeated expression told the tale.

"Out of the fort emerged our injured soldiers, a group of fifty or sixty men, along with villagers armed with whatever they could gather from the place where we had pushed back the first Danes.

Alfred and his men knelt before the bishop as he raised his hand, praying for peace and blessing upon all, without boasting or hate. After the blessing, the great host began their march towards Edington, following a road that climbs the Polden Hills. Guthrum's camp overlooked Alfred's lands, and the Danes had fortified Bridgwater. Alfred's forces strategically moved towards Edington, while Odda's men appeared to attack the town from another side. Guthrum, wary of underestimating the Saxons, gathered his whole force to march towards the threatened town. When Alfred's forces reached Edington, the Danes had left, and a cheer rose from the Saxons as they lined the ridge, ready for battle. The Danes, hearing the Saxon cheer, hesitated, realizing they were surrounded, and a fierce battle ensued from noon onwards, with the Saxons defending the hilltop against the Danes' relentless attacks.|"['1.

Alfred rode confidently with his men from post to post, facing the final attack by Guthrum. As the battle unfolded on Edington hillside, Alfred's arm brought victory time and again. The archers stood ready, fighting under the banner of the king they loved. With a mighty roar, Alfred led the charge against the Danes, who were taken by surprise. The lines clashed in a fierce battle until the Danes faltered, giving way to Alfred's forces. Guthrum's men retreated in defeat as Alfred pressed forward, leading his shield wall to victory. The Danes were routed, and Alfred's men pursued them relentlessly. After the battle, Alfred tended to the wounded and prayed for the fallen. Despite attempts by Guthrum to rally his men, they fled to safety, closely pursued by Alfred's forces. The Danes made a hasty retreat to Bridgwater, leaving behind their fallen comrades. Alfred, wise in victory, ensured the wounded were cared for and the clergy tended to the injured. The Danes, desperate to escape, prepared to sail away, but Alfred's forces were vigilant, preventing their escape.|"[""1.

The rising tide posed a threat as Guthrum and his chiefs could escape. To block their path, a plan was devised to sink an old vessel across the channel. With quick thinking, the ship was sabotaged just in time before the enemies' ship arrived. A fierce battle ensued, but the Danes were outnumbered and defeated.

Alfred's plan to defeat the Danes was working well. The Danes were too scared to make any moves against him. They were low on food and divided in their opinions, leading to fights among themselves. Alfred sent a message to the Danes under a flag of truce, offering to hear their terms for peace. When Guthrum refused to come out and negotiate, Alfred decided to involve Jarl Osmund, who could move between the camps safely. Heregar and his companion rode to find Jarl Osmund, crossing the ford at Combwich. However, they found the place deserted, except for Lady Alswythe and a few servants. Thora had left for Taunton with Lady Etheldreda. Despite the disappointment, they informed Jarl Osmund of Alfred's desire to negotiate with Guthrum through him. Jarl Osmund seemed listless, waiting for his next move. Realizing he had no role in the negotiations, Heregar decided to ride to Taunton to see Thora, accompanied by Kolgrim. Thora was troubled by thoughts of Alfred's plans for Heregar, fearing they might separate them. Etheldreda assured them of her support and hope for a peaceful future.|"[""1.

In the town, the Danes faced great difficulties as they were surrounded, making it impossible to receive any supplies. Osmund had visited Guthrum, and talks suggested the siege might end with the Danes surrendering. Alfred, showing mercy, proposed that if he could name twelve hostages, the rest would be freed, and Guthrum would rule East Anglia as his under-king. Alfred also insisted that for any brotherhood to form, the Danes must accept Christianity. Reluctantly, Osmund agreed to deliver the message to Guthrum, with Alfred emphasizing the importance of speaking plainly. Despite his fears and hesitation, Osmund agreed to go alone, showing his commitment to his faith and Alfred's cause.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Alfred propose as a condition for ending the siege?\nA) Surrender unconditionally\nB) Name twelve hostages\nC) Pay a ransom\nD) Convert to Islam\nE) None of the above', 'Question 2:\nWhat did Alfred insist the Danes must accept for any brotherhood to form?\nA) Paganism\nB) Christianity\nC) Atheism\nD) Buddhism\nE) Judaism', ""Question 3:\nWhy did Osmund agree to deliver the message to Guthrum despite his fears and hesitation?\nA) He wanted to join the Danes\nB) He was promised a reward\nC) He wanted to become the under-king\nD) To show his commitment to his faith and Alfred's cause\nE) None of the above"", 'Question 4:\nWhat was the outcome of the talks between Osmund and Guthrum?\nA) Guthrum surrendered\nB) Osmund became the under-king\nC) The siege was lifted\nD) The Danes accepted Christianity\nE) None of the above', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Alfred emphasize the importance of to Osmund before he delivered the message to Guthrum?\nA) Speaking loudly\nB) Speaking in code\nC) Speaking plainly\nD) Speaking in riddles\nE) Speaking in a foreign language', ""Question 6:\nWhat did Guthrum agree to do as part of the proposed agreement with Alfred?\nA) Convert to Christianity\nB) Name twelve hostages\nC) Surrender unconditionally\nD) Rule East Anglia as Alfred's under-king\nE) None of the above""]"|"['B) Name twelve hostages', 'B) Christianity', ""D) To show his commitment to his faith and Alfred's cause"", 'E) None of the above', 'C) Speaking plainly', ""D) Rule East Anglia as Alfred's under-king""]"
Alfred, the king, wishes to treat Guthrum as a brother by resolving the conflict between the Danes and Saxons through Guthrum's conversion to Christianity. Surprisingly, instead of anger, a thoughtful silence falls among the chiefs. Guthrum, intrigued, listens as the speaker continues, presenting two warriors willing to adopt Alfred's faith. The speaker recalls the martyrs who died for their beliefs, like King Edmund and Bishop Humbert, emphasizing the strength of Christian men. Guthrum acknowledges the courage shown by the Christian defenders and agrees to consider Alfred's proposal. Ultimately, Guthrum and thirty chiefs agree to be baptized, marking a significant turning point in the conflict.

Alfred went to his house at Aller, amidst the marshes south of Athelney, days after peace was made. They saved the house and church by annoying the Danes, who feared them. Preparations were made for Alfred to baptize Guthrum. Meanwhile, Osmund and Ranald visited Odda's house in Taunton, telling Thora about their wait for Guthrum. Thora, eager to embrace Christianity, feared Odin's wrath. Osmund comforted her, and they rode to Heregar's house during a thunderstorm. They heard Odin's wild hunt, signaling his defeat. A mysterious rider led them, guiding them through the storm.|"[""1.

Riding downhill, we reached a rocky area where our horses stumbled. Suddenly, a man appeared, holding a sword with a blue flame at its point. One-eyed and fierce, he vanished amid thunder and lightning. Osmund shouted, and a stone rolled down the hill with a crash. Seeking shelter from the storm, we continued our journey, marked by the terror we faced. Returning to Aller, Neot heard of our encounter with Odin during the wild hunt. Neot believed Satan tried to harm us before baptism, while Sigehelm and Guerir thought we faced Odin or Satan himself. Later, Guthrum and his comrades were baptized by Sigehelm, with Alfred naming Guthrum Athelstan. Celebrations followed, signifying a victory for Alfred. The Danes departed, leaving behind the work of rebuilding the land.|['1.

After the host left, we returned to Taunton. Alfred gathered his Witan to organize things. Before dismissing the levies, he asked me to recruit men for his fleet. It was easy as seafarers from ruined coastal towns sought a place in the king's fleet. The Parret-mouth men and a fisherman from Wareham were the first to join. The Witan appointed me leader of the Wessex sea levies, with the rank of an English ealdorman, to oversee ship needs along the coast. Alfred, my friend, offered this role, which I gladly accepted. I focused on sea matters while Alfred handled inland affairs. In his chamber, he worked on plans, finding solace in small tasks. We discussed Roman naval training methods, and I wondered about Jarl Osmund's whereabouts. Alfred teased me about maidens, hinting at potential matches in Wessex.|"['1.
