In the magical land of Oz, Glinda the Good Sorceress sat in her palace court with her maids of honor. The palace was grand, made of rare marbles with tinkling fountains and a view of rose-hued fields and fruit-bearing trees. As her maids worked and played, an object approached the castle gate, carrying Princess Ozma and Dorothy. Dressed in simple white gowns, they arrived for a visit. Ozma and Dorothy, carefree and joyful, were welcomed warmly by Glinda. They discussed the happiness of the people and the welfare of the land.

In the Land of Oz, an impending conflict between the Skeezers and the Flatheads has caught the attention of Dorothy and the Sorceress. The Skeezers, who live on a Magic Isle in a lake, and the Flatheads, residing in a mountain basin, are mysterious tribes with magical abilities. Concerned about the potential trouble, Ozma, the Ruler of Oz, feels it is her duty to ensure the well-being of all her subjects, even those unknown to her. Despite the Sorceress's warning of potential danger, Ozma remains determined to intervene and prevent the conflict. Dorothy raises concerns about Ozma's safety, but the Princess remains optimistic that diplomacy and reason may prevail in resolving the dispute peacefully.

The soldier with the green whiskers is afraid of his gun and wouldn't fight. One soldier can't face two hundred and one Flatheads and Skeezers. Glinda suggested sending the Wizard of Oz to tell them fighting is against Oz laws. If they refuse, Glinda would have to punish them. Ozma decided to go peacefully to settle the dispute. Glinda thought it best for Ozma to go alone as she could win hearts with her presence. Ozma agreed, believing she could handle the situation kindly. Glinda was unsure but saw no better way. Ozma wanted to leave immediately to prevent war. Dorothy, not a fairy, might face serious dangers. Ozma and Dorothy would head to the Emerald City and prepare to leave the next day.|"['1.

Dorothy's life in Oz, as a Princess under Ozma's protection, shielded her from harm. However, being mortal, she was still vulnerable to danger. To safeguard her, Glinda gave Dorothy a ring that would alert her in times of peril. With the ring on her finger, Dorothy embarked on a journey with Ozma, accompanied by the intelligent Scarecrow. Their destination was the remote Gillikin Country, a mysterious land in the northwestern part of Oz. Dorothy, bound by secrecy, refrained from sharing details with her friends Trot and Betsy. As they set off in the Red Wagon with the magical Sawhorse, the adventure to the Lake of the Skeezers began, with the Scarecrow assuming temporary leadership in Ozma's absence.|"['1.

Ozma apologized to Dorothy as they rode in the Red Wagon, expressing regret for not knowing more about the Land of Oz due to her duties at the palace. Dorothy reassured her that they would learn about the Skeezers and Flatheads on their journey. Dorothy, equipped with the Nome King's Magic Belt and Glinda's Magic Ring, and Ozma with her Silver Wand, ventured northward on the Sawhorse. As they encountered a web-like barrier woven by giant spiders, they navigated through it, only to be confronted by the Spider King. The Spider King attempted to capture them, but Dorothy's Magic Belt protected her. Ozma used her Silver Wand to ward off the Spider King's attack. The Spider King challenged them to escape the magic web his people had created. Ozma realized the extent of magic in the land and the defiance of her laws by the spiders.|"[""1.

Ozma and Dorothy found a web of great strength that blocked their path. Despite its delicate appearance, it resisted all their attempts to break through. As they explored further, they stumbled upon a shallow pool with a green crab. Dorothy noticed the crab's sharp claws and had an idea. The crab offered to cut the web in exchange for being turned white, as white crabs were rare and feared by the purple spiders in the area. Ozma used her magic wand to turn the crab white, and it slowly cut through the web. They barely escaped the pursuing spiders and reached the top of a hill overlooking a mist-filled valley. Ozma called out to the Mist Maids, fairy-like creatures who appeared from the mist to embrace them and swiftly transport them to the other side of the hill.|['1.

They climbed the bank and discovered a beautiful plain stretching for miles. Fragrant wildflowers dotted the grass, bushes bore blossoms and fruits, and stately trees enhanced the landscape. Despite the beauty, there were no signs of life. A row of palms bordered the plain, with a peculiar hill rising like a mountain. The sides were steep, oblong, and flat-topped. Ozma suggested camping as night fell before reaching the hill. With a wave of her silver wand, a tent appeared, furnished with a table set for two, beds, and lamps. Dorothy marveled at the magic, wishing everyone had such powers. Ozma explained that the joy of life comes from working hard and helping others, not just fulfilling desires with magic.|['1.

"""Yes, it is truly amazing,"" she agreed. ""Not all fairies possess that kind of magic, but some fairies have abilities that truly astound me. I believe this is what keeps us humble and modest - the knowledge that our magical talents are unique to each of us. I'm happy that I don't know everything, Dorothy, and that there are still mysteries in nature and intellect that leave me in awe."" Dorothy didn't fully grasp this concept, so she remained silent on the matter. Soon, they witnessed another marvel as their entire dining setup vanished in an instant. After an hour of storytelling and discussions, bedtime arrived. They settled into their cozy beds and quickly drifted off to sleep. As the morning sun illuminated the flat mountain, Dorothy and Ozma understood the long journey that lay ahead. They were greeted with a delightful breakfast before setting off towards the mountain. Glancing back, Dorothy noticed the fairy tent had vanished entirely. ""Glinda uses a stork chariot for travel,"" explained Ozma, ""but even she cannot conjure up all modes of transportation. Remember what I told you - no one possesses all powers."" ""I guess I should know that after living in Oz for so long,"" replied Dorothy, ""but since I can't perform any magic, I find it hard to comprehend how you, Glinda, and the Wizard do it.""

"""I believe I understand why the wall is invisible,"" she explained later. ""The Flatheads need to use the stairs to move up and down the mountain. If the wall was visible, strangers could easily find a way around it, rendering the wall useless. So, the Flatheads cleverly made the wall invisible to trap anyone who tried to pass. The wall must be thick and high, impossible to break through. Those who encounter it are forced to turn back."" Ozma and Dorothy navigated the invisible wall and found themselves in a passage with stairs that twisted and turned. Ozma's wand illuminated their path. The Flatheads had a unique way of alerting each other of intruders with ringing bells. Dorothy marveled at their cleverness and magic, feeling a mix of anxiety and fascination. As they emerged from the passage, they were met by a peculiar group of Flatheads with flat heads, big ears, and violet eyes, leaving Dorothy and Ozma in awe."|"[""1.

The costumes of the Flatheads were unique, made from metals found in their mountain. They cleverly crafted small discs of gold, silver, tin, and iron into trousers, jackets, skirts, and waists. The colorful metals were arranged in stripes and checks, creating gorgeous outfits resembling knights' armor. When the Flatheads realized the intruders were just two girls, they relaxed and allowed them to see the mountain's saucer-like peak. Led by a Flathead, Ozma and Dorothy were taken to meet the Supreme Dictator in the palace at the center of the saucer. The Dictator, distinguishable by his cunning expression, explained their democratic system where he is elected yearly as the Supreme Dictator. His nickname, Su-dic, stands for Supreme Dictator. He dismissed the guard to speak with the girls, revealing his knowledge of them and Ozma's reputation.|"[""1.

The Su-dic, a clever sorcerer, revealed to Princess Ozma and her companion the secret behind the intelligence of the Flatheads. Long ago, fairies gifted each Flathead a can of concentrated brains, making them as smart as anyone else. However, trouble arose when one Flathead tried to rebel, losing his brains as a consequence. The Su-dic's wife, a remarkable witch with four cans of brains, was transformed into a Golden Pig by the Skeezers, who also stole her brains. The Su-dic, confident in his powers, declared his plan to defeat the Skeezers and keep Princess Ozma captive until then. Despite the Su-dic's threats, Princess Ozma remained determined to overcome the challenges ahead.|"['1.

"Dorothy was surprised by the boldness and defiance of the beautiful girl who ruled Oz, a ruler everyone had always obeyed without question. Ozma, composed and dignified, addressed the Su-dic, ""You speak out of anger, without thinking. I came here to prevent war and make peace between you and the Skeezers. Magic in my realm requires my consent, and both the Flatheads and Skeezers have broken my laws."" The Su-dic demanded his wife back and fishing rights, but Ozma proposed a fair solution.

Dorothy was a swift runner and understood the situation well. Ozma had marked the grand stairway leading to the plain, guiding them directly. They dodged people in their path and even managed to outwit a few Flatheads. The Su-dic and his men chased after them but stumbled over a Golden Pig, giving the girls a head start. Ozma used her magic wand to light their way down the stairs, and they reached the bottom without slowing down. As they turned a corner, they evaded the Su-dic and his followers who were searching for them. Ozma suggested finding the Lake of the Skeezers to seek their help against the Flatheads. The girls discovered a beautiful lake with a glass building on an island. Ozma signaled the Skeezers by waving her handkerchief, and a steel arch extended toward them from the island, showing the unique way the Skeezers could travel across the water without boats.|['1.

Upon approaching what seemed to be a delicate steel footway bridge, Dorothy and Ozma hesitated, fearing its ability to support their weight. But with Ozma's encouragement, they embarked across the bridge. As they walked, the bridge started moving back to the island. Ozma cleverly realized they didn't need to walk and stood still, allowing the bridge to draw them into a glass-domed building. Inside, they found a vibrant village with colorful marble houses and well-kept streets. They were greeted by handsomely dressed young men on a marble platform. The platform then ascended through a square hole into the dome. They were escorted to a grand building where they met Queen Coo-ee-oh, who seemed proud and haughty. Despite the opulence, Dorothy sensed an underlying unhappiness among the Skeezers. Queen Coo-ee-oh, unaware of Ozma's authority, engaged in a tense conversation with the visitors.|['1.

Queen Coo-ee-oh of the Land of the Skeezers showed great disdain towards Ozma, claiming supremacy and refusing to defer to her or anyone else. Ozma, ruler of the Emerald City, aimed to prevent war between the Skeezers and the Flatheads. Despite Coo-ee-oh's arrogance, Ozma sought to make peace. The Queen accused Ozma of being an impostor and a troublemaker, asserting her power as a Krumbic Witch with greater magic. She declared her intent to keep Ozma and Princess Dorothy as prisoners on the island to prevent them from aiding the Flatheads. However, Princess Dorothy warned Coo-ee-oh of the consequences of her actions and her lack of knowledge about Ozma's true power.

Dorothy observed Ozma's actions with curiosity. To her surprise, Ozma chose to follow Lady Aurex instead of engaging with Queen Coo-ee-oh. Dorothy decided to follow them, giving a disdainful look to the oblivious Queen. Lady Aurex guided them to a beautiful marble house near the edge of the glass dome covering the village. Once inside, Lady Aurex explained that Queen Coo-ee-oh could hear everything spoken on the island, emphasizing the need to be cautious. Ozma, using her silver wand, created a magic circle to shield their conversation from the Queen's ears. Within this protected space, Lady Aurex shared the Skeezers' plight under the Queen's oppressive rule. Ozma, acknowledging her as the supreme Ruler, promised to address the Queen's tyranny and restore order among the Skeezers and Flatheads.

Coo-ee-oh was once the Queen of the Skeezers, but she had no magic powers to boast of. Despite this, the three Adepts were kind to her and taught the Skeezers many skills, like crafting beautiful clothes. However, Coo-ee-oh secretly envied the Adepts and stole their magic, turning them into fish. Lady Aurex witnessed this betrayal, leading to the Flatheads turning against the Skeezers. The Su-dic and his wife seized power, becoming cruel rulers. Coo-ee-oh's treachery made her arrogant, mistreating her people and ruling with fear. Lady Aurex feared for the safety of the transformed fish, as they held the key to their future happiness. Ozma, a powerful figure, planned to protect them from harm.

"The reason I bring up the little Wizard of Oz last is because he was the most important man in the Land of Oz.

The Wizard wasn't exactly handsome but he was pleasant to look at. His bald head was as shiny as if it had been varnished; there was always a merry twinkle in his eyes, and he was as spry as a schoolboy. Dorothy says the reason the Wizard is not as powerful as Glinda is because Glinda didn't teach him all she knows, but what the Wizard knows he knows very well and so he performs some very remarkable magic.

The Diamond Swan had sailed away, leaving Ervic and his companions stranded. As they waited for help, three magical fish emerged from the lake, promising to aid them in exchange for their loyalty. The fish instructed Ervic to tie a silver cord to the boat, and they miraculously pulled it to shore. Following their guidance, Ervic cleaned a copper kettle left by the Su-dic, removing the poison. The fish then swam into the kettle, ready to offer further instructions to Ervic. This unexpected turn of events filled Ervic with hope and anticipation for what lay ahead.|['1.

Ervic's friends were fast asleep and unaware of the magical events unfolding. Ervic used a kettle to capture three special fishes from the lake. The fishes instructed him to carry the kettle eastward, following a path to a purple cottage with white trimmings. Ervic carefully followed their directions, stepping over his sleeping friends. He walked through meadows, hills, and valleys until he reached the isolated cottage. Meanwhile, Glinda and her group decided to head to the Skeezer Country to rescue Ozma and Dorothy before dealing with the Enchanted Mountain. As they approached the lake, they encountered a Diamond Swan, its majestic presence captivating their attention. The group then focused on the sunken island where their friends were held captive, eager to initiate their rescue mission.|['1.

Glinda signaled the Diamond Swan to approach gracefully. Before anyone could speak, Coo-ee-oh, with a raspy voice typical of swans, dismissed magic and witchcraft. She expressed disdain for her past life, considering it like a bad dream. Glinda, eager to raise the sunken island, offered a string of pearls to Coo-ee-oh in exchange for her forgotten knowledge of witchcraft. Coo-ee-oh explained that the island responds only to her magic commands. The group then discussed seeking three magic fishes to solve the mystery. Ojo spotted a boat on the shore, suggesting they use it to find the fishes. Glinda, unfamiliar with witchcraft, believed she could make the boat move using sorcery. Ultimately, Glinda planned to call the fishes to them, pondering over the boat's presence on the shore.|"[""1.

Glinda and the Wizard listened intently as the young men recounted the tale of the submerged island and the mysterious disappearance of their friend Ervic. They explained how Coo-ee-oh had been transformed into a swan by the Su-dic, losing all her magical knowledge. The boat had drifted to shore, leaving them stranded beside it. Despite their efforts to find Ervic, they remained stuck by the beach, waiting for a sign. Glinda proposed a plan to use her powers to command the boat to return to the island's basement and bring back Ozma and Dorothy. The young men were reassured by the fishes' advice not to fear the Yookoohoo's tricks in the cottage. Ervic, though nervous, bravely approached the door, ready to uncover the secret behind the transformations.|"['1.

The scene that Ervic witnessed was truly startling and enough to terrify the unprepared. A menacing crocodile with red eyes and sharp teeth lay before him, while horned toads hopped around. Spiders lurked in cobwebs at each corner, and a giant spider sat in the center. A lizard spat flames and rats scurried about. Most surprising was a large gray ape in a lace cap and apron, knitting. Despite the chaos, Ervic remained composed. The creatures attacked him, but he was unfazed. As the witch, Red Reera, observed him, she realized his curiosity was genuine and harmless. This unexpected encounter led to a shift in her attitude towards Ervic, prompting her to delve into a mysterious drawer in the cupboard.|"['1.

Ervic watched in amazement as the ape transformed into a young woman dressed in a Gillikin costume. She effortlessly changed a crocodile into a red wolf and turned lizards and toads into adorable kittens and chipmunks. Only the spiders remained, hidden behind their webs. Reera, the Yookoohoo, explained her love for transforming creatures to keep things interesting. She offered to change them into turtles, sea-horses, piglets, rabbits, or other animals. Despite Ervic's grumpiness, Reera found his presence amusing and conjured a meal for them both. The creatures gathered around the table as they dined, showcasing the beauty of transformation and the joy of sharing a meal together.|"['1.

Ervic thought carefully and suggested to Reera that transforming his three fish into three girls who were skilled in magic might please him as much as the fish did. He cleverly hinted that the girls might not consent to be his slaves and could command him instead. Reera, impressed by his approach, made the table vanish after feeding her pets. Ervic observed Reera's actions closely and noticed that she used something from a specific drawer to perform her transformations. He planned to sneakily use the same substance to change the fish back to their original forms if Reera fell asleep. However, the fish warned Ervic not to meddle with the drawer as only Reera knew how to use the magic powder. They advised him to persuade Reera to transform them into girls adept in magic, which Ervic found to be a wise and effective plan.|"['1.

The Yookoohoo had already received permission and Skeezer had agreed to abide by the decision. Despite his reluctance, Ervic sat down, a scowl on his face but joy in his heart. Reera took three fishes from the kettle and transformed them into three elegant young women with beautiful features and gowns. The Yookoohoo praised Reera's work and suggested they dine to celebrate the occasion. Reera transformed herself into a lovely young woman to match the Adepts' beauty. The group shared a meal, and the Adepts revealed their plan to be transformed. The Yookoohoo explained her reluctance to assist others magically and asked the women to promise not to reveal what had occurred.

"""Yes, I always carry one in my bag,"" said the Wizard. He took out a polished skeropythrope from his magic tools bag and gave it to the Sorceress. Glinda had a wicker bag with sorcery items. She mixed liquid and powder in the skeropythrope, causing violet sparks to spread. Glinda chanted a sorcery incantation while the sparks covered the boat. The boat became waterproof, with glass windows. Underwater, it approached the island but a magic word was needed to open the marble door. Glinda and the Wizard saw Dorothy and Ozma inside. They gestured that they came to rescue them. The boat returned to shore. Glinda set up a camp with tents magically furnished by the Wizard and Sorceress. Each tent had Oz flags. The rescue party settled in comfortably while Glinda planned to conquer the marble door to save their friends."|['1.

Late into the night, Glinda sat in her tent studying ancient scrolls, hoping to find the magic word that would unlock the door to the Great Dome on the sunken island. Despite her efforts and magical experiments, she remained unsuccessful by morning. Realizing that breaking the charm on the door was the only way to gain entrance, Glinda suggested abandoning the attempt. The Wizard and Glinda discussed different ways to rescue Ozma and Dorothy, considering the various magical powers they possessed. Just then, a group of three elegantly dressed young women and a handsome Skeezer approached them. Glinda learned that Princess Ozma was imprisoned in the Skeezer village by the witchcraft of Coo-ee-oh. She shared her plan to find three fishes that were once Adepts at Magic, hoping they could reveal the magic used by Coo-ee-oh.

Three wise Adepts and the powerful sorceress Glinda pondered over the mystery of the Dome, believed to hold the secrets of Coo-ee-oh. Trot and Betsy burst in with the Patchwork Girl, sparking laughter among the group. Scraps suggested transforming them into polliwogs to reach the Dome beneath the lake. An idea emerged to lower the water level to expose the Dome's top, allowing entry. Glinda introduced the Adepts to the curious girls and sent them away to plan. The group held a reception, enjoying poems from the Scarecrow and songs from the Cowardly Lion. The next day, they chanted a spell, causing the lake to recede and reveal the Dome. With determination, they set out on a boat towards the mysterious structure, ready to uncover its secrets.|"['1.

The boat gently landed on the sloping glass of the Dome. The Wizard, with his tools, quickly removed a large pane of glass to create an opening big enough for them to pass through. Steel frames supported the Dome's glass, and the Wizard tied a rope around one frame. He descended through the opening, hand over hand, while the Skeezers cheered below. Ozma, Dorothy, and Lady Aurex were overjoyed to see their friends coming to their rescue. The Wizard then lowered Glinda and the Adepts to safety using the rope. Once on the ground, the Skeezers welcomed their rescuers. Inside the palace, a serious discussion ensued about how to make the island rise. Ozma explained the unusual magic used by Coo-ee-oh, and the group explored the basement machinery, trying to unravel the secrets behind the island's movements.|"['1.

"In the Room of Magic, extraordinary inventions by Coo-ee-oh amazed the Adepts. Glinda pondered how the island, resting on a marble base, could be lifted in water.

Glinda and her companions successfully raised the island where the Skeezers lived. Princess Ozma then extended a bridge to the mainland for their friends from the Emerald City. After a ceremony, Lady Aurex was crowned as the new Queen of the Skeezers. The people were liberated from the cruelty of their former Queen and celebrated with a feast and music. However, there was concern about the Su-dic of the Flatheads who might cause trouble. Princess Ozma and her followers left the Skeezers under the protection of the three Adepts at Magic. They confronted the Su-dic, who surrendered when he saw the Adepts had regained their powers. Glinda transformed the Flatheads into intelligent and good-looking individuals, now known as Mountaineers. This act ensured everyone had their rightful share of brains and ended the conflict.|"['1.
