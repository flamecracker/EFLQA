Lyman, a cattleman, encountered trouble in Paraguay. He vanished mysteriously, leaving his manager to deal with Senor Lopez, an army chief. Lopez denied knowledge of Lyman's whereabouts but threatened to revoke his cattle concession if he didn't return soon. Despite appeals to the United States consul and the president, Lyman remained locked up in a military prison. The situation was dire, with suspicions of Lopez's ulterior motives in play.

Nelson soared like a majestic bird over New Orleans on a scorching August morning. The boys on board gazed at the Gulf of Mexico in the distance while the city's winding streets passed beneath them. Departing from San Francisco had been delayed due to missing instructions from Washington and a minor plane issue during a practice flight. Lieutenant Gates accompanied them until they embarked on their journey towards the mouth of the Mississippi River. The original plan was to head east towards Peru, but it was changed to avoid attracting attention over the Pacific Ocean. The boys rested along the way, covering about thirty-five hundred miles in two days. The aircraft, designed by Leroy, could fly discreetly at high altitudes and low altitudes. The boys explored New Orleans before crossing the Gulf of Mexico towards Yucatan, British Honduras, and Guatemala. They refueled at Panama before continuing their adventure through South America.|"[""1.

Lima is a modern city with beautiful streets and electric lights, but it's not by the coast; that's Callao. The Nelson, an airship, landed in a secluded spot on August 14. The boys, curious about Lima, explained their mission to find the headwaters of the Amazon and cross the Andes into Brazil. The locals were skeptical about air travel, unaware of its advancements. Jimmie, one of the boys, met a ragged boy named Pedro who seemed hungry. Jimmie laughed and shared stories with him. Pedro offered to guard the airship for a dollar, showing his loyalty.

Pedro and Jimmie quickly reached an agreement, and they set off together. Their first stop was a clothing store, where Jimmie carefully assessed Dougherty's measurements. Once a complete set of clothes was secured, they headed to a hotel. Inside, Jimmie led Dougherty to a spacious bathroom, leaving him in disbelief at the prospect of being clean and properly dressed after so long. Jimmie reassured him, mentioning his own past struggles and the Boy Scout who had helped him. After getting cleaned up, Dougherty was to meet Jimmie in room No. 4, where they would join Ned and Sam Leroy.

"Two days before finding a vessel heading their way, Jack persuaded his father to sway the owners to alter course, letting them and their motorboats off at the Amazon river mouth. The boat matched a modern ocean liner in speed. Within ten days from departing New York on August 12th, the boys navigated the vast river, resembling more a boundless sea than a river at its mouth! ""Boats sailed here during Columbus' time,"" Frank mentioned. ""A Columbus companion first found this grand delta. The river enriches two million square miles of land and stands as the world's largest water system."" ""Did you know,"" Harry chimed in, eager to add an intriguing fact, ""the current carries freshwater and sand five hundred miles into the Atlantic Ocean? It's a freshwater river in a saltwater sea for five hundred miles!"" The boys stayed vigilant that night, with one on watch as they journeyed. Their boat, the Black Bear, specially crafted for river expeditions, was sturdy and adaptable. It could be dismantled and reassembled swiftly, with steel plates embedded within the wooden structure, making it nearly bulletproof. The boat's design allowed for ample sunlight or protection from the elements. The powerful motors ensured smooth sailing on the Amazon. Additionally, they had the Wolf, a secure tender boat, carrying extra supplies and fuel, ready for the adventure ahead."|['1.

During their journey up the river, the boys were often greeted by passing boats, but they paid little attention as they didn't want to waste time chatting. The Amazon River used to only allow Brazilian ships, but now it's open to global trade. Ships from Europe and America now travel to and from Amazon ports. The river is bustling with steamers, launches, and small crafts collecting goods like rubber, fruits, and hardwoods. Over three million tons of products are transported down the river each year. The Amazon is massive, draining a region as large as the eastern United States. The boys on the Black Bear sailed swiftly past green islands near the delta, amazed by the river's vastness. They anticipated meeting a group traveling by airship to Lima, a journey filled with adventure and challenges.|['1.

Ned chimed in, ""The airship's sudden appearance may be a coincidence, but I sense significance. I've had a hunch those troublemakers from San Francisco weren't done with us."" The boys faced a dilemma. Fleeing or confronting the airship would jeopardize their mission to rescue Lyman. Running meant official trouble, while a fight risked legal repercussions.

They decided Pedro would stay in Lima to gather more information until their return. Meanwhile, Mike would accompany him.

"Ned agreed, preferring to have Collins with him than reporting the Nelson's departure. ""We'll check the ship and maybe take a short flight. Join us,"" Ned invited. Collins, pleased with the offer, walked briskly. But soon, he lagged behind, chatting with Jimmie. Suddenly, Collins vanished down a dark alley. Ned fretted over his odd behavior, fearing he might inform the rival aviator. Meanwhile, Mike sat by the Nelson, explaining planes to a local, despite his lack of knowledge.

The Lima rooftops clustered closely together, creating a small point of land. The mountains and sea stretched endlessly, resembling a rug with invisible stripes. As the plane ascended, the air thinned, causing breathlessness. The motors stopped, and the plane met the rising ocean and mountains. Suddenly, the plane descended, alarming Jimmie. After landing, the boys hurried to the hotel and fell asleep. Ned awoke to a knock from Mr. Collins, who seemed worried. Ned suspected Collins of spying on their plane. Despite his suspicions, Ned remained friendly to observe Collins. Ned reassured Collins of Jimmie's safety. Ned was more concerned about the attack on the plane than Collins' questions.|"['1.

Collins explained the chaotic events at the ropes to Ned, hinting at potential danger. He then jovially proposed having lunch together. Ned, wary of Collins's intentions, decided to observe him closely. During their meal, Collins mentioned a trip to Asuncion, hinting at ulterior motives. Ned cautiously steered the conversation away from Paraguay, suspecting Collins's involvement with their enemies. Walking towards the sand lot, Ned noticed Collins's suspicious behavior, confirming his doubts. As they encountered a heated situation involving his friends and the police, Ned observed Collins's subtle encouragement towards conflict. Suspicious of Collins's motives, Ned strategized to avoid being drawn into trouble and remained vigilant.|"['1.

"The courts in this area are slow and uncertain. It might take weeks before the boys are released if they are kept locked up. The idea was to hide them in the mountains until the Nelson returns to resolve the situation. Ned felt suspicious as the officer stared at him, thinking, ""You want to involve me in this mess!"" If Collins knew Ned's thoughts, he wouldn't have encouraged the boys to escape, which only made Ned more wary of him. As night fell, the Nelson was nowhere to be seen. Ned, worried about the boys in prison, wandered the city with Collins, who kept suggesting ways to help the boys.

Ned decided to get a closer look at the airship, but he needed to avoid Collins, who was pacing in front of the hotel. Collins, whom Ned suspected of being part of a conspiracy against him, was likely to join him. Ned cleverly outsmarted Collins by pretending to go along with him, all the while knowing the aviator was not present at the airship site. As they approached the white aeroplane, Ned noticed a man approaching them, and Collins subtly signaled to him. Ned, alert and observant, caught the exchange, confirming his suspicions about Collins.|"['1.

After some more talking, Ned and Collins got permission to examine the Vixen, a machine guarded by a Peruvian Indian. While Collins thanked in fancy words, Ned went straight to the Vixen, tired of Collins' insincerity. The alleged farmer demonstrated the machine to Ned, highlighting its features like no cranking needed. Ned admired the setup but didn't mention the Nelson's similarity. As the Indian left, Collins and Yerkes accompanied Ned around the airship. They checked the machine's components. Ned suspected a plan to trap him for a ride. The visitor's seat had a unique harness with cuffs and a leg band to keep the guest secure. Collins, hinting about a previous race, took a seat, and Ned secured him in the harness. When the Vixen started moving, the Indian gave it a push down the incline.|"['1. What did the Peruvian Indian guard?\nA) A car\nB) A machine\nC) An airplane\nD) A boat\nE) A bicycle', ""2.

"Collins struggled to raise his hands but failed, resorting to shouting instead. Yerkes, engrossed in the machine's noise, mistook Collins' voice for the boy's and ignored it. ""Yerkes!"" Collins yelled desperately. ""Stop the machine! Grab the propellers and rip them off! Shoot this kid! Anything to halt this madness. He's got me ensnared!"" Recognizing the voice, Yerkes lunged towards the propellers, but they were just out of reach. Frustrated, he fired shots aimlessly. The Vixen accelerated southward, leaving Yerkes and the Indian in a fit of rage below. As Ned gazed westward, he noticed a steamer docking at Calleo. Jack argued about the river's course, while Frank pointed out the Madeira river in the distance, resembling a lake.

Once, the boys had to disassemble their motor boat to carry it and supplies past rapids, reassembling it to continue their journey. By the third day, they reached the junction with the Beni river, entering a wild and perilous area teeming with wildlife and potentially cannibal tribes. On a sticky evening, Jack set up camp, and as they dined on fish they caught, a strange light in the sky caught their attention. Believing it to be their friends, the boys tried to signal them with lights and shouts, but the light disappeared beyond the clouds. Determined to attract their friends' attention, Jack proposed creating a large fire to reflect off the clouds, hoping to reunite with their companions.|"['1.

Harry suggested that the Nelson might be followed, and they needed to alert the aviator they were there. The boys gathered wood to build a fire, but it was damp. They used gasoline, causing a loud explosion. The fire blazed up, attracting wild animals like monkeys and a hissing serpent. The boys realized they might have started something dangerous. They hurried back to the boat as a precaution, fearing they might be blocked by savages. They were ready to escape on the Black Bear, not wanting to be trapped by the cunning savages.|"['1.

The situation grew dire as head hunters emerged in the open space near the blazing tree, brandishing their weapons at the boat. Arrows with poisoned tips struck the side of the Black Bear. The boys crowded the panel, gazing at the red clouds above reflecting the tree's flames. A mysterious light moved across the sky, searching for answers. The boys fired shots and signals at an approaching aeroplane, but it swiftly disappeared. Ned, on a stolen aeroplane, spotted another aircraft vanishing over the mountains. Determined to land safely, Ned found a valley to descend into, but the landing was rough, causing chaos. Amidst the darkness, a scuffle ensued, leading to a fellow's unconsciousness.|"['1.

Ned secured the man's hands with leather straps and went in search of water. Soon, he found a spring trickling out of the pit. After a cold bath revived the man, he complained about their predicament in improper language. Ned informed him they were likely around 300 miles from Lima, near a town and a railroad. He also mentioned Lake Titicaca and the nearby rivers. Spotting the Nelson in a valley, Ned was relieved. However, Jimmie and Pedro were missing. He decided to descend to the valley to inspect the aeroplane. The beautiful morning motivated him despite his hunger. As he climbed, he heard a noise and saw the Nelson below, intact but unattended.

Ned was about to shout for help when he noticed a hand signaling from under the gray planes. It was Jimmie, dirty-faced and armed, hiding from attackers. Pedro was missing. As Ned tried to understand the situation, an arrow narrowly missed him. Jimmie had been ambushed after landing the plane for repairs. The attackers prevented them from taking off, shooting arrows whenever they moved. Ned found Pedro hiding and learned that the enemies might come from Sicuani.

Ned cleared the situation a bit and decided to reach the Nelson, which Pedro said was ready to fly. There were probably only six people, two wounded or dead. Ned thought it best to make the journey alone. He started down the cliff, surprisingly without any threats from the gully where the attackers vanished. The valley was quiet, but sounds from afar revealed the direction of an approaching car. Pedro found a dead man, buried him, and joined the group. They checked the plane, finding it ready.

Ned observed a rope connected to the machine pulling it up a steep slope. The motor car slowly moved forward, dragging it over rocks. Ned's focus shifted to the car, wondering about the route it took. The Indians loaded the Vixen with stones and grass, preparing to drop them on the Nelson. Ned and Jimmie rushed to save it. The Vixen began rising, and despite Ned's efforts to stop the driver, stones were dropped on the Nelson. Flames ignited on the fragile planes. Ned tried to shoot the culprit but failed.

Frank and Harry were hesitant about navigating the unknown river at night due to potential dangers like rapids and obstructions. They were also curious about the commotion on the shore. Suddenly, drums and chants filled the air, signaling a possible attack from canoes. Jack quickly assessed the situation, suggesting they navigate through the canoes swiftly if needed. Collins, however, claimed there were no savages present, contradicting Jackson's account. Jackson suspected Collins of falsely accusing him of cattle theft.

Ned, a US Secret Service official, uncovered a scheme in Paraguay to cheat Lyman. Initially, it was suspected that only private interests were involved. But now, with the government of Paraguay implicated, a potential conflict loomed. Ned feared war unless Lyman was rescued discreetly. The State Department trusted him to handle the situation. Ned awaited the newcomers’ actions, hoping for a peaceful resolution. Meanwhile, Jackson and Jimmie repaired the plane while Ned discovered low fuel, puzzling for a short flight. Despite the threat, Collins, a prisoner, was secured. Ned planned a potential exchange for Lyman. As the group strategized, Collins tried to alert allies, but to no avail.

Jimmie hurried away, staying in the gully and skirting around friendly cliffs to avoid climbing over the ridge that enclosed the valley to the west. The gully crossed the valley from east to west and was deepest at the eastern end. After Jimmie disappeared, Ned moved Collins to the deep part of the gully and stationed Jackson there as a guard. Ned didn't want Collins to alert his friends about the empty tanks of the Nelson, which could prevent them from getting gasoline from the wrecked Vixen. Ned observed men in the other valley gathering reinforcements, including Indians. Ned suspected they planned to surround him.

A campfire crackled, and Lyman, the man they mistook for a cowboy, sat nearby. The rest wandered around. Occasionally, an Indian entered the fire's glow, conferred briefly, then vanished. The supposed officers readied to attack, aiming to disable the Nelson for good. Jimmie informed Ned, who swiftly boarded the plane. Ned instructed them to create a commotion to distract the enemy. The Nelson smoothly ascended, drawing futile shots from below. Jimmie and Jackson freed Collins and fled, with Jackson playfully shooting near Collins' feet. They escaped the valley and headed for a tunnel. Watching the Nelson soar away, they were unsure of its success. Pursued, they hurried through the dark tunnel, guided by a small light.

The firelight illuminated the white planes, standing out vividly against the dark backdrop. Ned realized he couldn't linger there without risking detection by the supposed officers of the small republic he was in conflict with. As he landed, the men were hidden from view, but upon spotting the aeroplane, they hurried back. Lyman, whom Ned suspected to be the cattleman involved in financial disputes, was near the fire as the Nelson descended. Startled, he watched as Ned urged him to quickly board the aircraft to evade imminent danger. With nerves rattled and pale, Lyman hesitated but eventually complied. The Nelson swiftly took off, dodging shots fired by the approaching men. In a few minutes, they were safely out of harm's way, soaring through the night. Ned suggested various destinations for Lyman to consider for refuge, highlighting the unique atmospheric currents that could aid their journey to Asuncion. Lyman expressed frustration at the lack of protection from the U.S. government, contrasting it with England's commitment to its citizens.

That night ride was unforgettable for both participants. The dark first part of the night gave way to a moonlit sky, revealing the stunning beauty of the country. They flew over mountains, forests, and rivers feeding into the Amazon. The eerie cries of wild beasts echoed below, adding to the thrill. Ned navigated the fierce currents near Mt. Sorata and headed north towards the Beni river valley. He aimed to reach the Serre Geral range for better speed and protection from Atlantic drifts. Spotting a boat on the Madeira river, Ned cautiously descended, aware of potential risks. Unbeknownst to him, his friends were exploring the Amazon headwaters.

Above the roaring falls and rapids of the Beni River, the boys faced a perilous situation. The treacherous Paredon and Paderneira falls, along with the Araras and Misericordia rapids, blocked their way. The natives, possibly cannibals, gathered at the foot of the falls, posing a threat. Frank proposed a daring plan to use their boat, the Black Bear, as a battering ram by setting dynamite to explode and clear the obstruction.

Looking through the thick glass panel above, the group witnessed a shower of crimson flames descending on the twisting river. The sky, the river, and the forest all turned a deep red hue from the blazing powder. Shouts echoed from the water, followed by a silence as the heads floating in the river moved swiftly towards the banks. The plane cautiously circled and descended lower. Jack unlatched the panel while Harry remarked on their unplanned rescue by Ned. Watching from inside, the boys observed Ned dropping dynamite to clear the logs and canoes blocking the river. The pressure of the current compacted the obstruction, making it challenging to navigate.

Ned praised the Boy Scout training for instilling courage and resourcefulness. He mentioned that they had avoided many traps but were now facing their toughest situation yet. The conversation shifted to an encounter with the president of the Republic, who ordered Ned to appear before him. Despite being searched, nothing incriminating was found, and Ned was released. The president also returned Ned's confiscated ship, the Nelson. The group discussed plans to find Jimmie, rescue Leroy from jail, and locate Lyman. They debated the number of passengers the Nelson could carry and decided to split up for the journey.

After breakfast, the boys inspected the Black Bear and decided the broken propeller could be fixed. They left Harry to handle it, refueled the Nelson, and readied for their journey back to the mountains of Peru. Startled by an approaching car in the tunnel, Jimmie and Jackson ran towards the east entrance, searching for a hiding spot. They soon realized they couldn't keep up the pace as the car closed in on them. The men loaded them into the car and reversed course. At the valley with a campfire, Peruvian Indians took the boys to a cavern. Jackson was disheartened, but Jimmie remained optimistic, hinting at a trap set by Collins. Jackson pondered why they were being held, while Jimmie assured they would be rescued by Ned in the Nelson soon.|['1.

Jimmie hurried to the guard, who was alert with his gun ready, showing signs of cold. The guard, also feeling the chill, quickly understood Jimmie's gestures.
