"Sue and Bunny were stuck inside on a rainy day. They longed to go out and play, but their mother, Mrs. Brown, had firmly said no. Determined to make the best of it, Sue and Bunny decided to play store in the kitchen. They used items from the pantry like spices, soap, nuts, and vegetables to create their imaginary shop. Bunny took on the role of the storekeeper while Sue pretended to be a customer. The siblings immersed themselves in their game, forgetting about the dreary weather outside. Sue even addressed Bunny as ""Mr. Huntley"" in their make-believe store, adding a touch of fun and creativity to their indoor adventure."|"['1.

Bunny and Sue enjoyed playing store inside as the rain poured outside. Bunny used bird gravel as pretend sugar, coffee beans for Sue, and empty thread spools as eggs. Bunny then suggested turning their store into a hardware store, stacking items on high shelves. Excited, they set up a hardware play-store with washboilers, pans, and more. But their fun was interrupted when Mary accidentally caused a mess by opening a door, toppling shelves and items. Mrs. Brown and Mary helped Bunny out from the wreckage. Bunny Brown and his sister Sue lived in Bellemere with their parents, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Brown, near the ocean. They had a boat dock, and their friend Bunker Blue worked there. They also had Uncle Tad, cook Mary, a dog named Splash, and a pony named Toby.|"['1.

"In the village, Bunny and Sue had many friends. Mrs. Redden, who ran a candy store, was a special friend who gave the best penny's worth of sweets. Mr. Gordon owned a grocery store. There was also Mr. Jed Winkler, an old sailor with a parrot and a monkey named Wango. Mr. Winkler's sister, Miss Euphemia, did not like Polly or Wango. Bunny and Sue had many adventures - from visiting Grandpa's farm to playing circus and even going to ""Camp Rest-a-While."" They once had a show to raise money for a home for the blind. Another time, they visited Christmas Tree Cove. Bunny and Sue also had alligators from the South, but their mom insisted they stay in the barn."|"['1.

Bunny Brown and his sister Sue went out in the almost-over rainstorm to feed the alligators. As they approached the tank, the scaly creatures crawled out of the water onto bits of wood and stone to rest. Meanwhile, their dog Splash was barking excitedly at something in a tree near the barn. Curious, Bunny and Sue ran to the tree, where they found Splash had chased their pet monkey Wango up the tree. Despite being friends, Wango was scared and clung to a branch. Sue decided to fetch cake to lure Wango down, asking Bunny to keep Splash inside. With the rain stopped and the sun coming out, Sue hurried to help Bunny rescue Wango from the tree.|['1.

Mrs. Brown chuckled, remarking on the chatter from the little girl. She suspected that Wango had once again escaped from Jed's care. She instructed Sue and Bunny to return the monkey and offered them some cake from Mary. Mrs. Brown struggled to keep Splash indoors as he was eager to follow Sue. Wango had a habit of running away, and Bunny and Sue had returned him before. They knocked at the door, and Miss Winkler greeted them, noting that Wango was Jed's monkey. Despite not wanting Wango back, Miss Winkler appreciated Bunny and Sue's kindness. The noisy parrot and chatty Wango caused a commotion. Miss Winkler asked Sue to put Wango in his cage and praised the children for their help. She suggested they have some cake and joked about not giving any to Wango.|['1.

After playing in the mud puddles, Bunny and Sue returned home with their dog Splash. They then ventured to a shallow brook with Splash, where they constructed a raft from some boards. Pretending to be explorers like Robinson Crusoe, they sailed on the makeshift raft. Later, Bunny and Sue hurried to school, narrowly avoiding being late. In class, a classmate named Sadie claimed to have seen a mouse in Bunny's desk. Miss Bradley, their teacher, investigated and found that the desk lid was slightly raised, but there was no mouse. The students watched anxiously as the teacher checked Bunny's desk, with some hoping to see the mouse and prove Sadie right. Ultimately, there was no mouse, and the classroom returned to its usual calm state.|"['1.

"Bunny confessed, ""I have pet alligators at home, some are Sue's. We keep them in the barn down South. But I didn't bring any to school. I can tell if it's mine or Sue's."" The little girl added, ""Bunny's pencil box was left in the barn. He couldn't find it this morning."" The alligator had sneaked into the box, peeking out during Bunny's recital, mistaken for a mouse. Excited chatter filled the school about the pet alligator and Sadie West's encounter. The teacher then asked Bunny and Sue to fetch baking powder from Mrs. Golden's corner store. The children knew the store, which also sold candy and toys. As they entered, groans and sighs startled them, with no one in sight."|"['1.

Bunny Brown and his sister Sue were familiar with Mrs. Golden's store, though they hadn't made many purchases there. They recognized the storekeeper, who often greeted them by name. One day, they heard groans from behind a counter and discovered Mrs. Golden stuck after a fall. Gratefully, she asked for help in moving the box pinning her down. Bunny and Sue managed to free her, and Mrs. Golden explained that her son, Philip, warned her about climbing for items. Despite feeling a bit shaken, she insisted on continuing her work at the store. Mrs. Golden, grateful for the children's help, offered them baking powder for sale, mentioning her struggle to reach high shelves after the incident.|"[""1.

Mrs. Golden thanked Bunny for his kindness but explained that the baking powder was on a high shelf. She mentioned that her son, Philip, would help rearrange things to be more accessible. Bunny and Sue were surprised when a parrot suddenly flew out in class, perching on the teacher's desk. The parrot squawked and made odd remarks. The teacher decided the parrot should be returned to Mr. Winkler. Bunny showed how the parrot liked him by perching on his shoulder. Mrs. Golden then offered Bunny a toy car for a discounted price, winding it up to show how it worked. Bunny and Charlie left, hoping the parrot and monkey wouldn't be given away, as Mr. Winkler had threatened before.|['1.

"""It's all in good condition,"" Mrs. Golden mentioned. ""I won't be able to manage a toy store along with my grocery and notions shop. I've decided to give up most of my toys. But this auto you have, Charlie, is top-notch."" This perspective seemed sensible, and the girls were intrigued to see the construction work at the far end of the school yard. The laborers had been digging for days, fixing water pipes, resulting in a deep trench. Helen found herself stuck at the bottom of the trench, unable to climb out. Miss Bradley reassured her and instructed the other children to stay away from the edges to prevent any accidents. The teacher warned them about the dangers of the trench and made them promise to steer clear of it. Suddenly, a buzzing sound filled the room, signaling Charlie's toy automobile that had fallen out of his pocket."|"['1.

Miss Bradley, the teacher, was deep in thought, ensuring her students wouldn't approach the deep hole in the schoolyard. Meanwhile, a buzzing noise filled the classroom. It turned out to be Charlie's toy auto, making a fuss with its buzzing wheels but moving slowly. The toy rolled out from Charlie's pocket, surprising Miss Bradley as it bumped into her foot. Although she was initially puzzled by the noise, she soon realized its source. Charlie explained that he had brought the toy to school by mistake. Miss Bradley forgave him but warned against bringing toys to class. She instructed Charlie to collect his toy after school. Despite the commotion, the class refocused on their studies, trying to make up for lost time after a series of unexpected events that day.|"[""1.

As the day came to a close, the children ran out of the room, leaving Charlie behind. He shyly approached Miss Bradley at her desk, where she was grading papers. The room fell silent after the children's departure. Surprisingly, Miss Bradley started playing with Charlie's toy, which he had offered to let her wind. On a Saturday morning, Bunny and Sue joined their friends in the barn to play store. They had gathered boards and boxes to create shelves for their pretend shop. The children, including Charlie, Helen, Bobbie, Harry, George, Mary, and Sadie, enthusiastically joined in the fun. Bunny and Sue led the game, assigning roles as cashiers and clerks. They used pebbles and shells as currency, making the play store more realistic.|"['1.

Charlie decided to turn his old auto into a store in the barn. He set up shelves with items found in the yard and woods. The children took turns being customers and clerks. Charlie acted as the cashier at the end of the shelves. An auto change-carrier was used to bring items to him. Splash, the dog, helped deliver goods. Accidents happened, like when Splash spilled prunes. Despite mishaps, the children enjoyed playing store all morning.

When lunchtime arrived, Mrs. Brown surprised Bunny, Sue, and the other children by inviting them to stay and enjoy a meal served in the barn. After a fun lunch, they resumed playing store until they grew tired and switched to games like tag and hide-and-seek. As the day progressed, Bunny and his friend Charlie got engrossed in sailing Bunny's new sailboat down the nearby brook. However, they were so focused on the boat that they didn't notice Sue wandering off and falling into the water. Fortunately, Charlie and Bunny quickly rescued Sue, but she was left soaking wet and covered in mud.

Charlie excitedly informed Sue that the painters were working on the roof of the sun parlor and the ladder was conveniently placed nearby. Sue could climb up to the roof through a second-story window where she could change without being seen. The children cautiously approached the ladder, which was large and leaning against the one-story sun parlor. Sue hesitated but eventually started climbing, only to find that the painter had painted only part of the roof. The children accidentally got red paint on their clothes, which couldn't be brushed off without turpentine. They hoped to keep the mishap a secret from Mrs. Brown, especially since she had guests over. The painter, amused by the situation, revealed that the paint belonged to Bunny's father and offered to help clean it off with a solution that reminded Bunny of a remedy his mother once used on him when he had a cold.|"['1.

The painter used turpentine, a liquid from trees, to remove paint stains. Turpentine helps dissolve paint and quickens drying. He cleaned Sue's dress and then Bunny and Charlie. Mrs. Brown advised Sue to report accidents promptly. The boys tried to clean their stains. Mrs. Golden, an elderly lady, struggled with stiffness and rheumatism. She needed help reaching items. She explained the concept of a legacy to Sue. Bunny tried to help Mrs. Golden get black pepper when a furry creature caused chaos in the store.

In the doorway of the classroom stood Toby, the Brown's Shetland pony. The wind ruffled his fluffy mane and forelock as he peered inside, his bright eyes searching for Bunny and his sister. It was unusual for Toby to follow the children, and everyone was curious about how he had ended up there. The tall young helper explained that Toby had slipped his halter outside the hardware store while he ran an errand for Bunny's father. Toby had wandered into the schoolhouse on his own. Bunker Blue, the helper, led Toby out of the classroom amid laughter. The class enjoyed the unexpected visit, and it even inspired Bobbie to recite Mary's lamb verses flawlessly. Mrs. Brown suggested supporting Mrs. Golden's small store, emphasizing kindness and thoughtfulness. Mrs. Golden weighed out sweets for Bunny, mentioning that she couldn't afford delivery services.
