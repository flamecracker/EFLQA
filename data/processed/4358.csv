"Cap'n Bill cleared his throat. Then he attempted to sneeze, buying himself some time. Pulling out his crimson cotton handkerchief, he wiped his shiny scalp vigorously, hoping to sharpen his thoughts. ""Do you see that ship, Trot?"" he asked, gesturing towards a distant sail on the horizon. ""Perhaps they have, Trot, perhaps they have,"" he pondered. ""I'm relaying the tale as it was relayed to me, but I never delved so deeply into the matter before. It seems that people wouldn't know so much about mermaids if they hadn't spotted them; and yet, according to all reports, the victim is destined to drown."" Cap'n Bill was a pleasant man, and Trot knew he always enjoyed explaining things so she could grasp them fully. The elderly sailor was not very tall, and some might describe him as chubby or even overweight. He sported a navy blue sailor shirt adorned with white anchors on the broad, square collar, and his wide blue trousers flared at the hem. He habitually wore one pant leg over his wooden limb, which sometimes fluttered in the breeze like a flag due to its width compared to the slender wooden leg. His coarse kersey coat was a pea-jacket that reached his waist. In the capacious pockets of his jacket, he carried a remarkable jackknife, his pipe and tobacco, various bits of string, matches, keys, and numerous other odds and ends. Whenever Cap"|"[""1.

As they reached the sandy shore, Cap'n Bill guided Trot to a spot beneath a towering acacia tree on the bluff. A shed-like structure hung halfway up the cliff, sheltering Trot's rowboat from the crashing waves. Cap'n Bill untied the boat, allowing it to glide down to the beach on a rope attached to an iron ring on the cliff. With expertise, Cap'n Bill maneuvered the boat to the water's edge. Trot settled in the bow as Cap'n Bill rowed gently, exploring the North Promontory with its mysterious caves. The sun's heat drove them to seek shade in Smuggler's Cave, the largest on the coast. As they glided into the cave's cool darkness, a sense of awe and excitement filled the air, leaving them speechless in the face of the cave's vast beauty.|"[""1.

In a grand cavern filled with a radiant sapphire glow from the water, Trot and Cap'n Bill marveled at the beauty surrounding them. The water sparkled like precious jewels, enchanting both with its splendor. Captivated, Trot rested her chin on her hands, while Cap'n Bill let the boat drift, mesmerized by the scene. Slowly, the boat ventured deeper into the cavern, revealing new wonders. The ocean, a beloved companion to both, now appeared adorned in sapphires and azure, showcasing its unexpected allure.

"""No, indeed,"" said the first mermaid who spoke. ""If we wanted to harm you, our magic could reach you on land as easily as in this cave. We love little girls and only want to make them happy."" The cave filled with laughter, and Trot asked, ""Can I see your scales? Are they green, purple, and pink like Cap'n Bill said?"" They hesitated and swam a bit away, their beautiful heads forming a delightful group. The brown-haired mermaid returned and asked, ""Would you like to visit our kingdom under the sea?"" She assured them they could return home whenever they wished. The mermaids laughed, and the brown-haired one said, ""If you're scared, you can leave. We just wanted to show Mayre our home."" Trot accidentally fell into the water, laughing, and Cap'n Bill joined her. Princess Clia offered her hand to Cap'n Bill, who, after taking it, felt a strange lightness in his legs and a desire to swim.

The mermaids wore stunning gowns made of a shimmering material that resembled silk. Their dresses had low necklines and flowing sleeves, revealing their elegant white arms. The gowns had long trains that trailed behind them in the water, with sparkling scales visible where their human forms met their fish tails. Strings of beautiful pearls adorned their necks and dresses. Princess Clia explained that as fairies, they were safe in the ocean, but Trot and Bill, being mortals, needed protection. As they swam, they encountered a school of large yellowtail fishes, which moved aside to let them pass. Clia warned about the dangers of sharks and the powerful devilfish that inhabit deep-sea caves.

"Merla chuckled, ""Yes, they have, along with Unko and Inko. Each has their own ocean and visits Anko every hundred years. We've seen them many times."" Trot was pensive, feeling solemn among these ancient beings. The youthful mermaids, including attendants in gauzy robes, played joyfully around her. Despite sailor tales, Trot found the mermaids light-hearted and friendly. The Princess explained they used fairy power to swiftly travel to their ocean palaces at the bottom of the sea. As they descended, the water was clear with a green tint, making everything distinct. Trot marveled at the sea shrubs in vibrant colors like purple, red, orange, yellow, and blue, creating a dazzling underwater grove."|"['1.

The sea shrubs, as large as earth's trees, intertwined in groves with avenues guarded by swordfishes with sharp spikes. These fish protect the mermaids' palaces from uninvited creatures. Passing through the gardens, Trot saw mysterious fruit-bearing bushes. They reached an open space with colorful sea flowers resembling earth's rare orchids. The palaces, built of coral in white, pink, and yellow, had graceful designs. Princess Clia welcomed them, leading into a coral hall with a glass roof. In another room, beautifully dressed mermaids reclined on coral couches adorned with jewels.

In the room's center, a platform of mother-of-pearl held Queen Aquareine on a couch adorned with gems. Mermaids reclined on similar couches, tails preventing them from sitting. Queen Aquareine welcomed Trot and Cap'n Bill, inviting them to learn about life under the sea. With a wave of her hand, she showed Mayre's mother asleep at home. The queen explained that water never touches them, leaving a tiny space between. Suddenly, they noticed a sea serpent peering through the glass roof. Princess Clia created an opening for the serpent to enter, bringing its head beneath the queen's throne.|"['1.

The sea serpent gazed at the visitors, who cautiously observed him. Despite his unusual appearance, Trot found him not scary. His round head had sharp-pointed ears with tassels, a flat nose, and a wide mouth, but gentle blue eyes. The white, scraggly hairs around his face resembled a sparse beard. His long brown body extended to a hole in the coral wall, with fins making him look more like an eel. The sea serpent claimed his name was Julius Sneezer, previously known as Nevercouldnever. Anko mentioned a tail kink from an octopus. The sea serpent's length was measured at over seven thousand feet. He preferred staying coiled at home, carrying only what was necessary when venturing out.|"['1.

The sea serpent, King of his Ocean, boasted about his superiority over other creatures in the sea. Despite having no feet, he took pride in being the tallest among his brothers in different oceans. Anko, curious about life as a sea serpent, learned that they were invulnerable and couldn't commit suicide due to the lack of harmful tools. The sea serpent found life interesting and preferred being alive. As the queen invited her guests to rest and enjoy some sea apples and fruits, they engaged in conversations about human life on land. Later, they were led to a grand dinner where lobsters served a delicious feast of turtle soup, salmon steaks, seafood, and seaweed salad.

The mermaids offered Cap'n Bill and Trot unfamiliar foods, but Cap'n Bill ate without hesitation, so Trot followed suit. The meal was satisfying, and they were assured they wouldn't go hungry. After fruits came flower-shaped ice creams. Trot felt guilty for eating so much but found everything delicious. Aquareine planned a swim with Merla to explore the sea. Cap'n Bill smoked his pipe, creating bubbles underwater. Merla led them to see jellyfish and singing barnacles on a rock covered in shells.

In the deep sea, Trot and Cap'n Bill encountered a cluster of lively eels. One of the eels warned them to be cautious, but assured they meant no harm. As they swam, they encountered various sea creatures, different from the ones they had seen caught by fishermen. Soon, they came across a group of large, dark-colored fishes resting at the sea bottom. The sailor reflected on how people may not truly know themselves, likening it to fish unaware of how they appear when salted and hung in the pantry. Trot expressed her interest in observing crabs, mistaking lobsters and crawfish for them.

"""The crabs,"" mentioned Merla, ""are like distant relatives to the lobsters, although they are much smaller. There are numerous families or types of crabs, and many of them reside in a place nearby that we refer to as Crabville. I believe you will find joy in observing these small creatures in their natural habitats."" Approaching a kelp bed, they encountered the straight, thin stems of the kelp extending upwards to the water's surface. Trot likened the growing kelp to red-brown sticks of macaroni with scattered leaves. Beyond the kelp, they navigated through thick growth to a higher level resembling rocky canyons. Scores of light-green crabs with fiddles gathered before the visitors, playing a cacophony of sounds. The crabs engaged in various antics like building pyramids and playing leapfrog. Merla shared tales of Tommy Blimken and Harry Hustle, two crabs who had escaped captivity and returned home, having seen automobiles during their adventures."|"['1.

Harry Hustle, the crab with one big claw and one little one, excitedly shared his adventures with Cap'n Bill and Trot. He described seeing strange earth people with legs, horses, and other creatures with legs. The earth people wore feathers and flowers on their heads. The crabs then showed off their circus tricks, performing in front of the aquarium. Cap'n Bill and Trot found the crab circus amusing but soon grew tired of the repetitive antics. Moving on, they encountered hermit crabs in conch shells, known for being unsociable. The group of mackerel shared news of Flippity's fate, believing he had gone to glory after being caught by a hook.

Merla explained to Cap'n Bill and Trot that fish are an essential part of the ocean's ecosystem. She mentioned that various sea creatures feed on fish, preventing them from overpopulating the waters. The trio observed unique sea life, including lanterns made from fish skins in the South Sea Islands. Merla clarified that the palaces used electric lights, not fish lanterns. As they swam back to the palace, Merla pointed out the bioluminescent hyalaea lighting the way. Inside, Trot marveled at the beautiful room adorned with iridescent shells and electric jellyfish. The mermaids guided Trot to her wardrobe filled with seaweed gowns and pearl accessories. Cap'n Bill, content in his room, pondered the ocean's pressure as they headed to dine with Queen Aquareine.|"[""1.

In the sea, the deeper you go, the more water presses against you, making it hard to breathe. Divers in steel jackets can't go too deep because of this pressure. But Trot and Cap'n Bill don't feel crowded miles below the surface because the water doesn't touch them. The child explains that the fairy mermaids use magic to keep the water away from their bodies, preventing them from being crushed. At a royal banquet with mermaids, lobsters serve a delicious meal. Cap'n Bill gets soup spilled on his head, but the queen apologizes. After the feast, they enjoy music and dancing. Trot wakes up to fish staring at her through the glass roof. She joins the mermaids for breakfast and prepares to visit King Anko, with the queen ensuring their safety with a Magic Circle.|"[""1.

"""It's unfair! It's mean and unfair!"" cried the creature sadly. ""Just because we have many long arms and take what we can reach, they say we're like--like--oh, I can't say it! It's too shameful, too embarrassing.""

""Let's go,"" said Trot once more. They left the octopus weeping and wiping his eyes and swam on. ""I don't feel sorry for him,"" said the child, ""his legs remind me of snakes.""

The Queen explained about Zog, a fearsome sea creature. Aquareine assured them that Zog, a part-fish, part-man, part-beast, and part-serpent, was now in his castle. The group encountered fierce fishes with saw-like noses, but the Magic Circle protected them, and the fishes left disappointed.

The explorers followed the fleet of argonauts and found themselves in an open space that resembled the top of a high hill. The sandy bottom of the sea was covered with brilliantly colored weeds that swayed gently with the current, displaying a variety of hues. Starfishes in rich and dark colors lay on the bottom, some clinging to the weeds and others moving slowly. Nearby, small seahorses with horse-like heads and tails twined around seaweed stems caught their attention. The Queen explained that the abundance of starfishes and seahorses indicated their proximity to an island. As they ascended through the water, the explorers emerged near a rocky islet, barren except for rocks and devoid of vegetation. The clear sky above surprised Trot as she floated comfortably at the water's surface.|"['1.

"Trot didn't notice it at first, as the island was covered with groups of forms, some still and some moving, which the old sailor recognized as seals. Many were lying asleep or sunning themselves; others crept awkwardly around, using their strong fins as legs or ""paddles"" and caring little if they disturbed the others. Occasionally, one would bark loudly, waking the others to join in. Baby seals were numerous, more active and playful than their elders. They scrambled around on land, entertaining Trot with their antics. The old seal explained that the turtles on the island lived for hundreds of years, safe within their shells. The seals fed on birds and eggs, and the turtles were sometimes flipped onto their backs by mischievous seals, only to be rescued when they reached the water."|['1.

The turtle dashed to shore swiftly, emitting a sharp cry, rousing its companions who joined in the rush towards the seals. Chief Muffruff's group hurriedly dove into the sea, but the chief lagged. The turtles attacked, causing pain and anger, forcing the chief into the water. The turtles triumphed, claiming the island. The Queen, Princess Clia, and Aquareine encountered cuttlefish using ink to hide. They swam left to avoid the ink, but the cuttlefish persisted, leading them off course. Aquareine suspected the sea devils' involvement, prompting a retreat. However, the cuttlefish forced them towards the Devil Caves. The group, pressed from all sides by the ink, had to proceed forward to escape. Trot, against advice, looked up to see crimson arms looming above.

The mermaids explored their room while Cap'n Bill checked out the Peony Room. He found it cozy and interesting, with portraits of porpoises, seals, and walruses on the walls. Mirrors reflected the room, and peonies decorated the ceiling and furniture. Cap'n Bill pulled a cord, not realizing it was a bell cord. He admired a golden mermaid statue and metal peonies. Trot joined him, impressed by the room's beauty despite Zog's sinister intentions. Cap'n Bill mistook his reflection for a ghost, causing a comical mishap.

Two young sailors cheerfully entered, carrying trays of food to a large table. Trot, amazed by the gilled sailors' jovial attitude, realized the slaves of Zog were not sad but rather content under the sea. Cap'n Bill inquired about the number of slaves, and the boy promised to count them. After a hearty meal prepared by Tom Atto, they discussed plans to outsmart Zog. Soon, Sacho led them to a grand chamber where Zog awaited. The slaves, wearing gold bands on their ankles and fish-like gills, appeared calm despite their servitude. Zog, addressing the captives, declared his intention to make them suffer for his amusement. Rivivi was summoned to bring in the Yell-Maker, a fearsome sea creature with crab-like features and long, menacing claws.|"['1.

"The prisoners quickly understood why the creature was named the ""Yell-Maker"" when they saw its dreadful claws. Trot shivered and moved closer to Cap'n Bill. Zog, pleased with the creature he had summoned, instructed it to make the four victims with fish tails scream loudly. The Yell-Maker tried to harm the queen and others but was unable to touch them due to Aquareine's protective magic. Even as the creature attacked, the prisoners remained unharmed. Aquareine used her fairy wand to destroy the Yell-Maker, causing it to melt away into nothing. Zog, impressed by the magic, asked for something new to be shown.

The goldsmith, tempted by the sailor's jackknife, finally agreed and skillfully crafted a delicate golden sword.

Anko, the Sea Serpent, shared a law of the ocean with his friends. He explained that whoever saves a life at sea owns that creature forever. Anko saved his friends from danger, illustrating the fairness of this law. The law was inspired by Captain Kid Glove, a pirate with a unique name. Anko then humorously recounted his adventures, including eating an anchor absentmindedly. This led to a chain connected to a ship, which he cleverly bit off. Anko's stomach trouble from ingesting the anchor and chain required a mustard poultice, causing comical discomfort.

"""Ah, that's the point I was coming to,"" said the King with a smile. ""The ocean is beautiful, but not suitable for earth people. Mermaids inviting you was unwise. You must return home to your natural forms. Earth dwellers are in danger underwater. I order you to go back for your safety,"" the King commanded. Trot agreed, saying she enjoyed the mermaids' kindness. The King then revealed a sea serpent, a rare treat. Cap'n Bill and Trot were amazed by its immense size.

After bidding farewell to the King, they visited the castle. Sacho, the former slaves, spoke about their new life underwater. They decided to stay in the castle, as they couldn't survive on land. Trot wondered if they were happier now. As they explored, they found the former slaves gathered in the golden hall, planning to continue their life underwater, finding happiness in labor and community."""|"['1.

"""We need a new king,"" announced the slaves, tired of Zog's cruelty. They discussed who should rule, settling on Sacho, who declined.
