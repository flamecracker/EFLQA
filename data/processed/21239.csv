Upon first glance, your eyes would be drawn to the valley below, a striking contrast to the rugged surroundings. The valley's shape hints at being an ancient volcano crater, now a lush landscape with park-like plains, rock mounds, and a central lake reflecting the snow-capped Chumulari summit. With a telescope, you could spot various animals and birds roaming and flying around. At one end, a white vapor rises from a hot spring near the lake, not smoke but steam. The valley beckons exploration, yet reaching it requires descending the cliffs using ropes. A gap in the cliffs leads to a glacier-filled gorge, impassable due to deep crevasses. In this secluded valley, you might find traces of past inhabitants - an empty stone hut with animal bones and skins. The cliff face reveals a series of ladders, hinting at an intriguing mystery waiting to be unraveled.|['1. What is the valley below described as in the text?\nA. A desert landscape\nB.

Upon first glance, it seems like the former inhabitants of the hut escaped the valley using ladders. However, the ladders don't reach the top of the cliff, making this exit impossible. There's a gap too wide to cross without more ladders. Where did they go? It's unlikely they were pulled up, and if they fell, they'd still be there. A quick look at the cliff shows the ledge is too narrow for more ladders. It's clear the plan failed. They must have been desperate, trapped in the valley with no way out. After exploring, it's unclear if they ever escaped. Your thoughts turn to who they were, how they got in and out, and if they made it out at all. These questions end once you read the story of the Cliff-climbers. Karl Linden, a German student exiled to London, found work in a nursery due to his botanical skills. He was sent to the Thibetan Himalayas to collect plants, accompanied by his brother Caspar and a guide named Ossaroo. Their journey led them to a valley from which they couldn't escape, facing dangers from wild animals and natural obstacles.|"['1.

Karl and his companions found themselves in a dire situation after a perilous encounter with a bear in a cave. Despite their efforts to explore the cavern, they realized there was no way out through it. Now, facing the daunting cliff that surrounded them, they sat in despair, feeling isolated and hopeless. Karl, however, refused to give in to despondency. He proposed a daring plan to climb the cliff using ladders on the ledges they had spotted. Although the cliff presented challenges, Karl's determination offered a glimmer of hope to his companions.

No. I had not gone further than this spot when I met Master Bruin. Our adventures with him and exploring the cave have kept us busy. Now, we can return to it. Our next step is to go around and see if we can find a better spot. It's too late tonight. Let's go back to our hut, have supper, and then rest. We can pray for success. We might wake up in better spirits and continue our search in the morning. Caspar and Ossaroo had no objections. They were hungry and eagerly got up at the mention of supper. After eating, they prayed for success and went to sleep with renewed hope. They were abruptly awakened by Fritz's barking. He rarely barked unnecessarily. This time, his bark was loud and continuous, indicating something serious. It seemed to come from near the lake. Caspar speculated that it might be an animal that could challenge Fritz, possibly a tiger. Karl shared his knowledge about tigers, mentioning that they could be found in regions farther north than expected. The noise resembled a trumpet but sharper and more eerie.|['1.

Fritz, the dog, was terrified by a strange noise and rushed back into the hut. A shriek-like whistle outside caused even more fear as it approached. Ossaroo, recognizing the noise, warned the others to stay silent and still. A huge shadow outside the door darkened the moonlit turf, revealing a massive creature. Despite the fear, Caspar's curiosity led him to peek outside, followed by Karl and Ossaroo. They saw a gigantic quadruped moving towards the lake, creating ripples in the water. Ossaroo thought it might be a god in elephant form. Karl dismissed the supernatural idea, suggesting it could be an elephant that entered the valley unnoticed. They were puzzled by the unexpected visitor and the disturbance it caused.|['1.

"It never crossed my mind to search for such a thing. Who would have imagined an enormous elephant climbing up here? One might assume such bulky creatures incapable of scaling a mountain.""Well, there you'd be mistaken: surprisingly, elephants are exceptional climbers and can navigate almost anywhere a person can. In Ceylon, wild elephants are often spotted atop Adam's Peak, a nerve-wracking climb even for the bravest explorers. It wouldn't be surprising to find one here. I am now certain that what we saw was an elephant, as nothing else could match it. He may have entered this valley before us, straying up the glacier and crossing the chasm by the rock bridge, just as we did. Or,"" Karl continued, trying to explain the presence of the huge creature, ""he might have been here long before, possibly even before the crevasse existed. It's not unlikely that he's been here for many years—maybe his whole life, which could be a century or more."""|"[""1.

Early the next morning, Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo left the hut at dawn to gather more information about the elephant. Ossaroo, initially skeptical about the elephant's existence, was now convinced as they discovered huge footprints in the sand near the lake. Ossaroo, an experienced hunter, estimated the elephant's size based on the circumference of its foot, revealing it to be a massive twelve feet tall. The group realized the elephant was a rogue, a solitary and dangerous male known for attacking both animals and humans. Understanding the risks, they prepared their weapons and exercised caution. They decided to build long ladders using sturdy Thibet pine trees to explore the ledges above. With a plan in place, they worked diligently to complete their tasks and ensure their safety in the presence of the rogue elephant.|"[""1.

A group of explorers found themselves trapped in a beautiful but loathsome mountain prison. They discovered a series of ledges on the cliff that seemed scalable, offering hope for escape. Although the cliff was high, they were determined to make ladders to reach the top. Facing the daunting task of crafting lightweight ladders for the ascent, they remained undeterred by the months of labor ahead. As they scouted the area for other possible routes, their attention was abruptly drawn to their dog, Fritz, who was fleeing from a mysterious and terrifying presence. With weapons at the ready, the explorers braced themselves for a potential encounter with a formidable creature lurking in the forest.|"['1.

The friends were quickly able to identify Fritz's pursuer as a massive elephant. The elephant charged towards them, trumpeting loudly in anger, with the intention to punish them for Fritz's actions. In a split second, each of them acted on their instincts to defend themselves. Karl shot between the elephant's tusks, Caspar fired at its forehead, and Ossaroo's arrow landed in the elephant's trunk. As the elephant turned its attention to Ossaroo, the friends ran for safety up a nearby tree. Ossaroo, realizing the danger he was in, made a daring escape by climbing back up the obelisk. The elephant, enraged by Ossaroo's actions, tried to reach him but only managed to tear his coat-tail off before he reached safety at the top of the obelisk.|"[""1.

One might have thought the elephant was trying to climb the obelisk, but it couldn't quite reach Ossaroo, the shikaree, who was perched on top. Ossaroo was in a perilous position as the elephant stood on its hind legs, trying to grab him with its trunk. The shikaree, though brave, struggled to keep his balance on the small space he stood on. He had to drop his spear and only had his knife to help him balance. Karl and Caspar, unable to help, watched anxiously from a tree. The elephant's attempts made the rock shake, adding to Ossaroo's challenge. Despite the danger, both brothers encouraged Ossaroo to stay strong. Karl, more aware of the situation, was deeply concerned about the trembling rock, fearing it could lead to disaster.|"[""1.

"""No danger,"" Caspar said, cutting in, ""it's sturdy. It wobbles a bit, but only when the elephant hits it. No real danger, I'd say."" Karl replied anxiously, ""I fear there is danger. These creatures are clever. If the elephant senses the pillar moves, a new idea might strike him, and Ossaroo could be in trouble."" Caspar, now concerned, said, ""I see the risk. What do we do? If we had our guns, we could distract the elephant from Ossaroo. Let's go get them. The elephant won't notice."" Caspar climbed down to the ground, Karl followed to a lower branch. Suddenly, a crash and a scream made them look back. The scene had changed. The rock pillar lay on the ground, the elephant struggling, and Ossaroo missing. The feared scenario had happened. The elephant, unable to reach Ossaroo, had toppled the pillar. Ossaroo was gone. Karl and Caspar were relieved to hear Ossaroo's voice from the fallen tree."|"[""1.

The shikaree quickly emerged from the branches and sprinted towards the tree where the brothers sought refuge. Ossaroo reached safety in the upper branches, followed by Karl and Caspar. The massive tree provided security, allowing them to observe the elephant's movements without fear. Fritz, warned of the elephant's aggression, wisely kept his distance. The elephant, recovering from the fall, searched the fallen tree for the shikaree. Spotting Fritz, the elephant charged towards him in fury. Fritz fled, evading the elephant's pursuit. The elephant circled the fallen tree, occasionally trumpeting in frustration. The group in the tree hoped the elephant would move away, but it remained vigilant. They discussed retrieving their weapons but deemed it too risky. The elephant guarded the area, suspecting the hidden shikaree. The group contemplated their escape plan as they remained trapped in the tree.|"['1.

The trio perched in the tree had a good reason to stay put patiently. They realized they had limited ammunition and decided to use it sparingly. Karl had only two bullets left, and Caspar's supply wasn't much better. They feared that even if they shot all their lead at the elephant, it might not be enough to kill it. The elephant, a known troublemaker, could withstand multiple bullets. They agreed it was risky to provoke it further and decided to wait for a better chance to take it down. As they waited, they noticed a peculiar sight near them - a sycamore tree with an unusual object resembling a curved tusk sticking out of it. Caspar, with his keen eye, observed it closely, noticing a dark circular disc around it, unlike the tree's bark. This discovery intrigued them and momentarily distracted them from the looming threat of the elephant.|"['Question 1: Why did the trio decide to use their ammunition sparingly?\nA) They were afraid of running out of bullets\nB) They wanted to save ammunition for future use\nC) They were planning to scare off the elephant with limited shots\nD) They were not skilled marksmen\nE) They were eager to shoot at the elephant', 'Question 2: What did Karl and Caspar fear might happen if they shot all their lead at the elephant?\nA) The elephant might run away\nB) The elephant might become aggressive\nC) The elephant might not be harmed\nD) The elephant might retaliate\nE) The elephant might call for help', ""Question 3: Why did the trio decide to wait for a better chance to take down the elephant?\nA) They were tired and needed a break\nB) They wanted to observe the elephant's behavior\nC) They were hoping for reinforcements to arrive\nD) They were afraid of the elephant's strength\nE) They were waiting for the elephant to fall asleep"", 'Question 4: What distracted the trio momentarily from the looming threat of the elephant?\nA) A sudden noise in the distance\nB) A peculiar sight near them\nC) A sudden gust of wind\nD) A passing bird\nE) A distant roar of another animal', 'Question 5: What did Caspar observe about the unusual object near the sycamore tree?\nA) It was a branch of the tree\nB) It was a piece of metal\nC) It resembled a curved tusk\nD) It was a shadow cast by the tree\nE) It was a bird perched on the tree', 'Question 6: How did the trio react to the discovery of the unusual object near the tree?\nA) They ignored it and focused on the elephant\nB) They decided to investigate it further\nC) They became more alert and cautious\nD) They laughed at the strange sight\nE) They called for help to deal with it']"|"['A) They were afraid of running out of bullets', 'C) The elephant might not be harmed', ""D) They were afraid of the elephant's strength"", 'B) A peculiar sight near them', 'C) It resembled a curved tusk', 'B) They decided to investigate it further']"
"Caspar was amazed by the strange objects in the tree - a tusk-like protrusion and a dark disc. He noticed movement in the tusk and shared his discovery with Karl and Ossaroo. As they observed, the tusk disappeared into the tree, leaving a hole, then reappeared. A dark hole emerged next to the tusk, hinting at a hidden cavity. Karl and Caspar were puzzled, speculating if it was a bird's bill or a toucan. Ossaroo, unfamiliar with toucans, identified it as a ""hornbill"" or ""rhinoceros bird."" The group debated how such a large bird could enter and exit through a small hole.

The hornbill is a fascinating bird known for its unique nesting habits. When the female hornbill is ready to lay eggs, she carefully selects a hollow tree large enough to accommodate her nest and her own body. Once the nest is built and the eggs are laid, she diligently sits on them until they hatch and the chicks are almost ready to fly. To protect the female during this vulnerable time, the male hornbill uses his beak to seal the nest entrance with mud. This ingenious design prevents predators like weasels and snakes from getting inside. The male hornbill's act of sealing the nest is essential for the safety of the female and her eggs. The hornbill's distinctive appearance, with its large beak and helmet-like protuberance, makes it easily recognizable. There are different species of hornbills, each with unique characteristics and habits, making them a fascinating subject for study.|"['1.

Karl knew a lot about the hornbill's behavior, but he didn't share it with his friends at that moment. They were all too busy observing the male bird. The male bird wasn't a herbivore; he landed with a piece of a dead snake in his beak meant for his mate. The female bird was ready for her meal, and the male deftly handed over the snake to her. After serving her, he flew off, possibly to bring dessert. The adventurers then turned their attention back to the elephant, waiting to see if it would leave. As they watched, they heard a soft, plaintive sound from the direction of the hornbill's nest. It wasn't a bird or human voice but a quadruped, resembling a raccoon but with distinct differences. The creature, known as _ailurus fulgens_, was a beautiful animal with a shiny coat. Karl recognized it and shared its scientific name with his friends.|"['1.

The panda, observed by Karl and Caspar, displayed a fondness for bird eggs. It attempted to raid a hornbill nest but was thwarted by the male bird's defense. As the panda stood its ground against the bird's attack, a surprising turn of events occurred. The female hornbill, witnessing the struggle from inside the nest, seized the opportunity to strike the panda in the eye with her beak, causing the intruder to cry out in pain and retreat. However, the panda's troubles were far from over as Fritz, a nearby dog, joined the fray, attacking the panda. Just when it seemed the panda would survive this encounter, an elephant, seeking vengeance, charged towards the panda, sealing its unfortunate fate. The panda, a victim of a series of unexpected events, met its demise in a dramatic and unfortunate conclusion.|"[""1.

The group of friends watched in horror as the elephant ruthlessly trampled the panda to a shapeless mass. Once the elephant left, they debated descending from the tree but were cautious of the rogue's potential return. Ossaroo bravely volunteered to investigate if the coast was clear. He stealthily made his way to check on the elephant's whereabouts. Meanwhile, the friends reloaded their guns and stood ready in case of an attack. After a tense wait, Ossaroo returned with Fritz, the faithful dog, by his side. The shikaree shared his suspicion that the elephant might be more than just an animal, hinting at a supernatural presence. The group realized they needed to confront the elephant to ensure their safety and devised a plan to deal with the menacing creature.|"['1.

Ossaroo, when questioned, couldn't confirm seeing the elephant arrive at the hut, but he tracked it through the dense forest and spotted it moving towards the hovel. Karl suggested they halt their survey until the elephant was dealt with, as it had become aware of them and was angered by their actions. Following the elephant's trail back to the hut, they noticed signs of its passage like footprints and broken branches. Ossaroo, experienced in tracking elephants, deduced that the rogue was on a determined path, possibly seeking revenge. As they approached the hut cautiously, they found it destroyed, raising fears that the elephant had targeted them.

They watched in fear and awe as the elephant destroyed the house. The young Christian companions, equally superstitious, understood the elephant was the cause. Despite its absence, they sensed its intelligence. The elephant had vanished, leaving total destruction behind. Their ammunition was lost, a bitter blow. Anxious about the elephant's return, they wondered where it had gone. Karl and Caspar doubted it could hide nearby, but Ossaroo, drawing on his experience, warned that elephants could cunningly conceal themselves. Suddenly, the argus pheasants' alarm revealed the elephant's presence. As it charged towards them, they panicked, unsure of how to escape. They fired their guns, but the elephant kept coming, prompting a frantic search for an escape plan.|"['1.

The hunters found themselves in a perilous situation as they faced a vengeful rogue elephant. The shikaree, wise in his experience, knew that arrows were futile against such a massive creature. With no escape route in sight and the elephant closing in, the shikaree spotted a lone tree that could provide temporary safety. Urging the young sahibs to follow, they sprinted towards the tree. Fritz, the faithful dog, unable to climb, swam across to safety. The elephant, enraged by their evasion, tried to uproot the tree in a fit of fury. The hunters, now perched high in the branches, knew their respite was only temporary. With dwindling ammunition and a relentless adversary, their future was uncertain.

Caspar had a clever idea to escape their tree-bound predicament. He remembered the bear cave reachable only by a ladder, which the elephant couldn't access. Although they would be safe in the cave, they couldn't work on ladders due to the lack of light. As time passed, their confidence waned, realizing they might face a long siege. Hunger and thirst plagued them, exacerbated by the sight of water below. Caspar ingeniously used a cord to fetch water from the lake to quench their thirst. The fear of starvation and discomfort from perching on branches haunted them. Uncertainty loomed as they grappled with the possibility of a sleepless, supperless night.|"[""1.

The flask was quickly emptied, refilled, and emptied again until all were satisfied, quenching their thirst. This ingenious trick by Caspar improved their endurance of the situation. Just when they thought the elephant was thirsty too, it surprised them by drenching them with water from its trunk. The elephant continued this unexpected shower, soaking them completely. Their discomfort was evident as they were almost washed off their seats. The elephant seemed to enjoy this act, but suddenly it stopped and showed signs of pain or fear. It was sinking into quicksand, much to the surprise of the onlookers. This unexpected turn of events left them in awe of the situation they found themselves in.|"['1.

Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo watched in horror as the elephant sank deeper into the quicksand. The water rose rapidly, submerging the creature inch by inch until only its head and trunk remained visible. Ossaroo, angered by the loss of his skirt, taunted the struggling elephant. When only the trunk was left above the surface, Ossaroo swiftly ended the elephant's suffering with a single cut. The adventurers were relieved that the dangerous elephant was gone, saved by an unexpected turn of events. Fritz, the faithful dog, emerged unharmed and was commended for his wise retreat.

The plan to turn the cave into their home was abandoned as they no longer felt it was safe due to the absence of the threatening elephant. Ossaroo assured them that no other rogue elephants would be in the valley. However, they were still wary of other dangerous creatures like panthers, leopards, tigers, or bears. They decided to strengthen their old hut with a sturdy door and a fireplace for warmth. Despite the winter weather, they were well-prepared with yak skins for clothing and bedding. Concerns arose about food as the elephant had ruined their provisions, but they hoped to hunt with Ossaroo's arrows and traps. They scouted the valley for a way out and began crafting ladders from cedar trees for a potential escape, wishing they had bamboo for quicker construction.|"[""1.

The deodar tree, also known as the cedar, is a tall pine tree found in the Himalayas. It can grow up to a hundred feet tall with trunks over ten feet in diameter. The wood of the deodar is highly valued for its durability and is used in building bridges and structures. The deodar is also known for its turpentine properties, with the sap being used to extract cedar oil for medicinal purposes. The deodar's wood is easily split into planks, making it ideal for construction in regions where saws are scarce.

"Karl was pleased to see the ""cheel"" growing close by. They could use it to make torches for light during dark nights. They quickly cut down slender trees for the ladder sides. They chose trees about fifty feet tall, which yielded thirty-foot lengths. Drilling holes for ladder rungs was the hardest part. They lacked tools, so Karl heated his pistol barrel to make a boring iron. It took many hours and days, causing sweat and tears, to burn out four hundred holes for the ladder rungs. Karl had foreseen this challenge and found a creative solution."|['1.

When Karl completed the unusual task he had set for himself, only a few steps remained to finish the ladder. Each pair of sides needed to be joined, the rounds inserted, and securely fastened at each end. Once done, a ladder was ready to be climbed. The ladders were raised one by one to their ledges, successfully scaling three-fourths of the cliff. Unfortunately, their climbing was abruptly halted when they reached a ledge that had a rock hanging over it, making it impossible to place a ladder there. Karl, realizing the insurmountable obstacle, sadly informed his companions. Disheartened and defeated, they sat in silence, gazing at the ladders they had painstakingly built, now rendered useless. The disappointment was profound, overshadowing the cold winter air and the dwindling food supplies at their hut. They trudged back home, resigned to the grim reality that they might never return.|"[""1.

After a tiring day, the group was looking forward to a warm supper in the cozy hut. However, their hopes were dashed when they discovered that their food had been stolen by a wild animal. Despite their exhaustion, they managed to sleep, but their rest was disturbed by the realization that their food supplies were depleted. With their ammunition destroyed, hunting for food became impossible. They faced the grim reality that they might not be able to survive in the valley without any means to procure food.

Karl, Ossaroo, and Caspar were ready for the hunt. Each armed themselves differently, preparing for the chase. Hunger drove them, eager for their breakfast. They split up to increase their chances of success. Caspar imitated the bark of the barking-deer to lure it closer. This tactic had worked well for him in the past. Hunger made them less picky about their meal, willing to eat the less tasty deer. Caspar knew a spot where the deer often gathered, and he headed there with determination. He moved cautiously, crawling silently to avoid alerting any nearby prey. Hunger and the desire for a successful hunt fueled his every move as he crept closer to the glade where the deer were likely to be found.|"['1.

Caspar, a young hunter, scanned the glade in search of game but found none, feeling disappointed. He had hoped to impress with a venison breakfast. Despite the setback, he remained hopeful that his decoy calls might lure a kakur out. Just as the real kakur responded, Caspar heard a rustling in the bushes. Peering through the foliage, he spotted the deer but couldn't get a clear shot. Caspar took aim, and as he clicked his gun, he heard another click from the direction of the kakur. Startled, he saw his brother, Karl, on the opposite side, both armed. A moment of tension passed before they realized their near-fatal mistake. Relieved, they embraced, grateful to have avoided a tragic accident.|"['1. What was Caspar searching for in the glade?\nA) Rabbits\nB) Deer\nC) Kakur\nD) Pheasants\nE) Squirrels', ""2.

No explanation was required by either. Karl, after circling the lake on the other side, had wandered towards the clearing by chance. As he approached, he heard the barking of a kakur, unaware that it was Caspar pretending to be a decoy. Responding to the signal, Karl advanced towards the opening with the intention of hunting it. Upon nearing it, he stopped making the call, thinking the deer would be in the open. Just as he was about to shoot, Caspar's gun click prevented a fatal outcome. The shrill whistle of Ossaroo indicated a successful hunt. They found Ossaroo with a beautiful peacock, the most stunning bird they had ever seen. The peacock was being prepared for a meal, with Ossaroo showing pride in his successful hunt. Karl and Caspar, empty-handed, helped with the cooking, eager for a delicious breakfast.|"['1.

The peacock was a feast for the adventurers, leaving only bones behind. Despite the savory roast lifting their spirits, they worried about finding more food since their powder was destroyed. The bow and arrow, an ancient and universal weapon, intrigued them. They pondered how to secure their next meals. Ossaroo's skills had provided breakfast, but what about dinner and supper? Replenishing their food supply became crucial. They debated having fish, fowl, or peacock for dinner. An unexpected sound led them to an ibex on the cliffs above, providing them with meat for a week. The sun shone as they discussed their next steps outdoors, grateful for the meal that had quite literally fallen into their laps.|"['1.

Ossaroo believed the animal they saw was a goat, but as he had never been so high up the mountains, he wasn't sure. Caspar and Ossaroo thought it resembled a goat. They could see the creature clearly on a cliff, standing majestically. Although it looked small from a distance, it was actually much larger than a common goat. Caspar wanted to shoot it, but the others stopped him, explaining it was too far away. The ibex was over a hundred yards away and four hundred feet above them. Karl explained that goats have different varieties and are often confused with wild sheep. He described the ibex as a wild goat with distinct characteristics from sheep.

In summer, ibex migrate to high places for food, far from their winter homes. This journey starts when snow melts, moving gradually from hill to hill. Males stay in large groups, separate from females, resting during the day on snow beds or rocks. By evening, they head to grazing areas miles away, walking slowly at first, then trotting or running. They stay in high regions until October, then mix with females and descend to winter homes. Females wander less, some staying in the same area all year. Ibex are cautious, with sharp sight and smell, easily scared by humans or gunshots. They climb and leap over tough terrains swiftly. They are agile and enduring animals, capable of navigating challenging landscapes with ease.|['1.

Upon first sight, the new ibex seemed to be sneaking up on the other, as if planning a cowardly attack to push it off the cliff! Indeed, this was his true intention, as revealed later. If the other ibex had stayed still for just six seconds longer, the attacker would have succeeded. Caspar's voice delayed the attack briefly, but not for long. Caspar's warning cry startled the imperiled ibex, making him aware of the danger. Swiftly, he turned to face his adversary. There was no sign of retreat; he accepted the challenge. With no room to escape, he had to stand his ground. The fight began with both rearing up and clashing horns. The attacker had the upper hand due to better ground and space to maneuver. The weaker ibex was forced into a defensive position. The fight ended tragically as the attacker's horns launched the other ibex off the cliff, resulting in a fatal fall.|"['1.

In the rugged Himalayan mountains, fierce battles between wild animals like the ibex, tahir, burrell, and Ovis ammon rams are common. These clashes often take place near steep cliffs, where the combatants risk being pushed over the edge. Surprisingly, the defeated animals can survive such falls, as seen when an ibex rebounded after an 80-yard drop without injury. Similarly, American bighorn sheep are known to perform incredible feats by leaping off cliffs and landing unharmed. While these stories may sound exaggerated, wild goats and sheep possess remarkable leaping abilities that defy belief. Nature equips these animals with unique adaptations that allow them to survive extreme falls.

"The triumphant ibex stood proudly on the cliff, reflecting on its recent victory over a rival. However, the cry from below startled the ibex, alerting it to the presence of two large, sharp-winged eagles known as ""bearcoots."" The eagles, screeching and swooping, were set on attacking the ibex for its earlier actions. The ibex, initially paralyzed by fear, attempted to defend itself but was outmaneuvered by the birds. Despite a brief struggle, the ibex was eventually overpowered by the eagles.

"The bearcoot had become entangled with the ibex it had caught, unable to free itself from the thick ""poshm"" wool coating the animal's skin. Despite its efforts to escape, the bearcoot found itself securely tied. Another bearcoot arrived to rescue its mate, attacking the captors until an arrow brought it down. Karl saw this as a sign of Providence and shared his gratitude with the others. They admired the ibex and eagles, longing for the freedom these creatures had beyond the mountain valley.

The plan initially seemed feasible, but upon closer examination, two major obstacles emerged. The first challenge was whether the bearcoot could lift a rope strong enough to support a person climbing. The rope needed to be over 200 yards long and sturdy to endure the ascent. The second concern was if the rope could be secured at the top once the bearcoot carried it up. The group couldn't manage this alone; it would rely on chance. The team anticipated these issues and devised a solution. Crafting a high-quality rope became crucial. Ossaroo, skilled at spinning, was entrusted with this task. Their hemp stockpile was ready for use, and they had a suitable rope in hand, though not long enough. They needed a rope both strong enough for safety yet light enough for the bearcoot to carry.|"[""1.

Karl confidently assured Caspar that they could determine the weight of an object without finished tools. By using a piece of stick as a beam and balancing it properly, they could create a makeshift scale. Even without proper weights, Karl proposed a method to create them using stones and his own body weight as a reference point. Caspar expressed doubt due to their changing body weights but Karl remained undeterred, suggesting they already had a standard of weight in their possession.

The task was clear; they needed to determine the weight of two hundred yards of rope. A balance was swiftly set up with precision, almost as if they were weighing gold. They compared twenty yards of the rope to stones whose weight they had already measured with bullets, calculating the pounds and ounces. This process revealed that eight times the initial amount equaled one hundred and sixty yards, the estimated quantity needed. The next step was to test if the eagle could lift this weight. Despite initial hopes, the eagle struggled to lift the load, only managing to raise it slightly off the ground. After a few failed attempts, it became evident that the plan was unsuccessful. However, Caspar, having a solution in mind to shorten the rope, saw potential in the eagle yet.|"['1.

Caspar thought the eagle couldn't ascend due to extra weight. He pondered if a shorter rope could work. Karl questioned the purpose of a 50-yard rope. Caspar suggested using a shorter rope to test. Caspar and Karl debated the plan. The eagle perched on a ledge, then flew. They decided to test the rope on a tree. Ossaroo climbed a tree to secure the rope. The sahibs held the rope, suspended in the air. They aimed to secure the rope to the cliff. The plan raised their spirits. They discussed using wooden steps on the rope. Ossaroo's plan differed from Karl and Caspar's. They tested the rope differently to ensure its reliability. Ossaroo's method involved climbing a tree to secure the rope for testing.|"['1.

The adventurers had a daring plan to use an eagle to escape the cliffs, but the attempt went awry. Ossaroo, the shikaree, lost control of the eagle, and it flew off with the rope trailing behind. Karl and Caspar were disappointed, thinking Ossaroo had failed. However, Ossaroo explained that he had to let go to avoid a dangerous leap. As they returned to their hut, Karl expressed a newfound appreciation for their humble shelter, calling it a true friend. Caspar, though, was homesick for the Bavarian Alps. Ossaroo longed for his bamboo hut and favorite foods. After supper, Caspar proposed using another bird for their escape plan, suggesting a Brahminy goose from the lake. But Karl doubted the bird's ability to carry their weight. Despite setbacks, the adventurers remained hopeful for a successful escape.|"[""1.

"Caspar and Karl were observing some birds circling above. Caspar was trying to guess the type of bird Karl was thinking of. Karl mentioned that the birds in the valley were mostly hawks, not of the same genus as eagles. As they watched two falcons, known as ""Churk"" falcons, circling Fritz, their dog, Caspar realized they were attacking him. The falcons swooped down in an attempt to steal Fritz's food, but he paid no attention to them. Caspar found it amusing that the falcons thought they could outsmart their brave dog.

Fritz, the boar-hound, was initially unfazed by the two falcons attacking him, responding with occasional growls. But as the birds got closer, his irritation grew. Their wings nearly struck his eyes, making him lose his cool. The falcons, one attacking from the front and the other from behind, forced Fritz to defend himself in both directions. Annoyed, he snapped at the birds but was clawed on the rear by one. This was the last straw for Fritz. He leaped to catch the falcon but missed as it flew away. The bird stole Fritz's piece of meat, leaving him disappointed. The onlookers found Fritz's reaction comical, laughing at his failed attempts.

Karl and Caspar were pondering a way to make a paper kite to carry a rope over a cliff. They lamented not having paper to construct the kite's wings. The botanist then shared knowledge about the _Thymelaceae_ family, including the Lagetta tree used for lace-like clothing. He mentioned species of daphnads whose bark can be made into paper, found in India, South America, and China. The botanist believed a paper-yielding daphne species might be in their valley, given the climate and bird transport of its seeds. He described the plant's lanceolate leaves and purplish hue. Caspar recalled encountering shrubs with lilac flowers, velvety lanceolate leaves, and a sweet scent, likely belonging to the daphne genus.|"['1.

"Caspar chuckled in response to the botanist's remark. ""But, brother,"" he continued, ""even if it is the shrub you mentioned, what's the use if we don't know how to turn it into paper?"" Karl challenged Caspar's certainty, saying, ""I'm not so sure we don't. I've read about the process in an old book on China. It's simple, and I think I remember enough to try. Maybe not fine paper, but something for our kite. We don't need the best quality. Too bad we don't have a post-office here. If we can make paper as good as packing paper, it will work for our kite."" Ossaroo joined the group, keen on the exploration. Fritz, coming out of the hut, followed silently. The thicket turned out to be daphne shrubs. Karl identified them by the leaves and berries. The bark was tough and bitter, causing Ossaroo's mouth to burn when he chewed it. Karl recognized the shrub as _Daphne Bholua_, used by the Nepalese to make coarse paper. Thanks to Karl's knowledge, they knew how to turn the bark into paper. They quickly stripped the bark from the trees, leaving the trees standing.

During the evening, the group worked on making paper inside a hut using torches made of cheel-pine for light. They shredded the daphne bark and boiled it with wood-ash in a pot. However, lacking a pot, they used the hot spring near the hut. To overcome the moving water issue, they placed the bark and ashes in a yak-skin, creating a bundle, and submerged it in the spring. After boiling, the bark was dried on a rock. Meanwhile, Caspar made a wooden mallet, and Ossaroo crafted a sieve from bamboo under Karl's guidance. Once the bark was dried, it was pounded into pulp with the mallet and then stirred in lake water to remove impurities. Karl then skillfully made paper by spreading the pulp on a sieve, draining it, and letting it dry to become paper.|['1.

The group worked diligently to craft a large kite from paper made out of boiled bark. The process took several days as each sheet needed to dry before the next one could be made. Karl and Caspar assembled the kite's frame while Ossaroo focused on creating the tail. The rope for flying the kite required meticulous twisting and testing for strength. The kite's framework was constructed from split bamboo, known for its strength and lightness. Glue made from the root of an arum was used to attach the paper. When the wind was right, they launched the kite from a cliff, hoping it would catch on the snow-covered slopes above. With a strong breeze, the kite soared high before descending towards the mountain, disappearing from view as it fell.|"['Question 1:\nWhat material was used to make the paper for the kite?\nA) Cotton\nB) Boiled bark\nC) Plastic\nD) Wool\nE) Silk', 'Question 2:\nWho focused on creating the tail of the kite?\nA) Karl\nB) Caspar\nC) Ossaroo\nD) The group\nE) An unknown person', ""Question 3:\nWhat material was the kite's framework made from?\nA) Plastic\nB) Metal\nC) Wood\nD) Split bamboo\nE) Cotton"", ""Question 4:\nWhat was used to attach the paper to the kite's framework?\nA) Tape\nB) Glue made from the root of an arum\nC) Rope\nD) Nails\nE) String"", 'Question 5:\nWhere did the group launch the kite from?\nA) A field\nB) A forest\nC) A cliff\nD) A beach\nE) A mountain', 'Question 6:\nHow did the kite behave after being launched?\nA) It flew straight up\nB) It stayed still\nC) It crashed immediately\nD) It soared high before descending\nE) It disappeared into the clouds']"|['B) Boiled bark', 'C) Ossaroo', 'D) Split bamboo', 'B) Glue made from the root of an arum', 'C) A cliff', 'D) It soared high before descending']
The trio's faces darkened as the rope was drawn in, but hope returned as Karl successfully tightened it. With joy and relief, they secured the rope to a large stone at the cliff's base. They planned to create steps for the ascent, ensuring the safety of their makeshift ladder. By tying sticks to the rope and securing them in place, they aimed to climb to freedom. The process was slow and required caution due to the height of the cliff. They knew it would take days, with breaks needed for rest.

Ossaroo, being the most skilled in handling ropes, took charge of attaching steps to the cord. His companions, Karl and Caspar, could only watch and offer encouragement. Ossaroo used a ladder to climb the first 30 feet of the cliff without the steps. However, only the first ladder could be used. Balancing on the sticks, Ossaroo expertly placed them along the rope. He climbed up and down, using his prehensile toes to grip the thin support. After a break, he climbed back up with more sticks. The day passed with breaks for meals, and Karl collected food while Ossaroo continued his work. As darkness fell, they returned to the hut. Fritz, the dog, showed admiration for Ossaroo's bravery. Despite the wind causing him to swing precariously, Ossaroo worked diligently, unfazed by the danger. Karl and Caspar worried, but Ossaroo persisted with pride and skill.|['1.

Ossaroo was attempting a perilous climb up the cliff using a rope and kite. As he ascended, a sudden danger unfolded - the kite became loose, dragging him down the cliff face. The spectators feared for his safety as he rapidly descended, hoping the resistance would slow his fall. Miraculously, Ossaroo's weight balanced the kite's pull, preventing a disastrous crash. The kite, now uncontrolled, swooped towards him like a bird of prey. Ossaroo narrowly dodged the kite's final descent, avoiding a serious injury. Despite the mishap, the group remained hopeful, attributing the incident to the wind. They decided to wait for better conditions to retry flying the kite. In the meantime, they focused on gathering provisions and preparing for their eventual escape from the valley.|"['1.

Ossaroo's nets and lines were useful for catching various fish of excellent quality. They discovered a large species of eel abundant in the lake, providing a reliable food source. Despite not always enjoying eels, they were comforted by the abundance, knowing it could sustain them if other resources failed. When a favorable wind allowed them to fly their kite to secure their freedom, they faced challenges. Despite multiple unsuccessful attempts due to the kite not catching on rocks or ice, they persisted. After many failed flights damaging the kite, they realized their mistake too late as the cord was lifted out of reach.

The attempts of all three were futile. The end of the rope dangled just out of reach, teasing them before swiftly vanishing over the cliff’s edge. Disappointment filled the air as they realized their chance to escape was gone forever. They had hoped the kite would catch, allowing them to climb out using a rope ladder. However, with the kite lost, their hopes were dashed. They searched for alternative materials to construct a new kite but found none.

The botanist was certain that a birch tree would be the perfect material for their kite, better than daphne paper. However, he doubted they would find one in the valley due to the warm climate. Karl, trying to stay positive, suggested they continue searching. After three days of exploring, they found neither the birch nor the daphne trees needed for the kite. Karl had considered making a balloon instead, but dismissed the idea due to lack of suitable materials. However, after the failed kite experiment, the idea of a balloon resurfaced. They discussed the possibility of making a balloon strong enough to carry weight, like a small animal. Although paper balloons were not an option, they pondered other materials that could work.|['1.

Caspar and Karl were contemplating the idea of creating a balloon to lift them out of their current situation. Caspar, the philosopher, explained that making a balloon was akin to crafting a soap bubble. By filling an airtight bag with heated air, it would become a balloon. The challenge lay in determining how much weight the balloon could carry, considering the materials available. Karl, feeling a bit underestimated by his brother's explanation, questioned the need for a constant fire burning in the balloon, which would typically require a fire-basket. Caspar clarified that for a short ascent, a single filling of hot air would suffice, eliminating the need for a suspended grate. The brothers pondered the practicality of constructing a balloon with the resources at hand, exploring the scientific principles behind hot air balloons.|"['1.

To build a balloon, the brothers decided to use eel skins. Caspar suggested boiling the skins to make them lighter. Karl, skeptical at first, tested the idea by boiling one skin and scraping it. The dried skin was indeed lighter. They calculated that they would need around 452 square feet of eel skins to cover a 12-foot diameter balloon. Since each eel skin could yield about a square foot, they estimated needing around 500 skins. Ossaroo was tasked with catching more eels to reach this number. Meanwhile, he spun fine and strong thread for sewing the skins together. The brothers worked diligently to prepare the materials for their balloon-making endeavor.|"['1.

Ossaroo produced enough thread to make cords and ropes for the balloon. Caspar skinned eels and prepared the skins. Karl, the engineer, cut and dressed the materials. Karl also collected gum from a ficus tree to seal the seams. After a week of work, they were ready to stitch the balloon. Once completed, they varnished it with gum. Karl inflated the balloon using a fire method he knew. They attached a wicker basket to the balloon to carry them. Karl explained the process of inflating the balloon using hot air. They were unsure if the balloon would lift them due to the weight of the materials and the high altitude. Karl was not very optimistic about the success of their experiment.|"[""1.

The philosophical truth had been on his mind from the start, and sometimes almost led him to quit the plan. However, since he wasn't sure of failing due to his limited knowledge of aerostation laws, he persisted with the goal of achieving success, though with faint hopes. Everything was prepared early. The large bag was placed between supporting stakes, the car attached, and ropes secured to prevent the balloon from drifting away. A stone furnace was set up to heat the air and lift the balloon. The fuel for the fire, chopped grass, and Cashmere shawl-wool, was ready. The car, not large enough for three, was to carry one person and a dog. Karl doubted the balloon's ability to lift all three due to their weight. If one could land on the cliff, the others could be rescued by villagers. Despite the risk, Ossaroo was chosen to attempt the ascent due to his knowledge of the area. As they prepared to ignite the fuel, the balloon failed to rise as expected, disappointing their hopes.|"[""1.

Karl worked tirelessly to fuel the balloon with grass and poshm, but to no avail. Despite the intense heat inside, the balloon refused to ascend more than six feet off the ground. Frustrated, Karl tried using pine faggots to increase the heat, but it made no difference. Disheartened, he abandoned the balloon, realizing their efforts were futile. Ossaroo, in a fit of disappointment, kicked the balloon, causing it to catch fire and burn down. The adventurers, feeling defeated, watched the balloon burn with indifference, symbolizing the end of their failed attempt to fly. The group sank into despair, realizing they were stranded in the valley with no hope of escape. Despite having books and nature around them, they felt isolated and desolate, unsure of how to cope with their newfound reality.|"['1.

The three companions, Karl, Caspar, and Ossaroo, found themselves in a challenging situation in a distant valley. Despite their initial despondency, they gradually realized the importance of taking action to ensure their survival. Karl, the botanist, took the lead in encouraging his companions to engage in activities that would provide them with food and drink. He emphasized the significance of remaining active and industrious to avoid succumbing to melancholy. Through Karl's initiative, they resumed their tasks, with the botanist exploring the valley for edible plants and medicinal herbs. The group relied on the seeds of the edible pine and the wild cockscomb to sustain themselves. Despite the hardships they faced, the companions began to regain their spirits and focus on practical matters to secure their well-being in the valley.|"['1.

"In the valley, Karl and Ossaroo discovered a variety of edible plants in the lake. They found the _Trapa bicornis_, also known as _Singara_, a horned water-nut, and the _Nelumbium speciosum_, a splendid water-lily with pink and white flowers. Karl shared how in Cashmeer, people used the water-lily's seeds and stalks as food. The boys learned that birds walked on the water near the lilies, standing on one leg, which Karl suspected was due to the lily leaves providing a firm footing. The _Nelumbium speciosum_ was identified as the Pythagorean bean and possibly the ancient ""lotus,"" known for its refreshing and strengthening properties. The plant's roots were stored for winter, and in China, it was served to British ambassadors as a delicacy."|"['1.

The _Nelumbium speciosum_ flowers emit a sweet aroma similar to anise when in full bloom. The acorn-shaped seeds have a rich almond flavor. Karl shared facts about the plant with his friends before. They now focused on the lilies, ready to harvest the seeds. Equipped with rush baskets, they waded into the water to collect the seeds. Suddenly, two large birds, identified as _adjutant storks_, flew overhead. The majestic birds caused Ossaroo to drop his sack of beans in excitement. The storks landed near the lake, revealing their distinctive features. Recognizing them from India, the trio marveled at the sacred birds of Brahma. The Hindoo's swift recognition led to an exclamation and the beans tumbling into the water.|"['1.

The area where the three waders landed was a small peninsula extending nearly to the bed of lilies. They stood knee-deep in water, only about twenty paces from the tip of the peninsula. The storks seemed unperturbed by the presence of the adventurers, standing tall and unbothered. These large birds, known as adjutants, are quite peculiar. They stand six feet tall with a beak over a foot long. Their black and white coloring is often muddied by their feeding habits. Adjutants have a distinctive naked, red neck and a large pouch on their chest. They are voracious eaters, preferring carrion and garbage, and are known to swallow prey whole.

A unique stork species found in Sumatra, different from those in Asia and Africa, is the Boorong Cambay. Surprisingly, these giant birds were unknown to the scientific world until recently. In Java, a similar species exists. The adjutant stork, common in Calcutta, acts as a scavenger and is welcomed by people, despite occasionally bothering farm animals. These storks can even enter buildings and snatch food. When in flocks, they resemble boats in water. They feed on carrion and have been seen near human remains. The sight of the storks evoked different feelings in the adventurers. Ossaroo felt a nostalgic connection, while Caspar considered their strength for a rescue mission.

Ossaroo's prediction came true almost immediately. The two birds landed by the lake, merely twenty paces away from where three waders were busy among lily leaves. Instead of searching for food or heading to the water, the birds rested in an unusual pose. They tucked their long necks between their shoulders, leaving only their heads and beaks visible. Simultaneously, they drew up one leg, concealing it under their feathers. This synchronized behavior hinted at a spiritual connection between them. The observers found it comical, but Ossaroo, accustomed to such sights, remained unperturbed. The group decided to capture the storks after returning their bean-sacks to the hut. Ossaroo believed they could easily approach the tame birds, but lacked the necessary tools. Despite unclear motives for capturing them, the idea of companionship seemed appealing, especially to Ossaroo, facing a solitary life in the mountain valley.|['1.

Karl had a secret plan that he kept from his companions. While joking with his brother, a serious thought struck him, and he grew quiet. He felt that being merry was inappropriate. Karl remained mysterious, refusing to explain his change in behavior. Despite this, he gave advice on capturing storks eagerly. Returning to the hut, Karl quickly prepared the tools with Ossaroo for the task. They approached the sleeping storks cautiously. However, a mishap occurred when Fritz, their dog, unexpectedly attacked one of the birds. Fritz's dislike for the birds stemmed from a past encounter in Calcutta. The birds had stolen Fritz's food, creating a lasting animosity. This incident led to Fritz's impulsive behavior towards the storks, jeopardizing their plan.|"['1.

The bird, disturbed by Fritz's actions, flew away swiftly followed by its mate. Fritz, in a fit of anger, wanted to handle the feathers roughly. The group was disappointed as the birds left, and Fritz was about to be scolded by Caspar. However, Karl's sudden exclamation shifted the focus from Fritz. Karl noticed something peculiar on the bird's legs as it flew off - a shiny object that gleamed like gold or brass. This mysterious object intrigued Karl, but the sun's glare made it hard to identify. Karl felt a sense of loss as the bird disappeared, thinking it held hope for them. Caspar, unaware of the significance, believed the birds might return and Ossaroo was trying to lure them back with his knowledge of their behavior.|"[""1.

"Karl exclaimed, ""Merciful Father!"" as he watched the storks fly and Ossaroo. ""Let him succeed! Caspar, hold Fritz tight, give Ossaroo a chance! Don't let the dog escape,"" Karl urged urgently. Caspar, surprised by his brother's excitement, obeyed and grabbed Fritz, holding him firmly. Ossaroo, prepared for difficulty in catching the storks, had a lure - a large fish to attract them.

Caspar and Ossaroo were captivated by the grateful and joyous expressions in the eyes of the storks. Despite their puzzlement at the birds' behavior, they fed them with care. The storks, unafraid and voracious, gobbled up the food without hesitation. Karl, determined to secure the storks, emphasized the need for a stronger rope to prevent their escape. With the storks safely tied up in the hut, the trio discussed their plans for deliverance. Each lost in their own thoughts, they eventually realized the potential of the inscription on a ring brought by one of the storks from Calcutta. Could this be the key to their escape?|"['1.

"Caspar excitedly exclaimed, ""Eureka! I've got it! I've got it!"" without delving deeper into his thoughts. ""Yes, dear Karl, I understand your plan—it's brilliant!"" ""So, you've finally figured it out,"" Karl retorted sarcastically. ""About time! The brass ring with its inscribed letters should have given it away sooner. But, let's hear your thoughts and see if you're right."" ""Of course!"" agreed Caspar, adopting his brother's playful banter. ""You're planning to change the role of our recent guests."" He gestured towards the storks. ""That's your idea, right?"" ""They won't be too pleased with your plans. The 'promotion' you have in store for them isn't exactly desirable. While I'm not sure about birds, most people wouldn't want to switch from military to civil service."" ""Ha! ha! ha!"" chuckled Karl, pleased with Caspar's astute deduction. ""Exactly, brother!
