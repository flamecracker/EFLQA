After a brisk half-hour walk, Gwen and Dick found themselves at a cliff edge that must have seemed like the end of the world to ancient islanders. The headland dropped steeply into the water, with menacing rocks jutting out warning any passing ships to steer clear.

Peering over, they saw Johnnie Cass, a mischievous boy from the village, stuck on a ledge. Gwen, known for her bravery, decided they needed to rescue him. With Gwen's help, they managed to pull Johnnie to safety, though it was a challenge for Gwen to climb back up without any assistance.

Gwen found herself in a predicament as she trudged through the snow, regretting not listening to her sister's advice about wearing a thick muffler. She had ventured out in the cold, and the weather had taken a toll on her. Exhausted and cold, she sought shelter under a juniper bush, realizing the danger of falling asleep in the snow. Just as despair set in, she heard a dog's bark in the distance, signaling the presence of a possible rescuer. With renewed hope, she followed the sound and found a man who led her to safety. Grateful and relieved, Gwen warmed up by a fire in Mrs. Rawlins' kitchen, answering questions about her unexpected adventure.

Winnie thought of creating a cozy spot at the end of the tennis lawn for relaxing. She planned to use stumps as seats and imagined having tea there.

Winnie took great pride in her little Partridge Wyandotte chicks, cared for by an old Plymouth Rock hen. She received the eggs from a nearby farmer's wife, and most of them hatched successfully. Winnie was diligent in caring for them, leaving detailed instructions for their care when she was at school. She entrusted their care to Gwen during choir practice, reminding her to feed them, provide clean water, and protect them from rats.

Gwen was in a frenzy, calling for the poker and searching for Jingles. Unable to handle the rat any longer, she dropped it into the water-butt and used a yard brush to hold it down until it drowned.

Later, Winnie praised Gwen as a heroine for her brave act. Gwen, feeling remorseful, buried the rat and struggled in class the next day.

Dad has been offered a new position, and it's causing quite a dilemma. The new place is in a polluted town with factories billowing smoke. While it offers more money, it's far from ideal. The family worries about school fees and the impact on their current community in Skelwick. Dad's torn between his work at Skelwick and the potential at Rawtenbeck.

From the cliffs overlooking the village, Gwen admired the vast sea with its red sails of fishing boats in the distance. Below, the village sprawled with its vibrant roofs and gardens, and the cove where boats rested. She spotted the Parsonage chimneys and the tennis lawn where Martin played. The church of St. John the Baptist stood out on the headland, a beacon in the wilderness. Gwen pondered who would care for the village if her father left. Skelwick had been neglected before his time, lacking a resident clergyman. Lost in her thoughts, Gwen decided to walk on the wold to clear her mind.

Gwen expressed her wish for her father to have his own parish in Skelwick, separate from North Ditton, so he could have more freedom. As they walked towards the village, they encountered a tourist whom Gwen guided. Beatrice cautioned Gwen about talking too openly to strangers and advised her to be careful on the moors. Gwen joked about her brother being a bigger blabbermouth. Later at church, a mysterious man arrived, left a generous donation, and swiftly departed. Despite Gwen's curiosity, the incident was quickly forgotten as she had bigger worries, including her strained friendship with Netta.

Gwen, who had borrowed a hammer from Winnie's hen-yard, was frustrated when it broke a fossil she was trying to extract. The girls, led by Miss Roberts, continued their fossil hunt along the coast. As they reached the cliffs in the bay, Miss Roberts ventured to a rock above, causing a sudden rockfall that injured her. The girls were at a loss until Gwen, who had training in first aid, stepped in to help. With her guidance, the girls fetched water and assisted in stabilizing Miss Roberts's leg.

Gwen instructed everyone to hold the injured person steady to prevent further harm. She explained that if the muscles contracted, the broken bone could cause serious damage. The group worked together to make the injured person more comfortable by using sand as a pillow and wetting her forehead. Gwen and some helpers went to find splints, using hazel bushes from the gorge. They had to work hard to gather suitable materials. Gwen then directed the others to use their handkerchiefs to make bandages. She showed them how to position the patient's foot correctly. Gwen's quick thinking and leadership impressed everyone. Eventually, help arrived with a stretcher, and a doctor set the broken bone properly.

Gwen proposed a brilliant idea to celebrate Miss Roscoe's tenure and the school's anniversary by raising funds for a Rodenhurst cot at the Convalescent Home. She suggested each girl collecting five shillings, totaling over seventy-five pounds. Additionally, hosting a grand gymkhana on anniversary day with a shilling admission for each of the anticipated six hundred guests could raise an extra thirty pounds. The plan gained widespread approval, and Gwen's leadership was recognized by both students and teachers. The prefects and juniors pledged their support, and Gwen's reputation in the school soared. With everyone's dedication, the fundraising efforts were off to a promising start, and it seemed likely that the target of £100 for the cot could be met even before the gymkhana event.|"[""1.

One afternoon, around two o'clock, Gwen strolled down the Rodenhurst garden towards the school's playing field. She carried her Virgil book, eager to study in the open air.

The second prize was awarded to Basil's classmate from the Boys' Preparatory Department, who dressed up as a golliwog, complete with a blackened face, fuzzy hair, and Dutch jointed dolls hanging from his bicycle.

Voting took place in the classroom after morning school. Each girl received a half sheet of notepaper and an envelope from Miss Douglas. They wrote down two champions' names, folded the paper, and sealed it. No signatures were allowed to keep the votes anonymous. The process was quick, with many girls scribbling names in disguised handwriting. Netta, more anxious than others, didn't join the others at the tennis grounds. Instead, she sneaked into Miss Roscoe's study and saw the envelopes marked with a large V. Netta, daring and with few scruples, took envelopes and paper from the room. Ida Bridge, who disliked Netta since a previous incident, followed her and peeked into the Fifth Form room.
