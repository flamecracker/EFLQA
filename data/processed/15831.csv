"Title: The Cantilever Bridge Adventure

Building the Cantilever Bridge involved several key steps. First, the frames for the bridge had to be set up. This required erecting the towers and binding and anchoring the structure securely. The center panels of the bridge were crucial for its stability and strength. However, a serious interruption occurred during the process, leading to the dispossessed farewell to Willow Clump Island.

Reddy's Cantilever Bridge was the brainchild of Bill, a remarkable and ingenious young boy, known as the Scientific American Boy. With the guidance and knowledge of his uncle, a civil engineer, Bill was able to overcome challenges and create something truly exceptional. The adventures and discoveries of Bill and his friends along the Delaware River were chronicled in the ""Records and Chronicles of the Society for the Scientific Investigation, Exploration and Exploitation of Willow Clump Island,"" revealing the exciting journey of a group of curious and inventive young minds."|"['1.

This is how our society was founded. Bill, an orphan I met at school, was sent there because his uncle had to work in Brazil. Bill and I became close friends as roommates. During Christmas break, I invited him to my home in Lamington, a village by the Delaware River. We went ice skating on the canal, a tradition every December. The wind changed direction, making it hard for Bill to skate. As we tried sails the next day, we ended up eight miles away at Raven Hill due to the strong wind. We then sailed to Willow Clump Island, where Bill shared his adventures in the Adirondacks. The idea of camping there excited me, inspired by Bill's tales of adventure.|"['1.

We raced to the Lumberville depot, barely catching the train. Arriving at Lamington a bit late and weary, we shared our exaggerated adventure with the boys. Excited by the idea of camping, we decided to explore Willow Clump Island. Bill became the president, Dutchy the vice-president, and Reddy the treasurer of our new society. I was appointed as the secretary to keep records. We crafted sails for our expedition using old sheets. Bill designed a unique double sail, while we also made a smaller single sail. The sails were attached to spars and guided with ropes. The crew needed to work together to navigate the sail effectively. It was an exciting time as we prepared for our exploration of the island.|['1.

The triangular lanteen sail proved to be a successful design for our skater. Measuring eight feet on one side, seven and a half feet on another, and six and a half feet on the third, it was secured to a boom and yard. The boom and yard were connected by a leather strap forming a hinge, with a rope attached for control. To keep the sail steady, we had to find a way to secure the mast. Initially, Bill suggested tying it to his leg, which was risky. Reddy then cleverly devised a leather step for the mast. We also experimented with a Danish sail, inspired by a French paper, which featured a topsail for wind control. Despite some falls and challenges, we eventually mastered these sails with caution and practice.|"['1.

The following day, which was Sunday, it started snowing, and our plan to skate to Willow Clump Island was ruined. It snowed all afternoon and the next morning we woke up to eight inches of snow on the ground. Instead of being upset, we saw this as an opportunity for new challenges and fun. The members of the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I. gathered in the woodshed after breakfast to figure out how to reach the island. They decided to make snowshoes. The first pair was made from wooden chair seats and proved to be light and useful. Another pair was crafted from barrel staves, and a third pair was made from barrel hoops covered in canvas. They also learned about different types of snowshoes from a book and made a Sioux snowshoe from hickory strips. They weaved twine to create the webbing for the snowshoes using a makeshift needle.|['1.

The Iroquois snowshoe was crafted using long hickory strips, 8 feet in length, bent into a loop and secured with bolts. To bend the wood without breaking it, boiling water was poured over burlap-wrapped sticks. Once steamed, the frame was shaped and dried before weaving the web with cane strips. Another snowshoe resembling Fred's barrel-hoop design was made, inspired by the Ainus of Japan. This oval shoe was created by lashing two 4-foot hickory strips together and weaving the filling diagonally. The snowshoes proved essential after a snowstorm, allowing easy travel over a thick snow crust. Though initially awkward, practice made using the snowshoes second nature. The Swiss snowshoe and Norwegian ski were left for future exploration, marking the end of the snowshoe-making adventure.|"['1.

The Norwegian ski was crafted from sturdy wood, measuring 1 inch thick, 3-1/2 inches wide, and 6 feet long. After soaking the ski's front end in hot water to make it flexible, it was bent and secured in place using a shoe and a cleat. Once dry, straps were added for the toe and ankle, with a cleat at the heel. To improve traction, a groove was cut into the ski's bottom. Ski sticks were used for balance and steering. The Swiss shoe, fashioned from willow, originated as swamp shoes and proved successful for exploring. Plans for the Easter break and a summer outing were discussed at the society's farewell meeting, with hopes of parental approval. Bill's Uncle Ed, an enthusiastic supporter, would join the summer expedition, easing concerns about parental consent.|"['1.

When spring finally came, and we went back to Lamington for our Easter break, we had gathered nearly $15.00. This money was enough to buy materials for a tent. Bill calculated that we needed 34 yards of canvas, 30 inches wide, to make a tent 7 feet wide and 9-1/2 feet long. However, canvas was too expensive, so we opted for drill material at ten cents a yard. We bought enough drill for $3.00 and headed back to start making our tent. We cut and sewed the pieces together, creating the roof and side walls. We also made end walls or doors for the tent. Ropes and loops were attached for support, and the front and rear posts were set up with a ridge pole. After setting up the tent in the backyard, we used stakes and guy ropes to secure it and ensure it was well-constructed.|['1.

The ties for the tent were initially made of wood, but later, galvanized iron wire was used due to the wood ties swelling and splitting when exposed to weather. The walls were secured with railway spikes or wooden pegs through loops, with the spikes being preferred for their weight. The tent was found to be smaller than expected, prompting the addition of an annex for supplies, creating a two-room tent. The annex had a slanting ridge and was attached to the main tent with tie strings. A tent fly was added to prevent rain from seeping through the thin canvas. This preparation was necessary as a heavy summer shower almost drenched the campers on the first night.|['1.

On a bright and clear morning of July 2nd, the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C. I. members were up before dawn. Excited boys scurried between the barn and the canal, carrying mysterious bundles onto a freshly painted scow. Reddy Schreiner, known for being a sleepyhead, surprised everyone by being awake early. The group embarked on a journey, towing the barge along the canal to Lumberville. The boys took turns towing and steering the boat, finally arriving at their destination by noon. They unloaded their belongings, waded across the shallow river, and set up camp in a clearing on the island. Uncle Ed and Mr. Schreiner later joined them, and together they explored the area, using planks from an old bridge for various purposes. Uncle Ed even crafted a table for them to use during their stay.|['1. What were the S. S. I. E. E. of W. C.

Uncle Ed demonstrated how to create a water filter using a pail, stones, charcoal, sand, and gravel. The filter worked well but was too small, prompting plans for a larger one. The next day, the group split up to explore the island. Dutchy's party found a small island nearby. Without discovering a spring, Uncle Ed decided to construct a larger filter using cider barrels, sand, charcoal, and gravel. The group worked together to fill the filter with water from the river. Dutchy's solo adventure led to him missing supper, emphasizing the importance of a dinner call.

"Once upon a time, during a railroad inspection in Macedonia, the narrator encountered a unique instrument called a ""klepalo"" used in a Bulgarian village. The klepalo, a wooden beam struck with a hammer to call people to church, replaced the traditional bell due to poverty. Inspired, the group built their own klepalo using seasoned oak from Lumberville. The instrument, suspended by a rope, was used by the camp cook to summon everyone for meals. Additionally, they crafted surveying instruments, including a compass socket and tripod, using simple materials like wood and homeopathic pill bottles filled with water for leveling. This resourceful approach allowed them to explore Willow Clump Island effectively. By cleverly adapting tools, they navigated their new surroundings with precision and ingenuity."|"['1.

We created a surveyor's chain using wire links that were 12 inches long instead of the standard 7.92 inches. The wire we used was No. 16 galvanized iron, which was quite rigid. To ensure uniformity in size and shape, we utilized a form made of a 1-inch board with two 1/2 inch holes drilled 11-1/2 inches apart. Oak pins were driven into the holes, and blocks of oak were secured nearby. Each link was carefully measured and adjusted if necessary. Every tenth link had a double ring at the end for easy identification. Additionally, we crafted a surveyor's rod from a 6-foot stick of wood with a sighting disk mounted on it. The disk, made from a 6-inch square board, was 6 inches in diameter and had a thickness of 1/2 inch. A white paper marked with quarters and painted black was pasted on the disk to aid in sighting the center from a distance. Uncle Ed explained how to calculate the length of the other two sides and the size of the third angle of a triangle given the length of one side and the angles it makes with the other two sides.|"[""1.

In our surveying adventure, we learned how to measure distances using triangles. By extending lines until they intersect, we created triangles to measure sides accurately. For example, with a base line of 10 feet, we used angles and a compass to find the distance to a tree. By drawing the triangle to scale, we could estimate the tree's distance. We also measured the width of a river by creating triangles with known angles and base lines. This method helped us determine the river's width accurately. Our surveying journey taught us how to use triangles and angles to measure distances and explore our surroundings.|"['1.

Lake Placid was our go-to swimming spot. We loved diving in from a tree's branches that hung over the water, acting as a natural springboard. Most of us were excellent swimmers, except for Dutchy, who struggled with anything beyond paddling. Luckily, Uncle Ed, a skilled swimmer, took Dutchy under his wing and helped him improve. Uncle Ed even taught us some cool swimming techniques. I didn't bother taking notes during these lessons; swimming is all about practice, not reading. Beginners should jump right into the water to learn. It's essential to get comfortable putting your head underwater. Dutchy, who initially hesitated to swim, later improvised a raft from a bridge plank and ended up in an adventurous river ride, narrowly escaping dangerous rapids with Uncle Ed's guidance.|"['1.

Uncle Ed, a skilled teacher, emphasized the importance of remaining calm during emergencies. He instructed us on how to administer aid in accidents, like pumping air into a patient. He stressed the need for steady and slow actions, cautioning against excitement. Demonstrating on Dutchy, he showed us how to squeeze water out of a patient, dry their nose and mouth, and secure their tongue. He then proceeded to pump the patient's arms, guiding us on the correct technique. Despite Dutchy's sudden discomfort, we learned valuable skills. Later, we embarked on a project to map Willow Clump Island, constructing roads and even a bridge across the mill-race under Uncle Ed's expert guidance. The bridge was a testament to our engineering skills, showcasing our ability to work together and problem-solve effectively.|"['1.

We created a fun aerial line using a rope and a swing seat that could transport us across the stream. By pulling on the rope, we could draw ourselves up and swing across. The swing seat was made by tying a board to a rope with a tackle block. However, we soon lost interest in the aerial line and repurposed the materials to build a rope suspension bridge. Using old barrels and staves from Lumberville, we constructed a flexible bridge that spanned the river. The bridge was shaky but strong, providing a way to cross. Additionally, we built a pontoon bridge at the head of the mill-race using cider barrels and slabs. Anchoring the barrels and laying the floor beams on them, we created a sturdy bridge that allowed us to cross the river safely.|['1.

"Our bridge building adventures extended beyond the island to the Schreiner estate in Lamington. Reddy Schreiner's house overlooked Cedar Brook, flowing gently from the hills to their ice pond. Eager to cross the brook, Reddy, Bill, and the society crafted a unique bridge. Combining a suspension and spar design, wires suspended the bridge floor from the spars planted in the banks. Despite initial unsteadiness, Uncle Ed's advice improved the design by adding braces to the spars. The second bridge, a ""king post truss,"" was a more challenging project over the gorge. Lacking a scow, they improvised a temporary bridge with logs and slats. These projects showcased creativity, teamwork, and problem-solving skills, enriching our bridge-building knowledge."|"['1.

We started by building the king posts for the bridge. Two strong posts, each 7 feet long, were connected at the top by a tie stick, spaced 4 feet apart. Notches and diagonal braces were used for a secure fastening. Each king post was notched about 30 inches from the top on opposite sides. A temporary tie piece was nailed across the lower ends. Four 15-foot spars were planted in the opposite banks and sawed to fit into the notches in the king posts. The spars were secured with wire nails. The king posts were sawed off and a cross beam was fastened to them with heavy wire straps. Floor beams were then nailed to the cross beam and inclined spars. A rustic floor made of small logs was added, along with a railing made of light poles. Meanwhile, we also focused on boating for pleasure on Lake Placid. Uncle Ed left us after teaching Bill how to construct a canvas canoe, which he bought supplies for in Millville. Mr. Schreiner later brought the supplies and wood for the canoe's framework.|['1.

We asked Mr. Schreiner to stay the night with us, and he agreed after crossing the river. The next day, we proudly showed him around our place, including our filter, the roads we built, the bridge to Kite Island, our surveying tools, and the map we made. He was impressed with our efforts and even ordered a bridge for us to build. He became our biggest supporter, defending us when others criticized our time on the island. After he left, we began work on a canoe. We used spruce for the keelson, stem, and gunwales. We crafted forms to shape the boat, secured the gunwales, added rib bands and cross ribs, and completed the frame with deck beams and corner pieces. Finally, we sanded the edges before covering the frame with canvas.|['1.

To build our canoe, we first laid the frame in the center of the canvas and sewed the edges together with long stitches. The canvas was laced over the frame like a shoe on a foot and then tacked to the keelson after applying white lead for waterproofing. Triangular pieces were cut at the stem and stern for a smooth fit. The canvas was then tightened, wrinkles smoothed out, and tacked along the gunwales. A keel plate and a coat of white lead and oil were added for finishing. The rudder was attached with a tiller for steering, and a detachable keel was provided for sailing. Two masts with lanteen sails were fixed with brass bands, and a double paddle completed our boat.|['1.

"One day, Fred returned from Lumberville with a large envelope from Uncle Ed containing a photo of Wichita Indians building a grass lodge. Inspired, we built a smaller hut on our island. We set up poles in a circle, creating a dome-shaped cage, then added bands and thatched the hut with straw. The location, however, was too hot, prompting the idea of a tree hut. We chose a gnarled oak tree overlooking the ""Goblins' Dancing Platform."" Accessible only by climbing a scraggly oak tree, this spot posed challenges in transporting building materials.

Our initial challenge was finding a new way to reach the top of the cliff. Along one side of the protruding ledge, there was a narrow crack in the rocks that extended from the base of the pillar to the foot of the cliff. Dutchy had once dared to maneuver down this zigzag crevice, causing us much worry as it was a perilous feat. By bracing against the rock walls and using the niches for support, Dutchy made his way down halfway before slipping and tumbling down, miraculously surviving with only scratches. Inspired by his adventure, we decided to use this crevice to transport materials for our tree hut. We crafted steps and ladders using sticks and ropes to help us navigate the steep terrain. To lift the building supplies, we ingeniously constructed a derrick and a makeshift pulley system, ensuring safety precautions were in place to prevent accidents.|"['1.

Our treehouse was built with care and precision. Two sturdy limbs extended from the main trunk, where we secured the first girder about seven feet out. The second girder was then nailed to the main trunk, supported by diagonal braces and a tie piece to prevent spreading. Rough sticks made up the girders, with cleats for added security. Floor beams were nailed across the girders, with slabs laid on top. We added a wall plate six feet above the flooring, supported by posts. Clapboard walls were installed, followed by rafters and roofing. The windows were framed with sliding sashes covered in canvas. Two doors were mounted on spools for easy opening and closing. A balustrade completed our treehouse, providing safety and charm.|['1.

We felt proud once the house was finished. We had a great view from the veranda of the river and our camp on the island. Dutchy and I lounged on the Goblins' Platform, watching a hawk above. The others had left us the scow to row back. As we prepared to leave, I saw a scow upriver, like ours, with two drunk men. Our scow was missing. How would we get back? The men saw us and laughed. We tried to signal the others but failed. We had to wade across. We held a council, and Dutchy and Jack stayed behind while we pursued in canoes. We found the scow near a campfire with six men. We waited until dark, then Bill pushed off the boat with a sleeping man inside. The men threw stones, but we escaped, dumping the man back on shore.|"[""1.

It was getting dark, and we struggled to find our way back to camp without the moon or stars visible due to the clouds. We followed the shoreline until we reached a beacon fire on Point Lookout. Feeling mischievous, we decided to play a prank on Dutchy. We pretended to be rowdy drunks, but our plan backfired when Dutchy and Jack retaliated with accurate aim using a crossbow. After discussing our adventure around the campfire, we realized the importance of a signaling system. We learned to moor our boats offshore using anchor stakes and a rope system.

"In the book, different combinations of movements were used to represent each letter of the alphabet and numbers from 1 to 0 using flags. The three movements began and ended by holding the flagstaff upright. The movements included swinging the flag down to the right, to the left, and forward. For example, the letter A was represented by the combination 22, meaning the flag is swept to the left twice. B was represented by 2112, indicating a sweep to the left, two sweeps to the right, and a final sweep to the left. Different combinations were used for various letters and numbers. Abbreviations in the manual saved time, like using 22 for the word ""after"" and signaling the end of a word with 3. At night, torches were used instead of flags, and the heliograph instrument was described for sending signals with sunlight flashes."|"['1.

We created a simple heliograph with a sight rod and a shutter. The sight rod was a wooden stick with a pointed end and a flat side. We attached a round disk to the rod with a tack, allowing it to cover or uncover the point. To secure the rod in place, we drilled a hole in the baseboard and inserted a nut with nails around it. A bolt was threaded through the nut to adjust the rod's height. The heliograph was mounted on a tripod and had a shutter made of two slats linked to a connecting rod. The slats were attached to a frame with trunnions, allowing them to open and close. A key operated the shutter, closing it with a spring when released.|"[""1.

We were prepared to start using our instruments. The heliograph was placed on the ledge at the cliff's peak. Initially, the disk was turned down, revealing the sighting rod's point. Bill peered through the unsilvered spot in the mirror, aligning the rod with the door of our straw hut where Jack sat ready to record our message. Reddy stood by with his wigwag flag to respond. Once the instrument was aimed correctly, the shutter was set in front, and the mirror was focused to reflect sunlight onto the hut. The International Telegraph Code was used to send messages. The key was pressed three times to signal readiness. The first message was a bit confusing, requiring Jim and Reddy to clarify. The mirror had to be constantly adjusted to keep the reflection focused. Eventually, we built a dual mirrored heliograph for better communication.|['1.

Our vacation was ending, and we turned to planning for the upcoming Christmas holidays. Last year, we were so busy preparing for a trip that we didn't have time to enjoy it. This time, we aimed to be ready in advance to fully enjoy the two-week break. Our winter gear was stored, and we discussed building an ice boat and sled. We decided to pack up early to return home before school started. After gathering our belongings and chickens, we journeyed back with Mr. Schreiner's help. Upon arriving, we relished a delicious meal and a comfy bed. We quickly started building the ice boat using a 2 by 4-inch scantling as the backbone and skates for the runners. The boat was simple but effective, with a seat at the rear. Our next task was to construct the steering runner using a third block.|"['1.

The steering system of our boat was carefully crafted using hardwood for durability. The rudder post, a 3-inch square block, was shaped to 10 inches in length. A large pin was formed by splitting the block and rounding it to 1-1/2 inches in diameter. The rudder post was then securely attached to the head with screws. The mast, an 8-foot pole tapering from 2 inches to 1-1/2 inches, was supported by a mast step bolted to the backbone. Stay ropes braced the mast to the forward end. The boom, a 9-foot pole tapering from 1-1/2 inches to 1 inch, was secured with cheek blocks and a throat halyard. The mainsail, attached with mast hoops and a peak halyard, was guided by a main sheet fastened to pulley blocks on the backbone and boom.|['1.

We built an ice boat following the instructions in a picture from Peary's Arctic expedition. The jib-sail was made according to Fig. 172, attached to a 3 feet 4 inches jib-boom fastened to the backbone with screw eyes. The sail's upper corner was tied to a jib-halyard secured to the mast's top, while two sheets were attached to the jib-boom and crossed the mast to the stern with cleats. Our sledge had hickory strips tapered for runners and side rails, spaced with spreaders, and fastened with screws and bolts. Crosspieces and flooring were added, and the rear slats held a bent hickory stick. The sled was shod with sleigh runner iron by the village blacksmith.|"['1.

"During our winter break, we planned to create a toboggan and a unique sled called a ""rennwolf."" Although Bill and I had to return to school before finishing them, Reddy and Jack took over. The toboggan was crafted from hickory boards fastened together with battens and screws. The rennwolf had hickory runners with upright posts and cross bars for support. A square board served as the seat, and leather loops on the runners held the rider's feet. The rennwolf could spin quickly when one foot pushed against the snow. To prevent slipping, leather straps with tacks were attached to the propelling foot. Despite missing out on completing our summer plans, we discovered new ways to enjoy our free time at school."|"['1.

Bill had read that tree roots could support a cave roof, so we dug under a cedar tree. The tunnel was four feet long when the sand collapsed, burying us. Friends dug us out, but we kept it secret from the principal. Chester Hill offered lumber from his uncle's mill for a safer wooden roof. We marked out the cave, transplanted bushes, and dug 10 feet down for an 8x10 foot cave with a 2x6 foot passageway. Chester promised to bring the lumber for our cave house.|['1.

The digging was finished by Saturday, and Hillock arrived with a load of slabs. Slabs, though not ideal, were used due to limited resources. Eight slabs were chosen for corner posts, some cut to 8 feet and others to 6 feet. They were placed at corners, forming the structure. The sides were boarded up with slabs and a passageway was left. Slabs were also used for floor beams and flooring. Rafters were added with a slant for water drainage. The roof was made by overlapping slabs. A stovepipe was set for ventilation. The passageway was floored and roofed. The house was covered with a thin layer of soil and sodded. Grass seeds were planted for a natural look. A bush concealed the entrance to the cave, hidden beneath the knoll.|['1.

We formed a secret club in our underground cave, breaking school rules. Mr. Clark, aware of our hideout, even joined us for chess. Our nightly meetings, held in darkness, involved a rotating watch schedule to avoid getting caught. The thrill of sneaking in and out added to the excitement. Our main joy was the adventure itself, not the brief meetings or banquets. We had a special club pin, a silver beetle with hidden meaning. To keep intruders out, we installed a padlocked door with a clever combination lock. Our secret signals and signs added to the mystery.

"On each spool's top, we attached a white cardboard disk with graduated edges. This disk had a hidden code, like 11-19, that aligned a tooth and notch to open a door when the numbers matched. Changing this code was crucial to keep it secure. Bill informed us that Dutchy had rigged our old boat to sail on water instead of ice due to unfrozen river sections. Disappointed, we boarded the boat, and Dutchy's failed attempt at steering left us adrift. With no rudder or oar, we had to wait for the wind to guide us back to land.

Returning to our journey back to Lamington, we didn't spend much time out at sea before the current guided us back to the ice ledge. Reddy hopped off and retrieved the steering oar, and we continued our voyage homeward, alternating between water and ice. At times, the boat struggled to climb out of the water due to its weight with four boys onboard. We had to push off a few times to gain momentum. While Dutchy's idea was clever, it needed refinement. Bill, quiet until then, seemed lost in thought. He had a plan for improvement but didn't want to spoil Dutchy's joy. After a meeting, Bill proposed a scheme to Mr. Van Syckel, who was impressed. We modified a sleigh into a scooter canoe, using sails from our ice boat. The boat was enhanced with runners, crosspieces, and a mast for the sails.

Once our scooter canoe was finished, we readied ourselves for the long-awaited winter journey to Willow Clump Island. The weather was perfect, with ten days of consistent cold and a heavy snowfall. We could trek on snowshoes or use the scooter canoe and scooter scow on the river. The canal was only an option if the wind blew from the south. We set off on a Tuesday morning after Christmas. Bill and Dutchy sailed up the river while the rest of us pulled the sledge on the canal towpath. We carried a week's worth of supplies and plenty of blankets. Despite some challenges, like Dutchy struggling with the heavy scow, we all made it to the island. We found the straw hut covered in snow, but with some effort, we cleared a path and started a fire using birch bark.|"['1.

During a summer outing, Jack faced challenges cooking over an open fire due to the wind scattering heat. To improve, they built a fireplace with logs, stones, and a draft. The next summer, they built a circular stone fireplace with a draft opening. When spending a cold night in a hut, they couldn't light a fire inside. The next morning, after a warm meal and fire, they forgot the cold. They decided to spend the next night in a treehouse. Equipped with ice creepers and a wooden stick, they climbed an icy cliff for an adventure.

We embarked on what seemed like a dangerous journey, but in reality, we could have easily climbed the cliff with caution. Our tree house was too damaged to spend the night, so we returned to our straw hut. While sailing on Lake Placid, we gathered straw for bedding. After a bonfire mishap, we narrowly escaped a fire in the hut. Despite the hut burning down, we were grateful to be safe. Old Jim Halliday initially refused us shelter but later welcomed us into his kitchen, where his daughter made us coffee.

After enjoying a hearty breakfast of griddle cakes, we expressed our gratitude to our hosts before heading back to Willow Clump Island. Once there, we packed up our belongings and set off for home in Lamington. Our trip to the island during winter made us appreciate the challenges faced by Arctic explorers. With temperatures at only 10 degrees above zero, we pondered how they endured much colder conditions of 40, 50, or even 60 degrees below zero. This led us to explore how they coped, and we discovered the concept of a sleeping bag in Mr. Van Syckel's library. We decided to make our own using an old quilt, a blanket, and a piece of rubber sheeting. This makeshift sleeping bag provided warmth and protection from the elements, allowing us to plan future adventures in comfort.|"[""1.

Bill devised a way to keep the flap of the sleeping bag away from the face for fresh air, using two headboards connected by a thin board. The sides of the bag were nailed to this frame. Cleats on the end flap fit into notches on the headboards to secure it. This setup allowed air to flow while preventing the flap from flying open in strong wind. During rain, the head was positioned facing the wind to avoid water entering through the air space. We encountered a unique shelter with a balloon silk tent supported by a rope between trees. They had a canvas chair made by hanging canvas over posts and a bed with canvas on poles. To shield from rain, a poncho was placed over a rope tied to posts at the bed ends, with umbrellas and cloths to block raindrops.|['1.

That night, I slept in the mummy case while Dutchy was in his sleeping bag. Suddenly, a loud, eerie yell woke me up, sending shivers down my spine. Dutchy was in a panic, dreaming of a terrifying railway accident. He couldn't make a sound until he screamed, startling everyone in the camp. To ease his fear, we moved his bed to a safer spot. The next day, our friends left, but we learned a valuable lesson from their packing techniques. We made harnesses from canvas and leather straps, inspired by their compact bundles. Upon returning to school, Bill excitedly shared his idea for a tricycle sailboat, born out of our shared love for sailing. His creativity and resourcefulness amazed us all.|"[""1.

Bill had a creative idea for a boat - a tricycle sailboat on bicycle wheels! He had already started building the frame with 2-inch thick and 4-inch wide sticks. The backbone was 10 feet long, with a 5-foot crosspiece securely nailed to it. Instead of wooden braces, we opted for wire bracing to make the frame lighter. We used iron wire, screw eyes, and eye bolts to tighten the wire. By drilling holes at an angle, we could draw the wire taut by tightening the nuts on the eye bolts. We stepped the mast using an old 15-foot flagstaff, securing it with wires to keep it in place. The boat was taking shape, and Bill's innovative design was coming to life.|"['1.

We were all set to attach the frame to the bicycle wheels. Using only the front wheels of the bicycles with their forks, we secured them by driving the shanks at the top of the forks into holes in the crosspiece near the ends. For the steering wheel, Bill utilized the front fork and wheel of his new bicycle, fitting the shank into a hole at the stern end of the backbone. As for the tiller, we repurposed a piece of an old rake handle, drilling a small hole in it and splitting the end to tightly secure the projecting shank of the fork. The sail, a triangular canvas, was meticulously hand-sewn together with lapped edges for reinforcement. The sail was then attached to a boom, which was connected to the mast by a screw hook and secured with a halyard. Our land yacht, though successful in flat terrains, faced challenges when sailing against the wind due to narrow roads hindering tacking maneuvers.|['1.

Bill's Aunt Dorothy invited him to spend Easter with her and bring his roommate. I eagerly accepted. Bill had once spent a summer at her home, and we explored the woods and hills. He showed me a secret cave known to only a few. We climbed a boulder to enter, finding a chamber with a pool fed by a spring. Bill had set up chairs and a table, even a hammock made of barrel staves. He crafted an armchair from a sawed-off barrel, upholstered with ticking and denim. The chair had a hidden chest for storage. Aunt Dorothy added a ruffle for decoration. The cave became our hideaway, a place for their subterranean club.|['1.

Bill told me that he and his two pals used to spend hot summer afternoons in a cool place crafting various ornaments and making furniture for the cave. They had a homemade amusement device that caught my eye - a summer toboggan made of large barrel staves connected with two short boards. Bill demonstrated how it worked by coasting down a grassy slope. Later, we came across Professor Keeler flying a kite without a tail, which surprised me. The professor explained that it was a Malay type kite designed to balance itself with cloth pockets on each side of the backbone. Intrigued, we learned how to make kites from 5 to 8 feet long, noting down the instructions for future use. The professor shared details on the stick sizes needed for each kite length and how to assemble them securely using cleats and brass ferrules.|"['1.

"The frame of the kite was covered with a cloth known as ""percaline."" The cloth was neatly stitched over sturdy picture wire along each edge, with the wire twisted around small brass rings at the corners. These rings were hung on hooks on the frame, and a wire was fastened to the rear hooks, creating a bowstring when drawn taut. Professor Keeler instructed us to adjust the tension until the distance between the wire and the cross stick at the center equaled one-tenth of the stick's length. For our 5-foot sticks, we bowed the cross stick out by 6 inches. The kite's belly band was attached to the backbone with a wire hook, and a brass ring was secured 30 inches from the upper end to tie the main kite string. The kite could be easily disassembled and folded for storage."|['1. What material was used to cover the frame of the kite?\nA) Brass\nB) Wire\nC) Picture wire\nD) Percaline\nE) Hooks', '2.

"""Hey there, calm down,"" he responded. ""That book is fine. I'm researching new ideas for our upcoming trip to Willow Clump Island. There are plenty of useful things in that book that we can create."" He then shared his plans, drawing out unique designs for water wheels and pumps. Our initial task upon reaching the island was to set up a water wheel, or ""noria,"" as described in the book, near the camp. Constantly refilling our filter barrel had become a hassle. Bill suggested eliminating this by letting the river do the work for us. We started by measuring the height of the upper filter barrel above the river level using a surveying tool. Bill calculated that we needed a 15-foot diameter wheel to raise the water to the required height. We began by constructing towers to support the wheel. One tower stood at 16 feet, resembling a tall, narrow saw-horse, while the other was 10 feet high and three-legged."|['1.

We were all set to construct the water wheel. We got four 1/2-inch boards from Lumberville, each 3 inches wide and 15 feet long, along with a 2-foot-long bar of iron that was 3/4 of an inch in diameter. First, we nailed a 4-inch long, 4-inch diameter wooden block to the center of one board to serve as the hub. A 3/4-inch hole was drilled through this hub and the board. Similar holes were drilled in the other boards at their centers. Then, the boards were strung onto the iron bar like spokes, spaced evenly. Eight large tomato cans were attached to the spokes at the ends on the inner side. We cut sixteen paddles, half 12 inches long and half 18 inches, and secured them to the wheel. Next, we nailed a receiving trough on the higher tower and set up the wheel between the towers. To ensure a good water current, we built a trough line 35 feet long, connecting the towers with V-shaped trough sections.|['1.

After successfully anchoring the wheel near the towers, we used long ropes to raise the wheel upright. Two boys held the ropes steady while the wheel was rolled between the towers. Once in place, the axle rod was secured to prevent it from sliding out. With the anchor rope released, the wheel started working, lifting water into a trough that led to a filter barrel. Despite some leaks, the barrel quickly filled up. We redirected the excess water to a wash barrel for cleaning dishes and back to the river. The filter barrel was kept cool by evaporation, making the water inside refreshing. Additionally, we used a homemade canvas bucket to cool drinking water by hanging it in the wind for evaporation. This innovation impressed a visitor, Jim Halliday, who marveled at our camp's resourcefulness.|"['1.

We believed he was joking at first, but when he assured us he was serious, Bill mentioned that we required our own water wheel. However, we offered to construct a better wheel for him at a price he deemed fair. The agreed amount was six dollars, with Mr. Halliday covering the material costs. Although it may not have been a large sum, it felt substantial to us, especially given the scarcity of money in that area. We built Mr. Halliday's water wheel similarly to ours, using broader paddles and small dinner pails instead of cans. The pails were attached securely to the wheel spokes with a stick and screw eye setup shown in Fig. 263. This new design prevented any water spillage, allowing a greater volume of water to flow smoothly into the receiving trough. The water was then directed into a large barrel and piped to Mr. Halliday's barn, with a stopcock for control. Following the completion of Mr. Halliday's water wheel, we embarked on constructing our log cabin. Inspired by a photograph Uncle Ed had sent, we chose a spot on the southern shore of Kite Island for the cabin's location. To begin, we marked out the house's dimensions, 12 feet long by 10 feet wide, and placed large rocks at the corners for support. The logs were sourced from Mr. Schreiner's wooded land, where we carefully selected straight logs and cut them to the required lengths. The logs were then transported down|['1.

To construct the raft, ropes were woven over and under the logs at each end, with about fifteen logs tied together. As an extra safety measure, logs were placed across each end and securely fastened. Once the timber was gathered, a break was taken to enjoy a ride down the river on the logs. Two individuals were assigned to steer using poles. A challenging spot in the river was a shallow, swift section with rocks forming a natural dam. As they approached, the river deepened, making it difficult to steer with the poles. Helplessly drifting, they were swept towards the opening in the dam where they collided with a boulder. After the impact, the crew found themselves in different situations, with varying versions of the event. Eventually, they managed to regroup the logs and successfully navigate down to Lake Placid, ensuring safety by equipping the raft with oars before continuing their journey to Kite Island.|"['1.

Our third journey gathered enough logs for the log cabin. Two big 12-foot logs were selected for the foundation logs at the front and back of the structure. The logs were flattened at the bottom for a stronger grip on the ground and corners where they sat on foundation stones. Each log was notched about a foot from the ends, with notches 8 inches long and 2 inches deep. The notches were aligned so that when two logs met, they locked into each other creating a secure joint. As the cabin walls grew, we faced challenges due to varying log diameters, causing uneven growth. To address this, we rearranged the logs ensuring uniformity. We planned for a large fireplace, cutting an opening in the rear wall only after reaching the desired height to prevent buckling. Logs were lifted using skids as the walls rose, with sections cut out for the door and windows.|['1.

We began by constructing the roof of the cabin. Initially, a 16-foot log was notched and placed at each side, with one end extending about 3 feet beyond the front to create a shelter. Subsequently, two 12-foot logs were positioned, followed by two 16-foot logs set 20 inches inwards from the sides. After installing cross logs, another pair of 16-foot logs were placed 40 inches from the sides. Lastly, a single 16-foot log was positioned at the center as the ridge beam. Each roof log was carefully checked for stability to prevent collapse, especially during heavy snow in winter. A chalk line was drawn from the ridge beam to the lower roof beam for alignment, and the cross logs were cut accordingly. Rafters were then laid across the roof beams to support the eaves, with slabs forming the roofing. Finally, door and window openings were framed, with the fireplace construction initiated using flat stones gathered from the nearby river.|['1.

"The team was excited to find the perfect red shale for their project on Kite Island. The wet shale made a sticky mortar, ideal for building a chimney. With foundations dug 2 feet deep, they carefully laid stones in mud to ensure a sturdy structure. To prevent stones from teetering, they wedged small stones underneath. They meticulously ""broke joints"" to create a strong wall, adding a timber support covered in mud and tin. The chimney walls were built up a foot above the roof's ridge, and the hearth was paved with stones. Logs served as floor beams, and slabs were used for the floor, though they faced challenges in making it even. A door was constructed with a latch and guard for security, ensuring a safe and cozy cabin."|"[""1.

We built wooden sashes for our windows that fit perfectly into the openings. Nails held the sashes in place and acted as hinge pins. To keep out the cold, we covered the sashes first with cloth and later with oiled paper. For sleeping, we made bunks by laying a large log on the floor with stakes across it. Additional berths were created by setting a stout post and adding another log. We sealed the cabin by filling in the gaps between the logs with wood strips, bark, and mud. To solve the water problem, we decided to build a windmill to pump water from a well near the hut. After digging the well and shoring up the sides with planks, we laid a stone wall for durability.|['1.

The top of the well was covered with wooden planks while we built the windmill above it. We used four long sticks for the windmill tower, each about 16 feet long and 4 to 6 inches in diameter. Two frames were created using slabs to keep them apart, then firmly planted in the ground. Diagonal braces were added to complete the tower. A heavy iron rod was used as the shaft, bent into a U-shape at the center to form a crank. The wind wheel was constructed by nailing three boards together and adding wedges and blades. The wheel was attached to the shaft, facing north to catch the strongest winds. Wires were used for extra support against the wind. No vane was needed since the wind mostly blew up or down the river.|['1.

When we placed the wheel in the brisk northerly wind, it quickly began to turn before we could secure it. To stop it, we attached a stick to the tower, blocking the blades' path. This makeshift brake could be easily engaged to halt the wheel's rotation. Our pump was crafted from a galvanized leader pipe, extended with a wooden box pipe. The pump's mechanism relied on a piston inside the pipe, creating a vacuum to draw water up from a well. Despite its simplicity, the pump effectively fulfilled our needs. Eventually, we sold our old windmill to a nearby farmer, where it continued to serve faithfully. To transport materials for a new project, we constructed a sturdy wooden car with careful attention to detail, ensuring its durability for carrying heavy loads.|"[""1.

"We crafted the wheels for our car by cutting out four 12-inch diameter disks from a 3/4-inch thick hardwood board and four 9-inch disks from a 1-inch thick board. After drilling a half-inch hole in the center of each disk, we stacked a smaller disk on top of a larger one, nailing them together to form the wheels. To create the axles, we used four 6-inch long 1/2-inch bolts with washers and nuts. Face blocks were nailed on each side of the car to support the wheels, with holes drilled through them for the bolts to fit in. The wheels were mounted on the bolts with washers and nuts, ensuring they turned freely. A second nut, known as a ""jam nut,"" was added to secure the first nut in place. Finally, we added boards across the car to serve as seats. The railway trestle was constructed next, starting with a sturdy platform supported by corner posts and diagonal braces. The trestle, made of 2 x 4-inch scantlings, ran down to the ground at a gentle slope and was supported by posts with diagonal bracing. The rails were set at the right distance apart to keep the wheels on track, and the ends were cut at angles and securely fastened together with boards."|"['1.

"To ensure all ends were cut at the same angle, we crafted a carpenter's ""miter box."" This box had two sideboards nailed to a baseboard, creating a trough where the wood could be placed. We then sawed through the trough's sides at a 45-degree angle. To extend the track to the river economically, we used 2-inch planks cut into 2-inch strips as rails, fastening them with nailed slabs. Short posts were driven into the ground to anchor the track, and the rails were secured with ties. We maintained the proper gauge by rolling the car over each pair of rails, anchoring them with posts. The track was extended across a pontoon bridge and around Kite Island. Despite a mishap where Dutchy's car derailed, we reinforced the wheels with batten to prevent future issues. Ultimately, the railway proved successful, carrying us safely around the island."|"['1.

Our society accomplished the construction of a cantilever bridge, considered our greatest achievement. Uncle Ed designed it, but we deserve credit for the skillful erection. We researched bridge types before opting for the cantilever design. Despite lacking knowledge of stresses, we realized designing it was beyond us. Seeking Uncle Ed's help, we provided details like water width, depth, bank distance, and heights. The bridge spanned the lagoon mouth, 60 feet across with banks 13-1/2 feet high. Uncle Ed's detailed instructions aided us in using wooden frames, carefully hooked together for safety. Bolts secured the sapling frames, each marked for precise assembly. The design included braced and unbraced frames, crucial for compression and tension support. Uncle Ed's caution emphasized following instructions meticulously for a safe structure.|"['1.

Before constructing the bridge, we first assembled all the frames. We started by building the towers. Two frames, labeled as _A_, were placed upright and spaced 4 feet apart at the top and 5 feet apart at the bottom. Short spars were used to connect them, notched in place. Diagonal braces were nailed to connect the frames. The towers were built on opposite banks near the lagoon and then lowered into the water. The frames were bound together with soft iron wire. The frames _B_, _C_, _E_, and _F_ were securely fastened. The bridge was anchored to the shore using wires. The center panels were then installed. The bridge was completed by wedging frame _K_ under the _D_ frames. Tracks were supposed to be laid, but an interruption occurred when Mr. Gill and three others arrived on the island unexpectedly.|['1.
