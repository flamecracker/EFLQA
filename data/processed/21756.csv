The clouds thickened as the captain's cough echoed through the room, a mix of choke, gasp, rend, and roar. Suddenly, a fairy-like girl emerged from the marine-stores. With brown hair, blue eyes, and a sweet face, she perched on a chair to soothe the captain's cough with a playful gesture. As the captain settled, a nautical man entered.

A trading ship, not a passenger one, had Captain Samson towering over the deck with a fairy-like girl beside him. Benjamin Trench waved frantically from the pier, while the bailie, his wife, and little Susan bid farewell. Among the sailors, Philosopher Jack, feeling lonely, had hidden his sea plans from family. As the ship sailed, a stowaway, a ruddy boy, hid below deck. Ignorant Baldwin Burr benefited from Jack's teachings, and Polly Samson enjoyed enlightening him. The seaman shared ghostly encounters, sparking debates with Polly. Despite differing views, they found companionship on the vast sea, where the ship vanished beyond the horizon, carrying their hopes and fears.|"['1.

"""It was very much like an ordinary man of small size,"" said the sailor, ""but it was too dark to see its face. I know every person on the ship, and I can swear that the ghost is not part of the crew or a passenger."" The sailor tried to grab the ghost, but it dodged around swiftly and disappeared down the fore-scuttle. The conversation was interrupted by Edwin Jack, who took over the wheel. Edwin had transformed into a sailor in just a few days at sea, with blisters and scars on his hands. Jack went to the port bulwarks, lost in thought. Approaching a man near the long-boat, Jack remarked on the fine night, but the man remained silent. The man revealed himself as Watty Wilkins, a stowaway. Captain Samson reprimanded Watty, assigning him to hard ship duties. Despite the tough work, Watty faced it cheerfully, determined to make the best of his situation."|"['1.

Wilkins realized the futility of rebellion and swallowed his pride as he approached the captain's cabin. Unbeknownst to him, the captain, unaware of recent events, sent for the stowaway Watty. Despite pleas for leniency from Ben Trench, the captain believed Watty had acted ungratefully. The captain revealed that Watty's father had arranged a job for him on a steamship. However, Watty's escape had led to consequences. As the ship journeyed south, Philosopher Jack befriended Ben and Watty, while instructing Baldwin Burr. The ship sailed smoothly until a fierce storm hit. The crew battled the elements, reducing sails and facing the wrath of the sea. Amidst chaos, lightning struck, and the ship faced destruction. The crew worked desperately to secure the vessel, but the night was filled with fear and awe as nature unleashed its power.|"[""1.

Captain Samson ordered the crew to abandon the ship, leaving the passengers on the raft. As they pushed off, the _Lively Poll_ sank. Despite the tragedy, the castaways found some cheer in the sunshine and calm weather. Polly, with a romantic view, even found the rafting experience somewhat enjoyable. While constructing a shelter on the raft, she shared her thoughts with her father. The men's laughter interrupted their conversation when a passenger, Mr. Luke, slipped into a hole between the spars. Despite his mishap, Mr. Luke remained composed and joined the crew for dinner. As the crew discussed the safety of the raft in a storm, Baldwin assured them that they could weather a half-gale but joked about the risk of being eaten by sharks in a severe storm.|"[""1.

Corkey pointed to a shark following their ship, showing its fin. Polly saw the shark come close, grabbing pork. Wilkins and Jack readied the shark-hook as Ben Trench, keen on nature, joined. The shark circled the bait, then swam off. Despite not catching it, spirits lifted. As evening neared, the weather changed. The sea turned grey, clouds gathered, and waves grew rough. Polly, recalling her father's advice, prayed. She trusted Jesus, finding comfort in prayer. Captain Samson spoke to Polly about money, preparing her for a potential separation. He advised her to seek Bailie Trench in case of need. Polly, with her simple faith, found peace in prayer, contrasting with the anxious crew facing the storm.|"['1.

Captain Samson, a wise and caring man, shared his plan with his daughter, Polly, to safeguard their savings in case of danger. He entrusted his friends with ensuring Polly's well-being should he not survive. As a storm approached, the crew braced themselves on the raft. Despite the fierce winds and crashing waves, they secured the raft, enduring the night with courage. The following day brought little relief, and repairs became challenging in the dark. Suddenly, a loud crack split the air, causing panic. A section of the raft broke free, holding two passengers and a crew member. Frantically, they tried to secure the detached part. The crew's bravery shone through in the face of adversity.|['1.

Strong and capable hands were prepared to act, but before they could grasp it, the rope broke, and Jack was forcefully pulled into the sea. He resurfaced quickly. Little Wilkins lay down, extending a helping hand. Jack grabbed it, nearly pulling the little boy into the water if Ben Trench hadn't intervened. Baldwin Burr caught Ben, and the captain, arriving just in time, provided his strong assistance. Jack was rescued, but the broken part of the raft, along with its unfortunate occupants, drifted away and vanished from sight. This unfortunate incident naturally had a very disheartening impact on everyone. Although the broken part of the raft was large enough to support those on it, and some provisions went with them, offering hope of being rescued by a passing ship, the chances were slim. Over six days and nights, the raft was tossed on the open sea, struggling to sail with a makeshift mast and canvas. Steering was nearly impossible, and the crew's constant exposure began to affect their health. Despite the challenges, Polly, a girl on the raft, remained resilient and caring towards her fellow crew members.|"['1.

The shipwrecked crew's joy was overwhelming, a stark contrast to their previous despair. They embraced, laughed, and some even shed tears while thanking God aloud. Ben, remaining seated, envisioned jolly times akin to Robinson Crusoe, longing for his sister's presence. Eager to reach the island, they faced challenges with the heavy raft and light wind. The captain steered towards a narrow opening between the reef and the calm lagoon. As they approached, the raft grappled with towering waves, eventually propelled into the opening. Amidst chaos, some men were thrown overboard, and the raft shattered. Quick actions saved lives as Jack leaped into the sea with Polly, while Wilkins rescued Ben. Eventually, all safely stood on the coral reef's white sands, relieved and unharmed.|"[""1.

The small island where the raft landed was lush with vegetation, including inviting groves of coconut palms waving gracefully in the breeze. The castaways faced the challenge of crossing the lagoon to find shelter. Despite the excitement, the presence of sharks was forgotten. Some crew members couldn't swim, but everyone managed to reach floating debris and push it towards the reef. As they neared the reef, fear set in. O'Rook's imagination got the best of him, but with humor and determination, they all made it safely to the island. While building a shelter, Jack explained to Polly about coral insects, tiny builders that create reefs and islands by secreting lime to form their homes underwater.|"['1.

The philosopher explained how corallines work underwater, expanding reefs and islands. Waves break coral masses, adding to the height of the reef. Sea-birds rest there, seeds and plants grow, thickening the soil over time. Jack and Baldwin built a bower with Polly's help. Watty made a hut for Ben. O'Rook and Luke explored the islet. O'Rook shared his past, but Luke remained silent. They found a boat with a skeleton, a tragic sight. The man seemed cast away, too weak to survive. The group was concerned for Ben, who was with O'Rook. The captain reflected on men and women's roles. The explorers continued their search on the islet.|"['1.

Jack sadly mentioned that there was nothing more to be found. The man's strength must have failed him suddenly, leaving his wishes unfulfilled as he had not signed his name or provided his wife's address. Jack managed to decipher the name David Ban--, with the latter part of the surname illegible. He also found a lock of golden hair, likely belonging to a young person, which O'Rook identified as Lucy's hair. O'Rook claimed both the hair and the book, stating they belonged to him as he found them. A week later, Captain Samson, Polly, Jack, and Wilkins explored the island, while the crew of the _Lively Poll_ built huts and gathered provisions. The narrative then delves into the ocean currents, explaining the Gulf Stream and its impact on the movement of objects like Wilkins's bottle.

Mr Black was reading the shipping news when a message caught his attention. As he read, his hands clenched the newspaper tightly, his eyes widened, and his face turned pale. He hurried to his neighbor, Mr Walter Wilkins, seeking help due to a disaster involving the ship _Lively Poll_. Mr Wilkins, unaware of the news, was shocked to learn his son might have been on the ship. Meanwhile, Mr Black, aware of trouble at the Blankow Bank, advised Mrs Niven to sell her shares, omitting his plan to buy them himself. Mrs Niven, appreciative but cautious, agreed to the proposal and sent a letter.

Philosopher Jack readily accepted the professorship and promptly delivered his inaugural speech, blending serious and humorous philosophies about the past, present, and future. His words delighted his favorite student, Baldwin Burr. Jack proposed appointing a professor skilled in storytelling for entertainment and enlightenment. The motion was supported by Bounce and cheered by the audience. Simon O'Rook was chosen for his storytelling prowess. Jack, a philosopher with knowledge in various subjects, entertained his comrades with historical tales around the campfire. The crew, shipwrecked on an isolated island, found solace in Jack's stories despite their underlying worry about being far from common shipping routes. Watty Wilkins, an avid fisherman, built a boat with the help of Jack and Ben from the remains of their old boat.

Using his jacket as a signal, he sat helpless, lost in thought under the moonlit sky. Memories of home, his father, and friends flooded his mind. Conscience pricked him, admitting his wrongs. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he wept. Alone, without food or water, he prayed for help. Remembering a Bible verse, he prayed earnestly for deliverance.

In the afternoon, hope rose as clouds hinted at rain. Eventually, a gentle shower came, too light to collect. The drops on a baling-dish vanished, teasing him. Undeterred, Watty used his jacket as a basin, but it absorbed the drops. Turning to his greasy canvas trousers, he found success. Creating a makeshift basin, he collected water.

The captain agreed to the plan. Jacob and Watty joined immediately after Daniel's funeral, starting their journey through the mountains. The group, including Polly, escorted them to Redman's Gap, where they bid farewell. As the trio ventured deeper into the mountains, the initial excitement waned. They hunted for food and searched for gold, but the quantity found was not enough. Gradually, they grew accustomed to the rugged life, becoming less appreciative. Watty, however, maintained his positivity, influenced by his faith. Philosopher Jack struggled with his promise to Daniel and the urge to confront Jacob about his drinking. After much deliberation, he mustered the courage to speak, despite Jacob's initial resistance. Jack realized the futility of forcibly changing someone. Meanwhile, Watty, inspired by the dawn, found solace in his routine of reading and prayer since his rescue at sea.|"[""1.

"""Great job!"" exclaimed Jack, standing up and placing the kettle on the fire for breakfast. ""Watty and I will explore that valley for gold. Make sure you don't eat more than your share of food while we're gone and have supper ready for us when we return.""

After a simple breakfast and some hot tea, the friends armed themselves and headed up the narrow mountain valley near their camp. They crossed a wooded area, a small plain, and a dense thicket, following a dry stream bed littered with boulders. Despite finding some gold dust along the way, they were hungry and quiet.

As they searched, Watty uncovered a nugget the size of a thimble and a larger mass of solid gold. Excited but cautious, he suspected there might be more. Meanwhile, Jack also found gold specks in abundance. Both friends, overwhelmed with joy, decided to play down their discoveries to their lazy companion back at camp."|"['1.

As the sun began to set, Jack and Watty found themselves at the mouth of the gorge. Jack paused to carve a unique stick he had spotted earlier, a memento of their discovery. Meanwhile, Watty strolled across the plain. Suddenly, two shots rang out, followed by a cry from Jack. Alarmed, Watty readied his gun and ran back. A massive grizzly bear emerged from the thicket, chasing Jack. Watty acted swiftly, taking aim from a tree and firing at the charging bear, saving his friend. Buckley, hearing the commotion, arrived and swiftly dealt with the bear. The friends, safe but shaken, looked down at the defeated foe below.

Wilkins, with a sad face, mentioned his sprained ankle as his friends prepared to leave. Watty, in pain, needed Jacob's help to return to camp. Despite his injury, Wilkins was happy about their gold discovery. Watty, unable to walk, stayed in camp while Jack and Buckley collected more gold. They decided to bring their friends to the new site. Watty was carried back on a makeshift stretcher.

The captain scolded the young Philosopher for abandoning his friend. He shared that he sent the friend a large sum of money and believed there was more in gold and nuggets for him. The group had all prospered and stayed healthy. Ben Trench, although not as strong as the others, was doing well thanks to their nurse. They discussed the friend who had left and another who went prospecting. They shared their newfound success and decided to invest the money.

Edwin Jack regularly sent money to his father to help him with farming, but his father's fortunes changed for the better. The cottage in Scotland improved, showing signs of prosperity. The rooms were better furnished, with a new piano and educational materials for the children. The family was grateful for Edwin's safety, and the money he sent was saved for him. Mr. Jack invested the money wisely with Mr. Wilkins. The family no longer needed the money Edwin sent, as they were now doing well. Despite Edwin's generosity, his family was thriving on their own.

After the chaotic entry, a calm settled when Mr. Jack opened the family Bible for worship. During breakfast, the noise resumed but was quieter due to strong appetites. Dobbin quickly got immersed in a treacle-piece. Mr. Jack mentioned investing two thousand pounds with Mr. Wilkins, but news of the Blankow Bank's failure changed plans.

Mr. Jack believed that seeking advice from a clever and impartial businessman, who also happened to be related to Mrs. Niven, could be beneficial during this critical time. After a lengthy conversation with Mrs. Niven, Mr. Jack left and arrived at the shabby office. Leaving Mr. Black in astonishment and his clerk stifling laughter, Mr. Jack's visit worsened Mr. Black's already gloomy mood due to his self-inflicted misfortunes and Mrs. Niven's involvement. The subsequent discussion with Mr. Wilkins about investing in another Scotch bank was futile. The bank's misfortune was attributed to internal theft, tarnishing the reputation of the bank directors rather than all Scottish banks. The aftermath of the bank's collapse brought widespread suffering, affecting both the innocent and the guilty, rich and poor. Despite the hardships endured, some found solace in the purification that adversity brought. The California gold-hunters, unaware of these events, continued their pursuits, oblivious to the turmoil elsewhere.
