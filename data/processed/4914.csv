Cora and her friends were excited after their visit to the garage to learn more about Cora's new car, the Whirlwind, different from Jack's runabout. They wanted to surprise the boys with their knowledge the next day. They met Paul, a knowledgeable young man at the garage, who shared valuable information about cars.

Despite leaving just before Jack's arrival, they managed to get home in time. Cora demonstrated her new car skills to her friends and they set off for a ride, smoothly navigating the roads, with Cora handling the car expertly.

Elizabeth hid her face and shrank in her seat as her sister leaned against her. The train below made puffing sounds. The engineer saw the car speeding towards danger, blowing loud whistles. Cora, in panic, pulled the brake lever desperately. Despite her fear, she felt oddly calm, as if watching a distant picture. She pressed the brake pedal hard. Trying to pull the lever further, it wouldn't budge. The engineer signaled frantically, motioning the car back. To the left was a stone wall, to the right a fenced field with a brook separating them. The car veered into the brook, slowing down, stopping at a pond. Cora noticed a young man with a fishing pole on the opposite bank but was too relieved the car had stopped in Campbell's Pond to pay him much attention.|"['1.

"""Can I assist you?"" he inquired, grinning widely despite the mud and water splattered all over him. A small clump of mud rested on the tip of his nose. He appeared to find his own situation as amusing as that of the motor girls. ""Do you require aid?"" he continued. ""I'm willing to help,"" stammered Cora, unsure of the car's condition. ""We might have been impolite splashing water and mud on you,"" she apologized. ""Not a problem at all,"" he reassured. ""You handled the situation bravely. I was worried when I saw you speeding towards the train, but your turn was impressive. What caused you to lose control?"" The young man hopped in, the mud on his nose still intact, and Cora fought the urge to giggle. He took the wheel, shifted gears, and expertly guided the Whirlwind out of the pond, bringing it to a stop in a grassy meadow. Mr. Foster admitted his lack of social connections in Chelton due to his focus on sports. Walter teased Cora for not giving him a heads-up about the adventure, and Ed recounted the motor girls' predicament, impressing Jack and Walter with Cora's quick thinking.

Walter took Ed's place at the steering wheel of the Whirlwind, and the fisherman sat beside Jack. Walter drove Cora's car out of the meadow and onto the road, leaving the three girls in the vehicle. Ed mentioned he was busy but planned to visit them soon. He shared that he was going into finance and making investments with cash and securities inherited from his banker father. Ed also discussed how Sid Wilcox was not invited to invest due to concerns about his reliability. As they approached Fisher's store, Jack's runabout, the Get There, joined them. The store was known for having a variety of items, especially soda water in push-in-the-cork bottles. Cora noticed that the girl with Sid didn't acknowledge their presence, prompting a discussion among the girls.|"['1.

Sidney Wilcox had a peculiar demeanor that made everyone in the group uneasy, especially the girls who also noticed similar behavior in Ida. Jack and Ed were less critical. Walter seemed indifferent to Ida, but she may not have felt the same. Despite this, she avoided looking at him when Cora and her friends were around. Elizabeth agreed, following her sister and Cora into the store. Walter and Jack followed, while Ed lingered outside with Ida and Sid. Sid, known for not introducing his male friends to his female companion, didn't introduce Ed to Ida. Ida, sensing this, distanced herself. Ed later expressed interest in getting to know the group better, feeling out of touch. Jack explained that Ida was the daughter of the Reverend Mrs. Giles, known for her strictness.|"[""1.

Cora, along with her friends, the Robinson twins and another girl named Mary Downs, were getting ready to go for a drive that Jack had mentioned earlier. Mary, a millinery model, was excited for her first ride in Cora's new car. As Cora started the car, the engine roared to life, and the girls held onto their hats as they sped off.

Ida and Sid found themselves in a dangerous situation as they careened towards a collision with a big car.

Jack and Cora discussed the lost wallet dilemma on their way to New City. Jack suggested searching the road to Chelton, while Cora proposed driving slowly to spot the wallet. They wished they had more friends along to help search. Jack hesitated to involve Lem Gildy, fearing he might take the money. Despite Cora's suggestion, Jack was unsure about asking Lem for help.

Cora and Walter's search for the lost wallet was just as fruitless as Jack and Lem's. Despite scouring the road to New City, they returned empty-handed in the car. Eager to get home, Cora was anxious to hear about Jack's unsuccessful search. The town of Chelton buzzed with speculation about the missing twenty thousand dollars. Two days later, Cora, accompanied by her friends the Robinson twins and Walter, set out for a ride on the smooth turnpike. During the journey, a startling discovery was made when a brown leather wallet, believed to contain the missing money, was found by Jack. The group returned to Chelton in silence, pondering the mystery of the empty wallet and the unanswered question of who took the money.|"['1.

"Ed exclaimed, ""How absurd! It would be easy for the thief to toss the empty wallet into your tool-box as the car passed by. The box isn't locked, right?"" That evening, Jack, Cora, and three college friends visited the post office. Cora glanced at the millinery shop window where Mary Downs worked and saw a sign: ""Apprentice Wanted."" Rumors spread about the found empty wallet. Ed informed the police and reporters. Detectives searched for clues, enticed by a $500 reward. Suspicion fell on Cora and the Robinson girls. Sid and Ida faced police questioning. No one was officially charged, but Ed's money remained missing. Two weeks later, Cora's odd bank encounter hinted at a new development.

Sid might have felt embarrassed to invite Mary for a drive. He's known to be wealthy, while Mary, a kind girl, works for a living. Unfortunately, Sid may not hold a high opinion of working girls. They arrived at a shop with an impressive glass front, the only one of its kind in Chelton. Inside, there was a single hat on display, described as a creation by the exclusive Madam Julia. The door-boy, smartly dressed in a tight blue suit with brass buttons, graciously welcomed the young ladies. Madam Julia, known for her French flair, left instructions for her staff on hat designs. She expressed frustration at a girl leaving abruptly due to a family emergency. Louise, who replaced Mary, quickly found the motor cap requested by Cora.

Cora looked stunning in the hood, which Bess and Belle approved of. It was an elegant Shaker style made of delicate silk, complementing Cora's black, wavy hair. Pleased with the hood, Cora then received a specially designed mask. Practical and simple, it consisted of veiling with goggles, secured to the hood with an elastic string. Louise took the hood and mask for adjustments behind the curtains. The milliner explained the changes to be made. The madam always chose hoods and cloaks to match the girls' complexions. Bess would have a brown one, while Belle needed a dark blue. Suddenly, Ida Giles appeared, surprising Cora, Belle, and Bess.
