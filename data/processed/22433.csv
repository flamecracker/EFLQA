I never had a chance to talk to him, but I could create one. He ignored me and seemed unaware of my presence. However, he was not unkind. He provided me with clothes like the other boys and even arranged for anything I needed. I was given a row-boat when I was ten, but by fourteen, I wanted an upgrade. When I mentioned it to my uncle, he didn't respond. On my next birthday, a beautiful sail-boat was waiting for me on the lake. Even though I spent days on the lake, no one questioned me. Despite this neglect, I managed to stay on the right path. I attended the Parkville Liberal Institute at twelve and excelled academically. At Sunday school, I learned important lessons that shaped my values. Although I wasn't perfect, I strived to do what was right.

"I always had access to money. I could request any amount from my uncle without question. I mention this to his disadvantage, as I wished he showed more concern by denying me. I was bold and brave, excelling in daring feats and athletic challenges. My peers in school and Parkville deemed me ""smart."" While flattered by this, it didn't spoil me. Despite my freedom, I longed for a loving home. During favorable weather, I sailed to school. On the day I was accused of fighting, my boat, the Splash, was docked.

Mr. Parasyte was both angry and scared by the unsettling situation at Parkville Liberal Institute. Despite feeling emotional, I tried to stay composed. I gestured for calm among my classmates, urging them to act maturely. I preferred peace over conflict and was proud of my friends' loyalty. I signaled to Mr. Parasyte that he could speak. He expressed his disappointment at the disruption and assured fairness. He acknowledged my conduct and intended to give me a chance to make amends.

Mr. Parasyte had moved far from his initial stance. I didn't want to be expelled and was glad he showed leniency. I was ready to accept a minor punishment to stay in school. He praised my behavior post the quarrel. He offered to cancel the expulsion if I apologized to Poodles within a week. I was puzzled about apologizing for defending myself. I didn't want to lose the school benefits, but I couldn't apologize for something I believed was right. During the arithmetic exam, I and a few others solved all problems correctly. Poodles, surprisingly, did too, though I suspected he got help. Mr. Parasyte seemed uneasy, realizing he controlled the boys' behavior with their consent. He may have felt the need to regain authority by being just and fair.|"[""1.

Mr. Parasyte addressed me, mentioning the ongoing issue with Poodles. He suggested I clarify my stance on apologizing, hinting that a misunderstanding could be resolved through dialogue. Despite Mr. Parasyte's rebuke towards Poodles, I declined the proposed meeting. Feeling unfairly treated, I decided to leave. As I departed, Mr. Parasyte tried to stop me, but I continued towards my boat. An attempt to chase me ensued, with Mr. Parasyte and two men rowing after me. A light breeze aided my escape as I sculled the boat, outpacing my pursuers. The boys watched from the shore, supporting my evasion. Despite the pursuit, I managed to stay ahead, hoping for a stronger wind to further distance myself from the rowboat.|"['1.

As the wind picked up on the lake, I managed to keep a safe distance between my boat, the Splash, and the row-boat. My initial anger faded, replaced by a sense of enjoyment in the chase. The boys on the shore cheered me on, urging me to outmaneuver the pursuing row-boat. Mr. Parasyte, determined to catch me, saw it as a test of his authority at the Parkville Liberal Institute. I used the wind to my advantage, leading the row-boat on a playful chase. However, a miscalculation left me becalmed near the shore, giving Mr. Parasyte a chance to catch up. Despite my efforts to escape, I found myself in a perilous situation as the row-boat closed in. The rowers, driven by Mr. Parasyte's fervor, propelled the boat towards me with increasing speed.

Mr. Parasyte's row-boat crashed into the Splash, my beloved boat, causing it to sink rapidly. As I swam away, Mr. Parasyte, in a fit of anger, ordered his men to capture me. Reluctantly, I accepted their help and climbed into their boat. Despite feeling wronged and vengeful over the loss of my boat, I maintained my composure and reminded Mr. Parasyte that I followed the academy's rules until he expelled me. He seethed at the thought of being sued for the damages. As we headed towards the shore, Mr. Parasyte avoided the pier where the students awaited, opting for a secluded landing spot to prevent any interference.

Once I calmed down, I tried to figure out where my boat had sunk so I could possibly salvage it. The boat was in bad shape, with a damaged side. As we approached the shore, I planned to escape my captor, Mr. Parasyte. He seemed to catch on to my plan and held a boat-hook to prevent my escape. Despite his clever strategy, I waited for the right moment. Mr. Parasyte had me sit in a carriage while he sat beside me. I was taken back to the Institute without the other boys noticing.

In about an hour, the boys will gather for evening prayers at the Parkville Liberal Institute. The principal, Mr. Parasyte, offered a deal to the protagonist to restore their rank and privileges if they apologized publicly to him and privately to another student named Poodles. The protagonist, conflicted, pondered the situation. They felt justified in their actions and were unwilling to apologize for telling the truth. However, they recognized their defiance towards the principal was not appropriate. As the protagonist debated, Mr. Parasyte returned, anxious about the school's stability.

I must admit that, in my opinion, many school teachers, with their limited power, can sometimes become petty tyrants. Their arrogance and oppression can be unbearable. Mr. Parasyte was one of these individuals, despite being an excellent teacher. He was visibly frustrated when he realized I was determined and unwilling to back down. Storming out of the room in a fit of anger, he was clearly not in the right frame of mind for the religious activities that followed. As darkness enveloped the room, I lay on the bed, reflecting on the events of the day and contemplating the consequences of my actions. I longed for guidance from a caring friend, a father, or a loving mother. Despite feeling right about my decisions, I was left wondering why Mr. Parasyte was detaining me in the Institute after expelling me. The students, led by Bob Hale, eventually broke down the door to free me, initiating a student-led tribunal to address the situation.

Mr. Parasyte addressed the students after a prayer, painting me as a rebellious troublemaker who defied reason and common sense. He even offered to pay for my boat, hoping to soften my stubborn nature to no avail. Urging the students to uphold Parkville Liberal Institute's discipline, he mentioned consulting my uncle for guidance. The students listened silently, with Bob Hale determined to stick to their plan. Henry Vallington, a respected student, presided over the gathering, making the situation more serious. Poodles and Pearl, brought in for questioning, displayed contrasting attitudes.

Bill Poodles smiled, relieved to escape trouble easily. However, Dick Pearl, a poor free scholar, looked troubled. The boys planned to have Poodles expelled or removed by their parents. Pearl, being under Mr. Parasyte's care, faced a dilemma. If he denied helping Poodles and was caught, he'd be expelled. If he stood firm, the Institute might close. After confessing under Poodles' coercion, the boys sympathized with Pearl. Vallington commended Pearl's honesty. Mr. Parasyte, though troubled, acknowledged the situation. The boys, orderly and attentive, awaited Mr. Parasyte's response. He expressed surprise at Vallington's involvement, emphasizing his expectation of good behavior.

Vallington, a student, stood up against the principal, Mr. Parasyte, for unfair treatment of Thornton. Vallington, along with other students, demanded Thornton's reinstatement after Poodles and Pearl confessed their errors under pressure. Mr. Parasyte, known for his polished but intimidating demeanor, was challenged by the students' unity. The students, led by Vallington, peacefully left the room, showing solidarity. Despite Mr. Parasyte's attempt to speak with Vallington privately, the students' united front remained strong.

The incident in the school-room made it clear that the principal intended to force confessions from students through intimidation, and he planned to continue targeting the narrator. Despite not wanting to be a martyr, the narrator felt trapped. The principal, angered by the narrator's defiance, sought to subdue him after failing to do so through mild means. The uncle's intervention prevented expulsion but demanded submission. Refusing to sign a document admitting to false accusations, the narrator faced physical punishment from the principal. In a burst of strength and determination, the narrator fought back, surprising even themselves. As the principal blocked the exit, the narrator contemplated escape, wary of facing the demon-like expression of the tyrant. Preferring cunning over confrontation, the narrator strategized for survival against the formidable foe.|"['1.

Without responding, I tried to escape through the window to either drop to safety or hang from it. But my actions left me vulnerable to the enemy's attack, who swiftly seized the opportunity. He grabbed my collar, pulling me back into the office and throwing me to the ground while snatching the cowhide from my grip. In a surge of anger and self-defense, I grabbed a heavy round ruler as a weapon and struck back at the principal until he fell unconscious. Panting and shaken, I unlocked the door and found Mrs. Parasyte and Mr. Hardy in the hall, having heard the commotion. Together, we moved the principal to his room. Despite my fear of the consequences, the doctor's reassurance that he was not seriously hurt eased my mind. After explaining the situation to Mr. Hardy, I left the academy, regretting the conflict even though I stood up for myself against injustice.|"[""1.

As I walked home, I pondered the day's events. I concluded that I wasn't at fault for the trouble. If I seemed proud and disobedient, it was because of how I'd been treated unfairly. I didn't deserve punishment, and I couldn't bear it even if I had done wrong. My uncle advised Mr. Parasyte to control me, showing a new interest in me. I anticipated my uncle's opposition, as he sided with the principal. Approaching the cottage, I noticed a light in my uncle's study. He was always awake, looking weary and unsociable. He seemed to suffer and rejected any comfort. I wanted to know about my parents, but my uncle was unresponsive. Despite this, I wanted to confront him about the recent events.|"[""1.

With my determination strong, I tapped on the library door, expecting a confrontation. I hoped to engage my stern uncle in conversation to make an impact. Getting no response, I knocked again. The door opened, and my uncle, about to close it, hesitated. Stepping in, I explained a recent conflict at school. His look was unpleasant, indicating his dislike towards me, a feeling I couldn't fathom. I narrated my story, but his response was cold. I realized he despised me, despite his past leniency. I was troubled, unsure why he harbored such animosity. I felt a deep sadness thinking about my mother, in a mental institution, deprived of my care.

It felt odd that my uncle spent money on me without reason. Why hide details about my parents? Who was the person who argued with him at the cottage? I was old enough to think for myself. His secrecy and behavior hinted at something amiss. I decided to investigate by searching the library for clues. I needed to ensure my mother was cared for. The next morning, I considered repairing my sailboat to explore where it sank. My uncle appeared, and I pondered my actions. I couldn't apologize to Poodles unjustly. If I left school, it could harm the institute. There was a deal between Mr. Parasyte and my uncle, evident in my mistreatment. I rowed towards where the Splash sank, feeling like I was starting anew in life.|"[""1.

I was amazed and deeply moved by the realization that I was the only person in the world at that moment. Gazing up at the clear blue sky, I prayed for divine guidance to stay on the path of honesty and responsibility. I sincerely wished that if I had made a mistake, or was currently doing so, I would be made aware of it. I prayed for enlightenment. I was concerned that I had been stubborn and disobedient, but I felt justified in not apologizing regarding Poodles. Overall, I was content with myself, although I recognized that I may have gone too far in some instances. I resumed rowing towards the bluff. My route took me close to the shore until I passed the northern point of Parkville, where the steamboat dock juts out into the deep lake water. Continuing past this pier, I caught sight of the Parkville Liberal Institute. Despite it being mid-morning, I was surprised to see numerous students outside the buildings near the lake, not engaging in their usual activities but gathered in groups. It seemed as though something significant had occurred, which the students were actively discussing. I was tempted to approach the Institute to inquire about the situation, but I was concerned that my presence might cause trouble. Thus, I reluctantly proceeded towards the bluff. It appeared that the boys at the Institute were in a state of rebellion, possibly due to Mr. Parasyte's illness preventing him from attending to his duties.

As Mr. Parasyte spoke about Thornton's assault, the students fled the school in protest.

The rebellion stemmed from the unjust actions of Mr. Parasyte, leading to plans to camp on Cleaver Island. Despite reservations, the narrator joined the rebellion due to a sense of injustice. To aid the cause, the students helped raise a sunken boat, the Splash, for the camping trip. The boat was repaired by a wheelwright in town.

I found the Splash boat and was thrilled to see it raised, nearly good as new. The wheelwright confirmed it was not severely damaged. This success lifted my spirits, as I realized I could make money by boating to support myself. The plan was to transport forces to Cleaver Island.

The long painter of the scow had been extended and fastened to the three boats. With a fresh wind blowing, I took the lead, attached a rope to the painter, and the boats set off, pulling the scow along. The procession of boats moved well, but the flat-boat was heavy, needing a strong effort to get it going. The boys rowed effectively, aided by the wind pushing the Splash forward. The journey to the island was estimated at nearly two hours. The students' swift and organized actions left no time for interference as they departed. Despite the arrival of Mr. Gaule and laborers, the boys remained composed and silent.

"""I see you are all of one mind,"" continued Vallington. ""I deem it right to tell you now that, in my opinion, Mr. Parasyte is no contemptible foe to deal with. He will make a good deal of trouble, if he does not cause much anxiety, perhaps suffering, in our ranks.""

""I shall do my best to ensure the safety of the boats, or to run the blockade, if one is established,"" I replied, with becoming modesty. I was excited over the prospect, hoping for a blockade to exercise my navigation and strategy skills.

""Mr. Parasyte may collect a force to capture us. He could charge us with stealing his boats,"" said Vallington. ""We must be cautious.""

""It is far from Parkville, and Pine Island is larger than Cleaver Island, making it harder to blockade,"" I added.

""We might reach Cannondale by night if we work fast,"" I suggested, considering provisions.

""I am grateful for the honor, but we need to focus on the task at hand,"" I replied, noting the time and suggesting a plan to reach Cannondale. The general agreed, and we set off.

Navigating Lake Adieno was familiar to me, even at night. The lake's rough waters posed a challenge, but we reached Cannondale safely.

We arrived at Pine Island with supplies and swiftly sailed to Cleaver Island under the moonlight. As we neared the shore, I noticed a row-boat approaching, which I suspected belonged to Mr. Parasyte. To give them a fright, I steered our boat towards them, causing them to panic and plead for safety. Despite their scare, I navigated past them. Meanwhile, Pearl, a new member, agreed to wait for Vallington's approval to join our camp. After our return, we found the camp packed up and ready for departure to Pine Island. The arrival of the row-boat was observed by our sentinels, leading to a divided opinion on admitting the newcomers. Despite objections, the majority voted to welcome them.

"I chose Bob Hale, a boatman, to lead the Splash, advising him to use only the jib and mainsail. The row-boats trailed alongside the scow. The sail exceeded expectations, propelling the ""gundalow"" at three knots. By 2 a.m., tired students lay in tents, some likely dozing off. At dawn, we docked at a sheltered bay to unload goods. The morning chill spurred the boys to unload the scow and set up tents, finishing in a few hours. All boats were hidden in an inlet for safety. Exhausted, we all slept until noon. The serene lake and quiet shores greeted us upon waking. The boys, now energized, decided to escape and cook a meal. They efficiently prepared food over a fire, relishing the meal without utensils. The day passed peacefully, with the boys taking turns on watch duty. The next morning, the fleet of row-boats mysteriously vanished, puzzling us all."|"['1.

"""I am not discouraged by losing the boats. I will find a way to reach the main shore,"" I declared confidently, determined not to let the setback affect our plans. We decided to search the island for clues about the missing boats. Despite our efforts, we couldn't uncover any information about the lost squadron. Vallington, surprised and upset, questioned the guards, but they were unaware of the disappearance. Suspicions arose about two individuals who may have plotted against us. It was revealed that they had manipulated their guard positions to carry out their scheme unnoticed. The traitors likely used a pole found in the cove to push a boat into the lake and escape.

The group of traitors had taken the Splash, and possibly a few rowboats, to Cannondale, which was just two miles southeast of Pine Island. The prevailing northwest wind made the journey easy. To reach the main shore, a raft was built using logs and boards from an old cook-house. Despite the heavy sea, the raft sailed towards Cannondale, with the boys navigating it. The wind was strong, making it impossible to return to the island. Upon reaching Cannondale, they found the boats and a man who had helped the deserters. The man explained how he found the boats on the beach and brought them to the steamboat wharf for safety. The boys claimed possession of their boats, avoiding a quarrel with the man.|['1.

"I replied, ""Did they?"" glancing at Bob Hale, acknowledging that Mr. Parasyte had sent the deserters to do the work. ""But it's not our concern.

It was useless to argue, so I cut the rope, setting the row-boat adrift. The boat struggled in the rough waters. I circled back, tossed a bucket to Pearl, and helped him bail out the water. Despite the situation, Pearl remained calm. We rescued Mr. Parasyte, who seemed ungrateful. As we sailed back, Mr. Parasyte unexpectedly accused us, misinterpreting a smile. Though we saved his life, he showed no gratitude. Bob and I were disappointed. We decided to search for the flat-boat, planning to return to our group later. The company gathered, surprised by the events. A council was held to discuss our next steps, but we left the decision to our leader, who promised to act wisely based on circumstances.|['1.

Our group vowed to follow these instructions precisely and be prepared for any orders given. The boat docked at the simple pier and tied to a tree. We observed closely the actions of the people who disembarked from the boat. Following Mr. Parasyte's unkind behavior, it became clear that the rebellion was more serious than we thought. We, along with Bob Hale, decided that reconciliation with him was impossible. The situation had escalated, and what began as a prank seemed to be turning into a serious matter. While the boys initially talked seriously about their rights and taking a stand, they didn't grasp the gravity of their actions. I won't justify everything the boys did, but I believe the school principal was unfit to guide and discipline young men. He was unjust, a hidden tyrant, close-minded, and not a good example of a teacher. If the boys were wrong, he was even more so, given his influence and position. The situation was becoming more serious as Mr. Parasyte arrived with men to accomplish something unknown to us. We wondered if we would be forced onto the Adieno or if there was a different plan. Mr. Parasyte and his group landed, some carrying sticks and ropes, hinting at possible force. We were uncertain if Vallington would fight or flee. Although we lacked weapons, a pile of sticks nearby caught our attention. When Mr. Parasyte's group arrived, the boat-keeper removed the plank, but it|"[""1.

Mr. Parasyte and his group had treated one of the students unfairly, but the students were determined to prove his innocence.

My heart raced with excitement as we embarked on our daring adventure, and I admired Henry Vallington's unexpected bravery. He seemed more like a fearless leader than a future clergyman. As my words echoed among the boys on deck, Vallington swiftly headed to the engine room. The sound of steam filled the air, and I anxiously awaited the outcome, unsure if disaster loomed. Suddenly, the wheels splashed into action, and the Adieno lurched forward, sending a surge of exhilaration through me. Luckily, the steamer was positioned favorably at the pier, requiring minimal skill to navigate. Although I lacked experience, I observed the steersman closely on previous trips. With trembling hands, I grasped the wheel, aligning the flagstaff and pier end to guide me. Slowly gaining confidence, I steered the vessel away from shore, the paddles churning the water. Despite my nervousness, I managed to stop the boat and signal for it to move forward. Vallington emerged, looking exhausted but determined.

Bob Hale and his friends were on a steamboat called the Adieno, heading towards a pier between two islands called The Sisters. Bob had doubts about the journey due to strong objections to steamboat ventures. As they navigated a narrow channel, the Adieno suddenly got stuck on the bottom, and the wind pushed it to the lee side of the channel. The boat was now hard aground. The narrator, feeling anxious and unsure about the situation, knew they were in a tough spot. The Adieno was stranded, and the strong winds were not helping. The narrator realized they were in a precarious situation as they awaited the Champion, a larger boat, which might be their pursuer.

I left the wheel-house feeling upset but determined to face the situation on the deck. Despite our disagreement, Vallington and I were the best of friends. He seemed burdened by his responsibilities and may have been irritable. I, as the chief of navigation, felt he wrongly accused me of causing the mishap.

I objected, but the leader was firm. We eventually accepted the idea, and I took charge of the journey. Our first task was to free the boat. Vallington returned to the engine room, and I went back to steering. I signaled to reverse, but the paddles churned the water in vain. The boat was stuck on the bottom. The boys looked worried, as if they were about to be captured. I didn't lose hope. I devised a plan to free the boat. Bob Hale and two others went ashore with a rope. After securing one end to a tree, I took the other end to the boat's shaft. With the boys' help, we pulled, hoping to move the boat.
