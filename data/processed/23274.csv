Will remained silent, listening intently to the mysterious sound that had interrupted Captain Dall's talk. The officer and the watchmen also noticed it, pausing in their movements to listen at the gangway. After a few moments of silence, a hoarse shout rang out, sending shivers down their spines. The repeated cry, closer this time, left the men uneasy and pale. But with resolute words, the crew sprang into action, lowering a boat into the dark waters. Will, among the first to leap in, took the bow oar. As they rowed, a dark object resembling a small canoe appeared ahead. Reacting swiftly, the men tried to steer away, but it was too late. The boat collided with the object, overturning it. Will saw a figure fall into the water and without hesitation, he dove in, remembering a crucial tip on saving drowning victims. He managed to rescue the man, later identified as Bunco, a man of color in a weakened state. Bunco shared his harrowing tale of surviving days at sea in a storm, saved just in time by the passing ship. The crew welcomed Bunco aboard, attending to his needs with care and warmth.|"['1.

After the incident, the crew seemed to have softened, and Captain Dall's suspicions remained unfounded for weeks. Griffin, the second mate, was the mastermind behind the plot, disguising his intentions skillfully. One evening, as the captain was having tea, Griffin falsely reported a sail sighting to lure him on deck. Once there, Griffin and his accomplices seized the captain. Despite his resistance, the crew quickly overpowered and secured him, along with others who tried to intervene. Griffin revealed his mutiny plans, offering the captain a boat and provisions before casting him adrift. Will Osten, the ship's doctor, was also detained against his will. The crew, under Griffin's command, showed no mercy, leaving the captain and his loyal crew members to face an uncertain fate.|"[""1.

Larry and Muggins decided to stay on the ship, much to the surprise of their comrades. They made this choice to avoid paddling in a small boat and instead sail on a proper ship. As the boat with some crew members departed, Will Osten realized he had said goodbye to his friends. He was then assigned duties as a seaman by the new captain, who wanted everyone to work. Despite their wish to escape, Larry and Muggins agreed to act content and stay focused on their tasks. Later, the crew was instructed to land on a small island by their suspicious captain, who seemed aware of their plans.

The group waited eagerly for the turtles to come ashore. It was nearly sunset when they arrived, but the turtles were in no rush to be caught, despite the prospect of being eaten by London aldermen. These creatures preferred to wait until nightfall before emerging from the sea to rest on the beach. In the meantime, the men prepared a shelter by turning the boat upside down and creating a cozy space with grass and leaves underneath. Once ready, they were taught how to turn the turtles over onto their backs when they appeared. When the turtles finally arrived, the men sprang into action, flipping them over one by one.

The turtle started to flap its flippers frantically, kicking up sand everywhere. Undeterred, the pursuers squinted and pushed forward. Larry tried to shout but got a mouthful of sand, causing him to cough and splutter. Despite the chaos, Muggins bravely pressed on. Reminiscent of war heroes, he faced the storm of sand and emerged victorious, flipping the turtle on its back. The crew celebrated their success with a bonfire and fresh meat from the turtles. After spending a couple of days on the island, the crew continued their journey to South America. One evening, they sent a crew ashore but faced danger in the surf. Griffin, the captain, ended up disappearing in the waves, leaving his crew shocked and the mate to take charge.|['1.

Will Osten and his friends seized a chance to escape the ship when one of the crew proposed it. They were resolute, but the rest of the crew, led by a giant, intended to stay and even force them to stay too. Will, skilled in boxing, used his knowledge to protect his friends. He swiftly dealt blows to the giant, stunning him. Despite a brief scuffle, the crew decided to flee. As they ran, Will's friends fell into a hidden hole, narrowly avoiding capture. The crew, including the giant, retreated, and Will's group escaped into the nearby dense woods. Larry O'Hale even taunted their pursuers before they disappeared into the safety of the forest.|"[""1.

Will and his friends found themselves lost in the dense forest of South America after a daring escape from their pursuers. Ignorant of the dangers lurking in the unknown wilderness, they wandered aimlessly until darkness forced them to stop. Sitting on a fallen tree stump, they realized their predicament. Larry O'Hale joked about the bliss of ignorance, while Old Peter suggested building a fire to keep wild animals at bay. With the meager supplies they had, including knives, food, tobacco, and a Testament, they decided to share everything. Will, guided by his mother's teachings, abstained from smoking, showing the influence of a mother's guidance. As they prepared to spend the night in the forest, they reflected on the importance of their limited resources and the comfort of familiar items from home.|"[""1.

The group of travelers had a mix of clothing, with Larry in a pilot-cloth coat and a scarlet neckerchief, Old Peter in a blue jacket, Muggins in a dirty canvas jacket, and Will Osten in a dark blue shooting-coat. They armed themselves with cudgels and gathered around a fire in the forest for supper. Suddenly, a gunshot startled them, causing them to take cover. Will bravely stepped into the light to invite the stranger who fired the shot to join them. The stranger, Bunco, appeared and offered them birds for dinner. Larry, Peter, and Bunco prepared the birds for cooking as Will suggested letting Bunco take charge of the cooking. Bunco expertly roasted the birds over the fire, impressing the group with his forest cooking skills.|['1.

During their escape from the ship, Will asked Bunco how he managed to flee with a gun. Bunco explained that he slipped into the boat when the commotion started, gathered supplies, and followed their tracks to find them. Bunco, who was part Indian and part Spanish, shared his life story of hunting and fighting in the forests and mountains of California. He also mentioned being kidnapped by a wicked captain and losing his wife. Larry sympathized with Bunco's story and suggested they travel to California to find his wife. As night fell, they decided to sleep in a tree. The forest's eerie sounds made the seamen nervous, but Bunco cheerfully chose a large tree for their makeshift shelter.|"['1.

The large tree had branches that spread out like smaller trees in England. The men found a spot to rest on the branches after replenishing the fire. Later that night, they were woken by a crash and a loud howl. They saw a dark figure below, but it turned out to be a man who had rolled out of his sleep and landed softly on a tree branch. The man, Larry O'Hale, joked about sleeping on trees. The group continued their journey with Bunco leading the way. Initially, they walked easily through the woods. However, as time passed, the dense undergrowth made it difficult to proceed. Muggins, feeling fatigued, questioned Bunco's guidance. But Bunco managed to find a way through the thickets, earning back the trust of the group. They encountered snakes, causing a fright, and strange sounds in the bushes, but it turned out to be a hairy arm playfully taking Muggins's hat.|"['1.

Jo Gruffy, recounting the wonders of the world to his companions, shared tales of countries like Peru with its abundance of animals, including monkeys. Our hero, surprised by this information, expressed concern about the boldness of these creatures. Despite the warning, they continued their journey through the dense jungle, where the sky was rarely visible due to the thick canopy of trees. The sounds of wild beasts filled the air, putting the group on high alert. As they reached a dark ravine, they heard approaching footsteps and quickly hid. A magnificent black horse raced past them, pursued closely by a large tiger. The tiger leaped onto the horse, but Bunco, one of the travelers, took aim and shot the tiger, saving the horse from its grasp.|"['1.

Bunco acted bravely when he faced a fierce tiger armed with just a knife. His comrades thought him mad as he plunged the knife into the tiger, causing it to roar and thrash about. Despite missing a blow and falling, Bunco managed to stab the tiger three times, eventually defeating it. Will Osten, concerned for Bunco's injuries, tended to his wounds, which turned out to be minor. Bunco skillfully skinned the tiger and carried it with him. As they traveled, they stumbled upon a hospitable man of mixed heritage who informed them of their location in Ecuador and the nearby town of Tacames.

For a long time, there was complete silence. The night was clear, the moon full, and not a leaf moved in the forest surrounding the small clearing. Only the buzz of mosquitoes and the flapping of a bat broke the silence. Suddenly, the cattle in the yard began to low mournfully, sensing danger. Moments of anxiety followed until bullocks near the hut started bellowing furiously. A tiger leaped into the yard, illuminated by the moon. Three shots rang out, and the tiger fell. The travelers, excited by their success, stayed up preparing breakfast. With a new gun in hand, they resumed their journey at daybreak, bidding farewell to their gracious host. Their adventures continued through tangled forests and sandy plains until they reached the small town of Tacames in Ecuador.|['1.

Will Osten spoke to the Spaniard in English, and to his surprise, the Spaniard responded in the same language. The Spaniard had learned English from ship captains that visited the port. The Spaniard's strange grin and behavior puzzled the travelers until he revealed his excruciating toothache. Will offered to help by pulling the tooth with forceps borrowed from a local apothecary. Despite Don Diego's resistance, the tooth was successfully removed, and he was immensely grateful. This act of kindness led Don Diego to invite the travelers to stay at his house. Will's medical knowledge also helped cure others in the town, earning them gratitude and gifts.

Will Osten and his companions decided to extend their stay by a week or two in the hopes of spotting a passing ship. They planned a hunting trip suggested by Bunco. They borrowed canoes from their host and set off up the river Tacames. The group felt excited and exhilarated as they embarked on their adventure into the unknown. The dense forest and river scenery were breathtaking, filled with vibrant birds and wild sounds. However, the joy was dampened by the relentless attacks of mosquitoes. Despite the challenges, they managed to spear some mullet and encountered a herd of deer. A thrilling encounter with tigers led to the successful hunting of one. Over the following weeks, they had more successful hunts, but an unexpected event would soon disrupt their harmonious group.|"['1.

Larry and Will found themselves on the edge of a cliff overlooking a gorge. Down below, a tiger was devouring a goat it had caught. Larry took a shot but missed. Will's shot wounded the tiger, causing it to flee. They salvaged the goat for dinner and headed back to their canoe as night fell. Lost in the dark forest, they camped under a tree. They lit a fire and shot in the air to signal their location to their friend Bunco. Despite the wild sounds at night, they made a comfortable bed of leaves on a tree platform. While taking turns to stay awake, Larry struggled to keep watch but eventually succumbed to sleep. In the middle of the night, a terrifying roar woke them up, ready to defend themselves.|['1.

"""Did you hear the shots we fired?"" asked Will. Bunco admitted not only hearing the shots but also witnessing their activities. He found great joy in planning a prank on them, even imitating a tiger to contain his excitement. Bunco revealed the canoe's location and promised to keep watch while they slept. The next morning, the group resumed their journey in the canoe. The landscape changed from dense forests to cultivated farms. They were warmly welcomed by the locals, who mistook Will for a doctor. In a town with a stream and fragrant trees, Will was sought after for medical advice. As they prepared to leave, news of a revolution led by a colonel reached them. The town prepared for defense, and Will and his friends volunteered to help. The region was prone to such uprisings, and the threat intensified the town's preparations.

Larry, emerging from the snow like a ghost, shared the tragic loss of a mule that fell off a cliff. Will, saddened, started to recount his own mule's demise. Suddenly, Bunco yanked Will away from a cliff edge, saving him from a fatal fall. As a storm raged, they pressed on through the pass, braving the elements. The storm cleared, and they descended towards Columbia's plains. Transitioning from icy mountains to tropical heat, they relaxed in a canoe down the Orinoco. Larry, forgetting his food, was comforted by Will's foresight. Crocodiles and jungle noises disrupted their peace. At a tiger-hunter's camp, Larry's encounter with a wild animal caused chaos. The night was filled with jungle sounds, a storm, and a bat attack, ending with Larry's accidental clash with a cat.|"[""1.
