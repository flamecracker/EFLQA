"If the trip were big, I bet you he was the best watch-dog you'd ever see! So last winter, just before it was Christmas Day, Pa had to go to attend a lawsuit. ""And the snow was just right for Santa Claus!"" Pa said as he climbed into old Ayersuz' sled. He apologized for not being able to be with us that night, in case Santa might be coming. Uncle Sid waved as they went, Pa joking about not needing sleigh bells until Santa arrived. In the kitchen, Ma was busy cooking, and Uncle teased her about working hard since she was as young as Etty or Lee-Bob. Uncle reminisced about how Pa used to cook, winning awards at the Fair. He'd bust potatoes in the hot ashes and cook them to perfection. Uncle would then light his pipe with Lee-Bob's help, joking that Lee-Bob was the best lighter. Uncle shared stories from his childhood, warning Etty not to talk too much or forget that little pitchers have big ears. Uncle then teased Ma to finish the Christmas cooking or the children wouldn't have any. Trip, the dog, would wake up, look around, and then lay back down. Uncle shared tales of past Christmases, promising that Santa would visit them all one day."|"[""1.
