When emigrants arrive in cities like New York, Boston, or Philadelphia, they bring more than just their belongings. Along with a small bundle of clothes and some money, they carry valuable baggage - their knowledge, customs, and memories from their homeland. This cultural luggage shapes who they are and what they can contribute to their new home. Emigrants already know how to do the work they seek in America and have learned to obey laws and fulfill their duties as citizens. Their past experiences prepare them to participate in self-government. They also bring cherished memories of their heritage and religious practices passed down through generations. By understanding the history of their native land, we can appreciate the rich backgrounds that all Americans, including ourselves, as descendants of emigrants, share. The early emigrants who first settled in America brought with them essential skills and customs that laid the foundation for the diverse and innovative society we live in today.|['1.

"Ancient words from the Greeks and Romans still influence our language today. Many words we use have roots in these ancient languages, with slight changes in spelling. Our English ancestors initially brought words from Germany before settling in England. Over time, we continued to adopt words from various languages, like French. For instance, words like ""tonneau"" and ""limousine"" for parts of a car, and ""automobile,"" a combination of Latin and Greek, are recent additions. Latin and Greek have contributed thousands of words to our language. Words like ""school"" from Greek and ""arithmetic"" from French, ultimately from Greek, show this influence. Even words related to religion and government have ancient Greek origins. Stories of Hercules, the Golden Fleece, Troy, and Ulysses have been passed down through generations. The Greeks' heroic battles against the Persians at Marathon, Thermopylae, and Salamis are legendary tales of courage that continue to inspire us today."|['1.

In 490 B.C., the Athenians prepared for the famous Battle of Marathon. The Athenians lived in what is now modern Athens, with their ruins still attracting visitors. When news of the Persian army's approach arrived, they sent a runner, Pheidippides, to seek help from Sparta, 140 miles away. Despite Sparta's delay due to religious customs, the Athenians knew they had to face the Persians alone. The Athenians, armed with lances, short swords, bronze helmets, breastplates, and shields, assembled their army. The Persians, though outnumbering the Athenians, were not as well-equipped for close combat. The battle took place on the plain of Marathon, where the Athenians strategically positioned themselves to confront the Persians. Despite initial hesitation, the Athenians, led by Miltiades, charged towards the Persians, surprising them with their swift advance.|['**Question 1:** What was the purpose of sending Pheidippides to Sparta?\n- A) To deliver a message to the Persian army\n- B) To seek help from the Spartans against the Persians\n- C) To warn the Athenians about the approaching Persian army\n- D) To gather supplies for the Athenian army\n- E) To negotiate a peace treaty with the Persians', '**Question 2:** How far was Sparta from Athens?\n- A) 50 miles\n- B) 75 miles\n- C) 100 miles\n- D) 125 miles\n- E) 140 miles', '**Question 3:** What equipment did the Athenians have during the Battle of Marathon?\n- A) Bows and arrows\n- B) Spears and shields\n- C) Cannons and muskets\n- D) Rifles and bayonets\n- E) Swords and armor', '**Question 4:** Who led the Athenians during the Battle of Marathon?\n- A) Pheidippides\n- B) Miltiades\n- C) Spartans\n- D) Persians\n- E) Athenian runners', '**Question 5:** Where did the Battle of Marathon take place?\n- A) In the city of Athens\n- B) In the mountains of Sparta\n- C) On the plains of Marathon\n- D) By the sea\n- E) In the Persian capital', '**Question 6:** How did the Athenians surprise the Persians during the battle?\n- A) By retreating and regrouping\n- B) By surrendering without a fight\n- C) By attacking with a slow and steady pace\n- D) By launching a swift advance\n- E) By sending a peace envoy']|['** B) To seek help from the Spartans against the Persians', '** E) 140 miles', '** E) Swords and armor', '** B) Miltiades', '** C) On the plains of Marathon', '** D) By launching a swift advance']
When the Greeks charged at the Persians, the soldiers at the ends of the Persian line fled towards the shore. In the center, where the best Persian soldiers stood, the Greeks initially struggled and had to retreat. However, the victorious Greeks came to their aid, attacking the Persians from behind and eventually driving them away. The Persians ran into the sea to reach their ships, with the Athenians in pursuit. Some Greeks were so determined that they clung to the sides of the ships, but the Persians cut their hands to make them release their grip. The Athenians celebrated this victory at Marathon, where they honored their fallen comrades with a mound of earth as a tomb. This triumph marked the beginning of Greek victories over the Persians, leading to further heroic battles like the one at Thermopylae.

Ancient Greeks primarily resided in cities due to their government and essential activities being centralized there. The cities were fortified with tall stone walls for protection, often enclosing a hill known as the acropolis where people sought refuge during attacks. In Athens, the acropolis rose 200 feet above the plain, housing stunning temples like the Parthenon. Unlike modern homes, Greek private houses were modest, with an emphasis on grand public structures like temples, theaters, and porticoes. Temples like the Parthenon were relatively small, with intricate columns and elaborate carvings. While the Parthenon now stands partially ruined, other Greek temples like the Theseum in Athens and those in Paestum, Italy, and Girgenti, Sicily, showcase the architectural influence they had on Roman and European constructions.|['1.

Greek architectural methods are still influential today. Many modern buildings borrow from the Greeks, either replicating their exact forms or adapting them as the Romans did. Pillars like the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian are still seen in architecture. The Greeks' theaters were initially open spaces with tents for actors, evolving into amphitheaters with stone seats and painted scenes. These theaters hosted plays during religious festivals, attracting large crowds. The stadium, resembling the theater but oblong, was used for races. Porticoes, meeting places with roofed columns, and gymnasiums were common in Greek cities. Greek sculpture, showcased in museums worldwide, reveals the artists' exceptional skill. Famous pieces include the Venus de Milo, Hermes, and figures from the Parthenon.|['1.

In ancient Greece, artists studied Greek statues and sculptures to learn their techniques. They didn't aim to surpass the Greeks but were content being their pupils. The Greeks were skilled in painting, pottery, and metalwork. Greek boys learned to write on wax boards and expensive papyrus scrolls. They memorized Homer's epic poems and wise sayings. Boys played games like hide-and-seek and were trained in athletics, music, and military skills. The Olympic Games were highly anticipated, where athletes competed in running, wrestling, boxing, and discus throwing. Victors received a crown of wild olive and were celebrated with poems, statues, and special honors in their cities. The games were so important that wars were paused to ensure they took place.|['1.

The Athenian government was unique in ancient Greece. Citizens had more involvement in their government than many Americans today. The great assembly, or _ecclesia_, required at least six thousand citizens to make decisions. Foreigners could be granted citizenship or citizens expelled through this assembly. A smaller council of five hundred dealt with less important matters. Members were chosen by lot, like our juries. A tenth of the council ruled for a tenth of the year, choosing their president daily by lot. Athenians also served as judges, with up to six thousand judges deciding cases. Socrates, a famous philosopher, was condemned to death by a court of five hundred and one judges. He questioned others about the true way to live, leading to his unjust death by drinking hemlock. His teachings were passed down by friends like Plato, enriching the world with their wisdom.|['1.

Greek settlers from ancient times ventured out to establish colonies in distant lands for various reasons, much like our ancestors who sought new opportunities in America. The Greeks sought advice from Apollo's priests at Delphi to choose the best locations for their new cities. They carried fire from their mother city to light the hearth of their new settlement. Close ties were maintained between the mother city and its colonies. The Greek sailors expanded their settlements to the Black Sea and later to Sicily and southern Italy, where they shared their knowledge with local tribes. The Greeks also settled in southern France and eastern Spain, founding Massilia (Marseilles), a key trading hub that connected the ancient world to Britain for tin supplies.|"[""1.

Greek colonies served as hubs of civilization where the Greeks traded with nearby villagers, influencing them to adopt Greek ways. This cultural exchange extended Greek influence along the Mediterranean shores. Greek ships, unlike modern vessels, relied on oars more than sails. The trireme, a common warship, boasted three rows of oarsmen for continuous rowing at high speeds. Alexander the Great, a skilled leader, expanded Greek culture eastward through conquests, founding numerous cities, including Alexandria. This city became a hub of learning with a vast library and a university where scholars like Euclid and Ptolemy made significant contributions to mathematics and geography. Alexandria also played a pivotal role in trade and commerce, influencing Roman tastes through its beautiful Greek creations.|"[""1.

The Greek colonies faced threats from nearby tribes and the Carthaginians in Sicily, who controlled the western Mediterranean. The Carthaginians, originally from Phoenicia, had colonies in Spain for trade. Romans, living along the Tiber River, were the main threat to Greek colonists in Italy. Roman history includes legends like Romulus and Remus founding Rome. The Gauls, ancestors of the French, attacked Rome in 390 B.C. The Romans defended the Capitoline hill, with some senators choosing to stay and face the Gauls. Geese alerted the Romans to the Gauls' night attack, saving the garrison but not the city. In another event, the Romans were defeated by the Samnites at the Caudine Forks due to blocked paths and ambushes.|"['1.

"The Samnites forced the Roman army, including both generals and soldiers, to walk ""under the yoke,"" which was made of two spears placed upright with another one laid across. The Samnites stood by and taunted them. If any Roman showed anger or sadness at the humiliation, they were hit or even killed. This event was known as the disaster of the Caudine Forks, named after the place where the Romans were trapped. Later, the Romans clashed with the Greek cities in southern Italy. The Greeks of Tarentum sought help from Pyrrhus, a skilled general ruling part of Alexander's former kingdom. Despite having trained elephants, the Romans managed to defeat Pyrrhus in a third battle in 275 B.C. This victory marked the Romans as the conquerors of Italy, uniting the region under their rule. The Romans were primarily farmers and cattle breeders, living simple lives. Roman boys learned the Twelve Tables, the first Roman laws, at school, showing their early interest in legislation.

The people of ancient Rome were divided into two main groups: the patricians, who were the nobles, and the plebeians, who were the common folk. The patricians initially held all the knowledge of the laws, which were not written down. This led to disputes between the patricians and plebeians, with the plebeians feeling that the laws were being changed unfairly. Twice, the plebeians protested by leaving the city until their grievances were addressed. Eventually, they forced the nobles to write down the laws in the Twelve Tables. Over time, the plebeians gained more rights and opportunities, moving up to become nobles themselves. The government of Rome was led by consuls, chosen each year to prevent one person from gaining too much power. Senators held significant influence, and assemblies generally followed their guidance. The Romans were strategic in dealing with conquered territories, allowing the conquered peoples to become Roman citizens and participate in governance. Rome faced serious threats from the Gauls and Carthaginians but prevailed due to their resilience and determination.|['1.

The conflict between Rome and Carthage was fueled by Carthaginian concerns over Roman expansion and trade threats. Tensions escalated over a Sicilian city, leading to naval battles where Rome's innovative tactics turned the tide. The Romans demanded hefty reparations and territorial concessions, further provoking Carthage. Subsequently, Hannibal, a brilliant Carthaginian general, led a retaliatory campaign into Italy. His army faced treacherous conditions crossing the Alps, enduring attacks from local tribes and losing many soldiers and animals. Hannibal's resilience and strategic prowess impressed even his Roman adversaries, setting the stage for a fierce and decisive confrontation near Rome.|"['1.

"How Hannibal Outwitted the Romans

Hannibal, a brilliant Carthaginian general, secured a decisive victory over the Romans at the Trebia River in northern Italy. On a winter day, Hannibal's clever tactics outsmarted the Romans. He sent horsemen to provoke the Romans while preparing his soldiers strategically. The Romans, hastily responding to the attack, crossed the swollen river, only to find themselves cold and vulnerable. Hannibal then launched a fierce assault, ambushing the Romans and using elephants to create chaos. Despite some Roman soldiers escaping, the majority of their army was decimated.

This defeat was not the end of Roman resilience. Despite suffering losses in subsequent battles, the Romans persevered, adapting their strategies to wear down Hannibal.

"The Romans governed their conquered lands in Sicily, Spain, Africa, Greece, and Asia through appointed officers who often abused their power. Tax collectors, known as ""publicans,"" were also sent to these provinces. Roman soldiers were stationed in these territories to suppress any uprisings. The Romans' conquests led to negative consequences. Many farmers were displaced due to wars, leading to a decline in agriculture. Wealthy Romans bought up small farms, creating large estates worked by slaves. The poor became unemployed as slaves took over their jobs. Cruel sports, including fights between humans and animals, were organized for entertainment. Despite these issues, the Romans adopted Greek architectural styles, enhancing Rome's buildings.

The Romans were greatly influenced by the Greeks in their education. They learned how to write poems and histories from the Greeks. Initially, Roman histories were written in Greek, but later they excelled in writing in Latin, matching the quality of Greek literature. Greek became a vital second language for educated Romans, allowing them to enjoy both Greek and Roman literary works. The education of Roman boys started with Homer's poems, and it was considered incomplete until they traveled to Greece and other Mediterranean lands. The Romans expanded their conquests beyond civilized territories, exploring and conquering unknown lands like Gaul, Germany, and Britain. The Gauls and Germans were distinct from the Romans and Greeks, living in villages and forests, with the Germans being particularly feared for their towering stature. Gaul and German warriors were led by kings or nobles, adorned with gold and armored for battle. The education and conquests of the Romans marked a significant shift in the ancient civilized world towards the Atlantic.|"['1.

The Germans had a unique way of living when they were not in battle. They relied on women and slaves to do all the work, while they indulged in drinking and gambling. In their games, losing could mean losing one's freedom to the winner. Despite this, they respected their wives, who sometimes even accompanied them to battle, offering encouragement or stern reproaches to keep the warriors focused. The Germans had a distinct religion, with days of the week named after their gods. Wodan, the god of the sun and storms, was their principal deity, with Wednesday named after him. Thor, the god of thunder, gave Thursday its name, while Tuesday and Friday were named after the gods of war and love, respectively.

The story of Caesar and Vercingetorix is a tale of bravery and defeat. Vercingetorix, a Gaul warrior, faced the mighty Caesar but found the task too hard. He sought refuge in Alesia, a hilltop fortress, where Caesar's army laid siege. The Romans dug deep trenches to prevent the Gauls from escaping and built defenses to fend off rescue attempts. Despite Vercingetorix's heroic efforts, he surrendered to Caesar to save his people. Sadly, he was paraded in Rome's triumph and later executed. A monument in Alesia honors his courage. Caesar's conquest of Gaul was complete. He later crossed the Rhine into Germany, leaving a bridge as a symbol of Roman power.

The Gauls and Britons adopted Roman culture after initially resisting Caesar's rule. They embraced Latin, excelling in the language to the point where Roman youths sought education in Gaul. Similarly, Germans enlisted in Roman armies, carrying Roman customs back home. Americans value Roman influence in Spain, Gaul, Germany, and Britain, as these regions influenced early American settlers. The vast Roman world included modern-day countries like England, France, Spain, and Italy, extending to parts of Eastern Europe and North Africa. Romans spread Greek civilization to areas untouched by Greeks, expanding their influence.

Roman aqueducts were vital for the empire, delivering water from faraway sources to cities like Rome. The aqueducts, like the grand Claudian aqueduct, spanned miles, supported by towering arches. The aqueducts transported water through lead pipes, resting on arches when crossing valleys. The aqueducts totaled over 300 miles, providing Rome with a vast water supply. Romans also used water for public baths, where people bathed, exercised, and socialized. The Romans constructed impressive buildings like the Colosseum for gladiator fights and the Circus Maximus for chariot races. The Pantheon, known for its massive dome, served as a temple and later a Christian church, now a burial site for Italian royalty.

"The Romans had grand buildings called basilicas, used for public meetings, with a central space covered by a roof. Some basilicas became Christian churches, with the central area called the ""nave"" and the aisles between columns. Triumphal arches were built to celebrate victories, inspiring modern memorial arches. Roman laws, though harsh to war captives and slaves, protected free men and women. Emperor Justinian ordered a single code of laws, influencing European and American laws. Roman roads were built meticulously, lasting for ages. Jerusalem, captured by the Romans, was a place of religious importance for Jews, with great preachers promoting justice and mercy.

Jesus of Nazareth was born in a village near Jerusalem a few years before the Jewish kingdom became a Roman province. He grew up in Nazareth and gathered followers, whom he taught to live as described in the New Testament. This marked the beginning of the Christian religion. Although it was initially embraced by a small group of Jews, a man named Paul from Tarsus believed that the message of this new religion was meant for people of all nations. He spread this teaching in various cities across Asia Minor, Greece, and even Rome. Despite facing persecution from the Romans who disliked their refusal to worship the emperor and their secretive gatherings, Christians continued to spread their beliefs. Eventually, the Roman Empire adopted Christianity around 325 A.D. under Emperor Constantine. The Christians were united under strong leaders, with bishops and archbishops overseeing the faithful in different cities and regions.|['1.

During the Middle Ages, there were two types of clergy: parish priests and monks. Parish priests led ordinary parishes, while monks lived in monasteries, dedicating themselves to prayer, fasting, and teaching. Monks sometimes isolated themselves from daily life to focus on spiritual practices, while other times they served as educators, spreading knowledge to underdeveloped communities. The Romans initially prohibited Christians from worshiping, punishing them for their beliefs. It took over a thousand years, from Constantine to Columbus, for emperors to allow Christians to worship freely. The Middle Ages marked significant changes in Europe, with the rise of new powers like the Moors, Turks, and Arabs. The era saw a shift in importance from Mediterranean to Atlantic countries, leading to the renaming of regions like Gaul to France and Britannia to England.

Long ago, the Goths, living north of the Danube, embraced Christianity under Bishop Ulfilas, who translated the Bible into Gothic, marking it as the oldest German text. This led other Germanic tribes to learn about Christianity. Despite being foes of the Roman government, they respected the Church. The Goths invaded the Roman Empire, causing havoc. Alaric, a Gothic leader, captured Rome in 410 but spared churches. As the Roman Empire weakened, German kings gained control of its provinces. England emerged as the Angles and Saxons from Germany invaded, forming Anglo-Saxon England. Constantinople remained relatively unchanged, with its sturdy walls enduring attacks. In contrast, Roman ruins in Italy and Western Europe crumbled, with buildings like the Colosseum repurposed. The world around Constantinople retained some ancient ways, while the West saw cities fall into disrepair.|"[""1.

During the Middle Ages, few people traveled between Constantinople and Italy or France, and those from western Europe rarely visited Constantinople. Most men in Italy, France, and England couldn't read Greek and had stopped reading the works of ancient Romans. In 597 A.D., Christianity spread throughout the Roman Empire, becoming the religion of tribes that established their kingdoms. The Angles and Saxons, who invaded Britain, were pagan worshippers until Gregory, a Roman monk, saw three fair-haired Angle boys in Rome and decided to convert them. This led to the arrival of missionaries in Angle-land. The conversion of the English aided in spreading Christianity, especially to the Germans, through missionaries like Boniface. Educated individuals in the Middle Ages, particularly church priests, used Latin and preserved Roman and Greek knowledge. The Vikings, also known as Northmen or Normans, were fierce sea-rovers who plundered and conquered lands across western Europe.|['1.

The Danes were fierce raiders who attacked the eastern and southern coasts of England, pillaging until there was little left. Eventually, they settled in the land, leading to conflicts with English kings like Alfred. In 878 A.D., Alfred defeated a Danish army and converted one of their kings to Christianity. The Danes were allowed to keep the eastern part of England, known as Danelaw. Later, the Danes moved to France, where they were given Normandy by a Frankish king. The Normans embraced Christianity and became skilled sailors, exploring far-off lands like Iceland and Greenland. Leif Ericson, son of Eric the Red, even reached North America, where they established temporary settlements. Thornfinn Karlsefni attempted to colonize Vinland but faced conflicts with Native Americans, leading to the eventual abandonment of the settlement.|"['1.

The voyages to Vinland were eventually forgotten, with Leif's discoveries only surviving in songs and sagas. Vinland was depicted as a land of flat stones, towering trees, and hostile natives. Surprisingly, even the scholars in Europe who heard the Northmen's tales didn't realize a New World had been found. Fortunately, it took 500 years for Europeans to settle in America, allowing them to gain knowledge and rediscover lost treasures. The more Europeans knew before arriving in America, the better equipped they were. The Middle Ages are filled with captivating stories like King Arthur's Knights and the tales of Roland and the Niebelungs, blending history and folklore. King Alfred of England, a skilled warrior and wise ruler, valued education, translating Latin texts into English to prevent his people from becoming ignorant barbarians.|"['1.

Alfred, a wise king, ordered his clergy to keep a yearly record of events in his kingdom, known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the first history in English. He also gathered laws from previous kings to ensure everyone knew the law. Alfred is credited with starting the English navy to defend against Danish raids, though victory was not always certain. He reorganized his fighters, keeping a third ready at all times. William the Conqueror took the English throne in 1066, uniting Normans and English, leading to the construction of Norman churches. Henry II, a successor, ruled over vast lands and improved truth-finding methods in courts. Before Henry, trials by ordeal were common, like carrying a red-hot iron or being thrown into water to determine guilt.|['1.

In medieval times, disputes were settled through wager of battle, where two men fought with hammers or small battle-axes, and the loser conceded. King Henry introduced a fairer method, trial by jury. Twelve men were chosen to hear the facts, discuss, and then decide who was right. These men, known as jurors, were crucial in finding the truth. Richard the Lionhearted, King Henry's son, was a fearless warrior who tried to recapture Jerusalem. His brother John, who became king after Richard, was cowardly and wicked. Tired of John's misdeeds, the nobles and clergy forced him to sign the Magna Carta at Runnymede. This document ensured fair treatment, the right to a trial by jury, and limited the king's power to levy taxes without consent. The Magna Carta was a significant step towards self-government.|"['1.

The English parliament was a significant development in self-governance. When King John broke his promises, the English reminded him of the Great Charter. Simon de Montfort led a meeting with town representatives to discuss the king's actions, setting a precedent for seeking advice from various groups. Over time, this evolved into Parliament, comprising the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Representatives were chosen to attend, ensuring efficient decision-making. This system contrasted with the Romans, who required citizens to be present in Rome for elections. The Channel protected the English from external threats, allowing them to challenge their king without fear of invasion. Unlike France, England was more united, fostering a culture of self-governance and learning from other European nations.|"['1.

During the Middle Ages, nobles held titles like knights, barons, counts, or dukes. In England, there were also earls. These nobles ruled smaller territories like kings, often gaining power through their wealth in land and their ability to lead men in battle. They protected people from attacks by other nobles. Kings and nobles built castles for safety, strategically placing them on hilltops or islands with moats for defense. Knights, trained in the art of fighting from a young age, served their lords and were expected to defend the weak, protect women, and show courtesy even to enemies. Knights were known for their chivalry, embodying qualities like courage, honor, and respect.|['1.

The peasants and townsmen in the Middle Ages lived in villages close to castles or monasteries for protection. Peasants worked on the lord's lands and gave part of their harvest as payment. Towns were initially ruled by lords but some became self-governed communes. Citizens had to gather when the town bell rang, and guilds were formed for different trades like goldsmiths and merchants. Many medieval towns have evolved into modern cities like York and London, preserving their history through churches and walls. Venice, built on islands, used waterways as streets and thrived in sea trade. Genoa, birthplace of Columbus, was another prosperous trading city in Italy. Today, these old cities stand as testaments to their rich past.|"['1.

In the Middle Ages, people built city walls and towers for protection, but they also unknowingly shaped the modern languages we speak today like English, German, French, Italian, and Spanish. English and German are closely linked as English ancestors brought their language from Germany. Dutch is similar to both English and German. Many words in these languages were borrowed from other cultures. English borrowed from French due to their historical ties, while French evolved from Latin learned from the Romans. Modern languages like French, Italian, and Spanish developed from everyday Latin spoken in those regions. Education in the Middle Ages was limited, mainly for those pursuing religious paths. Schools were often in monasteries or the homes of bishops, teaching Latin, arithmetic, astronomy, and music. Universities emerged as students delved into Roman laws, medicine, and theology, forming guilds to advance learning.|['1.

In ancient times, universities had no permanent buildings. Teachers would rent halls to teach, and students had to find their own lodging. To support poorer students and have more control over their education, colleges were established as residential houses where teaching also took place. The oldest university in Bologna, Italy, dates back eight hundred years, focusing on Roman law. The University of Paris, known as the greatest in the Middle Ages, had thousands of students. Oxford and Cambridge in England were founded around the same time. Arab scholars played a vital role in preserving Greek knowledge and advancing fields like algebra. The Middle Ages saw remarkable architectural achievements in churches and cathedrals, with Gothic architecture becoming prominent in Europe. These structures featured intricate carvings, colorful stained glass windows, and towering roofs supported by pointed arches and buttresses.|['1.

The Renaissance marked a time when men shifted from barbarism to civilization, embracing knowledge from ancient Greeks and Romans. Petrarch, an Italian poet, led the way by seeking and preserving Roman writings. With the help of Greek scholars fleeing Constantinople, Greek books were reintroduced to Italy, sparking a renewed interest in learning. The invention of printing with movable types around 1450, attributed to John Gutenberg, revolutionized the spread of knowledge by making books more accessible. This innovation led to the establishment of libraries across Europe and facilitated the exchange of ideas among scholars from different countries. The Renaissance not only ended the Middle Ages but also ignited a rebirth of learning and cultural exploration that shaped the modern world.|['1.

During the Middle Ages, different kinds of type were developed by printers. German printers used Gothic type, imitating quill lettering, which is still used in German books. Italian printers created Roman type, more rounded and simple, resembling Italian handwriting and widely used in Europe, England, and America. They also introduced italic type. The Aldine Press, run by Venetian Aldus Manutius, printed Greek manuscripts in beautiful type. William Caxton, an English printer, printed Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Gutenberg's first printed book was the Bible in Latin. In architecture and sculpture, artists imitated Greek and Roman styles, using round arches and domes. Sculptors depicted stories of gods and heroes, inspired by ancient statues. This revival of ancient art and knowledge in the Renaissance period led to a reawakening of minds across Europe.|['1.

During the Middle Ages, merchants faced perilous journeys due to the threat of robbers on land and sea. Robbers, including the Northmen and local sailors, targeted traders for their goods. However, as trade expanded, kings and lords provided protection on land, and merchants armed their ships against pirates at sea. This led to a decrease in robberies and piracy, allowing merchant ships to increase in number and undertake long voyages. Trade initially thrived at large fairs where merchants from England and Europe exchanged goods like spices, silks, and wool. Luxuries like spices, cotton, and dyes were sourced from the East, including Persia, India, and China. Venetian traders played a significant role in trading these Eastern goods, sailing fleets to Bruges and London to exchange products from the North for spices, drugs, and silks.|['1.

During the Crusades, the Venetians seized an opportunity to profit by transporting Crusaders to the Holy Land on their ships. They charged high fees and gained trading rights in captured seaports. The returning Crusaders sparked a demand for Eastern luxuries, leading to the construction of larger and stronger Venetian ships. These ships, equipped with oars and sails, were vital for trade in the Mediterranean.

During the Middle Ages, the astrolabe and compass aided sailors in navigating the vast Atlantic. Ships from Genoa and Portugal reached distant islands like Madeira, the Canaries, and even the Azores. Marco Polo, a Venetian traveler, shared tales of his journey to the Mongol Emperor's court, dispelling myths of a boiling ocean and terrifying sea monsters in the tropics. The Mongols, fierce conquerors, sought knowledge from Europeans and welcomed Marco Polo into their service. Marco Polo's travels revealed the opulent palace of the Great Emperor, adorned with gold and silver, hosting grand feasts for thousands. His accounts of the Mongol Empire's riches and splendor captivated many, dispelling fears and inspiring new dreams of distant lands.|"['1.

"During the Middle Ages, European explorers like Marco Polo shared tales of the rich lands of the East, with descriptions of silk and gold in China and Japan. These stories fueled the desire to find a sea route to the East. As land routes were blocked, Portuguese sailors led by Prince Henry ""The Navigator"" sought new paths. They sailed south along the African coast, passing Cape Verde and crossing the equator. Finally, in 1487, Bartholomew Diaz reached the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, proving that a direct sea route to the Indies was possible.

In the quest for a sea route to India, Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese captain, successfully reached the coast of India by sailing around the Cape of Good Hope in 1499. This journey marked the beginning of a lucrative trade with the East that greatly benefited Portugal and the merchants of Lisbon. In a similar pursuit, Christopher Columbus, a native of Genoa, Italy, embarked on a daring plan to sail west from Europe in search of new lands and the Asian coast. Influenced by the explorations of Prince Henry the Navigator and inspired by Marco Polo's tales of the riches of Asia, Columbus believed in the possibility of reaching Asia by sailing west. Despite skepticism from many in the fifteenth century, Columbus's bold vision eventually led to his historic voyage to the Americas.|"[""1.

Columbus had a mistaken belief about the distance to Asia, thinking it was closer to Europe than it actually was. He also underestimated the size of the Earth, making Asia seem much nearer. He believed Japan was only about 3,000 miles west of the Canary Islands, while in reality, it was over 12,000 miles away. Despite his calculations, Columbus faced challenges securing funding for his voyage. He sought help from various countries like Genoa, Portugal, and England, but it was Spain that eventually supported him. After the end of the war with the Moors in 1492, Queen Isabella promised Columbus the assistance he needed. Three ships, the Santa Maria, Pinta, and Niña, were prepared for the voyage to discover new trade routes.|"[""1.

In 1492, Columbus set out on a voyage from Palos, Spain, in small ships, preferring them for their ability to navigate close to shores and into smaller harbors. The expedition stopped at the Canary Islands for repairs before heading west. Despite initial fears of a volcanic eruption being a bad omen, the journey had fine weather. The sailors worried about the trade winds making their return difficult. As they sailed through a vast field of seaweed, they feared sea monsters and hidden rocks.

In 1492, Columbus made a remarkable discovery while sailing in the moonlit night. He saw a light moving along a shore, and soon, land was spotted by his crew. On October 12, they reached a small island which Columbus named San Salvador. The native people, whom Columbus thought were from the Indies, greeted them. The inhabitants were amazed by the white men, seeing them as gods. Columbus hoped to find gold and spices on the islands, but his search led him to Cuba and then to Española, where his ship was wrecked. Despite setbacks, Columbus remained determined to find the treasures he sought.|"['1.

Christopher Columbus prepared to return to Spain after leaving some sailors behind in Española due to lack of space on the Niña. Columbus captured ten Indians to bring back to Europe in hopes of teaching them Spanish and Christianity. Upon his return to Spain, he received honors and support for another voyage. In 1493, Columbus embarked on his second journey with 17 ships and 1500 men, aiming to reach China and the Spice Islands. Unaware of the new continents, he established a settlement in Española called Isabella. Columbus made two more voyages, reaching South America and Central America but never finding the route to Asia.

John Cabot, an Italian sailor working for England, set sail from Bristol in 1497 to explore new lands, just five years after Columbus found the West Indies. Cabot aimed to claim undiscovered islands for King Henry VII. With a small crew of 18 men on a ship similar in size to Columbus's _Niña_, Cabot sailed around Ireland and reached the coast of North America between Labrador and Nova Scotia. He found signs of human habitation but no people. Cabot's voyages, including a likely second one with his son Sebastian, were soon forgotten in England. Interestingly, the Americas were named after Americus Vespucius, an Italian who wrote about the New World, claiming it was more populous and pleasant than any other region. His writings spread widely due to the printing press, leading many to consider him the true discoverer of America.|"[""1.

Columbus believed he had found a new route to the Indies and thought the islands he encountered on the way were less significant. When he reached what we now know as South America, he didn't realize it was a new continent. The people of Europe were more familiar with Americus and his accomplishments than Columbus' discovery of the mainland. Eventually, a young scholar named Martin Waldseemüller proposed naming the newly discovered continent after Americus. This suggestion gained popularity, and the name America was widely adopted. Meanwhile, the Spaniards continued to refer to the new lands as the Indies. The exploration of the new world led to the realization that America was not part of Asia. Balboa, a settler in Española, ventured to the eastern border of Panama and discovered the Pacific Ocean in 1513 after a challenging journey through dense forests and rough terrains.|"['1.

Magellan's remarkable voyage was a pivotal moment in history, showcasing the earth's roundness practically. Sailing around the globe, Magellan revealed the existence of two vast oceans separating Europe and Asia, debunking the notion of a single ocean. He also unveiled that the newly discovered lands, known as the Americas, were distinct from Asia. The expedition's success, with one ship returning laden with valuable cloves, highlighted the lucrative trade routes sought by Europe. Magellan's journey, deemed the greatest voyage ever, demonstrated the earth's spherical nature, a concept long theorized by scholars.

The retreat of the Spaniards from Mexico resulted in significant losses. Cortés began the retreat with 1,250 soldiers, 6,000 Indian allies, and 80 horses but only had 500 soldiers, 2,000 allies, and 20 horses left by morning. Despite the heavy toll, Cortés remained resolute in his goal of conquering Mexico. After defeating the Indians in open combat, he successfully besieged the capital city. The following siege lasted nearly three months and was marked by relentless fighting and suffering among the natives. Cortés cut off the city's water supply, leading to famine and aiding the invaders. Eventually, the defenders were worn out, allowing Cortés to enter the city. It took him two years to conquer the Aztecs, and he then focused on rebuilding and transforming Mexico into New Spain, showcasing his prowess not just as a conqueror but also as a capable ruler in times of peace.|['1.

In the 16th century, emigrating from Spain to settle in Spanish America was a challenging task. Firstly, one needed the king's permission, proving a strong Catholic background free of heresy for three generations. Even the emigrant's wife had to consent, debts cleared, and foreigners were unwelcome. The sea voyage was perilous and expensive, lasting weeks or even months. Despite the hardships, the need for laborers in the colonies was high. While emigration was slow, many laborers went to the gold and silver mines due to the allure of wealth. Landowners resorted to Indian slavery as there were not enough white laborers. Europeans believed non-Christians could be enslaved, and the Spanish forced Indians to work their farms and mines.|['1.

Slavery was devastating for the West Indians, especially the native Indians who were unaccustomed to such hard labor. Overseers were harsh, leading to the rapid decline of the natives due to the brutal conditions and diseases brought by the white men. When the Indian population dwindled, slave-hunters turned to Africa for slaves. Bartholomew de Las Casas, the son of a companion of Columbus, became a priest and staunch advocate against Indian slavery. He successfully convinced King Charles V to abolish Indian slavery in 1542, but by then, the native population had drastically decreased. Las Casas, who initially supported replacing Indian slaves with African slaves, later regretted this decision as African slavery grew rapidly in the West Indies after Indian slavery was banned. Las Casas' efforts saved mainland Indians from a similar fate.|"['1.

The purpose of the mainland missions was to bring peace and Christianity to the native tribes. Las Casas, a missionary, demonstrated that kindness and education could achieve more than warfare. He and his fellow monks lived among the Indians, teaching them Christian values and helping them abandon their violent ways. The missions, or villages, established by the priests became centers of learning and industry. The Indians learned new skills, cultivated the land, and supported the church with their produce. The monks cared for the community, taught in schools, and maintained order. Over time, Spanish settlers joined the missions, creating a mixed society that adopted Spanish customs and religion. Las Casas' work influenced the Spaniards to shift from enslaving Indians to enslaving Africans, ultimately leading to a positive change in how the natives were treated.|"['1.

Ponce de Leon, a Spanish explorer, ventured into the unknown lands north of the Gulf of Mexico in search of a legendary fountain of youth. Despite not finding the fountain, he discovered a land abundant with flowers during the Easter season of 1513. Naming it Florida, he landed near present-day St. Augustine but tragically lost his life in a battle with the native Indians. Following his exploration, other Spanish adventurers scoured the Gulf and Atlantic coasts seeking a passage to India. De Soto, another renowned explorer, led an expedition through the southern United States, driven by tales of a land rich in gold ruled by a gilded king. With over six hundred men of noble descent, De Soto's journey through the south of North America began in 1539, uncovering new territories and encountering indigenous peoples along the way.|['1.

"In the spring, De Soto resumed his explorations, akin to an adventure deep into the heart of Africa. The expedition journeyed northeast through what is now Georgia and South Carolina, possibly reaching the North Carolina border. Passing through mountains, they headed southwest through Tennessee and Alabama until they reached a sizable Indian village called Mauvilla near the head of Mobile Bay. Mobile was named after this Indian village. The Alabama Indians, known as ""the thicket clearers,"" were close by. De Soto then altered his path northwest into the uncharted interior, facing numerous hardships along the way. His army faced exhaustion, cutting roads through thickets, creating paths through swamps, and fording rivers. They often had to halt for months to rest their horses and scavenge for food. De Soto's mistreatment of the native Indians, forcing them into slavery and using them for labor, led to hostility and battles. Eventually, they encountered the Mississippi River near present-day Memphis on May 8, 1541."|"[""1.

De Soto, a Spanish explorer, named the Rio Grande the Great River, but the Indians called it the Mississippi, a name now widely used by Americans. De Soto was the first white man to appreciate the significance of the Mississippi River. His expedition built boats to cross the river and journeyed through Arkansas, possibly reaching Oklahoma or Texas. Despite hardships, De Soto planned to establish a colony near the Red River but tragically succumbed to illness. His body was laid to rest in the Mississippi River to conceal his death from the Indians. The survivors sailed to Mexico, marking the end of a remarkable journey that expanded Spanish claims across several present-day states.

In 1539, the Viceroy of Mexico sent Friar Marcos, a missionary, on a quest to find the legendary Seven Cities. The Spaniards believed these cities were built by seven bishops who fled persecution in Spain and settled on an island far out in the Atlantic Ocean. Friar Marcos, along with a group, sought the Seven Cities, described as grand with stone houses. However, the friar never reached the cities as his companion, Stephen, was killed by the natives. The friar, too scared to proceed, only caught a glimpse of one of the cities from afar. The story of the Seven Cities spread, and an army was prepared for their conquest under Francisco de Coronado. Many wanted to join the expedition, trading for permits from the viceroy in hopes of finding great wealth.|"[""1.

Coronado embarked on his expedition in 1540 from western Mexico near the Gulf of California with an army of three hundred Spaniards, mostly noble sons. They were equipped with gleaming armor, lances, and swords, riding the finest horses. The army also included footmen armed with crossbows and harquebuses. A group of a thousand slaves and natives accompanied them as servants, tending to spare horses, carrying baggage, and herding livestock. After a challenging journey through the rugged terrain, Coronado reached the Seven Cities of Cibola, which turned out to be humble Indian pueblos in present-day New Mexico. Despite not finding riches, the explorers were captivated by the natural marvels they encountered, like the awe-inspiring Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, where they marveled at the sheer scale of the landscape.|"['1.

Coronado's expedition in New Mexico led him to settle for the winter in an Indian village near present-day Albuquerque. The soldiers lived comfortably, supplied with corn, beans, and fresh meat. However, Coronado demanded cloth from the natives, leading to tensions. An Indian slave told a tale of a fabulous city called Quivira to the northeast, sparking Coronado's search. After a long journey, they reached what is now central Kansas, finding Indian villages but no riches as promised.

Coronado's expedition in search of the Seven Cities led him to discover the southwest of the United States, including regions now part of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas. Despite the initial belief that the land was of little value, his explorations unveiled the Gulf of California and the Colorado River, proving that lower California was connected to the mainland. Coronado's journey and De Soto's exploration in North America nearly intersected, highlighting the vast Spanish frontier expansion.

During the early voyages to America and Asia, Spain and Portugal were in a race to claim new lands and trade routes. Spain, under explorers like Coronado, sought the Seven Cities of Cibola and Quivira in North America. Coronado hoped to find riches but only found simple villages and plains. He believed his discoveries were valuable, but they were not as grand as he had hoped. Meanwhile, the French, English, and Dutch were occupied with other endeavors, like fishing and trade, due to the challenges of navigating against prevailing winds in the North Atlantic. Spain and Portugal divided the world for exploration, but Spain's European conflicts hindered their ability to fully capitalize on their discoveries. Ultimately, the Spanish were surpassed by their European rivals in the exploration and colonization of the Americas.|"['1.

The English and French both wanted a piece of the riches of the Indies. The Portuguese's success drove them to seek their share. English and French sailors were not content with the Portuguese and Spanish claiming all the lands they discovered. They sought new routes to the East and claimed lands along the way. Rivalry led to conflicts. King Charles of Spain and King Francis of France were often at war due to territorial disputes. Religion also fueled strife in the 16th century. Discontent with the Church's practices led to the Reformation. Some began to question and interpret the Bible differently, leading to conflicts between Protestants and Catholics. The Reformation divided nations and sparked religious wars, weakening Spain's hold on its colonies.|"['1.

During the 16th century, significant religious leaders emerged in Europe. Ignatius Loyola, Reginald Pole, and Carlo Borromeo were prominent figures in the Roman Catholic Church. Loyola, a former soldier turned missionary, founded the Society of Jesus. On the Protestant side, Martin Luther and John Calvin were key figures. Luther, a German professor, translated the Bible into German and founded the Lutheran Church. Calvin, a Frenchman, settled in Geneva and led the French Huguenots. The Huguenots, followers of Calvin, faced persecution in France but gained support from nobles. Meanwhile, Philip II of Spain struggled to govern the Netherlands due to religious tensions. Many Netherlanders embraced Protestant teachings, leading to unrest and opposition against Philip's rule. The clash between differing religious beliefs and political control marked this era of European history.|"[""1.

"The Netherlands, also known as the Low Countries, have a unique geography where much of the land is below sea level. The Dutch people built dikes and pumped out water to reclaim the lower lands. William of Orange, a key figure, led the Dutch against Philip II, opposing his harsh rule. The Dutch were more accepting of new religious views, which led to a divide between the southern and northern Netherlanders. William, also called the ""Silent,"" was a strategic leader who became governor of three Dutch provinces.

Queen Elizabeth was a powerful ruler of England for forty-five years, a period considered by the English as their most glorious. During her reign, the English became skilled seafarers, challenging the Spaniards and exploring new lands like America. Trade flourished, and scholars delved into the works of Greek and Roman writers. This era saw the emergence of great literary works, like those of Shakespeare, making English a language to rival the classics. Meanwhile, in France during the reign of Francis I, Jacques Cartier embarked on expeditions to find a westward route to the Far East.

The colonists who settled in Fort Caroline faced challenges due to their misdeeds. Instead of farming for food, they wasted time seeking gold, robbing Spanish settlements, and lacking hunting and fishing skills. As a result, they resorted to digging roots for sustenance and faced starvation and attacks from angry Indians. In 1565, a relief expedition arrived with fresh settlers and supplies, offering hope for the struggling colony. However, the Spaniards, led by Menendez, viewed the French presence in Florida as a threat, leading to a confrontation.

In 1565, St. Augustine, the oldest town in the United States, was founded by the Spanish under Menendez. The town began with the Spaniards being welcomed by a friendly Indian chief who offered his dwelling, a large barn-like structure made of tree trunks and thatched with palmetto leaves. The soldiers quickly fortified the area by digging a ditch and building a breastwork. The French, stationed at Fort Caroline, prepared to attack St. Augustine, but a storm wrecked their fleet. Menendez took advantage of the chaos, marched to Fort Caroline, and defeated the French. The French survivors, shipwrecked and seeking help, were captured by Menendez and tragically put to death.

The religious conflicts in England escalated, with plots to assassinate Queen Elizabeth and put Mary of Scotland on the throne. Encouraged by Philip and the Pope's excommunication, England was inevitably drawn into the Netherlands conflict. English trade flourished, with merchants expanding to new markets and creating innovative goods. The English navy grew, with ships like _The Triumph_ equipped with advanced weaponry. Francis Drake, a skilled seaman and popular sea-captain, emerged as a key figure. Drake, along with his cousin John Hawkins, engaged in slave-trading voyages to Africa, supplying slaves to Spanish planters in the West Indies.

WHY DRAKE DISLIKED THE SPANIARDS. The Spanish king wanted to control the slave trade and stop English slavers from trading with the West Indies. Spanish warships ruined a voyage that Hawkins and Drake hoped would bring big profits, leading Drake to hate the Spaniards. THE DRAGON OF THE SEAS. During this time, Drake's fellow Englishmen shared his strong dislike for the Spaniards. English and Spanish traders clashed at sea, with the English targeting Spanish settlements in America. Drake, known as the Dragon of the Seas, ambushed Spanish ships carrying gold and silver to Spain from America. DRAKE'S VENTURE. Drake planned to plunder treasure ships in the Pacific Ocean with a fleet of five ships, but only his ship, the Golden Hind, survived the journey after facing storms and challenges.

Sir Francis Drake, a renowned English sea-captain, cleverly outsmarted Spanish warships tracking him as he voyaged around the world. His bold journey took him along the coast of California, possibly reaching Oregon and Washington, and onwards to the Philippines and the Spice Islands before returning home via the Cape of Good Hope. Queen Elizabeth knighted Drake for his daring exploits against the Spaniards, earning him the title Sir Francis Drake. Meanwhile, the Dutch fiercely resisted Spanish forces, with the siege of Leyden becoming legendary for the daring flood that saved the city. Despite King Philip's attempts to eliminate Dutch leader William of Orange, the Dutch continued their struggle, supported by English troops.

"In 1588, the Spanish king aimed to conquer England through the ""Invincible Armada,"" a mighty fleet. However, Sir Francis Drake's attack on Cadiz delayed the Armada's voyage. When the Armada reached the English Channel, the Spanish ships, though larger, were slow, allowing the English to outmaneuver and attack them effectively. The English ships, equipped with heavy cannons, dealt a severe blow to the Armada. In the narrow waters near Dover and Calais, the English intensified their assault, sinking Spanish vessels. A fierce storm then forced the remaining Armada ships to flee towards the North Sea, with many meeting a tragic end on the rocky coasts. Only a fraction of the proud Spanish fleet returned home. This defeat marked the end of Spain's attempts to conquer England, as the country had depleted its resources for the failed Armada.

Interest in the New World was sparked in England by voyages like those of Sir Francis Drake. Prior to this, even the discoveries of Columbus and the Cabots failed to excite the English about exploring and settling in the Americas. The English were preoccupied with the power struggle between their monarchs and the popes over control of the English Church. This changed during Queen Elizabeth's reign. Sea-captains, inspired by Drake's success, set sail for the Americas. Many targeted the West Indies for plunder from Spanish ships. Some explored North America to find regions untouched by the Spanish. Martin Frobisher sought the Northwest Passage, while Drake attempted a western route in 1579. Humphrey Gilbert had a grand plan to establish settlements in the New World, supported by Queen Elizabeth. English sailors like Drake despised the Spaniards, and Drake's method of living involved seizing Spanish ships. The English were victorious against the Spanish Armada due to various factors. King Philip II of Spain attempted to conquer England to assert his control, leading to the famous battle fought against the Armada.

Gilbert's attempts to establish a colony near the Gulf of St. Lawrence failed due to mishaps, desertion, and shipwrecks. Sir Walter Raleigh, his half-brother, was part of the failed expedition in 1578. Queen Elizabeth prevented Raleigh from joining the disastrous second attempt in 1583. Gilbert's supply of toys to please the natives did not help. The second expedition in 1583 faced desertions and shipwrecks, leading to the abandonment of settling in the harsh environment. Gilbert's return journey on the small vessel _Squirrel_ ended tragically when it sank during a storm. Raleigh, inspired by Gilbert's vision, sought to establish English colonies in North America.

The English settlers brought back exciting tales of the land. They were especially impressed by Roanoke Island in Pamlico Sound, admiring the lush grapevines, towering cedar trees, and abundant wildlife. The gentle and welcoming Native Americans left a lasting impression. Queen Elizabeth I was so delighted by the reports that she named the region Virginia after herself and knighted Sir Walter Raleigh. John White led a famous colony to Virginia in 1587, focusing on farming rather than seeking gold. The settlers, including 25 women and children, settled on Roanoke Island, where they found the old fort in ruins. They rebuilt huts and welcomed the first English child born in the New World, Virginia Dare.

The Spanish colonies in America flourished with over two hundred cities and towns established by the Spaniards. They brought about two hundred thousand settlers from Spain to America, and five million Indians lived under their rule, adopting Christianity and Spanish culture. Additionally, one hundred and forty thousand African slaves were brought to work in the plantations and mines. The City of Mexico, similar to Spanish cities, boasted well-built houses, churches, schools, hospitals, and public buildings. Despite their success, Spain faced challenges due to conflicts with other nations, leading to a decline in the growth of their colonies. The intermingling of Spaniards, Africans, and Indians gave rise to a new population, the Spanish Americans.

"Queen Elizabeth was willing to grant Gilbert twelve hundred miles of territory in North America. This vast stretch of land along the Atlantic coast was unclaimed by the French and the Spaniards. After a century of discovery and exploration (1492-1600), the English, French, Portuguese, and Spaniards had claimed regions in the New World and the East. The Greeks learned various skills that they brought to Italy. The Romans, in turn, carried their knowledge to Spain, Gaul, and Britain. The Spaniards, French, and English continued to learn and carry their knowledge to Spanish America and North America. A map of the world today can show the colonies of these countries. For further reading, there are recommended books like Holm's ""History of the Greeks"" and Bury's ""A History of Greece,"" among others, to explore the rich history of these civilizations."|"['1.
