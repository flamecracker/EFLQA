Dolly and Bessie encountered a mysterious gypsy caravan while exploring the woods. The girls were drawn to a tent where the secrets of the future were said to be revealed. Inside, they met a young gypsy girl sewing beads on a jacket. Despite Dolly's curiosity to explore more, Bessie insisted they leave.

Reflecting on the encounter, Bessie explained to Dolly that the gypsies have different customs and may act impulsively.

Eleanor decided to speak with the guides and ensure they kept a close eye on Loon Pond, Bessie. This reassured Bessie, who had been feeling nervous about the gypsies lingering nearby.

Bessie heard that Peter, a close friend, was on his way. She knew Peter and the captor were close, like brothers. Trying to escape now would only lead to Peter finding them, risking punishment. Bessie decided to wait. She hurried up a rough path pointed by Lolla, leaving her as a guard below. Bessie was hopeful that she was getting closer to finding Dolly. She kept a keen eye and ear out for any clue. As she reached the end of the trail, she saw a peak with a breathtaking view. Bessie quickly scanned the area but found no sign of Dolly nearby.

Bessie bravely left Dolly tied to a tree, promising to return with help soon. She knew the gypsy girl, Lolla, was trying to warn her of danger. Bessie hurried back up the rocky peak, hearing Peter's gypsy tune as he passed by. With courage, she descended the treacherous rocks, clinging to bushes and rocks for support. Despite the fear of being pursued, Bessie focused on reaching the bottom safely. She didn't look back, afraid that knowing the danger behind her would make the descent even more terrifying.

Bessie was in a difficult situation. She worried about Peter recognizing her connection to Dolly and the dangers that came with it. As she descended the steep peak, she found a path that offered some relief. Lost in the woods, she pondered her next move, hoping to find Lolla for guidance. Following a trail, she crossed paths with Lolla, relieved to see her safe. Bessie expressed her fears of Peter's intentions and was grateful for Lolla's escape.

""Of course, I know these woods,"" chuckled Lolla. ""I've set traps here for partridges and rabbits countless times without the guides noticing. You knew your way, right?

Lolla and Bessie were in a predicament. Dolly was tied up and gagged, and they needed to rescue her. Lolla had a plan to save Dolly, even if it meant going against the guides. Bessie was hesitant, but Lolla assured her she knew what to do. They headed towards the camp to check on John's whereabouts. Lolla believed that if Peter was left in charge of Dolly, their plan would be easier. Bessie questioned Lolla's loyalty to a man who mistreated her, but Lolla defended him, believing he would provide for her and discipline her if needed.

Bessie soon found herself completely lost, like in a maze. However, Lolla seemed confident in her path. She navigated through trails effortlessly, even taking shortcuts through unmarked parts of the forest with ease. Bessie, who knew Hedgeville well, was amazed at Lolla's familiarity with the area.

""I heard them two or three minutes ago,"" said Lolla, smiling. ""Stay here, hide behind that clump of bushes. I will go ahead and see what I can find. Even if it is some of your friends, they wouldn't suspect me.""

Bessie followed Lolla's plan and rushed down to free Dolly from the cords that bound her. Lolla had tricked Peter by appealing to his stomach, and Bessie marveled at her cunning. As Bessie cut the cords, she was shocked to realize that she had been completely outsmarted by the gypsies. Despite her trust in Lolla, she had been deceived.

Bessie was dismayed by the news. If they had arrived just five minutes earlier, they would have been safe. Despite this, she had an idea and called out for help.
