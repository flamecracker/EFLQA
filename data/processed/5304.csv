"Last spring, I received a special letter that deeply touched me. The writer had a question about the robin in ""The Secret Garden."" They believed I owned the original robin, but in reality, he owned me. This English robin was no ordinary bird; he was a charming little creature with a red satin waistcoat, a curious nature, and a captivating presence. He lived in my rose garden in Kent, a mystical place surrounded by old brick walls and a lush laurel hedge. The robin and I shared a unique bond, as he saw me as one of his own kind. By remaining still and embracing the essence of a robin, I could attract him with my tender presence. Our friendship was a valuable lesson in nature's beauty and the joy of connecting with the world around us."|"['1.

I wish I could recall how long it took before I realized he was truly a robin. One morning while tending to my roses, he appeared without warning. His breast showed the first hint of a tawny flush, evolving into a bright red satin waistcoat. His movements became more confident, making little flights and sounds. He would perch nearby, engaging in our silent conversations. I showered him with praise, which he adored. One sunny day, as I talked to him by the roses, he flew up and landed on my hat, exploring the flowers. From then on, our bond grew stronger. He would perch close to me, listen to my whispers, and even try to read my writing. He became a cherished companion, always appearing magically and disappearing into the sky.|"[""1.

"During the entire summer, the most captivating sight was the robin that visited my rose garden. Some speculated he might not be an ordinary bird but a fairy. Visitors were eager to meet him, often referring to him as ""The Robin."" One guest even dubbed him ""The Goblin Robin"" for his uncanny charm. This special robin had a human-like quality that enchanted everyone. He was exceptionally polite and would join me when called, but he had a unique bond with me. One day, as I sat writing under a shaded umbrella, he surprised me by perching on it and singing his first beautiful song. His singing improved over time, and he would serenade me with delightful melodies, showcasing his growing pride and talent. His playful antics and captivating songs made it impossible to resist his charm, leaving me in awe of his beauty and grace."|[]|[]
Could it be that he was guilty--when he met other robins--of boasting of his conquest of me and of my utter subjugation? I cannot believe it possible. Also, I never saw other robins accost him or linger in their passage through the rose-garden to exchange civilities. And yet a very strange thing occurred on one occasion. I was sitting at my table expecting him and heard a familiar chirp. When I looked up, he was atilt upon the branch of an apple tree nearby. I greeted him with little whistles and twitters, thinking, of course, that he would fly down to me for our usual conversation. But though he chirped a reply and put his head on one side engagingly, he did not move from his bough. But he did not come. He only sidled and twittered and stayed where he was. This was so extraordinary that I got up and went to him. As I looked, a curious doubt came upon me. He looked like Tweetie--(which had become his baptismal name) he tilted his head and flirted and twittered after the manner of Tweetie--but--could it be that he was NOT what he pretended to be? Could he be a stranger bird? That seemed out of the question, as no stranger bird would have comported himself with such familiarity. No stranger surely would have come so near and addressed me with such intimate twitterings and well-known airs and graces|"['1.

"His anger was intense and frightening. I was scared and felt pale. I tried to calm him using the cunning ways that noble women sometimes need to use.

In the summer, a robin thought the rose-garden was his whole world, always appearing from different spots when called. But in late autumn, I saw him fly from beyond a wall, looking guilty. He seemed to have found there was more beyond the garden but still cherished our bond. Even when the estate was sold, and I had to leave for Montreux, he stayed close. Upon my return, the garden was white with snow. I called, unsure if he would remember me after months away. To my delight, a scarlet flash appeared, and my robin landed by my feet, showing our bond was strong despite the time apart.|"['1.
