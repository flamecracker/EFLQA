As the young group stepped outside and shut the door behind them on the empty house, Betty felt a surge of sympathy. Leaving the old man alone seemed wrong, but they had done all they could. The soldier walked them to the road. Grateful for his help, the girls drove home, leaving Wesley Travers watching them thoughtfully. He thought they were nice, especially the brown-haired one.

On a sunny day, two friends, Betty and Grace, embarked on a car journey to Wild Rose Lodge. Grace admired the wild roses along the way while Betty drove with excitement.

Grace checked her watch and realized it was past noon, making her hungry from riding since ten. She hoped Wild Rose Lodge had food. Betty mentioned Mollie's Uncle John stocking the cabin with canned goods for a week. Passing a farmhouse, they noticed chickens crossing the road. Suddenly, Mollie's car horn blared, and she had stopped. Grace looked back to see the car stopped. Betty joked about managing to get fresh food. Curious, they went to Mollie and found her excited about blackberries. Grace craved steak. Mollie suggested picking berries and making a pudding for supper. They heard a rustling noise, hinting at something approaching through the bushes.|"[""1.

"""Let's see what's causing the noise,"" Mrs. Irving said, trying to hide her nervousness. ""We have enough berries for our pudding.""
