In the valley of Horlingdal, Ulf and Haldor lived with their families surrounded by towering mountains covered in dark pines and birch trees.

"During ancient times, the Norsemen valued their right to participate in the government. The democratic element was crucial in deciding important matters.

However, a sudden thunderous crash interrupted his departure as a massive rock tumbled down the mountain.

Erling knelt beside Hilda, trying to stop her bleeding, relieved that she was alive. He worried about the old man's fate. In Norway, a parliament called the Thing conferred sovereignty, and the King needed each Law Thing's approval. Hilda sent Ada to the hayfield and later Ada coincidentally met Glumm. Ada teased Glumm about his sword's antics, and he confessed to feeling ill-tempered due to news of Danish vikings led by Skarpedin the Red. Glumm suggested a walk with Ada to lift his spirits, revealing his concern over the vikings' threat.|"['**Question 1:**\nWhat was Erling doing beside Hilda?\nA) Trying to start a fire\nB) Trying to stop her bleeding\nC) Looking for food\nD) Sleeping\nE) Playing with his sword', '**Question 2:**\nWhat was the parliament in Norway called that conferred sovereignty?\nA) The Council\nB) The Assembly\nC) The Parliament\nD) The Court\nE) The Thing', '**Question 3:**\nWho did Hilda send to the hayfield?\nA) Erling\nB) Glumm\nC) Ada\nD) The old man\nE) Skarpedin', '**Question 4:**\nWhy did Glumm feel ill-tempered according to the passage?\nA) Because of the rain\nB) Because of a broken sword\nC) Because of news of Danish vikings\nD) Because of a lost treasure\nE) Because of a lost pet', ""**Question 5:**\nWhat did Ada tease Glumm about?\nA) His horse\nB) His cooking skills\nC) His sword's antics\nD) His singing voice\nE) His clothing"", '**Question 6:**\nWhy did Glumm suggest a walk with Ada?\nA) To go fishing\nB) To find a new sword\nC) To lift his spirits\nD) To avoid the Danish vikings\nE) To buy some hay']"|"['** B) Trying to stop her bleeding', '** E) The Thing', '** C) Ada', '** C) Because of news of Danish vikings', ""** C) His sword's antics"", '** C) To lift his spirits']"
Ada and Glumm approached the field where Haldor, his son, and Ulf were busy gathering hay. Hilda joined them, and Glumm, trying to impress Ada, acted unusually polite towards Hilda. Ada noticed this and became jealous, while Erling the Bold, who was watching, grew cross. Despite their efforts to hide it, jealousy brewed between the friends. The different classes in Norway were explained: the masters, unfreemen, and thralls. The masters were freeholders with no superior lord, the unfreemen were freed slaves, and the thralls were slaves with no rights. The day went on with everyone working hard to gather the hay before the weather turned. The men wore leather shoes and caps, while the udallers were dressed in finer garments adorned with gold and silver from viking raids. As the sun set, the work was nearly done, and Ulf and Haldor chatted in the field.|"[""1.

Ulf of Romsdal, Haldor the Fierce, and Erling stood together, showing little change in appearance despite the passing years. Ulf remained strong with black hair and a straight figure, while Haldor, now covered in fair hair, still had a bright eye and hearty laugh. Nearby, the thrall Kettle Flatnose worked energetically, known for his red hair, humor, and strength. Ulf praised Kettle's hard work, allowing him to earn his freedom through labor. Kettle, a former chief, worked diligently, almost earning his freedom. Ulf feared losing Kettle once he was free due to his unsettled spirit.

Kettle quickly picked up a large round stone and threw it ahead. Haldor, with more finesse, threw the stone even farther. Glumm, eager to show off, threw the stone but fell short. Frustrated, Glumm tried again but only managed to beat the thrall's throw by an inch. Ada, watching anxiously, hoped he would succeed. Erling, trying to maintain his credit, threw the stone, but as he glanced at Hilda, it flew far beyond everyone's mark, breaking his sword in the process.

Glumm felt embarrassed and remained speechless. The attention of the group shifted to a man running towards them, leaping over obstacles. He handed a baton to Ulf, urging him to hurry to King Harald's assembly. The message was clear - the split arrow meant war preparations, while the baton indicated a civil meeting. Ulf sought a swift messenger, and Alric, a mischievous boy, volunteered. The crowd dispersed, discussing the urgent task ahead.

Erling rushed to the house while the man blew life into the forge's fire. He shed his jerkin, rolled up his sleeves, and vigorously worked on the axe he had paused earlier. In just thirty minutes, the axe was ready for its haft. Choosing a flawless, thick haft from a corner, he skillfully attached it to the iron head. Next, he focused on a massive two-handed sword made for his friend Glumm. The polished sword gleamed in the forge's light. Erling, with a grim smile, added final touches, pondering its deadly potential. Herfrida, his mother, entered, dressed in a blue cloak and scarlet kirtle. She chuckled at Erling's contradictory nature, finding humor in his love for peace despite his warlike skills.

"""Herfrida bade farewell to her son Erling, kissing his forehead before leaving him in the forge. Erling, clad in magnificent armor, stood pensively by the fire. His attire included a leather tunic covered in steel rings, a broad belt with silver ornaments, and a two-edged sword. Leather leggings and untanned shoes protected his lower limbs. A burnished steel helmet with hawk's wings and a large shield completed his gear. Erling also carried an enormous axe, a short bow, and a quiver of arrows.

Erling the Brave positioned himself at a table, keeping watch on the door, ready to leave unnoticed. He anticipated his brother's return with news of the vikings. When Alric arrived, he was soaked and frantic. Alric led Erling to a man with a bleeding forehead who shared the news of Skarpedin the Dane's attack. Skarpedin sought revenge for a past raid by Norsemen. The Northmen's custom of plundering coasts led to Skarpedin's ruthless attack on Swart's home, resulting in destruction and bloodshed. The vikings' brutal actions were common during their summer raids. Skarpedin's arrival with longships and warriors led to a fierce battle where Swart and his men fought valiantly but were ultimately defeated. Swart's home was left in ruins as he and a few survivors fled to the mountains, wounded and seeking safety.|"['1.

Swart rested briefly before setting off towards Horlingdal. He ran along the coast and spotted a Danish warship. Meanwhile, Erling's brother Alric, unaware of the danger, came down the gorge. The vikings noticed Alric and rowed closer to shore. The leader, a red-haired man, waited for Alric on the cliffs. Alric, facing a real foe for the first time, was terrified but summoned courage. The Viking demanded Alric to guide them to Ulfstede and Haldorstede. Alric, with newfound bravery, shot an arrow at the Viking's throat. The Viking dodged, but the arrow hit him.|"['1.

Erling suspected his brother Erling was planning a reckless attack on the Danes with a crew of only sixty men against six hundred. Knowing the odds were against them, Erling devised a plan to save his headstrong brother. When Erling pursued his brother, Alric, he escaped into a cave. Erling's longship, the Swan, was gaudily painted with a figurehead of a swan and shields hanging along the gunwales. Despite a valiant effort, Erling's crew couldn't catch the vikings' boat. Instead, Erling led his crew to a stream mouth, where they landed and prepared for battle. As the Danes approached, Erling strategically positioned his men among the rocks, using stones to hinder the enemy's advance.

Christian and Alric both rose to the challenge. Christian, despite his age, still had strength and determination. Alric, fueled by his recent success in battle and the belief that he was the only capable fighter in Ulfstede, was eager to prove himself. The hermit, recognizing the urgency of the situation, quickly secured the doors and armed himself. Alric struggled to close one of the doors, but Christian arrived just in time to help. As Danish vikings approached, Alric used a clever tactic involving rye-flour to temporarily blind some of the attackers. With the hermit's assistance, they successfully defended the house. Alric even managed to shoot an arrow at one of the vikings through a slit in the roof. The attackers, momentarily deterred, regrouped outside. The defenders fortified their position and prepared for the next onslaught. Finn, an aging warrior, suggested using fire to repel the attackers, showing that experience and strategy were just as crucial as strength in this intense situation.|"[""1.

In the midst of the intense battle, the hermit displayed remarkable skill with his bow, swiftly sending an arrow through the hand of his foe, causing the Vikings to retreat into the safety of the woods. Christian, joined by Ivor and Finn, emphasized the importance of doing tasks thoroughly, citing a passage that stresses giving one's best effort. Finn, noticing movement in the woods, urged Christian to demonstrate his accuracy with the bow once more. As the Vikings fled, a cry of conflict echoed from the fiord. Alric, acting swiftly, aimed an arrow at a fleeing Dane, but the shield on the Dane's back deflected the shot. As the tension mounted, Ulf, Erling, and Haldor burst into the hall, concerned for the hermit's well-being.

The women quickly prepared to care for the wounded and those who survived the recent battle. Meanwhile, the hermit was taken to Ulf's bed, and his wound, less severe than feared, was tended to by Hilda, with Erling assisting. Time was short for the men of Horlingdal after the battle, as armed Thingsmen gathered, and news of King Harald's threat loomed. A District Thing was urgently called for.

At this point, Ivor the Old arose and gave his opinion that the King should be brought off his high horse soon.

Hilda and Ada had planned to walk together up the dale, but their lovers, Glumm and Erling, coincidentally met them on the only road. The encounter happened in a scenic part of the dale between two high cliffs. Ada cleverly engaged Erling in conversation about a sword-belt, while Hilda did the same with Glumm. The pairs separated briefly as Ada and Erling discussed armor details, leaving Hilda and Glumm to exchange awkward, one-sided conversation. Eventually, the group reached a path that led to Glummstede, where Erling and Glumm decided to settle their differences through combat. They rode up the mountain path in silence, each feeling indignant towards the other.

Glumm and Erling were engaged in a heated conversation about their affections for Ada and Hilda. Glumm, convinced of Ada's love for Erling, advised his friend to show indifference towards Ada to win her over.

Erling and Glumm approached a distressed woman, but she seemed lost in her sorrow. Erling gently touched her and spoke kindly, but she remained distant until a tear fell from his eye. Overwhelmed, she looked up and pleaded for mercy for the last remaining loved one. Erling offered help and a token for shelter, but the woman feared leaving. Despite the urgency, Erling ensured she was cared for before urging her to Horlingdal. He shared food and advised her to seek refuge at Haldorstede. Erling pondered the hermit's words about war, considering different perspectives. He contemplated embarking on a journey to learn from other nations but felt a mysterious hesitation.

At this time, King Harald was on a conquest to subdue Norway. He was a fierce warrior and had created Earls to rule over districts. Jarl Rongvold, a dear friend of the King, was one of these Earls. King Harald, upon hearing of a meeting of small kings opposing him, took swift action. He burnt down the meeting place and defeated four kings and their followers. He continued his conquest, subduing various regions and making people swear allegiance to him. King Harald's rule was marked by fire and sword, swiftly bringing submission or extinction. Despite his harsh methods, he appointed Earls to administer justice and collect dues. Harald Fairhair was known for his handsome appearance, strength, generosity, and affability. When Erling and Glumm sought an audience with the King, they were met with a heavily guarded compound, indicating the King's readiness for any threat.|"[""1.

Erling, with a determined expression, stated that Harald, though not yet an all-powerful king, needed to hear the sentiments of the men of Horlingdal. Rongvold advised Erling to approach the King humbly, warning that it's wiser to go with the flow than against it. Despite Erling's resolve, Rongvold offered him a promising future if he joined them. The jarl led Erling and Glumm to the King's hall, where Harald sat gazing out the window. Erling boldly expressed the objections of the men of Horlingdal to the King's rule.

Erling tried to sway Rolf to their cause, but Rolf declined, believing their cause was futile. Their conversation broke the ice between them. Jarl Rongvold interrupted, summoning Erling to the King.

"""I see thou hast discovered my secret,"" said Glumm, looking at his little friend with a somewhat confused expression, ""though how the knowledge came to thee is past my understanding. Yet as thou art so clever a warlock I would fain know what ye mean about `Ada's love for me.' Hadst thou said her hatred, I could have believed thee without explanation.""

The path they followed was broad at that part, and not quite so rugged, so Alric could walk alongside his stout friend as he related the incident enlightening him about Ada's feelings towards her lover. It was clear from the expression on the Norseman's face that his soul was rejoiced at the discovery, and he strode forward at such a pace that the boy had to call a halt.

""Out upon thee for a stupid monster!"" said the boy; ""have I not just proved that my experience is very deep? I have not got the length thou hast--of wandering about like a poor ghost or a half-witted fellow, but I have seen enough to know what common sense says.""

Glumm, in response, whispered to Alric to keep in the lower end of the gorge while he checked the upper end for the wolf. The hunters had reached a wild, deep fissure near the summit of a high ridge, almost six thousand feet high, with steep rocky sides narrowing to six feet where Alric stood. The wolf's track led directly through the pass into the gorge, and Alric"|"[""1.

In the olden days, bravery wasn't just about boldness but also about knowledge. Familiarity with danger often breeds courage. Alric, accustomed to peril, faced a fierce wolf with calmness. On the other end, Glumm tracked the wolf to the mountains. After a confusing trail, he spotted the wolf's ears and confirmed its presence. As the wolf approached, Glumm swiftly moved towards it, causing the wolf to pause in uncertainty. With bristles raised, the wolf displayed fury. Glumm advanced cautiously, spear ready. The wolf, reluctant to retreat, dashed up the cliff. With the agility of a panther, Glumm blocked its path. The wolf, intimidated, turned and fled, pursued by Glumm with a triumphant cry.|"['1.

Alric heard the growl, alerting him to the danger. He readied his spear as a wolf charged towards him. With a swift move, he thrust the spear into the wolf's chest, felling the beast. Glumm, impressed, praised Alric's bravery. The boy, now a man in spirit, felt a sense of triumph. As winter faded into spring in Norway, Alric and his companions prepared for new adventures. King Harald Fairhair tasked Hauskuld with a mission to quell rebellion in Horlingdal. Hauskuld, a brave warrior, was to confront a defiant man gathering forces against the king. Despite the delay in the king's plans, Hauskuld was to lead a small team to deal with the threat.

"""Sire, you are considerate,"" said Hauskuld. ""But this foster-brother of mine I count an enemy, for reasons that I need not tell.

If you will permit me, I will gladly go on this errand, and as this Atli is a stout man, it would be well to take Hake and a few of the berserkers along with me.""

The King turned quickly round, with a look of anger, and fixed a searching glance on the huge form of Rolf Ganger, who stood leaning on the hilt of his sword with a quiet, almost contemptuous smile on his face.

""I go to prepare myself for the fight, King Harald,"" returned Rolf, ""but I have no occasion to give thee further proof of friendship. The world is wide enough for us both.

The relentless fire outside was matched by the circling enemy. Arrows whizzed, piercing some and leaving many dead. Some charged into the flames, while others fought fiercely, only to be pushed back or met with a violent end. Not one of those attacked managed to break through. Atli and his followers met their end there. It's chilling to think such terrible acts were committed. Even more chilling is knowing that the spirit behind such atrocities still lingers in the hearts of men today. Modern warfare history reveals that unregenerate man is still capable of such deeds. Hauskuld swiftly left the scene after his mission, learning of secret preparations to resist the King. Upon returning, he found King Harald celebrating a heathen feast. Despite the tense situation, the King surprisingly treated the news lightly, even jesting about it.|"['1.

The King spoke aloud, and while the berserk was drinking, he turned to converse with Hakon of Drontheim. However, Hakon had left, so the King spoke to a courtier about the news from the south. The King expressed concern for Hakon's daughter Ada and offered to warn her family of the impending danger. Hakon agreed to provide aid and informed them that Rolf Ganger might also join. Gunhild left secretly to deliver the message. Meanwhile, King Harald was engrossed in festivities, appearing carefree to most but causing concern to Jarl Rongvold. Sacrificial festivals were being celebrated, and the King offered to cover the costs, winning favor with the people.

"The poet sat with the lively confidence of someone who believes he has spoken well and anticipates a positive reception. His expectations were met as the revelers erupted in cheers, shouting ""Victory to the King!"" This was precisely what the King desired, and he nurtured the enthusiasm sparked by the poet.

Thorer and Kettle were discussing their past adventures when Kettle shared a tale of a viking raid in Valland. They encountered a castle defended by surly men, leading to a siege. Despite failed attempts to breach the castle, a clever idea emerged. Guttorm's nephew suggested making wings like birds to fly over the walls.

Old Guttorm had a clever but foiled plan to use birds to set the castle on fire. He ordered cords tied to the birds with bits of wood set on fire. The birds were meant to fly back to their nests in the castle's thatch, igniting the roofs. However, the men in the castle caught on and scared the birds away. Next, they dug a tunnel under the castle to surprise the men inside. When they tried to attack, a stone fell, revealing their plan. They fought but had to retreat when the tunnel collapsed.

Early the next day, at dawn, the enemy led the prisoner to the castle's wall. There, they beheaded him and cut his body into four pieces, hurling them down to us with scornful cries. After this, Guttorm Stoutheart seemed to lose his courage. He gathered his key men and declared his impending death, wishing to be left alone. He retired to his tent, allowing only his nephew to approach. A week later, we learned that Guttorm was dying and requested to be buried within the castle grounds, now known to be consecrated Christian land. The priests agreed to the burial, provided two of Guttorm's kin accompanied the body, unarmed, to the burial spot near the main gate. The priests, dressed in black, conducted the burial ceremony. As they carried the coffin back into the castle, a scuffle ensued, and Guttorm emerged from the coffin, initiating a fierce battle that resulted in the castle being overtaken by Guttorm's forces."|"['1.

Haldor had already chosen a small group of men and returned with the women, while Erling and his men hurried ahead. They soon reached the edge of the woods near Haldorstede. The old place was now a smoking ruin, with many men trying to put out the fire. The man who started the fire paid with his life, seen hanging from a nearby tree. Harald Fairhair had just arrived with a large force of men. Erling realized attacking openly with only fifty men was futile. He led his men silently to a cliff where they could observe without being seen. The leaders decided to wait and send a spy to find the girls. The hermit suggested using a boat at Crow Cliff to help the maidens escape safely. The hermit disappeared quietly into the underwood, leaving Erling and his men with a plan to rescue the girls.|"['1.

Erling quickly communicated the plan to his friends Ulf and Glumm. They were to guide the girls down the rapids in a boat while the men swam alongside. Their destination was a cave on the coast where they would regroup. However, their plan was disrupted when they saw the hermit and the girls unknowingly heading towards King Harald's men.

Hilda bravely pleaded for the hermit's life, as he had saved hers twice and had never harmed anyone. King Harald agreed to spare the hermit but challenged him to have a champion come to his aid.

The crew swiftly followed orders. The strongest men grasped the oars, led by Erling, Kettle, and Haldor. Thorer assumed the helm, directing Glumm to follow suit. The Swan's stern lifted high above the water, propelled forward by the rowers' intense efforts. As the ship surged ahead, leaving a frothy wake, unoccupied men rushed to the forecastle, balancing it on the boom. When the bow dipped, the vessel slid into the sea. A shout from their pursuers prompted Erling to backwater, rescuing survivors from a rival ship's wreckage. Amidst the chaos, Glumm and Ada were saved. The Swan swiftly sailed away, evading capture.
