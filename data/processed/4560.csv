"Dear child, do not appear so pale. I am not speaking wildly. Oh, you have not heard the tale. Climb onto the bed there: Sit near and listen. After today, I will not share stories with you anymore. How old are you, my dear? Almost twelve? Almost a grown-up? Your mother was barely older when she had you, and I was not much older when I left my home to marry in May. You know the house by St. Andrea's church, dark and grand, overlooking the bustling Mercato; adorned with lilies and shields above the door, and a small balcony reaching for the sun. That was my playground as a child; where I played with Antonio Rondinelli, a relative. Happy times we had, until they said, ""You must marry."" I asked, ""What is marriage?"" and with that, I accepted the garland, smiled at the jewels around my neck, and was led away by my solemn husband. The years that followed were long and sunless, save for glimpses of Antonio passing by, with eyes filled with love. Were we at fault? Our lives had intertwined for so long. We were allowed to sow the seeds of love, only to have them torn apart without care. I loved Antonio, and he loved me. Life was shadowed, but not sinful.

It was a dark time for me, sitting alone in the shadows while others enjoyed the light, hearing discord while they sang. I felt so young, like I had never truly lived. I endured silently, like many women do, until my soul rebelled against my flesh. With a fierce determination, I broke free from the grip of death, tearing through the earth. They said it was a fever, but I had been dead for so long, I couldn't tell the difference. Oil on my skin, burial clothes wrapped around me, they placed me in a tomb among the buried. The tomb, rich and terrifying, where the echoes of my ancestors' coffins filled the air. With a burst of strength, I escaped, unsure if I was alive or dead. Lost in the night, guided by a cold moon, I found myself at my husband's door, seeking warmth and comfort. But instead of solace, I was met with fear and rejection. Weeping, I turned towards my family's home, hoping for love and acceptance, only to be met with cowardice and rejection. My own kin turned me away, trembling in fear. Rejected and alone, I wandered, pleading for mercy and a place to belong.|"[""1.

"How can I win her heart? What can a strong arm achieve against such a gentle distance? All I can say is that when she stands by the doves near the shady waterway, and I gaze at her with longing, sometimes she smiles. Maybe one day she will do more than just smile! She has said ""yes,"" and the world seems enchanted. As we sit together, the Angelus bells ring in the distance, and the sunset lingers to listen to their melody, for the sunset adores such music. A large, bright moon hangs low in the sky, casting a warm glow like the heart of a red shell. The Lido drifts like a purple flower, with sails of orange and rose on the sea. The waves crash in silk and pink hues, creating a perfect moment that envelops us, my love and me. Is there any sadness in the world tonight? Or tears and sighs under this festive moon and sky? Can there be memories or despair? What troubles you, my love? Why do you point there, with sudden dew in your eyes? Yes, one sad thing amidst the joyous earth! Like a mourner's veil in the midst of celebration, a shadow on the sun, a dearth in the feast, Torcello sits, casting a somber tone on our happiness. She sits like a widow who once reigned as queen, her once bright crown now ashes, her eyes once full of light now filled with woe"|['1.
