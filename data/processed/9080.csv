Five days had passed since the sun first rose, and on the fifth day, the farm's rooster cheerfully woke the sleeping maids. The Acadian women from neighboring hamlets and farms came in a sad procession, driving heavy wagons filled with their belongings to the sea-shore. Children clutched onto fragments of playthings as they hurried to the Gaspereau's mouth, where their goods were piled on the beach. Boats shuttled between the shore and ships all day, while the women and children gathered at the churchyard, where the long-imprisoned Acadian farmers emerged in a gloomy procession. Evangeline waited calmly at the shore, where she met Gabriel, who was pale with emotion. As the sun set, the farmers sang a chant of Catholic Missions, and the procession moved towards the sea amid songs and prayers. The chaos of embarking saw loved ones separated, leaving Evangeline and her father in despair on the shore. Night fell, the ocean retreated, and the stranded Acadian farmers camped on the beach, surrounded by the remnants of the tide. Fires were lit on the shore, where sorrowful faces gathered, and the faithful priest wandered among them, offering solace. Evangeline tried in vain to comfort her father, who sat in silence, lost in his grief. The priest, filled with compassion, could only murmur a blessing, and together they wept under the silent stars.|"['1.

From the south rose a bright light, like the red Moon in autumn climbing the sky. It stretched its hands over mountains and meadows, seizing rocks and rivers, casting huge shadows. The light spread over the village, the sky, and sea, illuminating ships in the harbor. Smoke columns rose, flames flickered through. The wind carried embers, igniting thatch roofs, sending smoke and flames into the air. The crowd watched in dismay, fearing for their homes in Grand-Pré. Cocks crowed, cattle lowed, dogs barked, a sound of dread arose as herds and horses ran amok. Overwhelmed, a priest and a maiden watched in horror. The maiden fainted, waking to mournful faces.

In the valley, by the river, the Birch Canoe was crafted, embodying the forest's essence. Hiawatha journeyed skillfully without paddles, guided by his thoughts and wishes. He glided on the river, swift or slow, veering as he pleased. Kwasind, his strong companion, aided in clearing the river's obstacles.

Hiawatha carefully maneuvered his birch canoe to safety, fearing the fierce Nahma might hurl him into the tumultuous waters. Adjidaumo, the squirrel, joyfully assisted Hiawatha until their task was done. Grateful, Hiawatha named the squirrel Adjidaumo, thanking him for his brave help. As the sturgeon Nahma lay lifeless, sea-gulls swooped down, recognizing Hiawatha's triumph over the fish. The sea-gulls widened the rifts in Nahma's body, freeing Hiawatha from his dark prison. Nokomis, seeing the sea-gulls feeding on Nahma, acknowledged their aid in saving Hiawatha. After the sea-gulls departed, Nokomis prepared oil from Nahma's remains.
