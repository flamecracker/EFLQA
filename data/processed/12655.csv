Building a snow structure can be an exciting and creative activity, especially when done with care and attention to detail. Constructing a snow fort or house allows for the expression of imagination and architectural skill. The shape of the snow house is typically like a beehive, with a circular ground plan. To begin, a circle is marked on the ground, and snow blocks are stacked to form the walls. It is important to pack the snow blocks firmly using moist snow that can easily pack together. Creating uniform snow blocks can be achieved by using a mold made from old boards. As the building progresses, each layer of snow blocks should have a slight slant towards the center to ensure the walls curve inward. Additionally, the thickness of the walls should be greater at the base for taller structures. Working together, one can make the blocks, another can shape them, and two others can build the house. The process of building a snow house is not only fun but also a great way to learn about architecture and teamwork.|"['1.

"The Eskimo beehive snow house is a remarkable example of true arch building. Unlike traditional arches that require scaffolding and buttressing to support outward thrust, the Eskimo's snow structure stands without these aids. The top keystone isn't even needed for support. Constructing such an arch with bricks or stones would be challenging without scaffolding, but with snow blocks, it's simple. This innovative design showcases the ingenuity of the Eskimo people.

Another intriguing invention is a mysterious lock designed by Geo. Goodbrod from Union, Ore. The lock, shown in Fig. 1, operates with a stick pivoted near the top to lift the latch connected by a cord. A bolt, attached to a combination dial, interacts with the stick to open the latch. The mechanism is concealed within the door, keeping outsiders puzzled. Additionally, a clever solution for hanging hot dish holders involves screw eyes on the ceiling, a weight, and strings to keep the holders conveniently positioned near the stove."|"['1.

"To enhance ice fishing, various signaling devices like ""tip ups"" and ""jumping jacks"" alert fishermen when a fish is hooked. An advanced option is the electric signal system. This system includes an electric bell and a pocket battery mounted in a box. The box has brass strips on the outside that complete an electric circuit when connected. When a fish is hooked, the line triggers the brass strips to close the circuit, activating the bell. Another useful tool is a homemade floor polisher. By stretching flannel or carpet over a wooden box and adding paving bricks for weight, a functional polisher can be created. This DIY polisher can weigh around 16 lb, ideal for household use. Additionally, a simple trick to secure a paper bag is to place the string in a way that forms a handle and prevents contents from leaking."|['1.

Small glass ornaments used for Christmas tree decorations are fragile and can easily break along the line shown in the diagram. However, they can be easily fixed by inserting a matchstick, toothpick, or small piece of wood into the neck and tying the hanging string to it. A scroll saw is a handy tool to have in a carpenter's toolbox, especially for cutting small and irregular shapes. It is more versatile than a keyhole saw and can be used to create decorative items like brackets, bookracks, and shelves. You can make a simple and sturdy scroll saw frame using a cold-rolled steel rod, machine screws, washers, and nuts. This frame can hold the saw securely for precise cutting. Additionally, the fixtures for a watch fob can be crafted from brass, copper, or silver, with silver being the most elegant but costly option. Leather or silk can be used for the body of the fob, with various colors available to match your style. To create the fixtures, make full-size drawings of the design on metal, etch the design, and treat it with color, if desired.

During my countryside vacation, I missed my daily bath routine but improvised a shower system that worked perfectly. I enclosed the back porch with sheets to create a private space. The setup included a galvanized-iron pail with a valve and sprinkler attached to a rope over a pulley on the porch roof. By filling the pail with water and raising it above, a shower was created, with a tub on the floor to catch the water. To ensure the system worked smoothly, a knot in the rope prevented it from slipping, and a loop at the end was hung on a screw hook on the wall. I also crafted small sprocket wheels from old hubs to assist in the process. This DIY solution saved time and worked effectively.|"['1.

When you receive groceries, keep the paper bags to store bread and cakes. Seal the bag's opening with a string to maintain the freshness and cleanliness of the items, as suggested by Mrs. L. H. Atwell from Kissimmee, Florida. To create a mechanism, you will need some brass, steel pens, saucers, stopcocks, and a shaft. Begin by marking circles on the brass sheet, one with a 3-1/2 inch diameter and the other with a 2-3/4 inch diameter. The larger circle represents the final brass wheel size, while the smaller circle indicates the slot depth. Drill a hole for the shaft and mark drill points for the side plates. Cut slots on the radial lines of the disk using a hacksaw. Secure 53 steel pens in the slots and attach metal pieces with holes around the shaft hole. Assemble the side plates using machine screws and nuts.|"['1. What is the suggested use of paper bags according to Mrs. L. H.

The disk casing is constructed using two enameled-iron saucers bolted together with a thin layer of asbestos in between to create a secure seal. A 3/4-inch hole is cut on one saucer for exhaust, and a pipe can be inserted for extending the exhaust beyond the casing. To prevent steam from escaping, pins are inserted through holes drilled in the pipe and casing, then soldered. A 1/8-inch hole at the lowest point allows water runoff, and a wooden plug can serve as a stopcock. Nozzles with stopcocks connected to a 3/8-inch supply pipe should be set at a 20-degree angle, with a 1/16-inch gap between the nozzle and blades for flexibility. Bearings made of 1/4-inch brass are bolted to the casing with 1/8-inch machine screws and nuts. The pulley is created by securing a steel pipe on the engine shaft with machine screws and nuts. Lead should be added if the shaft is square.|['**1. What material is used to construct the disk casing?**\nA) Steel\nB) Enameled-iron\nC) Aluminum\nD) Copper\nE) Plastic', '**2.

Books with a flexible back can be tricky to hold upright while copying from them. People often resort to using a makeshift setup of paperweights and other books, but this usually leads to unsatisfactory results. To address this issue, a holder can be crafted by cutting out a corner of a box and fitting it with two screw eyes. By following the instructions provided by James M. Kane from Doylestown, Pa., the holder can be customized to accommodate the length of the backboard, determining the slope for the book rest. Additionally, Maurice Baudier from New Orleans, La., suggests a clever method to prevent breaking the cork of a stock mucilage bottle by inserting a stove bolt through the cork. Another practical idea shared by Theodore L. Fisher from Waverly, Ill., involves using an ordinary hinge to create a broom holder on a wall.

Many readers of Popular Mechanics Magazine cherish their issues and transform them into bound books. These bound volumes serve as a valuable reference on mechanical topics and create an appealing library collection. Personally, I enjoy binding my magazines at home, creating two beautifully proportioned volumes each year from six issues. To prepare the magazines for binding, the covers are removed, wire binders are pulled out, and advertising pages are discarded. The remaining sections, each with four double leaves, are then separated and arranged in order. To sew the sections together, a frame is constructed, and a blunt needle threaded with coarse white thread is used to secure the sections to strings in the frame. This process results in a well-crafted and organized bound book ready for use as a resource or for leisurely reading.|['1.

To create a bookbinding, start by sewing the strings tightly using a needle. String No. 5 needs extra care, with the needle passing through twice on the left side. Proceed to fasten each section by looping the needle through the strings in a specific order. After sewing, cut the strings leaving 2 inches on each side. Separate and comb out the fibers at the ends to serve as hinges. Cut a piece of cheesecloth for the back and glue it. Use heavy cardboard for the covers, cutting them slightly larger than the pages. Cover the cardboard with cloth, leather, or paper as desired. Glue the covers onto the book, ensuring a margin. Attach the hinges inside the covers, glue the flyleaf, and press everything under a weight until dry. For a leather hinge, cover the wings with sheet metal and fasten them with nails or screws.

To create a homemade cannon, you will need a piece of 1-inch hydraulic pipe, a steel sleeve, and a long threaded plug. It's important to use hydraulic pipe or double extra heavy pipe, as regular gas pipe is too light. Cut a piece of wood to create a base and another piece for the pivot point. Attach copper brushes to the base, ensuring they touch brass-headed tacks in a semi-circle formation. Connect the tacks with German-silver wire coils underneath the board. Add copper strips to guide the movement of the brushes. Build sides around the apparatus, leaving space for the coils. Connect the setup as shown in the diagram. For the jars, size them according to the voltage you'll use. Fill each jar with a mixture of water and sulphuric acid. The copper or brass disks placed in the jars are connected with wires above the jar.|['1.

The design of the sled runners is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3. To construct them, you will need oak wood. For the front runners, you require two pieces measuring 30 inches by 5 inches by 1-1/4 inches, and for the rear runners, two pieces measuring 34 inches by 5 inches by 1-1/4 inches. Additionally, you need two pieces measuring 14 inches by 6 inches by 2 inches and four pieces measuring 14 inches by 2 inches by 1 inch. Assemble them using 3-inch long screws, avoiding the use of nails for sturdiness. Pay attention to the measurements at points A, B, and C in Figure 2. The front runners should have specific dimensions, while the rear runners have different measurements. Use 3/8 inch cold-rolled steel for the steel runners, flattened at the ends for screw holes. Ensure precise placement of screw eyes and avoid using screws on the running surface to prevent ice snatching. The steering mechanism details are depicted in Figure 3. A 3/4-inch steel rod is recommended for the steering rod, flattened at one end and embedded into the wood. Secure it in place with an iron plate drilled to fit the rod and attached to block X.

To create a sled, start by making oblong bags filled tightly with hair. Attach upholstery buttons with cords to secure the cushions. Cover the burlap with leather and repeat the process for the back cushion. Add brass tubes for support and grip. For a brake, use a pivoted wrought-iron lever. To inscribe on a tree, scrape off the bark, outline with a pencil, and focus sunlight through a magnifying glass to burn the inscription evenly. For making gearwheels, draw circles on paper to determine the pitch and cut out sheet metal accordingly. Use a saw guide for precise cuts. This sled can be made for $15 or $25 with additional features. Sharing costs with friends is a great idea if it's too expensive.|['1.

To create precise gear teeth, follow these steps. Firstly, place the guide along a diameter and secure it in a vise. Ensure the saw blade remains flat against the guide while cutting the first tooth. This method guarantees a central cut along the marking line, resulting in uniformly shaped teeth. A ward file is necessary to refine the teeth to the correct shape and thickness. When crafting a worm wheel, cut at a sloping angle based on the worm thread's slope and pitch. For a bevel wheel, cut deeper on the side with the larger diameter. To cut a rack, mark the pitch along the side and use the guide and saw accordingly. If creating a small picture in a specific corner of a plate, adjust the prepared slide accordingly. Lastly, connect a jump-spark coil to a battery, start the vibrator, and observe the blue light produced when touching the globe's surface.|"['1.

The experiment involves a transmitter and receiver setup without batteries. When someone speaks into the transmitter, the receiver can hear without batteries. The voice vibrations cause an inductive current to flow, transmitting words between two people. The setup uses a transmitter inducing no current. The components like carbon, zinc, and moist earth do not form a battery. An electrical device in a barn triggers an alarm during a fire. The setup includes a wooden block with an iron weight attached to a string passing through the barn. The weight falls during a fire, closing a circuit to ring an electric bell in the house. To create a coil, wrap a block of wood with asbestos and plaster-of-paris, wind wire around it, and repeat with alternating plaster and wire layers. Connect the coil to a base with binding posts and switches for a functional setup.|['1.

After setting up the core as seen in Figure 4, gently file one end until it aligns correctly. The pointer in Figure 5 is crafted from wire, with aluminum being the preferred material, although copper or steel can also be used. Create a 4-1/2 inch wire with a loop, D, positioned 1/2 inch from the lower end. Attach a brass piece, E, to the short end to balance the weight. Slide this onto the pivot and place it back in the support. If the pointer is balanced, it should align with Figure 1. If not, adjust using the adjusting-screw. Next, construct a brass frame like Figure 6, which can be made of wood but brass is better to prevent eddy currents. Wind the frame with magnet wire, the size depending on the amperes to be measured. Connect the wire ends to binding posts B and C in Figure 1. Create a wooden box, D, with a glass front and a paper scale inside. The box measures 5-1/2 inches high, 4 inches wide, and 1-3/4 inches deep internally. Once everything is assembled, solder the loop at D in Figure 5 to the axle to prevent movement.

When creating models of machines, it's essential to devise a method for a 3- or 4-way valve or cock. To make one, obtain a pet cock and drill a hole through it. For a 3-way, drill only to the existing opening, but for a 4-way, drill through the entire case and valve. Ensure valve B is turned correctly for drilling. After drilling, remove the valve, eliminate any rough edges, and reinstall. An electric-light circuit is more cost-effective than batteries for electrical experiments. Connect a small arc light and motor to the light socket, A, using a plug with wire connections. Adjust the current with a water rheostat in a saltwater-filled tin can. By linking the motor, E, and the arc light, F, both can be operated by switching at B. The arc light can be easily started by bringing the carbons together and then slightly separating them.|['1.

When two push-buttons operate one electric bell, it's hard to know which button is pressed without a device like an annunciator. An easy annunciator can be made from a small box with an electric-bell magnet. The armature pivots with an indicator that moves left or right based on which part of the magnet is magnetized. A box kite can be built by using straight grained wood sticks like spruce, basswood, or white pine. Cloth bands are attached to the sticks with tacks, and the ends are sewn for strength. Diagonal struts should be slightly bowed when placed to keep the cloth taut. The kite can be adjusted by shifting the position of the bridle. A bowline knot prevents slipping. In light wind, adjust the bridle to shorten G and lengthen F, and in strong wind, do the opposite. In very strong wind, secure a string to the stick. An experienced photographer uses blacklead for grooves around a camera for easy sliding. A circuit for short-distance telegraph lines simplifies operations without extra switches and wiring.|['1.

To create a thermo battery that generates electricity from heat, you'll need a wooden frame (A) with nails (B) connected by copper wires (C). Solder all connections for best results due to low voltage. Heat the nails with an alcohol lamp, then use a galvanometer (E) with a compass (F) to detect the current. Turn the spool north-south parallel to the compass needle. When the nails heat up and the circuit is complete, the needle will move at right angles to the wire coils. Applying ice reverses the current. For a cannon ignition system, attach a wooden piece (A) to the cannon and connect it to an induction coil. A spark ignites the powder in the cannon, firing it safely. Lastly, a door lock mechanism uses a lever with a staple at C, allowing the door to be locked and unlocked using magnets and buttons.|['1.

Before attaching the reverse block to the motor, disconnect the lower binding posts from the brush holders and link both ends of the field coil to the lower posts. Adjust strips BB (Fig. 2) to touch the nuts securing wood strip D, Fig. 1. Tighten the screw. Ice fishing can be fun, but cutting the initial holes is tough. An ice chisel, easy to make and inexpensive, helps. Include a short ax-handle. Once the holes are ready, remove the pipe from the ax head, insert the handle, and use the ax to chop wood for your fire. Pipes and fittings offer endless possibilities. The sketch presents a lamp-screen (A and B) and a dumbbell (C). The lamp shade is handy for reading or writing, acting as a reflector when enameled white. Dumbbells, made with pipes and lead, can be enameled black with leather-covered handles. Ice and sealing wax share a unique bending property.

To create a homemade kiln, start by getting a medium-sized plumber's torch, which may cost more initially but will be more cost-effective in the long run. When using the burner, ensure a gradual firing process, especially during the first use. For optimal temperature, consider placing a 1-inch pipe 2 feet long over the lid hole as a chimney. To enhance efficiency, use an additional iron pail, 2 inches wider than the kiln, as a chimney by inverting it over the kiln for a down draft. Next, make a core using small iron wire bundled together and cut into 3.5-inch lengths. Bind them neatly with thread and file the ends smooth. Create wooden ends, varnish them, bore holes in the center, and fit the core snugly inside, leaving a quarter-inch protruding from each end. Shellac the core with paper and wind bell magnet wire over it, leaving free wire ends for connections. Finally, create a regulator for the vibrator using a piece of copper wire and set up the connections and base as shown in the figures.|"[""1.

To create a rain gauge, follow these steps: Use galvanized iron to construct the funnel, body, and tube. The funnel should overlap the body and discharge into the tube, which is one-tenth the area of the funnel's top. The water depth in the tube is ten times the actual rainfall. To measure, use a stick marked in tenths of an inch for hundredths of an inch results. For a rain gauge, consider these dimensions: 8-inch diameter for the funnel, 2.53-inch diameter for the tube, and a length of about 20 inches. Place it in an exposed area to avoid inaccuracies from wind. To determine snowfall, pour a known amount of water into the gauge. When making an aquarium, start with the size. A manageable size like 12 by 12 by 20 inches is recommended due to increased difficulty with larger sizes. Begin by purchasing a length of 3/4 by 1/8-inch angle iron for the frame. Cut and bevel the horizontal pieces and drill for 3/16-inch stove bolts. Assemble the frame by marking and drilling holes, then countersink the upright pieces.

To operate the microscope, place a small item on the clear disk, which can be dampened for better grip, and peer through opening D. Good lighting is essential for optimal results, and the object should ideally be transparent. The instrument operates based on the principle that the apparent size of an object is inversely related to its distance from the eye. For instance, if the distance is halved, the object appears twice as large. A fly's wing can seem as big as a hand when viewed through this microscope. The sounder, Fig. 1, is crafted from an old electric-bell magnet on a wooden base. The stop, K, is a wire nail placed to maintain a small gap between the armature and the magnet. The key, Fig. 2, also wooden, contains a switch, D, and binding posts connected to contacts, K. A music cabinet can be constructed from boards and assembled as detailed.|"['1.

To create shelves as illustrated in Fig. 2, use 1/4-inch material to make 12 cleats, each 13-1/2 inches long, from a strip of wood measuring 1/2 by 3/4 inches. Cut a groove of 1/4 by 1/4 inches in each cleat. Secure 6 cleats evenly inside each side, AA, using 3/4-inch brads. This arrangement allows for seven spaces for music, and by making the shelves removable, two spaces can be combined into one for flexibility. For a simple wireless coherer, gather a glass tube, two corks, a magnetized needle, and iron and silver filings. Construct the coherer as shown in the diagram, ensuring it stands upright and is connected in the circuit as depicted. When electrical waves hit the needle, the filings' conductivity is activated, producing a click in the receiver. A water rheostat can be fashioned using a brass tube filled with water, allowing for current regulation in devices like induction coils or motors. By adjusting the wire or rod in the water, resistance can be controlled. Adding salt to the water decreases resistance and boosts motor speed. For unlocking spring locks, a clever device with a spring, wire cord, lever, and magnetic trigger can be designed. The mechanism, when activated by a secret contact outside the door, releases the lock. The contact can be made using metal numbers or a custom-built contact|['1.

This is a simple glass box trap used to catch animals. The trap has transparent sides and back, allowing the animal to see through it. When the animal enters and touches the bait, the lid drops and traps it inside. To build this trap, you need a carbon-zinc battery. Remove the zinc rod and soak the carbon cylinder to remove any remaining crystals. Create a conical zinc piece known as a fuller's zinc using scrap zinc or worn-out zinc rods. Amalgamate the zinc by rubbing it with a diluted solution of sulphuric acid and mercury. Connect the battery wire and zinc using a wire connector. Prepare a solution by dissolving potassium bichromate and sulphuric acid in water. Pour the solution into the battery jar and assemble the battery. Ensure the zinc does not touch the solution.

The battery initially provides a two-volt current, ideal for powering induction coils and small electric motors. To preserve the zinc and prevent wastage when not in use, lift the zinc and secure the lower thumb screw. An illustration demonstrates a mechanism for opening a furnace coal door with a foot pedal, eliminating the need to rest the shovel on the ash door. By pressing the pedal, the coal door opens, allowing coal insertion, and pressing it again closes the door. The sending apparatus comprises an induction coil with a telegraph key in the primary circuit, available at electrical-supply stores. Altering the coil by adding a telegraph key and two wires with brass balls creates the sending apparatus. For the receiving end, a modified 5-cp. incandescent lamp with platinum wire points immersed in a sulfuric acid solution serves as an effective receiver, adjustable for message distance.|['1.

To create these bearings, start by cutting a square hole in the wood, dividing it equally between the two halves of the bearing. Separate the halves slightly using cardboard on each side, touching the shaft. Notch the edges that touch the shaft like saw teeth to allow the babbitt to flow into the lower half. These notches can be about 1/8 inch pitch and depth. Place wood pieces at points A and B, then drill a hole in the top of the bearing. Heat the babbitt and shaft, ensuring the babbitt isn't too hot. Chalk or smoke the shaft to prevent sticking. After pouring, split the bearing with a wooden pin. Drill a hole at the top for an oil cup. This bearing is suitable for various machines. For the cone pulley, assemble circular wood pieces according to Fig. 6 dimensions. Ensure they are true by turning them after assembly. Fasten the tailstock to the bed using thumb nuts for easy shifting. Use a 1/2-inch pipe and lock nut for the center holder mechanism.

Before silver plating, certain metals like iron, lead, pewter, and zinc need to be first coated with copper in an alkaline copper bath and then treated as copper. However, on metals like brass, copper, German silver, nickel, and others, silver plating can be done directly. The silver deposit may appear dull and will need to be polished. The recommended method is to use a revolving scratch brush or a hand scratch brush if a buffing machine is not available. Quick, light strokes are advised for polishing with ordinary plate powder. When suspending articles in the plating bath, connect the positive terminal to the silver piece and the negative terminal to the article to be plated. For rigging a sliding door, you will need flat pulleys, an old electric bell or buzzer, clothesline rope, and No. 18 wire. Follow the provided diagram for setting up the rigging system.|['1.

The diagram in Figure 1 illustrates how a switch works. By connecting terminal c1 to the carbon of a battery and c2 to the zinc, turning handle K to the right makes strips e1 and e2 touch b1 and b2. This action causes terminal c3 to display + and c1 to have electricity. Conversely, turning the handle to the left so that e1 and e2 touch b2 and b3 will show - at terminal c3 and + at c4. With slight modifications, any telephone with a carbon transmitter can receive wireless messages. By adjusting connections and adding an antenna, along with three dry cells in series, messages within a one-mile radius can be received. The setup, using a 1/2-inch jump spark coil, turns an ordinary telephone into a wireless telegraph station. By adding a switch, different battery combinations can be utilized for sending and receiving messages effectively. This method was successfully applied to a homemade water rheostat by Eugene F. Tuttle, Jr., from Newark, Ohio.|['1.

When filling bottles with small necks, it can be tricky to avoid spilling the liquid. Using a funnel is not always possible, and pouring with a graduate glass requires a steady hand. In the absence of a graduate glass, a half egg-shell with a small hole pricked in the end can serve as a makeshift funnel. To make the shell less brittle and more durable, place it in an oven to slightly brown the surface. Another clever invention is an electric alarm designed by H. E. Redmond. This alarm can be turned off from the bed without getting up, and it includes a light that can be switched on and off while lying down. Additionally, when crossing a watercourse on a fence rail or log, it's important to face the opposite shore and walk steadily forward to avoid getting wet.|['1.

To make a sand mold for casting, start by constructing a bench with lumber about 1 inch thick in a trough shape. Nail cleats to the front and back to support cross-boards that hold the mold. Use yellow sand for better results, but black sand can work too. Fine molding sand, about 1-2 cubic feet, is needed. If you can't find sand at a foundry, try using fine sand that sticks together. Avoid using coarse lake or river sand. You'll need a shovel and a sieve for sand preparation. A homemade sieve using wire netting works well. Make a wooden rammer for packing the sand. Use a cloth bag filled with coal dust as a parting medium. The flask, made of wood in two halves, is crucial for mold making. Dowels are important for aligning the flask halves.|['1.

To prepare for molding, begin by creating two boards larger than the flask's outside, as shown at K in Figure 1. Attach cleats to aid in lifting the mold. For melting metal like aluminum, white metal, or zinc, a cast-iron glue-pot works well. Additional simple tools are required. Once the flask and tools are ready, molding can begin. It's advised to observe molders at work in a brass foundry to learn before trying. When molding, ensure the sand is moist enough by testing its consistency. Screen the sand to remove lumps, then add water as needed. Ram the sand into the flask to create the mold. Proper ramming is crucial; too soft or hard can lead to issues. Vent holes and a pouring hole should be added before pouring the metal into the mold.|['1.

Now comes the crucial part of the molding process - lifting the cope from the drag. This step can be tricky as the sand may fall out and ruin the mold. However, with practice and patience, the molder can lift the cope without any issues. Next, the gate, which guides the molten metal, is cut with a spoon creating a channel. The pattern is then removed by driving a steel rod into it and gently lifting it out. After removing the pattern, the cope is placed back on the drag. A brick is placed on top to prevent the mold from separating during pouring. When ready to pour, the metal is melted in a glue-pot crucible and poured into the mold in a small stream. Tin is a good metal for casting due to its low melting point and attractive finish. After solidifying, the casting can be removed from the mold and finished.|['1.

When using batteries in series and needing to change the current frequently, a convenient device can be used. In this example, four batteries are used, but any reasonable number can work. By moving switch A to the left, the current can be reduced or turned off. Then, by moving switch B to the right, the current can be turned on in the opposite direction with the desired strength. Different positions of these switches allow using the current from each cell or pair of cells in either direction. This setup is useful for various electrical experiments. Additionally, a sheet-iron band with a needle point attached can be used for a magic trick involving lifting a table.

Many boys enjoy making snowballs, but few understand what happens during the process. Water typically freezes at 32 degrees, but when in motion or under pressure, it needs even colder temperatures to turn into ice. Ice slightly below freezing can turn into liquid with pressure and return to solid when the pressure is removed. When compressed, snow, which is essentially finely divided ice, turns into liquid in spots. Upon releasing the pressure, the liquid parts freeze, binding all particles together. Ice has the unique ability to flow, similar to water, seen in glaciers that behave like rivers of ice due to immense pressure turning snow into ice. This flowing ice can bend and unite, much like water. The property of ice flowing can be demonstrated using sealing wax, which changes shape when supported properly.|['1.

A lamp can be powered using a battery. The battery can be made from small dry cells connected in series. By heating a piece of paper and rubbing it with cloth, the lamp can be turned on when the paper is brought near it. The battery can be more economical than dry cells as it gives more power. It's important to connect the batteries in parallel to increase the current but maintain a constant voltage. By regulating the batteries based on the ampere output and lamp rating, the system can be efficiently managed. It's also possible to use exhausted batteries from garages for lighting. Another economical option is to use a small dynamo powered by a water motor attached to a faucet to generate power for lights. This setup can produce a good amount of light based on the water pressure.|['1.

To achieve proper lighting for different voltages, the winding of the lamp should match the desired voltage. For instance, if wound for 6 volts, one could run two 3-volt lamps in parallel series, resulting in 11 series or 22 lights. On the other hand, if wound for 10 volts, it would provide 1-1/4 amperes and operate four 6-cp. lamps. This method allows any candle power lamp to be used by adjusting the number of lights in each series and running them in parallel. Similarly, connecting eleven 10-volt lamps in series on a 110-volt lighting circuit can produce 3 cp. each, drawing one ampere of current. This setup is cost-effective and practical for various applications, such as room lighting, display cases, and Christmas trees. Additionally, a phonograph experiment involving a longer belt can reverse the machine, altering the sound on the record significantly. Furthermore, constructing a rack using wood with adjustable shelves and cup hooks provides a versatile and decorative storage solution.|['1.

"To build a simple electrical circuit for a horn, you will need a transmitter, a receiver, a battery, and a switch. Start by connecting two wires to the transmitter. Run one wire directly to the receiver and the other to the battery, then to a switch, and finally to the receiver. The more batteries you use, the louder the horn will sound, but be cautious not to use too much battery power as it may cause the receiver to overheat. You can purchase these parts from an electrical-supply store. Remember to follow safety precautions when working with electrical components.

For polishing a glass, fasten one glass on top of another using small nails and pitch. Use wet grain emery for grinding. Spread the emery evenly on the glass and move it back and forth while rotating to grind evenly. Work with straight strokes and check the focal length by reflecting sunlight onto a paper. Use different grades of emery for grinding and polishing until the glass becomes semi-transparent. Finally, polish the glass by molding pitch squares onto it and painting them with jeweler's rouge. Work the glass over the tool using short strokes for a smooth finish."|"[""1.

To test the glass for reflection, follow these steps: Set the glass against a wall in a dark room, with a lamp twice the focal length away. Place a sheet of pasteboard with a needle hole near the lamp to shine light onto the glass. Position the speculum so the light from the needle hole reflects to the left side of the lamp. Mount a knife on a block of wood edgeways to the lamp, not more than 6 inches away. Move the knife across the rays while looking at the speculum. A well-polished glass will darken evenly as the knife blocks light. If there are dark rings or hills, adjust polishing strokes. Next, silver the speculum by placing it in a bath of prepared solutions until the silver rises. Rinse and polish the silver film with a chamois skin.|"['1.

Making your own telescope can be a fun and affordable project. John E. Mellish built a 6-inch telescope for just $15 and discovered a new comet with it. If you're interested in photography, you can create distorted images of people using prisms. By following a few easy steps with glass prisms, black paper, and a camera, you can achieve unique effects in your photos. When mixing plaster of Paris, remember to add the plaster slowly to water for a smooth consistency. Adding vinegar or marshmallow powder can help delay the setting of the plaster. And if you want the plaster to harden more, try adding a bit of sulphate of potash or powdered alum. You can also enlarge small pictures taken with a hand camera using a simple process.|['1.

To create a darkroom for developing photographs, ensure a light-proof room with a clear window for unobstructed light. Set up a shelf to hold the camera and a table with a drawing-board. Remove the back of the camera and fit it against the shelf with a hole matching the camera's back opening. Place the negative on the shelf, allowing light to pass through the lens onto the drawing-board. Darken the window surroundings. After focusing the lens, set the shutter, place bromide paper on the board, expose, develop, and fix it following the instructions. Avoid pulling a lamp by its cord and never fasten it to a gas pipe. Create a suspension using a spool and a card by blowing air through the spool. Construct a switch using copper or brass strips and a handle. Lastly, make a mouse trap using an old bicycle tire and a glass jar.|['1.

To create a small arc between two carbon points and generate light, connect an electric-bell magnet rewound with No. 16 wire in series with two electric-light carbons. This setup, shown in the diagram, will produce a small arc when the current flows. By using 10 or 12 dry batteries, the lamp can emit a decent amount of light. Additionally, you can illuminate a low-candlepower incandescent lamp by connecting it to an induction coil. Connect one wire to the metal cap and the other to the glass tip. When the current is switched on in the dark, the lamp will glow with a phosphorescent light. An induction coil acts as a step-up transformer and is widely used in experiments like wireless telegraphy. It consists of a core wound with magnet wire and a secondary coil wound with fine wire to induce a secondary current.|['1.

To build a simple electromagnet, start by creating the primary core using fine annealed No. 24 iron wire cut to 7 or 8 inches in length. Bundle the wires together to a diameter of 7/8 inches. Straighten the wires by rolling them between two pieces of hard wood. Wrap the core with one or two layers of manila paper. Next, wind No. 16 cotton-covered magnet wire evenly from one end to the other, creating two layers. Secure the terminals with twine and immerse the core and primary in boiling paraffin wax with resin and beeswax added. Wrap the primary with okonite tape or shellacked muslin. This completed primary can now be inserted into the secondary coil. If the secondary coil does not have a case, a wooden box can be made to house it and a small condenser. The condenser can be made by layering strips of thin paper and tinfoil, folding and securing them with paper or tape, and then boiling them in paraffin wax. This electromagnet is a simple yet effective science project that demonstrates the principles of electromagnetism.|['1. What is the primary core of the electromagnet made of?\nA. Copper wire\nB.

To create a simple storage cell, start by securing a 5-inch long piece of 1-3/4-inch lead pipe and soldering a circular lead disk to one end, creating a liquid-tight cup. Then, obtain a 3/4-inch diameter lead pipe with holes bored in it, leaving about 1 inch on each end. Hammer one end of this tube to form a pocket for paste. Construct a wooden box to hold the larger pipe, filling the corners with sawdust. Craft a wooden block to support the smaller tube inside the cup without touching it. Attach binding posts to both tubes. Make a paste for the positive plate using 1 part sulfuric acid, 1 part water, and red lead. Fill the smaller tube with the paste and the larger tube with diluted sulfuric acid. Once assembled, the cell is ready to store current. Remember to handle sulfuric acid with caution to avoid burns.|['1.

To create a stand for a printing frame in front of a light, follow these steps: Make a sliding holder using a 1/4-inch gas pipe cut to 1 inch and fitted with a thumbscrew. Solder this pipe to a metal piece measuring about 4 by 4-1/2 inches with a small shelf formed at the bottom edge. The main stand is made by inserting a 5/16-inch rod tightly into a 1-inch thick, 3-1/2-inch square block of hard maple wood. The pipe on the metal support will slide up and down the rod, held in place by the thumbscrew. For an experiment, immerse an electric light bulb, not vacuum-sealed, in water, then break off the tip. Screw the bulb into a socket with the tip facing down, apply current, and watch the heated air inside force the water out. This can be repeated multiple times. This induction motor design, without an auxiliary phase, is made to be large enough to drive a sewing machine or light lathe using 110-volt AC from a lighting circuit. The stator has four poles built from sheet iron, and the armature tunnel is carefully filed out and assembled using shellac varnish for insulation.|['1.

The use of lantern slides, especially colored ones, to illustrate songs has created a high demand for slide making, making it a profitable venture for amateurs. A lantern slide is a glass plate coated with fine-grained emulsion, sized at 3-1/4 by 4 inches. Making lantern slides can be done in two ways: by contact or reduction in the camera. For contact exposure, the negative is placed in a printing frame with the lantern plate on top, then exposed and developed like a print on paper. Development should take about three to four minutes. Lantern-slide film, a new alternative to glass plates, offers the same results but is more portable and durable, making it popular for travelers. When reducing a larger negative to fit a lantern slide, a light-proof frame with a hole for the negative and proper camera setup are needed for accurate sizing and exposure.|['1.

To demonstrate the blind spot in your eye, create a small black dot on cardboard and draw a star about 3 inches away. Close one eye and focus on the star while moving the cardboard until the dot disappears, showing the blind spot where the optic nerve enters the eye. A clever washing device can be made using a wooden disk with tin can pieces nailed to it. Connect the disk to a water source with a belt system to operate household machines. The sketch may appear to have slanted letters, but measuring distances will reveal they are parallel. This optical illusion is due to the arrangement of short lines in the letters.|['1.

It is often necessary to measure the thickness of very thin materials that a regular ruler cannot accurately gauge. To solve this, a simple and precise micrometer-like tool can be made. Start by securing a bolt with fine threads, about 1/4-inch in diameter and 2-1/2 inches long. Next, clamp two wooden blocks together, each 1 inch wide, 3/4 inch thick, and 2-1/2 inches long. Drill a 1/4-inch hole through the center of both blocks. Attach a nut to one block and cut out a bench-like shape from the wood. Solder a 2-inch wire at a right angle to the bolt's head and attach a disc with markings for measurements. Place the bolt in the hole and screw it through the nut. By counting the threads per inch, you can measure the thickness of an object accurately. This homemade device can provide quite precise measurements, making it a useful tool when a micrometer is not available.|"['1.

To create a simple voltmeter, follow these steps: First, attach a tube and solder a copper wire to it. Hook the other end of the wire to spring C. The wire should be just long enough to hold iron piece D partially inside the coil while keeping the spring in place. Slip a circular cardboard piece E over the spring to act as a pointer. Glue a piece of paper under the pointer and against the top of the coil for calibration. Connect a battery cell to the binding posts to mark the volts. As the iron plunger is drawn into the tube, the pointer moves closer to the coil. Mark the pointer's position and the corresponding volts. Repeat with other cells for calibration. This DIY voltmeter is a fun and educational project for science enthusiasts.|"['1.

To create a simple kite frame, gather a thick piece of tin or brass and cut two pieces according to the pattern in Fig. 5, with each projection 3 inches long. The crosspiece should be 1 inch wide and the single projection 3/4 inch. Bend and nail these pieces on each end of a 1/4-inch thick, 1-inch wide, 5-foot long piece of wood as shown in Fig. 6. These will form pockets that fit over the uprights. Assemble the frame following the guide in Fig. 7. This frame can hold any background without needing to be stretched. For a kite reel, repurpose two old pulleys and some pipe fittings. The large pulley, approximately 14 inches in diameter, has flat iron strips with extending arms riveted on the face. These arms are connected by smaller pieces, creating a sturdy structure. Mount a guide on the shaft for the kite wire or string. The guide can be adjusted over the reel. Attach the smaller pulley to the shaft to act as a brake when needed. For winter fun, transform your bicycle into an ice rider by attaching runners made from 1/4-inch by 1-inch iron to the frame.

The main frames are now set for covering with cloth using cambric or bleached muslin. Secure the cloth tightly over the bent ribs, tack it to the front edge, and glue it to the ribs for safety. Create a 2 ft. wide and 4 ft. long opening in the lower plane for the operator. Place the two main surfaces 4 ft. apart, connect them with 12 uprights, and brace with diagonal wires for strength. The vertical rudder keeps the machine into the wind and is fixed, while the horizontal rudder prevents diving and maintains stability. Fasten the rudders with sticks and wires. Ensure the frame is unwrapped, and the surfaces are true for proper balance during flight. To glide, position yourself between the arm sticks, lift the machine, run against the wind, and leap to soar down the hillside. Gradually increase the distance as you master balancing and landing.|['1.

To create a camera focusing machine, start by holding a lit candle behind clear white glass to shine light through for focusing. Darken the room, set up your camera, and burn a bit of flash powder where the candle was. This will leave a flash impression on the glass. Use two glass plates, each with a 16-inch diameter, and drill a 3/4-inch hole in the center before cutting. Mark and cut the circle on each plate. Apply shellac varnish to both sides, then attach 16 tinfoil sectors to one side of each plate. Make collectors from 1/4-inch copper wire with brass balls soldered at the ends. Ensure the sectors lie flat on the glass, and the collectors are close but won't scratch. This machine will help focus the camera for better photography results.|"[""1.

For metalworking, gather tin shears, spikes, a file, flat and round-nosed pliers, a screwdriver, and No. 23 gauge sheet copper. Follow these steps: 1. Cut a copper piece with 1/2 in. extra metal on each side. 2. Use carbon paper to trace lines on the copper. Copper can be chemically treated for color effects. Cover a tray with turpentine, move it over a flame until the turpentine burns off. The copper will show rainbow colors. In a photograph, it may seem like a person has a painted face, but it's actually a face made on a bald head. The face features cut from black paper are pasted on the bald spot. All machinists use math. To multiply numbers like 9 times 8, use a finger method. Join fingers on both hands to get the product, like 8 times 9 equals 72.

To multiply numbers using finger counting, start by putting together the tips of the fingers labeled 12. This represents 40, which is four tens. Ignore the lower fingers and focus on the upper fingers. Multiply the number of upper fingers on one hand by the number on the other hand, in this case, 2 times 2 equals 4. Add this to the initial 40 to get 44. To find 12 times 12, add 100 to get 144. You can simplify this by considering the upper fingers as twenties and the lower fingers as tens. For figures above 15, renumber your fingers starting from 16. For example, to find 18 times 18, add 200 to get 324. This method can be extended to higher numbers, ensuring a quicker and easier way to multiply.|['1.

The conclusion drawn from the previous information is that when you focus on one of two images and then adjust the sharpness of the image on your retina, the other image becomes more noticeable. The small steam engine parts were mainly made from gas pipe and fittings. For instance, the cylinder was made from a 3-inch tee with a plug to create a valve seat. The steam chest was round to fit the tee connection. The crosshead guides were crafted from a piece of gas pipe. To shape copper, cut it in a circular form, file the edges, and mark concentric rings to guide the shaping process. Use simple tools like a round-nosed mallet and a hollowed block of wood to beat the copper into the desired shape, remembering to anneal the copper to prevent it from hardening too much.|['1.

Hold the rice paper in front of a bright light and place the spare hand about 12 inches behind it. The outlines of the bones will become visible on the rice paper. To make a shade pattern, use a 9 by 12-inch paper and a pencil compass to draw arcs of a circle. Add 2-3/4 inches to cover a half circle, accounting for a 1/4-inch lap. Nail a thin brass sheet of the same size onto a smooth wood board. Trace the design onto the brass using carbon paper. Punch holes along the outlines of the figures on the brass. Cut along the outer lines, bend the brass carefully, and fasten the edges together. You can enhance the shade by using a wood-turning lathe to shape a cone from soft wood that fits the brass shade. Punch holes in the brass following the traced pattern to maintain the cone shape. If you have many windows to putty, use a meat cutter or sausage grinder to soften and prepare the putty quickly. This method is efficient for cold putty but not for old putty or making putty from whiting and oil.|['1.

Gas pipe and fittings were utilized in crafting the swing displayed in the image. The blueprint details the assembly process. A 6-inch square cedar post is placed 3 feet into the ground, leaving 2 feet above ground. A 7/8-inch shafting piece acts as the axle, driven into the top of the post. A cast-iron ring or a sturdy wheel with four spokes, drillable for 1/2-inch pipe, serves as the hub for the swinging frame. The hub's hole must be 7/8 inches or smaller to fit the shafting. Uprights made from 1/2-inch pipe are attached to tees, connected to the center pipe with flattened 1/2-inch pipe ends. The cloth covering's lower part is secured with a bent 1/2-inch pipe. Braces from 1/2-inch pipe link the spokes and seats to the center pipe flange. An additional 18-inch wheel with bicycle cranks and pedals is placed between seats for propulsion. Miniature electric lights on overhead braces are powered through wires connected to the swing via a unique device fixed under the wheel hub.|['1.

"Here is a refined version of the passage using the given vocabulary:

A series of boxes, each smaller than the last, are used to perform a magic trick. A tin strip acts as a guide for a coin to move through the boxes. Rubber bands secure the boxes closed. The performer pretends the coin vanishes into a tin can, shakes it, and the coin appears in their hand. They cover the can with a handkerchief and reveal the boxes with the coin inside to surprise the audience. Another method for organizing film negatives is shown, using an album-like device with white paper leaves to hold the negatives securely. This allows for easy viewing of the pictures on the negatives against the white background. This system can be customized by adding more leaves as needed."|['1.

To create a fumed appearance on darkened oak, follow these steps. Place the oak in a tin biscuit box or a metal container, ensuring it is airtight. Arrange the oak so it is fully surrounded by fumes, ensuring all surfaces are exposed. Place a saucer of ammonia in the box, seal it tightly, and cover any joints with heavy brown paper. Monitor the process through a glass fitted into a hole in the cover. Once the oak reaches the desired shade, remove it. To finish, wax the wood by dissolving beeswax in turpentine until it forms a thick cream. Apply the mixture with a rag and brush it with a stiff brush. This method avoids French polishing or varnishing. For a homemade rectifier, use four 2-qt. fruit jars with electrodes of lead and aluminum to convert alternating current to direct current. This setup can charge batteries, run small motors, and light lamps effectively.|"[""1.

This birdhouse was specially designed for American martins, providing homes for up to 20 families. The openings are strategically placed to shield the birds from cold northern winds in early spring. Extra wooden rings around the openings create longer passages, aiding the martins in defending against English sparrows. Oval holes allow the young birds to peek out for fresh air. Overhanging eaves shield them from the summer sun. Each opening is partitioned inside to create individual rooms, stained black. A boomerang, a curved hardwood stick, can be made from a piece of hard maple, screws, and specific measurements. When thrown, it follows an elliptical orbit, returning near its starting point.

"To create a cross-shaped boomerang, you will need a piece of hard maple that is 5/16 inches thick, 2 inches wide, and 30 inches long, along with five 1/2-inch flat-headed screws. Cut the maple into two 14-inch pieces and plane the edges to make the ends 1-1/2 inches wide. Bevel these pieces as shown in Fig. 4 and fasten them together as depicted in Fig. 5. Apply several coats of linseed oil to the completed boomerang to prevent water absorption and keep it light. When throwing the boomerangs, hold one piece in your hand and throw it quickly with an underhand motion. With some practice, you can become skilled at throwing them. This project was contributed by O. E. Tronnes from Wilmette, Ill.

To calibrate the instrument, connect it in series with a standard ammeter marked in known quantities. Include a variable resistance and a power source in the circuit. Adjust the resistance to display 0.5 amperes on the standard ammeter and mark the pointer position. Change the resistance incrementally to cover the entire scale. When current passes through the coil, two magnetized metal strips repel each other due to like polarity, causing the pointer to move. The stronger the current, the greater the deflection of the pointer. This star finder can be crafted using wood and basic tools. It features an hour circle, a declination circle, and a pointer for celestial object tracking. Establish a true N and S meridian mark for accurate observations.|"['1.

The frame of the merry-go-round is made from a 30-inch long piece of 1/2-inch square iron bent into a U shape. A 1/8-inch thick, 3-inch wide sheet metal piece is riveted on the outside of the U-shaped iron. Two 2-1/2-inch angle irons are riveted vertically on the ends of the U-shaped iron, with a plate riveted on them to close the open end. This forms a face to attach the cylinder with bolts or cap screws. A hole is cut through the angle irons and plate to match the size of the cylinder bore, allowing the piston to be removed without taking off the cylinder. A 1-inch angle iron is riveted to one side of the frame to support the crankshaft bearing. The frame is then finished on an emery wheel. The piston and rod are made from old cast-iron pulleys, while the cap screws are crafted from steel pump rods. Studs are created by threading both ends of a suitable length rod. The flywheel and mixing valve are bought from a parts dealer. The cylinder's water jacket is a copper sheet soldered in place with brass bands covering the soldered joints. If gasoline leaks from the carburetor when the engine is off, check the float's needle valve. If pressing down the valve stops the dripping, the float is too high. Grinding the valve should stop the dripping if it continues.|"['1. What is the material used for the frame of the merry-go-round?\nA) Steel\nB) Iron\nC) Aluminum\nD) Copper\nE) Brass', '2.

"To create a simple solar eyepiece for your telescope, you can repurpose colored eyeglasses with very dark lenses and metal rims. Break off the frame, leaving the metal rims intact. Place these over the telescope's eyepiece and secure them with rubber bands looped over the metal nibs. This makeshift solar eyepiece can help you observe the sun safely.

For a DIY electric horn, start by securing an empty syrup or fruit can with a smooth flat bottom. Attach the can to a wooden base and connect an electrical bell to the setup. Adjust the contact screw until you achieve a clear tone. The moving armature of the bell vibrator will cause the can's bottom to vibrate, producing sound waves. Experiment with the can's thickness to adjust the tone's pitch.

Lastly, you can repurpose a large street lamp globe and a yellow pine block to create a cost-effective aquarium. Embed the globe in aquarium cement within a depression on the pine block. Finish by adding cement around the globe's base and sprinkle fine sand while it's damp for a textured look.

To make a simple toy, get a small tin can or a pasteboard box that is about 2 inches in diameter and at least 2 inches tall. Punch two holes, labeled A in Fig. 1, on the lid and the bottom, a quarter inch away from the center and directly across from each other. Then, cut a curved line from one hole to the other, as shown at point B. Cut a piece of lead into a specific shape as shown in Fig. 2, with dimensions of 1 by 1-1/8 by 1-1/4 inches. Secure an ordinary rubber band around the lead piece's neck, leaving both ends free. Bend the tin pieces between the holes A on the top and bottom as shown in Fig. 4. Loop the band ends over them, fold the flaps down on the band, and assemble the can parts as in Fig. 5. Decorate the can with colorful paper strips.

To create metal tools for repoussé work, you can either buy punches and a pitch bed or make them yourself. Making them is simple. Start by cutting a piece of mild steel into the desired tool shapes using a cold chisel and file. Smooth the ends with emery paper. Create a mixture of pitch and plaster with tallow, using equal parts pitch and plaster with a tenth part tallow. Keep the mixture dry to prevent boiling over. Heat the pitch, add plaster gradually, and stir constantly without boiling. Trace a design onto a piece of brass using carbon paper. Work the design on a pitch bed using raising punches. Heat the pitch slightly, place the brass design-side down, and shape it with punches after the pitch hardens. Correct any imperfections, flatten the metal, drill a hole, saw out an opening, and clean the metal with pumice and lye. Apply lacquer to prevent tarnishing, solder metal clips for securing the picture, and add a metal strip for support. This method also works for determining the horsepower of small motors or engines.|['1.

Horsepower is a unit that measures the rate of work, equivalent to 33,000 ft. lb. per minute or 550 ft. lb. per second. To determine the horsepower of a motor, attach a 25 ft. twine to the motor shaft and hang a weight on the other end. Let the motor lift the weight and measure the time it takes to lift it and the distance covered. Multiply the weight by the distance, then divide by the time in minutes (or fraction) obtained. Finally, divide this result by 33,000 to find the horsepower of the motor. Creating an attractive show window involves placing goldfish and canary birds in separate glass vessels of different sizes, with the smaller vessel inside the larger one. Decorate the bottom with moss and aquarium decorations, fill the gap between vessels with water, cover with a screen, and add a bird swing.

Next, construct a siphon using glass tubes with one end bent, as shown in Fig. 1. Attach an air receiver and regulator to the siphon's top end, as depicted in Fig. 2. The air receiver, crucial for this setup, consists of a 3/4-inch diameter glass tube with a hole for air entry. Ensure the smaller glass tubes' ends align to allow water drops to fall continuously. The regulator, positioned above the air receiver, controls water flow. To start, clamp the rubber tube, exhaust air from the siphon, place it in the upper reservoir, release the clamp, and let water drop. Keep the reservoir filled for continuous operation.|['1.

In the illustration, we see a Russian knout in Fig. 9. The handle is crafted using wood and iron or steel, which can be mimicked by wrapping wood with tinfoil. The handle can be a single piece of wood, painted black at the bottom and covered with tinfoil on top, with a screw-eye attached at the upper end. A real iron or steel chain connects the handle to the ball, made according to Fig. 8. The ball's spikes, approximately 1 inch long, are cut from wood pieces, leaving a small peg at the end and the center resembling a No. 20 spike. The pegs are glued and inserted into holes drilled in the ball. In Fig. 10, a Sclavonic horseman's battle-axe is depicted, with a wooden handle painted dark gray or light brown and a steel axe blade. The blade is cut from 1/4-inch wood, shaped thin and sharp at the edge, with the hammer side thickened by gluing wood pieces to match the blade's thickness, gradually shaping off to the middle of the axe with a chisel, sanding, and covering with tinfoil. Three large brass or iron nails fixed into the handle complete the axe. In the early sixteenth century, horseman's battle-axes like the one in Fig. 11 were used, with both handle and axe made of steel. This axe is crafted similarly to the one in Fig.|"['1.

During the fourteenth to the sixteenth centuries, people crafted beautiful ornaments for their homes. The English Mechanic suggests creating imitation pieces using wood, tinfoil, and glue. For instance, an English mace from the fifteenth century was about 24 inches long. You could make the handle and spike from a single piece of wood and attach six triangular wings evenly around the spike. To mimic steel, cover the wood with tinfoil using glue. Another example is an iron mace from the fifteenth century, approximately 22 inches long with an octagonal head. This mace can be made in three parts: an octagonal head and a two-part handle with a circular shield between them. Carve ornamental patterns on the head and handle using a carving tool or a red-hot poker.|['1.

During the winter when outdoor games are not possible, a fun indoor game can be played using a knife and a board. To play, the knife is opened and lightly stuck into the board. By flicking the forefinger quickly, the knife is thrown into the air and allowed to land in different positions. The outcome of the game is determined by how the knife lands. For example, if the knife rests on its back, it's a foul ball. A home run is scored when the handle sticks upright in the board. Different positions like both blades sticking in the board or the large blade sticking indicate different hits like a three-base hit or a two-base hit. Players take turns until three outs are made, similar to a baseball game. This game provides entertainment and skill practice indoors during the winter months.|"['1.

A magician demonstrates a trick with a bag and a burning candle. In the first trick, the magician's assistant appears to escape from a tied bag inside a cabinet in under 30 seconds. The secret lies in the assistant pulling in some rope before being tied up, then releasing it in the cabinet to create space to escape easily. For the candle trick, the magician pretends to light a candle with invisible light between his hands. In reality, he heats a wire with the burning candle and uses it to ignite phosphorus hidden in the wick. Additionally, a magic lantern can be used with sunlight during the day by directing the light through a hole in a piece of paper onto the lantern's lens. Lastly, a simple drill gauge made from wood can help amateur craftsmen with their drilling needs.|"[""1.

To create a porous cell, roll thick brown wrapping paper or blotting paper into a tube about 5 inches long with a 2-inch internal diameter. Secure the paper to prevent unwinding and seal one end with 1/2-inch thick plaster of paris. Slightly constrict the tube for better plaster retention. Use unsized paper to allow solution mingling through pores. You'll need two liquids for the cell: a blue vitriol solution in water and diluted oil of vitriol (sulphuric acid). Charge the cell by placing zinc in the paper tube, inserting both into a tin can, connecting wires, pouring diluted acid around zinc, and adding blue vitriol solution. Empty the blue vitriol solution after use to prevent corrosion. This battery cell provides a steady current suitable for amateur experiments, costing around 50 cents per dozen cells.|['1.

A sundial is an ancient time-measuring device that uses the sun's shadow. Sundials were common before the invention of clocks. Today, they are more decorative but can still be accurate if constructed correctly. The most common type is the horizontal dial. It has a flat circular table on a sturdy base with a metal triangular plate called the gnomon rising from the center. The gnomon is tilted toward the dial's meridian line at an angle equal to the location's latitude. As the sun moves, the gnomon's shadow indicates the time of day. To repair a cracked tray, fill the crack with powdered rosin, heat a metal piece to melt the rosin through the crack, and trim off the excess rosin once cooled. This repair method can extend the tray's lifespan.|"[""1.

To set up a sundial, start by drawing a line AB, then erect a perpendicular line BC at one end. The height of BC is determined by the latitude of the location. For example, for a latitude of 41 degrees-30', interpolate between the heights for 40 and 42 degrees. Use a table of natural functions to calculate BC, which is the base (5 in.) times the tangent of the latitude. Draw line AD to find the correct angle for the style. The thickness of the style should be 1/8 to 1/4 in. for metal or thicker for stone. The back of the style is usually hollowed for appearance. The upper edges casting shadows must be sharp and straight. To create the hour circle, draw parallel lines AB and CD, then two semicircles with a radius of 5 in. Use table No. 2 for hour marks, interpolating for latitudes not listed.|"['1.

During the day, the sundial can be set accurately by ensuring it is level and the style is perpendicular to the dial face, pointing the sloping side towards the North Pole. An ordinary compass can help set the dial, aligning it with a watch set to standard time. Corrections for the equation of time and local time differences can be made by adjusting the dial until it matches the watch time. Standard time corrections for longitude differences can be calculated by dividing the longitude difference by 15. The weapons shown in the illustrations are made from wood, with steel parts covered in tinfoil. A French partisan from the 16th century had a crimson cloth-covered handle studded with brass nails, while a German military fork had a spiral cord-bound handle painted dark and tinfoil-covered points.|['1.

A sixteenth-century Italian ranseur is depicted in Fig. 8. This weapon measures around 6 ft. in length and features a circular handle. The metal part, spanning from the spear's tip to where it connects with the handle, is 15 in. The spear is made of sharp steel on its outer edges. In Fig. 9, a tilting lance with a vamplate, used in tournaments during the same century, is shown. The wooden pole is cloth-covered or painted dark, with a four-pronged steel piece at the end. The vamplate can be crafted from cardboard covered in tinfoil to mimic steel and adorned with brass nails. The total length is 9 ft. For a convenient ladle, attach a handle to an old stove leg and break off the piece that fastens it to the stove. The rounded leg part serves as the ladle's bowl, ideal for melting babbitt or lead. Craft decorative draperies at home using bamboo, glass beads, or rolled paper for durability and aesthetic appeal.

To assemble the stove, start by attaching the binding-posts at D on the base, along with the switch B and the fuse block C. Holes are bored in the base for the wire connections. The reverse side of the base, shown in Fig. 3, has slits for the wires. Glass tubes marked BB, holes marked AA leading to the switch, and the fuse block marked C are all part of the setup. The wires pass through the glass tubes GG in Fig. 4, projecting about 1 inch for connections. To determine the correct length of the resistance wire, wind it tightly around a large clay or drain tile, leaving space between each turn. Place the tile on its side with support at each end. Connect fuse wire to the ends and test the wire with a 5-ampere fuse wire. Adjust the length if needed until the wire glows dull red. Finally, mold fire clay in the first plate, connect the coil, and assemble the stove without wires touching.|['Question 1:\nWhat is attached at point D on the base to assemble the stove?\nA) Glass tubes GG\nB) Switch B\nC) Holes marked AA\nD) Wires\nE) Clay tile', 'Question 2:\nWhere are holes bored in the base for wire connections during the assembly of the stove?\nA) Point D\nB) Glass tubes GG\nC) Fuse block C\nD) Slits on the reverse side\nE) Point AA', 'Question 3:\nHow should the resistance wire be wound to determine the correct length during the stove assembly?\nA) Loosely around a large clay tile\nB) Tightly around a small stone\nC) Tightly around a large clay tile\nD) Loosely around a drain tile\nE) Loosely around a large stone', 'Question 4:\nWhat is used to test the wire during the stove assembly process?\nA) 10-ampere fuse wire\nB) 5-ampere fuse wire\nC) Glass tubes GG\nD) Clay tile\nE) Switch B', 'Question 5:\nWhat should be done to the wire length if it does not glow dull red during testing?\nA) Connect to the fuse block\nB) Wind it loosely around the tile\nC) Adjust the length\nD) Connect to the coil\nE) Wind it tightly around a stone', 'Question 6:\nWhat material should be molded in the first plate as the final step of assembling the stove?\nA) Glass tubes GG\nB) Fire clay\nC) Wire connections\nD) Fuse block C\nE) Switch B']|['B) Switch B', 'D) Slits on the reverse side', 'C) Tightly around a large clay tile', 'B) 5-ampere fuse wire', 'C) Adjust the length', 'B) Fire clay']
To dry out the packing thoroughly, it's important to set it aside in a warm place for a few days. This prevents steam formation when the current is applied. Avoid leaving it heated in this state. When cooking, use the top plate and remove it when making toast. To separate baked dough from pie pans easily, use a cutter made from heavy tin in the same outline as the pan's inside. For quick print drying, create a cheesecloth stretcher on a light wood frame. This allows air to enter from both top and bottom, ensuring rapid drying. Additionally, a handy tip for amateur photographers is to use an envelope to create a funnel that fits bottles perfectly, preventing spills.|"['1.

Two supports, each 1/2 inch thick and 3 inches high, are attached with screws halfway between the base's end and the upright B, as seen in Fig. 1. The supports are viewed from the end in Fig. 2 at GG. A 1/8-inch hole is drilled through the top of each support to align with the axle. The axle, a 1/8-inch diameter steel piece about 4 inches long, has a bent offset in the middle for the crank. A small flywheel is fixed at one end. The wooden connecting rod E is fastened to the upper end of the driving arm D with a small screw or nail. A copper strip, 1/4 inch wide, marked as contact F, is used to open and close the circuit during engine operation. The setup is connected as depicted in Fig. 1. By connecting two dry cells to the binding posts and turning the flywheel, the current through the magnet pulls the driving arm towards the bolt head, rotating the shaft halfway. The shaft's movement pulls the arm away from the copper strip F, breaking the current. As the shaft rotates, the arm reconnects with the copper strip F, repeating the cycle at each revolution.|['1.

To create a functional and visually appealing roost for pots, follow these steps: Secure a board to a 10 to 12 ft. post, bracing it with lath or wooden strips. For a rustic look, use twigs or branches as braces. Avoid placing the gas meter in warm areas to prevent gas expansion, which can inflate bills. Gas expands by 1/491 of its volume for each degree Fahrenheit of heat. To make household ornaments and grills, use sash cord, glue, paraffin, and paint. Design patterns on a board with nails, coat lines with paraffin, and wrap soaked cord around them. Experiment with different designs for creative results. For a simple water filter, cover a lamp chimney with cheese cloth, stuff cotton inside, and pour water through it on a wood shelf. The cotton will trap impurities, providing clear, clean water.|['1.

To create intricate armor pieces like the fifteenth-century chamfron or the seventeenth-century gauntlet, you'll need to start by preparing a mass of clay that is easily moldable. Keep the clay moist and well kneaded. Use a modeling board to shape the clay, ensuring it's the right size for your project. Once your clay model is ready, cover it with a thin layer of olive oil. Then, soak brown wrapping paper in a water and size solution. Carefully place the wet paper on the clay model, pressing it into all the details. Apply multiple layers of paper and glue, allowing each layer to dry before adding the next. Trim any excess paper, sand the surface, and add tinfoil for a metallic look. For gauntlets and breastplates, follow similar steps, adjusting for the specific design details.|['1.

In Figure 5, an arrangement is displayed to reduce clay usage. A triangular-shaped support, customizable in size, is placed on a rough modeling board or bench and covered with clay. This method makes the model lightweight and easy to move, needing less clay. Figures 6 and 7 show clay models ready for brown paper patches. Figure 8 exhibits a German fluted armor from the 16th century. The breastplate and tassets are recommended to be made separately for convenience and later joined with glue. A narrow leather belt conceals the joint. Fluted armor features grooves down the plate. Figure 9 displays a board useful for marking fluted lines. A glass bottle with a rubber stopper and brass rod, aluminum foil pieces, and a brass ball is assembled for testing objects. Lastly, a tip-up device for signaling fish bites is crafted from a pine board.|"['1.

To set up a fishing line using a tip-up, bait the fishhook and hang it on the short end of the tip-up. When a fish bites, the other end will tip up, signaling the fisherman. Multiple holes can be drilled in the ice, each with a tip-up, allowing one person to manage several lines. To create a design on wood, trace the outline onto thin wood using carbon paper and secure it with thumb tacks. Use any wood like basswood or pine. To color the design, burn soft wood with a pyrography tool or carve a groove around it. Stain leaves green and flower petals red using wood dye. Finish by staining the background brown and applying wax for a polished look. Protect your fingers from stains by coating them with a wax made of white wax and olive oil. This wax also helps photographers. For a trapeze with rings and a swing, drill holes in the crosspiece for ropes to pass through easily and tie them securely. Sandpaper any sharp edges for safety.|['1.

A wooden base, 1/2 inch thick, 2 inches wide, and 5 inches long, serves as the foundation for this instrument. Two 1-inch wire nails act as the cores of the magnets. Each nail is wrapped with three or four layers of fine insulated magnet wire, approximately No. 25 gauge, similar to what's used in electric bells. Leaving 1/4 inch of the end exposed allows them to be driven into the wood base. The coils' connections are illustrated in the diagram at A. Behind the coils, a small wooden block is affixed, aligning with the nails' tops. A tin piece shaped like the letter T is secured with two screws atop this block, slightly bent to clear the nails' tops by 1/32 inch. The key lever, cut from thin wood, is pivoted in a slotted block serving as the key's base. Copper wire runs along the key's underside, acting as a contact. A rubber band over the key's end, attached to the base, functions as a spring to keep the key open. Tin beneath the key's knob facilitates contact between the key's copper and the coil wires when the key is pressed down.|"['1.

To create a unique fob, start by tying four shoestrings together with a small string in the middle. Weave the layers in a crisscross pattern, leaving a loop in the center for attaching it to a watch. Once the weaving is done, create tassel ends and shape the fob into a horseshoe using a stiff wire. This process is similar to leatherworking techniques where you can use tools to create designs on leather. Another method involves outlining the design on sheepskin using a pyrographer's outfit. You can also trace a design on sheep or goat skin using carbon paper and apply stains for a colorful finish. To smooth out an iron for this project, rub a cloth with wax over the heated surface. Additionally, if you need to mail coins securely, wrap them in heavy paper following a specific folding pattern to prevent edges from cutting through the envelope.|"['1.

The intricate design on the frame is both simple and effective, according to Work, London. The scrolls are connected to the frame using 3/16-inch round-head machine screws. The leaf decoration at the end of the scroll is crafted by shaping and embossing the metal. The metal for the scrolls is 3/16 inch thick and 1/2 inch wide. The leaf design is created by shaping the metal at a welding heat and then forming it into a leaf shape using a chisel and files. The central part is made from colored glass specifically designed for leaded work. The design is outlined in lead, and it is crucial to ensure the lead has a symmetrical shape. The design should be drawn to scale on heavy paper, and the spaces for the glass pieces should be cut out to match the exact size and shape needed. These paper patterns are then used to mark and cut the glass pieces. The glass, lead, border, and special flux can be bought from an art glass shop.|['1.

To prevent slipping of noseglasses due to excessive perspiration, individuals can apply chalk to the sides of the nose bridge before wearing the glasses. This simple trick ensures the glasses stay in place even in warm weather. In case the chalk is visible, a pink stick from an art school or supply store can be used as an alternative. Gummed paper, often used for labels, can be improvised by utilizing the gummed parts of unsealed envelopes received with circulars. These envelope flaps can be repurposed to create sizable labels. In a scenario where a phonograph spring breaks and immediate replacement is not feasible, a practical repair method involves heating and shaping the broken ends with tongs to create hooks that can be joined together. This repair technique restores the spring's functionality without compromising its strength. Additionally, a simple trick to determine if the doorbell or telephone rings in one's absence is to place a small rider of paper or cardboard on the clapper, which will be displaced if the bell rings. The lathe is a crucial machine in modern woodworking shops, with countless applications in various mechanical operations. A homemade lathe can be constructed using a 1-inch pipe as the bed, tees for the headstock, and brass bearings.

The tailstock for a machine is crafted using two tees connected by a nipple. The lower tee is bored to slide smoothly on the bed pipe, while the upper tee is tapped for the spindle, threaded to fit it. The spindle has a handle at one end and is bored at the other end for the tailstock center. Both centers must be hardened. A clamp, made from strap iron, secures the tailstock spindle and is fastened with a machine screw and knurled nut. The tee requires a slot cut halfway through and a bead filed away for a snug fit of the clamp. Detailed sketches make construction easy for young mechanics.

I read about beach automobiles used on the Florida coast, like ice boats with sails but with wheels instead of runners. I decided to create something for country roads. I used seven fence pickets as the frame and improvised with other items as needed. I joined two rake handles for the mast, using wire to secure them. A single long piece would be better. The gaff, to which the sail is attached, is a broomstick, and the boom at the bottom of the sail is a combination of a rake handle and broomstick. I fashioned a mainsail from a sheet provided by my mother. The front wheel is from an old bicycle, and the rear wheels are cast-off bicycle wheels. I steer with the front wheel and an iron bar between the rear wheels, costing a total of 20 cents.|['1.

To create a simple lamp at home, take a glass tumbler and fill it partly with water. Add about 1/2 inch of safe, light-burning oil on top of the water. Cut a thin strip from a cork, make a hole in the center, and insert a short wick. The wick should dip into the oil but not reach the water. Protect the cork's upper surface from the flame with a small piece of bent tin, creating a hole for the wick. The weight of the tin will push the cork into the oil. Ensure the oil level is such that the flame stays below the tumbler's top to prevent it from being blown out by drafts. This setup is safe; if the glass tips over, the water extinguishes the flame.|"[""1.

To create a small windmill with significant power, start by selecting a straight-grained piece of white pine that is about 1/4 inch thick, 3/4 inch wide, and 4 inches long. Lay out the desired design and carefully cut the divisions thin with a sharp knife, ensuring not to split the wood through the handle area. Soak the wood in hot water to soften it for easy splitting. Assemble the pieces by placing them over each other to form the fan ornament. The windmill's smaller parts, like blades and pulleys, can be made from 1-inch sugar pine due to its softness. Attach the blades to a 6-inch diameter, 1-inch thick circular face plate, leaving the hub end uncut. Use a 1/4-inch iron rod as the shaft, 2 feet long, and secure it in bearings for smooth rotation. This windmill can generate considerable power even in light breezes.|"[""1.

Water bicycles provide an enjoyable activity that can be constructed using materials often discarded as trash. Oil barrels are the essential material needed for building a water bicycle, as they are sturdy and airtight. Grocers may offer oil barrels at a low cost, sometimes in exchange for small tasks like making deliveries. Three barrels are typically required, although it can be done with just two. The construction involves arranging the barrels like bicycle wheels and adding a wooden shaft through them to connect the platform of the frame. The craft is propelled by paddles attached to the rear barrels. Steering is achieved by leaning to the right or left. The craft is safe due to the airtight barrels that prevent sinking. Additionally, the passage introduces how to make a small searchlight using materials like a 4-volt lamp, brass, and copper, which can be attached to a boat for added visibility during night voyages.|['1.

To assemble the lamp, first, ensure the trunnion slightly protrudes into the cylinder. Then, use small wood blocks to position the lamp, as depicted in Fig. 1, before soldering the lamp wires to the trunnions. It's advisable to solder the wires before cementing the side blocks inside the cylinder. Craft a wooden circle (A, Fig. 2) to fit snugly inside the cylinder; attach a mirror piece (C, Fig. 2) of the same size for reflection. Enhance the wood with white enamel or polished metal. Affix a brass handle (B, Fig. 2) at the back for easy removal. Create two brass wire rings to fit inside the cylinder tightly. Cut a glass disc matching the cylinder's diameter using a glass cutter on cardboard. Insert one brass ring, then the glass disc, followed by the second ring. For the stand, fill copper piping with melted rosin or lead, shape it around wood, and remove the rosin or lead. Create an incision for wires with a file. Design a wooden base (Fig. 1) with holes for the copper pipe and wires.

To make an arrow sling, find a branch of ash around 1/2 inch thick. Remove the bark and cut a notch at one end. Tie a strong cord, about 2-1/2 feet long, in the notch with a large knot at the other end. The arrows used are similar to crossbow arrows, but with a small notch cut into them. To throw the arrow, insert the cord near the knot into the arrow's notch, grasp the stick with your right hand, and hold the arrow's wing with your left. With a quick slinging motion, throw the arrow. With practice, the arrow can be thrown several hundred feet. For a makeshift safe light, use an empty cigar box. Remove the bottom, nail it in place, replace one end, and drive a nail through the opposite end for a candle seat. Cover the aperture with yellow paper to prevent light leakage.

In the woods, when suitable trees are scarce, the Indian wigwam is the simplest camp to construct. Three long poles tied together at the top and spaced apart at the bottom form the frame. Branches and brush are woven in and out of these poles to create a roof that effectively sheds heavy rain. For a brush camp, a ridge pole is supported by crotched uprights, with slanting poles on each side covered in cedar or hemlock boughs. In areas with abundant bark, a bark lean-to can be quickly built by laying slanting poles against a ridge pole and covering them with bark or brush. For a comfortable bed, small boughs and twigs of evergreen trees can be piled deep and covered with blankets. To hang kettles over a campfire, a simple crane can be made by splitting the tops of two posts and laying a pole across them. Other useful camp implements can be fashioned from materials found in the woods.|['1.

Campers often use boxes to store their food during camping trips. These boxes can easily be transformed into cupboards by adding shelves, hinges, and even a basic lock. To create a camp table, set four posts into the ground and attach crosspieces to support slabs cut from wood logs as the tabletop. Additional pieces can be nailed to the table legs to serve as seats for multiple people. Another useful camping item is a makeshift heater using a half barrel lined with paper and flannel cloth, with a cover on top and a hole at the bottom for a jug of hot water to maintain warmth. A clever trick to fix a split faucet during cold weather is to insert a cork into the end and secure it back in place.

To create the armature for a machine, you will need supports with drilled holes for a brass rod. These supports should be soldered in place after the armature is built. To ensure a smooth fit, wrap paper around the armature ring, insert it through the field opening, and add bearings to the shaft. If the holes are misaligned, adjust them with a file. Once the bearings are in place, solder them securely. Check that the armature spins freely without touching the field. Remove the supports, finish the soldering, and turn the shaft in a lathe. The armature's core should be built using wrought sheet iron, riveted together, annealed, and bored to fit a brass spider. The spider secures the armature shaft, ensuring it remains steady during finishing. Finally, turn the armature to the correct size and shape.|"['1.

To sharpen tools effectively, use kerosene on oil stones instead of heavier oil. This oil helps remove loose particles from the stone's edge, preventing damage to the tools being sharpened. Always keep the stone well-oiled for smooth cutting. For a steady light, a lamp is recommended, but it requires maintenance. Enhance the lamp's performance by adding a small camphor lump to the oil vessel. This will improve the light quality. If camphor is unavailable, add a few drops of vinegar occasionally. To make a camera inexpensively, repurpose a cigar box. Trim the box to have 4-inch square ends and leave the lid hinged. Attach small wooden strips inside to hold the camera plate securely. Follow the diagram for placement instructions.|"['1.

Let's learn about the essential parts of a camera, specifically the pinhole and shutter. The camera's pinhole is like the lens in more expensive cameras. To make it, take a thin brass piece and bore holes in each corner to attach it to the camera. Then, drill a hole in the center for the pinhole. Use a needle to gently create the pinhole. The shutter is a small brass piece that covers the pinhole, with a knob at the bottom. It swings to open and close the hole. A wire frame acts as a finder to help you aim the camera. To take a photo, insert a sensitive plate, secure the lid, and set the exposure time. Hold the camera steady during the exposure to avoid blurry pictures. After exposure, remove the plate carefully for developing and printing in a dark room.|['1.

To explain how a pinhole camera works, look at Fig. 2. In the diagram, F is the front of the camera, D is the pinhole, AA is the plate, and RR represents rays from a candle. Light rays spread in all directions from the candle, and similar rays come from every point of an object. Some rays hit the pinhole, shown as RRRR, pass through it, and reach the plate AA, creating an inverted image. Only one ray from each point in an object can pass through the tiny pinhole. If a screen interrupts these selected rays, it shows an inverted picture. By using a light-sensitive plate, a photographic image can be produced. The clock mechanism can be modified to create a unique clock with a lever and metal strip. Dry batteries can be revived by pouring saltwater or sal ammoniac solution into small holes on top of the battery.|['1.

To create a simple and effective alarm system, a string can be attached across a door or window. Any movement of the string will trigger it to touch a contact point on the right. If the string is cut or broken, a spring will pull a lever to the contact point on the left, completing the circuit. In case of a fire, burning the string will also activate the alarm. For making crutches, split two broom handles close to the end and soak them in water to make them pliable for bending. Attach grips to each stick at the right distance, securing them with wire and rivets. Add pieces to the upper ends of the handles for support. To craft trouser hangers, bend a piece of sheet metal and attach a wire hook for hanging. Insert the trousers between the jaws of the hanger for a secure hold.|['1.

In the past, crafting with wood has evolved into more advanced and profitable metal construction work. Nowadays, metal brackets, lamp stands, gates, and other decorative pieces can be made in a small workshop at home. To start, you need basic tools like an anvil, a vise, and a bell hammer for cold bending. For hot bending, additional equipment is necessary. Metal strips, about 1/2 inch wide and 1/8 inch thick, can be bought at hardware stores or ironworks. These strips can sometimes be found inexpensively at junk dealers. By following simple techniques like square and rounded bends, various metal items can be created. A popular item to make is a bracket, which can be enhanced with curves for a more decorative look. Once the metal pieces are crafted, they can be coated with asphaltum or paint for a finishing touch.|['1.

To create loops or circles in metalwork, a bar of iron or steel, about 2 inches in diameter and several feet long, is needed. This bar is placed on a sturdy base and then hammered to bend it into the desired shape. With practice, almost any circle can be formed using these tools. The bar can be purchased for around 40 cents from iron dealers or found cheaper in junk shops. For shaping strip metal into brackets, fences, or gates, a base block of hard wood with a groove to fit the bar securely is essential. Caps can be added over the bar and screwed into the base for stability. These tools can be used to create a variety of metal pieces. Young individuals can even take orders for sign brackets or lamp-supporting contrivances, like the ones shown in the illustrations.|['1.

Designs of grate fronts, like Figure 11, serve various purposes for grate fires. The rings in the design are connected by rivets. Thin metal can have holes punched with an iron punch and hammer on an anvil. For thicker metal, a drill is needed. After drilling, parts are assembled, rivets inserted, and sides joined. The top points are filed down after joining. Rough spots are smoothed with a file and painted for a finish. Asphaltum gives a black finish, while some designs are bronzed or silvered based on customer preference. Figure 15 has a similar ring shaping process. Heating metal is crucial for shaping, achieved by a coke fire and blowpipe. Fig. 16 features wire screen work, and Fig. 17 shows a chipping off device for cutting metal. Bending cold with a wooden form, as in Fig. 18, completes the process.|['1. What is the purpose of the designs of grate fronts mentioned in the passage?\nA. To hang decorative items\nB.

Figure 19 displays a unique wood bending form called the hour-glass form. To create this form, start by selecting a 6-inch square piece of hard wood and bore a hole through it with a 1-inch bit. Shape the hole to resemble an hour-glass shape. This view is a sectional one. Place the block in a vise and insert the metal strip for bending at point T. By grasping the strip at point W and applying pressure, you can bend it into various forms. Figure 20 showcases a different type of fireplace front made by uniting shaped metal pieces. Once you start, you can create a wide range of designs. To calculate the price of the grate, add up the costs of the parts and charge around 12 cents per hour for the work. An overshot water wheel, as shown in Figure 1, can generate considerable power. This wheel, about 24 inches in diameter and 10 inches wide, can produce 2 to 4 horsepower if there is enough water flow. This power can be used to run sewing machines, fans, and fret-saws.|['1.

"The passage above was found in a daily newspaper at our office. It was titled ""A Clever Boy."" While we're unsure of the identity of this boy, we knew another equally clever boy who found a unique way to estimate the height of a tree. Instead of waiting for the sun to shine at a specific angle, he used a stick to create a right-angled triangle with himself as the base, the stick as the perpendicular, and the line of sight as the hypotenuse. By aligning the stick's top with the tree's top, he could determine the tree's height without needing sunlight.

There are numerous ways to renew dry batteries. One effective method involves drilling holes in the zinc, soaking it in a sal ammoniac solution for 48 hours, then plugging the holes with hard soap. This process can restore the battery's strength almost to its original level. Another interesting project is creating a wire puzzle where the challenge is to remove a ring from a triangle by manipulating the pieces. For repairing box cameras, reinforcing with strong black cloth can strengthen weak joints. Additionally, shotgun cartridges can be repurposed to make a box for small items like fishhooks or matches. A simple camping cup can be fashioned from a tomato or baking-powder can by attaching a wire handle.

Ice boating is a classic northern sport that is making a comeback in popularity. Boys can easily craft their own ice boat using old skates, pieces of board, and a sheet or canvas. The boat's frame should resemble a kite, with a center-board and a cross board securely fastened together. Skates are attached to the sides and rear end to act as runners and a rudder. Making your own sled is a rewarding project, as hand-made sleds are often better than store-bought ones. A simple sled can be made from two barrel staves and three pieces of board, perfect for coasting and carrying snow. For added fun, the sled can be transformed into a chair-sleigh by adding a chair on top, making it ideal for rides over the ice with a companion.|"['1.

In snowy conditions, toboggan sleds are perfect for exciting winter sports. Unlike regular sleds that get stuck in deep snow, toboggans smoothly glide over the soft surface with ease. To create a toboggan sled, you will need two thin boards, each 10 ft. long and 1 ft. wide. Place the boards next to each other and connect them with cross sticks, ensuring the screws are deep enough to create a smooth bottom surface. Add side bars to the cross sticks and secure them firmly. Use strong strings or slender steel rods to keep the boards bent and tie them to the front crossbar. In Canada, toboggan slides are a popular choice among boys for winter fun. Similarly, skis are used by Norwegians for various activities like racing and jumping in snowy terrains. Skis can be made from barrel staves by bending and securing them with straps for a thrilling winter adventure.|['1. What is the main advantage of toboggan sleds in snowy conditions?\nA.

Many individuals have old wooden beds tucked away that can effortlessly transform into useful settees, as illustrated in the photo. Besides the bed itself, only a few nails and half a dozen 3-inch screws are required. Simple tools like a saw, hammer, and screwdriver are necessary. The headboard can be trimmed if too tall, and some decorations can be replaced. The footboard should be cut in half to create the ends or arms of the settee. The side rails and some slats are used for the seat. To make enamel, combine 2 ounces of burnt umber with 1 quart of boiled oil, then add 1 ounce of asphaltum. Apply the enamel with a camel's hair brush, bake at 250°F for 6-8 hours, rub with steel wool, apply a finishing coat, bake at 250°F for 8 hours, varnish, and bake at 200°F. Gradually heat and cool the frame each time. Black enamel is easiest and requires 300°F, while colors need 200-250°F. If a camel's hair brush is not available, a new one can be bought for 25 cents. Remove the top, make a bag, attach it to the crosspieces, add pockets, and use brass nails and leather handles. Old carpet sweeper wheels can be repurposed for roller skates by attaching iron washers with sheet metal.|['1.

The playground trolley line shown in the sketch provided a fun and affordable activity for many children. It consisted of a sturdy wire, tested for strength, stretched between a tree and a barn. The wire could be unhooked and coiled in the barn when not in use. A rope was used to make the wire taut for play. The trolley itself, made from strips of wood and pulleys, provided a smooth ride. The wheels were carefully assembled with stove bolts and greased to keep them running smoothly. This coaster was a safe and enjoyable activity for kids, with the wire hanging low and at a moderate slant to prevent any serious falls.|['1.

Last winter, I had a routine of tending to the furnace in our house each evening. At 9 o'clock, I would head down to the basement to fill the furnace with coal for the night. This task took about twenty to thirty minutes. To make this process easier, I decided to create a device that would automatically close the draft door once the coal was in and the furnace was burning well. The device consisted of cords, pulleys, an iron piece, a hinge, a release mechanism, a coil of wire, an armature, a U-tube filled with mercury, a glass flask, an overflow tube, a battery, and platinum points. By pulling a cord upstairs, the draft door would open, and as the furnace heated up, the mercury in the U-tube would trigger a mechanism to close the door. This invention worked smoothly throughout the winter, providing a hassle-free way to manage the furnace.|"['1.

Glass minnow traps can be easily crafted using common household items. To create one, start by sealing a wire inside a glass tube using pliers. Heat the glass until soft and bend it gently. Next, dissolve 4 oz. of zinc sulfate in 10 gallons of water, add 1/2 lb. of sal-soda and 1/2 oz. of tartaric acid. Soak the tent cover in this solution for 24 hours. Hang it up to dry without wringing it. For the trap, use a one or two-quart fruit jar and a round neck bottle to create a glass funnel as the trap's mouthpiece. Bind copper wire around the jar's neck to secure the funnel in place. This DIY trap can be as effective as store-bought ones and can save money and time.|"[""1.

"To catch ""kellies"" or ""killies,"" use crushed clams or salt-water mussels in the trap. For fresh water shiners, opt for mincemeat or bread crumbs. Avoid spilling bait outside the trap. Keep the trap submerged for ten to fifteen minutes. When resetting after emptying, return one or two caught fish to entice others. For a butterfly kite, get two equal-length thin kite sticks. Tie strong string to each end of the sticks, leaving one end free to hook over the hemisphere formed by the string and stick. Secure two heavy broom straws or wires for antennae. Choose colored paper, cut it around the frame, leaving a margin for pasting. Decorate with paint or colored paper strips. Attach the belly-band and tail for flight.

To create the breast band, punch holes in the paper by each leg stick's side, just above the bottom, and by each arm stick's side at the shoulder. Thread one string end through the hole at the left leg's bottom and tie it to the leg stick; tie the other end at the right shoulder. Start another string of equal length at the right leg's bottom; pass it up across the first band and tie the other end at the left shoulder. Connect the kite string to the breast band where the two strings meet. Adjust the kite string up or down by knotting it. Make the lady appear to dance and kick in the clouds by fashioning stiff pasteboard feet that hang loose from the skirt's bottom line. The feet will move with the kite's motion. Obtain India rubber specially made for stamp-making for best results. While amateurs can experiment with preparing rubber, the outcome may be uncertain. The base of the press should be iron with drilled holes on opposite sides for bolts to pass through. The platen should be iron and swing off the bolts. Use nuts to create pressure between the platen and upper nut. Prepare the mold by using large type with wide spaces set up with high quads and spaces.

To make a rubber stamp, first, cut a piece of rubber from a sheet and coat it with talc powder. Dust some powder over the matrix. Heat a press over a gas burner or lamp. Place the matrix on the press base, add the rubber, and screw down the platen. Heat to 284 deg. F. and press the rubber into the matrix until it's soft. No thermometer is needed; watch for the rubber to protrude. Once it's vulcanized, remove the sheet. Fasten the stamp to a handle with glue. For small projects, a flat iron can replace the press. Rub your feet on a carpet, touch a wire near a gas burner, and watch the flame ignite. Build a small trap with a lever and trigger to catch game.|['1.

I inherited an antique chair over a century old, originally green but painted over with dark varnish in the last 30 years. Wanting to enhance its look, I decided to strip the paint and give it a mahogany stain. Regular paint removers didn't work on the original green coat. Eventually, I used a hot lye solution, applying it multiple times over two days and scrubbing with a stiff brush to completely remove the layer. To secure windows together, bore a hole through the lower window sash and halfway into the upper sash, then insert a nail or spike. This makeshift lock can only be opened with a crowbar. You can repurpose a burnt-out 16-cp incandescent lamp into a magnifying glass by filling the globe with water.

Blades for windmills can be made from sheet metal or thin hardwood. The size of the blades should match the wheel's capacity and the available space on the spokes. Each blade should be angled to catch the wind's force, making the wheel spin when the wind is strong. To attach the blades to the spokes, use small metal cleats C and D. Shape these metal strips to fit the spokes and flatten against the blades, then secure them with screws. For sheet metal blades, use rivets for fastening. The stand for the wheel shaft is shown in Fig. 2. Start by arranging the base piece J in a platform order. Place the circular seat I on top of the base piece, resembling an inverted cheese box cover with the center removed. This ring, made by a tinner, helps the mill base catch the wind efficiently. The X-shaped piece H, marked as S in Fig. 5, fits into the tin rim. Use two 2-inch planks to form the X shape, mortising them together for a sturdy joint. Support the wheel shaft with 4 by 4-inch hard pine pieces mortised into the X-pieces at E, E in Fig. 2.|"['1.

In this project, a cart is propelled using a chain mechanism. The chain is marked F and passes through a slot in the cart's floor to reach the cog on the propelling shaft crank. The steering rod is connected to a disk at G, while the driving shaft details are shown in Fig. 3. The sprocket wheel at H is taken from an original bicycle shaft. Bearings are made by looping wires around the shaft and inserting them into metal plates screwed to the cart's bottom. The steering gear disk, shown in Fig. 4, is bored for securing screws and the steering rod. Typically, three boys ride the cart - one steers, and two turn the crank. This cart can carry freight, and some boys even run a small business with carts they build themselves.|"['1.

To set up the lathe, start by using a board that is 32 inches long and as wide as the base of the machine arm. This board should be leveled with the rest of the machine table using legs if necessary. Create a T-rail by combining two boards, one measuring 5 by 3/4 by 32 inches, and the other 3-1/2 by 3/4 by 32 inches. Nail or screw them firmly together, ensuring that the wider board projects over each of the smaller boards. Attach this rail to the machine board so that its center aligns perfectly with the machine centers. Drill several 3/8-inch holes along the center line of this rail, spaced 2-3/4 inches apart. Another T-rail for the slide tool rest can be made using two pieces of 32 by 3 by 3/4 inches and 32 by 1-1/2 by 3/4 inches. Fasten this rail in front of the larger T-rail, parallel to it, with the center lines 6-1/2 inches apart.

To create a switch, gather a piece of slate for the base, two brass strips, a rubber strip with a handle, and binding-posts from old dry batteries. Attach the brass strips at points 5 and 6 so they can swing between points 1 and 3 to 2 and 4. Use the hard rubber strip and screws to keep the brass strips apart. Be cautious not to let the screws penetrate the rubber strip entirely to avoid potential shocks. Attach a rubber handle to the rubber strip for easy movement of the lever. Refer to Fig. 2 for a detailed view of the setup and Fig. 3 for an end view. Bronze bearings can be cleaned by running a solution of washing powder and water through the oil cups while the machine is running without any load. A glass of water can serve as an emergency candlestick by weighting one end of the candle with a nail and lighting it. When filing soft metals, like solder, ensure to oil the file frequently to prevent clogging and maintain smooth work.

Various methods can be used to finish metal. One way is to polish it with substances like powdered pumice, chalk, or charcoal, followed by a coat of French varnish diluted with alcohol. Another technique involves creating a bluish-green background effect by applying a solution of muriate of ammonia, carbonate of ammonia, and water multiple times before varnishing to preserve the colors. To make an easel, smooth down four pieces of pine to create legs and cross-pieces, then join them together. Attach a peg to each leg for the picture to rest on.

An electric bell can be connected to multiple push buttons in a circuit. These buttons are placed in different areas of a building, so an electric annunciator is used to show which button was pressed to activate the bell. The annunciator can indicate signals sent over its connected circuits. To make a simple annunciator, first, draw a circuit diagram. In a basic circuit with two push buttons, an annunciator with two indications is needed. When a push button is pressed, the circuit is completed through the magnet, causing an armature to move and indicate which button was pressed. The magnets from a discarded electric bell can be used for this purpose. Mount the magnets on non-magnetic material and connect them to the board to create the annunciator.|['1.

To build the annunciator, start by drilling a hole in the center of a piece so a rod can pass through it. Then, attach the armature to a board using small wood screws. Cut the rod to project about 5/8 inch through the annunciator's face. Create an indicator from thin brass and attach it to the rod. Construct the case by cutting pieces of oak to form the sides, back, and face. Make grooves in the sides and lower end to fit a piece of window glass. Fasten the works to the case with brass screws. Mount the case using sheet brass pieces and screws. Add binding posts to the top for terminals. Connect the magnet windings to the binding posts. Customize the case to match the room's decor. The indicator's movement depends on the magnets' cores and armature distance.|"[""1.

To create an indicator that moves significantly with the armature shaft, mount a small gear wheel on the armature shaft. Then, attach a smaller gear to engage with the first gear and fix the indicator to the shaft of the smaller gear. This setup ensures that any movement of the armature shaft causes a noticeable movement of the indicator shaft. The gears' arrangement is depicted in Figure 11. The valves are placed 1 inch apart in a straight line along the pipe, as shown in Figure 2. To make whistles, cut pieces of pipe of varying lengths, similar to a pipe organ. Thread both ends of each pipe, cap one end, and insert a plug in the other end with a filed-out portion and a notch. Screw the pipes into the valves. Experiment with cutting pipe lengths or adding melted lead to adjust the whistle's tone. Connect the 1-inch pipe to a steam pipe, possibly from a range boiler in a brick or sheet iron fireplace. Make sure to attach a small safety valve. The keys and valve operation are detailed in Figure 3. This simple explanation should clarify the process.|"[""1.

A useful tool can be created by repurposing an old push broom. Remove the bristles from one end and shape the wood to be longer than a window's width. Cut a groove in the wood to insert a rib. Sew oilcloth pieces to fit over the ends of the roller. Lay a curtain across the groove and press the rib and curtain into it. Cover the rib ends with oilcloth bands to secure them in place. An old umbrella rib can be fashioned into a bracket to hold a gas jet. The rib ends are bent to fit around the pendant upright, with one end shaped into a hook for support. To keep cut flowers fresh, add a pinch of pure sodium salt to the water. Glass tubing, a Bunsen burner, and a blowpipe make for a fun and educational gift. Glass becomes malleable under heat and can be shaped into various forms. A Bunsen burner produces a clean, hot flame for glasswork. If gas is unavailable, an alcohol lamp can be used. The blowpipe helps direct a small flame for precise work. Additionally, round sticks of charcoal are essential tools for glass shaping. Glass tubing can be bent by heating it and blowing air gently while shaping it.|"['1.

To create a bulb at the end of a glass tube, start by closing one end of the tube. Heat the glass and pull it apart to form a tapered end. Heat this tapered end and press it into the tube until it's closed and as thick as the rest of the tube. Heat about an inch of the tube evenly and blow into the open end to expand the glass into a bulb. These bulbs can be used as flasks for experiments. To join two glass tubes, heat the ends and flare them using charcoal. Then, heat both flared ends, press them together, and pull slightly to flatten and join them. For a T-joint, heat one tube with a closed end until a small hole forms due to expanding air. Enlarge the hole, flare it, and connect it to another tube to create the T-joint. To use a blowpipe effectively, puff air into your cheeks to blow consistently without stopping to refill your lungs.|['1. What is the first step in creating a bulb at the end of a glass tube?\nA.

Glass funnels for chemical operations are crafted by forming a bulb and piercing it at the top when hot using charcoal, then smoothing the edges. To create tiny glass tubes for capillary attraction experiments, heat a tube section in a flame, then swiftly pull the ends apart to form a fine thread of glass. Cutting glass tubing is done with a three-cornered file to nick where it needs cutting, then bending it until it breaks at the nick. This equipment can be bought from scientific apparatus dealers or druggists. Sailing catamarans are safe and ideal for sailing enthusiasts. Constructed from two pontoons with a platform, they are stable in rough waters. Pontoons are made from two boards, with spreaders to hold them together. For larger sizes, extend the pontoons by joining boards and adding battens. Ensure joints are sealed before fastening.|['1.

To build a sturdy platform for sailing, start by shaping the shell's outside line on the underside. Ensure the spreaders and sides fit well, then apply white lead on the joints and secure with finishing nails. Stagger the nails slightly on the sides for strength. Paint the joints and ends of the spreaders with two to three coats. Once both pontoons are finished, align them parallel. Attach blocks of wood on top of each pontoon directly above the spreaders to bolt the crosspieces securely. Use hickory or ash for the crosspieces, each 2-1/2 inches thick, 5 inches wide, and 6-1/2 feet long. Fasten maple flooring to the crosspieces with screws and washers, adding battens every 18 inches for support. Secure the flooring and crosspieces to the pontoons with long bolts through the spreaders, using rubber washers for flexibility. Adding sides will strengthen the platform, while a 12-inch dash can further protect from water and spray.|['1.

The rudders for the sailboat are crafted using a 2 ft. long iron rod split for 7 in. A metal plate is inserted and riveted in the split, leaving 3/4 in. of the rod to project. The bottom bracket, made from stake iron, forms a U shape to hold the rudder bearing. The top bracket is bent to connect the rod ends, creating a crosspiece to attach a rope. The mast and bowsprit are then connected to the front crosspiece, bracing them to the pontoons. For racing, sails of about 300 sq. ft. are ideal, while 175 to 200 sq. ft. sails are sufficient for cruising. Sailing on a bicycle requires understanding the wind's support, leaning against the wind instead of heeling over like a boat.

In this passage, we learn about creating a plug for electric light extension from an old electric globe. By removing the glass and composition, leaving only the wires, and attaching small binding posts to the wire ends, a plug is formed. Filling the brass receptacle with plaster of paris and keeping the wires separate, the binding posts are secured. Additionally, a wooden block with brass strips and binding posts can be used to create a circuit for a bell. By inserting beeswax between the brass strips to insulate and attaching a binding post to each strip, the device can be connected to batteries and bells. When the room overheats, the wax melts causing the brass strips to connect, completing the circuit and ringing the bell.|['1.

To create a print in relief, follow these steps as outlined by the Sketch, London. Begin by preparing a positive or transparency from the negative, using the same plate size. Place the positive in the frame with the film side out, then layer the negative on top with the film side up. Insert the paper and print, noting that it may take longer due to printing through double glass and films. For wireless communication between two points, dig a hole or well at each location. Use a long-distance transmitter and receiver at both ends, with a copper wire hanging in the opening. Attach a copper plate to the wire end and connect it to the telephone devices, batteries, and buried zinc plate. For durable belts, insert eyelets from old shoes into the lace holes to prevent tearing. To create a life buoy, sew two circular canvas pieces with cork filling and paint for waterproofing.|['1.

A fascinating invention is the wondergraph, a simple and affordable drawing machine that provides entertainment and learning opportunities for all ages. The wondergraph creates symmetrical and ornamental designs, some of which are incredibly intricate. The basic design of the wondergraph consists of three grooved circular disks mounted on a wide board or a discarded box bottom. These disks rotate freely around their centers, allowing for a wide range of design possibilities. A guide wheel and a driver wheel with an attached handle are used to control the movement of a fountain pen or pencil that creates the designs on drawing paper attached to the rotating disks. By turning the drive wheel, the pen moves smoothly over the paper, producing surprising and delightful results. Adjustments can be made to ensure the pen moves at the right speed and that the ink flows properly for clear and distinct designs.|['1.

To conduct an engaging experiment, start by using a skillet or spider with a smooth inner surface. Fill it with water to a depth of 1/2 inch. Cut a circular piece of cardboard to fit the bottom of the skillet and create a 4-inch diameter hole in the center. This hole should be 1 inch smaller than the can to be used. Place the cardboard in the skillet under the water. Use a 2-qt. syrup can or pail, or even a tomato can without indentations on the edge. Place the can upside down over the hole in the cardboard, ensuring it fits snugly. Apply a light weight on the can to keep it in place. Heat the skillet with the setup on a stove. As the can starts to move, remove the skillet from the heat. For quick results, cool the can's surface with snow, ice, or cold water until the sides flatten. Lift the entire setup by holding the can. When the vacuum forms, the can sides will collapse suddenly. This happens because the hole in the cardboard allows direct heat to expand the air in the can, which escapes through agitation, while the water and cardboard act as a valve. Once the air is expelled and a vacuum is created by cooling, the can collapses. This fun experiment can be customized by the operator. Another interesting experiment involves taking a self-portrait by using a mirror. This process is done in bright light. Set up the camera, focus, and prepare the plate|"['1.

When wires covered in cotton or silk connect bells and batteries, a coil in the wire makes it flexible. To create this coil, a short rod with a slit on one end to hold the wire and a loop on the other end is used. The North star's path is seen as the brightest arc in the circle, with neighboring stars leaving varying impressions. The North star is not directly out from the earth's axis, showing a 1-1/4 degree astronomical variation. The earth's axis changes slowly, with the pole star shifting over thousands of years. The North star is easy to find near the Great Dipper, with two stars marking the corners of the dipper pointing to it. To relight a match without burning fingers, hold the burnt end and place the other end in the flame. A hand drill can be made from a pegging awl and wire beater for light wood or metal work.|"['1.

Two curved surfaces are attached to an axle at right angles and a 45-degree angle to each other, shown in Fig. 2. This axle, along with wings, is placed in bearings on a stationary stand. Adding a pulley to the axle with the wings allows it to power toy machinery. Magnetism is used to demagnetize a watch, and frost can be drawn out of a frozen body part with snow. Heat can be drawn out of a burned hand by moving it away from a fire. An experiment demonstrates how a weak electric current can counteract a strong one. A method to electrocute a rat was discovered accidentally, resulting in a painless process. The setup included an induction coil with specific wire sizes and a bichromate of potash battery. By following a specific procedure, the rat could be temporarily immobilized and then revived.

The cannon is now finished, and the next step is to create a dummy dressed in old clothes. Begin by cutting two round blocks of hard pine or oak, each about 3 inches thick. These blocks should be slightly smaller in diameter than the cannon hole for easy sliding. Drill a 1/4-inch hole in the center of each block. Take a 4-foot iron rod, form a ring at one end, and thread the other end for 4 inches. Slide one block onto the rod, about 14 inches from the ring, secure it with a nut, and add the second block against the nut. Flatten the rod where the upper block sits to hold it tight. Create a head loop with 1/8-inch iron wire, attach it to the ring, and stuff it with excelsior, paper, or hay. Attach wooden arms to the rod with wire or hemp, securing them close to the head. Add a wire triangle and cross arm at the top of the rod to prevent slipping. Sew a false face on the head and dress the dummy in an old coat and trousers.

In factories and houses, windows often have weights to keep them in place. However, a simple wooden stick can be very useful if not all windows have this feature. The stick is made of pine wood, long enough to support the lower window sash at the same level as the upper sash, and about 1-1/2 or 2 inches wide. Notches are cut into the stick to securely hold the sash at different heights. This stick allows the window to be held at three different heights on one side and another height on the other side. It is a handy tool contributed by Katharine D. Morse from Syracuse, N. Y. Additionally, detailed drawings of a canoe and molds are provided. The boat is built on a temporary base, and molds are made from 1-inch material to shape the boat. The process involves bending wood with wire and soaking it in boiling water if needed.|['1.

In boat building, the gunwales, which are the long pieces at the top of the canoe, are crucial. They are made of strips of ash, 15 feet long, 1 inch wide, and 1 inch thick. These are temporarily fastened to the molds, ensuring they snugly fit the notches. The ends of the gunwales are cut to form a sharp point and are permanently fastened to the stem and stern pieces. Light strips C and D are placed between the gunwales and the bottom board to shape the ribs. The ribs, spaced 1 inch apart, are nailed inside the gunwales after being curved. Once all ribs are set, the temporary strips are removed. A strip is then added to replace the base, fastened with screws and lap-jointed to the stem and stern pieces. Seats are attached, and small end pieces are fitted to complete the canoe.|['1. What are the gunwales made of in boat building?\nA) Oak\nB) Ash\nC) Pine\nD) Cedar\nE) Maple', '2.

To prepare the pen for writing, stand it upright and dip a small camel's-hair brush into the ink bottle. Remove excess ink by scraping it off on the inner edge of the quill. Seal the ink bottle tightly when done. Store the pen at an angle with the tip facing upwards when not in use. Metal objects change size with temperature variations, but the extent of this change differs among materials. When two metal strips with different expansion rates are joined and heated or cooled, the combined piece will deform. This can be used to create a simple thermometer or thermostat by attaching electrical contacts that respond to temperature changes. A practical thermostat can be made by soldering together steel and brass strips of specific dimensions and adjusting the position of electrical contacts to control temperature-sensitive circuit connections.|"[""1.

To assemble the thermostat, first, place the steel shaft in its bearings to ensure it turns freely. Then, insert the steel pin on the end of the couple into slot C and secure the other end of the couple to its support using two machine screws. Test the thermostat by adjusting the temperature and observing the needle's movement. You can adjust the needle's movement by changing the position of the steel pin in slot C relative to the shaft supporting the needle. Attach a piece of white cardboard under the needle to create a scale for temperature readings. Mount contacts on each side of the needle for additional functionality. Construct a wooden case with drilled holes for air circulation. Finally, connect the thermostat to bells for temperature alerts.
