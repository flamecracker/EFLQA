"Dear Sir,

Enclosed is a bill for groceries and goods provided to you over the past six months, totaling $67.34. It should have been settled earlier. As a minister, it is puzzling how you justify using goods without payment, contrary to the Bible's teaching of 'Owe no man anything.' Your prompt payment is expected.

Grant contemplated on the financial strain his family faced due to his father's modest income. His mother, with her practical wisdom, had stretched their budget admirably. Grant pondered seeking help from Uncle Godfrey to clear their debts and give his father a fresh start.

The looming debt to Mr. Tudor risked losing their only local grocery credit. Deacon Gridley, the parish treasurer, had amassed wealth but withheld timely payments to Mr. Thornton, showing little concern for the minister's financial struggles.

The deacon mentioned that he would lend money to a neighbor at one percent interest, but he was willing to offer the same rate to Grant's father. Grant's uncle, Godfrey Thornton, who was a lawyer with savings, planned to send Grant to college. Despite his uncle's generous intentions, Grant realized the financial strain on his family and proposed that his uncle provide the money for his education directly to his parents. Grant felt becoming a businessman would allow him to support his family sooner. Despite his mother's worries, Grant was optimistic about convincing his uncle to help. He embarked on a journey to Somerset to discuss his plans with Uncle Godfrey, hopeful for a positive outcome.|"[""1.

Grant, a strong and determined boy, walked five miles to reach his uncle's office in a village to find work and support his family. His uncle, although disappointed that Grant might give up college, acknowledged the financial strain it would relieve. On his way back, Grant witnessed a girl being chased by a drunken man. Despite the danger, Grant intervened using a stick to trip the man and save the girl. The girl, named Carrie, shared her gratitude with Grant and introduced him to her mother, Mrs. Clifton, who was grateful for Grant's heroic act.

Mrs. Clifton expressed her deep gratitude towards Grant for helping her daughter, acknowledging his bravery. Grant was invited to spend time with the Cliftons, which he gladly accepted to get to know the young lady from New York better. Despite not achieving his initial goal, Grant was content with his trip. The Cliftons attended church the following Sunday, where Grant greeted them. He was invited to supper at their home the next day. While at the depot, Grant encountered Tom Calder, known for being reckless and dishonest, adding an unexpected twist to his day. Grant's mother had to make a decision regarding some items that could help with their financial situation, showing her thoughtful consideration for her husband's well-being.|"['1.

Tom Calder, a questionable companion, accompanied Grant unwillingly. Tom's dubious background and reputation made Grant uneasy. Tom had a history of suspicion for theft, even from his employer. Tom tried to explain stock trading to Grant, using bucket shops as an example. Grant, however, was relieved when Tom left. Grant was in a predicament, needing to sell his pearls. He decided to visit a jewelry store, but a lady accused him of stealing her pearls. The store employees were unsure and called their boss and the police. Grant was nervous until he recognized the store owner, feeling relieved.|"['1.

Grant returned home with a joyful expression, indicating good news. He excitedly told his mother that he sold the pearls for four hundred dollars. He visited Mr. Clifton on Saturday to collect the remaining money. With a list of debts and money in hand, he paid off everyone, including Mr. Tudor. Grant decided to be content with this outcome. He abandoned his college plans due to financial constraints. Despite having enough money to cover a year's expenses, the thought of college and future expenses troubled him. Grant knew his father's salary wouldn't increase, so he had to give up on college. He mentioned a Wall Street broker who offered him employment assistance. Later, he was summoned to New York for a trial and planned to visit Mr. Reynolds' office. Mr. Reynolds was polite and offered Grant a job as his old employee was going abroad. Grant was invited to stay at Mr. Reynolds' house for a week before starting work on Tuesday.|"['1.

Grant was thankful for his uncle's offer of a college education but decided to decline it due to his family's financial struggles. Instead, he accepted a job at a stockbroker's office to support his family. His uncle, disappointed, criticized Grant for his choice. Grant, feeling unjustly judged, held firm to his decision out of a sense of duty. Upon arriving at the city, he headed straight to Mr. Reynolds' office with his modest belongings. Mr. Reynolds was leaving for the Stock Exchange as Grant arrived, eager to begin his new job.|"[""1.

Two boys strolled down Nassau Street, where the New York post-office stood. Harry unlocked their firm's mailbox, retrieving a handful of letters. They soon entered the bustling broker's Exchange room. Grant gawked at the chaos, men shouting and gesturing wildly. The floor littered with paper, officers on a dais calling stock names to bids. Different broker groups focused on securities, while spectators observed from galleries. Amidst the commotion, a tall man's hat was playfully knocked off, leading to a scuffle. Grant, amazed, noted the brokers' behavior akin to schoolboys at recess. After the exchange, they headed back, with Harry kindly answering Grant's queries. On their return, Grant encountered Tom Calder, whose appearance left a dubious impression.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did Harry retrieve from their firm's mailbox on Nassau Street?\nA) Newspapers\nB) A handful of letters\nC) Stock certificates\nD) Brochures\nE) Magazines"", ""Question 2:\nWhere did the two boys go after retrieving the letters?\nA) Library\nB) Bank\nC) Post office\nD) Broker's Exchange room\nE) Restaurant"", 'Question 3:\nWhat did Grant observe inside the Exchange room?\nA) People sleeping\nB) Men shouting and gesturing wildly\nC) People reading quietly\nD) Animals running around\nE) Children playing', ""Question 4:\nWhat did Grant compare the brokers' behavior to?\nA) Teachers in a classroom\nB) Soldiers in battle\nC) Schoolboys at recess\nD) Doctors in a hospital\nE) Pilots in an airplane"", ""Question 5:\nWhat happened amidst the commotion in the Exchange room?\nA) A fire broke out\nB) A tall man's hat was playfully knocked off\nC) A musical performance started\nD) A dance competition began\nE) A food fight erupted"", 'Question 6:\nWho did Grant encounter on their way back?\nA) Harry\nB) Tom Calder\nC) A police officer\nD) A street performer\nE) A lost child']"|"['B) A handful of letters', ""D) Broker's Exchange room"", 'B) Men shouting and gesturing wildly', 'C) Schoolboys at recess', ""B) A tall man's hat was playfully knocked off"", 'B) Tom Calder']"
No, I do not base my judgment on personal memories and observations. My wife has passed away, and I am a very busy person, unable to give my son the attention he deserves. My son's health is my top priority as he is my only child. The boy was playing in the street when his father arrived home. He appeared mature for his age, with a small frame but a large head. Despite his plain appearance, his face lit up with a pair of big, dark eyes. Grant, accustomed to simpler homes, was awed by the luxury of the stockbroker's house. The room he was given was beautifully furnished, making him feel a bit out of place initially. But soon, he felt at ease and at home. Grant showed the boy his collection of books, and they bonded over playing ball. Grant's positive influence on the boy pleased Mr. Reynolds, who welcomed Grant into their family. Mrs. Estabrook, a relative of the boy's late mother, was not pleased with Grant's presence due to her own motives and jealousy.|"[""1.

When Harry Decker left the office after two weeks, Grant was now fully prepared to take over his responsibilities. With Harry's help, he had mastered the daily tasks of a broker's office and learned about key figures in the industry. Mr. Reynolds was supportive, but Willis Ford, for unknown reasons, was often critical. Grant later discovered Ford's connection to Mrs. Estabrook, who also treated him coolly. One evening, Grant encountered Ford with two others, indicating a surprising closeness. It turned out that Ford owed a significant sum to one of them, Morrison, due to a gambling incident. To settle the debt, Ford resorted to taking government bonds belonging to Mrs. Estabrook. This action led to a series of events that would challenge Ford's integrity and test his relationships.|"[""1.

Willis Ford was eager to leave the house, worried that Mrs. Estabrook might find out about the missing items before he escaped. Once on the street, he felt relieved. He had enough money to pay his debt and have an extra four hundred dollars. Despite his stepmother's kindness, he only cared about not getting caught. He slyly thought of blaming the new boy, Grant Thornton, for the theft. Willis decided to visit Mrs. Estabrook again to divert suspicion towards Grant. The next morning, Willis met with Jim Morrison and Tom Calder to discuss bonds worth more than his debt. However, when the housekeeper accused Grant of being a thief, Willis realized his plan might backfire, leaving his debt unpaid and Morrison angry.|"['1.

"""There seems to be a mystery here,"" the broker remarked. ""Morrison gave Grant two bonds to sell, which were identified as belonging to my housekeeper. How did he come to possess them? That is the question.""

""Please refrain from jumping to conclusions, Mrs. Estabrook,"" Mr. Reynolds advised. ""The culprit who took the bonds will likely be revealed. Meanwhile, your losses will be partly compensated as Grant has the money from selling most of them.""

Grant felt overwhelmed when he found a key in his pocket that fit the housekeeper's drawer. He realized the damning evidence against him, yet he knew he was innocent. The thought of Mr. Reynolds believing him guilty was distressing.

""I believe the evidence is compelling,"" Ford interjected. ""Grant had the bonds, sold some, holds the money, and possesses a key that opens the drawer where the bonds were stored.""

Mr. Reynolds assured Mrs. Estabrook that he would cover her losses due to the missing bonds. He promised to investigate the matter, shrouded in mystery, to put her mind at ease.

Willis Ford, feeling uneasy, left the house worried about Jim Morrison's potential anger when he discovered the missing money. If Ford revealed that he had given the bonds to Grant, Grant would be cleared, but Ford would be accused of theft. Meanwhile, Johnny, who received a message from Mr. Reynolds, encountered Grant, who had previously helped him financially. Johnny was grateful for the money, but he almost forgot his original errand. Mr. Reynolds warned Grant about a possible conspiracy against him, suspecting Willis Ford or someone else. Ford, troubled by his actions, planned to meet Morrison at a billiard room to address the missing money. Morrison accused Ford of trying to blame him for the theft, but Ford intended to clear his name by revealing the truth about the bonds.|"[""1.

Grant Thornton was falsely accused of stealing bonds by Willis Ford. However, Mr. Reynolds, the broker, saw through the deceit and commended Grant for his innocence. Ford, on the other hand, was dismissed from his job for his dishonesty. Grant's salary was increased as a result. Grant decided not to inform his mother about the salary increase until he had saved a substantial amount to surprise her. He projected that in six months, he would have over a hundred dollars, a significant sum for a country minister's son. Grant envisioned a bright future where he could amass a thousand dollars by the time he turned twenty-one, an amount that exceeded his father's total assets.|"[""1.

Willis Ford left his office feeling miserable, realizing his own unwise actions led to his downfall. He harbored deep hatred towards Grant Thornton and Mr. Reynolds, who had fired him. Despite his anger, he concocted a false story to deceive Mrs. Estabrook, hoping to manipulate her into aiding him. However, she saw through his deceit and only agreed to give him a partial loan. Meanwhile, Grant found solace in his increased responsibilities at work, away from negative influences like Jim Morrison and Tom Calder. His relationship with Mr. Reynolds and his son Herbert flourished, while Mrs. Estabrook's indifference was a relief to him. Grant was content as long as she didn't try to harm him.|"['1.

After six months, Grant wanted to visit home for a few days to celebrate his mother's birthday with a special gift he got for her. His parents were delighted by how well he was valued at work and believed his decision to work there was wise. During his visit, Grant discovered details about Herbert's disappearance. Herbert went out to play and found new friends while waiting for Grant. When Herbert didn't return, his father grew anxious. The housekeeper, however, seemed indifferent. Mr. Reynolds, worried, sought help from the police to find Herbert. Meanwhile, the housekeeper revealed a hidden grudge against Mr. Reynolds. Abner and his family lived in a simple cabin due to his lazy and intemperate father, Joel Barton. Abner, like his father, avoided hard work and was content with their modest lifestyle.|"[""1.

About a mile from the village of Scipio, there stood a cabin where a young man and a boy arrived by train from Chicago. The boy, delicate and dressed plainly, seemed anxious and held a look of fear towards his companion. The young man, Willis Ford, had a hidden agenda against the boy's father and Grant Thornton. The station master fetched them in a worn-out wagon to a modest home where a family struggled to make ends meet. The boy, Herbert, felt uneasy about their visit, sensing trouble ahead. Ford planned to leave Herbert there, causing tension. The family's financial struggles and the father's irresponsible behavior worried Ford. He requested a private conversation with the family to discuss a business matter, hinting at a difficult decision ahead.|"['1.

Ford hesitated. He did not want to spend more than necessary but needed a temporary place for the boy he was tired of caring for. He thought five dollars would suffice for the family's needs. He warned Mrs. Barton not to believe the boy's stories as he was under his care. Herbert begged to go with Ford, fearing homesickness if left behind. Ford, however, left him with Mrs. Barton. Abner's questions sparked Herbert's interest in leaving the place he disliked. When Mr. Barton, a shabbily dressed man, approached, Herbert felt a glimmer of hope. Despite Barton's attempts to get money, Mrs. Barton stood firm. After dinner, Barton fell asleep, unsuccessful in his efforts. Mrs. Barton remained resolute against his demands.|"[""1.

The boys decided to head to the village. A letter was written and sent, easing the boy's worries. He believed his father would come for him soon, making his current situation bearable. Unfortunately, the letter never reached his father. The family was not idle during this time. The father was deeply troubled by his son's disappearance and took immediate action to solve the mystery. The police were informed, a detective was hired, and the news spread through the papers. Meanwhile, Grant, who had grown fond of the missing boy, sympathized with the father's anguish. The broker's focus shifted from work to finding his son, strengthening his bond with Grant. Mrs. Estabrook, lacking attachment to the boy, showed little interest. One day, she found a letter that could potentially reveal the whereabouts of the missing boy. Her curiosity led her to open and read the letter, disregarding the consequences it might bring.|"['1.

"Dear Father,

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to write to you sooner, but I had no opportunity until now. A man named Willis Ford convinced me to go with him, claiming you had sent for me. He took me on a ship where he made me fall asleep with a handkerchief. When I woke up, we were at sea. I do not know where we went, but eventually, we arrived in a small town in Illinois with the Bartons. Mr. Barton is often drunk, and Mrs. Barton works hard. Their son Abner is kind to me and wants to go to New York. He suggested running away if we had money for train tickets. I long to return home, and if you could send money for our fares, Abner and I would leave immediately. Please help us.

Day after day, Herbert and Abner visited the post office, hoping for letters that never arrived. Herbert felt desolate, wondering if his father had forgotten him. Additionally, the lack of payment for Herbert's board at the Bartons' home added to his discontent. The boys, Herbert and Abner, sneaked out to check for mail. Abner, showing kindness, shared his bread with Herbert. As they journeyed, a kind man in a wagon offered them a ride. After a long walk, they rested and enjoyed a hearty breakfast. Despite the challenges, Herbert found himself surprisingly hungry after their walk. They continued their journey, covering twenty miles and spending the night in a farmer's barn.

Once more, the lady went up the stairs and burst into the boy's room. She lifted the covers and checked under the bed, but the boys were not there. Searching the room, she found a note on the mantelpiece, seemingly placed to catch attention. The next day passed, but the boys were still missing. A week went by, and they had not returned. Mrs. Barton, not a loving mother, felt the absence of Abner. However, she didn't mind Herbert's absence. Abner, noticing Herbert's weakness, showed kindness. When a carriage approached, a middle-aged lady noticed Herbert's condition. She took them to a comfortable home, where Herbert could rest. Herbert shared his story with Miss Stone, who decided to help him contact his friend Grant Thornton.

"Dear Grant,

I am writing to you through Miss Stone's help as I did not hear back from Papa after writing to him from Scipio, Illinois. Mr. Ford took me out West and left me with a poor family. Abner, Mr. Barton's son, was kind and planned to run away with me to New York. We waited for Papa's help but decided to escape on our own. Dr. Stone and his sister are caring for me now. Please show Papa this letter and ask him to bring me home. I fear Mr. Ford will find me. In the meantime, Grant secured money for his journey and left for Chicago. Meanwhile, Mr. Ford traced the boys to Claremont, where he learned they were with Dr. Stone. Ford confronted Abner's uncle, Dr. Stone, who defended the boys. Before Miss Stone could intervene, Ford rushed to Herbert's room.

Willis Ford was startled to see Grant there. He felt defeated and hesitant to admit it. Grant warned him to leave town or face arrest. Dr. Stone overheard their exchange and promptly threw Ford downstairs. Humiliated, Ford didn't dare return. Grant later telegraphed Mr. Reynolds about finding Herbert and heading back to New York. Mr. Reynolds, tired from a failed trip, was overjoyed. On their way home, Grant disclosed the housekeeper's betrayal in suppressing Herbert's letter. Mr. Reynolds, convinced of her treachery, asked her to leave. Mrs. Estabrook was shocked and blamed Grant. Grant then surprised his parents with a European trip using his savings.
