Tom acted promptly, and Mr. Dunlop introduced his three companions: Dave Hill, his nephew; George Parkinson, his secretary; and John Ransome, an investor in Mr. Dunlop's mining project. Joe Timmins, armed and in charge, stayed behind as a guide and driver, while his son accompanied one of the cars. Mr. Dunlop pointed out the valuable mining claim on the slope, explaining the need for an engineer to decide between tunneling and shaft sinking. The group planned to gather ore, head to Dugout, then Carson City to find experts. Tom expressed interest in mining and hoped to negotiate terms with Mr. Dunlop. They agreed to revisit the discussion in a few days. As they climbed back to camp, they found it mysteriously vanished, leaving only a quarter of the supplies behind.|"['1.

Dolph Gage's team, I'll bet, sir. They don't want you two here, and they want me even less. But maybe we'll surprise them! The trail can't be too hard to find. We need to start right away. It's a law of nature that whatever goes up must come down. Debris and rocks rained down after the explosion, but luckily, most of it missed Dolph Gage and his group as they ran. Tom intervened, urging Jim not to shoot at the fleeing enemies. Instead, he encouraged a fair fight. Harry discussed mining challenges, noting the tough rock in the area.

Harry realized he should have been more cautious as he struggled against the men. He almost escaped from two of them but was overpowered when a third man joined in the scuffle. They tied Harry up, and Gage, one of the men, emphasized their control over the area in Nevada. Harry sarcastically admitted that his friend Tom needed more experience in Nevada compared to Colorado and Arizona. Gage grumbled about Tom's attitude, thinking he could claim gold without understanding the rules of the land. They planned to take Harry's equipment to their camp and mentioned needing more help.

Tom explained that Jim Ferrers would return around the same time. He mentioned that rifles would be present until the camp resembled an outdoor arsenal, which they didn't want. Tom felt it was best not to keep the rifles as they didn't want to feel like thieves with someone else's property. Later, Alf Drew, feeling hungry, approached the camp cautiously. Tom and Harry had already prepared the meal. Despite Drew being a supposed helper, Tom allowed him to help himself to food and coffee without any rebuke. At ten o'clock, Tom, Harry, and Alf built a large fire away from the camp using oil-soaked wood, a powder flash, and a fuse-train before quickly leaving.

Tom and Harry observed the camp with binoculars, noticing the excitement among Gage, Eb, and Josh. Gage appeared wild, while Eb was stomping on his hat.

""We are going over there,"" Tom stated firmly, ""to claim what is rightfully ours. But let's aim to avoid violence. Killing should be reserved for war.""

For a moment, it was uncertain who would fire first. Gage was furious and willing to take risks. If he had shot at that moment, he would have likely faced retaliation.

""You are aware, Gage, that we have equal rights here,"" Tom calmly replied. ""Your claim is invalid due to exhausting mineral rights. We have evidence to support our ownership.""

Jim Ferrers returned to camp, fuming, after taking care of the firm's matters. He secured the claim, though it belonged to the firm. Now, he was off to settle his own affairs.

Hour after hour, the men toiled in the mine, sending up loads of rock. Jim split his time above and below ground. Jennison quietly brought the best samples to Reade, ensuring Harry slept undisturbed. The yellow rock kept coming up, not the richest ore but still gold-bearing. Tom tested it repeatedly. Finally, at seven in the evening, the miners agreed to stop for the day. Tim Walsh joked about their changing luck and the hope for a grand Christmas dinner. As a feverish week passed, a heavy snowfall isolated the ridge. Dynamite was running low, and the partners were out of money. Seeking credit in Dugout seemed risky, as creditors might take over the mine. Despite the challenges, Reade was determined to ensure his men were paid, even if it meant working elsewhere to settle their debts. Jim vowed to stop Reade from venturing out in the dangerous blizzard.|['1.

Despite his anxiety, Reade couldn't hide the smile Jim's advice brought out. Ferrers, a good fellow, wouldn't be helpful medically. Some men were clearing a path to the mine-shaft, though it was futile to work underground due to the stubborn rock. Jim suggested making skis, but the weather needed to freeze for 24 hours. On the fifth day, Harry showed signs of improvement. Reade ordered him to rest and eat. The weather turned intensely cold, and Jim started making skis. Tom explained treating Hazelton, hoping he did it right. Tim assured Tom that Hazelton improved under his care.|"['1.

Walsh warned Tom not to interfere with Mr. Reade, the patient, as he was in charge. Tom left and realized the fresh air rejuvenated him. He headed to the cook shack, where Reade explained that Tom's nerves were rattled from smoking. Meanwhile, Dolph Gage and his two companions plotted to sabotage the mine. They planned to use dynamite to drive Reade and Hazelton away. Gage directed his accomplices to place dynamite both in the tunnel and at the bottom of the shaft. They diligently worked for nearly four hours without alerting the sleeping miners in the shacks.|"['1.

By using the light from the lantern, Dolph carefully connected the wires to each stick of dynamite in the underground mine. He warned his companions to be cautious and not shoot at shadows, as a premature explosion could ruin their plans. Dolph eagerly anticipated the destruction that would cost thousands of dollars to repair, allowing them to take over the mine. Gage, filled with excitement, urged the magneto to drive out the engineers and reclaim the gold that belonged to him. Tom, trying to keep the situation under control, instructed the men to remain quiet to avoid alerting Hazelton. Tom decided against tracking the culprits on the frozen ground, fearing it would expose their location and make them vulnerable to attack. Instead, he focused on assessing the aftermath of the blast.|"[""1.

"""The explosions were caused by the magneto,"" he described. ""Unless an enemy returns to tamper with it, there shouldn't be any more blasts. Don't risk anyone going down the shaft for that. Instead, send down a few experienced men to handle it safely. Warn against reckless actions, as it's easy to get hurt. I'm concerned about the tunnel's entrance being blocked. Send tools down in the tub, but don't allow men to descend that way. It's too risky. Keep digging downwards and eastwards,"" instructed Tom. As he ascended the rope swiftly, Tom left to bring more workers for temporary support. The miners continued digging until they reached the tunnel, revealing the aftermath of the blast. Despite the chaos, they discovered a valuable vein, thanks to their adversaries.

Tom observed as the doctor checked Harry's temperature, pulse, and breathing. Dr. Scott then used a stethoscope to listen to Harry's heart and lungs, finishing the examination. Dr. Scott informed them that Harry was on the road to recovery and would soon be eating heartily. Tom expressed his eagerness to keep working, emphasizing the importance of staying active. Dr. Scott advised Harry to rest while receiving care. He also mentioned the promising future of the mine they owned. The officers returned with the body of Dolph Gage, who had been killed while resisting arrest. Jim Ferrers, who had personal reasons to dislike Gage, showed respect for the deceased.

On that very day, after the officers had left with their men, Jim Ferrers saw that the crust was holding up well, so he quickly drove fresh horses to the doctor's cutter. The doctor stayed to care for Harry Hazelton, while Jim hurried off to Dugout City armed with letters from Dr. Scott. These letters informed certain dealers in Dugout about the unlimited credit the partners deserved due to their mine. Before Harry had even sat up, vehicles were already on their way to the Ambition Mine laden with supplies like dynamite, food, and even some new books for Harry's entertainment. The operation at the mine was now in full swing, with more miners and carpenters arriving daily. The mine was turning a profit, allowing Tom and Harry to upgrade their engineer offices and send money back to their families in Gridley. Alf Drew, who had not contributed much, turned over a new leaf, kicked his smoking habit, and found a job at the mine. Jim assured Alf that he would handle his earnings and keep him updated while he explored new opportunities.|"[""1.
