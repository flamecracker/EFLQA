The repaired Queen Mary was now sailing to the North Sea for patrol duty with the British North Sea fleet under Vice-Admiral Beatty. The crew, eager to return to active service, happily left the shores of England. Onboard, they sang and laughed, looking forward to shedding their cautious past. Two officers discussed missing their former commander, Lord Hastings, but understood the necessity of their new assignment. The young American, Frank, and his English companion, Jack, had been through many adventures together, facing danger with bravery. Despite their differing sizes and temperaments, they had proven to be a formidable team in various battles and missions across the seas.|"['1.

Jack and Frank were close friends, but they had different temperaments. Frank was quick to anger and sometimes acted impulsively, but Jack was always there to calm him down. While Jack was physically stronger and better in hand-to-hand combat, Frank excelled in using weapons like revolvers, rifles, and swords. Both boys were skilled linguists, speaking French, German, and English. They had even helped the Czar of Russia on a mission led by Lord Hastings. Despite the challenges they faced, including passing through the Kiel canal under threat from German warships, they always managed to come out on top. The British fleet's ability to contain the powerful German navy at Heligoland was a strategic victory, cutting off Germany's vital supplies and weakening its position in the war.|"[""1.

Over a year had passed since the last German commerce raider met its end. The German commercial flag vanished from the world's seas. Germany seemed to be reaching a breaking point. Despite being confined in Heligoland, the formidable German high sea fleet remained intact. It was believed that the fleet would eventually confront the British. While the outcome was predicted to favor the Allies, the German fleet was expected to put up a fight. The British contained the fleet to prevent it from engaging in commerce warfare. As the _Queen Mary_ patrolled the North Sea, unaware of the impending battle, the crew anticipated a monotonous mission due to the fleet's reluctance to engage. The British maintained a vigilant blockade to prevent German vessels from causing further harm. The threat of German Zeppelins attacking from the air added to the tension, requiring constant readiness from the British warships.|['1.

In the dry dock, the _Queen Mary_ was equipped with a gun and a team of four men to operate it. One man kept watch at night, another during the day, while the other two were on standby. The night watchman scanned the skies with night glasses. Suddenly, he spotted a Zeppelin and raised the alarm. Captain Raleigh, fearing an attack, ordered immediate action. Frank and Jack, awakened by the commotion, rushed on deck. The _Queen Mary_ swiftly maneuvered to evade the Zeppelin's bombs. A bomb hit the water nearby, and Jack led the rescue efforts, saving fifteen German airmen. Despite the danger, Jack continued his search for a missing crew member with Frank by his side.|"[""1.

Frank swam deep and grabbed the German man's collar underwater. He then swam up and reached Jack at the balloon. The two ships, _Queen Mary_ and _Indefatigable_, had a rivalry. Last year, _Indefatigable_ won in an athletic contest, except in the standing broad jump. This year, _Queen Mary_ aimed to win. They planned a boxing match, but their boxer was sick. Frank was chosen as a replacement due to his skills. The next day, both ships prepared for the sports event. _Indefatigable_ won several matches, leading 9-2. _Queen Mary_ hoped to win the revolver contest and had a surprise for the boxing match.

In the duel between the crews of the ships, a member of the _Queen Mary_ was eliminated by a precise shot. As the competition continued, only Frank from the _Queen Mary_ and Simpson from the _Indefatigable_ remained. Simpson, an experienced man, acknowledged Frank's skills and warned him about Harris, a formidable opponent known for his powerful right-hand punch. Despite Harris's imposing stature and experience, Jack, a younger and agile fighter, managed to evade Harris's initial attacks and deliver a series of successful counterattacks, leaving Harris surprised and with a bleeding nose.

Frank and Jack spent the afternoon observing the skies for signs of the German fleet. As darkness fell, they heard the distant whirring of an approaching airship. Jack, using his night glass, spotted a single aeroplane flying westward, too high to determine its nationality. Frank and Jack decided to blend in with the German fleet by adjusting their hydroplane's speed and direction. A dozen German planes, mostly small with a few carrying up to four men, flew past them. Jack believed they could join the German planes unnoticed and follow them to their destination. As the German planes closed in, the first one passed by without suspicion, allowing Frank and Jack to continue their risky mission undetected.|['1.

Jack observed the distant dark blur that was the French port of Calais, still under French control despite German attempts to capture it. As they approached, German aircraft began a sudden bombardment. Mistaking the sound for revolver fire, Jack and Frank believed the Germans had encountered French airships. The German planes descended into an Allied camp, prompting the lads to devise a plan to follow the Germans back to their lines. At midnight, they returned to the parked airplanes, witnessing a man fall to his death from one of the machines. Amidst rifle shots from the French camp, the Germans took flight, with a dramatic turn of events unfolding in the dark night sky.|"['1.

There was a cry of anger from aboard some of the other German craft, but no man raised a hand to stay the flight of his car. It would have been suicide and the Germans realized it. They sped away into the darkness whence they had come. Frank and Jack, in their British hydroplane, went with them. The two lads glanced around. It was very dark. A short distance to the north they could see the broad expanse of the North Sea, stretching away in the night. The dark waves lapped the shore gently with a faint thrashing sound. The water was very calm. Except for the figures that had alighted upon the shore in the darkness, there was not a human being in sight. To the south, to the east and west stretched miles and miles of sand dunes. Just these sand dunes and the waters of the North Sea--there was nothing else in sight. At a signal, the men gathered around the man who appeared to be the leader. Frank and Jack thanked their lucky stars that the night was very dark, for otherwise they would have been in imminent danger of being discovered; and each lad realized that it would go hard with them should their true identities be penetrated. The darkness served them like a shield. Nevertheless, both lads kept their hands on their revolvers. Each had determined that if discovered, he would make an effort to escape in the nearest of the aircraft. Each knew that there was little hope of such an escape,|"[""1.

It was Frank who spoke. All was quiet among the sand dunes. The commander of the Germans had laid down upon the ground, some distance from the others, half an hour before. Snores from various points announced that most of the men were sleeping soundly. Frank approached the other German, engaging him in conversation before swiftly striking him over the head with his revolver butt. The German fell to the ground. Jack then found a paper in the German's pocket, quickly examining it by the light of a match. Satisfied with its contents, Jack noticed the German leader regaining consciousness and trying to sabotage their hydroplane. Frank swiftly fired his revolver at the German, while Jack took a shot at the pilot of the German craft as it passed by. The fallen aeroplane floated on the sea's surface, its condition uncertain in the darkness.|"['1.

"Jack assigned Frank to a position, and the hydroplane slowly approached the enemy. Stopping within revolver range, a shot was fired across the water.

Suddenly, the boy grasped the situation. He swiftly pulled out his gun with his unharmed arm and leaped to the side of the aircraft. In an instant, a person caught his hand, preventing him from shooting. Simultaneously, another figure climbed onto the plane from the opposite side. Shouting out, the boy managed to break free from the person holding him, but was met by the second German. Despite his injured shoulder, he fought on. Kicking one of the Germans down, he tried to aim at the other, who was approaching. The two Germans attacked the boy together, pushing him back onto the plane. Just then, Jack, concerned for his friend's safety, boarded the plane and bravely confronted the enemies. With swift actions, Jack overpowered the Germans, saving his friend from harm.|['1.

The man hesitated to shoot again as Jack quickly disarmed him, making him fall into the sea with a splash. Meanwhile, a German warship approached, mistaking the boys for allies. Frank slowed down the hydroplane, causing it to wobble. Thinking they were landing on the battleship, Jack was thrown into the water when the plane capsized. Frank, trapped inside, calmly used a pocketknife to free himself. As he emerged, gasping for air, a rescue boat pulled him to safety.

Jack, upon emerging from below deck, immediately searched the sea's surface for any trace of his friend Frank or the wreckage. Not finding them, he realized what had occurred. With a deep breath, he plunged into the water. It took him a while to locate the sinking debris below, but there was no sign of Frank. Eventually, he resurfaced, where he was pulled into a boat by rough hands. Meanwhile, Captain Raleigh swiftly gave orders from the bridge. The _Queen Mary_ altered its course, and the wireless communication was coded to avoid interception by potential German vessels. Other British ships were alerted to head to the Skagerak area. Captain Raleigh instructed Frank and Jack to assist him closely during the upcoming battle, emphasizing the importance of relaying messages accurately.|"[""1.

Captain Raleigh gave instructions for one of the men to report to the wireless room to receive any incoming messages while the other remained. He assured them of the impending one-sided battle but expressed confidence in their bravery. The men were then given orders and had a hearty meal before resting or discussing the upcoming battle. The captain and his crew prepared for what was anticipated to be a historic naval battle, with the British fleet facing formidable German opponents. As the battleships _Indefatigable_ and _Queen Mary_ drew closer, plans were shared via wireless communication. Captain Reynolds of the _Indefatigable_ later joined Captain Raleigh on the _Queen Mary_ to discuss strategy based on information obtained from a captured German document. The orders were revised to engage the enemy at long range and draw them further into the North Sea to await reinforcements.|['1.

Captain Raleigh expressed his concern about the German fleet potentially spreading out across the sea if they managed to get past them. Skagerak, an arm of the North Sea, was where the greatest naval battle in history was set to take place, off Jutland and Horn Reef, near Denmark. The German fleet had made a bold move by venturing a hundred miles across the North Sea towards Jutland. The British, although scattered, were aware of the German fleet's approach, thanks to a forewarning from a British aviator. The British ships, including the _Glasgow_, _Queen Mary_, _Indefatigable_, _Albert_, and _Victoria_, prepared for battle as the Germans slowed down upon realizing they were discovered. The German fleet attempted a surprise attack but were met with resistance from the British. The British aviators engaged in a brief aerial skirmish with the Germans before the German fleet retreated to safety due to the presence of a superior British force.|"['1.

Ahead of the larger ships now were the fastest light cruisers, including the _Defense_, the _Black Prince_, and the _Warrior_. Following them were the destroyers _Tipperary, Turbulent, Nestore, Alcaster, Fortune, Sparrow Hawk, Ardent_, and the _Shark_. The _Albert_ and _Victoria_ had also joined, despite being damaged by German shells. The German fleet approached in a broad semi-circle with the flagship _Westphalen_ at the center. Surrounding the flagship were battleships like _Pommern_, _Freiderich_, _Wiesbaden_, and _Frauenlob_, along with cruisers and torpedo boats. The British ships, led by the _Queen Mary_, engaged in battle. The _Black Prince_ and the _Warrior_ bravely faced the German flagship. The British fleet fought valiantly, but the German Zeppelins posed a threat. Despite the intense battle, the British ships stood their ground until the sea engulfed them.|"['1.

In the intense naval battle, the German battleship _Pommern_ was the first to face the weight of enemy fire, quickly igniting and forcing its crew to abandon ship. As the British ships _Marlborough_, _Queen Mary_, _Indefatigable_, and _Invincible_ closed in on the German fleet, the _Queen Mary_ focused its guns on the _Westphalen_. Despite efforts by other German vessels to distract the _Queen Mary_, Captain Raleigh remained determined to sink the _Westphalen_. Amidst the chaos, a British gunner successfully targeted and destroyed a German submarine attempting to aid the _Westphalen_. The battle intensified as the British flagship _Lion_ joined the fray, leading to the sinking of the German battleship _Frauenlob_. Despite heavy losses on both sides, the German admiral pressed on, resulting in a fierce and devastating exchange of fire.|"['1.

In a fierce naval battle, the British fleet found themselves outnumbered and outgunned by the German ships. Despite fighting bravely, Vice-Admiral Beatty decided to retreat to avoid further losses. As the British ships withdrew, a German shell struck the _Invincible_, causing a devastating explosion that split the ship in half. The British sailors on the _Queen Mary_ worked tirelessly to tend to the wounded and fallen comrades. The German fleet, unexpectedly strong and resilient, continued to press the British ships, inflicting heavy casualties and sinking several vessels.

The German fleet suffered significant losses in the battle. Several German ships, including the _Westphalen_, _Pommern_, _Freiderich_, _Frauenlob_, and the flagship _Wiesbaden_, were either sunk or badly damaged. As the German torpedo boat sank, the German forces slowed down. However, the battle was far from over. The second German squadron was nearing the conflict, and the German admiral awaited their arrival before resuming the fight. Despite sighting the approaching British fleet, the Germans were unsure of its strength. The German admiral decided to continue the battle with hopes of success. The _Queen Mary_ and _Indefatigable_ faced a fierce attack but managed to hold their ground. The British ships retaliated, sinking the German battleship _Hindenburg_. The _Wiesbaden_, although damaged, continued to engage the British ships. The _Marlborough_ faced severe damage but continued to fire back.

"""You must choose a course and stick to it,"" the German advised. ""My men could cause trouble. Despite our current situation, I'll support you if needed."" Suddenly, all four Germans dropped their oars and stood up. Harris, lost in thought, snapped back to reality. Despite the boat's movement, he readied himself for defense, relying on his naval boxing skills. Harris, without calling for help, dodged a blow and countered, toppling one German overboard. Another lunged with a knife, but Jack intervened, disarming him. After a scuffle, both Germans met the same watery fate.

Frank was struggling against his opponent, who had the upper hand. The German had a tight grip around Frank's throat, making it hard for him to breathe. Just as Jack arrived, Frank raised his hands in surrender, and both disappeared underwater. Jack quickly grabbed the first person he could reach, which turned out to be Frank. With a firm hold on Frank, Jack resurfaced and saw the German officer helping them back onto the boat. Meanwhile, Harris was battling two enemies with knives. Seeing an opportunity, Jack joined the fight. Despite a surprise attack from one of the Germans, Jack managed to disarm him and eventually defeated both, securing the boat. However, another German sailor tried to take over the boat but was thwarted by the friends. Later, they were taken aboard the German warship and thanked by the commander for their bravery.|['1.

The group was taken by surprise as they found themselves on a pleasure yacht that had been converted into a war vessel.

"""You would be a better sailor if you followed orders without question,"" he said firmly. ""I'll tell you, as I see you don't fully trust me. My crew of five men will be joining us aboard soon."" 

Quickly, Frank helped Jack as needed. They returned to the cabin, stripped the prisoner, and dressed in German uniforms. Soon, a skiff arrived with five men who were welcomed by von Ludwig. 

He assigned tasks to each man, including Harris in the engine room. As the ship set sail, von Ludwig and Frank navigated according to the chart. The engines hummed, propelling the ship smoothly through the water.

A gun fired, sending a shell towards a German cruiser, but it missed. On the _Bismarck_, the men kept firing, but none hit the target. The German ship chased, while the _Bismarck_ sped ahead. Suddenly, trouble in the engine room caused chaos. A crew member fainted from exhaustion. Harris, the Englishman, was attacked, knocked unconscious, and disarmed. A plan was made to free imprisoned sailors. One man sneaked out, freed them, and took command. They aimed to capture the bridge and wheel. A scuffle ensued on deck, with von Ludwig firing his revolver. The odds shifted, but the fight continued.|['1.

Three men operated the gun, attempting to follow orders, but the gun malfunctioned, likely from the previous battle. The British crew tried other guns with no success. The gun crew, about to join forces with von Ludwig and Jack, realized the plan and took cover behind the guns. The lookout and other crew members engaged in a fierce battle. As the fight reached a standstill, the ship surged forward, causing chaos among the Germans. Meanwhile, in the engine room, Harris faced challenges alone.

Two British and four enemy soldiers had fallen. Despite this, six British and a lone German remained on deck, while seven Germans attempted to breach the engine room.

Von Ludwig quietly approved Harris's plan as the most promising for success. He emphasized the urgency of delivering important papers to the British admiralty without delay.
