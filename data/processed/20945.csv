"""I won't do it!"" Patty firmly replied. ""The idea of you ordering me around like that, Phil! I want to stay and I will. You can leave if you want; I'll go home with Roger and the girls.""""You act like you have authority over me that you don't! I won't be bossed around by you, Phil!

When Patty and her friend Blaney arrived at the Farrington house, Roger greeted them at the door. Despite his friendly tone, Patty was seething with anger. It was rare for Patty to get upset, but when she did, it was intense. She was mentally and physically exhausted, and she resented Philip's attempt to control her. Defiantly, she expressed that she didn't care about Roger's opinion and stormed off. Elise, now fully awake, bombarded Patty with questions about her evening, but Patty was on the verge of tears. Instead of collapsing in despair, Patty decided to change out of her fancy gown before letting her emotions out.

Patty was growing anxious as she waited for five more minutes, hoping to find Ray. However, when she tried to open the door, it wouldn't budge. Suddenly, she realized she was locked in! Ray had carried out her threat to get back at Patty. Though she found the situation silly, Patty knew she had to find a way out. She scanned the room for exits, but there was only one door leading to a dressing-room and a bathroom. With no balconies or accessible windows, Patty felt trapped. She searched for a telephone but found none. Patty knew Ray's parents were likely not home, and the staff was probably instructed not to let her out.

Patty lived in a house close to the street, just forty feet from the sidewalk. One day, she had a clever idea. She hurried to find paper and a pencil, as there was no desk in the room.

Patty gracefully stepped through the trees, a vision of spring itself. Clad in chiffon robes of dawn-rose hues, she danced elegantly, her movements embodying poetry. The audience, captivated, watched in silence as Patty's dance transitioned from spring to summer and then to autumn, each transformation accompanied by changing lights and music.
