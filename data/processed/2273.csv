Tom Swift was on a mission to attend a motor-boat auction. His father, Mr. Barton Swift, inquired about his plans as Tom prepared to head out on his motor-cycle. Tom explained that he was interested in a motor-boat that belonged to Mr. Bently Hastings, the same boat used by thieves who attempted to steal his father's turbine model invention. The boat was abandoned near the lake after the thieves fled the old mansion. Mr. Hastings, the rightful owner, was now selling it at auction due to some damage. Tom expressed his fascination with motor-boats and Lake Carlopa's ample space for speeding. Although he had no intentions of bidding, Tom admired the boat's potential and its original value of nine hundred dollars.|"[""1.

Tom hoped he wouldn't cross paths with Happy Harry or his group that day as he powered up his machine to climb a hill. He doubted they'd show up at the auction, deeming it too risky. Andy Foger, a wealthy troublemaker, crossed his mind. Tom recalled a past incident when Andy and his pals nearly knocked him off his bike. As Tom daydreamed about owning a boat for a Lake Carlopa trip with his dad and friend Ned, Andy's car approached. Tom anticipated a lively bidding but hoped it wouldn't exceed $200. Andy and his friend Sam rudely interrupted, prompting Tom to leave his motorcycle and join the auction crowd.

Today at the auction, Mr. Wood expressed his hope that Tom Swift, a lively young man, would bid on a boat. However, he also mentioned a wish for the men who stole the boat to be present to pay for the damage they caused. Despite some murmurs from the crowd, the auction continued. Tom noticed a suspicious man nearby but couldn't link him to the thieves. As the auction progressed, Mr. Wood described the boat's features, such as its double-cylinder motor and comfortable seating for twelve. The boat, named CARLOPA, was originally worth nine hundred dollars and was now up for bidding. The crowd was invited to inspect the boat, and Tom shared his expertise on the motor's repair needs. Although the man of suspicion didn't join the inspection, the auction proceeded with an opening bid of five hundred dollars.|"['1.

Tom felt his heart sink as the bidding reached two hundred dollars. Andy Foger, filled with rage, broke free from Sam's grip and pushed through the crowd to shout out his bid. Despite Mr. Wood's efforts to raise the price, no one dared to bid higher. Tom was torn, knowing he could only offer five dollars more. With a sudden decision, he bid two hundred dollars, fearing someone might outbid him. The auctioneer called for higher bids, but there was silence. Tom's heart raced as the auctioneer declared the boat sold to him. As he paid, Mr. Wood congratulated him. Tom ignored Andy's threat, focusing on his new boat, the ARROW, waiting at the dock.|"[""1.

Tom excitedly pointed to a man on his motor-boat on the lake. The man was fiddling with the gasoline tank compartment. Tom explained that the man had bid on the boat at an auction but didn't win. As Tom approached, the man ran off into the bushes. Tom checked the compartment but found nothing valuable. The former owner, Mr. Hastings, handed Tom the key, and they opened the compartment to find just the gas tank. Tom wondered why the man was interested in it. Later, Tom would uncover a mysterious connection to the compartment that would put him in danger. Mr. Hastings suggested the man might have been curious or meddling. Tom didn't recognize him from any local gangs and doubted he was a threat.|"['1.

Tom remained silent, suspecting that the man had a motive beyond mere curiosity in messing with the boat. Unable to find an immediate solution, he continued removing the letters. Determined to fix the motor, he planned to return that afternoon to bring the boat home, seeking permission to dock it there. Riding home, Tom pondered the stranger's actions but shifted his focus to the joy of having the motor-boat operational. Planning outings with his dad and friend, Ned, he anticipated a fun summer ahead. Along the way, Tom encountered Eradicate, who warned him of a hidden tree trunk on the road. Together, they discovered the log deliberately obstructing the path, likely placed to cause harm to passing vehicles. Tom suspected it might be the work of vandals or tramps with malicious intent.|"[""1.

Tom explained that the log had been placed at the foot of the hill by someone who then drove the car down the road. Tom, with his keen observation skills, easily traced the path of the vehicle. As he followed the telltale signs, he suddenly spotted something and rushed towards a cluster of bushes. Peering through the leaves, he called out but received no response. Tom carefully examined the broken branches and hidden car tracks in the bushes. He climbed into the car to investigate further when Andy Foger, his rival, confronted him. Tom calmly returned Andy's wrench that he had found near the log. Tom then revealed that he knew Andy's plan to sabotage him due to a previous bidding incident. Despite the dangerous trick, Tom decided not to involve the authorities and instead admonished Andy and his accomplice, Sam Snedecker.|"['1.

Tom confidently stated that he had everything he needed and assured the other person that he wouldn't involve the police. However, he demanded a task to be completed, warning of consequences if not done. Despite threats, Mr. Swift's son stood his ground, returning a tool and instructing them to clear a log from the road. Defiantly, Tom warned of potential consequences and confronted the bully, causing a brief scuffle. The bully quickly retreated, and Tom firmly warned against any further threats or actions. The bully tried to instigate retaliation but was thwarted as Tom stood his ground, ensuring the roadblock was removed before any further trouble ensued.|"['1.

Tom smiled at Sam and Andy after they successfully moved the log with the car's power. Eradicate, a man who specializes in cleaning, promised to help clean Mr. Swift's place. Tom then left Eradicate trying to wake his mule, Boomerang, and headed up the hill to his motor-cycle. He planned to repair his boat, the ARROW, to take it to Mr. Swift's place. Tom shared his plan with his dad, mentioning a new invention to improve aeroplanes' stability. Mr. Swift expressed interest but needed a break.

Tom was exhausted and in need of a break. He appreciated the offer of using a boat from his friend. However, Tom reminded him that if he wanted to return by night, he should set out soon. Tom mentioned that dinner was likely ready at Mrs. Baggert's place. Tom faced challenges fixing the motor on the ARROW boat. He had to replace the batteries, adjust the spark coil, and fix the magneto. With help from Mr. Hastings and new dry cells, Tom got the motor running smoothly. As he tested the motor along the lakeshore, he was flagged down by Mr. Damon, who was stranded with his car.

"""No, not exactly,"" the boy clarified how he acquired the boat. Once ashore, he secured the ARROW to a tree. Tom then fixed Mr. Damon's stalled car.

The **arrow** swiftly moved ahead of the **carlopa** as Mr. Hastings increased the speed. Initially neck and neck, the newer boat surged forward, leaving Tom a bit disappointed. However, his friend's promise of future rides lifted his spirits. As they turned back towards the dock, plans for a vacation tour were shared and met with enthusiasm. Later that night, Tom checked on his boat, the **arrow**, and found the gasoline compartment unlocked. Suspecting Andy Foger's involvement, Tom decided to gather evidence before confronting him. The next morning, everything seemed fine, and Tom debated whether to accuse Andy immediately or wait for the right moment.

Mr. Jackson and Mrs. Baggert were surprised to see the young inventor, Tom, return home so soon. Tom explained the mishap with the Red Streak, and together with the engineer, they repaired the damage on the Arrow. The repairs were completed quickly, and just before dinner, the boat was ready to continue its journey to Sandport. Tom decided to have dinner there but realized he had been away longer than expected. Despite a delicious meal, Tom hurried to resume his trip, equipped with a compass and a searchlight. However, upon reaching the dock, Tom was shocked to find the Arrow missing. Even with the engineer's help, they couldn't locate the boat.

Tom tried to reassure his father, who was visibly agitated. He suggested they might recover the stolen items and questioned how Garret knew about the thieves. Mr. Swift wanted Tom to call for a description of the stolen goods but realized he didn't know what was taken.

At midday, halfway between Sandport and Shopton, the travelers paused for lunch on their boat. Mr. Swift eagerly scanned the horizon for his dock, while Tom skillfully adjusted the machinery for maximum speed. Suddenly, they noticed a massive hot-air balloon above them, with a man hanging perilously from a trapeze. The balloon caught fire, and the man struggled to escape the flames.

The motor-boat drifted away from the balloonist in peril, but the young inventor swiftly maneuvered the boat back beneath the blazing balloon. The canvas was falling in fiery pieces, creating a dangerous shower around the man hanging from a trapeze. The crowd on the bank watched anxiously, realizing the man's desperate situation as the balloon rapidly descended. With little wind to help, the fiery canvas threatened to engulf him. Suddenly, a gust of wind caused the balloon to sway, accelerating its descent. In a bold move, the young inventor used a makeshift megaphone to communicate with the man. As the balloonist let go and plummeted towards the lake, the inventor prepared a plan to rescue him using a rope from the boat.|"['1.

The balloonist plummeted down, and the deflated bag descended rapidly, leaving no time to spare. In a matter of moments, the performer was engulfed in flames and smothered. Plunging into the water, the man vanished beneath the surface like a dropped stick. Ned steered the boat towards the man's anticipated resurfacing point, while the blazing balloon loomed overhead. Urged by onlookers' fearful cries, Tom and his companions knew the risks of their rescue mission. Spotting the man, they swiftly extended a rope for him to grasp. With a deft maneuver, the boat whisked the aeronaut to safety, just as the fiery balloon hissed its demise in the lake. Saved in the nick of time, the man expressed his aversion to hot-air balloons and his preference for aeroplanes or gas balloons in the future.|"['1.

The boys and Mr. Swift were intrigued by the balloonist's tales and asked numerous questions, which he humbly answered. As the day waned, they neared Shopton. Mr. Sharp, nonchalantly, discussed their next steps post-robbery. The police were informed about the theft, but Tom and his father doubted much help would come. Ned Newton left for home, and Mr. Sharp, after tending to his burns, stayed over as a guest. Days passed with no leads on the thieves. The group brainstormed about a unique airship idea. While cruising the lake, they spotted a boat with four men who noticed them. Tom recognized one of the men, prompting a surprised reaction.|"['1.

Tom left his friend to watch over the captured criminals while he rushed through the forest to the nearby village. There, he sought out an officer who promptly arrested the gang members. The stolen diamond was handed over to the authorities who promised to find its rightful owner. It didn't take long for them to trace the gem back to a large jewel heist in a distant city. The gang, known as the Happy Harry gang, was linked to the robbery. Tom later uncovered the gang's attempt to steal valuables from Mr. Swift's shops. Despite their efforts, Tom outsmarted them at every turn, even beating them in a boat race against Andy Foger.
