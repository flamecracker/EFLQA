Tom Swift had designed a powerful tank with broad steel belts similar to a locomotive's wheels. These belts provided a large surface area for traction, allowing the heavy tank to advance with great force, though sacrificing speed. His tank could move at nearly double the speed of British tanks at the time. The tank was equipped with strong motors and living quarters for the crew in case it got stuck in enemy territory. The main strength of the tank lay in its ability to crush obstacles like barbed wire, leading the infantry through enemy lines.

Ned quickly peeked through the nearby slot and saw the barn, but then noticed a man running away in terror. The tank crashed through the barn, destroying everything in its path. Ned, worried about trouble, warned Tom about the man he saw. Tom realized that if one person ran out, others might have too. They decided to investigate. As they approached the demolished barn, a group of men in a car, led by a stern farmer with a gun, appeared. The sudden turn of events left everyone speechless.

After a discussion with one of the men in the car, Tom and Ned became more convinced that the situation was a setup by Blakeson and his group. They suspected that the man who ran out of the barn was the same person from the factory. Ned whispered to Tom that the man might have alerted the farmer about their arrival, possibly because he knew about Tom's plan to ram the barn. To resolve the issue, Tom decided to use his Liberty Bonds as security for the damages caused. Despite some hesitation and discussions, Mr. Kanker eventually agreed to accept the bonds, clarifying that they were not a payment but a form of security until a fair settlement could be reached.

The search from the air began as Tom and Ned circled around, peering down eagerly for the hidden tank. Ned spotted something peculiar near a river against a hill - a camouflaged clump of bushes that seemed out of place. Tom, guiding their airship, agreed, noticing the tank cleverly disguised.
