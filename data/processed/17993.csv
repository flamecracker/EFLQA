Spain, despite its pride, faced poverty. Having spent vast sums trying to conquer the islanders, Spain had no money left to help the suffering people she displaced. Consequently, Spain sought aid from the United States to provide food and supplies. The Red Cross Society responded by sending tons of aid to the island, which was distributed by capable individuals. However, some Spaniards criticized the US intervention, leading to tensions. The situation escalated until the US threatened Spain to withdraw its soldiers from the island and allow self-governance. This ultimatum was seen as a declaration of war by Spain. The island in question is Cuba, part of the West Indies, a region with a tropical climate and rich in resources like fruits, minerals, and precious stones, but plagued by natural disasters.|"['1.

"Cuba, the largest of the West India Islands, was discovered by Columbus shortly after his first landing at San Salvador. Despite its Spanish name given by Columbus, the world now recognizes it as Cuba, its native Indian name. Positioned as the ""Key to the Gulf of Mexico,"" with Havana as its capital, Cuba appears small on maps but is nearly as large as Pennsylvania. Spain, a kingdom, saw King Alfonso XII. pass away in 1885, leaving Queen Christina as regent until her son reaches the age to be crowned. The conflict in Cuba led the United States to send the battleship Maine to Havana's harbor in response to concerns for American citizens there. The harbor, protected by fortresses like Morro Castle, captivated the crew as they anchored near other ships.

The fish market is a notable building in the city with a long marble table running its length, open to the harbor. Poultry and fruits arrive at houses in baskets carried by donkeys. Horses carry loads that may seem like grass bundles until a donkey's head peeks out. The milkman delivers milk directly from a cow at your door. Cooking mainly uses charcoal on ranges resembling benches. The battleship Maine, worth $5,000,000, had 26 officers and 328 crew members. On a dark night in 1898, an explosion sank the ship, causing chaos. Rescues were made by small boats, and the Spanish helped care for the injured. Divers recovered nineteen bodies, honored with a public funeral. The victims were later moved to Arlington Cemetery in 1899.|"['1.

After the tragic explosion of the Maine, some survivors like Lieutenant Commander Wainwright, Lieutenant F.C. Bowers, and Jeremiah Shea shared their harrowing experiences. Despite the loss of lives, efforts were made to salvage valuable items from the wreck, including a silver service and the captain's belongings. Divers also retrieved keys to the magazines and other important artifacts. The investigation into the explosion raised suspicions of sabotage, but conclusive proof was lacking. Tensions escalated between the United States and Spain, leading to a blockade of Cuban ports by American ships. This blockade aimed to cut off Spanish support to Cuba and force a resolution.

During the Spanish-American War, the United States Navy swiftly adapted passenger steamships for war service. These ships were crucial for enforcing blockades and carrying out reconnaissance missions. The gunboat Nashville, part of the squadron, intercepted a Spanish merchant vessel, Buena Ventura, marking the beginning of hostilities. The Navy seized numerous Spanish ships, selling most after condemnation by a prize court. The first military engagement occurred near Matanzas, Cuba, where American ships bombarded new Spanish forts. Despite the Spanish firing the first shot, American vessels quickly overpowered the defenses. The Puritan's precise shot, dismounting a Spanish gun, stood out during the skirmish. Tensions rose as news of a formidable Spanish fleet approaching heightened anxieties about potential attacks on American cities. Vigilance and strategic planning were essential as the US Navy monitored the Spanish fleet's movements.|"['1.

"The ""Cape Verde"" fleet, known as the Spanish ships, caused constant worry for the United States Navy. They set sail from the Cape Verde Islands in late April, but after that, their whereabouts were mostly unknown. Eventually, they were spotted near Martinique but disappeared again. Next, they were reported at Curacoa, an island near Venezuela, where they restocked supplies before heading back out to sea. There were concerns that the Spanish fleet might intercept the battleship Oregon, rushing to the East Coast. The Oregon had traveled 14,000 miles in two months from the Pacific to the Atlantic, staying vigilant for any danger. The Oregon was always prepared for battle, consuming tons of coal during its journey. Captain Clark made tough decisions, leaving slower ships behind to ensure the Oregon's timely arrival where it was needed most. The voyage continued with thrilling moments and strict precautions, sailing without lights to avoid detection."|"['1.

The entire journey from Sandy Point to Jupiter Inlet was a dark voyage. In complete darkness, we sped along, spotting lights but steering clear of the ships. We were without the right of way since we lacked a light. Even when encountering a vessel on our port side, we yielded. Day and night, the men manned the guns, never letting their guard down. They endured immense strain, going days without rest. The lookouts were doubled, and shifts changed frequently. Upon reaching Barbadoes just before dawn on May 18, we hastily loaded coal and set sail the same evening. Despite the unknown location of the fleets, we navigated carefully to avoid encounters and eventually joined the North Atlantic Squadron in Cuban waters.

"In 1493, Columbus spotted an island, later visited by Ponce de Leon in 1510, naming it San Juan Bautista. Despite Spanish control, the Dutch and English attempted takeovers. San Juan, known as the ""Rich Port of John the Baptist,"" was profitable for Spain for centuries. The city features Morro Castle, military buildings, and colorful houses with lush gardens. San Juan boasts a cathedral, theatre, city hall, and Governor-General's palace. The market women sell goods in the park, where a military band plays in the evenings. Admiral Sampson sailed to San Juan to intercept the Spanish fleet, but after a failed attempt, he redirected efforts to Havana. Cienfuegos, a port on the southern coast, was also monitored.

The Americans faced Spanish resistance as they cut the cables at Cienfuegos. Bullets from the shore rained around them, but they persisted. The ships' guns unleashed a storm of iron on the Spaniards, forcing them to seek shelter. Bravery shone as the men in the boats faced danger. The St. Louis later undertook a daring mission to cut cables at Santiago and San Juan. The Spanish fleet was expected to unite with soldiers in Havana, prompting the need to block these strategic ports. Santiago de Cuba, an ancient city, held historical significance and was a key location. The city, with its colorful buildings, towers, and cathedral, stood as a picturesque yet impoverished place.

When first arriving in Santiago, the city may appear unkempt and impoverished, with worn-down buildings and signs of decay. However, a climb up the surrounding hills reveals a stunning view of the city with its red-roofed buildings overlooking the shimmering bay. As you approach the harbor entrance, the initial sight is a gap in the hills, but soon you'll spot the picturesque Morro Castle, perched on a rock guarding the channel. This channel, though narrow, eventually leads to the expansive and charming harbor of Santiago, lined with houses along the water's edge. It was from this very harbor that Admiral Cervera and his Spanish fleet set sail on a fateful morning in May. Meanwhile, Commodore Schley, with his squadron including the Brooklyn, Massachusetts, Texas, and Iowa battleships, discovered the Spanish fleet's location after a game of hide-and-seek. Schley's keen leadership and naval experience were instrumental in locating the Spanish ships, establishing a blockade, and notifying Admiral Sampson of the discovery.|"['1.

During the Cuban blockade, our ships formed a half-circle outside the harbor, a few miles from its entrance. Big vessels like the New York, Brooklyn, Texas, Iowa, Oregon, Indiana, and Massachusetts were part of the fleet. The Gloucester gained fame among the smaller vessels. Unable to anchor in the deep waters, our ships constantly moved back and forth. Despite being unable to see the Spanish ships in the harbor, our men kept watch over the narrow channel, hills, and forts. To maintain the blockade, our ships used powerful searchlights after the moonlight faded. Four battleships rotated every two hours to illuminate the channel entrance. Blockading is demanding, requiring constant vigilance to prevent enemy ships from leaving or receiving supplies. During the blockade, our ships captured a coal-loaded vessel meant for Admiral Cervera's fleet, illustrating the importance of cutting off enemy supplies at sea.|['1.

When all the cargo was unloaded from the ship, the Florida was getting ready to sail back to the United States. Cuban soldiers lined up along the shore, with women and children standing behind them. A cheerful Cuban marching song filled the air as the Florida departed. The smaller vessels of the fleets, like torpedo-boats and armed tugboats, spent many nights on blockading duty in the Caribbean waters. Strange encounters occurred during these nights, with small craft rolling in the waves or moving in enemy territory without lights. One such encounter involved the tug-boat Leyden halting a large ship by firing warning shots. The British Captain was not pleased by this, but he took it in stride. Lieutenant Fremont, in charge of the torpedo-boat Porter, exemplified the bravery of the navy officers during these challenging times. The most significant event of the war between the United States and Spain took place in the Philippine Islands, discovered by Magellan nearly four centuries ago.|['1.

Have you ever heard of the Filipinos? They are natives of the islands, descendants of Spanish settlers. Besides them, there are native savage tribes still living in many places. The Filipinos attempted to gain independence but were unsuccessful. When they learned of the rebellion in Cuba, they tried again against Spain, sparking a new rebellion. This was the situation when the United States and Spain went to war. The United States, with ships in a Chinese port, instructed Commodore Dewey to focus on the Philippine Islands. Dewey readied his fleet, including the flagship Olympia and five other cruisers: Baltimore, Boston, Raleigh, Concord, Petrel, and the small vessel Hugh McCulloch. They painted the fleet gray to match other U.S. vessels. As they sailed towards Manila, they prepared for battle, discarding wooden items to avoid splinters. Despite the dangers, the fleet advanced towards Manila Bay, where the Spanish awaited, protected by fortresses and big guns.|['1.

The battle of May 1st, 1898, began early in the morning. The Spanish fired the first shot, but our fleet quickly retaliated. Led by the Olympia, our ships circled the bay, engaging in intense combat with the Spanish fleet near Manila. Despite the Spanish forts being well-supplied, our fleet, including the Baltimore, Raleigh, Concord, Petrel, and Boston, fought bravely. The Olympia's accurate shots caused significant damage, sinking the Reina Christina and thwarting torpedo boats. After over two hours of fighting, Commodore Dewey led a strategic retreat to rest and replenish ammunition. The men, unaware of the severity of the Spanish fleet's damage, were eager to resume the battle.

Our sailors, invigorated by a brief respite and a morning meal of bread and cold cuts, resumed their fight just before eleven in the morning. Swiftly, Spanish vessels caught fire and some even sank. Following the destruction of the Spanish fleet, a few of our ships turned to assail the forts on the shore, compelling their surrender. At one minute past one o'clock, the Spaniards lowered their flag. Despite their valor and fierce fighting, the Spanish were not accurate marksmen, resulting in the loss of eleven ships and numerous casualties. In contrast, our ships sustained minimal damage, with only seven wounded and no fatalities. Overwhelmed with relief, some of our sailors shed tears of joy, moved by the bravery and resilience displayed during the battle. The city of Manila remained unconquered that day, setting the stage for its eventual surrender. The Battle of Manila Bay stands as a historic naval triumph, showcasing the remarkable courage and strategic prowess of Commodore Dewey and his crew.|['1.

The Spanish fired their first shot from a strong battery in front of the city, and the American ship, the Concord, retaliated with two shells as the U.S. fleet sailed proudly by. The Spanish warships and the Cavité fortifications lay ahead in shallow waters that the Americans avoided. The Olympia led the fleet, closing in on the red and yellow Spanish flags. Despite shore batteries roaring, Admiral Dewey remained calm on the Olympia's bridge. A water spout signaled a Spanish mine, but no harm came. Dewey ordered the attack, and the American ships followed suit. They maneuvered in a figure-eight pattern past the Spanish ships and forts. Cavité, resembling a fishhook, housed the Spanish fleet, while a nearby town had an arsenal and navy-yard. The Spaniards falsely claimed victory after the first encounter, but Dewey's second attack swiftly defeated them, marking another triumph for the U.S. Navy.|"['1.

During the intense battle, I was part of a small group on board a ship. We were joking and laughing to calm our nerves. As we approached enemy forts, a rocket was fired, signaling the impending danger. The officers instructed us to aim carefully. The Olympia and Baltimore passed the forts unscathed, but the Raleigh was hit, causing devastation. Despite shells flying around us, we held our fire until the Spanish fleet was in sight. The battle commenced, and our marksmanship overwhelmed the enemy, sinking four of their ships and setting seven ablaze.

"Yesterday, while on land, we disabled the enemy's guns and I collected some souvenirs. Two enemy torpedo boats tried to attack us, but one was sunk, and the other got stuck on the shore. I witnessed the damage; it was severe. The Olympia, like many navy ships, has a printing press and publishes a newspaper called the ""Bounding Billow."" The newspaper described a Spanish shot hitting the Baltimore, causing damage and injuries to the crew. When news of the victory in Manila Bay reached the United States, celebrations erupted.

Before our conflict with Spain, it was believed that the days of individual bravery in the navy were over. However, Lieutenant Hobson and his crew proved otherwise. Every sailor aboard the Merrimac was prepared to follow orders, showing that our navy is filled with courageous men who will fight to the end. On a Thursday evening, the Merrimac set out for its final voyage. Despite the looming threat of the Spanish forts, the crew remained steadfast. As shots rang out, Lieutenant Hobson directed the ship, but unfortunate events led to the Merrimac sinking. The crew, clad in minimal attire, clung to a life-raft in the cold waters, evading detection by the Spaniards. Their resilience and bravery shone through as they awaited rescue, while the sun rose over the horizon, marking a new day.|"[""1.

"One hour passed as Lieutenant Hobson and his crew waited on the raft. A steam-launch approached, and they surrendered to the Spanish officer, Admiral Cervera.

Our brave men aboard the launch faced a perilous journey. They narrowly escaped enemy fire from the batteries as they steered towards safety. Eventually, they reached the New York, relieved to find refuge. Once captured, they were treated with kindness on a Spanish warship. Admiral Cervera ensured their well-being and sent word to Admiral Sampson. Despite being transferred to Morro Castle, a less comfortable prison, they remained in good care. Lieutenant Hobson even caught glimpses of our Navy's ships from his cell. Later, they were moved to another prison in Santiago. Meanwhile, other naval actions unfolded. At Cardenas, our vessels bravely engaged Spanish gunboats, resulting in the destruction of the torpedo-boat Winslow and the loss of five crew members. This tragic event contrasted with successful cable-cutting operations at Cienfuegos. Cardenas, once a thriving city, was known for its American residents and sugar plantations.

Before the marines were reinforced, they were in constant battle with cunning Spaniards who used guerilla tactics. The marines fought bravely, even though it was their first battle. Despite surprises and traps set by the Spaniards, the marines held their ground until reinforcements arrived. The Spaniards fought in unconventional ways, disguising themselves with leaves and setting traps. One marine described their tactics as sneaky and hard to detect. The marines had to be vigilant, carrying their rifles and ammunition at all times. During a morning attack while eating breakfast, they successfully fought off the enemy, leaving many casualties. The marines, enduring hunger and hardships, also faced dangers from the national weapon of Cuba, the machete.

Our ships were ready to protect Santiago and attack the forts, but the naval officers knew they needed soldiers on land to help. The ships couldn't enter the harbor until the underwater mines were cleared, but the mines couldn't be removed until the forts were taken. So, it was time for our soldiers to head to Cuba. Thousands of Regulars and Volunteers were waiting in camps in the eastern and southern U.S. to go to Cuba quickly. In mid-June, over 16,000 soldiers, led by General Shafter, set sail from Tampa to Cuba. Loading so many men, horses, food, and supplies onto 34 ships was hard work. The soldiers had a challenging voyage, but they eventually landed at Daiquiri after facing obstacles like crowded ships and bad weather. Once ashore, they had to navigate steep hills, narrow valleys, and rough terrain, working to build roads in the wet and hot conditions.|"[""1.

"Spanish soldiers from Santiago were constructing log forts and barriers to impede the advance of our troops towards the city. General Shafter, concerned about the rough terrain and the risk of fever, decided to push forward without waiting for roads to be built. The first battle in Cuba involved nearly a thousand men, including ""Regulars"" and ""Volunteers"" like the ""Rough Riders,"" a unique group of cowboys, Indians, and Eastern young men led by Lieutenant Colonel Roosevelt. Despite facing harsh conditions and an unseen enemy using smokeless bullets, the Rough Riders and their comrades fought bravely, forcing the Spaniards to retreat from the fort near Siboney. The soldiers, guided by about two hundred Cuban troops, eventually captured the fort and forced the Spaniards to flee towards Santiago."|['1.

During the Spanish-American War, a small but powerful group known as the Red Cross Society made a significant impact in Cuba. Led by the remarkable Miss Clara Barton, this society focused on caring for the sick and wounded, regardless of their nationality. The Red Cross emblem, a red cross on a white background, symbolized their mission of love and mercy. Despite being neutral in conflicts, some Spanish soldiers dishonorably attacked Red Cross doctors and nurses. The Red Cross provided vital assistance to soldiers of all sides, setting up tents and floating hospitals to aid the wounded.

Our soldiers faced a tough mission in Cuba. General Shafter, unwell, ordered the Army to march towards Santiago the next day. Before reaching Santiago, El Caney and San Juan had to be captured. At dawn on July 1st, six thousand troops, led by brave officers, advanced towards El Caney. General Shafter believed it would fall within an hour. El Caney, northeast of Santiago, had stone houses and strong defenses. Despite heavy fighting, our troops struggled. Eventually, they stormed the stone fort, causing the Spaniards to retreat. The battle lasted nearly nine hours, with heavy casualties on both sides. Brigadier-General Lawton played a key role. He had a remarkable military career, starting in the Civil War and later fighting in the Philippines.

"San Juan was well defended by trenches and forts, with Spanish bullets raining down on our troops. In the early morning, there was confusion as they awaited orders that never came. Captains and colonels took charge, improvising the best course of action. Short of heavy cannon and troubled by smoky powder, our men faced a familiar challenge. Just like at El Caney, they had to storm the forts. Colonel Roosevelt led the ""Rough Riders"" in a heroic charge, supported by other troops. Despite bullets raining down, our men bravely rushed up the heights, causing the Spaniards to flee. The battle for San Juan lasted over five hours, with many lives lost. Our weary men, without rest, buried the dead, repaired defenses, and braced for a Spanish counterattack. The fighting resumed the next day, with our troops determined to hold the hard-won heights against the Spanish forces in Santiago."|['1.

During the first day of battle, a memorable event showcased the devastating power of machine guns. From a distance across the valley, a group of Spanish cavalrymen was spotted. The order was given to aim the guns at them. Even though they were far away, requiring binoculars for accuracy, once the guns were fired, the front line of the cavalrymen fell swiftly, prompting the rest to seek cover quickly. Colonel Roosevelt, impressed by the Gatling guns' effectiveness, entrusted a light battery under their command. These Gatling guns were so potent that one of them equaled the firepower of 180 riflemen. A dynamite gun, a new addition to the artillery, caused fear among soldiers, despite its efficiency. Gun No. 2 from Captain Capron's battery was also notably effective, with one shot reportedly taking down sixteen Spaniards at once.|"['1.

General Shafter's urgent message spread across the United States, stirring anxiety. It was disheartening to consider that our soldiers, after enduring immense hardships to approach Santiago, might have to retreat due to insufficient numbers to capture the city. While our Army navigated challenging terrains towards Santiago, our Navy maintained a blockade of the harbor. Despite Lieutenant Hobson's sinking of the Merrimac, the blockade remained effective. The Spaniards, feeling the pressure, believed our Army to be larger than reality, causing concern about food scarcity in Santiago. In a bold move, Admiral Cervera led his fleet out of the harbor, hoping to aid his countrymen.

During a fierce battle, my son, a young messenger, found himself shedding layers of clothing due to the intense heat. As he dashed back and forth delivering messages, he noticed the officers similarly struggling with the sweltering conditions. At one point, he mistook a high-ranking officer for a man in pajamas, only to realize it was the officer in his nightgown, ready for battle. As the fight raged on, General Shafter made a strategic move by sending a flag of truce to the Spanish general in Santiago. This act temporarily halted the fighting, allowing civilians to flee the city before an impending attack.

On July 10th, after the truce ended, our Army and Navy fired at Santiago and continued the next day. A new truce was formed as the Spaniards needed time to consult.

On July 17th, our flag was raised in Santiago, signifying the city's possession. General Miles managed negotiations between Generals Shafter and Toral. Despite initial tensions, General Miles ensured a smooth transition. He then took control of military matters on the island, making wise decisions.

During the journey across the Pacific Ocean, a comical incident took place at Guam, one of the Ladrone Islands. The ship Charleston arrived, firing shots at a fort, but the Spanish officers there had no powder to return the salute. To their surprise, they were informed they were now prisoners, unaware that war had been declared. Meanwhile, in the Philippines, the Filipinos rebelled against the Spaniards, with Aguinaldo taking command once more. Admiral Dewey and General Merritt warned the Spanish to surrender Manila, leading to its capture. Dewey later received a hero's welcome in the United States. Aguinaldo, however, resisted American authority, sparking a rebellion that required more troops, including General Lawton, known for his bravery in Cuba. Lawton's tactics against the Filipinos mirrored those used against Native Americans, earning him respect from his soldiers.|"['1.
