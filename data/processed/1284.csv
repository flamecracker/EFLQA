Tom was busy preparing for a sky ride with Mary Nestor when Mr. Damon came running, waving his arms like an aircraft propeller. Though Tom couldn't hear due to his fur cap, Jackson did and stopped the propeller blades. Mr. Damon, panting, said he wanted to speak to Tom. Tom, focused on getting Mary ready for the ride, couldn't stop. He assured Mr. Damon they would talk later and proceeded with the preparations. As Tom ignited the engine, the propellers spun rapidly, and the plane began moving over the field. Mary felt a mix of excitement and fear as the aircraft ascended. The sensation of the earth dropping away beneath her was overwhelming, similar to being pushed into space. Tom explained that this feeling is more pronounced in a balloon than in an airplane due to the lack of stationary objects for comparison during ascent.|"['1.

Sound is produced when an object, whether solid, liquid, or gas, is in motion and the air around it is also moving. To hear sound, there must be a way to receive the sound waves, like our ears or other parts of the body. Even deaf individuals can feel vibrations through their hands or feet. They may not hear music or words but can sense the vibrations, for example, when a piano is played. Tom, an inventor, is working on reducing the noise produced by his aeroplane engine. He is experimenting with a device to muffle the sound caused by gasoline explosions in the engine cylinders. By understanding how sound travels at different speeds in various gases, Tom hopes to solve the noise issue.

Tom Swift and Mr. Damon hurried to the spot where the Air Scout had crashed earlier. It was dark and silent. They discovered a gold watch, likely belonging to Mr. Nestor, who had been injured. Tom suspected Mr. Nestor had fallen, prompting the cry for help. Regretting not being able to assist earlier, they rushed to a nearby drug store to call the Shopton hospital.

Tom and Mr. Damon tried to locate Mr. Nestor at the nearest hospital, but to their surprise, he was not there. They then attempted to check another hospital in Waterfield, but the results were the same. Eventually, they considered the Alexian Hospital in Centerford, a place often visited by tourists. Tom speculated that Mr. Nestor might have been hit by a car, prompting the need for medical attention. Despite their efforts, they couldn't find any leads on Mr. Nestor's whereabouts. Feeling anxious, Mrs. Nestor urged Tom to stay and help in the search. Tom tirelessly worked through the night, alerting the police and contacting hospitals, but Mr. Nestor remained missing.

Tom reassured Mary that her father might have been taken to a private hospital nearby by the autoists who caused the accident. He suggested that the autoists might have been scared or thought he would receive better care at a private home. Tom also considered the possibility that one of the autoists could be a doctor wanting to help. Despite the efforts to locate Mary's father, there was no news. The police and surrounding cities were involved in the search. Tom's account of the incident was shared in the newspapers, omitting his use of the new aeroplane.
