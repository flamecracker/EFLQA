"**Nutrition and Cooking Basics**

Our bodies use food to repair tissues, provide energy, and regulate processes. Foods vary in composition and function, classified into five groups: food-stuffs or principles. Cooking enhances food by softening vegetables, tenderizing meat, aiding digestion, and destroying harmful germs. Understanding stoves is crucial for successful cooking, requiring fuel, oxygen, and heat. Ovens use dampers to regulate airflow for cooking. 

For a practical lesson, bring a fruit or vegetable like apples or potatoes. Core and slice apples, fill with sugar, bake in a dish with water until soft. Serve hot or cold. Encourage students to bring dishes for sharing. Emphasize cleanliness and supervision. Follow food safety guidelines.

Water is a valuable medium for cooking. As it heats, bubbles form and grow in size, disappearing gradually. Just before reaching the boiling point, a large bubble rises occasionally, indicating the simmering point at 185°, commonly used in cooking. When many bubbles form and break, causing a commotion on the water's surface, the boiling point, 212°, is reached. Mineral matter is another essential nutrient needed by the body, found in foods like fruits and fresh green vegetables, crucial for building bones and regulating body processes. Green vegetables are important in the diet for their mineral content and should be eaten raw to retain their nutrients. When cooking, use minimal water to preserve the mineral matter. Vegetables should be seasoned with salt, pepper, and butter after cooking until tender.|"['1.

"**Preserving Fruits through Drying and Canning**

Fruits are dried to extend their shelf life by removing moisture that bacteria and mold need to grow. This process allows fruits to be stored almost indefinitely. Dried fruits can be easily prepared by soaking them in water to restore moisture before cooking until soft. Canning is another common preservation method where fruits are sterilized by boiling to destroy germs and spores. To ensure success, all equipment coming in contact with the food must be sterilized too. Good covers and new rubbers are essential for sealing cans airtight. While sugar isn't necessary for sterilization, it can enhance flavor and prolong the fruit's freshness. Various methods like the ""Open-kettle Method"" and the ""Cold-pack Method"" can be used to can fruits and vegetables, each offering unique benefits for preservation.

If beef and mutton are not common or easy to find, but rabbit is available, you can use rabbit instead of beef in the stew. After cleaning the rabbit well, cut it into eight pieces (four legs and four body pieces), season, coat with flour, brown in fat, and continue as you would with Beef Stew. Mix the dry ingredients together, add butter, and gradually mix in milk to form a soft dough. Roll out on a floured board, cut with a biscuit cutter, place on top of the stew (so they don't sink into the liquid), cover the pot tightly, let the stew simmer, and cook the dumplings for 10 minutes without lifting the lid. Place thin bacon slices in a hot pan, cook until crisp, and brown. Another way is to bake the bacon on a rack in the oven until crispy. If the meat needs a few hours to cook, split the lesson into two parts during the day. Prepare the meat and veggies half an hour before the morning session or during recess. Add veggies to the meat and make dumplings in the second class. Discuss the meat types, cooking methods, and food value. If possible, plan additional lessons on poultry. Peas, beans, and lentils are rich in protein, carbs, and minerals, making them a great meat substitute. They need to soak overnight and cook for a long time. Plan ahead if baking beans.

To make a good cup of coffee, use two tablespoons of ground coffee for each cup of boiling water. Put the coffee in the pot and add a teaspoon of cold water for each tablespoon of coffee. Pour boiling water over the coffee and boil for 3 minutes. Let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. To clarify the coffee, mix a small amount of egg white and shell with the grounds. Discuss coffee and tea preparation in class to compare with cocoa. Start by discussing cake preparation and baking it while preparing cocoa. Yeast bread rises due to gas produced by yeast feeding on starch in the dough. Yeast works best at body temperature and can sour if left too long. Kneading and baking at the right time prevent souring. Yeast is found naturally on hops and is sold in dry or moist cakes. Liquid yeast made from dry cakes is more active. Yeast added to batter is a sponge, and when flour is added, it becomes dough. Thorough kneading and baking are crucial for successful bread.|['1.

Sugar is a valuable source of heat and energy for the body. While easily digested, consuming large amounts can be irritating. It's best to have sugar in small quantities, ideally during meals or with other foods. Eating a couple of candy pieces after a meal isn't harmful, but regular snacking between meals can have negative effects. Sugar is naturally found in many fruits, vegetables, and milk. When adding sugar to recipes, it's important not to use excessive amounts. It's beneficial to discuss sugar's role in the body. Making cookies or candy for a school event can be a fun way to learn about sugar cookery and its principles. For example, cream butter with sugar and eggs, then add milk and dry ingredients. Shape the dough, dip in cinnamon sugar, and bake. Another option is to make peanut cookies by mixing butter, sugar, egg, milk, dry ingredients, peanuts, and lemon juice, then baking with a peanut on top. Lastly, a brittle candy can be made by boiling molasses, sugar, and butter until brittle, then pulling and cutting into pieces.|['1.

In the sewing class at the rural school, students will have limited time for practice during the regular session. To encourage further progress, students may be allowed to continue their work outside of class once they have mastered the basic stitch and can be trusted to work independently. This privilege can be earned as a reward for quick learning or assigned as homework. Students may also arrange to meet outside of school hours for additional practice. However, all work done outside of class must be closely supervised, with students bringing their work to the teacher for regular inspection. Necessary equipment includes needles, pins, thread, tape-measure, thimble, scissors, and a box for storing materials. Before starting on actual fabric, students can practice folding hems on paper to ensure they understand the technique. The teacher should emphasize cleanliness, neatness, and proper hand care before each sewing session.|"['1.

In sewing class, students should start by deciding on the size and shape of their bags using the materials they brought. The bags don't need to be identical. The teacher will guide them in using the materials effectively, straightening, pulling into place, and measuring carefully. After cutting out the bags, they should baste the sides. Running stitch involves passing the needle in and out of the material evenly on both sides. The teacher will demonstrate running stitch with a back-stitch. Students will sew the sides of the bag using this stitch, starting 3/4 inch from the top to leave space for the drawstring. Seams might need to be finished later. The drawstring is threaded through the hem, and slits are left for the cord. Students will learn to overcast seams neatly and discuss hemming depth, turning, and basting. If time runs out, hemming can be assigned as homework, with each student bringing their finished work to the next class.|['1.

For this lesson, instead of using cords, you can use narrow tape. Cut two pieces of tape, each twice as long as the bag's width plus two inches. Run one tape from one side and the other from the opposite side, encircling the bag entirely. Connect the tape ends this way: If students can't provide cords, the teacher should have enough on hand. Ensure bags are ready for the cord before class. Start by explaining how to make the cord, estimating the amount needed, and demonstrate with a student's help. Number students for group work. After running the cord into the bag, suggest ways to neatly finish the ends. This lesson will focus on running and weaving. Darning fills holes in material with thread to repair or reinforce weak spots. Use a darning-ball or cardboard under the hole. Extend the darn a quarter inch past the hole's edge, using fine stitches in rows in one direction, then crossing with rows at a right angle. Ensure no raw edges are visible by picking up and dropping the material's edge around the hole and weaving evenly in and out. Discuss foot and stocking care, demonstrate darning on coarse material with yarn and needle during class. Assign more darning practice if students finish one darn. This lesson will cover measuring, trimming, basting, and hemming. A patch is a piece of fabric sewn onto a garment to repair a worn area. Match the patch fabric's color and quality as closely as possible to the original.|"['1.

In class, the teacher will show how to patch a large piece of cotton. Students will practice patching a paper with a hole, following steps like examining the article, calculating patch size, placing it, trimming the fabric, basting, and hemming. When making an apron, measure the skirt length, add 6 inches for hem and seams, then cut the material. For the bib, cut a 9x12 inch piece. Discuss suitable materials like muslin or gingham. Each student needs 1.5-2 yards of fabric. If sewing is hard, skip the bib and straps for a simple apron. Students will measure themselves for the apron, working carefully and keeping the workspace clean. Uneven basting helps guide stitching, with stitches 1/8 inch apart and spaces 3/8 inch.|['1.

The teacher will carefully guide the students through the steps of attaching a bib to a belt and completing the belt. If the sewing is not finished in class, it may be assigned as homework. This lesson emphasizes the importance of neatness in dressing by teaching the best methods of fastening garments. The position of a button is determined by measuring one inch from the right end of the band over the left end. The button's placement is marked with a pin on the left end of the band. A double thread is secured on the right side of the band, passed through the button's holes, and stitched through the band close to the first stitch. A pin is placed under the button during stitching and removed once the button is firmly attached. The thread is neatly fastened on the wrong side with a few small stitches. The teacher should discuss garment fastening methods and demonstrate sewing buttons. Students will sew buttons on the apron band and make buttonholes. They will practice making buttonholes on cotton strips before creating them on the apron. Additionally, students will learn to create a holder for hot dishes using quilted padding or outing flannel covered with percale or denim.|"['1.

Household Science classes in rural schools are often thought to require expensive equipment found in urban settings, hindering their introduction. However, many rural schools in the United States, Saskatchewan, and some in our Province have successfully taught the subject with specially designed equipment. For instance, students can create practical items like holders and caps using simple materials like denim, percale, and huckaback. A cap can be made by cutting a 21-inch diameter circle from material and adding a drawstring tape inside the hem. The cap should be carefully sewn with a running-stitch and hemming-stitch, showcasing the skills students have learned. This hands-on approach allows students to develop their sewing abilities and create useful items for everyday use.|['1.

The Household Science Cabinets shown serve a dual purpose. Firstly, they provide storage and working space for students. Secondly, they offer an engaging manual training project for a boys' club, promoting collaboration between practical woodwork and domestic science. The racks for covers and pie tins in the drawings are constructed from specific dimensions of wood pieces. Before applying enamel, a base coat of white-lead paint is recommended. While white enamel is an option for finishing, it is pricier than paint or stain. Schools can use oil stoves for cooking, with different burner options available. Utensil quantity depends on the community size. Glass canisters are ideal for storage, but substitutes like fruit jars or tin cans can be used. Students can label their storage items for organization. It's suggested that students bring their own individual equipment to save costs, like soup bowls, cups, plates, and utensils.|['1.

In many instances, students may not find their school lunch appealing. Often, the food is carried in inadequate containers like tin pails, absorbing unwanted tastes. It might even be wrapped in newspapers or unclean cloths, affecting its flavor and hygiene. This is unfair to students who travel long distances to school. Proper nutrition is crucial for their physical and mental well-being. Many health issues among students are linked to poor nutrition, with rural areas showing higher percentages of physical defects due to malnutrition. Therefore, it's essential to ensure that school lunches are nutritious and served attractively. Teachers should supervise lunchtime to promote good eating habits, cleanliness, and manners. By creating a pleasant dining environment, students can learn about food selection, hygiene, and social skills.

"A revised version for middle school students:

One plan, known as the ""Crete"" plan of Household Science, was first implemented in Nebraska, U.S.A. It involves teaching cooking skills in the homes of skilled women in the community under educational supervision. Initially used in small-town high schools, it can be adapted for rural schools. Women skilled in cooking become part of the school staff, teaching Household Science using their own kitchens. To start, interested women meet to discuss the plan and volunteer to instruct. Classes of six to ten students meet once a week at the instructor's home. Lessons cover recipes, ingredients, cooking methods, and common mistakes. Students take notes, practice at home, and receive feedback. After months of practice, students can showcase their dishes in a school exhibition. This practical approach allows students to learn real-life skills in a familiar setting."|"['1.

For insulation in a fireless cooker, various materials can be used. Asbestos and mineral wool are the safest as they are non-flammable. Other suitable options include ground cork, hay, excelsior, Spanish moss, wool, and crumpled paper. Among these, crumpled paper is preferred for its cleanliness and odorless properties, retaining heat effectively when packed correctly. To ensure air-tightness, line the box with heavy paper or newspaper layers. Asbestos sheeting can also be used. When using paper, crush single sheets and create a layer at least four inches deep at the bottom of the container, placing the inside container in the center and packing more crushed paper around it tightly. If using other materials, pack them similarly. For added safety with extra heat sources, non-flammable materials like asbestos or mineral wool are recommended. A pad of asbestos at the bottom and layers between the nest lining and packing material are advisable. The cooking kettle should be cylindrical, durable, and free from crevices, with a well-fitting lid. A metal lining is necessary if using an extra heat source to prevent fire hazards. A cushion filled with cotton, crumpled paper, or excelsior should fill the remaining space to ensure proper insulation.|['1.
