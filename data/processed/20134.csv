"""Sue excitedly urged Bunny to have one more turn on the teeter-totter in the yard. Bunny, clutching his mother's oversized black handbag, hesitated.

Up and down went the children, laughing and having fun. Sue felt joyous and started to sing a little song, with Bunny joining in. It was the old rhyme of the Cow that Jumped Over the Moon. Sue suggested they leave for the store to avoid their mother's disapproval. They decided to let their friends play on the seesaw until they returned. Bunny and Sue were off to the store to run an errand for their mother. Suddenly, a big yellow dog appeared, snatching their mother's pocketbook and dashing away. Bunny and Sue chased after the dog, following it into a carpenter shop. They searched through piles of sawdust and lumber, hoping to find the dog and retrieve the pocketbook.|"['1.

Bunny Brown and his sister Sue were startled by a harsh voice and the door locking behind them in the carpenter shop. They paused, momentarily forgetting the missing yellow dog and the pocketbook. Bunny finally spoke up, suggesting it was a mistake. Sue, in her excitement, explained how Mr. Foswick mistook them for troublemaking boys. They decided to head back to the front door to clear up the misunderstanding. The siblings lived in Bellemere by the sea, with their father in the boat and fish business. The story unfolds with their adventures and friends like Bunker Blue and Uncle Tad. In previous books, they had fun at Grandpa's farm, Aunt Lu's city home, and Camp Rest-a-While. They also had a Shetland pony and performed in a show. The missing dog, Splash, led them to hope the new big dog might fill the void.|"['1.

"""Yes,"" agreed Bunny's brother. He attempted to speak cheerfully, being a year older than Sue and believing that boys shouldn't be as easily frightened as girls. ""But I think we can escape,"" Bunny continued. ""Mr. Foswick mistook us for troublemakers. We'll call out and clarify we're not."" ""Yes, I understand,"" he replied. ""There are windows. I'll open one, and we can exit through it. They're not too high from the ground. We escaped through a window once when Bunker Blue accidentally locked us in the shed on the dock, and we can do it now."" ""Perhaps,"" Bunny conceded. ""I'll shout for him to come out. He probably took the wallet as a joke. Here, Splash, come out! We won't harm you!"" he shouted, moving away from the locked door. ""Come on, Splash!"" ""I realize it's not Splash,"" Bunny concurred. ""But it might be. Splash is a dog's name, and if this dog hears me, it might come out. Come here, old buddy!"" he coaxed. However, no dog emerged from the shavings, sawdust, or boards.

Bunny told his sister about a plan to escape through a window by using a hammer to remove the nails. In a carpenter shop, they found tools like hammers, chisels, and planes, but they knew not to touch the sharp ones. Bunny had learned from his father and Bunker Blue how to pull out nails safely. He remembered how windows were nailed shut from his family's cottage on an island. As Bunny tried to remove the nails from a window, the hammer slipped and broke the glass. Sue spotted Mr. Reinberg from the dry goods store and suggested calling for help. Bunny regretted breaking the glass and wished they could open a door instead.|"['1.

"""I'm sorry for locking you in, Bunny and Sue,"" Mr. Foswick apologized. ""I mistook you for mischievous boys. I had to keep the doors locked because of them,"" he explained. Bunny then shared, ""We were chasing a dog with my mom's pocketbook, and it ran in here."" Mr. Foswick hadn't seen the dog but mentioned holes in the back wall.

Bunny and Sue's mother expressed that the trouble they faced could have been avoided if they had gone to the store immediately instead of playing on the seesaw and leaving the pocketbook unattended. Despite the mishap, their mother reassured them that their father might find the missing items. The family remained optimistic, hoping that the dog might have dropped the pocketbook somewhere nearby. The children felt uneasy that evening, unable to enjoy the warm summer night outdoors. The next morning, the family, along with some friends, visited the hotel to seek assistance. Bunny and Sue were hopeful as they walked with their father, eagerly anticipating good news.

"""No,"" he said, responding to her expression, ""we didn't find the pocketbook. But Mr. Foswick plans to tidy up his shop. He will clear the sawdust and shavings away, and then we can search better.""

""Mr. Foswick wasn't too bothered,"" Mr. Brown continued. ""The troublesome boys, as he calls them, bother him by coming in through the front door while he's busy at the back. They scatter sawdust and shavings everywhere.""

""Oh, no,"" Bunny explained. ""We ran in after the dog, and there were no big boys. We didn't see the dog leave, but Mr. Foswick mentioned holes in the back where he could escape.""

""Let's talk about something else,"" chuckled Bunny's father. ""How about Christmas Tree Cove? Would you like to spend the summer there?"" Christmas Tree Cove was a bay in Turtle River, near Bellemere, with evergreen trees and small islands. It was a spot for camping and picnics.

Bunny and Sue were relieved that their mother was no longer upset about the lost ring. The next day was busy with preparations for their trip to Christmas Tree Cove.

Bunny and Sue were thrilled to be setting sail on the _Fairy_ with Captain Ross to Christmas Tree Cove. After a night of hard work preparing, Uncle Tad, their jolly companion, was all set with his knapsack and rations for the trip. The next morning, they boarded the boat at their father's dock. Bunny and Sue bid goodbye to their friends and embarked on their adventure with their family and the crew. The _Fairy_ was spacious enough for everyone to sleep comfortably. As they cruised, they enjoyed the sights and planned to spend a few days before reaching the Cove. During one afternoon, a canoe crossed their path, and a near collision occurred. Bunny's quick action prevented a mishap, and they narrowly avoided a man overboard situation.|"['1.

"Bunny knew the urgent call ""Man overboard!"" meant swift action was needed. Without hesitation, he grabbed a life ring from his father's dock and tossed it into the water, ensuring the attached rope was secure to the boat. Bunker Blue, acting swiftly, pulled a wire to slow down the boat. He then joined Bunny, throwing another life ring into the water. Mr. Brown reassured everyone that the swimmers were safe, thanks to the life rings. The group was soon brought aboard the _Fairy_, with the young men and women climbing up the ropes from the buoys. Bunker Blue, towing the overturned canoe, was the last to come on board, securing the canoe to the boat's rail.

"Captain Ross expressed his relief at the situation, as Bunny and Sue observed water dripping from the canoe and its occupants. One of the young men suggested letting the damaged canoe drift ashore and offered to help retrieve the paddles. Mrs. Brown insisted on changing their wet clothes and led them below deck. Uncle Tad assisted in recovering the paddles. The young men declined changing, mentioning their ability to swim well. The group decided to stay overnight at a dock near a summer hotel.

After dinner on the _Fairy_, Uncle Tad guided the two kids ashore. Bunny and Sue had gotten their mom's okay to ride the merry-go-round. It was a grand one, playing cheerful tunes, with large, brightly painted animals. Uncle Tad showed them around the other attractions near the big hotel. Bunny somehow strayed from them while Sue and Uncle Tad were watching a man create glass figures. Before they could react, something odd occurred. The goat Bunny was on leaped onto the merry-go-round's platform. The platform was wide, with wooden animals and seats for older folks. The live goat and Bunny surprised everyone. A lady thought a wooden animal had come to life. Thankfully, a young man helped her. The goat, resembling the wooden creatures, stood calmly. Eventually, Bunny safely got off the goat with the help of a man.|"[""1.

The little boy apologized for unintentionally riding a goat at the fair. The goat's owner kindly offered him and his sister a proper ride on a saddle the next day. Everyone laughed about the goat ride on the boat. The next morning, Bunker Blue, the boat boy, predicted a storm. Bunny and Sue were put to bed, and canvas straps were secured to prevent them from falling during the rough weather. Later that night, the storm hit, tossing Bunny and Sue in their berths. Mother Brown, wet from the storm, ensured the children were safe. She carried Sue to a different room, dressing her amid the boat's rocking. Bunny struggled to dress but managed without injury.|"['1.

The captain of the boat decided to guide the boat to safety at Clam Cove during a storm. Bunny and Sue, though initially startled by the storm, found comfort in the calmness of their family and crewmates. The storm worsened, but Captain Ross skillfully navigated the boat to the sheltered harbor of Clam Cove. The boat was secured with the anchor, providing a more stable environment despite the wind and rain. Bunny and Sue observed the clam boats in action, marveling at the process of clam raking. The children were captivated by the sight, while Captain Ross engaged them with a riddle. Sue briefly lost sight of Bunny on the boat, causing a moment of worry common on water journeys when a child goes missing.|"['1.

"Sue hurried to the boat's side, peering into the water, hoping to spot Bunny. The _Fairy_ remained anchored in Clam Cove, waiting for the storm to pass. ""What's wrong?"" inquired Captain Ross, mending sails with Bunker Blue. Concerned, they joined the search for Bunny. Below deck, Bunny was nowhere to be found. Sue then discovered an overturned rowboat and called out, finding Bunny underneath, pondering about a missing pocketbook. His parents advised him not to hide and to be cautious on the boat and at Christmas Tree Cove."|"[""1.

Chuckling, he explained, ""If you drift too far out, the soap might wash you ashore!"" The sailor jovially joked, ""Soap washes, you see."" Uncle Tad praised the riddle and planned to share it with a friend. As supper was served on the calm night, the boat gently glided on the water. Suddenly, a jolt shook the boat, causing it to tilt.

Captain Ross suggested sailing when the engine failed, and the boat wouldn't budge. With the sail up, the _Fairy_ smoothly glided towards Christmas Tree Cove. As they neared the shore, the green trees and houses came into view. The boat docked, and the Browns began unloading their belongings for the summer. Mrs. Madden welcomed them to the bungalow. Suddenly, a crash was heard, and Sue found Bunny stuck in a barrel. With help, Bunny was freed unharmed. Bunny explained he was climbing to reach some food when the boards slipped.

Meanwhile, their parents were settling in at the bungalow, with the help of Captain Ross, Bunker Blue, and Uncle Tad. After a tasty supper prepared by Bunker Blue and Uncle Tad, Bunny and Sue went back to play at the cottage. Later, during a walk on the beach, Bunny and Sue seemed preoccupied, possibly due to the lost pocketbook. Mrs. Brown comforted Bunny, ensuring he drifted off to sleep peacefully.|"['1.

The following day and the days that followed were filled with happiness for Bunny Brown and his sister Sue. They played with their friends, waded in the water, sailed toy boats, and built sandcastles. Sometimes, while relaxing on the beach, Bunny would gaze back at the dense green clusters of evergreen trees that surrounded Christmas Tree Cove. The woods provided a pleasant, shady, and cool retreat, with brown pine needles covering the ground. The sunlight filtered through the thick branches, creating a serene atmosphere. As evening approached, Bunny and Sue found themselves lost among the Christmas trees, feeling as if it were darker than it actually was. Sue, trying to be brave, compared their situation to make-believe, similar to scenes in movies. Eventually, they heard rustling in the bushes and were relieved to find Bunker Blue, Mr. Brown's boat boy, coming to their rescue.|"['1.

Sue was relieved to see Bunker as he assured them they were no longer lost. However, the missing pocketbook and ring were likely gone forever. Mrs. Brown cautioned Bunny and Sue about venturing into the dense woods alone, emphasizing the importance of staying together. At Christmas Tree Cove, the siblings enjoyed various activities like building sand houses, paddling in the water, sailing boats, and picnicking on the beach. During one such picnic, Bunny hurt his toe while playing in the water, prompting Sue to rush to their mother for help.

When Mrs. Brown and Sue arrived at the pool, Bunny was using a piece of driftwood as a crutch due to a crab that had nipped his toe while he was wading. The crab had been caught in the pool when the tide went down. Bunny's mother saw the crab had pinched his toe, but luckily it did not draw blood. Sue, relieved the crab didn't pinch her, was wiggling her toes in the sand. Mrs. Brown explained that the crab pinched Bunny because it felt threatened. Later, the children enjoyed sailing in a small boat with Bunker Blue, who had rigged a sail for it.

Mrs. Brown witnessed a sudden dark shape sliding over the sailboat's side, hearing Sue's cries as Bunker lunged for something in the water. Uncle Tad, fixing a fishing rod nearby, noticed Mrs. Brown's alarm and her rush to the dock. Spotting Bunny and Sue's sailboat across the cove with Bunker, Uncle Tad grasped the situation. Bunker rescued Bunny from the water, and soon the sailboat sailed back safely. Though Bunny was wet, he was unharmed. Mrs. Brown scolded Bunny for not following instructions, forbidding him from sailing that week. The incident occurred in shallow waters, and Bunker's swimming skills ensured everyone's safety.

Bunny and Sue lived near the water in Bellemere and knew the importance of helping someone who falls into the water. When Harry Slater, a new boy, struggled in the water, Bunny quickly pulled him out. Bodies in water weigh less, making it easier to lift someone out. Harry's mother, Mrs. Slater, was grateful as she hugged Bunny. The lifeguard also helped bring Harry to shore. Soon, Bunny, Sue, and Harry became friends. They later went clam digging when the tide was out, using shovels to find the clams buried under the sand. Bunny explained how clams live and how to dig them out. When Sue got stuck in the mud, Bunny likened it to a muck hole in a swamp, but assured her she wouldn't sink to China.|"['1.

Sue, Bunny, and Harry were out clam-digging when Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Slater noticed them. The children were laughing as Sue used Bunny and Harry as crutches to lift her feet from the muck. Mrs. Slater shared how her dog, Sandy, had gone missing, and Harry expressed missing his dog too. The conversation continued indoors as a storm approached, and Mr. Brown lit candles and kerosene lamps due to the unreliable electric service. Mrs. Brown wondered if the dog that took her pocketbook might be the same one Bunny and Sue saw. Mr. Brown suggested the dog might have seemed larger due to the quick encounter. The family and guests settled indoors as the storm intensified.|"['1.

"""It would be odd if our dog caused all this trouble with your pocketbook,"" Harry's mom said. ""Sandy had a habit of taking things. He even snatched one of my gloves when he jumped out of the car."" They chatted about the dog, but as the storm worsened, they decided to head back to the hotel. A car arrived, and they left. ""Mr. Slater is looking for our lost dog,"" she mentioned. The storm raged all night and the next day. Bunny and Sue stayed indoors, entertained by Uncle Tad and Bunker Blue. The wind brought a chest closer to shore. The kids, Harry, and his mom watched as it neared the beach. ""It's probably not what you think,"" she smiled. ""Let's see what's inside,"" she added. The box seemed to capture Bunny's imagination about pirate gold. Mrs. Slater, now intrigued, suggested they wait for it to wash ashore on a nearby point of land. The waves were still rough from the storm."|"[""1. What did Sandy snatch from Harry's mom's car?\nA) Pocketbook\nB) Glove\nC) Hat\nD) Scarf\nE) Sunglasses"", '2.

"""Oh no!"" cried Bunny, watching as Harry removed his shoes and socks. ""Things move easier in water. I can move a big boat alone in water, but not on land. The box isn't very big."" The box was near the shore now, and Bunny and Harry waded out to retrieve it. Mrs. Slater and Sue saw that the box was square, about three feet in size, with a cover. ""Grab hold now!"" Bunny instructed Harry, and they guided the box to the beach. It grounded in shallow water, too heavy to move further. ""We can write to Mr. Ravenwood of Sea Gate about finding his box,"" suggested Harry's mother. ""But we must move it higher up the beach to prevent it from washing away."" The rising tide turned the strip of sand into an island, forcing them to wade to shore. ""I'll take off my shoes and stockings!"" exclaimed Sue, preparing to cross. Mrs. Slater followed suit, realizing the water would get deeper with the rising tide. They all prepared to wade when a voice called out to them."|['1.

Not long after, Bunker rowed to where the box lay, with Bunny, Sue, and others nearby. The land was turning into an island as the tide rose. Mrs. Brown decided to write to Mr. Frank Ravenwood of Sea Gate to retrieve the box. Uncle Tad and Bunker moved it to the woodshed for safekeeping. Bunny, Sue, and Harry played while waiting for Mr. Ravenwood. Bunny's mom read a letter from Mr. Ravenwood, mentioning a lost dog named Sandy. Mrs. Slater shared how Sandy went missing near Bellemere. The Slaters and Browns realized Sandy might have taken Mrs. Brown's pocketbook.

"""It's uncertain if this is our dog,"" Mrs. Slater continued. ""We'll know when he comes for his box. After Sandy vanished, my husband placed ads in seaside papers.

Even if your dog took the pocketbook, it might be lost."" Bunny, Sue, and Harry anxiously awaited Mr. Ravenwood's arrival by boat with the strange dog.

Mrs. Slater claimed Sandy as their own, recounting the peculiar tale from when Sandy ran away to the discovery of their dog in the box. The mystery deepened as Bunny and Sue suspected Sandy of causing their troubles, even getting locked in at Mr. Foswick's carpenter shop. Mr. Ravenwood, the carpenter, explained how Sandy found his way to him on a dock in Bellemere. Sandy, a big yellow dog, hopped into his boat and refused to leave, so Mr. Ravenwood took him to his shop. Sandy's real name was Davy Jones. Mr. Ravenwood lost his box of wooden patterns in a storm after Sandy came aboard. The box floated away, prompting the search for its owner.

A man found money in a pocketbook, including nickels, pennies, and a five-dollar bill, which was covered in oil but could be cleaned. The pocketbook was thrown overboard and later retrieved thanks to Sandy, a dog who had carried it on board a boat. Sandy had hidden the pocketbook under the boat's wheel, causing the machinery to stop. The pocketbook and a diamond ring inside were recovered, bringing joy to Mrs. Brown. The children, Bunny Brown and Sue, had many adventures during their time at Christmas Tree Cove.
