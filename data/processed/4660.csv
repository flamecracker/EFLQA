The young artist, Bowen, ventured into the bustling city streets after observing the faces of young girls for a potential sketch. His discerning eye noted imperfections even in the youngest faces. Peg, a woman he encountered, appeared to be the guardian of a child named Ida. Mistakenly assuming Peg was Ida's attendant due to their differing attire, Bowen followed them to Peg's dwelling. Upon overhearing their conversation, he realized Peg was actually Ida's guardian. Intrigued by Ida's face, Bowen expressed his interest in sketching her for a project. Peg, enticed by the promise of money, agreed to the arrangement, unaware of the potential consequences. Meanwhile, Jack embarked on a journey to Philadelphia to visit his uncle's bakery.

Time passed slowly for Jack. Each hour felt like it contained twice the usual minutes. Hungry and alone, he longed for his friend Peg. The old man assured Jack of good treatment despite Peg's absence. As Jack was about to ask more, the old man pointed to a plate of food and a sofa for rest.

Jack paced the room anxiously, torn between the idea of imprisonment being better than freedom under such conditions. Despite the strict watch over him, he was given a glimmer of hope by the promise of something to occupy his time. Lacking a wide selection of books, the offer was made to provide what they could. Intrigued by a unique book recounting Baron Trenck's daring escapes from political imprisonment, Jack immersed himself in the thrilling accounts.

Jack, armed with a sharp jack-knife, decided to wait until evening to begin his escape. He feared being caught during the day.
