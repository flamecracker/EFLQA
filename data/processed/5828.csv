Sut Simpson described the dangers of settling in Apache territory, warning the group about the fierce Comanches and Apaches. Caleb Barnwell, undeterred, explained their familiarity with the native tribes. Simpson, frustrated, likened their situation to a hungry hound devouring meat.

Fred, a young lad, strained to hear any sound that might reveal the location of the feared chief, Lone Wolf. Uncertain of Lone Wolf's next move, Fred wondered if the chief would retreat or seek revenge. With thoughts racing, Fred signaled for his friend Mickey. Mickey, surprised by Fred's encounter, likened Lone Wolf to an owl, able to see well at night. Together, they cautiously approached where Thompson, another companion, had been stationed. To their shock, they found Thompson slumped against a tree, seemingly asleep. Mickey, both amused and frustrated, nudged Thompson awake, scolding him for neglecting his duty.

Footsteps rustled through the leaves, and two figures retreated into the shadowy woods, anticipating the approach of the newcomers. The distinct sound of their steps hinted at their identity. Mickey identified them, and they were the men meant to relieve Thompson and the Irishman. Shocked by the news of Thompson's demise, they swiftly reported detecting movements of figures and horses near the settlement. With the looming threat of an Indian attack, urgent preparations were underway. Fred, with keen eyesight, stationed himself near the river. Climbing a tree for a better view, he spotted a horseman racing towards the settlement. The arrival of Sut Simpson, the scout, brought urgent warnings of an imminent Apache attack.

The settlers were in a dire situation. The Apaches, armed and mounted on horses, approached the valley where the pioneers were gathered. The Apaches, skilled in horsemanship, circled around the settlement, firing shots. The settlers, having gained experience from skirmishes with the Apaches during their journey, stood their ground with coolness and readiness.

The Apache tribe was surprised by the settlers' strong defense. The settlers, led by Caleb Barnwell, had wisely organized themselves in New Boston, a city built in a circular layout with a central grassy court for their horses. Anticipating an Apache attempt to steal their horses, the settlers were vigilant. When the Apaches massed above them, the settlers readied their weapons. The Apaches charged down the slope towards the horses, but the settlers' precise volleys caused chaos among the attackers. Lone Wolf, the Apache chief, realized their mistake and planned a more strategic attack. Fred Munson, watching from a tree, suddenly realized his vulnerable position. As the Apaches lingered nearby, Fred cautiously climbed down, wary of being discovered. Despite the danger, Fred remained hidden, pondering his next move.|"[""1.

Fred, a young boy, found himself hiding in a tree, anxiously waiting for darkness to fall. He feared the Apaches, especially Lone Wolf, seeking revenge. As he waited, his imagination ran wild, hearing every rustle below. Suddenly, he spotted an Indian sneaking below him. Though not Lone Wolf, the Indian was just as menacing. Fred knew the risks of trying to rejoin his friends after dark, especially with the Indians lurking. He remembered Mickey, a fellow scout who had not returned. Unlike Fred, Mickey was armed and mounted on a swift mustang. Fred's loyal steed, Hurricane, was also out of reach.

Silence followed the commotion, and the young fugitive's heart raced with hope until a noise made him glance back. His horror grew as he saw an Indian runner closing in on him. The lad felt like he was in a nightmare but pushed on with despair. The Apache's speed far surpassed his own, and the warrior's grasp on Fred caused him to cry out and falter. Sut Simpson's voice spurred Fred to action, and he broke free, only to face another Apache on horseback. Bullets flew, but the Apache skillfully shielded himself with the horse and swiftly snatched Fred, riding off triumphantly. Despite the whites' rage, no one dared to shoot the Apache who cleverly used Fred as a shield. Lone Wolf, the captor, rode off with Fred, leaving the whites helpless. Fred realized his fate and abandoned hope of appealing to the merciless Indians.|"[""1.

The boy, feeling helpless like a baby, stopped trying to escape his captor, fearing the Indians' temper. Surprisingly, the chief spared his life, making him hope for rescue. Lone Wolf, the chief, gathered over a hundred warriors for a discussion under the moonlight on the prairie. They planned to attack New Boston, angry at the settlers' intrusion.

The brave warrior stood behind Lone Wolf, the chief, and a bullet meant for him. The shot came from the right, near the settlement, where a mysterious rider fired. Lone Wolf recognized the taunt in Apache language, a challenge from his old enemy. Lone Wolf, treacherous and lacking honor, handed a boy to a warrior and rode towards his foe.

Lone Wolf appeared to be contemplating a charge down the valley, with his warriors gathering on the slope. However, they were met with a fierce fire and quickly retreated. Despite his initial fury, Lone Wolf regained his composure and withdrew his warriors. Sut's mission was to recapture the boy, a desperate task.

Fred Munson's unforgettable experience as an Apache prisoner left a lasting impression. Witnessing Lone Wolf's fierce battle with Sut Simpson from the back of a horse, Fred feared for Simpson's life. Lone Wolf's return without a trophy signaled Simpson's survival. Despite Lone Wolf's anger, he left with his warriors, planning a stronger return. Fred anticipated harsh treatment from Lone Wolf but was surprised to remain with his repulsive deputy, Waukko. Known for his cruelty, Waukko's appearance terrified Fred. As they galloped northward, Fred's thoughts drifted to his father and escape hopes. Falling asleep against Waukko, Fred was unaware of the danger he was in.

When Fred woke up, he found himself among mountains instead of the prairie where he was before. The Apaches had stopped in a valley. Lone Wolf, their leader, gave an inspiring speech to his warriors. The warriors dismounted, and the mustangs grazed while the hunters brought back game for breakfast. Fred observed everything with curiosity, noticing that the wounded Apache warriors from the previous night were nowhere to be seen.

The meat was quickly prepared for the Apaches, who ate like wild animals, using only their fingers and teeth. While the warriors discussed plans with Lone Wolf, Fred felt ignored. Lone Wolf seemed to decide to ransom Fred by taking him into the mountains. The group split, with Lone Wolf heading left and Waukko right, possibly to avoid pursuit. Fred was relieved by the smaller group but still wary of Waukko. The day was pleasant as they rode through winding mountain gorges. Fred tried to talk to Waukko but was met with silence. The rugged landscape continued, with steep peaks visible in all directions. Despite the scenery, Fred remained hopeful yet cautious about his situation.|"['1.

The Apache warriors were riding through the mountains, hungry but determined to press on. Suddenly, their leader, Waukko, became excited, signaling to his companions about something ahead. As they halted, Fred suspected a quarrel brewing among them, possibly involving him. The tension escalated until they dismounted and faced each other. The dispute was about whether to continue directly or take a detour to avoid potential enemies from other tribes nearby. Waukko's authority as the leader settled the argument, and they decided to proceed up the ravine. They had spotted a campfire ahead, which could signal danger or be a strategic move by other tribes.

In this situation, the Kiowa tribe was using stealth to ambush their victims. The Kiowa warriors had hidden themselves well, making it hard to detect their positions. Waukko, along with Fred and his guardian, were being closely watched by the Apaches. As Waukko and one of his warriors moved to scout the campfire, Fred found himself alone with another Apache. Despite feeling trapped, Fred saw an opportunity for escape. The Apaches were focused on deciphering the signal fire's meaning, allowing Fred a chance to plan his escape. The ravine they were in presented challenges for both the Apaches and Fred, with limited hiding spots.

The experienced scout could not hear the subtle change but sensed the importance. The Native American noticed the difference, dismounted, and advanced cautiously with his horse and the boy. Fred's heart raced with hope as he saw an opportunity to escape. With a loose rein, he guided the horse quietly until the Indian turned back. Fred spurred the horse, galloping away.

The boy, Fred, had a narrow escape from an Apache warrior chasing him through a ravine. Just when it seemed like the Apache would catch him, a group of Kiowas hiding nearby intervened by firing shots at the warrior. This unexpected turn of events confused everyone involved, giving Fred a chance to flee. As Fred dashed away, the Kiowas, not fond of him either, decided to let him go temporarily, believing they could capture him later. Despite being wounded slightly, the Apache was surprised by the shots and paused, allowing Fred to gain some distance.

Fred cautiously made his way up the mountain, reassured he was on the right path when he spotted the campfire's smoke against the sky. As he crept closer, his hunger waned, replaced by a sense of danger. He suspected the fire was a trap set by Indians. Hesitating, he considered retreating.

After examining the area, Fred gained courage and observed the surroundings, which held a glimmer of hope. In front of the sleeping Indian, he spotted what seemed to be animal bones, likely from a deer or buffalo. The question arose - how could he obtain them without being detected? Despite the risk, driven by hunger, Fred decided to try. He watched the Kiowa closely, waiting for a chance. As he cautiously approached the food, remnants of antelope meat, left by the Kiowas, he couldn't resist and began eating like a starving animal. Consuming the meat swiftly, he realized the danger of his situation. Just as he finished eating, a sneeze overcame him, leading to a moment of panic as he feared being discovered by the Kiowa.|"['1.

Fred Munson found himself in a tense situation as he discovered the lifeless body of his friend Thompson. The eerie feeling of being near death lingered as he cautiously approached a fallen warrior. With a mix of fear and determination, Fred decided to take the warrior's rifle, a move that could potentially anger the red-skins upon their return. Sensing the urgency of the situation, Fred quickly retreated into the darkness, grateful for the rifle that could now protect him from danger and help him secure food in the wild terrain.

He suddenly stopped, amazed at his forgetfulness. He had the rifle but no ammunition. Unsure if the gun was loaded, it was useless. He retraced his steps, reaching the rock where he had been before. Peering cautiously, he found no Kiowa in sight. Reflecting, he realized his mission was a failure. Deciding to leave, he chose the back-trail. Walking through the ravine, he planned to reach where Lone Wolf's men had left him. The moonlight made him uneasy, and he thought he saw an Indian. Checking his loaded gun, he cautiously moved forward, relieved when he passed the danger. But then, he heard a groan from the boulders above, sending shivers down his spine.|['1.

Whispering in the shadow, Fred wondered about the eerie sounds echoing through the ravine. Initially terrified, he mistook the wind for groans of a suffering person. As he walked, a massive rock narrowly missed him, shattering nearby. Startled but unharmed, Fred continued cautiously until he heard approaching horse hooves. Suspecting Lone Wolf's men, he hid and watched a group of riders pass by, numbering around thirty. Fred, relieved to remain unseen, waited until the coast was clear before resuming his journey through the ravine, wary of the dangers lurking in the darkness.|"[""1.

Fred was convinced he had heard Lone Wolf and his men nearby. Awake and alert, he decided to walk through the night for safety. While pondering his journey, a sudden sound of hoofs startled him. He cautiously scanned the area but found nothing. As he continued, a sudden rush of hoofs made him leap aside in fear. Despite his vigilance, he couldn't explain the strange noises. Fred wondered if there were ghosts in the area, a thought that unnerved him. He remained on high alert, ready to confront any danger.

The climb was tough at first, but he soon found a spot where the slope was gentler, making progress easier. Eventually, he reached a higher level, feeling safe from his pursuer. Looking for a place to rest, he considered a rocky spot but decided against it. Opting for a tree instead, he spotted a group that seemed ideal. After a quick survey, he settled on a large tree at the edge of the grove. With his gun to protect him, he climbed carefully, avoiding a close encounter with a massive wolf that tried to snap at him. The wolf lingered below, eyeing him, creating a tense standoff. Despite the temptation to use his last bullet, he refrained, wary of the gun's position on the ground.

As soon as the wolf moved, Fred quickly grabbed his gun and climbed about twenty feet up a tree to escape the dangerous animal. Soon, the howls of the wolf were echoed by many others, signaling that they were calling for reinforcements. Fred realized he was in a perilous situation, stuck up in a tree with a pack of mountain wolves waiting below. Despite the fear, he tried to rest but was constantly on edge as he heard the wolves prowling beneath him. The wolves, unable to climb the tree, continued to roam around, preparing for their feast. Fred, feeling exhausted but unable to sleep due to the menacing presence below, tried to find some comfort in his precarious perch. However, his hopes of rest were shattered when the wolves started leaping at the tree, jolting him awake and on high alert.|"['1.

In his fear, he quickly climbed back for his rifle, intending to shoot the nearest threat. But as his panic subsided, he decided to wait. After a few minutes, he realized there was no real danger, just the animals having fun. The noises below and the movements in the trees no longer bothered him. He drifted off to sleep. Healthy kids sleep well without dreams unless they eat poorly. Fred dreamt of recent events: watching for Apaches, the warning by Sut Simpson, the fight, Lone Wolf's capture, the night ride, and the wolf attack. In his dream, he fought a wolf, but it was the others that caused chaos, making him fall. One wolf bit his shoe, but the others' greediness saved him.

After the human escaped, the wolves howled fiercely. The lad, Fred, heard the howling stop suddenly. He realized a dangerous silence had fallen. A massive figure appeared below him, moving silently like a phantom. Fred identified it as a cougar, a climber with immense strength. Unable to reach his rifle, Fred remained motionless, hoping the cougar would pass by. The cougar, also known as a panther, seemed to suspect something was amiss and listened intently. Fred feared the cougar might detect him but stayed still. After a tense moment, the cougar left, and the wolves returned cautiously. As dawn broke, the wolves scattered, signaling the end of a terrifying night for Fred.|"['1.

After carefully surveying his surroundings, the young boy clutched his rifle tightly, half expecting a cougar to attack him. However, all remained quiet, and he cautiously headed eastward, feeling nervous until he was certain no wild animals were watching him. With the dawn, he knew he needed to work seriously. His plan was to return to the ravine, where he left to find a place to rest, and then hurry home. Feeling hungry, he decided to wait until nightfall to search for food, focusing on traveling during the day. He ventured into the Apache highway cautiously, aware of the risks of encountering the Native Americans. As he explored the area, he faced challenges like climbing rocks and sliding down gravel. Despite the obstacles, he persevered, determined to find his way back to the ravine. However, he soon realized he had lost his way, unsure of which direction to go next.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the young boy do after surveying his surroundings?\nA) He ran eastward\nB) He searched for food\nC) He clutched his rifle tightly\nD) He encountered a cougar\nE) He rested in the ravine', 'Question 2:\nWhy did the young boy decide to wait until nightfall to search for food?\nA) He was too tired to search during the day\nB) He was afraid of encountering wild animals\nC) He needed to rest in the ravine first\nD) He preferred traveling at night\nE) He was lost and confused', ""Question 3:\nWhat was the young boy's plan at dawn?\nA) To rest in the ravine\nB) To search for food immediately\nC) To head eastward\nD) To return home\nE) To explore the Apache highway"", 'Question 4:\nWhat challenges did the young boy face as he explored the area?\nA) Swimming across a river\nB) Climbing rocks and sliding down gravel\nC) Encountering friendly villagers\nD) Riding a horse\nE) Finding a hidden treasure', 'Question 5:\nWhy was the young boy nervous as he headed eastward?\nA) He saw a cougar\nB) He was lost\nC) He encountered Native Americans\nD) He was hungry\nE) He heard strange noises', 'Question 6:\nWhat made the young boy realize he had lost his way?\nA) Encountering a cougar\nB) Climbing rocks\nC) Heading eastward\nD) Finding a hidden treasure\nE) Being unsure of which direction to go next']"|['C) He clutched his rifle tightly', 'B) He was afraid of encountering wild animals', 'D) To return home', 'B) Climbing rocks and sliding down gravel', 'B) He was lost', 'E) Being unsure of which direction to go next']
Fred, determined to find the pass, changed directions and ventured left, hoping to discover it soon. Despite the challenging terrain and increasing thirst, he pressed on. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a ravine, initially mistaking it for the pass. However, upon closer inspection, he realized it was just a chasm. Spotting a fallen tree bridging the gap, Fred's hope surged. As he cautiously crossed the trunk, he noticed it was man-made, not natural. Seeing a large American cougar lurking on the log, Fred faced a perilous encounter. The cougar, growling menacingly, prepared to attack.

Fred decided not to set a specific path to follow since he believed he had as much chance of finding the ravine by wandering aimlessly as by sticking to his own theories. He continued this way until mid-afternoon, still hopeful despite feeling sick. The thought of the berries made him worry about poisoning. As he reclined on the ground hoping to feel better, his condition worsened, and he feared the worst. Fred's distress was heightened by unusual sounds and sensations.

Fred Munson had a peaceful sleep until after midnight. Just before he woke up, a man appeared in the moonlight, seeming lost in thought. The man was actually searching for something, scanning the area carefully. Frustrated with his search, he walked away. Meanwhile, Fred woke up with the sound of a nearby waterfall. Feeling better after a bout of sickness earlier, Fred realized he was near a cave entrance. As he fell into the cave, the soft ground cushioned his landing.

This was a simple precaution that likely saved his life. Holding the gun firmly, he cautiously tested the ground before venturing further into the dark cave. Despite some minor bumps, the ground was mostly even and suitable for walking if there was enough light. Wishing for a lantern to explore faster, he stayed close to the faint light above to avoid getting lost. The sound of a cascade guided him, hinting at a possible way out.

As he spoke, Mickey unwrapped a package of deer meat from a newspaper. He shared how he prepared for emergencies like his mother did with whiskey and lunch. Mickey recounted hunting a deer and making a meal of it. Fred Munson, hungry and nauseous, found the venison delicious. Mickey then asked Fred to recount his adventures since being taken by Lone Wolf. Mickey explained how he returned to New Bosting after the Apache attack and joined the search for Fred. They raced to catch up to Lone Wolf's camp in the mountains, but the trail split, complicating their pursuit.

Mickey shared his adventure of tracking Lone Wolf with Soot, explaining how they split up to follow different groups. Mickey thought he was on Lone Wolf's trail, but got confused in the mountains. He described how his mustang climbed well but needed help in some spots. Mickey found the footprints of the person he was tracking, assuming it was the reader's, and followed them until dark.

After finishing their meal, a man and a boy collected wood to keep the fire burning in the cave. They found a lot of wood, likely left by previous cave dwellers. Once they had enough, they sat by the fire to talk. The fire wasn't needed for warmth, but it helped with the dampness. They chatted about their experiences. The man, Mickey, found a pine stick full of pitch that would burn like a torch. He planned to explore the cave with it. Excited, the boy took the torch, and they set off. Mickey led, heading towards a cascade. They found nothing unusual at the falls, so they tasted the water and moved upstream. Mickey was cautious, suspecting others in the cave. They reached where the stream entered the cave, examining it closely. They learned about the cave's structure and decided to explore further.|"['1.

Fred and Mickey explored a dark cave with a stream running through it. They hoped the water might lead them to an exit. As they followed the stream, they discovered a pool teeming with fish but had no way to catch them. Mickey, the Irishman, believed the stream's outlet could be their way out. They continued deeper into the cave, the torch casting eerie shadows. The water remained shallow and clear, reflecting the torchlight. After a while, they noticed a faint light at the end of the stream, indicating an exit. Mickey's keen observation skills revealed that the light was sunlight from outside. Excited by this discovery, they realized their escape was within reach, and they eagerly prepared to find their way back to the outside world.|"['1.

Mickey felt thrilled by his discovery but soon realized the danger of using the stream to escape. The water rushed out forcefully, leaving no room for air. Without air, survival was impossible, even for a strong swimmer. Mickey feared being swept away lifeless if he attempted to reach the outer world through the stream. Were there other ways out? Could they climb the walls or find an opening in the roof? As they explored, they stumbled upon a skeleton, dressed in fine clothes, not typical of the area. The mystery deepened as they found a silver-mounted revolver beneath the body, indicating a possible story of someone who met an untimely end in the cave. Mickey pondered the strange discovery in silence, wondering about the person's identity and how they ended up there.|"['1.

The discovery of a bullet hole in the man's forehead raised suspicions about his tragic end. Mickey, after finding a handsome pistol, searched for clues in the man's belongings.

Mickey had a peculiar dream where his two loves were fighting like cats until they vanished, prompting him to give up on them. He decided to follow his plan to sleep on it and come up with ideas.

The figure, wrapped in a blanket, began to spin awkwardly, losing its dignity. Mickey, puzzled, refrained from shooting. Fred speculated that it was a test to see if they were alert.
