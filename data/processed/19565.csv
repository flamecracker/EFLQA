Bunny and Sue were enjoying a leisurely ride in their pony cart down the quiet street. With only a few people around, they could easily keep an eye on their pony, Toby. Suddenly, their dog, Splash, dashed towards them and hopped into the cart through the open back door. Startled, Toby stopped as he felt a tug on the reins from Splash. A concerned clerk from a nearby store advised them to tie up Toby when left unattended. Despite some mishaps with Splash, Bunny and Sue loved their pony rides, sometimes accompanied by Uncle Tad.

Splash, the children's dog, didn't want to return home. He sat on the grass, wagging his tail and pretending to be interested in the trees' height. Ignoring Bunny and Sue, Splash made it clear he didn't want to listen. The children decided to walk with Splash a little way back to convince him to return. Bunny, though trying to sound stern, found it hard because he loved Splash. Bunny picked up a stick, a signal Splash understood as a game of fetch. Bunker Blue, passing by, inquired about the situation. Bunny asked for butter, distracting Toby by tying him up. Inside, the children enjoyed sweet milk from Mrs. Potter.|"[""1.

Bunny and his sister Sue went on an adventure with their pony Toby. Despite Bunny's mother's advice to stick to the straight road, Bunny led Toby down a lane and into the woods. They found a picturesque spot by a bubbling spring to have lunch. After securing Toby and giving him treats, the children enjoyed the peaceful surroundings. Bunny realized they had strayed off course and decided to turn back. However, Toby seemed determined to continue towards a brook. Bunny noticed Toby's thirst and allowed him to drink freely without a check-rein, which restricts a horse's movements. Toby happily quenched his thirst, demonstrating the importance of treating animals kindly. Bunny and Sue learned a valuable lesson about caring for their pony on their woodland outing.|"[""1.

"Once, Bunny and Sue visited Grandpa's farm. They rode in a wagon while the horses drank from a brook at a place called a ""ford."" The water cleaned the wheels and cooled the pony's legs. As they crossed, the stream was shallow, not reaching the wheels' hubs. The road ahead grew darker as trees arched overhead. The soft sand made it hard for Toby to pull the cart fast. Soon, they saw a cottage across a green valley. Mrs. Brown reminded them to stick to familiar paths.

About a year ago, a milkman asked Mr. Brown to use his barn to keep his horse and wagon. The milkman left a bell behind that he used to ring when delivering milk. Bunny and Sue tied the bell to a string hanging from a tree near their tent-house. Toby, their pony, accidentally rang the bell by tugging on the string. A gypsy man with gold rings in his ears approached them, inquiring about buying a horse. Bunny explained that Toby was their pony and not for sale. The gypsy admired Toby's tricks and offered to buy him if they ever decided to sell. Bunny and Sue were fond of Toby and declined the offer.|"[""1.

The red-and-yellow wagon, matching Mr. Tallman's lost box, disappeared around the street corner. Bunny, Sue, and Sadie returned to their play-tent with Toby. Bunny shared their plan to raise money for the Red Cross in Bellemere to support soldiers. They decided to offer pony rides for five cents each.

Bunny invited his friends to hop into the pony cart. With four kids aboard, the cart was cozy, but Bunny urged Toby, the pony, to trot to the store for a yeast cake. Despite pleas for rides from other children, they continued on. Georgie hopped out to fetch the yeast cake while Bunny, Sue, and Charlie Star enjoyed the ride. Arriving at Georgie's house, Mrs. Watson saw the cart and realized the children were fundraising for the Red Cross. She suggested taking Mary, Georgie's little sister, for a ride to raise more money. Bunny gave everyone a long ride through the village, and soon, more kids wanted rides for five cents each to support the Red Cross.

Bunny drove his Shetland pony around the woodland path, giving rides to boys and girls who paid five cents each. Laughter and shouts attracted more riders. Toby, the pony, didn't mind the bumpy path as long as it wasn't uphill. Bunny took breaks for Toby to rest and drink from the lake. Some children fed Toby sweet treats. When Bunny thought about heading home, a teacher assured Bunny's mother that they were safe. During lunch, kids found a mysterious man with gold rings and a red handkerchief asleep by a spring. The teacher joked that he might be a pirate, and Bunny was asked if he knew the man.|"['1.

"""I agree with Bunny,"" another man stated confidently. ""Pirates are typically found on ships. Even if there are land-pirates, they are not common and shouldn't be considered.

The man woke up, smiled at Bunny and Sue, and introduced himself as Jaki Kezar, a gypsy from a nearby camp. He explained that he had dozed off by the spring while looking for horses to buy. Jaki bid farewell, assuring he meant no harm and inviting them to his camp for fortune-telling. Bunny resumed giving pony rides to the children, raising nearly three dollars for the Red Cross."|"['1.

Mr. Brown carefully inspected the stable and its door, puzzled by how Toby, the pony, had vanished. There were no signs of forced entry, suggesting that someone had used a key to unlock the door. Mr. Brown ruled out the small window as an exit due to its size and the wire screen covering it. The family dog, Splash, had not barked, indicating that whoever took Toby did so silently.

The gypsy told Bunny and his companions that neither Toby the pony nor Splash the dog were at the camp.
