The warm September sun shone over Chagmouth, a charming town by the sea. Mavis and Merle, back from their holidays, strolled along the cobbled path, enjoying the familiar sights. They were staying with their uncle and aunt in Durracombe for another term, excited to be back in Chagmouth. Accompanying their uncle to his branch surgery, they planned to spend the day at the beach. They chatted about their friends, Tudor and Gwen, as they climbed the cliff. Gwen had started at a fashionable boarding school near London, leaving Babbie alone with a governess. Babbie would now join them at 'The Moorings' for French and dancing. The girls were looking forward to their seaside adventure, hoping to swim and enjoy the last days of their summer break.|"['1.

As the two girls hiked along the narrow cliff track, they gazed at the stunning view of the colorful crags and the shimmering sea below. Sea-birds soared and squawked, while the tide gently washed over the rocks, revealing hidden sea creatures. The girls paused to pick ripe blackberries from the brambles, staining their fingers purple. Urged by Mavis, they hastened towards a sandy creek, once a smugglers' haven, now a quiet bathing spot. However, to their dismay, the secluded cove was bustling with people, a stark contrast to their previous solitary visits. Disappointed, Mavis grumbled about the unexpected crowd, feeling as if their secret spot had been invaded by the entire world.|"['1.

The small cove, now bustling with visitors, was a far cry from the peaceful haven Mavis and Merle had expected. Children played in the water, picnics dotted the rocks, and a group of noisy youngsters frolicked by the waves. Disappointed, the sisters joined the crowd, finding a spot to change behind a rock. As they swam, they noticed two girls in navy bathing suits racing towards a distant rock. Merle's shout saved them from a dangerous current. After a playful swim, Mavis and Merle dressed leisurely, only to find their peaceful picnic spot invaded by three new arrivals. Despite the intrusion, they settled in to enjoy their tea and cakes, making the best of the lively scene below.|"['1.

Merle, who disliked intrusions on her space, frowned as Mavis accidentally knocked their thermos flask over the cliff. With their tea lost and the flask broken, they reluctantly joined the other girls for a meal. The Ramsays later marveled at the beauty of the three girls they met. The fair-haired sisters, Beata and Romola Castleton, had striking features, while their friend Fay Macleod, with brown hair, was vibrant and different. They shared stories about themselves and discovered that the girls were day students from Chagmouth. They learned that the girls would be carpooling to school and joked about fitting into the car, which they nicknamed 'the sardine-tin'. Excited to form a group at school, they looked forward to the adventures ahead.|"[""1.

Merle expressed excitement about the changes at school and the upcoming term. She shared her love for 'The Moorings' and the teachers, Miss Pollard and Miss Fanny. Merle and Mavis discussed their new friends, Beata, Romola, and Fay, on their way back. Merle was eager for the new term and felt that Fay would bring some excitement to their lives. Mavis preferred traveling in Uncle David's car over being packed in the school bus. As they realized the time, Mavis hurried Merle along, teasing her about staying too long at the cove. They joked about spending the night on the cliffs with the sea-gulls before rushing back home.|"['1.

Mavis and Merle were excited on Tuesday morning as they headed to school, expecting to see many changes. Previously, 'The Moorings' was a small school with about twenty-four students taught by Miss Pollard and her sister, Miss Fanny. The sisters, daughters of the late Vicar, were caring but not highly educated. Due to the mild climate of Durracombe, the school attracted more students, prompting the sisters to revamp their methods. They hired a capable mistress with university and high school experience to lead the changes. The school expanded to accommodate more boarders and focused on improving academics and introducing new activities. The parents and students were pleased with the changes. Miss Mitchell, the new teacher, confidently welcomed the students, encouraging them to work together for a successful term.|"[""1.

Miss Mitchell, the school's head, decided to omit the Sixth form due to the girls' young age. The top form was the Fifth, with eleven girls preparing diligently to advance to the Sixth the following year. Mavis and Merle, part of this group, moved to their new classroom with five familiar faces and four new ones. The Fifth form was under Miss Mitchell's guidance, while Miss Barnes managed the Fourth. The lower forms were taught by Miss Hopkins, Mademoiselle, and Miss Fanny Pollard. The day began with slightly disorganized lessons, but progress was made. Miss Pollard announced the selection of four monitresses, two appointed by staff and two elected by students. Merle was thrilled, envisioning the monitresses as leaders of games and school activities. Mavis pondered the selection process, while Merle emphasized the need for capable leaders to manage the school effectively.|"[""1.

"""I wish Miss Pollard and Miss Mitchell would have done all the choosing,"" said Mavis anxiously. ""I think myself it's a mistake to put it to the vote. Probably somebody quite unsuitable will be elected. The juniors will plump for the girl they like best, without caring whether she knows anything about games or not. There's Aubrey Simpson!""

""Rather a family affair, isn't it? I think I'll ask first and see if anybody else is going to give in our names. Perhaps Iva or Nesta may. It would be much nicer than seeming to poke ourselves forward.""

""If we don't hustle a little we'll never get there! That's my opinion! You're too good for this wicked world, Mavis! I've often told you so!"" declared Merle, running into the house and putting down her books with a slam. ""Angel girls are all very well at home, but school is a scrimmage and it's those who fight who come up on top! Don't laugh! Oh, I enjoy fighting! I tell you I want most desperately and tremendously to be made a monitress, and if I'm not chosen, well--it will be the disappointment of my life! I'm not joking! I mean it really and truly. I've set my heart upon it.""

"""Mavis, do you have a shilling? I forgot my purse at home! Could you lend it to me? I want to buy some sweets. Thanks a lot!"" ""She's trying the popular trick too! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I think Edith Carey has a good chance. Have you made your nominations, Mavis? Let's go drop them in the box."" The bell rang, and girls gathered in the big schoolroom. Muriel led a group of juniors, each sucking on a peppermint bull's-eye. Merle sat with new friends, passing around chocolates.

During the school election, students were asked to write the names of their chosen candidates on a piece of paper, fold it, and hand it in without revealing their choice. The process was done in secret to ensure fairness. Miss Mitchell and Miss Fanny left the study, and the meeting ended. The students eagerly awaited the results, with some day-girls lingering in the hall. The group from Chagmouth had to leave before the announcement, with well-wishes exchanged. Beata, tightly squeezed in the car, wished Merle luck. Iva and Nesta congratulated Mavis on her win, revealing they had voted for her. Nesta kept her vote secret, emphasizing the importance of confidentiality in a ballot.|['1.

"The Ramsays strolled down the High Street towards Bridge House. Muriel Burnitt, with Florrie and Viola Leach and the three little Andrews, led the way, proud of her triumph. The Careys had taken a shortcut to the Vicarage. Mavis avoided looking at Merle, who fought back tears. Merle held back her emotions until they reached home. Rushing through the surgery entrance, she sought solace in the summer-house. Mavis followed, offering comfort. ""I'm not envious of you!"" Merle cried. ""I wanted us both to succeed!

The news of Mavis stepping down and Merle taking over as the monitress brought mixed reactions at school. Some girls felt sad, while others believed it was a wise move. Iva confided in Nesta, expressing relief that Merle was better suited for the job, unlike Mavis who found it challenging to discipline the students.

"At Whinburn High, public meetings were common, and Merle, a new student, quickly realized that Muriel Burnitt would be a challenge due to her sharp tongue. Despite this, Merle, with the help of classmates like Mavis, took charge of a meeting where the girls were excited and chatty.

The challenging cliff led them around a bend to a stunning stretch of coast. Below, a bell rang from a buoy on the water, its sound drifting like a mermaid's lament. The pirate, Sir Ralph the Rover, in a fit of spite, severed the bell and sailed away. Years later, his ship returned to Scotland in a thick fog and met its demise on the Inchcape rock he had stolen from. Romola's thoughts drifted to the Middle Ages as Beata recounted tales of mermaids and lost lands. The girls descended to the rocky platform, preparing to fish. They gathered limpets for bait and cast their lines, but luck eluded them. Moving along to find lob-worms, they navigated steep crags to reach a cove teeming with sand-gobies. Despite their efforts, the fishing expedition ended in disappointment.|"['1.

The blow-hole, a natural wonder, made the girls forget the rising tide. As they watched the spray dance in the sunlight, the sea sneaked up behind them. Mavis noticed their peril just in time. Stranded above the high-water mark, they faced a dilemma. Staying till the tide ebbed meant darkness and a risky climb up the cliffs. The sunset, though beautiful, failed to lift their spirits. Cold and disheartened, they huddled together. The sinking sun turned the sea into gold, while the rising moon cast a silver path on the water. Romola, shivering, shed a tear. The eerie stillness was broken by Fay, who longed for warmth and comfort over shipwreck tales. The night crept on, enveloping them in silence and shadows.|"[""1.

"To everyone's surprise, a loud response echoed from across the water. Instantly, they all stood up and shouted back with all their might. Soon, the sound of oars splashing in the water was heard, and a boat with a lantern tied to its front approached the cove. It cautiously navigated towards the rocks, and a tall boyish figure leaped out, holding it steady. A person in a fisherman's jersey extended a helping hand to assist the girls into the boat. It was only when they were safely seated, and the moonlight illuminated their faces, that Mavis recognized their rescuers.""I have the weekend off. Some of us were sent away due to the flu at school, and I thought I'd find you at the farm,"" explained the tall figure. ""We were quite worried when it got dark, and you didn't show up.

A dispute arose within a school society dominated by boarders who wanted to keep all privileges to themselves. They chose a play, assigned roles among boarders, and rehearsed in the evenings. The day-girls on the committee, Mavis, Merle, and Muriel, were upset. Nesta dismissed their concerns, suggesting they act as the audience. The day-girls were not allowed to rehearse in the evenings or stay late, as it would disrupt the boarders' schedule. Merle, infatuated with the teacher, felt slighted by the preference shown to boarders. Miss Mitchell, aware of Merle's feelings, remained impartial. Merle's attempts to win favor, like leaving flowers on the teacher's desk, backfired when other students joined in, making it a playful gesture.

The chairman had to ring a bell constantly and remind everyone to be quiet. The noise from the back became so loud that his voice was barely audible, and those in the front seats had to turn around and shout, 'Order!' 'You'll be asked to leave!' before the troublemakers quieted down. The skit created by Mavis and Merle was titled: In the first scene, Mrs. Hardup, a widow, bemoaned her lack of money and her son Augustus's engagement to Isabella, a charming but penniless girl. Their spirits lifted when they received a letter from Uncle Cashbags, their wealthy relative, saying he was coming for lunch that day. Mavis, playing the widow, looked much older with grey hair and glasses, while Merle, disguised as Augustus, was unrecognizable.

Bevis, feeling overlooked and resentful, struggled to fully appreciate the hospitality. However, Mavis reminded him to accept kindness graciously. The next day, The Warren was transformed for a festive dance. Mavis and Merle, feeling a bit overshadowed, were comforted by Babbie, who kindly handed them their dance programs. As the evening unfolded, many unfamiliar faces appeared, and Mavis found herself alone until Bevis sought her out, eager to dance with her.

Three dances from Mavis's program followed one after the other, and Bevis and Mavis enjoyed them as the steps flowed well together. After the third dance, as they headed to the hall for lemonade, Mrs. Glyn Williams playfully intervened. She insisted on introducing Bevis to new partners, teasing Mavis about not keeping him all to herself. Mavis blushed and stepped aside as Mrs. Glyn Williams took Bevis away to arrange his dance partners. Mavis felt overwhelmed and wished she could leave the party to confide in her mother. Bevis, annoyed by Mrs. Glyn Williams, chose a young girl for his next dance. While Mavis stayed by the piano for the rest of the evening, feeling a shift in her friendship with Bevis.

Clive, a lively and mischievous boy, enjoyed teasing his cousins, especially Merle, who always managed to outwit him. Despite their playful rivalry, they were close friends. When Merle fell ill with mumps, Clive and his sister Mavis had to be quarantined to prevent the spread of the infection. Mavis, temporarily taking on the role of a governess, had to tutor Clive, who found the lessons a bore but stayed out of trouble. Merle, isolated in her room, felt lonely and wished for more company.

The family tried to amuse her, with Mavis sketching her as ""Saint Merle suffering her Martyrdom"" and her mother typing a document praising her acting skills.

On February 14th, Merle was still captive. She had almost forgotten about St. Valentine, so it was a delightful surprise to receive mysterious gifts on her breakfast tray. Among them were flowers, chocolates, a new solitaire game, and a cute mascot dog with a wobbly head. It felt like a mini birthday celebration. At the top of the gifts was an envelope with a secret message. Inside was a pink paper with a heart pierced by an arrow, and Cupid aiming in the distance. The note asked Merle to be their Valentine. Merle joked about Cupid's heart not looking quite right anatomically. Despite her absence due to mumps, Merle returned to school with Mavis, eager to catch up on missed lessons and motivate her hockey team to play better.|"['1.

Miss Fanny, feeling unwell, asked Merle to hold the ladder for her during a botanical ramble with the Fifth form. Sybil sought sympathy, complaining about her uncomfortable shoes. Merle, tired of being taken advantage of, refused to hold Sybil's case while she tied her hair ribbon.

There was fierce competition among the girls to see who could find the most flower specimens. They searched in hedgerows, climbed banks, and explored fields. Although Durracombe wasn't as rich in flowers as Chagmouth, they discovered a decent variety, noting early blooms like the greater stitchwort, ground ivy, and golden saxifrage. The day was crisp in March, with a brisk wind carrying white clouds through the sky. Rooks were starting to build nests, green leaves appeared on elder trees, and elms were flowering. Miss Mitchell shared folklore about flowers belonging to fairies, like foxgloves being 'the good folks' gloves' and elder trees housing an 'elder mother.' The girls also learned about St. John's wort being the 'fairies' horse' and moonwort's supernatural abilities. Later, they strolled through the quaint village of Bamberton, admiring its charming cottages and visiting the church, much to Miss Mitchell's delight.|"['1.

"""I'll come with you!"" she said eagerly. ""I'm not at all fond of going round churches, and looking at monuments. It always makes me wonder if I'm going to die young! When Miss Mitchell took us to Templeton Church and read us the epitaphs, I cried afterwards! There was one about a girl exactly my age. 'Sweet flower, nipped off in early bloom,' it said, or something of the sort.""

""But come with us if you like. Yes, you too, Beata! But for goodness' sake don't tell any one else or they'll all want to come, and if the whole lot try to scoot, it will put a stopper on the thing. We'll wait till the others are inside and then just slide off. Mum's the word, though!""

It was quite easy to loiter among the tombstones pretending to read the inscriptions, but the moment Miss Mitchell and her audience had safely passed through the porch and opened the big nail-studded door, the four confederates turned and fled.

Edith knew a short cut, and took them between rows of graves, regardless of Sybil's protesting shudders, to a tiny stile that led down an alley to the riverside.

Clive, feeling remorseful, quickly apologized before leaving, and Miss Mitchell gracefully accepted it. She didn't want to forgive him too easily, perhaps to teach him a lesson. Luckily, Clive's negative predictions about the exams didn't come true. His cousins passed without failing, although not with outstanding grades.

Mavis and Merle disagreed with Mrs. Treasure's opinion on Chagmouth but loved Burswood. The farm had a sea view, an old-fashioned garden, beehives, and colorful flowers. They named it 'Elfland.' The Tremaynes, who were kind and enthusiastic, joined the girls on picnics. The Castletons, charming and musical, made the holiday special. Morland, talented but not a genius, enjoyed painting.

Morland, a young man with artistic talents, found himself studying engineering despite his passion for the arts. He excelled in his studies but felt life lacked romance. During holidays, he indulged in his artistic side, playing beautiful melodies on a friend's piano. Mrs. Macleod suggested that pursuing art for pleasure, like Morland's piano playing, could bring more fulfillment than commercial success. Meanwhile, Bevis explored photography and acquired a small yacht, finding joy in his hobbies. Despite Mrs. Tremayne's restrictions, he dreamed of sailing with his friends. Mavis and Merle, eager to join Bevis on his yacht, were disappointed by the prohibition but hoped to have a boat adventure in the future with their friends.|"['1.

"""It's alright,"" he replied calmly, but his determined expression signaled to the girls that he was set on having his way, even if he didn't voice it further. It was probably for the best that he didn't take Clive out boating, as the boy was daring and mischievous, especially when his father wasn't around. Clive's antics near the cliffs often left the girls on edge, and he sometimes caused trouble with the sailors by messing with their nets or tar-pots at the quay. Mavis and Merle were relieved when Mr. Tremayne took Clive out, giving them a break from his antics. The girls enjoyed botany and were busy collecting wildflowers for a holiday project.

He had led them to a spot filled with shells of various kinds. Mrs. Tremayne was thrilled, kneeling to collect the delicate pink ones, cowries, and more. Time flew by as they enjoyed the search. Setting up a tea spot behind rocks, he invited them to sort shells and wash them in the tea cups. Suddenly, they realized the sea had surrounded them, turning their spot into an island. Calmly, he assured them he could row them back to safety. The sail back to Chagmouth was delightful, with a pleasant breeze. The girls found it all quite enjoyable, especially the unexpected adventure. At Chagmouth, they often gathered at The Haven, a central meeting place where they engaged in games, theatricals, and dancing.

Merle received a poetic note from William, Mrs. Treasure's son, who admired her and often gave her gifts like ferns and flowers.

Despite Mr. Tremayne's logical explanations that these were likely tricks by smugglers, the children were intrigued and decided to investigate Tinkers' Lane at night. Armed with various items for protection, they ventured into the dark lane, feeling a mix of bravery and fear.

Clive and Mavis, along with their friend Merle, decided to brave the dark lane, filled with eerie sounds and mysterious rustlings. As they walked, the tension mounted, and they found themselves enveloped in an atmosphere charged with the supernatural. Suddenly, a black dog-like figure appeared, sending Mavis and Merle into a frenzy of fear. However, to their relief, it turned out to be Bevis and his friendly spaniel, Fan. The girls, now calmed and relieved, laughed at their own fright. Bevis assured them of their safety and joked about encountering the headless horseman. Despite the anticlimactic encounter, they were grateful for Bevis's escort back home. Later, they shared their adventure with William, who listened with admiration.

The mysterious noises in the wood caused quite a stir among the locals. People gathered in curiosity, believing the tree to be haunted.

The moon rose, bathing the moor in light. Little people, like busy bees, flitted about. They wove silk from gossamer, spun fur from moths, and crafted embroidered gowns from harebells and rose petals. Tears turned to pearls, flowers to ornaments, and pebbles to silver. They built a castle of dewdrops. Ginnifer's lover arrived, determined to marry her, finding her at a pixie palace. Together, they vanished into Elfland. Children still call dewdrops 'Ginnifer's tears.' Merle, a school officer, faced challenges at 'The Moorings.' Monitresses Iva and Nesta struggled to maintain order.

The plan to have junior students take on leadership roles at school was met with enthusiasm. Being seen as the future strength of the school was far more appealing to them than being considered a nuisance by the older students.

"""We need to plan another parade when we have more time,"" she suggested. ""Maybe next time I'll dress up too. The American eagle was huge! Fay deserves first prize! Who agrees?"" ""Let's share the candy,"" Fay said, receiving it from Maude and giving it to everyone. ""Thank you, Miss Mitchell, for coming to see us. I couldn't ignore the Fourth of July! It wouldn't be loyal to America, right?"" ""You've defended the Stars and Stripes well!"" Miss Mitchell chuckled. ""Now, quickly take off your costumes. The bell will ring in five minutes."" The next big event for the Ramsays was Mavis's seventeenth birthday. She had grown stronger since moving to Devonshire. Her father gave her a new bike, her mother a sketching easel, and Merle a camp-stool. Uncle David and Aunt Nellie gifted her books and music. Bevis sent a stuffed kittiwake, which Mavis hung in her room. At 'The Moorings,' a new wooden hut was erected for a gymnasium and meetings.

Merle woke up with a headache on Saturday morning and decided to rest in the garden. Mavis also hesitated about going to Chagmouth, but Dr. Tremayne insisted she join. Mrs. Ramsay encouraged Mavis to go, attributing her reluctance to tiredness from exams. They eventually set off with Uncle David, who had visits to make along the way. At Grimbal's Farm, they learned about a sea fog that worried Mrs. Penruddock, as Bevis was sailing his yacht from Port Sennen to Chagmouth. The missing clapper in the bell at St. Morval's Head added to the danger. Mavis, after a quick look at the mist-covered sea, rushed back to the farm, concerned about Bevis's safety.|"['1.
