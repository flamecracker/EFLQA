Betty and her friends were out on the river in their boat, enjoying the warm day. Suddenly, they spotted something long and dark in the water. It had scales and ridges and an ugly head with bulging eyes that stared at them like a fish. Betty, unsure of the river's safety, decided to turn the boat around after going a short distance. As they headed back, they passed colored boys fishing in small boats, who paused to watch them in awe and fear. Grace, still shaken by the encounter with the mysterious creature, had a restless night, worrying about her missing brother and the alligator incident. Meanwhile, Betty focused on navigating the boat carefully, avoiding sandbars and ensuring the motor was in working order.|"['1.

Betty directed Mollie to take one oar while she grabbed the other, realizing their strength. Grace and Amy were to use the hook. They pushed together to get the boat off the bar. If that failed, they would try reversing the engine. The river swirled around the stranded craft with bits of driftwood floating by. They pushed, but the boat didn't budge. They took a break in the cockpit with some iced orangeade. Grace found the cockpit comfortable despite being stranded. The engine hesitated but eventually started. Betty reversed the propeller, but it didn't help. Grace suggested calling for help, realizing they were close enough to shore. They decided to give a loud call for assistance.|"['1.

The man kindly reminded the girls to pass a message to Mr. Stonington from Penbrook, ten miles up the river. After ensuring their safety, he advised them to be cautious due to a protruding bar in the water. As the girls headed back to the orange grove, they abandoned their picnic plans due to the lateness of the hour and their fatigue. Despite encountering rough characters, they learned that Belton provided reliable laborers. The days that followed were uneventful, filled with leisurely activities like boating and fishing. They explored the orange grove, indulging in the sweet fruit and taking walks with Mrs. Stonington. Meanwhile, Mr. Stonington managed the business affairs diligently. The foreman noted Mr. Stonington's absence, leading the girls to venture into the wild and eerie Everglades, where they encountered various creatures and felt a sense of unease.|"['1.

""No, they weren't discussing the Everglades,"" Mrs. Belton clarified. ""This young lady believes her brother might have been taken to one of the turpentine camps or other camps inland and wants to rescue him. I advised her to stay away.""

""That's wise advice,"" Mr. Belton concurred, more solemnly than before. ""Dealing with those contract laborers can be dangerous. My men are nothing compared to them, although I do encounter tough characters occasionally.""

""But what can we do?"" Grace implored. ""If Will is there, we must find a way to bring him back! While I'm not certain, my father is searching everywhere for him, and the best lead we have is that he might be somewhere in the interior.""

"""Oh, I don't mean it that way,"" said Betty quickly. ""I only suggested that perhaps those mean men--I'm sure they were mean--might have called him that to suit their own purposes. But I think we are well rid of them, anyhow. Here comes Mr. Hammond, and that must be Tom with him,"" and she indicated two figures approaching.

""Then we'd like to be your friends,"" said Betty with a smile, and a calm look at Mollie, who was making signs behind Tom's back. Obvious signs they were, too. Betty looked triumphant, as though saying: ""There, didn't I tell you?""

Tom Osborne proved that he knew something about motor boats, and was also versed in the ways of making girls comfortable. He asked if they wanted him to steer, and as Betty had not taken her craft down the river very often she agreed. The girls sat on the after deck, under a wide-spread awning, and chatted of the sights they saw.

The two large alligators, which the girls later described as exceptionally big, appeared to have claimed the narrow strip of land connecting the peninsula to the main shore as their own. This left the girls feeling trapped on what could become an island if the river rose. The alligators showed no sign of moving closer, instead, they lounged comfortably on the hot sand under the blazing sun. The girls called out for help, but their cries went unanswered. Faced with the alligators blocking their way, Betty decided to take action by throwing a stone at one of them. Afterward, Amy pointed out a sandbar that curved from their side to the other shore, offering a shallow path to safety.
