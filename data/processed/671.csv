Phil, a young Italian fiddler, followed his guide into a basement, up two flights of stairs, and into a beautiful chamber. The room housed a sick boy and his mother. The sick boy, Henry, lay in bed while Phil sang a song with great emotion. Henry's illness had been ongoing, and it seemed nature might not let him recover. Phil, like many young Italian musicians, hailed from Calabria and worked for a padrone who controlled their earnings. Despite the hardships, Phil remained hopeful and left Mrs. Leigh's house with fifty cents in hand, aiming to avoid punishment by meeting his daily earnings.

Phil, a young violinist, faced a series of unfortunate events while playing on the streets. Unknowingly, he chose a bad time and place, angering a tobacconist who suspected his assistant of theft. Fearing the man's wrath, Phil quickly moved on and played in front of some houses where children gave him a penny. Despite their eagerness for more music, Phil had to leave due to lack of additional pay. As he played around, he managed to collect twenty-five cents. Later, he encountered a bully trying to steal an apple he received as a donation. Fortunately, another boy, Edward, intervened, showing courage that made the bully back off. Phil, grateful for the help, continued his journey, grateful for the small acts of kindness he encountered despite the challenges he faced.|"['1.

Phil promptly followed his new friend's advice. He had not eaten since seven o'clock, only having a piece of dry bread and cheese earlier. The apple, a rare treat, he savored. His potential robber scowled as he had hoped to take the apple. Edward stood by until the apple was eaten, then intervened. The troublemaker seemed to follow Phil, but Edward warned him off. Phil then bought a simple dinner of two penny rolls and cheese. He met another Italian boy, Giacomo, who was also under the same master. Phil and Giacomo were from the same town in Calabria and were sold into slavery for less than a hundred dollars each. They worked long hours, barely benefiting. The stern master kept a close eye on them, ready to punish those who didn't meet his demands.|"['1.

"Phil and Giacomo went their separate ways in the city. Giacomo headed uptown, while Phil continued toward the Astor House. The padrone, or boss, went to a nearby liquor store and spent some of the money he had taken from his young workers. As the afternoon neared its end, Phil arrived at the Astor House. Despite playing his violin, he only earned ten cents and was unsure if he would reach his goal. Feeling tired, he sat on a bench in City Hall Park. Two other boys were already there shining shoes. Phil followed their lead and shined shoes too. He only collected seven cents from the audience but was satisfied given the circumstances. Later, Paul, known as ""Paul the Peddler,"" intervened to help Phil avoid trouble with Tim Rafferty. Paul then invited Phil for supper at his home, where they enjoyed a hearty meal prepared by Mrs. Hoffman."|"[""1.

Phil sat as instructed, feeling a bit awkward but also excited. Accustomed to simple meals, the food before him felt like a grand feast, especially the meat, a rarity for him. The boys sold into slavery were often not returned at the agreed time, some succumbing to the harsh conditions. Despite his young age, Jimmy showed talent in drawing, aspiring to be an artist with Paul's support. Phil, grateful for the meal and protection, felt a sense of home for the first time since his arrival in America. He decided to make the most of his time, heading to Fulton Ferry to play music for passengers on the Brooklyn steamboat. The boat was crowded with people commuting between Brooklyn and New York City.|"['1. What did Phil feel as he sat down for the meal?\nA) Nervous\nB) Excited\nC) Sad\nD) Angry\nE) Confused', '2.

Phil, a young musician, entered the ladies' cabin on a boat. Though mainly for ladies, it was also occupied by men who disliked the smoke in their own cabin. Phil knew children's hearts and purses were more open than men's, so he played music. Finding all seats taken, he waited and then played in the rear cabin, captivating the passengers. After playing, he collected small donations until a young lady gave him twenty-five cents. She kindly held out her hand, and Phil respectfully kissed it. Later, Phil played again but was interrupted by a man in a bad mood, halting his earnings. Despite this setback, he earned two dollars and fifty cents. Phil couldn't leave the boat and had to endure a rough barroom atmosphere later.|"[""1.

Phil had a generous idea. Unsure of his exact money amount, he knew it was more than two dollars. He thought about helping his friend who was short on cash to prevent him from getting in trouble. Quickly, Phil gave some money to his friend. They decided to head back to their dingy home, exhausted and eager for rest. Upon arrival, around fifteen to twenty boys were already there, contributing money to the padrone. The place was shabby, fitting the padrone's greedy demeanor. Phil and Giacomo arrived at a quarter-past eleven. The padrone expected Phil to have hidden money but found none. Giacomo surprised the padrone with more money than anticipated. The padrone's cruel nature delighted in punishing boys caught hiding money. Pietro, the padrone's nephew, assisted in oppressing the boys. Phil, feeling sympathy, shared his food with a hungry boy but was suspected of buying it with his earnings. The boys watched helplessly as the padrone's injustices unfolded, some feeling indignation while others were relieved to have avoided punishment, at least for the time being.|"[""1.

Ludovico knew the risk of showing his true feelings on his face, as it could lead to more punishment without helping others. After Ludovico's punishment, he was sent to bed without supper, a fate shared by five other boys. The stick was used on nearly forty boys that evening. These boys faced fatigue and mistreatment daily due to one man's greed, depriving them of education and playtime. This exploitation, akin to slavery, is allowed by the laws of Italy and America. Despite poor sleeping conditions, the boys returned by midnight. Phil and Giacomo, young street musicians, braved the cold December weather to earn money. Phil shared his earnings with Giacomo, despite the padrone's objections. The boys struggled to make money that day, feeling the harsh cold but persevering to meet their earnings.|"['1.

Mr. Perkins, the grocer, was approached by a gentleman who sharply questioned his lack of humanity for not allowing poor boys to warm themselves by the fire. The grocer defended his actions by claiming the boys were mostly thieves and he couldn't keep an eye on them all the time. Despite being offered money to reconsider, the grocer remained firm. The boys, including Phil and Giacomo, were used to the grocer's harsh treatment as they believed he was above the law.

Phil had a plan in mind and was determined to act on it. He headed to a nearby inexpensive restaurant where they served meals for ten cents. Giacomo, though nervous, followed along. He knew their actions would anger their boss, but the idea of running away, suggested by Mr. Pomeroy, was starting to make sense to him. Phil felt the contract binding him to his father's agreement with the boss was unfair. The atmosphere in the restaurant was not appealing, but it welcomed all customers as long as they could pay. Giacomo was not used to sitting down for meals, unlike Phil who adapted easily. They ordered coffee and meat, which might not have been appetizing to others, but to them, it was a delightful feast. Despite the unlawful act, they enjoyed their meal, forgetting their worries for a moment.|"[""1.

Giacomo and Phil left the restaurant feeling refreshed after supper. Unfortunately, they were spotted by Pietro, who had a sinister nature. Pietro was pleased to have found them and informed his uncle. The boys had used money meant for their services, which was seen as a serious crime by the padrone. Pietro's uncle decided to punish the boys. As Phil and Giacomo wandered, the cold began to affect them. Giacomo, already weak, started to feel ill from the exposure and fatigue. Phil, unaware of Giacomo's worsening condition, played music with him to earn some money. They collected about fifty cents and decided to rest.

Giacomo continued to sleep peacefully, unaware of the noises outside and the chaos typical of a large hotel. A stout man passing by with his ten-year-old son noticed Giacomo asleep. An hour later, as the clock struck eleven, it was time to return to their strict guardian. The man, Phil, gently woke Giacomo from his dream of home, reminding him of the harsh reality of being far away. They walked back to their guardian's place, where Phil was unexpectedly offered supper despite knowing he might be punished for not bringing enough money. Phil, though hurt by the punishment, endured silently to protect Giacomo. The scene troubled Phil, who felt a strong sense of injustice but kept quiet to avoid further trouble.

The punishment persisted despite the cries and pleas for mercy from the young victim. By the eighth strike, his agony peaked, and he collapsed in a faint. The padrone initially thought it was a ruse and prepared for more blows, but the sight of the boy's pale face alarmed him. Not out of compassion, but fear of police intervention, he stopped. Giacomo was allowed to retreat to his uncomfortable bed, his back throbbing from the beating. Throughout the night, his fever worsened, prompting the padrone to take action not out of kindness, but to protect his source of income. Phil, also battered, felt a deeper pain for Giacomo, his childhood friend. The idea of escape crossed Phil's mind, contemplating a future free from oppression.

The call was followed by action. The boys rose, tired and sleepy, fearing their harsh overseer and his stick, always ready to punish. They quickly got ready, with no concern for cleanliness as their boss didn't bother about it. Phil wanted to see the cruel man suffer, but he knew better than to speak out, aware of Pietro's power. Despite the odds, Phil managed to see Giacomo, who lay weak in a corner. Giacomo expressed his weariness and desire to see someone he missed dearly. Phil, moved by the little boy's sadness, promised to convey his thoughts to her. After bidding goodbye to Giacomo, Phil set off on his journey, free to roam as he pleased. He started playing his fiddle, entertaining passersby, who joined in the fun. The lively tunes attracted a crowd, leading to a joyful street dance that caught the attention of a passing policeman.|"['1.

Phil stopped playing, ending the dance and dispersing the crowd. As the sailors were about to resume their walk, Phil boldly asked for money. Surprised by their generosity, Phil received a total of three dollars and fifteen cents. Although the sailors freely gave their money, Phil knew it would all go to the padrone. Despite the unsatisfactory nature of this arrangement, Phil continued his day, planning to buy dinner later. The weather was milder than the day before, and Phil enjoyed his walk up Fourth Avenue, passing notable landmarks. Suddenly, his violin was snatched by Tim Rafferty, seeking revenge for a previous encounter. Tim recognized Phil and took advantage of the opportunity to take the fiddle without permission.|"['1.

Phil faced a tough decision after Tim destroyed his fiddle. The instrument was his livelihood and belonged to his strict master, the padrone. Knowing he would be punished severely, Phil pondered his options. With three dollars in his pocket and the sailors' help, he decided to escape the city to avoid the padrone's wrath. Although leaving meant parting with his friend Giacomo, Phil felt it was the best choice. Staying would only lead to more trouble and wouldn't help his little companion.

It was still nine o'clock, and Phil had plenty of time before he would be missed by the padrone. He decided to walk down to the city's business area. Remembering his friend Paul Hoffman, the only reliable friend in the city besides Giacomo, he crossed the City Hall Park and Broadway to reach Paul's necktie stand. Paul offered Phil to stay with him in the city, pay a share of expenses, and save money. Paul suggested buying a fiddle for Phil and invited him for dinner. Phil strolled to the Battery, feeling strange without his violin, but elated about his future freedom. While walking down Wall Street, he noticed a pair of Italians, including a girl named Lucia, whom he thought he recognized from his hometown. This unexpected encounter with Lucia brought back memories of his Italian home and family, making him momentarily sad but hopeful.|"[""1.

Paul and Phil decided to purchase a fiddle together after a good dinner. They entered a small room filled with various items, mostly clothing, for pawning. The room was managed by an old man named Eliakim Henderson, who had been in America for forty years. Despite his poor appearance, he was rumored to be wealthy due to his profitable pawnbroker business. Paul had visited Eliakim before, but the old man did not recognize him. Paul advised Phil not to speak and took charge of the situation. Eliakim assumed the boys had come to pawn something, not buy, as most customers did.

As Phil and Paul entered the pawnshop, Phil noticed a fiddle hanging behind the counter, a better one than he was used to playing. Eliakim, the pawnbroker, eager to make a sale, offered the fiddle to Paul at a reasonable price. Paul, knowing the value, negotiated a bit and eventually purchased it with a two-dollar bill and some change.

Paul was worried that Pietro might recognize his old violin and question him about the new one, potentially jeopardizing his plans. To avoid any confrontation, Paul decided to turn down a different street to avoid being seen by Pietro. Luckily, Pietro had his back turned, so he didn't notice Paul. Paul was tempted to get Phil in trouble, as he hoped to gain favor with his master. Phil then entertained Jimmy with his violin playing. Later, Paul joined them, and they had a delightful time with music and dancing. The evening turned into an unexpected dancing party with visitors enjoying cake and ice cream.

Pietro, determined to find Phil, set off immediately after him. Despite not getting any helpful information from Paul, Pietro was optimistic as he believed he was close behind Phil.

Phil, 12, had a violin, Pietro, 18, an organ, making their speeds equal. Phil dashed into a house, hiding upstairs as Pietro arrived.

Pietro was furious. He suspected Phil was in the back room and wanted to search for him, but Bridget McGuire, a robust woman armed with a broom, blocked his way. Despite his vague idea of rushing past her to find Phil, Bridget's firm stance made it impractical. She swiftly wielded the broom, prompting Pietro to retreat as she bolted the door.

Pietro suspected Phil might escape from the back door, so he positioned himself there but was tricked by Mrs. McGuire. Phil, safe inside, drenched Pietro with hot water from above.

Mrs. McGuire quickly tended to her drenched child, expressing concern for his condition. Soon, calm returned, and the commotion was replaced by peace.

Meanwhile, poor Giacomo remained unwell. If he had been as strong as Phil, he would have recovered. However, being naturally fragile, exposure and lack of food had taken a toll on him. Giacomo asked Phil to promise to tell his mother in Italy about his condition and to ensure his little brother isn't sold to a padrone like him. An Italian physician shared that out of a hundred children sold into slavery, only twenty return home, thirty find work abroad, and fifty succumb to illness due to hardship. Phil, aware of the dangers in Newark, decided to move on. He found himself in a new village and joined some boys playing outside a school.
