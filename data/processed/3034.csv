The Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln signified the beginning of the end of a long era in human history. Slavery, one of the earliest forms of private property, had endured for centuries, sparking opposition, insurrection, and even civil war. The United States was among the last nations to abolish slavery legally. Emancipation in the U.S. marked the culmination of a century-long debate that encompassed the history of Western civilization. The literature on American slavery mirrored global discussions on the topic, drawing from sources like the Bible, Greek and Roman history, and English and French philosophy. These debates ultimately led to the recognition that all individuals are inherently free and equal, and that slavery contradicts the fundamental nature of humanity.|['1.

"The ongoing conflict between those who support different views on human nature, specifically the battle between liberty and despotism, has been a consistent theme throughout history. In the American fight against slavery, this clash is particularly evident. While the Athenians could advocate democracy and still endorse slavery, Americans in states established during the Declaration of Independence era faced a contradiction. The Declaration's assertion that all men are created equal clashed with the existence of slavery. The doctrine of equality, originally developed in Europe without regard to race, eventually extended to black individuals. Massachusetts, in 1780, enshrined the principle that ""All men are born free and equal,"" liberating slaves and granting them equal rights. The opposition to slavery and the slave trade grew alongside the fight for freedom during colonial times. The sentiment against slavery was a key part of the evolution of the concept of equal rights."|"['1. What is one of the main themes discussed in the passage?\nA. The evolution of democracy\nB.

In the early 19th century, the abolition of slavery was a complex issue in the United States. While theoretically everyone was against slavery, it still existed in many states. Some states found it easier to abolish slavery, while others struggled with it. By the 1820s, slavery had been abolished in some states but remained in others. The lack of debate on this issue was due to the fact that few defended slavery as just. Each state had its own policies, and there was no unified national approach to slavery. Families owned slaves based on personal choice, not state laws. The abolition movement was initially led by individuals, churches, and some states. The Quakers were active in advocating for emancipation. While some states had abolition societies, there was no widespread crusade against slavery at this time.|['1.

Before 1830, there were only a few active abolitionists who supported the cause with their time and money. Abolition societies were similar to groups that aimed to prevent cruelty to animals, advocating for men to fulfill their moral duties without resorting to violence. The abolitionists were known for their kindness and selfless dedication to helping those in need. The conflict between freedom and oppression became evident when slave owners defended slavery as a divine institution. The Mason-Dixon line, originally a boundary between Pennsylvania and Maryland, later symbolized the divide between slavery and freedom. The balance between free and slave states shifted as new states joined the Union. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 aimed to maintain this balance by prohibiting slavery above a certain latitude, marking a significant moment in the limitation of slavery in the United States.|['1.

During the 1800s, the United States faced a critical divide over slavery. With Arkansas and Michigan joining the Union, the balance between slave and free states was delicate. The South eyed Florida for slavery expansion, while the Northwest Territory was dedicated to freedom by laws like the Missouri Compromise. Southern planters pushed for more slave territories, leading to the annexation of Texas in 1845. Abolition movements varied across regions. New England abolished slavery early, while New York and New Jersey had more slaves until the 1820s. The middle section, including North Carolina and Tennessee, saw ongoing conflicts between free and slave labor. The anti-slavery movement originated in this region, with a focus on gradual emancipation and race relations. Border-state abolitionists emphasized compromise and colonization efforts.|['1.

The southernmost states, like South Carolina and Georgia, strongly supported slavery and resisted emancipation. Non-slaveholding whites in these states opposed slavery but lacked a voice. The ruling minority enforced pro-slavery views, believing whites were born to rule and blacks to serve. The cotton industry, especially in the South, solidified slavery's hold. The interstate slave trade united slave owners, making them collectively responsible. The ban on the African slave trade in 1807 was ineffective, fueling abolitionist movements. The shared guilt over slavery increased as the nation grappled with its history. Congress's actions against the African slave trade increased awareness of the need to regulate interstate slave commerce. This history shaped the country's evolving stance on slavery.|"[""1.

The West Indies and Mexico were closely linked to the United States in terms of slavery. When Jamestown was established, slavery was already established in the Caribbean islands, and the first slaves arrived in Virginia from there. Slavery was abolished in Hayti during the French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars, leading to a republican government composed of only black and mixed-race individuals. Abolitionists and Southern planters had differing views on the events in Hayti. Abolitionists believed that tyranny and oppression by white rulers led to the massacres, while planters saw it as evidence that slavery was necessary for racial peace. Other regions like Spanish America had abolished slavery without similar conflicts. Benjamin Lundy, a Quaker, played a crucial role in the anti-slavery movement by founding the Union Humane Society to help enslaved individuals. His beliefs in equality and opposition to slavery were rooted in Quaker principles of direct spiritual enlightenment for all.|"['1.

In 1819, Benjamin Lundy embarked on a mission to St. Louis, Missouri, where he immersed himself in the debate on slavery extension. Despite losing his possessions, he returned to Ohio and established the Genius of Universal Emancipation in 1821. After relocating the paper to Tennessee and then Baltimore, Lundy focused on traveling, lecturing, and forming abolitionist societies. During his journey, he met William Lloyd Garrison and collaborated with him. Although initially supporting colonization, Garrison shifted to advocating immediate emancipation. The duo worked together against the slave trade. Lundy's efforts led to the publication of anti-slavery papers like the National Inquirer. Despite facing challenges, Lundy's dedication to the abolitionist cause paved the way for future movements. His work left a lasting impact on the fight against slavery, inspiring others like Garrison to continue the struggle for freedom.|"['1. What did Benjamin Lundy establish in Ohio in 1821?\nA.

In Alabama, Birney led the cause of education. In 1830, he traveled to the North Atlantic to select educators for the State University and the Huntsville Female Seminary. Upon his return, he met with Henry Clay but their political ties severed when Clay refused to lead the emancipation movement in Kentucky. Birney, disheartened by the lack of progress, considered moving to Illinois but was appointed as an agent for the colonization society in the Southwest. Witnessing the slaveholders' aggressive expansion plans, Birney found the society's efforts futile. He returned to Kentucky in 1833, hoping to abolish slavery, but faced pro-slavery sentiments. Birney then embraced abolitionism, freeing his slaves in 1834. He became a prominent figure in the American Anti-Slavery Society, facing opposition but persisting in his fight for emancipation. Birney's foresight on the impending conflict between slavery and freedom preceded Lincoln and Seward's famous statements.|"['1.

There was a divide between Birney and William Lloyd Garrison due to their differing approaches to fighting slavery. Birney believed denouncing the Constitution and avoiding political action would lead to disaster, while Garrison's followers supported these views. Birney, advocating for legal and constitutional methods, gained support from abolitionists in New England. He later became the Liberty party's candidate for President, receiving over 60,000 votes. However, an injury left him disabled, ending his political career. Sarah and Angelina Grimke, born in a slaveholding family, were strong advocates for freedom. Angelina, known for her crusade against slavery, rejected gifts of slaves and even left the church when it did not support her cause. She moved North to join her sister Sarah, becoming a powerful voice against slavery.|"[""1.

During the 1800s, Angelina Grimke faced opposition for her anti-slavery efforts. In Charleston, her writings were burned, and she was forbidden to land in the city. Alongside her sister, she challenged racial segregation at Quaker meetings. Moving to Philadelphia, they held successful talks that attracted large audiences. Angelina's influential speaking style led her to New York and Boston, where she addressed both men and women on political issues. Angelina Grimke was a pioneer in advocating for women's rights to speak in public about important matters.

"In the early days of the American Anti-Slavery Society, women played a crucial role. They were already well-organized and actively engaged in work that men couldn't do. The women in Indiana, part of effective anti-slavery societies disguised as ""library associations,"" worked quietly and effectively. Men's involvement in these activities would have raised suspicion. Women rode out to nearby towns, gathering information, distributing literature, and planning how to extend their efforts. Men supported these endeavors by providing resources. The women's efforts were instrumental in reaching men in enemy territories through subtle means like sewing circles. Over time, the disguise was shed, and public anti-slavery speeches were given.

In 1833, Oberlin College in northern Ohio made history by admitting women on equal terms with men, becoming the first institution to offer higher education to all races and genders. Professor Asa Mahan, an abolitionist, refused the presidency unless African Americans were also admitted. Oberlin was known for its radical reforms, including banning alcohol and tobacco. Women graduates like Lucy Stone and Susan B. Anthony emerged as influential voices on temperance and women's rights. The fight against slavery, intemperance, women's rights, and war intertwined, with abolitionists advocating for peace to avoid conflict. Slavery ended with the Civil War, progress was made against intemperance, and efforts for gender equality continue. Oberlin set a precedent for inclusive education, paving the way for women to participate in lawmaking and administration, as predicted by Samuel May over seventy years ago.|"['1.

During the abolition movement, various abolitionists like Lundy, Birney, and Garrison advocated for the immediate and unconditional liberation of slaves. Garrison, a prominent figure, was known for his uncompromising stance against slavery. The New England Anti-Slavery Society, organized by Garrison, aimed to achieve emancipation through moral persuasion without violence. Despite some extreme rhetoric from a few individuals, most abolitionists focused on civil and religious liberties. Garrison's approach, characterized by harsh language against pro-slavery advocates, stood out. His publication, the Liberator, based in Boston, faced backlash from Southern defenders of slavery. While some statements were misconstrued, the abolition movement's core principle was nonviolent moral suasion.

Southern planters in the United States were concerned about the abolition of slavery in Mexico and the British West Indies. Mexico and Colombia encouraged Cuba to end slavery and join the New World republics, which worried the United States. Spain and Mexico were warned that the US would not allow the emancipation of slaves in Cuba. With the British Emancipation Act of 1833, Cuba became the only nearby place where slavery was legal. This fueled Southern planters' determination to expand slavery to the southwest. Despite strong anti-slavery sentiments in Virginia, a petition for gradual emancipation was debated but not granted. The debate highlighted the negative impact of slavery on industries and the need for corrective action, but no steps were taken towards emancipation. The public debate revealed the deep-rooted conflicts surrounding slavery, with no progress made towards abolition.|"['1.

In the early 1800s, Southern leaders like Professor Thomas Dew argued against emancipation in Virginia, claiming it was either undesirable or impossible. This marked the beginning of direct pro-slavery arguments. Governor of South Carolina in 1835 called slavery the foundation of their society. Senator Calhoun later stated slavery was a positive good. By 1852, poet W. G. Simms praised slavery as a blessing. However, English author Harriet Martineau found few slaveholders who justified it justly. The spirit of mob violence emerged, silencing free speech on slavery. Southern statesmen failed to agree on gradual emancipation. This led to hostility towards human liberty, with rights like freedom of speech and assembly being attacked. Abolitionists realized that slavery threatened the freedom of both black and white people. The suppression of free discussion forced many abolitionists to move North or face violence. Mob violence was rampant, meetings disrupted, and property destroyed.|['**1.

During the 1800s, many fair-minded individuals became abolitionists not only to fight for the rights of African Americans but also to protect the rights of white Americans. Salmon P. Chase, Gerrit Smith, and Wendell Phillips were inspired to join the cause after witnessing injustices against freedom and equality. For example, a school in Connecticut, run by Miss Prudence Crandall, was shut down for educating African American girls. Southern states even tried to silence anti-slavery efforts in the North, offering rewards for the arrest of abolitionist publishers. Despite threats and intimidation, abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison stood up for their beliefs, facing persecution and legal challenges. The fight for freedom and equality continued as states like Massachusetts and Rhode Island resisted pressure to suppress anti-slavery societies, showing a commitment to upholding rights and liberties for all.|['1.

"In 1836, a resolution known as the ""gag resolution"" was passed in the House of Representatives to silence any discussion on slavery or its abolition. This led to a fierce battle between John Quincy Adams and the majority in the House. Adams, known as the ""old man eloquent,"" fought tirelessly against this resolution, arguing that it violated the Constitution and the rights of his constituents. He cleverly used petitions to challenge the gag resolution, causing uproar and debate in the House. Despite facing threats of censure and expulsion, Adams stood his ground, defending the right of petition and freedom of speech. With the support of others like Joshua R. Giddings, who fought against slavery on the high seas, Adams and his allies succeeded in overturning the oppressive resolution and championing the cause of liberty."|"['1.

In the fight for freedom, different tactics were used in the North and South. While mob violence was common in the North, the South turned to repressive laws and social exclusion. These measures successfully silenced public support for abolitionism. The Presbyterian Church split into Old School and New School factions over doctrinal differences, with the Old School supporting slavery in the South and the New School opposing it in the North. Similar divisions occurred in the Methodist and Baptist Churches, further polarizing the nation. The threat of civil war loomed as the South sought to protect slavery at all costs. John Quincy Adams warned that any attempt to disrupt the Union would lead to conflict, with emancipation as a likely outcome. The annexation of Texas and the Mexican War intensified the debate over slavery, with Adams leading the charge against its expansion. His unwavering opposition to slavery continued until his health failed in 1846.|"['1. What were the tactics used in the North and South in the fight for freedom?\nA. Mob violence in both regions\nB.

In 1840, the debate on extending slave territory gained attention nationwide. Abolitionists felt compelled to act politically and sought support from established parties. The Democrats openly denounced abolitionists, while the Whigs remained ambiguous or unsupportive. Consequently, the abolitionists formed their own party and nominated James G. Birney for President in 1840. The issue of Texas annexation was evaded by both major parties during the campaign. The Democrats favored Texas annexation in their platform, contrasting the Whigs' silent stance. The election of James K. Polk, a Democrat, was seen as endorsing Texas annexation. The Liberty party's vote was crucial, influencing the election's outcome. Despite criticism for impacting the Whigs' defeat, the Liberty party leaders justified their actions based on historical interactions with Henry Clay and their anti-slavery stance. Democrats were accused of provoking a war with Mexico to expand slavery, while some Democrats opposed further slavery expansion. Ultimately, a bill to prohibit slavery in acquired Mexican territories failed in the Senate.|"['1.

During the war, the Wilmot Proviso sparked debates in Congress and across the country until the treaty with Mexico in 1848. The acquisition of new territory raised the question of whether it should allow slavery or remain free. As a presidential election approached, the issue of slavery divided the Northern Democrats, who opposed its extension, and the Southern Whigs, who supported it. Both major parties avoided taking a clear stance on the matter. The division within the Democratic party led to the formation of the Free Soil party, which opposed slavery. Led by Martin Van Buren, this party gained significant support and influenced the election outcome. The rise of this political force marked a turning point in the fight against slavery, uniting anti-slavery advocates across the country and challenging the existing political parties.|['1.

The boundaries for political action were now clear. Emancipation in the States should be done through state action. Most leaders agreed that Congress couldn't end slavery in the States. They urged the federal Government to abolish slavery and the slave-trade in the District of Columbia and areas under direct federal control. They also pushed for strict enforcement of laws against the foreign slave-trade and laws against the interstate slave-trade. The constitutionality of these actions was widely accepted. Abolitionists were trailblazers in creating political platforms. The principles outlined by Garrison in 1833 and adopted by the American Anti-Slavery Society were like a political platform. Voting to support emancipation was emphasized. In 1840, there was no platform for the first political campaign, but four years later, a detailed party platform with twenty-one resolutions was introduced. The Liberty party's platform focused on human brotherhood as the basis for democracy, aiming for equal rights in all social relations. The party was not just about freeing slaves but about upholding the principles of liberty. The party's roots were traced back to 1776, echoing the spirit of the nation's founding. The fight against slavery continued in later platforms, aligning with the founding principles of the nation.|"[""1.

In the mid-19th century, significant events shaped politics and the slavery debate. Europe saw uprisings, leading to new constitutions in France, Switzerland, Prussia, and Austria. Political turmoil in Austria and Germany drove liberty supporters to America. Hungarian revolutionary Kossuth captivated American audiences, highlighting European oppression. As the world shrank, America expanded to Japan and China, forging political ties. Industrial reorganization, spurred by inventions like the telegraph, fueled national growth. Gold in California spurred railroad projects to the Pacific, emphasizing the divide between free and slave states. The telegraph revolutionized communication and journalism, influencing anti-slavery sentiments. Political shifts accompanied the passing of older leaders, like Webster and Clay, to younger figures like Seward and Douglas. Calhoun's evolving pro-slavery stance clashed with abolitionists' beliefs, shaping the intense slavery debate.|"['1.

"When the United States acquired Mexican territory, Stephen A. Douglas, a prominent senator, had strong views on slavery in new territories. He believed in expanding the United States without any limits and saw the nation as a future global power. Douglas, with personal connections to the South, understood slavery firsthand. He believed that slavery should not expand further, advocating for free states in new territories. Douglas supported California's admission as a free state and opposed interference with existing laws that prohibited slavery in Western territories. He played a key role in the Compromise of 1850, allowing residents of Utah and New Mexico to decide on slavery. This policy of ""non-intervention"" led to the eventual repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The rush to California's goldfields led to the exclusion of slavery in its constitution, sparking debates between Northern and Southern states."|"[""1. What was Stephen A.

There was a lot of concern about how the government was acting. Taylor, the new president, had been chosen because the Democratic party was divided between the North and the South. The North didn't trust their own party and voted for a different candidate. The South didn't like their candidate and voted for Taylor. Taylor accepted the nomination from the Southern Democrats. The North had a hard time keeping their members from voting for Taylor. Taylor thought the North was trying to take away the South's rights. He sent troops to stop the South from extending slavery into New Mexico. When Southern Whigs tried to stop him, Taylor said he would hang anyone who committed treason. He didn't agree with a compromise between the North and the South. California became a free state, but Congress didn't say much about slavery in New Mexico and Utah. The South thought the new laws were fake, and the North thought they were giving in to the South too much. Texas got money for giving up some land. The slave trade in Washington, D.C. was stopped, but slavery was still allowed.|"[""1.

The compromise measures included five acts, with the most impactful being the return of fugitive slaves, fueling hostility between the North and South. The debate on the Omnibus Bill led to various proposed laws to replace the 1793 law. Webster suggested a bill using a jury to verify a claim to an escaped slave, but the final law enacted by a weary Congress was deemed barbaric. An incident involving James Hamlet exemplified the harshness of the law. The Southern push for the law stemmed from motives beyond reclaiming property, aiming to divide parties along sectional lines. The law's passage eliminated a major party, leading to sectional party formations. The Democratic national convention fervently supported the law, signaling its permanence despite its failures. Fugitive slaves sought refuge in Canada, prompting the development of the Underground Railroad. Washington's actions and letters reflected the complexities and tensions surrounding fugitive slave laws.|"['1.

During the 1820s and 1830s, a crucial shift occurred in the treatment of fugitive slaves in the United States. As the foreign slave trade was banned and domestic trade flourished, a pro-slavery sentiment took hold in the South, pushing anti-slavery advocates out. This led to the emergence of organized aid for escaped slaves, notably with the Underground Railroad. The movement gained momentum with the spread of anti-slavery groups and the passage of the 1850 law. The Underground Railroad, led by figures like Levi Coffin, helped many escape bondage.

Levi Coffin, a key figure in the Underground Railroad, helped many enslaved individuals escape to freedom. In one daring rescue, Sam, a fugitive, was to be hidden in a wagon and taken to a free state. The risks were high as laws imposed the death penalty for stealing slaves. On their way to finalize the escape plan, they narrowly evaded horsemen searching for runaways. Coffin later became a merchant in Indiana, aiding more fugitives. He even converted skeptics, showing them the harsh reality faced by those seeking freedom. Through his actions, Coffin not only saved lives but also changed hearts, demonstrating the power of compassion and empathy in the fight against slavery.|"[""1.

"The split within the Quaker community in Indiana, linked to Levi Coffin, reflects a common stance among churches on slavery. The Quakers embraced the anti-slavery movement to free themselves from the burden of slavery, transforming their Society into an anti-slavery group. Despite this, they disagreed on how to act. Many objected to aiding fugitives and hosting anti-slavery talks in their meetinghouses. The emergence of the Liberty party deepened the divide. In 1843, radicals broke away, forming the ""Anti-Slavery Friends Society,"" leading to separate meetinghouses like ""Liberty Hall."" The crisis eased after the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, dissolving separate groups and unifying under the common cause. There was a natural inclination to help fugitives, even in the South. Richard Dillingham's story in Nashville exemplifies this, showing sympathy towards those aiding slaves. Fugitives traveled in various ways, often guided by the North Star to freedom in the North or Canada."|"['1.

During the 19th century, the Underground Railroad provided a secret network of routes for slaves seeking freedom. The Connecticut River Valley and Lake Champlain region were key paths to the north. Quakers in Philadelphia, Delaware, and Maryland aided fugitives, while the Appalachian Mountains offered a natural escape route. The Mississippi Valley and Ohio were also pivotal areas, with anti-slavery settlers and Quakers providing refuge. The Liberty and Free-soil parties openly opposed the Fugitive Slave Act, advocating for aid to fugitives. The Underground Railroad, though not a major emancipation strategy, played a crucial role in helping slaves reach free states.

"During the 1850s, the Fugitive Slave Act stirred a storm in the United States. This law demanded the return of escaped slaves to their owners, causing panic among those living in the Northern States. The Act led to violent clashes, like the incident where two Quakers intervened to protect a fugitive, resulting in the death of a slave-hunter. Despite the tension, some citizens, like Gerrit Smith and a clergyman, defied the law to help slaves escape to Canada. Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" shed light on the harsh realities of slavery and the Underground Railroad.

"Laws created to protect slave property are revealed to be harmful to the basic rights of free individuals; they are cruel. A Senator from Ohio, who could eloquently discuss his commitment to upholding the Fugitive Slave Law while in the capital, turns into a blatant violator of the law when at home with his family. The essence of human nature clashes with the vested interests of a few slave owners. The tale of Uncle Tom put all backers of the law on guard. It was widely read and debated in both the North and South. The appearance of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" prompted a response from the South, leading to a general discourse that was enlightening overall. However, the immediate political impact of the book was not as significant as expected. While adults could read and move on, young boys like the thirteen-year-old were deeply affected. The Republican party in 1860 gained significant support from first-time voters, owing much to ""Uncle Tom's Cabin."" Two approaches were swiftly dismantling the continuation of slavery in the U.S. Mrs. Stowe captured the moral and humanitarian sentiment against slavery, while Frederick Law Olmsted's observations on the South highlighted the detrimental effects of slavery on various aspects of society.

The book by Helper reignited a long-standing debate about slavery in the South. Helper suggested organizing non-slaveholding whites into a political party to combat the negative effects of slavery on the Southern economy. He proposed excluding slaveholders from government and treating them as criminals. His ideas caused a stir among Southern leaders, challenging the status quo. Helper believed that the Appalachian mountains created a divide between the coastal planters and upland dwellers, where slavery couldn't thrive. The publication of his book, along with others like Olmsted's, shed light on the financial ruin slavery was causing in the South.

"From early 1854 to late May, Douglas's Nebraska bill captivated Congress and the nation. Initially, the bill implied the Missouri Compromise was replaced by the Act of 1850. Later, amendments repealed the revered act. Originally, Nebraska was to be one vast Territory from Texas to Canada. Subsequently, separate Territories were proposed: Kansas west of Missouri and Nebraska west of Iowa. Opposition arose from Free-soilers, Northern Whigs, some Southern Whigs, and many Northern Democrats. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise stunned the North. Douglas faced immense unpopularity and party backlash. ""Anti-Nebraska men"" shifted to Republicans. Eli Thayer of Massachusetts proposed sending anti-slavery settlers to Kansas and Nebraska. The Emigrant Aid Company was formed to promote this. The first settlers arrived in Kansas in August 1854, with more following. Missourians swiftly moved in to secure pro-slavery dominance.

"The Governor of Kansas issued certificates to those chosen by the horde from Missouri and other precincts. In July, the pro-slavery party won seven contests in the Legislature, leading to the resignation of the single free-state member. Governor Reeder believed President Pierce would nullify the election, so he journeyed to Washington in April. Along the way, he spoke out against the ""border ruffians"" from Missouri, emphasizing the injustices in Kansas. President Pierce, aligning with Jefferson Davis, sympathized with western Missouri residents, viewing Northern involvement in Kansas as a violation of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. Governor Reeder resisted pressure to resign without presidential approval of his actions. A deadlock ensued when the Legislature relocated near the Missouri border, prompting Governor Reeder's removal and Wilson Shannon's appointment.

A significant change occurred with the arrival of John Brown in Kansas. Brown and his sons resided in Osawatomie, near Lawrence. They were involved in the defense of Lawrence after it was attacked. Subsequently, Brown and his sons, along with a few others, took part in a midnight attack on pro-slavery settlers in Pottawatomie valley, resulting in the death of five men.

Charles Sumner began his political career in 1847 as a Whig, opposing the extension of slavery and advocating for emancipation in all states. Despite failing to secure his party's commitment to this policy, he became a Free-soiler in 1848. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1851, Sumner continuously held this office until his death in 1874. Unlike John Quincy Adams, who addressed audiences not defending slavery morally, Sumner faced a new school that upheld slavery as morally right. Sumner went beyond opposing pro-slavery to attacking the institution itself as a moral evil. While not as skilled a constitutional lawyer as Daniel Webster, Sumner meticulously researched and presented arguments against slavery. His eloquence and dedication to his cause set him apart, though his aloofness to Southern conditions and direct attacks on the morality of slavery incited bitter opposition.|"[""1.

To maintain a clear historical timeline, it is essential to exclude any mention of John Brown since he was not a public figure at that time. Governor Robinson and the free-state settlers were ready to resist the federal government as soon as there was a clear case of wrongdoing directly linked to the Administration in Washington. The tipping point came when the United States marshal deployed troops to aid Sheriff Jones in looting Lawrence. Governor Robinson then openly endorsed resistance to anyone using force to impose a rejected government on Kansas. During a speech, Sumner likened Senators Butler and Douglas to characters from literature, which led to a heated exchange. Two days later, Preston Brooks viciously attacked Sumner in the Senate chamber, sparking outrage in the North and glorification in the South. This event further deepened the divide between pro-slavery and anti-slavery factions, setting the stage for heightened tensions and political shifts.|"[""1.

Charles Sumner, a prominent figure in the Senate, faced severe injuries that initially seemed minor but later proved to be serious. Despite attempts to return to his duties, he found himself unable to continue and spent much time recovering in Europe. By December 1859, he felt well enough to address the Senate, delivering a powerful speech against slavery. Sumner's vast knowledge of history and literature allowed him to craft eloquent speeches that resonated with many, shaping political discourse in America and Europe. While not always aligned with his colleagues, Sumner's oratory skills and deep understanding of history positioned him as a leading voice against slavery. His influence extended beyond Congress, shaping public opinion and influencing political leaders. Despite challenges in Kansas, Sumner's dedication to freedom and justice remained unwavering.|"['1.

"During the events in Kansas, the pro-slavery party took control of the constitutional convention. Governor Walker assured that any constitution would need approval from the majority of voters. The pro-slavery convention aimed to make Kansas a slave state by removing the free-state legislature and Governor. They manipulated the election and crafted a constitution to secure approval from President Buchanan. The constitution forced voters to choose between ""with slavery"" or ""with no slavery."" The vote favored slavery, but the free-state legislature rejected it. Despite President Buchanan's support, a bill was passed requiring the people of Kansas to vote on the constitution.

"The battle between slavery and freedom played out in Kansas, with Missouri's slavery preservation at its core. Charles Robinson's address in 1855 highlighted the issue, questioning why neighboring Missourians invaded to protect their own slavery. The settlers in Kansas, mostly free-state men, saw slavery as impractical in their new land. Despite efforts to entice Southerners to Kansas, the number of slaves never surpassed three hundred due to the climate and soil favoring freedom. The Supreme Court's 1857 Dred Scott case decision, led by Chief Justice Taney, declared that Congress couldn't ban slavery in the Territories. Taney's controversial statement, ""the negro has no rights,"" was attributed to the Founding Fathers' supposed misunderstanding of the Declaration of Independence's intent regarding African Americans.

The Dred Scott case ruling stirred controversy during a time when the North had a deep understanding of the nation's founding principles regarding slavery. The Republican party, rooted in Thomas Jefferson's ideals, believed slavery had no place in the territories. However, the Democratic party endorsed popular sovereignty, allowing territories to decide on slavery independently. The Supreme Court's decision, favoring slave owners, further divided opinions. Southern leaders, influenced by pro-slavery teachings, firmly supported slavery as a divine institution. Presidents Pierce and Buchanan, once anti-slavery, aligned with Southern beliefs. Buchanan even praised the Court's ruling, viewing slavery as a lawful and sacred right. This clash of ideologies intensified the political divide leading up to the 1860 election.|"[""1.

"The majority of Supreme Court justices embraced Calhoun's theory in 1847, hoping to calm tensions and preserve the Union. However, dissenting views emerged, sparking further debate. Stephen A. Douglas played a key role in defeating the Lecompton Constitution and faced off against Abraham Lincoln in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln, recognizing the moral divide on slavery, emphasized the impossibility of reconciling it with freedom. He famously stated, ""A house divided against itself cannot stand,"" highlighting the nation's struggle with slavery.

The fight against slavery was reaching a critical point. Led by influential figures like Sumner, Seward, and Lincoln, a new political party was emerging. This party was built on the belief that slavery is not just wrong morally but also politically. It had grown so much that it seemed likely to win the upcoming presidential election. On the other side, Davis and Yancey, the main supporters of slavery, were making plans for what would happen if a Republican President was elected. Their decisions were crucial for the fate of the Union. The battle against slavery was driven by the idea that it disrupts society, much like war. Southern and Western abolitionists aimed to prevent conflicts and uprisings. However, tensions rose, leading to a clash between the North and defenders of slavery. This eventually led to a confrontation in Kansas, where strong anti-slavery sentiments were embodied by John Brown.|"[""1.

"In 1834, Brown became interested in educating African American children in Pennsylvania and later in Ohio. By 1848, the Brown family joined an initiative in northern New York, offering land to African American families. During the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, Brown organized ""The United States League of Gileadites"" in Springfield, Massachusetts. He instructed them to be armed and ready to defend each other if attacked. Brown's document encouraged African Americans to stand for their liberties and be prepared to outnumber adversaries. He emphasized the importance of secrecy in their plans and swift action once ready. Brown advised them to engage fully and not to meddle with others.

About six weeks later, news arrived of an attack on Lawrence. John Brown, Junior, joined the Osawatomie Rifles to help the town, while his father, along with a small group, also headed in that direction. In a letter to his wife dated June 26, 1856, Brown mentioned their journey to Lawrence, finding it already destroyed. They camped with John's group for a night. The next day, they encountered pro-slavery men, captured some horses, and were falsely accused of killing five men at Pottawatomie. Brown's company disbanded, and they faced challenges from Missourians. This led to a civil war in Kansas. While views on Brown's actions varied, his belief in sparking a revolution for freedom was a driving force behind his deeds.

After the arrest of Captain Pate at Black Jack in early June, information about John Brown and his group becomes scarce for two months. Besides a skirmish near Osawatomie, Brown avoided direct confrontations between organized forces. His involvement in the irregular guerrilla warfare of the time remains uncertain. Towards the end of the conflict, one of Brown's sons was shot by a preacher who claimed to have been robbed by the Browns. After Governor Geary restored peace in Kansas, Brown retreated from local affairs. John Brown's impact in Kansas, akin to William Lloyd Garrison's role in the anti-slavery movement, has been misunderstood. Brown aimed for a revolution across pro-slavery states leading to universal emancipation, contrasting the freestate settlers who sought legal methods for a free state. Brown's year in Kansas ended in isolation as he differed on means to achieve his goals. Despite raising funds in the East, Brown's plans diverged from aiding Kansas, focusing on a broader liberation effort.|"['1.

"During his time at Tabor, Brown received urgent requests from Lane and other Kansas associates to bring his forces to aid them. Lane feared an invasion from Missouri during the upcoming territorial Legislature election. Although the appeal didn't work, the election was a success for the free-state forces. Brown, after a victory for the law-and-order party, was urged to come to Kansas with his forces. Instead, he went alone and recruited followers for a ""school"" in Iowa. Brown hinted at different plans to his Eastern friends and sought support for a grander scheme. In early 1858, a council was held in New York where Brown outlined his intention to start operations in Virginia's mountains. Despite initial objections, Smith and Sanborn eventually agreed to support him. Forbes, who knew of Brown's plans, mistakenly believed Brown's Boston friends were aware too, causing confusion. The New England Aid Society's arms meant for Kansas were redirected to Virginia, causing a delay in the Harper's Ferry attack. Brown, under the alias ""Shubal Morgan,"" led a band that raided Missouri, taking slaves and supplies, violating agreements.

Brown dedicated much time and effort to create a constitution for the temporary government he planned to establish. In early 1858, he meticulously crafted this document over several weeks at Frederick Douglass's home in Rochester, New York. The constitution, with forty-eight articles, was presented at a meeting with Sanborn and Gerrit Smith in February and approved in Canada in May 1858. The preamble strongly condemns slavery as a cruel and unjust war against citizens. The document aimed to safeguard lives, liberties, and property without inciting rebellion. Mobilization began in June 1859, with preparations at Kennedy farm near Harper's Ferry. On the night of October 16th, Brown's party took control of the town without firing a shot. However, due to fears of exposure, their plans changed, leading to a standoff at the engine-house. Despite attempts to negotiate, Brown and his men were eventually surrounded and captured after a failed attempt to resist.|"['1.

Around midnight, Colonel Robert E. Lee arrived with a group of marines from Washington to take charge of the situation at Harper's Ferry. Lee set up a guard around the engine-house and prepared to forcibly enter if a peaceful surrender was not granted by sunrise. Despite local companies declining the task, Lieutenant Green of the marines led the charge to storm the building. A parley between Brown and Lieutenant Stuart resulted in Brown's refusal to surrender. Subsequently, Lieutenant Green's squad attempted to break in, leading to a brief but intense confrontation where Brown was subdued. The hostages were unharmed, and Brown's actions left a lasting impression on all involved. The events at Harper's Ferry, although sensationalized, had a significant impact on the political climate leading up to the Civil War.|"[""1. What did Colonel Robert E.

"John Brown's impact on American history lies not in his actions but in the symbolism he represents. He is seen as the embodiment of the unending conflict between freedom and oppression. John Brown exemplifies a crucial lesson from history: that oppression and tyranny are forms of warfare, leading to bloodshed when the powerful impose their will on the weak. Abraham Lincoln emphasized that no one is fit to rule over another; those who are worthy would not seek such power. Various historical accounts, such as J. F. Rhodes' ""History of the United States"" and A. B. Hart's ""Slavery and Abolition,"" shed light on the complexities of the slavery controversy and its impact on American politics."|"['1.
