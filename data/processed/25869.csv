""Oh, stop it, dad,"" Patty said, giggling, knowing that her slang phrases amused her father, even though they irritated him. ""If you help me 'do noble things, not just dream about them,' I promise to speak only in the purest English.""

""She'll get past it,"" he remarked. ""A few years pursuing her 'noble goals' will make her so serious that she won't even understand slang. Though, I must say, I find some of them quite fitting.""

""But let me tell you one thing,"" Mr. Hepworth added, ""Whatever path you choose, make sure it doesn't require specialized training. If you opt for organized charity or community work, that's great.

Patty arrived at a fancy hat shop with Miller, feeling a bit out of place. The saleswoman, Miss O'Flynn, was reserved towards Patty, unlike the warmth Patty was used to. Despite being amused, Patty felt embarrassed. Miss O'Flynn, assuming Patty was from a wealthy background, allowed her to work for the day to prove her skills.

Patty was engrossed in her work, cutting, fitting, pinning, and sewing with precision. She was so focused that she didn't notice her companions leaving at noon. Alone, she continued sewing the satin.

Patty, initially defensive, realized the importance of proper technique. With renewed confidence, she tackled two hat designs - one elaborate and the other simple yet daring. The elaborate hat featured an intricate design of roses and foliage, while the simpler one had a black velvet Gainsborough style with a rosette and buckle.

Patty felt small after triumphing over Miss O'Flynn. She disliked the atmosphere at Madame Villard's shop. The fake politeness of Miss O'Flynn and the artificial grandeur of Madame Villard repelled her. Patty just wanted to leave and return home.

Patty politely greeted Miss O'Flynn before leaving the shop. As she stepped out, she hopped into a fancy car that quickly drove away. Patty shared her relief with her father, expressing her distaste for the artificial and pretentious behavior of the women at the shop. She preferred honesty over grandiosity. The next day, Patty enjoyed skating with her friends, forming a group they called the Quartette. They found amusement in the goldfish at the Fairfield house, where a warm and welcoming atmosphere contrasted with the formality at the Farringtons'. The group planned fun activities together, steering clear of unnecessary drama. Mr. Hepworth discouraged Patty from pursuing a scheme to help a talented artist, assuring her that he would find a way to support the artist without Patty having to visit unsavory places.
