"In Wyoming, George Ripley and his wife Ruth, pioneers from Connecticut, built log houses. They had a son, Benjamin, and later, a daughter, Alice. Mr. Ripley fought with General Washington's army, leaving Benjamin visiting friends. Alone, Alice played ""Jack Stones"" outdoors. Chubby, with blue eyes and yellow hair in a coil, she wore a brown homespun dress her mother made. Left-handed, she played the game until an Indian warrior, Omas, appeared. Despite his fierce appearance, Alice wasn't scared. They were friends since Omas stayed at their cabin. He shared having a daughter named Linna, forming a bond with Alice. Omas, tall and painted, carried a rifle, knife, and tomahawk. Despite his fearsome look, Alice saw past it, forming a unique friendship with the warrior."|"['1.

Omas had promised to bring his daughter, Linna, to visit Alice Ripley. Despite being a Delaware warrior, Omas often went out of his way to spend time with Alice and her family. Linna, a young girl like Alice, arrived wearing tiny moccasins and a simple dress, showing her unique heritage. Alice warmly welcomed Linna, and the two girls quickly bonded, playing and laughing together as if they were long-lost sisters. Linna's father, Omas, watched over them with a silent affection.

Upon Linna's return, Mrs. Ripley looked for her son, but he was not in sight. Omas, a Delaware, stood nearby and gestured for her to approach. In a hushed voice, he warned her that they must leave soon due to impending danger from Tories and Indians. Mrs. Ripley, aware of the risks and the absence of able-bodied men fighting for independence, felt her heart race at the thought of the looming threat. Her son, carrying a rifle, reassured her that they would stand their ground against the impending attack. Despite her fears, the brave woman found solace in her son's unwavering optimism and determination to protect their home in Wyoming.|"['1.

Linna found herself viewing the situation like Ben did. If Wyoming faced great danger, it would be cowardly to abandon their friends. Not everyone could find safety by leaving, and she would feel guilty if she ignored the others. The Delaware girl didn't fully grasp the importance of the situation. She was a bit overwhelmed by the boy's urgency and nodded in agreement. Everything was unfamiliar to Linna. In her home, she sat on the ground and used her fingers to eat, but her friends helped her adjust. Initially, Linna wanted to sleep on the hard floor, having never used a bed before, but later agreed to share the bed. Mrs. Ripley felt compelled to introduce Linna to her heavenly Father and teach her to pray. Linna listened intently as the story of the Savior was shared. The next morning, Omas didn't return, leaving Mrs. Ripley to face the looming danger alone.|"[""1.

In 1778, during the American Revolutionary War, the Wyoming Valley faced a tense situation. Mrs. Ripley and the settlers were urged to leave for Forty Fort due to the imminent threat of British soldiers and Native American allies led by Colonel John Butler. The settlers were forced to take only essentials as space was limited. Little Linna, filled with wonder, prepared to move with her friends. Meanwhile, Colonel Zebulon Butler and the patriots at Forty Fort decided to confront the invaders. The battle began with musket fire and whoops of the Iroquois. Despite the challenging circumstances and some men drinking excessively before the battle, the Americans managed to gain ground.

During the intense battle, the red men flanking the patriots caused chaos with their continuous fire. The Indians on the Tory left split into six groups, yelling to boost morale. The Americans faced deadly accuracy from the Indians, especially a powerful group on the left. As confusion reigned and some mistook orders, an elderly man, too feeble to fight, felt a surge of strength. Amid the chaos, young Ben Ripley stood steady, earning praise for his composure. Amid conflicting commands and a panic, Ben found himself facing an Iroquois warrior. Another warrior, Omas, intervened, pulling Ben away from danger. Omas swiftly led Ben away from the battle, protecting him from pursuing enemies. In a moment of respite, Omas released Ben, and they exchanged silent understanding as they sought safety.|"[""1.

Omas signaled the group to rush to the eastern side of the Susquehanna to head towards settlements on the Upper Delaware. The closest town, Stroudsburg, was sixty miles away through a daunting forest. Omas knew the British Colonel Butler might accept their surrender, but restraining the Tories and Indians would be challenging. The only option was to flee immediately, with many already heading to the river to seek safety. Some hid on Monacacy Island, but were hunted mercilessly. Omas, wise to the danger, guided Ben towards Forty Fort to avoid conflict. Amidst the chaos, Omas protected the precious canoe. While the group faced hardships, Omas ensured their safety, even if it meant parting ways with loved ones in the turmoil.|['1.

"The Delaware swam high out of the water, knowing that the boat might attract his people's attention on the bank. If they thought the occupants were escaping, they might pursue or fire at them. The mountain range east of Wyoming Valley is a thousand feet high, filled with ravines, rocks, and rugged terrain. Fugitives escaping the Indians had to cross these mountains and then navigate sixty miles of dense forest to reach the Delaware River. The forest was so treacherous that it earned the name ""The Shades of Death."" Omas swam at the rear of the canoe with Mrs. Ripley and her children inside. Linna, the little Indian girl, playfully splashed water at her father during the journey. Upon reaching the eastern shore, they looked back at the burning Fort Wintermoot. The sound of rifles in the distance signaled the chase of fugitives. Queen Esther's Rock, named after a cruel woman, marks a tragic event during the conflict. Despite the dangers, some fugitives managed to outsmart their pursuers and escape."|"['1.

The Ripleys left their home on the eastern shore that morning, crossing over in a flatboat with other families. Omas guided them near their house. They had no food, relying on Ben's gun for hunting. They aimed for Stroudsburg, a few days away. Omas hesitated, hinting at a different plan. Ben knew the area but not as well as the Delaware. They stopped at the house for food. The group ate quickly and then set off with Omas leading. The rugged terrain challenged them as they traveled silently. A rifle shot startled them, but Omas remained calm, signaling no danger. They continued, alert in the dark, following Omas through the mountains.|"[""1.

"Through the dense woods and past the mountain, the group journeyed until nightfall. Omas suddenly veered right and halted in a hollow with large boulders. ""We'll camp here tonight,"" he declared, surprising the others who expected to travel further. Although Alice was weary, her relatives were willing to carry her. Omas swiftly made a fire with leaves and twigs, using flint and steel. As the fire crackled, Omas pondered whether to stay or leave. Mrs. Ripley sensed his dilemma and urged him to remain, emphasizing the safety of traveling to Stroudsburg. Despite her plea, Omas bid them farewell.

"""Enough, mother,"" Ben whispered, concerned it might anger him more. ""Sit with your head on the rock, lie down on the blanket, and rest in my lap,"" he suggested. The Delaware seemed oblivious, lost in thought by the fire. Ben wanted his mother to rest; she had faced trials all day. He gently brushed her hair back. As she fought sleep, the Delaware suddenly vanished into the darkness. Ben, now in charge, vowed to protect them until sunrise. The campfire faded, leaving only embers.

After a brief discussion, Mrs. Ripley led the group in prayer for their safety on the journey to the distant settlement. They prayed for those left behind, including the absent Omas. Mrs. Ripley made it a daily practice to pray, and Linna, understanding the significance, joined in. Ben optimistically assured they would find water soon, as they set off in the morning. The group stumbled upon a refreshing brook, quenching their thirst and refreshing themselves. Despite the rough terrain, they pressed on, accustomed to hardship. Ben carried supplies and a rifle, showing strength and determination. The heat made the journey challenging, but they found shade in the dense foliage.

Mrs. Ripley halted upon hearing the young Delaware girl's alarming words. It struck her as odd that Linna was the only one to catch the sounds while whispering to her friend, Alice. Despite her young age, Linna's keen hearing had been finely tuned. Mrs. Ripley wisely chose not to argue with her, understanding the importance of caution. She signaled for Ben to stay put as he cautiously ascended the slope, trying to avoid making any noise. As he reached the top, he heard voices nearby, realizing they were from white settlers sitting near a small fire. While relieved they were of his own race, the presence of Jabez Zitner, who had previously caused trouble, raised concerns. Nevertheless, Ben approached them, hoping for a peaceful encounter.|"[""1.

"Alice approached her mother and rested against her knees, her eyes fixed on the men's expressions. Linna, by her side, never looked away from Zitner's displeasing face. ""I plan to guide her well and teach her properly. This morning she prayed with us. Remember, she's young and unfamiliar with Christianity."" Zitner interjected, ""We have Christian Indians at Gnadenhutten. The Moravian missionaries converted many. If they can enlighten adults, can't we hope the same for the young?"" Zitner decided to take the Delaware girl as a hostage for safety. Ben, with a subtle rifle click, stood ready to protect. The departure of Zitner brought relief to the group, as his ill intentions towards the girl were evident.

In the wilderness, Omas guided the group away from danger, avoiding the path of their foes. Ben, wise and observant, used nature's cues to lead them accurately. As thirst plagued them, they found water but worried about food. Linna, mischievous but resourceful, taught Ben to hunt a wild turkey. With a skillful imitation, she lured the bird, impressing Ben with her talent. As night fell, they prepared to camp, grateful for the day's success. Ben stood guard, while Linna's cleverness and hunting skills eased their hunger. The group rested, safe in the wild, thanks to their teamwork and resourcefulness.|"['1.

"Closer now, the sound of footsteps alerted them. ""What would we do without Linna?"" Ben said, embracing her. She had found them food and now warned of danger. Ben's task was not difficult; he cautiously approached the campfire, where three Native Americans were. One added sticks to the fire, another ate, and the third scanned the area. Spotting them as fleeing eastward, the warriors prepared to pursue. Ben noticed one approaching with a torch. The warriors, skilled trackers, could follow them at dawn. Ben led the group, facing obstacles but pressing on, ensuring the safety of the children. Despite weariness, they remained vigilant, aware of the imminent danger."|['1.

""But if you stay up until dawn, you'll be exhausted. You can't stay awake without moving. I'll rest if you wake me at midnight,"" she replied. Ben remembered his mistake from the night before.

The surprising discovery left him feeling worried. He rushed back to the sleeping group, initially planning to wake them and head back into the woods. After a few moments, his mind calmed down. He realized that the Indians, if they followed their trail, would be forced to take a longer route. The disappearance of the three warriors puzzled him. As the group moved cautiously, the mother assured the children that she would pray once they found a safe spot. The fear of the Indians kept their conversations brief and movements cautious. The sight of a fawn made Ben hesitate to shoot, feeling a sense of pity. The group continued cautiously, and a sudden rifle shot reminded them of the lurking danger. Linna swiftly ran towards the source of the shot, leaving the others in awe.|"['1.

I am at a disadvantage in recounting the remarkable meeting between Linna, a young Delaware girl, and three hostile warriors who were pursuing the Ripleys in the wilderness. Linna, with her strong memory, later described the encounter. The fears of the Ripleys were justified as the warriors toyed with them. Linna, knowing her father Omas was a renowned warrior, recognized one of the Senecas, Red Wolf. Red Wolf hesitated to harm the family due to Omas' reputation. The Senecas, however, were determined to capture the Ripleys, disregarding Omas' potential wrath. Despite Linna's keen observation, she did not fully grasp the situation, as the warriors' actions were meant to deceive her. This signaled that Omas had to choose a side, friend or foe, as the Senecas were resolute in their pursuit of the fugitives.|"[""1.

Red Wolf was a member of his group, who had been defeated by the Iroquois. These conquerors were so dominant that they even restricted the Delawares from using guns and insisted they stick to traditional bows and arrows. Red Wolf wanted to gain the favor of Linna and her fierce father. The Delaware child was in a dilemma as she realized Red Wolf's friendship alone might not be enough to secure their safety. While the absent Seneca was devising a harmful plan, Red Wolf and the other warrior were left behind. The Ripleys were sitting on a fallen tree, waiting anxiously. Mrs. Ripley and Ben were exhausted from lack of sleep and food, feeling the weight of their situation. Unbeknownst to them, the single Seneca was stealthily approaching, eventually seizing Ben's rifle without detection. The captives, including the Ripley family, resigned themselves to their fate as they were surrounded by the Senecas, with Linna following closely behind.|['1.

The Delaware family had a touching reunion. Linna, the child, approached her parents solemnly, wiping away tears. Her mother spoke softly in their native tongue, but Linna remained silent. Omas, the cunning Delaware, skillfully navigated a tense moment with the Senecas, ensuring the safety of his friends. He recounted his recent exploits, perhaps embellishing his heroics. Omas expressed his gratitude to the palefaces for protecting Linna and vowed to guide them to safety. The Senecas, moved by Omas's words, pledged not to harm the group and returned Ben's rifle. Omas, torn between violence and peace, eventually left the company to seek further battles. His encounter with the Moravian settlers had left him conflicted, torn between his warrior nature and the teachings of the missionaries.|"['1.
