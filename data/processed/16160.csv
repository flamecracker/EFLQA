Egypt is a land where waiting and time wastage are common. Traveling by train to see ruins often involves delays, with hours idled away due to late trains. Even crossing the Nile in a boat can take longer than needed. Excursion steamers might get stuck on sandbanks for hours. Officials traveling spend much time waiting, allowing for contemplation. These dull moments can be utilized by jotting down notes, which can later be expanded into articles or papers. This book comprises twelve chapters on Ancient Egypt, some previously published in magazines. The archaeologist's work, though often seen as unprofitable, holds value in preserving ancient history and culture. Archaeology, the study of ancient history and artifacts, provides insights into past civilizations, making it relevant and valuable even in modern times.|"['1.

Every country is likely to experience a period of significant change, known as a national convulsion. History shows us that after such upheavals, there is often a period of stagnation in industry and art. This lull is typically overcome not by adopting foreign ideas but by embracing the early traditions of the nation. It is crucial for individuals to engage with these traditions to ensure their continuity through upheavals and to revive them when necessary. Reviving interest in the nation's best artistic and industrial periods can be a rewarding task in the long term. This revival is only achievable through the study of the past, primarily through archaeology, which helps set standards for quality workmanship and beauty. By appreciating and preserving the best of the past, individuals contribute to the creation of a period in their lifetime that future generations will admire.|"['1.

Patriotism is the love for the progress and well-being of the entire nation, regardless of the circumstances under which this progress occurs. A true patriot does not favor self-government or external control blindly but considers what is best for the country based on historical lessons. History guides patriots on the right path by showing what is beneficial for the nation and how much they can strive for.

Living in isolation can lead to eccentric behavior. When reintegrating into society, these eccentricities can be misunderstood as signs of madness. Similarly, solely focusing on the present can also result in eccentricity. Just as a recluse needs social interaction for mental health, those living in the present should also reflect on the past to maintain balance. History, as Heraclitus suggests, provides a common thread connecting us to the wisdom of the world. Forgetting the past is a common human flaw; experiences quickly fade into oblivion. By embracing history, we honor the past, gain insight into the present, and shape a better future. Balancing the past with the present is essential for personal growth and understanding our place in the world.|['1.

Ancient Egypt's history holds relevance to modern times, despite changes in language and customs. Egyptology's study extends to the Muhammedan invasion, merging into Arabic history, making it a continuous science. The anthropological continuity between ancient and modern Egyptians is unique, unlike other nations. Egyptian towns retain their hieroglyphic names, showing the lasting impact of ancient language. Pagan beliefs, like the worship of old gods, still exist in modern practices. For example, the god Min, associated with crops, is represented in fields today. Superstitions like burning jackal hair for protection and keeping snakes as household gods persist. Ancient rituals, such as placing scarabs in baths, continue.

The ancient magic of Egypt is still widely practiced, and many of the formulas used nowadays are familiar to Egyptologists. The Egyptian world is heavily influenced by magic, inhabited by spirits, demons, and djins. Educated individuals with government roles, dressed in European attire, recount miraculous encounters with djins. A gentleman in a high administrative position shared how his cousin transformed into a cat at night, roaming the town. Peasants believe even more extraordinary tales. The village headman of Chaghb filed a complaint against a devil causing chaos, throwing oil lamps and stones. Spirits of the deceased also haunt the living, causing harm. Modern customs in Egypt show similarities to ancient days, from house structures to daily activities. Barber shops and mourning rituals resemble scenes from ancient tomb paintings. Village celebrations mirror ancient festivities, with traditional songs, dances, and food.

As the traveler ventures into the fields, they witness the ground divided into small squares for irrigation, a technique passed down from prehistoric farmers. The plough maintains its traditional shape, and the _shadoof_, a water-hoist, is diligently operated as it has been for millennia. Threshing and winnowing are carried out in methods depicted on ancient monuments, while sowing and reaping techniques remain unchanged. Along the embanked roads, figures of men, cattle, and donkeys pass by, reminiscent of the straight rows seen in historical depictions. Symbols like the vulture goddess Nekheb and the hawk Horus fly overhead, while hieroglyphs come to life, with the owl, eagle, and other signs moving about. The connection between ancient and modern Egyptians is evident, with similarities in their interactions with foreign powers, much like in recent history. Egypt's historical relations with Syria and Palestine reveal a consistent effort to maintain these regions as vassal states, a practice dating back to the early Pharaohs. The Egyptians have a long history of involvement in Syria, with various Pharaohs engaging in conflicts and establishing control over the region, as seen in the expeditions and interactions documented in ancient texts and artifacts.|"['1.

"During the rule of the Hyksos dynasties in Egypt, Pharaoh Khyan, believed to have Semitic roots, extended his empire from Baghdad to the Sudan with the help of foreign troops. The Hyksos kings, eager to be called ""Pharaohs,"" showcased Egypt's dominance in the eastern Mediterranean. Under Dynasty XVIII, Pharaohs like Ahmosis I, Amenhotep I, and Thutmosis III expanded Egyptian influence, conquering territories up to the Euphrates. Thutmosis III led numerous successful campaigns into Syria, solidifying Egypt's power. Successors like Amenhotep II, Thutmosis IV, and Amenhotep III maintained control over Syria. Rameses II faced challenges from the Hittites in North Syria, while Merenptah and Rameses III continued to battle for control.

In ancient times, King Ptolemy of Egypt embarked on a grand campaign into Asia, conquering vast territories and making monarchs his subjects. Later, Ptolemy VII became King of Syria, but the kingdom slipped from his grasp with the arrival of the Romans. Over the centuries, Egypt and Syria shared a close connection, often part of the same empire. The narrative continued through various rulers and dynasties, with Egypt's influence extending into Asia. The text hints at Egypt's potential reconquest of Syria, a historical trend spanning thousands of years. Despite a temporary respite, the underlying geopolitical dynamics persist, raising questions about Egypt's future expansion.

The history of Egypt's north-western frontier reveals a long-standing struggle against invaders from North Africa. From the Libyans in ancient times to the Senussi fraternity in more recent history, Egypt has faced threats from the west. The oasis of Siwa served as a gateway for communication with Tripoli and Tunis, making it vulnerable to outbreaks like cholera. Throughout the centuries, Egyptian rulers have battled to defend against incursions, with notable conflicts during the reigns of Amenemhat I, Amenhotep I, Rameses II, and others. The frontier remained a point of contention even into Arabic times, with occasional disturbances requiring military intervention. The lesson from this history is clear: Egypt's north-western border has always been exposed to potential invasions, making it a historic point of conflict and a reminder of the nation's imperial past.|"[""1.

In ancient times, Egypt was a formidable naval power, with a history of naval battles and ships that patrolled the Mediterranean and the east coast of Africa. Despite its current focus on the Nile, Egypt's past as a sea power is significant. The Egyptian navy once had massive warships and advanced vessels built by Pharaohs like Ptolemy Philopator. These ships were equipped with state rooms, bath-rooms, libraries, and even astronomical observatories. The history of Egypt's naval prowess, dating back thousands of years, contrasts with England's maritime development, which began much later. The study of history, particularly in relation to politics, provides valuable insights into a nation's future.

The Egyptologist, in his arrogant manner, dismisses modern politics as fleeting, focusing solely on ancient relics. Yet, these relics are more than artifacts; they are the living school-books of a nation. The Egyptian government spends vast sums preserving these treasures, not for tourism or ethics, but as a guide to their past and future. The archæologist's work is crucial, but the true purpose is often lost in academic discussions. The public sees it as mental gymnastics, missing the essence of the research. The archæologist's life in a museum is surrounded by decaying objects, but his dreams are filled with the vibrant history these relics once held. Despite the scholarly jargon, sharing discoveries is vital, even if done in ancient Greek to stand out.|"['1.

The archaeologist's work is often likened to the dust he sifts through, a paradoxical notion. Despite expectations of uncovering tales like old wine to excite the senses, archaeology is more about precise reconstructions of the past. The archaeologist delves into the state secrets of kings and the rich history of nations, hearing tales of ancient heroes and battles. While one might imagine a crowd of adventurous souls hanging on his every word, the reality is different. At a lecture in a small town, the audience is a motley crew - a melancholy lady, a club-footed man, and an elderly woman discussing the pelvis of a mastodon. The archaeologist's stories may not draw the glamorous and bold but rather a diverse group seeking knowledge and a connection to the past.|"['1.

"The archaeologist is a secret-keeper of the past, holding the key to understanding ancient artifacts. While one might expect the public to desire accurate models or detailed descriptions of these relics, they often prefer to see the objects in their worn and corroded state. This preference for the raw, unaltered artifacts can sometimes hinder the archaeologist's role as an interpreter of history. Despite this, the archaeologist's duty remains crucial in preserving the richness and majesty of bygone eras for the present. By showcasing replicas and facsimiles, these experts bring the past to life in a more accessible and engaging way for modern audiences.

Death is a mysterious force that casts a shadow over life. It interrupts our joy and halts our pleasures. However, delving into the past can lessen the fear of life's end. History reveals that many have faced death bravely, turning it into an adventure. The study of archaeology, particularly Egyptology, shows us that death can be viewed as a gateway to a new and possibly joyful existence. The ancient Egyptians saw death as a transition to a heavenly realm, where life continues in a different form. Despite the solemnity often associated with death, the past is filled with stories of individuals who embraced their fate with courage and even humor. Archaeologists, through their studies, offer us insights into the lives of those who came before us, showing that death is not the end but a part of a greater journey.|"['1.

"Ancient Egyptians were often misunderstood as somber and serious, but evidence reveals they were actually a vibrant and cheerful people. They were known for their festive and light-hearted nature, enjoying dancing and celebrations.

Imhotep, the wise thinker from around 3000 B.C., told his followers to cherish life as the homes of the deceased crumble and are forgotten. He urged them to be happy while they could. Ancient Egyptian peasants were carefree and sang while working. A love song from a girl to her lover, sung while she trapped wild ducks, shows the tenderness and sweetness of their culture.

"The verse ""The breath of thy nostrils alone Is that which maketh my heart to live. I found thee: God grant thee to me For ever and ever."" evokes a sense of longing and devotion. It is painful to imagine these words coming from what is now a lifeless mummy, possibly on display in a museum or scattered in ruins. Mummies, despite their preservation, are devoid of life. To truly understand these verses, one must separate them from the context of mummies and ancient tombs. Picture instead the vibrant Egyptian fields where wild ducks call out and a songstress moves gracefully, much like the Shulamite of King Solomon's era. Ancient Egyptians embraced life, with priests having families and enjoying festivities. Asceticism was foreign to them until later periods.

The High Priest equipped Wenamon for his journey with money, letters for Egyptian and Syrian leaders, and a sacred image of Amon-Ra named Amon-of-the-Road. Wenamon commenced his trip from El Hibeh, an ancient Egyptian capital, aboard a boat down the Nile towards Tanis, about 200 miles away. Upon reaching Tanis, he delivered the letters to Nesubanebded, who arranged for Wenamon to sail with a Syrian captain named Mengebet towards the Lebanese coast. Despite a smooth voyage across the Mediterranean, Wenamon faced anxiety due to a robbery by a Syrian sailor in the city of Dor. The stolen items included gold and silver, leaving Wenamon distressed. He sought help from King Bedel, who listened to his plea and promised to investigate the theft.|['1.

The King of Dor politely responded to Wenamon's complaint, expressing ignorance of the thief's identity. The king offered to help if the thief was from his land but pointed out that the thief came from Wenamon's ship. Despite promising to find the thief, Wenamon's patience wore thin after nine days of waiting. He decided to leave, but the ship's captain urged him to return to the king. Upon his return, Wenamon demanded his money back but was silenced by the king. Wenamon then set sail for Tyre, arriving penniless. Continuing his journey, he encountered Sicilian merchants and devised a plan to take some of their money, believing it rightfully belonged to him due to his earlier theft.

The Prince of Byblos was informed about the theft, and upon hearing of the ship's arrival, he promptly ordered the captain to leave his harbor. Wenamon, feeling hopeless, sought passage on another ship back to Egypt but received no clear response from the prince. For days, Wenamon's ship remained anchored as he pondered his next move. Despite daily orders to leave, the authorities hesitated to use force against him. Wenamon and Mengebet spread news of Amon-of-the-Road's power, hoping to sway the city. Eventually, Wenamon decided to sneak away with the image under his arm. However, he was stopped by the harbor-master and police. Surprisingly, he was told to stay near the prince until morning. The harbor-master had been instructed to detain Wenamon due to a divine command received by the prince's companion.

This incident stirred unknown emotions in Wenamon. A courtier whispered to Wenamon, ""The shadow of Pharaoh falls on you,"" followed by a jab in the ribs. Annoyed, the prince defended Wenamon. The prince then told Wenamon not to fear the sea, hinting that he might keep Wenamon in Byblos until all dues were paid. The prince mentioned past envoys who spent years in Byblos and died there.

The most skilled workers were chosen to excavate a chamber, and the excavator, many years back, toiled under the weight of fame and an air of mystery etched on his sunburnt face. The memory vividly recalls the letter sent home that week, hinting at a significant discovery on the horizon. The image of the desert sand where the laborers sweated remains clear. Yet, hopes were dashed when no tomb entrance was found in that part of the site. The focus shifted to the north end, where men dug deeper until they hit rock, revealing a shaft leading into the earth. The royal tomb of Pharaoh Senusert III was finally uncovered. Excitement filled the days, but concerns arose about robbers trying to infiltrate the tomb. After a brief scuffle, the tomb was secured, and no robbers had entered. A long night watch followed, leading to the arrest of some culprits. The tomb extended deep into the cliff, culminating in the discovery of the empty royal sarcophagus. This marked the end of an intense season of work.|['1. What was the initial focus of the excavation at the archaeological site?\nA. The south end\nB. The east end\nC. The west end\nD.

In the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, Mr. Theodore M. Davis conducted excavations in collaboration with the Egyptian Government's Department of Antiquities. As an official of the Department, I witnessed the remarkable discovery of the tomb of Yuaa and Tuau, parents of Queen Tiy. When the tomb entrance was cleared, a passage led to a chamber filled with treasures from over three thousand years ago. The room was like a time capsule, with preserved wooden chairs adorned with gold, alabaster vases, and even a liquid substance still unspoiled. The chamber also contained a chariot, beds with gold designs, and magical figures believed to aid Prince Yuaa in the afterlife. The artifacts gleamed with gold, untouched by time, offering a glimpse into ancient Egyptian life.|"[""1. What was the main focus of Mr. Theodore M.

The eyes wandered around the room, but always returned to the two gilded coffins, as if the occupants were peacefully asleep. The electric lamps above them gave the illusion that they might wake any moment. The stern face of the old man drew attention, shifting focus from the wealth to the sleeping figure. The discovery was unsettling, bringing the past vividly into the present. The work began to catalog the antiquities, with days of heavy labor and cold nights at the tomb's entrance. The excavation revealed intact tombs, offering a glimpse into ancient Theban life. The passage led to a wooden door sealed with clay, seemingly untouched by time. The artifacts inside hinted at a recent burial, contrasting with the reality of standing in a tomb untouched for over three millennia.|"['1.

Before we could proceed further, many flashlight photos had to be taken, and drawings of the doorway had to be made. A panel of the woodwork was removed with a fret-saw to avoid damaging the lock and seal. Finally, the way into the tomb-chamber was open. Stepping through the door frame, we found ourselves in a clear space with funeral furniture all around. On the left, the coffins of the noble and his wife loomed large. Everything looked new and undecayed, neatly arranged. The gravel on the floor was smooth, not a speck of dust in sight. Over the large coffin, a pall of fine linen was laid. Near it, a wooden pedestal with a copper dish containing ashes of incense. Tables held cakes of bread, onions, and fruit. Bronze vessels for drinks were scattered around. The chamber was filled with flowers, with a ceremonial wig and delicate vases in chests. The coffins were hidden, and nothing could be touched until records were made. Despite precautions, illegal excavation continues, with tragic consequences like a native family's demise in a tomb.|"['1.

"The Egyptian peasants strongly believe in the power of spirit creatures. A native seeking hidden treasure in the desert sacrificed a lamb each night to appease the _djin_ believed to guard it. However, they show no superstition about ancient tombs, often looting them. This has led to many desecrated graves, making scientific excavations fruitless. In 1907, excavations in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings revealed a tomb entrance from the XVIIIth Dynasty. The Valley, behind Thebes, holds tombs of Pharaohs from the XVIIIth to the XXth Dynasties. The new tomb entrance led to a chamber with a shrine in ruins.

During the exploration of an ancient tomb, archaeologists discovered a coffin believed to belong to Queen Tiy, the mother of Pharaoh Akhnaton. However, upon further examination by Dr. Elliot Smith, it was revealed that the bones found in the coffin were actually those of a young man around twenty-eight years old, leading to the conclusion that they belonged to Akhnaton himself. This surprising discovery shed new light on the history of this extraordinary Pharaoh. Akhnaton was known for his reign characterized by the introduction of Syrian influences into Egypt, as he and Queen Tiy brought luxuries from Asia to the Nile Valley. The reign of Akhnaton and Queen Tiy marked a period of significant cultural exchange between Egypt and the surrounding regions.|"['1.

"Queen Tiy had many children with the King, but it wasn't until they had ruled for over twenty years that a son and heir named Amenhotep, later changed to Akhnaton, was born. It is believed he was born in the grand royal palace in Thebes, near the desert and western hills. The palace was vast and beautifully decorated with paintings of animals. The King had even created a pleasure lake for the Queen, surrounded by Asian trees. Akhnaton was born into a lavish and luxurious environment, surrounded by music and golden wine cups. The ancient priesthood of Amon-Ra, however, viewed the birth of this new prince with skepticism, as he was destined to challenge their traditional beliefs. The priests were conservative and proud, resistant to changes in religious practices. The worship of Aton, a sun god from Syria, irritated the priests of Amon-Ra, as it brought about freethinking and philosophical ideas that challenged the strict doctrines they upheld. Queen Tiy likely played a significant role in this shift towards a new religious movement, influenced by her father who was a priest of the Egyptian god Min. King Amenhotep III, known as the ""Magnificent,"" seemed to have a less dominant role in the changes occurring during this time, possibly due to illness or insanity in his later years.

"The young Pharaoh, guided by Tiy, declared Aton as the supreme god and appointed himself as the chief priest. He initiated the construction of a temple for Aton at Karnak. However, the grandeur of the temple was overshadowed by the existing structures dedicated to the older gods. Thebes, where Amon had been worshipped for centuries, opposed the new religion fiercely. Facing resistance, the Pharaoh decided to abandon Thebes and establish a new capital at El Amarna. The city, named ""Horizon of Aton,"" was swiftly built with a magnificent palace, temple, villas, and streets. Akhnaton aimed to focus on his religion and live within the confines of El Amarna, akin to the Pope in the Vatican.

During ancient times, an artist serving Queen Tiy was among the first to break free from traditional art styles, likely influenced by the queen. However, King Akhnaton was the true pioneer of the radical art shift, with the new school crediting their teachings to him. This innovative art, while not conventionally beautiful, focused on originality over traditional aesthetics. The King's preference for light-heartedness led to vibrant colors and decorations in the palace, creating a unique atmosphere. The nobles of the King's Court made sacrifices to move to the new capital, with their abandoned estates and unfinished tombs in Thebes. The King generously built houses and tombs for them. The walls of these tombs hold valuable insights into the teachings of this remarkable young ruler, including hymns to Aton, showcasing the beauty and power of the sun.|"[""1.

Queen Tiy, the mother of Pharaoh Akhnaton, passed away and was laid to rest in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings near Thebes. Akhnaton, despite preaching love and truth, fiercely opposed the old gods' priesthoods. He ordered the erasure of the name of Amon from temple walls and even erased his own father's name, Amenhotep III. Akhnaton focused on his new religion, appointing Merira as the high priest of Aton. While Akhnaton promoted peace, his generals in Asia Minor struggled to maintain the Egyptian Empire. The fall of the empire was marked by the Amorites' conquests in Syria, pleading for aid that never came. The once powerful Egyptian Empire faced challenges as its territories were under siege, seeking support that was not forthcoming from Akhnaton, preoccupied with his religious pursuits.|"[""1.

City after city was lost, and the empire, once hard-won, slipped away from the Egyptians. Akhnaton, the Pharaoh, seemed unaware of the gravity of the situation in Asia Minor. Some chieftains, not openly in rebellion, sent misleading messages claiming all was well. These false reports, coupled with regular tribute payments, deceived Akhnaton. The Asiatic princes, plotting rebellion, hoodwinked the Pharaoh. Akhnaton's vision of a unified empire under one religion shattered. When tribute ceased and refugees revealed the truth, Akhnaton, only 28, faced despair. With no male heir, his religious revolution failed. Akhnaton's death swiftly followed, and his legacy tarnished. His body, later moved, faced erasure from history, a tragic end to a once-promising reign.|"['1.

In the past chapter, an important discovery was made that is of great interest to many. The life story of Akhnaton, filled with both romance and tragedy, adds valuable knowledge to what we already know. Another significant find was the tomb of Horemheb, discovered by the same explorer, Mr. Davis, in 1908, which connects to the previous chapter. After Akhnaton, Smenkhkara and then Tutankhamon succeeded him briefly. Chaos ensued in Egypt due to Akhnaton's revolution and the short reigns of the subsequent kings. Horemheb, a wise ruler, emerged at a critical time, restoring order and paving the way for the prosperous reigns of Rameses I, Sety I, and Rameses II.

During the ancient period in Egypt, Horemheb, a noble who later became Pharaoh, had a tomb at Sakkâra near the pyramids of the old kings. Fragments of this tomb can be seen in museums today. In one scene, Horemheb is depicted with a king, likely Akhnaton, although Horemheb references the god Amon, which went against Akhnaton's beliefs. Horemheb sympathized with Akhnaton's artistic revolution but also expressed ideas contrary to his beliefs. Horemheb, a military leader, was discontent with Akhnaton's neglect of the Syrian provinces, leading to unrest. He later led a campaign against rebels during Tutankhamon's reign, restoring order to Egypt. Horemheb was praised for his just rule and efforts to bring prosperity back to the country.|"[""1.

After King Tutankhamon's death, there was a debate about who would succeed him. Ay, a noble who had been close to Akhnaton, and Horemheb, a candidate favored by many, were considered. Ay, known for his ability to bridge religious divides, ultimately claimed the throne. However, Ay's reign was short-lived as the priests of Amon regained power. Horemheb, a strong and energetic leader, was chosen to marry Princess Mutnezem and become Pharaoh. He was welcomed with grand celebrations and married the princess on the same day. Horemheb, known for his reorganization efforts, quickly restored temples and adopted a friendly stance towards the Amon party. He aimed to bring Egypt back to its traditional practices and even appointed a former Aton worshipper as High Priest of Ra. The neglected temples of Aton were repurposed for the worship of other gods, symbolizing a return to normalcy in Egypt.|"[""1.

The restoration process under Horemheb was gradual and peaceful, showing his diplomatic skills. He balanced between Amon and Aton worshipers, restoring order without persecution. Horemheb's simplicity, tolerance, and strong leadership earned him respect. He held public audiences, knowing each person's name, leaving them joyful. He sailed the Nile extensively, improving Egypt and fighting oppression. His laws aimed to protect the people's interests. For instance, he punished officials who stole farmers' boats and slaves, ensuring fair tax collection. Horemheb's reign was marked by justice and integrity, combating corruption and lawlessness.

In ancient Egypt, King Horemheb made significant reforms to ensure justice and order in the land. He appointed high-standing judges to enforce laws against corrupt officials, demonstrating a commitment to fair governance. The King also focused on strengthening the army and successfully led military expeditions against neighboring tribes. Despite his military successes, Horemheb prioritized internal stability over further conquests, aiming to consolidate Egypt's power before expanding. His reign marked a return to traditional religious practices, restoring worship to the old gods. Horemheb's legacy as a wise ruler and administrator is evident in the improvements he made during his rule. His tomb, discovered in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings, stands as a testament to his enduring impact on Egyptian history.|"['1.

Exploring an ancient tomb can be an exciting yet challenging adventure. A group of explorers, including Mr. Davis, Mr. Ayrton, Mr. Harold Jones, Mr. Max Dalison, and another individual, ventured into a tomb filled with debris and rubble. They had to crawl through narrow corridors and descend steep angles to uncover hidden passages. The tomb was adorned with elaborate paintings and inscriptions depicting ancient gods and scenes. As they navigated through the tomb, they encountered a large rectangular well filled with debris, which led them to a pillared hall with crumbling pillars and stunning artwork. The explorers discovered a pink-granite sarcophagus with intricate inscriptions and figures of Isis and Nephthys. Upon opening the sarcophagus, they found only bones and wooden statues of gods beneath it. This unique burial arrangement showcased the reverence for the deceased king. The explorers marveled at the well-preserved paintings and the awe-inspiring history that surrounded them in the tomb.|['1.

In every direction, broken figures of the gods lay scattered, with two defaced wooden statues of the king beside the sarcophagus. Unlike the lavish furniture found in mortal tombs, the Pharaoh's sepulchre held only remnants of garlands and dead flowers. Skulls and bones in small chambers hinted at the queen's presence. The tomb's atmosphere was stifling, with electric lamps casting eerie light on the desecrated gods and toppled statues. Exiting the tomb, the contrast between the dark interior and the bright sunlight emphasized the decay within. The scene of destruction evoked reflections on the transient nature of life and the forgotten battles of the past. The experience of exploring such ancient tombs is indescribable, with shadows, echoes, and a sense of time's vastness enveloping the visitor.|"[""1.

"Horemheb, an ancient Egyptian ruler, might have heard a song composed in his palace at Thebes. Did he imagine his tomb crumbling and his bones forgotten? The song warns against mocking stone idols, as they represent unchanging intent. The text foretells the English influence in Egypt, with the ""sleepless rock"" watching over time. Thebes, Egypt's former capital, boasts vast temple ruins and tombs. Locals profit from selling ancient artifacts, though now deemed thieves by the government.

The theft of ancient artifacts discovered during approved excavations is a common type of robbery. It is challenging for the supervisor to monitor the workers closely enough to prevent them from taking small items they find. A young girl tending to her father's livestock near the site may be receiving these stolen objects. Digging for antiquities in authorized excavations is more profitable than operating the water-hoist, a typical peasant job. The routine of the water-hoist is dull, while searching for artifacts in the ground is always intriguing. The fear of losing discovered artifacts to foreign collectors drives some locals to keep what they find. The vandalism of historic monuments is condemned by many, including Egyptians who donated to protect tombs. Damage to public monuments is seen as unfair play and can stem from revenge or spite. Punishing offenders can lead to retaliation on the monuments themselves. Dealing in stolen antiquities is considered an honorable profession by some, making it difficult to combat this illicit trade.|['1.

The sale of small ancient items to travelers on public roads is not allowed, except in specific areas. However, it can be done discreetly with a little caution. People passing by, including men, boys, and even young girls, may look at you closely. If they think you might be interested, they will take out a small object from their clothes to sell. While traveling, you might encounter a young man who seems noble, but he offers to sell you a scarab for a price. Years ago, a large inscribed stone was stolen from a temple and sold to a man who traded in such items. The stone was hidden in a sack of grain and hidden in a friend's house. The police searched the house but found nothing. Later, a man was spotted leaving the house with a heavy sack, likely containing the stolen stone.|"['1.

Recently, a young man accused his father of stealing a statuette. The son claimed his father took it, but the father denied it. When the son's brother was questioned, it seemed the father might be guilty. However, the brother explained that the son asked the father for money, but he refused. The son believed he was owed the money and took it from his father's house. The father found out and retrieved the money. In retaliation, the son falsely accused his father. Sometimes, appearances can be deceiving, like a lady who unknowingly bought a stolen scarab from a boy claiming honesty.

In certain archaeological sites, workers are rewarded for each ancient item they discover, preventing dealers from outbidding. This practice can be costly for archaeologists, who may pay £10 or £20 daily. However, some workers may bring artifacts from far and wide to sell. Despite its flaws, this system is deemed successful. In government excavations, overseers monitor minor finds, reserving rewards for significant discoveries. For instance, a worker was paid £14 for finding a gold hawk's head. He debated whether to buy a wife or a cow with the money. Advised to choose the cow, he later squandered his earnings. In another case, a man buried his £400 reward, which his sons later searched for in vain.

The region of Lower Nubia is situated between the First and Second Cataracts of the Nile. Aswan, a town known for its historical significance and now a popular winter destination for Europeans and Americans, is located a few miles below the First Cataract. Two hundred miles further south, at the base of the Second Cataract, lies Wady Halfa. The small town of Derr, nestled among palm trees halfway between Aswan and Wady Halfa, houses the province's sole police station. The land is mostly barren, with only a narrow strip of cultivation along the river, bordered by desert. The scenery is rugged and impressive, with rocky hills towering above the riverbanks. The local population, mainly women, engage in agricultural work and village activities.

When discussing important matters, it is crucial to approach them with a clear mind and balanced thinking. Just as excessive drinking can cloud judgment, so can extreme opinions and criticisms. Observing the scene on a Saturday night in the Old Kent Road, where many seem intoxicated, prompts us to consider the intoxication of the mind caused by immoderate thoughts. It is vital to maintain sobriety in our opinions, akin to critical teetotalism, to ensure our views are rational and not distorted. Take, for instance, the case of Philae and the Lower Nubian temples affected by the construction of a dam. While some argue the flooding benefits the island temple, others call for extreme measures against the engineers. Both views are immoderate. Engineers carefully selected the dam site to minimize damage to modern interests, including few cultivated fields and a small population. They concluded that the temples would not be significantly harmed by the flooding, as they would only be submerged for five months each year. The temples would remain intact for the rest of the year. When considering the administrative and financial aspects, it was a reasonable decision to proceed with the dam construction. Experts assure that any minor damages can be repaired during the dry months. The impact of water on the temple's reliefs and inscriptions is minimal, as evidenced by similar stone structures along the Nile that have maintained their sharp hieroglyphs despite being submerged for centuries. Thus, the temples at Philae are expected to withstand the flooding without significant|"['1. What is the main idea of the text passage?\nA. The importance of excessive drinking\nB.

"The remains of color on some reliefs at Philae will soon vanish, with little archaeological impact. However, the loss of color on the column capitals in the Hall of Isis would be a significant artistic loss. Suggestions include replacing the capitals with dummies or making careful facsimile copies. While the flooding of Philae is regrettable artistically and sentimentally, practical considerations are crucial. Visitors can see the ruins in autumn. Water in temples is not novel, and trees once surrounded Philae. The objections to the flooding are minimal. Despite some sorrow, there is no real cause for distress. The objections are overshadowed by the necessity of the dam. The closure of Philae for part of the year is a regrettable but necessary measure.

A lot has been discussed about the ancient carvings on the granite rocks near the First Cataract, many of which hold significant historical value. While quarrying for the dam, concerns were raised that these inscriptions might be destroyed. However, apart from one damaged inscription during preliminary stone testing, all hieroglyphs have been safeguarded. The Department of Antiquities, with help from the dam-building department, ensured the protection of these relics. Several ruins, like the Philae temples, will be partially submerged. Yet, efforts to preserve sites like the temple of Kalabsheh have been successful. The temple of Dendur will face partial flooding, but repairs have been made. The fortress of Koshtamneh will suffer damage, but detailed records have been kept. The temple of Maharraka, once in ruins, has been rebuilt to withstand water pressure.

To complete the works in Lower Nubia, a museum in Aswan is proposed to display the discovered antiquities. The museum would showcase objects representing the arts, crafts, and industries of Lower Nubia throughout its history. Funding for this project is uncertain, but establishing such a museum would be highly beneficial. In 1907, the monuments in Lower Nubia were in poor condition, with temples falling apart and cemeteries being looted. However, significant improvements have been made since then. The attention brought by the flooding of the area led to the restoration and protection of these ancient sites. The English and Egyptian officials allocated substantial funds for monument preservation, demonstrating a commitment to safeguarding historical relics. The role of archaeologists in the field versus those in museums is discussed, highlighting the importance of on-site research and the changing perceptions of archaeologists over time.|['1.

Egyptologists have three main reasons to visit Egypt often. Firstly, studying archaeology in the open air is healthy and inspiring. Working in the Egyptian desert or swimming in the cool Nile boosts physical health and invigorates the mind more than studying in a museum. Living in the open toughens the body and prepares it for work, unlike the comfort of city life. Some archaeologists live a rougher life to avoid becoming too comfortable. Roughing it means living without certain luxuries, like camping outdoors and skipping some comforts of civilization. This kind of lifestyle benefits health and ensures that work is done by healthy individuals. It's important for scholars to pay attention to their physical health, especially since indoor work can weaken the body. By embracing a more active lifestyle, archaeologists can dispel the misconception that they are weak or eccentric individuals.|"['1.

A museum serves three main purposes. Firstly, it acts as a safe haven for stray objects that may otherwise be lost or destroyed. Curators should only acquire items that are at risk of disappearing. Secondly, a museum is a repository for historical documents like papyri and ostraca, functioning as a public library for educational expansion. Lastly, museums are permanent exhibitions for public enlightenment and student learning. Instead of solely focusing on obtaining original antiquities, museums should also include replicas, models, and facsimiles for educational purposes. Curators should prioritize preserving antiquities in their original locations whenever possible. The primary goal is not to amass a large collection of valuable artifacts but to ensure the preservation and accessibility of historical objects for study and public benefit.|['1.

The actions of Western museums in acquiring artifacts from Egypt have led to the destruction and loss of valuable historical pieces. Robbers have exploited this demand, causing irreparable damage to ancient tombs and monuments. The relics, like the relief of Queen Tiy, have been looted, defaced, and sold to museums worldwide. The practice of purchasing stolen artifacts perpetuates this cycle of theft and destruction. Although curators argue that acquiring these pieces prevents them from falling into the wrong hands, it ultimately incentivizes further plundering. The only sustainable solution lies in promoting ethical practices by encouraging scholars and enthusiasts to study and appreciate Egyptian history firsthand in its natural setting. This approach fosters a deeper respect for the country's heritage and discourages the illicit trade of antiquities.|"['1.

In Egypt, residents interested in archaeology may view museums with horror and hostility towards the museum spirit. While curators display artifacts as distant treasures, locals see them as stolen pieces of their heritage. European travelers once depicted Egypt as a barbaric land, with monuments at the mercy of Bedouins. However, modern Egypt is well-guarded, with strict measures to protect its ancient sites. Residents now view Egypt as accessible and secure, shifting their perspectives. Students of archaeology are urged to experience Egypt firsthand to understand its culture fully. Book knowledge alone may lead to biased interpretations. Practical experience in the field is essential for accurate research. Studying ancient civilizations requires an understanding of modern customs and conditions. Active engagement with a country's present is crucial for interpreting its past accurately.|"['1.

Theodore Roosevelt, in his Oxford lecture, emphasized the importance of not just collecting facts but using them to become a master in history. A student should aim to be a master who utilizes the gathered material effectively. An archaeologist must awaken the past, not just compile data. To accurately portray historical events, one must have a deep understanding of the country's conditions. Imagination must be controlled by knowledge to avoid inaccuracies, like a water-hoist on a hillside in Egypt. The historic imagination, combined with accurate knowledge, is crucial for telling the story of the past. It is essential for archaeologists to immerse themselves in the culture and environment of the subject they are studying to avoid misconceptions and inaccuracies.|"['1.
