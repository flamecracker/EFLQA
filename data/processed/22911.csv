Once upon a time, four blind men sat by the roadside and felt an elephant pass by. Each man touched a different part of the elephant - one felt the broad side, another a leg, the third a tusk, and the fourth the tail. This story illustrates how incomplete information can lead to misunderstandings, much like how vague geography teachings can leave children with incorrect ideas about the world around them. This book aims to change that by encouraging children to explore their immediate surroundings using their senses. By focusing on what they can touch, see, and experience firsthand, children can build a solid foundation of knowledge that will later help them understand larger geographical concepts accurately and with more depth.|"[""1.

This educational book is based on the author's real experiences observing students in the classroom while they learn about geography. The author found that students struggled with broader geographical concepts because they lacked a solid understanding of their own local geography. To address this issue, the author collected and organized relevant material to help teachers present the subject more effectively. By using this material, teachers found it easier to engage students in learning about the earth as a whole, sparking unexpected interest among the children. The book provides valuable suggestions rather than just presenting geographical facts, aiming to guide students on how to gather, classify, and study information. It encourages children to explore map study based on their own experiences, starting with familiar surroundings like their school, streets, and town before delving into broader geographical topics. The book emphasizes progressing from the known to the unknown and highlights the importance of understanding one's immediate environment before exploring the wider world.|"['1.

Imagine drawing a map of your school's surroundings. Start by sketching the school lot and the street it sits on. If you live in a town, add the nearby streets and, continuing, draw the path to your home. Mark your home with a cross. Then, trace a dotted line from your house to school to show your route. Include a circle for the grocery store or bakery you pass. Place a large dot for the nearest store to school and draw a dotted line to show how you'd get there if sent by your teacher.

Among the various structures found in towns and rural areas, houses hold a crucial role. The significance of having a comfortable and spacious home surpasses that of grand or beautiful buildings. A good residence must provide ample space for the entire family, along with sufficient light, fresh air, sunlight, and water. It should feature a sturdy roof to shield against harsh weather conditions and effective heating for cold winters. Additionally, homes should include elements that promote the well-being and happiness of the family. Libraries and museums are also valuable sources of education. Libraries serve as homes to friendly teachers who impart knowledge and wisdom. Museums display a diverse array of fascinating objects like artwork, artifacts, and historical items. Hospitals play a vital role in caring for the sick who cannot be tended to at home. Doctors and nurses work tirelessly to restore health. Town Halls, common in most towns, serve various functions like housing the mayor's office. These structures may boast unique architectural elements like towers or domes.|"['1.

"In many places, workers face crowded and uncomfortable conditions with impure air that makes them tired and sick. It's important to observe what makes workers comfortable and healthy in good stores or factories. Historic buildings, like the magnificent Capitol in Washington, built long ago with white marble, are admired by Americans. In Philadelphia, there's Independence Hall with the Liberty Bell, and Boston boasts the old Faneuil Hall where great Americans spoke.

The black people have admirable qualities in their character. Even when they were enslaved, they often developed deep affection for their owners, willing to sacrifice anything, even their lives, for them. It's crucial to remember that both black and white individuals were created by God. Fair individuals strive to treat everyone with honesty, kindness, and fairness. The Chinese immigrants in our nation are hardworking and peaceful, mainly working diligently in laundries and businesses. Sadly, some white individuals are cruel and insensitive, mocking Chinese individuals they encounter. It's essential for these individuals to remember that the Chinese were also created by God and are strangers in our country. Mistreating a stranger is even more egregious than mistreating a local. Our skin color and appearance are insignificant compared to our virtues of honesty, love, diligence, and fairness. We all come from different lands but live together harmoniously, showcasing that we are all part of the same human family. Food comes in two main categories: plant-based and animal-based.

In the past, people had to personally carry their messages or rely on messengers to deliver them by running long distances without stopping. Eventually, a postman on horseback was entrusted with delivering mail from place to place. Later, stagecoaches were introduced, taking a week to travel the distance that a train covers in a few hours today. Nowadays, our mail is transported by trains or ships, and letter carriers bring it to our homes, town post offices, or rural mailboxes. Some streets are flat, while others slope like hills. Can you identify a level street and one that slopes? Which is easier to walk on and which is better for activities like roller-skating or coasting?

Rivers play a crucial role in our daily lives. They serve as highways for steamers carrying people, food, and goods. Sailboats and rowboats add charm to the waters, with fishermen providing fresh fish for city dwellers. Before cities, rivers were surrounded by beautiful countryside, with trees leaning over the water, creating picturesque reflections. Hills and mountains rise in the distance, and the river narrows into a small stream upstream. Cities utilize rivers for water supply, pumping millions of gallons daily to homes, schools, and factories through underground pipes. Water is essential for plants to grow, as rain keeps the soil moist. Clouds form when the air draws up moisture from rivers, eventually releasing rain and snow, sustaining life on Earth.|['1.

Long ago, wise men discovered that the Earth is not flat but round like a ball. To understand this, draw a line on your desk from north to south, marking N and S. Then draw another line from east to west, marking E and W. Create a plan of your desk with these directions. Hang it up with north at the top. Repeat this for your schoolroom. The Earth appears flat because it is vast. Hold a hole over a globe to see a small curved portion. Ships disappearing over the horizon helped these men realize Earth's roundness. Look at maps to see how land, water, islands, and rivers are depicted. North and South America form the Western Continent, connected by the Isthmus of Panama.

Different parts of the world experience varying seasons. Traveling north from our location, the climate becomes progressively colder, eventually leading to a region of extreme cold known as the North Pole. This area is surrounded by the North Frigid Zone. Similarly, there is a South Pole and a South Frigid Zone with intense cold. Moving south from our position, the climate becomes warmer until reaching the Torrid Zone, characterized by extreme heat. We reside in the North Temperate Zone, where we experience spring, summer, autumn, and winter. This zone provides a moderate climate suitable for human habitation and work. Most of the world's population lives in the Temperate Zones due to the favorable weather conditions. Plants in our zone adapt to the changing seasons, while those in the Torrid Zone thrive in the constant warmth.|"['1.

At the extreme ends of the Earth, the North and South Frigid Zones are covered in ice and snow all year round. These frozen lands are too cold for trees, grass, plants, animals, or people to survive. In the slightly warmer areas near the Temperate Zones, there are small dwarfed trees and moss where the Eskimos live. The Eskimos, who are part of the Indian family, reside in snow houses during the winter and skin tents during the cold summer. They travel on foot, using sledges pulled by dogs to carry loads. The Eskimos are kind and peaceful people, dressing in warm furs to combat the cold. The whale, found in the Frigid Zone's oceans, provides whalebone, oil, and fertilizer. Brave explorers like Robert E. Peary have ventured into these frozen lands to reach the North and South Poles.|['1.

North America has diverse landscapes, from dense forests to fertile farmlands. However, some areas are dry and arid, known as deserts, with only coarse grass and cactus growing. North America extends into various climate zones, with most lying in the temperate zone. It is separated from Asia by the Bering Strait. The continent used to be connected to South America, which is now separated by a canal. North America is surrounded by three oceans. The irregular coastline forms gulfs and bays like Hudson Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Capes jut out into the ocean, some with lighthouses to guide ships. The Eastern Highlands boast beautiful scenery, with forests of pine, spruce, and wildlife like squirrels and bears.|['1.
