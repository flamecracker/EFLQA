During the mercantile period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, significant changes occurred in trade and industry. The rise of the mercantile system saw the state taking control over industrial details that were previously managed by towns or guilds. The state regulated prices, laws of apprenticeship, quality inspections, wages, and even granted monopolies for certain goods. England focused on dominating foreign commerce through navigation acts and colonies to boost national wealth. Technological advancements like the flying shuttle, spinning-jenny, and power loom revolutionized production, shifting from slow handicrafts to machinery. The industrial revolution transformed society rapidly, moving workers to factories, changing their roles from craftsmen to specialists, and altering their living conditions drastically. The shift to industrialization brought challenges and hardships as society adjusted to the new economic order.|['1.

The shift from handcrafting to mechanization depicts a scene of greed that incites harsh criticism. The Royal Commissions meticulously documented these changes in industrial practices, leading Karl Marx to shape his social theories and Engles to rouse fellow workers. Carlyle and Ruskin used this data to condemn a society that subjected women and children to grueling hours in factories. The introduction of machinery also transformed business structures, fostering large-scale production and corporate consolidation. As transportation and trade expanded, global markets emerged, necessitating extensive credit systems. Concurrently, economic theories shifted towards unlimited competition, with Adam Smith advocating for economic freedom. However, the rise of capitalism brought power imbalances, challenging the notion that self-interest would ensure fairness. Laborers focused on wage disputes amid societal complexities, with historical attempts to regulate wages ultimately contributing to labor distress during the Industrial Revolution.|"['1.

Since the decline of the guild system, where master craftsmen controlled labor, workers had little say in their work agreements. With the rise of factories, workers were pushed together in towns, leading to a need for organization due to shared interests and harsh working conditions. As workers transitioned from journeymen to wage-earners, they faced unsanitary and burdensome conditions. This realization sparked grievances and fear, prompting unity and action. Labor organizations, though slow to grow in the eighteenth century, faced legal challenges like the doctrine of conspiracy and restrictions on trade combinations. Despite legal obstacles, strikes and unions persisted, showing workers' resilience against oppressive conditions and the pushback from authorities.|"['1.

In 1824, a significant change occurred in British politics when an act of Parliament allowed workingmen to negotiate collectively, removing the previous ban on unions. This reform was championed by three key figures. Francis Place, a tailor and radical politician, played a crucial role in advocating for labor rights. Joseph Hume, a physician turned politician, contributed greatly to financial and political reforms during his thirty years in Parliament. John R. McCulloch, an economist, also influenced social and political changes. These leaders helped transition Britain from a period of strict government control to one of conciliation, where the Labour Party now holds significant power. In America, the landscape was different, offering economic opportunities that allowed artisans to achieve independence. The old class distinctions from Europe began to fade, and skilled workers found success in the burgeoning American industry. Labor unions in colonial America were limited to skilled trades, and modern trade unions as we know them today were not yet established.|['1.

"The period after the Revolution brought significant changes to labor. Wages rose by fifty percent within a decade, leading to John Jay describing them as ""very extravagant"" in 1784. Despite industries being small and local, they grew quickly. This era saw a rise in labor organizations, mainly benevolent societies rather than unions. In New York, from 1800 to 1810, twenty-four such societies were formed, incorporating artisans from various trades. Philadelphia, Baltimore, and other cities also saw the formation of societies like cordwainers, printers, and tailors. Strikes for higher wages were common, with the Philadelphia cordwainers' strike in 1805 leading to a trial for conspiracy. Early strikes in New York City in 1809 and the actions of the New York Typographical Society in 1821 set the stage for modern labor movements."|"['1.

During the early 19th century in America, the Industrial Revolution was in full swing. New England was using its water power to run cotton mills, woolen mills, and tanneries. Massachusetts had 161 factories by 1820, while New York was rapidly growing into a financial hub. New Jersey was excelling in glassware, porcelains, and textiles. Philadelphia became a weaving center with 4,000 craftsmen. Even frontier towns like Pittsburgh and Cincinnati were transforming into manufacturing centers. By 1825, 2 million workers and $160 million were invested in manufacturing. This influx of workers, many poor immigrants, led to urbanization and demands for better working conditions. The rise of industry brought about the need for protective tariffs and improved transportation. The labor movement began as workers sought better pay and shorter hours. Despite challenges like poor housing and harsh working conditions, workers started uniting for better rights, marking the beginning of class solidarity.|['1.

The labor movement in the cities, particularly in Philadelphia, played a significant role in the formation of trade unions. The first Trades' Union in the United States was established in Philadelphia by the cordwainers in 1792, followed by their journeymen two years later. These early unions served as examples for other tradesmen to organize. In 1827, the Mechanics' Union of Trade Associations was formed, marking a pivotal moment in labor history. This union's influence was so profound that it inspired the first labor party and the publication of the Mechanics Free Press in 1828. The movement gained momentum with the formation of the Trades' Union of the City and County of Philadelphia in 1833, uniting over fifty societies with more than ten thousand members. This organization successfully led the first general strike in America in June 1835, advocating for a ten-hour workday and receiving widespread community support.|"[""1.

In 1833, carpenters in New York City demanded a raise from $1.37 to $1.50 per day, sparking a successful strike after gaining support from other workers like tailors, printers, and masons. This led to the formation of the General Trades' Union. Ely Moore, a Typographical Association member, became its first president and a congressman, representing labor. The movement for a ten-hour workday gained momentum, resulting in multiple strikes from 1834-1837. Notably, the 1836 tailors' strike saw 20 workers arrested and fined for resisting a wage cut. A mass meeting followed, denouncing injustice and tyranny. The town was plastered with coffin handbills, symbolizing the workers' fight against oppressive practices.|"['1.

The Boston Trades Union was established in 1834 to advocate for the ten-hour workday, led by groups like house carpenters, ship carpenters, and masons. Similar unions emerged in cities including Baltimore, Albany, and Pittsburgh. The National Trades Union was formed in 1834, bringing together various trade organizations. By 1835, unions were uniting at both local and national levels to address labor issues. The movement faced challenges, with the panic of 1837 halting progress. Despite setbacks, the labor movement persisted, advocating for issues like working hours and fair wages. The unions employed tactics like picketing and boycotts to protect workers' rights.

During strikes in the 1830s, laborers faced challenges with the militia and court decisions. In Philadelphia, rowdyism erupted during a general strike in 1835. Michel Chevalier noted the militia's inaction while the sheriff stood idly by. Laborers also protested unfavorable court rulings. In a New York tailors' strike in 1836, thousands gathered to object to a jury verdict. Demonstrators burned a judge in effigy after defendants were sentenced. Acts of sabotage were not uncommon. In 1835, striking cabinet-makers destroyed imported French furniture. Some went as far as burning houses or targeting new machinery. Despite these tumultuous times, strike benefits were established, aiding workers in need. The period of social unrest in the 1830s saw various philanthropic reforms attempted, influenced by figures like Robert Owen. While many communal experiments failed, they reflected the era's aspirations for social change.|"['1. What challenges did laborers face during strikes in the 1830s?\nA. Economic prosperity\nB.

During the 1800s, significant changes occurred in America. Movements driven by humanitarianism led to improvements in the treatment of the blind, deaf, dumb, and insane. Social care expanded to include criminals and debtors, ending medieval practices. Public schools saw reform with the appointment of Horace Mann in 1837. Amidst this progress, there were also peculiar trends like spirit rappings and religious fervor. Labor conditions varied, with skilled workers earning more than uneducated laborers. While some areas thrived, factory workers faced long hours and poor pay, especially women. Lowell's textile factories required thirteen-hour workdays, impacting the lives of young women. Despite some challenges like the truck system and overcrowded labor markets, there were also positive aspects like good food and opportunities for education and land ownership.|"['1.

During the 1800s, a coöperative movement emerged in cities like Philadelphia, Cincinnati, and New England, aiming to empower workers and change trade practices. Although short-lived, these experiments laid the foundation for future endeavors. The New England Workingmen's Association focused on providing steady employment and fair prices, prioritizing moral values over profit. Inspired by thinkers like Fourier and Marx, workers in Boston and New York embraced coöperation as a path to economic freedom. Despite challenges, these early coöperatives demonstrated the potential for collective action to challenge traditional power structures and advocate for workers' rights.

"During the 1840s, various labor movements and reform efforts emerged in the United States. The New York Protective Union was created as a peaceful revolution through cooperation, where members became their own employers by establishing their shops. Despite these attempts, lack of business experience and cooperation skills led to their failure. Concurrently, George Henry Evans advocated for free farms to attract city workers to the land. The idea of ""voting yourself a farm"" gained popularity, aiming to limit land monopolization and provide public lands to actual settlers. Additionally, labor advocated for a ten-hour workday, with President Van Buren's order setting the precedent in government employment. These movements reflected a growing humanitarian impulse in the 1840s, culminating in the Homestead Act of 1862 under the Republican Party."|"['1.

In 1847, New Hampshire passed a groundbreaking law limiting work to ten hours a day, especially for minors under fifteen. This marked the start of a movement to regulate work hours by society rather than by individual agreements. The law was met with enthusiasm by workers, who saw it as a significant victory. Horace Greeley, a notable figure, supported the law, emphasizing the importance of protecting children from excessive labor. Pennsylvania followed suit the next year, setting ten hours as a standard workday in certain industries and restricting children under twelve from working in specific mills. Despite some criticism, the ten-hour movement gained momentum and support from influential individuals like Wendell Phillips and Edward Everett. Other states like New Jersey, Ohio, and Rhode Island soon adopted similar laws.

During the 1800s, the factory system saw a surge in women workers, notably in New England textile mills. In 1829, mill girls in Dover, New Hampshire, made headlines by striking for better pay. The Lowell factory women also demanded higher wages in 1836 and formed the Factory Girls' Association. The women resisted the strict rules of the mill-owned boarding houses. The Female Labor Reform Association, later known as the Lowell Female Industrial Reform and Mutual Aid Society, was created in this dynamic environment. Women in Massachusetts led strikes, attended labor conventions, and pushed for improved labor laws. In New York, the Female Industry Association was established in 1845 to support various female workers facing low wages. By the 1850s, rising living costs due to the California gold rush led to widespread strikes across industries in cities like Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia.|"[""1.

During the early 1850s, a new kind of union emerged, focusing on practical changes within individual trades. These unions abandoned grand ideals of societal reform and instead concentrated on their own workshops and demands. By bargaining with employers and utilizing strikes and boycotts, they negotiated for better wages, hours, and working conditions. This approach marked a shift towards more effective and concrete resolutions compared to previous, less successful methods. The formation of trade unions led to the establishment of trade agreements that outlined specific working conditions. This shift was met with apprehension by those in favor of the existing system, as workers began to assert their rights and influence over their working environments. The idea of collective action spread across various trades, with national conventions being held to set industry standards and prevent wage reductions. This period saw the rise of organized labor movements with clear industrial objectives, replacing earlier loosely structured associations with broader goals. The legal recognition of workers' rights to unionize and advocate for better conditions, as exemplified by Chief Justice Shaw's ruling in Massachusetts, further empowered the labor movement and set the stage for more significant advancements in labor rights.|"['1.

"The period ended with widespread disturbances and concerns, both politically and economically. In 1857, a financial crisis led to a significant issue of unemployment across America. Instead of seeking higher pay, many now sought employment. In New York, crowds marched with banners pleading for food, while military forces guarded key buildings. From Philadelphia to New Orleans, banks failed, railroads went bankrupt, and factories shut down, leaving many jobless and hungry. In New York alone, around 40,000 people were unemployed. The period highlighted the close link between labor, industry, and commerce. The aftermath of the Civil War saw a rush for wealth, with the nation consumed by internal conflicts. The era marked a substantial industrial growth, with new technologies like the telephone and electric lights transforming daily life. The need for capital and skilled executives grew, leading to the rise of the ""Captain of Industry.""

During the late 1800s, strikes became a regular occurrence in the United States, almost like pay days or legal holidays. Some strikes during this time were massive and shook the industrial landscape like earthquakes. For instance, in 1873, coal miners in Pennsylvania went on strike due to unfair treatment by mine owners. Strikes also erupted in other states and across various industries. In 1877, railroad workers in Baltimore refused a wage cut, leading to riots. Federal troops had to be called in to control the situation. Strikes continued in 1880 and 1882, with workers from different sectors demanding better conditions. By 1886, the number of strikes peaked, culminating in the tragic Chicago Haymarket riots. Labor unrest during this period was fueled by issues like wages and working hours, with labor unions starting to play a role in national politics.|['1.

"During the period following the Civil War, labor reformers like Ira Steward from the Boston Machinists' and Blacksmiths' Union advocated for a shorter workday through pamphlets like ""A Reduction of Hours and Increase of Wages."" Steward's philosophy emphasized that a shorter workday would not reduce pay or output but would benefit both workers and employers. This movement gained momentum with support from figures like Wendell Phillips, Henry Ward Beecher, and Horace Greeley, leading to the passing of eight-hour laws in Illinois, Missouri, New York, and Wisconsin. In 1868, Congress established an eight-hour workday for public projects. Despite challenges, the idea of an eight-hour workday gained societal acceptance over time, as highlighted by President Wilson in 1916. Labor organizations evolved during this period, with a growing push for national unity among workers, culminating in the Baltimore Labor Congress of 1866, which emphasized the importance of organized, principled efforts over impulsive strikes."|"['1.

The National Labor Union, originating from a convention, held seven Annual Congresses displaying a wise conservatism. It avoided extreme radicalism and had a membership peak of 640,000. The organization influenced national unity, the eight-hour workday, and labor statistics. Unfortunately, it faced downfall after entering politics and affiliating with the Labor Reform party. Another significant group was the Knights of St. Crispin, a shoemakers' organization that rose rapidly but fell due to internal conflicts and failure to adapt to changing times. The Noble Order of the Knights of Labor, founded in 1869, aimed to unite workers across trades and uphold moral standards. Led by Uriah S. Stephens, it emphasized solidarity and excluded those involved in certain professions. Initially secretive, it later embraced transparency to dispel public fears.|['1.

The Knights of Labor was a noble organization founded on high ideals by Stephens, its first Grand Master Workman. Stephens promoted justice and moral elevation for all mankind, emphasizing charity and generosity over selfishness. His successor, Powderly, continued these principles, rising from humble beginnings to lead the order to its peak. The Knights believed labor was noble and sought to protect workers from exploitation by capital. They aimed to create a healthy public opinion on labor, advocating for fair treatment and just rewards for workers' contributions. The organization grew rapidly, reaching over 1,000,000 members across the United States and Canada at its peak, before eventually collapsing.|['1.

In 1886, a tumultuous year, labor disputes were on the rise, with almost 500 conflicts over wage increases. The Knights of Labor, a prominent labor organization, faced a crisis when strikes erupted across the country, tarnishing their image. The most notable strike occurred on the Southwestern Railroad, where a mechanic's dismissal sparked a widespread strike along the Gould system, centered in St. Louis. The Knights of Labor's involvement in these strikes led to their disfavor among the public. In New York and Chicago, violent strikes further damaged the organization's reputation. A pivotal moment came in Chicago's Haymarket Square, where anarchists clashed with police, resulting in casualties. The Knights of Labor's association with these events led to a decline in public support and a loss of 300,000 members in 1888. Efforts for arbitration and conciliation in labor disputes gained traction, with President Cleveland advocating for a board of labor commissioners in 1886. Congress later enacted laws for arbitration in railway labor disputes in 1888.|"[""1.

Arbitration is a fair way to resolve disputes based on facts. It doesn't involve broad ideas but focuses on specific issues. The new trade union was well-organized and could easily adapt to arbitration. This marked a new phase in labor movements. Industries like sugar, coffee, steel, tobacco, and oil now had a different meaning in the stock market. Large corporations controlled a significant portion of production and employed many workers. Workers began to rely on group efforts for better wages and conditions. The American Federation of Labor, formed in 1881, grew rapidly and became a powerful labor organization in the US. It united various trade unions and emphasized local organization and teamwork. The Federation grew steadily, reaching over 2 million members by 1917, making it a significant force in American industry.|['1. What is the main focus of arbitration mentioned in the text?\nA.

The American Federation of Labor, a powerful and vast organization, operates on the principle of trade homogeneity. This means that while each trade focuses on its specific affairs, they all care about general matters that impact all laborers. The Federation balances local autonomy with federal oversight to address these dual interests effectively. It is highly organized but operates democratically, relying on referendums for decisions. The Federation is funded by a per capita tax from its members and is managed by an executive council elected by the Annual Convention. The Federation is divided into five departments, each representing different labor groups. These departments hold annual conventions and handle their specific affairs. Additionally, there are state branches and local unions that play crucial roles in the organization. Samuel Gompers, the Federation's President, has been instrumental in its success through his strategic leadership.|['1.

Samuel Gompers, a prominent figure in American labor history, received his early training from a local cigar-makers' union known for its progressive and organized approach. This union was among the first to adopt British-style benefits for its members, promoting skill and intelligence within the craft. Gompers, who later became the head of the Federation of Labor, carried the values of his early union experiences into his leadership role. He played a crucial role in the reorganization of the Federation in 1886 and advocated for cautious yet steady growth. Gompers emphasized the autonomy of constituent unions, promoted financial frugality, and favored democratic decision-making processes within the organization.

Samuel Gompers, a prominent labor leader, was known for his bold leadership and fearlessness in standing up for workers' rights. He was not afraid to challenge powerful figures like Theodore Roosevelt and President Eliot of Harvard in defense of trade unions. Gompers faced numerous challenges from various authorities but remained undaunted, always ready to defend his cause. He played a crucial role as a lobbyist for the Federation, advocating for important labor reforms such as the eight-hour workday and child labor legislation. Gompers also fought against laws that were detrimental to labor unions, such as the Sherman Anti-Trust Law, eventually succeeding in securing exemptions for labor organizations. During World War I, he led efforts to Americanize the labor movement and combat anti-American activities among workers.

"This was the first significant step taken by Gompers and the Federation. The second was equally crucial. With typical energy, the organization proposed a plan to adjust labor to wartime conditions. The Federation's manifesto declared, ""This is labor's war."" They emphasized that labor must win the war, with every stage contributing to humanity's benefit. These aims were included in constructive suggestions adopted by the Council of National Defense appointed by President Wilson. Gompers played a key role in developing this program. The plan aimed to develop public sentiment and facilitate the implementation of a national labor program. Gompers furthered his efforts by uniting labor internationally during a mission to Europe.

During the war, Gompers, a key figure in the labor movement, fought against pacifist and socialist elements both at home and abroad. He championed trade unionism and emphasized the need for labor and capital to cooperate on equal terms. Gompers, a staunch trade unionist, believed in the balance between capital and labor, advocating for unity among workers to fight for their rights. He declined political opportunities, focusing on advancing the cause of labor through the American Federation of Labor. Over time, the Federation evolved to include unskilled workers, moving away from its initial focus on skilled trades. The Federation's policy shifted towards amalgamating various trades into one union, promoting unity among workers. Today, the Federation stands as a powerful organization that influences workers across different trades, showcasing its strength and unity in the face of challenges like socialism and Bolshevism.|"['1.

Trade unions are vital organizations that serve as a collective voice for workers. The union's authority lies in its general convention, a delegate assembly that meets regularly. While some unions convene annually, others do so every two or three years. The convention elects general officers, with the president being a prominent figure responsible for leading strikes and representing the union publicly. The president is supported by vice-presidents who handle specific roles within the organization. Local unions, where workers directly engage with the union, provide a platform for members to discuss issues freely. These local unions, some dating back to before the Civil War, play a crucial role in maintaining the union's vitality. They operate independently but are often affiliated with national unions. Each union varies in structure, membership size, and bargaining success, reflecting the diversity within the labor movement.|['1.

Trade unions often face challenges in adapting to the changing landscape of modern industry. Disputes over jurisdiction between unions arise frequently, leading to conflicts that are difficult to resolve. For instance, the Association of Longshoremen and the Seamen's Union both claim authority over employees in marine warehouses. Similar conflicts occur between the cigar-makers and stogie-makers, as well as between the Brewery Workers and the Coopers' Union regarding control over brewery workers. Even the operators of specific machinery, like linotype machines, face disputes over their classification. These disagreements highlight the limitations of the Federation in mediating conflicts, as there is no centralized authority to establish standards for resolving such disputes. The lack of a unified approach often results in petty rivalries and disputes that hinder progress within the labor movement.|"['1.

In the United States, labor leaders often rise from the working class with limited formal education. While some have only completed primary school, many have expanded their knowledge through self-directed reading and keen observation. A few have pursued legal studies or attended night classes, but all have gained their most valuable education from real-life experiences. Growing up in poverty and surrounded by hardworking individuals, they deeply understand and empathize with the struggles of the working class. This unique background shapes their perspective on life, their biases, and their aspirations. Unlike their British counterparts, American labor leaders are known for their practical expertise, focused specialization, and adept negotiation skills. While British leaders may have a more polished demeanor and intellectual veneer, American leaders excel in their quick thinking and adaptability in challenging situations.|['1.

Thomas Kidd, the secretary of the Wood-Workers' International Union, played a pivotal role in negotiating a historic agreement with manufacturers in 1897. This agreement established a minimum wage of fifteen cents per hour for a ten-hour workday, a significant improvement over previous wages. Despite facing severe criticism and legal challenges, Kidd persevered. In a similar vein, Theodore Schaffer revitalized the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers after a failed strike in 1892, navigating opposition from steel manufacturers. James M. Lynch's adept leadership of the International Typographical Union led to successful collective bargaining efforts against major newspapers. D. J. Keefe faced unique challenges in organizing unskilled longshoremen and transport workers but managed to guide his union effectively.

At the start of the strike, Mitchell, the Union president, proposed submitting all grievances to a fair tribunal, but mine owners rejected it. This refusal swayed public opinion in favor of the strikers. Despite escalating tensions during the weeks-long struggle, Mitchell remained composed. President Roosevelt intervened, convening a meeting at the White House. Mitchell's dignified conduct stood out. The Arbitration Board eventually favored the miners, attributing much of the victory to Mitchell. He demonstrated remarkable composure during cross-examination. Mitchell's influence stemmed from his leadership qualities, sense of duty, and realistic approach to negotiations. He believed in minimizing strikes and upholding societal obligations. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, of which Mitchell was a part, exemplified unity and wisdom in handling disputes, earning respect from all sides.|"['1.

Until now, the Railway Brotherhoods have not joined the Knights of Labor or the American Federation of Labor. In 1916, Congress passed the eight-hour law, prompting the Railway Brotherhoods to seek affiliation with the Federation. By 1919, the Federation granted them a charter due in part to the esteemed reputation of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. Becoming an engineer is no easy feat. Aspiring engineers must first serve as firemen for four to twelve years, shoveling tons of coal into locomotive fireboxes during long runs. Only a select few advance to become engineers, facing physical and moral challenges. Engineers must exhibit exceptional character and skill, passing rigorous moral tests to maintain membership. The Brotherhood upholds strict standards, expelling members for misconduct. Despite its exclusivity, the Brotherhood shows tolerance towards non-members, even advocating for their rights in certain cases.|"[""1.

Since its establishment, the Brotherhood has focused on conducting business with the railroad company rather than sentiment. The Brotherhood believes that agreements on wages, hours, working conditions, and conflict resolutions should be formalized in written contracts. They argue that individual engineers lack negotiating power when dealing with railway companies and thus have the right to form collective contracts. Despite initial resistance from railways, they eventually accepted the collective bargaining approach. The Brotherhood enforces the sanctity of contracts and expels members or revokes charters for violations. They have a board for dispute resolution, ensuring all members abide by its decisions. This strategy has prevented major strikes since 1888. The Brotherhood also provides insurance and support for its members, maintaining a pension system and a Home for Disabled Railroad Men. The organization promotes intellectual and social activities, emphasizing technical skills through the Locomotive Engineers' Journal and regular meetings.|"['1.

The engineers have formed a strong Brotherhood, reviving the medieval guild-paternalism where each member is accountable for the others. Through self-discipline, they unite to enforce demands and fulfill obligations. The Convention, comprising delegates from local branches, holds the highest authority. In the absence of the Convention, the Grand Chief Engineer leads, with his decisions final unless overturned by the Convention. P. M. Arthur, a prominent figure, led the Brotherhood for thirty years, enhancing the status of locomotive engineers. He skillfully negotiated for fair wages and improved working conditions, earning respect from both railways and engineers. Upon Arthur's sudden passing, A. B. Youngson, who was ill, recommended Warren S. Stone as his successor, a man with exceptional executive abilities and a significant role in labor politics ahead. Stone, known for his sound judgment, rose from humble beginnings to lead the Brotherhood effectively.|"['1.

Stone, the new leader, implemented a wage adjustment strategy across the country, starting in the Western section. Despite initial resistance, a wage conference was held, resulting in a gradual increase in wages until a fair scale was established. Similar success was achieved in the Southern section. However, a major dispute arose in the Eastern District in 1912 when engineers demanded standardized wages. To resolve this, an arbitration board was formed, comprising distinguished individuals. After months of deliberation, the board recommended a minimum wage increase, acknowledging the public's interest in such disputes. While the engineers accepted the board's decision, Morrissey dissented, emphasizing the impracticality of compulsory arbitration. The resolution marked progress in labor disputes within the railway industry.|"[""1.

The importance of these terms became evident four years later when the united railway brotherhoods made a significant move in Congress. At the time, the public believed the railway employee issue was resolved, although the decisions were only valid for one year. Daniel Willard, speaking on behalf of the railroads, accepted the award despite not agreeing with all the details. This marked a shift in power from corporations to unions. The Order of Railway Conductors, established in 1868, has grown steadily and is known for its conservative and well-trained members. The organization is led skillfully, with few disputes with railways in recent years. Edgar E. Clark, a respected figure within the organization, served as president until 1906. He was succeeded by Austin B. Garretson, known for his successful negotiations and contributions to labor relations.|['1.

Garretson, an active member of the National Civic Federation's executive committee, was appointed by President Wilson to the Federal Commission on Industrial Relations in 1912. He later became prominent in labor union activities. Apart from the locomotive engineers and conductors, firemen also formed their union. Initially, it was more of a fraternal order than a trade union. By 1885, the order recovered from financial struggles and resumed its functions as a labor union. The Brotherhood faced challenges during historic strikes, but its membership grew steadily. An agreement in 1913 allowed men operating electric engines to join. Despite criticism for not forming a single large union, the Brotherhood maintained autonomy while collaborating with other railway unions on shared issues and defense. The leadership of the Brotherhood has seen notable figures like Eugene V. Debs and Frank W. Arnold, with William S. Carter serving as president since 1909.|"[""1.

The firemen's brotherhood has thrived by taking care of its members through a beneficiary fund. The Firemen's Magazine, launched in 1876, aims to educate railroad workers. The Brotherhood of Trainmen, founded in 1883, faced initial challenges but grew under the leadership of S. E. Wilkinson, who improved wages and working conditions. Wilkinson's successor, P. H. Morrissey, further strengthened the organization, advocating for fair pay and better treatment of train and yard service workers. Morrissey's analytical and diplomatic approach helped rebuild the Brotherhood's reputation and finances after a period of turmoil. Under his leadership, the organization saw growth, standardization of work, and pay increases for its members. Morrissey's legacy lies in restoring public trust in the Brotherhood.|"[""1.

William G. Lee succeeded his predecessor after serving in various roles within local lodges. He became First Vice-Grand Master in 1895, learning from Morrissey for fifteen years. Lee continued Morrissey's policies boldly. Upon becoming the order's president, he secured a ten-hour workday and raised wages for Eastern train and yard workers. The ten-hour day was extended to the Western region. By 1912, Southern railroads also adopted the ten-hour day, leading to higher wages. Lee played a key role in the movement for an eight-hour day, which resulted in the Adamson Law. The Brotherhoods' success and influence stem from their members and capable leadership. Their impact on Federal legislation regarding labor conditions and arbitration in interstate carriers is evident.|"[""1. What role did William G.

Instead of firmly supporting arbitration, the President decided to address Congress on the afternoon of August 29th. He first requested a reorganization of the Interstate Commerce Commission, legal recognition of the eight-hour workday for interstate carriers, and the power to appoint a commission to monitor this workday. Additionally, he sought to revisit the increase in freight rates, make railway strikes and lockouts illegal until a public investigation was conducted, and gain authority to operate the railroads in times of military necessity. The strike was planned for September 4th, targeting the returning vacationers. On September 1st, an eight-hour bill was swiftly passed in the House and Senate, receiving the President's approval on the third day. The other recommendations were put on hold pending Congress and union decisions. The unions strongly opposed making railway strikes unlawful until reasons were disclosed. In March 1917, the Brotherhoods once again threatened to strike over the eight-hour law but were urged to reach an agreement by a committee sent by the President. The Supreme Court validated the law in March, calming the situation. However, tensions resurfaced after the declaration of war, with the unions initially refusing arbitration but later agreeing under war pressure. The rapid enactment of the eight-hour law raised suspicions of political motives, especially as Ohio, home to the Brotherhoods, shifted from Republican to Democratic in the next presidential election. The public perceived a lack of balance in the law's implementation. The government took over the management of interstate railroads during|['1.

The success of collective bargaining relies on the unity and honesty of the union involved in the negotiation process. A union that can uphold an agreement is crucial for such deals to work. John Mitchell believed that compulsory union membership would become more widespread and accepted in the future, similar to mandatory school attendance for children. However, some industries have more power than unions and oppose the closed shop policy, where only union members can be employed. This issue has been a long-standing challenge for unions. While wages and hours are commonly part of collective agreements, the issue of union exclusivity remains unresolved. Unions use strikes, picketing, boycotts, and union labels to push their agendas. Strikes have a long history and have been a common tool for labor protests. The United States has seen numerous strikes over the years, causing significant disruptions to industries and affecting millions of workers.|['1.

The rise in union power is evident, with union recognition leading to more frequent strikes. In 1881, unions were involved in 47% of strikes, increasing to 75% by 1905. The number of strikes is also on the rise, with 3494 strikes in 1903, averaging about ten per day. Unions prepare for these battles with leaders, funds, relief committees, and publicity agents. While union leaders usually discourage violence, strikes often attract troublemakers. Violent strikes have marred history, like the 1877 railway strikes and the 1910 Los Angeles Times bombing. Acts of violence have damaged the public's perception of strikes. Despite some arguing that violence in strikes is exaggerated, it remains a concern. The autonomy of local unions to declare strikes without national approval poses challenges, with newer unions more prone to impulsive strikes.|"['1.

The boycott is a powerful tool used by labor unions to influence businesses. It involves refusing to engage with a company or its products to pressure them to change their practices. The boycott can be so effective that it can cause a flourishing business to lose its customers overnight. In the late 19th century, the boycott reached its peak in power, especially in industries like theater, hotels, and clothing. While initially successful, some instances of the boycott became unfair and led to public sympathy for the targeted businesses. The misuse of the boycott, including attempts at extortion, led to its decline in public support. Despite its controversies, the boycott remains a significant tactic for organized labor to achieve their goals when strikes fail.|"[""1.

Espionage was used by the American Federation to blacklist Buck's Stoves and Ranges, leading the company to the brink of ruin. Despite an injunction, the Federation evaded the ban by cleverly wording labor journals. This defiance of the court led to the imprisonment of Federation officers, but they avoided jail time due to a technicality. The Danbury Hatters' boycott was another case where a closed shop led to a nationwide boycott. Legal battles ensued, resulting in damages awarded to the plaintiff. The union's funds were used to pay $60,000, and foreclosure proceedings on union members' homes were initiated. Eventually, the matter was settled, with the union paying $235,000 in damages. The Clayton bill of 1914 was passed to protect labor unions from anti-trust laws. The union label, denoting union-made products, became a vital tool in labor disputes, with various unions adopting it to promote their goods.|"['1.

"The use of labels is expanding rapidly, particularly in building materials in major cities. For instance, in Chicago, bricklayers and carpenters have influenced builders and contractors to use only union-labeled materials. This practice extends to various professions like barbers and retail clerks who display union affiliation in their workplaces. Unions have faced challenges with counterfeiters due to the lack of trademark protection. Unions also try to limit production rates and resist new machinery to prevent overwork. Industrial disputes between unions and employers have been marked by selfishness, suspicion, and bitterness, leading to strikes and boycotts. Despite these conflicts, there is a movement towards collective justice in society. The rise of syndicalism in Europe influenced violent union tactics, which also gained attention in the United States, especially among casual laborers known as ""floaters.""

The unskilled workers in factory towns were easily targeted by industrial organizers due to their low wages and poor living conditions. These workers, mainly immigrants, had different political and social beliefs than American traditions. Despite their ties to family and some stability, periods of unemployment made them restless. Efforts to organize them faced challenges due to their transient nature and lack of interest in industrial organizations. The Western Federation of Miners, formed in 1893, played a crucial role in inspiring the Industrial Workers of the World (I. W. W.). This new unionism emerged from radical leaders who aimed to unite workers across industries. Despite facing opposition, the I. W. W. sought to promote labor solidarity and challenge traditional trade union practices.|['1.

During a convention, leaders like Eugene V. Debs, William D. Haywood, Daniel DeLeon, A. M. Simons, and William E. Trautmann, all well-versed in socialist disputes, formed the Industrial Workers of the World (I.W.W.). They established a constitution with six departments focusing on various industries. However, internal conflicts arose among members with differing views on politics and unionism. This led to the split of socialist factions and the emergence of the Detroit branch under Haywood's leadership. Free from political ties, Haywood dedicated himself to organizing laborers, particularly the marginalized workers. His efforts made the I.W.W. synonymous with the Chicago branch, overshadowing the Detroit faction.

The I. W. W., known for its radical beliefs, seeks to overthrow capitalism through direct action and the power of the working class. Rejecting political solutions, they advocate for a universal industrial union to take control of all industries and abolish the wage system. By promoting the general strike and sabotage, they aim to demonstrate the collective power of workers. Direct action involves disrupting the capitalist system through passive, opportune, and temporary strikes, challenging the traditional methods of control used by employers. The I. W. W. envisions a society where workers collectively own and manage industries, eliminating the disparities between the working and employing classes. Their goal is a complete revolution achieved by persuading every worker to join the union and stand united against the existing economic and social structures.|"['1. What is the main goal of the I.

"Sabotage is a term that embodies the philosophy and tactics of revolutionary labor. John Spargo, in his book on Syndicalism, Industrial Unionism, and Socialism, explains how the word originated from London's dockers' union. The workers faced challenges in achieving their demands through strikes. They resorted to tactics like ""lying down on the job"" or ""soldiering,"" inspired by the Scottish phrase ca'canny, which means to slow down work. The concept extended to machines, where planned 'accidents' caused confusion. French syndicalists adopted the idea as sabotage, derived from the French phrase Travailler à coups de sabots. The Industrial Workers of the World (I. W. W.) used such tactics in strikes like the one in Lawrence, Massachusetts, in 1912, drawing attention from various authorities and media outlets, highlighting the plight of workers."|"['1.

During the early 1900s, labor disputes in American factory towns like Lawrence, Little Falls, Akron, and Paterson highlighted the struggles of workers. In Lawrence, Massachusetts, employers cut wages, the town government failed to act, and I. W. W. leaders took advantage of vulnerable workers. A similar scenario unfolded in Little Falls, New York, and Akron, Ohio, where sudden wage reductions and lack of communication led to strikes. The I. W. W. capitalized on these situations, leading to tension and violence. In Paterson, New Jersey, the I. W. W. threatened the town, resulting in arrests and trials. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn and Patrick Quinlan, key figures in the strikes, faced legal consequences for their involvement.

During the early 1900s, labor unrest and strikes were prevalent in many parts of the United States. In cities like Paterson and New York City, laborers organized strikes and protests to demand better wages and working conditions. The Industrial Workers of the World (I. W. W.) played a significant role in these movements, often resorting to aggressive tactics to make their voices heard. In some instances, the I. W. W. members entered churches and disrupted services, leading to arrests and public outcry. The laborers in Granite City, Illinois, staged peaceful protests demanding higher wages, while in towns like Spokane and Everett in Washington, violent clashes between labor groups and citizens occurred.

The I. W. W. members protested restrictions on their right to speak in public places, claiming it violated their freedom of speech. In San Diego in 1910, they held street meetings, but when their language turned aggressive, the city council banned street speaking in certain areas without a permit. The agitators were denied permits, leading to clashes with authorities. This led to confrontations, arrests, and trials demanding jury trials. The I. W. W. vowed to fight until free speech was allowed, mobilizing members nationwide. The situation escalated with rumors of German support during World War I. The public turned against the I. W. W., leading to arrests and violent actions by communities to expel the group.

The Federal Government investigated the I. W. W., a labor organization, for plotting to disrupt lake traffic. Raids on their Detroit and Chicago offices led to indictments of over 160 leaders. In Cleveland and Buffalo, similar suspicions arose. Members faced trials for opposing military service. In 1919, 46 defendants were found guilty in Sacramento. The I. W. W. had a fluctuating membership, reaching 75,000 in 1917. The organization attracted the discontented and unemployed, often recent immigrants. Despite financial struggles, it wielded influence through bold leaders and exploiting societal fears. Labor's involvement in politics faced challenges without broader support. Labor parties failed without collaboration with other political forces. Labor's influence in democracy hinges on public opinion and partnerships beyond trade policies.|['1.

In the early 19th century, labor movements in Philadelphia and New York attempted to engage in politics but faced challenges. In Philadelphia, the workingman's party formed in 1828, aiming to advocate for working-class interests. However, their candidates received limited votes compared to established political parties like Jackson and Adams. Despite initial setbacks, the workingmen regrouped, forming political clubs and achieving some success in local elections in 1829. In New York, a political venture led by Thomas Skidmore proposed radical social and economic reforms, but the party faced criticism and failed to gain widespread support. The movement's ideas, including equal land distribution and public education, were seen as too extreme by many. Ultimately, both the Philadelphia and New York labor parties struggled to gain traction in the political landscape dominated by established parties.|"[""1.

The Workingman's party faced challenges due to internal divisions. In 1829, a meeting was held to revise the party platform, resulting in the exclusion of agrarian aspects favored by some members. Skidmore, a dissenting voice, was unable to be heard over the crowd and subsequently formed the Agrarian party. Meanwhile, Robert Dale Owen and Fanny Wright advocated for a State Guardianship Plan emphasizing state control over children. Despite these efforts, none of the workingmen's parties gained significant influence in state politics. In New England, the New England Association of Farmers, Mechanics, and Workingmen emerged in 1830, aiming to address issues like debt imprisonment, public education, and government salaries. While the movement faced criticism, it highlighted the importance of unity among diverse working-class groups for political change.|"[""1.

In the early 1930s, towns and cities in Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut, and Rhode Island elected workingmen's candidates to local offices with the support of small tradespeople. However, these attempts to form a separate labor party failed as partisan movements. The labor leader often lacked the experience to compete with seasoned party manipulators, and the labor vote was not unified enough to make a significant impact. The labor candidates had to rely on the goodwill of other classes to win elections, which was not always forthcoming. Despite these challenges, the labor movement influenced legislative changes in various states, such as lien laws, free schools, and the ten-hour workday. It wasn't until after the Civil War that labor began to form a national party, marking a significant step in the political power of the working class.|"['1.

In 1880, a new party with high hopes joined the political scene. Led by General James B. Weaver, this party focused on farmers' interests. Despite energetic campaigning, Weaver only secured a modest 308,578 votes, mainly from the West. The party's influence dwindled, leading to the rise of labor-focused groups like the Union Labor party. Subsequently, the National Union Labor party emerged from a meeting of various labor and farmers' organizations. Meanwhile, Henry George's popularity surged, with the formation of the United Labor party echoing his economic views. Efforts to merge the Union Labor and United Labor parties failed, resulting in their demise after the election. In 1889, the Knights of Labor and Farmers' Alliance initiated political collaboration, laying the groundwork for the People's party, or Populist party. This new party, with General Weaver as its presidential nominee, championed various reforms like government control of key industries and income tax. The People's party aimed to unite labor forces and address common challenges faced by rural and city workers.|"[""1. What was the main focus of the party led by General James B.

Before 1896, labor movements were influential in local and state elections rather than on a national scale. Organized labor faced challenges in competing with established national parties. Despite this, labor parties achieved success in state elections. For instance, in 1872, labor reformers nominated state candidates in Pennsylvania and Connecticut. Wendell Phillips was nominated for Governor of Massachusetts in 1875. In 1878, in collaboration with the Greenbackers, many state officers were elected in the West. By 1888, labor tickets were nominated in various Western States. Kansas and Missouri saw significant labor votes. In California, the labor movement gained attention, led by Dennis Kearney. He formed the Workingman's Trade and Labor Union in San Francisco, advocating for government control by the people and the removal of Chinese labor. Kearney's extreme rhetoric led to his arrest, but his influence on the labor movement continued.|"['1.

In 1878, the Workingman's party, together with the Grangers, achieved a significant victory by electing a workingman as mayor of San Francisco and securing a majority in the state constitutional convention. This collaboration aimed to address the issues in the state, such as limiting the power of corporations, restructuring the courts, and overseeing the railroads. However, the new constitution's impact fell short of expectations. Corporations still wielded considerable influence, labor relations remained tense, and the state railroad commission proved ineffective. The labor movement underwent changes, influenced by the American Federation of Labor and the emergence of political socialism. By 1892, a national Socialist-Labor party was established, advocating for radical reforms like abolishing the Presidency, Vice-Presidency, and Senate. Despite splits within the socialist ranks, figures like Eugene V. Debs continued to champion the socialist cause, garnering significant votes in subsequent elections.|"[""1.

The Socialist movement in the United States gained significant traction in the early 20th century. By 1912, over 1,500,000 people in various towns and cities supported Socialist candidates. Notably, Milwaukee elected a Socialist mayor and sent the first Socialist Congressman, Victor Berger, to Washington. The working class showed solidarity with the Socialist cause by electing labor-union members to city councils. However, during World War I, the Socialist party faced internal divisions as pacifists and pro-Germans found refuge within it. Despite attempts to align with organized labor, the American Federation of Labor largely rebuffed the Socialists. The Federation strategically engaged in political maneuvers to support candidates friendly to labor's demands, resulting in legislative successes like the Clayton bill and the eight-hour railroad bill during the Wilson Administration.|"['1.

Labor unions have gained influence in Congress, with union members increasing from six in 1908 to seventeen in 1912. The Federation, which includes the Secretary of Labor, actively participates in politics and opposes anti-union policies. They strategically place union members in key positions to push for labor-friendly laws. The Federation's lobby in Washington mirrors efforts in state capitals, ensuring labor's interests are protected. Labor laws focus on worker safety, compensation, and regulating working conditions. The state now monitors not only workplaces but also the living conditions of workers and their families. The government provides services like healthcare and education, reflecting a shift towards more social responsibility. The State intervenes in labor disputes, promoting mediation and aiming to reduce conflicts for the benefit of all parties involved.|"['1.

Labor organizations have found success influencing legislation but have faced challenges with the military and judiciary branches enforcing state commands. Organized labor has engaged in persistent battles to sway these branches. Court decisions not favoring unions are met with disapproval. United States Supreme Court rulings on open shops are criticized in labor publications. Public opinion eventually aligns with union stances, shaping laws to favor labor. A major issue for labor is courts using injunctions to halt boycotts and strikes. Unions argue this denies defendants a jury trial. They advocate modifying laws to ensure this right in labor disputes. The use of military force during strikes is also contested by unions. The formation of an American Labor party post-World War I aimed to address labor concerns but faced challenges gaining traction.|['1.
