"It's not worth delving into the entire story. A book would barely hold it all. The details can wait until we meet again on the hills of Yarrow - if we ever do, as those English folks might be the end of me before I get home if they continue as they've started. Here's the gist: I've been mingling with thieves, burglars, and pickpockets, visiting their hideouts and roaming the streets with them. I've stolen a fifty-pound note, which was found in my bag. That's the worst of it; however, I seem to have resisted the police in the discharge of their duty, resulting in me tossing one over a sofa and shoving another into a coal scuttle - unintentionally, though his pants suffered, much like mine did as a young lad. But I was so provoked when they first grabbed me that I couldn't help it! 

I was interrupted by a visitor - and a scolding at the same time, as he turned out to be a friend, albeit a stranger, Colonel Brentwood, who has been deceived by that deceitful lawyer trying to cause trouble for me. But he'll find out that I'm tough! The Colonel assures me they'll have no trouble clearing my name, so take comfort in that, mother. Your mischievous son, DAVID.

"The gathering wasn't large, but it was exclusive. Among the attendees were a washerwoman with bright red arms, a caretaker who neglected her own care, a few chimney-sweeps with only partially cleaned faces, a charwoman along with her friend, the female greengrocer who had lost her shop to a fire, a couple of coster-mongers, a burglar, several thieves, a footman in fancy attire, a handful of known heavy drinkers, and chimney-pot Liz with a teapot similar to her original one, gifted by Colonel Brentwood. The footman, arriving early with Liz, sat quietly in a corner, while the eccentric group assembled. As tea was served, Mrs. Rampy, with an unusual air, exclaimed, ""Lord, bless us--an' our wittles!"" before urging Mrs. Blathers to serve the cake. Mrs. Rampy then broke down, and the eccentric footman revealed his identity as Rodgers, announcing that the Colonel and a lord would be visiting that evening to aid the community."|"['1.

In my previous letter, I shared the details of the fire incident, but I didn't mention that amidst the chimneys and blazing fires, I found the courage to propose to my Susy. It might have seemed foolish for a reserved man like me, but one's behavior can be quite peculiar at such moments! It marked a grand finale to my rather unconventional courtship. The only worry I have in Babylon is if young Tammy Splint were to find out, it would never end. You see, although he was present, he was unaware of my intentions. Speaking of which, the child has been appointed as a servant by the Colonel, whom they call a tiger. Even more surprising is that the Colonel has also taken in poor Rodgers and made him a servant. Mrs. Brentwood, or Dory as he calls her, initially had reservations, but the Colonel's persuasive ways won her over. The argument was indeed convincing. In any case, Rodgers is now in livery and white stockings. This reminds me that they have dressed young Splint in blue tights with brass buttons. He looks quite peculiar! It's an odd outfit for anyone but a clown, yet the child is immensely proud of it. However, it matters little what he wears, for he would joke and frolic regardless of his attire. My future father-in-law, Sam Blake, intends to come to Scotland for the wedding but won't stay as he is fond of the sea. I fear he won't|"['1.

Susy eagerly embraced her role as a lady's-maid under Mrs. Brentwood's temporary employment. Her true mission, however, was to tend to the garden in preparation for her upcoming marriage and subsequent journey to Scotland with the family. The tiger, who was privy to the secret plan, was sworn to silence under threat of dire consequences. As the carriage ascended the Braes of Yarrow, a significant discovery was made by Susan and David, leading to a joyful exchange of glances. Susan's arrival in Scotland was met with warm greetings, and she was promptly welcomed by Mrs. Laidlaw. The successful execution of the plan brought contentment to all involved, establishing a tradition of yearly visits between Bawbylon and the Braes of Yarrow.
