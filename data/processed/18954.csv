"Florette paused, contemplating if she could do more for their comfort. Tom insisted on accompanying her part of the way back. They stopped under the thick trellis, as she didn't want him near the house. ""My father is heartbroken. We are persecuted all the time. They own Alsace but don't love it. It's like a stepfather,"" she explained sadly. ""Families will be separated, some to Prussia, some to Alsace."" Florette held Tom's hand, grateful to see him. Tom felt sorry for her and thanked her.

"Throughout most of the day, they sat with their knees drawn up, leaning against the inside of the large vat, discussing their plans in quiet voices. With nothing else to occupy them in the dim light, time passed slowly and monotonously. They had closed the door but left it slightly ajar, peeking out occasionally, listening anxiously for approaching footsteps. But no one came. ""I'm confused,"" Tom admitted. ""The prisoner had a map. Nancy is the closest place, near Toul where our friends are. Listen!"" Tom paused, moved by the sound of his homeland reaching him in this dark, lonely dungeon in a foreign land. Feeling the door yield slightly at the corners, panic set in as Archer and Tom realized their predicament. Tom tried to remain calm, but the suspense was overwhelming. They attempted to distract themselves with conversation, but as darkness fell, they grew more anxious, waiting for Florette's arrival. Eventually, they abandoned their facade of composure, sitting in silence, consumed by worry about their uncertain fate."|"['1.

For a brief moment, they stood in anxious anticipation. A faint noise broke the silence, followed by cautious footsteps near the door. A speck of dirt fell, unsettling Archer. The atmosphere grew tense, but Tom's composure reassured him. Time passed, fear of capture turned to dread of being trapped. Questions filled their minds: What was the gunshot? Why hadn't Florette arrived? Who walked on the roof? The stale air and throbbing heads added to their distress. Tom, determined, produced barbed wire from his pocket. They devised a plan to escape, using the wire to manipulate the lock. Tom, resourceful, lit a fire to illuminate their surroundings. Despite the grim situation, they remained focused on finding a way out.|"[""1.

Tom calmly suggested focusing on finding a way out to avoid panicking and running out of air quickly. He emphasized their determination to escape and asked for a wire. Archer held the stick while Tom heated and used the wire to burn a hole in the thick wood above them. It was a slow process, and after missing the latch, they had to try again. Eventually, they encountered a metal obstruction, but Tom managed to free the latch. As they cautiously peeked outside, the night was serene with stars and a rising moon. The moonlight created eerie shadows in the vineyard, playing tricks on their eyes. Tom stealthily ventured out, but quickly dropped to the ground, signaling Archer to be cautious.|['1.

Archer was puzzled by the scene but cautiously went outside to the neighboring field, as Tom gestured. A calm cow, familiar to them, peacefully grazed under the moonlight. Archer, now relieved, joked about being startled by a cow and thanked Tom for suggesting they look for clues. As they carefully examined the ground for footprints, they noticed the open door of the stone kitchen, a surprise. Inside, they found an empty lamp-lit room. Moving silently, they explored further and discovered a grim sight: old Pierre lay dead with a severe head wound, and a soldier in a gray uniform lay nearby, shot in the temple. Archer picked up a helmet with a German coat-of-arms and a pistol, indicating a violent encounter. Tom searched the rooms but found no trace of Florette or her mother, leaving them with a sense of relief amidst the tragedy.|"[""1.

Tom believed that Florette was taken away by soldiers, possibly due to her father's actions. He thought she was bringing a soldier suit for one of them to wear. Tom felt sorry for her and vowed to fight harder in her memory. He reflected on the tragic situation of Florette being forced into labor by the enemy.

The boys were scared but stood still and quiet. Tom, calm, saw a German soldier in the distance. They were hidden, undetected. Tom strained to see more details but the soldier turned. The soldier's movements were precise, like clockwork. Tom saw a dark structure, maybe a guardhouse. He thought they might be near a secret path to the border. Tom remembered rumors of secret German roads to violate Swiss neutrality. He worried they were near one of these paths. They were on the edge of danger.

Tom observed a lone figure in the darkness and marveled at their precise movements. Despite the danger, the figure seemed like a mechanical toy. Suddenly, Tom noticed the figure dancing lightly. As he approached, he discovered a man hanging from a tree, wearing a German uniform. The man's eerie appearance made Tom search for clues but found none. Nearby, they found an observation balloon wreckage with useful supplies. Tom and Archer seized the opportunity to disguise themselves in German uniforms found in the wreckage. Despite the grim situation, the boys felt fortunate to have stumbled upon supplies that could aid their escape.|"['1.

""You're just like a tenderfoot when he starts out camping,"" said Tom.

At a critical juncture, faced with a decision between seeking refuge in Alsace or venturing into the secure mountain retreats, Tom, the astute scout, leaned towards the latter option. Surveying the landscape through a glass, Archer spotted a quaint white house with a thatched roof, enclosed by a rickety fence, where sheep grazed. This isolated dwelling sat at the end of a rustic lane, far from the nearby hamlet. Despite their hunger, the duo hesitated to approach, wary of the risks involved. Tom, displaying his scouting skills, decided to investigate further, considering the house's age and the likelihood of its inhabitants being French. Despite the looming darkness, Tom descended cautiously towards the house, carefully examining its details, including a peculiar flagpole bearing the German flag. With a mix of apprehension and determination, Tom scrutinized the flagpole, even collecting wooden splinters as evidence, showcasing his resourcefulness and courage in the face of potential danger.|['1.

Tom shared a fascinating story with his friend Archer. He described how a French carpenter at Temple Camp taught him unique carpentry techniques. The French carpenter stored nails up his sleeves and nailed shingles with four hits instead of two, a practice from working with hard wood shingles in France. Tom also learned about the cultural differences in Europe, like the placement of shutters on buildings. The French put hinges at the top, Italians on the left, and Americans on the right. Tom then connected the carving on a pole to French craftsmanship, noting the resemblance to a fleur-de-lis, a symbol often found in French designs. This story highlighted the influence of culture and tradition on craftsmanship.|"['1.

Archer's spirits sank as he voiced his fears, but Tom's knock on the door interrupted his gloomy thoughts. A frail old man, dressed in tattered clothes, cautiously opened the door. Despite his impoverished appearance, his sharp blue eyes studied the boys warily. Tom quickly reassured him, explaining their escape from a prison camp near the Alsace border. The old man, a former soldier who had lived in America, welcomed them warmly. He shared his meager food and revealed his sorrow over his sons' conscription into the German army. Suspicious of German soldiers, he expressed his disdain for their actions and predicted an invasion of Switzerland. Despite his age and humble circumstances, he maintained his independence and integrity, providing a safe haven for the boys in his remote dwelling.|"[""1.

The boys overheard a conversation about new roads leading suspiciously towards the Swiss border. The roads were said to be for innocent purposes like aiding German wounded and internal communication. However, an old man revealed a darker motive, suggesting the roads were a plan to betray Switzerland. He shared insights about a road from the trenches to the Rhine and how it connected to another road near his comrade's house. The old man emphasized the significance of a blue flag with a black spot to identify the house. He drew a rough map to illustrate the region, highlighting key locations in southern Alsace.

"The elderly man seemed a bit confused, but he turned back to his map. ""Here is the new road,"" he pointed with his shaky hand. ""It runs south from the Rhine road. You are quite clever, Yankee clever,"" he chuckled. ""Why would they build this road? They bring women from the north, from Leteur, to construct it. This is where Mam'selle is located, near my friend Blondel. It's a noble army of all women!"" Tom glanced at the map as old Melotte gestured above it, peering eagerly from his white hair. Although Tom wasn't well-versed in military matters, he deduced the road's purpose: to swiftly move troops from the Alsatian front to the Swiss border. The sudden enlistment of women for road construction seemed plausible. Could this lead to Florette Leteur's whereabouts? Tom's mind was set on rescuing her, despite the ramblings about Germany's intentions to violate Swiss neutrality.

Tom was faced with a choice between the open roads and the secluded hospitality of the lonesome heights. Opting for the latter, he believed the rugged mountains and dense woods held no enmity towards him. Despite the intimidating names of Baden and Schwarzwald, Tom felt a sense of belonging in the Black Forest.

The compass and flashlight, more prone to water damage than the glass, were protected in the other rubber glove as the two fugitives ventured into the dark river.

If only he had the strength to reach there... ""What you have to do, you do,"" he whispered, frowning at the compass in the darkness, trying to discern the direction.

He managed to stand up, despite his stiff knee, relieved to find he could walk. He thought his headache was due to shock and bruising, not illness. Except for Archer, he felt somewhat okay. Limping to the door, he saw a dreary, rainy day. He was on a rocky islet with a tower resembling a lighthouse. In the distance, a gray castle stood on the Baden side. He wished for a spy-glass to see better. He knew he couldn't find Florette Leteur. With Archer lost, he felt lonely. Hoping to swim to the Baden shore later, he nursed his knee.

Unexpectedly, he found Archibald Archer inside, whittling a stick. The tension dissolved into smiles as they recognized each other. Archer revealed a souvenir, an old net from the Rhine. They reflected on past events and discussed the geography around them. Tom expressed unease at the nearby houses on the Baden side, but they felt safe knowing the mountains offered refuge. Spending the day in the old tower, they pondered its history and its connection to the nearby castle, finding solace in their shared adventure.|['1.

Tom sat at the doorway, nursing his injured knee, and observed Archer cautiously navigating the sharp, slick rocks. Archer managed to corner and spear a few confused fish stranded by the troubled waters of the night in small crevices. After struggling with damp matches, they finally lit a fire using a broken door as a shield, hoping the smoke would blend with the mist. Despite the fish being German, Tom and Archer were open-minded. They improvised a grill with a broken stair rail and used a flashlight case as a cup. By evening, Tom's knee felt better, and they planned to swim to shore towards the mountains. However, spotting a boat with uniformed individuals from Alsace made them realize their luck had run out. Tom, feeling resigned, accepted their fate and the inevitable capture.|"['1.

As soon as they caught sight of the boys they paused aghast and seemed to be much more discomfited than either Tom or Archer. Evidently they had not come for the fugitives and the thought occurred to Archer that they might be fugitives themselves.

Tom, whose spirits revived at this rather puzzling turn of affairs, watched the two soldiers keenly and noticed that neither had sword or firearms. And he realized with chagrin that in those few moments of ""lost morale,"" he had been strangely unworthy of himself and of his scout training. And feeling so he let Archer do the talking.

Archer felt empowered as he faced off against the Huns, refusing to be intimidated by their demands. He asserted that they were equals in this situation, with each side having only their fists to rely on. Archer dismissed the idea of a treaty, emphasizing that the Huns needed to understand their place and not try to dictate terms.

"""That's one thing I learned from traveling around Europe since this war started,"" Archer shared. ""The foot soldiers are no good when they're alone. The officers might be fine, but the soldiers are dense. If I hadn't put that lord-high creature in his place, I would've humiliated him!"" Tom found Archer's colorful language amusing.

In all likelihood, he probably did. He was a bold and daring young boy who didn't show much respect for authority. Tom felt relieved when they reached the hills, fearing his friend might get into trouble with officials or German soldiers. They both learned about the importance of saluting in the German military system, where officers were highly regarded and soldiers had to salute even without permission. Guided by their compass, they journeyed southward through the hills, finally reaching a wooded plateau near the Swiss border. The air was fresh and fragrant, welcoming them to the serene depths of the Schwarzwald. As they walked south, the landscape was adorned with fir trees and the ground felt like a soft carpet. They encountered a quaint house nestled among firs, where a friendly Swiss man shared his wooden handiwork with them. The boys rested, feeling safe and far from the war, as they continued their journey towards the frontier.|['1.

Two friends found themselves in a peculiar situation as they decided to camp by a lake. They hung their coats on a branch and fell asleep. The night was warm, and the forest's magic air lulled them into a peaceful slumber. In the morning, they discovered their coats were missing, along with their spy-glass and compass. After a thorough search, they found their coats perfectly dry on a low branch. Bewildered, they wondered if the mysterious happenings were the work of supernatural beings. Determined to leave the strange place, they continued their journey, following wagon tracks. Eventually, they stumbled upon a toymaker's cottage, where they encountered more puzzling sights. The boys were left speechless, questioning the bizarre occurrences in the Black Forest.|"['1.

Tom suddenly had a bright idea to check his compass. To his surprise, they were heading north. Archer joked that maybe the Germans had taken the North Pole steel, causing the compass to point the wrong way. The boys managed to communicate to a local man that something was amiss near the lake. The man made gestures and pointed across the lake, indicating a floating island's nocturnal voyages. As they looked back, the Swiss toymaker was amused. They reached a village where they were mistaken for German soldiers but were given food. Tom contemplated their next move, debating between heading west to cross the river or continuing south towards Switzerland. He felt rescuing the girl was like a storybook adventure, unsure if it was romantic or crazy. Ultimately, they considered crossing into France for safety.|"['1.

Archer and Tom Slade were discussing their plan to rescue a French girl from German captors. Archer expressed his intention to invest his chance in saving her, inspired by the idea of giving to the Red Cross. Tom found humor in Archer's focus on souvenirs but agreed to join in the risky mission. They journeyed westward towards the Alsatian town of Norne, passing through rocky terrain with a view of the winding river and the city of Mulhausen. As they concealed themselves along the palisades, they spotted the old castle Melotte had mentioned. From their vantage point, they could see the vast expanse of southern Alsace, including the new road and a flag on a house.

Tom was thrilled as he held the glass with excitement. In the distant Alsatian countryside, a faint gray line stretched from north to south, appearing as insubstantial as a rainbow or dust in a sunbeam. To the north, it curved westward towards the mountains, seemingly fading into a gray mist before reaching them. This line symbolized the battleground where the fate of humanity hung in the balance. As darkness fell, they cautiously made their way to the riverbank, seeking a means to cross. Finding a float with boats attached, they adopted a strategy of stealth, emulating German soldiers to blend in. Tom emphasized the importance of embodying their roles to avoid suspicion. Successfully crossing the river, they confidently strode into the town of Norne, behaving brashly and arrogantly like true Germans, ensuring their disguise was convincing.|['1.

Tom forgot the scout rule to do a good turn daily and instead did a bad turn almost every minute. Despite this, he successfully navigated the streets of Norne with his friend Archer to find old Melotte's friend Blondel's home. They identified it by the billet flag Melotte had described. Tom's boldness, coupled with Madame Blondel's information, inspired him to embark on a daring mission that later brought him fame. Despite being occupied by German officers overseeing road construction, Madame Blondel remained defiant. She shared her past in America and her fondness for adventure.

Near the Swiss border, a perilous path stood guarded by Prussian bayonets.

Young women and girls toiled along this route, enduring harsh conditions under the iron fist of German militarism. Amid threats and exhaustion, they worked tirelessly, some with mutilated hands forced to haul stones. Living in tents and barracks, their respite was restless and fearful.
