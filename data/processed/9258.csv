In May, the children embarked on a grand adventure up a mountain instead of their usual winter play at Tanglewood. Led by Cousin Eustace, they climbed the hill with determination. The hill, though not as tall as Chimborazo or Mont Blanc, was a significant challenge for the young climbers. Eustace, with a hint of a mustache on his upper lip, was as playful and cheerful as ever, making the journey enjoyable for the children. The day was perfect, with violets and other flowers adorning their path. As they ventured into the woods, they encountered columbines, wild geraniums, and the sweet scent of strawberries.
