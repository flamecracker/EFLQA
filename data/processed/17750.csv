The following day, a large picnic party was held for the elders, with Sydney, Loo, and Lena in attendance. The younger children, along with their nurse, Baby, and other servants, had the day to themselves. Walter found it rather dull, thinking about a wheel in a stream and wondering if Sydney had put it away. Despite wanting to go see, he never had the chance. While in the kitchen garden, Johnny lamented the end of strawberry season, and Madge searched in vain for gooseberries. Walter, however, couldn't shake off the fear of the elder-bush by the wall after what Sydney had told him. When Madge lost her coral necklace, Walter, feeling a sense of importance, went to look for it, trying to avoid the dreaded elder-bush. As he approached, he saw the necklace but was startled by a white figure reaching out from the bushes. Overwhelmed with fear, he tripped, fell, and lost consciousness. Sydney's mother found him and waited for the doctor to assess his injury.|"['1.

Sydney saw his mother's worried expression and the small figure on the bed. He understood why Walter was scared and felt guilty for scaring him. Sydney's conscience reminded him that he had wanted to frighten Walter, knowing he was timid. As Walter recovered, Sydney helped him and explained the water-wheel improvements. Sydney realized he needed to show consideration and kindness to those smaller and weaker than himself. This realization sparked true manliness in him. Later, their cousin Charlie visited, but he quickly grew bored. When Charlie got stuck in a tree due to a dog, he learned a lesson about being greedy. On Dan's birthday, they had a party in the woods, but Dan, the dog, was left out and got nothing to eat.

When they arrived at the Dale Farm, a warm welcome awaited them. The mother and her old nurse chatted animatedly before indulging in a delightful tea in the quaint farm-parlour, savoring honey, cream, and hot scones. The next morning, the children awoke to the sounds of crowing cocks and clucking hens, a novelty for them. After breakfast, they explored the farm, meeting their ponies who seemed overjoyed to hear their voices in this new setting. They observed Mrs. Farmer feeding the lively poultry, creating a cacophony among the turkeys, geese, ducks, and hens. The calves also received their share of attention. The children then prepared for a ride across the common, a vast area where they could canter and gallop freely. The common was bustling with donkeys and geese, with Patch amusing himself by chasing the geese until they hissed back at him. The common was a playground for village children, where they engaged in various activities like chasing butterflies and playing games.
