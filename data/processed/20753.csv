George, Harry, and a Professor were shipwrecked on an island a year ago. The island was home to savage tribes. With no defense or supplies, they relied on nature. The Professor, wise and resourceful, taught the boys how to create tools and necessities. They discovered wild vegetables, cereals, and fibers for clothing. They made a water wheel, sawmill, loom, and wagon using primitive tools. They even crafted pistols and guns. The boys explored the island, encountering mysterious lights and signs of human life. They built a boat, but it vanished and was found later with added oars and rope. They found a captive's distress note, leading them to investigate a pirates' cave. A man with lost memory joined them. The boys' journey continued, aided by Angel, a baby orangutan they had raised.|['1.

The scene before them was filled with excitement. For the first time since they arrived, they spotted savages. It was clear that the group they saw was about to encounter a hostile tribe. Although their plan was to head west to the large stream known as West River, they decided to stay put in their current campsite to better assess the native's intentions. The journey through the dense forest had been challenging, but they emerged just in time to head towards the river where the land was more open. They believed their sturdy wagon, equipped with high sides and guns, would provide better defense than the forest. As they cautiously moved forward, the Professor emphasized the importance of staying together, keeping watch day and night, and being prepared for any unexpected events.|"['1.

The Professor faced a challenge in explaining the situation to John. Using a chart, he illustrated the tributary stream they camped by, its flow to the West River, and the location where the wrecked boat landed. As the defeated tribe retreated towards their camp, the Professor advised readiness. The approaching savages, resembling North American Indians, carried short spears and bows without arrows. The victorious group, surprised by the wagon, turned back towards the Professor's party. The Professor, armed, emerged, signaling the boys to aim low and stay calm. A volley was fired, wounding several attackers who retreated with their injured. The savages, startled, fled back across the stream. The Professor prepared for another round, but the savages, shaken, hurried away with their wounded.|"['1.

The Professor and his companions were in a tense situation. They had just fought off one group of savages and now faced another lurking nearby. Despite the Professor's attempts to beckon them closer, the savages remained hesitant, keeping their distance. The group had taken precautions by positioning themselves strategically near the river for water and using the wagon as a fort. As night fell, they prepared for a possible attack, wary of poisoned arrows. When a disturbance was sensed, they remained vigilant, with John alerting the others to movement near the forest. A gunshot from John startled the approaching savages, causing them to retreat momentarily. The group's readiness and quick thinking kept them safe as they braced for a potential night battle.|"['1.

John returned to the wagon and picked up the second gun automatically. The Professor comforted him, then went back out. This time, he boldly walked towards the edge of the clearing. The Professor told Harry to stop him, but he ignored the advice. John was right; they were spotted without a doubt. They dashed across the open space upon being seen, avoiding the initial shots. The rush stopped, and they disappeared into the brush, saving their ammunition. The next morning, three figures were seen in the clearing, but the savages were nowhere to be found. John approached them, taking their weapons and searching their clothing. He found items that differed from each other, indicating they were from different tribes. The group decided to head south to rescue their captured friends, hoping to encounter the savages for more information.|"['1.

After breakfast, the yaks were ready, and the descent began. Angel, swinging ahead, suddenly alarmed from the treetops. George called him down and they moved forward cautiously. Soon, savages appeared, working their way towards them. The Professor signaled for peace, but the savages continued their advance. The wagon was turned to face them, and the team, Jack and Jill, were driven swiftly to safety. Guns were readied as the savages approached. The Professor instructed to aim for the leaders. When the attack came, they fired, taking down four savages. Another charge was repelled with precision. The leader fell, and the savages retreated. The group stood their ground, ready for any further assaults. The Professor's calm guidance had saved them from the imminent danger.|"['1.

"At two shots, a fifth of their fighters were injured. ""Charge now,"" the Professor said, and John, understanding, leaped first. The savages fled, but some tried to take the wounded chief. Before one could shoot, John aimed his gun, but the native left. The boys, guided by the Professor, charged, shouting. They were told not to go far. The wounded chief was helped back to the wagon. His legs were injured, making him immobile. The boys assisted, and the Professor bandaged his wounds. The savage was surprised by the care. When the savages returned, they seemed ready to fight again. The chief was placed in view to deter them. The Professor signaled to the chief, warning of consequences if attacked. The savages left, and the boys found a photo of men from the ship that sank."|['1.

"George and Harry were both in the picture and were identified. This was the crucial link needed for their meeting with the chief. When the picture was shown to the chief, he was asked to compare George and Harry with the individuals in the image. The chief was astonished as he recognized the resemblance. The boys were thrilled by this remarkable discovery. Despite searching the fallen men's pockets, no connection was found. Only a few items of value were discovered in the chief's pockets. A match safe with the initials ""J L V"" caught their attention. John's reaction to the match safe was striking. The chief, when shown the match safe, did not recognize John. Preparations were made to guard against a possible night attack and the chief was securely bound. The profusion of human hair in the attire indicated a custom of decoration. The custom of scalping was discussed, shedding light on the significance of hair in their culture."|"[""1.

Before dawn, Angel grew restless, signaling the possible return of savages. As the sun rose, no immediate threat was seen. Preparing for travel south, the group felt safer with a chief in their custody. Suddenly, Harry spotted a mass of approaching enemies. The yaks were directed north to face the threat. The chief was placed in view to deter the attackers. Over a hundred warriors closed in, shooting arrows at the wagon. The Professor shot one of the chiefs, slowing the pursuit. A running battle ensued. The group aimed to reach the river, but the yaks veered northwest. With each shot, the attackers kept their distance, protecting the yaks. The intense chase lasted for miles, taking a toll on the animals. Despite the danger, the group remained vigilant and strategic in defending themselves.|"['1.

There was a lot of movement among the enemy. Most of them gathered near some bushes ahead and to the right. Harry tried to guide the team to the left, but they were too excited to listen. The Professor sensed that the quietness of the savages meant trouble. He called George to the front in anticipation of an attack. The yaks instinctively turned left, avoiding danger. The savages rushed forward in anger but were close enough for accurate shots. The team, exhausted, reached a river, providing protection. The animals were wounded but cared for. They found themselves in a defensible position on a narrow strip of land. Ammunition was running low, causing concern. As night fell, the enemy moved closer, prompting a few warning shots. The attackers retreated after being fired upon. George noted how fear drives human actions, even in the face of danger. John ventured towards the Indian camp during the night, a move met with silent approval.|"['1.

"Upon his return, Harry noticed various objects that he brought back and was surprised to see they were the unique headdresses worn by the attacking group. He found it strange that John would keep these items as souvenirs. When the Professor examined them, he was intrigued and remarked, ""This is valuable information."" The Professor discovered that their recent foes were a different tribe from the ones they initially encountered. This revelation meant they now had to consider three distinct groups during their explorations. The boys were unsure if this news complicated matters or provided a solution. The natives were at war with each other and with them, adding to the challenge. The Professor praised John's intuition for uncovering this crucial information. His exceptional skills, caution, and calm demeanor in difficult times earned him the boys' admiration. The Professor hinted that John might be developing a dual personality due to memory loss and a new beginning. The boys were left pondering the significance of memory and its role in defining humanity. The group decided on a cautious approach as they faced an increasing besieging force, knowing they couldn't ford the wide rivers surrounding them. Despite the looming threat, they remained vigilant through the night, prepared for any potential attacks."|"['1.

During the early evening, the Professor devised a clever plan to outsmart the savages. He proposed building a raft from logs to help the yaks carry the wagon across the river. With John's help, they gathered driftwood and constructed a small raft. Quietly, they cut logs further away to avoid detection. They floated the logs down the river, tied them to the raft, and poled it across. The yaks were then yoked up and led to the river. Harry and the team worked together to float the wagon on the logs. The Professor and George disguised the wagon to deceive the savages. With Harry's guidance, the yaks successfully crossed the river, and the group moved inland to throw off the enemy's pursuit. Tired but relieved, they found a hiding spot to rest and keep an eye on their foes.|['1.

When the sun rose, the savages guarded the sham wagon at their old campsite. The boys found humor in the situation, with George wanting to go down to the river to laugh at them. By nine o'clock, the ruse remained undiscovered, delighting the Professor and the boys. The captive, amused by the situation, showed no signs of malice. The Professor's care for him seemed to foster a bond. As they prepared to leave, the group pondered their next move. The chief's reactions to different directions puzzled them. Soon, they witnessed a battle between different tribes on the island, revealing the presence of multiple groups. The victorious tribe's search for victims showcased the island's complex dynamics.|"['1.

The boys were surprised by the sudden news. The low ammunition due to intense fighting made them see the wisdom in the decision. As the yaks headed north, the chief's warning glance was ignored, later proving significant. Traveling over rough terrain, the team moved slowly. Approaching small huts, the party was noticed by the tribal village. The locals appeared different and armed. The Professor noticed the lack of ammunition among the villagers and their unconventional use of firearms. The villagers attacked with arrows, prompting the party to defend themselves. The warriors fled after being outmatched. The boys, John, and the Professor chased them, reaching a large hut. Inside, they celebrated, mimicking the savages' cries. The Professor cautiously called out to inquire who was inside.|"[""1.

Two American boys, captured by savages, were found tied up in a corner, weak and filthy. Rescued by George and Harry, they wept in gratitude. The Professor and John, cautious of lurking savages, hurried the boys to safety. The rescued boys revealed the savages were nearby, armed with old guns used as charms. As the savages approached, the Professor devised a plan to defend their position. Dividing into three groups, the savages aimed to surround them. The Professor instructed his team to fire carefully and deliberately, targeting one group at a time to create confusion. With the boys trained to handle the guns, they prepared for a strategic defense against the encircling savages.|"['1.

The necessary precautions were taken with the new recruits. The two firing squads were set up with the Professor, George, and one boy on one side, and John, Harry, and another boy on the other. The wagon was strategically positioned near large trees for defense. Despite being vulnerable from all sides, they were prepared for any attack. The flanking parties circled around and, upon a signal, a rush was made. The Professor ordered the first volley, taking down three attackers. The besieged group remained calm, ready to defend with ten shots and close-range weapons. As night approached, the decision was made to move to the river for safety. The Professor and John stood guard as the wagon departed, causing confusion among their enemies. The group made their way towards the river, keeping a watchful eye on approaching figures.|"['1.

"It seems like we managed to outsmart them, at least for now. This delay will give us a head start, so let's hurry. Head towards the hill I pointed out earlier. If they realize we're gone and gather their forces, we might use the steep side of the hill for cover. But remember, our goal is the river.""No need to push. On the way, they crossed a second stream. Harry instructed a boy, ""Bring some copper kettles from the wagon and fill them with water. If we're delayed at the hill, the yaks will need it, as well as us."" George and the boys understood the importance. Despite the rescued boys' weakness, they carried the filled kettles to the wagon, and George secured the lids. In less than ten minutes, they reached the hill, which was easy to climb. On the southern side, facing the river less than a mile away, a steep, brownish-gray rock wall provided protection. The wagon was parked behind the rocky wall, and Harry's first priority was to water the animals, who hadn't drunk along the way. They waited for an hour until the Professor and John appeared. George retraced their trail to find them lurking nearby. The wagon's safety relieved them.

When the wagon was reached, everyone was warned not to waste ammunition as they had very little left. The savages positioned themselves far beyond the gun range, using the open space for protection. George and Harry noticed John and the Professor urging a sudden departure from the cave for another reason. They couldn't see the approaching savages and observed the two men exchanging looks when the savages appeared. With no time for questions, they wondered if an attack was imminent. New groups approached from the rear, indicating reinforcements were on the way. Despite the grave situation, the Professor remained composed. Ralph shared a story about their past, detailing a shipwreck and survival at sea. Tom and Ralph were companions on the ill-fated _Investigator_, but due to their condition, recognition was difficult.|"['1.

Yes, I was going to mention that. We were hungry and walked along the shoreline, then moved inland where we found unfamiliar vegetables and berries. We ate quickly but later heard voices and saw a group of nearly naked savages dragging a captive. We were terrified. These savages have distinguishing features like a row of shells and colored bands, along with dark brown hair. They capture enemies for their hair to make head ornaments. We traveled west from the mountains, resting by a stream. We fell ill from berries, then found nuts and sweet potatoes. We lost track of time, distance, and direction, aiming to go north but ended up south. We evaded capture for months, stumbling upon a savage camp sacrificing a victim, which might have been a captive from another tribe. Sacrifices occur at specific times, and we feared the unknown fate that awaited us.|['1.

The teacher interrupted, explaining how different cultures commemorate events historically. For instance, the Israelites kept a brazen serpent as a memory in the ark. In early church times, memories were celebrated. The narrative then shifted to a daring escape by captives who evaded enemies but faced starvation. Desperate for food, they entered a village, which led to capture. However, a transformation in their appearance postponed their sacrifice due to the natives' superstitions. The captives were treated kindly, given liberty, and eventually escaped. They encountered a different tribe and boldly demanded food, surprising them with a watch that caused fear and led to a feast. The captives were welcomed by the tribe, given bows and arrows, and integrated into their group. Yet, they were eventually captured by hostile forces, narrowly escaping sacrifice.|['1.

The group of people, including the Professor, Harry, John, and others, were in a tense situation as they faced the threat of savages. Despite the late hour, no one had retired as they discussed plans for their security. John took it upon himself to scout the area and returned with news that there were no immediate dangers nearby. The group decided to silently move along the riverbed to avoid confrontation. John's idea of building a raft to cross the stream was quickly embraced by the Professor. With the help of the boys, they gathered driftwood and constructed a raft. To their surprise, there was no sign of the savages during their preparations. Eventually, the raft was successfully launched with the help of the yaks, and the group managed to cross the river safely.|"['1.

The group successfully crossed the stream with the wagon, leaving the logs behind. They continued their journey cautiously in the dark until they reached a secluded campsite. The Professor, noticing the absence of the natives, explained that the steep sides of the shore indicated a deep channel where the wagon had crossed. The tribe, expecting the wagon's arrival, had scouts waiting. The group enjoyed a feast after the natives retreated, with the chief showing delight at their river crossing trick. The boys were intrigued by Red Angel, a highly intelligent orangutan traveling with them. Despite debating the warrior's fate, they decided to bring him along for his safety.

After the meal, the group continued their journey. Harry, always looking out for his team, wanted to find water for them. They were confident they would soon come across some streams in the area. As they walked, Ralph and Tom, feeling free, enjoyed their time outside the wagon, even racing with Angel. Ralph was tall and strong, while Tom was shorter and stockier. Both boys were well-educated, having graduated from high school. Tom, observant like George, recognized the surroundings and asked if they had been there before. They moved slowly through the country, exploring the land and its resources. By evening, they reached a small stream, a perfect spot to camp.

The journey through the forest was leisurely, with frequent stops to explore the surroundings. After being rescued, the boys regained their strength with good food and a sense of peace. Ralph brought fruits and vegetables, including a plant with rubber-producing properties. The Professor identified a plant with leaves resembling human faces, used as charms by natives. As they neared the Cataract, Harry and George were eager to move forward. John's improvement in alertness delighted everyone. The boys were amazed when John and the Professor exchanged respectful greetings, showing John's progress.

Angel quickly moved from the rafters into the kitchen, exploring every nook and cranny without pause. His boyish curiosity led him to the water wheel, inspecting it thoroughly while the other boys followed with excitement. Tom marveled at Angel's creations and regretted not realizing their proximity earlier. The group then visited the shop, where Angel's ingenuity shone as he playfully spun the grindstone. The boys were awestruck when they reached the laboratory, seeing skeletons from the cave. The Professor emphasized the importance of appreciation and spirit over mere knowledge.

The Professor discussed the need for well-designed homes rather than haphazard structures. He emphasized the importance of comfort and aesthetics. The Chief, recovering from his wounds, was introduced to crutches by Harry, which fascinated him. The Chief's curiosity extended to the workings of the household, especially the milling of flour and baking of bread. His keen interest in these processes surprised everyone. Through interactions with the Professor and the group, the Chief began to learn words and understand basic concepts. Tom and Harry bonded over mechanical work, while Ralph and George were eager explorers, always asking questions and seeking adventure.

One evening, George surprised everyone by bringing out his homemade violin. This unexpected gesture led to more surprises. Red Angel, the dog, immediately sat by George's feet. Tom, who also knew how to play the violin, offered to help build a bass viol. Not to be outdone, Ralph volunteered to make a flute. The music from the violin intrigued Chief, who initially found it puzzling. The Professor explained that music is not always understood by all cultures, as some only recognize noise. He shared that dancing and music were historically linked in many societies, including ancient Jewish traditions. Dance and music were integral to religious ceremonies and festivities. Different cultures showcase their unique dance characteristics, much like various dances from different countries worldwide. The boys settled in for the night, enjoying a peaceful rest after weeks of adventure. The next morning, they were greeted by Red Angel, who seemed eager to leave.|"['1.

In the morning, the Professor gathered everyone together and proposed dividing tasks to ensure good living and pleasure. He emphasized four essential aspects: replenishing vegetables, securing meat, tending the garden, and making clothing. John received surplus goods and noticed the need for new clothing. Footwear became a priority, and John got to work making shoes. George and Ralph decided to restock ramie fiber and hunt game. Meanwhile, Harry and Tom worked on the garden overrun with weeds. The group also prepared for future expeditions by making weapons and ammunition from available copper and lead. Angel amused everyone by parading in George's jacket. The Professor discovered new minerals, including a reddish ore with mercury potential. The party discussed converting the ore into mercury compounds for various uses.|['1.

One day, the Professor gathered the boys and revealed the weekly tradition of hunting or recreation. Ralph suggested visiting Observation Hill to see the flag they had made. Excitedly, the group set off fully prepared, with George proudly carrying a stick resembling a gun. As they gazed at the vast sea, their thoughts wandered. Heading east, they meandered along the beach until Harry proposed continuing to South River. The boys, influenced by the Professor's teachings, scrutinized every detail keenly. Tom remarked on their perpetual curiosity instilled by the Professor, leading to many discoveries. Standing at the cape overlooking the south, they recalled past adventures, including finding a lifeboat and encountering huts. The boys shared their encounters with the Professor, reflecting on the savages' possessiveness and the importance of property even among the less fortunate.|"['1.

Recreation is essential for refreshing our strength and spirits. Taking a holiday where you accomplish something and have fun is the key to solving the challenges of modern life. The telescope is a vital tool for surveying, allowing us to see farther and with greater accuracy. It also has a scale that shows angles, making measurements precise and efficient. The boat house was a place they visited last, as they were busy with various activities. Harry suggested sailing as a fun outing, and all agreed to prepare the lifeboat. Chief, who was gradually learning their ways, showed interest in the boat shed and impressed everyone with his spear-throwing skills. The boys learned the technique from him, amazed by his accuracy.|"['1.

The professor saved the day by teaching the boys about javelin throwing. He explained the right way to hold and throw different types of javelins, emphasizing the importance of a firm grip and proper technique. This lesson brought the Chief closer to the boys and sparked his interest. The boys gifted the Chief a bolo, which made him very happy. They later took him to the woods to cut down a tree using the bolo. The Chief was thrilled to use the tool and help with the process. The boys also gave him brass balls, knowing that round objects are appealing to many people. The professor and the boys discussed making a surveying instrument, highlighting the importance of accurate calculations and observations.

To explain the distance between the moon and a fixed star, drawings of the sky are essential. The first sketch, Fig. 13, depicts the northern hemisphere, while the second, Fig. 14, shows the southern hemisphere. Fixed stars are named and categorized by magnitude. The loss of a boat at South River had troubled Harry and George, prompting a plan to recover it with the Professor's support. However, repairing the damaged boat for a journey seemed impractical due to the extent of damage. Despite this setback, the group prepared for a hunting trip with guns, ammunition, spears, and bolos. As they journeyed, they made good progress, covering about forty to fifty miles in two days. A sudden encounter with an animal led to a swift response and a surprising turn of events.|"['1.

Unfortunately, the wagon's direction pointed towards the river, a path they couldn't risk taking to avoid detection. So, they silently pushed the wagon back, then headed south, circled towards the river, and then north to throw off their pursuers. Harry, the leader, advised waiting for the right shot and not to use reserve guns unless necessary. After hitting their targets, the boys hid and planned to mislead the savages by driving the wagon eastward over rough terrain. They tricked their pursuers into following them while the wagon took a different path. After a tense chase, the boys managed to outsmart the savages and avoid a confrontation, eventually reaching the safety of the river, relieved to have outwitted their pursuers.|"['1.

Harry, George, and their friends faced a challenging task. They needed to cross the river to reach the boat without being spotted by potential pursuers. After much discussion, they decided on a plan. George proposed that one person guard the rear while the others stayed close to the wagon. This way, they could avoid running into their pursuers and keep track of any trailing signs. As they searched for a safe spot to camp, they finally settled near the river at dusk. They took precautions to protect their wagon and livestock, with two people keeping watch throughout the night. The next morning, they prepared to leave but noticed their enemies approaching. Quickly, they crossed the river, surprising the natives. They then devised a plan to hide and observe the enemy's movements. Despite the risks, they were determined to secure the boat and outwit their pursuers.|"[""1.

The savages were in a frenzy, causing Ralph and Tom confusion. They decided on a plan: pretend to retreat west, then head north to cross the river and hurry home. Harry suggested two stay back to mislead the savages while the rest crossed the river. Ralph and Harry volunteered to stay back. The group, with the wagon, went north, circled east, and reached the river. They hid, gathered driftwood, and crossed the river. They recognized the trail, which was rough. They traveled about fifteen miles by night, straining the animals and wagon. They rested briefly, continued at dawn, and reached the forest edge by evening. They felt relieved but stayed vigilant. The group evaded the savages, pleased with their escape. The Professor was understanding about losing the boat. George tried to navigate using stars but needed more practice.

Angel's playful behavior caught the attention of the group. He had been on the floor during the music performance but vanished soon after. Holding his toy gun, he darted between chairs, aiming and dodging as if in a battle with invisible foes. His antics mirrored the boys' actions from the previous week, evoking laughter. Unfazed by the amusement, Angel climbed to the rafters, mimicking past warnings before hiding behind a chair. The boys inquired about John and Chief. John welcomed them back, while Chief, observing, extended a friendly hand. Chief's curiosity and learning process intrigued the group. His interest in tools and the workshop, especially the grindstone, delighted him. The boys were excited about the new calf on the cattle range, adding to their domesticated herd and milk supply for butter-making.|"['1.

Chief, a character on the island, had a peculiar habit of eating clay from the clay banks. The Professor, curious about this behavior, observed Chief and found it intriguing. The Professor recalled instances of tribes in various parts of the world, like South America and Eastern Asia, consuming clay without apparent ill effects. Harry, one of the characters, followed Chief to the clay bank and witnessed him eating the clay, which left Harry feeling disgusted. The group debated whether to disclose the existence of a cave and its treasure to the other boys on the island. The Professor, initially hesitant, later agreed to share the treasure among them. The boys were eager to explore the cave further and create a map of its interior. The Professor suggested they proceed with their exploration independently.

The boys retrieved the lamps and returned to the house, surprising the Professor with their early return. However, he didn't mention it to them. The island provided an abundance of nuts, especially Brazil nuts, used for lamp oil. Gathering them at the right time was crucial to prevent rancidity. George inquired about this, and the Professor explained how nature protects products like nuts. The colony depended on prairie chickens for eggs. The Professor shared a method to test egg freshness by observing how they behave in water. The construction of a new building with four rooms was in progress. During the construction, John had an accident, and Chief carried him to the house for medical attention. The night was restless with everyone concerned for John's well-being.

I was lucky to work with a captain who stood out from the rest. He used to be a teacher and took me under his wing when he saw my interest in his vast library. I went from a dull routine to helping him on the ship. I improved my writing skills and managed the ship's records during our voyage to China.

I was on a mission, not to hunt living men, but to uncover the secrets of those who had passed away eons ago. Unfortunately, the jungle fever struck us, and when we emerged from the forest, my companion succumbed to the illness. Alone once more, I set sail for New York. There, a friend, Jim Stratton, suggested a job as a philosophy professor on a ship training school, knowing my love for work. Despite my frail health, I accepted. However, before the ship's departure, I fell ill again. After recovering, I headed to California for a change in climate.

They had reached the recess, and George suggested examining the entire cave, with Ralph leading the way. The calcareous deposit covered everything in white. Near the chests with copper vessels, a stark contrast emerged. After carefully replacing the coins, Harry proposed further exploration. He moved right, Tom and the boys following closely. At the spot where the Professor had placed them, five skeletons appeared, shocking the group. The skeletons, some with knives in their ribs and one with a bullet in the skull, presented a horrifying sight. The group had left the skeletons, treasure, and weapons untouched in the cave's other part, never informing the Professor of their secret visit. As they moved around a wall, a strange sound from the second chamber startled them. A hollow laugh followed by two hearty laughs greeted them as the Professor and John emerged. John praised the boys' bravery against unseen enemies. Later, John shared details about another cave with hidden treasure, leading to further discussions.|['1.
