"Their muscles, accustomed to outdoor activities, bravely answered the challenge. Passing Frank and then Allen, who gazed at them blankly, the boys were not believers in miracles. Yet, they summoned their remaining strength and surged forward until they once again matched the girls. The finish line loomed ahead. Now, they faced the final, crucial sprint. Could they do it? They had to! The girls' minds echoed with the determination. The goal was within reach, they couldn't lose, they just couldn't!Conway leaned in eagerly as the swimmers raced towards the mark. Four hands grasped the fallen tree trunk almost simultaneously--but not quite. Mollie reached the finish line a fraction of a second ahead, claiming victory.

Anita and the Outdoor Girls had to leave as it was getting late. Anita explained that her parents worry when she's out, even with her brother. The following week was filled with fun. They enjoyed the perfect weather, went on the ferryboat, drove around, and had fun fishing. The only dampener was the mysterious cave they couldn't find.

"""Hush!"" Allen exclaimed, and they fell silent, barely daring to breathe. From the cave's entrance, faint but unmistakable, came the murmur of voices--voices speaking a language the group recognized. It was clear - the gypsies were at their hideout! The youngsters held their breath as the gypsies entered, now moving silently. In the dim cave light, their faces were obscured, but the leading gypsy's bent figure hinted at the leader from before. They moved quietly, like cats. As the girls' eyes adjusted to the darkness, they realized the gypsies weren't hunchbacked but carried packs on their backs. The gypsies placed the packs on the ground and vanished before the group could react. ""No, they won't,"" Will declared, assuming authority. ""We need to inform the authorities immediately,"" he urged. Allen agreed, eager to inspect the bags' contents. As he opened a bag, they were astonished by the treasure inside - gold, silver, beads, and trinkets of all kinds. Will left to find help, urging the others to guard the loot. The group ate lunch nervously, eyes darting between the cave and the gypsies' possible return."|"[""1.

Betty cheerfully disagreed, saying they could still find him even though he wasn't sewn up in a bag and placed in a dark cave. Mr. Mendall shared that they mostly stuck to the shore and the paths were broad. After expressing gratitude for the help, Mr. Mendall and his men left with the bags, leaving four behind to watch for the gypsies. Mollie couldn't wait to know what was in the bags.
