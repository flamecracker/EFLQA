"""Oh, ones patterned after the Buzzard sell for $25,000,"" was the reply; ""and if that machine wins this race, of course, it will give the mysterious manufacturer a tremendous prestige. But I think at that,"" he broke off with a merry smile, ""that the Golden Eagle II is going to prove more than the Buzzard's match.""

""I mean the space in which an aeroplane makes its preliminary run, as you might call it, before it takes the air,"" rejoined the boy. ""You see the rules of the race are that we fly from here to the Harrowbrook Club--a distance of twenty miles, alight there and refill our gasolene tanks, drink a cup of coffee in the club-house and then rise up once more and fly back.""

""Yes, father. You see, while we did it all right this afternoon, on the day of the race there will be a lot of 'planes all on the ground at the same time, and it's going to make it more difficult. However, I daresay we shall be able to manage it all right.""

After a little more talk the elder Chesters drove off, as the boys had decided to sleep in their aerodrome that night, on the two camp cots they had provided for such emergencies. They intended to get an early start in the morning, on another practice sail, as at that hour there was usually little wind.

Billy suggested that if they had time, they could visit Bluewater Bill to discuss the possibility of going after treasure. He mentioned that if they decided to pursue the adventure, they wouldn't need to sail into the Sargasso Sea. Frank, the inventive thinker, was intrigued by the idea of modifying an airplane to float on water. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, Sanborn, the mechanic, overheard their conversation and seemed to be plotting something. As the boys prepared their aircraft, the scene was bustling with other contestants testing their engines. The air was filled with the smell of gasoline and the sound of engines revving. Despite the risks involved, Frank and Harry focused on inspecting their aircraft to ensure everything was in order before taking off for their flight.|"['1.

Billy observed the boys as they settled into their seats on the aircraft. Harry sat near the engine, while Frank took the position at the steering wheel, managing the rudders and rearward steering surface. Frank's foot was on the brake, which automatically cut off the spark, and the other foot was on the foot pump for lubrication issues. Harry jokingly mentioned the lack of space for passengers, but offered Billy a spot beside him. The mechanics prepared the aircraft for takeoff, and as the propellers spun, the engine roared to life. The aircraft shook with power, and the propellers whirled with force. Frank signaled for release, and the aircraft shot forward, climbing into the sky. The crowd cheered as the aircraft soared, with others attempting flights but only the Golden Eagle and Buzzard drawing attention. Malvoise, flying the Buzzard, followed the boys closely, attempting to imitate their maneuvers. However, as the Buzzard encountered engine trouble and smoke, Malvoise skillfully guided the aircraft down safely.|"[""1.

The crowd rushed towards the disabled aeroplane, the Buzzard, as a big touring car honked its way through the plain towards them. An old man, with gray hair peeking out from his chin, and a motoring mask covering his face like a goggle-eyed frog, emerged from the car. He was determined that the Buzzard must win to promote his aeroplane business. The old man, Eben Joyce, revealed to the French aviator, Malvoise, that he was the inventor tricked by Luther Barr into giving away his designs. As the Buzzard prepared to take flight again, Eben Joyce shared his story of betrayal with Malvoise, revealing the injustice he faced. The scene was filled with tension as the crowd listened intently to their conversation, eager to uncover the truth behind the Buzzard's designs.|"[""1.

"Moreover, I would not suggest mentioning Barr's name as the Buzzards' manufacturer. He is involved in a business deal where being seen as an aeroplane speculator could be detrimental. If he discovers that you are revealing his secrets, he will cause trouble for you. Were you sent to Bellevue yesterday?"" The old man replied, ""Yes, but I was quickly released. A doctor, moved by my story, gave me money to come here today to seek Luther Barr. Although he doesn't legally owe me, I hoped to convince him to support me until I perfect my new aircraft balancing device."" The old man's eyes gleamed with pride at his invention. Ignoring his daughter's touch, he expressed his hopes for the innovation. Malvoise interrupted, calling inventors crazy dreamers. The daughter intervened, suggesting they return to the city. Amidst the commotion, the Golden Eagle appeared above. Frank and his team helped the old man, Eben Joyce, who was then taken to the hospital. His daughter departed for New York, and the boys prepared to accompany Billy Barnes to Bluewater Bill's cottage.

Frank and Harry were on their way to the village when they heard a car approaching. They stepped aside as Luther Barr, a familiar face, zoomed past them. Barr had recognized the boys and had a plan to thwart theirs. The boys continued walking and reached a meadow with whale bones as decorations leading to a neat cottage. Inside, they found a room filled with sea curiosities. After a visit to the kitchen, they were served a delicious meal by Bluewater Bill. The boys were eager to hear about Bill's discovery of a lost treasure galleon in the Sargasso Sea. Bill shared his tale of misfortune at sea, including encounters with storms and a near shipwreck.

For two days, a fierce storm battered the ship, tossing it like a toy. The lone sailor aboard was lost, unsure of his destination. Fear gripped him, fearing the fate of his comrades. After the storm calmed, Bluewater Bill found himself adrift in the Sargasso Sea, a place of eerie tales. Spotting a distant ship, he rowed towards it, only to find it crewed by skeletons. Despite the shock, he explored the ship and discovered chests filled with treasures. As he investigated further, a menacing bird caught his attention, its haunting cry echoing across the silent sea.|"['**Question 1:**\nWhere was Bluewater Bill found after the storm calmed down?\nA) In a bustling port\nB) In the Sargasso Sea\nC) In a deserted island\nD) In a hidden cove\nE) In a bustling city', '**Question 2:**\nWhat did Bluewater Bill discover on the distant ship he rowed towards?\nA) A crew of living sailors\nB) A treasure map\nC) Chests filled with treasures\nD) A deserted vessel\nE) A broken compass', '**Question 3:**\nHow did Bluewater Bill feel when he saw the crew of skeletons on the ship?\nA) Excited\nB) Relieved\nC) Shocked\nD) Indifferent\nE) Angry', '**Question 4:**\nWhat was the mood of the sea after the storm calmed down?\nA) Chaotic\nB) Calm\nC) Mysterious\nD) Joyful\nE) Energetic', '**Question 5:**\nWhat was the reaction of Bluewater Bill upon hearing the haunting cry of the menacing bird?\nA) He ignored it\nB) He rowed away quickly\nC) He investigated further\nD) He called for help\nE) He fell asleep', ""**Question 6:**\nWhat was Bluewater Bill's emotional state when he was lost at sea during the storm?\nA) Confident\nB) Fearful\nC) Excited\nD) Relaxed\nE) Hopeful""]"|['** B) In the Sargasso Sea', '** C) Chests filled with treasures', '** C) Shocked', '** B) Calm', '** C) He investigated further', '** B) Fearful']
Bluewater Bill, a sailor stranded in the Sargasso Sea, found hope in a visiting bird, estimating he was near land. Filling his pockets with coins and giving the dead a sea-burial, he planned his escape. Remembering a launch for South America on board, with a unique propeller to navigate shallow rivers, Bill devised a daring plan. He uncrated the launch, using the ship's engine for fuel. After stocking provisions, he faced the challenge of getting the launch overboard. With sailor ingenuity, he rigged a system to lower the launch into the water. Equipped with supplies and a revolver, Bill set sail, navigating the clear water-lanes in the Sargasso Sea towards possible escape.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Bluewater Bill do to estimate he was near land?\nA) He filled his pockets with coins\nB) He gave the dead a sea-burial\nC) He planned his escape\nD) He uncrated the launch\nE) He stocked provisions', 'Question 2:\nWhat did Bluewater Bill remember about a launch for South America on board?\nA) It had a unique propeller\nB) It was used for sea-burials\nC) It was uncrated by Bill\nD) It was equipped with a revolver\nE) It navigated clear water-lanes', ""Question 3:\nHow did Bluewater Bill plan to use the ship's engine?\nA) To navigate shallow rivers\nB) To lower the launch into the water\nC) To stock provisions\nD) To face the challenge of escape\nE) To rig a system for sea-burials"", ""Question 4:\nWhat challenge did Bluewater Bill face after stocking provisions?\nA) Getting the launch overboard\nB) Navigating the clear water-lanes\nC) Estimating he was near land\nD) Giving the dead a sea-burial\nE) Using the ship's engine for fuel"", ""Question 5:\nHow did Bluewater Bill lower the launch into the water?\nA) By using the ship's engine\nB) By stocking provisions\nC) By rigging a system\nD) By estimating he was near land\nE) By filling his pockets with coins"", 'Question 6:\nWhat did Bluewater Bill use to navigate the clear water-lanes in the Sargasso Sea?\nA) A unique propeller\nB) A revolver\nC) Coins\nD) Provisions\nE) Sailor ingenuity']"|['A) He filled his pockets with coins', 'A) It had a unique propeller', 'A) To navigate shallow rivers', 'A) Getting the launch overboard', 'C) By rigging a system', 'E) Sailor ingenuity']
Bill was thrilled to see the patent wheel working flawlessly on his boat. Despite having to clear some weeds occasionally, the wheel proved its makers' claim of being unstoppable in tangled waters. After a quick meal, Bill struggled to stay awake, eventually dozing off as the boat drifted through the night. Suddenly awakened by the boat's wild movements, Bill quickly resumed the engine to navigate the rough sea. Realizing the risk of swamping, he reduced speed and shielded the bow with a tarpaulin. After a terrifying night, Bill spotted a steamer in the distance. Frantically waving for help, the steamer approached, rescuing Bill from his perilous situation. Bill, cautious of his newfound gold, tossed it overboard before boarding the steamer.

Meanwhile, the boys woke up to find their aeroplane's main guiding lever missing. Sanborn, the mechanic, had sabotaged it. Despite their efforts to find a substitute, they couldn't. Desperate, they posted a description of the missing part, offering a reward. As the search began, a man shared advice about a rival's aeroplane weaknesses. The boys were determined to win the cup, even with the setback. The mechanic's betrayal fueled their determination.

"At this moment, a shout from the crowd drew everyone's attention. The boys hurried to the door to investigate. They witnessed a fascinating sight that left them in awe. A young boy shared his discovery of a lever hidden in the bushes while searching for a lost ball. Unaware of its significance, a member of the crowd recognized it from a ""Lost"" notice and directed the boy to the Golden Eagle shed. Excited, the boy headed off with newfound treasure. The grounds buzzed with spectators as preparations for the aviation event unfolded. Aircraft of various designs emerged, each owner beaming with pride. The Golden Eagle and the Buzzard garnered applause. Amid the chaos, Frank meticulously tested the Golden Eagle's engine, showcasing its flawless performance.

The flight started well but turned disastrous quickly. The Grasshopper soared into the air with a sudden leap, only to crash into some trees and land in a pigsty. The pigs squealed, and Schmidt, the unfortunate navigator, found himself in a muddy mess. As he tried to escape, the angry sow charged at him, causing him to fall again. Schmidt cursed the Grasshopper for not stopping due to a forgotten switch. The chaos continued as more aircraft took off, creating a spectacle for the crowd. Despite some mishaps and collisions, five planes soared towards the Harrowbrook Country Club. The Golden Eagle led the pack, with Gladwin following closely behind. The boys watched as the race unfolded, with one aviator forced to land due to engine trouble.|"['1.

The wind picked up speed, causing trouble for the Buzzard aircraft. Despite the wind, the Golden Eagle was swift, reaching its full capacity of seventy miles per hour. They spotted the Harrowbrook Club, the halfway point of the race, and landed amidst cheers on the green lawn in front of the club. The aviators hurried to refuel and cool down the engines. Frank and Harry, the only two-seated plane in the race, quickly attended to the aircraft. As they prepared to take off again, a familiar figure in a car tried to stop them but failed.

The Buzzard aircraft encountered a sudden gust that even Malvoise's ailerons couldn't correct. It spiraled down towards a pond, crashing into willows, leaving Malvoise unharmed but soaked. Meanwhile, the Golden Eagle landed near the aerodrome, greeted by a crowd and reporters. Later, a wagon arrived to collect the Buzzard's remains. Frank received a mysterious message about a cup on the Hempstead Plains, leading to plans for testing pontoons in a bay. The pontoons, equipped with keels and tanks for water and gasolene, were loaded onto a launch. The boys added weight to simulate the Golden Eagle's load, testing the pontoons' buoyancy. As they sailed into the Sound, they marveled at the beautiful day and the pontoons' performance in the water.|"['1.

Frank confidently steered the twenty-five-foot Ocean Spray into the sparkling seas, creating cascades of glittering water over the bow. The young voyagers were absorbed in handling the craft, unaware of the weather changing. A mist enveloped them, chilling the air. Bluewater Bill, asleep below, could have warned them, but they were now lost in a dense fog without a compass. The Ocean Spray, powerless in the mist, drifted silently. Suddenly, a menacing steamer's whistle pierced the fog, and a massive vessel passed close by. The boys frantically searched for their raft, only to find it bobbing nearby, empty. Billy Barnes awoke in a luxurious stateroom on the Princeton, rescued after being hit by the ship. As he overheard Luther Barr and Malvoise discussing beating the Boy Aviators to the golden galleon, Billy realized their sinister intentions.|['1.

Billy overheard Luther Barr's laughter and Malvoise's excitement about a plan to beat others to a hidden treasure. The air-ship they planned to use was originally meant for the government but now fixed for their mission. The trio discussed their strategy, involving tethering the air-ship to the treasure ship and loading the loot. Billy, determined to thwart their scheme, learned of their plot and sought to outsmart them. Meanwhile, the boys eagerly awaited Billy's return, traveling to meet him in New York. As Billy tried to avoid being seen, he unexpectedly encountered Ben Stubbs, an old friend from past adventures. Ben had been swindled and sought a new opportunity by responding to a newspaper ad for a dangerous mission in Boston.|"['1.

Ben added, ""I'll keep you posted. Good to see you lads again."" Lost in thought, Billy walked near Brooklyn Bridge, a secluded area used for storage.

Billy was surprised to see his captors, Sanborn, the treacherous mechanic, and Luther Barr, along with Malvoise, the French aviator, in the room. Barr explained that they needed Billy's help and tracked him down after witnessing his rescue. Billy, initially worried about being captured for overhearing their plans, realized they had a different motive. They moved him to a small windowless room. Despite his attempts to escape, Billy found a wire hook, which he used to pick the lock and free himself. He quickly made his way to the Astor House where his friends had left a message for him.

Billy rushed uptown to the Chester boys' home, finding them gathered in a room above the garage, their workshop. The boys listened in awe to Billy's story. Frank proposed a plan to charter a boat from Galveston, sail across the Caribbean, erect the Golden Eagle, and fly to the galleon in the Sargasso. They decided to telegraph and prepare for a two-month cruise. Ben Stubbs, now in Boston, arrived at a grand but now industrialized house. The neighborhood was deserted, but smoke and wires hinted at activity within. An old man warned Ben of strange occurrences at the house, including a flying object with a gleaming eye and buzzing voice. Ben, armed, rang the bell, hearing heavy bolts open the door to a sinister-looking man of Spanish descent.|"['1.

""I don't want to go on a dangerous cruise,"" Ben exclaimed, trying to learn more about Barr's plans, but failed. The other just shrugged and said, ""Fly!"" ""We've tested her from this roof several nights. She's safe. This craft is my invention,"" said Senor Constantio. Ben planned to leave, but Constantio was too clever. Ben went out with Constantio, who shared that he sold his invention to Barr, who urgently needed a dirigible. Constantio's main secret was a powder that made pure hydrogen gas. Ben managed to escape to the station, catching a train to New York. The Chester boys were now aware of Barr's airship plans. They prepared for the journey, having only personal items and the Golden Eagle parts. They reached Galveston and swiftly readied for departure.

Under the cabin floor of the Bolo, an emergency anchor was stored along with two fifty-pound mud-hooks. The boys were pleased to see the long booms that could double as derricks. The Bolo also had a high-sided dory, reserve tanks for gasolene and water, and additional fuel receptacles. Precautions were taken due to the inflammable cargo, with no smoking allowed and matches locked away. The cabin had berths and transoms for sleeping eight comfortably. The next morning, as they prepared to sail, a news peddler threw a paper on board, with a headline about a mysterious air-ship in Miami.

The boys were eager to set sail, quickly preparing their letters and entrusting them to the gamin who had helped them before. With the flags flying proudly, the Bolo left the harbor, leaving only the loafers on the wharf to witness their departure. As they sailed into the Gulf, Billy Barnes shouted with excitement, anticipating the adventures ahead. The boys established a routine aboard the ship, setting watches and following naval traditions like lowering the flags at sunset. On the second day, they encountered a large liner passing by, creating a thrilling sight for the boys.

As the sky darkened ominously, Ben directed the boys to secure the boat's equipment for the impending bad weather. Despite their exhaustion, they worked diligently to prepare for the storm. Ben's expertise guided them as they faced the rising sea and fierce winds. The boys struggled to secure the dory amidst the turbulent waves. Ben's vigilance and quick thinking ensured the safety of the boat and its crew. As the storm intensified, Ben's concern grew, prompting him to take further precautions to safeguard the vessel. Despite the perilous conditions, Ben's experience and resourcefulness inspired confidence in the boys as they braved the raging sea.|"[""1.

Frank, despite his confusion, followed the old sailor's instructions without questions. As the Bolo rocked violently, he struggled to complete his task. Meanwhile, Ben prepared a makeshift sea-anchor to stabilize the boat in the storm. With the oil bags in place, the vessel was calmed. Despite the engine trouble, Frank managed to fix it and get it running again. Ben decided to push forward rather than wait out the storm. Suddenly, they spotted a large steamer approaching. They quickly fired a signal to catch its attention. The steamer passed by, leaving the Bolo in its wake as the storm raged on.|"[""1.

Looking up, the boys saw a figure on the bridge in uniform shouting through a megaphone. By daybreak, the hurricane had calmed, and the sun rose on a still stormy sea. The boys prepared to fish for sharks. They baited a hook with pork and cast it into the sea. Suddenly, a shark caught the bait, pulling a crew member overboard. Frank grabbed a rifle and shot the shark. The wounded shark thrashed in agony but soon disappeared. The crew member was safe, explaining he was dragged overboard by the shark. The days passed quickly, and they headed towards the Sargasso Sea. The journey was filled with excitement, porpoises, and flying fish.

Every day, a member of the group took turns using the binoculars under a small shelter made with canvas and oars at the front of the boat. They carefully scanned the horizon for any sign of the Brigand or Luther Barr's airship. Despite spotting distant smoke a couple of times, it always turned out to be a false alarm. As they approached the Sargasso, they hadn't seen any trace of their rivals, which lifted their spirits. The boys were already dreaming about what they would do with the treasure once they found it. They spent time clearing and discussing plans to assemble the Golden Eagle at sea. Frank was aware of the challenges they faced. The calm waters indicated they were entering the Doldrums, a region with little wind. As they looked into the crystal-clear sea, they were repulsed by a massive octopus-like creature with arms as long as twenty-five feet. The crew shared stories of the ferocious beast, and they decided to head back west. They anchored the boat and began assembling the Golden Eagle on pontoons in preparation for their next adventure.|"[""1.

The structure supporting the wings of the plane caught the attention of the young workers. Each part was fastened securely to prevent loosening due to the vibrations from the engines. Adjusting the wide wings was challenging, but they managed to balance the aircraft by placing boards from the cabin floor underneath. Once the frames were bolted on and the weight was distributed evenly, the plane balanced on its pontoons without additional support. Placing the engine was a bit tricky, but they used a derrick to lower it onto its bed. After securing the engine, propellers were attached. The tanks were filled, and the engine was tested. With everything in place, the Golden Eagle gracefully skimmed the water, ready for its adventure in search of the golden galleon.|"['1. What caught the attention of the young workers?\nA.

Early the next morning, the final supplies were loaded onto the airplane, and the instruments were adjusted by the crew. The Bolo's position was carefully noted in Frank's log-book. After quick goodbyes, the Golden Eagle took off at ten-thirty, soaring high into the clear sky. Ben scanned the ocean below with binoculars, spotting a deserted steamer in the Sargasso Sea. The boys observed the decaying state of the ship, covered in seaweed and abandoned for years. Suddenly, a swarm of rats poured out, terrifying the boys. They fired their revolvers, but the rats kept coming until Frank had an idea. He aimed for the large gray rat, hoping to scare off the others.|['1.

The rats on the ship were in a frenzy, swarming over the rail and plunging into the sea, some sinking while others cried out in circles. Suddenly, a fleshy arm emerged from the seaweed, capturing the struggling rodents. Ship rats had multiplied, eating sugar and gnawing into water tanks. The boys explored the deserted ship, finding signs of a hasty departure. The log-book revealed the ship's journey from New Orleans to Liverpool, detailing engine breakdowns and drifting off course into the Sargasso. The crew faced a grim fate, trapped with no escape as the propeller was entangled in seaweed. Despite the crew's unrest, the captain insisted on staying with the ship, hoping for rescue.|"['1.

On June 28th, a tragic incident occurred on a ship. Chief Engineer Maxwell was killed, Hooper was badly wounded, and the narrator was injured. The crew tried to escape in boats but were attacked by huge octopi. The creatures pulled one boat underwater, leaving a sense of horror. The narrator decided to lower the last boat to try to reach land or open sea. Rats infested the ship, causing chaos and even killing a cat. Feeling overwhelmed by the ship's horrors, the narrator decided to leave. The log-book was taken by the boys to deliver to the ship's owners. Ben speculated about the fate of ships lost at sea, mentioning the mysterious Sargasso Sea. He identified the wreck as a barque, possibly the one Bluewater Bill was stranded on, with a nearby galleon confirming his suspicions.|"['1.

Frank skillfully maneuvered the Golden Eagle around the majestic galleon, adorned with remnants of once grand decorations. The ship's stern displayed intricate carvings and gilding, including a faded painting of a woman surrounded by celestial elements. As dusk approached, the boys explored the opulent main cabin, now decaying but once adorned with luxurious silks and velvets. With Ben's help, they uncovered a hidden compartment filled with treasures, including candlesticks, vases, bowls, and bags of coins. Excited by their discovery, they planned to open more chests that night but decided to rest after a hearty meal. The next day, they systematically cataloged the valuable items they retrieved, marveling at the dazzling golden ornaments and jewels. Ben, content with the thrill of the adventure, declined any share of the treasure, insisting it belonged to the boys and Bluewater Bill.|"['1.

"Frank was indignant, exclaiming, ""You've got a nerve to think you won't get a share! We're all in this together. Once we value the treasure, we'll divide it fairly."" Ben Stubbs, unlocking a large chest, almost triggered a deadly trap. The lid swung open, revealing a steel arm with sharp prongs stained with what seemed like blood. The boys realized it was a mechanism designed to harm intruders. Frank warned of potential dangers ahead. They carefully packed the treasure into sacks on the ship. Despite a strange dream that night, they managed to rest. The next day, they avoided a risky encounter with another group after realizing they were camping on a nearby island.

The boys overheard Constantio expressing his plans to create larger dirigibles for transatlantic travel. Ben had to reveal Constantio's identity to them before they realized who was speaking. The Boy Aviators, along with their companion, were kept awake all night, preparing the Golden Eagle for a potential life-threatening journey. Despite the challenges, the boys felt a surge of excitement as they took off in the Golden Eagle, leaving the galleon and Bluewater Bill's hulk behind. The dirigible they encountered was impressive, with a shiny gas-bag and sparkling cabin. As the dirigible approached, tension rose, leading to a dramatic aerial battle. The boys tried to outmaneuver the dirigible, but a projectile hit the Golden Eagle's gasolene tank, causing a devastating setback.

Ben, despite his desire to destroy it, had to secure the end of the apparatus to the Golden Eagle's frame. Shortly after, Malvoise descended swiftly. To prevent any assault, the dirigible's crew aimed their rifles at the boys and Ben. The sneer on Malvoise's face irked Ben, who restrained himself. A bullet narrowly missed Ben's arm, tearing through his shirt. Reluctantly, Ben surrendered his revolver and the treasure sacks were hoisted onto the dirigible. Malvoise then threatened to sink the craft, but a monstrous arm emerged from the sea and dragged Sanborn to his demise. The crew, shaken, detached from the aeroplane. Malvoise praised Ben's bullet damage to the gas-bag, which was promptly patched up by the crew for a safe journey ahead.|"[""1.

To the boys' surprise, as night fell, the airship continued on its course without stopping. They had thought it might meet Luther Barr to load the treasure, but the crew showed no signs of landing. The boys speculated on their fate, but couldn't guess what would happen next. Suddenly, the lights went out as Malvoise had warned. The boys fell asleep quickly in their comfortable bunks. When Frank woke, he heard commotion on board. The crew was running around, and Malvoise was shouting orders in excitement. The airship was groaning and straining in the storm. Lightning flashed, and thunder roared. The Frenchman worried the engine might fail, leaving them vulnerable to the storm. The boys knew a lightning strike could be disastrous. Frank took the wheel to steer through the fierce winds. Despite the storm's intensity, the airship held together, astonishing everyone aboard.|"['1.

Desperately, Frank struggled to control the sinking plane as the hurricane raged on. The wind pressure was too strong, causing the gas-bag to move ahead while the sub-structure lagged behind. Frank, exhausted, stumbled onto the deck, nearly tripping over the motionless body of Malvoise. Despite the chaos, Frank managed to tie a cord to his wrist before fainting. The dirigible continued to descend, losing gas, until it reached a breathable altitude. Upon regaining consciousness, Frank closed the valve to stabilize the craft. As the storm calmed, Frank discovered the damage caused by the hurricane, including the loss of Malvoise. With the crew revived, Frank was declared the new captain by Constantio, who only sought to invent airships and had no interest in the treasure they were seeking.|"['1.

Constantio recognized Ben Stubbs immediately and chuckled with apparent kindness at their past encounter in Boston. He had recovered the watch Ben had taken and kept it from Luther Barr to avoid his anger. Constantio informed the group they were nearing one of the Bahama islands and needed to land soon for repairs due to dwindling gas. By emptying the water tanks and discarding cabin fittings, the airship lightened, but the situation remained dire. Spotting land ahead, they jettisoned remaining ballast to rise and landed on a beach. The island had a coconut grove and a stream, providing relief. Constantio revealed he could refill the gas bag with his powder, offering to do so in exchange for a share of the treasure.

As they returned to their camp, they found it buzzing with excitement. Two men exploring the island discovered a ship's boat washed up in a cove. Ben suggested it might belong to the missing Falcon. The boat had oars, suggesting it broke free when the ship sank. The boys were unaware of the sinister plan forming in the inventor's mind. Under the cover of night, he and two accomplices stocked the boat with supplies, planning to steal the treasure and escape. The cowardly Constantio stayed by the boat, ready to flee. When the boys caught on to the plot, a scuffle broke out. The thieves managed to load one sack of treasure into the boat before making a run for it. They rowed off into the darkness, leaving the boys behind. A sailor later tried to pawn a gold candlestick marked Buena Ventura, likely the stolen treasure, but managed to evade capture.|['1.

Frank and his friends faced a challenge when trying to generate gas for their craft on the beach. They experimented with the mixture until they found the right balance. Using cylinders with pressure gauges, they managed to inflate the bag partially. The warm sun helped expand the gas, making the craft buoyant. They loaded the treasure bags onto the craft and prepared to take off. As they kicked off the weights, the ship shot upwards unexpectedly. They navigated towards the Bolo, where a surprise awaited them. Bluewater Bill aimed a rifle at their craft, but a piece of silk helped avert disaster. The treasure was successfully transferred to the Bolo, and the boys then descended onto the smaller vessel. After dividing the treasure, they set sail for the Florida coast, ending their adventure.|"['1.
