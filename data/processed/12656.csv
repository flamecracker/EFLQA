The boys left the car and strolled towards the station entrance. Suddenly, a German military officer appeared in their path. Hal tried to avoid him but was not quick enough.

The lieutenant expressed concern that the presence of the boys might lead to their arrest as enemies of Germany if they faced ill fortune. He feared they could be convicted as spies and shot. Despite the risks, the lieutenant agreed that having four people on their adventure would be better than just two. The boys tried to buy revolvers but faced too many questions, so they abandoned the idea. They were anxious as they made their way to the rendezvous that night. The plan was to head north to Kolberg on the Baltic Sea and then try to cross into Denmark. Once out of Germany, the officers had no clear plan, but getting to England was the first step.

The large car sped through tiny towns, their dim house lights flickering past like bright dots. After nearly thirty minutes of breakneck speed, Lieutenant Anderson ordered Hal to slow down. Concerned about pursuers close behind, the lieutenant knew they couldn't waste time. They had to stop soon to avoid being shot at. To conceal the wounded driver from potential enemies, they covered him with rugs. As they neared a line of soldiers, the command to halt came, threatening to open fire.

Anderson swiftly disarmed the officer and incapacitated him with precise blows. Meanwhile, Captain Derevaux's foe aimed a rifle at him, but Chester intervened, striking the man down. With the threat subdued, they quickly boarded the waiting automobile. The lieutenant commended their actions, acknowledging that they had likely averted capture. As they tended to the wounded, a plan was devised to evade their pursuers by setting the car in motion towards a sharp curve, where it would crash out of sight.

They walked swiftly down a brightly lit street, the town's main thoroughfare. Feeling safe in the crowd, they reached a simple hotel where they waited for their friends. After a satisfying meal at a nearby restaurant, they returned to the street. Near their horses, they hid as a sentry passed by, unaware of them. The approaching crowd and lights in the huts hinted at chaos. As an officer appeared, they were taken to a dark cell. Though apprehensive, they remained composed. Lieutenant Anderson, fearing the worst, suggested a rest. Despite exhaustion, Hal and his companion stayed alert, examining the cell's barred windows. One loose bar gave them hope, but the windows were too small. Through one, they glimpsed a ruined wing of the castle, and through the other, a bridge overgrown with weeds.|"['1.

As the morning light seeped into their cell, a creaky key turned in the door's rusty lock. Captain Derevaux and Lieutenant Anderson, alert even in their sleep, sprang to attention along with their friends. The massive door slowly swung open, revealing an old African American man with bread and water. A group of German soldiers lingered outside. Hal and Chester, stunned, were reminded of Hal's uncle's home in Virginia. They laughed in disbelief, momentarily forgetting the danger. Later, a lieutenant and soldiers escorted them to the army camp. Inside the headquarters, a general accused them of spying.

As the airplane ascended, Hal clutched the seat tightly, feeling a lump in his throat as the ground shrank below. Fritz then explained the plane's controls, demonstrating how to stop, increase speed, ascend, and glide. He also taught Hal how to steer. While soaring, Fritz mentioned the aircraft's capabilities, reaching speeds of 100 miles per hour and climbing a mile high. The main risk, he noted, was from air currents. Later, an urgent letter arrived, stating they must return to Berlin with the U.S. ambassador's help. Hal and Fritz stealthily left, subdued guards, and wheeled the aircraft out.

In the dimly lit room, Chester found himself surrounded by a circle of shadowy figures. A masked man sat on a raised platform, the leader of the group. As Chester entered, everyone rose in silence.

The boy swiftly dashed through the room and raced into the hallway. He spotted the front door ahead and sprinted towards it. Trying the knob, he found it locked with no key in sight, likely barred from outside by the absent family. Footsteps closing in behind him signaled danger. In a desperate move, he smashed the door's glass with a chair, creating an opening. As he climbed out, he was met by two armed pursuers. One struck him down, rendering him unconscious. Upon waking, he found himself back in the conspirators' chamber. They questioned his knowledge of their entrance code and matching mask. The leader left the decision of his fate to the group, each holding a ball that would determine his destiny.|"[""1.

"The general spoke grimly, ""They will regret their approach to Louvain. Their overconfidence will be their downfall. They will fall into our trap, and I am certain they will be defeated.""
