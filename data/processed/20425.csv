At breakfast time, five people gathered around the table with five bowls of boiled bread-and-milk in front of them. Sarah, who was temporarily acting as a caretaker, served them.

On the other hand, Pax, the pug, stood proudly despite his small size, often challenging Darkie. He strutted like a beadle and had a pompous air about him. The family's decision to keep both dogs pleased the children. Robin inquired about a mysterious old gentleman at church, but Sarah evaded the question playfully.

Robin was eager for Christmas, but for the Captain and his wife, it arrived too quickly. They had hoped it would mend things with the old man, but their hopes were dashed. The Captain sometimes regretted the old man's gift. Seeing his wife's sorrow in her childhood home, especially when she saw her aging father with no warmth towards her, pained him. As they sat by the fire, Pax, the dog, and the mummers from the nursery burst in. Their performance made the Captain's wife cry. To cheer her up, the Captain urged kindness. Pax's antics lightened the mood, and the mummers left. St. George suggested going mumming for real, and they quickly changed into disguises.

"The old man and his son-in-law politely debated who should enter first. Eventually, the Captain entered, followed by the old man. After the service, everyone rejoiced over the reconciliation.

"Dear Rouge Pot,

It's essential to remember that not everyone can have everything or be everything in this world or on stage. Private theatricals require compromise, strict rules, and giving and taking to make everyone happy. The stage-manager has a tough job ensuring rehearsals work for everyone, handling disputes, and dealing with the aftermath of the performance. It's crucial to match the right parts to the right people and keep everyone content. Although the actors get the credit for success, the stage-manager plays a crucial role behind the scenes. Despite the challenges, a good stage-manager finds satisfaction in seeing the production through successfully. Amateur actors may have misconceptions about their abilities, but it's important to work together and respect each other's efforts for a harmonious performance.

Sincerely,

To all the actors playing small roles, it may feel disappointing to be cast as a footman with minimal lines and actions when you believe you could have excelled as the Prince. Remember your principles. Stay loyal to the stage manager, support the production, and showcase willingness and good humor. Even in small roles, take pride in your performance. A good actor can elevate a minor part to greatness. Speak slowly and clearly during rehearsals, and avoid rushing your lines. If you're a comic actor, be mindful not to overshadow your fellow actors. Keep the green room organized with a handy basket for your costume essentials. Ensure you know your lines thoroughly, as it's crucial for a successful performance. Lastly, invest in a proper curtain system for seamless scene transitions.|"[""1. What is the main advice given to actors playing small roles in the text?\nA. Rush through lines during rehearsals\nB.

"If the room has enough space for a simple stage setup with ""wings"" at the sides and room behind the scenes for actors to move around, a proscenium can be created without much expense or complexity. Two wooden uprights, a cross-bar for the curtain, and some decorative elements can be easily put together by a village carpenter. Parents and guardians should consider small annual expenses for children's activities like theatricals. The question of scenery depends on available resources, but acting can be successful without elaborate sets. A watercolor artist in the group can paint scenes on canvas or calico using distemper. Tips for scene painting include avoiding extreme perspective, using sober coloring, painting by candlelight, and protecting lights with glasses. Different colored glass frames can create lighting effects like moonlight or sunlight. Special effects like thunder and lightning can be created safely with household items.

"If your house has a large modern pseudo-Japanese screen, it can be a beautiful background for a drawing-room scene and can also reflect light into the stage. Folding screens, covered on both sides with light-colored wallpaper, can be used as scenery. These screens can be adorned with Japanese watercolor designs. Screens can brighten up the stage and are great for drawing-room theatricals. For a cottage scene, screens painted with bricks and windows can represent a house. Adding a movable porch can create the illusion of an entrance. Brighten the stage with a ""crumb cloth"" or holland covering. To create a fireplace, use a mantelpiece and a banner screen. Hot coals can be simulated in a grate using irregularly-shaped red glass with light behind it. Good costumes can enhance a performance. Simple accessories can make comical costumes for characters like monkeys or oysters. Sandwich costumes can be made for children using simple materials like paste-board or covered frameworks. These costumes can be created by skilled kite-makers."|['1.

Glazed calico is a great choice for beginner costume-makers. It's affordable, shiny, and comes in vibrant colors like turquoise blue, pink, and yellow. These colors are similar to those used by Christmas card makers against gold backgrounds. You can find inspiration for color combinations from Christmas cards with children in historical costumes. Tarlatan, available in various shades, can be used for wings, hair, and skirts in theatrical performances. However, caution is needed due to the flammable nature of some materials. Safety measures like glass shades for candles are crucial to prevent accidents. Valuable items like satin dresses, burnous, and wigs can be repurposed for plays and charades. Accessories like wigs, mustaches, and face paints are essential for transforming actors on stage. Proper care and removal of makeup are important to avoid skin irritation.|['1.

Dear Rouge Pot, as you move beyond childish rhymes, remember to keep favorites like _Dick Whittington_, _Beauty and the Beast_, and _Cinderella_. Avoid overly complex plays and consider trying farces, which we found successful. Farces, though challenging, are great for young actors as they are short and focus on raising laughter rather than deep emotions. Remember, the key to a good performance is leaving the audience wanting more. Let me share a tale of the Skratdj family, who disagreed on everything but never quarreled seriously. Their constant contradictions amused onlookers, showcasing their unique way of communication. Remember, it's okay to disagree, but it's essential to understand and respect each other's perspectives.|"['1.

The snowy hill stood tall under the grey sky, making the fields appear vast and gloomy at twilight. Among the dreariness, the red berries on the holly hedge and a plump robin redbreast added touches of color and cheer. As the children watched the robin, they noticed an old man with a white beard and hair carrying a small fir-tree towards the Hall. Although the children wondered if he might be Father Christmas bringing them the tree, they hesitated to ask directly. Excitement grew as they anticipated the tree being lit up with candles at night. The children eagerly awaited the arrival of Father Christmas, with their hearts racing as they counted down the moments until the clock struck four.|"['1.

"""We should climb up onto the wall,"" I suggested. Patty struggled onto the wall, getting snow up her sleeves. As I followed, something warm and cold touched my legs, making me scream. Startled, I fell and hurt myself. It turned out to be Father Christmas's dog, licking and jumping on me. Patty cried, ""It's Father Christmas's dog!"" The dog then turned to Patty, and we followed him. He led us to something in the ditch, where we found Old Father Christmas. Kitty kindly welcomed him in. We all sat together, enjoying tea and cakes. Although worried about the tree, we had a pleasant time. In the past, children were taught humility and good manners. Nowadays, parents often encourage boldness and greed in their children, which was different from how we were raised."""|"[""1.
