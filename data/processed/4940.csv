It was Christmas Eve, and the snowflakes fell gently, promising a white Christmas. The wind howled through the trees as the judge and his young guests enjoyed the warmth of their shelter. Earlier, they had journeyed to the woods to cut a Christmas tree and gather evergreens. The girls decorated sleds with holly and pine. Back at the house, preparations were underway. Grace planned to surprise the judge under the mistletoe. The hall was adorned with holly, poinsettias, and roses. Laughter filled the air as the judge danced in their attire. The girls encircled him, each giving a kiss on his cheek. Grace, troubled by a recent disagreement, sought to reconcile with Henry and help Marian with her outfit.

"""This must be something very remarkable,"" said the judge, as he untied the scarlet ribbon and uncovered a cut glass inkstand with a silver top engraved with his initials. ""Pardon me, my dear,"" he said, turning to Marian, who looked pleased and shy. ""I am an old man and don't always remember names well. The beauty of your gift overwhelmed me.

Mr. Henry Hammond received a magnificent silver-mounted toilet set, while Marian proudly displayed a gold chain and locket with diamonds from him. Miriam Nesbit, in a cream-colored silk kimono with red poppies, noted her gifts' beauty, causing a sudden silence. Grace sensed disapproval of Marian's extravagant gifts. After breakfast, the judge suggested a sleigh ride, and the group enjoyed the cold day wrapped warmly.

During the dance, the bride paused, claiming fatigue, and dashed out of the room, hinting that she would hide and be sought after by her husband and guests. The husband and guests joined the fun, chasing after her. Nora then sang the next verse. In the following scene, Anne found a cedar chest brought down by the boys and playfully hid inside it. The husband, now older, pantomimed the story of his vanished bride on their wedding night. Two mischievous servants, Hippy and Jessica, attempted to clean the chest but fled in terror when it opened.
