"This set of Japanese folktales is the result of a suggestion given to me by Mr. Andrew Lang, indirectly through a friend. The tales were translated from the modern version by Sadanami Sanjin. These stories are not exact translations but have preserved the Japanese essence while aiming to captivate young Western readers rather than scholarly folklorists. One story, ""The Story of the Man who did not Wish to Die,"" originates from a book written by Shinsui Tamenaga a century ago. Another tale, ""The Bamboo-cutter and the Moon-child,"" is from the classic ""Taketari Monogatari,"" considered a fairy tale despite not being officially classified as one. In narrating these tales in English, I have added local color and descriptions to enhance the storytelling, drawing from my imagination. Japan once saw the courageous warrior Tawara Toda, also known as ""My Lord Bag of Rice,"" whose true name was Fujiwara Hidesato. One day, armed and eager for adventure, he encountered a massive serpent-dragon blocking his path on the Seta-no-Karashi bridge. Despite his initial fear, Hidesato boldly stepped over the dragon's body and coils. To his surprise, the dragon vanished, replaced by a peculiar man seeking his aid. This man, with red hair and sea-green attire, explained his plight - a monster centipede threatening his family in the lake. Impressed by Hidesato's courage, he implo"|"[""1.

Hidesato sympathized with the Dragon King and pledged to help him. The warrior inquired about the centipede's dwelling to confront it immediately. The Dragon King revealed the centipede's home on Mount Mikami but suggested waiting until its nightly visit to the lake palace. Led beneath the water to the Dragon King's palace, Hidesato marveled at the beauty of the white marble structure. The feast served amazed him, with dishes made of crystallized lotus leaves and flowers. The palace was suddenly shaken by the approach of the centipede. Despite previous failed attempts, Hidesato remembered the centipede's vulnerability to human saliva.

"""All right, TAI SAN,"" said his friend the cuttlefish, and then opening the TAI'S mouth as wide as he could and putting one of his feelers down the TAI'S throat, he quickly and easily drew the hook out of the sufferer's large mouth. He then washed it and brought it to the King. Ryn Jin took the hook from his subject, and then respectfully returned it to the Happy Hunter (the Mikoto or Augustness, the fishes called him), who was overjoyed at getting back his hook. He thanked Ryn Jin many times, his face beaming with gratitude, and said that he owed the happy ending of his quest to the Sea King's wise authority and kindness. Ryn Jin now desired to punish the TAI, but the Happy Hunter begged him not to do so; since his lost hook was thus happily recovered he did not wish to make more trouble for the poor TAI. It was indeed the TAI who had taken the hook, but he had already suffered enough for his fault, if fault it could be called. What had been done was done in heedlessness and not by intention. The Happy Hunter said he blamed himself; if he had understood how to fish properly he would never have lost his hook, and therefore all this trouble had been caused in the first place by his trying to do something which he did not know how to do.

Long, long ago, a Chinese Empress named Jokwa, who was as tall as a giant, ruled over the land. She faced a rebellion from the wizard Kokai, who caused chaos by flooding the country. To combat this, the Empress appointed two young warriors, Hako and Eiko, to lead her forces. In a fierce battle, the warriors fought against Kokai, who wielded a powerful iron rod. Despite their efforts, Hako fell from his horse, leaving him vulnerable to Kokai's sword. However, Eiko bravely intervened, challenging Kokai to face him instead.

Kokai, realizing he was being chased, turned to face his closest attacker, Eiko. He swiftly readied an arrow from his quiver and aimed at Eiko. However, the wizard's enemies remained unharmed. Knowing he couldn't ready another arrow in time, Kokai resorted to magic. He summoned a flood that swept away Jokwa's army and generals. Hako and Eiko found themselves struggling in the water, but a miraculous island emerged. They sought help from an old man on the island, who created a safe road for them. Enraged, Kokai charged at the old man, but the Fire King, Shikuyu, intervened. Empress Jokwa sought Shikuyu's help against Kokai.

Eiko and Hako engaged in a fierce battle, their skills evenly matched. As Eiko started to tire, Hako stepped in to protect his friend. The Fire King, Kokai, tricked Hako into attacking him, leaving Eiko vulnerable. Kokai wounded Eiko, causing him to retreat. Meanwhile, the armies watched their leaders fight. Shikuyu then commanded his soldiers to charge, defeating Kokai's forces. Despite Kokai's attempts to summon the Water Devil, Shikuyu's knowledge of counter-charms prevailed. Kokai, in a fit of pain and despair, dashed himself against Mount Shu and perished. The Empress Jokwa rewarded Shikuyu for his victory, but the aftermath of the battle caused chaos.
