This is a story about Bunyip Bluegum and his Uncle Wattleberry. Bunyip is described as a fine, round fellow, while his Uncle is more square with whiskers on his face. The whiskers were so important that they led Bunyip to leave home to see the world. However, the whiskers caused trouble as they blew about in the wind and even ended up in the soup at dinner. Uncle Wattleberry refused to get rid of them despite hints and gifts. Bunyip pondered whether to be a Traveller or a Swagman but realized he didn't have the necessary bags or swags.

"After a long journey, Bill, Sam, and Albert had to halt their trek with the Puddin'. The Puddin', with its magical properties, decided to give them a run for exercise. Bill, impressed by the Puddin's antics, placed a basin on Albert's head, and they continued along the road. Bill explained the Puddin's unique ability to regenerate slices, calling it ""cut-an'-come-again."" He then hinted at the Puddin's mysterious origins.

Bill and Sam, professional Puddin'-owners, fought the Puddin'-thieves on principle. Despite objections from the Puddin', they turned it upside-down and sparred with the thieves. The Possum tried to divert attention, but Bill and Sam retaliated. The Wombat surrendered due to sore feet. As they left, the Possum warned of consequences. They made a campfire, enjoying tea and treats from the Puddin'. Bill shared tales of sea life, and they sang songs. Bill proposed Bunyip Bluegum join their Noble Society of Puddin'-owners, a light-hearted group that wandered, conversed, and ate together. Joining them meant sharing stories and enjoying the Puddin'.|"[""1.

"After a cheerful day of adventures, the Puddin'-owners gathered around the campfire for a delightful breakfast. Bill Barnacle sliced up the Puddin' while sharing his ""Breakfast Ballad,"" which was met with applause. Sam Sawnoff shared the joy of being a Puddin'-owner, where breakfast songs and laughter were encouraged. However, a playful act from Sam led to a messy mishap with the Puddin'. Bunyip Bluegum intervened, emphasizing the importance of friendship over disruptions. The group then packed up and set off on a journey filled with songs and stories. Along the way, they encountered a Fireman rushing past, warning of a fire. The Fireman advised protecting the Puddin' from the flames, highlighting the importance of preserving its flavor. Despite the chaos, they all joined forces to put out the fire, enjoying the camaraderie and excitement of the moment."|"[""1.

In the midst of chaos, Bunyip Bluegum caught sight of the Wombat stealing the Puddin'. Bill, enraged by the treachery, knocked the Fireman into the fire. The Possum's deceit was revealed when his helmet fell off. As hot cinders singed Bill, he chased after the Possum and then the Wombat, but both escaped. Determined, Bunyip Bluegum urged them to stay strong and pursue the culprits. They decided to become detectives to track down the thieves. Seeking clues, they encountered unhelpful characters like Henderson Hedgehog and a grumpy Parrot Swagman. Dismissing them, they met a Bandicoot carrying a watermelon, a peculiar sight that intrigued them. The quest to rescue the stolen Puddin' continued with new leads to follow.|"[""1.

They called out, 'Hey, you with the watermelon!' to grab his attention, and started chasing him. The Bandicoot, being naturally scared, ran as fast as he could. Unfortunately, he wasn't a great runner due to the heavy watermelon, and they caught up to him halfway across the field. Bunyip Bluegum had to use his best speaking skills to motivate them. 'Let's show our bravery,' he cried, 'Puddin'-owners don't back down from challenges.' As a reward, they received unexpected information from a talkative Rooster. The Rooster mentioned a 'singed possum', which matched their search. They followed the Rooster's guidance quickly and found a tree with a sign reading 'Watkin Wombat, Esq., Summer Residence'. The door was locked, and they overheard the thieves inside discussing their love for puddings. Despite feeling hopeless, Bunyip Bluegum came up with a clever plan. He disguised himself with grass whiskers, a hat, and a coat, and instructed his friends to wait for his signal before confronting the thieves.|"['1.

Bunyip approached the group with a business proposition about the Pootles's Patent Pudding Enlarger. He claimed that pouring the Enlarger over a pudding would double its size with certain incantations. However, Bill and Sam thwarted the pudding thieves with a flurry of blows and secured their beloved pudding. The friends celebrated with singing around the campfire, despite the Puddin's protest. Bunyip's cunning plan impressed Bill, who shared a song about Sam's past exploits. The group set off cautiously with their pudding, wary of potential thieves. The Puddin' taunted them, boasting about the thieves' eating abilities. Despite the banter, the group continued on their journey, mindful of potential threats to their dessert.|"[""1.

One day, Bunyip Bluegum and his friends encountered a Flying-fox. The Flying-fox, feeling offended by being measured by Bill, protested loudly. Despite suspicions of being a disguised Possum, the Flying-fox was found to be too short and was let go. Later, chaos ensued in a grocer's shop when Uncle Wattleberry was mistaken for a pudding-thief. A commotion erupted with Bill and Sam hanging onto Uncle Wattleberry. Despite the confusion, it turned out that the real pudding-thieves were the Possum and the Wombat, who trapped Bunyip Bluegum and his friends in a bag.

The Puddin'-thieves swiftly snatched the Puddin' and fled, leaving the Puddin'-owners distressed. Bill lamented the bran in the bag, remarking on the misery of losing a prized Puddin'. Despite their discomfort, Bunyip Bluegum urged them to endure with courage. Walking on Sam's bare feet, they encountered Benjimen Brandysnap, a dog with eggs for market. Mistaking them for sports enthusiasts, Benjimen freed them upon learning of their plight. Determined for vengeance, they ran northwest but found no trace of the thieves. Benjimen shared his eggs, though Bill longed for the lost Puddin'. They devised a plan to capture the thieves, hiding and waiting for them to approach.

"Bill faced an unexpected problem. ""This is a tricky situation,"" he remarked. ""Ben, please keep an eye on the pudding thieves while we chat privately."" Bill, Sam, and Bunyip huddled together, feeling almost hopeless. ""What a terrible spot we're in,"" Bill lamented. ""We can't remove a thief's hat unlawfully. And as long as the hat stays on, how can we prove our pudding is underneath? This is one of the worst things to happen to us in years."" Bill then had an idea. ""Hats off to honor our King!"" he shouted, and everyone removed their hats. The pudding thieves were caught off guard. The Wombat had to take off his hat, revealing the pudding on his head. Bill then confronted them, showing proof of their guilt. The thieves tried to escape blame, but Bill and Sam were resolute in teaching them a lesson. After a thorough scolding and punishment, the thieves were left regretful. Benjimen even rubbed eggs in their hair to drive the point home.

With a friendly agreement in place, they began to prepare the campfire, exchanging warm gestures of friendship as they passed around the Puddin'. During breakfast the next morning, Bill expressed relief about the situation. Bunyip Bluegum doubted the sincerity of the thieves' remorse, while Ben Brandysnap suggested shooting them with pea-rifles. Bill, frustrated, threatened to give up owning Puddin' if theft continued. The Puddin' got angry, and they had to eat extra slices to calm him. As they set out towards Tooraloo, Bill voiced his distrust towards strangers. Upon reaching Tooraloo, two individuals accused them of stealing the Puddin', leading to a confrontation. The group was surprised by the false accusations and the dramatic behavior of the accusers, disguised as undertakers.
