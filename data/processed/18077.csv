In the English countryside, the landscape reflects a sense of calm and security, showcasing the virtues and attachments passed down through generations. This speaks volumes about the moral character of the nation, as noted in Washington Irving's _Sketch Book_. A saying from the narrator's mother emphasized gratitude for what they had, especially when things seemed uncertain. The family's simple, traditional ways were rooted in their background as north-of-England people, proud of their heritage. The narrator's brother, Jem, embodied the yeoman spirit, untroubled by ambitions beyond their quiet life. Despite the narrator's own penchant for books and curiosity, their upbringing was steeped in familiarity with the land and the animals around them, like the memorable encounter with the cow Dolly. Jem's fearlessness and connection to the beasts underscored their close relationship with nature from a young age.|"['**1.

Our farm was filled with many animal friends. The yellow yard-dog wagged his tail happily when we came near, eager to be let off his chain. In the farmyard, the fowls rushed to our feet for corn, pigeons swooped down for peas, and pigs leaned against the sty wall for a good scratch. The plough horses' long faces were a familiar sight as they worked the fields. We grew fond of the lambs, ducks, and chickens, even though we knew they would eventually be eaten. My love for all creatures, even the odd and mischievous ones, often got me into trouble. Reading became my joy, especially when the books had information about animals. My mother saw my potential, dreaming of my future greatness, while my father, though initially skeptical, would eventually come around to support her visions.|"[""1.

She had a strong imagination but never used it for writing. Maybe I got my love for daydreaming from her! They say we inherit mental traits from our mothers. My dear friend Jem and I were always up to mischief. I would come up with ideas, and he would follow along. I once convinced him to run away from school, and we dug a hole under the kitchen garden to escape. Despite the gardener's disapproval, we filled it back up. I was always the instigator of our adventures, whether on desert islands or in castles. A bee led me to Isaac Irvine, the bee-keeper, and a friendship was born. During Catechism Sunday, we had an embarrassing incident in church. Jem struggled with his lines, while I breezed through. Despite his nerves, we always had each other's backs.|"['1.

During the annual public catechising, where grown-ups gathered to watch us, I got distracted by three bees landing on Isaac Irvine's hand. I was supposed to answer questions about the commandments, but I couldn't focus. Isaac, an elderly man with a noble face, assured me the bees wouldn't sting him. My mind wandered, and I couldn't answer correctly. Despite Jem's attempts to help, I was passed over for the next question. This upset me, but Jem comforted me with a pinch on the leg. My mother, who had been our teacher, was proud when Jem excelled in reading a lesson about not hitting a dog. Jem, however, mischievously hit our cat Kitty with a book, repeating the lesson's words.|"[""1.

"Jem rarely memorized anything, but he had this one down pat. I found him in the garden, panting after using a coal-shovel to flatten my mustard and cress bed, chanting, ""I had my bat, and I hit him as he lay on the mat."" Nearby, an ""Academy"" opened, sparing our parents the school search. Walnut-tree Farm, an old house in a lane with wild roses, was a favourite spot. The old miser living there intrigued us. He had a peculiar cat with one yellow and one blue eye. When we rescued the cat from a tormentor, the miser gave us a sixpence. We hoped to be invited inside, but he only warned us about serving on a jury before sending us off, leaving us spooked."|['Question 1:\nWhat did Jem memorize exceptionally well in the text passage?\nA) A nursery rhyme\nB) A math equation\nC) A recipe\nD) A self-defense move\nE) A historical fact', 'Question 2:\nWhere did the children find Jem in the text passage?\nA) In the kitchen\nB) In the attic\nC) In the garden\nD) In the barn\nE) In the library', 'Question 3:\nWhat did the miser warn the children about in the text passage?\nA) Climbing trees\nB) Playing in the garden\nC) Rescuing animals\nD) Serving on a jury\nE) Talking to strangers', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the children hope for after rescuing the cat?\nA) A reward\nB) An invitation inside the house\nC) A pat on the back\nD) A new pet\nE) A magic spell', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the miser give the children as a reward for rescuing the cat?\nA) A penny\nB) A sixpence\nC) A dollar\nD) A gold coin\nE) A thank you note', 'Question 6:\nWhat intrigued the children about the old miser living at Walnut-tree Farm?\nA) His collection of books\nB) His peculiar cat\nC) His beautiful garden\nD) His mysterious past\nE) His musical talents']|['D) A self-defense move', 'C) In the garden', 'D) Serving on a jury', 'B) An invitation inside the house', 'B) A sixpence', 'B) His peculiar cat']
The funeral was unforgettable. The old man had left detailed instructions with his lawyer for a lavish funeral, aiming to gain posthumous popularity. The neighborhood's tradition of extravagant funerals often turned solemn occasions into comical spectacles. Curious children like Jem and I were fascinated by the funeral preparations and gossip. The uproar in the parish surrounding this particular funeral left a lasting impression on us. Despite being scolded for eavesdropping, we found a silver lining in the sad event when our puppy passed away, giving us a chance to bury him. Mimicking the grandeur of the real funeral, we dressed in elaborate scarves and gloves, feeling immensely proud. Our attire, delivered in separate envelopes, made us look comically absurd but filled us with joy.|"['1.

The guests at the feast spoke well of the deceased, impressed by his post-mortem generosity. The tables were laden with food and drink, causing the dinner to drag on. Despite the lawyer's suggestion to leave before the will reading, Jem and I stayed. The room was musty, with furniture covered in newspaper. As the will was read, we learned of our legacies. The strangers at the funeral were displeased, and we retreated to the garden to avoid their ire. The will left Walnut-tree Farm to a Mrs. Wood, surprising everyone. Public opinion wavered on the old miser's sanity, especially after the wording of his funeral invitation was revealed. Despite the confusion, Jem and I received legacies and opened bank accounts.|"['1.

"Everyone around kept saying, ""She should give it up. Maybe the new doctor would rent it cheap for his horse. What could she do with that old place and no money to maintain it?"" I was so tired of hearing this that one day I retorted, saying that ""home was becoming boring."" Jem, always by my side, added, ""Me too."" For this bit of bravado, we lost our dinners. But at bedtime, we found cake under our pillows, as our mother couldn't stand us going hungry no matter how badly we behaved. I don't know if it was the trousers, but around the time we started wearing them, Jem and I were constantly misbehaving. It wasn't due to overwhelming temptations; we were simply testing how naughty we could be. This desire to disrupt and challenge authority must be unfathomable to calm individuals but is a common trait among boys. Our mischievous mood coincided with Mrs. Wood opening her school, which led us to not particularly like our schoolmistress. If I were older, I might have seen beyond her stern appearance and appreciated her beauty. But at that moment, we were more interested in causing chaos and having fun."|"['1.

"Spending summer days at Walnut-tree Academy was made more enjoyable by the school-mistress, Mrs. Wood, who had a talent for creating comfortable spaces. Even at our age, we appreciated her ability to make the rooms cozy and visually pleasing. Despite advice to update the old rooms with new furniture and decor, Mrs. Wood chose a different approach. She painted the walls a soft pea-green, with a dark green tint above the wainscot and a delicate border of white periwinkle. The Bible text ""Keep Innocency"" adorned the top of the room, adding a touch of wisdom. The absence of curtains allowed the sunlight to fill the room, while a shoot of ivy added a natural element. The schoolroom was equipped with plain pine seats and desks, a polished blackboard, and colorful maps and prints. Mrs. Wood's chair faced the inspiring text, and she even made a comfortable sofa for a new student with a physical disability. The arrival of this student, carried in by his father, brought a sense of warmth and acceptance to the school."|"['1.

"Horace was mistaken, and Mrs. Wood had not erred in the text. ""Cripple Charlie"" could see well lying down. He confided that when his back troubled him, he stared at ""Peace,"" with its golden letters, and if he focused on it, he'd fall asleep. The adventure was risky and thrilling, involving a raid at night with sticks, climbing trees under the owner's window. Armed with sticks, Jem and I left before dawn, soaked in dew. As we approached the walnut tree, I hesitated, but we proceeded. While gathering walnuts, we were startled by Mrs. Wood at her window.

"She happily did not wait for a response, as we were unable to speak; however, the basket of walnuts was soon lowered through the lattice. It descended slowly and unsteadily, giving us ample time to observe. As we looked up, we noticed something that had puzzled me about Mrs. Wood's appearance. She was without her widow's cap, revealing her gray hair, which was different from Mrs. Jones's. Mrs. Jones had less hair that appeared whiter. In contrast, Mrs. Wood's hair was abundant, with deep brown streaks mingled with the gray. The sunlight illuminated her face as she leaned out, uncoiling her hair over the window-sill. Despite our peculiar position, I had an important question to ask. We sadly gazed at the damp walnuts, losing our appetite. However, we couldn't leave the basket behind, so we carried it with our sticks. Repentance and the desire to make amends led to a dialogue between Jem and me about our bantam hens and cock, known as ""the Major and his wives."""|"[""1.

"""Shh! Shh! Shh!"" my mother hushed us. ""No Sunday lessons on weekdays. You boys are mischievous!"" Avoiding an argument, she wisely changed tactics and began to plead with us. Jem, persistent as ever, wanted to name our bantams as we pleased. He gently embraced her and persuaded her with his sweet words. We named our bantams in a basket, just like grapes in Eshcol. Mother didn't object; she would have given anything to avoid conflict. With her cap back on, hiding her hair except for the grey bit in front, she looked different. I couldn't help but stare, rudely. I finally blurted out, ""Why is part of your hair grey and part dark?"" Jem, always one to apply general rules, wondered if we'd end up in trouble like Bob Furniss.

"My mother was very sympathetic and gave a detailed report that bored Jem and me. We resented being blamed and found the strawberry jam pot empty.

The bee-master and I shared a fondness for reading, especially about unusual floating apiaries. I often visited Isaac, the bee-master, to read to him, as he preferred hearing the words over reading them himself. One day, as I read about a barge filled with beehives floating down a river, Isaac and I both marveled at the idea. The bee-master expressed his interest in seeing how a single beehive could bring in a significant income. Despite the challenges of breaking from our Sunday routines, I managed to convince my parents to allow me to accompany Isaac on his beekeeping trips. With my mother's insistence that I attend church twice, I found a compromise by promising to join Evening Prayer at a nearby minster. And so, on a Sunday in August, armed with my mother's blessing and a threepenny-bit for the collection, I embarked on my first adventure with Isaac Irvine.|"['1.

We had our meal before we set off. I wasn't very hungry, too excited to eat much. I took some large sandwiches made with thick slices of home-made bread and layers of home-made potted meat. My mother was upset because I insisted on carrying the sandwiches in a red and orange spotted handkerchief I bought myself. She thought it made me look like a sailor. As we walked uphill, I realized how tiring it was. We stopped at a wayside trough with fresh water. The bee-master and I shared the sandwiches and drank from the clear stream. Inside the cool church, I sat with the bee-master, watching the stained windows and the sunlight outside. Charlie's father was there, looking respectable in his office attire. The congregation was devout, responding eagerly to the minister's enthusiasm during the service, making the atmosphere lively and engaging.|"[""1.

The organ played by the vicar's eldest daughter, the vicar's second daughter leading the singing, and the choir followed in a somewhat irregular harmony. Isaac, not knowing the words well, borrowed a hymn-book and preached instead of singing. The congregation, including young men, maidens, old men, and children, joined in the hymn. The churchwarden approached for the threepenny-bit, distracting the devotions. The final verse was sung loudly as the bellows-blower pumped vigorously. After the service, Jack and Isaac spent a pleasant afternoon with the bees among the heather. They had tea at the village inn and walked home by moonlight. Isaac expressed his newfound enjoyment of church, thanks to Jack's mother. Jack reflected on the day and the gentle hands that guide men's better selves. Later, Jack decided to gather moor flowers for Mrs. Wood and learned about a man skulking around the farm. Mary Anne asked Jack to find Mrs. Wood, worried about the stranger lurking around the property.|"['1.

My ears felt warm when the conversation turned to thieves, and I quickly followed Mary Anne's instructions without further discussion. As I rushed through the back garden, a cloud covered the moon, but just as I reached the end, the moon reappeared, illuminating the scene. I saw a white object on the ground, which turned out to be the widow's cap. Nearby stood Mrs. Wood and a tall, thin man, resembling Mary Anne's description. His hair was gray, contrasting with hers as he held her head in his hands. Witnessing this strange sight, I felt frozen until I realized I should leave. Before departing, I glanced back to confirm the reality of the scene. The man noticed the white cap, angrily stepping on it as I made my escape. The following events caused a stir in the neighborhood, with my mother, fearing for Mrs. Wood's safety, considering sending my father to the farm with a gun.

The elderly man, haunted by doubts of condemning an innocent person, left his fortune to the convict's wife. This mysterious act stemmed from his past misjudgment. The man, a shattered figure, had served a decade in chains. While I, a mere child, enjoyed carefree days, he endured a harsh sentence. As I daydreamed in church, I realized the weight of his undeserved punishment. School resumed with more students, and the schoolmistress showed compassion. Mr. Wood declined job offers from the successors of the firm that once prosecuted him. He found solace helping at the school, where I connected with him through my friendship with Cripple Charlie.

My father was mistaken about me. Sympathy for Charlie was not even half of the bond between us. When he spoke or listened to the Penny Numbers, I never noticed his physical limitations, and I can't fathom how anyone could. He absorbed and retained more information than I did, with a keen interest in exotic lands. Despite his constrained body, he possessed an adventurous soul, eager to explore the world like me. He longed to travel but lacked the means. Charlie was delighted to meet Isaac Irvine, a bee-master, with whom he shared a profound connection. Despite Charlie's quirks and struggles, Isaac was a steadfast friend. Our community showed kindness to Mr. Wood, but some grew impatient with his reserved nature. The schoolmaster, having endured much hardship, sought solace in peace. Isaac aptly observed that the schoolmaster yearned to affirm his freedom. Evenings were mundane for my mother and me, as my father and brother preferred the outdoors. I now realize it was selfish to keep my father's evenings quiet. I often visited Charlie, and on occasion, my mother joined us. While the Woods strolled the homestead, Charlie and I explored the globe, sharing laughter and camaraderie.|"['1.

During a summer evening, we sat around an old oak table, reading and talking about distant lands and exotic birds with vibrant feathers. The school-master, with his white hair resting against the ivy-covered lattice, listened to the songs of blackbirds and thrushes as the sun set, painting the fields with a golden hue. Charlie shared fascinating details about the South American forests, describing the diverse trees and colorful flowers. Although Charlie stumbled over some names, his enthusiasm was evident.

Charlie, a young boy who was often left out of adventures due to his disability, felt dejected. When the school-master noticed this, he shared his own story of struggles. The school-master, who had faced hardships and was once imprisoned, spoke about the importance of empathy and understanding others' pain. He explained how sharing and accepting pity can lessen one's burden and bring joy in connecting with others' happiness.

"The teacher raised his hand above his head, pressing on it as if in pain. I felt so sad that I couldn't help but cry, searching for my handkerchief under the table filled with acorns. By the time I dried my eyes, Mr. Wood was lifting Charlie, arranging his cushions. ""Yes, when I was a convict,"" said the teacher. ""No offense, my boy. If I preach, I must practice."" Charlie kept saying ""Thank you,"" feeling sorry for not expressing more gratitude. He knew Mr. Wood mentioned his past as a convict to show empathy. The autumn lane was vibrant with colorful leaves and berries. Jem played a trick with rose hips, fooling the new maid. Everyone anticipated a harsh winter due to the abundance of berries, but it never came. The winter was mild, with snow melting away, leaving behind glossy berries. Jem enjoyed the frost, engaging in fights with village lads. The pond became a winter haven for skaters, leading to conflicts with the villagers.

Our neighbors were very independent people. The adults had to earn a living, so they couldn't be entirely independent. But the boys in our area, who were provided for by their parents, showed independence in a rough way. During the winter holidays, when the village boys had time to slide and skate, they caused trouble by damaging our pond. They even threw stones onto the ice. Jem and I were upset but felt helpless as our father didn't take action. So, we decided to gather our schoolmates for a plan.

I felt sorry for Jem as he went with my father to see a horse, leaving me without a skating partner. I went to the farm to find out what Charlie and the Woods were up to. Mr. Wood warned me to stay away from the mill-dam due to the thawing ice. Despite the temptation of the smooth ice, I refrained from going on it. Later, Mr. Wood and I found others testing the ice, with some skating without hesitation. The school-master cautioned about the weak spot near the stream and advised against groups rushing onto the ice. I watched a skilled skater on the dam while I stayed on the bank.

The crowd had grown larger as everyone had finished their work for the day, and the skater continued to perform difficult maneuvers. As he attempted a challenging move, I spotted Mr. Wood approaching and signaled for him to hurry. Suddenly, I remembered that we were all on the dangerous side of the dam. My attention shifted back to the skater, but I noticed a disreputable young man known for troublemaking standing with a gambler, seemingly placing bets on the skater's performance. The skater executed a few turns but lost balance, falling through the ice. Panic ensued as onlookers realized they couldn't swim to his aid.

Mr. Wood shared a valuable lesson about saving lives with Jack. He advised Jack not to grab onto someone trying to rescue him when under water. Clinging to the rescuer could lead to both drowning.

Dear old Charlie had a great time in the boat with us, even though he couldn't dive. He loved every minute on the canal, especially on sunny evenings. His Irish spaniel, Jem, would swim after the boat, looking up at Charlie joyfully. Later, Mr. Wood taught Bob Furniss to row and Charlie to steer. Charlie began collecting insects, water-weeds, shells, and microscopic items. Bob and Charlie took pots, pans, nets, and dippers to fish and store their finds. Bob was patient and never rushed them. Charlie lived on the farm and shared a room filled with old furniture. They stored his fern collection and other items neatly. Charlie was proud of his room, especially the sunny window where he grew plants from cuttings. They organized his fern collection in a drawer and planned to fill another.|"['1.

I heard banging on the wood, realizing someone was in a temper. My attention shifted to what I thought was toffy but turned out to be glue. Just then, Charlie called me urgently. In a secret drawer, we found bank-notes and gold, along with a note for Mrs. Wood. The lawyer explained the old miser's eccentric ways. The money led the Woods to leave the school and turn it into a farm. Cripple Charlie found a happy home with them. It baffled me why my father chose Crayshaw's school.

The fondness with which I've heard people talk about their school days and teachers tells me that Mr. Crayshaw wasn't a typical educator. He wasn't an ordinary man either. I've encountered others with his cruel streak in different places, using their power irresponsibly. The scars from those days have healed, but I've grown up and faced the world. I firmly believe Mr. Crayshaw's cruelty wasn't just about being harsh or greedy; it was a passion for inflicting pain. Cruelty isn't just a thing of the past in barbaric societies; it still exists today. Those in power over the vulnerable must be held accountable to prevent abuse.Unchecked power can lead to cruelty, even in places meant to be safe.

I was a popular horse at school, known for being active, nimble, and well-built. The bigger boys usually rode me, but they were not cruel. However, one day after a grueling steeplechase, I collapsed and was revived with cold water. Despite the pain, the boy was proud of his treatment. The constant dread and fear we little boys faced made us run away. I convinced my friend Jem to escape with me.

As a child, I found solace in the adventures of the Penny Numbers. They were my friends, bringing the maps on the walls to life during school days and comforting me on sleepless nights in the dormitory. Despite feeling unappreciated by my father and lacking a proper education, the idea of a life at sea intrigued me. I considered the possibility of becoming a sailor, knowing I was hardy and obedient. While I longed for a career in the Royal Navy, I realized it might not be feasible. Apprenticing on a merchant vessel seemed like a practical alternative. However, my father dismissed my aspirations, attributing them to my supposed vanity and lack of candor. Despite his disapproval, I was determined to pursue my newfound passion for the sea.|"['1.

I avoided discussing my father's religious views, even though he accused me of defying both God's will and the Fifth Commandment. The devout atmosphere at home, instilled by my parents, whom I deeply respect, has always guided me against wrongdoing. I wish more good people balanced faith with reason when interpreting divine intentions. While my father believed I belonged in Uncle Henry's office, I felt drawn to a life at sea. Despite my disagreement, I yielded to my parents' wishes. Initially, I worked as an office boy for Uncle Henry but preferred returning home daily due to a health issue. My recovery mandated fresh air, exercise, and healthy meals under my mother's watchful eye. This new routine, including riding the red-haired pony Rob Roy daily and studying with Mr. Wood, marked the start of a different chapter in my life. Despite these positive changes, I still felt unsettled.|"['1.

It may seem absurd, but the foul smell in the office made everyone but my uncle and Moses Benson feel sick and uneasy. Moses, a Jewish clerk, remained unaffected and claimed he couldn't smell anything.

Mr. Burton commented on the boy's fate, hinting at future success in Parliament due to his persuasive speaking skills. Moses, the Jew, shared a brief proverb about the boy's situation, emphasizing that the son of the house is not bound to servitude forever.

As Moses spoke, the door swung open, and a tall, influential client of my uncle entered. The man's presence commanded respect, making even the Jew clerk bow his ringlets low. Moses Benson kept his promise of providing adventure books, though they were often worn and soiled. I devoured these tales, finding solace and escape in their pages. My father, however, disapproved of my literary indulgence, expecting me to conform to his ideals rather than be myself. Despite my obedience, our relationship remained strained. Uncle Henry's involvement added further tension, as his reluctance to fully support my career aspirations disappointed both my father and me. The prospect of running away crossed my mind, but the thought of my mother's anguish deterred me.

My father had a lot of pride and refused to compromise. He insisted on paying the full premium for me, just like Uncle Henry's other clerks. I realized that my future had taken a new turn.
