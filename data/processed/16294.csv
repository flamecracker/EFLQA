The story of English colonization in America begins with the unsuccessful attempts to establish colonies by Gilbert and Raleigh. These failures highlighted the challenges of individual enterprise in planting colonies. Motivated by adventure, a desire for a new life, and disrupting Spain's commerce, the English settlers faced hardships in adapting to life in America. Virginia emerged as the first successful colony, marked by the introduction of tobacco as a staple crop. The colonists' strong inclination towards self-government was evident through the establishment of the first assembly in 1619. Maryland, founded later, benefited from the lessons learned in Virginia. The New England colonies, like Massachusetts, developed popular government structures, setting the stage for future American governance. The interactions between the colonies and the formation of the New England Confederation laid the groundwork for early American federalism.|['1.

The social life in New England during the colonization period was shaped by a strong commercial spirit, intense religious beliefs, and a narrow social and intellectual environment. The English rivalry with the Spanish power motivated colonization efforts. The book covers over three-quarters of a century, starting from the first English attempt in America in 1576 to the recognition of Parliament's supremacy in 1652. The period saw the establishment of colonies in Virginia and New England, leading to the formation of the Southern and Northern English colonies in America. England's rivalry with Spain, especially in terms of wealth from America and religious differences, led to a quarter-century war between the two nations. England's progressive spirit contrasted with Spain's decline, as Spain neglected manufacturing and agriculture due to its focus on imported goods, while England's economy thrived. Spain's strict religious control stifled free thought and innovation, leading to economic and social stagnation.|"['1.

In England during the 16th century, the conflict between Henry VIII and the Pope led to the establishment of Protestantism. The closure of convents and monasteries further solidified Protestantism and diminished papal influence. While the general population remained loyal to the Catholic Church, the clergy's authority decreased, allowing for more freedom of expression. Protestantism continued to grow under Elizabeth I, fostering a climate of inquiry and entrepreneurship that boosted manufacturing and trade. This period saw English individuals joining conflicts against Spain and supporting colonization efforts in America to challenge Spanish dominance. Although England's early attempts at colonization were overshadowed by Spain's, figures like John Cabot made significant voyages to North America. English commerce began to flourish, with ventures like the Newfoundland fisheries and expeditions to Guinea and Brazil in the 16th century. The rivalry with Spain spurred English commerce and exploration, leading to significant voyages and the establishment of trade connections with Russia.|"['1.

During Queen Mary's reign from 1553 to 1558, England saw the restoration of the Catholic church. However, after her death, Queen Elizabeth took the throne and re-established the Protestant church. This change led to the return of Protestant refugees and the initiation of significant voyages that exposed Spain's vulnerabilities in America. Sir John Hawkins, following his father's footsteps, engaged in the slave trade, selling slaves in Hispaniola. Despite Spain's restrictions, Hawkins was rewarded by Queen Elizabeth for his endeavors. Subsequently, Francis Drake, a notable seaman, embarked on expeditions against the Spaniards, accumulating wealth and fame. Drake's most renowned voyage involved circumnavigating the globe, capturing valuable treasures, and claiming territories in the name of Queen Elizabeth, showcasing England's maritime prowess.|"[""1.

"Queen Elizabeth welcomed Sir Humphrey Gilbert with great favor, even going as far as knighting him and accepting a jewel he offered her. When the Spanish ambassador threatened war, the queen fearlessly responded that she would imprison him if he continued with such threats. This act of defiance earned Sir Humphrey the nickname ""the Dragon"" in Spanish history. His bold actions inspired others like Thomas Cavendish to embark on adventures. Meanwhile, another daring figure, Sir Walter Raleigh, joined the scene. Gilbert, with his grand vision, sought to establish an English colony in America. Despite delays, he finally set sail in 1578, but the expedition faced challenges and ultimately had to return to Ireland. Gilbert's charter for colonization set the groundwork for future English ventures in the New World."|"['1.

In his ill-fated journey, Gilbert lost most of his wealth but remained undeterred, embarking on a new venture. He attracted many gentlemen to join, including Sir Thomas Gerard and Sir George Peckham, rewarding them with vast land grants. Richard Hakluyt, the renowned naval historian, stirred national interest with his book _Divers Voyages_, inspiring the nation. In 1579, Simon Ferdinando led an expedition, followed by John Walker in 1580, who reported a silver mine near Penobscot. Despite setbacks, Gilbert's expedition set sail in 1583 but faced mishaps, with ships deserting and turning to piracy. Gilbert reached St. John's in Newfoundland, claiming the land for Queen Elizabeth. Adversities continued, leading to desertions and shipwrecks. Gilbert's ship, the _Squirrel_, was lost at sea, with Gilbert valiantly choosing to stay with his crew. Despite a storm, Gilbert's unwavering courage shone through till the end.|"['1.

After the settlers landed at Roanoke, there was no record of their winter activities. However, when spring arrived, their situation looked grim. Lane searched for gold mines and the South Sea but found nothing. The settlers faced a plot by the natives to attack them, but Lane's quick action saved the day. Despite expectations of supplies by Easter, Grenville did not return, leaving the settlers in a dire situation. Lane divided the men into groups to search for food. Fortunately, Sir Francis Drake arrived with supplies after sacking various places. Lane and others, discouraged, decided to leave the island, and they returned to England in Drake's ships. Raleigh later sent more settlers, including women and children, to establish a new colony. Governor White faced challenges with the Indians and eventually had to return to England for supplies.

The wide spread of power posed a challenge for Philip, prompting him to view England as a threat that needed swift action. Preparing for an invasion, Philip amassed a formidable army in Flanders and a vast fleet in Spain. The timing for the assault was strategic, with Amsterdam and the French king under duress. The Catholic world's animosity towards Elizabeth fueled the urgency. Elizabeth initially considered a land defense but was persuaded by Raleigh to focus on a well-equipped fleet. England rallied its ships, engaging Philip's Armada in the English Channel. The victory spurred English naval dominance, with over 800 Spanish ships falling to English cruisers. Raleigh, amidst these events, strived to support the Virginia colony, facing setbacks due to conflicts with Spain. Despite challenges, Raleigh's efforts marked a significant step towards successful colonization in America.|"['1. What prompted Philip to view England as a threat and take swift action?\nA.

After Queen Elizabeth's reign, Sir Walter Raleigh lost favor with King James I and spent his final years imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1616, he was briefly released under the condition of finding a gold mine in Guiana, which he failed to do. This led to his arrest, and he was eventually executed based on false accusations. Raleigh had a strong belief in America and its potential for English colonization. Despite being imprisoned, he saw his vision come true in 1607 when Bartholomew Gosnold and Bartholomew Gilbert, with support from the Earl of Southampton, attempted to establish colonies in North America. This effort was further supported by explorations from Captain Martin Pring and Captain George Weymouth, leading to the eventual formation of joint-stock companies for colonization, as seen in the charter granted by King James in 1606.|"[""1.

In 1606, England claimed land in North America for two companies. The London Company was to establish the First Colony between 34 and 41 degrees latitude, and the Plymouth Company the Second Colony between 38 and 45 degrees. The colonists had limited rights, subject to the king's rule. The companies financed the ventures but had limited rewards. The colonists faced harsh conditions, and many returned to England. In 1607, the Plymouth Company sent settlers to Maine, but they faced a harsh winter and lack of resources. The colony was abandoned, with most settlers returning to England due to discouragement. This marked the end of the northern colony on the Sagadahoc River.|"['1.

The London Company holds the distinction of establishing the first lasting English settlement in America. On December 10, 1606, ten days prior to the departure of the colony, the Virginia council outlined essential regulations for the expedition. Captain Christopher Newport, a renowned seaman, was appointed to lead the ships and settlers. The council advised selecting a high, dry settlement site upriver from the coast, away from trees. The expedition, including prominent figures like Bartholomew Gosnold and John Smith, set sail from London on December 20, 1606. They aimed for Chesapeake Bay, a vast gulf with serene rivers like the Potomac and James. The region was inhabited by Algonquin tribes led by Powhatan, a powerful chief. Powhatan's authority spanned from Roanoke River to Chesapeake Bay, with a despotic rule over the tribes.|['1.

The Chesapeake Bay Indians believed in many devils that required powwows and conjurations for protection. Captain Smith described a conjuration he witnessed in 1607, where he was seated by a fire and surrounded by priests chanting and rattling gourds. Another custom involved adopting captives to spare them from torture, as seen when Powhatan's daughter, Pocahontas, saved Smith's life by interceding for him. Despite some skepticism about Smith's accounts, similar incidents in Indian culture support the credibility of his experiences. Additionally, Smith observed the Indians' leisure activities, such as singing, dancing, and playing music with pipes and gourds. Pocahontas once again stood out in a charming scene where she and other girls performed a colorful and lively dance around a fire before disappearing into the woods.|"['1.

On their significant journey to Virginia, Captain Newport followed the traditional route through the Canary Islands and the West Indies, taking four months to reach their destination. During their time in the West Indies, conflicts arose between Smith and Wingfield, leading to accusations of mutiny against Smith. Upon reaching Virginia on April 26, 1607, they sighted the capes of Virginia, naming them Henry and Charles after King James's sons. Landing at Cape Henry, they encountered their first skirmish with the native Chesapeake people, resulting in injuries to two men. After exploring the area, they settled on a peninsula in the Paspahegh country, naming it Jamestown. Despite facing initial challenges, including dwindling supplies and attacks from the Paspaheghs, the settlers persevered and began building a fort and town.|"['1.

Five days after Newport's arrival at Jamestown, a fire destroyed most of the fort's buildings. This tragedy, combined with a harsh winter, led to many settlers dying from exposure while trying to rebuild. The famine added to their struggles, but Captain Newport helped by bringing supplies from Powhatan in February. Despite his stay of over three months, conditions did not improve. Newport's focus on unnecessary tasks like searching for gold hindered the colony's progress. The arrival of additional settlers in April and the election of Captain Smith as president marked significant events. Despite challenges, including a short allowance of supplies and a sickly season, the settlers persevered. The marriage of John Laydon and Anne Burras and the birth of Virginia Laydon brought hope to the struggling colony.

In the winter of 1608-1609, the colonists faced hardships at Jamestown. President Smith traded with Indians for corn but faced a crisis when rats devoured their stored corn. To avoid starvation, the colonists dispersed in three groups. They lived with savages, fished at Point Comfort, and resorted to oyster diets that caused skin issues. A small bark commanded by Samuel Argall arrived in July 1609 with bread and wine, bringing news of a new charter and Lord Delaware's upcoming governance. The London Company aimed to correct the colony's government, admitting stockholders to share governance. A new charter in May 1609 expanded the company's bounds. Despite challenges, the London Company's preparations continued, leading to a shift in governance in Virginia.|"['1.

"In June 1609, the ""Third Supply"" expedition set sail from Falmouth with about 600 men, women, and children aboard nine ships. The fleet encountered a hurricane near the West Indies, causing one ship to sink. The ship _Sea Venture_ with Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Somers, and Captain Christopher Newport ran aground in Bermuda. Stranded but unharmed, the crew found the island abundant with food. They built two ships, _Patience_ and _Deliverance_, from cedar to sail to Jamestown. Arriving in May 1610, they found Jamestown in ruins and only 60 survivors. Captain Argall provided aid, and more ships arrived, bringing ill passengers and worsening conditions. Disputes arose among leaders, leading to President Smith's deposition.

In the early 1600s, Virginia faced harsh challenges. Despite efforts to prevent diseases, over 150 people succumbed to fever during the summer. Settlers dwindled to under 200, prompting consolidation at Jamestown and Algernourne fort. Lord Delaware, the leader, fell ill, leaving the colony in a dire state with only three months of supplies. Successive deputy governors, like Sir Thomas Dale, ruled with a heavy hand, focusing on profit over settlers' welfare. Dale enforced harsh labor conditions, treating men like slaves and resorting to extreme punishments. However, his tough tactics subdued local Native American tribes and even led to the marriage of Pocahontas to John Rolfe, fostering peace. Dale's expeditions extended beyond Virginia, clashing with French and Dutch settlements. Despite his oppressive rule, Dale's abolition of communal stores showed some improvement in the colony's productivity.|"['1.

During a dark period in Virginia, the Spanish minister Gondomar expressed concerns about the colony's reputation. Some spies from King Philip were captured, causing worry about a potential Spanish attack. However, the Spanish king believed the colony would fail on its own and took no action. In England, the company faced discouragement, leading to a lottery to raise funds. When Governor Dale left in 1616, only 351 people survived, living in deteriorating conditions. The cultivation of tobacco by John Rolfe brought hope to Virginia. Captain Yardley, the deputy governor, allowed tobacco planting, leading to prosperity. The London Company's constitution changed, granting more autonomy. The company divided on governance, with the country party favoring the end of servitude. Pocahontas, after her marriage to John Rolfe, tragically passed away in England in 1617, leaving behind a son named Thomas.|"['1.

"In April 1618, the London Company was upset with Argall's behavior and sent Lord Governor Delaware to arrest him. Unfortunately, Delaware passed away on the journey, allowing Argall to continue his harsh rule for another year. He even took Lord Delaware's servants and sentenced a captain to death for speaking up. However, upon petition, Argall changed the sentence to banishment. Meanwhile, Sandys and Sir Thomas Smith created a crucial document known as the ""Magna Charta of America."" The company granted the residents of Virginia a ""Great charter or commission of privileges, orders, and laws."" Sir George Yardley was appointed as governor with instructions to implement the new government. Upon his arrival in April 1619, Yardley announced the end of martial law and communism. The London Company intended to distribute land to settlers based on the amount they had invested. A legislative assembly was convened on July 30, 1619, in Jamestown, marking the first of its kind in America. The assembly passed laws against idleness, drunkenness, and gaming, promoting agriculture and church discipline.

It was fortunate that Yardley took over the supervision of Virginia affairs in England. Sir Thomas Smith had been in charge but was too busy with other companies. A quarrel with Lord Rich led to a new treasurer being elected, Sir Edwin Sandys. Sandys worked hard, sending ships with emigrants and cattle to Virginia. King James interfered with the company's choice of treasurer due to political reasons. The earl of Southampton replaced Sandys. Despite some political unrest, Virginia prospered. Many emigrants arrived, new plantations emerged, and the tobacco trade thrived. However, the king imposed taxes on tobacco, causing some disruptions. The settlers prospered, building schools and courts. Unfortunately, sickness and epidemics took a heavy toll on the population, especially during an Indian massacre in 1622.|"['Question 1:\nWhy did Yardley take over the supervision of Virginia affairs in England?\nA) Sir Thomas Smith was too busy with other companies\nB) Yardley was elected by the settlers\nC) Sir Edwin Sandys resigned\nD) King James appointed Yardley\nE) Lord Rich recommended Yardley', ""Question 2:\nWhat led to the appointment of Sir Edwin Sandys as the new treasurer for Virginia affairs?\nA) A quarrel with Lord Rich\nB) Political unrest in Virginia\nC) King James' interference\nD) The earl of Southampton's recommendation\nE) Sandys' personal request"", ""Question 3:\nWhat caused disruptions in the tobacco trade in Virginia?\nA) Political unrest\nB) The appointment of Yardley as supervisor\nC) King James' interference\nD) The earl of Southampton's policies\nE) Sickness and epidemics"", 'Question 4:\nWhat were the consequences of the Indian massacre in 1622 on the population of Virginia?\nA) Increased prosperity\nB) Political unrest\nC) Heavy toll due to sickness and epidemics\nD) Expansion of new plantations\nE) Decrease in emigration', ""Question 5:\nHow did the settlers in Virginia respond to the king's taxes on tobacco?\nA) They complied without any issues\nB) They rebelled against the king\nC) They sought help from the earl of Southampton\nD) They increased tobacco production\nE) They abandoned tobacco farming"", 'Question 6:\nWhich of the following best describes the overall development of Virginia despite the challenges mentioned in the passage?\nA) Decline in population and prosperity\nB) Continuous political unrest\nC) Growth in emigration and trade\nD) Lack of support from England\nE) Stagnation in plantation development']"|"['A) Sir Thomas Smith was too busy with other companies', 'A) A quarrel with Lord Rich', ""C) King James' interference"", 'C) Heavy toll due to sickness and epidemics', 'B) They rebelled against the king', 'C) Growth in emigration and trade']"
Since 1614, when Pocahontas married John Rolfe, peace with the Indians remained unbroken, except for a brief conflict in 1617, swiftly quelled by Deputy Governor Yardley. In April 1618, Powhatan passed away, and his brother Opechancanough took charge. In 1621, a plot to eliminate the English was hatched during Powhatan's burial, but Yardley fortified the plantations upon receiving a warning. Despite Opechancanough's assurances, a massacre unfolded in March 1622. The settlers retaliated fiercely, leading to significant losses on both sides. The English eventually prevailed, allowing them to focus on rebuilding. However, the massacre dealt a severe blow to the company, leading to internal disputes and a royal monopoly on tobacco sales. Ultimately, King James dissolved the company in 1624 due to mismanagement and ongoing conflicts.|"[""1. What event led to a brief conflict in 1617?\nA. Powhatan's burial\nB.

The London Company, which spent a vast sum establishing Virginia, faced financial losses and high mortality rates among the emigrants. Despite this, the settlement secured England's foothold in the New World and laid the foundation for civil liberties. The company's national significance outweighed its economic failures. The King's actions led to the company's downfall, but it was a blessing in disguise for Virginia. The colonists openly supported the company, even risking punishment for their loyalty. The General Assembly protested against the King's commissioners, advocating for a change in governance. Virginia asserted its right to representation in taxation, signaling a shift in its relationship with England. The government structure evolved, with new appointments and commissions, paving the way for a more representative system. Charles I, influenced by Sandys and Ferrar, showed a willingness to cooperate with the colonists, leading to a more liberal approach. The colony's economy thrived on tobacco production, propelling its population growth. Charles I's efforts to diversify the economy were met with resistance due to the profitability of tobacco.

In March 1629, Captain West returned to England, and Sir John Harvey became the new governor. Dr. John Pott served as his deputy until Harvey arrived in March 1630. The colony had grown to twenty-three settlements from eleven a decade earlier. The law-making body consisted of the House of Burgesses and an upper house with the governor and council. Each settlement could have as many delegates as they could afford. In 1630, emigration northward began, with settlements like Chiskiack and York established. By 1632, Middle Plantation (later Williamsburg) was fortified. Harvey faced opposition due to his actions favoring the tobacco trade monopoly. Tensions rose, leading to Harvey's arrest by the council in 1635, and Captain John West was elected as the new governor.|"['1. What was the role of Dr. John Pott in the colony?\nA. Lawmaker\nB.

The removal of the royal governor was a bold move that surprised King Charles. He viewed it as an abuse of his authority and had the two daring burgesses arrested. Lord Baltimore, a friend of Harvey, lodged a complaint leading to the arrest of West, Utie, Menifie, Matthews, and other unfriendly councillors. Despite this, Harvey's power was reinstated by the king to set an example against such actions. However, Harvey's second term was short-lived as Sir Francis Wyatt was appointed to govern Virginia in 1639. The colony continued to prosper under Wyatt's leadership, with the creation of new counties and a growing population. Trade flourished, attracting Dutch and English ships. Settlements along James River, like Newport News and Denbeigh, thrived with agriculture and trade. Jamestown saw improvements in infrastructure with new houses and brick buildings.

Tobacco laws over the next decade aimed to halt further decreases. The price of tobacco ranged from one penny to sixpence, causing much uncertainty as it was the main currency. In 1640, a law ordered the destruction of bad tobacco and half of the good, estimating that eight thousand people placed one million five hundred thousand pounds of tobacco on the market. The drop in tobacco prices led planters to focus on other industries, like supplying corn to the large influx of English settlers in Massachusetts. Despite Virginia becoming a key supplier, a pestilence in 1636 brought misery, with corn selling for twenty shillings per bushel. Sir Francis Wyatt replaced Harvey in 1639, repealing decrees and restoring seized estates. The colony continued seeking a charter renewal, with George Sandys as their agent in England, appealing to Parliament in 1640. The king appointed Sir William Berkeley in 1642, who called for an assembly to counter Sandys' efforts. The majority in Virginia, while loyal to the king, did not agree with the high-church views. The people in Nansemond and lower Norfolk counties leaned towards Parliament and congregational worship, leading to the arrival of ministers from New England in 1642. Despite initial success, Berkeley persuaded the assembly in 1643 to pass strict laws against Nonconformists, expelling them in 1644. An Indian attack in the same year was seen as a divine punishment.|['1.

On April 18, 1644, Governor Berkeley declared Good Friday a fast day to pray for King Charles, but it turned into a day of tragedy. Opechancanough, the leader of the Powhatan Confederacy, attacked the settlers, resulting in over 300 deaths. The colony was shaken to its core by this massacre. However, Berkeley's response was delayed, and he left the colony for a year. Upon his return, he captured Opechancanough, who was later killed. Peace was eventually restored with the Indians. The massacre also led to significant changes, including Rev. Thomas Harrison turning into a Puritan and settling in Maryland. The arrival of new settlers from England, including merchants and yeomanry, improved the colony. The assembly expelled corrupt ministers and welcomed a better class of clergymen. By 1649, there were twenty churches and ministers teaching peacefully.|"['1. What event led Governor Berkeley to declare Good Friday a fast day in 1644?\nA.

Around 1648, Virginia flourished with the gospel spreading, attracting civil, honorable, and wealthy individuals. Orchards bloomed, grand buildings rose, and trades thrived. Despite a tumultuous past with massacres, the land transformed into a place of joy and abundance. Following King Charles's execution in 1649, royalists flooded Virginia, elevating society's quality and strengthening support for the monarch. Parliament responded by imposing trade restrictions on rebellious colonies, including Virginia, in 1650. The first navigation act in 1651 directed colonial trade solely to England, barring Dutch vessels. A squadron led by Captain Robert Dennis aimed to subdue Virginia. Upon arrival in January 1652, an agreement was reached between Virginians and commissioners, recognizing English authority. Virginia enjoyed self-governance under the Commonwealth of England for eight years, initiating a new era of prosperity and autonomy.|"['1.

In the southern part of the colony, plantations stretched along watercourses leading to creeks and rivers that were tributaries of the James River. Some adventurous individuals even explored into North Carolina. To the west, the plantations extended predominantly along the James River, reaching as far as the Falls where Richmond stands today. The population was estimated at around twenty thousand, with about five thousand white servants and five hundred African American slaves. Houses were typically made of wood, one and a half stories high, with brick chimneys. Wealthier residents lived in homes entirely constructed from homemade bricks. The colony was characterized by good English furniture and a considerable amount of silverware. The people were content with their new homes, and thefts were rare. Hospitality was widespread, and the opening of the forests contributed to the overall health of the region. The absence of towns in Virginia was attributed to the abundance of waterways allowing planters to ship their goods from personal wharves and the dispersed nature of tobacco cultivation. This rural lifestyle fostered independence among the population and led to a democratic society. Education was present in the form of parish institutions, with ministers running schools and the county courts overseeing educational welfare, particularly for orphans. The establishment of free schools through legacies in various counties further contributed to education in the colony. George Calvert, the first Lord Baltimore, played a significant role in the founding of Maryland after exploring colonization plans in America and obtaining a charter for his province named Avalon.|['1.

In 1627, Lord Baltimore and his family traveled to Newfoundland to pursue his colonization plans. However, the cold climate led him to seek a warmer location. By August 1629, he requested land in Virginia from the king. He quickly left Newfoundland and arrived in Virginia in October 1629, where he faced a cool reception from the governor and council. They were unimpressed by his religion, past as a court favorite, and plans to establish an independent state within Virginia. The council required him to take oaths of allegiance and supremacy, the latter being unacceptable to him due to his Catholic beliefs. Lord Baltimore sailed back to England to appeal directly to the king. Despite official promises not to disrupt existing interests, the king granted a province to Sir Robert Heath in southern Virginia. Baltimore petitioned for land in Virginia, leading to a charter being prepared in February 1631, but it was delayed by William Claiborne, a Virginia council member. Claiborne, a prominent figure in Virginia, opposed Baltimore's efforts and successfully blocked the grant. Baltimore persisted and eventually received a patent for a portion of Virginia, which he named Terra Mariæ or Maryland in honor of Henrietta Maria, the king's wife. George Calvert, also known as Lord Baltimore, passed away in April 1632, and the charter was issued to his son Cecilius, who would go on to govern Maryland with skill and prudence.|"['1.

In 1633, Lord Baltimore faced opposition from the Virginia Company and planters in Virginia, led by Claiborne. The matter was referred to the Commissioners for Foreign Plantations, who ruled in favor of Baltimore's patent, allowing him to proceed with his settlement. Baltimore's charter granted him a palatinate government akin to Durham in England, affording him significant autonomy. Unlike the bishop of Durham, Baltimore did not pay taxes to the British treasury. His colony was founded on principles of religious tolerance, allowing for the establishment of churches of various denominations. In October 1633, Baltimore's ships, the _Ark_ and the _Dove_, set sail for America with a diverse group of settlers, including Catholics and Protestants. Despite initial challenges, the expedition eventually departed for America in November 1633.|"[""1.

On February 27, 1634, the settlers landed at Point Comfort, where a letter from the king to Sir John Harvey ensured a warm welcome. Here, they discovered that local Native Americans were alarmed, mistaking them for Spaniards intending to conquer their land. After a brief stop for supplies, they sailed up Chesapeake Bay and entered the Potomac River, which dwarfed the Thames in comparison. Natives armed themselves at the river's mouth, and fires lit up the land at night. On March 25, they landed on St. Clement's Island, planted a cross, and then explored the area. The settlers established St. Mary's on March 27, 1634. Unlike Virginia, Maryland thrived due to individual property ownership, a mix of gentlemen and laborers, proximity to Virginia for resources, and access to land cleared by Native Americans. They quickly grew corn, traded with New England, and began cultivating tobacco, leading to the importation of servants who later became freemen. Maryland's society resembled Virginia's, with a focus on agriculture and rural life. The lord proprietor's powers created an aristocracy, with a council and manorial courts similar to those in Durham, England.|"['1.

In the early days of Maryland, Lord Baltimore sought regal dignity through his right to enact laws and shape the assembly. However, the New World's ethos of political and social equality led to a government of the people. The assembly, starting in 1635, asserted its autonomy by drafting laws Lord Baltimore rejected. Eventually, in 1638, he conceded to the assembly's laws until his confirmation. Subsequent assemblies, from 1639 to 1642, limited seats to councillors, specially summoned persons, and elected burgesses. Despite Lord Baltimore's attempts to impose laws, the assembly rejected his complex code in 1649, crafting their own. By 1650, Maryland established a constitutional system mirroring Virginia's, with a two-chamber assembly. The delay in Maryland's governance was influenced by disputes with Virginia over land claims and colonization efforts. Virginia's expansion northward, including settlements like Kent Island, led to legal complexities and shared governance issues between the two colonies.|"[""1.

In 1634, Leonard Calvert arrived at Point Comfort and demanded Claiborne to recognize Baltimore's authority over Kent Island. The Virginia council sided with Claiborne, asserting their right to Kent Island. Claiborne refused to acknowledge Baltimore's rule and continued trading. Despite Calvert's instructions not to harm Claiborne, Captain Fleet spread rumors causing tension. Baltimore ordered Claiborne's arrest, leading to a conflict where lives were lost. The situation escalated, involving the arrest of Governor Harvey and protests from Virginia against Maryland's actions. After a truce, Claiborne sought the king's intervention. His partners, dissatisfied, sent an agent who turned against Claiborne. Claiborne left for England, and Maryland subdued Kent Island. Baltimore's victory was recognized, and Claiborne's property was confiscated. The Jesuit priests in Maryland worked to convert Native Americans peacefully.

In the early days of Maryland, Lord Baltimore, the founder, faced challenges with the political landscape. He extended invitations to Puritans, offering religious freedom, but they declined. Maryland was affected by the war in England between the king and Parliament, leading to unrest. Governor Leonard Calvert faced revolt, with Protestants showing sympathy for Parliament and hostility towards Catholics. Chaos ensued, resulting in the arrest of Jesuit priests and the exile of Calvert. Virginia and Maryland saw a power struggle, with shifts in governance and clashes between Protestants and Catholics. Claiborne, a key figure, played a role in the unrest. Lord Baltimore's position was threatened, but he managed to maintain authority amid the turmoil, adapting to the changing political landscape.|"[""1.

During this period, Lord Baltimore worked on restructuring his government based on Protestant beliefs. Leonard Calvert passed away shortly after his actions at St. Mary's in June 1647. On his deathbed, Calvert appointed Thomas Greene, a Catholic and royalist, as his successor. However, Lord Baltimore replaced Greene with a Protestant, Captain William Stone, who was accompanied by a Protestant secretary and a majority of Protestant councillors. Despite these changes, Baltimore ensured that the core principle of his government was maintained. The Toleration Act of 1649 was introduced during Stone's tenure, which allowed for limited religious tolerance. Stone, who had promised to bring five hundred British or Irish settlers to Maryland, fulfilled his promise. These settlers, known as the Puritans, were initially compliant but later posed challenges to Baltimore's rule. Despite facing opposition, Lord Baltimore demonstrated his loyalty to the commonwealth when his authority was questioned.|"[""1.

"After the Virginia commissioners had subdued Virginia, they encountered less resistance in Maryland. They arrived at St. Mary's and insisted that Stone change the writs from Lord Baltimore to Parliament. Initially, Stone refused, and the commissioners transferred power to a council of Protestants. Stone later complied, and with the help of Claiborne and Bennett, he was reinstated. Maryland then encompassed four counties and had a population of around eight thousand. Society was democratic with no privileged class. Education was limited, but the province was abundant and hospitable. Despite challenges, Maryland thrived. Captain Argall's actions in 1613 helped secure English interests in the region. John Smith's explorations in 1614 led to the naming of ""New England.""

"In 1616, Smith attempted to generate interest for another journey but faced disappointment. Despite this setback, his writings about New England continued to capture public attention. Sir Ferdinando Gorges, a key figure in the Plymouth Company, persisted in sending vessels to explore New England, uncovering a favorable situation due to a Native American calamity. The Plymouth Company, renamed ""the Council for New England,"" secured a new charter from the king in 1620, granting them vast territories in North America. Religious beliefs significantly influenced politics during the 16th and 17th centuries. The Act of Supremacy and the Act of Uniformity, passed in 1559 by Queen Elizabeth, aimed at establishing the supremacy of the English church. These acts provoked dissent among English clergymen, leading to the emergence of the Puritans and later the Independents, who sought to create their own churches.

In the early 17th century, Separatists gathered in northeastern England, in towns like Nottinghamshire, Lincolnshire, and Yorkshire. One group, led by Rev. John Smith in Gainsborough, and another in Scrooby under Richard Clifton and John Robinson, faced persecution by the king's officers. The Gainsborough congregation was the first to leave for Amsterdam, following a London church example. The Scrooby congregation, which included leaders like John Robinson, William Brewster, and William Bradford, attempted to escape to Holland in 1607 and 1608. After facing betrayals and hardships, they eventually reunited in Amsterdam. Later, they settled in Leyden, where they adapted to a new way of life, found work in wool manufacturing, and gained respect from their Dutch neighbors. Robinson, Brewster, and Bradford thrived in Leyden, engaging in scholarly pursuits and contributing to the community.|['**1.

In the summer of 1617, most of the Scrooby congregation decided to emigrate. They debated destinations like Guiana, New York, and Virginia, settling on Virginia under the London Company. John Carver and Robert Cushman were sent to London by the group to secure recognition of their religious rights. Sir Edwin Sandys tried to help, but the King was hesitant. Despite the setbacks, they received two patents and prepared to leave Holland. With financial support, they set sail in July 1620, but the leaky ship, the Speedwell, forced them to return twice. Eventually, they embarked on the Mayflower with friends from London, heading for America. After encountering rough seas, they landed near Cape Cod. Facing harsh conditions, the colonists struggled with scurvy and exposure but eventually established Plymouth in December 1620.|['1.

In March 1621, an Indian named Samoset welcomed the English settlers to the region. He brought Squanto, who spoke English and helped establish peace with Massasoit. The settlers faced challenges but managed to plant corn and build a community. The arrival of new settlers strained their resources, but they received aid from a ship captain. However, more newcomers led to theft and potential famine. To resolve the situation, Captain Miles Standish intervened, providing corn and dealing with unruly settlers.

Around this time, Bradford made a significant change in the way work was organized in the colony. Initially, they had a communal system, but this led to confusion and unhappiness. Bradford decided to assign a parcel of land to each family based on its size. When sixty new settlers arrived in July 1623, there were concerns about running out of food again. However, when the harvest came, the results were positive. Private ownership of land led to an abundance of corn, showing the success of this new approach. The Council for New England, on the other hand, faced challenges maintaining their monopoly on fishing and fur trading. Despite efforts to send out a colony, the venture faced obstacles, and many settlers returned to England. The relationship between the Plymouth colony and London merchants also deteriorated over time due to differing religious beliefs.|['1.

"The Plymouth colony thrived, leading them to end their troublesome ties with merchant partners by a £1800 agreement in 1627. They set up trading posts in various coastal spots like Manomet, Kennebec, Penobscot, and Machias Bay. Efforts were made to reconnect with friends in Holland, but Robinson passed away in 1626. Despite attempts to secure a charter from the king, they settled for a patent from the Council for New England in 1630. This patent defined their territory and granted trading privileges along the Kennebec. Captain Wollaston's settlement near Wessagusset was contrasted with Plymouth, with Thomas Morton causing controversy by instituting the Episcopal service and erecting a massive May-pole at ""Merry Mount."" Plymouth and other settlements joined forces to suppress Morton's activities. French privateers caused trouble for the Plymouth settlers, leading to confrontations in Acadia. In contrast, friendly relations with the Dutch led to a profitable exchange of goods and the introduction of wampum as a valuable trading commodity."|"['1.

The Plymouth settlers were angered by the French and sought help from Massachusetts, but were refused due to trade interests. This marked a shift in power towards Massachusetts. Plymouth's history became less significant after John Winthrop's government was established in 1630. By 1633, a fort was built on Connecticut River to control Indian trade, and in 1639, a treaty was renewed with Massasoit. Disputes over boundaries with Massachusetts were resolved through compromise. The population grew slowly until emigration to Massachusetts boosted it to 3,000. The new settlers caused concerns due to their behavior. Plymouth's population spread out, forming new towns like Duxbury. The governance evolved from John Carver to William Bradford and a council. A representative system was introduced in 1638, with delegates from each town contributing to the colony's laws. Membership in the church was closely tied to citizenship in Plymouth. The colony's laws, established in 1636, set strict criteria for suffrage.|"[""1.

"On June 20, 1628, a group of settlers led by John Endicott arrived at Naumkeag, later renamed Salem, marking the beginning of a new colony.

Meanwhile, in England, John Oldham and Thomas Morton tried to challenge the settlers' land rights but were met with resistance. The Massachusetts Company sought a royal charter, granted on March 4, 1629, establishing the ""Governor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England.""

On May 11, 1629, five ships departed from London carrying around four hundred settlers, mostly servants, along with one hundred and forty head of cattle and forty goats. They reached Salem on June 27, and John Endicott organized the colony's ecclesiastical structure about four weeks later. On July 20, after a morning of prayer, Samuel Skelton and Francis Higginson, two ministers, declared their beliefs in Independent doctrines and were elected pastor and teacher. A church covenant was established, and on August 6, thirty people formed a church. However, two gentlemen, John and Samuel Browne, conducted a separate service using the Prayer Book, leading to their arrest by Endicott and return to England. Endicott's actions stirred controversy, and the settlers were called to a court at Salem where they were required to sign articles aligning with God's word or face banishment.

"In 1630, a group of a thousand people from England set sail for America in seventeen ships.

In the early 1600s, a settlement was established on a peninsula by the Charles River, initially occupied by William Blackstone. This area was blessed with a beautiful spring and later named Boston in 1630. By October of the same year, other settlements like Dorchester and Watertown were also established. During the harsh winter of 1631, the colonists faced great suffering, but were saved from a potential famine by the arrival of supplies. This marked a turning point for the colony, with the court of assistants resuming their sessions and focusing on economic and social matters. The influence of Puritanism grew, leading to the establishment of a theocracy.

In the early days of the Massachusetts colony, the court of assistants held immense power, controlling both judicial and legislative decisions. Citizenship was tied to church-membership, and the Bible served as the only recognized law book. Ministers were seen as the best interpreters of the Bible, and magistrates consulted them on important matters. Offenses were viewed not just as breaking the law but as sins, ranging from minor infractions like wearing long hair to serious accusations of witchcraft. Over time, modifications occurred. In 1632, a tax for a fortification led to the formation of a board with town delegates advising on taxes. By 1634, a general court with elected delegates shared legislative powers. Despite changes, the court of assistants retained significant authority due to its ability to create laws, constant tenure, and discretionary powers. Challenges from England threatened the colony, but the growing population and influx of Puritan ministers strengthened the Massachusetts theocracy.|['1.

This was a significant crisis in the history of the colony. The governor and assistants replied to Mr. Cradock that the charter could only be returned by the general court, not in session at that time. Simultaneously, orders were issued to fortify Castle Island, Dorchester, and Charlestown. During this intense moment, Endicott reappeared, making a dramatic impact on history. He strongly disliked the cross on the English flag, calling it antichrist, and personally removed it from the company's ensign in Salem. Endicott faced criticism from the general court for his actions. However, the cross was eventually removed from all flags except the one at the fort in Boston Harbor. Massachusetts also took steps to protect its interests in England. The Plymouth government sent Edward Winslow to England in July 1634 to present a humble petition. Despite Winslow's diplomatic skills, he was imprisoned for seventeen weeks in Fleet Prison due to Laud's influence. Gorges and Mason quickly acted on their victory, dividing the New England coast into twelve parts. This division led to various individuals receiving different territories. Despite challenges from the English government, Massachusetts continued to assert its independence and expand its territory.|"[""1.

"The enforcement of the 1631 law that required membership in the Congregational church for citizenship, combined with the influx of talented ministers who resented persecution against the Anglican church, solidified the bond and made it enduring. The clergy's role was to interpret ""God's word,"" making it the state law. This church influence led to stricter limitations on religious practices and thoughts compared to the mother country. In Massachusetts, even Puritans who didn't adhere to the prescribed church government were marginalized, bearing the burdens of church and state without a voice in governance. This contradiction caused discontent and resistance, exemplified by instances like Richard Brown's defiance in 1631. The religious authoritarianism faced opposition from figures like Roger Williams, who challenged the Massachusetts government's practices and beliefs, leading to his eventual exile."|"['1.

In January 1634, when Williams faced the court, their concerns shifted to vague phrases in a document that seemed critical of the king. Williams clarified these expressions, professing loyalty and taking the oath of allegiance, which led to his forgiveness. The court's behavior may have been influenced by fears that the Massachusetts charter would be revoked by Ferdinando Gorges in England. Despite initial forgiveness, in November 1634, Williams faced new accusations for speaking against the king's patent and terming English churches as antichristian. The court, now under Deputy Governor Thomas Dudley, showed a change in attitude towards the English government. Williams continued to face challenges, objecting to legislation requiring oaths to defend the charter. This led to his banishment in October 1635 after refusing to renounce his beliefs. Despite attempts to silence him, Williams persisted in his convictions and eventually established a new settlement in Narragansett Bay.|"[""1.

Thirty-five years later, Williams reflected on a challenging time he faced during a harsh winter, where he felt lost and in need. Despite this, the kindness of the Pokanoket Indians, whom he had befriended, provided him with some land by the Seekonk River. However, the authorities of Massachusetts extended their reach to him even there. Governor Winslow advised Williams to move across the river to avoid displeasing the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Williams, along with five friends, then set up a settlement in Providence in June 1636. This marked the beginning of Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, the ruling class strictly regulated religion, focusing on God's wrath and eternal punishment. The teachings of pastors like John Cotton, emphasizing divine mercy and love, attracted many followers. Mrs. Anne Hutchinson, a member of Cotton's church, became popular for her care for others and began sharing her views on religious matters, which led to controversy within the church.|"['1.

At this time, Governor Harry Vane added a political dimension to the existing challenges. Vane, a religious convert, gave up courtly honors to visit Massachusetts with his parents' approval. Shortly after arriving in 1636, he became the governor at just twenty-four, with John Winthrop as deputy governor. Amidst turmoil over the Wheelwright election, Vane, weary of the colony's strife, tried to resign citing personal matters. However, moved by the impending French and Indian threats, he withdrew his resignation. The religious tensions escalated with Mrs. Hutchinson's supporters rallying around Vane. The ministers clashed with Vane, and the legalists retaliated by summoning Wheelwright for his sermon. The turmoil culminated in the May election at Newtown, where Vane's faction suffered a significant defeat, returning Winthrop to the governorship and sidelining Vane and his allies.|"[""1.

In 1637, the legalists gained power and moved to silence their opponents. A decree was issued allowing no one to shelter newcomers for more than three weeks without permission. This was to prevent support for Mrs. Hutchinson from England. Vane departed for England, weakening the Hutchinson faction. A synod of ministers met, identifying around eighty heresies in the colony. The synod focused on five potential deviations from orthodox beliefs. Wheelwright faced banishment for his sermon. Mrs. Hutchinson was banished after a two-day trial. Winthrop, acting as prosecutor and judge, ordered her to leave the colony. Mrs. Hutchinson retreated to Providence and then Aquidneck. The suppression of dissenters led to peace but stifled free speech and literature in Massachusetts. The government remained aristocratic, with limited room for democratic expression.|['1.

The island of Aquidneck, where Mrs. Hutchinson settled, was obtained from the Narragansett sachems by Roger Williams and other leaders. Initially known as Pocasset and later as Portsmouth, it became a political entity with William Coddington as chief judge. Additional settlers led to the establishment of Newport in 1639, later uniting with Portsmouth in 1640. The area was eventually renamed Rhode Island in 1644. Meanwhile, Roger Williams founded Providence, with Patuxet becoming a separate township in 1640 and Samuel Gorton founding Shawomet in 1643. Massachusetts' oppressive policies caused conflicts with these settlements, especially targeting figures like Mrs. Hutchinson and Gorton. Despite their resistance, Massachusetts continued its attempts to exert control over the region, leading to confrontations and disputes.|['1.

In the past, a tragic event unfolded involving Miantonomoh, Gorton's friend, who faced a grim fate at the hands of the Mohegans led by Uncas. Miantonomoh, after accepting the war challenge, was defeated and captured by Uncas. Gorton intervened by writing a letter to save his friend, but Uncas decided to leave Miantonomoh's fate in the hands of the federal commissioners in Boston. The commissioners, though urged to impose the death penalty, found no grounds to do so. Consequently, Miantonomoh was handed over to Uncas, who executed him. Gorton and his followers faced opposition from Massachusetts and were imprisoned but later banished. Despite the challenges, Roger Williams played a crucial role in securing Rhode Island's independence and self-governance, ensuring a peaceful existence for the residents.|"['1.

The Anabaptists, also known as Baptists, emerged in New England after the banishment of Mrs. Hutchinson. Rhode Island became a refuge for them, with Roger Williams embracing their beliefs in 1638. A Baptist church was founded in Newport in 1644. However, Massachusetts passed a law that year banishing those who followed these new ideas. In 1650, three prominent Baptists were mistreated in Massachusetts, leading to an uproar in Rhode Island. John Clarke and Roger Williams were sent to England to counteract Coddington's actions. With the help of Sir Harry Vane, they succeeded in revoking Coddington's commission. Rhode Island's consolidation was completed in 1658 when Massachusetts relinquished its jurisdiction. Roger Williams' advocacy for religious freedom was evident when he issued a warrant for the arrest of William Harris in 1656 for disturbing the peace with his views. The early relationships between the Dutch and English colonies were amicable, with the Dutch advising the Plymouth settlers to relocate to the Connecticut River valley. The Mohegan Indians also encouraged settlement in the area. Edward Winslow confirmed the region's suitability in 1632. Despite efforts by the Indians to enlist Boston's aid, Governor Winthrop declined.|"['1.

In July 1633, Bradford and Winslow visited Boston to discuss a joint trading-post plan but faced objections about the sand-bar, ice, and Indians. Despite these, Plymouth sent a vessel in October 1633 with William Holmes to establish a trading-post. Upon arrival, they found the Dutch already there. The Dutch, feeling threatened by English growth, had built a fort. Holmes, undeterred by the Dutch commander's demand to stop, set up a post at Windsor. Meanwhile, a ship sent by Winthrop to Connecticut informed the Dutch of English territorial claims. Tensions rose, leading to armed confrontations. The Plymouth settlers faced challenges from both the Dutch and Massachusetts residents. The desire for land and political differences prompted some to seek new settlements. Rev. Thomas Hooker advocated for a more democratic government, leading to debates and petitions for relocation.|"[""1.

The popularity of the measure grew significantly, and there is a belief that in the winter of 1634-1635, some individuals from Watertown journeyed to Connecticut and survived the winter in a few huts at Pyquag, later known as Wethersfield. Subsequently, the people of Watertown and Dorchester followed the Newtown congregation's lead and sought permission from the general court to relocate. They were successful and allowed to move anywhere, even outside Massachusetts, as long as they remained under Massachusetts authority. This sparked a lively migration, with small groups of settlers arriving daily by land and water. The settlers' numbers and confidence grew, leading to conflicts with the Plymouth settlers over land ownership. The emigration continued in the summer of 1635, with a group of about sixty individuals, along with their livestock, embarking on a challenging journey to Connecticut. However, they faced harsh winter conditions and food shortages, eventually returning to Boston. Despite the hardships, the settlers persisted and prepared for further migration in the spring of 1636, led by ministers Thomas Hooker and Samuel Stone. This marked the establishment of three townships below Springfield, which were later renamed Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor. The settlements exemplified the New England colonization model, with organized communities migrating together under church leadership.|"['1.

"In 1635, unauthorized colonies led Saltonstall to dispatch twenty men to establish a settlement on the Connecticut River. However, the Dorchester settlers treated them poorly, driving them out. John Winthrop, Jr., arrived in October 1635 with a commission to govern the ""river Connecticut."" He built Fort Saybrook in November 1635, appointing Lyon Gardiner to command. The Dutch, arriving unexpectedly, retreated, preventing a Dutch attack. The towns on the Connecticut were governed by a commission from Massachusetts.

Danger approached the new settlements along the river, with the English facing a united Indian threat. The Pequots sought peace with the Narragansetts but were thwarted by Roger Williams, who convinced the Narragansett chiefs to ally with the English instead. As tensions escalated in 1637, violence erupted, starting with an attack on Wethersfield. Responding swiftly, Connecticut raised a force led by Captain John Mason, who orchestrated a surprise attack on the Pequot fort. The English victory was brutal, resulting in the near annihilation of the Pequot tribe. Mason's forces then pursued the remaining Pequots, leading to further clashes and the eventual demise of the Pequot chief, Sassacus.

The Pequot nation faced complete destruction after the war. Most captives were enslaved, with some remaining in New England and others sent to the West Indies. Only about 200 Pequots were left in Connecticut. A treaty in 1638 transferred Pequot land to Connecticut towns, with 100 Pequots given to Uncas and another 100 to Miantonomoh and Ninigret. The war provided a 40-year reprieve from Indian threats in Connecticut. The Fundamental Orders, adopted in 1639, established Connecticut's first written constitution. The government was theocratic, with church membership not initially required for voting. The colony rapidly expanded its jurisdiction, annexing towns like Fairfield, Stratford, and Norwalk. Meanwhile, the New Haven colony, founded by John Davenport, aimed to create a theocratic state but ultimately settled independently due to disagreements with Massachusetts.|['1.

"After the Pequot War, explorers like Theophilus Eaton ventured west from Fort Saybrook in 1637. Impressed by ""Quinnipiack,"" they decided to settle there, founding New Haven in 1638. They made a covenant to govern based on Scripture teachings. Without a charter, they bought land from Native Americans. In 1639, they established a government based on Scripture principles. Only church members could be citizens. A committee chose seven to create the constitution. The church and state were reorganized, and Theophilus Eaton became governor. New Haven was joined by Guilford, Milford, and Stamford, forming a confederation in 1643. A general constitution was agreed upon later that year, allowing church members to vote.

In 1622, Sir Ferdinando Gorges and Captain John Mason secured a patent for a vast area between the Merrimack and Sagadahock rivers in New England. Mason, a London merchant with experience as governor of Newfoundland, was elected vice-president of the Council for New England. They established settlements in New Hampshire and Maine, with Piscataqua and Cocheco being the main ones. Mason later obtained a patent for New Hampshire, naming it after his estate in England. They invested in fish and fur trade but paid little attention to farming, leading to a challenging existence. The settlements had different governors and saw religious conflicts, including followers of Mrs. Hutchinson seeking refuge at Cocheco. Captain John Underhill played a role in these conflicts but later faced imprisonment for plotting against the Dutch. John Wheelwright established Exeter in 1638, and the settlers there and at Cocheco adopted civil contracts similar to those in Rhode Island.|['1.

"In the early days of New Hampshire, the transformation of fishing and trading spots into proper towns marked a significant political advancement. Each town remained distinct and self-reliant until Massachusetts took the lead in uniting them under one government. Massachusetts asserted its claim to control the northern boundary by establishing a house between the Merrimac and Piscataqua rivers. This move prompted the town of Hampton to be founded in 1641 by emigrants from Norfolk, England. Following suit, Dover and Strawberry Bank (Portsmouth) sought incorporation with Massachusetts. Exeter also joined in 1643, losing its founder, Mr. Wheelwright, to banishment. The towns of Dover, Strawberry Bank, Exeter, and Hampton, along with Salisbury and Haverhill, formed the county of Norfolk. Similarly, the settlements north of the Piscataqua River were eventually named ""Maine,"" possibly as a nod to Henrietta Maria, the wife of Charles I."|"[""1.

"The Council for New England granted many patents, including one to John Beauchamp and Thomas Leverett on March 13, 1630, for a trading factory between Muscongus and Penobscot Bay. Scarboro, on Casco Bay, had conflicting grants to Richard Bradshaw and Robert Trelawney and Moses Goodyear in 1631. Another significant patent in December 1631 gave twenty-four thousand acres to Ferdinando Gorges and others near Piscataqua. Gorges later became the proprietor of the ""province or county of Maine.""

In 1646, Cleves sought the help of parliamentary commissioners to settle a land dispute with Gorges, who supported the king. The commissioners ruled in favor of Rigby, making the Kennebunk River the boundary between the two. Gorges' territory in Maine was reduced to three towns. After Gorges passed away, Maine was left without a leader. Settlers reached out to Gorges' heirs but got no response due to the chaotic times. In 1649, Edward Godfrey became governor, and the settlers declared themselves a body politic. Massachusetts warned against further actions by the settlers. Despite resistance, Massachusetts gained control over the settlements. By 1658, the plantations at Casco Bay acknowledged Massachusetts' authority, merging into Scarboro and Falmouth.|"[""1.

The history of the English colonies in America is intertwined with the actions of other European nations like Spain and France. The English colonies expanded their territories to protect themselves against foreign threats. The Spaniards claimed a monopoly over North America but were challenged by the English, who believed in the right to freely navigate and colonize unclaimed lands. The Spanish and English clashed in the West Indies, with the English establishing colonies in Barbados and other islands. The French also posed a threat, with early explorers like Jacques Cartier venturing into North America and attempting to establish colonies. The English colonies, through their expansion and conflicts, laid the foundation for the first American confederation to defend against these foreign powers.|['1.

In 1603, the French made their first organized attempt to establish colonies in America. A company led by Aymar de Chastes, governor of Dieppe, sent Samuel Champlain to explore the St. Lawrence River. Champlain returned to France with valuable furs after careful exploration. When De Chastes passed away, Pierre du Guast, Sieur de Monts, took over the mission. With governmental authority and exclusive trading privileges with the Native Americans, he set sail from Havre de Grace in 1604, reaching Sable Island and exploring Nova Scotia. They settled at Port Royal, named by Poutrincourt, after transferring from the Isle of St. Croix due to harsh winters. After three years, the Acadian settlers returned to France. Poutrincourt later returned in 1610 to re-establish the colony at Port Royal. Champlain, meanwhile, successfully founded a trading post at Quebec in 1608 and envisioned a prosperous French province in Canada.|"[""1.

The growth of the colony was disappointing to Champlain and the French authorities. In 1627, Cardinal Richelieu dissolved the company in charge and formed a new one with himself as the leader. In 1628, he sent armed ships and transports to Canada, but they were seized due to the war between England and France. The English did not recognize French claims in North America and attacked French settlements in Acadia. Sir William Alexander claimed New Scotland (now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick). In 1629, an English fleet led by David Kirke took over Quebec. However, due to a peace agreement, all conquests after April 24, 1629, had to be returned. In 1632, a treaty gave back New France, Acadia, and Canada to the French. Champlain returned to Quebec and Jesuit priests began exploring the Great Lakes and Mississippi. France appointed Chevalier Razilly as governor of Acadia, claiming dominion to Cape Cod. Quarrels arose between French leaders, leading to conflict in Acadia. The Dutch began exploring America in 1597, with Hudson's voyage in 1609 leading to the discovery of New Netherland (New York). Dutch merchants established a trade monopoly in New Netherland between New France and Virginia.|"['1.

In 1619, Thomas Dermer visited the Hudson River and informed England about the Dutch operations and the fur trade's value. Captain Samuel Argall, along with English planters, planned to settle on the Hudson. The Dutch West India Company was chartered in June 1621, which led to a protest from the English court due to Dutch activities in what was considered Virginia's limits. The States-General denied authorizing any settlement on the Hudson. The Dutch established the first colony in America in 1622, with French Walloons. They built Fort Nassau near present-day Philadelphia and Fort Orange in Albany. Peter Minuit succeeded May and bought Manhattan Island from the Indians. The Dutch faced challenges from English settlers, Swedes, and conflicts with Native Americans, leading to a series of territorial disputes and clashes.|"[""1.

In 1639, John Haynes and Rev. Thomas Hooker from Connecticut visited Boston to discuss forming a confederation. However, a dispute over boundaries between Plymouth and Massachusetts delayed the confederation. After nearly three years, a confederacy was still not established. Then, in September 1642, news arrived that the Indians were planning to attack the English. This alarming situation prompted a more favorable response to Connecticut's proposal for a league. By May 1643, commissioners from Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and New Haven signed a compact forming the United Colonies of New England. The confederation aimed to maintain friendship, defense, and mutual aid among the colonies. The federal government, managed by eight commissioners, would address matters of war, peace, and more. Despite initial challenges, the confederacy brought together about 23,500 residents from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Plymouth, and New Haven, ensuring their safety and unity.|"[""1.

"The federal commissioners played a significant role in the relations between the colonies and the Native Americans in the 17th century. The charter of Massachusetts aimed to Christianize the indigenous people, leading to the establishment of the first mission in 1643 on Martha's Vineyard by Thomas Mayhew. John Eliot followed suit, preaching to the Indians near Watertown and establishing colonies at Nonantum and Concord. The efforts were supported by a society in England, and by 1674, there were around four thousand ""praying Indians.""

The commissioners showed firmness and sent a complaint to Massachusetts, asking to avoid further disputes about Springfield. Massachusetts eventually gave in and removed the tax, but Connecticut continued taxing Springfield. Despite the debate over Connecticut's tax, Massachusetts had come close to nullification. The commissioners also interacted with the French and Dutch. De la Tour sought help in Boston against D'Aulnay, his rival, and was permitted to hire men and ships due to his commission. De la Tour attacked D'Aulnay with Boston men's help but failed to dislodge him. When D'Aulnay returned, Massachusetts made a treaty for free trade.

During the 17th century, the Dutch and English colonies in North America had their fair share of conflicts and negotiations. Massachusetts played a key role in advocating for peace, despite some tensions with the Dutch. Governor William Kieft of New Netherland understood the importance of maintaining friendly relations with Massachusetts. However, issues arose, such as complaints about Connecticut encroaching on Dutch territory. Over time, diplomatic efforts were made to address these disputes, with the intervention of the Mohawks leading to a peace agreement in 1645. Subsequently, Governor Peter Stuyvesant sought to establish clear territorial boundaries between the Dutch and English colonies, leading to arbitration and the delineation of boundaries in 1650. This diplomatic resolution, though criticized by some, marked an important step towards peaceful coexistence between the two colonial powers.|"['1.

In 1651, New Haven tried to establish a colony in Delaware, but the attempt failed. Wealthy merchants faced setbacks, including the loss of a ship carrying valuable cargo and citizens. Tensions rose between New Haven and New Amsterdam, with Governor Stuyvesant arresting New Haven's men. Rumors of Dutch-Indian conspiracies spread, leading to war hysteria in Connecticut and New Haven. Connecticut seized a Dutch fort in Hartford, preparing for war. When Cromwell's fleet arrived in Boston in 1654, Connecticut and New Haven were eager to attack the Dutch. However, news of a peace treaty between England and Holland halted the conflict. Massachusetts' peace policy clashed with the aggressive stance of Connecticut and New Haven, causing strains within the New England colonies and the confederacy's dissolution.|"[""1.

The Parliament's authority transfer to New England boosted her confidence, but tensions arose. In 1644, a Parliament-commissioned ship attacked a royalist-friendly vessel in Boston, leading to a protest. Another incident involved a Dartmouth ship, resulting in Winthrop confronting the attacker. The demand for broader suffrage faced resistance. A petition by Presbyterian leaders was deemed seditious, leading to fines and imprisonment. A synod was convened in 1646 to discuss church governance. By 1648, a church government plan was agreed upon, emphasizing unity. The synod adopted a platform aligning with the Westminster confession, with the power to exclude offending churches. Despite the organization, the Calvinistic faith's influence persisted, marking a conservative era in Massachusetts. The deaths of Winthrop and Cotton ushered in new leaders, Endicott and Norton, known for their intolerance. The population in New England was growing, with a focus on trade and industries like ship-building, textiles, glass, and iron works.|['1. What incident led to a protest in Boston in 1644?\nA.

In the early days of Massachusetts, each town governed itself through a system of town meetings. The concept of town government began in Dorchester in 1633, followed by Watertown and Charlestown. These town meetings were crucial for local decision-making, appointing town officers, setting laws for common areas, managing herds, and more. The town system also enabled popular education, with the first public school in Boston in 1635. By 1647, Massachusetts required towns with fifty households to teach reading and writing, and those with a hundred households to establish grammar schools. Connecticut adopted similar laws in 1650. Despite these laws, education quality varied, with parents often having to pay teachers. John Harvard's donation led to the establishment of Harvard College in 1638. Throughout New England, education was limited to the privileged classes, and illiteracy was common among fishermen and small farmers. Money shortages led to the use of wampum and bartering with goods. Harsh laws governed daily life, with strict regulations against various activities and the absence of Christmas celebrations or saints' days. The penal system was rigid, with many crimes punishable by death and magistrates holding significant power to punish individuals based on suspicion.|"['1.

The Puritans in New England held high ideals, striving to create a society free from common vices. However, human nature rebelled against such strict suppression, leading to periodic outbursts of immorality. Despite this, New England's focus on history and theology produced notable works by authors like Bradford, Winthrop, Hooker, and Cotton. The era of colonization in America is richly documented in various bibliographies, including works by Justin Winsor, J.A. Doyle, and John Fiske. Doyle's insightful volumes on the Puritan colonies stand out for their philosophical depth, while Winsor's critical chapters provide valuable analysis. John Fiske's engaging writing style brings history to life, making him a popular historian. The period from 1574 to 1652 remains a fascinating chapter in American colonial history, with New England's Puritan colonies playing a central role.|"['1.
