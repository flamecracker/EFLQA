Long ago, Puck shared tales of ancient sacrifices to the Old Things, once powerful gods now fallen from grace. Men and beasts were offered in rituals until people grew weary of the demands.

"When they arrived at Otter Pool, the _Golden Hind_ gently touched the shallow bottom, and they rested under the canopy of lush greenery, observing the water flowing down the moss-covered chute from the mill-stream to the brook. A large trout, familiar to the children, leaped for a passing fly around the bend.

After the death of my Lady, signs and omens held no sway over me or Hugh. We set sail on a wine-ship bound for Bordeaux, but the wind died down near Pevensey, shrouding us in mist. Drifting westward with the tide, our company consisted mostly of French merchants, laden with wool and accompanied by three pairs of tall hunting dogs. The dogs belonged to a knight from Artois, marked by gold pieces on a red shield. He had a limp from a wound received during the siege of Mantes. Singing Moorish songs, he tempted us to join him in his return to war against the Moors in Spain. However, our fate took a sharp turn when a silent Danish ship collided with us, causing Hugh to fall overboard. I followed, and we were captured by the Danes, led by their captain, Witta. Despite their initial hostility, a mysterious Yellow Man intervened, freeing us from our bonds.

Witta, a seasoned sea captain, loaded the ship with dried meat, fish, beans, and a sweet fruit resembling fig paste called dates. As the ship set sail, Witta advised the crew to pray, for they were embarking on a perilous journey. Sacrifices were made to pagan gods, and incense was burned before a stone idol. Despite the unconventional circumstances, the crew set out joyfully. Witta shared tales of his father's adventures, describing lands with hidden treasures and dangerous creatures. The crew encountered storms, used whale oil to calm the seas, and sought refuge near a snowy mountain. Along the African coast, they witnessed strange marine life and hot waters.

The yellow land was on the left, the grey sea on the right. As a knight, I rowed with the crew, protecting the pots of beads with seaweed. Knighthood is for the land, but at sea, a man is like a rider without a horse's bridle. I learned to tie strong knots and mend ropes under Hugh's guidance. Witta and Thorkild led the rowers, each side competing. We fetched water, fruits, and sand for the ship. We cleaned the ship by burning off the weed and smoking it with saltwater-dampened rushes. The ship's bird was the only one thriving. Our journey led us to a naked black people who traded goods for iron. Following the coast, we reached the Forest in the Sea, where trees grew from mud, and we navigated the waterways, battling fevers and monsters.|"['1.

As we journeyed through the unfamiliar terrain, we lost track of time in the dark gullies and swashes. Suddenly, a distant drumbeat led us to a wide, brown river near a hut surrounded by pumpkin fields. Relief washed over us as the sun reappeared. The villagers warmly welcomed us, and Witta, eager for gold, displayed our iron and beads. They eagerly pointed out our weapons as a sign of caution. Soon, they brought out gold bars, dust, and massive elephant tusks, laying them out as if to entice us. Their leader, a towering figure covered in reddish hair, beat his chest fiercely and gnashed his teeth. Witta, bold and shrewd, urged us to row closer to the tempting gold, but fear held us back. Despite the lure of riches, only a few dared to step onto the shore. With swords drawn and hearts pounding, we cautiously gathered the gold while keeping a wary eye on the menacing figures in the trees.|['1.

We embarked on a daring voyage, from which we returned with gold hidden beneath our ship's planks. Witta, torn between loyalty and treasure, decided to split the riches with Hugh, who planned to build a keep in England.

He placed the preserved head of the Devil, taken down by Hugh, high on our ship's front, causing other boats to flee. Surprisingly, we were more frightened for our treasure than the fleeing boats. We moved cautiously along the shore by night until we reached the chalk cliffs and then headed east to Pevensey. Witta chose not to disembark with us, despite Hugh's promise of wine at Dallington. Eager to reunite with his wife, he darted into the marshland after sundown, leaving our share of gold behind and departing on the same tide. Without making any commitments or seeking gratitude, Witta generously shared his wealth with Hugh and me. As he bid us farewell, he transferred his arm bracelets to Hugh and kissed him on the cheek.

"In late summer, as frosts arrived and the Picts tended to their bees, we ventured out hunting wolves with new hounds. Our General, Rutilianus, granted us ten days off, and we rode past the Second Wall, venturing into the hills beyond Valentia Province, where Roman ruins were scarce. By midday, we had already taken down a she-wolf. While Allo skinned the kill, he remarked, ""When you become Captain of the Wall, you won't have time for this anymore.""

"We reached the top of the scorching hill and gazed at the sea to the east, a few miles away.

In the evening, a messenger summoned us to the Temple of Victory where the General of the Wall, Rutilianus, resided. The General, a glutton with a penchant for oracles, had a grand feast prepared. Maximus, seated among scrolls of accounts, issued strict orders. He declared that we were to obey two young boys who were appointed as the leaders, with us being likened to the belly. Maximus then revealed plans to send away many of our troops, leaving us vulnerable. The towering catapults, formidable weapons on the Wall, were to remain.

He scanned the sea, spotting a lone ship unscathed beyond the reach of their catapults. After ensuring the readiness of the catapults, he signaled for the ship to approach. The vessel glided in gracefully, reminiscent of a loyal hound to its master. As it drew closer to shore, he elegantly tossed back his hair and swam out to meet it. Once safely on board, they departed. Aware of the diverse followers of Mithras, he pondered little on the incident. Initially mistaking it for a bribe meant for Rutilianus, Allo clarified it was a gift from Amal, the Winged Hat he had rescued. Amal believed in their potential to lead the Winged Hats to victory alongside the Emperor in Gaul. Allo proposed a truce, suggesting that they might unite against Maximus in the future. The Winged Hats, weary of losses, agreed to the agreement. This allowed the safe passage of corn-ships to the Picts, ensuring their well-being. Despite repeated pleas to Maximus for reinforcements, he declined, citing the need to secure his rule after defeating Emperor Gratian.|"['1.

Parnesius, a Roman soldier stationed at the Wall, shared a letter from Maximus, a former general, who was preparing to face Theodosius, the Emperor. Maximus expressed his determination to confront Theodosius and regain control. Despite the peace on the Wall, Parnesius felt the need for more men and better equipment. Maximus, confident in his victories, assured Parnesius of the Wall's safety. However, Parnesius knew the vulnerability they faced if news of Maximus's defeat spread to their enemies, the Winged Hats.

Gradually, day by day, the War crept upon us, a dreadful time for hesitant soldiers. Initially, the Winged Hats attacked from the sea, facing our catapults as before, but they grew weary of the battle. Reluctant to venture onto land, the Picts concealed routes across the heather, fearing to reveal their tribe's secrets. They acted as both spies and foes, oppressed by the Winged Hats who seized their provisions. The enemy started closing in from both ends of the Wall, and wolves roamed freely around deserted posts. Struggling to feed our ponies, we rode tirelessly, even consuming the worn-out horses. Amidst chaos, we gathered the townsfolk behind Hunno, fortifying a citadel. Engulfed in the War, it felt like a hazy dream, fighting almost unconsciously. The fiercest clashes occurred near Roma Dea's statue by Rutilianus's dwelling. Despite the odds, Rutilianus, rejuvenated, wielded his sword as an oracle, injecting humor into the grim situation. Enduring for over two months, the tension finally eased when the Winged Hats unexpectedly withdrew, allowing us a night of much-needed rest.

Looking north, we saw red snow and no Winged Hats. To the south, we glimpsed white snow and the Eagles of two strong Legions camped. East and west showed us flame and fighting, but all was calm by Hunno. A message was read by Hunno, offering a choice: serve Theodosius for a Legion or return home for a Triumph. Hobden whispered, 'Oh, Mus' Reynolds!' hinting at hidden knowledge. The Little Folk, too small to love or hate, plot to reconquer the Wall quietly. They compare themselves to mistletoe, rats, and moths, unseen but busy. They plan to guide stronger Peoples to defeat their oppressors in War. They value their roots over Nineveh Town or being swallowed by whales, for home is where true care lies.

When they ascended the attic ladder (they named it 'the mainmast tree', inspired by the ballad of Sir Andrew Barton, and Dan 'swarved it with might and main', as the ballad mentions), they spotted a man seated on Duck Window-sill. He wore a plum-colored doublet and tight plum-colored hose, engrossed in sketching in a red-edged book. The man chuckled and tipped his dark velvet cap to the children, his grizzled hair forming a stormy fringe. Despite being old, at least forty, his eyes sparkled with youth, encircled by amusing little wrinkles. A satchel of embroidered leather hung from his broad belt, piquing their curiosity. 'Surely--sure-ly!' he exclaimed, shifting to the window-seat, then resumed drawing with a silver-pointed pencil. Puck remained grinning broadly as they observed the man's swift, confident hands at work. Subsequently, he retrieved a reed pen from his satchel, carving it with a small ivory fish-shaped knife. 'Watch your fingers! This blade is dangerously sharp. I fashioned it myself from the finest Low Country cross-bow steel. And this fish, too.

Weapons for the King's ships, and others too. Mainly serpentines and cannons. When the weapons were made, the King's Officers would come and take our plough-oxen to drag them to the coast. Look! Here's one of the best craftsmen of the Sea! He arrived with a King's Order for twenty serpentines from Master John Collins, to equip a fleet of ships. I remember him sitting by our fire, telling my mother about the new lands he would discover on the other side of the world. And he did find them! Cabot was his name, a lad from Bristol, part foreigner. I held him in high regard. He helped me with building my church. Hal said, 'Foundations before roofs.' Sebastian guided me. I had come here not to serve God as a craftsman should, but to show off my skills. The townspeople didn't care, and they were right not to. They questioned why I was meddling with old St Barnabas'. The church had been in ruins since the Black Death, and they believed it would remain that way. Only Sir John Pelham encouraged me to continue. But how could I? I asked Master Collins for timber to haul beams, but the oxen were gone. I requested iron cramps for the roof, but they never arrived or were faulty. Everything was a failure.

Sebastian spent six weeks at Lindens and only got six serpentines.

The Marsh is a mysterious and ancient place, filled with steeples, wise women, and the sea looming over the land. Ditches and sluices crisscross the area, with the tide bubbling and the sea roaring. The flatness of the Marsh deceives, as the twisting roads can lead you astray. The waters have been drained into ditches, removing the fevers that once plagued the area. Bees and ducks thrive there now. Legend has it that since ancient times, the Pharisees favored the Marsh, dancing boldly and locking church doors against clergy.

Elias and I sailed to Bury, England, a place lacking wise men. At Bury, I managed Elias's accounts and witnessed the cruelty towards Jews. Despite lending money to the King, Elias stayed unharmed due to the King's favor. The King's oppression of his people stemmed from a thirst for money. The King's lack of understanding led to pestilence and famine among his people. Consequently, the people turned against the Jews, seen as everyone's scapegoats. The Barons and the people united against the King's tyranny to protect themselves. The Barons, realizing the King's destructive path, devised new laws to restrain him. As Jews in Bury, we were privy to their plans, seeking power rather than just monetary repayment. Elias, aware of the people's cruelty, chose to align with the King for safety.|"[""1.

"Elias and Adah argued loudly upstairs, and I, realizing Adah's strength, knew Elias would reveal the gold to the King, who would remain stubborn. Feeling the need to protect the gold, I was suddenly inspired by the Lord, who spoke to me, saying, ""The Morning has come, O inhabitant of the land."" I left the house, closing the door on the commotion. As I did, Adah looked out the window and whispered about convincing Elias to tell the King. I assured her it was unnecessary as the Lord was guiding me. The Lord provided me with a plan, leading me to London for essential medicines and then swiftly to Pevensey. Despite chaos around me, people feared me, believing me to be Ahasuerus, a Jew cursed to live forever. I bought a boat and moored it at the Castle's Marsh-gate. I strategically caused a minor rash outbreak in the Castle using harmless drugs, creating the illusion of a plague. The people blamed me and drove me inside the Castle, leaving me alone with the treasure. I prophesied that I would be a Lawgiver to a foreign people with a difficult language, knowing I would not die. I discovered a hidden well in the wall and, over time, collected loads of gold from it."|"['1.
