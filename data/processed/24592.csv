Farmer Green chuckled at Johnnie's disappointment but promised to make things right. Johnnie, knowing his father's ways, brightened up. The next day, Farmer Green returned with a tiny white lamb for Johnnie, named Snowball. Despite old dog Spot's initial disapproval, Johnnie and Snowball became fast friends. Snowball even followed Johnnie into the farmhouse when Mrs. Green wasn't around. One day, Johnnie proudly mentioned that Snowball was as smart as a dog, which startled Spot. Spot doubted if Snowball could protect a baby like he did for Johnnie. The Muley Cow predicted that Johnnie might tire of Snowball once others teased him about the lamb's constant presence.|"['1.

Johnnie Green and his dad set off to the village with their horse, Ebenezer. Spot, the dog, would have tagged along if he hadn't been chasing woodchucks in the pasture. To prevent Spot from running all the way to the village, Johnnie lifted Snowball, the lamb, into the wagon. Snowball excitedly shared his adventure with everyone, except Henrietta Hen, who was more interested in boasting about her own visit to the county fair. Henrietta warned Spot about Snowball trying to follow the wagon, but Spot remained calm, hoping that Johnnie would eventually tire of Snowball's company. Despite Henrietta's meddling, Spot believed that Johnnie would soon realize that Snowball's journey was nothing compared to other adventures.|"['1.

After Snowball returned from the village, old dog Spot stayed close to the farmyard. He let the woodchucks roam freely, feeling responsible for watching over Snowball. Spot predicted that Mrs. Green would soon move Snowball to the pasture, away from everyone. The next morning, Johnnie Green reluctantly headed to school, arriving late amid a commotion. The teacher struggled to calm the class as they laughed at Johnnie's tardiness. Meanwhile, Snowball enjoyed his time in the pasture, mingling with the sheep, woodchucks, and even Mr. Crow.

"""Don't worry,"" the elderly man reassured Snowball. ""I know Farmer Green forgot to invite me. I'll make sure not to upset him by staying away.""

Aunt Nancy Ewe even dismissed Snowball's worries, returning to grazing without a care. Snowball, however, remained vigilant, knowing that danger could be lurking nearby.

Johnnie wriggled through the pasture bars, dragging a sack behind him. He called out to the sheep, and they sprinted towards the bars. Snowball, however, dashed the opposite way, scaling a stone wall and vanishing into a thicket of berry bushes in an abandoned pasture. Snowball suspected Johnnie was trying to trick the sheep with salt, but he was relieved to have been warned by Mr. Crow. Aunt Nancy scolded Snowball for listening to Mr. Crow's ideas. Johnnie, inspired by the circus, attempted to train Snowball to perform tricks. It took a lot of effort, but eventually, Snowball successfully leaped through a hoop.

Johnnie Green spent the afternoon in the woodshed, crafting hoops out of old barrels and newspapers. He meticulously cut and pasted the newspapers, creating four fine hoops. As he milked the cows, he dreamt of training the Muley Cow to jump through a hoop. Lost in his thoughts, Johnnie's slow milking irritated the Muley Cow, who flicked her tail across his cheek. Nearby, a black lamb advised Snowball to run away when called by Johnnie, warning that he might ask Snowball to jump through hoops again. The black lamb had heard Snowball's tale of the previous day's hoop-jumping adventure.|"['1.

"""Are you coming?"" asked the black lamb. ""I won't stay for the boy to catch me or jump through hoops. I'm not that silly,"" it said firmly. Johnnie planned to keep the lamb in the barn until he could teach it tricks without a chase. Pleased with Snowball's jump, Johnnie rewarded him with cracked corn. Snowball forgot his fear of the barn tiger and finally leaped through a hoop. Snowball no longer ran from Johnnie but eagerly awaited treats.

Snowball quickly learned that Uncle Jerry Chuck was startled by the noise of the flock leaping onto the ledge, mistaking it for an earthquake. Snowball enjoyed seeing Uncle Jerry shiver and hearing his teeth chatter. Despite being scolded for leading the flock in games, Snowball found himself inadvertently running towards the stone wall with the flock following. Aunt Nancy, struggling to keep up, was the last to leap over the wall.

Uncle Jerry Chuck was tired of the sheep disturbing his peace by jumping the wall near his home. He warned them to choose a different spot, as their constant commotion was causing him to lose sleep.

Snowball, now fearful of bears, raced towards the wall only to realize that Aunt Nancy was the one following him. In the chaos that ensued, Snowball found himself stuck face to face with Aunt Nancy in a tangle of sheep. Aunt Nancy reprimanded him for his lack of manners.

"When Aunt Nancy heard the word ""bear,"" she shouted loudly. She swiftly turned around on the wall, accidentally knocking Snowball off. The bear remained silent, surprising Snowball, who expected the bear to compliment him. Snowball's tail was stuck, and he was puzzled by the situation. Upon regaining consciousness, Snowball found no bear but noticed the last sheep had disappeared. A stone rested on his tail, dropped there by the departing sheep. After freeing his tail, Snowball hurried to rejoin the flock. As Snowball matured, he discovered the joy of butting, a new pastime for him. He was cautious not to butt larger sheep or Johnnie Green, whom he liked.

The situation was quite peculiar. Red, who was usually eager to play, had never shown interest in swinging anyone before. Johnnie took advantage of the opportunity and enjoyed swinging back and forth. Unbeknownst to Johnnie, Snowball, who was behind Red, seemed to want to join in the fun, or rather, join in with a horn. Snowball would lower his head and shake it, even stamping on the ground. Red, realizing this, quickly climbed into a nearby wagon for safety. However, Snowball seemed to have exhausted his energy and stood still, dazed. Johnnie, after catching his breath, noticed Snowball's unusual calmness, which displeased him as he had hoped Snowball would butt Red. Later, Johnnie encountered Red at a swimming hole, marking their first meeting since the incident with Snowball.|"['1.

When Johnnie saw Red in the water, he hesitated for a moment, thinking he might find Red's clothes on the shore tied in knots. Red was known for this prank of tying hard knots in other boys' clothes, sometimes even wetting them to make them harder to untie. Red greeted Johnnie and whispered to the others, causing them all to grin. One boy remarked about Johnnie choosing swimming over swinging. Ignoring the teasing, Johnnie dove underwater. When he resurfaced, everyone yelled, except Red, who pretended innocence. After a fun swim with races and splashing, Red sneaked away and tied knots in everyone's clothes. As Red stood on a rock taunting them, the boys distracted him to prevent him from noticing Snowball sneaking up behind him. Red, enjoying a verbal battle, engaged in name-calling with the boys, unaware of the approaching Muley Cow.|"[""1.

Snowball spotted Red and found him enticing. As Snowball approached, Red leaned forward, taunting Johnnie Green, warning him to keep his lamb away. Before Red could finish his threat, Snowball charged at him, sending Red flying into the swimming hole. Johnnie Green jokingly remarked that Red meant the side towards home to avoid getting wet. Red, soaked, angrily left, leaving a trail of water. Johnnie and his friends moved their clothes to a sunny rock, untying the knots Red had made. Snowball, not part of Farmer Green's flock, found the sheared sheep amusing. Seeing the black ram without its fleece, Snowball briefly mistook it for a dog.
