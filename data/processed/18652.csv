"Henrietta Hen's neighbors usually ignored her bragging, as they were accustomed to hearing it frequently. However, one day she became unusually loud, calling out, ""Come-come-come! See-what-I've-got!"" Her friends, curious about her excitement, went to her nest in the haymow. Despite old Whitey's attempts to spoil the mood, they clucked their approval of Henrietta's first brood of chicks. Henrietta then began teaching her chicks important skills like finding food, drinking water, and avoiding danger. She warned them about hawks and even Miss Kitty Cat. Henrietta's fear of water led her to keep her chicks away from wet grass and rain. One of her chicks was particularly mischievous, often lingering near puddles. One day by the duck-pond, Henrietta had a scare when one of her chicks ventured too close to the water's edge."|"[""1.

Mr. Crow loved to boast about himself to Henrietta Hen, but she cleverly redirected him to the Rooster for answers. The Rooster, proud and important, ruled the farmyard and demanded respect from all.

The Rooster felt embarrassed when Henrietta Hen teased him about his crowing. She warned him to hold onto his first crow until sunrise, or she wouldn't get any sleep.

When Henrietta Hen's visitors gathered around her cozy nest in the haymow, they anticipated something extraordinary. However, upon peering into the little hollowed-out spot in the hay, they couldn't help but feel let down. Henrietta Hen appeared quite unhappy when they didn't react with amazement. This was rather impolite of her, especially considering the wisdom of old Whitey, the eldest hen in the flock. Whitey knew all about nests, eggs, and roosts. As Henrietta Hen fretted about the situation, she sought advice from Whitey, who scrambled up to the haymow to assist. The next day, Johnnie Green discovered Henrietta's nest and the eggs within. To everyone's surprise, it turned out that one of the eggs was actually a fake, placed there to trick Henrietta.

Henrietta Hen's heart raced as she dropped some cabbage, startled by Jimmy Rabbit's odd question about cabbage causing long ears. Worried about her beauty, she hurriedly left the garden when Spot the dog barked. Chatting with Ebenezer the horse, she expressed her disinterest in haying news, not wanting to think about the hard work ahead. Henrietta Hen, unimpressed by horses, found them too greedy for grain.

During the summer, Henrietta Hen freely explored the farmyard, always returning for feeding time. She avoided the henhouse unless there was food, preferring to nest in various spots. As nights grew colder, she sought shelter with her companions in the henhouse, sleeping early and undisturbed until the Rooster's crow at dawn. Occasionally, a squawking hen mistook sounds for a fox, disrupting the peace. Such interruptions left Henrietta unsettled, often dreaming of Fatty Coon's presence. Yet some nights passed quietly, filled with pleasant dreams of corn and cabbage. Upon waking, she would peck at her breakfast, relieved that her earlier feasts were only dreams. Surprised by the Rooster's silence one morning, Henrietta playfully chided him, wondering if he was ignoring her.|"['1.
