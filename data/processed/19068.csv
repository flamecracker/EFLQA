Once upon a time, a cock and a hen went to a nut mountain. They agreed to share any nuts they found. The hen discovered a large nut but kept it to herself.

Once upon a time, a poor miller had a beautiful daughter. The miller boasted to the king that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Intrigued, the king summoned the miller's daughter and locked her in a room filled with straw, demanding that she spin it into gold by morning. Distraught, she wept until a little man appeared and offered to help. He spun the straw into gold in exchange for her necklace. The next night, the king demanded more gold. Again, the little man helped her, this time for her ring. On the third night, the king demanded even more gold, promising to marry her if she succeeded. The little man helped once more, but this time she had nothing left to give. Desperate, the little man asked for her first-born child in return. The miller's daughter agreed. When the king discovered the gold, he married her. When their first child was born, the little man returned to claim his prize. The miller's daughter begged him to reconsider, and he agreed if she could guess his name within three days. After much searching, she discovered his name was Rumpelstiltskin.

After the fox advised the king's son on how to obtain the golden horse, the young man ignored the instructions and chose to saddle the horse with the golden saddle instead of the plain one. The horse neighed, alerting the grooms who then captured the king's son and imprisoned him. Facing a death sentence, the king offered a chance for the young man to live if he could bring back the golden horse. Despite the setback, the fox reappeared to help the king's son. The fox then guided the young man to the golden castle where the princess resided. The fox instructed him to kiss the princess as she went to the bathhouse and lead her away without letting her bid farewell to her parents. However, the plan failed, and the young man was imprisoned once again. The king then set a new challenge for the young man to level a mountain within eight days to win the princess's hand in marriage.
