Father had been absent in the countryside for a few days. Peter pinned all his hopes on his Father to fix his broken Engine. Father was incredibly skilled with his hands, capable of repairing various things. He had even saved the wooden rocking-horse and the doll's cradle in the past. Peter, with selfless courage, waited until after Father's meal to mention the Engine. Father, with optimism, suggested that they needed more than hope to repair it. He proposed dedicating a Saturday afternoon to fix it, involving everyone. Meanwhile, the family was interrupted by visitors seeking donations. Mother tried to distract the children with a fairy tale, but the serious voices from the library made it challenging.

The children were greeted by the sight of their first train on the railway, a place that would soon hold a special place in their hearts. Little did they know then the deep affection they would develop for the railway and the significant role it would play in their lives. As they embarked on a chilly walk to their new home, Peter's nose felt unusually cold, Roberta's hat was askew, and Phyllis's shoe-laces had come undone. The journey was dark and muddy, with Phyllis even falling into a puddle absentmindedly. Upon reaching their new home, a dimly lit kitchen greeted them, stark and bare. Despite the lack of warmth and comfort, their mother tried to lift their spirits by calling it an adventure and promising a supper prepared by Mrs. Viney. The children explored the dark, dusty rooms, each filled with a mismatch of furniture, a stark contrast to their cozy old home.|"['1.

The cellar door from the kitchen led down five wooden steps. The children found it unusual because the ceiling was as high as the kitchen's. Inside, they discovered a bacon-rack, wood, coal, and big cases. Excitedly, they found candles and lit them, even though there were a few mishaps. After tidying up, they all enjoyed a delightful supper with biscuits, sardines, and more. Mother assured them there were no rats and left her door open in case of any mice. As they settled in for the night, Roberta woke early, eager to start the day in their new home. She encouraged her siblings to join her in getting things ready before their mother woke up.|"[""1.

They quickly dressed in silence and headed to the yard to wash under the pump spout since there was no water in their room. One pumped while the other washed, creating a splashy but interesting scene. The back kitchen had a low thatched roof covered in moss, house-leeks, stonecrop, and flowers. After lighting a fire and preparing breakfast with makeshift items, they set out to find the garden but couldn't locate it, only seeing stables and fields. The hilly landscape revealed a railway line and a tunnel. Tired from their morning adventures, they fell asleep on a large stone.

The children spent the day assisting their mother in unpacking and organizing their new home. Their legs ached from running around, carrying clothes and crockery to their designated spots. As the afternoon waned, their mother suggested they take a break. Looking at each other, they shared the same unspoken question and answer. Climbing onto the fence, they heard a rumbling sound from a nearby tunnel. A train emerged, roaring past them, causing the pebbles to jump and rattle. Walking along the railway, they observed the telegraph wires humming above. The station was bustling with crossing lines and heaps of coal. When the Porter appeared, Peter inquired about the white mark on the coal. The children adapted to their new life without their father, embracing the beauty of their surroundings and the enchantment of their mother's stories during tea-time.|"['1.

Peter and his friends turned the attic into a bandit's lair, with Peter as the bandit and Bobbie as his loyal lieutenant. Phyllis, Bobbie's sister, played the role of the captured maiden. Peter kept a secret adventure plan, but when caught mining coal from the yard, the Station Master caught him. Peter defended himself, saying he thought mining coal wasn't stealing.

After the exciting adventure in Peter's Coal-mine, the children decided to avoid the station. However, their fascination with the railway persisted. Accustomed to the bustling city life, the quiet countryside was a stark contrast. The only connection to their past was the passing trains. They learned the schedules and even named the trains. The Green Dragon, the Worm of Wantley, and the Fearsome Fly-by-night became familiar. One day, they saw an old gentleman on the Green Dragon. The children waved to the train, hoping the magic dragon would carry their love to their absent father. Despite their initial misgivings, they began to appreciate Aunt Emma's practical gifts for the outdoors. Meanwhile, Mother was engrossed in her writing, sending and receiving stories in colourful envelopes. Peter, feeling guilty about the coal incident, avoided the Station Master, unsure of how to face him after the theft.|"['1.

Peter felt uneasy thinking about the Station Master's words. He hurried after him, breathless and blushing. The Station Master hinted about not mentioning coal again, and Peter thanked him for resolving their issue. Feeling relieved, he headed to the village for buns. At the station, they learned from the Porter about train couplings and emergency brakes. The Porter gave Peter an envelope to jot down train numbers. Bobbie understood Mother's quiet sadness, reminiscent of her own childhood. Mother, recalling her past, advised caution, a decision that may not be easily understood by children.

Mother initially refused help, but as her condition worsened, Peter was sent to the village doctor, W. W. Forrest, for medicine. The doctor advised beef tea, grapes, beef essence, soda-water, milk, and brandy, emphasizing the importance of quality brandy. Despite Mother's reluctance due to cost, she eventually agreed to the beef broth suggestion. Roberta cared for her mother diligently, then joined her siblings. Together, they worked on a mysterious project involving sheets and paint. Bobbie stayed up all night tending to her mother's needs, even when her mother called out for her deceased grandmother. Exhausted, Bobbie prepared for the doctor's visit. The doctor instructed her to rest after ensuring someone stayed with her mother.

The bargees on the canal steered the barges while walking beside the horses on the towing-path. Peter once asked a bargee for the time and was rudely dismissed. Another day, coal was thrown at Phyllis while fishing, making her lose interest. Later, the children discovered an Aqueduct at a bridge over the canal. The Doctor assured them not to worry about bills. Bobbie felt she did the right thing parting ways with the Doctor.

The crowd remained still, captivated by a voice speaking an unfamiliar language. It wasn't French or German, nor Latin. Peter, recognizing the man at the center, attempted to communicate in French, but the man responded in an unknown tongue. As some onlookers drifted away, Peter, Phyllis, and Bobbie regretted not learning more French in school. Bobbie, surprising herself, found some French words to comfort the man. She led him to the Station Master's office, where they sought refuge from the curious crowd. Bobbie discreetly offered her handkerchief to the man in need.

They showed the man stamps from different countries, asking him with gestures if he recognized them. He shook his head at the Italian and Norwegian stamps.

When the Russian stranger was settled in for the night, Mother joined the girls in their room. Phyllis gave up her bed for Mother, finding it amusing to sleep on a mattress on the floor. Excitedly, the girls shared the stranger's story: a writer from Russia who dared to speak out against injustice and was imprisoned for three years in a dark, damp dungeon. Later, he was sent to Siberia, chained with criminals, and forced to walk for days. Despite the hardships, he held on to hope for his family. The next day, the Russian gentleman, now dressed in Father's oversized clothes, sat in the garden, smiling kindly at the children.

The kids were eager to show kindness to a man who had faced prison and Siberia for writing about poor people. They smiled and brought him flowers, surrounding him with clover, roses, and Canterbury bells. Despite their mother's visit to the Station Master about the Russian Prisoner, the children stayed close to the man for three days. They shared his story with the Porter, who understood the man's need to protect his side. Delighted by strawberries, they searched for more surprises, settling on wild cherries found near the tunnel's rocky cliff. With lunch packed and Mother's watch, they set off on an adventure to pick cherries, gazing at the railway below in awe.|"['1.

The sides of the cut were made of rough grey stone. The top part had been a natural glen cut deeper to match the tunnel's mouth level. Grass, flowers, and trees had grown among the rocks. Seeds dropped by birds had turned into bushes and trees. Near the tunnel, wooden bars acted as steps leading down to the line. Peter suggested picking cherries from the side of the steps. Suddenly, they heard a rustling sound, and saw a tree with grey leaves moving down the cutting. The tree seemed alive as it walked towards the railway line, followed by other trees. The rock on which the trees were leaned forward, causing everything to slip and fall onto the line. The children tried to wave something red to stop the train and avert an accident.

Peter suggested cutting holes in the flags and running sticks through them. The holes were made, using a sharp knife to cut the flannel. Two flags were placed near the train tracks. Phyllis and Roberta held the flags, ready to wave them when the train approached. However, as they waited, time seemed to drag on. Bobbie worried that the train might not stop in time, envisioning a disastrous crash. When the train finally neared, the girls waved the flags, hoping to prevent a tragedy.

I would like to share with you a story about a girl named Roberta. I am starting to really like her as I observe her more. Roberta has a unique quality of wanting to make others happy and being able to keep secrets. She also has the ability to show silent sympathy, which means she understands when someone is sad and loves them even more without constantly expressing pity. Roberta noticed that her mother was unhappy, even though her mother never shared the reason. Instead of prying, Roberta silently supported her mother, always wondering about her mother's sadness but respecting her privacy. Despite enjoying picnics and games, Roberta always had her mother's happiness at the back of her mind. She even tried to help a Russian gentleman who was searching for his family, showing her caring nature by trying to assist others.|"['1.

The sun was setting in red splendor over the hills, casting a serene reflection on the smooth canal. It resembled a satin ribbon amid the lush meadows. Peter's sisters, avoiding past incidents, joined him for fishing. Despite their patience, no fish nibbled. The barge was secured with ropes, not an anchor, tied to palings and crowbars. As they prepared to leave, the bargee, a hefty figure, confronted Peter, but Bobbie intervened, apologizing for the misunderstanding. The bargee, now wearing a coat, departed towards the village. Peter stood his ground, asserting his right to the public bridge.|"['1.

As the man's footsteps faded on the quiet road, the peaceful evening was undisturbed by the birds or the woman singing her baby to sleep on the barge. The melancholic tune spoke of longing for Bill Bailey to return home. The woman warned not to heed Bill's gruff exterior, blaming mischievous kids for riling him up. Suddenly, smoke billowed from the cabin, signaling danger. The slack mooring ropes caused the barge to drift, leading to a mishap where Peter fell into the canal. Phyllis helped him out, and they discovered a baby inside the smoky cabin. Amidst the chaos, the baby's cry saved the day, alerting them to the danger inside.|"['1.

The baby was carefully passed to Phyllis, who sat down by the bank to soothe the baby. Peter squeezed the water from his sleeves and knickerbocker legs, while Bobbie dashed like the wind across the bridge towards the 'Rose and Crown.' At the inn, a cozy old-fashioned room welcomed them, where barge people gathered to enjoy their evening with beer and cheese by a warm fireplace. The barge people shared stories and camaraderie, finding pleasure in each other's company. Despite initial misgivings, Bargee Bill's companions found him entertaining as he recounted a tale of his own misadventures. Later, when a mishap occurred on the barge, Bill, although stern, took responsibility without blaming others. The children, wet and weary, returned home to their anxious mother, who praised their actions and allowed them to accept a kind invitation from the bargeman.|"[""1.

It was a wonderful day as the barge smoothly glided through the calm water under the blue sky. Mr. Bill, who had once been stern, was now kind, and Mrs. Bill, the baby, and even Spot the dog were friendly. Peter and Phyllis shared their adventures of the day with their mother, feeling happy, tired, and dirty. They recounted how everyone they met was welcoming and how they were allowed to fish whenever they pleased. Bill, a helpful man, promised to guide them on their next trip. The children discussed the generosity of some people and the reluctance of others to give.

Early one morning, Bobbie woke Phyllis as they had planned. They prepared a lovely gift for Mrs. Ransome, including roses, a handmade needle-book, and a blue necktie. They left a note with the gift at the Post-office. Excited about the upcoming celebration, the children helped their mother decorate buns with pink sugar. Later, they went to the village to collect honey and other items. Mrs. Ransome, touched by their kindness, offered a pram for Mrs. Perks. She also gave peppermint cushions for the children.

"“Oh!” she whispered to the others, “whatever shall we do? I forgot to put the labels on any of the things! He won't know what's from who. He'll think it's all US, and that we're trying to be grand or charitable or something horrid.”

“I don't care,” said Perks, firmly, “not if it was an angel from Heaven. We've got on all right all these years and no favors asked. I'm not going to begin these sorts of charity goings-on at my time of life, so don't you think it, Nell.”

“Then I'll give them something to listen to,” said the angry Perks; “I've spoken my mind to them before now, and I'll do it again,” he added, and he took two strides to the wash-house door, and flung it wide open--as wide, that is, as it would go, with the tightly packed children behind it.

“Oh, no,” Bobbie answered. “NOT our own relations. All the servants always gave us things at home, and us to them when it was their birthdays. And when it was mine, and Mother gave me the brooch like a buttercup, Mrs. Viney gave me two lovely glass pots, and nobody thought she was coming the charity lay over us.”

When the children first moved to Three Chimneys, they were full of questions about their absent Father. Over time, they noticed that these questions made Mother sad. Bobbie, the eldest, sensed this early on. One day, she brought Mother tea in her workshop, a simple room with only essential furniture but brightened by flowers the children placed there. Mother, overwhelmed with work, confided in Bobbie. She revealed a deep sorrow that she and Father shared, something worse than imagined. Mother explained that while it hurt to talk about Father, forgetting him would be even more painful. To keep their Father close, Mother shared stories of his adventurous childhood.

When you walk into a tunnel on your own, the experience changes drastically from being in a train. The path is filled with shifting stones and gravel, leading downwards from the bright tracks to the dark walls. Inside, you see water trickling down, and the bricks appear dull green instead of red. Your voice sounds different in the tunnel's darkness, and it takes time for your eyes to adjust. Suddenly, the loud roar of an approaching train fills the tunnel, overwhelming your senses. As the train rushes by with a flash of light and noise, you feel the intensity of the moment. Despite the fear, the children persevere, searching for a red-jerseyed hound, hoping for a sign of life in the dim tunnel.|"['1.

In the dim tunnel, Bobbie, Peter, and the red-jerseyed boy faced a challenging situation. Despite the darkness, Bobbie's determination shone through as she carefully tended to the boy's injured leg.

Bobbie felt comforted in the darkness holding hands with the suffering man in the red jersey. Despite the challenges of talking in the dark, they found solace in each other's company.

Peter and Bobbie were playing a game of setting bones, but it turned out to be a joke that went too far. Bobbie, feeling bad for tying up Peter, quickly untied him when Dr. Forrest came by. The doctor explained to Peter that boys and girls are like little men and women, but men are usually tougher and stronger.

Life at Three Chimneys changed after the cook and housemaid, Clara and Ethelwyn, expressed their dislike for Mrs. Viney's work. Mrs. Viney only came twice a week for washing and ironing. This meant the children no longer helped with household chores. With Mother having more time, lessons became a new routine. The children found lessons dull, always wanting to switch tasks. To make lessons more enjoyable, Mother left rhymes for them. The rhymes reflected the children's feelings about their lessons. As Jim recovered, he shared stories about school life.
