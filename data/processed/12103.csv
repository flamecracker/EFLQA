Lucie hurried up the hill with her sturdy legs, racing along a steep path until she reached the top. Little-town looked tiny below her, she could have dropped a pebble down a chimney! A tin can perched on a stone to catch water overflowed, too small to hold much. Wet footprints marked the path, hinting at a small person passing by. The path led to a kitchen under a rock. Inside, everything was small, with short grass, clothes props, and tiny clothespins. Lucie met Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, a hedgehog who was ironing small garments. She explained she was an expert clear-starcher, showing Lucie garments belonging to other animals. Mrs. Tiggy-winkle aired the clothes after ironing, including a red handkerchief that smelled of onions.|"['1.
