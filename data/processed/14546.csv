Betty felt encouraged as Bob took charge. They secured the small car after breakfast and headed across the river. Following Bob's advice, they stopped at a neighborhood shop on a hilly side street where Betty had bought her blue sweater. Inside, a tall woman greeted them instead of the English girl Betty had met before. The woman explained that a family trouble led Ida, named after her aunt, a noted concert singer, to Washington. Ida left to find a place mentioned in a torn paper notice. Bobby admired a blouse left by Miss Bellethorne. Betty, trying to stay positive, suggested checking other places for her lost locket. Mrs. Staples, watching Betty strangely, didn't reveal she knew about the lost locket. The girls hurried off to search, unaware of Mrs. Staples' knowledge.|"['1.

Confessing wasn't easy, but Betty did it. She told Uncle Dick everything and was granted forgiveness. However, his forgiveness was not easy for the girl to accept.

""I know you didn't mean to be careless,"" Mr. Richard Gordon said gently. It was tough for him to scold Betty, but he knew her impulsiveness sometimes led her astray. ""But remember, Betty: The value of that locket should have made you extra careful with it.""

The loss of your lovely locket, my dear, happened because you don't fully understand the value of money and what it can buy.

Accidents can happen, and in this case, Tommy's practical joke led to a hilarious outcome with even Timothy and Libbie enjoying the fun. Tommy, despite being the prankster, found himself in a bit of trouble when the snowball incident unfolded.

Mr. Richard Gordon decided how the food on the train should be used with Major Pater. The crew had eaten all their food, leaving little for the passengers. Betty and Bobby sneaked away unnoticed while others were occupied. The train had two Pullman coaches and one day coach, with passengers confined due to the storm. Betty and Bobby ventured outside onto the snow-covered platform. They observed the weather and saw that the snow had drifted heavily, blocking the train.

Bobby and Betty found themselves in a snowy valley, watching the sun disappear behind misty clouds. Suddenly, a chilling howl echoed from the high bank, sending shivers down their spines. A shaggy beast hurtled towards them, causing panic. Bobby, stuck in the tunnel, blocked the way out, leaving Betty to face the creature alone. Thankfully, help arrived just in time. The porter and Major Pater came to their rescue, with a friendly Newfoundland dog in tow. The dog's owner, a young telegraph operator, emerged to explain the situation.

"""I know that place,"" said the telegraph operator. ""There is an easy road to it from our farm through the hills. Get there quicker than you can by the way of Cliffdale. I believe my father could drive you up there to-morrow.""

""That is all right, Mr. Gordon,"" said Fred Jaroth cheerfully. ""We often put up thirty people in the summer. We've a great ranch of a house. And I can help you up the bank yonder and beat you a path through the woods to the main road. Nothing simpler. Your trunks will get to Cliffdale sometime and you can carry your hand baggage.""

Just then a brakeman came up through the tunnel to find out if the wolf had eaten both the gentleman and his niece, and the telegraph operator went down, feet first, to find the conductor and deliver his message.

The suggestion of the telegraph operator did seem quite inspired. Mr. Gordon and Betty reentered the train to impart the decision to the others, and, as Betty had claimed, her young friends were both excited and delighted by the prospect.

In half an hour the party was off, Betty and her friends bundled up and carrying their bags while Mr. Gordon followed and Fred Jaroth led the way on his snowshoes and carrying two suitcases. He said they helped balance him and made the track through the snow firmer. As for Nero, he cavorted like a wild dog, and that, Bobby said"|"['1.

There were no seats in the hut, so they found comfort sitting on the straw, which also kept them warmer after the intense cold of the passing storm. Their breath hung in the air like frost as they talked and laughed. Mr. Jaroth's horses had cleared a path through the snow, making it easier for the sled to move. After hours of traveling, they finally reached a human dwelling. Worried about their friends caught in the blizzard, Mr. Jaroth hurried the horses. The hut was buried in snow, but they could still see the door. Inside, they found a figure huddled by a small fire. The person seemed lost in sorrow, unaware of their arrival.

Ida carried a heavy suitcase from the hut to the stockfarm, sparking curiosity among the girls and boys at Mountain Camp. The camp, nestled between two mountains with a vast lake in between, offered a breathtaking view. The snow from a recent blizzard hadn't settled on the ice due to strong winds.

Ida explained to her friends that her father had given her a filly, Ida Bellethorne, but after his death, her guardian took possession of the horse. Despite having a bill of sale naming Ida as the owner, she never received any money for the mare. Ida's story diverged from the main plot, revealing a family feud between her father and aunt, a renowned singer. Her father's death left Ida with no home or ties, and her guardian's actions seemed dishonorable to her. Determined to find her aunt, Ida carried a letter from her father, hoping for forgiveness and a connection.

Three girls and their boyfriends stayed at the farm until Dr. Pevy treated Hunchie's bad fracture and made him as comfortable as possible. Hunchie had fallen badly, shaken, and needed weeks of bed rest. Candace, the farmer, promised the best care for Hunchie and praised the mare for carrying the girl over the drifts. The group later reached Mountain Camp, where Uncle Dick expressed concern about their adventures. He restricted future outings without adult supervision. During a visit to Candace Farm, Mr. Gordon earned Ida's trust. The young folks enjoyed tobogganing near the lake, ensuring Ida was part of the fun.

The children at the gathering were getting ready to look their best. The girls showed off their lovely outfits while the boys hurried off to get ready. Ida, in particular, was dressed nicely by her friends. However, one thing puzzled Libbie - Betty wore no jewelry unlike the other girls. When asked about it, Betty explained that she wasn't allowed to wear her diamond earrings as they were old-fashioned and too mature for her. As the group prepared to head out for some sledding on the icy slopes the next morning, Uncle Dick handed Betty a letter that seemed to bring bad news.

The challenge was to reach New York before the _San Salvador_ sailed. When the girls woke early and saw a sliver of moon, they thought all was well. The storm had passed. Betty, though, was cautious. She pinched Ida's arm and asked her to stay strong. She disappeared until breakfast, leaving the group excited. The worry was not just about Ida, but also about missing classes at Shadyside and Salsette. Betty found a two-horse pung in the barn, similar to Mr. Jaroth's. Mr. Canary, the owner of a pung, explained the challenges of using it due to the icy conditions. Betty suggested tying ropes to the tongue of the pung to steer it down the hills to the station. Mr. Gordon, an engineer, carefully considered the idea.|"['1.

The group hurried to the British consulate to ensure Ida's passport was in order. Uncle Dick suggested resolving legal matters for Ida's mare before their journey to Rio Janeiro. He suspected foul play with the horse's ownership documents. The men who took the horses after Ida's father's death were well-off, and Mr. Bolter could likely recover his payment. Uncle Dick believed Ida was entitled to the mare. They rushed to the dock for the ship to Rio, where they were welcomed warmly. Miss Bellethorne agreed to let Uncle Dick handle the legal matters and care for Ida.
