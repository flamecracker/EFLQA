Once more, Ballantyne delves into the challenges faced by early settlers in the Red River basin, east of the Rockies. The pioneers battled bad men from their own and rival fur companies, Native American tribes, plagues of grasshoppers and mice, storms, and poor decisions by Lord Selkirk's advisors. The story revolves around two courageous boys, one disabled but resilient, and the other valiant. Amidst chaos, snow whipped by the wind created a blizzard of whitey-grey, embodying the Far North's demons. Two pillars, one short and broad, the other tall and stately, navigated the storm. Daniel and Fergus, the men behind the pillars, pressed on through the blizzard, driven by a purpose stronger than self-preservation. Their journey, marked by relentless snow and exhaustion, symbolized resilience and determination in the face of adversity.|"['1.

"In the wild, just like in the city, lazy individuals are recognized by their similar traits. They avoid work and prefer a laid-back attitude. They might deny their laziness if confronted, but they are too indolent to get angry. Their motto seems to be ""take it easy,"" showing a lack of motivation to put in effort. They slouch and smile in low life and act nonchalant in high society. Regardless of their status, they strive to do as little work as possible and enjoy life without guilt.

Dan and the Indian carefully prepared the sleeper for the journey, wrapping him snugly in buffalo-robes and securing him to the sledge.

"His memory faithfully reminded him that Conscience had sternly advised against taking up his gun initially. Why would Conscience speak up if his intentions were innocent?

Uneasy about being discovered, he left the murder scene after supper, fearing the victim's friends. He erased his snow-shoe tracks to avoid detection, reflecting on the wolves obscuring the body.

A loud howl of impatience suggested that the old grey wolf leader was a coward. Angered, he lunged at the mare, only to receive a powerful kick that ended his life. The other wolves, upon confirming his demise, tore him apart and consumed him. Vixen, the mare, exhausted from her heroic kick, missed the opportunity to escape due to the softening snow that favored the wolves. Just as the hungry wolves closed in, Vixen made a desperate plea for help, answered by approaching horsemen led by Dan. The wolves, unaware of the impending danger, sat confidently until the horsemen charged at them, driving fear into their hearts. The wolves, in their ignorance, underestimated the cunning of man and paid the price for their overconfidence.|"[""1.

A group of about sixty to seventy men on horseback, armed with various weapons and painted in a wild manner, approached Red River Colony. Daniel Davidson was deep in conversation with Duncan McKay at Ben Nevis House when the group passed through. The room they were in was simple, made of pine planks with minimal decoration. Duncan, a keen smoker, shared his thoughts on marriage with Daniel. He advised waiting for a minister before getting married, but Daniel expressed doubts about the promises of a minister's arrival.

"In the early 1900s, two adventurous brothers set out in a small canoe to fish. Using a piece of pork as bait, they managed to hook a massive pike. The younger brother, Little Bill, struggled to handle the fish while his older brother, Archie, took charge of steering the canoe. After a fierce battle lasting hours, they finally reeled in a four-foot-long pike.

Later, the brothers devised a clever plan to attract ducks and geese for hunting. They crafted decoys from wood and mud to resemble the birds. As they concealed themselves among the bushes, the decoys successfully lured the wild fowl closer for a better shot. Their ingenuity paid off as the birds fell for the trap, mistaking the decoys for real companions."|['1.

Wild birds flying along the river or lake won't avoid obstacles like promontories but will take a shortcut over them.

The Native Americans froze in place at the sound of the first note, staying still regardless of their stance. Even when tired, they didn't move a muscle. The eerie voice of the narrator's mother seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere, causing the Indians to tremble and turn pale beneath their paint. As she sang, the painted heads swiveled, and tears fell. The mother's goal was to stall until help arrived, and she succeeded until a misstep sent her crashing into a pool below.

Fred Jenkins, a skeptic who had spent time in France, joined a Swiss party in the wilderness. His remarks made the group doubt the trustworthiness of La Certe, a half-breed. To regain their trust, La Certe sang a song, impressing them with his musical talent. However, the sight of a knife he had left at a camp where a murder had taken place made him uneasy. Dan, Elspie's brother, noticed Duncan's suspicious glance and couldn't shake the feeling of guilt surrounding him. As the settlers faced a harsh winter, they relied on Okematan and Kateegoose, along with their wives, for survival skills. La Certe, unable to bear the settlers' distress, left them before winter set in, seeking help from old McKay.|"[""1.

The Highlander responded confidently, urging La Certe to speak his mind without hesitation. La Certe, concerned about his family and responsibilities, sought McKay's help with a canoe for his late-season travels. Despite La Certe's offer to hire or pay for it, McKay refused, wary of creating a debt. Eventually, McKay relented and sold the canoe to La Certe on credit. The settlers persevered, planting seeds and tending the land despite past challenges. Some men, like Dan Davidson and Fergus McKay, sought additional opportunities by joining the buffalo-hunters.

"La Certe felt regretful but not discouraged. Changing the subject, he discussed the building projects, the promising harvest, and eventually resorted to the classic topic of weather. Then, in a casual tone, he mentioned, ""I must be going,"" offering to buy McKay's horse and cart for a generous price. McKay, with a chuckle, agreed, teasing La Certe about his honesty. La Certe's aim was to gather supplies for the plains, seeking ammunition, sugar, tea, flour, and pork. Despite his reputation, friends hesitated to help until one relented.

A small group of bushes provided wood for campfires. The wagons were arranged in a circle with the openings facing outward. Guards were stationed, horses were secured, pots were put on the fire, pipes were lit, and the sounds of chatter, laughter, songs, and tales mixed with the high-pitched voices of children echoed late into the night.

Returning to camp, Dan Davidson proposed to Fergus McKay. Fergus, ready for adventure, quickly mounted his horse. Armed and prepared for any danger, they set off. Each carried provisions, a gun, a long knife, and a cavalry pistol. Riding through the prairie, Fergus expressed his love for the wilderness over city life. Dan agreed, mentioning the ongoing conflicts between rival fur companies and angry Indians. The Crees were upset over a treaty, threatening to expel the Saulteaux. As they cautiously approached a campfire, they discovered a war-party of Cree Indians in council. Silent and still, they watched the scene unfold under the moonlight, unsure of what lay ahead.|['1.

In ancient times, the Cree tribe was known for their wisdom. They could distinguish a fox from a buffalo and tell fire apart from water. The orator emphasized the tribe's self-sufficiency, highlighting that they didn't need outsiders to teach them basic needs like eating when hungry or drinking when thirsty. However, a Paleface chief claiming to bring good intentions was met with skepticism. The orator questioned the chief's true motives and warned of potential harm. The council of war convened, discussing plans to confront the Saulteaux tribe and Palefaces aggressively. Amidst the heated discussions, Okematan, a revered chief, rose with a calm demeanor. He acknowledged the Cree's wisdom but subtly hinted at the need for openness to new knowledge.

When the Cree braves gathered on Blue-Pine Ridge, Okematan was chosen to visit Red River and learn about the Palefaces. He joined the Daa-veed-sin family, discovering much about the Palefaces. He found that the great white chief, Lord Selkirk, though not perfect, was well-intentioned towards the Indians. However, some Paleface chiefs delegated tasks to selfish men who misled and lied. When an agreement was made, Saulteaux chiefs were wrongly included due to the ignorance of the great white chief. Okematan realized that sweeping the Palefaces off the earth or Red River was impossible, as they were numerous and lived in large stone dwellings. He acknowledged that among the Palefaces, there were both good and bad individuals, just like among the Cree nation. Okematan had a positive experience with the Scosh-min tribe, admiring their bravery and hardworking nature, despite some weaknesses like a fondness for alcohol.|"[""1.

Our leader addressed the group, sharing wisdom about the importance of peace. He advised against sweeping away the people of Red River, as it would bring trouble. Instead, he suggested sending a message to the great white chief for help. The chief recommended focusing on personal activities like hunting and fishing while waiting patiently. After his speech, there was a mix of approval and disapproval among the listeners. Another elder spoke next, emphasizing the futility of revenge. He explained that fighting should only occur when there is a just cause. Revenge, he argued, brings temporary pleasure but lasting bitterness. He stressed the importance of using the brain to think and judge rather than acting solely on emotion. Revenge, he concluded, ultimately harms the wrong people and serves no real purpose.|"['1.

The peace-party among the Cree warriors won over the idea of peace after discussions, and they returned to their tents and hunting activities. Fergus McKay arrived at the camp at daybreak with news of a potential attack by hostile Indians. Unaware of Okematan following his trail, tensions rose among the men, with some eager for action despite the warning. Suggestions were made to split the group for safety, but disagreements arose. Fred Jenkins humorously noted Kateegoose's habit of starting the day with a hearty meal, while Francois La Certe often joined him.

This speech was more like a request than a command, and the baby, Baby La Certe, seemed to be the implied messenger from the other side of the fire. We never knew the baby's name, and we suspect it was a girl. At that time, the baby was able to walk, or at least waddle or toddle. When the mother asked, Baby La Certe toddled around the fire towards its father, holding a pipe. Although the road was short, the baby paused to think. It seemed to have a strong sense of justice, as it put the still-lit pipe in its mouth and began to draw. The father smiled, but Slowfoot intervened, prompting the baby to complete the walk without receiving a fair wage. The baby sucked on the pipe, knowing it had nothing to fear from Francois. Billie spoke English to Francois, who preferred French. Billie mentioned how Archie, despite being young, could handle anything. Francois stayed behind because his horse was tired, and he wasn't convinced the buffalo were nearby. Billie scolded Francois for being lazy, but Francois believed he was born to prefer rest over activity.|"['1.

When the Red River residents woke up the next morning, they were shocked by the disaster caused by the grasshoppers. The insects had destroyed everything in their path, leaving behind a barren landscape. The settlers' crops, gardens, and plants were all gone, shattering their hopes. The grasshoppers had laid eggs in the ground, leading to a plague of young insects the following year. These new pests devoured everything in sight, even the bark of trees. The settlers were forced to move back to Pembina, relying on hunting and fishing for survival. After enduring another harsh winter, the arrival of spring brought a sense of relief and renewal. The change in season was a welcome reminder of life's beauty after months of cold and darkness. The Cree chief planned a spring hunting expedition, inviting two settlers to join him.

We won't delve into the feast details that followed. The goose was plump and tender, with enough wild ducks for everyone. They drank tea heartily, and after, the Red-man smoked his pipe with purpose.

In pursuit of his goal, the tired man lay down and fell into a deep sleep under the sun. Upon waking, Dan realized he was weak, his leg injured, and blood still trickling.

In the afternoon, the group reached the place of the earlier struggle but found no Saulteaux warriors. It seemed they had fled upon learning about the expedition against them. Fergus suggested following Daniel Davidson's tracks to ensure his safety. Despite doubts, they decided to track Dan, as he had left without provisions. Dechamp led the way, followed by Fergus and Bourassin. Archie and Okematan formed the rearguard. They soon found Dan's camp at the wood's edge. Dechamp spotted a wolf nearby.

Archie raised a concern about who should inform Mrs. Davidson about Dan's accident. The group decided to carry Dan to the house on a makeshift litter.

Despite the dire situation, the Davidsons managed to provide for Dan's needs, thanks to their limited resources. Jessie, Peter, Louise, and others rallied around Dan, offering care and support.

The Sioux chief informed the Governor that they had heard about the Palefaces building many wooden Wigwams resembling the stones on Lake Winnipeg's shores.

From Dan's window, Little Bill watched suspicious movements outside. Without a word, he signaled Okematan with a whistle. The Cree chief swiftly joined him, unnoticed by the party. The Sioux, sensing trouble, kept watch. Kateegoose tried to attack Okematan, but the chief deflected the blow. Kateegoose fled, pursued by the Sioux. The settlers were angered by the attack. The Governor tried to make amends but Kateegoose shot the Sioux chief at a feast. The Sioux, unable to find Kateegoose, left in anger. They later attacked La Certe's tent, taking his belongings and burning his home. La Certe returned to find his house destroyed. Despite his loss, he remained unfazed.|"['1.

They flipped the canoe over to create a makeshift shelter, ignited a large fire in front of it, and prepared a simple yet satisfying meal by roasting three plump ducks. After dining and hydrating with water, they put the baby to sleep, lit their pipes, and sat by the warm fire, sharing their dreams and worries in a cloud of smoke. Meanwhile, back in the colony, a complex situation had arisen. While distress and hunger plagued many, the weather was ideal for a bountiful harvest. Due to a partially successful buffalo hunt, some had to resort to fishing in lakes Winnipeg and Manitoba. These freshwater lakes teemed with whitefish, a delicacy known as Titameg, but success relied heavily on weather conditions. Amidst this, idle individuals sought to survive by fishing, relying on the generosity of others for support. The summer's end saw them equipped with supplies, heading to the fishing grounds with optimism, despite uncertain futures. Among them was La Certe, who, through his misfortunes, had garnered sympathy and support from various sources, enabling him to embark on his fishing venture well-provisioned. The fruitful summer hinted at a prosperous harvest for the hardworking settlers, including Dan Davidson, who, rejuvenated by rest, good food, and the love of his partner Elspie, anticipated reaping the rewards of their labor and perseverance.|['1.

Little Bill felt the warm influences around him and grew visibly fatter and stronger, his large blue eyes losing some of their serious look. One afternoon, Billie and Archie walked to the summer house in the Prairie Cottage garden. Billie, unlike other boys, enjoyed solitary moments. Soon after Archie left, Fred Jenkins arrived. Jenkins, with a bashful expression, sat beside Billie. He sought advice from the young boy about a matter of the heart. Jenkins, a seaman, felt conflicted about expressing his feelings for a girl named Elise. Billie, surprised by Jenkins' vulnerability, promised to help. However, before Jenkins could finish, Elise's lap-dog signaled her arrival, prompting Jenkins to flee. Elise appeared, finding the summer house empty.|"['Question 1: How did Little Bill physically change in the text passage?\nA) He grew taller and thinner\nB) His eyes turned green\nC) He became visibly fatter and stronger\nD) He became more serious-looking\nE) He lost his blue eyes', 'Question 2: Who walked to the summer house in the Prairie Cottage garden?\nA) Little Bill and Fred Jenkins\nB) Billie and Archie\nC) Elise and Jenkins\nD) Archie and Jenkins\nE) Little Bill and Elise', 'Question 3: Why did Fred Jenkins seek advice from Billie?\nA) To learn how to sail\nB) To ask about gardening tips\nC) To express his feelings for Elise\nD) To play a game of chess\nE) To discuss his seafaring adventures', 'Question 4: What profession did Fred Jenkins have in the text passage?\nA) Gardener\nB) Seaman\nC) Farmer\nD) Carpenter\nE) Doctor', ""Question 5: What interrupted Fred Jenkins before he could finish expressing his feelings to Billie?\nA) A loud noise outside\nB) Elise's arrival signaled by her lap-dog\nC) A sudden storm\nD) Archie's return\nE) Billie's departure"", 'Question 6: How did Elise find the summer house when she arrived?\nA) Full of people\nB) Empty\nC) Decorated with flowers\nD) Filled with music\nE) Dark and spooky']"|"['C) He became visibly fatter and stronger', 'B) Billie and Archie', 'C) To express his feelings for Elise', 'B) Seaman', ""B) Elise's arrival signaled by her lap-dog"", 'B) Empty']"
Little Bill was eager to share Jenkins' feelings with Elise. Jenkins was too nervous to ask Elise to marry him and expressed his love for her in a unique way. Elise was surprised by his words and wanted to keep it a secret. Jenkins' honorable nature was evident when he respected Elise's wish for secrecy. Little Bill noticed a change in Elise's behavior towards Jenkins. Okematan, a Cree chief, decided to visit Lake Winnipeg to observe settlers. Dan allowed Okematan to join the fishing trip. The two canoes set off early the next day, with Okematan and Archie in one canoe and Dan, Fergus, and Jenkins in the other. They paddled down the Red River towards Lake Winnipeg.|"[""1.

The half-breed welcomed the visitors to the furniture-less mansion, indicating spots on the floor to sit. The family gathered around the fire in the room, seated on animal skins. Smoke from the fire and pipes escaped through the roof's crevices. The chief predicted an event due to the dark sky in the northwest. As the storm intensified, rain seeped through the roof, requiring makeshift solutions. Everyone settled in for the night, unfazed by the storm. Madame Dobelle prepared sleeping arrangements in the hut. Despite the suffocating smoke, they all smoked through the night. The next morning, the fishermen discovered the storm's damage to their nets. La Certe calmly repaired his net, seemingly unaffected by the loss. Elspie urgently summoned Dan Davidson to address false accusations against her brother Duncan. Annette Pierre's claim about Duncan's involvement in a murder needed immediate clarification.|"['1.

Elspie and Dan were caught in a whirlwind of rumors and suspicion after the arrest of Duncan McKay junior on a murder charge. The Company had enrolled a police force to bring order to the growing settlement, and Duncan was the unfortunate target of their investigation. Despite his lineage and denial of guilt, the trial proceeded with a jury and witnesses like Annette Pierre and Marie Blanc. In the end, Duncan was acquitted due to lack of evidence, but some vowed to seek retribution.

"If the old man had been wise enough to abandon his advice, Duncan junior might have stayed put. But the counsel stirred opposition in him.

The camp buzzed with excitement as they prepared to chase the buffalo. Little Bill, too young to join, watched from afar. During the chase, chaos ensued.

The sailor was mistaken. The hunter lay still for a moment, allowing the bull to veer off, then quickly got back up, retrieved his horse, and resumed the pursuit. Further ahead, they witnessed Peter Davidson's horse stumble, causing Peter to deftly avoid a fall. Both man and horse recovered swiftly and continued the chase. Little Bill encountered a fallen hunter, Duncan McKay, wounded and bleeding. Acting decisively, Billie tended to Duncan's wound with makeshift bandages and water. Realizing the urgency of the situation, Billie secured the bandage, fetched water, and rode back to camp for help.

Sudden! It felt like a sudden storm at sea, a whirlwind of emotions. I had been circling around her, trying to gather my courage, recalling all the brave sayings of sailors. But my fear held me back. In despair, I retreated to the garden, only to spot my crush, Elise! I changed course, closing in, but fear crept in. I scolded myself, but a voice inside stirred me. I mustered my courage, hoisted the sails, and approached her. We exchanged words, and suddenly, we found ourselves sitting together. It was a surreal moment. Dan congratulated me, suggesting a double wedding. I hesitated, wanting fair play. Perhaps a decision with Elise and Elspie as judges could settle it.|['1.

La Certe was excited about the upcoming shooting trip, finding it more of an amusement than labor. Eager to leave his home, which no longer brought him happiness, he bid farewell to Elspie.

La Certe had no plans to go to Canada; his captors wanted to delay him so he couldn't warn Dan's friends. One day, they stopped at a portage to carry the canoe and cargo over the rapids. Even though tied up, the prisoners had to help. Dan carried loads first, then La Certe and others. Dan, longing for escape, saw the river's power and his bound hands. He found a rusty scalping knife, cut his bonds, freed La Certe, and they fled. But the Nor'-westers leader and men blocked their escape. With no way out, Dan faced a choice: surrender or risk the river's dangerous rapids.|"[""1.

Before the mix-breed could understand the words, Dan had jumped over the cliff and vanished into the rushing water. Shortly after, he surfaced in the whirlpool below, fighting against the current before disappearing once more. La Certe was grabbed from behind before he could see if Dan emerged again, and he was pulled from the edge of the cliff. The Nor'-westers' leader swiftly descended the rocky path to the rapids, determined to rescue Dan despite the risks involved. Dan was seen plummeting down the falls and resurfacing in the basin, where the leader swam out to save him. Dan regained consciousness and promised not to escape until after breakfast the next day. The captors treated them more kindly the following morning, but the chief still bound Dan as ordered. The sound of voyageurs singing drew near, signaling the arrival of the Hudson's Bay Company men. The Nor'-westers were subdued as the HBC men approached, cheering joyfully. The prisoners were led into the woods by guards, where Dan resisted the urge to fight back, knowing it was futile.|"['1.

At the same time, a group of Native American warriors gathered in a hidden grove on the prairie for a serious discussion about peace, not war. After sharing their thoughts, all attention turned to the great chief, Okematan, seated next to a white man named Peter Davidson. Okematan had spent time among the settlers to understand their desires in Native lands. He found contradictions in their words but also saw wisdom in some. The settlers claimed their land was small, yet vast lands lay empty. They explained that a few powerful chiefs controlled the best lands, leaving many settlers with little space. Okematan was puzzled by their actions and the inequality he witnessed. The settlers' stories left him questioning their intentions and the fairness of their ways.|"[""1.
