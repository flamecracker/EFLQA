The house overlooked the river, situated on the western bank next to Point Coupee. In front, there was a lawn about two hundred yards long that extended towards the river and ended at the low bluff by the bank. The lawn was enclosed by tall rail-fences and adorned with clusters of shrubs and decorative trees, some native to the area while others were exotic. Notable trees included the large-flowered magnolia, red mulberry, catalpa, tulip-tree, and orange trees. The landscape also featured dark cedars and yew trees, date-palms, weeping willows, Mexican agave, yucca plants, and palmettos. The area was teeming with various beautiful birds. Inside the house, the great hall displayed hunting implements, trophies of stag and elk horns, and preserved skins of rare birds and animals.

"Hugot, the loyal companion of the Colonel, shared in all his hunting adventures. Even the boys joined in once they could ride. The house would be closed during these trips as there were no other staff. Days or even weeks would pass while they explored the forests, returning with treasures of animal skins, plants, and geological finds. Landi and his family spent hours organizing these discoveries. Hugot managed all household tasks, from cooking to running errands, as there were no other servants. Despite the simple lifestyle, the family received scientific books and instruments, sparking curiosity in the village. The Colonel, though known as the ""old Colonel,"" was well-respected, and his boys, skilled in hunting and outdoor activities, were adored by the villagers. Visitors were rare, except for old military friends who came yearly to reminisce and savor the Colonel's venison, often discussing their shared admiration for Napoleon and their deep friendship with Charles Lucien, prince of Musignano."|"[""1.

Not all Bonapartes have been bad. Some members of the family have shown noble virtues. The Prince of Musignano's quiet natural history studies are seen as triumphs in nature, deserving gratitude and respect. Despite overshadowing by the Emperor's violent conquests, his pursuits highlight his heroism. Colonel Landi's life changed after a leg injury led to amputation, forcing him to abandon hunting but continue his naturalist interests. His appearance is described as white-haired, cleanly shaved, with a bronzed face. The eldest son, Basil, aged seventeen, resembles an Italian, embodying strength and courage. He is a keen hunter, aspiring to pursue more dangerous game like panthers and bears. His hunting skills surpass bird-catching and squirrel shooting, showing a passion for thrilling pursuits.|"[""1.

"Lucien, the second eldest, stands out from his siblings in appearance and interests. Unlike his brothers, he is delicately built with fair hair, resembling his fair-haired Basque mother. Lucien's passion lies in books, especially natural history, botany, and geology. Despite joining hunting trips with Basil, he would pause for rare plants or rocks. Though quiet, Lucien's intellect and education command respect when he speaks. On the other hand, Francois, the youngest, is a lively Frenchman, skilled in bird-catching and mischief-making. As the family admires the passing ""Buck-eye"" mail-steamer, the Colonel emphasizes the importance of acquiring a specific skin at any cost.

Hugot had few preparations to make before leaving. He quickly arranged everything and received instructions and money from his master. Off to Point Coupee he went to meet the steamer. It took three long weeks before Hugot returned. The old Colonel worried during this time, fearing Hugot might not succeed. Hugot had promised the Prince a white buffalo-skin, but he returned empty-handed. The Colonel was disappointed, but Lucien suggested that they search for the white buffaloes themselves. The boys proposed an expedition, and after discussing it over supper, the Colonel agreed. The naturalist was pleased with his children's boldness and self-reliance. He had trained them well in various skills, making them capable of surviving in the wilderness.|"['1.

The Colonel had faith in his sons' abilities on the prairies, feeling proud rather than worried about their upcoming expedition. He was also driven by the pride of a naturalist, envisioning the recognition that sending a rare find to a European museum would bring. The boys initially rejected the idea of taking Hugot, their father's suggestion, as they wanted full credit for their venture. Hugot, skilled in cooking but not hunting, was not favored by the boys for fear of losing their glory. Despite the dangers of encountering hostile Indian tribes, the Colonel allowed his sons to go, knowing the risks but trusting in their skills. The prairies where buffaloes roamed were also where danger lurked, but the Colonel believed in his sons' capabilities in facing the challenges ahead.|"[""1.

The father of the three young hunters knew all about the dangerous expedition they were embarking on. Despite the risks, he allowed them to go due to a mysterious reason that will be revealed later. Before they set off, he gave Basil a small bag with instructions to keep it close, emphasizing its importance for their safety. After heartfelt goodbyes, the boys rode off into the western wilderness, leaving behind the few settlements along the Mississippi River. Riding through forests rarely traveled except by Indians or hunters, they eventually camped in a peaceful glade surrounded by diverse trees and plants.

"The young hunters had stopped before sunset to set up their night-camp. A small white tent stood near the edge of the glade with three Mexican-style saddles nearby. Beside the saddles was a pack-saddle called an ""alpareja."" Blankets, bear-skin, and buffalo-robes were spread on the grass, along with whips, bridles, water-gourds, and spurs hanging from a branch. Three guns leaned against a tree - two rifles and a double-barreled shotgun. A fire crackled on one side, with a camp-kettle hanging over it.

Lucien watched as the hawk swooped down towards the squirrel with lightning speed. The squirrel, agile and quick, dodged the hawk's attempts by darting around the tree trunk, evading the predator's sharp talons. The hawk, determined and relentless, continued its pursuit, circling above the tree in search of its prey. Soon, a larger hawk, likely its mate, joined the hunt, intensifying the squirrel's fear. As the smaller hawk made another failed attempt, the larger one descended swiftly, capturing the squirrel mid-air. However, their victory was short-lived as a gunshot rang out, bringing down both the hawk and the squirrel.

In the woods of Louisiana, Lucien and his companions had an unexpected encounter with a squirrel and a hawk. Despite being shot and falling, the squirrel managed to escape the hawk's clutches and climb a tall tree, leaving the hunters in awe. The hunters then set up camp by the Bayou Crocodile, a river infested with alligators. The lush landscape, with its giant trees, Spanish moss, magnolias, and vibrant flowers, created a beautiful yet eerie setting. The lake was teeming with alligators, some basking in the sun while others lurked in the dark waters.

Around the lake, a variety of fascinating creatures could be observed. Flamingoes stood in formation akin to soldiers on a distant point, their vibrant scarlet feathers gleaming under the sunlight. Nearby, whooping-cranes, as tall as grown men, emitted loud trumpet calls. The majestic great egret with its snowy plumage mingled with Louisiana herons and sand-hill cranes in the distance. Pelicans, ibises, and gallinules added to the picturesque scene. Roseate spoonbills hunted for food in the shallows, while buzzard vultures and ospreys soared above.

Basil and Lucien hurried forward with their rifles when they spotted Francois running frantically. They soon realized he was fleeing from a massive alligator blocking the path. As they warned Francois, he stumbled over the alligator but managed to get back up and continue running, shouting about a bear chasing him. The brothers prepared to confront the bear and stood their ground. The bear, in pursuit of Francois, stumbled upon the alligator, which retaliated by striking the bear with its tail. Enraged, the bear attacked the alligator, leading to a fierce struggle. Basil and Lucien intervened by shooting the bear, causing it to release the alligator. In the chaos, the alligator dragged the bear into the water, where both disappeared beneath the surface, presumed drowned. The boys watched in awe as the dramatic encounter unfolded before them.|['1.

The boys were back in their tent, intrigued by the scene they had seen. They lay on the grass, discussing bears and alligators, focusing more on the latter due to their peculiar habits. Basil, an experienced hunter, shared stories about alligators, while Lucien, who had studied them in books, provided detailed information. Lucien explained how alligators belong to the lizard order _Sauria_, which is further divided into families and genera. The boys questioned the need for such intricate classifications, feeling it made things unnecessarily complex. They discussed how true naturalists like Wilson and Bartram, who dedicated their lives to studying nature, often had their work taken credit for by others. The conversation delved into the injustice faced by these dedicated researchers, sparking a discussion on the importance of acknowledging true naturalists for their contributions.|"['1.

We owe much of our knowledge of natural history to explorers like Hearne, Bartram, and Wilson. They have revealed the wonders of the natural world, unlike the dry scientific classifications that can obscure rather than simplify our understanding. For instance, take the Spanish moss hanging from live oaks. It's not a moss but a unique flowering plant. According to traditional naturalists, it belongs to the same plant family as the pineapple, which seems absurd. In reality, they are vastly different in appearance, properties, and uses. Understanding a plant's structure, purpose, and benefits to nature and humans is far more valuable than mere classification. Crocodiles, divided into crocodiles, gavials, and alligators by Baron Cuvier, are distinguished by their head shape and teeth. Crocodiles have pointed snouts with a large tooth on each side, gavials have even teeth, and alligators have broad snouts with unequal teeth. These distinctions may seem unnecessary given the limited variations among crocodiles globally. Africa houses four true crocodile species, while the fifth is found in the West Indies and South America. Gavials reside in Asia, mainly in the Ganges, and alligators are widespread in the Americas. New crocodile species may still be discovered in Africa and the Indian Ocean islands.|"['1.

Crocodiles and alligators share similar habits, differing only due to climate or food. Alligators are dusky-brown above and yellowish-white underneath, covered in scales that rise into pyramids on their back. Their tail has saw-like scales and is vertically flattened. They have short, muscular legs with webbed toes. Their head is pike-like with nostrils near the snout's end, prominent eyes, and oval-shaped pupils. When opening their jaws, their neck bends upwards, giving the illusion of moving the upper jaw. Their ear openings are guarded by lips, and they can close nostril valves. Their vertebrae limit head movement, making them slow to turn. Alligators lay eggs in sandbanks or mud platforms, protecting them from predators until hatched. The mother guards the hatching eggs and guides her young to water after they hatch.|"['1.

The mother alligator's first task is to guide her young to the water, where they are safer from predators like older alligators, tortoises, and birds. Despite her efforts, some young alligators still become prey. Once the young ones become more agile, they outmaneuver their larger relatives. Alligators, while fish being their preferred meal, will eat almost any land animal they can catch, even preferring it decomposed. They have been observed to kill large animals in the water, leaving them to decompose for days. Alligators have a slow digestion process, allowing them to survive long periods without food. They are known to employ clever tactics to catch fish, using their webbed feet and flat tail to swiftly move through water, surprising their prey with a lethal strike. Their unique hunting techniques involve using their tails to strike and kill prey swiftly. The mystery of why alligators consume stones and debris remains unsolved, with their stomachs sometimes containing objects like stones and sticks.|"[""1.

Many believe that alligators swallow gravel and earth to aid digestion, similar to how birds consume such substances. Some even suggest it helps distend the stomach, allowing the reptile to endure long fasts during hibernation. However, I find this reasoning absurd. I think the debris found in alligator stomachs is accidental, ingested along with prey or by mistake due to their indiscriminate eating habits. Unlike humans, alligators can survive even with severe brain injuries. African crocodiles are often perceived as more aggressive than American alligators, possibly due to historical interactions with humans. American alligators have become wary of humans over time, particularly in settled areas. The fear of humans is attributed to the historical hunting for alligator leather and oil. Despite myths, South American caimans, a type of alligator, can also exhibit aggressive behavior towards humans.|"[""1.

In America, particularly along the Magdalena River, alligators grow large and fierce due to the hot climate ideal for their development. The half-Indian, half-Spanish locals rarely confront these creatures, making the alligators less fearful of humans. Tragedies occur when people fall prey to the alligators, especially boatmen navigating the river. These boatmen, known as _bogadores_, sometimes carry rifles to shoot the alligators, aiming for the eye, the only vulnerable spot. Locals occasionally lasso and kill the alligators after an attack. Despite sporadic attempts to control the population, the alligators continue to thrive and pose a constant threat to the inhabitants. An incident involving a vaquero's daughter illustrates the dangers posed by these formidable reptiles.|['1.

After many days of travel, they arrived at the banks of the Sabine River, which separated Louisiana from Texas, a part of Mexico back then. The landscape was vastly different from what they had seen before. The terrain was more hilly and elevated, and the vegetation had changed significantly. The dense cypress trees were replaced by abundant pines, creating lighter and more open forests. Despite a river flood, they swam across and set up camp on the western bank. The area resembled a deserted orchard with scattered trees, including tall magnolias. The ground was adorned with various flowers like blue lupins and golden helianthi, adding color to the landscape.

"""No one can say for certain what happened to the Natchez tribe. Some old Spanish authors claim they were wiped out by South American Indians, but this theory seems far-fetched. It is more plausible that the Natchez were defeated by the Creeks and Chicasaws from the southwest, with the survivors assimilating into the conquering tribes. This likely led to the extinction of the Natchez. It is possible that this location was once an ancient Natchez settlement, with the remaining trees possibly remnants of their cultivated orchards. The Indians valued these trees for their fruits and other uses, unlike us who have access to a wide variety of fruits through trade. The mulberry tree, for example, is significant as it is the source of silk.

The white mulberry tree has numerous uses. Its wood is dense and heavy, weighing forty-four pounds per cubic foot. In France, it's commonly used for turnery, and white wines acquire a delightful flavor of violets when aged in its casks. The tree's branches are crafted into vine-props and fences, while its bark can be transformed into a cloth almost as fine as silk. The fruit of the white mulberry is delicious and often made into syrup. Originally from China, the white mulberry was cultivated for silkworms over 2700 years ago. The black mulberry, known for its dark purple fruit, originates from Persia and is used for ornamentation and shade. These mulberry trees have diverse uses, from feeding silkworms to providing food for animals and even manufacturing paper and cloth.|"[""1.

The bird met its demise as the tarantula made it its prey, with the lizard soon joining the unfolding drama. The lizard, with its remarkable emerald green and scarlet colors, stealthily approached the tarantula's nest. As the lizard prepared to strike, its colors changed to blend with the liana bark, a skill it uses to surprise its prey.

For a while, the chameleon waited in silence, ready to pounce on the unsuspecting spider. The tarantula, unaware of the danger, was excited about its upcoming feast. However, the chameleon swiftly leaped out, capturing the spider in its jaws. In the scuffle, the bird managed to escape. The chameleon defeated the tarantula, leaving it helpless. With vibrant colors flashing, the chameleon dragged its prey towards a pile of logs. Just as it seemed safe, a scorpion-lizard emerged from a tree hole, eyeing the chameleon and its meal. The scorpion-lizard, with its menacing appearance, swiftly descended to claim the spoils. Despite the chameleon's initial retreat, it bravely stood its ground, ready to defend its hard-earned prize.

Two small reptiles, a chameleon and a skink, engaged in a fierce battle under the watchful eyes of the boys. The chameleon's green color and the skink's swift movements made for an intense showdown. The skink, aware of the chameleon's weakness in its tail, tried to outmaneuver its opponent. After a fierce struggle, the skink managed to bite off the chameleon's tail, leaving it injured but alive. However, a new danger emerged as a red serpent descended from a mulberry tree, targeting the skink. Despite the skink's attempt to flee, the serpent swiftly caught up and killed it.

The snake killed the lizard and began eating it without chewing. Snakes have teeth for seizing and killing, not for chewing. The blood-snake is not venomous and lacks fangs. Instead, it has sharp teeth and can constrict prey. A Southern kite bird spotted the snake. The kite's graceful flight and forked tail made it easy to recognize. The kite circled effortlessly in the air, displaying its white head and breast. The boys watched in awe as the kite glided through the sky. The kite's tail helped it navigate without giving away its presence. The boys admired the bird's beauty and skill. Lucien explained that kites can't dive like other hawks due to their forked tails, which help them soar gracefully. Lucien admired the balance of nature in the adaptation of different bird species.|"['1.

"Now the kites are always in the air, or nearly so. They, in fact, **live** upon the wing, **consuming** their food as they fly, from their claws. Living thus, they have many more chances of **spotting** their prey than their cousins of the hawk species; and were they possessed of the power to **dive** upon it with as much certainty as the latter do, it is evident they would have greatly the advantage. The lack of that capability, however, brings them to an equality; and, as I have said, Lucien perceived in this that peculiar equilibrium, or ""balance of power,"" which constantly presents itself to the student of Nature. These thoughts passed through his mind at the moment. They occupied but a moment, however--for it was but a few seconds from the time the kite was first noticed wheeling high in the air, until he swept along the tops of the low trees, so close that the boys could distinguish the red iris of his glistening eyes. Now, for the first time, the snake caught sight of him. Hitherto it had been too much occupied with its own prey, which it had succeeded in swallowing.

The situation was tense as the kite and the snake faced off in a battle of hunger. The young hunters observed the intense contest unfold before them. The kite and the snake were locked in a deadly struggle, each trying to outlast the other without food. The kite, known for its ability to survive without eating for days, seemed to be at a disadvantage against the snake, which had recently feasted on a scorpion-lizard. As the fight continued, the kite managed to gain the upper hand by seizing the snake's throat with its powerful talons.

When the eagle spotted the kite, he was determined to seize the prey it had stolen. The kite, aware of the danger, swiftly ascended into the sky, unwilling to surrender its hard-earned prize without a challenge. Confident in his flying abilities, the kite decided to test the pursuing eagle's speed. As they soared higher and higher, their circles intertwined, creating a mesmerizing aerial dance. Despite the kite's initial assumption that the eagle might be slow, the observers marveled at the majestic and swift predator. The female eagle, larger and fiercer than her male counterparts, showcased her strength and agility in the chase.

Listen closely! Did you hear that sound, like a rocket's whistle? Look! Something has crashed onto the tree, breaking branches! It's the kite! Sadly, it's dead with blood spurting from a shoulder wound! An eagle swooped down from high up, too fast to follow, then gracefully landed on a dead magnolia. Basil grabbed his rifle to take a shot. He rode Black Hawk to approach the eagle. Suddenly, a crack rang out, and the eagle tumbled down. Basil returned with the large bird, a female, weighing over twelve pounds with a seven-foot wingspan. The bald eagle, symbolizing the United States, is a fierce predator, robbing weaker birds of their prey. However, the American conquests aim not to enslave but to spread freedom and justice globally, driven by a desire to share the cup of liberty with all humanity.|['1.

Not all Americans or Englishmen have noble motives for conquest; many are driven by selfish desires. The author warns against associating true liberty with those seeking personal gain. Political science is deemed crucial as it influences daily life, from transportation to personal character. The author promises to delve deeper into these topics in the future. Returning to the symbol of the eagle, the author questions its suitability as a representation of American liberty. Franklin suggests other animals like the buffalo, elk, beaver, or the wild turkey could better embody American principles. The eagle, while adopted by many nations, signifies conflicting motives. The author muses on the potential symbolism of the lion and the role of Public Opinion in restraining it.|['1.

"As Francois spoke, he gestured towards the small hummingbird and the large eagle lying side by side on the grass, showing a striking difference in size and appearance.

"Buffalo hunting was a skill practiced by the Indians, where they used a method called the ""surround."" When a group of Indian hunters spotted a herd of buffaloes, they would encircle them on horseback and drive them into a central clump. With loud yells, the hunters would then attack the buffaloes with bows and lances, aiming to kill as many as possible. This method was used to obtain meat and skins for various purposes. In some cases, hundreds or even thousands of buffaloes were slaughtered in one hunt. The region where buffaloes roamed was characterized by high upland prairies and deep rifts called ""canons."" Sometimes, the Indians would guide the buffaloes towards these canons and force them to leap over the precipices. Other hunting methods included pursuing buffaloes in the snow or capturing them with lassos. The young hunters in the story decided to run down the buffaloes as their best plan of action. They left behind their belongings and rode out onto the prairie with their guns and pistols, ready to take down the animals."|"['1.

"The brothers rode silently ahead, carefully observing the creatures in front of them. These were not buffaloes; their rough, shaggy bodies did not match the shining appearance of the buffaloes. Lucien explained that such mistakes were common due to an atmospheric illusion, recounting a story of a raven mistaken for a buffalo. As they turned their attention to capturing birds instead, they noticed two old ""gobblers"" and a hen. The gobblers were strutting and displaying their vibrant plumage, while the hen moved gracefully, aware of the attention she drew. The males, resembling peacocks, caught the hunters' eyes with their metallic shine. The turkeys took flight when approached, and the brothers each pursued their chosen target.

Lucien mounted his horse and rode out into the open ground, where he spotted Basil chasing a gobbler across the prairies at full speed. The gobbler ran ahead with outspread wings, resembling an ostrich. Both Basil and the bird disappeared behind a timber islet. Lucien searched for Francois but couldn't find him as he had gone in a different direction. Deciding not to follow them, Lucien returned to where Jeanette was waiting at the forest's edge. Meanwhile, Basil's pursuit of the gobbler proved to be challenging. The bird flew a mile and then ran like a cat before Basil caught up. The chase continued with the gobbler flying short distances and running uphill faster than Basil's horse. Eventually, the exhausted bird tried to hide but was shot by Basil. After securing the gobbler, Basil realized he was lost in the prairies, surrounded by similar groves of timber, unsure of which way to go.

He was a brave lad, calm and collected. Despite the vast prairie surrounding him, he stayed alert, reins in hand, searching for any sign of his lost brothers. Shouting and firing his rifle yielded no response. Remembering his hunter skills, he decided to retrace his steps. With keen eyes, he followed the faint hoof-marks until he reached the spot where he had shot a turkey. Carefully analyzing his approach, he backtracked, noticing the subtle signs he left behind. After a while, the circles he traveled grew wider until he found a clear path. Recognizing his horse's tracks among others, he continued until a voice called his name. Reuniting with Lucien brought relief, but the absence of Francois brought a new worry.|"['1.

Basil expressed his deep concern for his lost friend, Francois, on the vast prairie. Lucien, now understanding the severity of the situation, shared Basil's distress. Basil explained how he found his way back by following his trail, realizing the challenge Francois would face. Together, they fired their rifles as a signal, but no response came. They then lit a large smoke signal to aid Francois in finding them. Despite feeling guilty for the situation, Basil insisted they search for Francois. The brothers loaded their rifles once more, ready to embark on the search for their lost companion.|"['1.

Basil and Lucien, two young hunters, followed their hound, Marengo, on a thrilling turkey chase. Marengo picked up Francois' trail by sniffing his discarded blanket. The hound led the brothers through forests and plains, following the scent with determination. As Marengo suddenly stopped and pawed at some feathers, Basil and Lucien held their breath, knowing this was a critical moment. If Marengo could find Francois' departing trail, they could track him down. The brothers anxiously watched Marengo's every move, hoping for a successful outcome. Their adventure was filled with suspense and excitement as they relied on their hound to lead them back to their lost brother.|"[""1.

The dog had lost the trail, causing distress among the brothers. Basil carefully searched the ground, following a wide circle to avoid confusing tracks. After examining various horse-trails, he finally spotted fresher prints from Francois' mustang, marked by a chip on the hoof. The dog, Marengo, excitedly continued on the scent. The trail meandered, zig-zagging and even crossing itself, testing the dog's tracking skills. As they galloped after Marengo, the hunters worried about the approaching dark night on the high plateaux. They feared losing sight of the dog and Francois. The urgency of the chase heightened as the trail turned westward, leading them into uncertainty.|"['1.

As they rode side by side into the twilight, Basil and Lucien faced a dilemma. The fading light made it hard to keep track of their hound, Marengo. Quick thinking by Basil saved the day. He fashioned a makeshift garment out of Lucien's shirt to make Marengo visible in the dark. With Marengo now easily seen in the dim light, they galloped on. Their journey led them to a surprise - a fire in the distance. Approaching cautiously, they discovered Francois, who had been lost but managed to find his way back to camp. Reunited with their brother, they shared a joyous meal of roasted turkey before settling down for the night under the stars.|"[""1.

Early the next morning, the group quickly prepared the leftover turkey for breakfast before setting off on their journey back. Without relying on the dog's tracking skills due to the cold scent, they followed their own trail and markings. Despite frequent stops, they made steady progress, eager to return to Jeanette. Along the way, they shared jokes and banter, lightening the mood after their recent perilous adventure. Lucien's torn shirt became a source of amusement for Francois. As they approached Jeanette, they were surprised by a peculiar sight: Jeanette surrounded by hog-like creatures with pointed snouts and tusks. The group sprang into action, riding towards Jeanette to confront the animals and protect her. Despite firing shots, the creatures remained aggressive, posing a dangerous threat to both Jeanette and the group.|"['1.

The young hunters quickly realized it was futile to stand their ground and decided to retreat. Basil spurred his horse towards the tree, cutting the lasso that bound Jeanette with his hunting-knife. He then called out to his brothers to follow him as they galloped across the prairie. Jeanette, now freed, took off at full speed, her relief evident. However, a herd of javalies, wild hogs, pursued them, grunting and screaming as they ran. The horses and Marengo outpaced the javalies, but Jeanette, weakened from lack of food and water, with torn legs and impeded by a trailing tent, was in danger. Luckily, the javalies mistook the tent for an enemy and attacked it, giving Jeanette the opportunity to escape. After putting several miles between them and the javalies, the group stopped to rest, realizing they had lost their tent and camp utensils in the chase. They pondered what had provoked the javalies' attack, speculating that Jeanette's kicking at the turkeys left by Lucien and Basil might have triggered the assault. Javalies, usually harmless, can turn aggressive when provoked, defending their territory or wounded companions. The hunters set up camp in a grove with a spring nearby, their dinner plans disrupted by Jeanette's flight scattering their dried meat provisions. Basil and Francois went hunting for squirrels to replenish their food supply, but the sun was|"[""1.

The young hunters decided to explore the edge of the thick shady grove in search of game. As they cautiously approached the prairie, hoping to spot deer or partridges, they used tree trunks for cover. The prairie was open, with only a few small trees scattered around. Despite scanning the area, they initially saw no animals. Suddenly, they noticed two small creatures about two hundred yards away. These creatures resembled tiny hares and were known as the 'little chief hare' among the local Indigenous people. The young hunters were intrigued and wished to obtain the skin of one as a prized possession. As they observed the creatures, a strange animal appeared on the prairie. Resembling a mix between a leopard and a tiger, it was identified as a bay lynx, also known as a wild cat. The lynx was stealthily stalking the little hares, trying to seize them without being noticed.|['1.

Between the lynx and the hares stood a lone pecan tree with outstretched branches. Under it, a small thicket of briars and weeds grew, likely nourished by decaying matter. While the lynx approached from one side, the hares grazed on the other. The hares, with their long ears and agile movements, drew near to the boys. Their rusty fur, devoid of white markings, contrasted with their graceful antics. As the hares nibbled grass and leaped playfully, an unusual sight caught their attention. A round, greyish object resembling a tuft of wool lay near the briars. The hares, unafraid, inched closer out of curiosity. Suddenly, the object revealed itself as an old she 'possum, swiftly capturing and killing one of the hares. The lynx, observing the scene, decided to seize the opportunity to claim the hare for its own meal.|"['1.

The opossum had successfully climbed a tree to escape the lynx. The lynx, frustrated but determined, tried to reach the opossum by climbing the tree as well. However, the opossum cleverly moved down to lower branches each time the lynx got closer. The lynx attempted to grab the opossum's tail but failed. Eventually, the lynx realized that the branch wouldn't hold his weight and that the opossum was out of his reach. Despite his efforts, the lynx had to accept defeat and sat in a fork of the tree, unable to capture the opossum.

The lynx, eager to catch the 'possum, tried to leap up and grab her, but she was too high. The 'possum, hanging calmly, seemed to mock the lynx. The lynx, determined to outlast her, sat watching. The 'possum, unfazed, held onto the hare and even started eating it. This angered the lynx, who climbed up the tree again and lunged at the 'possum.

The young hunters had chased a hare dropped by a lynx. Returning to collect a 'possum for supper, they found it missing. The 'possum had cleverly played dead and escaped. Left with a lynx carcass and a torn hare, they slept supperless. Awakening to a cold touch, Francois feared a snake but saw two black, wolf-like creatures. Peering into the shadows, they spotted a man standing calmly as the creatures approached. To their surprise, the animals seemed friendly, leaping at the man playfully.

During this time, Marengo, the loyal dog, stood obediently by, held back by the others. He had been sleeping deeply until Francois's urgent cry woke him. Tired from days of galloping, he stayed put as his training dictated. Marengo, without a command, refrained from attacking, even the strange creatures in view. He stood alert, growling softly, showing his suspicion. The mysterious figures, about fifty yards away, moved around silently. The smaller ones seemed to interact with the larger figure. The boys, feeling a mix of fear and fascination, debated their next move. They considered fleeing on horseback futile and climbing a tree useless.

The sudden brightness revealed a huge bear standing upright, its snout hit by a bullet, sending it into a furious gallop towards the young hunters. As they scrambled up trees, the bear circled below, sniffing and growling. Basil, thinking it was a grizzly, stayed low, but realized it was a cinnamon bear, a skilled climber. The bear began to climb the tree towards Basil, who regretted his misjudgment. Lucien and Francois, having dropped their guns, watched from nearby trees. The bear's powerful paws gripped the trunk as it advanced. The young hunters were trapped, fearing for their lives as the bear closed in on them.|"['1.

In a tense moment, Basil found himself high up in a tree with a fierce bear on his trail. With quick thinking and bravery, he devised a plan. As the bear closed in, Basil skillfully grabbed a lasso thrown by his brother, Lucien. With the bear just feet away, Basil secured the lasso around the branch, creating a makeshift zipline. As the bear lunged forward, Basil slid down the rope to safety. However, the rope fell short, leaving Basil dangling in the air. Thinking fast, Lucien and Francois caught him with a buffalo-skin held taut below. Basil landed safely, showing courage and resourcefulness in the face of danger.|['1.

The sudden attack by the hunter was too much for the female bear. Losing her grip, she was flung into the air and fell heavily to the ground, momentarily motionless. Although stunned, she was about to rise and retaliate, but before she could, Basil seized Francois' gun, loaded it, and swiftly shot her in the head, ending her life instantly. Meanwhile, the cubs had joined the scene, and Marengo, recovering from his earlier scolding, aggressively confronted them. The young bears fought fiercely, but with the help of their masters' rifles, Marengo was subdued. The mother bear and her cubs lay lifeless on the grass, a striking sight. The adult bear, weighing around five hundred pounds, had a rough fawn coat, while the cubs were uniformly black. This color variation is common among bears, influenced by factors like climate. North America hosts the black, polar, and grizzly bear species, with the cinnamon bear potentially constituting a separate species. The polar bear resides exclusively in Arctic regions near the sea, while the grizzly bear is known for its strength and ferocity, surpassing even the polar bear. The black bear, like its cinnamon counterpart, displays similar habits across various climates on the American continent, adapting to diverse environments from icy Canada to tropical Louisiana.|"[""1.

Black bears were once abundant in America before the arrival of colonizers. Due to the high demand for their skins, they have been extensively hunted, leading to a decline in their population. Fur companies have harvested thousands of bear skins over the past century from both white and Indian hunters. Despite this, black bears can still be found in remote, wild areas and occasionally in secluded mountainous regions. Surprisingly, their population has not been wiped out entirely, even though they are large and easily spotted. During winter, when bears could be easily tracked, they hibernate in caves or hollow trees, surviving on stored fat. Female bears give birth in winter but are rarely hunted during this time, as they retreat to hidden dens. This protective behavior helps ensure the survival of bear cubs. Black bears have a varied diet, including fish, fruit, and even carrion. Despite their scavenging habits, their meat is considered delicious, especially the paws, which are a prized delicacy among hunters.|"['1.

There are many ways to capture a bear. He is chased by trained dogs. When cornered, he will turn and fight the dogs. Bears run awkwardly on their feet, but they are faster than they appear due to their size. They can even outrun a man on foot. When they can't escape, they climb trees to hide, but the hounds can easily find them. Hunters then shoot them down. Bears can be trapped in various ways like log-traps and steel-traps. They are often caught more easily than other animals like lynxes and wolves. Bear meat is prepared by roasting it, and it tastes like a mix of young pork and veal. After a hearty breakfast, the brothers discussed their next steps as they had lost their provisions to wild boars. They decided to stay and prepare the bear meat for their journey ahead.|['1.

The bear was quickly skinned and sliced into thin pieces for jerking, a method of preserving meat without salt. Typically, the meat is left to dry in the sun over poles for three days to prevent spoilage. However, the adventurers opted for a quicker method by barbecuing thin slices over a fire. They dug a pit, laid green saplings over it, and placed the meat on top to dry and toast slightly. This barbecue method can preserve meat for months. While the meat dried, Basil used bear's grease to soothe Jeanette's injuries from the javalies. As night fell, they slept by the fire with their feet warm to ensure a good night's rest. Suddenly, Marengo's growl woke them, but they found nothing amiss in the peaceful forest night.|"['1.

In the dim forest, fireflies lit up the night, signaling an approaching storm. The young hunters, alert, noticed other lights on the ground. These were not insects but the glowing eyes of wild animals, possibly bears or panthers. Marengo, the dog, growled, sensing danger. The hunters readied their guns, wary of the lurking predators. Soon, the howls of barking-wolves echoed through the woods, setting the boys on edge. Prairie-wolves, smaller but cunning creatures, encircled the camp, scavenging for food. These wolves, resembling Indian dogs, roamed the prairies in packs, preying on vulnerable animals. The hunters, familiar with their ways, knew to keep watch as the night unfolded with eerie encounters in the wilderness.|"['1.

"Wolves in the American prairies often face hunger due to their large numbers. They resort to eating fruits, roots, and vegetables to survive. These wolves, known as ""barking"" wolves, howl like dogs but end in a high-pitched scream. Basil, Lucien, and Francois take turns keeping watch while camping. Despite the wolves' howling, Lucien and Francois quickly fall asleep due to exhaustion. Basil, feeling drowsy, brightens the fire to keep watch. He cleverly uses a lasso to hang the bear-meat out of reach of the wolves. Basil taunts the wolves before settling down for the night, ensuring the safety of their food supply."|['1.

Basil, thinking he had outsmarted the wolves, fell asleep near the meat. The wolves, observing this, crept closer and circled the meat, careful not to wake Basil. Some older wolves sat quietly, knowing the meat was out of reach. Others attempted to leap and grab the meat but failed. The wolves then cleverly gnawed through the rope holding the meat, causing it to fall on one wolf. Startled by the commotion, Marengo growled, waking Basil and his friends. They quickly grabbed their rifles and scared off the wolves. Despite the chaos, some wolves managed to snatch meat. To prevent further theft, Basil hoisted the meat higher in a tree.

The young hunters immediately recognized the distinct scream of the cougar in the forests of Louisiana, a sound they had heard before but never faced its attack. Despite the initial feeble and distant cry, they knew the fierce nature of the animal and the imminent danger it posed. As the screams grew closer, they sprang into action, gathering dry wood to create a circle of fires for protection. The cougar's howls drowned out all other sounds, even silencing the nearby wolves. With the horses stampeding in fear, the hunters and their loyal dog, Marengo, huddled within the safety of the blazing circle. Through the smoke and crackling flames, they could see not one, but a pair of cougars lurking nearby, eyeing the hanging meat. Despite the perilous situation, they stood ready, guns in hand, prepared to defend themselves against the predators.|"[""1.

The hunters realized their mistake in not cutting down the meat to prevent the cougars from trying to reach it. The cougars, unable to get to the meat, continued to eye it eagerly. One of the cougars attempted to climb the tree where the meat was hanging but failed to retrieve it. The boys, trapped within a small circle of fire, were overwhelmed by the increasing heat. The cougars, giving up on the meat, cautiously approached the fire, emitting strange sounds. The hunters, despite their fear, found the cougars less intimidating up close under the firelight. The cougars, ready to pounce, were a terrifying sight with their claws and teeth visible in the fire's glow.

As Basil finished speaking, three loud cracks rang out almost simultaneously. Lucien and Francois' shots were uncertain until later, but Basil's shot found its mark. He wounded the cougar, which leaped into the fiery circle before succumbing to its injuries. Marengo tried to attack but had to retreat from the cinders. The hunters listened to the sounds of horses and Jeanette the mule in the night, fearing the cougar's return. By daybreak, they discovered the cougar dead by a tree, crushed by Jeanette in her escape. The hunters, tired from the night's events, decided to move camp to avoid the dangerous creatures in the forest, such as bears and wolves driven out by the flooded river. They saddled up and headed west, passing through a beautiful flower-prairie with sunflowers, malvas, euphorbias, and lupins.|"[""1.

The bright sun shone down on the vast garden, glistening after a recent rain. Countless butterflies fluttered around, resting on the colorful flowers. Some butterflies were large with vibrant wings, while other insects added to the lively scene. Bees buzzed from bloom to bloom, collecting nectar. Partridges and grouse startled the horses as they rode through the flower-filled landscape, crushing petals underfoot. The sweet fragrance initially refreshed the tired travelers, but soon a drowsy feeling set in.

"On the third day of their journey, the travelers camped by a small stream in the prairie without trees. They used buffalo ""chips"" as fuel for their fire, a sign that buffaloes were close. The next morning, they scanned the vast prairie but saw no buffaloes yet. They noticed a distant butte, a lone hill, and decided to head in that direction in search of water. Lucien estimated it was about 30 miles away due to the clear air at their high elevation. Despite some uncertainty, they set off towards the butte, hoping to find water before nightfall. Lucien's lack of prairie experience made him underestimate the risk of traveling without a water source.

Our young hunters were not afraid as they ventured into the unknown desert. They had always been surrounded by water back home, with springs, wells, and streams readily available. This made it hard for them to understand the true terror of thirst in the dry desert. The journey had been through well-watered lands until now, but they were now entering the arid plains leading to the Rocky Mountains. Francois was bold, Basil was fearless, and Lucien, having read more about the dangers, felt some apprehension.

Basil pointed to a deep trough in the prairie, like a dry stream bed, a buffalo-road made by thousands of buffaloes migrating for better pastures or water. Lucien suggested the buffaloes dig these trails for water, offering a curious idea that they spin around to scratch themselves or for amusement.

Three boys were watching a group of wild horses approaching them. The leader, a magnificent white horse, caught their attention. The boys admired the beauty of the herd, with horses of various colors galloping closely together in a circle around them. The leader, resembling an Arab of the Andalusian breed, stood out for his perfect proportions and graceful movements. As the wild horses circled nearer, the boys were captivated by the sight of these noble creatures. The ground thundered under the horses' hoofs as they ran in a spiral curve towards the centre where the boys stood in awe.

Basil gazed at the magnificent horse, feeling an overwhelming desire to make it his own. Despite already owning a fine horse, Basil's weakness was coveting every beautiful horse he saw. This particular steed ignited a strong longing in him. Basil knew capturing the leader of the herd was a challenging feat, never achieved even by Indians. Determined to try, he whispered his plan to his brothers, who expressed concern about straying off course. Ignoring their advice, Basil resolved to capture the horse, willing to gallop fifty miles if needed. As the horses circled nearby, Basil mounted Black Hawk and spurred towards the leader, determined to separate it from the herd. The wild horses, curious yet wary, evaded Basil's advances. He focused on the white leader, riding towards it with determination, aiming to head the herd and achieve his goal.|"[""1.

The hunter rode his horse with skill, chasing the wild steeds across the prairie. His lasso ready but unused, he focused on the white leader ahead. The pursued mustangs scattered as the dark horse and its rider gained ground. The chase intensified, each horse pushing its limits. The pursuit was straight and swift, the hunter gaining ground due to the advantage of focus over the pursued's anxiety. Despite the wild horse's agility, the hunter closed in. The gap narrowed to two hundred paces, spurring the hunter to push harder. The chase continued, the hunter determined to capture the magnificent wild horse.|"[""1.

Basil was chasing a white steed when he noticed it moving strangely from side to side. He soon realized the ground was uneven, covered with hillocks causing the mustang to run oddly. Suddenly, Basil's horse stumbled and fell, throwing him off but thankfully not injuring him. The wild horse continued to flee among the hillocks. Basil knew it was futile and risky to continue the pursuit. He decided to abandon it, valuing his safety and his horse over capturing the mustang. As he watched the white steed disappear into the distance, Basil reflected on the lesson learned and waited for his companions to catch up. He had unknowingly galloped towards the butte, realizing he needed to wait for Lucien and Francois before proceeding.|"['1.

Black Hawk wandered off in search of grass, as it was scarce nearby, almost devoured by unseen creatures. Basil, confident in his horse's training, let him roam freely, knowing he could call him back with a whistle. While Basil scanned the prairie, he observed strange mounds scattered around. These cone-shaped mounds, with rat-sized holes at the top, covered the plain as far as his eyes could see. Soon, the timid inhabitants, prairie-dogs, cautiously emerged from their burrows, revealing their reddish-brown bodies and white bellies. These unique creatures, a blend of squirrels, weasels, and rats, lived in communal mounds, with several sharing a single abode. Alongside the prairie-dogs were burrowing owls, a different species, gracefully moving about the town. Basil marveled at the coexistence of these distinct creatures and pondered the mysteries of their survival and habitat choices.|"['1.

In the prairie, Basil observed various creatures like marmots, owls, lizards, horned frogs, and ground rattlesnakes. The creatures were intriguing yet intimidating, with their unique features and habits. Basil pondered if they were friends or foes, as some fed on grass while others preyed on insects and small animals. The presence of the ground rattlesnake added a sense of danger to the community. As Basil awaited his companions, Lucien and Francois, he reflected on the creatures' interactions. When the group reunited, they faced a challenge: navigating through the dog-town, a marmot village, to reach their destination. Despite the obstacles, they decided to proceed through the village, braving the barking marmots and continuing their journey towards the distant butte.|"['1.

The owls flew up, landing nearby, then flew off again, some disappearing from view while others hid in burrows like the marmots. Surprisingly, marmots, owls, snakes, lizards, and agamas were seen fleeing to the same mound at times. These burrows descended vertically for a few feet, then angled obliquely before ending in a chamber, the true home of the marmot. The mounds were meticulously constructed with earth brought up from below, compacted by the marmots' feet and covered with grass. The marmots sunned themselves on these mounds, using the elevated position to watch for enemies and retreat in time. The owls, on the other hand, took over some mounds from the marmots, neglecting the upkeep as they only sought shelter inside. While owls likely preyed on insects and beetles, some believed they occasionally fed on horned frogs and lizards. There were debates among naturalists about whether owls were community tyrants devouring marmots, particularly the young ones.|['1.

Lucien and his companions were on a journey through the prairie, marveling at the marmot village. As they rode cautiously, avoiding the mounds, they discussed the mysterious creatures' habits and nests. The marmots' spherical nests, woven from grass and roots, were a wonder to behold. These nests provided shelter during the cold season, with a small hole for air. The young hunters rode on, wary of the dangers lurking around them. The landscape changed abruptly as they encountered a vast fissure, a barranca, blocking their path. The deep crevice posed a daunting challenge, with sheer cliffs making it impossible to cross. As the sun began to set, their thirst grew, and the distant butte offered a glimmer of hope for water. The travelers pressed on, anxious about the dark night ahead and the uncertain journey that lay before them.|"['1.

This unexpected interruption left the travelers in dismay. They deliberated on whether to ride along the edge of the barranca to find a crossing or go back to the stream they had left in the morning, a fearful alternative due to the darkness and danger of the marmot hillocks. They decided to search for a crossing, riding along the edge in hopes of finding a shallower point. As night fell, they halted, unable to proceed in the darkness. Thirst and uncertainty plagued them throughout the sleepless night. At dawn, they continued along the edge, unable to retrace their steps without going back on their own tracks. Fortunately, they discovered a buffalo road, which led them safely across the barranca.

As the sun began to dip below the horizon, a group of weary travellers rode towards a hill in the vast American desert. Their horses, exhausted and gasping for air, trudged along like laden bees. Eager yet desperate looks filled their eyes as they approached the base of the hill. Suddenly, their mule Jeanette, a seasoned prairie traveler, sensed water and bolted ahead, leading the way to a refreshing spring surrounded by grass and willows. The hill they found themselves near was not quite a mountain or a hill but rather a mesa with a flat top rising above the prairie. Covered in pine trees, pinons, and cacti, it provided a picturesque setting for the tired adventurers to rest. They quickly gathered wood, water, and food from the land, including bear's meat, pinon cones, agave roots, and prairie-turnips. Despite their fatigue, they knew they would have a bountiful meal the next day. After a simple dinner, they settled down for a well-deserved night's sleep under the stars.|"['1.

The young hunters had a peaceful night's rest, undisturbed by any noise. Despite their challenging journey, they woke up feeling refreshed and invigorated. Lucien credited the dry climate for their newfound energy, as the arid surroundings held one of the world's healthiest atmospheres. They quickly prepared a hearty breakfast, gathering pinon cones and bear meat for a satisfying meal. For dinner, they unearthed sego and prairie-turnips, along with a mallow root resembling parsnips. After breakfast, they spent time cleaning and organizing their gear, taking a break to watch the prairie for buffalo. They decided to stay put for a day or two to rest their animals. The boys repaired their equipment, cleaned their guns, and tended to their horses. As they relaxed by the spring, they reflected on their adventures and their father's anticipated joy upon their return. Wolves lurked nearby, prompting Basil and Francois to ready their guns for a potential antelope sighting.|"[""1.

Antelopes are similar to deer in many ways, but there are a few key differences. Deer lack a gall-bladder, while all antelopes have one. Another distinction is in their horns: deer have solid bony horns, while antelopes have horns more similar to those of a goat. Despite these differences, naturalists believe there is only one species of antelope in North America, the prong-horned antelope. These animals are found on the great prairies of the far west and are known for their shyness and speed. Hunters often use cunning strategies to approach them. Basil and Francois, armed with their guns, observed a herd of antelopes approaching a spring. The hunters stayed hidden behind willow bushes, waiting for the perfect moment to take a shot.|['1.

As the antelope herd approached a group of wolves pretending to be asleep, the leader hesitated but soon grew bolder. The wolves lay perfectly still, their bodies touching so closely that they seemed like a single entity. The antelopes, filled with fear and curiosity, cautiously followed their leader's every move. Despite the wolves' attempt to deceive them, the antelopes advanced, sniffing the air and snorting in uncertainty.

A group of wolves cunningly attacked an antelope, dragging it to the ground and worrying it. The frightened antelope herd scattered, evading the hunters' shots. The wolves, blood-stained and feasting on their prey, were shot by the hunters to save the venison. The hunters reloaded and quickly approached the wolves, firing and hitting two. The boys saw the remains of the antelope, disappointed at the loss of fresh venison. As they returned to camp, they noticed another larger herd of antelopes led by a buck heading towards the spring for water.

As they approached the spring, they veered left, reaching a rivulet where they drank and grazed along the bank. Disappointed that the antelopes were moving away, the hunters pondered their next move. Basil, recalling a hunter's trick, grabbed a red blanket and a forked stick. Concealed behind the blanket, he intrigued the antelopes, luring them closer. When one was within range, he took a shot, but it fled with the herd. Surprised by the miss, Basil realized the antelope was wounded, as wolves pursued it. Determined to follow, he mounted his horse bareback and galloped after the chase, aiming to witness the outcome.|"['1.

The young hunter rode hard for five miles, but arrived too late to save the antelope from the wolves. Despite their disappointment, a stew of bear meat and parsnips prepared by Lucien lifted their spirits. As night fell, their sleep was disturbed by the restless behavior of their animals, alarmed by a mysterious snorting sound in the distance. Fearing the presence of grizzly bears or cougars, they took turns keeping watch by the fire throughout the night. With the break of dawn, they refreshed themselves, released their horses to graze, and discussed their dwindling food supplies. Concerned about their future sustenance without game in sight, they decided to climb the nearby butte to survey the surrounding landscape for potential prey. Setting off on foot, they hoped to spot buffalo herds from the summit to guide their next move.|"['1.

"Upon reaching the furthest point of the butte, the young explorers spotted a distant range of cliffs resembling low mountains running north to south. These cliffs marked the eastern edge of the renowned ""Llano Estacado,"" or ""Staked Plain."" Recognizing the features of this tableland, the boys continued around the southern side of the butte. The cliffs rose steeply, offering no easy ascent, with dark rocks and trees jutting out. While gazing upward, the boys saw strange creatures on the precipice above—large animals resembling deer but with reddish backs and white underparts. These were ""cimmarons,"" wild sheep of the Rockies, with males sporting massive, curved horns. Despite attempts to aim their guns, the creatures vanished quickly. The boys lingered in hopes of another sighting but eventually moved on in search of a climb."|"['1.

The brothers were eager to reach the top of the butte to find wild sheep for food. Lucien doubted the sheep would stay on the cliff as they needed water and must descend to a spring. He explained how agile the sheep were, leaping down cliffs and running along ledges. Lucien believed they were antelopes, not sheep, due to their behavior and differences. As they reached the eastern end, they found a path up the cliff with a spring and bear tracks nearby. The tracks, with five claw marks, confirmed a grizzly bear had been there. The boys were amazed by the tracks, realizing the dangerous animal had been close.|"[""1.

Our young hunters hesitated briefly, feeling alarmed upon discovering bear tracks. Despite the potential danger of encountering grizzly bears in the ravine, they were determined to ascend the butte for a shot at the big-horns. As they climbed, they noticed a faint trail made by animals passing through. About halfway up, they spotted a cave-like fissure that hinted at a possible den. Reaching the summit, they found a flat area with scattered pine trees and acacia bushes. There, they witnessed a herd of big-horns engaged in fierce battles, with the males butting heads in a display of dominance. The ewes, however, seemed unbothered by the commotion, continuing to graze as if unfazed by the conflict unfolding among the males.|['1.

The hunters believed they had trapped the entire flock. Lucien and Marengo stayed behind to guard the pass, while Basil and Francois moved closer for a shot. They crept up unnoticed and took aim at the big-horns. Two animals fell, while the rest fled over the cliff. The hunters, curious about the fallen big-horn, discovered it hanging by its horn from a tree. Basil ended its suffering with a shot. They skinned the animals and prepared the meat for transport. To descend the cliff, they tossed the meat down. They planned to return for the rest.|"[""1.

The plan was quickly accepted, and they began tossing the pieces down the chasm, watching as they landed among the rocks below. Upon returning to the carcasses for more, they were startled by a terrifying sight. Down in the ravine, a massive and fearsome creature was feasting on the meat - a grizzly bear! Nearly twice the size of a common bear, its shaggy greyish-brown fur, fiery eyes, and long claws marked it as a formidable foe. As they prepared to defend themselves, they noticed not just one, but three grizzly bears enjoying the meal. The adult bears, one black and two brown, tore at the meat with savage delight. The boys, frozen in terror, knew the danger they faced. Grizzly bears were known for their strength and ferocity, capable of withstanding multiple gunshots and chasing down even seasoned hunters.

The boys found themselves in a dangerous situation with bears blocking their way down the ravine. They had no other route back to camp. The bears' lair was nearby, and the boys feared being attacked if they tried to descend. They worried that the bears might chase them down if they attempted to escape. The horses were far away, leaving the boys vulnerable. They considered shooting at the bears, but the risk was too high. The bears finished their meal and turned towards the boys, who desperately hoped for the bears to leave so they could safely descend. The boys anxiously waited, knowing that their chances of survival were slim in the face of the approaching bears.|"[""1.

The hunters initially thought of fleeing when they saw the bears approaching. However, Basil, feeling angry, decided to shoot at the bears with his rifle. His brothers followed suit, firing at the bears. One bear fell back down the ravine, but the largest one continued to advance, growling menacingly. The hunters, unable to reload their weapons, ran across a table-like area, unsure of where to go. As they glanced back, they saw the bear climbing up after them. In a moment of crisis, Basil remembered that grizzly bears cannot climb trees. He shouted to his brothers, and they all climbed up nearby trees to escape the bear's wrath. The bear tried to reach them by shaking the trees but eventually gave up and settled down to rest.|"['1.

What happened to the female bear and her cub? Were they hit by the shots fired at them? The boys couldn't see them on the summit yet. They were still in the ravine, but it was unclear if they were dead or alive. The dog Marengo wisely avoided the bear and hid on the edge of the table, trembling with fear. The young hunters were stuck in the trees, unable to move without risking an encounter with the bear. They were suffering from extreme thirst, having no water with them. They were helpless, unable to retrieve their guns on the ground. In the distance, they saw a herd of buffaloes moving northward, making their situation even more unbearable.

Basil and his brothers were in a perilous situation as they encountered a white buffalo during their hunt. The sight of the buffalo excited them momentarily, but the danger of their position soon became apparent when a grizzly bear below them was disturbed by their cheers.

The boys descended from the trees, armed and ready. They hurried towards a ravine, hoping to find a clear path to a spring below. Unfortunately, they discovered the she-bear standing guard over her cub, which lay lifeless at the bottom. Trapped by the bear, they pondered their next move. Thirsty and desperate, one of the boys remembered the cactus plants nearby. They cut open the plants and quenched their thirst with the water inside. As night fell, they realized the bear still blocked their escape. With the moonlight revealing their every move, attempting to descend was too risky.

All night long, the group stayed awake, listening to the sounds of their horses below, wondering about their fate. The echoes of Jeanette's cries mixed with the howls of the prairie-wolf and the snorts of bears, keeping them alert. Fearful of the bears, they perched in trees to avoid sleep. Morning arrived, revealing the bear still guarding her young. Hunger and thirst plagued them, with only cactus juice to drink. They longed for water from the spring below and worried about missing the buffaloes fleeing north. Basil suggested provoking the bear, but Lucien proposed scouting for another way down. With a glimmer of hope, they agreed to explore, hoping to escape their mountain prison. Basil then excitedly shared a plan to swiftly descend, feeling hopeful for their escape.|"['1.

As Basil spoke, he walked towards where they had cut the big-horn animals. He took out his hunting knife and began to cut one of the skins into strips. Lucien helped him while Francois went to watch for the bear. The brothers cut both hides into strips, making a long rope with pine branches knotted in. They tied one end to a tree and the other to their belongings and a stone to test its strength. Francois went down first, using the wood pieces as steps. Lucien and Basil followed. They quickly reached the prairie. After a quick meal, they rode west, planning to find buffalo tracks and then head north to find the herd. They noticed vultures circling above a cimmaron's body hanging from a tree. The vultures were a mix of turkey-buzzards and black vultures.|"['1.

The turkey-buzzard and the black vulture may seem similar at first glance, but there are key distinctions. The buzzard is more elegant and graceful, with longer wings and a tapering tail. While the black vulture flies heavily, flapping its wings and spreading its tail like a fan, the buzzard soars effortlessly with wings held upward. Some believe the buzzard uses heated air to rise without flapping its wings, a theory that requires further proof. Both birds scavenge for food, but the buzzard also hunts snakes and small animals. While they are often solitary, they gather in large groups to feed on carrion. The buzzard is more elusive and less likely to flock than the black vulture, often seen soaring alone in the sky.|"['1.

Vultures are protected birds in many countries, including English and Spanish America, where there are fines for harming them. As a result, they are rarely disturbed and can be quite tame, sometimes even allowing people to approach them closely. In Southern States, they are comfortable enough to rest on rooftops and streets. Similarly, in Mexico and South America, these birds are commonly seen in cities. The young hunters observed the vultures from a distance, noticing their behavior around a carcass. The resemblance between a turkey-buzzard and a turkey-hen is striking, as they share similar colors and shapes. A story was shared illustrating the cunning of a white man over an Indian in a hunting scenario, emphasizing the differences in their approach to fairness.|['1.

Lucien and his brother discussed the deceitful ways of some white men towards Native Americans, exchanging pewter dollars for furs. Lucien shared suspicions about a fur trader who built his fortune this way. The conversation shifted to vultures, observing their behavior as they descended from the sky. Lucien corrected a misconception about vultures having a keen sense of smell, explaining that they rely more on sight. They marveled at the vultures' ability to spot carrion from afar, dispelling myths about their sense of smell. Lucien explained how vultures' keen eyesight and social behavior allow them to locate food sources efficiently.|"['1.

Lucien explained to Francois that vultures communicate and coordinate their movements while hunting for food. They sweep through the air in circles, and when one spots carrion, it descends, followed by others in a chain reaction. By observing the vultures, Lucien deduced that they all start their flight within a few seconds of each other. If they know the speed of the birds and the time of arrival, they can calculate the distance traveled. The vultures wait for the carcass to decompose before feeding because their claws lack the strength to tear through tough hides. An incident occurs where the vultures cause a tree to collapse, exposing the carcass for easier access. The young hunters find the behavior of the vultures fascinating and decide to observe them further.|"['1.

A new and intriguing sight caught the attention of Francois and his friends Lucien and Basil. While gazing at the vultures soaring above, Francois spotted a large white bird in the sky. Its size puzzled them as it flew gracefully at a great height, larger and different from any known bird species. It was not a gull, swan, pelican, ibis, egret heron, or eagle due to its unique flight pattern and color. As they observed, the mysterious bird began to descend towards them, growing larger as it approached. Despite their curiosity and inability to identify the bird, they hoped it would continue its descent to reveal its true nature, knowing it had already spotted them. Their excitement grew as they eagerly awaited the bird's arrival, unable to hide or seek cover from its watchful eyes.|"[""1.

As they watched, three voices exclaimed in unison, signaling the appearance of another white bird. High above, like a speck of snow against the sky, it descended in a similar path to the first bird they had seen. The two birds, both beautiful in their own right, spiraled down together directly above the vultures. The boys marveled at the birds' cream-colored bodies, glossy brown wings, and the striking orange and red hues on their heads and necks. The birds, with their orange-red beaks and captivating features, were a sight to behold. Ignoring the buzzards and black vultures, the king-vultures descended towards the carcass, causing the other scavengers to scatter. Watching the king-vultures feast on the carrion, the boys were both fascinated and repulsed by the transformation of the once pristine birds into a gory mess. Despite their initial curiosity, the boys were relieved to let the vultures go due to their overpowering stench.|"[""1.

As they rode away from the butte, the group discussed the vultures they had seen. The naturalist shared a lot about these striking birds, piquing the curiosity of Basil and Francois about a new species they encountered - the king vulture. Lucien noted that the study of vultures has been hindered by overcomplicated classifications by some scientists, particularly the French, who tend to create numerous genera and species without a deep understanding of the birds' behavior. He argued that vultures and eagles share many similarities and could be grouped together, as both have similar habits and physiognomy. Lucien also mentioned that vultures, like eagles, can hunt for their prey and do not always feed on carrion. He highlighted the unique bone-eating habit of the lammergeyer, a type of vulture, which he learned from a bird feeder in Regent's Park. The conversation delved into the differences between vultures and eagles, pointing out that vultures have less developed claws and weaker limbs, making them less adept at hunting live prey or carrying heavy carcasses. Lucien also debunked exaggerated stories about vultures, particularly the condor, propagated by early Spanish conquerors. He emphasized the importance of accurate observation and knowledge in understanding these magnificent birds.|"['1.

The condor is a large bird known for its fleshy crest that sits atop its head and part of its beak, a feature only found in males. These birds have a black-and-white appearance, with a dark body, tail, shoulders, and wings, but a greyish-white color when their wings are closed. They also have a milk-white downy ruff around their neck and breast. Young condors lack feathers and have a brownish-black color until they mature, usually around three years old. The condor's wingspan can reach up to eight feet, although some have been reported to measure even larger. These birds primarily feed on carrion but can resort to hunting sheep, lambs, and other animals when food is scarce. While they are not protected by law due to their predatory habits, condors are sometimes kept as pets by the locals. Hunters capture condors by shooting them near carcasses, lassoing them after they have eaten, or trapping them in enclosures.|['1.

Condors are captured by hunters using a unique method adopted by the Indians of the Sierras. The hunter conceals himself under the skin of a freshly taken animal with flesh attached. Positioned in an open area, the hunter waits for the condors flying high above to notice him. Once a condor swoops down and lands on the hide to feed on the flesh, the hunter grabs its leg, securing it with a rope. The captured condor is then led away by the hunter. These birds thrive in the Andes due to their breeding and resting spots high in the inaccessible peaks, providing them safety from predators. This secure habitat ensures the condor's survival, unlike other creatures facing extinction due to vulnerable breeding grounds.|"['1.

"Lucien explained that the condors do not build nests but prefer cavities in rocks or soil to lay their eggs. Little is known about their life in high regions due to the natives rarely venturing there. Condors descend to plateaus and valleys for food, mostly in the mornings and evenings, resting on high rocks during mid-day. They can withstand cold better than heat. The King-vulture, unlike the condor, inhabits low savannas and plains, preferring heat and feeding on carrion, dead fish, serpents, and small mammals. It is called ""painted"" due to its colorful head and neck. The Californian vulture, nearly as large as the condor, resides in the Sierra Nevada mountains, constructing nests in tall trees and feeding on carrion. It is found as far north as Oregon, where it lays two large black eggs and raises its young."|"['1.

"Vultures are fascinating birds known for their shyness and wariness. They are difficult to approach, especially when they are not full from eating. Their thick plumage makes them tough to kill even when they are within shooting range. Vultures have long, graceful wings that allow them to fly with ease, resembling the flight of turkey-buzzards. Naturalists have identified five species of American vultures, including the turkey-buzzard and black vulture. However, there may be more species in America, like the unique ""gavilucho"" in Guayana. The red-headed gallinazo in South America appears distinct from the turkey-buzzard. As our young travelers journeyed on the buffalo trail, they faced hunger as their food supplies ran out.

As the night approached, the hunger of the adventurers grew unbearable. Their gaze shifted between Jeanette and Marengo, the mule and the dog, contemplating the difficult decision of which companion to sacrifice due to starvation. Both animals had been loyal and helpful during their journey. Marengo had saved Francois, while Jeanette had protected them from cougars. Despite their services, the group faced the grim reality of having to choose one to save the others. While Marengo had been a faithful sentinel and beloved companion, Jeanette, though known for her stubbornness, had also been a useful animal. After much deliberation, a unanimous decision was made - Jeanette must be the one to go. The group struggled with the weight of their choice, knowing that poor Jeanette was unaware of her impending fate.

How far could this unusual area stretch? They couldn't guess the distance. Lucien knew such formations could go on for miles. If that was the case, they might never be able to cross it. Both they and the animals were thirsty and tired. Eager to catch up with the buffalo, they had rested very little in the past days. They started to worry. Thirst became stronger than hunger, harder to endure. Following the buffalo tracks, they rode sadly through a white cloud enveloping them on their fearful journey. They had no trouble following the trail, the heavy dust showing where the buffalo had passed. They hoped the animals had gone towards water, which kept them going. As evening fell and the hills turned blue, they left the gypsum ravines and reached the green prairie. The landscape ahead hinted at water nearby. Soon, they spotted a small stream. Everyone drank and bathed in the fresh water, washing off the gypsum dust. They were lucky it was freshwater; saltwater streams common in gypsum areas would have been deadly. The water helped ease their hunger, and they considered giving Jeanette a break until morning. While discussing this, they noticed Marengo had wandered off. They found him near a buffalo skeleton, picked clean by wolves. Lucien suggested making soup from the bones, and they agreed. They prepared to cook the bones, hoping for a nourishing meal.|['1.

Francois and Lucien were startled by Basil's laughter, unsure why he found humor in their dire situation.

In time, the marrow was adequately cooked, and after cracking the bones, they enjoyed the savory contents with delight. A refreshing cup of water accompanied the meal, and hunger and thirst were now a thing of the past. Jeanette was spared without any objection. The hopeful atmosphere surrounded our adventurers once more. There was sufficient marrow left to sustain them for at least two days as it is highly nutritious. Following the buffalo trail, they expected to find more skeletons for food. Notably, the bones were still fresh, indicating recent buffalo activity nearby. With optimism, they sat around the fire discussing these promising signs. The next morning, the young hunters were up early, feeling invigorated and content. Jeanette, full of energy, was kept in check by her leash. A fire was lit, and they indulged in a hearty meal before setting off joyfully on their journey through the rolling prairie.|['1.

Most of the names in this untamed region were given by trappers, the true pioneers. Who truly has the right to name them? While scientific men and topographical officers may explore and map the land, the trappers' names, often reflecting nature, hold a special honor. The adventurers traveled across a rolling prairie, resembling a calm sea after a storm. The ridges and valleys extended east to west, creating a path of ups and downs. As they rode, hoping to spot buffaloes, they were surprised by a fierce sight. In a circular valley with a spring, a group of large, fierce buffaloes engaged in a brutal battle, their roars echoing through the meadow. The meadow resembled an amphitheater, the perfect stage for their intense combat.|"[""1.

The hunters quickly devised a plan to approach the buffaloes unnoticed. Two hunters stayed on horseback to chase the animals, while Basil crept on foot to get a clear shot. Basil successfully shot one of the buffaloes, causing the others to flee. However, to their surprise, the wounded buffalo was surrounded by wolves. The hunters intervened to prevent the wolves from damaging the buffalo's skin. A well-aimed shot from Basil ultimately brought down the buffalo, revealing that it was actually a black buffalo painted white. Despite the unexpected discovery, the hunters successfully secured their quarry.|"[""1.

The hunters pondered over the strange phenomenon and soon discovered the cause. The buffaloes had rolled in white mud from the gypsum hills after a night of rain, giving them a deceptive appearance. Despite the initial disappointment, the hunters found fresh meat from a black buffalo for dinner. They dined on buffalo-beef for the first time and prepared more meat for the journey ahead. As night fell, they camped near the skinned buffalo, with one keeping watch to ward off wolves attracted by the scent of the cooking meat. Basil, feeling sleepy during his watch, planned to scare off the wolves with his rifle at daybreak. However, as he aimed at a wolf sneaking in the dark, a loud scream shattered the night - the war-cry of approaching Indians.|"['1.

Three boys found themselves surrounded by tall savages, their arms bound behind their backs. The savages, hesitant to kill them due to a previous incident, led the boys on horseback to a large encampment by a river. There, the prisoners were tormented by squaws who dunked them in the river and subjected them to cruel treatment. Meanwhile, Basil, who had been knocked senseless, finally regained his senses and tried to access a secret charm hidden under his hunting-shirt to help them. However, his hands were tied, and his attempts were futile. As his brothers were also tied up and unable to assist, Basil's efforts to use the charm were thwarted by the cruel actions of the squaws.|"[""1.

Basil felt alarmed as he observed the Indians' behavior. He worried that their charm might not protect them. Trying to communicate, he gestured to the squaws, but they found it amusing. Meanwhile, the Indian men debated the prisoners' fate, some appearing angry. They pointed to a spot and armed themselves with bows. The boys feared the worst as they realized the plan was to tie them to a stake for target practice. The squaws and children eagerly anticipated the spectacle. Basil was chosen first, and the savages stripped him, revealing a pipe-head made of red clay-stone. The Indians were intrigued by it, and after Basil explained its significance through signs, they freed the boys, embracing them warmly.|"[""1.
