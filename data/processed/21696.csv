"Nuna, with a glint in her eyes, pondered aloud, ""Has my husband turned into a walrus, only able to bellow and snort?""

In the Arctic hut, the Eskimo's sons quickly readied the sledge as their father spoke. Covered in warm bearskins, the Eskimo silently left the hut, jumping onto the sledge. Ermigit controlled the dogs, fastened to the sledge, while Norrak handed his father a heavy whip. With a crack, the whip spurred the dogs into action, racing off among the icy hummocks. Meanwhile, Red Rooney, also known as Reginald, woke in the hut. Discovering a piece of blubber, he chewed on it, savoring the taste after months of scarcity. Suddenly, a large white bear appeared at the air-hole, snatching the blubber. Rooney, unable to defend himself, stayed motionless, as the bear sniffed around.

The timely arrival of Okiok was crucial as the bear, with a hint of anger, retreated upon hearing his voice. It seemed the bear may have had a connection to someone who vanished after hearing Okiok's voice. Okiok rushed to the fallen figure, revealing Red Rooney, a shipwrecked seaman, still alive. Norrak brought food, which Rooney gratefully devoured. The Eskimos, Okiok and his son, watched with a mix of interest and awe. Rooney, in a mix of Eskimo and English, expressed gratitude for being saved. Rooney was so weak that he couldn't walk to the sledge, his willpower fading with the relief of rescue.

After supper, the family settled down for the night, each facing the stranger. They gazed until sleep overtook them, closing their eyes like stars fading at dawn. Okiok and his wife lingered, sharing walrus bits by lamplight. The lamp's smoke, fueled by seal oil, swirled artistically, offering contemplation. Nuna, amused, glanced at Nunaga asleep in the corner. Startled by news of Angut's affections, Nuna was perplexed. Red Rooney awoke in a stone hut, observing soot-covered walls, animal skulls, and primitive furnishings. Overwhelmed, he sighed and drifted back to sleep. Nuna, accidentally causing a ruckus, was relieved Rooney remained undisturbed.

One morning, the peaceful atmosphere was unexpectedly disrupted by a hungry dog dashing into the hut to steal some food. The Eskimos, startled by the commotion, watched as Norrak skillfully threw a walrus rib to stop the dog. Red Rooney, awakened by the chaos, sat up and observed the scene with curiosity.

Rooney was quite active at that moment, as the conversation had amused him greatly and the last comment almost overwhelmed him. Not wanting to let the angekok leave without a chat, he conveniently woke up, yawned, and stretched. In doing so, he showcased a level of strength and vigor that left a positive impression on the Eskimos, as physical prowess is highly valued among them.

When a shaman has enough bravery to embark on this journey, his spirit guide, after giving him detailed instructions, leads him beneath the earth or sea, passing through the realm of blissful souls. Eventually, they reach a terrifying void, spanned by a spinning wheel above a vast chasm. This dreadful abyss is crossed by a rope, guarded by seal sentinels. Guided by his spirit guide, the shaman traverses the rope over the chasm and past the sentinels into the palace of the Fury. Upon seeing the unwelcome visitors, the Fury tries to suffocate them with the stench of burning sea-fowl feathers but fails. The shaman and his guide seize the Fury, breaking her spell over the ocean creatures. As a result, the creatures are freed and return to the sea's surface.

"""Do you want to grow fatter?"" asked Arbalik's mother sharply, drawing a laugh from everyone as Pussimek was already quite plump. Ignoring Kannoa's response, Arbalik rose to speak. A handsome Eskimo, he had sharp eyes and a pleasant mouth. The jovial big hunter, Simek, mentioned the mysterious Kablunet, respecting Ujarak's advice. Ippegoo supported Ujarak, and Angut, a man of nature, spoke softly about hearing the whispers of winds and ice. Despite being seen as a wise man, Angut denied being an angekok. Alone, he set off towards the glacier while the others went hunting. Meanwhile, Angut surprised the hut's occupants, including Okiok and Nunaga, with a silent visit.

Ujarak heard a voice, his Conscience, but ignored it. He pondered an escape plan from a looming duel. Lost in thought, he found a solution in Ippegoo, a door to freedom. Ujarak decided to become an angekok, a serious and ceremonial task. He planned to delay the singing duel by creating a new wizard and taking Nunaga on a journey. Despite disappointment, the people accepted the delay. As the night waned, they retired, leaving Ujarak and Ippegoo awake. They ventured into a mysterious cave, hinting at a journey into the spirit world. The wizard assured Ippegoo of safety and wisdom as they embarked on this transformative path.|['1.

Ippegoo, a humble man, found himself in a situation where honors he did not desire were thrust upon him. Despite feeling utterly unfit for the high honor destined for him by Ujarak, he lacked the courage to resist. As they ventured deep into a cave, the wizard's presence instilled fear in Ippegoo. The icy surroundings and eerie atmosphere heightened his superstitious beliefs. The wizard's solemn gaze and the deafening crashes in the cave added to his terror. Ippegoo, feeling inadequate for the role, sought reassurance from the wizard, who emphasized the importance of solemnity for the upcoming task. Although doubtful, Ippegoo agreed to comply, hoping that the change ahead would transform him for the better, akin to the changing seasons he observed.

Okiok quickly got ready and headed to Ippegoo's mother's hut without any formal greetings, as Eskimos don't usually engage in such pleasantries. He was direct and started the conversation with Pussi's voice, who had followed Kunelik home after falling asleep at a celebration. The youth, feeling anxious about a change coming over him, had a hearty breakfast to calm his nerves. Throughout the day, he moved silently through the village, creating a mix of amusement and awe among the people. Rumors spread that Ippegoo was to become the next angekok, confirmed by Ujarak and other wizards. Later, Rooney visited Okiok's hut, discussing their views on spirits and the supernatural. Okiok expressed his disbelief in spirits, emphasizing the importance of feeling and acting as proof of their existence.|"[""1.

The seaman explained how we can feel the Great Spirit through nature, like when we see flowers grow, or hear the wind, or see the stars shine. He believed in the Great Spirit and thought it foolish to deny its existence. The Eskimo, Okiok, doubted the torngaks and Ujarak, who he believed to be a liar and a fool. He suspected Ujarak had a secret motive for rushing Ippegoo into becoming an angekok without the usual rituals. To become an angekok, an Eskimo must win a spirit of the elements through fasting and meditation. Torngarsuk, the chief spirit, is prayed to for a familiar spirit. Some aspirants claim Torngarsuk appears, causing them to shout and faint. Okiok was puzzled by Ujarak's sudden changes to tradition and feared his intentions were ill.|"['1.

Rooney wanted to chuckle at the old woman's words but held back, seeing tears welling in her eyes. She tightened her grip on his arm, asking if he ever felt his heart break and then go numb forever. The seaman, moved by her vulnerability, kissed her forehead before leaving. Meanwhile, Ippegoo dreaded his upcoming role in a ceremony.

It is believed that putting in a great effort and having a strong desire to achieve something can boost mental strength. Ippegoo, a young boy, showcased this by energetically playing his drum, which made him feel more powerful and hopeful. His excitement led him to a moment of revelation, and he let out a yell that surprised everyone. After exhausting himself, he followed instructions to reach a state of enthusiasm. Guided by Ujarak, he entered Angut's hut filled with people, with the Kablunet and Okiok observing. Ippegoo was positioned and bound, and the room was darkened for his encounter with the torngak spirit. Despite his efforts, the torngak did not appear, leaving Ippegoo disappointed. His attempts to induce a trance-like state to connect with the spirit were unsuccessful, and the atmosphere became tense as they waited for a response.|"['1.

In a dimly lit hut, an eerie figure slowly rose, appearing as a massive bear looming over the crowd. The audience, frozen in place, watched in awe except for Ujarak, who cautiously approached the bear, suspecting a trick. As he neared, he was struck on the forehead, falling back in a daze. Suddenly, a mysterious voice filled the room, declaring that the assembly must disband and cease their attempts at becoming an angekok. The voice belonged to Red Rooney, whose deep bass voice shifted into a falsetto, creating a chilling atmosphere. With a mighty roar, Rooney's dramatic performance caused chaos as wood and stones crashed down, ending the gathering abruptly.|"['1.

It was enough. The tunnel entrance of the hut was short and weak, preventing suffocation. Ujarak and Simek cleared the passage, allowing the group to escape. Kunelik, the last to leave, left with a flourish. When the lamps were relit, laughter filled the room. Ippegoo, still bound, showed fear and surprise. Rooney approached him, while Angut watched with a knowing smile. Ippegoo realized the deception and decided to keep his distance from the wizard. He confided in his mother, breaking the secrecy. The group suspected Ujarak might try to escape, but Rooney had a plan to catch him. Angut kept the wizard talking until he couldn't anymore, then bid him goodnight. Rooney decided to stay the night in Ujarak's hut to hear the end of the story.|[]|[]
The wizard sighed, realizing his plan to escape in the dark was thwarted. He embraced the situation and delved into fantastical adventures, surprising even himself with his vivid imagination. When Ujarak noticed his guest asleep, he ended his incredible tale and rested. The wizard continued to sleep soundly, undisturbed by the seaman who quietly left to admire the breathtaking view of the sea from a cliff. The sparkling sea and distant icy peaks seemed to expand the world, enhancing his senses. Below, the Eskimo village appeared tiny, with children playing joyfully. Rooney recognized his friend and felt a pang of sadness, missing his family back in Ireland. The children's excitement led the community to a singing contest on the ice, bringing cheer despite their simple ways. The villagers formed a ring, placing children in front, women in the middle, and men at the back. Ujarak entered the circle, drum in hand, ready to begin the contest. The Eskimo language, rich in metaphors, added depth to the combat that was about to unfold.|['1.

"Ujarak's first move in the ring was to stare fiercely at his opponent, Okiok, who returned the glare with a sneer. Ujarak then engaged the audience with a rhythmic song, starting with the chorus ""Amna ajah ajah hey!"" The meaning of these words remains a mystery, but they were enthusiastically echoed by his supporters. Ujarak continued his performance, criticizing Okiok for being a poor hunter and an inaccurate spear-thrower. Despite a stumble during his dance, Ujarak maintained his composure and continued to mock Okiok. The duel between the two contestants involved alternating attacks and counter-attacks until one conceded.

In a remote village, Okiok, a humble hunter, sang a heartfelt plea to the spirit Torngak for guidance. Despite his sincerity, Torngak declined, warning against foolish mistakes like trying to make angekok-stew from a lad named Ippegoo. Suddenly, the ice beneath them cracked, causing panic as a massive iceberg toppled. Amidst the chaos, little Pussi almost got left behind but was saved by Red Rooney, with help from Okiok and Angut. The villagers narrowly escaped the falling ice, leaping over a gap to safety. As the danger passed, Ujarak, feeling outmatched by Okiok, pondered his next move.

Ujarak, a wizard, was furious when his pupil, Ippegoo, showed no fear during his outburst. Ujarak's anger was unpredictable, depending on the situation. If Ippegoo had shown any sign of fear, Ujarak might have harmed him. However, Ippegoo's calm demeanor surprised and alarmed Ujarak. Ujarak accused Ippegoo of being bewitched by Angut and the Kablunet. He tried to unbewitch him with his torngak. Later, Ujarak sent Ippegoo to tell Nunaga that Angut wanted to see her.

Nunaga was unsuspecting as she halted her father's best team of dogs, the swiftest in the village.

The wizard, Ujarak, had a clear goal: to journey hundreds of miles to the Kablunet settlements in Greenland. Despite the strange reports about the area, he kept his intentions hidden from his captives. After a brief drive of twenty miles, he freed them to rest. Tumbler and Pussi, the dogs, and the captives were relieved to relax after the tense journey. The sled was equipped with hunting tools, but only held a small seal for food. Ujarak urged his powerful dogs across the ice, facing dangers and challenges along the way. As they raced towards safety, the women clung to each other, fearing for their lives.

The wizard, Ujarak, sensed the danger had passed without needing to say a word. The exhausted animals flopped down to rest, but Ujarak's fear of being pursued urged him to continue the escape. As the sun set, they hurried over the frozen sea until darkness forced a slower pace. Ujarak stopped, allowing the women to feed the dogs raw seal meat. Kabelaw shared cooked seal from his boots, a habit he never skipped on journeys. Ujarak, still silent, resumed the journey under the moonlit sky with the aurora borealis dancing overhead. After a long night and sixty miles traveled, Ujarak finally felt safe enough to rest. He ate raw seal, leaving the women and children to manage on their own. The women noticed Ujarak's change in demeanor, sensing his remorse for his actions. Meanwhile, Simek, Nunaga's father, raced back to the village in distress upon learning Nunaga and the children were missing. Upon meeting Okiok and Angut, who were unaware of the situation, the news struck them differently, causing anger and subdued emotions, respectively.|"['1.

Angut, with a calm yet resolute demeanor, directed his friends on a mission that left them impressed. He gave clear instructions to each man, sending them off in different directions to search for fugitives. With a crack of his whip, the dogs sprang into action, and they set off swiftly. Despite the challenging terrain, the Eskimos searched tirelessly, circling over ice and snow. As night fell and the moon rose, the search continued. Exhausted and disheartened, the unsuccessful searchers returned the next day. Okiok and his sons found no sign of the fugitives. Meanwhile, Angut, maintaining a clear mind, drove methodically to Moss Bay. Carefully observing the tracks, he eventually discovered a divergence where Ujarak had joined the women. Although the trail became harder to follow, Angut remained determined to find Nunaga.|"[""1.

"""I agree,"" replied Angut, as he knelt down and carefully inspected the marks on the ice. He immediately sprang up, leaped back onto the sled, cracked his whip fiercely, and sped off, forcing Rooney to tightly grip the sled's lashings. Old Kannoa followed suit, clinging to the sled with determination. Angut, driven by desperation, whipped the dogs relentlessly, hoping to catch sight of the fugitives beyond the cape.

As they rested in the darkness, they ate raw seal meat for sustenance. Despite its unappetizing taste, Angut knew its value. Rooney, grateful for any food, learned to eat when hungry.

The moon revealed a sheet of ice that worried Angut. Upon closer inspection, he returned with a troubled expression.

""We can't leave her behind,"" Angut said, eyeing Kannoa. ""She can't return alone. It's safer for her to continue with us.""

Their journey faced a setback when one of the sled's runners broke through the ice, causing a sudden stop. The sled plunged into the sea, with Angut and the dogs struggling in the water. Rooney managed to roll off the sled and save Kannoa, who had foreseen the mishap.

Together, they rescued Angut and the dogs. Despite the challenges, they managed to retrieve the sled and dry Angut's clothes. The frost had subsided, ensuring no harm from the icy plunge.

""It's futile,"" Angut admitted. """|"['1.

Seeing that they were determined, Angut made no more objections. He directed the dogs away from the shore, flourished his long whip over them, and set off at a break-neck pace over the ice towards the sea. After traveling swiftly for several days, the guilty man started to relax as he believed he had evaded any pursuers. He slowed down, allowing the dogs to rest and even took breaks to gather seal-flesh for his group. The thaw had not caused any open water yet, so the journey was smooth. However, Ujarak, though more relaxed, was still focused on their progress. One morning, they unexpectedly encountered a group of Eskimos traveling north. Ujarak hesitated, unsure of their next move. Eventually, the Eskimos spotted them, causing both fear and hope among Ujarak's party. Ujarak, claiming to be informed by his torngak, tried to deceive the Eskimos about their origins and intentions, but the matter-of-fact leader saw through the lies. Ujarak then fabricated a story about his tribe's whereabouts and their interest in trading with the Moravian settlers.|"['1.

Ujarak, despite a brief pause, remained resolute. He explained that Torngaks reveal information gradually, not all at once. He was instructed by his Torngak to leave his tribe and visit the Kablunets, revealing more details along the way. The wizard then diverted attention by asking about the distance to the Kablunets' land. Despite considering pursuit, the leader realized Ujarak's superiority and continued northward. The group camped each night, with Ujarak keeping to himself. On the third day, a sledge bar broke, prompting a stop. The wizard instructed the women to prepare food, with Kabelaw starting a fire and Nunaga setting up a lamp. The children eagerly helped, with Tumbler playfully commenting on Ujarak's demeanor. Despite the weather talk, Ujarak remained stern, mentioning the Moravians' mission to Greenland.|"['1.

The wizard's expression changed from a frown to a fierce glare, then to sadness, and finally settled into a sulky look that gradually faded away, leaving a blank expression. Just as he was about to speak, Nunaga, with wide eyes and mouth, let out a tremendous shriek that startled everyone, including the dogs. An enormous Polar bear, unaware of the humans nearby, casually strolled into view and sat down, seemingly admiring the Arctic landscape. When the bear stood up and turned towards Nunaga, chaos ensued as the dogs attacked. Ujarak quickly released the rest of the dogs, but the bear remained unfazed. Knowing that two Eskimo men armed with spears could defeat a Polar bear, Ujarak and Nunaga prepared to face the bear. Despite Kabelaw's initial attempt, the bear knocked the spear away, causing Kabelaw to fall and injure herself. Ujarak then attempted to strike the bear but failed to deliver a fatal blow.|"[""1.

The fall of Kabelaw made Nunaga brave but desperate. She jabbed the bear, and it turned on her in rage. As the bear fell on her, her spear pierced its heart, saving her and Ujarak. Despite the danger, Nunaga laughed and wept hysterically, then helped Ujarak. She showed mercy by tending to his injuries. Little Tumbler and Pussi assisted cheerfully. Meanwhile, Kabelaw suffered a concussion. Nunaga was shocked by her friend's condition and immediately tended to her.

When the full significance of her condition hit the poor girl, realizing she was alone in the Arctic wilderness caring for a helpless man, woman, and two children, she rose to the challenge, proving herself a true heroine. She harnessed the dogs, secured everyone on the sledge, and set off towards safety. Despite the pain, the wizard crawled onto the sledge, while Kabelaw could walk with support. Nunaga tied them down and attached the children to prevent jolting. At night, she cared for everyone, cooked seal and bear cutlets, and settled them in. As they journeyed, the ice melted under the sun's influence, leading them closer to safety.

As they couldn't go further with the dog sled, they had to wait for open water to use kayaks. Arbalik was sent to the village to bring back Nuna, Pussimek, Kunelik, Sigokow, and his mother in a boat. The men were glad to find a clear path to the village. They shared news of meeting Ujarak's sled, making waiting harder. They waited for Arbalik patiently. The brothers tried kayaking and raced back to shore. Ermigit overturned but quickly righted himself. Kayaks are long, narrow canoes covered in sealskin. They can be overturned but are safe in skilled hands. The brothers practiced maneuvers for emergencies. Norrak demonstrated leaning over and recovering, impressing onlookers.|"['1.

Ermigit and his brother Norrak were diligently training in their kayaks, preparing for the challenges of seal hunting. They practiced overturning and recovering their positions with their paddles in various entangled situations. Norrak demonstrated catching his paddle after purposely losing it during an upset, a critical skill to prevent drowning. The brothers also trained to navigate among rocks and waves, essential for skilled seal hunting.

By the time Norrak was in the water, he grabbed his brother's kayak and clutched the harpoon line, knowing that dead seals sink. Their friends and the Eskimos welcomed them warmly. They enjoyed a fresh meat supper and reminisced about battles. However, Angut, Simek, and Okiok were anxious about Nunaga, Pussi, and Tumbler. They pondered the Great Spirit's actions. Rooney discussed surgeons and the Great Father with Angut. They spotted Arbalik's kayak and oomiak approaching. The group gathered for a meal between supper and breakfast. The southern Eskimos continued north while the pursuers headed south by kayak. Angut, Okiok, and Simek led in kayaks, while others reluctantly paddled the women's boat.

In a short time, the group arrived near a massive iceberg, a colossal block of ice resembling a mountain. Its peaks towered hundreds of feet above the sea, with a base over a mile wide. Valleys and streams wound through the interior, cascading over cliffs. The iceberg looked like an island made of white sugar, sparkling in the sunlight against green-grey shadows and deep blue rifts. Suddenly, the surrounding ice pack began to crack and grind, causing panic. The lead of water narrowed rapidly, forcing the voyagers to leap onto ice masses as the opening closed, crushing their vessels. Seeking safety, they scrambled onto the iceberg, narrowly escaping disaster. Rooney, displaying calm leadership, guided the group to find shelter for the night, emphasizing trust in a higher power.

"Two members of the group were unable to relax and fall asleep easily. Red Rooney, with his knowledge of the dangerous Arctic seas, felt uneasy about their critical situation. Stranded on a melting iceberg miles away from land, surrounded by ice-filled waters, and lacking any means of escape, he couldn't shake off a sense of impending doom. Unable to sleep, he left the cave. ""It's a tough spot we're in,"" he confided to Angut. ""I fear we may not make it out."" Angut, reflecting on his family back home, shared his concerns. Despite the uncertainty, Angut held onto hope, guided by his belief in the Great Spirit's wisdom and goodness. Rooney found solace in this trust, pondering their chances of survival. Angut suggested one possibility: if the ice pack froze again, they could walk to safety. Though their pursuit of Ujarak might end, Angut remained hopeful, trusting in the mysteries of life and the wisdom of the Great Spirit."|"[""1.

Angut and Rooney, two men in a mysterious land, discuss the beliefs of the Innuit people. Angut shares that the Innuit think the earth is held up by pillars that are maintained by angekoks. They believe the earth rests on a mountain in the north and that stars are ancient Greenlanders or animals. The lights in the sky are thought to be the souls of the dead. Angut believes in the Great Spirit, seeing Him in all things. Despite their different beliefs, they acknowledge the wisdom of the Innuit in predicting the weather. The next morning, they wake to the sound of rushing water caused by increased warmth. Though initially cold, they find comfort in their youthful slumber.|['1.

Quietly stepping out, the man vigorously beat his arms to restore circulation. From an ice-ledge, he saw their situation was dire. The scene, beautiful apart from their plight, showed a changing sea with ice-islets of various shapes. The calm sea would have been ideal for their escape in kayaks. Rooney tried to distract Ippe from his toothache by pointing to the sea, but Ippe's indifference showed his familiarity with starvation and danger. Rooney devised a plan to cure Ippe's toothache by making him run to a jutting ice-cliff. Ippe ran back excitedly, having seen something unexpected. They lamented not having a weapon to hunt.

Upon returning to their dreary shelter, the group found the others stirring. Men were yawning and rubbing their eyes, while the women, with their usual energy and selflessness, gathered the remaining scraps of food. Without a word, Arbalik picked up some blubber and went outside to keep watch while having his simple breakfast. The rest sat on their bearskins, eating and discussing quickly. Their talk was futile as they were helpless, and the food was scarce. Yet, even as they finished the last bit, Rooney remarked that it was better than nothing. Angut suggested they confront the bear together to drive it away. Rooney advised caution, especially for the women to climb ice-cliffs out of the bear's reach. They cautiously peeked around the cliff and saw a massive white bear. Rooney realized the peril as the bear approached their location. Rooney, with determination, prepared to confront the bear alone, astonishing his friends with his boldness and skillful approach.|"['1.

Red Rooney displayed unexpected wisdom in his encounter with a bear on an iceberg. Realizing the urgency of the situation, he launched himself at the bear with all his might, causing the bear to tumble over the edge. The bear's descent down the ice slope was a chaotic whirlwind, shattering its bones. The Eskimos, amused by the spectacle, went to inspect the remains. Despite the lack of wood for a fire, they made the best of their situation by eating bear-chops raw. Okiok's idea of using the Eskimos' noses to create fire was dismissed, and they settled for an early supper to make use of the remaining daylight. The next day, they climbed to a high point on the iceberg to observe the weather and deduced they were drifting south against the surface currents due to the iceberg's deep underwater structure. Rooney's explanation, though complex, shed light on their peculiar situation.|"['1.

"""I have seen these icebergs breaking from the land-ice since I was a boy,"" said Angut with seriousness. ""Can Ridroonee tell where they go?"" A strong breeze blew from the north, turning into a gale with snow showers, forcing them into a cave. The cold made them huddle for warmth. The wind and ocean current pushed the iceberg southward. The blinding snow hid the land. As the pack-ice thickened, the berg ploughed through it. The Eskimos bundled up, preparing to leave. The berg grounded with a shock, sending ice falling. They hurried to the shore as the berg slid into the water. ""Just in time,"" said Rooney, as they watched it float away. The Eskimos and the sailor moved swiftly towards the shore, guided by a gleam of sunshine. Rooney carried old Kannoa when she couldn't walk anymore.

The stranger spoke in Danish, a language unfamiliar to the locals but not to Red Rooney, who had traveled to Scandinavian ports and learned Danish fluently. The stranger, a missionary to the Eskimos, sought refuge due to bad weather with five natives and an oomiak. They had been stranded for days without food. Rooney, offering bear meat, urged the stranger to eat before attending to the others. The stranger, revealed to be Hans Egede, founder of the Danish mission to Greenland, ate gratefully. Egede mentioned an injured man needing food. As they spoke, a young woman approached, caring for her injured father.

The missionary was surprised by a loud shout from his companion, Angut, who rushed past him to embrace a girl, showing great affection. As more friends reunited, the missionary couldn't help but smile. The Eskimo sisters, Kabelaw and Sigokow, joyfully danced and laughed together. Then, Pussi and Tumbler joined, reuniting with their loved ones. Ippegoo danced with joy around his mother. Eventually, they settled down to share sad news that Ujarak was dying. Angut knelt beside Ujarak, who revealed his newfound faith in Jesus. The missionary believed their meeting was part of God's plan for Ujarak's salvation.

The happiness from the unexpected gathering of friends and relatives was overshadowed by the sad yet peaceful passing of the wizard and the returning storm that had nearly been fatal. The brief respite from the weather was short-lived. The sky darkened, heavy snowfall limited visibility, and fierce winds forced them back into their snow-covered shelter. Ujarak was laid to rest under rocks due to the lack of tools for a proper burial. Okiok and his companions quickly built a simple snow hut for protection against the storm. Trapped for two more days, they listened to Hans Egede sharing stories of Jesus Christ with the northern natives. Hans Egede's journey to Greenland was met with skepticism and opposition, even from his own family. Despite the challenges, his unwavering determination and faith led him to pursue his mission as a missionary to Greenland.|['1.

Tired of waiting and feeling his cause lacked support, Hans Egede decided to take matters into his own hands. He left his post in 1718 and journeyed to Bergen, a port that once had a thriving trade with Greenland. Despite receiving little encouragement there, Egede saw hope in the possibility of peace after King Charles the Twelfth's sudden death. This led him to Copenhagen, where he personally presented his case to the College of Missions. The King promised to review his proposal. After much persistence, Egede managed to raise funds for a mission to Greenland. In 1721, he set sail with his family, becoming the first missionary to Greenland.

Egede, the missionary, spoke to the Eskimos about trusting the Great Spirit. He emphasized that even when prayers are not answered as expected, it is a sign of the Great Spirit's love. Angut, an Eskimo, was deeply affected by Egede's words and pondered the mysteries of the spiritual world. Egede explained that while God's actions are always right, humans with free will can choose to do wrong. This concept puzzled Angut, who grappled with the idea of free will. Despite the philosophical discussion, practical efforts were made to ensure the group's safety. The men checked the open water, and eventually, the whole party was safely relocated to the mainland.

Arbalik moved quickly towards Kajo as he grabbed a knife lying on the ground, his actions fueled by the effects of the drink. Kajo, in a state of temporary insanity, menaced poor old Kannoa with the knife. Red Rooney, filled with dread, was about to intervene when Ippegoo, with remarkable accuracy, threw a mass of turf at Kajo, saving the day. With the guidance of Hans Egede, Red Rooney, and Angut, Kajo was dealt a fair punishment, taken as a prisoner back to his people. His kayak was carried by the youths with great speed. Once at the beach, Kajo struggled to board his kayak, but with the help of Okiok and Angut, he was set afloat. The group observed the consequences of alcohol on Kajo and discussed its impact on people, reflecting on the dangers of excessive drinking.|"[""1.

"The idea involved helping a friend whose kayak was lost by having them lie flat on the deck of another kayak. The ""Rob Roy Canoe"" is similar to an Eskimo kayak but made of thin wood instead of sealskin. Both are long, narrow, decked over, and use a double-bladed paddle. To rescue a friend using these kayaks, they must lie flat while being paddled to safety. In the story, Okiok ensures Kajo stays still by pricking him with a spear. Later, they arrive at Kajo's tribe, where a murder had occurred due to excessive drinking. Mangek, a respected man, accidentally killed his wife while drunk, causing great sorrow and horror.

"Hans Egede was not afraid. He entered a poor man's hut, offering the remedy for sin and broken hearts. The groaning stopped as he prayed, leaving the natives in awe.

Egede confronted the accusers, pointing out their own faults. The old father of the murdered woman spoke, blaming the ""mad water"" for his daughter's death.

While the thieves were occupied, they unexpectedly encountered another ship, a Dutch vessel with some of its crew ashore in a boat. The Dutchmen, upon spotting the Eskimos, hastily returned to their boat, but the robbers signaled peace and left their weapons in the woods. Deceiving the Dutchmen, the Eskimos appeared unarmed and indicated a desire to trade. The sailors, lured in by the false display, were ambushed and attacked by the robbers. Unbeknownst to the robbers, some Eskimos, including Rooney, Angut, and Okiok, witnessed the treacherous act from a distance. They quickly devised a plan to warn their camp.
