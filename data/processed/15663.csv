"**Ancient Egypt: A Land of Mysteries**

Egypt's unique geography, shaped by the Nile River, divided the land into various regions. The Nile, often called ""the gift of the river,"" played a vital role in Egypt's fertility and communication. The annual inundation brought life to the land, and the Egyptians revered the river for its life-giving properties.

The Egyptians, with their distinct physical features and diverse characters, developed a rich culture and religion. Their polytheistic beliefs included worship of animals and the monarchy. The Osirid saga and the concept of an afterlife were central to their religious practices.

The early myths and legends of Egypt, such as the Seb and Thoth stories, shaped their understanding of the world. The construction of grand pyramids, like the Great Pyramid, reflected the Egyptians' architectural prowess and their beliefs about the afterlife.

"Ancient Egypt was like a lily with a unique shape. The Delta, stretching from Aboosir to Tineh, resembles a broad blossom at the top, while the Fayoum, a fertile area west of the Nile valley, is like a bud on the stalk. The Nile valley itself, a long ravine, is the stem of the lily, running for seven hundred miles. The Egyptians referred to their land as ""the two lands,"" representing the Delta and the Nile valley. The contrast between Lower Egypt (the Delta) and Upper Egypt (the Said) is stark. Lower Egypt is a vast plain, while Upper Egypt is a narrow valley with rocky hills. The Fayoum adds a third dimension to this division. This unique geography made Egypt hard to govern from a single center."|"['1.

The description of Egypt in ancient times differs from the Egypt we see on modern maps. While maps depict a large rectangular area in northeastern Africa bordered by the Mediterranean and Red Sea, the true Egypt is the Nile valley, the Fayoum, and the Delta. The vast deserts on either side of the Nile valley are not considered part of Egypt, even though they are sparsely inhabited by tribes different from the Egyptians. The Nile, often referred to as the gift of the river, played a crucial role in shaping Egypt's fertile lands. The Fayoum, a depression in the western desert, was transformed into a fertile region by channeling water from the Nile. The ancient Egyptians revered the Nile as a deity, attributing its life-giving waters to the prosperity of their land.|"['1.

The Nile River in Egypt is revered for its life-giving properties. Egyptians praise its importance and the cycle of gods it represents. Despite its muddy appearance due to soil deposits, the Nile is essential for Egypt's existence. It may not enhance the landscape's beauty, but its significance is unmatched. The Nile's vastness and dark hue from absorbed vegetation make it less picturesque, yet its value is immeasurable. Egypt, though small in size compared to European states, is incredibly rich and productive. The fertile land yields abundant crops like wheat, flax, and various vegetables, sustaining the population. Egypt's historical significance surpasses its size, much like other small but influential states in history. Egypt's prosperity and agricultural abundance make it a vital region in the ancient world.|"['1.

Egypt's unique geographical position provided it with significant advantages in ancient times. Unlike other nations, Egypt had access to both the Northern Sea and the Eastern Sea, offering valuable trade routes. While other civilizations like Phoenicia had to navigate harsh deserts for trade, Egypt could easily access the Mediterranean and Indian Ocean through the Red Sea. This strategic location allowed Egypt to trade with various regions, exchanging goods like corn, wine, and furniture for items from Greece, Italy, and even as far as India. Additionally, the Nile River served as a vital communication route, enabling rapid transport and fostering trade. Egypt's ability to navigate the Nile for commerce and communication set it apart from other civilizations, making it a hub for trade and cultural exchange.|"['1.

The geology of Egypt is uncomplicated. The whole flat land is alluvial. The hills on each side consist of limestone in the north, sandstone in the central area, and granite and syenite in the south. The granitic formation begins between the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth parallels, with some primitive rock intrusions reaching northward to lat. 27°10'. Above the rocks lie gravel and sand deposits, with some hard and some loose and shifting. Part of the eastern desert is rich in metals. Gold, copper, iron, and lead have been found, with emeralds near Mount Zabara, and other precious stones in the eastern desert. The flora is mainly dominated by dom and date palms, acacias, and the sycamore tree. Papyrus and lotus were also distinctive plants of Egypt. The ancient Egyptians used papyrus to make paper, while the lotus was a beautiful water-lily. Wildlife in ancient Egypt was limited due to the dense population. Gazelles were hunted with hawks and hounds, while crocodiles and hippopotamuses were also game for the ancient Egyptians. Fishing and fowling were common sports, with various waterfowl and fish abundant in the Nile and its canals.|['1.

Egypt is a land that may seem unchanging and flat, with its calm waters and vast green plains. The hills enclosing the Nile valley have flat tops and bare sides devoid of vegetation. The sky is usually clear without fog or rainstorms, and no colorful rainbows or shifting shadows adorn the landscape. However, nature and man have found ways to break this monotony. Twice a day, at sunrise and sunset, the sky and land are bathed in bright and delicate hues, transforming the ordinary scenery into a magical spectacle. The morning brings rosy streaks and a ruddy glow, while the evening enhances these effects with a deeper red glow and a moonlit night sky. Man has also contributed to Egypt's allure with colossal pyramids, statues, temples, and tombs that showcase audacious architectural feats. These massive structures have attracted visitors throughout the ages, adding a touch of grandeur to the otherwise tranquil landscape.|"[""1.

It is believed that the ancient Egyptians originated from Asia, but this is merely a guess. The physical appearance of the Egyptians was distinct from any known Asian group. While their language had some similarities to Semitic languages like Hebrew and Phoenician, their connection to Asia was weak. Instead, their physical features, language, and way of thinking were more closely related to the Nigritic type. The Egyptians were not black, but they shared certain characteristics with the black race. Over time, the Egyptian population became a blend of various ethnicities due to interactions with Ethiopians, Libyans, and Semites. Their physique varied, with some individuals having high foreheads, aquiline noses, and delicate chins, while others had low foreheads, thick lips, and heavy jaws. Despite these differences, Egyptians were generally slender with long limbs. In terms of character, the Egyptians were known for their serious and reflective nature, often contemplating the afterlife and showing a melancholic demeanor. Their focus on death and the transient nature of life was evident in their art, literature, and daily customs.|['1.

To truly understand a civilization, we must delve beyond their physical appearance and daily routines. It is their beliefs, thoughts, and fears that reveal their essence. Religion is a window into the character of a people. The Egyptian religion was a complex tapestry of deities, with temples adorned with rows of gods and goddesses. The Egyptians revered a multitude of gods, each with distinct forms and attributes. Some worshipped animals, considering them sacred and punishing those who harmed them. Cats, dogs, ibises, hawks, and even crocodiles were among the revered creatures. In Memphis, a sacred bull named Apis was believed to be the incarnation of the god Phthah, treated with utmost veneration.

"In ancient Egypt, they believed in multiple gods, some of which were incarnated in earthly forms. The Apis bull in Memphis, the Mnevis bull in Heliopolis, the Bacis bull in Hermonthis, and the white cow in Momemphis were all revered as gods. The Egyptians even considered their king as an actual incarnation of the sun god Ra, referring to him as ""the living Horus."" Courtiers and ambassadors would bow down in adoration before the king, attributing their lives and successes to his divine favor. The Osirid saga, a popular myth, told the story of Osiris, a benevolent king betrayed by his wicked brother Set, and avenged by his son Horus.

"Ancient Egyptian religion had gods like Set, Taour, Bes, and Apep, representing evil forces. However, the priests and educated believed in a single divine being, the creator of all, perfect in wisdom, power, and goodness. They saw the other gods as aspects of this supreme being or parts of nature inspired by him. The afterlife was a key belief, with souls judged by Osiris and 42 assessors in the ""Hall of Truth."" Good deeds were weighed against a figure of Truth, determining the soul's fate in the afterlife. Those with more good deeds entered paradise, while those with less faced transmigrations into animals for purification.

The Egyptians had a moral code that emphasized love for God, virtue, and humanity. Epitaphs reveal their pride in being benefactors. However, their moral standard lacked humility and purity. They tolerated and even defended incest, depicting it in religious sculptures. Indecency was prevalent in their religious festivals, including phallic orgies. Despite boasting of virtues on their tombs, actions often contradicted these claims. Kings bragged about killing prisoners and engaged in licentious behavior. A society of thieves, even including priests, plundered royal tombs. Social hierarchy was rigid, with nobles, officials, and a respected literary class looking down on common people, artisans, and traders.|['1.

In ancient Egypt, the population was divided into three main classes. The upper classes included nobles and priests who held esteemed positions in society. Below them were the craftsmen and artisans who worked in various trades such as weaving, metalworking, and pottery. The lowest class consisted of laborers who toiled on farms, in fishing, or as boatmen. Despite the social hierarchy, there was no strict caste system in Egypt. Sons were often trained in their fathers' professions but had the opportunity to pursue education and rise through merit. The literary life was highly regarded and could lead to prestigious government positions.

They wore a short gown or petticoat held up by two broad straps over their shoulders, exposing their arms and feet. Women were not secluded; they actively participated in various activities alongside their husbands. While their representation in art was often smaller than their husbands, they were considered equals in many aspects. Women were entombed with care and respect similar to men.

"In ancient times, Egypt was governed from a city located at the junction of the narrow Nile valley and the wide Delta plain, a place similar to modern Cairo. However, a shift in power occurred, leading to the fragmentation of Egypt into separate kingdoms ruled by different dynasties. This disruption resulted in weakness and decline. The city of Thebes, situated about 350 miles from the old capital, emerged as a new power center. The location of Thebes, with its fertile green plain surrounded by mountains and desert, made it ideal for trade. The city had its own unique characteristics, distinct from Northern Egypt. The Thebans, under King Antef, claimed dominion over the entire country, although their rule likely extended only to certain regions. Antef was succeeded by Mentu-hotep I and then by Antef-aa, known as ""Antef the Great,"" who was depicted with his beloved hunting dogs on his sepulchral monument."|"['1.

During the time of the hunter king, Antef the Great, and other rulers like Mentu-hoteps, Thebes in Egypt flourished. While these kings may not have left a significant mark on history, they focused on advancing their country's prosperity. They undertook projects like sinking wells in the valley of Hammamât to support trade caravans and military posts to protect quarries and trade routes. Later, King Sankh-ka-ra launched a fleet to establish trade with the land of Punt. Following these rulers, the Usurtasen and Amenemhat dynasty brought a new era where the welfare of the people was a priority. They engaged in practical projects like building wells, roads, and fortresses, promoting commerce, and enhancing agriculture. These rulers, such as Amenemhat I, not only stabilized the country but also engaged in defensive wars to protect the borders.

During the reign of Usurtasen II, a group of Semitic immigrants from Asia arrived in Egypt seeking refuge under the protection of the king. Led by their prince Abusha, the Amu group presented themselves before the noble Khnum-hotep, offering a mineral called mastemut as a gift. The scene depicted the foreigners dressed in colorful garments, armed with bows, arrows, and spears. The women wore fillets and anklets, accompanied by children and a boy playing a lyre. The noble Khnum-hotep received them with his scribe Nefer-hotep recording the event. The arrival of the Amu tribe was seen as a significant event, although it was not related to the biblical account of Jacob's family entering Egypt. Usurtasen II's reign was marked by military conquests, notably against the land of Cush, where he established forts to control the movement of the black races.

Usurtasen, an ancient Egyptian hero, expanded Egypt's borders southward by 150 miles, reaching beyond the First Cataract to above the Second Cataract. The boundary drawn by Usurtasen between Egypt and Ethiopia mirrored the one established by the British Government in 1885 between Egypt and the Sudan. This boundary, though somewhat artificial due to the course of the great river, was considered convenient between Assouan (Syene) and Khartoum. Usurtasen's conquests elevated him to legendary status in the Old Empire, with myths embellishing his feats. The Nile River, Egypt's lifeblood, brings both blessings and dangers. Its annual flood, predictable and enriching, ensures fertility by spreading nutrient-rich alluvium over the land. However, rare events like excessive rainfall in Abyssinia can lead to catastrophic floods, while droughts can result in famine. The Nile's fluctuations have historically impacted Egypt, with periods of abundance and scarcity shaping the nation's history.|"[""1.

During Amenemhat's reign, he faced the challenge of water scarcity in Egypt, which affected his people. To address this issue, he devised a system to prevent water wastage and ensure efficient water usage for irrigation. In regions where water supply is limited, it is crucial to maximize the use of available water resources. Nature often provides more water than needed, but human negligence can lead to waste. Amenemhat's solution involved creating a canal from the Nile to a depression in the Libyan hills, allowing controlled access to water for cultivation. This innovative approach demonstrated the importance of prudent water management to meet agricultural needs. The exact size and structure of Amenemhat's reservoir are still debated among scholars, highlighting the historical significance and mystery surrounding this ancient engineering feat.|"['1.

Abraham faced a severe famine in Canaan and decided to lead his people towards Egypt to seek relief. Traveling through the desert with an organized caravan, including animals and provisions, they faced challenges like dwindling water and tired camels. However, the sight of Egypt's lush fields and the Nile brought them immense joy and relief. As they neared the Egyptian border, Abraham feared for his safety due to the Pharaoh's reputation for taking beautiful women. To protect himself, he asked his wife, Sarah, to pretend to be his sister. The Pharaoh, impressed by Sarah's beauty, took her into his household and treated Abraham well. Abraham thrived in Egypt, receiving gifts of livestock and riches from the Pharaoh, living peacefully in the city of On.

Long ago, a significant event occurred in the royal palace, likely a tragedy such as illness or death. The king believed he faced divine punishment and sought the reason for his suffering. Some believed the priests revealed the truth, accusing the king of taking another man's wife. Alternatively, Sarah may have confessed. The Pharaoh, upon learning the truth, confronted Abraham and instructed him to leave with his wife and possessions. Abraham's stay in Egypt, during a period between the eleventh and thirteenth dynasties, marked a significant chapter. Egypt had seen previous Semitic immigrants seeking refuge in its fertile lands. The influx of Semitic wanderers gradually influenced Egypt's culture and language. The peaceful nation was soon to face challenges from the east, with movements across Asia threatening global peace. The Hittites' expansion and Elam's military actions were among the early signs of a changing world.|"['1.

Only one account exists of the invasion that led to Egypt falling under foreign rule. According to the historian Manetho, as relayed by Josephus, a king named Timæus ruled Egypt when ignoble men from the east invaded due to divine displeasure. They easily conquered the land, enslaved and killed many, destroyed temples, and established Salatis as their king. Salatis fortified the land against Assyrian threats, rebuilding and garrisoning the city of Avaris. The invaders, known as Menti or Sati, were a mix of various races seeking wealth and settlement. Egypt, divided and unable to field an army, succumbed to the overwhelming force without a battle. The conquerors iconoclastically destroyed temples and statues, erasing Egypt's existing civilization. The devastation was so severe that few monuments from that time remain, leaving a void in Egypt's historical record.|"['1.

Fortunately, not the whole country was taken over. It seems that the Hyksôs only occupied certain areas of Egypt, like the Delta, the Lower Nile valley, and the Fayoum district. Cities like Elephantine, Thebes, and Abydos were spared. Even though they had to show submission to the Hyksôs, pay tribute, and acknowledge their rule, these cities maintained some independence. The monuments in Thebes from the eleventh and twelfth dynasties were unharmed. Structures in Lower Egypt that were not significant or too sturdy were left untouched. The pyramids were mostly unscathed, although their sanctity might have been violated. The obelisk of Usurtasen I in Heliopolis remained standing. The smaller tombs at Ghizeh were largely undisturbed. Egyptian civilization faced a setback but managed to recover and even surpass its former glory after the invasion.|['1.

"The ""Shepherds"" introduced the worship of Sut or Sutekh into Egypt, associating him with the sun. He was hailed as the ""great ruler of heaven"" and linked to Baal later on. The kings believed he protected them. Initially, they saw no special ties between this deity and Egyptian gods, leading to attacks on Egyptian temples. Over time, they connected Sutekh to the Egyptian god Set, a symbol of physical evil. Apepi, a notable ""Shepherd"" king, built a grand temple for Sutekh at Tanis. Meanwhile, peaceful Apepi's demands on Thebes led to conflict with Taa-ken, who resisted Apepi's demands to worship only Amen-Ra. Taa-ken's defiance set the stage for a confrontation with Apepi's successor, Aahmes. Tradition suggests Apepi may have been the pharaoh who appointed Joseph as prime minister, aligning with the era of chariots and foreign rule."|"['1.

"If we consider Joseph under the rule of one of the ""Shepherd Kings,"" it is plausible to connect him with Apepi. Apepi, a ruler over all of Egypt like Joseph's Pharaoh, worshipped a single god. He was fully integrated into Egyptian culture, with a court of learned scribes and a peaceful reign. Apepi resided in the Delta, either at Tanis or Auaris. He was known for his strong will and carried out changes decisively. The transition from the Hyksôs rule after two centuries or so was relatively smooth due to the conquerors' decline from their once dominant state. The conquered people in Upper Egypt maintained their own administration and culture, paying tribute but retaining self-respect. Ra-Sekenen III, an Upper Egyptian prince, had built a powerful military, leading to tensions with Apepi. The reluctance of Ra-Sekenen to engage in conflict showcases the shift in power dynamics over time."|"['1.

It appears that Apepi, the ruler, was compelled to take up arms eventually. Unfortunately, we lack a detailed account of the ensuing war led by this king. Apepi's hopes of crushing the growing native power were dashed as Ra-Sekenen, defending against Apepi's aggression, raised the banner of national independence. He called for aid from across Egypt, amassing a sizable army. Initially, Ra-Sekenen held his ground against Apepi, gradually gaining momentum. The Hyksôs, marching towards Thebes, faced opposition from native chiefs in various cities. Over time, they lost ground, surrendering the Fayoum, Memphis, and eventually Tanis. Their last stronghold was Uar or Auaris, a well-fortified camp. Ra-Sekenen's death marked the rise of Aahmes, a king from a different lineage, who was determined to drive the Hyksôs beyond Egypt's borders. Aahmes mobilized a massive force and deployed a fleet on the Nile to aid in the liberation. Auaris, defended by moats and water bodies, required a combined land and water attack. Aahmes led the land forces personally, while his namesake oversaw the fleet. After a prolonged siege, the defenders succumbed to panic, fleeing towards Syria.

In his thirty-third year, Thothmes III embarked on a remarkable expedition. Starting from the Rutennu region, he led a force into Mesopotamia, ravaging towns and reducing Naharaïn to submission. He captured thirty kings and erected tablets to mark his conquest. Thothmes possibly even reached Adiabene or the Zab country, passing through Ni, believed to be Nineveh. Although Nineveh was not the capital of Assyria at the time, it was under Assyrian rule. The Assyrian king avoided conflict by sending envoys with gifts, acknowledging Thothmes as a superior military power. Thothmes extended Egyptian territory east of the Euphrates, adding valuable land and establishing garrisons. The Assyrians sought peace through annual tributes, including gold, silver, slaves, and exotic goods. Thothmes also hunted elephants during the expedition, with one incident where his life was saved by an officer. Subsequent campaigns targeted rebellious regions in Phoenicia and Mesopotamia but did not surpass the achievements of the initial campaign.|"[""1.

During his reign, the king of Egypt expanded his empire to the north and northeast while also maintaining control over regions influenced by previous rulers. He collected tribute from various lands, including gold, spices, slaves, cattle, ivory, ebony, and more. The king brought back captives, chariots, horses, cattle, goats, silver, and gold. He also imported corn, wine, incense, furniture, statues, and exotic animals like birds and monkeys. The monarch was curious about new discoveries and had artists document everything he found, intending to share these wonders with his people. He even maintained a naval force and used it in his military campaigns. While some claim he voyaged to distant lands, historical evidence suggests his expeditions were mainly focused on regions closer to Egypt.|"['1.

Thothmes III was not only a great conqueror but also a remarkable builder and supporter of art in ancient Egypt. One of his notable projects was the grand temple of Ammon at Thebes, where he carefully restored and beautified the edifice. He rebuilt the central sanctuary in granite to ensure its longevity, preserving the original design while enhancing its durability. Thothmes III also constructed a magnificent hall behind the temple, a structure of unprecedented size for its time. In addition to these accomplishments, he added propylaea to the temple's south and erected impressive obelisks in front of the entrance. These obelisks, including one towering over a hundred feet tall, still stand today as testaments to his architectural prowess. Thothmes III's legacy includes numerous temples and monuments across Egypt and Nubia, showcasing his enduring impact on ancient architecture. His monumental works can be found in cities like Rome, Constantinople, London, and even New York, where they continue to inspire awe and admiration for Egyptian engineering and artistry.|"[""1.

Thothmes III, an Egyptian ruler, is sometimes likened to Alexander the Great, but this comparison is exaggerated. Thothmes was a skilled conqueror, yet his achievements were minor compared to Alexander's vast empire. While Thothmes conquered Syria and Upper Mesopotamia, Alexander ruled from the Aegean to the Sutlej, establishing a dynasty lasting centuries. Alexander's administrative abilities surpassed Thothmes', who left a disorganized empire that rebelled posthumously. Thothmes' physical appearance was unremarkable, with a serious expression. He died after a 54-year reign, aged around 60. Meanwhile, the Israelites thrived in Goshen under Thothmes, protected by Joseph's legacy. Thothmes' son, Amenhotep, continued his military legacy, subduing nations and engaging in brutal warfare. Despite his victories, his barbaric practices tainted his reputation.|"[""1.

"Amenophis II had a short reign, with his seventh year being the last noted on his monuments. His temple at Amada, a hall at Thebes, and his tomb at Abd-el-Qurnah were his main constructions, although none were particularly remarkable. Egypt had a brief period of peace under his rule before embarking on new military and architectural endeavors. Amen-hotep the Third, grandson of Thothmes, is famous for the Twin Colossi, colossal statues over 60 feet high, made of a single block of sandstone. These statues, created by a sculptor named Amenhotep, have sat for over three thousand years, emanating a sense of sublime tranquility. One of the statues, known as ""The Vocal Memnon,"" emitted a mysterious musical sound in the early morning, considered a miraculous event by many.

The ancient statue of Memnon once emitted a mysterious musical sound that puzzled many. Strabo, an early witness, noted the phenomenon around 25 B.C. The sound ceased after an earthquake in 27 B.C. damaged the statue. Restored in A.D. 174, the musical tone vanished, likely due to the change in the stone's condition. This occurrence is similar to sounds from rocks in other parts of the world, like the granite rocks along the Oronooko River. These sounds are believed to result from temperature changes. Even quarried blocks, like those in the palace-temple of Karnak, have been known to create similar sounds. The mystery of the singing statue of Memnon remains a fascinating scientific and historical enigma.|['1.

In summary, Amenhotep III was an eminent builder in ancient Egypt, known for constructing grand temple-palaces. One of his remarkable creations is the Luxor Temple, showcasing his architectural prowess. The temple, though partly attributed to Rameses II, reflects Amenhotep's eminence. It features colossal statues, obelisks, and a pillared hall. Amenhotep also built temples dedicated to Ammon and Maut at Karnak and shrines in Nubia and the Sinai Peninsula. While he excelled in architecture, his military campaigns in Syria and Mesopotamia were more for tribute collection than expansion. He focused his military efforts on raids into Ethiopia, capturing valuable slaves. Despite his limited military achievements, Amenhotep III's legacy as a builder remains significant in Egyptian history.|"['1.

"Amenhotep III, an ancient Egyptian pharaoh, enjoyed hunting lions when not hunting men. He claimed to have killed 110 lions between his first and tenth year. He even gifted live lions to the priests at the temple of Karnak. Lions were symbolic in Egyptian religion, representing Horus and Turn. Amenhotep III was known for his kindness and generosity. Upon his death, his son Amenhotep IV, influenced by his foreign mother Tii, introduced a new religion called ""Disk-worship."" This religion focused on the sun god Aten. It remains unclear if this was pure sun-worship or a form of monotheism. The ""Disk-worshippers"" faced opposition and were eventually replaced by traditional beliefs.

"The dislike of the ""Disk-worshippers"" towards the old Egyptian religion was evident in several ways. Firstly, the new king changed his name from Amenhotep to Khu-en-Aten to distance himself from the old deity Amen and align with the new god Aten. Secondly, he erased the name of Ammon from monuments. Thirdly, he relocated the capital to Tel-el-Amarna, where only Aten was worshipped. However, the animosity was not universal. The king still honored the sun god Harmachis and even built an obelisk for him. The queen mother, Tii, likely influenced the religious revolution due to her foreign background and blue-eyed, fair appearance. She introduced her ""disk-worship"" religion during her husband's reign and continued it when her son, Amenhotep IV, came to power. The king, influenced by his mother, further promoted the new religion, changed court customs, and enforced a display of submission among officials.

Saplal's power and his threatening stance near Egypt's northeastern border sparked jealousy from Ramesses I, Seti's father. To defend themselves, Ramesses chose to attack. In the first or second year of his reign, he invaded the enemy's territory, claiming rightful ownership of Palestine, Syria, and Western Mesopotamia. This led to a confrontation between Ramesses and Saplal, resulting in an inconclusive battle. Eventually, peace was established, and a formal alliance was formed, though the treaty's specific terms remain unknown. The next chapter saw Seti-Menephthah I of Egypt and Mautenar of the Hittite kingdom, the grandsons of their predecessors, facing each other as young rulers. Despite a treaty of friendship, war erupted as Seti initiated an unexpected attack, swiftly advancing into Syria and engaging in battles to secure victory.

The temporary isolation of the king, depicted in the heroic poem of Pentaour and recorded by Ramesses on the walls of his grand structures, likely lasted only a few minutes. Though it may have felt like hours to him, there was time for him to achieve remarkable feats. When his companions realized he was missing, they frantically searched for him, breaking through the Hittite chariot line to rescue their sovereign. The Hittite army suffered heavy losses, including key figures like Grabatasa and Tarakennas. Despite his victory at Kadesh, Ramesses failed to fully defeat the Hittites. Eventually, he made peace with Khitasir, cementing their alliance through a marriage agreement.

Seti, an ancient Egyptian ruler, is known for constructing magnificent palaces and tombs. While the pyramids impress with their sheer size and engineering, Seti's rock-tomb stands out for its complexity and beauty. The rock-tomb is a series of chambers, corridors, and halls adorned with intricate paintings depicting scenes of gods, genii, and processions. As one progresses deeper into the tomb, they encounter a variety of detailed artwork, including serpents, mummies, and mythological figures. At the heart of the tomb lies an alabaster sarcophagus surrounded by elaborate decorations. In contrast, Ramesses, another notable king, is remembered for colossal statues of himself that adorn the rock-temple of Ipsambul. These statues, each seventy feet tall, exude a sense of majesty and grandeur, reflecting the king's vanity. Ramesses was a prolific builder, using forced labor to construct his monuments, which may have involved foreign workers.

The faces of Seti I and Ramesses II, as shown in sculptures, present a striking contrast. Seti's features are distinctly African, with a strong, fierce look, while Ramesses has more Asiatic traits. Seti's face is characterized by a thick-lipped, prognathous structure, whereas Ramesses boasts a well-formed nose, thoughtful eyes, and a delicate chin. Seti is believed to be of pure Egyptian descent with some southern influences, while Ramesses, born to a Semitic mother, inherited Asiatic characteristics. Despite being a great warrior like his father, Ramesses had a more peaceful and sensitive nature. His reign, marked by feats of peace like building the Great Wall and a canal to the Red Sea, lasted 67 years. Menephthah, Ramesses II's successor, had a weak and treacherous character. His reign, initially peaceful, was marred by invasions and internal rebellions, leading to Egypt's decline.|"['1.

The leader of the alliance was an African prince named Marmaiu, who hailed from Africa and was the son of Deid. Marmaiu planned a serious attack on Egypt not for looting but for conquering. Initially, he gathered his local forces from Lubu, Tahennu, Mashuash, Kahaka, totaling around 25,000 to 30,000 men. Subsequently, he enlisted additional troops from five other nations, possibly raising his army to 35,000 to 40,000 soldiers. These foreign auxiliaries were from Akausha, Luku, Tursha, Shartana or Shardana, and Sheklusha. Modern historians link these nations to the Achaeans, Laconians, Tyrsenians, Sardinians, and Sicilians. This alliance attempted to invade Egypt, challenging the Pharaoh's authority. The attack was fierce, causing havoc and destruction in Egypt. Ultimately, Menephthah, the Egyptian ruler, managed to defeat the invaders in a significant battle at Prosopis, despite not personally leading his troops into combat.|"[""1.

The defeat of Prosopis was conclusive. Marmaiu lost between eight and nine thousand soldiers, with another estimate suggesting twelve to thirteen thousand casualties. Over nine thousand were captured, along with their tents, equipment, and cattle. The expedition disbanded, and Marmaiu returned home with a weakened army, avoiding further conflict with the Egyptians. The mercenaries learned to stay out of Libyan battles. The Akaiusha and Luku vanished from Egyptian records. The Tursha and Sheklusha remained as foes. The Shartana joined the Egyptian forces after admiring their valor. Menephthah falsely claimed credit for the victory. Moses likely returned to Egypt soon after Ramesses II's death and demanded freedom for the Israelites.

During the reign of King Menephthah, the Israelites found themselves trapped between high mountains and the Red Sea. The king, eager to reclaim them as bondsmen, mobilized his troops, including over 600 chariots, to pursue the fleeing Israelites. However, as the Egyptians advanced, a miraculous event unfolded. The waters of the Red Sea receded, allowing the Israelites to cross safely to the other side. When the Egyptian forces followed, disaster struck. The sea returned, drowning the pursuing troops and thwarting the king's plans. This defeat led to chaos and civil unrest in Egypt, with a pretender challenging the throne. Despite this turmoil, the architectural achievements of the time, like the grand hall of Seti at Karnak, stood as a testament to the Egyptians' mastery in building and design, showcasing their skill and creativity in creating monumental structures.|"['1.

Even passion exhausts itself eventually, and the arm tires of fighting. After the great battle, the Egyptians eased their extreme hostility. They captured many Libyans, branded them, and forced them to serve on Egyptian ships. Important Libyan leaders were imprisoned. Women and children became slaves, cattle was given to Ammon at Thebes. Ramesses had military success but faced new enemies from Europe and Asia Minor. Seven nations united to attack Egypt from Syria and Palestine.

The threat was only halfway resolved as the snake was wounded but not vanquished. The enemy's fleet remained strong, poised to unleash chaos upon the Egyptian lands. The Tânauna and their allies, Sheklusha, Shartana, and Tursha, swiftly headed for the closest Nile mouth, Pelusiac, aiming to invade. Ramesses' strategic preparations paid off as his navy intercepted the enemy at Pelusiac lagoon. The fierce battle that ensued, depicted in Ramesses' sculptures, showcased a sea-fight with ships using both sails and oars. Ramesses, leading his land force, repelled the invaders, preventing their landing. Despite initial success, the invaders were thwarted, their vessels overturned, and their troops decimated. Ramesses, likening himself to the war god Mentu, emerged victorious, ensuring Egypt's safety.

In ancient Egypt, priests held a position of great importance and power. While not a formal caste, they were a distinct class with unique privileges and lifestyles. The priests were mainly chosen from their own families and were supported by vast amounts of land granted to them. These lands, often attached to temples, were exempt from taxes and received continuous gifts from kings. The priests were highly respected by the rulers, who recognized the priests' influence over the gods. The head priests, like the High-Priest of Ammon at Thebes, held significant authority and were revered by both the king and the people. Over time, the position of high priest became hereditary, with successors inheriting the role from their fathers. This led to the priests accumulating power and influence, sometimes even surpassing that of the king.|"['1.

In ancient times, the name Ethiopia referred to the East African region south of Egypt, from approximately lat. 24° to lat. 9°. This area was mostly desert with oases but had a valuable strip of land along the Nile. Further south, it expanded into a fertile region with streams, mountains, and minerals. The region was divided among many tribes, some herdsmen, others hunters or fishermen, often at war. The Egyptians called them Kashi or Kushi, related to the Hebrew Cush or Cushi. The Ethiopians near Egypt were influenced by the Egyptians, with wars and Egyptian civilization penetrating the region. The descendants of Herhor moved to Ethiopia, where they were welcomed, adopted Egyptian customs, and ruled as Ethiopian monarchs. Napata flourished with Egyptianized temples and pyramids, wealth from mines, woods, and trade with the interior tribes for ivory and ostrich feathers.|['1.

During Piankhi's rule, he gradually expanded his authority over other kings, making them his tributaries. It is unclear if he used force, but fear of the advancing Assyrians may have led the princes to seek Piankhi's protection. When the king of Memphis, Tafnekht, rebelled, Piankhi sent troops to suppress the revolt. A fierce battle ensued, leading to the defeat of the rebel chiefs. Namrut, a Hermopolitan monarch, reclaimed his city from Piankhi's forces, prompting Piankhi to take action. He laid siege to Hermopolis, eventually forcing Namrut to surrender. Piankhi then marched north, receiving the submission of various cities. Despite resistance from Memphis, Piankhi attacked fiercely, scaling the walls and taking the city.

In 720 B.C., a significant clash occurred between the Assyrian forces led by Sargon and the Egyptian and Ethiopian troops commanded by Shabak and Hanun. The battle took place at Ropeh, near the desert borders. Despite a fierce fight, the Assyrians emerged victorious due to their superior strength and discipline. Following the battle, negotiations ensued, leading to a convention sealed by the Ethiopian and Assyrian rulers. Subsequently, in 712 B.C., Shabak passed away, succeeded by his son Shabatok in Egypt and Tehrak in Ethiopia. Assyrian aggression persisted, with Sargon's successor, Sennacherib, facing rebellions in Phoenicia and Philistia. Hezekiah of Judah joined the opposition, seeking aid from Egypt. Sennacherib's forces clashed with the combined Egyptian and Ethiopian troops near Eltekeh in 701 B.C., resulting in a decisive Assyrian victory. However, a mysterious catastrophe befell Sennacherib's army, leading to its near-total destruction, granting Egypt and Ethiopia a respite.|"['1.

Tirhakah, the Ethiopian ruler, had a remarkable reign. He was seen as a protector by Judea and held influence over Syria and Africa. Tirhakah subdued tribes in Africa and even reached the Pillars of Hercules. His military prowess is depicted in monuments at various sites. Despite his early successes, later in his life, he faced setbacks. His son Esarhaddon succeeded him and resumed the conquest of Egypt. Esarhaddon's army marched through the desert, aided by Arab Sheikhs, to face Tirhakah's forces near Memphis. In the ensuing battle, the Assyrians, with their superior equipment and training, defeated Tirhakah's army. Memphis was besieged, looted, and many captives were taken.

After conquering Egypt, the Assyrians organized the territory by dividing it into twenty regions, each ruled by a governor and guarded by an Assyrian garrison. Most governors were Egyptians, but some were Assyrians. The conqueror, satisfied with the arrangement, returned to Nineveh, leaving behind a record of his conquests. Egypt remained under Assyrian control for about three to four years. However, the struggle resumed when Tehrak, taking advantage of Esarhaddon's illness, reclaimed the disputed territory. Religious ties between Ethiopia and Egypt aided Tehrak, but physical force ultimately determined the outcome. Assyria swiftly responded, defeating Tehrak and reclaiming Egypt. The conflict continued as Egyptian kings plotted against Assyrian rule, leading to arrests and uprisings.

After the death of the warrior-king, Ethiopia surprised everyone by not giving up the fight for Egypt. Rut-Ammon, the new Ethiopian ruler, continued the battle with vigor. The Ethiopian army defeated the Egyptian and Assyrian forces, captured Thebes, and took control of most of the Delta. The Assyrians retaliated, defeated Rut-Ammon, and seized Egypt. Mi-Ammon-Nut, the new Ethiopian king, tried to win over the Egyptians by showing respect for their religion. He marched down the Nile, restoring temples and honoring the gods. The Egyptians welcomed him, and even those planning to resist changed their minds. Mi-Ammon-Nut defeated the Assyrians at Memphis, and the princes of Lower Egypt submitted to him. However, his rule was short-lived, and Egypt returned to being under Assyrian control. The constant wars had left Egypt devastated, but a period of revival would soon follow.|"[""1.

"In ancient Egypt, when the nation was in a deep decline, a savior was needed to bring about its revival. This savior had to be both from within and without the nation. Psamatik, the son of Neco, emerged as this figure. He was of Libyan descent but had intermarried with Egyptians, making him a unique blend of both cultures. Psamatik had been part of the Egyptian political system for over twenty years and had a deep understanding of the nation's circumstances and history. When Assyria faced difficulties, Psamatik saw an opportunity to free Egypt from its control. He sought an alliance with Gyges of Lydia, who sent troops to support Psamatik's cause.

During Psamatik's reign, Egypt flourished with bustling cities, abundant harvests, and a growing population. Psamatik's use of Greek and Carian mercenaries led to closer ties with foreigners, a departure from Egypt's traditional isolationist stance. Psamatik allowed foreign ships to enter Egyptian ports, invited Greeks to settle in the Delta, and encouraged trade between Egypt and Greece. The exchange of goods like Greek wines and Egyptian corn flourished, along with the introduction of Greek art and culture. However, these changes unsettled Egyptian society, leading to the adoption of foreign superstitions and a decline in traditional values. Psamatik's reign coincided with turmoil in Asia, but his military ventures were limited, focusing more on maintaining stability within Egypt. His son, Neco, would later inherit a more complicated political landscape.|"[""1.

Neco, the son of Psamatik I., took the throne with a bold plan for empire. He focused on building a strong navy, modernizing it with the Greek-designed triremes. Neco aimed to unite his fleets by reopening the Nile-Red Sea canal. Despite facing challenges like labourer mortality, he didn't give up. He then sent Phoenician sailors to circumnavigate Africa, hoping to connect the Mediterranean and Red Sea. The journey, a great success, led to the discovery of a route around Africa. However, due to the long duration of the voyage, it didn't serve his immediate military goals. Undeterred, Neco marched his army towards Syria, encountering resistance from Josiah near Megiddo. Neco's forces defeated Josiah, enabling him to conquer Syria up to Carchemish on the Euphrates. After a triumphant campaign, Neco returned home, having established his power in the region.|"[""1.

For three years, Egypt was triumphant, feeling powerful once again. However, Nemesis struck. In 605 B.C., Nabopolassar of Babylon, seeking to regain prestige, sent his son Nebuchadnezzar to Syria to reclaim lost territories. Neco of Egypt faced him at the Euphrates, resulting in a devastating defeat for Egypt at Carchemish. Jeremiah vividly described the battle. Egypt's defeat was total, prompting a hasty retreat. Neco abandoned Syria and Palestine, fleeing back to Egypt as Nebuchadnezzar had to rush back to Babylon due to his father's death. This marked the end of Egypt's aspirations for an Asiatic Empire. Despite this defeat, Egypt's art, architecture, and prosperity continued under Psamatik II, with notable contributions from Apries and Amasis, who enhanced temples and supported the arts, making Egypt flourish economically and culturally during his reign.|"[""1.

In military terms, there was a partial recovery after the defeat at Carchemish. Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian ruler, faced challenges consolidating his empire. Regions like Elam, Asia Minor, Phœnicia, and Palestine needed attention before expanding further. Judæa rebelled against Babylon within three years, with Phœnicia following suit later. Nebuchadnezzar swiftly subdued Judæa but struggled with Tyre's defiance. It took thirteen years to reclaim Phœnicia. Meanwhile, Egypt under Psamatik II stayed peaceful, focusing on internal affairs. Apries, Neco's successor, attempted to aid Judah against Babylon but faced defeat. Jerusalem fell in 586 BC, leading to Zedekiah's capture and the city's destruction. Apries tried to strengthen his empire by securing Phœnician support but faced setbacks, losing favor with his people. Ultimately, Babylon and Egypt neared a collision, with Apries's reign ending in turmoil.|"['1.

"In the year 568 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar led an expedition into Egypt during the reign of Apries. Amasis succeeded Apries and directly opposed Nebuchadnezzar in battle while Apries stayed in the palace at Saïs. Nebuchadnezzar and Amasis ruled jointly from 571 B.C. to 565 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar first targeted Memphis and Thebes after bypassing Saïs, then moved towards Elephantine and attempted to advance into Nubia. Facing resistance from Nes-Hor in the South, Nebuchadnezzar abandoned his Nubian conquest. He later ravaged Egypt, taking Saïs in 565 B.C. and executing Apries. Despite being termed a ""base kingdom,"" Egypt flourished under Amasis. The era was marked by abundant crops and prosperity, fostering private industry and commerce due to improved state finances.

The subjugation of Egypt by Babylon in 565 B.C. was not oppressive. Egypt paid a small tribute to Babylon but was not interfered with internally. When a new power, Persia under Cyrus, emerged in 558 B.C., Amasis of Egypt faced a decision. Lydia's Croesus proposed an alliance against Persia. Amasis, aware of Babylon's weakened state, joined the alliance. However, before Egypt could send troops, Croesus was defeated by Cyrus. Amasis, no longer bound by the alliance, became an independent ruler. The circumstances surrounding the alliance's dissolution allowed Egypt to avoid sending aid. This historical event marked a shift in power dynamics in the region, with Egypt asserting its independence under Amasis.|"[""1.

In 538 B.C., the Persian monarchy conquered Babylon and brought the Chaldean monarchy to an end after nearly two thousand years. During this time, Phoenicia and Cyprus declared independence. Seeking glory, Amasis of Egypt attacked Cyprus, making them tributaries. The Egyptian king's actions angered Cyrus, who had other battles to fight. After Cyrus's death, his son Cambyses took power and conquered Phoenicia, securing a fleet for an attack on Egypt. Cambyses allied with Phoenician and Cypriote ships, gaining control of the Nile mouths. To reach Egypt, Cambyses had to navigate a waterless desert, relying on camels for supplies. He formed alliances with local tribes for water and camel support, enabling a successful march towards Memphis. Psamatik III, the Egyptian ruler, faced Cambyses but suffered a devastating defeat at Pelusium, leading to a retreat to Memphis.|['1.

Egypt's fate often hinged on a single decisive battle due to its flat terrain lacking strategic advantages. The Nile Valley's vast plain allowed large armies to maneuver freely. Attempts by foreign forces to take the high ground outside the valley failed due to lack of resources. Defeat in an open battle typically signaled military supremacy. When the Persian army besieged Memphis, Psamatik defended the city despite defeat. The Persians blockaded the river and executed captured messengers. Cambyses punished the Egyptians for their actions, leading to the fall of Memphis. The king's rebellion prompted his execution. Cambyses further desecrated Egyptian customs, showing contempt for their religion.|"[""1.

Herodotus, the earliest Greek historian, visited Egypt around the age of thirty to gather information for his work. He explored Egypt, from Elephantine to Memphis, describing the wonders he saw with enthusiasm. He witnessed battlefields, the pyramids, and the famous Labyrinth. After his visit, Egypt experienced a period of peace for about fifty years. However, in 406 or 405 BC, a rebellion led by Nepheritis brought about a war against Persia, resulting in the expulsion of the Persian garrison and the return of Pharaohs to the throne. This period of independence lasted about sixty years, bringing a brief revival to Egypt. Following Nepheritis, a time of unrest followed with frequent changes in leadership due to the fickle Greek mercenary soldiers. With the accession of Nectanebo I around 385 BC, Egypt saw improvements as he fortified the Nile mouths and ensured Egypt's defense without relying on foreign alliances.|"['1.

In 375 B.C., Artaxerxes Mnemon led a massive army and fleet against Egypt, with 220,000 soldiers and 500 warships. Pharnabazus and Iphicrates commanded Persian and Greek forces. They advanced slowly from Acre, reaching Pelusium, a heavily fortified city. Unable to breach the defenses, they changed tactics. Sailing north, they circled back southwest to the Mendesian mouth of the Nile, taking the twin forts guarding it. Despite initial victories, disagreements arose. Iphicrates urged a swift attack on Memphis while Pharnabazus favored caution. Nectanebo, the Egyptian ruler, reinforced Memphis and engaged the invaders, causing significant losses.

During his reign, Nectanebo, an Egyptian pharaoh, was revered as a hero and even worshipped as a demigod. He ruled peacefully for nine years, focusing on restoring Egypt's ancient glory. Nectanebo revitalized Egyptian art and architecture, enhancing temples and monuments across the land. His reign was marked by prosperity and cultural revival. However, his successors faced challenges. Tachos, who followed Nectanebo, provoked the Persians, leading to civil unrest in Egypt. With the help of Greek generals, Tachos managed to reclaim his throne after facing rebellion. Yet, internal conflicts continued, and eventually, Nectanebo II, also known as Nekht-nebf, took the throne. Nectanebo II resumed his predecessor's ambitious policies, forming alliances against Persia. Despite initial successes, his actions led to further conflict and instability in Egypt.|"[""1.

The rebels' success angered the Persian king, leading him to plan a massive expedition. King Ochus gathered a huge army, including 300,000 foot soldiers, 30,000 horsemen, 300 warships, and 500 supply ships. He sought Greek assistance, securing 10,000 troops from various Greek cities. With this combined force, Ochus invaded Sidon, where the traitorous Tennes betrayed his people. Sidon fell, and its citizens chose to burn their town rather than face Persian cruelty. Tennes met his end for his treachery. Ochus then turned his attention to Egypt, marching with his Greek mercenaries. The Egyptian ruler Nekht-nebf prepared for the invasion, defending Pelusium. Ochus's army faced challenges crossing Lake Serbonis, but eventually reached Pelusium, where the first clash with the Egyptian forces occurred.|"['1.

The two armies camped near the Pelusiac branch of the Nile, a well-protected area with forts and canals. Nekht-nebf had a chance to resist the Persian attack, but his arrogance and fear ruined his strategy. He failed to seek advice from his Greek captains, leading to poor decisions. When the Persians advanced, the Egyptians struggled. Pelusium fell due to Lacrates' tactics, while Mentor besieged Bubastis. The Egyptians, divided from their Greek allies, faced internal conflict. The Egyptians offered to surrender, but the Greeks resisted. Mentor outwitted Bagoas, gaining control. The Egyptian king fled to Ethiopia as the Persians took control without much resistance. Ochus showed disrespect to Egyptian religious sites, but his treatment of the people was not severe. He took treasures and destroyed fortifications, but did not mistreat the Egyptians.|"[""1.

When Persia decisively moved to subdue the rebellious province, it took only a few months to achieve. Persia's vast resources far surpassed Egypt's in men and money, creating a significant imbalance. Egypt's protection had been the multitude of Persia's enemies, ongoing wars, and the lack of a bold monarch. Once Persia focused its full might on the small detached country, the outcome was inevitable. Egypt could not withstand Persia's full force, much like a lynx against a lion. However, Egypt's end could have been more dignified. The last king, Nekht-nebf, lacked the qualities of a great monarch and failed to defend Egypt honorably, leading to its inglorious demise, with its art, literature, and national spirit decaying.|"[""1.
