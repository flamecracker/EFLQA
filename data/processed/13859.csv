Arnold tried to engage the stranger in conversation, but the foggy weather made it challenging. He then led the visitor to the pilot house, explaining the layout of the vessel. Arnold pointed out the fuel tanks, chain locker, and lazarette in the forward part, which could be used for extra bunks. He described the engines amidships with berths on each side and the switchboard in the center. Further aft were more berths, a kitchenette, and a washroom. Arnold showcased the dining room in the after cabin, highlighting the folding berths that could accommodate twelve people. Suddenly, the engines' vibrations lessened, causing concern among the boys. They suspected a gasoline leak and sprang into action to investigate and fix the issue. Jack suggested waking up the stranger for information, unsure of the motive behind the mysterious events.|"['1.

"The boys found Arnold fixing the pump in the cabin. Despite the lingering gasoline smell, Jack thought it safe to start the engine with open windows for ventilation.

""Desperate characters are on our trail. We must stay alert."" Jack revealed a secret: Lawyer Geyer of Chicago, a friend of his father, funded their mission to find hidden treasure.

"The boy went down to the cabin and took out a gun from a locker, keeping it handy. He stayed close to the rescued man, who didn't try to talk to him. The dog would come in, growl at the man, and leave. While tidying the newcomer's clothes, the boy found a newspaper clipping mentioning their ship, the ""Fortuna,"" and hinting at buried treasure seekers. The boys decided to speed towards the smoke they saw, trying to avoid the mysterious individuals. When the boat started flooding, they worked together to pump out the water and plug the leak, but their efforts were in vain.

Harry suggested using a plug of soft pine from the lazarette to secure a loose fid on the boat. The boys, amused by a visitor's joke, discussed a mysterious figure ashore.

"As the Fortuna neared the small bay pointed out by Tom, they found there was enough water for the boat to come close to the shore for an easy landing. Tom and Harry readied one of the metal boats from the cabin roof to lower once they reached land. After finishing their task, Tom stood up to get a better look at the beach they were approaching.

""Look,"" Harry exclaimed, peering through the glasses. ""He's signaling with his arms. 'D' for right arm at head, left arm down in front. Then 'A,' with both arms down and diagonal to the right. It spells 'DAN.' He's introducing himself!""

As the boat neared the shore, a stranger on the beach urgently signaled for them to return to the Fortuna. He looked alarmed, cautioning them with a gesture. Approaching him, they found Frank Evans of the Bob White patrol of St. Louis lying face down in the sand. Jack and his friends examined him but found no wounds. After introductions, Frank shared his story of being kidnapped by pirates disguised as fishermen. He described a sinister man named Wyckoff who had a grudge against them.

Frank, a resourceful Boy Scout, demonstrated his survival skills on Petit Bois Island. He crafted a fire stick and a bow from a shoelace, ensuring a reserve of coals for warmth. Using wreckage for shelter and tools, he fashioned a spear from a sharp spike and a torch from fat pine. Fishing at night, he caught three large flounders, unique flatfish that bury in sand to ambush prey. Frank's ingenuity impressed his friends, who planned to return to the mainland. Exploring Frank's camp, they mistook a crab shell for a horse's foot, showcasing nature's surprises.

A tiny wisp of smoke rose, catching everyone's attention. Tom aimed his pistol at an outlaw, instructing him to raise his hands.

"Tom was correct, and even though the morning fog had lifted, the air remained moist, and the Gulf wind was laden with moisture that made the boys shiver when still. They followed the suggestion to head towards one of Frank's earlier fires. Seated there, Tom and Jack kept a close watch on Wyckoff. ""Let's say we were after this legendary treasure chest,"" Jack debated, ""does that mean we're wronging you? Do you have more right to it than us?"" Wyckoff, furious, claimed, ""I am a direct descendant of the Spaniards who buried it. It's mine by family lineage."" Frank asked about the tale that the treasure seeker must keep silent and have clean hands. Wyckoff explained, ""The destined one must dig in silence with clean hands. That's why you're still alive.

The boys on the yacht Fortuna had worked hard to move the boat from where it had been beached by Tom in his rush to save them. The short distance meant it wasn't too hard to get the yacht back afloat with its powerful motors. After getting back on the water, they noticed their anchor was missing. When Frank surfaced after securing a line, they were relieved. However, their peace was short-lived as they heard a shot from shore. Urged by Jack, they rowed towards the beach, worried about a possible tragedy. Before they could reach land, they saw a figure jump off the yacht and a dog chasing after him. The boys raced to help their friend, Tom, who was getting up after a fall. Tom was confused about the situation and the explosion he had heard.|['1.

"""We're the bloodthirsty bunch!"" exclaimed Jack. ""There must be something in the air down here. This region was once infested by Captain Kidd and his pirates. Maybe they left behind a piratical germ in the atmosphere,"" he speculated. Tom chimed in, ""He left in a rush and forgot to take my gun. I must have accidentally triggered it when he attacked me. I'm glad he left it with me."" The boys had captured the fleeing villain, Wyckoff, with the help of their dog, Rowdy. Despite Wyckoff's pleas for mercy, Jack ordered him to return to the campfire.

Frank guided the group to a stack of large logs and planks washed ashore after a storm. Atop the pile sat a sturdy skiff. Despite the havoc wreaked by the tempest on larger vessels, the skiff remained unscathed. The boys, with Wyckoff's aid, managed to move the skiff across the sandy shore, a challenging task that left them breathless. Once afloat, they left Wyckoff with provisions on the skiff while they readied their yacht, the Fortuna. As they approached, Wyckoff tried to signal a schooner on the horizon. The boys rushed to assist him, while Frank skillfully steered the Fortuna away from danger, leaving the pursuing schooner far behind. Ultimately, the boys managed to evade the threat and return safely to the island.|"['1.

As the Fortuna sped ahead, the boys rushed Jack to the cabin, where he was carefully placed on a bunk. Tom quickly removed Jack's jacket and shirt, revealing his strong muscles, a result of regular exercise. Although initially weak, Jack's smile returned as he sipped hot coffee offered by Arnold. The boys celebrated Jack's recovery while enjoying a delicious supper prepared by Harry. As they ate, a beautiful sunset painted the sky, filling them with a sense of adventure. Arnold expressed his love for nature and animals, while Frank discussed his interest in studying wildlife.

As the Fortuna sailed into the harbor, the boys searched for a spot to anchor for the night. After passing the railroad bridge, they found a quiet area away from the bustling docks. The boys secured the boat with a cable and settled in for the night, saving exploration for the next day. The dog, initially playful, suddenly growled as a sharp object pierced his foot. Frank quickly helped the injured visitor, causing a moment of pain. After a brief laugh at the situation, the boys gathered in the cabin. Arnold explained how the stranger accidentally stepped on a horseshoe crab shell left on the floor.

Harry complimented Arnold for his stealthiness, comparing his quiet movements to a professional auctioneer's voice. Arnold, proud of trapping the intruder, volunteered for the first watch. Frank shared how the intruder left on a boat after a grand farewell. Jack noted that even the dog, Rowdy, didn't notice the intruder's departure. Arnold concluded that the intruder must have been harmless since Rowdy didn't react. The next morning, the boys cleaned the deck and enjoyed a refreshing sea-water shower before breakfast.

"With joy and high spirits, the boys eagerly awaited breakfast. Harry was skilled in the kitchen, as his friends would gladly confirm. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the task, just as he did with everything he took on. Today was no different. All eyes turned to where Jack pointed and spotted a schooner leaving the harbor. On the deck, several roughly dressed men lounged about in a manner far from that of seasoned sailors. They appeared unkempt and disheveled, presenting a rather unsavory group.

"The quick return to the harbor took little time. Upon arrival, Jack immediately went ashore to make arrangements for repairing the Fortuna.

Arnold and Harry, two adventurous boys, were exploring the outdoors. Arnold suggested going ashore to cook some fish for dinner. Harry remarked how everyone on the crew enjoyed good food.

"Harry expressed his reluctance, ""I don't like to do that,"" as he feared the snake might be lurking nearby.

Glad to share stories with Northern boys, the watchman listened intently to their adventures on Lake Michigan and Lake Superior. Tales of the mining region and a near-disaster on a trip South captivated him. As the hour passed, the boys realized it was late, hastening to prepare supper for their arriving friends. Meanwhile, the watchman, about to make his rounds, inquired about a man named Wyckoff nearby. Rowdy needed help boarding the boat, but once settled, they refrained from starting the engines to avoid displacing shoring. Anxious for their missing friends, a tense moment arose when Rowdy sensed something amiss. Using sign language, Jack communicated with his friends about the watchman's conversation with a possibly drunk and quarrelsome Wyckoff.

The boys quickly gathered their gear, including automatics and an acetylene headlight, and packed some food before borrowing a boat to search for their friends upstream. Soon, they found the skiff near a leaning oak, where they all marveled at some large fish. Their bulldog, Rowdy, led them on a fast-paced chase through various terrains as he picked up a scent. Along the way, the boys noticed Rowdy's unease and a hint of smoke in the air. Just as they were discussing the mysterious events, a stranger appeared and expertly shot a rattlesnake that threatened their safety.

Jack and his friends Arnold and Tom were in a tough spot. Arnold tried hard to protest, but it didn't work. Harry believed that Tom and Jack had been hurt, so Arnold should bear his burns bravely.

Tom suggested leaving the clearing until daylight and the fire had cooled. They decided to ask Doright to guide them back to the boats. As they left, they looked back at the cabin's spot with sadness. Doright led them through the forest, and they reached the clearing near the big oak.

Lopez, unaware of the sarcasm due to his limited English, rowed the captives swiftly towards town. Anxious, he urged the boys to row faster, directing them into a narrow bayou to hide from an approaching boat. The boys, exhausted but obedient, lay low as their friends passed by unknowingly. Lopez then took them to a deserted wharf, binding their arms with snake skin. He left with Doright to settle matters, instructing Doright to return the boats to the shipyard.

""Don't worry,"" Jack reassured. ""But dropping even one stick could have been catastrophic. They may look small, but they are powerful enough to shatter this vessel.""

Tom suggested waiting until morning, feeling exhausted. Jack agreed, planning to start repairs early.

The boys spent a peaceful night, undisturbed by any noise. Their deep sleep reflected their healthy and active lifestyle, free from the worries that often disrupt rest. The positive influence of their Scout Masters at the Beaver Patrol club had instilled in them a sense of purpose beyond selfish desires. The boys' actions surprised the watchman, still recovering from the previous night's haze. They cheerfully prepared a breakfast of pancakes, coffee, and shrimp offered by a passing fisherman. After ensuring the repairs on the Fortuna were completed, the boys rowed to the leaning oak to trace the path to the cabin. Despite their initial hesitation, they bravely searched through the ashes for clues about their missing friends. Their efforts led to a discovery, but their loyal dog, Rowdy, insisted on following a specific trail, hinting at more mysteries to unravel. With the Fortuna ready for launch, the boys' thoughts turned to a well-deserved dinner.|"[""1.

The boys easily boarded the loaded three-masted schooner and were met by an officer and crew. Jack reflected on the danger of their adversary, Wyckoff, who believed in a non-existent treasure. After repairing the ship from Wyckoff's sabotage, they stocked up and prepared for a night's rest. Little did they know of the impending danger. While enjoying supper, they discussed their missing friends and the threat from Wyckoff. Jack reassured them that their friends were likely being held until another treasure hunt attempt.

Harry, with a serious tone, shared valuable information he acquired in a burnt cabin in the woods. He recalled seeing Lopez, before leaving, stow an envelope in a chest. Desperate to retrieve it as the fire spread, Harry broke open the chest and found the sought-after item. It appeared to be a piece of leather marked with 'Biloxi Bayou.'

As the Fortuna arrived in Biloxi bay at dusk, the boys caught Spanish Mackerel for supper. They cooked a delicious meal with Doright's help. The electric lights on the wharf welcomed them as they tied up the boat. Suddenly, they heard footsteps, a man running, and a shot. Concerned for Rowdy, they felt compelled to go to his aid.|"[""1.

"""Be cautious with your words,"" warned Harrison. ""If the treasure is real, we must dig in silence to retrieve it. Any noise before the chest is fully out will ruin our chances."" Tom's words were unheard as a shot rang out from the workers. The boys were stunned, fearing the worst. They saw a worker dragged away by Lopez at gunpoint for breaking the silence. The boys readied their weapons as the situation grew tense. Harrison worried that the rising tide might soften the sand, forcing the workers to stop digging. Tom feared more violence from Lopez if the treasure remained elusive. As the ground shook and sand fell, only Wyckoff and Lopez remained. The boys felt guilty for the workers' fate and Jack tried to lift their spirits, but the mood remained somber."|['1.

Tom suggested a plan to rescue Wyckoff from the treacherous quicksand. He proposed making a running noose to lasso Wyckoff while the others covered Lopez with their guns. Unfortunately, despite their efforts, Wyckoff's fate was sealed when Lopez missed his shot, and Wyckoff's knife found its mark. The boys watched in horror as Wyckoff struggled in the quicksand, with the sands boiling around him. Tom's attempt to lasso him failed, and Wyckoff sank out of sight with a final shriek.

In a daze, Tom followed orders and tugged on the line. The loop tightened around his chest, making it hard to breathe. Struggling with all his might, Tom couldn't budge the object. Glancing at his friends, they too seemed stuck, staring wide-eyed at the scene. Slowly inch by inch, they made progress. As they dragged the chest through the hot sand towards firmer ground, they avoided the edge to prevent a sand collapse. Their backs ached, hands burned, but their training from games like tug-of-war helped. Despite nearing victory, the relentless quicksand tested their strength. Just then, Rowdy, once fearful, joined in, adding his strong muscles to the pull. With a final effort, the chest emerged from the pit, and the boys collapsed in relief. Jack suggested moving the chest onto the boat, eager to leave the eerie spot haunted by centuries of history.|['Question 1:\nWhat did Tom and his friends struggle to move through the sand?\nA) A rock\nB) A chest\nC) A tree\nD) A boat\nE) A treasure', 'Question 2:\nHow did Tom and his friends avoid a sand collapse?\nA) By running around the edge\nB) By pulling the chest quickly\nC) By dragging the chest slowly\nD) By pushing the chest\nE) By jumping over the chest', 'Question 3:\nWhat game helped Tom and his friends with their strength during the ordeal?\nA) Hide and Seek\nB) Tag\nC) Tug-of-War\nD) Red Rover\nE) Duck, Duck, Goose', 'Question 4:\nWho joined in to help Tom and his friends pull the chest out of the pit?\nA) Jack\nB) Rowdy\nC) Tom\nD) The narrator\nE) The chest itself', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Jack suggest doing with the chest after it was out of the pit?\nA) Leaving it there\nB) Burying it\nC) Moving it onto the boat\nD) Opening it on the spot\nE) Selling it', 'Question 6:\nWhat made Tom and his friends collapse in relief?\nA) Finding a map in the chest\nB) Spotting a ghost\nC) Pulling the chest out of the pit\nD) Seeing a boat approaching\nE) Realizing they were lost']|['B) A chest', 'C) By dragging the chest slowly', 'C) Tug-of-War', 'B) Rowdy', 'C) Moving it onto the boat', 'C) Pulling the chest out of the pit']
A group of boys from the Fortuna went on a treasure hunt. They found a chest filled with gold coins and jewels. Their attorney, Mr. Geyer, explained the value of the coins due to their age and condition. The boys celebrated with a meal prepared by Doright. Jack's father and Mr. Geyer offered to safeguard the treasure. With the outlaws defeated, the boys enjoyed fishing and exploring the islands in the Gulf of Mexico. They later embarked on a journey up the Mississippi River, encountering various adventures. The boys rested on the Fortuna, relieved that the treasure was safe. They received a billiard book and learned about the exciting sport. The story continued with the Motor Club's adventures on the Mississippi River, the St. Lawrence River, and the Great Lakes, as well as the Bird Boys' aviation exploits.|"['1.
