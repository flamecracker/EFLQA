"""That may be,"" said the Bull; so they charged at each other, fighting fiercely. The Bull gored the Troll's eyes and ran his horns through him. The Troll fought back, regenerating his heads when one was killed. It took a week for the Bull to defeat him, leaving him wounded.

At nine in the evening, the bagpiper returned to the market square. Facing away from the church, as the moon emerged, the bagpipes played. Rats flooded out from cellars, garrets, and furniture, converging towards the town hall. The bagpiper directed them towards a whirlpool in the stream, where they leaped in and vanished. The townspeople, amused by the ratcatcher's antics, refused to pay him. However, the Town Counsellor offered him fifty crowns as a reward. The children, drawn by the music, followed the bagpiper to a mountain that opened up and swallowed them, leaving only three behind. Despite searches, the children were never found.

About one hundred and fifty years after the event, when there was no longer one left of the fathers, mothers, brothers or sisters of that day, there arrived one evening in Hamel some merchants of Bremen returning from the East, who asked to speak with the citizens. They told that they, in crossing Hungary, had sojourned in a mountainous country called Transylvania, where the inhabitants only spoke German, while all around them nothing was spoken but Hungarian. These people also declared that they came from Germany, but they did not know how they chanced to be in this strange country. ‘Now,’ said the merchants of Bremen, ‘these Germans cannot be other than the descendants of the lost children of Hamel.’ The people of Hamel did not doubt it; and since that day they regard it as certain that the Transylvanians of Hungary are their country folk, whose ancestors, as children, were brought there by the ratcatcher.

Once upon a time, there was a youth who found himself in a peculiar situation. While hiding in a spruce fir, he witnessed a fierce battle between two horses, Dapplegrim and a fiery horse with flame-spouting nostrils. The strange horse caught fire due to the tar-covered hides flung over Dapplegrim, causing a chaotic fight. Stones flew to the sky as the horses fiercely clashed. Ultimately, the strange horse had to yield as the spikes in the hides proved too much for him. The youth then tamed the dappled horse, identical to Dapplegrim, and rode it back to the King's palace.

Long ago, a young boy named Sigurd, son of a royal family, was given a magnificent horse named Grani by his tutor. Grani was from a lineage of powerful horses and was the best in the world. Sigurd was also told by his tutor about a great treasure of red gold that belonged to his father. This treasure had a dark history involving a dragon named Fafnir and his brothers. Sigurd, armed with a sword made by his tutor, set out to face the dragon. He cleverly defeated the dragon and claimed its treasure, including a magical helmet that granted invisibility.

At night, Sigurd saw a blazing fire on a hill with a castle inside. He rode through the fire on his horse, Grani, and found a lady in armor. Removing her helmet, he discovered a beautiful woman named Brynhild. She had been cursed by Odin for displeasing him long ago. Brynhild, a warrior maid, vowed never to marry a man who feared the flaming fire. Sigurd and Brynhild fell in love, but Sigurd was tricked into forgetting her by Gudrun's witch mother. Sigurd, disguised as Gunnar, won Brynhild's hand in marriage. Later, when the effects of the forgetful potion wore off, Sigurd remembered his love for Brynhild but kept it a secret to avoid causing sorrow. The curse of the dwarf Andvari's treasure loomed over them all.|"['1. What did Sigurd see on the hill at night?\nA) A blazing fire\nB) A dragon\nC) A rainbow\nD) A waterfall\nE) A ghost', ""2.
