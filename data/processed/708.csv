Once upon a time, there was a young princess named Irene. She lived in a grand palace on a mountain, but due to her mother's illness, she was sent to be raised by country folk in a house that was part castle, part farmhouse on another mountain. Irene, a kind and pretty little girl with eyes like the night sky, was about eight years old when the story begins. She grew up quickly. Her nursery had a blue ceiling with stars, mimicking the sky. However, Irene had never seen the real night sky due to the goblins living in the underground caverns of the mountains. These goblins, once similar to humans, had become misshapen and mischievous over time, harboring a grudge against the surface-dwellers.

At the top of the stairs, the princess found herself in a small square room with three doors. Unsure of what to do next, she heard a gentle, monotonous humming sound. Curious, she followed the sound to the third door and peeked inside. There sat a very old lady spinning, with smooth white skin and hair as white as snow. The princess, although unsure why, thought the lady must be around fifty. As the old lady noticed the princess, she kindly asked her to come in. The princess obeyed, closing the door gently behind her. The old lady washed the princess's face, and the princess marveled at her smooth hands.|"['1.

The princess watched in awe as the old lady spun thread on the spinning wheel. Dressed in black velvet with silver hair shining, the lady led her to a room filled with beautiful pigeons. The princess clapped with joy as the birds fluttered around. The old lady showed her the nests and eggs in the pigeon-holes. Later, the princess explained her adventure to her nurse, who didn't believe her. The princess, hurt by not being believed, ate little and remained silent.

The princess woke to the sound of rain falling once more. She pondered visiting the lady in the tower but hesitated, not wanting to upset her. While eating breakfast, she mused about the taste of pigeon eggs. Determined to find the tower, she set off alone, getting lost in the castle. After a failed attempt, she discovered a new stairway leading down to the kitchen, where she was warmly received by the staff. The princess kept her adventure a secret from her nurse, feeling disappointed yet hopeful about finding the mysterious lady.

The following day, a large cloud still loomed over the mountain, and rain poured heavily. The princess loved the outdoors and was upset by the weather. However, the mist began to brighten, becoming almost blinding as the day progressed. In the afternoon, the sun emerged gloriously, making Irene clap with joy. Eager to please the princess, Lootie prepared for a walk up the mountain where the road dried quickly after rain. The clouds dispersed, revealing a deep blue sky, and trees glistened with raindrops like jewels. Despite the muddy streams, Irene marveled at the rushing waters. As they walked, a mountain peak's shadow startled Lootie, prompting her to run downhill as the sun set. Irene fell, crying, but Lootie's fear was evident. As they hurried, Irene heard whistling and saw a boy approaching, singing a cheerful tune.|"['1.

The sound of hammers echoes in the mine as the miner-boys work, breaking rocks and uncovering shiny ore. Singing a song to keep the goblins away, a brave boy in miner's attire stands fearlessly against the lurking creatures. The nurse, trembling at the mention of goblins, urges the boy to quiet down, but he continues to sing boldly. The boy, with dark eyes and a sparkling spirit, explains that the goblins fear singing and despise the song he sings. Unafraid and confident, the boy reveals that standing up to the goblins with a song is the key to keeping them at bay.

As Curdie spoke his final words, he released his grip on his friend and dashed towards the creature in the road as if he would crush it. The creature leaped and scurried up a rock like a giant spider. Curdie chuckled, took Irene's hand, and continued on their way. Irene held onto his hand tightly until they passed the rocks. Nothing else eventful occurred as they made it home safely without anyone noticing their absence. The nurse hurriedly wished Curdie good night as they arrived at their door. Irene attempted to embrace Curdie, but the nurse intervened, unsure if it was worse for the princess to be out after dark or to kiss a miner-boy. Curdie, being a gentleman, understood the situation and kept quiet to avoid trouble for the nurse. Later that night, Curdie heard strange noises outside, but upon investigation, the creatures had vanished. The next morning, Curdie suspected the goblins were upset with him for protecting the princess. Despite this, he remained unfazed and focused on his day ahead, heading to the mine with his father after breakfast.|"['1.

They entered the hill through a natural opening under a massive rock, where a small stream gushed out. Following its path for a short distance, the passage curved and descended steeply into the heart of the hill. With many twists, turns, and branches, sometimes leading to steps where it encountered a natural gap, it guided them deep into the hill where they were excavating the valuable ore. The mountain was rich in various metals. Lighting their lamps with flint and steel, they secured them on their heads and began working with pickaxes, shovels, and hammers. Father and son worked near each other in separate passages. The miners toiled in uncomfortable positions in cramped spaces, listening to their companions burrowing in the distance. Some miners worked through the night, driven by the need for extra money. The miners feared the goblins who inhabited the underground darkness, and some believed they heard the goblins tapping away during the night. Curdie, brave and determined, chose to stay alone overnight to earn extra wages and uncover the mystery of the goblins' activities.|"['1.

"""Yes, but a good distance further than where he is now. If he had aimed slightly to the side here,"" the goblin explained, tapping the stone near Curdie's head, ""he would have passed through.

Curdie discovered that the goblins were building new houses to protect themselves from the miners. He also learned that a disaster was imminent for the miners. Curdie found out that goblins had tender feet, a weakness that could be useful. He wanted to find out the evil plan the goblins were hatching. Curdie knew the goblins' palace was in a distant part of the mountain, separated from the mine. He tried to create an opening to spy on them without alerting them. Curdie found a goblin foot through the hole he made, causing the goblin to cry out. He continued enlarging the hole to listen to their conversations. The goblins were getting ready to leave for a meeting at the palace. They disliked sunlight and preferred their own torches for light.|"[""1.

Curdie refrained from shouting to ask if the goblins had lit the fire for their torches. He realized they would have claimed they did, as they struck stones to create a flame. After the goblins left, Curdie widened the hole and crawled through without relighting his lamp. The goblin home seemed like an ordinary cave. Curdie saw the goblins carrying heavy loads and followed them cautiously through various passages. The caves were natural, with stalactites hanging from the ceilings. Curdie was surprised to see many household animals among the goblins. He almost stumbled upon the goblin family but retreated in time. Curdie then followed the goblins to a larger cave where they set down their burdens. He watched as the goblin father and son continued towards the palace, listening to distant noises and voices.|['1.

Curdie suspected that the goblins planned to flood the mine by creating openings for water from natural reservoirs in the mountain. The miners were at risk from water, not explosive gases. Curdie decided to block the goblins' passage to prevent the mine's destruction. He filled the gang with stones and clay to stop any water from entering. Curdie kept the door open to learn the goblins' other plan. When the goblins left, Curdie filled the hole he made with stones. He then went home to rest. Princess Irene heard her father's bugle and saw him approaching with a shining troop. Overjoyed, she ran to meet him. Her heart raced as she awaited his arrival, eager to be in his arms again.|"['1.

At this moment, everyone from the house gathered at the entrance, but Irene stood alone in front of them. As the horsemen arrived, she hurried to the side of the white horse and raised her arms. The king halted and grasped her hands. In a flash, she was on the saddle, embraced in his powerful arms. I wish I could depict the king for you to envision him clearly. He had kind blue eyes but a nose resembling an eagle. A lengthy dark beard, streaked with silvery lines, cascaded from his mouth almost to his waist. As Irene sat on the saddle, her face beaming, buried in his chest, his beard mingled with her mother's golden hair, creating a cloud with sun streaks. After holding her close for a moment, he spoke to his horse, which then walked gently through the gate with the little lady on its back.|"['1.

One morning, the nurse left the little princess with the housekeeper. To keep her entertained, the housekeeper emptied an old cabinet onto the table. The princess found the ancient ornaments and mysterious items more captivating than her own toys. She played with them for hours until she pricked her thumb with a brooch. The pain worsened, and her thumb swelled, causing alarm. The nurse and doctor were called, and she was put to bed early. In the night, she woke to the moonlight shining in, her hand hot and in pain. Wanting to cool it, she went to the window and saw a guard in the garden. She thought of waking him but decided against it. Instead, she ventured up a staircase, drawn by a longing to find the old lady with silver hair.|"['Question 1: Why did the housekeeper empty an old cabinet onto the table for the princess?\nA) To organize the items\nB) To throw away the old items\nC) To keep the princess entertained\nD) To clean the cabinet\nE) To sell the items', 'Question 2: What caused the princess to be put to bed early?\nA) She was tired\nB) She wanted to play with her toys\nC) She pricked her thumb with a brooch\nD) She had a headache\nE) She was hungry', 'Question 3: Why did the princess go to the window in the middle of the night?\nA) To call for help\nB) To look at the moonlight\nC) To find her toys\nD) To escape the house\nE) To find the guard in the garden', 'Question 4: What did the princess see in the garden from the window?\nA) A dog\nB) A guard\nC) A cat\nD) A bird\nE) A squirrel', ""Question 5: Why did the princess decide against waking the guard in the garden?\nA) She was scared of him\nB) She didn't want to bother him\nC) She thought he was sleeping\nD) She wanted to play a prank on him\nE) She wanted to go back to bed"", 'Question 6: What drew the princess up a staircase in the middle of the night?\nA) Her toys\nB) A longing to find the old lady with silver hair\nC) The moonlight\nD) A noise\nE) The guard in the garden']"|"['C) To keep the princess entertained', 'C) She pricked her thumb with a brooch', 'B) To look at the moonlight', 'B) A guard', ""B) She didn't want to bother him"", 'B) A longing to find the old lady with silver hair']"
The princess stepped inside and found the old lady sitting in the moonlight, spinning a special kind of spider-web. The old lady, with her silvery hair blending into the moonlight, asked Irene if she could guess what she was spinning. Irene, surprised that the old lady knew her name, admitted she thought the lady was a dream. The old lady explained that she didn't want to be found earlier and advised Irene not to mention her to anyone, not even Lootie. She revealed that the spider-web she was spinning was the finest and strongest kind, brought by her pigeons from a distant forest. The thread was so delicate that it was barely visible. The old lady, called grandmother by Irene, shared that she only worked on moonlit nights and would soon finish her current task.|"['1.

Irene showed her hand in the moonlight to the old lady and shared her story, making the old lady look serious.

The little princess fell asleep dreaming of beautiful landscapes, only to wake up in her own bed with a sweet scent lingering in the air. Meanwhile, Curdie and his father confided in Mrs. Peterson, a kind and hardworking woman who created a haven for her family. Curdie ventured into the mine each night, using a ball of string to navigate the dark tunnels. One night, he stumbled upon a group of goblins working diligently, but he couldn't discern their purpose. Despite the risks, Curdie continued his nightly explorations, always returning to find his mother had neatly wound up the string he used as his guide.

During the night, the men guarding the princess witnessed strange and grotesque creatures lurking around the house. These creatures, more like a child's drawings than natural beings, appeared misshapen and bizarre. The first man to spot one described it as having a dog or wolf-like body but with an unnaturally large, round head. When he shot an arrow at it, the creature emitted an eerie howl and vanished. Initially ridiculed, more men started seeing similar creatures, each with its own peculiar appearance. Eventually, a group of these odd beings gathered in the moonlit garden, displaying a variety of hideous features and making unsettling noises. These creatures were revealed to be domestic animals belonging to the goblins, transformed over generations into grotesque forms due to their subterranean existence.

How the nurse managed to sleep through it was a puzzle, but I suspect the old lady had a hand in it. Although the sun had not yet risen, its rays had touched some fluffy edges, casting orange and gold fringes in the air. Dew drops adorned the leaves, resembling tiny diamond earrings on the grass.

Irene shivered when she spotted the terrifying creatures she had unknowingly passed by. Following Curdie's instructions, she turned around, holding the torch low. Curdie carefully removed one of the queen's shoes, revealing her six grotesque toes. Encouraged by his success, he attempted to take the other shoe to conquer his fear of the goblins. However, as he tugged at the second shoe, the queen woke up with a growl. Curdie swiftly grabbed her hand, and they followed Irene's thread, evading the pursuing goblins. The thread led them to a narrow opening where Irene easily passed through, and Curdie struggled to follow. As they walked, Curdie shared his encounters with the goblins, prompting Irene to explain how she came to their rescue. Despite her explanation, Curdie remained puzzled by her story and questioned its validity. Irene insisted that she felt a thread guiding them, but Curdie could not perceive it.
