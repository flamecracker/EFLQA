The horseman rode slowly westward, pausing to scan the vast wilderness with his keen eyes. To his right, the plains stretched out with only cacti and chaparral breaking the brown expanse. On his left, a river meandered through the sand, dividing into multiple streams before reuniting further downstream. The landscape to the south appeared barren and desolate, while to the north, misty banks gathered on the horizon. The young rider, clad in buckskin with a broad-brimmed hat, exuded strength and health. As the Texan winter set in, icy gusts swept across the plains, and the air grew colder.

Ned Fulton, although courageous, felt alarmed by the signs he saw in the wilderness. He was alone, without anyone to share the danger. Searching for shelter, he rode north, hoping to find a place to hide from the approaching storm. The Norther descended rapidly, bringing plummeting temperatures and howling winds that whipped up dust and snow.

The horse softly neighed and nuzzled Ned's arm. As darkness crept in, Ned felt a sense of unease. Sheltered among bushes, they couldn't remain there forever. Moving to the plain would expose them to the harsh, cold wind. Ned, weary from the storm, hesitated to rest, fearing he might not wake. In the growing darkness, he spotted ten figures, short and sturdy, approaching. Recognizing them as Mexicans, Ned's heart raced. It was the first sighting since Cos's departure from San Antonio. Anticipating their return in force, Ned crouched low, grateful for his horse's silence. As the Mexicans passed by, Ned held his breath, relieved when they disappeared. With the storm subsiding, Ned rode out, the warm southern wind signaling safety. The night transformed into a tranquil scene under a starry sky, melting snow trickling down. Despite exhaustion, Ned mounted his horse, grateful for their survival.|"['1. What did Ned feel as darkness crept in?\nA) Excitement\nB) Unease\nC) Relief\nD) Happiness\nE) Anger', ""2.

Ned was in search of shelter, warmth, and a place to rest for the night. He rode north for over two hours, passing chaparral patches but seeking denser timber. Eventually, he found a circle of oak, pecan, and aspen trees. The clearing was dry, shielded from the snow by the trees. Grateful, he set up camp, spreading his bed on a dry rock outcrop. Hungry and tired, he gathered fallen wood, lit a fire, and cooked deer and buffalo meat. After eating heartily, he extinguished the fire, ensuring no sparks were visible. Feeling warm and secure, he settled down for a peaceful sleep, comforted by the sound of the south wind rustling through the trees.|['1.

The horse stopped eating and gazed at the sleeping boy. It gently nudged his blankets with its nose and then moved to the other side of the clearing to lie down and sleep. The next morning, the horse, named Old Jack, woke early and saw a beautiful winter day. He noticed that the grass was scarce but still diligently searched for any overlooked blades. The boy, Ned, woke up late and felt guilty for oversleeping. Despite scolding his horse, he realized it wasn't Old Jack's fault. They both enjoyed a restful sleep. Ned had a quick breakfast, saddled up, and rode north. Using a mirror, he signaled someone on a distant hill. After exchanging signals, he rode confidently towards the hill where he saw two familiar figures awaiting him.|"[""1.

"""We're nearing the buffalo range,"" the Panther announced. ""A hundred miles to the west, we might find large herds. After we're done with the fight against the Mexicans, I plan to head out there again. That's the life for me."" As night fell, dark and cold, they camped without a fire, lying in a dip on their horse blankets. The Panther stood watch, attentive for any signs of danger. A gentle wind carried the sound of a massive buffalo herd passing by. The Panther observed the wolves trailing the herd, ready to prey on the weak. He woke his companions, suggesting they track down Urrea's band. Convinced that the presence of the band had stirred the buffaloes, the Panther proposed they ride south to find and confront them."|"[""1.

"""I agree,"" responded Obed White. ""My watch indicates it's one in the morning, and my watch is always accurate as I crafted it myself. We've rested well and should continue our journey, for what we discover may be valuable. Just like finding a needle in a haystack, with enough perseverance, we'll uncover it."" Riding due south along the buffalo herd's trail, they halted after two hours at the Panther's signal. In a vast plain where buffalo grass still thrived despite winter, the Panther confirmed the herd's recent presence. Leading the way, the Panther, with his exceptional tracking skills, spotted buffalo skeletons, indicating recent kills likely by Mexicans from Urrea's band. Approaching a distant campfire, they prepared to engage cautiously, suspecting the presence of Urrea's men. The Panther, discerning horse movements from afar, decided that Obed should stay back with the horses due to his calming influence on animals.

At the edge of the dense bushes, two figures knelt and listened intently. They could hear the distant sound of horses and see shadows near a fire about three hundred yards away. The Panther, blending with the earth, skillfully moved forward through the thorny bushes like a trained animal. Ned, following closely, moved quietly, guided by the Panther's path. As they approached the fire, the Panther pointed out Urrea, a man in a splendid uniform, surrounded by officers. Ned noticed a group of prisoners, Texans bound to trees, awaiting a grim fate. The Panther whispered about a plan to follow the group and rescue the prisoners. Ned, though hesitant, agreed to join the Panther in this risky mission to save the captured Texans from certain death.|"['1.

At that moment, a sudden gust of wind made the fire leap higher, casting a glow on the faces of the prisoners. Most were asleep, but Ned could see them clearly. Among them was a boy, not much older than himself, looking pale and tired. Next to him sat an old man with a scholarly and ascetic appearance. Ned sensed his importance. Urrea, their captor, rose and gazed at them with a face that seemed almost demonic in the moonlight. Ned realized Urrea was a formidable enemy, filled with savage exultation. As Urrea spoke to his officers and retreated into a tent, Ned and the Panther decided to follow discreetly. Moving through the chaparral, they planned to rescue the Texans bound by Urrea. Despite the risks, Obed White was determined to join them on this daring mission. They trailed Urrea's band towards Mexico, knowing the captives' fate rested in their hands.|"['1.

The group of Urrea consisted of around fifty well-armed and mounted Mexican horsemen. Skilled in horsemanship, they posed a threat with proper guidance and training. The trio, Ned, Obed, and the Panther, trailed them cautiously, ensuring they remained unnoticed. Urrea's men swiftly crossed the Rio Grande, expertly navigating the waters. The prisoners were kept in the middle of the group. After ensuring a safe distance, Ned and his companions also crossed the river into Mexican territory. The landscape seemed aged and weary to Ned, evoking a sense of decay. As they continued their pursuit, they hoped for inclement weather to delay the prisoners' fate until higher authorities intervened. The next morning, both parties continued their journey, with the Panther using a vibrant scarlet serape to shield himself from the cold, feeling empowered by its red hue. The terrain grew rougher as they closely monitored Urrea's troop, noting a decline in their discipline.|"[""1.

As the night approached, raindrops began to fall on their faces, and the sun disappeared behind the clouds. The trio felt joyous as the dark and wet night arrived sooner than expected. Obed and Ned wrapped themselves in serapes to shield their bodies and firearms from the rain. They securely tied their horses by thorn bushes near Urrea's camp and proceeded on foot. In the darkness, they could barely distinguish figures and footsteps were muffled by the rain-soaked ground. Approaching Urrea's camp, they noticed a faint glimmer of the campfire. Amidst the trees, they spotted a low adobe hut where Urrea and his officers sought refuge. The rest of the band huddled under trees or by the fire, while prisoners remained bound in the rain. Ned's anger surged at the disorderly scene. The Panther noticed a shed near the woods, signaling a potential opportunity for rescue. They retreated into the bushes, waiting for the Mexicans to fall asleep. When silence enveloped the camp, they cautiously approached, finding most asleep except for two sentinels. The Panther's foresight proved true as they prepared for a stealthy operation.|"['1.

The two sentinels, who vigilantly watched the south side of the glade, enjoyed each other's company. They focused on lighting cigarritos to endure their rainy watch. Obed remarked on men's actions in war, mentioning the Panther's hidden presence. The Panther devised a plan to disarm the sentinels quietly. Meanwhile, the captives lay bound under trees, asleep from exhaustion. The Panther, skilled in shooting, prepared to cover their escape. Ned and his companion stealthily freed the captives. Ned recognized the youthful boy among them and set him loose. The boy silently followed Ned's lead. Approaching the next prisoner, an elderly man, Ned noticed the man's alert gaze fixed on him.|['1.

Ned trembled as he realized the gravity of the prisoner's situation. Despite his inability to walk, Ned knew he had to help. A brilliant idea struck him. He quickly freed the other prisoners with Obed's help. As they made their escape, the guards noticed and fired shots. The Panther, with his commanding voice, led the charge, creating chaos among the Mexicans. Amidst the confusion, the prisoners were armed and mounted on horses. The group, led by the Panther, made their way northward. The night was filled with tension as they walked in silence, the Panther's laughter breaking the quiet, filled with relief and triumph. It was a moment of victory, a testament to their bravery and unity.|"[""1.

"""He sure did some tearing and roaring then,"" he said. ""It was the best opportunity I ever had, and I think I made good use of it. How things worked out for us! Those drowsy guards, and then the stampede of the animals, carrying Urrea and the others away with it.""

""We cannot find the words to express our gratitude,"" said the man on the horse. ""Urrea made it clear to us that we were rebels and would be executed under Santa Anna's decree. Even our young friend here, this boy, William Allen, would not have been spared.""

""We're not completely safe yet,"" said the Panther cautiously. ""Urrea and his men still have some weapons. They wouldn't have left them all under the shed, and they can acquire more from other Mexicans in the area. Once they realize how few we are, they'll pursue us.""

""Let them come. I was caught off guard, not expecting any Mexicans north of the Rio Grande. But now that I have a rifle on one shoulder and a musket on the other, I believe I could handle a lot of them in an acre.""

They fell silent once more. The rain had eased a bit, but the night remained as dark as ever. The boy named William Allen drew near Ned. They were of similar height, each as tall and sturdy as a man.

The stranger stood out from the border crowd with his refined appearance and deep contemplation evident in his large features and thick white hair. Despite his torn clothing, he exuded quality. Ned sensed the power and emotional restraint in his demeanor. The rest were typical border men, lean and sun-kissed, clad in deerskin. The Panther and Obed were intrigued by the stranger's presence, especially noticing his smooth white hands, a stark contrast to his otherwise paralyzed state. The stranger, a merchant from New Orleans, shared his ordeal of being abducted by Urrea, a guerilla leader, seeking a hefty sum. Despite enduring a brutal encounter resulting in his paralysis, he remained resilient, determined to walk unaided soon. The trio's timely intervention was acknowledged by the merchant, leaving Ned shaken by the harsh realities faced in their Texan struggles.|"['1.

"""We must ensure everyone is completely dry,"" stated the Panther. ""The pursuit may come, but not tonight, and we don't need to worry about the fire. We have enough food for all of you for a day, but we lack the horses, which I regret. With them, we could easily reach the Texan army without a doubt.""

""We will,"" affirmed a Texan named Fields. ""I won't let Urrea catch me again, and if I'm not mistaken, your friend here is Mr. Palmer, also known as the Ring-Tailed Panther in our parts, right?""

""As you are the most injured,"" the Panther continued, ""we'll make you a bed by the fire. If you refuse, we'll have to lay you down. You all have done so much for us, and we can never repay you. Now rest, four of us will keep watch. We'll be vigilant, but don't expect any trouble tonight.""

Morning arrived, the sun shining brightly over the plains. Dew from the previous night glistened briefly before evaporating. Despite the cold day, a sharp wind blew. Ned, Obed, and the Panther were early risers, while some of the rescued still slept.

At the Panther's suggestion, Ned rode one of the horses southward for a better view but saw only cacti. Upon his return, the Panther decided to take it easy since no pursuit was in sight.

"""There are others as young as I, or younger, who have fought or will fight for Texas,"" said Ned. ""I belong here and I've got powerful friends. Two of them have saved my life more than once and are likely to do so again."" He nodded toward Obed and the Panther, who were too far away to hear. Roylston smiled. The two men were in singular contrast, but each was striking in his way. Obed, of great height and very thin, but exceedingly strong, was like a steel lath. The Panther, huge in every aspect, reminded one, in his size and strength, of a buffalo bull.

Roylston again mounted one of the horses. Ned saw that it hurt his pride to have to ride, but he saw also that he would not complain when complaints availed nothing. He felt an increasing interest in a man who seemed to have perfect command over himself.

The boy, Will Allen, was fresh and strong again. His youthful frame had recovered completely from all hardships, and now that he was free, armed, and in the company of true friends his face glowed with pleasure and enthusiasm. He was tall and strong, and now he carried a good rifle with a pistol also in his belt. He and Ned walked side by side, and each rejoiced in the companionship of one of his own age.

"""It's likely that you're right about tonight,"" Obed remarked. ""But there's always a silver lining even in the darkest of nights. With our good shots and plenty of guns, we can defend against any force Urrea may send our way,"" he continued optimistically. The group searched for a suitable campsite near water, finding a stream and a grove of trees to set up camp. They built a fire, ate supper, and took turns keeping watch. Roylston, with his injured legs, sat ready with a rifle by a tree. Ned ensured his horse, Old Jack, was safe before taking his position to watch over the creek. The Panther commended Roylston's vigilance and provided him with a rifle for defense. The group remained alert, with Ned keeping a watchful eye on the creek bed for any signs of danger."|"['1.

The dry wind had blown all day, leaving the camp silent under the cold moon and stars. Ned, trying to keep warm, walked as Roylston sat with his rifle. Ned praised Roylston's description skills but sensed danger lurking. His unease grew when he saw shadowy figures in the river bed. Realizing they were Urrea's men, Ned fired his rifle, causing chaos. The Panther and others defended against a second attack led by Urrea himself. Amidst the chaos, Roylston, with his white hair, calmly shot at the Mexicans. Despite the fierce fight, the Mexicans regrouped for another charge. Ned fired at a figure he believed was Urrea but missed, and the enemy disappeared into the darkness.|['1.

The second attack was repelled just like the first, and even though a couple of skirmishers attempted to advance down the creek, they were swiftly driven back. Two Mexican soldiers tried to spook the horses, but Obed and Fields acted quickly, preventing any harm. One of the Mexicans was captured, while the other managed to escape under the cover of darkness. The Texan group remained vigilant throughout the night, with Ned, Will, and the Panther keeping a close eye on the creek bed, illuminated by the moon and stars. The Mexicans refrained from another assault through the dangerous route, opting instead to fire sporadically from a distance. Despite a few Texans sustaining minor injuries, the Panther and Fields skillfully tended to their wounds as the day began to break. Fields, especially, was elated by their triumph, as he had narrowly escaped death the day before. The group worked together to fortify their position, moving fallen logs to the edge of the woods for added protection.

Ned and Will couldn't sleep, so they sat by the creek, watching the sun rise over the plains. The morning was cold but peaceful. They spotted three fallen men in the distance, remnants of the previous night's battle. The Panther suggested lighting fires for warmth and morale. Ned then rode out on Old Jack to scout the Mexican position. When the horse neighed upon seeing Ned, the Panther was pleased, knowing the enemy would reveal their location by firing. The Panther remained resolute in the face of Urrea's threats, asserting their Texan rights and warning Urrea of their own capabilities. With that, they bid Urrea farewell.|"[""1.

The Panther and the Texans faced a challenge: their horses needed water but couldn't reach the creek due to steep banks. Resourceful, they carved a path down the cliff for the horses. Old Jack, hesitant at first, was coaxed down by Ned's gentle encouragement. The other horses followed suit. While some kept watch for Mexican sharpshooters, the horses were safely watered and hidden in the thicket. Despite dwindling food supplies, the group remained hopeful. As the day progressed, the weather changed, clouds gathering in the sky. Ned and the Panther, satisfied with their plan, inspected the creek bed. Will observed their actions, curious about their intentions. The day ended with a sense of anticipation and a new idea brewing among the Texans.|"['1.

As the sun dipped below the horizon and darkness enveloped them, the Panther shared their bold plan, met with unanimous approval. By nine o'clock, the group gathered where the path descended into the creek bed. Despite the likelihood of Mexican presence nearby, the Panther trusted they wouldn't venture into the stream's cut. With utmost caution urged by their leader, the band readied themselves. The challenge lay in managing the horses, with Ned leading Old Jack silently. Roylston, feeling a burden, mounted quietly. Moving stealthily over the noiseless sand, armed and alert, they progressed, led by the Panther and Obed, followed closely by Ned and Will. The tension mounted as they navigated the dark, silent path, wary of Mexican sentinels. The group quickened their pace, now a mile from the grove, the creek banks diminishing in height. Pausing to listen, only the wind's soft whispers and a distant coyote's howl filled the night.|"[""1.

"""We've evaded them! By the great horn spoon, we've evaded them!"" exclaimed the Panther triumphantly. ""Boys, let's head for the water here to throw them off our trail when they try to track us in the morning."" The Panther stepped into the stream, followed by the others. The horses made noise splashing in the water, but they were less concerned now that they had distanced themselves from the grove. Urging them to hurry, the Panther led them through the water for two more miles before exiting where their tracks would be less noticeable.

"""It's been abandoned a long time,"" said the Panther. ""I can tell that by its looks, but I'm thinkin' that it's good enough fur us an' mighty welcome. An' there's a shed behind the house that'll do for the horses. Boys, we're travelin' in tall luck.""

The cabin, a large one, built of logs and adobe, was certainly a consoling sight. They had almost reached the limit of physical endurance, but they broke into a run to reach it. The Panther and Ned were the first to push open a heavy swinging door, and they entered side by side. It was dry within. The solid board roof did not seem to be damaged at all, and the floor of hard, packed earth was as dry as a bone also. At one end were a wide stone fireplace, cold long since, and a good chimney of mud and sticks. There were two windows, closed with heavy clapboard shutters.

There was no furniture in the cabin except two rough wooden benches. Evidently the original owners had prepared well for their flight, but it was likely that no one had come since. The lonely place among the trees had passed unobserved by raiders. The shed behind the cabin was also in good condition, and they tethered there the horses, which were glad enough to escape from the bitter wind and driving snow.

The lively singing and dancing eventually quieted down as the night progressed. The cozy cabin felt stuffy until a window was opened, welcoming a refreshing breeze. Outside, the wind continued to whistle, and the snow covered everything in a white blanket. As the men settled in for the night on the floor, some kept watch while others slept. The Panther predicted the snow would stop soon. In the morning, everyone woke up a bit stiff but unharmed. The horses were safe but hungry. After a modest breakfast, the group faced a decision. Roylston proposed staying put, using the cabin as a base to help Texas. The Panther agreed, suggesting they wait for better conditions before venturing out.

They quickly began preparing their house for living. More firewood was brought in, and they used hatchets to fix hooks for their belongings. Some cleared snow for the horses to graze, while a nearby spring provided water. The Panther anticipated finding game like buffalo, deer, antelope, or wild turkeys. As they searched the dwarfed forest, a deer darted past. Obed spotted large footprints, likely from buffalo. After riding for two hours, Ned saw buffalo in the distance. The Panther shot a cow, leading a bull to charge at them. Ned refrained from shooting the bull, following the Panther's advice, and targeted a cow instead. With their successful hunt, they skinned the animals and rode away, feeling triumphant and grateful for their unity and success.|"['1.

As Ned rode back to the cabin, he spotted wild turkeys perched in a tree. With precision, he shot down two turkeys, adding nearly sixty pounds of meat to their supplies. Upon returning, Ned shared his success with his companions, Fields and Carter, who had helped bring down two young buffalo cows. The group worked together to preserve the buffalo robes and cooked a hearty meal. As the day wound down, they reflected on their good fortune, enjoying the peaceful evening in the grove. The Panther, wary of wolves, decided to light a fire to keep the predators at bay while they rested. The day's accomplishments brought a sense of satisfaction and camaraderie among the group.|"['Question 1: What did Ned spot in a tree on his way back to the cabin?\nA) Wild horses\nB) Wild turkeys\nC) Deer\nD) Bears\nE) Squirrels', 'Question 2: How many turkeys did Ned shoot down with precision?\nA) One\nB) Two\nC) Three\nD) Four\nE) Five', ""Question 3: Who were Ned's companions in the passage?\nA) Fields and Carter\nB) Smith and Johnson\nC) Brown and Davis\nD) Wilson and Thompson\nE) Parker and Miller"", 'Question 4: What did Fields and Carter help bring down?\nA) Young bears\nB) Young buffalo cows\nC) Wild horses\nD) Deer\nE) Wolves', 'Question 5: What did the group work together to preserve?\nA) Buffalo meat\nB) Buffalo horns\nC) Buffalo hooves\nD) Buffalo hides\nE) Buffalo tails', 'Question 6: Why did the Panther decide to light a fire?\nA) To roast the turkeys\nB) To keep warm\nC) To scare away predators\nD) To signal for help\nE) To cook a hearty meal']"|['B) Wild turkeys', 'B) Two', 'A) Fields and Carter', 'B) Young buffalo cows', 'D) Buffalo hides', 'C) To scare away predators']
"They lit four small fires, creating a circle around their leafy beds and buffalo skins. As they worked, they spotted shadowy figures and red eyes in the trees. The Panther grabbed a blazing stick and charged at one of the figures, causing a howl of terror and a hasty retreat. ""I think I scared off the lead wolf,"" he remarked. Anticipating their return, they decided to take turns keeping watch. Ned took the first shift, relieved to have it done quickly so he could rest. Despite the eerie presence of wolves lurking nearby, Ned stayed vigilant. Later, he encountered a larger animal with red eyes, likely a hungry puma. Following the Panther's lead, Ned used a flaming torch to scare it off successfully. Proud of his accomplishment, Ned returned to rest, earning the trust and respect of his companions."|"['1.

The panther did not return, but the wolves did. Ned, now accustomed to their presence, paid them no mind. He tended to the fires until Obed took over. They hunted for days, bagging buffalo, deer, antelope, and wild turkeys. The Panther deduced that people were scarce in the area. They had a pleasant time at the cabin, feasting on game. Roylston proposed a venture to New Orleans, offering Ned and Allen a chance at a new world of commerce. Ned saw the vision of a Texan republic forming, believing Texas would not return to Mexico. The prospect stirred deep emotions, hinting at a future beyond mere money-making.|"['1.

"""You can do much for Texas there with me in New Orleans,"" said Roylston, as if he were making a final appeal to one whom he looked upon almost as a son. ""Perhaps you could do more than you can here in Texas.""

""Be it so,"" said Roylston. ""It is young blood. Never was there a truer saying than 'Young men for war, old men for counsel.' But the time may come when you will need me. When it does come send the word.""

Ned judged from Roylston's manner that dark days were ahead, but the merchant did not mention the subject again. At the end of a week, when they were amply supplied with everything except horses, the Panther decided to take Ned and Obed and go on a scout toward the Rio Grande. They started early in the morning and the horses, which had obtained plenty of grass, were full of life and vigor.

They soon left the narrow belt of forest far behind them, maintaining an almost direct course toward the southeast. The point on the river that they intended to reach was seventy or eighty miles away, and they did not expect to cover the distance in less than two days.

""It shows what the war has done,"" said the Panther. ""I rode over these same prairies about a year ago an' game was scarce, but there were some men.

They swiftly rode southward, now following a trail, keeping a keen watch for Mexican scouts. The barren winter landscape was lonely and desolate. Signs of an army passing were evident - campfire remains, horse skeletons, discarded clothing, and a broken wagon. They encountered mounds with wooden crosses marking where the wounded were buried. Approaching a woodland around a spring, evidence of Cos's forces using it as a camp was clear. The Panther examined the area closely, concluding they had stayed for several days. As they continued cautiously, Ned's sharp eyes were relied upon. They eventually sought shelter among trees, preparing for a potential encounter with the enemy. Amidst the cold wind and approaching twilight, they remained vigilant, ready for any Mexican threat.|"['1.

They spent hours in the woods, watching the sun's last red glow fade in the west, giving way to darkness and the emergence of stars. A scarlet flush appeared on the horizon, catching the Panther's attention. He informed Ned that they would ride towards it in about two miles and an hour, as the increasing darkness would aid their observations. As predicted, the night grew darker, with clouds obscuring some stars. However, the strange scarlet glow in the south intensified and expanded. Riding abreast, Ned was treated as an equal by Obed and the Panther, respected for his serious nature and eagerness to learn. They halted on a small rise, observing fires and men in the distance, hinting at a much larger force than expected. The Panther expressed concern about the Texan army's small size and the looming threat. They split up to scout the area discreetly, understanding the importance of stealth.|"[""1.

Ned rode straight ahead, reaching an arroyo with deep banks. Unsure, he remembered how they escaped before and decided to enter the arroyo. Armed and disguised in a sombrero and serape, he confidently mingled with Mexican soldiers at their camp. Sitting by a fire, he listened to their music and conversation, imitating their every move to blend in. Ned's plan was to gather information about the Mexican army's size and report back to the Texans. Despite the relaxed atmosphere, he knew the importance of being prepared.

Ned lay still, observing the many tents in the camp, indicating a more extended stay than just a day. Among the officers in bright uniforms, his eyes locked onto a heavy-set, dark man - Cos, the breaker of oaths. Accompanying him was another officer, Sesma, identified by his general's uniform. They lounged contentedly, puffing on cigarritos, seemingly at peace. Ned noticed the buzz of activity in the camp, unusual for the late hour. Cos and Sesma conversed about their arduous journey, expressing relief at not being in Santa Anna's direct command. Carlos reminisced about Santa Anna's past victories, predicting a grim fate for the Texans. Ned, troubled by the conversation, pondered the reason for the Mexican army's late-night alertness. Carlos boasted of fighting under Santa Anna's command, recalling a brutal battle that ended in victory for their leader.|"['1.

Carlos, once friendly and warm, now stood up with flashing eyes after recounting the battle of Zacatecas and the impending Texan slaughter. Ned, disguised as a Mexican, concealed his true identity under his serape and sombrero. As he overheard news of Santa Anna's imminent arrival, Ned realized the soldiers' admiration for the leader. Walking unnoticed among the campfires, Ned's attention was drawn to a group of officers, including Urrea, engaged in a lively dice game. Eavesdropping from a nearby tent, Ned listened intently as Urrea expressed his hatred towards three adversaries, including the Panther and Obed White, who had thwarted their plans. Ned remained wide awake, determined to gather more information for his mission.|"[""1.

"""Well spoken, Urrea,"" said a third man, ""but since these three are fighters and will stay to meet us, it is a certainty that our general will scoop them into his net. Then you can have all the revenge you wish.""

""I count upon it, Ambrosio,"" said Urrea, smiling. ""I also hope that we shall recapture the man Roylston. He has great sums of money in the foreign banks in our country, and we need them, but our illustrious president cannot get them without an order from Roylston. The general would rather have Roylston than a thousand Texan prisoners.""

All of them laughed, and the laugh made Ned, lying in the shadow, shiver once more. Urrea glanced his way presently, but the recumbent figure did not claim his notice. The attention of his comrades and himself became absorbed in the dice again. They were throwing the little ivory cubes upon a blanket, and Ned could hear them click as they struck together. The sharp little sound began to flick his nerves. Not one to cherish resentment, he nevertheless began to hate Urrea, and he included in that hatred the young men with him. The Texans were so few and poor. The Mexicans were so many, and they had the resources of a nation more than two centuries old.

Ned gazed at the dark and fierce face of Santa Anna, feeling the imposing presence of the Mexican leader on his majestic white horse. Santa Anna's eyes gleamed with triumph as his army gathered around him with torches ablaze, reminiscent of Napoleon before Austerlitz. The Mexican soldiers cheered as Santa Anna proclaimed his intent to crush the Texan rebels. Ned sensed Santa Anna's immense self-belief and the looming threat to Texas. Despite the fear, Ned observed the dictator interact with his generals, including the Italian officer Filisola. Amidst the crowd, Ned recognized Almonte, a Mexican colonel who had shown him kindness.

Santa Anna retired to a grand tent while other generals went to their own tents nearby. Orders for silence were given to not disturb the tired dictator.

Ned walked slowly up the arroyo, feeling the cold night. He pulled his serape closer for warmth, not disguise. Pausing to scan the darkness for danger, he was ready for anything. With control of body and mind, rifle at the ready, he continued. Suddenly, a figure emerged on the plain - a man with a rifle. Both retreated, hiding from each other.

"Ned suddenly halted at the sound of a soft whistle ahead. The tune was sweet and familiar, ""The World Turned Upside Down."" As the whistle ceased, Ned continued the melody. Feeling relieved, he emerged from the arroyo to find another figure facing him. A voice growled a warning from behind. They found their horses safe, mounted, and rode north in silence.

The horses had grazed well overnight, making them fresh and strong, swiftly covering miles towards the cabin. Plans were made as messengers would spread the news of Santa Anna's massive force advancing towards San Antonio. The urgency was clear; divided counsels had weakened the Texan army. The group urged their horses faster towards San Antonio, a crucial town left with few defenders. As they rode, it became evident they were Texans or Americans. The leader, tall and thin, with black hair and a rugged appearance, wore buckskin attire and carried a long-barreled rifle. Despite his mature demeanor, Ned found him likable, with a hint of youthful spirit. The man revealed they were Tennesseans led by Andy Jackson, coming to aid Texas in its fight for freedom. Obed, humbly accepting a compliment, expressed gratitude and unity among Texans, seeking Davy Crockett's direction.|"['1.

They moved cautiously, hearing distant rifle shots as they inched forward. The Panther's senses sharpened, his eyes showing signs of excitement at the scent of battle. Accustomed to danger, he and Crockett rode side by side, eager to investigate. The Panther suggested a scouting mission to the besieged cabin, with Obed leading the rest. Crockett, ready for action, agreed to accompany the Panther. They halted, planning a stealthy approach. As they crept closer, they witnessed gunfire ahead.

The Panther whispered to the group, alerting them that the boys in the house were wide awake, prepared for the troublemakers disturbing their peace. A shot rang out from the house, causing tension as dark figures moved through the bushes, jeopardizing their safety. The Panther devised a plan to aid the besieged Tennesseans. They advanced cautiously, tying their horses and leaving guards behind. Moving closer to the cabin, they encountered flaming arrows, a tactic used by the Comanches to set the cabin ablaze and attack. The group located the Comanches and engaged in a standoff. The defenders emerged from the cabin, joining forces with the rescuers, leading to the Comanches fleeing.

The four companions decided to return to the cabin before nightfall. They missed their friends but found comfort in the well-stocked cabin filled with buffalo, deer, and wild turkey meat. Allen suggested securing the cabin tightly, as they might need it again in the future. The Panther agreed, noting the potential danger of wolves and panthers attracted by the meat's scent. They stored provisions high up, secured the windows, and barricaded the door. Satisfied with their preparations, they rode south before turning west to warn settlements of Santa Anna's approach. As they rode, they encountered Mexican horsemen but remained undetected. The companions sought shelter in the woods as a cold wind blew, and they spotted Santa Anna's campfires in the distance, signaling his rapid advance.

The group agreed on a plan and rode south to a cluster of trees. From there, they spotted a red glow about two miles away, a sign of Santa Anna's advance. As they waited among the shadows, Ned, with his sharp eyes, scouted the plain but saw no movement. Suddenly, hooves approached from the east. Alerted, Ned turned to warn his friends when Mexican cavalry charged into the grove. Amid the chaos, Ned's quick reflexes saved him as he shot down an attacker and fled west on his horse, Old Jack. Despite the danger, he hoped his comrades, the Panther and Obed White, would escape. Dodging bullets and a lasso, Ned raced away, hearing the Mexicans closing in, eager to capture him for information.|"[""1.

Ned glanced back and saw seven or eight pursuers closing in. They had spread out, gaining ground whenever Old Jack veered. A rope flew towards them, striking the horse but missing its mark. Ned felt a rush of pride, urging Old Jack to outrun the Mexican ponies. As they raced across the moonlit plain, Ned admired the horse's flawless stride. The Mexicans, now reloading their weapons, posed a threat. Ned knew a stray bullet could be disastrous. With a quick glance, he saw the distant pursuers and urged Old Jack to run faster. Despite the resilient Mexican ponies, Old Jack raced on, his speed increasing. The pursuers persisted, taking advantage of every slight detour the horse made.

"A loud ""Crack!"" echoed as a bullet narrowly missed Ned's face, grazing Old Jack's ear and drawing blood. Reacting swiftly, Ned fired his pistol at the man aiming the musket, causing him to falter. With confidence rising, Ned urged Old Jack to run faster, skimming along the edge of a grove for cover. As he rode, the moonlight dimmed, concealing his escape. Once the danger seemed past, Ned dismounted, reloaded his weapons, and led Old Jack westward, away from the Mexicans. Exhausted and shaken, Ned and his faithful horse continued cautiously, on guard for any remaining threats.

The afternoon passed quietly for Ned as he rode across the vast prairie without encountering anyone or anything. He had hoped to meet his friends but saw no sign of them, believing their skills had kept them safe. Focusing on reaching San Antonio, Ned rode on, his horse fully recovered and moving effortlessly.

The Norther wind turned out to be a challenge for Ned. Despite his efforts, he found himself lost in the woods. Ned's hope dwindled as he realized he was off course. However, his determination and courage sparked a new sense of optimism within him. He stumbled upon a swollen river, which he recognized as the San Antonio River. Realizing that following its banks would lead him back to town, Ned felt a renewed sense of purpose. Riding alongside the river, Ned pressed forward through the snowstorm, with the San Antonio River serving as his guiding light.

Ned found great comfort and strength in his horse, believing he would have collapsed without him. It was around midnight when he forced himself to eat to preserve his strength. After a brief rest, he continued his journey by the river, recognizing familiar places from the siege of San Antonio. Suddenly, he heard the ominous sound of cannons clashing in the distance, signaling Santa Anna's army advancing. Ned, aware of the danger, hurried on, the cold wind and snow adding to the urgency. As dawn broke on the horizon, Ned realized it was Washington's birthday, a day marked by historical significance. Despite the harsh conditions, Ned and his horse, Old Jack, pressed forward towards San Antonio, the tolling church bell instilling a sense of impending doom.|"['1.

Ned reached the stream's edge, searching for a way across to San Antonio. The river's dark waters blocked his path. Dodging bushes and a steep bank, he veered away, the tolling bell fading. As the fog lifted, he spied Mexican cavalry. Recognizing Urrea, Ned's heart sank. Determined not to fail, he spurred Old Jack, racing alongside the river. But fatigue slowed the horse, and the cavalry closed in. With courage welling up, Ned made a bold decision. Wheeling Old Jack around, he spurred the horse toward the river.

Ned's serape flew off him and his rifle slipped from his grip as he and Old Jack plunged into the yellow waters. Ned resurfaced, still on the horse, feeling a chilling sensation in his veins. Despite the chaos of Mexican shouts and gunshots, Ned clung to the horse as it swam across the stream. Bullets whizzed by, one even hitting his sombrero.

When Ned spoke his final words, the sound of hooves clattering caught everyone's attention. Ned was seen racing down the narrow street towards the Main Plaza. Despite his hoarse voice, he tried to shout and galloped straight towards two familiar faces, fair-haired Bowie and swarthy Crockett. As he dismounted, water dripped from his wet hair and mud covered his face. Ned fainted, but Bowie and Crockett, trusting his word, quickly organized the garrison for defense. The Texans, initially skeptical, soon realized the imminent danger as Santa Anna's army appeared on the plain. Ned swiftly recovered, armed himself, and joined the Texans at the Alamo, where they prepared to face the approaching Mexican forces with courage and determination.|"[""1.

"Bowie remained silent. Ned's bravery returned, but he noticed how few they were. Less than 150 men, many inexperienced, headed to the Alamo. As they crossed the plain, Ned spotted a large figure approaching - Old Jack, forgotten in the rush. Ned patted his head, knowing there was no place for him in the Alamo. Old Jack seemed to want to speak, a first for him. Ned, feeling emotional, urged him to leave. Old Jack trotted away, a loyal friend. The Texans, including three women and children, reached the Alamo's walls, facing Mexican cavalry. Ned despised Urrea, once a friend, now a foe. Amidst overwhelming danger, the Texans showed no fear.

Davy Crockett, calm and collected, led the charge with Ned and a group of Texans, driving a herd towards the Alamo's plaza gate. As they approached, Mexican skirmishers attempted to stop them, but Crockett's swift action with his rifle thwarted their efforts. The Texan rifles deterred further attacks, and the group made it safely inside the Alamo, securing the heavy oak gates behind them. Crockett, optimistic about their chances in the upcoming battle, acknowledged the odds stacked against them but expressed confidence in the fortress's defenses.

Ned quickly absorbed the details of the Alamo, a historic mission over a century old. The buildings formed a cross shape, with the church lacking a roof, facing the town and river. The convent and hospital were two stories high, built of adobe bricks. A sallyport protected by a redoubt was noted at the yard's southeastern corner. The compound included a large plaza enclosed by an eight-foot wall. Ned and Crockett inspected the church, the strongest structure, with walls five feet thick. They decided to store gunpowder in the sacristy. The Texans mounted cannon on the walls but favored rifles for defense.

Santa Anna's army was advancing into San Antonio, a scene of grandeur with glinting weapons and triumphant bugle calls. Ned explored the Alamo, foreseeing a defense around the church. In a dusty storehouse, he discovered barrels filled with corn, a true treasure trove. Excited, he shared the find with Crockett. The corn would be vital for sustenance. Nearby, a stream offered water for survival. The sturdy stone walls of the church provided a sense of security. Mexicans in the town celebrated Santa Anna's arrival, visible from the parapet where Travis and Bowie stood. Crockett teased Ned about sharing all details, emphasizing unity in their dire situation.|"['1.

The sturdy wooden doors swung open, and the trio stepped outside to greet the Mexican officers on foot. The afternoon breeze was gentle, carrying a soothing touch from the south. The sky displayed a vast expanse of brilliant blue and gold, a scene etched in Ned's memory. The Mexicans paused in the middle of the plain, meeting the Texans without dismounting. Urrea, slightly ahead, exuded haughty arrogance, not bothering to alight from his horse. He proclaimed Santa Anna's overwhelming force and dominance. As the Mexicans rode towards San Antonio, the Texans returned to the Alamo. Ned, trailing behind, pondered Major Morris's unwavering confidence. He feared surrendering to Santa Anna more than defending against him. Inside the Alamo, the door was secured, and the Texans gathered atop the wall, deep in discussion. Bowie approached the cannon, firing a shot that echoed across the plain.|"['1.

The boy gazed back at San Antonio and spotted a bright red flag on the Church of San Fernando's tower. The flag unfurled rapidly, signaling no mercy from the Mexican forces. Ned felt a mix of excitement and dread. He watched the flag wave ominously, realizing the impending danger. Despite the looming threat, Ned's loyalty remained with the Texans in the Alamo. Restless, he wandered to the plaza where the cattle were kept. As he stood by the wall, thoughts of his friends and a potential surprise attack crossed his mind.

Ned glanced in the direction indicated, spotting a Mexican vaquero blending with the ground. The man clutched a coiled lasso, aiming to capture Old Jack, a valuable prize. Ned observed Old Jack hesitating, likely aware of the vaquero's intentions. The vaquero, seizing the opportunity, inched closer before launching the lasso. Old Jack swiftly evaded the rope, charging at the vaquero. The vaquero narrowly avoided the horse's hooves, fleeing in fear. Ned, reassured of safety, returned to the convent yard under the moonlight. Davy Crockett advised Ned to rest, guiding him to a spot for the night.

Ned observed the Texan leaders, Travis, Bowie, Crockett, and Bonham, overseeing the cannons. The Texans were ready at the walls and palisades, focusing on the artillery. Mexican earthworks shielded their cannons, but the Texans weren't daunted. In the face of the bombardment, they clung to their rifles. The Mexican cannons unleashed a storm of fire and smoke, yet the Texans stood unscathed. The relentless cannonade rattled Ned, but seeing his comrades unharmed bolstered his resolve.

Crockett knelt on the parapet, rifle ready, watching for any Mexican soldier. He was like a coiled animal, poised for action, seriousness replacing his usual humor. The Texans cheered as Crockett's legendary marksmanship proved true. The Mexicans, unable to advance, retreated and tried cannon fire, but the Texans remained unscathed.

"The light puffs of rifle smoke vanished quickly, revealing the town with people on flat roofs. A wind unfurled the red flag on the church tower, but Ned focused on Santa Anna's next move. ""That's a bridge that will never be built,"" remarked Davy Crockett. Bowie suggested calling for help as Santa Anna's numbers grew. Despite the opportunity, no Texan spoke of escape.

The attackers were close, and Texan rifles quickly thinned the Mexican front line. The Mexican response was chaotic, causing them to flee. Crockett noted the ease of the victory but warned against complacency. He emphasized the need for constant vigilance and fighting.

Unfortunately for the Texans, the night was the darkest of the month in San Antonio. No bonfires lit up the darkness, and there was an eerie absence of music. Ned felt a sense of foreboding, convinced that the silence and darkness hinted at enemy activity. His spirits lifted when Crockett and a young Tennessean called the Bee-Hunter joined him. Crockett, with his trademark humor, advised patience and keen observation. He shared tales of his travels from east to west, reminiscing about the sights of New York City.

"""They're getting closer, Ned. They're getting closer,"" said Crockett, who had come to the wall in front of him. ""But even at that distance, I don't think their cannon will do us much harm. Duck, boy, duck! They're going to fire!"" The two batteries opened simultaneously, and the Mexican masses in the rear began cheering loudly. Despite balls and shells falling inside the mission, the Texans remained well-covered and unharmed. The Mexican gunners stayed protected, giving the Texan riflemen little opportunity. Ned and Crockett observed the cavalry, led by Urrea. Using field glasses, they confirmed Urrea's presence. Bowie returned with a grin, leading a force that swiftly launched a surprise attack on the Mexican cavalry, outnumbered but undeterred. The Texans stood their ground, facing the charging lancers head-on. Bowie's men fired a synchronized shot, decimating the Mexican front. Despite the chaos, Urrea managed to regroup his forces."|"['1.

Crockett, a skilled speaker, honored the fallen men who died defending Texas at the Alamo. He spoke of their sacrifice for freedom, inspiring others to fight on. As he spoke, the cannons roared outside, emphasizing the danger they faced. Ned, feeling the weight of the moment, realized the grim situation as Mexican forces closed in. Mexican sharpshooters hidden in huts posed a serious threat. Crockett, recognizing the danger, devised a daring plan.

Travis hesitated, but Bowie and Crockett convinced him to proceed with the daring plan. Ned joined the troop as they gathered by the gates, torches in hand. Despite the immense risk, the men remained calm. The Texan cannon provided cover as they dashed out, surprising the Mexicans. A fierce battle ensued, with the Texans setting fires in the Mexican structures. As they raced back to the safety of the gate, they faced Mexican opposition. Despite the chaos, the Texans managed to repel their foes and secure the gate. However, the victory came at a cost, as one of their comrades, the Bee-Hunter, succumbed to his wounds.

That night, they buried their fallen comrade under the dark sky, and Ned felt a weight of sorrow heavier than ever as he returned to his post at the hospital. Despite the Texan victory that day, Ned couldn't shake a sense of impending doom. The next morning, he watched the Mexican forces expanding around the Alamo, making it impossible for the Texans to retaliate. The sound of Mexican cannons echoed ominously, adding to Ned's growing despair. Feeling a mix of sadness and frustration, Ned wrote a will, leaving his few possessions to his friends.

"""It's a little scheme you have,"" said Ned, ""to get me out of the way. You think because I'm the youngest I ought to go off alone at night and save my own life. Well, I'm not going. I intend to stay here and fight it out with the rest of you.""

The next night was dark and chilly with gusts of rain. In the afternoon the Mexican cannonade waned, and at night it ceased entirely. The Alamo itself, except for a few small lights within the buildings, was kept entirely dark in order that skulking sharpshooters without might not find a target.

Despite this, the Mexican bombardment intensified the next day, but many shells didn't explode, causing minimal damage. The Texans refrained from firing back until the Mexicans moved closer, only to be met with deadly accurate shots from Texan sharpshooters. The Mexicans retreated, leaving their fallen comrades.

Ned was deeply impressed. Crockett spoke in a similar manner, and Ned wondered if these fearless heroes had truly given up. Not in surrender, but in readiness to fight to the end. However, Ned couldn't fathom such a possibility for himself, as his youthful spirit burned strong within. On guard through the night with Crockett, they heard the sounds of the besiegers all around them. Amidst the Mexican calls and clanking metal, Crockett remained resolute, confident that their provisions and determination would withstand any assault. As they listened, Crockett's keen whistle signaled to unseen allies nearby. Soon, thirty-two Texans, led by Captain Smith, stealthily breached the walls of the Alamo. Despite their weariness, the new arrivals were greeted warmly and shared tales of their perilous journey to join the defenders.

Smith acknowledged the challenging odds against them as they faced the Mexican army led by Santa Anna. Despite the overwhelming numbers, a small reinforcement arrived, boosting the spirits of the garrison at the Alamo. Ned, part of the defenders, found solace in the fresh faces and news from the outside world. The Mexican forces had encircled the Alamo, constantly bombarding it with cannon fire. Yet, the Texan sharpshooters retaliated with precision, targeting the exposed Mexican gunners. Ned, accustomed to the bombardment, calculated his safety within the Alamo, finding reassurance in the limited risk to himself despite the constant threat.

Crockett decided they had done enough for the day, and Ned was relieved when they stepped outside to breathe fresh air. Looking out, Ned saw the familiar scene, but what stood out was the blood-red flag of no mercy flying from the church tower. Santa Anna, under the flag, observed the Alamo with his generals.

Travis hoped for reinforcements, but doubts lingered due to the vast Mexican numbers. Bonham arrived in the dead of night, bringing good news.

Fannin, a man who struggled with making decisions, appeared disheartened, but the Panther and others encouraged him to keep trying. The Panther, resembling a majestic river god, was soaked in yellow water that pooled around him, yet he remained focused on motivating the men with his fiery determination. Despite their efforts, they failed to move the cannon across the river, leading to a sense of despair. As they debated their next move, news arrived that the Alamo was under siege by Santa Anna's massive army. Fannin decided it was futile to proceed without the cannon, realizing the importance of their presence in future battles.

The Alamo stood strong, cannons roaring, rifles crackling. Ned watched the intense battle unfold, the Texans relentless in their defense. The Mexican troops, though shaken, pressed on. The Alamo was ablaze, but the Texans fought fiercely. The Mexican generals, absorbed in the spectacle, didn't notice Ned or the prisoner. The battle raged on, the Texans' rifles deadly accurate. The Mexican ranks dwindled as the Texans held their ground. Despite the chaos, Ned observed every detail, the Alamo a beacon of resistance in the face of overwhelming odds.|"['1.

The quiet that replaced the loud yelling in the town lingered. The chaos now unfolded before them, where they stood, the voices carried clearly. Ned faintly heard the guards conversing, their words revealing unease. The swift victory they anticipated at the Alamo had not materialized. The Texan rifles were relentless, causing havoc among the Mexican army. Despite the bravery of Colonel Duque's troops, they faltered under the Texan fire. The Texan cannons fell silent, leaving only the rifles to repel the Mexican assault. Ned felt immense pride witnessing his friends repel the attack. Though outnumbered, the Texans held their ground. The Mexican forces regrouped, with Santa Anna directing the assault from a safe distance. Ned's heart swelled with admiration for his comrades, standing strong against overwhelming odds.|"['1.

Ned felt his heart sink as the entire Mexican army gathered at the northern wall and charged straight at the barrier. The Texan rifles flashed deadly fire, causing the front line of the Mexican army to fall. Despite their initial retreat, the cavalry closed in, keeping the pressure on. A brief pause followed, the town fell silent, and even the Mexican soldiers stopped shouting. Smoke billowed around the buildings as the morning light transitioned from gray to golden. Ned observed the Alamo buildings silhouetted against the sun, men on the walls, and the Mexican columns consolidating their forces. As the Mexicans prepared for another charge, Ned's hope waned, realizing the Texan defenders were vastly outnumbered. The Mexicans charged once more, breaching the walls and overwhelming the Texan garrison. The Texans fought fiercely, resorting to using their rifles as clubs when they ran out of ammunition, but the Mexican forces proved too numerous.|"['1.

The Alamo was a massive eruption of fire and smoke, filled with cries and death. Those who watched fell silent, shocked by the sights and sounds. Mexican generals brought in fresh troops, attacking the fortress. A large group stormed in from the south, where defenders were scarce, overrunning the mission. The cavalry circled closer, preventing any Texan escape. Despite the grim situation, the defenders, including Travis and Bonham, continued to fight fiercely. The Texans in the hospital room held off the Mexicans until overwhelmed by a cannon blast. Travis, Bonham, and the few remaining men fought valiantly until the end. The church, the last stronghold, was under intense attack. The Texans, though outnumbered and facing a barrage of enemy fire, fought on with a determination to resist to the end. Crockett, in a fierce frenzy, stood at the church entrance, striking fear into the Mexican forces with his relentless defense.|"['1.

Ned stood still, knowing escape was futile with the ring of cavalry surrounding him. His focus was on the Alamo, where heroes like Crockett and Bowie had stood. Ned was mesmerized by the tomb despite the chaos around him. The Mexican Urrea acknowledged the Texans' fierce defense, especially Crockett's bravery. Ned was assigned guards to prevent escape, but his mind was consumed by the heroism of the fallen.

The fire blazed and consumed the grand pyramid, sinking it lower until Ned turned away. His elation faded, replaced by overwhelming grief and despair. His mind rebelled against Santa Anna's cruelty, fate, and the vast Mexican forces. Meanwhile, San Antonio de Bexar celebrated Santa Anna's triumph, believing Texas conquered. While some Mexican officers grieved their losses, Santa Anna reveled in his glory, envisioning an empire. He wasted no time, dispatching orders to subdue the Texans. He sent Mrs. Dickinson, a widow spared by Almonte, to deliver a proclamation to Gonzales.

Ned, hiding on the roof, relied on mescal and the soldiers' lack of enthusiasm to stay safe. He overheard them below but then silence. Ned stayed put, feeling secure from prying eyes. Ned knew the Mexicans wouldn't search abandoned homes at night. Ned heard distant shouts from the streets. The Mexican loss at the Alamo didn't trouble Bexar's residents much. Ned thought he might have dozed off. As the sun set, the Alamo vanished into darkness. Ned left the roof, aiming to avoid town lights. He slipped through unnoticed, heading to the Alamo. Ned cleverly guessed Mexicans would avoid the Alamo at night due to superstitions. He planned to find a rifle there. Inside, Ned found a rifle, powder, bullets, and food.

He rode away, but the five friends continued toward the Alamo, now without hope but determined to see for themselves. Deep in the dark night, heavy clouds hid the moon and stars as they neared San Antonio from the east. Lights from the town were visible, but darkness enveloped where the Alamo stood. They tied their horses in bushes and approached quietly until they saw the dim outline of the Alamo, devoid of any light or sound. The Panther decided to go alone over the wall, leaving the others waiting anxiously. He returned, revealing the horrors inside - rooms splattered with red blood.

In the middle of the afternoon, Will Allen and his companions spotted a lone figure on horseback accompanied by another person in the distance. The bright sun cast a glow over the figures as they rode closer. The woman on the horse seemed exhausted, trying to urge her horse faster. The Texans, recognizing her distress, galloped up to her. Obed White helped her and her baby down from the horse. The woman, visibly shaken, shared her harrowing experience of witnessing the fall of Crockett and Bowie during the battle. The Texans, including the Panther, vowed to avenge their fallen comrade. The woman explained how she was sent by Santa Anna with a proclamation to the Texans.

Ned's nature toughened as he ran, consumed by thoughts of vengeance for the Alamo. Convinced the Texans would rally at Harrisburg or Goliad, he slowed, conserving energy. Overwhelmed by fatigue, he sought rest under a sprawling oak. Six miles from San Antonio, he succumbed to sleep. Nature revived him slowly, healing his body. As the sun rose, a large animal approached but did not disturb him. Startled awake by sunlight, he found his rifle and saw Old Jack, his loyal horse, trotting towards him. Overjoyed, Ned embraced his faithful companion, tears welling in his eyes.|"[""1.

Ned found a horse, Old Jack, and crafted a makeshift halter to ride him without a saddle. He rode towards Goliad, hunting and cooking a wild turkey. Despite the risk of attracting attention with a fire, he trusted Old Jack to alert him. Ned continued riding through the desolate prairie, encountering deer and turkeys but focusing on finding other people. He eventually came across a large Mexican trail, leading him to a camp of twelve to fifteen hundred men. Ned realized this was a separate force from Santa Anna's, likely aiming to further weaken Texas. He observed the camp from a distance, aware of the danger but determined to gather information.|"['1.

Ned rode a wide loop around the camp and continued his journey into the night. He had to pause and rest briefly as morning approached, but as soon as daylight broke, he resumed his ride to warn unknown individuals. A couple of hours later, he spotted two riders on the horizon and rode towards them. Realizing they were Texans, not Mexicans, he approached them. They were hunters from Refugio town. Ned shared his experiences from the Alamo and the imminent threat from General Urrea's forces. The Texans, Oldham and Jackson, accompanied him to Refugio to inform Captain King and his men. Ned, grateful for their company, shared the Alamo's fate and the approaching Mexican cavalry. Seeking refuge, they hurried to the stone church, converting it into a temporary fortress. Despite leaving his horse behind, Ned joined the others in securing the church against the looming threat.|"['1.

The sturdy stone church, fortified against Indian attacks, became a battleground as Ned and a group of men defended it against Mexican cavalry. With rifles in hand, they repelled the charging horsemen, forcing them to seek shelter. Ned, experienced from the Alamo, knew the cavalry was a mere distraction. He advised Captain King to seek reinforcements from Fannin. A messenger was dispatched through the oak forest. Inside the church, the defenders were well-provisioned for a siege, but Ned anticipated the Mexicans would not delay. Despite doubts about Fannin's ability to send aid, Ned's leadership inspired confidence among the men. As memories of the Alamo haunted him, Ned remained resolute in the face of adversity, ensuring the defenders were prepared for the impending conflict.|"['1.

He heard the sound of gunfire and saw Mexican cavalry firing from the woods. The bullets hit the church walls harmlessly. To show they were alert, six defenders fired back, hitting three of the enemy. The Mexicans retreated, and the defenders waited. Ned, aware of the danger, knew the Mexican army was advancing. Young Urrea, leading the cavalry, rode forward with a white flag. Ned admired his courage but knew the flag might not protect them. Ned, tired from the day, slept despite shots fired. At midnight, King woke him, and Ned slipped out to spy on the approaching Mexican forces. He cautiously made his way around the village, encountering Old Jack. Approaching the woods, he saw most Mexicans asleep, with only a few sentinels guarding.|"['1.

He traveled a few miles west, but seeing no signs of the main group, he headed back to the church. Initially, he had circled the woods to the south, and now he returned via the north for a thorough check. With night falling and a clear starry sky, he hastened his steps to avoid being caught outside after dark. The open prairie offered little cover as he moved between patches of forest. Suddenly, he heard approaching horse hooves, realizing Mexican cavalrymen were riding towards him. Dodging musket shots and evading a lasso, he managed to fire back, hitting one of the riders. Recognizing Urrea leading the group, he sought refuge in a nearby grove, reloading his rifle while the enemy searched the area. As they closed in, he made a swift escape, darting towards safety in the next grove.|"[""1.

Ned, filled with hatred for Urrea, fired his pistol in return, but the bullet struck the horse instead of its rider. Urrea was thrown violently over his head and lay motionless. Ned quickly reached the second wood, not caring about Urrea's condition. The horsemen hesitated without their leader to urge them on, fearing Ned's rifle skills. Ned reloaded and headed to the mission, hearing Mexican troops searching for him. He arrived safely, suggesting retreat before being surrounded.

Ned climbed the wall and saw over a hundred Texans approaching. They joined the defenders in the church, led by Colonel Ward. A council was held, where Ned expressed his concern about the Mexican forces. Many new recruits, eager for adventure, were present. Despite Ned's suggestion to retreat, the leaders decided to wait until morning. Ned, feeling uneasy, stayed on the wall, watching the Mexican camp. He heard a faint sound approaching from the south.

Ned warned Colonel Ward about the Mexican army led by General Urrea, but when Ward looked, the Mexicans disappeared. Ned, knowing the danger, kept watch. When King and his scouts were attacked, Ward bravely led his men out to help. Despite being outnumbered, the Texans fought fiercely, causing chaos among the Mexican forces. Ned realized the entire Mexican army was there, surrounding them. Even though they were in a dire situation, the Texans stood their ground, firing back at the enemy.

Ned's truth soon became clear to all. The Texan rifles were the only thing stopping the Mexican cavalry from overtaking and defeating them. The Texans, though facing shorter-range musket fire, fought quickly and skillfully, causing the pursuing Mexicans to retreat after losing a dozen men. The Texans then sought refuge inside the mission, barricading the door. Despite the Mexican bullets, they held their ground. Ned, noticing a cannon being wheeled out by the Mexicans, assured Ward that it wouldn't breach the walls. The Texans' sharpshooters easily neutralized the cannon threat. The Mexicans, regrouping, charged the church with wooden bars to break the door, but the Texan rifles forced them back again. Victory seemed close, but Ned knew the Mexicans wouldn't give up easily.|"[""1.

Ned kept his plan to himself until nightfall when the lack of ammunition was revealed to all the men. Disheartened by the shortage, they were eager to leave the church under the cover of darkness and head towards Victoria to reunite with Fannin. Despite the risk of Mexican patrols, they set out quietly, leaving behind the wounded. As they slipped away, a Mexican horseman spotted them, alerting the others. A brief skirmish ensued, but the Texans managed to break through and escape into the forest and over the prairie. Although pursued briefly, they eluded the Mexican forces and found a temporary refuge by a creek. Ned scouted the area, ensuring their safety for the time being.

They traveled all day towards Victoria to meet Fannin. By nightfall, they were tired and stopped in a forest. Setting up camp near a creek, the hunters brought back two deer, lifting the spirits of the group. Excited to meet Fannin and seek revenge on the Mexicans, the recruits felt hopeful for a fair fight. Despite the optimism, Ned, one of the group, felt uneasy. He woke early, noticing no signs of pursuit. The Mexicans had taken a different route to Victoria, leaving Ward and his men low on ammunition. The Texans sought refuge in the Guadalupe swamps, but the Mexican forces closed in. With ammunition and food scarce, Ned decided to separate from the group, preparing to swim across the river with his remaining rounds.

Ned found himself in a dire situation. After navigating through swamps and evading capture, exhaustion and illness began to take hold. Despite his determination, he realized he was suffering from extreme fatigue or possibly malaria. Shivering with cold, he sought refuge in a dense thicket, wrapping himself tightly in his blankets. The once strong and resilient Ned now felt weak and despondent, unable to eat or find comfort. His surroundings appeared distorted, and he could sense a deep ache in his bones. Knowing he needed rest, he settled down for the night, hoping to regain strength before continuing his journey towards Goliad to seek out Fannin.|['1.

Despite his warm clothing and blankets, the boy grew colder and colder. His teeth chattered, and he shivered uncontrollably. His head throbbed with intense pain, and even the slightest light hurt his eyes. He felt utterly miserable, lost in both body and soul. The pain in his head was so severe that life hardly seemed worth living. Eventually, he fell into a daze, vaguely aware of lying in a thicket in vast Texas. He was too weak to defend himself against any potential threats like cougars or bears. The idea of being found by anyone, even a million Mexicans, did not faze him. As his intense chill subsided, a fever took over, causing unbearable heat and unconsciousness. When he awoke the next day, he felt overwhelming fatigue and realized he was a shadow of his former self. Despite his weakness and dizziness, he mustered the strength to gather his belongings and survey the desolate landscape around him, resigned to whatever fate awaited.|"['1.

Young Fulton, though not hungry due to illness, felt the need to eat. He found berries in the thickets that slightly restored his strength. Determined to find more substantial food, he searched for game. Walking towards a water-course indicated by a line of oaks, he felt dizzy and weak. After reaching the shade of the oaks, he drank water, rested, and hunted squirrels. Despite exhaustion, he successfully kindled a fire and cooked a squirrel. Feeling stronger, he continued cautiously up the creek. Alert for signs of illness, he settled in a thicket, eventually falling asleep. Waking at dawn, he felt well, relieved that the chill did not return. He hunted again, conserving his bullets, and continued his journey cautiously, encountering Mexican cavalry, indicating he was on the right path towards Fannin.|['1.

It was challenging for Ned to travel, especially with only four bullets in his pouch. The creek was his only advantage, guiding his path. Hiding in the timber along the creek, he felt safe, even though Mexican soldiers passed close by. Hearing distant rifle shots, Ned sensed a battle. Determined to join Fannin's fight against Santa Anna, Ned ran towards the firing. As he reached a plain with a creek on one side and timber on the other, he saw Mexican cavalry galloping nearby. Realizing Fannin might be trapped, fear gripped Ned, knowing the odds were against them. Despite his fear, Ned raced towards the battle, hoping to aid Fannin and his men.|"[""1.

"He observed a gap in the firing at one part of the ring in the saucer and steered towards it. Upon spotting men and horses in motion, he raised his hands and shouted, ""I come in peace! Hold your fire!"" A rifle aimed at him was deflected by a hand. Moments later, he arrived at the camp, supported by friendly hands as he nearly collapsed from exhaustion. Regaining his composure, he confirmed his location with Fannin's group, under pressure from Urrea's troops. Introducing himself as Edward Fulton, an Alamo survivor, he recounted his escape and subsequent encounters. Surveying the beleaguered troops, he noted their weariness but unwavering resolve.

The Mexican soldiers charged again, but the Texan recruits drove them back once more. Despite the victory, the recruits were still surrounded. The Mexicans regrouped and launched a third attack with infantry and cavalry closing in. The Texans, armed with rifles, fought fiercely, but the Mexican troops showed remarkable courage and determination. General Urrea led the cavalry, bringing the battle dangerously close. Ned and his fellow recruits, bonded by the intensity of the fight, fired rapidly into the enemy ranks. The Texans unleashed a devastating volley, causing chaos among the Mexican forces. The Mexican infantry and cavalry retreated, leaving behind fallen comrades. The Texans also suffered casualties, including their leader, Fannin.

Ned's weakness had faded, and he sat up, noticing the Mexican horsemen circling them from afar, with their army waiting behind. Fannin's men were surrounded, and Ned believed Urrea's forces would now wait after their losses. Ned felt strong again, but thirsty. A fellow youth offered water, which Ned accepted modestly, knowing its value. Suddenly, shots rang out, hitting some Texans. Ned realized they were under attack by Campeachy Indians, expert marksmen. Fannin ordered his best riflemen to counter the attack. The Indians, fierce and deadly, continued to shoot from cover, causing casualties. The Mexican officers observed the chaos with satisfaction.|"[""1.

Ned, though not as skilled as famous sharpshooters, Panther and Davy Crockett, was improving steadily. Spotting an enemy head, he fired accurately, feeling a rush of triumph. Other sharpshooters joined in, targeting foes with precision. Despite Indian attacks, the white marksmen retaliated effectively. Ned, fueled by anger toward the Mexicans, fired relentlessly. The battle was intense, with hidden foes exchanging gunfire. As the Indians retreated, silence fell. The wounded endured quietly, tended by comrades. Oxen lay slain, and Ned pitied their fear.

The Texan sharpshooters, tired but determined, resumed their mission. Unable to spot the Indians, they relied on a clever tactic used in border warfare. Whenever an Indian fired, a puff of smoke revealed their location. The Texans swiftly aimed at the smoke and often hit their targets. This hidden gunfight lasted for hours. The Indians targeted the mass in the hollow, while the Texans aimed at the more challenging foes. The scared cattle moaned in fear, becoming targets themselves. The Texans mercifully put down the wounded animals to end their suffering. With their exceptional marksmanship, the Texans outmatched the Indians in the dark, forcing them to retreat to the Mexican cavalry. The night was unusually dark and foggy, concealing the sky.

Ned stood near Fannin, able to see his pale face in the dark. Fannin's eyes lit up at his men's bravery but lacked wisdom. Fannin understood the difficulty of leaving wounded comrades to the enemy. The men chose to stay and built defenses using spades and oxen bodies. Despite exhaustion, hunger, and thirst, they worked through the night. Ned, feeling despair, kept his fears to himself. As dawn approached, they saw the Mexican army ready for battle. With little ammunition, food, or water, they were trapped. Ned realized their fate and prepared for the inevitable battle.

The sun rose high, casting a golden glow over the plain. Ned spotted a dark line in the distance, Mexican cavalry riding to reinforce Urrea's troops. Mexican cannons were positioned, while the Texan cannons were useless. The Texans, low on ammunition, were defenseless against the Mexican fire. Fannin, wounded but determined, called a council. Despite the odds, some hoped to fight through, but surrender seemed inevitable due to the Mexican numbers and their own weakened state. A white flag signaled a parley with the Mexicans.

"They met halfway between the camps, and Urrea stepped forward. He gave Ned a quick look that made the boy squirm inside. The young Mexican was polite, but Ned sensed a cruel streak beneath his smile. ""I greet you as worthy opponents,"" said Urrea in clear English, removing his hat. ""My fellow officers are Colonel Salas, Lieutenant Colonel Holzinger, and Lieutenant Gonzales.

Urrea remained silent, refraining from boasting about their victory over the Texans. Ned sensed his triumph and returned to his uncle's camp. The Texan weapons were taken on wagons, and the defeated Texans, unarmed and on foot, left the hollow. The injured were supported by their comrades as they trudged towards the Mexican camp, hoping for food and water. However, General Urrea ordered them to proceed to Goliad. Exhausted and thirsty, they continued their march, flanked by Mexican cavalry who taunted them. Young Urrea, leading the guard, rode near Ned, provoking him with his presence. The prisoners, realizing they had fallen into a trap, marched on with a sense of gloom. Ned observed the Mexican women and children celebrating their victory as they reached Goliad.

Ned listened to Urrea's words of assurance, feeling a sense of unease. He observed Urrea closely, trying to decipher his true intentions beneath his polite façade. As the recruits sang in the dim church, Ned's mind was clouded with worry. The recruits, oblivious to the tension, shared laughter and chatter, awaiting their imminent freedom. At dawn, the guards provided meager rations, signaling their impending release. When the officers appeared, led by Urrea, Ned sensed an ominous atmosphere. The recruits were divided into three groups under Urrea's command, each assigned a different task. Despite the jovial goodbyes, Ned couldn't shake off his apprehension, especially noticing the unease among Urrea's superiors. The recruits dispersed, unaware of the impending arrival of Santa Anna's troops, leaving Ned with a lingering sense of foreboding.|"[""1.

"Ned, positioned near the front of the largest column, observed the Mexican colonels' nervousness as they left the arrangements to Urrea. The Mexican women in the town pitied the prisoners, calling them ""pobrecitos."" As they marched, Ned noticed the cavalry led by Urrea closely following. Suspicious of the Mexicans, Ned scrutinized every detail. Suddenly, Urrea ordered a halt. The Mexican infantry encircled the prisoners, firing upon them at close range. Chaos ensued as bodies fell, screams filled the air, and the Mexicans ruthlessly attacked. Ned felt a surge of madness amidst the horror. The scene was a blur of groans, gunfire, and death.

Ned witnessed a horrific scene as he escaped into the woods. The sound of gunfire and shouting from the Mexicans continued, but the cries of the fallen recruits faded. Despite being grazed by a couple of shots, Ned found strength in the chaos. Approaching the green trees, he encountered a horseman, engaging in a fierce struggle. With a burst of energy, Ned triumphed, leaping into the safety of the forest. Running for a long time, he reached the San Antonio River, where he found refuge. The day marked a tragic event, with hundreds falling victim to the merciless orders of Santa Anna.

"Five men, or four men and a boy, rode cautiously along the San Antonio River, staying hidden among the trees. They were all notable figures, with three of them having gained fame across Texas. Leading the group was a huge man named Martin Palmer, also known as the Panther. His companions were ""Deaf"" Smith, Henry Karnes, Obed White, and Will Allen. The group, riding as freelancers due to the lack of organized authority in Texas, had been scouting near Goliad. They heard gunfire from the town, suspecting that Fannin's men were making a last stand. Despite facing strong Mexican patrols, they hoped to find a Texan group to join forces with.

As they rode, they searched for a trail, keen to uncover who had passed and why. Eventually, they found hoofprints by the river, suggesting a group of riders had crossed. Following the tracks, they realized they were made by unshod horses, likely ridden by Indians aiding the Mexicans after the events at Goliad. Continuing cautiously, they spotted a painted feather, confirming their suspicions. Riding near the San Antonio, they noticed bear and deer tracks but were focused on a human footprint near the riverbank. The group split up to search the forest, hoping to find the fugitive Texan who had escaped from Goliad.
