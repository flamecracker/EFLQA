In a room filled with coils of steel wire, a man unwrapped them to reveal wires of different thicknesses. The wire, long coiled up, was not straight. As a machine chopped wire-strips, a man collected them and placed them in an oven. In another room, a man hammered the wire on a stone block. In a separate area, a woman straightened curly needles using a hammer and a steel block. Upstairs, girls organized bright needles on a table. They placed the needles side by side, heads in one direction and points in another. A wise fruit grower creates holes in garden walls for sparrows to nest, as they help protect the fruit. Another method mentioned was to place clean water near trees to prevent birds from eating the fruit.|['1.

Ragged little Johnnie and his brother Ben, laden with wild-flowers, are merry little men. Kate and Mat gather bright posies, while Tim, their tiny brother at home, is obliged to stay. They roamed the meadow and scoured the wood for nuts and blackberries, their pleasant food. Now, on a mossy hedge-bank, they take their ease, enjoying nuts, blackberries, bread, and cheese. Drinking from the crystal-clear brooklet under the hawthorn tree, they listen to the thrush's music. After tea, the children sow cress and mustard seeds on corks and flannel to watch roots and leaves sprout. Dora examines mint, parsley, thyme, and sage leaves to see their differences.

Long ago, coal was different from what we know today. It didn't break into sharp pieces but sliced neatly along straight lines. Imagine trees that were once huge ferns and horse-tails towering like trees! As the coal turned red and hot, children gazed into the fire and saw shapes of men, dogs, rocks, hills, and even a fiery-eyed cat with a curly tail. This cat, like lions and tigers, is a predator, but unlike them, it's domesticated. It uses its rough tongue to drink milk and groom itself, and its whiskers help it navigate in the dark. Dogs, on the other hand, are also carnivores but are less aggressive than wolves or foxes. They have strong teeth for eating meat, bones, and even bread and veggies.|['1.

Slate and chalk are both natural resources that play essential roles in everyday life. Slate, a sturdy and brittle stone, is often used for roofing houses and making smooth surfaces for writing.

Additionally, chalk is processed into lime and whiting, which are used for cleaning walls and ceilings. Chalk is also commonly used for writing on blackboards. These resources are obtained from hills and quarries, showcasing how nature provides materials for various human needs.|['1.

Mice are small creatures with sharp teeth that gnaw through walls and floors to make nests. They come out quietly to look for food like crumbs, sometimes sneaking into pantries. Rabbits, on the other hand, live where there is plenty of furze to eat, causing mischief in fields by eating young corn and tree bark. Turnips grow in fields and gardens, with most of the vegetable hidden underground. Hens, domestic birds, find their own food in fields and are also fed by humans. Sparrows, small birds with brown and gray feathers, build nests on houses. Wasps live in large groups, with different roles like laying eggs, building nests, guarding, and cleaning.|['1.
