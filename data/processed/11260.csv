Long ago, on Saint John's Eve, the Danes conquered Ireland, placing a soldier in every house. The people, led by Brian Boroihme, rebelled and lit fires to signal the soldiers' end. Brian's son, Murrough, continued his legacy. The Danes, defeated in a chess game at Clontarf, left Ireland with hens and weasels. Later, King Henry was urged by the Pope to protect Ireland from Druids and Danes. Dervorgilla's actions brought English rule through MacMurrough. Despite the English laws, some fear they will rise from their graves.

In a town named Calais, a woman met her end while chained on the floor for three days and nights. The Archbishop urged her to eat, but she refused, saying no one could see the chains.

On the final night, a stench emerged, causing illness and death to many in London. The storyteller then shares a tale about a lady taken by fairies, who returned to her husband's land with a child.

Cromwell, a historical figure known for his ruthless actions, once encountered a White Friar who predicted the duration of his rule in Ireland. Despite Cromwell's intimidating presence, the Friar cleverly delayed meeting him until he deemed it safe. Cromwell, impressed by the Friar's foresight, granted him freedom. Cromwell's reign in Ireland, as foretold by the Friar, lasted until a significant date. Cromwell's harsh rule included clearing roads and intimidating opponents. He enforced strict laws and instilled fear in the Catholic population.

Many notable individuals paid attention to dreams in history, despite the Church's current disapproval. Joseph, as mentioned in Scripture, heeded his dream. However, Colonel Merell ignored his, leading to his demise. The Battle of Aughrim could have had a different outcome if not for excessive alcohol given to Irish soldiers, alongside spies and traitors. English victories in Ireland were often achieved through espionage and pitting communities against each other, rather than fair combat. The narrator recounts visiting the Aughrim battlefield and observing the tree where St. Ruth met his end due to betrayal by a Colonel's daughter. The Danes celebrated their enemies' defeat, as their ancestors had been expelled from Ireland before. The Stuarts, on the other hand, faced criticism for their perceived cowardice, particularly James II, who fled from battle. Conversely, Sarsfield's cunning tactics, like changing his horse's shoes to mislead pursuers, earned him acclaim as a skilled general.|"['1.

Daniel O'Connell, a remarkable figure in Irish history, was known for his courage and intelligence. Once, at a party in England, a servant girl warned him in Irish that his cup contained poison meant to harm the nation. O'Connell, understanding her, switched cups with a man who soon fell dead.

Daniel O'Connell was a remarkable man who dedicated his life to helping the poor and fighting for Ireland's rights. A monument in Ennis stands tall in his honor, depicting him holding a book. This monument, funded by a humble shoemaker, serves as a tribute to O'Connell's legacy. O'Connell was known for his generosity towards children, often giving them the pledge to uphold. His impact was profound, evident in the removal of injustices at Saint Patrick's Island. In contrast, Shiel, though unassuming in appearance, possessed a powerful voice that revealed his genius when he spoke. The abolition of the Tithes, a tax on the land, marked a significant shift in power dynamics. The Pope's authority, especially during a specific moment each year, underscores the influence of religion on global affairs. The burial of the Tithes atop the Devil's Bit symbolized a protest against religious inequalities.|"[""1.

During the Tithe War, a fierce battle erupted at Carrickshock. The people defended a narrow passage against the police accompanying the Proctor. A Captain, a veteran of the Battle of Waterloo, protected the Proctor, who was the target of the people's anger. Tragically, the Captain fell, and fourteen police officers lost their lives. The accused were brought to court, facing a grim trial led by Crown counsel Dougherty. However, O'Connell intervened, challenging the unjust proceedings. He successfully defended the accused, preventing them from being unjustly punished. The Tithes, a source of great contention, led to the organizing of hurling matches to resist them. The Big Wind of '39 and subsequent events like the Famine and cholera outbreak left lasting scars on the community, with tales of hardship and loss echoing through the generations.|"[""1.

Thomas Davis was a renowned poet in Ireland, often compared to Thomas Moore. He passed away prematurely during the tumultuous '48 period when Irish rebels sought funds from O'Connell to oppose English rule. O'Connell, having used the money for personal matters, denied having any left. Despite achieving Emancipation, O'Connell faced criticism and eventually left for Genoa, similar to Napoleon's ambition. The rebels, lacking support, attempted an uprising led by Smith O'Brien but were ill-equipped and hungry. The rebellion failed, resulting in O'Brien's capture and exile to Australia. Mitchell, another rebel, emphasized the need for action over mere discussions.

One remarkable event I witnessed near Kinvara was during a funeral procession when a disguised man, O'Gorman Mahon, dressed as a lady, drove past without acknowledging the funeral. He was escaping from the authorities and made his getaway by boat. In another instance, during the Fenian times, Clerkenwell prison in London was destroyed, and all its prisoners perished. A man named Kane, a committed teetotaler, received a medal from Father Mathew, which he treasured for 70 years. Despite losing the medal temporarily, he found it later. My husband, a veteran of the Crimean War, endured extreme hardships, including lack of food and shelter. He received medals for his service but felt neglected by the government.

There was a young Napoleon, the grandson of Napoleon the First, who was a remarkable man. I visited the island where he was buried, a grand place with two blackthorn bushes at the entrance to his tomb. The mere fear of Napoleon was said to be deadly. Imagine if he were alive today, the world might be entirely French with no English left. The young Napoleon, a tall and striking figure, met a mysterious end during the Zulu war.
