The rapid growth of the United States in the last fifty years has led to significant changes, particularly in the West where transformation has been swift and remarkable. The disappearance of the frontier has brought about a loss of old freedoms and opportunities, especially affecting farmers who now find themselves in complex industrial areas. This shift has sparked protests among farmers seeking to improve their circumstances. These movements, from the Granger movement to the battle for free silver, represent stages of an ongoing agrarian crusade. Oliver Hudson Kelley, a key figure in this movement, observed the struggles of Southern farmers after the Civil War and initiated efforts to address their challenges. Kelley's trip through the South highlighted the need for social change and modernization in agriculture to combat the monotony and apathy prevalent among farmers.|"['1.

Kelley, a man of action, noticed social issues and sought solutions. He proposed a secret order for farmers, the Grange, for intellectual growth. With his niece's insight, women were included. Kelley and six others founded the Grange, focusing on education and unity. They avoided political ties, emphasizing social and intellectual progress. The Grange aimed to educate farmers, not legislate for them. The organization grew slowly due to initial missteps and farmer skepticism. Kelley dedicated himself to expanding the Grange, facing financial struggles. Despite hardships, the Grange slowly gained traction. Kelley's persistence and dedication were crucial in overcoming challenges and establishing the Grange as a platform for agricultural advancement and community building.|"[""1.

Despite facing numerous challenges, Kelley persisted in his efforts to promote the Patrons of Husbandry organization. He strategically used photographs and letters to create a strong image of the organization, comparing its promotion to that of a patent medicine. By writing articles, persuading agricultural papers to publish Grange information, and inserting press notices, Kelley successfully established the first Granges in Iowa and Minnesota. The practical appeal of the Grange, focusing on protection against corporations and cooperative opportunities, proved more effective in attracting members. With Kelley's dedication and effective communication, the Grange expanded rapidly, penetrating multiple states by the end of 1871. Despite initial indifference from the National Grange members, Kelley's unwavering commitment and tireless correspondence led to significant growth and establishment of the organization in various states.|"['**1.

Grant's critics argued that he was too authoritarian for a democratic leader, particularly due to his forceful approach to Reconstruction in the South. This policy faced backlash from Northern Republicans who saw it as a means for corruption by freedmen and carpetbaggers. Congress passed a strict act in 1871 allowing the President to suspend habeas corpus and use the military to suppress disturbances, giving radical governments in the South excessive power. Dissatisfaction led to the Liberal-Republican movement in 1872, with figures like Carl Schurz advocating for political reform. However, the movement faced challenges, including disagreements on tariffs and the selection of Horace Greeley as the presidential nominee, who alienated both Democrats and tariff reformers. Ultimately, Grant was reelected due to divisions within the opposition.|"['1.

During the period from 1870 to 1873, the Liberal Republican party faced challenges due to the selection of their candidate. The movement primarily attracted leaders rather than the masses, focusing on political disability removal in the South and civil service reform, which did not resonate with Western farmers. These farmers were more concerned about economic reforms like tax reduction, regulating corporations, controlling transportation costs, and increasing currency supply. While some Western Liberals supported the farmers' cause, Eastern leaders like Schurz and Trumbull distanced themselves. The era was marked by prosperity for commercial and manufacturing sectors but brought depression for farmers due to oversupply, falling prices, high interest rates, and currency fluctuations. The panic of 1873 worsened the situation, leading to financial hardships, foreclosures, and limited access to loans, prompting farmers to blame corporations and railroads for their plight.|"['1.

By 1873, the Government had given the railroads roughly thirty-five million acres of land. Additionally, the Pacific railroads were promised about one hundred and forty-five million more acres. As land became scarcer, farmers were upset that railroads owned vast amounts of valuable land, either holding it for speculation or selling it at high prices. Farmers who invested in railroad stocks often lost their investments as railroads merged or went bankrupt. Farmers had little political representation, leading them to form the Grange as a way to fight against perceived injustices. Despite opposition, the Grange rapidly spread, particularly in Iowa, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Mississippi. The movement faced hurdles in the East due to competition between Eastern and Western farmers and the formation of Granges by commission men and merchants. In 1873, the Grange underwent leadership changes, ushering in a period of significant growth.|['1.

"By the end of 1873, the Grange had spread to all but four states, with thirty-two state Granges established. The movement gained national significance, evident in the seventh annual session held in St. Louis in February 1874. Thirty-three men and twelve women attended, representing half a million members from thirty-two state and territorial Granges. The National Grange adopted the ""Declaration of Purposes,"" outlining goals to benefit their Order, Country, and Mankind. Their efforts focused on improving homes, advancing education, diversifying crops, and promoting cooperation in buying and selling. The Patrons aimed to combat monopolies and high freight tariffs, advocating for fair practices. The Grange's influence led to the formation of farmers' clubs with political aims, marking the farmers' entry into politics. New parties emerged in Western States, demanding railroad regulation and government reform. Illinois played a key role in these political movements, influencing railway legislation and judicial elections."|"['1.

"In 1873, farmers in Illinois launched a strong campaign to elect candidates who would represent their interests in the county elections. The day was known as the ""Farmers' Fourth of July,"" typically a day of joy and celebration for farmers. However, in 1873, the tone shifted to serious matters. Farmers denounced corporations, read a Farmers' Declaration of Independence, and vowed to fight against monopolies and corruption in government. This movement led to the formation of new political parties that challenged the existing system. Despite temporary successes, these independent parties eventually faded away, but they laid the groundwork for future reform movements in the Midwest. Leaders like William R. Taylor emerged from humble beginnings, showing that farmers could have a significant impact on politics with determination and dedication."|"['1.

In 1873, Taylor's political experience led him to the state senate. As president of the State Agricultural Society, he headed the new Liberal Reform party. The brewing interests, upset by a temperance law, supported Taylor, leading to his election as governor. He vigorously enforced Granger railroad laws and even celebrated a court win with artillery fire. Despite this, he retired after losing reëlection in 1875. Few farmers from the Granger era remained in public affairs afterward. Ignatius Donnelly of Minnesota was a notable exception. A strong personality, he opposed slavery and supported progressive laws. His popularity grew, causing concern among Republicans. Donnelly eventually broke from the party and supported the farmers' Granges, becoming a key figure in the Anti-Monopoly movement.|"[""1.

Donnelly, once a farmer, entrusted his farm to his capable wife, dedicating himself to politics, literature, and lecturing. His lectures and writings showcased his remarkable industry. Engaging in various roles like Democrat, Republican, and lecturer, he was a force in politics. The Grange, non-political but influential, aided in radical railroad legislation. Before the Grange, farmers were isolated and suspicious. The Grange fostered trust, enabling farmers to unite for common causes. Farmers' resentment towards railroads, fueled by the Grange, led to its growth. While some animosity was unfounded, railroads did exploit farmers. The battle in Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin centered on state regulation of railroads. States like Wisconsin and Minnesota sought to control corporations early on. Iowa reserved rights over lands granted to railroads. These states argued for control over railroads as they were vital public services.|"['1.

The fight for railroad regulation in Illinois began in 1869 when the legislature passed a law aiming to limit railroad rates to fair and uniform levels. However, the lack of clear rate guidelines made the law ineffective. In 1870, the state constitution was amended to direct the legislature to pass laws preventing unfair rates and discrimination. Subsequent acts established maximum passenger fares and based freight charges on distance, aiming to prevent rate increases. Despite resistance from railroad companies, the Act of 1873 introduced measures to regulate rates and prevent extortion. Similar laws were enacted in Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin, but faced opposition from railroad companies. The conflict between farmers and railroads led to the establishment of laws that were eventually upheld by the courts, setting the foundation for railroad regulation in many states.|['1.

During the 1870s, the railroads used subtle methods to influence legislators. They gave favors to lawmakers who supported them, like free passes in Iowa. Lobbyists posing as farmers also worked for the railroads. The railroads fought against laws that regulated them, making them seem unfavorable. Lawsuits were brought to the Supreme Court, but many shippers were afraid to challenge the railroads. In response to laws like the Granger laws, the railroads raised rates and reduced services, causing public backlash. Eventually, most Granger laws were repealed, but the idea of regulating railroads continued to grow. The Supreme Court upheld the right of states to regulate businesses like railroads for the public good. This conflict between railroads and farmers laid the groundwork for future railroad regulations across the United States.|"['1.

In the railroad cases, the courts established principles that are crucial in business and politics today. The courts affirmed the right of states to set maximum charges for public businesses like railroads. Despite this, the courts now review if rates set by laws are fair and not unjustly depriving property owners. The Granger decisions in the 1870s laid the foundation for state regulation of railroads. The Grange, a farmers' organization, peaked in 1874 but declined rapidly due to rapid growth, unrealistic expectations, and poor organization methods. The farmers' attempt at business cooperation, driven by their disdain for middlemen and manufacturers, also contributed to the Grange's downfall. Their efforts to eliminate middlemen and control manufacturers through the organization were unsuccessful and led to discontent among members.|"['1.

The middlemen, who acted as intermediaries between farmers and retail dealers, often took advantage of their positions to strike hard deals. The commission merchants, with their storage facilities and market knowledge, could profit from market fluctuations, leaving farmers frustrated. Efforts to regulate markets or create artificial shortages rarely worked. Farmers felt the retail dealers were unjust, especially since there was little competition in small agricultural communities. Farmers believed middlemen drained wealth from agricultural classes without contributing. The Granges tried various cooperative schemes to redirect wealth to their members but faced challenges. Cooperative stores, funded by Grange members, struggled to compete with traditional merchants. Farmers' agencies for selling produce, like creameries and elevators, had more success. State Granges sometimes appointed specific firms as agents for selling produce, saving farmers money without business risks.|"[""1.

"In 1876, the National Grange members explored coöperation in retailing goods and favored the ""Rochdale plan,"" developed by an English association, for coöperative stores. These stores were owned by various stockholders who each had an equal say in management. Goods were sold at regular prices, and profits were later divided among buyers based on their purchases. While this plan reduced fierce competition, it faced resistance from Midwestern farmers due to past coöperative failures. In other regions, like the East and South, the Rochdale plan found success. However, when the National Grange delved into manufacturing, problems arose. Attempting to control implement production, they faced challenges with large manufacturers. Despite setbacks, these ventures taught valuable lessons about business, cooperation, and the importance of mutual respect between farmers and manufacturers."|"['1.

The Grange played a crucial role in transforming the lives of farmers in the past. It not only brought about social and intellectual growth but also provided a sense of community and joy. Farm life in the past was isolated and monotonous, especially for women who were confined to the farmhouse without modern conveniences. The Grange allowed men and women to work and play together, fostering respect and enjoyment. Through its rituals and songs, the Grange instilled values of orderliness, industry, thrift, and charity. Members engaged in charitable deeds, aiding those in need across the country. Grange meetings served as platforms for public speaking and discussions on economic topics, stimulating the members' minds. The Grange also promoted reading habits among farmers, leading to intellectual growth and progress.|['1.

During the late 1800s, the Granger movement faced challenges as the Western farmers struggled with economic hardships. The farmers aimed to boost their profits by cutting transportation costs and eliminating middlemen but were unsuccessful. To address their financial woes, they sought to raise product prices and prevent debt appreciation by increasing the money supply. This desire for inflation had historical roots in American economic struggles, including during the Civil War when over $400,000,000 in greenbacks were issued, causing a decline in their value. The debate over currency inflation and bond redemption methods led to the rise of third parties advocating for greenbackism. Initially championed by labor unions in the East, greenbackism later gained traction among Western farmers as a solution to the economic downturn.|"['1.

In 1875, a conference was held by representatives from seven States to form a new political party called the Independent party. Led by James Buchanan, the party aimed to protect the rights of the masses against the influence of capital, reduce taxes, and clean up the government. The party's main concern was the money question, specifically the issue of greenbacks interconvertible with bonds. The Independent party officially organized at a convention in Cleveland in March 1875 and later held a nominating convention in Indianapolis in May 1876. Peter Cooper, a philanthropist and pioneer in iron manufacturing, was selected as the presidential candidate. Despite facing financial challenges, the Greenback movement spread through the establishment of Greenback Clubs across the country, led by figures like Marcus M. Pomeroy.|['1.

In the 1876 election, the Greenback party struggled to gain traction, only garnering about eighty thousand votes, less than one percent of the total votes. The party found some success in Pennsylvania, while the Western states like Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Iowa, and Kansas showed more support with over 6000 votes each. Despite the agrarian focus of the movement, many farmers were not fully convinced of the party's necessity. In 1876, the party's only notable achievement was influencing the election of a few Illinois Legislature members, including David Davis to the U.S. Senate. However, in 1877, amid significant unrest and discontent, the Greenback movement gained momentum as the agricultural depression worsened and railroad strikes highlighted working-class struggles. This led to a rapid growth of the Greenback party and the resurgence of labor parties incorporating Greenback demands into their platforms across various states.|"[""1.

General James B. Weaver, a prominent figure among the Greenbackers elected to Congress in 1878, hailed from Iowa. Weaver's journey to Iowa from Ohio, his birthplace, occurred when he was just ten years old. After graduating from a law school in Cincinnati in 1854, he practiced law and ran a newspaper in Bloomfield, Iowa. Weaver's career took a turn when he enlisted in the army in 1861, rising to the rank of brigadier general by the war's end. Despite his advocacy for prohibition and railroad regulation, Weaver remained loyal to the Republican party until he joined the Independent or Greenback party in Iowa. Weaver's oratory skills and dedication to advocating for farmers won him respect in Congress. In the campaign of 1880, Weaver's presidential bid under the Greenback party garnered support but ultimately fell short in the election.|"[""1. What was General James B.

"After 1880, the Greenback party quickly fell apart. It was clear that it wouldn't become a major party anytime soon. The more conservative leaders started going back to the old parties or planning to join forces with them in future elections. However, this fusion could only delay the inevitable end. The 1882 congressional election showed that the party was dying out. Out of the ten Congressmen elected in 1880, who were considered Nationals, only one got reelected in 1882, and no new names emerged. Some Congressmen classified as Democrats likely owed their election partly to the fusion between the Democratic and Greenback parties. The Greenbackers last appeared in national politics in the 1884 presidential election. General Benjamin F. Butler was nominated for President by ""The Anti-Monopoly Organization of the United States"" in Chicago, and the Greenback or National party also chose him as their candidate. General Butler's popularity and labor connections boosted his votes in some Eastern States and Michigan, but there was a significant drop in Greenback votes in the Western States. The Greenback party leaders struggled to gain widespread farmer support due to the strong allegiance to the Republican or Democratic parties. While the Greenbackers had progressive demands, their focus on inflation hindered broader support. The movement faded away, unable to address agricultural depression, similar to the Granger movement.

"In the late 1800s, American farmers faced challenges as urban wealth soared while rural areas struggled. Despite increased food production efficiency, rural wealth and population declined. Farmers noticed their children seeking city jobs due to better pay and shorter hours. Prices for farm goods plummeted, with wheat dropping to forty-nine cents a bushel in 1894. The economic downturn hit hard, with cotton prices falling to under seven cents a pound. Many farmers faced financial ruin, with some finding it cheaper to burn their crops than sell them.

During the late 19th century, farmers faced financial hardships due to low crop prices, high mortgage interest rates, and unfair taxation. In 1888, 174 bushels of wheat were enough to cover the interest on a $2000 mortgage at 8%. However, by 1894, with wheat prices dropping, it took 320 bushels to pay the same interest. Many farmers fell into debt, unable to keep up with mortgage payments, leading to foreclosures. The tax system further burdened farmers, as they were taxed disproportionately compared to wealthier individuals and corporations. The farmers' distress led to discussions on remedies in various forums, emphasizing the need for more equitable financial policies. The control of money supply by Wall Street and national banks was criticized for exacerbating the farmers' plight.|"['1.

In the late 1800s, farmers faced economic challenges, leading to the formation of alliances for mutual protection and cooperation. The injection of more money into circulation benefited debtors, including farmers, by lowering the purchasing power of money and helping them pay off debts. Despite potential drawbacks like increased prices, farmers sought unity through organizations like the Alliance to address economic, social, and political issues. The movement grew rapidly, with women admitted to membership and a focus on cooperation and business ventures. However, political dissension and challenges in cooperative efforts led to setbacks. In Texas, the Alliance expanded, emphasizing education and forming a national organization. The Alliance aimed to educate farmers in economic governance in a nonpartisan way and focused on organizing the cotton industry.|['1.

In 1880, the Farmers' Union started as a farmers' club in Lincoln Parish, Louisiana. By 1885, it became a secret society with a ritual like the Grange and a constitution from the Texas alliances. The organization quickly spread, and a state union formed. Macune, elected president, sent organizers across the South. By October 1887, delegates from nine Southern States met. Demands included tariff reduction, income tax, and education promotion. By December 1888, 10,000 alliances in 16 States had 400,000 members. In the Northwest, the National Farmers' Alliance began in Chicago with a focus on protecting farmers from class legislation and monopolies. They demanded equal taxation, income tax, and regulation of commerce. The Alliance also worked in politics, advocating for state railroad regulation and free coinage of silver. The Northwestern Alliance focused on political change through the ballot box and some business cooperation.|"[""1.

In 1889 and 1890, a significant movement emerged among farmers in the United States. The Farmers' and Laborers' Union, along with the Northwestern Alliance, met in St. Louis in December 1889. A Southern organization, renamed the National Farmers' Alliance and Industrial Union, gathered about a hundred delegates from various states. They aimed to unite but faced challenges due to differing views on merging and political involvement. The Southern Alliance wanted a complete merger with secret features, excluding black farmers from the national body. Meanwhile, the Northwestern Alliance preferred a federation where each group retained its identity. Efforts for a federation continued, but obstacles arose, including financial mismanagement and political discord. By 1890, interest shifted towards political organization, leading to the rise of Populism. Despite challenges, the movement highlighted the need for a new political party to address the agricultural class's concerns.|"[""1.

In 1886, the Knights of Labor and trades unions worked together with the Greenbackers and farmers' groups, winning elections in parts of the U.S. Labor and farmers united, led by Henry George, James Buchanan, and Alson J. Streeter, but faced challenges. Streeter ran for President in 1888, getting votes mainly from Western states. Farmers hesitated to join political actions, preferring non-political business organizations. Despite dissatisfaction, no new party was formed immediately. The St. Louis convention in 1889 highlighted demands for economic reforms, including greenbacks, free silver coinage, and government control of transportation. The sub-treasury scheme proposed by C. W. Macune aimed to help farmers by providing loans based on their crop values, increasing currency circulation and allowing farmers to hold crops for better prices. The Northwestern Alliance proposed a land loan bureau for low-interest loans on land.

The Alliance adjusted its political actions to local needs. In several Southern States like Florida, Georgia, and the Carolinas, Alliance members influenced Democratic conventions. They ensured their demands were included in the party's agenda and pushed for candidates who supported these demands. This led to the control of legislatures in five Southern States by Alliance members or supporters. Additionally, three governors, a United States Senator, and forty-four Congressmen who backed Alliance principles were elected. In the West, the Alliance formed new parties rather than taking over existing ones. While not officially a political party, the Alliance played a crucial role in organizing People's, Independent, or Industrial parties across different States. This period marked a significant political and social transformation, particularly in Kansas, where the Alliance movement gained immense momentum. Meetings, lectures, and rallies were held to spread the Alliance's message, with prominent figures like Mary Elizabeth Lease advocating for economic reforms and criticizing the influence of money in politics.|"[""1.

"In Kansas, a significant event during the campaign was the battle between Jerry Simpson and Colonel James R. Hallowell for a seat in Congress. Simpson, known as ""Sockless Jerry,"" mocked his opponent's silk stockings, giving him the nickname ""Prince Hal."" Despite attempts to ridicule Simpson, the audience favored him in debates, leading Hallowell to refuse further meetings. This resulted in Simpson's election to Congress, where he served credibly. The 1890 elections in Western States saw the rise of the Populist movement, electing Populist Congressmen and gaining legislative influence. Notable victories included the election of two United States Senators, such as Reverend James H. Kyle in South Dakota and William A.

"In July 1892, the Populist Party emerged in national politics at Omaha, where delegates from across the country gathered to nominate candidates for President and Vice-President and adopt a party platform. The platform, inspired by the Alliances' ""Demands,"" was described by critics as an impassioned critique of the era. It called for the unity of labor forces, wealth creation, and control of railroads by the people. Monetary reforms included a national currency, free coinage of silver and gold, and an increase in the circulating medium. The platform also demanded a graduated income tax, government ownership of essential services, and restrictions on alien land ownership. Despite initial enthusiasm, the nomination process for President was contentious, resulting in General James B. Weaver and General James G. Field being selected as the party's candidates. Weaver's nomination was met with skepticism by some, who doubted his ability to challenge the established political parties effectively."|"['1.

"The Populist Party, led by General Weaver, aimed to challenge the dominance of the old-line parties in the 1892 election. Weaver's party advocated for bimetallism and demanded the return of valuable lands held by corporations. They strategically aligned with weaker factions of the old parties to gain support. The Populists organized rallies across the country, featuring unique elements like singing political songs. While they found success in some western states, they faced ridicule and opposition in the South. Despite efforts to split the ""solid South"" and gain Democratic support in the North, the Populists struggled to make a significant impact in many regions.

In the 1892 election, the Populist party made a strong impact by garnering over a million votes, nearly nine percent of the total. This achievement set a record for a third party in its second year, surpassed only by the Republican party in 1856. General Weaver, a Populist leader, declared that the Republicans were declining rapidly, while the Populists were gearing up for a robust campaign to educate and organize supporters across the nation. Despite some criticism about aligning with older parties through fusion, many believed that 1892 marked a significant milestone for the Populist movement. The campaign lessons learned paved the way for a more independent stance in future elections, aiming to win over Democratic and Republican voters through ideological conversion rather than party alliances. The Populist cause focused on advocating for free silver coinage, government-issued paper money, and opposition to interest-bearing bonds controlled by private banking interests.|['1.

In 1873, the Act was debated in Congress for four sessions. Initially, there was no opposition to making gold the sole standard of value or omitting the silver dollar. However, the value of silver rapidly declined, causing a stir. Bimetallists blamed monetary changes, while gold standard supporters attributed it to increased silver production. This decline led to demands for remonetization by Western states reliant on silver mining. The Bland-Allison Act of 1878 restored the silver dollar but was unsatisfactory to free silver advocates. The silver coinage issue continued to divide political parties until 1890 when the Silver Purchase Act was passed. This act aimed to stabilize silver prices but failed, contributing to the Panic of 1893. The silver question became a national debate, impacting the economy significantly.|"['1.

"From coast to coast, the nation was inundated with contentious literature, designed to appeal to those without the time or expertise to grasp the complex economic issues at hand. W. H. Harvey's ""Coin's Financial School"" stood out as the most widely read piece, alongside numerous other pamphlets and books that reached a vast audience. The persuasive arguments presented by ""Coin,"" along with his clever responses to questions posed by prominent figures, resonated with thousands of farmers who saw their struggles reflected in the illustrations within the book. By portraying a mythical school where silver was championed over gold, ""Coin"" managed to sway many to his cause, highlighting the perceived conflict of interests between England and the United States. The Populist party's alignment with silver was both a matter of belief and strategy, as the call for cheap money had long been a central demand of the farming class.

In 1893, Kansas was at the center of national politics due to a dispute over the control of the lower house of the legislature. The Republicans had a majority, but some seats were contested for suspected fraud. The Populists could outnumber the Republicans if these seats were disqualified. The situation turned comical as both parties claimed their speakers were duly elected. They even slept in the assembly chamber, with a truce called at 2 am. The tumultuous session lasted over two weeks, with men from all over the state converging on Topeka. Eventually, the Populist house withdrew, leaving the Republicans in control. The standoff led to absurd and serious measures, with the involvement of the judiciary and militia. The struggle ended with the Republicans in the house and the Populists in the senate, prompting joint efforts for the silver cause. The elections of 1894 showed the growing unrest, with the Populist vote indicating popular dissatisfaction.|['1.

In 1895, every political move was made with an eye on the 1896 presidential election. Both major parties were influenced by the free-silver movement, but the fear of President Cleveland's veto power held back the silver advocates. The call for free silver was strong in the West, uniting silver Democrats and Populists. There was debate on how to join forces effectively. General Weaver tried to merge the American Bimetallic League and silver Democrats with the People's Party. Meanwhile, some Populist leaders resisted fusion, foreseeing the party's demise. The 1896 political events would determine Populism's path, whether it would stand alone or merge with the Democrats. At the Republican convention in 1896, the monetary issue took center stage. Marcus A. Hanna, a powerful figure, backed William McKinley for the nomination, skillfully navigating the gold standard debate. McKinley's nomination and the adoption of a gold plank in the platform solidified the party's stance.|"[""1.

The Democratic convention in Chicago three weeks later was far from straightforward. Despite some Northeastern States supporting the gold standard, the West and free silver held the upper hand. Senator John W. Daniel of Virginia, a strong silver advocate, was chosen over the nominee for temporary chairman. The second day saw territories tripling their representation, gold-supporting delegations were replaced by silver supporters, and Senator Stephen M. White of California was made permanent chairman. The platform, mainly about money, sparked heated debates. The committee on resolutions rejected monometallism, calling it a British policy that harmed industrial prosperity. A minority proposed amendments supporting a gold standard and praising Grover Cleveland. William Jennings Bryan emerged as a leader, voicing the silver cause passionately.

Bryan, a towering and imposing figure at the convention, stood out with his unconventional black suit and slightly disheveled appearance. Despite his eccentricities, Bryan's power to captivate an audience was unmatched. At the sweltering Chicago convention, he silenced a crowd of 15,000 with his impassioned defense of free silver. His skillful oratory and clever responses to opponents won him the leadership the party had been seeking. The Populist convention that followed in St. Louis faced a crucial decision. Delegates, many elderly and impoverished, debated whether to support the Democratic nominee for a chance at victory or preserve the Populist party's identity. While most were willing to cooperate with the Democrats, a strong minority, particularly from the South, resisted any form of alliance, fearing it would betray their hard-fought principles.|"['**1.

"In 1896, the fusion advocates celebrated their initial triumph with Senator Allen elected as the permanent chairman. The focus shifted to preventing Arthur Sewall from becoming the Vice-President nominee. Despite Sewall's banking and business background, the party felt he wasn't the right fit. Thomas Watson, a country editor from Georgia, was nominated instead. This decision aimed to maintain the party's identity and avoid complete surrender to the Democrats. The South's delegates opposed fusion, with many voting for S. F. Norton. The People's Party committee strategized to unite voters against McKinley, emphasizing the importance of electoral fusion. Challenges arose in the South, where Populists collaborated with both Democrats and Republicans, showcasing the complexities of political alliances.

During the 1896 election, Bryan, the Democrat-Populist candidate, traveled extensively, covering over 13,000 miles and speaking to millions of voters in 29 states. Despite opposition from influential newspapers, Bryan's tours garnered significant attention. The election ultimately became a class struggle, with the Populist committee framing it as a battle between the wealthy seeking to exploit the people and the common folk fighting for equality and their rights. In the end, McKinley won with more popular and electoral votes, except in states west of the Mississippi River where Bryan prevailed. The People's Party, which backed Bryan, suffered a decline in strength and influence after the election, with many former Populists shifting their allegiances to other parties. The People's Party's failure to secure Bryan's election and internal divisions contributed to its decline post-1896.|"[""1.

The People's Party, also known as the Populist Party, experienced a decline after the events of 1896. By 1900, internal divisions weakened the party, leading to a split in 1900 and 1904. The party's influence waned, and by 1912, it dissolved without endorsing any candidate. Former leaders like Weaver and Peffer shifted allegiances or retired from national politics. Despite the party's demise, the farmers' movement persisted. Farmers organized into groups like the Grange and other associations, focusing on social, intellectual, and business cooperation. These groups gradually ventured into politics, supporting candidates and advocating for farmers' interests. In some states, these organizations sought to influence major political parties. For instance, the Non-Partisan League in North Dakota gained control of the state government. The organized farmers regained political influence in Western states, shaping the political landscape.|"[""1.
