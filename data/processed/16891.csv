Now, after sharing stories about European cities in ""Tales about Europe,"" let's delve into the description of America. This land is filled with flourishing cities, numerous ships, fertile fields, mighty rivers, vast forests, and millions of happy inhabitants. Only 370 years ago, the existence of America was revealed, a discovery made by the brave Christopher Columbus in 1492. Columbus, a tall and commanding figure, hailed from Genoa, Italy, and was a skilled sailor. After facing treachery and rejection, he finally found support from Spain's King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella. With their backing, Columbus embarked on a historic voyage to explore the Western World, setting sail with three small vessels and a crew of 120 men."|['1.

Christopher Columbus, the famous explorer, faced challenges from his crew during his journey to discover new lands. Despite their doubts, Columbus was determined to find land. After days of anticipation, signs of land began to appear: the sea became shallower, birds circled the ships, and the air turned warmer. Finally, a distant light was spotted, signaling land ahead. As they approached, the crew and Columbus were greeted by the natives of a beautiful island, Guanahini, now known as St. Salvador. The natives, with their copper-colored skin and simple ways, welcomed the Europeans with awe and reverence.

Columbus wanted to explore more but with only the Nina left, he decided to return to Europe to avoid getting stranded without a ship. Some of his crew wanted to stay, so Columbus left forty of them on the island and built a fort for their safety. On his way back, Columbus encountered storms and the Pinta went missing.

During a stormy night, the seamen spotted land, but feared crashing into rocks. They managed to stay at sea until morning. On March 4th, they found themselves near Cintra rock at the mouth of the Tagus river in Portugal. Despite distrust, Columbus sought shelter there. The locals were relieved to see him safe after praying for his ship's safety. Columbus faced many dangers on his journey back to Europe. The Portuguese missed out on the benefits of his discoveries due to their treatment of him. Despite envy, Columbus was welcomed in Lisbon and received with honor for his extraordinary achievements. Upon his return to Spain, he was celebrated for his discoveries and greeted with joy and admiration. Columbus shared his voyage details with the people, earning respect and admiration. His family was honored, and his son was appointed a page to the heir apparent. Columbus faced adversity from jealous courtiers but overcame with his achievements.|"['1.

When Columbus arrived at the part of the island where he had built a fort and said goodbye to his friends, it was getting dark, and the land was no longer visible. He anxiously waited for the morning to come, and when the sun rose, he saw that the fort was destroyed, with broken chests and European clothing scattered around. Columbus, with some effort, managed to communicate with a few locals who revealed that after he left for Spain, the settlers mistreated the natives, leading to sickness, fights, and attacks. The Spaniards then moved to a healthier location and built a new settlement. Columbus later sailed to Jamaica and faced accusations in Spain, but his discoveries and findings of gold and pearls silenced his critics. His third voyage took him to Trinidad, where he encountered dangerous river currents and concluded he was near a vast continent.|"[""1.

Columbus, the famed explorer, encountered challenges and triumphs on his journey to the New World. Initially met with friendly natives willing to trade gold and pearls for European toys, Columbus marveled at their courage and intellect. However, upon returning to Hispaniola, he faced mutinies and rebellions among his own men. Francisco Roldan, a trusted judge, led a dangerous rebellion that threatened the colony. Despite turmoil, Columbus managed to restore order and send reports of his discoveries back to Spain. But his enemies, fueled by greed and malice, spread lies about him at court. Eventually, a royal officer, Bobadilla, arrived and unjustly imprisoned Columbus. Fortunately, a compassionate guard reassured him, offering a chance to defend his honor. Columbus set sail for Spain, determined to clear his name and continue his explorations.|"['1.

The esteemed Villejo and Andries Martin, the caravel master, wanted to remove Columbus's chains, but he refused. Columbus insisted on wearing the chains until the monarchs ordered their removal. Upon reaching Cadiz, Ferdinand and Isabella, unaware of the full extent of Bobadilla's actions, promptly ordered Columbus's release and sent funds for his journey to court. Overwhelmed by the monarchs' kindness, Columbus, who had endured much injustice, was moved to tears by Queen Isabella's compassion. Despite the setbacks, Columbus's determination remained strong. He set out on his fourth voyage with a small fleet, hoping to continue his explorations. Columbus faced challenges, including a storm, but his resilience persisted as he pursued his passion for discovery.|"['1. **Question:** Why did Columbus refuse to have his chains removed by Villejo and Andries Martin?\n- A) He wanted to keep them as a symbol of his struggles.\n- B) He was ordered to wear them by the monarchs.\n- C) He believed it was a sign of respect towards the caravel master.\n- D) He insisted on waiting for the monarchs to order their removal.\n- E) He wanted to show his determination to overcome injustice.', ""2. **Question:** What was the reaction of Ferdinand and Isabella upon learning about Bobadilla's actions towards Columbus?\n- A) They decided to punish Columbus further.\n- B) They immediately ordered Columbus's release.\n- C) They refused to send funds for Columbus's journey to court.\n- D) They insisted on keeping Columbus in chains.\n- E) They planned to send Columbus on another expedition."", '3. **Question:** How did Columbus feel when Queen Isabella showed him compassion upon his arrival in Cadiz?\n- A) Indifferent\n- B) Overwhelmed\n- C) Angry\n- D) Disappointed\n- E) Annoyed', '4. **Question:** What motivated Columbus to embark on his fourth voyage despite the challenges he had faced?\n- A) Desire for fame and fortune\n- B) Pressure from the monarchs\n- C) Fear of failure\n- D) Curiosity about new lands\n- E) Passion for discovery', '5. **Question:** How did Columbus demonstrate his resilience during his fourth voyage?\n- A) By giving up after the first challenge\n- B) By refusing to sail further\n- C) By facing a storm and continuing his journey\n- D) By returning to Spain immediately\n- E) By requesting more funds from the monarchs']"|"['** D) He insisted on waiting for the monarchs to order their removal.', ""** B) They immediately ordered Columbus's release."", '** B) Overwhelmed', '** E) Passion for discovery', '** C) By facing a storm and continuing his journey']"
The ship carrying Bobadilla, Roldan, and Columbus' enemies sank with all its crew and most of the treasure. Some ships returned to St. Domingo, and one continued to Spain with four thousand gold pieces recovered by Columbus' agent. Columbus left Hispaniola, heading west to Honduras. He met civilized locals who directed him west, where gold was abundant. Columbus aimed to find a strait to the Indian Ocean, ignoring advice to head west to Yucatan, Mexico, and New Spain. A storm hit, and a strange column approached the ship but caused no harm. Columbus, stranded, sought help from natives who provided canoes. Two companions sailed to Hispaniola for aid. Columbus wrote to Ovando, but rescue was delayed. Finally rescued, Columbus faced mistreatment by Ovando and died in Spain in 1506. Columbus' treatment of the Native Americans contrasted with the cruelty of the Spaniards who followed.|"[""1.

On September 6th, a bold explorer set out for the mountains separating him from the vast Pacific Ocean. Determined to face any challenges, he led his followers through dense forests and treacherous streams. As they ventured into the territory of fierce Indian tribes, a battle ensued. The Spaniards, armed with firearms, overcame the natives' initial attack. Despite casualties, they pressed on, looting a village for gold and jewels. Finally, atop a mountain, the explorer caught sight of the grand sea they sought. He marked the occasion by planting a cross and carving the king's name on stones. Despite his grand discovery, the explorer faced hardships on the journey back, marked by thirst, hunger, and conflicts with the indigenous people. Eventually, he returned to Darien, celebrated for his achievements, yet haunted by the cruelty and injustices of his conquests.

Descending from the Chalco mountains, the vast plain of Mexico gradually unfolded, revealing fertile fields stretching beyond sight, a lake akin to the sea, surrounded by towns and the capital city perched on an island embellished with temples and turrets. Messengers from Montezuma arrived in succession, allowing and then denying passage, torn between hope and fear. Cortez advanced cautiously towards the capital, uncertain of Montezuma's intentions. When they finally met, Montezuma arrived in grandeur, carried on a litter by his favorites under a canopy held aloft by officers. Cortez dismounted respectfully, initiating a tense encounter.

Confused between hope and fear, a dance began amidst chaos. Runners arrived, describing a colorful, bustling house. Some wanted to flee into the woods to avoid offending visitors who might harm them. A large canoe landed with a man in red and others. As the chiefs and wise men gathered in a circle, the man in red approached, met with admiration and confusion. A drink was passed around, but only one brave warrior drank it, falling unconscious. The strangers, dressed in red, distributed gifts, leading to laughter and learning.

The Bustard, a native turkey, is sometimes hunted in Bathurst. It can weigh up to eighteen pounds and differs from common turkeys with white leg flesh and dark breast meat. Once, a black man wanted to get an Opossum from a hollow tree. He cut a hole too low and had to smoke the animal out. The tree was thin, and it seemed like it would fall, but the black man climbed it fearlessly. When the Opossum appeared half-singed, he triumphantly threw it down. This scene in the forest was powerful. The island has mountains, forests, rivers, and meadows, making it valuable. Two rivers, Tamar and Derwent, cross the island. Hobart Town, the capital, sits on the Derwent. British settlements in Australia, like Sydney, Tasmania, Port Phillip, Melbourne, and Victoria, have grown rapidly. The discovery of gold caused a frenzy, with people abandoning their jobs to search for gold. Melbourne's population skyrocketed from 23,000 to 85,000 in a year due to the gold rush. An obelisk in the International Exhibition represents the gold Australia sent to the UK since 1851, totaling nearly 800 tons. The interior of Australia remains largely unexplored. An expedition led by Burke aimed to cross the continent but ended tragically with Burke and his companions starving to death.
