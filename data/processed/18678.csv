"""Excused; but don't ask such questions,"" said the engineer to Charley.

"""Why not have the second mate take one of the berths in the cabin?"" suggested the new mate. ""He's a skilled sailor, been at sea his whole life."" Captain Sullendine agreed and allowed the second mate into the cabin. He then instructed Bokes to give the crew some apple-jack for a drink. The captain was proud of treating his crew well, believing it would benefit them. Christy and Graines, though not drinkers, recognized the value of apple-jack for others. They were concerned about the crew getting drunk. Christy poured the liquor into the water, and the crew didn't mind. The new second mate joined the captain in the cabin. The officers promoted total abstinence but allowed the crew to have their grog ration. Captain Sullendine drank whiskey, which worried Graines.

The captain quickly drank from the bottle once he arrived, noticing it was nearly empty. He warned Mr. Sandman not to overindulge due to their impending important tasks. Christy, following orders, headed to the deck shrouded in dense fog. The cook, Sopsy, was also intoxicated and delivered an invitation from the captain for lunch. The mates, enjoying the ham and ship-bread, observed the captain succumb to sleep. They tried to wake him, but he struggled to appear composed. Eventually, the captain retired to his stateroom, unable to walk unaided. Graines, helping him settle, ensured his safety before joining Christy. Christy, reflecting on the situation, remarked on the captain's inebriation, grateful they avoided potential issues due to his intoxication.|"['1.

Graines and Christy discussed their plan on the deck of the vessel. Graines mentioned they could have taken control of the ship if the steamer hadn't intervened. They decided to wait for the steamer's movement. Christy checked on the crew and found Sopsy and Bokes inebriated from apple-jack. They decided to inspect the vessel. The crew was found lounging around, some asleep, others talking quietly. Christy informed them that action time was nearing. They noticed the vessel was anchored with a short hawser attached to the steamer. The fog was lifting, revealing the surroundings. Christy believed the Tallahatchie's commander would wait for better weather. The crew, experienced seamen, worked the windlass to start moving the vessel. Christy, taking charge, adjusted the cable to prevent the anchor from breaking loose. Graines was instructed to oversee the aft, while Christy ensured the captain's safety. Sopsy and Bokes were found drunk, unlikely to wake for hours.|"[""1.

Captain Sullendine was resting peacefully in his cabin, undisturbed by any noise. The interior of the cabin was basic, not meant for passengers. The door was sturdy, lacking a lock. Graines couldn't secure it with a key. To prevent the captain from leaving, Graines ingeniously used a rolling pin to secure the door handle, making it impossible to open from the inside. The lieutenant recalled Captain Rombold, a skilled and respected naval officer. Meanwhile, on deck, French locked a crew member in their bunk, ensuring they couldn't escape. As the steamer prepared to depart, Christy supervised the vessel's progress, making sure everything was in order.|"[""1.

The fog persisted for another ten to fifteen minutes. The blockader had a clear shot at the steamer and kept firing. Christy decided to take advantage of the darkness to raise the mainsail and then the foresail. French and the engineer assisted in the task. As the fog lifted, the officer on the steamer noticed the West Wind changing course. The Tallahatchie ignored the blockader to the west and continued on. The West Wind set her sails, and the officer on the steamer grew angry. The West Wind veered southeast, leaving the steamer behind. The fog cleared, revealing smaller masses floating towards Mobile Point. Christy steered while Graines organized the sails. The ship was making good progress. The Confederate steamer sped up, unconcerned with the West Wind or the blockader. Christy believed the Bellevite would soon be visible.|"[""1.

Graines abruptly left Christy's side and hurried to the cabin entrance on the ship. Christy, curious, followed him but remained at a distance. Graines peered into the darkness of the cabin where he spotted Bokes, a crew member, trying to access Captain Sullendine's whiskey stash. Graines explained to Christy that Bokes had likely escaped from confinement and was seeking a drink. Bokes, struggling with trembling hands, managed to pour himself a glass of whiskey. Graines then confronted Bokes. Christy, observing from a distance, decided to join Graines in the cabin to witness the interaction with Bokes. Bokes, in a nervous state, shared limited information about the Tallahatchie's armament. Christy, using a spyglass, identified the Bellevite and noticed its position further east than expected.

The dark smoke billowed from the ship's stack, hinting at the use of something other than coal. It seemed determined to intercept the Confederate ship, firing its heavy guns despite falling short. Graines observed the enemy's movements, noting a change in course upon spotting the Bellevite. Setting the gaff-topsails, the ship sailed better. A Confederate flag was hoisted alongside the American ensign. Confident they would catch up, Christy gave orders to intercept. The Bellevite surged ahead, aided by the chief engineer's efforts.

The ship's commander noticed that his ship was gaining on the Tallahatchie, estimating about a knot per hour, bringing the chase within four miles. The commander regretted not changing course sooner, acknowledging the gain they had made. The two ships continued on their paths, with the Bellevite gaining about a knot per hour. Smoke from the Tallahatchie signaled shots fired, with one landing ahead and another closer, though off-target. Christy was awakened as the action seemed imminent. The Tallahatchie fired again, narrowly missing the Bellevite. Christy observed the Tallahatchie's broadside position and the shot passing between the ship's masts.

The captain showed the book to Captain Breaker, who had already read it and remembered everything. The gun mentioned was weaker than the one on the Tallahatchie, but the enemy's long gun was disabled. The conversation was interrupted by the chase changing course. The Bellevite was hit by three shots, and the crew quickly plugged the holes. The Parrot gun was fired, but the enemy turned to present its broadside. The Bellevite fired back, causing damage to the enemy's mizzen mast. The crew cheered as the pilot house of the enemy was destroyed. The ship turned to deliver another broadside. Christy and the captain observed the enemy's damage through spy-glasses. The Bellevite prepared to fire its starboard guns. The shots hit near the enemy's wheel.

Christy informed Captain Breaker that the enemy ship's steering gear was disabled, making it impossible for them to maneuver. Despite being unable to bring their guns to bear, the Confederate ship showed no signs of surrender. The Bellevite's crew loaded their guns and fired at the Tallahatchie, causing damage but not enough to disable her. Captain Breaker decided to board the enemy ship, anticipating a hand-to-hand fight.

The St. Regis was closing in on the Raven, a highflyer ship trying to evade capture. Christy, the commander, was strategizing how to intercept the highflyer without causing damage. As the St. Regis gained on the Raven, the crew of the highflyer began preparing to scuttle their ship or set it on fire. Christy remained calm and ordered his crew to be ready for any situation. With the St. Regis slowing down and preparing to board the Raven, tension rose as the crew anticipated a potential confrontation.

On the St. Regis, Christy gave orders to halt and then reverse the ship as it approached the Raven. From the starboard rail, he oversaw his men boarding the other vessel. The Raven's captain, incensed, shouted about his boats being crushed. Ignoring the protests, Christy continued the maneuver, causing the destruction of the boats. The seamen climbed aboard the St. Regis to safety. The crew swiftly put out fires on the Raven, preventing further damage. Despite the Raven's captain's anger, the St. Regis successfully took control of the prize. The defeated captain's outburst prompted a drenching with a hose until he was subdued. Christy's quick thinking and the crew's efficient actions secured the victory without further incident.|"[""1.

"""Stop, Mr. Victor!"" called Christy to the mate. ""I cannot trust that man to stay on the Raven. Have him arrested and put in irons if he resists,"" he directed Mr. Baskirk. ""I don't care if he's a gentleman; he's a brute, and I'll treat him as such,"" replied Christy as his men took hold of the captain. ""Send his clothes to this ship. Have him put in the brig,"" he ordered. Commander Passford's decision was final. The unruly captain was locked up on the St. Regis. Meanwhile, a lookout spotted a distant steamer. The officers, including Christy, observed the vessel. The steamer was heading east, billowing smoke. As the sail approached, Christy refocused on the Raven. Two steamers, unable to catch the Raven, were closing in. The Raven, a blockade-runner, had tried to destroy itself but was saved. Christy, disapproving of such actions, saw them as aiding the enemy.

"Captain Passford responded, ""He has behaved more like a swine than a gentleman, but I harbor no ill-will towards him. I considered him beneath contempt. I understand his disappointment, but that doesn't excuse his brutality.""

Mr. Baskirk chimed in, ""He was fleeing two blockaders and had outsmarted them. However, his disrespect for the St. Regis was evident until we fired a shot near him. Let's release Captain Bristler from the brig to see if he can behave better.""

Captain Bristler admitted, ""I was rude due to my disappointment. I apologize and will show I can be a gentleman.""

"""The ship ahead is a large vessel, probably over a thousand tons. She's sailing fast with all her sails up,"" said the first lieutenant. ""But there are three steamers following her, though they're far behind,"" he continued.

The commander, rejoining the other officers, discussed the situation. He noted that Captain Wright of the Muskegon was in charge and directed him to take possession of the Raven as a prize. The St. Regis, being a fast ship, had to join the chase immediately.

After giving the order to Mr. Amblen, Christy bid farewell to the officers who left in their boats. He waited for the blockaders to arrive before moving the ship, ensuring the safety of the crew. Meanwhile, he sent a letter to the acting admiral informing him of his arrival and following his orders.

As the Muskegon approached the Raven, Captain Wright received the prize from Christy. There was no time for compliments as Christy was in a hurry. The crew was recalled, except for one officer to assist the Muskegon's team and provide information at the prize court in New York.

The St. Regis detached from the Raven and Christy observed the chase through his glass. Despite the efforts of the blockading fleet, many blockade-runners managed to slip through. The Confederacy deployed vessels to disrupt US commerce, with some ships preying on targets without returning to Southern ports.

The darkness enveloped the two ships, hiding the distant steamers from view. The officers strained to see the steamer ahead, which continued its course. As night fell, the midship gun fired a shot towards the target, a Confederate man-of-war or privateer. The chase vanished into the fog, but Christy, the commander, had a plan. The crew silently prepared, tying white strips of cloth on their arms. In the dense fog, Christy directed the ship towards the enemy. Grappling hooks were thrown, and the two ships collided. A fierce battle ensued, with casualties on both sides. Despite the enemy's attempt to escape, the St. Regis emerged victorious, thanks to Christy's quick thinking and strategic maneuvers.|"['1.

The captain of the St. Regis was on the deck but couldn't hear anything due to the engine noise. The enemy didn't notice the ship until it emerged from the fog. The crew of the captured ship was sent below, and the victory was complete. The commander, feeling gloomy, accepted the situation. Christy, a lieutenant-commander, was introduced. The ship was loaded with cotton for England, while the steamer was to search for vulnerable US merchant ships. The master was appointed prize-master, and Christy accompanied the captain to the cabin. The Watauga had sixty men, to be reinforced at Nassau. The St. Regis made captures without fighting and continued its mission through the summer and winter.

During the Civil War, the Bellevite ship played a crucial role in battles in the Gulf. Admiral Farragut led the fleet to Mobile Bay where the Bellevite took part in intense combat. Despite sustaining damage, the ship was quickly repaired. Following the war's end, the Bellevite and St. Regis were involved in significant missions, including the capture of Fort Fisher. Christy, the ship's commander, met the President and later married Bertha Pembroke. The Passford family, like many in the South, faced challenges post-war but eventually found prosperity. Christy purchased the St. Regis and married Bertha, while his friend Paul wed Florry. The war's end brought joy and unity to the nation, with the South rebuilding and moving towards prosperity.|"['1.
