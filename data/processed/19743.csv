In the late afternoon, the boys focused on urgent tasks instead of fixing the roof, as there was no sign of an approaching storm. Jerry shared a humorous story about procrastination. As they prepared for the night, they discussed storing their belongings and enjoyed a campfire meal. The boys reminisced about past camping experiences. They slept on blankets inside the cabin, lacking proper beds. Frank planned repairs using tools they brought. The next morning, they repaired the cabin, with Frank fixing the roof and the door while others made bunks. They found an old rowboat under a rock, and Frank decided to repair it for lake use. The boat needed caulking to prevent leaks, and Frank intended to start the repairs the next day, promising a pleasant row to Cabin Point.|['1.

"""I have an idea,"" he told Will, ""that this creek flows through the land owned by that elderly recluse, Aaron Dennison; at least that's what one person informed me. Maybe he won't be pleased when he finds out that a group of boys have settled down for a month so near his place.""

""I wish we come across the eccentric old man one of these days,"" Will said, ""and that I have my camera with me because I want to capture the image of a real hermit. I have some unusual people in my collection, but none as strange as that. I really want to photograph him.""

Upon reaching the cabin, they discovered the other pair had been very diligent in their absence. The sleeping areas were starting to look neat, and promised some level of comfort when finished.

""No way!"" exclaimed Frank when all eyes turned to him. ""Every guy will have a fair chance. Here, I'll hold four pieces of wood in my hand, each of different lengths. Each person draw, and the longest one gets first choice.""

Will ended up with the first pick and chose a lower bunk since the beds were arranged in pairs due to limited space. Frank, with the second pick, took the top bunk, and the rest then divided the remaining two among them.

""Next, we'll fix that wobbly table,"" said Frank, ""and then we need another bench because right now we have to use wooden blocks for seats. Actually, I can already see"|['1.

Old Aaron may have been a money grabber and laid the foundation for his fortune while living in the cabin. The hole under the loose plank might have been a hiding place for valuables.

The wind blew at first, and the treetop rocked, making him almost sea-sick. After an hour, the wind calmed, and an osprey with a big fish caught his attention.

Will, an experienced photographer, set up a clever trap to capture night prowlers on camera. He secured the camera and aimed it to photograph any object within a certain range when triggered. Will hoped to photograph a raccoon visiting that night. His friend Frank promised to wake him if the camera went off. Later, a sudden flash woke the boys, but it was just the camera capturing the raccoon. The boys went back to sleep, used to the sounds of animals on the cabin roof. The next day, they woke early, some swimming in the lake. Will checked the camera, and Frank prepared breakfast, joking about needing to raid a farmer's coop for food.

"Excitedly, Will exclaimed, ""Bluff and Jerry must have made it back home! They're probably out searching for us, thinking we got caught in the storm.""

"Frank observed that his companions seemed anxious about the camp and curious about how they survived the storm. They paused rowing, conversed, then turned to look in his direction. ""They should spot us easily,"" Frank chuckled, recalling a time when a bull had him treed. ""Be prepared to wave and shout when I give the signal,"" he instructed. As the boat approached Cabin Point, Bluff and Jerry disembarked, grabbed their belongings, and headed for the cabin, smelling the inviting aroma of coffee. Jerry teased Bluff about downplaying the storm's severity, mentioning how he clung to a chair during a fierce blast. Bluff admitted it was a powerful storm, recounting a near-miss with a falling tree. Will explained their absence, detailing a photography excursion that led them to shelter overnight.

Frank and Will chuckled at Jerry's reaction, knowing Bluff's tendency for exaggeration. Despite Bluff's bold claims, they all understood he often bluffed. Frank then shared a mysterious discovery at an old cabin: signs of someone's presence without anything missing. Jerry, not skilled at solving mysteries, found it perplexing. Bluff pointed out the oddity of a ham shank left untouched, unlike what a dog would do. The group bantered about the mystery, with Bluff joking about uncovering the devil next. Jerry, skeptical, likened mysteries to blindfolded games. Will excused himself to develop photographs, diving into his beloved hobby.

All the campers slept well that night. Frank woke a few times but heard no signs of animals nearby. The next day was normal, and the boys had fun exploring. Bluff had been predicting the weather, using clouds and moon phases. He suggested a plan to explore a new area, and Frank agreed. They left for the woods, with Will wanting to take pictures.

Frank quickly blocked his friends' path to prevent them from intruding further. Facing the stern owner, Mr. Dennison, Frank remained composed as the man questioned their presence near his property. Mr. Dennison accused them of trying to enter his property through a loose board, which Frank denied. Frank explained that they had ventured into the woods for photography and were caught in a storm, seeking shelter in a rocky shelf. They returned to show their friends the spot.

When they were alone, Frank shared his concerns with Will about revealing their suspicions to the others.

Aaron accused the boys of suspicious behavior near his property, including taking a picture of his house. The constable urged Aaron to explain his suspicions.

Frank found the serious situation almost laughable if it wasn't so grave. Mr. Dennison viewed taking a picture of his hidden home as a severe offense, equating it to a capital crime deserving of hanging. Will's innocent appearance entertained everyone. Curious about the commotion, Frank focused on the upset old man. He spoke calmly and respectfully, trying to ease the tension. Mr. Dennison accused them of being involved in the disappearance of a valuable gold cup. Despite their innocence, the owner of Cabin Point doubted them.

The officer didn't seem to enjoy his work much. He half-heartedly searched through the boy's belongings. As the constable and Bluff went through each item, the officer muttered an almost apologetic comment. It turned out that Mr. Jeems, the constable, had a soft spot for boys, likely due to having seven kids of his own. The search extended to every corner of the old cabin, but nothing turned up. Suddenly, Mr. Dennison had an idea. He pointed out a loose board that might hide stolen items. Underneath, they found a golden cup, beautifully decorated for golf lovers.

The situation was tense as Mr. Dennison accused Frank and his friends of stealing a golden cup that mysteriously appeared in a hidden hole. Despite their protests of innocence, Mr. Dennison was adamant about involving the constable and punishing them. Just as the tension peaked, a new character, Gilbert, entered the scene.

Frank couldn't fathom the sudden idea that Jerry could have snuck out at night, navigated the trail to the hermit's place, stolen the cup, and hidden it under the cabin floor. Frank found it impossible to believe any of his friends capable of such a deed. Jerry, offended, insisted he was innocent. Frank, trusting Jerry, recalled Jerry's desire to spy at the hermit's place.

"Jerry acknowledged, ""I understand that us hunting enthusiasts must be knowledgeable about wild game habits. The same goes for fishing black bass; if you're clueless, you won't catch a thing."" Frank added, ""I've experienced both sports, and hunting with a camera beats using a gun. You connect better with animals when you're taking pictures, not harming them. Will probably considers them friends, and they aren't afraid of him."" They refrained from bass fishing to keep it exciting. Will eagerly checked his camera trap before breakfast, thrilled to find it successful. They suspected Gilbert might join them.

Their last encounter with a storm had been so unpleasant that they hesitated to face another so soon. Bluff and Jerry were satisfied with their boat work and planned a fishing trip for the next day to a spot abundant with minnows. Suddenly, a boy named Sandy Moogs arrived in a panic, seeking help for his injured woodchopper father. The campers, led by Frank, quickly prepared to assist. Sandy guided them through the woods, showing where he stumbled. As they neared, Sandy expressed hope for his father's survival.

Your father is a strong man, Sandy, and he might know how to stop bleeding by twisting a rag around a stick on the artery. Most woodsmen do. He'll be fine, Sandy. Let's all cheer loudly to encourage him. The boys shouted bravely, but only the woodpecker and crows made noise. They reached the injured man, and Frank and Will tended to his wound. Bluff and Jerry searched for poles to make a litter. The injured man had used a tourniquet to stop the bleeding before help arrived. Frank praised his quick thinking, saving his life.

"Between you and me, I don't think Frank will take the risk. We can go as far as we can, and when it gets dark, we can stop. Around midnight, if the sky stays clear, we should see the moon, and it will provide enough light to continue. ""We'll do our best until it gets too dark to see well; then we can rest for hours.

As the group huddled together, Bluff pointed out the sky brightening in the northeast, signaling the approaching dawn. Will, intrigued by Bluff's knowledge of the moon's phases, planned to study astronomy when he returned home. Waiting for better light, they discussed the moon's importance despite some teasing. Will reminded them to appreciate the moon's help, fearing it might hide if offended. When they finally set off, the injured man endured silently, grateful for the boys' help.

In the distance, the boys spotted their cabin, its window aglow despite the shutter refusing to close. Will, worried for his mother and sister, pondered if hoboes had taken refuge in their absence. Jerry, more pragmatic, reassured Will and sought a plan of action. As they carefully laid down a stretcher, they feared the worst - a message left at home might indicate an emergency.
