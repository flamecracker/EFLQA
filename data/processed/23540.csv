"The first house belonged to General Townsend. When Mrs. Townsend appeared at the door, Milly hid behind a lilac bush. Fearless Flaxie, with her cheerful blue eyes, boldly announced, ""I'm having a six-year-old party,"" without even a greeting. Flaxie's quick words impressed Milly, despite some doubts about Mrs. Prim's gratitude. Flaxie confidently repeated the party details, impressing herself too. However, when scolded for sharing too much, Flaxie felt unjustly blamed. Upset, Flaxie decided to run off to the woods, hoping none of the party guests would come. Milly, torn between right and wrong, followed Flaxie, although she knew it was a mistake. Flaxie's plan to run away was just a ruse, as she was too excited about the party to miss it. As they walked, Flaxie teased Milly about being afraid of the rain."|[]|[]
"Flaxie and Milly wandered deeper into the woods, losing their way home. Surrounded by dense trees, they relied on the light filtering through the leaves and Flaxie's golden hair. Frustrated, Flaxie scolded Milly for hiding behind a lilac bush. Exhausted, the children fell asleep in each other's arms. Meanwhile, a group searched for them, finally finding the lost girls at five o'clock. Despite Flaxie's rough day, Mrs. Prim, a fair woman, refrained from scolding her. Flaxie's party had ended poorly, leaving her scratched and tired. Milly learned from this experience, vowing not to be ""absurd"" again. Flaxie, with her loving family and playful pets, found joy in hunting for hen's nests and spending time with her beautiful baby brother. Mrs. Prim dispelled Flaxie's belief in gold teeth, causing her to cry and feel foolish. Grandma's cat, a joyous companion, never brought mice to Mrs. Prim, leaving the reason a mystery."|"[""1.

Proudfit. I thought you'd like me to play with her, so I did."" This was news to Mrs. Prim, and grandma was clueless too. Preston mentioned the Proudfit family had just moved in.

Flaxie sat at the breakfast table the next morning, feeling a bit humble after her previous mischievous behavior. However, no one paid attention to her as they were all engrossed in discussing the cat. Kitty Gray had sneaked in through the cellar door at midnight with a plump mouse. She meowed for attention, hoping for some affection from her owner. But as Mrs. Gray remained in bed, Kitty Gray did something unexpected. When Mrs. Gray discovered the mouse on her napkin, she laughed and praised Kitty Gray. Flaxie, meanwhile, counted rosebuds on the carpet, trying to distract herself from the embarrassment of her past actions. Mrs. Gray then addressed Flaxie, expressing her disapproval of her behavior and instructing her not to play with a certain girl until she had spoken to her. Flaxie, feeling remorseful, confessed her misdeeds and expressed her efforts to be good. Despite her struggles with naughtiness, Flaxie genuinely aimed to improve her behavior. This led to a positive change in her conduct for a significant period.|"['1. What was Flaxie feeling at the breakfast table the next morning?\nA) Happy\nB) Humble\nC) Excited\nD) Angry\nE) Sad', '2.

Uncle Ben mentioned that perhaps Flaxie was gone to Troy. Mr. Allen, a forgetful man of business, had packed Flaxie's doll, Christie Gretchen, to show Cousin Milly. But when they arrived at Hilltop, Milly was gone. Flaxie, in Uncle Ben's arms, declared she didn't care about Milly being absent and excitedly showed her new doll to Aunt Charlotte. Aunt Charlotte, unsure about Flaxie's unpredictable behavior, tried to make the best of the situation. Despite missing her mother and feeling homesick, Flaxie tried to be brave.

"""Hush, Freddy,"" Flaxie's mother said as Flaxie's lips trembled. ""Let's have dinner and then I'm going to Chicopee to visit Mrs. Adams, who has goldfish, a parrot, and a canary. Flaxie can come with me if she wants."" Flaxie felt a bit better at the thought of the visit but still felt sad. On the train to Chicopee with her aunt and doll, Flaxie looked gloomy. Upon arrival, Aunt Charlotte introduced Flaxie to Mrs. Chase and her children, Hattie and Lucy. Flaxie noticed Lucy's unusual behavior but was distracted by the mittens Aunt Charlotte made for her.

Flaxie didn't share much with anyone. She thought it wasn't polite. Her aunt gifted her red worsteds, and she made mittens for a sick girl named Lucy, which made her just as happy. Flaxie then expressed a desire to stay home and care for her baby sister, Ethel Gray, until she went to heaven. Despite this, she eventually forgot her promise due to being sick that spring. Flaxie then embarked on a journey to Aunt Charlotte's with the captain. She remembered Hilltop but was unsure of its location. During the ride, the captain avoided peanut vendors, much to Flaxie's disappointment. Upon meeting Uncle Ben, Flaxie's unique appearance surprised him. She was warmly welcomed by Aunt Charlotte and her cousins, although one cousin's comment made her feel self-conscious.|"[""1.

"Johnny, along with the little girls, took on the challenge of constructing a house behind the school using heavy boards. Although the task wasn't easy, they persisted in their efforts. The girls were keen to coax Freddy, who was less willing than Johnny to participate. The boards belonged to Esquire Blake, intended for office repairs. Johnny, initially skeptical, eventually embraced the project. With the help of other boys, they built a pen and added a sloping roof. The girls were delighted and wanted a fireplace. They improvised one with loose bricks from the school's hearth. Despite the fun and excitement, the teacher was unaware of their secret building project. The children planned a ""house-warming"" with tea and biscuits, inviting Ada Blake and her dolls. The first day of housekeeping ended with a cozy baking session in their newly built house."|"['1.

"Dear Red Riding Hood,

Your grandmother is unwell and cannot have butter. Please be quiet, shut the door gently, and fetch my writing desk. I plan to write to Aunt Charlotte about your possible visit to Hilltop.

Flaxie, in her excitement, dropped everything, including the butter. Unaware of her noise, she was sent away for being too loud. She decided to write to her cousin, explaining her situation and seeking permission to visit.

Flaxie packed her belongings in a brown canvas valise, ready for her trip to Hilltop. She was prepared with her umbrella and dolls, but some items went missing as she waited.

As Flaxie left for Hilltop, her mother advised her to be well-behaved like her cousin Milly. Flaxie pondered the differences in how mothers perceive their daughters and looked forward to Aunt Charlotte's warm welcome.

At Hilltop, Flaxie found the place covered in snow, making it even more beautiful. She enjoyed spending time with her cousin Milly and appreciated the kindness of Johnny, who pulled them on his sled.

The school at Hilltop, led by Miss Pike, was delightful despite some teasing from classmates. Flaxie and Milly admired Miss Pike for her bravery in saving the school from a fire.

Overall, Flaxie's visit to Hilltop was filled with fun and learning, and she cherished the time spent with her family and friends.

Warm regards,
Flaxie"|"['1. What did Flaxie drop in her excitement?\nA) Butter\nB) Writing desk\nC) Canvas valise\nD) Umbrella\nE) Dolls', ""2.

Flaxie was a quick learner, but she didn't study diligently. When struggling with spelling, she blamed the unfamiliar books. Noisy at Laurel Grove, she was worse at Hilltop. Despite Aunt Charlotte's fears of disturbing neighbors, music and playtime continued until Christmas preparations began. Flaxie planned a silk bedquilt but settled for needles due to time constraints. Aunt Charlotte's worsted project kept them busy, creating items like worsted balls and court-plaster cases. Flaxie's sore throat dashed her plans to see the church trimming. Disappointed, she watched from the window, feeling the house's lack of steam heat made her prone to freezing. Despite being advised to rest, Flaxie felt unfairly treated and found solace in self-pity.|"[""1.

"When Flaxie finally arrived, her face was a peculiar sight with purple, spotted, and striped marks from crying. She sat at the table but hardly ate, remained silent, and sadly stared at her plate. ""Dr. Papa has ticklish powders in blue and white papers, and one of them buzzes. I think he might give me that, but I'm not sure,"" Flaxie said through tears, her cheeks sore from crying. Aunt Charlotte comforted her, realizing Flaxie had been feeling homesick all afternoon. The house was in turmoil, with Flaxie missing, leading to a frantic search. Mrs. Hunter, awakened by the doorbell, found Flaxie outside wearing a nightie with foot poultices. Meanwhile, the Allen family searched for Flaxie, who had fled in fear upon Uncle Ben's return.
