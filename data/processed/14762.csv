"Here is a refined version of the passage using the provided vocabulary for middle school students:

""You are mistaken. Those who know your story would rather celebrate you publicly than harm your feelings. Those who have been treated unfairly are always admired.""

""I disagree. We published articles in all the main newspapers, sharing the facts and proving your innocence without a doubt. If you go to Augusta now, Bobby, you will be a star.""

""I'm not sure. We just got back from Maine yesterday; but Squire Lee will reassure her. Her only concern, like mine, will be her worries for your safety when she hears about your escape.""

""I believe you will do better in the end by staying put. I talked to Ellen about it, and she agrees. Timmins earned five hundred dollars a year, and you will too.""

Mr. Bayard's thankfulness likely influenced this generous offer; however, he knew our hero had skills and determination beyond his age. He also told Bobby he would have a room at his place, and Ellen was excited about the plan he suggested.

The dark clouds of doubt vanished, and rays of sunlight poured into the soul of the young merchant. Amid his happiness, he remembered that his honesty had guided him through tough times. He had stayed true to himself, and now, in his moment of triumph, he understood that if he had betrayed his principles, his success would have been meaningless.
