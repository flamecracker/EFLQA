The Battle of Hastings had a profound impact on the destiny of mankind. Before the arrival of the Normans, England was divided and lacked progress. The Normans, with their close ties to the Continent, revitalized the English people, leading to advancements in intellect and civilization. This conquest, though initially seen as a curse, eventually benefited England greatly. The completion of the Abbey of Westminster marked a significant time in history, with King Edward closely observing its construction. The town around the abbey and palace bustled with activity, housing workers and craftsmen. A young Saxon page, in the service of Earl Harold, hurried down the palace steps, clad in a mix of English and Norman attire. A chance encounter with a haughty Norman page highlighted the cultural differences of the time.|['1. What impact did the Battle of Hastings have on England?\nA.

The smile vanished from the Saxon's face as he faced Walter Fitz-Urse's challenge. The Norman Bishop of London, William, intervened, demanding an explanation. Wulf, the Saxon page, defended himself against Fitz-Urse's accusations, stating he hoped all Normans would return across the Channel. The crowd murmured angrily as they departed. Wulf left to deliver a message. A smith in the crowd criticized the king's favoritism towards Normans, expressing a preference for Earl Harold's rule.

In the past, England faced challenges similar to Alfred's battles against the Danes if Harold had not succeeded. London and Wessex, under the Earl, wanted a ruler of their lineage. The Danish kings had shown that being governed by Northmen was undesirable. The church saw a decline in English leadership since Lyfing's time. Edward favored Norman priests for bishoprics, leading to tensions. Harold, a wise and brave leader, was favored by Englishmen but faced opposition from Normans eyeing control. William, the Norman duke, harbored ambitions for England. However, as long as Harold led, English resistance endured. Wulf, Harold's ward, and Osgod, a skilled boy, forged an unlikely friendship despite tensions between Normans and English. Harold's rise to power promised hope for English autonomy against Norman influence.|"[""1.

Harold, the powerful ruler of England, was not of royal blood, but his leadership was respected. He defended England against foreign threats and was seen as the nation's future king. With no direct heir to the throne, the people believed Harold, from the influential Godwin family, was the rightful choice. In England, kings were chosen by the people through representatives rather than solely by bloodline. Wulf, a page of Harold, faced accusations of disrespect towards Bishop Walter Fitz-Urse. Harold reminded Wulf of the importance of his role in maintaining peace and diplomacy at court. Despite his fiery nature, Wulf learned the significance of his words and actions in the royal court.|"[""1.

The lord was not willing to listen to Wulf's side of the story. Wulf felt unfairly treated as the bishop only heard his page's version of the events. Despite explaining that his words about the Normans were merely a boy's quarrel, the bishop threatened to slit his ears. Wulf stood his ground, asserting that a free-born thane should not be treated like a Norman serf. Harold acknowledged that the bishop's actions were unjust and promised to deal with the matter seriously. As a result, Wulf was to be sent away from court to avoid further conflict with young Fitz-Urse. Harold assured Wulf that his exile would not be permanent and advised him to be cautious with his words and actions. Wulf accepted the decision and prepared to leave for his estate at Steyning, where he looked forward to a break from court life.|"[""1.

The Earl responded, ""I will ensure Osgod receives training at Steyning. He set out this morning, prepared to return if you declined his service. We shall catch up with him on the road.""

Despite being banished from court, Wulf felt optimistic. He saw this as a chance to learn his duties as his father's successor.

The man delivering Harold's orders to the steward wore civilian clothes, similar to Wulf's. He was Harold's confidential scribe. The other person was dressed as a soldier in a tight leather suit with iron rings sewn onto it, resembling chain armor. The soldier expressed his dislike for the Normans at court and London, preferring life among country folk or following the earl in battle. The scribe, on the other hand, enjoyed London's intellectual atmosphere and news from abroad. They traveled together, with the soldier preferring riding and the scribe finding it uncomfortable. They met Osgod on the road and arrived in Guildford at sunset, where they were led to a special area in the inn for distinguished guests. Leof spoke on their behalf.|"[""1.

Earl Harold's name secured special treatment from their host, and within twenty minutes, a supper of broiled trout, pork, and a stew of fowls and smoked bacon seasoned with herbs was served. Wulf sat at the head of the table, with the others seated below. Each used a dagger to cut their portion and ate off wooden platters, as forks were unheard of then. After the meal, the host provided water for hand-washing, a necessity even for the most refined diners. Later, a minstrel entertained them with patriotic songs. Wulf was shown to a straw-stuffed bed while his companions rested on benches. Upon arriving at Steyning, Wulf was warmly welcomed by Cedric, the steward, who expressed joy at his return and readiness to serve under him. The house, though not a fortress, was solidly built with barred windows and a strong door. The steward greeted Wulf and his companions, acknowledging Wulf's new role as lord of Steyning.|"['1.

Wulf's estate extended to the sea, stretching eight miles wide and twelve miles back from Steyning. In times of conflict, he could raise over three hundred men. Neighboring thanes visited upon Wulf's return to Steyning, but he found their rough ways and revelry unappealing. The prior of Bramber Monastery, a friend of Wulf's family, visited often. The prior, at Earl Harold's request, aimed to guide Wulf in his studies and prevent him from adopting the Saxon drinking habits. The prior, well-educated and cultured, shared tales of history and art with Wulf. Wulf, in turn, often visited the monastery, where he explored rare manuscripts and observed the monks' illuminating work.

""I forgot to instruct you or mention bringing a pack-horse, but I'm glad you thought of it. Our horses would have been overloaded with all that baggage."" Osgod replied, ""We return more laden than we left. My belongings were scarce before, and your gear has increased since our arrival."" Wulf reflected, ""There has been a change indeed, in both of us.

At the Grey Friars monastery, where we stayed on our journey from London, we faced a late start. Tomorrow, we plan to travel to Guildford for a long day. Osgod mentioned that without priories, travelers might have to sleep in the woods. He preferred the outdoors to a monk's kitchen, especially on fasting days. Osgod doubted Norman priors' strict ways, preferring Saxon houses for their lighter atmosphere. As we rode towards the priory, Osgod complained about the hard monk's bed. Wulf teased Osgod about being spoiled by a year of soft sleeping. When Wulf met Harold, he learned he would become a Thane of Steyning, no longer a page. Harold praised Wulf's growth and prepared him to meet the king as a gentleman that evening.|"[""1.

Wulf, now residing at Westminster, dispatched a messenger to Egbert for the rest of his belongings. That evening, Earl Harold introduced Wulf to the king, who acknowledged Wulf's return and progress. The king admitted he had been hasty in his judgment but was pleased with Wulf's development. Later, at the armorer's, Osgod, Wulf's companion, surprised his father with his growth and deep voice. The armorer praised Osgod's improvement in arms training but noted his talkative nature. Earl Harold mentioned that Osgod was becoming a skilled soldier. The smith suggested that Osgod should accompany Wulf on his upcoming adventures. Wulf expressed his eagerness to leave for Hereford, where the king planned to hunt, and anticipated a break from state affairs before potential Welsh conflicts arose.|"['1.

Harold embarked on a journey with a group of close companions, including his brother Wulfnoth and nephew Hakon. Beorn, a young thane under Harold's care, joined the party. Despite being older than Wulf, Beorn lacked the same physical strength and education due to a weak start in life. However, his time in the countryside had improved his health and skills. Beorn admired Wulf's abilities in combat and reading, even though he felt inferior. Wulf encouraged Beorn, assuring him that age was not a barrier and that he had his own strengths. They hoped to remain friends and support each other in the future, sharing hunts and feasts. Wulf expressed a desire to learn to read, inspired by Harold's emphasis on education, but believed that Saxon traditions could be improved by adopting some foreign customs.|"['1.

"Beorn chuckled, ""Don't worry, Wulf. When you visit me, we'll have storytellers singing our ancestors' tales. And when I'm at your place, I'll quietly listen while you read from a monk's book.

As Wulf and Beorn continued their journey, they encountered towering cliffs that amazed them. These cliffs were unlike anything they had seen before, rising steeply from the water's edge. Beorn pointed out a bay ahead where they would anchor their vessels. Despite the calm weather, the cliffs provided protection from the wind. As they sailed closer, Wulf marveled at how the cliffs seemed to have been shaped by the sea over many years, with caves and newly formed rock mounds at their base. Suddenly, a strong gust of wind hit their vessel, causing chaos and leading to a mast breaking. Despite the damage and casualties, the crew worked together to secure the sail and bail out water from the vessel.|"['1.

The storm intensified as the boat drifted two miles from the shore. Several oars were lost in the chaos, leaving the crew struggling against the wind. Despite their efforts, they only moved farther from safety. Edred advised Harold to set a sail and let the wind guide them, hoping for a change in the weather. The crew worked together to attach a makeshift sail to the boat, allowing them to move more smoothly. The wind grew stronger, making rowing impossible. Many on board felt seasick and sought refuge under the shelter of the sail. Harold and his men remained vigilant, adapting to the challenging conditions as the storm raged on.|"[""1.

Wulf, a brave sailor, was confident in the boat's ability to weather the storm. Despite the rough seas, he trusted the boat's sturdiness and the clever idea to stretch canvas across the bow to keep the water out. However, the fear of being shipwrecked on the Normandy coast haunted him. The crew worked tirelessly to bail out water as the waves grew larger and more violent. Wulf and Osgod discussed the dangers of being cast upon a rocky coast and the slim chances of survival in such treacherous waters. Wulf knew that swimming in those waves would be futile. The only hope was to find a flat shore where they could safely reach land beyond the reach of the raging sea.|"[""1.

She was almost at the shore when a loud crash startled her, followed by a massive wave that lifted the ship. Wulf saw a black rock wall rushing past, almost touching the ship. The vessel struck again, causing chaos on deck. The mast fell, and another powerful hit left the ship stuck. Waves carried everyone overboard, some managing to reach the sandy shore while others were pulled back by the receding water. In the chaos, Wulf found himself in the water, but Osgod kept him afloat. Earl Harold, standing in the water, rescued them both, urging them to stay still and helping them to safety. After the waves settled, Harold organized the survivors to form lines and rescue others from the surf. Despite injuries, they managed to save many. Harold then prepared litters for the wounded, and the group set off. Harold, anticipating trouble, instructed his companions to hide their valuables to avoid attracting unwanted attention. Wulf noticed a fisherman recognizing Harold, raising concerns about their safety. Harold acknowledged the risk but remained determined to protect his men.|"['1.

Wulf and Beorn arrived at St. Valery after surviving a shipwreck. The townspeople gathered around them upon learning they were shipwrecked Saxons. They were taken to the officer in charge, who explained that they were now considered prisoners and would await the count's decision. While they were provided with food, they were placed under guard in a granary. Despite their situation, Wulf felt grateful for surviving the waves. Beorn expressed his discontent at being treated as prisoners, but Wulf explained that being in the hands of a noble might lead to a quicker resolution due to Harold's importance. They discussed the differences in treatment of castaways in different regions. Harold and his companions worried about the potential demands for ransom or concessions from the Duke of Normandy.

Harold, Earl of Wessex, identified himself and his companions as shipwreck survivors seeking honorable treatment. However, the count demanded their valuables as they were on his land. Reluctantly, Harold surrendered his ornaments. Despite protesting the robbery, they were taken to the castle at Beaurain. The count ordered the others to work on fortifications or be killed. Harold, remaining hopeful, advised against resistance. They were escorted to the fortress where Harold and the thanes were thrown into dungeons, while the lads were to serve the count or face dire consequences.

"Beorn winced, ""I think I've sliced my fingers to the bone,"" he groaned. ""It feels like I'm gripping a searing iron. Just as you started, I heard voices. They must be guards on patrol. I grabbed the rope and swung down, but I began slipping before I could secure my footing. I clung on tight, but I plummeted like lightning.""

They waited, then scrambled up the opposite side of the muddy fosse. They crossed the country south until reaching the Authie river after three hours.

""That's a start,"" Beorn said. ""Now, which way? Let's follow this road south. The stars offer enough light. We'll reach Noyelle, then veer left towards Abbeville.""

Wulf and Beorn were on a journey towards Rouen. They had lost their way and were in need of food. After walking through the night, they found themselves in a herdsman's cottage where they were kindly offered bread and cheese. The woman informed them that they were now far beyond the territory of the vile count. She directed them towards the road from Amiens, which was about fifty miles from Rouen.

The English laughed at the promise made by Edward, the King of England, to bequeath the throne to a foreign prince, Duke William of Normandy. Although the promise held no legal value in English law due to Edward's lack of right to pass the throne, it was a powerful claim in Norman law. Wulf learned about this from the prior of Bramber, who warned that trouble could arise in England upon Edward's death. Despite the promise, William had been loyal to the duke and helped destroy castles in Normandy to prevent civil strife. Wulf and Beorn were impressed by the horses provided for their ride to De Burg's castle, where they found few remaining castles due to the duke's policy.

Harold, keenly observing the boy, explained his predicament. Despite being treated as a guest, he was essentially a prisoner. Norman soldiers guarded the gate, and a sentry stood at his door. Harold knew he had to comply with William's demands, even if it meant promising more than he intended. Wulf, a courageous Thane of Steyning, was praised for his valor in battle against the Bretons. William promised Wulf his estates and more, should he ever need to seek refuge in Normandy. The Normans admired Wulf's bravery, and the duke's council encouraged him to build on his early success.

Four days later, a grand event was announced, and many barons and knights were invited to attend. A ceremony took place in the palace courtyard, where a table covered with a cloth was placed on a dais. Wulf expressed his unease to Beorn, suspecting William's intentions. A religious ceremony was followed by William revealing that Harold, Earl of Wessex, was betrothed to his daughter and would become a Norman baron. Harold, surprised by the public oath demanded, felt trapped but understood the consequences of refusal. Despite the Norman knights' intimidating presence, Harold reluctantly swore the oath. Beneath the tablecloth lay bones and relics, unsettling Harold momentarily. Aware of William's deceit, Harold concealed his dismay, planning to sail to England the next night.

No event marked the journey. The Saxons cheered at the sight of the Isle of Wight's hills after twelve hours at sea. It took another eight hours to reach Bosham's harbor. Boats approached the Norman vessels to learn their purpose and news of Harold. Once Harold was spotted on deck, a boat rushed to share the news, and the townsfolk gathered on the shore with joy. After landing, Harold and his companions went to the church for a thanksgiving service. Harold sent riders to inform the king of his return and planned to ride to London the next day. He generously rewarded the ship crews and prepared gifts for the Duke of Normandy and his court. Harold held a court, received fealty oaths, and granted land to his loyal followers.

Early in the morning, Wulf left the palace on horseback with Osgod following close behind. Wulf wore a unique suit of armor made of lighter material than usual. The armor was thin and soft, with rings that were not as thick as usual, making it lighter but just as protective. Osgod's armor was heavier, similar to that of the forty men Harold had trained. They rode to Fareham, where Beorn welcomed them warmly. The next day, they set off for Salisbury with thirty men. Upon arrival, they were greeted by one of Harold's officers and provided with a barn to sleep in. They found many thanes already there, with pies, meat, wine, and ale waiting for them.

As you travel along a hill, rocks may tumble down, echoing through the woods and swamps. At night, as you rest, wild yells pierce the air, and suddenly attackers swarm in, slashing and causing chaos. They disappear before you can react, leaving a surreal silence. The assaults repeat until you must stay armed. Harold's decision not to engage in a winter campaign is wise.

Two of the irregulars, who spoke a bit of Welsh, went along with the young thanes to ask the guide questions if needed. The journey was tough. They passed through dense forests in the valleys and on the lower hills, and also crossed bare hills with boggy summits, making their march cautious. The guide, a sullen lad in a sheep-skin, assured them he knew the way despite being questioned sharply. Suddenly, the boy tricked Osgod, causing him to fall into a morass. The boy then fled, leading some men into the treacherous bog. After failed attempts to catch him, they decided to retrace their steps to the valley, cook food, and march away. The night was dark, and Osgod's shout yielded no response.|"['1. What language did the irregulars speak a bit of?\nA) English\nB) Welsh\nC) French\nD) Latin\nE) German', '2.

Wulf and Beorn found themselves lost in the hills, trying to figure out the best course of action. Beorn suggested that retracing their steps might not be the best idea as the two thanes might have gone in a different direction. Wulf, however, believed that continuing forward was the wiser choice, especially since visibility was poor. They decided to push on until they reached higher ground to get a better view of the area. With only seventy men left, they were outnumbered, but Wulf remained optimistic that they could evade the Welsh forces searching for them. As they reached the edge of the forest, they decided to rest until dawn before making their next move. Wulf contemplated splitting the group, but ultimately decided to stick together for safety. The group then started up the hillside, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.|['1.

"""We need to move quickly and quietly,"" Wulf instructed the men as they descended the hill, the rising sun casting light over the bare, brown hills around them. The group reached a wooded valley and paused to drink from a rivulet before continuing. As they approached a hut in a clearing, Wulf decided that only a few should enter to avoid detection. The men surrounded the area, ready to capture any potential threats. Inside the hut, they found only an elderly woman, who seemed terrified by their presence. Wulf suspected that the boy who led them there might have betrayed them to the Welsh forces. The men secured the woman, gathered goats for food, and decided to skirt the valley to avoid encountering more settlements, aiming to gain a strategic view of the fortalice ahead."""|"['1.

In a single line, they walked through the trees, and after an hour, the valley opened up before them, revealing a large village below. Moving a quarter of a mile further, they reached the edge of a broad valley with flocks and villages scattered across it. However, their focus remained on their destination. A rock jutted out from the hillside, with a wall running across it and two towers at the corners. The castle, a sturdy structure, stood at the end of the rock. Wulf, Beorn, and Osgod cautiously approached the spot, hidden by the foliage, to get a clear view of the castle. Beorn remarked on the castle's formidable appearance and speculated about its construction. They decided to climb the hill behind them for a better vantage point. Leaving their weapons behind, they planned to reconnoiter the area and return to their men.|['1.

Wulf excitedly pointed out the road leading up the slope to the rock's base, zigzagging to a point with a bridge to a turret. He speculated on a hidden tunnel into the castle. Wulf noted a village below. Concerned about a pursuing force, he planned an attack from a specific side. Upon inspection, he found a cut across the rock by the wall and returned to Beorn. Wulf strategized about the castle's defense and the absence of many guards. He contemplated seizing the castle swiftly. Worried about the return of Llewellyn's garrison, he emphasized the need for immediate action. The urgency was clear as time was of the essence to capitalize on the opportunity presented.|"['1.

Wulf and his men devised a plan to conquer the castle quickly. They needed a ladder to scale the walls. Without axes, they decided to fell some pine trees, but burning them was risky. Instead, they used the thin trees to craft ladders. Working swiftly, they cut and lashed the poles together, creating three ladders in total. Wulf instructed his men on the strategy: use short ladders to cross a deep cut and then place the long ladder against the wall. Once atop the wall, they must crawl quietly to avoid detection. If spotted, they would rush to the gates and defend themselves until all were gathered. Wulf emphasized the importance of surprise and speed, urging his men to act swiftly and spare non-combatants. With the plan in place, they were ready to storm the castle.|['1.

They descended through the trees and set up ladders against the castle wall. Beorn and Wulf climbed up cautiously, with instructions to keep distance on the ladder. As they reached the top, a commotion below alerted them. Wulf urged his companions to follow, and they swiftly made their way through the gate to the next wall. Startled residents raised alarm, but Wulf and his team pressed on. They defended the gate against approaching Welshmen, using shields and swords. Osgod reported success in the courtyard, ensuring their rear was secure. With reinforcements arriving, Wulf strategized to overpower the Welsh and seize the castle.

The Saxons charged through the gate, overpowering the Welsh defenders. The Welsh fled, some seeking refuge on the walls. The Saxons, led by Wulf, pursued them. A struggle erupted among the Welsh within the castle, with women wailing in terror. Wulf and his men managed to enter the castle, offering the Welsh a chance to surrender, but they continued to fight fiercely. Wulf ordered his men to guard the tunnel entrance and then devised a plan to attack the Welsh on the walls. Despite attempts at negotiation, the Welsh remained defiant. Wulf assured the Welsh mistress and children of Prince Llewellyn ap Rhys that they would be treated honorably. The Saxons then regrouped at the top of the castle, preparing to confront the remaining Welsh defenders.|"['1.

"A moment later, the Welsh charged down, each set on defeating at least one enemy before meeting their end. The Saxons' weapons and organization proved too strong, yet the Welsh fought valiantly until the end, none dropping their arms or seeking mercy. ""They are courageous men. It is their choice to confront us,"" said Beorn. ""Let us move the women and children out of the castle, save for the old lady's aides. We must secure provisions, post guards, and destroy the bridge.

Four guards were stationed on the wall where they had climbed. They believed it was the only vulnerable spot unless there was a hidden passage.

At ten o'clock, all lights were turned off except for a torch in each room on the ground floor. The walls and floors were carefully checked, but nothing suspicious was found. Four men were assigned to each room, except the great hall where twenty were stationed. Half were to stay awake, while all were to lie down. They were instructed to remain silent if they heard a noise or saw movement until a few men stepped out, then raise the alarm. Beorn and Wulf inspected the rooms to ensure vigilance. Wulf, expecting trouble after midnight, remained alert, watching and listening intently. Around one o'clock, a faint noise was heard from an adjoining room.

Wulf and Beorn discussed the situation at Porthwyn. Wulf ordered the bodies of the fallen Welshmen to be examined and cared for, especially the Welsh prince, Llewellyn ap Rhys, who was found alive. Precautions were taken to secure the fortress, with guards posted and the secret passage blocked. The Welsh outside seemed unsure of their next move, torn between revenge and the difficulty of capturing the impregnable fortress. Wulf devised a plan to shield his men from enemy fire using hides and ladders on the wall. Despite the Welsh's attempts to besiege them, Wulf and Beorn debated whether to send messengers to Gurth or wait for news of their situation to reach him. They decided that it might be best to wait, as news of their success could deter Gurth from attacking.|"['1.

Beorn and Wulf were alerted to a sudden attack by the Welsh on their castle walls. The Welsh, with their ladders, were fiercely trying to breach the defenses. Wulf, along with his men, swiftly defended their stronghold. The Welsh attackers fought bravely, climbing the ladders despite the risks. The battle was intense, with casualties on both sides. The Saxons, using the protection of hides, repelled the assault, causing the Welsh to eventually retreat. The attackers blew horns to signal the end of the attack, but some continued to fight. The defenders, victorious, pushed back the ladders and celebrated their successful defense. The Welsh, though defeated, responded with defiant cries.|['1.

The recent attack on the castle was well-planned and almost successful due to the lack of a strong guard during daylight. The defenders narrowly prevented the assailants from breaching the wall and courtyard. Despite losses of five men and severe injuries to others, the leather armor saved many lives. Osgod vividly described the intense combat, likening the enemy to wildcats. Beorn acknowledged the attackers' ferocity and the equal lack of discipline on both sides. After a brief truce, negotiations were initiated with the Welsh, warning of dire consequences if further attacks occurred. Ultimately, the Welsh ceased hostilities, realizing the futility of their efforts. The Saxon leaders, Beorn and Wulf, visited the wounded Welsh prince, conveying a message of surrender to avoid further bloodshed and destruction in their lands.|['1.

Llewellyn, a prisoner, yielded to Beorn and Wulf's forces. He sent his harper and doctor to summon four chiefs under safe conduct. After a private meeting, the chiefs agreed to submit. They beseeched Beorn and Wulf to seek forgiveness from Earl Gurth. Two days later, Gurth arrived with his troops, praising the capture of the fortress. Beorn credited Wulf for the successful attack. Gurth commended Beorn for acknowledging Wulf's leadership. The garrison had secured the stronghold by capturing the rear walls swiftly.

Gurth paused on the wall above the secret passage exit, impressed by Wulf's strategic preparation. The Saxons, known for their battlefield prowess, agreed with Gurth that the Danish influence in their bloodline had sharpened their intellect. After inspecting the castle walls, Gurth dined with the thanes. He later visited Llewellyn, assuring him that his fate rested with Harold. Gurth's forces arrived, prompting Llewellyn's chiefs to submit, while the people sought refuge in the hills. News of Harold's retaliation forced many to surrender. Llewellyn was pardoned, but the fortress walls facing the hill remained breached. Harold praised Wulf for his tactical success and encouraged him to study Roman war strategies and travel to European courts for further learning. Harold advised Wulf to rule wisely at his estate, with the prior of Bramber as a guide.|"[""1.

In about five years, Wulf was advised to consider traveling abroad, though it was suggested he visit the court two or three times a year to stay connected. The advice included maintaining a force of housecarls due to potential dangers from Normandy. Wulf's time at Steyning was productive, with studies, managing tenants, hunting, and increasing his housecarls' numbers. He followed Harold's counsel not to fortify Steyning like Norman castles, emphasizing the futility of such defenses in the face of defeat. Wulf's routine at Steyning earned him respect among local thanes. He visited court as advised, enjoying the festivities and meeting Beorn. Beorn preferred the court's entertainment over academic pursuits, contrasting his contentment as a thane with Wulf's ambition for greater achievements. The narrative also recounted a quarrel with Fitz-Urse, a Norman adversary, resulting in injuries to both parties. Later, Wulf was summoned to London by Harold due to the rebellion in Northumbria against Earl Tostig.|"[""1.

The land north of the Humber had long been free, with its own rulers, not loyal to the kings of the West Saxons. Even though now part of England, the Northumbrians missed their independence, especially as most were Danish and resented the West Saxons' power. Tostig was hunting with the king when the rebellion began, and Wulf, a messenger, met with Harold, who was troubled by the news. Harold believed Edwin of Mercia was behind the revolt, seeking to divide England. Harold feared the Northumbrians were too committed to turn back. The nobles had called a meeting, possibly leading to armed conflict. Harold planned to go to Hampton and invited Wulf. Harold's relationship with Edith of the Swan-neck was known, but Harold might need to marry for political reasons in the future.|"[""1.

As they rode to Hampton, the earl explained to Wulf his reason for leaving the court during a crisis. He expressed concerns about his brother Tostig's behavior as an absent earl, acknowledging the Northumbrians' grievances. The earl wanted to avoid confrontation until the matter was discussed in council. Upon arriving at Edith's grand house, Harold and Wulf were greeted warmly. Edith, recognizing Wulf after four years, reminisced about his past adventures. Harold shared his worries about Tostig's absence and the troubles in the north.

"For a week, Harold stayed at Hampton with a troubled mind. Wulf noticed his distress and suspected the messengers brought bad news. Edith, always cheerful with Harold, appeared sad when alone. ""We must ride to London, Wulf,"" Harold declared one morning, sharing dire news from a royal message. The Gemot had deposed Tostig, making him an outlaw and electing Morcar in his place. The situation worsened as violence erupted, and Morcar marched south with Northumbrian and Mercian forces. Harold, urging peace, rallied support in Wessex. Despite King Edward's indifference, Harold sought to negotiate with the rebels at Northampton. However, the rebels, under Edwin and Morcar's influence, refused to back down.

The dispute between Tostig and Harold had erupted, causing tension. Harold, valuing peace, preferred to avoid war, even if it meant losing Northumbria to a Mercian earl. Tostig accused Harold of instigating the Northumbrian revolt, which was baseless. Despite Tostig's anger, Harold denied the accusation. The king, favoring Tostig, wanted to crush the rebellion. However, Harold and wise advisors opposed this violent approach, fearing disastrous consequences. The king's illness shifted control to Harold, who aimed to resolve the conflict peacefully. Harold confirmed Morcar as Earl of Northumbria, reconciling Northern and Southern England.

Wulf was tasked with delivering a message from Lady Edith to Harold. She expressed her deep gratitude and admiration for his sacrifice for England. Wulf found Lady Edith calm and confident, eagerly awaiting Harold's letter. Overwhelmed with emotion, Wulf rushed back to Harold, who retreated to his private chamber after hearing the message. The next day, the Witenagemot convened and decided to reconcile Northern and Southern England, renewing Canute's laws. Tostig, feeling betrayed by Harold, left for exile in Flanders. Upon Harold's return to London, he discovered that Edith had left for Hampton. Despite offering her his home, she declined, choosing seclusion. In her letter to Harold, Edith expressed her love and respect, asking for no inquiries about her whereabouts. Harold, troubled by the king's failing health, faced mounting challenges as Edward's illness spread fear across the kingdom.|"['1.

Edward, the king, was known more for his dedication to building an abbey than for his skills as a ruler. He entrusted the governance to Harold while focusing on the abbey's magnificence. Despite his lack of greatness as a king, his subjects appreciated his just rule free from oppression. Edward, though initially Norman, leaned towards English ways later in life. With his impending death, the people worried about the trouble it might bring, as the line of Oethelings would end. The Witan, responsible for choosing the next king, hesitated at the thought of selecting someone outside the royal family. As Edward's health deteriorated, he shared a vision of impending doom for England, leading to uncertainty about the kingdom's future. Ultimately, he entrusted the kingdom to Harold before peacefully passing away.|"['1.

Quickly the word spread in London that the king had passed away. The Witan members remained assembled, anticipating the king's demise. The earls and thanes from various regions had gathered, including those from Mercia. Without delay, they convened in the afternoon. It was clear to all that Harold was to be the new king, as he had long been seen as the rightful successor. Harold's loyalty to the king played a significant role in the decision. The Witan unanimously selected Harold as the new king, presenting him with the crown and axe as symbols of his new role. Harold accepted the responsibility without hesitation, understanding the importance of his decision. The news of his selection was met with approval across the country. The coronation took place swiftly, with Eldred conducting the consecration ceremony. Harold swore to uphold peace, justice, and mercy in his reign.

Wulf had been present at two significant events recently, the abbey gathering and the banquet. He noticed the seriousness on Harold's face, realizing it was not just about the responsibility he had taken on but also the sadness in his heart. Before the banquet, Wulf had discreetly passed Harold a small parchment with a message from Edith. Harold, moved by the message, expressed his true feelings to Wulf. Despite becoming king, Harold's thoughts were with Edith, and he wished to know her whereabouts in the future. The transition from Edward's reign to Harold's rule was smooth, as Harold had practically governed for years. Soon after his coronation, Norman barons arrived with a summons from Duke William, which Harold acknowledged respectfully. To gather more information, Wulf was sent along with a group to Normandy to assess the situation and the likelihood of a Norman invasion. Harold was prepared for a potential conflict with William and began uniting England for defense.|"['1. What significant events was Wulf present at recently?\nA. The coronation and the battle\nB.

The train was not large. A ship carried the thanes and their attendants from Southampton to Rouen. They were welcomed upon arrival, escorted to a designated house, and informed about meeting the duke the next day. Wulf, accompanied by Osgod, rode to the De Burgs' castle. It had been three years since his last visit. Despite gaining health and strength, Wulf could no longer partake in knightly activities due to a past injury. Upon arrival, a tall young man, Guy, embraced Wulf joyfully. Wulf explained the urgency of their mission's response to the duke.

The king, Harold, spoke to his loyal subject, Wulf, about the looming threat of the Normans. Wulf planned to keep a watchful eye and ear for any whispers of danger, even though he couldn't always be near Harold. The king shared his fears with Wulf, suspecting that some may plot against him to claim the English throne. Despite the uncertainties, Harold decided to journey north to win over the people who refused to recognize him as their king. The palace in Westminster, where the king resided, was not grand like those of later kings, reflecting the simpler times of England's history.

In the castle, a corridor connected the royal sleeping quarters to the officers' chambers. Wulf's room, designated by Harold, was on the right side of the corridor, next to the royal apartments. It was a simple cell with a straw pallet covered in sheepskins and a few rugs. Osgod, a loyal servant, suggested using a young apprentice to keep an eye on suspicious activities. Osgod's plan involved his father's apprentice, a clever boy who could pass for younger than he was. Osgod assured his ability to secure the boy's silence. The strategy was to have the apprentice observe and report any unusual behavior, especially concerning the king's safety.

Osgod explained that Ulf was in the early stages of learning, much like he had been at that age, running errands and assisting others.

During the three days between Ulf being assigned to track Walter Fitz-Urse and the king's departure for the North, the boy had no updates to share with Osgod. Walter had not left the bishop's residence unaccompanied. He had gone out with the bishop on several occasions and had mingled with some of his fellow Normans who still held positions at the court. In one of the disguises suggested by Wulf, the boy had lingered near the bishop's residence until late evening, but Walter had not emerged after dark.

Ulf was determined to keep a close eye on the situation while the king was away. He believed that if Walter Fitz-Urse went out in disguise for any secretive mission after dark, he would likely use one of the rear entrances of the palace. Ulf arranged for a friend to watch the front entrance while he positioned himself behind the palace. As darkness fell, he lay near the entrance where the palace staff usually passed through. The moon was up, casting shadows over the palace's rear, providing some cover for Ulf. He cautiously peered around the corner, observing those who left the palace. As the evening grew colder, Ulf shivered, anticipating each person's departure. Finally, a cloaked figure, taller than most, emerged from the palace. Ulf suspected it might be Fitz-Urse and decided to follow him closely to confirm his suspicions.|"[""1.

Ulf overheard a conversation between Fitz-Urse and a stranger in a language he couldn't understand. Frustrated, Ulf realized he was missing crucial information due to the language barrier. Concerned about a possible conspiracy against the king involving Fitz-Urse, Ulf decided to seek advice from his master, the armourer. The armourer, aware of Ulf's secret mission, listened as Ulf shared his suspicions about Fitz-Urse's involvement in a plot against the king's life.

Beorn, a trusted man in the kingdom, took on the task himself to protect the king's life. He sought advice from Ulf, a young boy trusted by Beorn's friend Wulf. Ulf suggested keeping watch for the plotters from 7 to 9 in the evening. Beorn agreed to join Ulf in the surveillance to ensure no suspicion arose. They planned to signal each other without alerting the plotters. As time passed, Harold's journey in the North was successful, gaining the people's trust.

The blacksmith realized that the ship might still be in the harbor due to the strong east wind. He decided to investigate the ships that recently arrived. After finding that twenty-five ships docked, he focused on the four ships from Rouen, Calais, and Flanders. The Flemish ship carried cloth, while the others had miscellaneous goods. The blacksmith suspected the men were on the Calais ship. He rented a room to spy on the ship, where he saw a man in Saxon cloak and Norman leggings boarding. Convinced it was the man they were looking for, the blacksmith planned to seek advice from his friend Wulf in London.

Half an hour later, the boat departed once more. A man accompanied the visitor and quickly disappeared below deck upon leaving the ship. Ulred promptly left, hailed another boat nearby, and headed to Westminster. Upon reaching his destination, he sent Ulf to Beorn. After hearing about the discovery, Beorn sought advice from the armourer on the course of action. The armourer expressed uncertainty due to the lack of evidence to support any accusations against the men with harmful intentions towards the king. They pondered over the possibility of the men's next move, considering the changing weather and Harold's imminent return to York.

The next morning, as they rowed near London Bridge, a boat approached. The day had just begun, and the light was still dim. Ulf noticed a boy in the approaching boat wearing an apprentice's cap and thought it might be Ernulf. The other boat stayed close to the shore as the tide started to flow out. The armorer instructed the boatman to row closer, and then called out to the boy. Ernulf explained that he had seen a ship setting sail early in the morning and rushed to deliver the message. The armorer decided to bring Ernulf on board, paid off the boatman, and headed back to Westminster with his apprentices. Upon their return, they discussed the urgency of the situation with Thane Beorn, who suggested sending a message to the Thane of Steyning and checking for ships sailing to the Humber.

The armorer in the city discovered that ships bound for the North were preparing to depart. One ship, known for its speed, was recommended by a trader. The armorer, accompanied by the trader, secured a passage on this ship. The owner informed them that they needed to board that afternoon to catch the tide. The shipmaster planned to sail swiftly down the river, aided by his knowledge of the channel and the expected moonlight. The armorer expressed concerns about the journey, considering the dangers of the sea and recent unrest in the North. Despite his reservations, he embarked on the voyage due to his loyalty to Harold. Meanwhile, Ulf, the armorer's companion, was excited about the adventure and eagerly explored the ship, interacting with the crew and observing the journey's progress as they sailed smoothly down the river towards their destination.|"['1.

"Do not worry, you are likely to arrive first. We may have already passed the other vessels. The wind was calmer yesterday, so they probably anchored when the tide changed.

Ulred, you acted correctly, and I sincerely thank you in the name of the king and myself. However, we lack evidence that Fitz-Urse is plotting against the king's life. It was unfortunate that Ulf couldn't understand the initial conversation he overheard, but I should have anticipated that any discussions Fitz-Urse had with others would be in Norman. I cannot believe I overlooked this possibility. While Fitz-Urse has learned our language during his time here, he would likely converse with Normans regarding this matter. I'll ponder the situation overnight before deciding our next steps. The king is safe within the bishop's palace, and Normans are unlikely to arrive for at least a day.

Before the king departed from York, Ulf diligently watched for the men he sought, but they were nowhere to be seen. Wulf had gifted a horse to the armorer, who rode beside Osgod while Ulf sat in a wagon. The king rode with Bishop Wulfstan, flanked by four thanes and followed by Wulf and Beorn. The queen's litter was guarded by housecarls, with more behind, and wagons and servants at the rear. Wulf and Beorn discussed potential threats, focusing on the king's vulnerability when mounting or dismounting. They speculated on various scenarios where the assailants could strike and escape.

Wulf instructed his companions to stand ready with their hands on their daggers, keeping a close eye on everyone approaching the king. The bishop and king were seated at the head of the table, surrounded by nobles and dignitaries. Wulf, Beorn, and Osgod opted out of supper to keep a watchful eye on the attendants.

Doors flung open along the corridor, revealing armed thanes and guests awakened by the chaos. The bishop and ecclesiastics joined the throng as the king orchestrated Wulf's care. Beorn revealed the plot, identifying the Norman leader, Walter Fitz-Urse, as the assailant. Harold urged fairness, acknowledging villains exist in all nations.

The bishop was unaware of the strangers and ordered a search. Beorn led the search and found two men escaping with horses. Wulf, wounded, was attended to by surgeons. The king decided to rest until morning, suspecting no others involved. Wulf's condition seemed slightly improved, giving hope. The king expressed gratitude for being saved by Beorn and his companions. Beorn assured the king that he would bring more information in the morning. The bishop's palace was searched, revealing monks' garments hidden in a room. The men who escaped were pursued but had a head start. Beorn suspected they might head for a ship down the river.

Beorn and Wulf worked together to unravel a plot against the king. Wulf suspected a Norman, Walter Fitz-Urse, who had returned to London under suspicious circumstances. The plot thickened when it was discovered that Fitz-Urse was holding secret meetings on a ship. Beorn and Wulf's vigilance paid off when they uncovered the truth and thwarted the attempt on the king's life. Despite the danger, the king reassured the people of his safety.

The violation of this oath led to the church supporting William in his cause against Harold, who was excommunicated. The conflict now took on a religious aspect. In England, the excommunication had little impact as most bishops and clergy were English and loyal to Harold. Even Norman bishops and abbots stood by Harold due to his generosity towards the church and his popularity among the English. However, on the Continent, William garnered support from Norman barons who provided ships and men beyond their obligations. William invited adventurers to join him in the crusade against Harold, promising spoils and land. Tostig, feeling betrayed by Harold, sought alliances with William and later Harold Hardrada of Norway. As preparations intensified in Normandy and Norway, Harold of England amassed a vast army and navy to defend against the impending invasions. Despite the immense efforts, the English forces eventually dispersed due to the prolonged inactivity, leaving England vulnerable.|"['1.

Upon arriving at the camp, Harold expressed his gratitude to Wulf for his brave service, promising a worthy reward if they were successful. However, Wulf humbly declined, content with his current possessions and the opportunity to aid England. Despite his refusal, Wulf was appointed commander of the housecarls from the south coast of Sussex, uniting them into a cohesive force. As the army dispersed, Wulf returned to Westminster with the king. There, he received a mysterious letter instructing him on the king's absence.

Edith was upset about the betrayal of England and the loss of the fleet. She wanted to know more about Harold, a man dedicated to serving his country despite personal sacrifices. Wulf reassured her that Harold was not unhappy, as he was focused on his duties and the welfare of his people. Edith, wanting to keep her identity hidden, suggested that Wulf leave before villagers start gossiping. Wulf promised to tell Harold about Edith without revealing her whereabouts.

Wulf, tell the king that despite our separation, I find solace in solitude, knowing he nobly fulfills his kingly duties. Assure him I never doubted sending him away was right. I have no plans for a cloister; I tend to my garden, do needlework, and help my neighbors. My health is good, and I have all I need except his presence. If I fall ill and am near death, I'll send for him, but we must not meet otherwise. The pain of parting again would outweigh the joy of seeing him. Our meeting brought joy, but until I call, we shouldn't meet. The king arrived, eager to hear news. Wulf shared his conversation with Edith. The king praised her wisdom and lofty words, understanding the complexities of their situation. Harold then discussed urgent news from Denmark about the Norwegian fleet. He entrusted Wulf to carry messages to the northern earls, warning them of the impending threat from Norway. Harold needed to focus on dealing with William's fleet, leaving the defense against Norway to the northern earls.

The king issued a royal decree commanding all governors and thanes to provide fresh horses and assistance. Osgod, ready for the journey to York, armed himself and secured two horses.

The message revealed that Harold of Norway was approaching with a massive fleet. There was speculation about his intentions, but preparations for defense were underway. Harold advised immediate mobilization of troops, but Morcar knew the Northumbrians' tendencies and preferred a cautious approach.

Wulf was given an apartment in the palace and treated as an esteemed guest. He was provided with money and sent messengers to London regularly. However, he grew concerned as the earls showed no readiness for the impending invasion. They continued hunting and hosting events, ignoring the approaching storm. Wulf's attempts to persuade them were dismissed. Finally, news arrived of a massive fleet entering the Tyne, led by Harold Hardrada. The Norsemen attacked Scarborough and Holderness, met with resistance but prevailed. The Northumbrian levies gathered in York. The earls, now realizing the severity of the situation, prepared for battle. Wulf, with his experience in war, advised on the defense strategy. The Norse army anchored near Riccall, ready to march on York. The English, including priests and monks, rallied to defend their land, inspired by past invasions.

Due to the difficulty in organizing the troops, the Norsemen were already in a defensive position when the English arrived. Wulf, after discussing with the earls, decided to attack rather than defend due to the lack of discipline in their freshly-raised troops. Morcar led on the left, Edwin on the right, and Wulf stood with Morcar. As the English charged, they initially pushed back the Norsemen, but the enemy's king led a fierce counterattack. Despite the valiant efforts of the English, they were soon overwhelmed and forced to flee. Wulf, with Osgod by his side, planned to retreat to a hidden path near the swamp edge if needed.

Bravely fighting, the Norsemen faced the English housecarls, also known as Thingmen. Caught off guard without their protective gear, the Norse warriors couldn't resist the English forces. Many Norsemen perished, some forced back across the bridge or drowned in the stream, filled with the fallen. A Norseman of immense strength held the narrow bridge, fending off the English until he was defeated by a clever spear attack from below. The English envoy offered Tostig a peaceful solution, urging him to return to his allegiance. Despite the tense standoff, battle ensued. The English with their battle-hardened housecarls clashed with the Norse shield-wall. The conflict was brutal, with axes and swords meeting in a fierce struggle.

The battle was fierce, and as night fell, the surviving Norsemen sought refuge on their ships. This was a historic battle showcasing English valor and endurance. Despite the victory, there was little celebration that night. The troops were exhausted, sleeping on the hard-won ground littered with fallen comrades. Wulf fought bravely alongside Harold, with Osgod protecting him throughout the day. Wulf emerged unscathed, but Osgod's arm was badly injured. Harold, though victorious, mourned the loss of many brave warriors and his brother. He planned for the wounded to be tended to and for the fallen to be honored.

Wulf quickly went down to the bridge, where Harold and his warriors lay down like soldiers on a battlefield. Soon, people from Helmsley arrived, bringing jugs, cups, and torches as instructed. The search began west of the river. Few English lay there, but many Norsemen. Wulf made sure everyone, friend or foe, got water. The living were few, as the heavy axes had done their job. After attending to the survivors, Wulf led the villagers across the bridge, instructing them to scatter and move forward. He then went to Osgod, who had taken care of his wound. Osgod mentioned seeking help in York for his wound. The king had sent for aid, and monks skilled in treating wounds would soon arrive. Osgod decided to rest, feeling exhausted. Lights appeared along the road as people from York came to help. The wounded were tended to, and the bodies of Tostig and the King of Norway were found. Harold offered mercy to the Norsemen, and they accepted, as their retreat was blocked by the English fleet.|"['1.

The following day, the Norse chiefs went to York, swore an oath, and were then escorted back to their ships. The battle had been so brutal that only twenty-four ships were needed to carry the survivors home. The task of burying the dead was too immense, leaving the battlefield covered in the bones of fallen invaders. Harold returned to York with his army, pardoning those who had turned against England. The wounded were cared for, and the troops rested for five days. Osgod, wounded in battle, endured treatment with bravery. He planned to stay with peasants until he healed. Meanwhile, Harold worked to settle affairs in the North. Thanes from Northumbria expressed gratitude for their deliverance. During a banquet, urgent news arrived: the Normans had landed in Sussex just days after the victory at Stamford Bridge.|['1.

While Harold and his army anxiously watched the sea on England's southern coast, the Duke of Normandy's mixed host awaited a favorable breeze at the port where the expedition gathered. William had an advantage with seasoned troops who were more obedient than Harold's levies bound by feudal obligations. The Normans, eager for plunder, were well supplied and ready to embark once the wind turned. After a delay at the port, they sailed north to St. Valery. Meanwhile, Harold marched to meet the King of Norway. The Normans prayed for a favorable wind, and when it came, they landed unopposed near Pevensey. The Normans harried the land, forcing Harold to assemble his thanes in York and call for defense. Messengers were sent to gather troops in London to repel the invasion. Wulf, rushing to Helmsley with news, found Osgod recovering from a wound, frustrated by the Norman threat.|"['1.

Harold, a valiant warrior, was determined to protect his loyal follower, Osgod. Despite Osgod's eagerness to join the battles in the South, Harold adamantly refused, citing the dangers and the need for rest. Harold knew the importance of Osgod's recovery and his value as a faithful companion. As Harold prepared to gather men for battle, he expressed relief that his troops were not lost during his absence. The news of Norman invasions heightened the urgency to assemble forces. Despite setbacks, Harold remained resolute in defending England against the impending threat. The loyalty and bravery of his men, including Osgod, would play a crucial role in the upcoming battles against the Normans.|"[""1.

Wulf doubted Edwin and Morcar's loyalty, suspecting they would easily betray York to William of Normandy to keep their earldoms. He planned to head to Steyning after resting to prepare for the imminent battle. Ulred assured him Harold would swiftly march south to confront the Normans, enraged by their destruction. The armorers worked tirelessly, anticipating the clash. Wulf organized his men to be battle-ready, ensuring the safety of the women and children. The looming confrontation with the Normans weighed heavily, but the resolve to defend England was unwavering. The community rallied, ready to face the invaders with courage and determination.|"[""1.

The men's arms were checked, and weapons from the armory were distributed to those in need. At one o'clock, the troop set off, led by Wulf and his housecarls, followed by 150 tenants. Each carried six days' rations. They camped in a forest 20 miles away, then marched 30 miles the next day to join the army gathering near London. Wulf was pleased to see Beorn had arrived with his men. They discussed recent battles and the traitorous thanes. The force included fighters from East Anglia, the West, and London, ready to defend against William. Harold visited Waltham Abbey to pray for victory. William demanded Harold's allegiance, but Harold refused, offering peace or battle. Gurth advised Harold to stay in London, but Harold chose to face William, rejecting the idea of harming fellow Englishmen or the land.|['1.

For six days, Harold waited in London for reinforcements from the North, but they never arrived. On Thursday morning, he led his army to confront the invaders as planned. Accounts vary greatly on the size of Harold's army. Norman writers exaggerate its numbers to boast of their victory, while English writers downplay it to explain the defeat. Harold, a skilled military leader, believed his forces were sufficient, especially after defeating the Norsemen. Despite misgivings from some, Harold's dedication to England was unwavering. Edith, filled with worry, doubted Harold's return from battle. She reflected on her sacrifices for him and feared for his safety. Amidst the uncertainty, Edith considered seeking solace in a convent, finding peace in the face of impending tragedy.|"['1.

Wulf sadly rode back to the camp, realizing the sacrifice made by Edith and Harold had not brought the Northern earls closer to the king. The marriage had not made Harold happy, but the people sympathized with his sacrifice for the country. Wulf thought it would have been wise for Harold to leave Gurth or Leofric behind to gather another army in case of defeat against the Normans. He feared that if all three brothers fell in battle, England would be left without a leader. Despite the concerns, Wulf's friend Beorn remained optimistic about their chances in battle. As the army reached the village of Senlac, where Harold planned to confront the Normans, the defensive position on rising ground gave them an advantage against the Norman cavalry. The stage was set for the decisive battle that would determine the fate of England.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did Wulf realize as he rode back to the camp?\nA) The sacrifice made by Edith and Harold had brought the Northern earls closer to the king.\nB) The marriage had made Harold happy.\nC) The sacrifice made by Edith and Harold had not brought the Northern earls closer to the king.\nD) The people did not sympathize with Harold's sacrifice.\nE) Wulf was content with the situation."", 'Question 2:\nWhy did Wulf think it would have been wise for Harold to leave Gurth or Leofric behind?\nA) To have someone to gather flowers for the army.\nB) To ensure the safety of his brothers.\nC) To have someone to make battle plans.\nD) To gather another army in case of defeat against the Normans.\nE) To have someone to cook for the soldiers.', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Wulf fear if all three brothers fell in battle?\nA) England would be left without a leader.\nB) England would have too many leaders.\nC) The Normans would retreat.\nD) The Northern earls would surrender.\nE) The army would celebrate.', 'Question 4:\nHow did Beorn feel about their chances in battle?\nA) Pessimistic.\nB) Indifferent.\nC) Fearful.\nD) Optimistic.\nE) Anxious.', 'Question 5:\nWhere did the army reach before the decisive battle?\nA) The forest of Sherwood.\nB) The village of Senlac.\nC) The town of York.\nD) The city of London.\nE) The castle of Windsor.', 'Question 6:\nWhat advantage did the defensive position on rising ground give the army against the Norman cavalry?\nA) It made the soldiers tired.\nB) It made it easier for the Normans to attack.\nC) It gave them a strategic advantage.\nD) It made the soldiers hungry.\nE) It made the soldiers sleepy.']"|['C) The sacrifice made by Edith and Harold had not brought the Northern earls closer to the king.', 'D) To gather another army in case of defeat against the Normans.', 'A) England would be left without a leader.', 'D) Optimistic.', 'B) The village of Senlac.', 'C) It gave them a strategic advantage.']
The hills rose steeply on the sides, forming a sort of peninsula where Harold's troops prepared for battle. The royal standard was raised as trees were felled to create a defensive palisade. Harold relied on his housecarls, well-trained warriors, over the undisciplined levies. As the night fell, a messenger arrived from William, challenging Harold to single combat for the crown. Harold refused, knowing the battle's outcome would not be determined in such a manner. Contrary to Norman claims, the English army did not spend the night feasting but rested after days of hard labor. Harold, a deeply religious and merciful man, prepared for the battle with prayer. In contrast, William of Normandy was known for his merciless tactics in warfare. Despite their equal abilities, Harold's nobility of character set him apart from William. The English troops, including Wulf and Beorn, slept with confidence in their leader and the shield-wall formation that had served them in past victories.|"['1.

Osgod assured his lord that he followed orders diligently but had to travel south from York to recover from a wound. He had been well supplied with money and arrived in London after a fortnight, walking a little each day to maintain his health. Monks had tended to his wound, and it was healing well. The troops, including the housecarls and the London citizens, prepared for battle against the Norman army. The Normans, under the command of the duke, also readied themselves, with archers and infantry in the front line. Both sides were well-informed about each other's strength and positions. The English were determined to defend their country by holding the hill against the invading forces. The battle was about to commence as the troops took their positions.|"['1.

"A trumpet sounded, marking the start of a fierce battle between the Normans and the English. The Norman archers unleashed a barrage of arrows towards the English defenders on the hill, who lacked archers and had few javelin-men. After several volleys, the archers stepped back, and the Norman infantry advanced. Before the infantry charged, a Norman minstrel named Taillifer made a daring but fatal attack. Despite the Norman infantry's advance up the hill, the English defenders fought fiercely, using stones, javelins, axes, clubs, and spears. The Normans struggled to break the English line, facing resistance from the housecarls and levies. The battle cry of the Normans was ""God help us!"" while the English invoked ""God Almighty and the Holy Cross!"" The Normans, including knights and horsemen, were unable to penetrate the English shield-wall, suffering heavy losses. Eventually, the Normans retreated, and the English levies on the right flank disobeyed orders and pursued the retreating Bretons, causing chaos. William of Normandy restored order, leading to a renewed and brutal struggle. William and his brother fought valiantly, as did Harold of England and his brothers. The battle resulted in the deaths of Gurth and Leofwin, but the English continued to fight fiercely. Despite the losses of the royal brothers, the English forces remained resilient and determined."|"['1.

William remounted his horse, but it was also slain. Eustace of Boulogne offered him his horse, and together they charged the English line. Despite their efforts, the English shield-wall held strong. On the French left, the Bretons broke through the palisade but failed to break the English line. William realized attacking head-on was futile. He devised a plan to feign retreat and lure the English out of formation. The English levies fell for the ruse, chasing the Bretons. The Normans seized the opportunity, charging into the gap left by the English. The battle continued for hours, with the English holding their ground. As twilight approached, William's archers targeted Harold and his thanes, fatally striking Harold.

In the midst of the fierce battle, Beorn bravely fought off Norman knights until he was on one knee, exhausted. Just when it seemed all hope was lost, a Norman baron intervened, reminding everyone of the duke's promise to spare their lives. Despite initial resistance, the Normans relented upon recognizing Beorn and Wulf for their past deeds. The Normans diverted their attention to other foes, allowing Beorn and Wulf to walk away with the baron. Meanwhile, Harold's standard and golden dragon banner were triumphantly taken by the Normans. Even after Harold's demise, his loyal housecarls continued to fight until darkness fell, inflicting heavy losses on the Normans.

The Normans, led by Sir William Malet, honored Harold with a proper burial by the coast. Edith, along with Beorn, Wulf, and two monks, carried his remains.

"Lord de Burg confidently assured, ""They will remain yours."" He explained that the duke's promise was public and that he would surely honor it.

Wulf described the intense battle where Harold died, leaving them in despair. De Burg reflected on the loss suffered in the fierce battle at Hastings. Following Harold's defeat, William became King of England, but many Englishmen refused to bow before him. The Northern earls hurried to London to choose a successor to the throne. Edwin and Morcar hoped to be chosen, but the Witan selected Edgar, grandson of Edmund Ironside. London prepared to resist as Alfred had done against the Danes. However, the treacherous Northern earls abandoned the cause, leaving the South vulnerable. William ravaged the coast, destroying Romney and accepting Dover's surrender. With no central authority, towns surrendered to William, realizing they couldn't resist the Normans alone. Canterbury and Kent followed suit, submitting to William's rule.|"['**Question 1:** What did Wulf describe in the text passage?\nA) The surrender of Dover\nB) The battle where Harold died\nC) The selection of Edgar as King\nD) The resistance of London\nE) The surrender of Canterbury', '**Question 2:** Who reflected on the loss suffered in the fierce battle at Hastings?\nA) Harold\nB) William\nC) Wulf\nD) De Burg\nE) Edgar', ""**Question 3:** What did the Northern earls do after Harold's defeat?\nA) Surrendered to William\nB) Chose Edgar as King\nC) Hurried to London to choose a successor\nD) Resisted William's rule\nE) Ravaged the coast"", ""**Question 4:** Who hoped to be chosen as King after Harold's defeat?\nA) Wulf\nB) William\nC) Edwin and Morcar\nD) De Burg\nE) Edgar"", '**Question 5:** What did London prepare to do after the selection of Edgar as King?\nA) Surrender to William\nB) Resist like Alfred against the Danes\nC) Abandon the cause\nD) Ravage the coast\nE) Choose William as their ruler', ""**Question 6:** What did towns realize when surrendering to William?\nA) They could resist the Normans alone\nB) They had a central authority to support them\nC) They could choose their own ruler\nD) They couldn't resist the Normans alone\nE) They were stronger than William's forces""]"|"['** B) The battle where Harold died', '** D) De Burg', '** C) Hurried to London to choose a successor', '** C) Edwin and Morcar', '** B) Resist like Alfred against the Danes', ""** D) They couldn't resist the Normans alone""]"
During the Norman conquest of England, the region of Kent played a vital role in the national defense. While many parts of England remained inactive, the villagers of Kent refused to risk their lives needlessly. The Duke of Normandy, William, faced resistance in London but strategically avoided a direct assault. Instead, he moved through the land, causing destruction until the citizens realized resistance was futile. Eventually, an embassy from London, led by the young uncrowned king, offered William the crown. Influenced by Norman prelates, William accepted and was crowned king of England. Two young thanes, Beorn and Wulf, who had fought for William, were generously rewarded with additional estates. Later, Lord de Burg proposed a marriage alliance between Wulf and his daughter, now that peace between Normans and English was secured.|"['1.
