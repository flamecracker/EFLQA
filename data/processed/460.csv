"There are always different ways to view things, but when it comes to a London fog, two perspectives are enough. Waking up to a thick, yellow fog that stings your throat can be eerie or strangely cozy. If you wake up feeling healthy and rested, watching the fire being lit can be comforting. The fog outside, making the morning seem like night, can seem picturesque and even funny. But for Antony Dart, waking up in a poor London lodging house is a stark contrast. Tormented by dreams and sleepless nights, waking up is dreadful. The clock strikes nine, marking the hour as the fire is lit, disrupting his futile attempts to return to sleep. His weary and anguished state is a daily struggle, haunted by a brain that distorts reality. Antony's life mirrors those who have been broken by the strain of existence, accumulating possessions while losing joy. The fear of being labeled as someone who ""worked too hard"" looms over him, questioning the purpose of a world where work can lead to such despair."|"[""1.

He had not led a particularly wicked life, not breaking laws, but the concept of Deity was not part of his existence. Lately, when the idea had crossed his mind, he found it unsettling. It drew him in, even though he resisted, argued, and sometimes felt like he was losing his mind. It felt like something was observing his thoughts and actions. A profound wonder struck him when he realized he had never considered it before. The thought haunted him, leading him to make a decision. He planned to end his life discreetly in a London lodging-house, leaving no trace behind. He had prepared a misleading letter to explain his disappearance as that of a failed man returning from Australia. He felt that with his brains scattered, he would finally find peace anywhere.|"[""1.

The dense fog outside made it easy for a person to get lost. The yellow mist seeped into the room, giving it a spooky appearance. Despite the smoldering fire, the man was determined to go out, regretting not buying a pistol the night before. He pondered about forgetting everything by the next day.

He examined his reflection in the old mirror, contemplating his rough appearance. The eerie silence in the room made him pause and listen, feeling the weight of his decision to face death.

He stood still, feeling a strange sense of withdrawal around him. The world seemed distant, life felt far away, even sound and breath were muted. Was this a symptom of the unnamed morbid thing? He needed to escape quickly, to avoid wandering aimlessly in this unknown state. The Silence enveloped him, calling out without words. Thoughts of an ancient presence waiting for his actions haunted him. As he descended the dim staircase, the fog outside hinted at an abnormality, reminiscent of past strange occurrences. The gas-lit pawnshop appeared through the haze, its eerie glow casting a ghostly pallor on the items in the window. Among the forgotten trinkets, the pistol he sought lay waiting. With caution, he navigated the fog-shrouded streets, where even a misstep could lead to danger in the thick mist.|['1.

After paying for his purchase, the man still had a five-pound note and some sovereigns left in his purse. He pondered on who would spend it and thought it might be best to give it away. As he left the shop, lost in thought, he failed to notice a silent hansom cab approaching. Startled, he dodged out of the way, unknowingly crossing the street backward. Confused, he wandered into unfamiliar territory, reminiscent of a foggy day three years ago. Feeling disoriented, he hoped the fog would clear. Eventually finding himself near the Embankment, he leaned against the parapet, hearing the water below. Hungry and alone, he contemplated the eerie feeling of being cut off from others. Despite his dark thoughts, he decided against any drastic actions and continued to search for his way back.|"['1.

As he stepped back, a coin fell with a solid sound on the pavement. Earlier, he had absentmindedly placed gold from his purse into his pocket to give to beggars. A sovereign slipped out, catching his attention. Nearby, a figure hidden under rags stirred. Revealing a small head with bright red hair and shrewd eyes, a girl peeked out. She quickly snatched the coin, fearing he would change his mind. The girl warned him not to give it away, hinting he was drunk from the night before. Despite her young age, her hardened demeanor captivated him. He hesitated, unsure of his next move. The girl shared how she had observed him, hiding in the sack to keep warm. She didn't want to interfere, recalling a distressing incident where a girl was forcefully taken away. The coin changed the situation for her.|"['1.

I haven't eaten since yesterday, just a slice of sausage I found on a trash heap. Let's go, sir."" She tugged his coat with her weathered hand. He glanced down, noticing the cracks had bled and were smeared with blood. Enclosed by fog, they stood together - the man with no future and the girl who seemed as old as him, with sharp features and a voice that belied her appearance. Drawn together by something, they moved forward. In the mist, they saw a man approaching. The fog lifted slightly, allowing them to guess the direction. Despite the impudent banter, a cheerful spirit lifted his mood, leading him to follow her. ""I'll fill my stomach first,"" he said with a grin. ""Then I'll get something hearty for Polly. She's only eighteen, trying to survive on the streets. She's not cut out for this life. A gentleman hit her last night, accidentally. She can't go out tonight, crying for her mother.

"The words themselves spoke. Why should he care about the attic or the girl? He didn't. He just wanted to return to his room with what he had gone out to buy. But he spoke nonetheless. His companion looked at him, visibly relieved. ""Would you like to be with her?"" she asked eagerly, as if discussing a simple business deal. ""She's pretty and clean, and she doesn't drink. If she's treated kindly, she'd be happier. She has a round face, light hair, and curly hair. Maybe you'd like her."" ""I'm happier than most,"" she continued.

Two or three men were hanging around the stand. Suddenly, a hand swiftly grabbed the sovereign from between two of them. The girl let out a scream as a young man dashed away. Antony Dart's blood boiled with anger, and he chased after the thief. Despite feeling like a good runner from a thousand years ago, Dart was surprised by his own speed. The chase led them through the street, an alley, and into a dead-end court. The thief, looking hungry and desperate, surrendered when Dart caught him. Dart, moved by the man's condition, gave him some silver and told him to get food and wait at Apple Blossom Court. The man, overwhelmed with relief, sobbed and thanked Dart. Dart felt like he was in a dream as he was led back to the coffee stand, where the proprietor, Barney, was serving coffee to a cheerful coster girl.|"['1.

Polly was puzzled by the sight of food on the table. She watched in awe as a fire was lit, transforming the room from darkness to warmth.

There is an old woman living on the floor below. She used to be pretty and dance in the halls when she was young. But as she aged, she became angrier and would fight like a wild cat. About a year ago, she fell down the stairs and broke both her legs. People in the house were surprised when a lady came to talk to her while she was recovering. The conversation brought cheerfulness to the old woman and the other women in the house. It wasn't a religion but more about finding joy in life. Even in the face of despair, this unexpected encounter brought hope and happiness. The old woman's outlook changed, and the community felt uplifted by her newfound positivity.|"[""1.
