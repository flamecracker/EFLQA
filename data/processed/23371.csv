Sailors are accustomed to sudden danger, especially in equatorial seas, and the need for quick action. The ship, _Sunshine_, swiftly reduced its sails as a fierce storm approached from the Sunda Straits. The captain and his son could only scud before the gale. As night fell, the storm intensified, causing damage to the ship's mast. Despite the chaos, the storm eventually subsided at daybreak. Nigel Roy, the amateur first mate, tried to lighten the mood with his father. The captain, a seasoned sailor, shared stories of the Keelin Islands, highlighting the challenges faced by early settlers. The islands were eventually annexed by the English Government.

Long before 1836, Hare left for Singapore, where he passed away, leaving Ross in charge, known as the 'King of the Cocos Islands.' With Ross's son's efforts, the Group flourished, trading coconuts and excelling in boatbuilding. However, the presence of unruly coolies from Java, initially criminals, caused unrest. The colonists enforced strict rules to maintain order, especially due to the threat of the Malays' unpredictable behavior. Mutinies by coolies led to constant vigilance. In 1862, a cyclone devastated the island, prompting Ross's son, an engineering student, to return and restore the settlement. He transformed the community, eliminating the chain-gang workers, promoting education, and fostering a prosperous and harmonious society. Despite a subsequent cyclone in 1876, the island thrived, with contented inhabitants and a resilient spirit.|"['1.

"Around midnight on the 28th, a fierce storm raged. Darkness enveloped the land, pierced only by lightning flashes. Thunder barely audible over the howling wind and crashing debris. In a bid for survival, people sought refuge in ditches and hollows. Mr. Ross and his group huddled by a wall near his home. A schooner, once nearby, now hurtled towards them atop a massive wave. ""Hold on!"" Mr. Ross yelled, ducking as the wave crashed over the wall, carrying his house away. Miraculously, the wall held, stopping the schooner just in time. Despite the devastation, the islands' inhabitants survived and thrived after the cyclone seven years ago. As night fell, the storm calmed, allowing them to navigate to the serene lagoon inside the ring of coral. Nigel Roy, fascinated by the marine life, marveled at the calm lake's beauty, encircled by coral reefs and lush islets.

After a long walk, Mr. Ross asked the captain about the latest news from civilization, especially about engineering inventions. The island king left them to attend to his duties. The captain then gave the boy two options: row a boat on the lagoon or visit a family he was fond of. They visited a neat cottage on the highest ridge with a view of the ocean and the lagoon. The children at the cottage were excited to see the captain, who entertained them with stories. Later, more children welcomed the captain. They were invited to dinner at Mr. Ross's house where the captain and the king talked until evening. The captain advised his son to focus on duty before pleasure, as they were blown off course and needed repairs before heading to Batavia. The captain recommended the boy seek Kathy Holbein's help for sketching, but the boy declined, confident in his own skills.|"['Question 1: What did the captain give the boy as two options after Mr. Ross asked about engineering inventions?\nA) Visit a marketplace\nB) Row a boat on the lagoon\nC) Climb a mountain\nD) Explore a cave\nE) Fly a kite', 'Question 2: Where did the captain and the boy visit, which had a view of the ocean and the lagoon?\nA) A busy marketplace\nB) An underwater cave\nC) A hidden forest\nD) A neat cottage on the highest ridge\nE) A desert oasis', 'Question 3: What did the children at the cottage do when they saw the captain?\nA) Ran away in fear\nB) Ignored him\nC) Invited him to play games\nD) Asked for stories\nE) Started crying', 'Question 4: What did the captain advise his son to focus on before pleasure?\nA) Watching TV\nB) Playing video games\nC) Duty\nD) Sleeping\nE) Eating candy', 'Question 5: Who did the captain recommend the boy seek help from for sketching?\nA) Jack Sparrow\nB) Captain Hook\nC) Kathy Holbein\nD) Blackbeard\nE) Peter Pan', ""Question 6: Why did the boy decline the captain's recommendation to seek Kathy Holbein's help for sketching?\nA) He didn't like Kathy Holbein\nB) He was confident in his own skills\nC) He was too shy to ask for help\nD) He wanted to surprise Kathy Holbein\nE) He preferred drawing on his own""]"|['B) Row a boat on the lagoon', 'D) A neat cottage on the highest ridge', 'D) Asked for stories', 'C) Duty', 'C) Kathy Holbein', 'B) He was confident in his own skills']

Both artists were so focused on their work that they stopped talking, and silence filled the air. Laughter echoed from a distance where Captain Roy entertained the Cocos-Keeling youngsters. The area was bustling with animal life, creating a peaceful atmosphere that reminded Nigel of paradise. Birds waded in the shallows, hermit crabs scuttled around, and overhead, gannets and terns perched in the trees. Nigel and Kathleen took a break to eat some nuts, and Kathy shared fascinating facts about a unique crab. After finishing their work, they found a young boy had sneaked aboard their boat. On the way back, Nigel and the boy marveled at the vibrant underwater world with colorful fish and coral formations.

Nigel marveled at the unique creatures in the shallow waters, resembling hedgehogs with sharp teeth for feeding on coral insects. The vibrant file-fishes also caught his eye with their bold stripes. As the captain mentioned sleeping aboard the ship due to a fair breeze outside, Nigel relished the time left in the paradise-like setting. The damaged brig sailed towards Sunda Straits with a steady wind, heading to Batavia in Java. Upon arrival, the captain inspected the ship, revealing the need for extensive repairs. Nigel, eager for adventure, accepted a holiday and a small sum to explore the Malay Archipelago. Armed with curiosity and his father's name, he set out to gather information on the diverse lands and cultures awaiting him.|"[""1.

Tired of his studies, Nigel wandered towards the port in the afternoon and idly observed a man preparing to set sail. Despite what philosophers may argue, our preferences stem from deep unknown reasons, not experience. Love at first sight is proof. Nigel, intrigued by a black boatman, felt a strong connection, though they had never spoken. The boatman, known as the hermit of Rakata, lived near Krakatoa. The boatman suggested Nigel meet his master, the hermit, despite his reclusive nature. The hermit had recently suffered a loss and might welcome company.

You don't need to write long letters, just keep me informed. As for the rest, save the stories for when you return."" The boat journey along Java's northern shore to Sunda Straits was uneventful.

As they approached Krakatoa, the negro pointed out the island's peaks to Nigel. There were three main peaks: Perboewatan at 400 feet in the north, Danan at 1500 feet in the center, and Rakata over 2600 feet in the south where the hermit lived. Nigel inquired about recent mountain activity, but the negro only mentioned rumblings and cracks. The boat docked in a hidden harbor, camouflaged by dense bushes. The path to the hermit's abode was rugged, winding through cliffs and forests. Nigel struggled to keep up with Moses, who led him to a concealed cave entrance. Climbing ledges and lava masses, they encountered a gentleman on a cliff platform who welcomed Nigel and apologized for the deception.|['1.

In a tropical setting, Nigel encountered a towering stranger with a gentle demeanor. Despite Nigel's height, the stranger stood several inches taller. The visitor expressed interest in traveling with Nigel, offering his assistance. The hermit, Nigel's host, then led them to his hermitage, where they enjoyed a view of the strait and Java shores. Inside the hermitage, Nigel was amazed by the bright, sun-like light that filled the chamber. The hermit explained that he dabbled in science, which allowed him to create this unique environment. The hermit then invited Nigel and his companion to breakfast, revealing that he was not a typical hermit but rather someone who enjoyed the comforts of life.

The cave, serving as both a dining and kitchen area, lacked a tablecloth but held a stove emanating savory scents. Nigel noticed his reserved host's polite but quiet demeanor, speaking softly to both Nigel and Moses. As they dined on fish, meat, and cakes, Nigel tried to learn more about his host's unusual choice of abode but found him evasive. The hermit explained that Nigel's role would be as an attendant, companion, and shorthand note-taker on their upcoming canoe journey. Suddenly, the cave shook from an earthquake, prompting a discussion on the region's volcanic activity. Moses shared insights, and the hermit explained the island's volcanic history, cautioning that even supposedly extinct volcanoes could become active again. Despite the tremors, the hermit and Moses remained unfazed, accustomed to the island's seismic nature.|"[""1.

The hermit showed Nigel the powerful telescopes and microscopes in his hut, explaining how he used them to explore nature's wonders. He revealed his ingenious system of mirrors that directed sunlight into his cave, even when the sun moved. The hermit then pointed out distant mirrors on a summit that redirected sunlight to his cave. He shared insights about volcanic disturbances and ancient crater remnants visible through the telescope. Nigel noticed smoke rising from the supposedly extinct Perboewatan peak, hinting at a possible eruption. The hermit explained the island's history and potential volcanic activity.

Returning to the cave, they found the active man had finished breakfast, washed dishes, and prepared to venture into the forest. Instead of following them, we focus on their day exploring the lush island, visiting extinct craters, bathing in hot springs, and collecting botanical and geological specimens. Returning to the cave, they were greeted by Moses lighting oil lamps. After a silent supper, they retired to rest. Nigel observed the hermit and Moses in deep conversation, then saw the hermit in solemn contemplation. Suddenly, a sense of dread awoke Nigel to the sounds of a volcanic eruption. The hermit explained the eruption as a moderate one, possibly preventing a more violent explosion.|"['1.

"The volcanic eruption at Krakatoa was far from what could be called ""moderate."" The cone of Perboewatan showed intense activity, with molten lava, rocks, pumice, and dust being hurled high into the air. The observers saw fiery flashes and heard loud explosions, while smoke and steam billowed forth. The hermit, observing from a safe distance, believed that the energy would likely vent through other cones first. As the explosions continued, fine white dust fell like snow, covering the island's lower parts. Despite the spectacle, Nigel and Moses, a bit unnerved, discussed the possibility of the end of the world. The hermit, Van der Kemp, reassured them that the worst might be over, but Nigel felt it safer to leave the island until the volcano calmed down. Meanwhile, in Batavia, a group of sightseers, including Captain David Roy, planned an excursion to witness the eruption, expecting an unusual and thrilling experience."|['1.

The group arrived at the volcanic eruption site on the morning of the 27th, after witnessing strong explosions and feeling earthquake tremors the night before. Krakatoa and nearby islands were covered in white dust resembling snow. Trees on some islands were stripped of leaves by falling pumice. The steamer approached the active eruption cone, Perboewatan, landing the group nearby. Explosions occurred every few minutes, lighting up the steam-cloud with a fiery glow. The vapor column rose nearly 10,000 feet, with pumice fragments shooting up 600 feet. The merchant shared experiences of pumice blown high into the atmosphere. Captain Roy warned of the challenging terrain and dense forests. Nigel, curious about the expedition, observed the massive crater below, with a deafening roar and steam-cloud spewing pumice and glass fragments.|['1.

When Nigel and his companions reached the volcano summit, the sight and sounds of the erupting volcano left them in awe. Nigel, lost in the spectacle, didn't notice the arrival of other visitors until Moses, equally amazed, pointed them out. Among the visitors was an elderly man who stood nearby, captivated by the volcanic fires. Nigel and the man were speechless for a moment before exchanging hearty handshakes. Meanwhile, a photographer set up his camera to capture the scene. Nigel introduced Moses, their guide, who would lead them back to the cave. The captain declined a visit to the hermit of Rakata due to the challenging terrain, opting to enjoy the volcano's spectacle instead. As they parted ways, Nigel's father advised him to stay safe on their upcoming travels to wild places.|"['1.

The old seaman and his son embarked on separate journeys, shaking hands before parting. The son followed Moses through the forest towards a hermit's cave, while the old seaman sailed swiftly down the cinder-cone. The next morning, Van der Kemp and his companion woke early, leaving their guest to rest. Meanwhile, Nigel, feeling restless, explored the surroundings. He stumbled upon a mysterious cavern and encountered the hermit, who revealed a unique canoe. The hermit explained the design of the canoe, inspired by Eskimos, with special saddles for paddling efficiency.

The adventure was about to begin. In just an hour or two, they would set sail from the beach near the cave. The hermit, Van der Kemp, had everything ready for their journey. Nigel, the newcomer, was amazed at the preparations. Bags of pemmican, casks of water, gunpowder, tea, sugar, and biscuits were neatly packed in the canoe's compartments. A small monkey named Spinkie, the guardian of the craft, joined them. Nigel quickly bonded with the affectionate monkey. After a simple breakfast, they packed their beds, ammunition, and tools. Nigel learned how to wear an oil-skin apron to keep dry in bad weather. As they launched the canoe, Nigel marveled at the contraption.

The hermit explained how the canoe was protected from the waves by various mechanisms. He showed a pump that could keep leaks under control and a watertight box under the deck. The box contained useful tools and a small sail. The hermit preferred using a paddle over the sail. Nigel was intrigued by the mysterious hermit and the monkey, Spinkie, who joined them on the canoe. As they glided over the water, Nigel pondered the purpose of their voyage and the hermit's enigmatic life. The sun rose, casting a golden hue over the sea and the distant lands. Passing through the Sunda Straits, they entered a vast archipelago. The hermit and his companions enjoyed a quiet journey, occasionally exchanging words about the surrounding landscape. Later, the negro shared a baked bird with Nigel and Spinkie, who eagerly devoured the meal.|"['1.

Nigel sat back, enjoying the warmth of the sun on his bronzed face, a biscuit in one hand and a drumstick in the other. He watched the tranquil sea, feeling at ease under the equatorial sun. Van der Kemp and Moses shared his contentment. Sea-birds circled the canoe, hoping for scraps of food. Nigel and Van der Kemp happily obliged, feeding the grateful creatures. Nigel believed animals, like dogs, showed gratitude. He shared his biscuit with Spinkie, a monkey, who quickly snatched it away. Refreshed by a cold drink, the trio resumed paddling towards a wooded islet near Java to spend the night. Passing native vessels and ships laden with goods, they received cheers of recognition. As night fell, they landed on the islet, gathering fuel and coconuts for the evening. The hermit prepared a meal, and Spinkie, content with his biscuit, retired for the night.

"""But the forest isn't very valuable for trading,"" said our protagonist, changing tactics successfully. Van der Kemp looked surprised, almost making him laugh. ""Not valuable for trade?"" he repeated. ""Forgive me, but it seems you know little about us. The world is vast, and one can't know everything."" The hermit resumed smoking and gazing at the fire thoughtfully. Nigel, feeling hopeless, tried once more, ""My friend, it's clear you don't know much about our islands.

The fire had dwindled, not needed for warmth. The dim moonlight made Moses blend with the dark bush. A boat neared the island, likely staying the night. The Malay crew landed on the other side, ensuring our group's safety. As the moon rose, two men approached, their voices audible. Nigel noticed Van der Kemp's fierce expression, a stark contrast to his usual calm demeanor. Nigel, following Van der Kemp's lead, readied the canoe for a swift departure.

The dark night had become even darker as a thick bank of black clouds covered the sky, hiding the moon and most of the stars. It was hard to see anything beyond a few yards. The stillness was eerie, with only a few lights reflecting in the water below. Krakatoa's distant fires could be seen on the horizon, adding to the tense atmosphere. Nigel felt a mix of awe and fear, wishing he was safe on land or his father's ship. Van der Kemp, the hermit, gave orders to prepare the canoe for the impending storm. Nigel and Moses, the other crew member, quickly followed instructions to secure the sails and gear. As the wind picked up, the canoe was hit by a strong wave, submerging it momentarily.

The hermit, Nigel, and Van der Kemp faced a fierce storm in their canoe. The waves crashed over them, making them drenched but the oiled aprons kept them somewhat dry. With great effort, they turned the canoe against the wind and sailed swiftly. Thunder and lightning added to the excitement. They lowered the sails to stay safe and used a floating anchor to ride out the storm. The waves were so strong that they had to bow their heads and pray for safety. The hermit, Moses, shared his experience of facing such storms before. They remained in the midst of the raging sea until the storm finally subsided.

When the mast was raised again and the sails were hoisted, the boat sped away swiftly like foam on the wind. Sunshine broke through the clouds, painting a spot of green on the sea. Van der Kemp opened the fore-hold, and Spinkie leaped out, taking his place by the mast. The wind calmed, and the sails were unfurled as the travelers sailed on. The sun cleared the sky, calming the ocean. Nigel and Van der Kemp discussed their journey to Borneo. Suddenly, they spotted something in the distance, causing a stir of excitement. Moses prepared a rope with hooks, connecting the canoe to a nearby steamer. As the steamer slowed down, the crew prepared to tow the canoe alongside.|['1.

"""Pull in the lines!"" shouted the captain, and suddenly the canoe was lifted in the air, held steady by Van der Kemp and Moses. Simultaneously, the steamer surged forward at full speed.

Keep the ball rolling, boys, and each one do his best to make the world a happy one - for that's how man is blessed. Treat others around you with kindness and goodness, and in return, they will do the same for you. The sailors, who were clearly delighted, joined in the chorus as they sailed through the Malay Sea towards Borneo. The weather improved, and after a smooth journey, they were lowered into their canoe near Borneo. The captain bid them farewell, expressing his wish for future encounters. As darkness fell, they paddled up a stream surrounded by mangrove trees. Nigel's vivid imagination made the roots look like moving snakes in the water. Unbeknownst to them, they were nearing a group of people known as Head Hunters, who believed in gruesome rituals. The adventurers stumbled upon a camp of pirates, and with swift and silent actions, they decided to land and observe."|['1.

Nigel found it strange that his master had to stalk strangers twice in a short time. History seemed to repeat itself quickly in those regions. Nigel worried about the risk of his master being discovered, but the negro assured him that his master had experience with Vaqueros and hunting with the Indians, making him fearless. They discussed a plot they overheard and the danger it posed to a friend living with the tribe to be attacked. Nigel volunteered to help save his friend. The hermit shared his concerns about the risks they faced, but they armed themselves and set off in a canoe, hoping to pass the Dyaks unnoticed. However, the pirates detected them, and a tense confrontation ensued.|"[""1.

"""No need for hiding anymore,"" Van der Kemp said calmly. ""We must paddle for safety. Nigel, if you must use your weapons, do so wisely. Moses knows my thoughts on this and needs no reminder. Taking a life is easy, but only God can grant it."" The hermit added, ""They are strong, with many to switch out, which may help them catch up in calm waters. But a few miles ahead, a rapid will slow them and only briefly pause us. If we reach it, we'll be safe."" As they approached the rapid, Moses spotted the pursuing boat and a tall figure in the bow. Suddenly, the figure fell back with a crash and a yell, causing confusion. Soon, they navigated the canoe through the shallow rapid, using every stone to their advantage. The hermit planned to outsmart their pursuers by crossing land spits, gaining distance in an hour that would take the pursuers a day. After a few hours, they found a spot to camp for the night, with the bushes so dense that they had to feel their way in the dark.

Moses thanked Nigel and handed him some food, reminding him not to kick their sleeping master's head. As they settled down for the night, the only sounds were the creatures of the night and the river. Nigel woke feeling like he was buried alive, accidentally touching Van der Kemp's head, leading to a chain reaction of awakening. The monkey, Spinkie, usually nestled with Moses, observed their morning routine silently. They journeyed inland all day, noticing the changing landscape from swamps to lush forests and hills. Eventually, they encountered a man, a boy in native attire, and a large orangutan by a fire. The man, a mix of Dutch, American, and Malay descent, greeted Van der Kemp with joy, known as the Professor for his passion for collecting specimens.|"[""1.

Nigel and the naturalist quickly developed a strong bond when they discovered their shared passion for studying nature. The naturalist, Verkimier, expressed his excitement at exploring and finding butterflies together. However, their plans were interrupted by the hermit, who warned them of a conspiracy against the Rajah, a friend of theirs. Despite the danger, Nigel and Verkimier were determined to continue their pursuit of butterflies. As they ventured into the forest the next day, they marveled at the towering trees, lush greenery, and exotic fruits like the Durian. Verkimier's enthusiasm for the unique flora and fauna was infectious, and Nigel found himself captivated by the beauty of the wilderness around him.|"['1.

Nigel Roy and his companions came across a unique fruit known as the Durian. The fruit, described as having a tough outer rind covered in sharp spines, hides a delicious creamy pulp inside. Despite its offensive smell, the Durian is said to have an exquisite taste that surpasses all other fruits. Nigel, initially put off by the smell, took a leap of faith and tasted the fruit, becoming a fan instantly. As they enjoyed their meal under the fern canopy, they discussed the dangers of the Durian's spikes and the potential harm they could cause.

The young orangutan was not just a mere companion but a skilled tree climber who could fetch fruit swiftly from tall trees. His ability to climb and retrieve fruit amazed his human companions who would have taken longer and needed a bamboo ladder. Verkimier pointed out a pitcher-plant to Nigel, explaining how abundant they were in the region, trailing on the ground and climbing over shrubs. Nigel noticed the diverse orchids and the scarcity of flowers in the equatorial forest. They encountered a tree that left Nigel speechless, planted itself mid-air, and sent roots down and branches up. The professor intended to surprise Nigel with various wonders, including the orangutan fetching fruit, before they were interrupted by a Dyak youth sent by the Rajah to summon them back to the village.|"['1.

"Alas! We must go. It is dangerous to disobey the Rajah, and I am sorry that I cannot show you the butterflies today. No matter, go and tell your chief we will come. Better luck next time! The next morning, they set out at daybreak. The landscape had become more hilly, with Dyak villages visible on hilltops. They crossed gullies and rivulets using bamboo bridges. The professor explained the significance of bamboo to the natives, used for bridges, houses, and planks. Bamboo was vital for the Dyaks, serving various purposes like making paths along cliffs and as cooking vessels. The Dyaks harvested honey from bees hanging their combs on the Tappan tree. They used bamboo for ladders, aqueducts, sheaths, and more. The river was reached by mid-day, where they boarded a native boat to the Rajah's village. Nigel was warmly welcomed due to his association with Van der Kemp, a well-liked figure in the Malay Archipelago. Later, the professor praised Van der Kemp's exceptional qualities of kindness, selflessness, and capability, noting his underlying sadness.

Verkimier, while devouring a chicken breast, mentioned hunting for the orang-utan, known as the mias by the natives. Nigel joked, causing Moses to stifle a laugh turned sneeze.

They didn't find one but learned of their presence nearby. The group, including the hermit and Moses, embarked on a forest expedition.

The hunters were in hot pursuit of a massive orangutan after the professor's shot hit it. The creature moved swiftly through the trees, forcing the hunters to run to keep up. With caution and agility, the orangutan leaped from branch to branch, making it hard for the hunters to get a clear shot. Finally, the creature was cornered on a tree where the hunters aimed their rifles. Despite several shots, the orangutan continued to evade capture.

The hunt was abruptly stopped, and preparations began to transport the wounded man and two orangutans to the Dyak village. Bamboo poles were used as a makeshift litter. The large orangutan causing trouble was not tall but very broad. The professor measured it and found it to be of the largest size. Despite severe injuries, the wounded man's bones were intact, thanks to the hermit's quick action. While Moses cooked supper, Van der Kemp tended to the wounded man, and Nigel and the professor had an interesting conversation about animals near the stream.

The villagers were fascinated by the white hunters, staring as though they were watching strange creatures. Despite this, they showed great hospitality, offering their best food without expecting anything in return. The women adorned themselves with brass rings, covering their arms and legs, along with red-stained rattan petticoats and belts of brass ring-armour. The village was on edge due to news of pirates led by the notorious Malay pirate Baderoon. Nigel noticed his friend, Van der Kemp's, expression change upon hearing Baderoon's name, showing a mix of anxiety and determination. Van der Kemp feared encountering Baderoon, knowing the pirate's vendetta against him. The hermit, sensing danger, advised Nigel to flee on a trader's vessel bound for Sumatra before dawn to avoid Baderoon's wrath.|"['1.

We need to travel in the dark at the start of our journey to avoid Baderoon, who has sharp senses. After resting during the day where we can't be easily found, we'll move again at night to get far from land by daybreak. Verkimier plans to take a trader's boat to Sumatra, and they agree to meet there. Nigel will find a passing vessel to take him to an eastern port where a friend's steamboat is loading. The plan is to leave his canoe at Telok Betong in Sumatra and meet there. They set out on their voyage, floating silently downriver towards the sea. They spend the day hidden among mangrove bushes, sleep, and then continue their journey at night. Spinkie, the loyal pet, secretly joins them on the canoe. Despite being pursued by a pirate scout, they manage to escape due to favorable weather conditions. They sail swiftly towards Sumatra, occasionally resting on small isles to refill supplies.|"[""1.

We will not detail their journey through Sumatra, a large island comparable in size to the British Isles, where they faced rough weather but safely reached a port just in time to catch the steamer they sought. Van der Kemp entrusted his boat to the captain, who offered to drop it off at Telok Betong. Reluctantly, Spinkie had to come along. Moses, never shy to share his thoughts, advised Van der Kemp to continue on, leaving the professor behind. They spent days packing provisions based on each person's strength, with the professor carrying the lightest load due to his habit of wandering off. One evening, they reached a rocky hill with a view of dense forests. Van der Kemp led them down a forest path towards a village.

The villagers warmly welcomed Van der Kemp and his group, offering them a lavish supper. They had adopted Western customs, using Congreve matches and embracing modern conveniences. The locals displayed their wealth through gold and silver ornaments, including necklaces made of coins. The professor, eager to study the region's biodiversity, was provided a house on the village outskirts. He set up a lamp to attract insects for observation, filling the room with moths and beetles. Despite the professor's nocturnal activities, Nigel struggled to sleep due to the constant movement and noise.

The naturalist had a thrilling adventure capturing a rare bat, the _Caelops frizii_, only to have a lamp crash, causing chaos. The hermit and others rushed in to help, ensuring no fire started. Once the chaos settled, the professor was urged to rest for the next day's forest exploration. As the early morning unfolded, Moses, an eager angler, enjoyed fishing in the river, where he felt the joy of the catch. With the village's coffee gardens and dense underwood, the expedition yielded a bounty of specimens that exceeded expectations. The professor, thrilled with the discoveries, suggested splitting up for further exploration. The group agreed, ready to spend weeks in this paradise.|"['1.

The man, brave, faced it. Slowly, he took out a matchbox, lit a match, revealing binoculars. The tiger fled. Another shot was heard, and the man rejoiced.

At breakfast, Van der Kemp shared his plan to leave the village immediately after his encounter with the Malay lad. Although the professor was initially reluctant due to the rich wildlife and butterflies in the area, he eventually agreed to depart for safety. Moses, unfazed, noted that leaving or staying made no difference to him. Van der Kemp assured the professor of more research opportunities ahead and invited him to explore his island cave for further study. The professor, enticed by the description of the island's flora and fauna, eagerly agreed to depart. As they prepared to leave, Nigel reflected on the professor's change of heart, likening it to a shift from paradise regained to paradise forsaken. The party set off at daybreak under Babu's guidance, aiming to reach the next town. Nigel marveled at the professor's calm courage and speculated on his motivations, emphasizing his friend's actions driven by love and occasionally money. Upon reaching the crowded town, they attracted attention, including a discreet observer with a bandaged head and a hidden kriss.|"[""1.

Baderoon, a crafty pirate, managed to outsmart his foes by uncovering their schemes and arriving ahead of them in town. Disguised, he awaited their arrival. Babu, with his friends, sought help from the town's chief, who promised to apprehend the pirate upon his arrival. They were given shelter for the night. Later, in the dead of night, the pirate crept beneath the house where his target, Van der Kemp, lay. Listening to their conversation, he waited for the right moment to strike. When the time came, he thrust his blade between the bamboo floorboards, but instead of his target, he fatally wounded Babu. Van der Kemp, in a sorrowful moment, held Babu's hand as he passed, leaving the hermit with a vengeful resolve.|"[""1.

Revenge could have been sought against Baderoon by the hermit, but the murderer was nowhere to be found. Hidden in the dense jungle, he evaded capture. As dawn broke, a search party found no trace of him. The maniacal murderer, devoid of any concern for his own safety, waited for his chance among some lumber. Suddenly, shouts and screams filled the air as a frenzied man approached, wielding a bloody knife. The hermit, with an otherworldly intensity, defended himself against the maniac's attack. The villagers, driven by fear, joined the fray, and the hermit protected the maniac from their wrath.

The recluse awoke from his reverie, recalling his daring escape. Exhausted, he clung to a dead coconut tree after swimming desperately. Rescued by fishermen, he settled on Krakatoa. He lamented never finding his lost love, presumed dead. Nigel, eager to confide in someone, discussed his supposed discovery with Verkimier, who suggested quinine for his nerves. Nearby, a monkey observed the exchange with curiosity. Nigel, emphasizing caution, bantered with Moses, who vowed loyalty to Van der Kemp.

Upon reaching the village, they discovered a lavish feast awaiting them in the public hall. The spread included fruits, fowl, rice, and corn. However, their joy was dampened by a recent event - a young man had been fatally attacked by a tiger. The hermit, acting as their interpreter, explained that the tiger had ambushed the man and his friends in the jungle. The brave youths fought off the tiger, but sadly, their friend did not survive. Despite their eagerness to see the tiger trap, they decided to first honor the meal provided. Later that evening, Nigel expressed his desire to hunt the tiger. He borrowed a rifle and climbed a tree near the grave, waiting for nightfall. As darkness enveloped the jungle, Nigel's nerves were tested by eerie sensations and ghostly thoughts, despite his disbelief in the supernatural.|"['1.

While he felt uneasy, surrounded by the dark and silent jungle, a chilling wail pierced the night, causing Nigel's bones to tremble. The haunting sound grew louder, sending shivers down his spine until it faded into a mournful sigh. Nigel tried to laugh it off, but the wail returned, more dreadful than before. As the night wore on, the continuous wail became familiar, and Nigel realized it was a mourning ritual for the deceased. The moon's gentle light comforted him, revealing a tiger approaching. In a moment of panic, Nigel shot the tiger with a giant arrow, causing a commotion among the natives. They sought revenge on the slain tiger, using its parts as charms. Nigel, eager to reunite a father and daughter, hastened his journey home with Van der Kemp, who felt an unexplained urgency to return to his island cave.|"[""1.

Nigel suggested that the hermit's unease might be due to presentiments, hinting at the future's potential for the hermit. The hermit dismissed this notion, attributing presentiments to indigestion or a disordered mind. Nigel pointed out the unique circumstances of the hermit leaving home for the first time in about two hundred years, coinciding with Krakatoa's eruption. Meanwhile, a group of monkeys in Sumatra caught the travelers' attention. The monkeys were playing a risky game of leaping from branch to branch. One tiny monkey with a corkscrew tail hesitated to jump, garnering the sympathy of its companions. Ultimately, the little monkey took a leap, missed its mark, and fell to the ground, showcasing its courage and determination. The professor admired the monkey's bravery and refused to harm it despite wanting it as a specimen.|"[""1.

"The professor's self-denial was about to pay off when Van der Kemp's soft ""hush!"" halted the group. The hermit, with a low voice, pointed out a splendid Argus pheasant. The professor, eager to see the bird's love-dance, followed quietly with binoculars and rifle in hand. They reached a spot to watch the male and female pheasants. The male displayed its beauty by strutting and pluming its feathers in a circle cleared of debris. Later, they encountered a river with no bridge. Eventually, they found a fallen tree serving as a natural bridge. On the other side, they navigated a dense forest with metallic tiger-beetles and butterflies. The path was obstructed by rattan-palms and a massive mud-bath from elephants, causing delays but overcome with determination."|"[""1.

"""Look, Moses, it's like a beautiful butterfly, called Ornit'optera, that flies during the day,"" Verkimier explained as he stood up carefully. ""It copies the Trepsichrois mulciber. And just this morning, I found a Leptocircus virescens, which stays safe by pretending to be a dragonfly.""

""It's not all nonsense, Moses. These are the scientific names of the animals, and many creatures pretend to be something they're not for protection. Even humans do it. You do it too,"" the hermit said with a playful look. ""When you're scared silly, don't you act like nothing's wrong?""

""Never, sir, never!"" replied Moses seriously. ""When I'm nearly losing it, and my insides feel like warm water, I turn pale and my lips go blue, and I don't pretend--I don't care who sees it!""

The path ahead became rougher as they walked on, the rain started, and night fell dark and gloomy with no village in sight. The porters carrying Verkimier's boxes were exhausted, but they urged on, saying the village was close. The darkness grew thicker, and distant rumblings hinted at a storm. They had to camp to scare off tigers and elephants, with the hermit suspecting volcanic activity nearby.

Van der Kemp explained that the glowing lights were just phosphoric light caused by the electric state of the atmosphere. As darkness enveloped them, the exhausted porters fell asleep despite the dangers lurking around. The professor, Moses, managed to create a spark and kindled a fire, bringing light and comfort to the weary travelers. The forest came alive with glowing mushrooms, fireflies, and other luminescent creatures. The travelers found solace in the unexpected light, driving away the darkness and fear of the night.

The leader gave the necessary tools to his guest and guided him just outside the village before sunset. Equipped with a rifle, a revolver, a long knife, and a spade, the visitor was left alone. He carefully surveyed the area, anticipating where the tiger would emerge to attack the goat. He dug a hole opposite that spot, concealing himself in it. As darkness fell, the man positioned himself in the pit, ready with his weapons. He reflected on a past encounter with a tiger while waiting for the current one. Unexpectedly, the tiger approached from a different direction, catching the man off guard.

The professor, in a daring act, fired his revolver at a tiger trapped in a confined hole. The resulting crash was so tremendous that he thought the weapon had exploded. The tiger's struggles intensified, making the situation more dangerous. The professor's friends, armed and ready, rushed to the scene upon hearing the shots. With Herculean strength, Van der Kemp moved the tiger aside and revealed the unharmed professor. Despite being deafened by the revolver, the professor continued his adventures.

Not long after, a loud roar startled the two porters as a mud-lake shot up into the air, accompanied by steam and a thunderous noise. The porters tumbled down the slope in fear, but the mud-lake settled back calmly. That evening, the travelers camped near the crater, dining on roasted fowls cooked over steam vents. The professor, occupied with catching butterflies, brought a sense of peace despite the volcanic activity. Nigel suspected nearby volcanoes were active, prompting Van der Kemp to consider relocating due to his cave possibly sitting atop an old volcano.

The group followed a guide to a dangerous spot with boiling mud and cracks emitting scalding vapors. Nigel and a stranger ventured too close to the central pond, but the guide warned them to stay back. Suddenly, the ground gave way beneath the guide, and he fell into the dangerous pit. Nigel rushed forward to help but was pulled back by the hermit just in time. The stranger disappeared into the pit with a shriek. This terrifying event left Nigel and his companions in shock, affecting their mood and behavior.

The hermit expressed his relief upon learning that the Rakata peak remained calm on the island's southern side where his cave was located. He then set off to check on his canoe, leaving his companions behind. The town of Telok Betong, severely affected by the 1883 eruption, sat at the head of Lampong Bay, opposite Krakatoa. The town was a mix of European residents and a diverse population of natives, Chinese, Arabs, and traders from various islands. Each resident built their house uniquely, creating a charmingly chaotic town. The hermit found his canoe with his loyal monkey, Spinkie, guarding it fiercely. Spinkie showed immense joy upon reuniting with the hermit, displaying affection in a human-like manner.

"The hermit sadly replied, ""I do not know. The officer said there is no sign of eruption at Rakata, so my house is safe from pumice showers."" Nigel wanted to ask why his friend was eager to return to the island, but recalling their disagreement, he stayed silent. Later, while settling accounts, Nigel asked Moses why Van der Kemp was so eager to return. Moses explained that Van der Kemp cherished a photograph of his wife and daughter and would risk anything for it. The hermit's return stopped the conversation. They set sail towards the island, passing Krakatoa's erupting fires. The explosions and darkness created an eerie atmosphere. As they approached the island, they saw the peak of Rakata still standing, surrounded by destruction. The hermit pointed out the wrecked boat, crushed beneath lava.

The entire operation was like working under fire. Nigel and Moses dodged rocks falling around them, creating clouds of dust. Despite the danger, they remained calm. Van der Kemp, seemingly unfazed, moved deliberately. Inside the cave, the sounds outside were muffled, resembling a deep groan. Strange noises from the cave floor added to the eerie atmosphere. The hermit, unperturbed, retrieved papers and a photograph, hinting at the island's safety. Despite the violent eruptions outside, they were shielded by the mountain. The hermit suggested waiting for a lull before leaving. The view outside was obscured by smoke and dust, making it unsafe to venture out. They returned to the cave, where Moses prepared a meal.

In a small opening, likely caused by falling rocks, two onlookers peered down at the chaotic scene below, hindered by thick smoke. Explosions drowned out their voices, forcing them to shout. As the wind shifted, clearing the air, they cautiously stepped onto a ledge for safety. Unaware of the danger of the fluid below, they were startled by a deafening explosion as Perboewatan's summit shattered, sending fragments skyward. Molten lava spewed forth, igniting the island. The sudden heat activated all craters, preventing a catastrophic explosion. A mesmerizing display of fire and smoke unfolded, casting a red glow. A massive eruption shot lava into the sky, plunging the area into darkness. The wind changed, pushing destruction towards them, prompting a swift retreat. In the safety of a cave, they pondered their perilous situation, finding solace in faith amidst the chaos.|['1.

The hermit surprised Nigel by reading a comforting passage from the Bible during their meal. They discussed volcanoes while Moses served supper. The hermit then revealed a locket with a picture of his deceased wife and child, resembling Kathy Holbein. Nigel refrained from revealing his realization to the hermit. Later, they navigated a dangerous sea, escaping the erupting volcano. The eruption was so powerful that its sound traveled across great distances, startling people worldwide. The travelers witnessed Krakatoa collapsing into the sea, engulfed in flames and chaos. The intense experience left them in awe and shock.|"['**1.

The loud sounds heard were not just like distant thunder. In Batavia, 100 miles away, they were so strong on that terrible Sunday night that people couldn't sleep. They were compared to artillery close by, causing doors and windows to rattle. Captain Watson of the _Charles Bal_, only 10 miles from the volcano, also likened the sounds to artillery, but language falls short in describing them. He mentioned a crackling noise, likely from fragments in the air. As the brig _Sunshine_ neared the island, the commotion grew intense, and warm pumice rained down. Lightning lit up the dark clouds like a pine-tree. Despite the danger, Kathleen found the spectacle splendid. Mud rain fell, followed by white-hot lava fragments. Explosions continued till early morning, with the ancient crater emptied by four grand eruptions. The Krakatoa volcano's vents gone, sea rushed in, causing steam and the final explosions.|['1.

The impact of the rushing water was to cool the upper layer of the boiling lava, forming a thick solid crust at the volcano's mouth. The volcano, akin to a sealed boiler, had nowhere for the expanding gases to escape. The situation was like a bottle with its neck corked by tons of solid rock. Under such conditions, either the cork had to give or the bottle would burst. On that fateful night, both occurred. Throughout the night, the corks popped until Krakatoa finally erupted! The explosions, meticulously noted by geologist Mr. R.D.M. Verbeek, happened at 5:30, 6:44, 10:02, and 10:52 in the morning. The third, around 10, caused the most destruction. Each explosion generated massive sea waves, spreading from Krakatoa to surrounding shores. The eruption also led to a cliff collapse and a dramatic rescue at sea.|"[""1.

The _Sunshine_ continued its journey amidst destruction and chaos, traveling over land and water until it abruptly halted. There was a scraping sound against the ship's sides, followed by a gradual stop, causing strain on the rigging. Backstays broke, and the foretopsail burst with a loud noise before both masts were lost. Despite the chaos, the water still rushed beneath, and the wind carried unfamiliar scents. In Anjer, a hotel owner went to check his boats' moorings on the morning of August 27, witnessing a massive wave that swept him to safety but sealed the town's fate. The lighthouse-keeper and his family were carried away by a sudden wave, while a Dutch man-of-war was displaced two miles inland. The Krakatoa eruption of 1883 caused widespread destruction, affecting towns, villages, and hamlets, leading to the loss of over 36,000 lives.

"On that day in Batavia, all the gas lights went out, and the pictures shook on the walls as if there was an earthquake, but there wasn't one. It was the air-wave from Krakatoa, and the noise it caused was described as ""deafening."" The effect of these explosions on the Straits Settlements was remarkable. In Java, people thought a ship was in trouble, in Sumatra they believed a fort was under attack, and in Singapore, they thought it was a distressed vessel. The sound even affected telephones, creating a loud roar. The detonations were heard as far as South Australia, 2250 miles away, and even in Rodriguez, almost 3000 miles distant. Ships near Krakatoa did not feel the shock as much due to the proximity. The air-waves traveled in expanding circles worldwide before returning to Krakatoa.

The global impact of the Krakatoa volcano eruption in 1883 was profound and far-reaching. The eruption triggered massive sea waves that were observed worldwide, coinciding with the eruption dates. These waves were noted in the Java sea and even reached as far as Cape Horn and the English Channel. The unusual sea disturbances were vividly documented, with reports of significant tidal anomalies and dramatic changes in water levels.

The fine dust blown out of Krakatoa was discovered to be made up of extremely thin, transparent plates or irregular specks of pumice. These tiny fragments were formed due to immense steam pressure inside the volcano and the sudden expansion of the material ejected into the atmosphere. Dr. Flugel mentioned that the glassy dust contained numerous air bubbles or tiny needle-like crystals. Some of these particles, resembling microscopic glass balloons, floated in the upper air due to their tenacity. These particles, reflecting the sunlight in various ways, created stunning light and color effects that captivated the world in 1883. As Captain Roy and his son pondered the wonders of nature near Anjer, Java, they marveled at the intricate beauty created by these minuscule glass fragments, demonstrating the awe-inspiring works of nature.|['1.

The onlookers were starting to relax when a massive rock suddenly plummeted from the cliff with a deafening roar. It shocked those in the boat, especially when they noticed the climber, Van der Kemp, standing still on a narrow ledge after the landslide cut off his path. Nigel and Moses rushed to help but found a smooth, impassable gap separating them. Van der Kemp, barely clinging to the cliff, calmly accepted his fate. Nigel tried to reach him but couldn't. Moses, with a daring plan, managed to create a way for Van der Kemp to swing to safety. With a prayer, they clasped hands as the hermit swung to safety, narrowly avoiding a tragic fall.|['1.

Nigel found himself in a perilous situation, hanging off a ledge with Moses, his faithful servant, trying to pull him to safety. With a strong grip on Nigel's hair, Moses struggled to free his master until Nigel could secure his position. After the rescue, they discovered that Moses had injured his leg. Despite the pain, they managed to get Moses to safety. Meanwhile, Winnie, Nigel's love, was relieved but exhausted from the tension. Nigel and Winnie's bond only grew stronger after the ordeal.
