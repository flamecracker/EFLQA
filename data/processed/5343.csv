Miss Cornelia left with an unsolvable question. Susan tucked Rilla into bed, while Anne sat on the veranda under the early stars, dreaming and marveling at the moonrise over Four Winds Harbour. By day, the Blythe children enjoyed playing in the lush maple grove between Ingleside and Glen St. Mary pond. However, for evening fun, they favored the fairy-like valley behind the grove.

The children from the manse were left to wander on their own, as Aunt Martha was in bed and the minister preoccupied with deep thoughts. Despite this, they looked forward to good times ahead. Una found Rainbow Valley more beautiful than the graveyard and adored the Blythe family. Faith felt the day held promise and danced joyfully. The Meredith children, enjoying their holiday, ventured out exploring. In Mr. Taylor's pasture, they discovered an old barn. Climbing a rickety ladder, they found a girl curled up in the hay. She had a pale face, peculiar eyes, and wore ragged clothes. Faith, concerned for her, urged her to come along, as they realized she seemed neglected and alone.|"[""1.

"Mary surrendered. She was so feeble that descending the ladder was a challenge, but they managed to get her down and across the field into the manse kitchen. Aunt Martha, preoccupied with her Saturday cooking, paid no attention to her. Faith and Una hurried to the pantry and searched for any available food—some ""ditto,"" bread, butter, milk, and a questionable pie. Mary Vance devoured the food eagerly and without criticism, while the manse children observed her. Jerry noticed her pretty mouth and nice, even, white teeth. Faith realized with shock that Mary only wore a ragged, faded dress. Una felt pure pity, Carl was amused, and all were curious. ""Now come to the graveyard and share your story,"" Faith commanded when Mary's hunger waned. Mary was eager to speak. Food had revived her liveliness and loosened her somewhat hesitant tongue. ""You won't tell anyone if I confide in you?"" she asked, settling on Mr. Pollock's tombstone. Across from her, the manse children lined up on another. The atmosphere was charged with mystery and excitement. Something significant had occurred. Mary rolled up her ragged sleeves, revealing bruised and chapped arms and hands.

Una was deeply affected by the frightening situation, causing her to hold back her tears. Mary then comforted her, wiping away Una's tears with the lace frill of a spare-room pillow. The two forgave each other, cuddled up, and watched the shadows of the vine leaves on the moonlit wall until they fell asleep. Meanwhile, Rev. John Meredith was upstairs in the study, fully engrossed in preparing his sermon for the next day, unaware of the struggles faced by a lonely soul under his own roof. Mary, wearing Faith's school boots and an old black velvet cap, attended church. Despite her shabby appearance, she behaved conventionally and sang heartily during the service. Mary even mischievously stuck her tongue out at a woman who stared at her, much to Una's dismay. Mary, content with her education, declined Faith's suggestion to attend school and instead dedicated her time to cleaning and organizing the manse, transforming it into a tidy space.

The group deliberated on the fate of Mary, leaning towards sending her back to the asylum due to the lack of suitable caregivers in the area.

After Miss Cornelia left, Nan Blythe left her hammock and joined her friends in Rainbow Valley. Jem and Jerry played with horseshoes, Carl watched ants, and Walter read myths to Mary, Di, Faith, and Una. Walter was shocked to learn that some stories were myths, like William Tell and Gelert. He loved tales of the Pied Piper and the San Greal. Mary shared a real-life tale about the Wandering Jew, and Di empathized with the lame boy in the Pied Piper story. Una reflected on the boy's mother's perspective. The friends enjoyed the stories as the bells on the Tree Lovers rang in the wind, and the evening shadows covered the valley.|"['1.

Walter gazed into the sky, imagining the Pied Piper leading an adventure down Rainbow Valley to the sea. He felt a pull to follow the Piper's music, even though he didn't want to. Mary, feeling uneasy, urged Walter to stop talking about it, fearing being left behind while the boys followed the Piper. Walter, enjoying the dramatic effect he had on his friends, was also haunted by a mysterious dread about the Piper. To change the subject, Mary shared her observations about ants with Carl, finding them interesting in their behaviors.

"A hushed silence fell over the group. Everyone was aware that Mary hadn't intended to say ""goodness."" Faith and Di shared a knowing look that could rival Miss Cornelia's. Walter and Carl appeared uneasy, while Una's lip quivered. ""It just slipped out before I could stop it - really, it did,"" Mary explained, looking apologetic. ""You all seem so sensitive here. The Wileys were much louder when they fought."" Then, a surprising revelation came: Mrs. Wiley, the woman Mary had run away from, had passed away. Mary was taken aback but relieved.

Miss Cornelia concluded that there wasn't much harm done by Mary, despite her slangy language. She decided to keep Mary at their place until they heard from the authorities. Mr. Meredith, a kind man, comforted Mary and showed her unexpected kindness. Mary, who dreaded Mr. Meredith, found solace in his understanding. Mary, feeling reluctant to return to the asylum, was comforted by Una and Nan's suggestion to ask Mrs. Elliott to adopt her. Una, shy and in awe of Mrs. Elliott, found it daunting but considered the idea.|"[""1.

When the authorities of Hopetown requested Mr. Meredith to send Mary to them urgently, Mary wept herself to sleep in the manse attic that night. Una, filled with a newfound courage, sneaked away from the manse to the harbor road the following evening. Although she heard joyful laughter from Rainbow Valley in the distance, her path did not lead there. Pale and determined, Una paid no attention to the people she passed by. Even old Mrs. Stanley Flagg remarked on Una's absentmindedness, comparing her to her father. Miss Cornelia resided midway between the Glen and Four Winds Point, in a house that had transformed from a bright green to a pleasant greenish gray over the years. The children from the manse and Ingleside enjoyed visiting her. The misty sea softly lapped the distant sands, boats glided down the harbor, and a schooner sailed up the channel. Despite the enchanting surroundings, Una arrived at Miss Cornelia's gate feeling almost unable to walk. Una poured her heart out to Miss Cornelia, pleading for her to adopt Mary, who was afraid of returning to the asylum.

Miss Cornelia sighed, acknowledging her duty. She decided to discuss it with Mr. Elliott before revealing anything. Offering another doughnut, she learned that the girl enjoyed them. Confessing her fondness for doughnuts, she shared that Aunt Martha never made them, but Miss Susan did occasionally in Rainbow Valley. When hungry for doughnuts, she read recipes from her mother's old cookbooks. Miss Cornelia expressed concern for the manse children's well-being if Mr. Meredith didn't marry. Reflecting on taking in Mary, she acknowledged the responsibility to guide her. Mary, with mischievous glee, joked about her behavior changing. The manse children gave Mary parting gifts, showing their affection. Mary, torn between a beaded purse and a picture, chose the purse to please Una.|"['1.

Mary expressed concern about her father potentially remarrying, fearing that a stepmother might turn him against his own children. Una, unable to sleep, worried about this possibility, not wanting her family to be torn apart. Despite Mary's good intentions, her words had unintended consequences, causing Una distress. Meanwhile, the Reverend John Meredith, absorbed in reading about St. Augustine, grappled with ancient problems while feeling the absence of his late wife, Cecelia. He never considered remarriage, still deeply mourning Cecelia and believing Faith would eventually fill her mother's role. As he retired for the night, he reflected on Cecelia's sudden departure and the void she left behind.

Faith's friendly wish came true. The next day, Aunt Martha was still unable to get out of bed, and Carl remained sick, agreeing to stay in bed.

Faith and Una decided to clean the house. They moved all the furniture outside, swept, and attempted to dust. Faith broke a window while cleaning. Despite the mishaps, Faith remained cheerful. She enjoyed shaking rugs outside, even on a tombstone. When the Clow family drove by, they disapproved of Faith's actions, which made her feel hurt.

Faith stood bravely in the church, her voice clear and strong. She explained how she and Una accidentally missed Sunday School due to a mix-up with the days of the week caused by Elder Baxter changing the prayer meeting day. She clarified that they cleaned the manse on the wrong day, thinking it was Monday when it was actually Sunday. Faith defended her father, who was unaware of the confusion, and expressed their love for him. After her heartfelt explanation, Faith felt relieved and ran out of the church, comforted by the starlit night. Inside, the congregation was bewildered, but Thomas Douglas took charge of the collection. Despite the awkward atmosphere, the choir sang and the service concluded, with Dr. Cooper giving the benediction. The Reverend Doctor found humor in Faith's honesty, and John Meredith's reputation brought some lightness to the situation.|"[""1.

Mr. Meredith came back home the following day, but before his return, Faith managed to stir up trouble in Glen St. Mary once again. After the intense events of Sunday evening, she was feeling mischievous on Monday. Faith dared Walter Blythe to ride a pig through Main Street while she rode another. The pigs, believed to belong to Bertie Shakespeare Drew's father, had been lingering near the manse for a while. Walter was embarrassed but accepted the challenge. They raced through the village, causing a stir. Despite the minister noticing, he forgot about it by the time he got home. As they passed by, reactions varied from horror to laughter. Anne felt conflicted about spoiling them but understood their need for love and fun. She contemplated talking to Walter about the incident, trying not to laugh.

In Rainbow Valley, a hidden spring lay undisturbed, nestled beneath a crumbling pine tree and a twisted maple. John Meredith, a minister, discovered this secret spot one evening after a pastoral visit. The moon rose as he drank from the spring, feeling a sense of tranquility amidst the beauty of the valley. As he sat on the maple seat, memories of his youth and lost love flooded his mind, transporting him back to a time of roses and dreams. Lost in reverie, he was startled by the sudden appearance of Rosemary West, a woman of striking beauty and grace. Rosemary, known for her sweetness and resilience, exuded a sense of youthfulness and wonder that captivated John Meredith.

John Meredith was surprised by Rosemary's beauty, and Rosemary was surprised by his sudden appearance near the spring. She never expected to encounter anyone, especially the recluse from the Glen St. Mary manse. Startled, she almost dropped her heavy load of books borrowed from the Glen lending library. To hide her embarrassment, she fibbed, claiming she came for a drink when Mr. Meredith greeted her. Feeling foolish, she wished to disappear. However, Mr. Meredith, unaffected by vanity, put her at ease. He boldly offered to fetch her a cup for water. Crafting a cup from birch bark, he filled it from the spring and handed it to Rosemary. She drank it all, though not thirsty, as a self-inflicted punishment for her fib. The shared cup held a special meaning for both, symbolizing a connection that would impact their lives in the future. They walked together along the shadowy path, with the moonlight casting a mystical glow on the fields beyond, forming an unspoken bond against the eerie powers of the night.|"[""1.

Life is full of surprises, always ready to turn a new page when we least expect it. Two individuals, Rosemary and the Glen minister, embarked on a pleasant walk up a hill. Contrary to expectations, the minister was not as reserved as rumored, engaging Rosemary in lively conversations on various topics. The old homestead they visited was a charming gray house surrounded by fragrant vines and a garden adorned with lilies and asters. Overlooking the Glen and the moonlit harbor, the minister expressed his love for windy days, finding calm days uninspiring. Inside, they met Ellen West, Rosemary's older and contrasting sister, who engaged the minister in a discussion on world politics, particularly about the Kaiser of Germany.

Rosemary was accustomed to Ellen's warnings about getting involved with eligible men. But this time, Rosemary felt irritated. She wondered why Ellen was upset. Despite feeling upset and tired of old dreams, Rosemary was determined to keep her promise. Meanwhile, John Meredith, lost in his thoughts about German theology, became oblivious to his surroundings.

"""We will miss Myra terribly at church,"" expressed Miss Cornelia. ""She was a diligent worker, never stumped by any challenge. If she couldn't overcome a difficulty, she found a way around it. And if that failed, she simply ignored it—and often, the problem disappeared. 'I'll keep a stiff upper lip to my journey's end,' she once told me. Well, she has reached the end of her journey.""

Anne interrupted dreamland, pondering, ""Can you imagine her journey truly ending? I see her as embarking on new, radiant adventures beyond death.""

Miss Cornelia shared, ""I've never been fond of the idea of eternal rest. I hope for activity in heaven, perhaps even a heavenly version of pies and doughnuts. Although we may grow weary, even the most fatigued soul would desire rest short of eternity, except maybe a lazy man.""

Susan hesitated, ""You may have to smile occasionally, but laughter in heaven seems irreverent."" 

Miss Cornelia redirected, ""Back to reality, who can replace Myra in Sunday School?"" They discussed potential candidates, ruling out Mrs. Jamieson due to her unpredictable nature.

"""Varmints, indeed!"" exclaimed Susan angrily. ""Does Mrs. Alec Davis forget that her uncle on her mother's side was suspected of poisoning his wife? Not that it was ever proven, Mrs. Dr. dear, and it's not wise to believe everything you hear. But if I had an uncle whose wife died under suspicious circumstances, I wouldn't go around calling innocent children varmints.""

""The issue is,"" added Miss Cornelia, ""that Mrs. Davis made a significant donation, and now there's a problem with covering the shortfall. If she turns the other Douglases against Mr. Meredith, as she's likely to do, he may have to leave.""

""But the Douglases stick together. If you offend one, you offend all. We can't do without them. They contribute half the salary. They may have faults, but they're not stingy. Norman Douglas used to donate a hundred a year before he departed.""

""He accused a church member of cheating him in a cow transaction. He hasn't attended service in two decades. His wife used to come regularly when she was alive, poor soul, but he never allowed her to contribute, except for one penny every Sunday. She felt deeply embarrassed. I'm not sure he was a good husband to her, although she never voiced any complaints. But she always seemed subdued.

With determination, Faith wasted no time in putting her plan into action. The following day after school, she left the manse and headed down the Glen. Walter Blythe caught up with her near the post office, curious about her purpose. Faith, with an air of importance, mentioned she was on church business, leaving Walter feeling a bit ignored. As they strolled in silence, the warm evening breeze carried the scent of resin through the air. The gray seas beyond the sand dunes shimmered softly. The Glen brook flowed with golden and crimson leaves, resembling fairy boats. In a nearby buckwheat field, crows gathered for a meeting. Faith, disliking crows for their cunning ways, disrupted their assembly by throwing a broken rail at them. The startled crows flew off, cawing loudly. Walter, still recovering from a toothache, shared his night of discomfort with Faith, who in turn recounted the humorous remedies attempted by their family.|"[""1.

Walter expressed his fear of blood and seeing others hurt, while Faith believed in facing the pain and helping others. The conversation turned to the ugliness of injuries and the desire for a world without pain. Faith reminded Walter of the joys of being alive despite the challenges. As they walked, Faith felt a sense of frustration over an insult from Dan Reese, wishing Jem Blythe had been there to defend her.

Walter's complexion changed from pale to flushed with shame and anger. He felt he should have stood up for Faith against Dan's insults. Jem and Ritchie would have confronted Dan with force, but Walter couldn't bring himself to resort to name-calling or fighting. He was ashamed for not defending Faith. Meanwhile, Faith, feeling nervous after Dan's words, mustered the courage to visit Norman Douglas to ask him to return to the church. Despite her fears, she pressed on. As she approached Norman's house, she saw him on the veranda, looking irritated after a quarrel with his housekeeper.

"Ellen pondered these thoughts as she strolled home, savoring them with a hint of nostalgia. The moonlit night glistened with frost, and the snow crunched beneath her steps. Below, the Glen stretched out with the white harbor in the distance. A light shone from the manse study, indicating John Meredith had left. Had he proposed to Rosemary? How had she declined? Ellen knew she would never find out, as Rosemary wouldn't share and she wouldn't dare to ask. She had to accept the rejection. ""I hope he'll return and be friendly,"" she mused. Ellen disliked being alone and often spoke to herself to avoid solitude. She longed for intellectual conversations with men like John Meredith or Norman Douglas.

Ellen paced the room, her emotions in turmoil. She confronted Rosemary, who expressed her fear of loneliness if Ellen left. Ellen retorted, accusing Rosemary of seeking marriage for social status. Rosemary insisted on the promise made by Ellen. With a stern tone, Ellen dismissed Rosemary, urging her to rest and be sensible the next day.

Rosemary's refusal to John Meredith left him hurt and mortified, realizing he loved her deeply. He struggled to accept her rejection, feeling the loss keenly. Rosemary, on the other hand, maintained her composure despite Ellen's apprehensions. She secluded herself to write a formal note declining John's advances. The stormy weather provided a convenient excuse to skip church, sparing Rosemary from facing John in person. As John read her cold rejection, he grappled with the realization that Rosemary meant more to him than he had acknowledged.

The light rain that had fallen all day had stopped in the evening, leaving behind a beautiful spring scene.

Mary Vance, with a serious expression, scolded the group for their behavior, telling them they needed to improve their conduct as people were talking about them. Faith, surprised, asked what they had done wrong, while Una felt anxious, and Jerry tried to appear indifferent.

Jerry openly admitted that he wasn't sincerely praying when the accident happened. He didn't expect to win the prize and was just having fun. Faith fondly remembered the beautiful reflections of the trees and hills in the bubbles they blew. Mary reminded them of the sensitivity around playing in the graveyard, especially because the Methodists are particular about it. She stressed that the issue lies in the activities done there. There were concerns that Elder Warren would talk to their father about it, as Deacon Hazard is his cousin. The conversation turned to the need for someone to guide and discipline the children, with hopes that Rosemary West might take on that role. Martha's behavior was criticized, with Jerry advising the kids to ensure they get their fair share of breakfast eggs.|"['1.

Mary fell silent, giving the graveyard a moment of quiet. The children at the manse were deep in thought, pondering the new ideas she had shared. Jerry and Carl were surprised but brushed it off as untrue. Faith was content, but Una was visibly upset, wanting to cry. Mary, with newfound theological knowledge, mentioned wanting three crowns, varying in size. As Mary left before dark, she advised the children to behave for their father's sake.

Jem Blythe joined the girls in Rainbow Valley, having found arbutus flowers for his mother. The children were quiet as Jem was busy with schoolwork for Queen’s Academy. Faith shared their mischiefs with Jem, feeling they lacked proper guidance. Jem suggested forming a Good-Conduct Club to help them think before acting.

Faith and Una sat on the Pollock tombstone, unable to visit Rainbow Valley due to the cold spring storm. The rain had stopped, but the biting east wind chilled them. Lida Marsh, a young girl from the fishing village, arrived barefoot, bringing herring to the manse. She looked cold and shivered, her feet purple from the journey.

Lida quickly accepted the gift of stockings and shoes, eager to wear them before anyone could take them back. She swiftly put them on and headed off, knowing she had to leave before being caught. She took them off soon after, placing them carefully in her basket to keep them nice for special occasions. Lida felt no guilt about taking them, believing the manse people to be incredibly wealthy with plenty of shoes and stockings. She then went to play with the boys at the Glen village until Mrs. Elliott sent her home.

Faith was adamant about not wearing the striped stockings to church, despite Una's insistence. Una suggested that Faith wear them just for once, as nobody would notice them in church, especially with Faith's long brown dress covering them. Una reminded Faith of their father's words about always being truthful, even when faced with challenges.

Mary Vance decided not to walk home through the Bailey garden after encountering Henry's ghost. She cooked trout with Jerry instead. The ghost story didn't scare Jerry, but Faith, Una, and Carl were secretly frightened. Even though they didn't believe in ghosts, the story haunted them. After a feast in Rainbow Valley, they had to walk back to the manse alone, avoiding the haunted garden. The ghost tale was different because it was so close to home. The children felt spooked, especially when they were alone. One evening, feeling lonely, they sat under the Tree Lovers. Faith declined an invitation to visit the Fords, feeling jealous of Persis Ford's beauty and glamour. Despite being a little jealous, they read and explored until twilight, feeling uneasy about the nearby old Bailey garden.|"['1.

Great, soft, purple clouds gathered in the sky, casting a mysterious stillness over Rainbow Valley. The marsh twinkled with countless fireflies, as if preparing for a fairy gathering. But the atmosphere turned eerie as the three Meredith siblings noticed a shapeless white figure near the old Bailey garden. Faith's blood ran cold, and even Carl and Una felt a shiver down their spines. Fear took hold as they mistook the figure for the ghost of Henry Warren. Panic set in, and they raced back to the manse, leaving Aunt Martha behind. Finding the house empty, they fled to Ingleside in terror. Rosemary West, sensing their genuine fear, calmed them down and led them to safety on the veranda, where Susan, practical and reassuring, awaited their arrival.|"['1.

"""It was bigger than a million owls,"" cried Carl, feeling embarrassed about his tears. ""And it _grovelled_ just like Mary said, and it was crawling down over the dyke towards us. Do owls really _crawl_?""

""I will go and check,"" Susan said calmly. ""Now, children, calm down. Whatever you saw, it wasn't a ghost. As for Henry Warren, he would be happy to rest in peace. No chance of him coming back. If you can calm them down, Miss West, I will investigate.""

Susan bravely went to Rainbow Valley with a pitchfork she found in the hay-field. She found nothing there except Mrs. Stimson's sheets. Mrs. Stimson was looking for a needle and scared the children unintentionally. The Merediths felt ashamed and Jerry scolded them for being cowards.

Faith and Una encountered a strange, white figure in the graveyard, just as Mary Vance had described. Jerry believed Carl was at fault for running away first and not protecting the girls. As punishment, they were to stay in the graveyard until midnight, with the girls enduring a week without jam. Despite the eerie surroundings, Una promised to stay awake to keep Carl in her thoughts. Alone in the dark, Carl felt the weight of his punishment. The night was filled with chilling winds and eerie shadows, adding to the spooky atmosphere of the graveyard.

Carl huddled on the tombstone, fearing bony hands might grab his ankles from Mr. Pollock's grave. Alone in the night, he battled his fears. The clock struck eleven, and rain added to his misery. Determined to stay till midnight, he endured the discomfort. Finally, at twelve, he left, soaked and shivering. The next morning, his crimson face alarmed Jerry, who fetched Mr. Meredith.

Mr. Meredith hurried to the phone. Dr. Blythe arrived at the manse in just ten minutes. Shortly after, a wire was sent to town for a nurse. The Glen learned that Carl Meredith was very sick with pneumonia. Gilbert was visibly concerned. Carl's condition worsened to double pneumonia. One night, Mr. Meredith, Faith, and Una were distraught. Jerry, feeling guilty, refused to leave Carl's door. Dr. Blythe and the nurse fought tirelessly, and at dawn, Carl turned a corner. The Glen showed their love by sending nourishing food. Carl's recovery was swift. Norman Douglas brought fresh eggs and cream daily. A celebration was held in Rainbow Valley, with fireworks and a feast in Carl's honor. Rosemary avoided Norman, but he pursued her for a talk.

Rosemary sat thoughtfully on the bench where John Meredith had sat a year ago. The small spring sparkled under ferns, with sunset rays shining through the trees. A cluster of asters bloomed beside her, creating a magical atmosphere. Norman Douglas arrived, disrupting the tranquility with his presence. He demanded a chat, taking John's old spot, causing Rosemary to fight back laughter at the absurdity. Norman, with his red beard, tried to be friendly, explaining Ellen's wish to marry him. He asked Rosemary to return a promise Ellen made to her. Norman urged her to agree, emphasizing the importance of their union.|"['1.

Rosemary walked slowly up the hill, pondering the impending situation. She knew living with Norman Douglas was not an option she would ever consider. Despite his enthusiasm for the upcoming wedding and the prospect of Rosemary coming to live with them, she remained composed and civil. Ellen, on the other hand, felt a mix of anxiety and anticipation as she met Rosemary in the garden. The tension was palpable as they exchanged words, with St. George, the cat, nonchalantly observing the scene. Ellen's fear of Rosemary's response to Norman's proposal weighed heavily on her mind. She was torn between the possibility of Rosemary accepting or rejecting the offer, both outcomes carrying their own burdens. The sisters stood at a crossroads, their unspoken emotions bubbling beneath the surface as they navigated the delicate situation ahead.|"[""1.

Rosemary was upset with Ellen's decision to stay with her instead of marrying Norman. She felt it was absurd for Ellen to live alone. Ellen insisted she could manage Norman and didn't want to leave Rosemary alone. She expressed her frustration about men causing trouble. Faith and Una sensed trouble when Mary Vance started talking.

After a quiet supper, Carl and Mr. Meredith headed to the study. A switch lay on the table, ready for discipline. Carl had made a mistake, thinking an eel was dead.

After Una wept and dried her eyes, she made her way to the spare room. The room was dim and musty as the blinds remained shut and the window closed for a long time. Aunt Martha wasn't keen on fresh air. However, since no one ever closed a door in the manse, it wasn't a big issue except when a minister stayed overnight and had to endure the stale air of the spare room. In a corner of the closet, Una found her mother's gray silk wedding dress. She knelt down, burying her face in the soft fabric, feeling a connection to her mother. Una whispered to the dress, promising to always remember and love her mother, even as she faced challenges, like trying to accept her stepmother as Mary Vance had warned. The following day, Una, despite her shabby clothes, took great care to look neat. She walked to the house on the hill, where Rosemary West sat in the garden looking troubled. Life in the house had been strained, with unsaid tensions between Ellen and Rosemary, and Norman Douglas's unpredictable visits.

Una reassured Miss West that they never misbehaved on purpose and promised that if she married their father, they would all strive to be good and follow her guidance. Una shared a touching moment when she comforted her father, who struggled to discipline Carl. Una whispered a secret to Miss West, revealing John Meredith's continued affection.
