Kiki, a young man who turned into a hawk, soared above the saucer-shaped mountain. From up high, he spotted a distant land beyond the Deadly Desert and set off on a long flight. Crossing the Deadly Desert required flying high to avoid its poisonous fumes, which made Kiki feel ill. After reaching Hiland, he rested and then flew to Merryland and Noland. Tired, he settled in Noland for the night, where he transformed back into Kiki Aru. The next day, he journeyed through the lands ruled by King Bud and Queen Zixi, finding them more pleasant than his homeland. In a city, he saw gold and, tempted, transformed into a magpie to steal a piece. A sparrow witnessed the theft and warned Kiki about the consequences of his actions.|['1.

The Nome, who was once a king, lost his kingdom to the people of Oz. He sought revenge and wanted to conquer Oz.

However, Kiki was not interested in revenge and refused the Nome's offer. The Nome, realizing he couldn't find the magic tool for transformations, doubted Kiki's abilities.

Kiki the Hyup and Ruggedo the Nome were both deep in thought. Ruggedo had a devious plan to conquer Oz, but he knew they had to be cautious. He explained to Kiki that Glinda the Good and Ozma had powerful magical tools to keep track of people's actions in Oz. However, Ruggedo had a cunning idea - they could transform themselves into birds to avoid being detected by Glinda's magic. As birds, they could move freely without being noticed. Ruggedo proposed a scheme where they would rally the savage beasts of Oz to join their cause in exchange for transforming them into humans. Meanwhile, they would turn the people of Oz into beasts and banish them to the forests. It seemed like a foolproof plan to take over the land of Oz without being discovered.|"[""1.

Meanwhile, in the Emerald City, ruled by the beloved Ozma, the people lived happily, unaware of the impending threat.

One day, Dorothy visited her friend Trot in the palace. Trot's companion, Cap'n Bill, an old sailor with a wooden leg and a meat leg, sat by the window smoking a pipe.

In the western part of the Gillikin Country lies the vast Gugu Forest, the largest forest in all of Oz. Stretching for miles in every direction, it is home to a variety of wild beasts. The forest is adjacent to rugged mountains covered with underbrush and twisted trees. The beasts that inhabit Gugu Forest have their own laws to maintain peace and order. At the heart of the forest is King Gugu, a massive yellow leopard, along with his advisors: Bru the Bear, Loo the Unicorn, and Rango the Gray Ape. These beasts are fierce and intelligent, ensuring that harmony is preserved in the forest. While fights among the beasts do occur, they are punished by the King and his Counselors.

Kiki flew to a distant tree away from Ruggedo and cast a magical spell, transforming himself, Ruggedo, and the Nome into creatures with lion heads, monkey bodies, eagle wings, and wild ass tails with golden knobs. Ruggedo climbed down the tree due to the dense branches. Trouble brewed in the Forest of Gugu as Chipo the Wild Boar bit off Arx the Giraffe's tail, leading to chaos. The beasts remained dignified as two Li-Mon-Eags warned of an impending war from the people of Oz. Gugu the King dismissed their claims, stating there was no need for conflict. The Nome proposed a plan for the beasts to rise against the people of Oz, claiming they deserved the luxuries the humans had.|"[""1.

One evening, Trot and Cap'n Bill heard unsettling noises in the forest, but Cap'n Bill assured Trot of their safety. As they navigated the river, they encountered a small island with a glittering object in the center. Cap'n Bill, deep in thought, fashioned tools from tree limbs.

Cap'n Bill couldn't harm the Kalidah since nothing in Oz can be killed. He watched the beast struggle but couldn't escape. Trot dried her shoes as the Kalidah warned them about its people's swimming skills. They aimed to take the Magic Flower to the Emerald City. The sailor made a raft using a pole and paddle to cross the river. The Magic Flower's beauty amazed them, but the island was barren except for the flower.

In the Land of Oz, the Kalidahs were magical but disagreeable creatures with a mix of good and evil. One Kalidah, not vengeful, saw its foes in danger and let go of its anger. Cap'n Bill, thinking of a plan, lit his pipe and puffed out smoke. Trot urged the Glass Cat to seek help from the Wizard. The Glass Cat went on a mission to the Emerald City. Meanwhile, Trot worried about their situation, with no food or rest. The next day, all animals gathered in the Forest of Gugu. King Gugu, with his Counselors, faced Ruggedo the Nome and Kiki Aru the Hyup. The beasts, from small to large, assembled in rows.

In the Forest of Gugu, a strange creature named Ruggedo the Nome appeared, with a lion's face, eagle's wings, and a golden ball at the end of his tail. The beasts were astonished by his presence. Ruggedo claimed to be a magician from the sky, warning them that the people of Oz planned to enslave them. He proposed a plan to transform the animals into people and the people into animals to seek revenge. Amidst the uproar of the animals discussing this proposal, Kiki, a boy, observed from below. The beasts debated fiercely, their voices blending in a cacophony of disagreement and confusion. Ruggedo urged them to consider their response carefully before making a decision. The forest was filled with the sounds of growls, yelps, and trumpets as the animals deliberated.|"[""**Question 1:**\nWhat physical features does Ruggedo the Nome possess?\nA) Rabbit's face, bat's wings, and a silver ball at the end of his tail\nB) Lion's face, eagle's wings, and a golden ball at the end of his tail\nC) Snake's face, owl's wings, and a diamond ball at the end of his tail\nD) Bear's face, hawk's wings, and a bronze ball at the end of his tail\nE) Tiger's face, falcon's wings, and a crystal ball at the end of his tail"", '**Question 2:**\nWhat did Ruggedo claim to be?\nA) A farmer from the neighboring village\nB) A warrior from a distant land\nC) A magician from the sky\nD) A prince from the underwater kingdom\nE) A wizard from the enchanted forest', ""**Question 3:**\nHow did the animals react to Ruggedo's presence?\nA) They welcomed him with open arms\nB) They were frightened and ran away\nC) They were astonished by his appearance\nD) They immediately agreed to his proposal\nE) They attacked him to protect the forest"", ""**Question 4:**\nWho observed the beasts' discussion from below?\nA) Toto, the dog\nB) Kiki, a boy\nC) Luna, the cat\nD) Zuzu, the bird\nE) Coco, the monkey"", '**Question 5:**\nWhat did Ruggedo propose to the animals?\nA) To build a fortress in the forest\nB) To start a war against the people of Oz\nC) To transform the animals into people and vice versa\nD) To form an alliance with the birds of the sky\nE) To create a magical barrier around the forest']"|"[""B) Lion's face, eagle's wings, and a golden ball at the end of his tail**"", 'C) A magician from the sky**', 'C) They were astonished by his appearance**', 'B) Kiki, a boy**', 'C) To transform the animals into people and vice versa**']"
Ruggedo, the Nome, gestured and flapped his wings in an attempt to regain the attention of the beasts, but they were focused on various desires. Some were eager to battle the people of Oz, some wished for transformation, and others were indifferent. Suddenly, a majestic Lion entered the circle, carrying a fearless little girl on its back. Following them was a monstrous Tiger with a peculiar little man holding a black bag. The Lion reassured the beasts, stating that they were there as guests of King Gugu and not to rule over them. The new arrivals included the Wizard of Oz and the Hungry Tiger, who explained his unusual hunger for babies due to his tender conscience. Ruggedo the Nome, disguised as a beast, recognized these strangers as formidable foes and plotted to thwart their plans. The beasts were both curious and wary, listening intently to the unfolding events. Meanwhile, Kiki Aru, hidden in the shadows, realized the urgency of their situation and feared that the Wizard's magical abilities could foil their conquest of Oz. As the Wizard's form shifted to that of a fox, Kiki seized the black bag, causing the Fox to cry out in distress.|"[""1.

The Cowardly Lion's eyes blazed with fury as he looked around for the magician responsible for his transformation. Kiki, hiding his face, whispered the magic word again, turning the lion into a small Munchkin boy. Enraged but helpless, the boy watched as Kiki then changed Ruggedo into a goose. The Hungry Tiger, observing everything, pounced on Kiki when he revealed himself by speaking. As the tiger crushed Kiki, he transformed into a rabbit to escape, flying into a tree. A panic ensued among the animals, fleeing from the magician. The transformed creatures stayed in confusion, annoyed by their new forms. Kiki, curious, examined the Wizard's tools but found them puzzling. The Wizard, now a fox, lamented the loss of his Black Bag containing the tools. Ruggedo, seeing an opportunity, plotted to use Kiki's transformations to his advantage. Ultimately, Ruggedo decided to join forces with Kiki to achieve his conquest plans.|"['1.

Gugu the King, in the form of the fat Woman, suspected the Goose of tricking them into war with the Oz people. The Wizard Fox agreed and planned to have Glinda restore Gugu to his true form. The Glass Cat, despite its aloof nature, felt guilty for leading Trot and Cap'n Bill into trouble. It hurried to the Emerald City to seek help. Knowing the Forest of Gugu well, the Glass Cat decided to find the Wizard to rescue their friends. On its journey, it met a terrified Wolf who shared news of a Magician's dreadful transformations. At a clearing, the Glass Cat encountered a group searching for the lost Black Bag of Magic Tools.

The Glass Cat suggested that the Bag was taken by the Magician out of fear of their magic. The Wizard warned of the danger the Magician posed, hinting at possible transformations. To find the Goose, they split up to search. The Goose was actually Ruggedo, the former Nome King, transformed and filled with anger. Ruggedo feared being destroyed by an egg and other creatures due to his new form. He was also mad at Kiki for spoiling his plans with the Magic Word. Meanwhile, Kiki was puzzled about his next move. Ruggedo, disguised as a Goose, found Kiki and pretended to be kind while planning to trick him later. As they moved through the forest, they encountered a group of chattering monkeys watched by the sly Fox, who was actually the Wizard of Oz in disguise.|"['1.

A clever Fox silently moved through the forest, eavesdropping on the Wizard's enemies. As they plotted, the Wizard debated whether to risk revealing himself or to hide. Spotting a hollow tree, he decided to conceal himself inside. From his hiding spot, he overheard the Nome and Kiki planning to transform monkeys into a giant army to conquer Oz. Kiki revealed his magic word, Pyrzqxgl, and transformed monkeys into towering giants. The Wizard seized an opportunity to use the magic word himself, turning Kiki into a hickory-nut. In a swift move, the Fox emerged from hiding, surprising the Nome. With caution, the Wizard decided not to underestimate the mysterious creature.|['1.

"""I want this creature to become a walnut--Pyrzqxgl!"" he said aloud. But he did not pronounce the Magic Word in quite the right way, and Ruggedo's form did not change. But the Nome knew at once that ""Pyrzqxgl!"" was the Magic Word, so he rushed at the Fox and cried. However, the Nome did not pronounce the word aright, either, having never heard it spoken but once before, and then with a wrong accent. So the Fox was not transformed, but it had to run away to escape being caught by the angry Nome. Ruggedo now began pronouncing the Magic Word in every way he could think of, hoping to hit the right one, and the Fox, hiding in a bush, was somewhat troubled by the fear that he might succeed. Dorothy the Lamb uttered a bleat of delight when she saw her old friend restored to his natural shape. The others were all there, not having found the Goose. The fat Gillikin woman, the Munchkin boy, the Rabbit, and the Glass Cat crowded around the Wizard and asked what had happened. Before he explained anything of his adventure, he transformed them all--except, of course, the Glass Cat--into their natural shapes, and when their joy permitted them to quiet somewhat, he told how he had by chance surprised the Magician's secret and been able to change the two Li-Mon-Eags into shapes that could not speak,"|"['1.

"""No,"" said the Wizard, cleaning the Magic Saw and stowing it in the bag. ""This saw is unique worldwide; if there were more, it wouldn't be as special."" Trot and Dorothy rode the Hungry Tiger, carrying a cage of monkeys. The Wizard and the sailor walked, making the journey slow. The Glass Cat mischievously pulled the monkeys' tails, making them scream. The party camped by a brook, where the Wizard magically set up three tents. They ate a hot supper and talked under the stars before sleeping. The Glass Cat kept pulling tails, annoying the monkeys. The Hungry Tiger tried to stop it, bending the cage bars. The monkeys escaped and covered the Glass Cat in blue mud by the stream. By morning, the Cat was a dull blue, and the Wizard decided to leave the mud on as a lesson."|['1.

The Glass Cat couldn't see or hear, so the Wizard cleaned her eyes and ears. He warned her of further punishment. The Cat was upset, especially at the thought of being laughed at by Ozma and the others. Feeling humiliated, she walked meekly for a while but then dashed away to a nearby lake. She didn't rejoin the group and later appeared clean and transparent at the Royal Palace. Meanwhile, at the Palace, Professor Wogglebug appealed to Ozma about students who refused to eat his Square-Meal Tablets. These tablets were meant to provide complete meals in a small form, but the students preferred real food. The Senior Class even threw the Professor into the river. Despite this, the adventurers managed to successfully complete their mission without anyone noticing.|"['1.

Ozma expressed her gratitude and decided to place the Magic Flower in her boudoir to enjoy its beauty. She then found a stunning gown made by Glinda and her maidens from pure emerald strands. Ozma, who adored pretty clothes, was ecstatic to receive this exquisite gown. Eager to try it on, she had to first go through all the other lovely gifts. By the time she finished, the night was late, and she had thanked everyone for their thoughtful presents. The group discussed the risks of freeing enchantments on mixed animals and the potential dangers they might pose. Despite the concerns, Ozma proposed using the Fountain of the Water of Oblivion to erase their memories of magic. The Wizard expressed worries about the magicians' powers but decided to proceed. Ozma summoned the Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger for protection as the Wizard began the transformation process. The Hyup boy, Kiki Aru, appeared, drank from the fountain, and lost all memory of his past. Dorothy found him charming and welcomed him to sit with them. The Wizard noted Kiki Aru's Munchkin attire, hinting at his forgotten origins.|"['1.
