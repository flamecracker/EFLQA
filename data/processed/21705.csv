It was a dark night when I planned to destroy an enemy's fort. As I lit the match slowly, footsteps approached. Suddenly, Jacob Lancey, a tall man, stumbled into the fortress, causing an explosion. Despite my horror, I rescued him, but his finger was blown off. Guilt consumed me, but Lancey, surprisingly, comforted me, saying it was just a little finger. He even joked about using it as a tobacco stopper. This incident made me cautious with my experiments. Later, I pursued medicine after my father's death, although I inherited an estate. When asked about my future plans, I decided to focus on chemistry and test a new compound that day.|"[""1.

The ship bringing Nicholas from St. Petersburg arrived late last night. A telegram just informed me that he will be here by the first train this morning. Love is said to have wings, and if Nicholas' pair is as strong as he is, they will swiftly carry him to Fagend. My sister Bella was engaged to Nicholas, a Russian who came to England for education. Nicholas, a fine-looking and gentle man, fell in love with Bella during his college years. He was now returning from St. Petersburg to visit us, though his father thought him too young to marry. I explained to my family about dynamite, a compound made of nitro-glycerine and kieselguhr, used in mining. Dynamite is safe unless a detonator is added, causing a violent explosion. Detonation occurs when all molecules of an explosive compound convert into gas simultaneously. Fulminate of mercury is a powerful detonator, capable of shattering effects.|"[""1.

"""A person,"" I explained, ""can symbolize this concept figuratively. Imagine a teacher as a dynamite cartridge, with their heart as the detonator. The classroom and students act like a battery, and their brain is the conducting wire. When the teacher enters the room, chaos erupts. Books are torn, ink spills, and the atmosphere is filled with unrest. Initially calm, the teacher transforms into a detonator ready to explode. Without the heart as the detonator, the teacher would only feel anger but not explode.""

""My mother,"" I added, ""may not always fully grasp complex ideas, but her interest and efforts to understand are admirable. Occasionally, she surprises me with her clear intelligence and incisive reasoning.""

""I plan to buy a yacht after completing my navy torpedo invention. I hope it will be accepted by the Admiralty. Once done, I will take a break from studying and go on a cruise,"" I elaborated.

""My mother's aversion to explosions contrasts with my passion for chemistry and mechanics. She recalls my childhood experiments fondly, despite the mishaps,"" I reminisced.

"After breakfast, we headed to a part of the grounds I wanted to cultivate. The area was cluttered with old trees, roots, and boulders. ""Come with us, Lancey,"" I told the groom, also my lab assistant, found in the stable-yard. ""I'm testing an explosive. I want you to see."" As we approached, I introduced my mother and sister to Mr. Jones, the manager. He demonstrated the power of dynamite compared to gunpowder. By using a small amount of dynamite with a detonator cap, he shattered a boulder. Mr. Jones explained that dynamite was cost-effective and labor-saving. Moving to a large beech-tree, he used dynamite to uproot it efficiently. The tree was blasted, leaving only the largest roots intact. Dynamite proved to be a powerful tool for land clearing."|['1.

A request was made to the soil to house another charge under loose roots, easily shattered for removal. Trees, roots, and boulders were swiftly uprooted and shattered at a low cost. The manager assured the safety of the process, explaining the dynamics of nitro-glycerine and dynamite. Dynamite, when mixed with infusorial earth, becomes a safer explosive. Gunpowder, on the other hand, is more volatile. A change of topic was suggested as two important letters were received, inviting the family to witness experiments in Portsmouth and offering a yacht for sale. The discussion on torpedoes ensued, enlightening the family on the destructive nature of these underwater explosives. Plans for a Mediterranean cruise were proposed, contingent upon the family's participation.|"[""1.

The captain gave quick orders that were immediately followed. The sound of the gong startled the crew out of their hammocks like a jolt of electricity. Each man leaped up the hatchway as fast as a Jack-in-the-box pops out. The crew was on high alert due to an exaggerated fear of torpedoes. They swiftly manned their stations as the ship surged forward, releasing the chain as a torpedo-boat zoomed past, narrowly missing them. The crew cheered as their shots seemed to hit the boat, causing it to sink. The skipper recounted their successful revenge on the Confederate ironclad ram _Albemarle_ in a daring mission. They navigated cautiously through enemy lines, evading detection until they were spotted by the ram itself. Ignoring warnings, they charged at the ram, facing intense fire. The _Albemarle_ was anchored with a log defense, but a lucky fire on shore revealed their position in the dark, stormy night.|"[""1.

After a daring mission, Lieutenant Cushing and his crew bravely attacked the ironclad ship Albemarle during the Civil War. Despite facing heavy fire, they successfully launched a torpedo that sank the mighty ship. The Albemarle was no match for the swift and strategic maneuver of the torpedo boat. Lieutenant Cushing's quick thinking and bold actions led to a victorious outcome, proving the effectiveness of torpedo boats in naval warfare. Lancey and the skipper reflected on the battle, realizing the potential of torpedo boats over ironclads.

We arrived near the lovely town of Nice, but my mother suddenly couldn't bear the sea. Despite feeling unwell, she insisted on going ashore. I decided to continue eastward with Naranovitsch, leaving my mother and sister in Nice. Naranovitsch received news of his father's death, requiring him to return to Russia immediately. My mother and sister would go back to England through France. I chose to cruise the Black Sea and explore the Danube, despite rumors of war. River navigation fascinated me, and I studied the Turkish language while at Yenilik village. I taught my man Lancey, improving my own language skills. Lancey struggled with pronunciation, but our language sessions helped me solidify my Turkish knowledge.|"['1.

The village I mentioned is in Bulgaria, on the southern shore of the Danube. It was beautiful, with the sunny weather making the water, rocks, and trees even more charming. The sound of birds, laughter, and songs filled the air as people worked or played. In the afternoon, I went to the main store with Lancey. Dobri Petroff, a young man, ran the store. He seemed uneducated but had a friendly demeanor. A rude Turk arrived, demanding attention. Petroff was pushed aside, showing the Turk's superiority. Despite the mistreatment, Petroff remained dignified. As we discussed Bulgarian hardships, we encountered a group of villagers celebrating. They were engrossed in wrestling matches. A small man surprised everyone by defeating a larger opponent. Eventually, a newcomer, a Bulgarian giant, emerged victorious. Encouraged by gypsy girls, a young woman persuaded Petroff to challenge the giant. With pride, Petroff entered the ring, displaying both strength and intelligence.|['1.

The wrestlers shook hands and circled each other, eager for an opportunity to make a move. The Bulgarian attempted a throw, but the blacksmith dodged with the agility of a panther. Spectators grew tense, expecting a fierce battle. Surprisingly, the blacksmith swiftly grabbed the Bulgarian and threw him to the ground, stunning the crowd. Despite the victory, the blacksmith showed sportsmanship by helping up his opponent. A young girl handed him his jacket, resembling a woman who had brought the blacksmith to the ring. The blacksmith kissed the girl's hand before leaving with her and the woman. Petroff revealed that a man from Cornwall had taught him to wrestle and introduced him to new ideas through the Bible. The blacksmith pondered the impact of thinking critically in a world of oppression, sparking a deep conversation about faith and wisdom.|['1.

Petroff agreed graciously with my observation and gestured to a humble cottage nearby. The cottage, a simple dwelling with a forge at one end and living quarters at the other, showcased Marika's touch with its cleanliness and order. Despite their poverty, the family found comfort in their home. A cherished possession in the house was a Bible gifted by a colporteur. In a corner, a young boy lay on a warm couch, catching my attention with his features. This encounter led to a warm friendship with the family. Over the following days, I spent time getting to know the villagers, discovering that Petroff was a unique individual among them. He stood out for his intellect, strength, and noble aspirations. My stay extended as I delved deeper into the community, revealing a mix of ordinary and unremarkable individuals. Lancey and I then decided to visit a local coffee house, where we encountered Bulgarians engrossed by a colporteur's presentation of New Testaments and Bibles in the modern Bulgarian language. The villagers, intrigued by the books and the colporteur's explanations, engaged in a meaningful discussion about the Scriptures.|"[""1.

In the Greek Church, priests are often less educated than schoolmasters. The colporteur, reading from a book, caused concern among the villagers as the words seemed to criticize their sacred pictures. A schoolmaster, well-versed in Slavic, compared the colporteur's Bible to the one in their church, finding them identical. This discovery sparked curiosity and discussions among the villagers. The colporteur's work in Turkey, distributing Bibles, was quietly undermining misconceptions. As the author journeyed along the Danube, war broke out, contrasting the peaceful scenes with the impending tragedy. The blend of comedy and tragedy in life was noted, with the announcement of war news evoking a mix of anxiety and acceptance.|"[""1. What caused concern among the villagers in the Greek Church?\nA.

I knew war was a possibility, but I couldn't believe it. I thought diplomacy could solve things without bloodshed. It seemed absurd that Russia would choose war over peace. The idea of a major conflict in our modern, interconnected world felt unlikely to me. My skipper and I debated this topic. He mentioned past wars like the Crimean and the American Civil War. He doubted the value of civilization and progress. I argued that civilization has improved our lives. I believed that Christianity teaches us to sacrifice for others, a higher ideal than mere comfort. Despite our differing views, we agreed to leave the Danube quickly once war was declared. The Emperor of Russia was preparing for war with Turkey, and the scene was lively and tense. The people were excited, and the troops were ready for battle. The day was splendid, but the future was uncertain.|"['1. What did the speaker believe could solve the possibility of war?\nA) Religion\nB) Diplomacy\nC) Progress\nD) Comfort\nE) Sacrifice', ""2.

One notable regiment that marched to Ungheni that day was a Russian unit with a distinguished commander, Lieutenant Nicholas Naranovitsch, who stood out among the burly, square-set soldiers. They wore blue caps with red bands, blue tunics, and loose trousers, carrying knapsacks and kettles. The troops moved at a steady pace, showcasing discipline and strength. The review took place on a sunny hillside, with the soldiers standing silently like statues, exuding a sense of readiness for war. The Emperor's arrival was met with solemn respect, and the reading of the manifesto evoked emotions, even causing the Emperor Alexander to shed tears.

The young army rejoiced with wild enthusiasm upon hearing the news from the Bishop. A shout of joy, relief, and triumph filled the air, lifting the weight of suspense from the crowd. The soldiers celebrated, tossing their caps in the air. The Grand Duke Nicholas's orders were read, signaling the end of the day's work. Hundreds of thousands of young men were granted the right to go to war. The outcome was sad for all involved, except for those in power who desired the conflict. War, as pondered upon later, is often caused by ambitious leaders of enslaved nations. Nicholas, a young and wise soldier, was chosen for a secret mission. The narrative shifts to personal experiences, where a risky journey on the Danube unfolds.

For a brief moment, a loud rushing noise filled my ears as I struggled to hold my breath underwater. Gasping for air, I finally surfaced and looked around in the darkness and water. I noticed an object floating nearby and reached out to grab it. Suddenly, a voice gasped, urging us to stick together and swim in the same direction amidst the swift river current. As we drifted aimlessly, the moon obscured by dark clouds, we spotted distant ships to our right. Desperate, I called out for my companion, Lancey, and saw lights flicker briefly from a vessel before being swept away. Feeling helpless, I then collided with a hen-coop, only to be carried away by the river's force. In the distance, steam launches silently approached for a night attack on a nearby flotilla. Amidst the chaos, I found myself in a perilous situation, hoping for a miracle to save us all.|"['1.

It was a dark night when I found myself in a boat, surrounded by mysterious figures. A hand reached out to pull me aboard, but before I could react, I was forcefully pushed down into the boat. The light from a lantern revealed several faces staring at me with curiosity. A stern voice demanded to know who I was. Suddenly, I recognized Nicholas Naranovitsch among them, leaving me speechless. Nicholas whispered to the officer and the lantern was extinguished, plunging us into darkness. He explained that we were on a secret torpedo mission. As we approached a Turkish monitor, chaos erupted as we successfully launched a torpedo, causing a massive explosion. The flotilla retaliated in confusion, firing wildly into the night.|"['1.

Our leader noticed the damaged enemy ship slowly sinking at the front. He ordered the second boat to approach. The crew swiftly attached another torpedo to the stern. The officer realized the current wouldn't push it towards the ship, so they moved back and detonated the charge, causing a massive explosion. The enemy ship was obliterated, with only its masts visible above water. As daylight broke, our boat faced danger from other monitors. A Turkish boat approached, but a skilled diver on our team fixed our screw, deterring the attack. We safely navigated down the Danube, reflecting on the destruction caused.

Lancey quickly revealed his location to the Turks. A boat was lowered, and he was brought aboard, but it was evident that he was viewed with suspicion. Rushed before the deck's officer, he was closely interrogated. Lancey realized his grasp of the Turkish language was lacking, causing his attempts at communication to fail. A sailor who claimed to speak English was summoned. Lancey introduced himself as a groom from England. The Turks, skeptical of his story, searched the vessel for any threats due to recent Russian activities. Despite the luxurious cabin not meeting Lancey's fantastical expectations, the Turkish captain and his officer's exotic appearance captivated him.

Traveling quietly across a flat marshy area, they reached a small village around noon. In front of the main inn, there were several adorned horses. Lancey was expected to have lunch and join the group, but he wasn't sure in what capacity. The reserved nature of the Turks had left Lancey puzzled and disappointed, leading him to stop asking questions. As the group prepared to depart after lunch, Lancey realized he was not treated as an important figure incognito. A Turk, seemingly a servant, gestured for Lancey to mount his horse. Lancey followed the group, keeping a humble distance. The journey continued for days, with Lancey attempting conversations with his guardian, the only one acknowledging him. Upon reaching the sea, they boarded a waiting steamer towards Constantinople, where Lancey's companions left him without farewells. Lancey's guardian signaled for him to follow, leading him through the bustling streets of the city. Eventually, they arrived at a grand building that resembled a mix of a barracks and a birdcage, which appeared intimidating. Lancey hesitated but entered, finding himself alone with an armed guard. Lancey mentally prepared for the worst but was surprised when the guard led him to the palace's opulent interior. The lavish decor and luxurious surroundings left Lancey speechless, contrasting starkly with the exterior of the building.

"The confused man repeated the name ""Sanda Pasha"" slowly, wondering if the meeting would indeed happen the next day. He doubted it, but decided it was not his concern. After enjoying a feast of fruits and wine, he woke to a lavish breakfast served by his black friend. Anticipating a meeting with Sanda Pasha, he was surprised when no one came until the afternoon, offering him a substantial dinner. Later, he was ushered into a beautiful room to meet the red-bearded officer from the Turkish monitor. The officer accused him of blowing up the monitor, leaving the man stunned.

During a lively gathering, the host, a black man with a beaming smile, wielded a massive sword that was blunt and well-used. While the guests were distracted by the sword, a dervish slyly indulged in a dish of cream. The Nubian host, noticing this, tricked the dervish into drinking a glass of vinegar, causing amusement among the guests. The dervish, known for his voracious appetite, bravely sang a song despite being full. When an English guest sang a ballad, the host was moved to tears, showing his deep appreciation for music.

As I roamed the tranquil town on a peaceful morning, my mind couldn't shake thoughts of war. Human history seems to repeat itself every quarter-century, with wars erupting despite past lessons. My reflections were interrupted by the distant sound of gunfire across the Danube. The peaceful view of Rustchuk's minarets was shattered by the Russian bombardment of the Turkish shore. Chaos ensued as shells tore through the town, destroying homes and injuring civilians. Amid the devastation, I encountered a wounded boy and a traumatized girl.

"The final comment made me quiet for a while. My future relative's perspective was completely different from mine, leaving me unsure of how to respond.

Led to a fire, a man, bloodied and wounded, glanced around in terror before recognizing Petroff. He cried out and seized his hand. Riding for an hour, we reached a village devastated by war. Dead men and women littered the streets, peasants who had fought bravely but in vain against marauders from the Turkish army. Mutilated bodies and burning cottages filled the village. The lone survivor, in a state of shock, refused to leave. When urged, he tragically took his own life. We pursued the attackers, finding them unguarded in a dell.

"A voice near me chuckled, seemingly mocking my thoughts. It sounded more like a fiend than a man. I turned swiftly to find Andre Yanovitch, his youthful face twisted in triumph, wiping his sword after vanquishing the last of the Bashi-Bazouks who failed to flee into the nearby woods. ""These savages won't harm women and children again,"" he declared, sheathing his sword and trotting to his comrades. The young and tender-hearted Andre had begun his war education, his heart filled with a mix of pity and vengeance. The scout, Dobri Petroff, a seasoned man from a land of tyranny, had also shown his mettle in battle. While they fought, the Cossacks in Russia were facing their own struggles.

"There is a strong feeling in my mind that this is a war of extermination. 'No quarter' is too frequently the cry on either side. I do not say that the Russians mean it to be so, but when Bashi-Bazouks torture their prisoners in cold blood, and show fiendish delight in the most diabolical acts of cruelty, even going the length of roasting people alive, is it strange that a brutalising effect is produced on the Russians, and that they retaliate in a somewhat similar spirit at times? The truth is, mother, that one of the direct and most powerful effects of war is to dehumanise, and check the influence of, the good men engaged, while it affords a splendid opportunity to the vicious and brutal to give the rein to their passions, and work their will with impunity. ""But, while this is so with the combatants, many of those outside the ring are stirred to pity and to noble deeds.

Amid the chaos, Eskiwin stood out with his calm efficiency. While others fumbled with their gear in a rush, he saddled his horse deliberately. Ali Bobo, equally composed but more swift, helped Lancey onto his horse after a mishap. As they retreated from the approaching Russians, Ali Bobo fell from his horse, wounded. Eskiwin, showing no emotion, dug a grave for his fallen comrade. Despite the imminent danger of the Russians closing in, Eskiwin continued with solemn determination.

On his third attempt, Lancey not only returned to the same place but accidentally stepped on the grave, causing Ali Bobo to stir. Lancey, terrified by the sight of the Turk rising from the grave, fled in fear. The Don Cossacks, hearing Lancey's yell, approached, but mistook Ali Bobo for a wounded man and fled in horror. Ali Bobo, perplexed by the situation, eventually continued his journey, encountering Lancey again, who fled once more. Ali Bobo, amused by the misunderstanding, continued on his way, eventually finding his detachment and friend Eskiwin.

Lancey, a man of peace in mind and morals, was unexpectedly fierce in physical combat. He swiftly engaged with a Bulgarian, overpowering him with a hand on his windpipe and a knee on his stomach. A villager intervened, alerting others who subdued Lancey and presented him to the village chief, a Turkish man with a dark beard. Despite Lancey's fears of punishment, the chief showed leniency upon learning he had only fought a Bulgarian. Lancey, unable to communicate, was fed and allowed to leave. As he tried to befriend the villagers, Russian soldiers arrived, causing chaos and mistreatment.

Hardly had Lancey resolved to observe the approaching spearmen when he noticed a group of horsemen riding towards the village. The villagers, aware of the distinction between regular and irregular troops, watched with concern. The horsemen were Cossacks, viewed as allies by the Bulgarians seeking liberation from Turkish rule. Welcomed with cheers, the Cossacks swiftly began requisitioning supplies. They gathered food, wine, and livestock in haste, leaving without payment, leaving the villagers feeling indebted. As Lancey observed from above, an old woman entered the room below, searching for food. Sympathetic, Lancey assisted her. Outside, Bashi-Bazouks arrived, causing fear among the villagers. Lancey and the old woman remained hidden until a commotion outside signaled the arrival of Turkish soldiers, fleeing a distant conflict.

One group of Turks suddenly charged towards the hut where Lancey sat with the elderly woman. With no weapons and his arms taken when captured, Lancey stayed put. The Turks barged in, barred the door, and began firing through the window. Amidst the chaos, the commander fell, fatally wounded. Ignoring the fallen leader, a soldier shot at Lancey, grazing him and fatally hitting the elderly woman. Enraged, Lancey seized a rifle, attacking the soldiers with unmatched fury, driving them out. His temporary insanity gave him almost supernatural strength, causing the Turks to flee in fear.

Lancey paused, resting against a burning house, wiping his brow as Russian soldiers cheered him on in the chaos of the village engulfed in flames. Amid the continuous exchange of fire, brave Russians advanced, using brushwood for cover and to ignite the town-house where the villagers sought refuge. Despite the smoke and terror, they pressed on, facing the defenders head-on. Lancey, fueled by a mix of rage and memories, pushed through the chaos towards a Turkish man's home, where a tense confrontation unfolded.

There was no time to explain. Lancey sensed the approaching Russians and knew a brave man wouldn't attack from behind. He dropped his rifle, shut and bolted the door, then raised his hands in surrender to the Turk. They barricaded the door with furniture and rushed to secure the other entrance. Just in time, they heard shouts nearing. Lancey, rifle in hand, stood guard at the door, deterring the Russians. When they tried to enter, Lancey gently threw one aside, earning respect from the soldiers who recognized him. He managed to escape the chaos and found himself between enemy lines. As night fell, he hid in the rocks, unseen. Meanwhile, Dobri Petroff, a scout, learned of an impending attack on a village where his friend Petko Borronow's sister resided.

Petroff's friend, Andre, noticed his troubled expression as they sat by the fire. Petroff had heard officers discussing the need for a spy to gather information about the Turkish forces. Andre questioned why Petroff didn't ask for permission instead of risking being seen as a deserter. Petroff explained that he might not be granted permission and couldn't act against orders. Despite the risks, Petroff decided to go as a spy to protect his friends. He emphasized the importance of personal liberty since he wasn't a Russian soldier. Petroff prepared to venture into the enemy's lines, promising to gather vital information. He urged Andre to remember him by a locket with auburn hair.

A burst of thrill filled him upon finding he wasn't alone in the thicket. A man dozed against a tree. The scout readied his revolver, unseen. Shooting him would alert both sides. Passing quietly seemed impossible. Retreating meant a risky detour. An idea struck him. He had hunted these mountains before, skilled in stealth. He decided to stalk the man, relying on his strength. Petroff quietly hung his sword and carbine, ready to use his knife and revolver if needed. Meanwhile, Turkish soldiers chatted by a watch-fire. Ali Bobo vowed to capture a Russian sentinel to prove his strength, joined by Eskiwin. Together, they set off cautiously through the fog to sneak past their own sentries.|['1.

As the fog veiled the Turkish sentries, two Russian horsemen, Sergeant Gotsuchakoff and Corporal Shoveloff, cautiously approached. They were keen on adventure and were scouting the enemy's disposition. The Turks, including Eskiwin, observed them from a cliff. The friends above were frustrated as they overheard the Russians whispering. Suddenly, Bobo, one of the Turks, hurled a stone at Sergeant Gotsuchakoff. Startled, the corporal rode off, and the sergeant remained still. Meanwhile, Dobri Petroff, another observer, noticed a figure leaning against a tree. Bobo swiftly subdued the figure with Eskiwin's help. Although Petroff was concerned, he realized the Turks were tying up the captured man without intending immediate harm.|"[""1.

The scout was surprised by what happened next. A short Turk held a gun to a prisoner's head, then let go to speak. The prisoner's voice sounded familiar to Petroff. The Turks recognized him, and the short man shook the prisoner's hand warmly. Meanwhile, Sergeant Gotsuchakoff began to wake up and muttered about it being too early. The scout saw that caution was needed and silently gave orders. Gotsuchakoff restrained the men, and Petroff told him about the Englishman. The sergeant then led the trio towards the Russian lines.

Upon arriving at Besika Bay, I was surprised to find the British fleet at anchor. Excited to visit some of the ships where I had friends, I was particularly astonished to see the _Thunderer_ among them. Remembering my friend's advice, I boarded the _Thunderer_ and was warmly welcomed by the captain. The crew was bustling with activity, preparing for an important mission. As we set out, we spotted a massive Russian ironclad and a frigate nearby. When the Russian ironclad fired at us unprovoked, I felt a surge of anger. Witnessing the launch of a Whitehead torpedo towards the frigate, I saw the destructive power it unleashed. Moments later, the frigate sank, sending shockwaves through the sea.|"['1.

I watched in shock as the steam-launch was prepared to be used as a torpedo-boat. The launch started firing bullets relentlessly, but they did not harm the enemy's boat. Then, the _Thunderer_ fired its massive gun and sank the enemy's boat. The crew cheered, and the Russians retaliated with their guns, hitting the _Thunderer_ but causing no serious damage. To confuse the enemy, the captain used an electric light to illuminate the area and sent out the steam-launch.

From the turret, bulwark, and mast-head, flames erupted, and the sea churned with bullets while spouts rose from heavy gunshots. All focus was on the torpedo-boat. The bright light on the _Thunderer_ had blinded the enemy to its own actions. Suddenly, the Russians noticed us nearby, heading straight towards them at full speed. Both sides fired their turret guns, resulting in a deafening crash. Our ram sliced through the Russian ship, almost splitting it in two. As we backed away, the Russian ship's magazine exploded, causing chaos and destruction. Debris rained down on our deck, and amidst the chaos, a Russian gun fell towards me.

A tragic scene unfolded before me as I witnessed a procession of villagers fleeing from ruthless warriors who had ravaged their homes. The group consisted of old men, women, and children seeking refuge, wounded and carrying their most valued possessions. Among them was an elderly man, a former soldier, comforting a young woman with a neck wound, while holding onto an old cavalry sabre. An old bedridden woman miraculously found the strength to flee in fear of being left behind. A young mother, gravely ill, cradled her baby with a look of death upon her. A fever-stricken young man, restrained by his father and two women, fought in delirium. Medical professionals, driven by skill and compassion, joined the journey to aid those in need.

"As he spoke, I witnessed the leader of the troop fall from his horse, struck by a stray ball. It was then that I noticed bullets flying over our heads occasionally. At that moment, a staff officer rode up with orders. Witnessing the event, the officer took charge and commanded the troop to move forward. I immediately recognized the voice as Nicholas'. They raced past us, exuding a sense of noble sacrifice for their homeland. My heart swelled with pride as I cheered along with the surrounding troops.

The squadron encountered the Turks unexpectedly, displaying true courage. Despite their valour, the dragoons swiftly overpowered the Turks. Upon their return, the Turks regrouped, reinforced, and launched another assault. Our side received reinforcements, acknowledging the strategic importance of our position.

Our commander, following General Skobeleff's tactic, withheld fire until the Turks were close. The ensuing battle was fierce, resulting in a devastating blow to the Turks. The plain was left strewn with fallen soldiers, a grim reminder of the toll of war.

""God help us!"" I cried out, realizing the tragic loss of life. A voice beside me remarked that the true instigators of this conflict were not on the battlefield but back ""at home.""

"I met a speaker from a Scottish newspaper who was a correspondent. As fellow ""specials,"" we quickly bonded. Before we could chat much, our men were told to attack. It was heartbreaking to see the young soldiers, with shattered bodies and brave faces. A man is like a machine, as is a household, town, or state. People usually avoid war, but governments often seek it. Nations turn to courts and arbitrators for disputes. The Turk had promised freedom to his Christian subjects years ago but failed to deliver. If Europe had forced him to keep his promise, war could have been avoided. The blame for the war lies with Europe, not England, as they were not all-powerful at the conference.

Opinions vary on every topic, but having no opinion or a biased one, based solely on emotions without considering both sides, is not ideal, as explained by the speaker. An ambulance arrived, diverting attention to attend to wounded individuals. Amid the chaos, the speaker fetched water from a nearby spring, risking harm due to the ongoing battle. The conflict intensified throughout the day, with the Russian regiment defending a hill while facing fierce Turkish attacks. The battle escalated with artillery and gunfire, creating a storm-like atmosphere. The Turks attempted a flank maneuver, engaging in a brutal confrontation near the Russian trenches. The Russians strategically used mines to repel the Turkish advance, leading to a gruesome hand-to-hand combat scene with intense violence and chaos.|['1.

Perched on a hill, Turkish generals oversee the battle, moving troops strategically. Despite casualties, the focus remains on Turkey's integrity and the wealth of its leaders. Peasants labor and sacrifice their lives for the cause. The generals order more troops, indifferent to the loss of lives and the suffering of families left behind. The hill, though seemingly insignificant, holds symbolic importance. As the battle rages, the Russians are initially beaten but regroup. Amid the chaos, the scout brings news of atrocities committed by Circassians or Bashi-Bazouks. An urgent mission is proposed, emphasizing the brutality of the enemy.

He spoke with such sincerity, his face pale with urgency, making it impossible for me to refuse. Exhausted from the day's work, I knew I had strength left for an emergency. The scout nodded, and in ten minutes, I returned with our horses ready. Lancey had them prepared, and after a quick drink, I mounted. It was dark, but Petroff knew the way. We rode fast for hours until dawn approached, nearing Venilik. As we got closer, the scout's face turned anxious. Smoke filled the sky, confirming the village was burned. Petroff's expression changed to a dark frown, spurring his horse with a knife in hand. We arrived at the village, seeing destruction everywhere. Dobri, the scout, ran towards his burnt home, and we followed. A chilling shout echoed as we found his house in ruins, bones visible among the ashes. A woman attacked Dobri, accusing him of abandoning them during the attack. She demanded her child back, but Dobri stood in shock, his home destroyed beyond recognition.|"[""1.

I knew it was futile to continue the search among the ruins of the village. The devastation caused by the Turkish irregulars was beyond imagination. The horrors we witnessed were too gruesome to describe. Cattle roamed aimlessly, and dogs and pigs scavenged the remains of the slaughtered villagers. Hoping to find survivors, we entered the church, only to be met with a scene of unimaginable carnage. The old man we rescued shared the tragic tale of the attack. Amidst the chaos, a little girl emerged, blood-stained and terrified. Recognizing her, I comforted her, and she clung to me, seeking solace from the atrocities she had witnessed. As she fell asleep in my arms, relief washed over her. Soon, aid arrived, bringing comfort and care to the wounded. I longed for rest, knowing that even a brief respite would rejuvenate me.|"['1.

We quickly left the terrible slaughterhouse, with Ivanka still asleep on my shoulder. We found an outhouse with some straw, which I rolled into a pillow to lie down without disturbing her. Soon, I fell into a deep sleep from exhaustion. Memories of the massacre in the Bulgarian village cloud my mind like a confusing dream. I was struck with a fever that night, leading to delirium and weakness. I experienced intense agony and vivid hallucinations. I was visited by both good and bad spirits, with one bad spirit showing me disturbing images. In my fevered state, I felt jolted in a wagon, thirsty and surrounded by chaos. Lancey and Ivanka appeared in my visions, along with a mysterious man in flowing robes named Sanda Pasha. He was a friend in disgrace, who had protected us from Russians but was now in trouble with the Turkish government. Despite the confusion, we were safe in one of his villas, living comfortably.|['1.

Lancey's messages were so astonishing, varied, and thought-provoking that my mind struggled to remember them all. Soon, I fell into a deep, dreamless sleep. Meanwhile, the conflict between the Russians and Turks intensified. Bloody battles occurred in Bulgaria and the Balkans. Osman Pasha's defense of Plevna gained him fame. Modern weapons made warfare deadlier and costlier. Dobri Petroff's bravery caught General Skobeleff's attention, but Dobri sought an honorable death in battle. Nicholas Naranovitsch and Dobri formed a bond. As the Russian troops surrounded Plevna, Osman Pasha decided to break through the encirclement. Snow covered the ground as the soldiers prepared for the imminent clash. Nicholas geared up for the upcoming mission while emphasizing the importance of being well-fed and armed.|"[""1.

The scout remained silent. Since the tragic event that had affected him, he had become quiet and somewhat unstable, yet his eyes held a fierce determination. Another spy arrived during the night, revealing that Osman was gathering his soldiers near the Vid bridge, providing them with supplies. At the same time, reports of unusual activities in Plevna emerged. Nicholas and Dobri Petroff rode towards the Vid bridge, while Skobeleff headed to the Krishina redoubts, finding them abandoned. The battle commenced with Ottoman troops approaching the Russian trenches. The clash began with a thunderous roar of artillery and rifles, shrouded in mist and smoke. The scene was chaotic, with cries of wounded men, moving wagons, and the clash of armies. The Turks charged the Russian trenches, leading to fierce combat.

Shortly before a critical moment, a small group of Turks under the leadership of Sanda Pasha, who was reinstated by the wavering powers in Constantinople, fought desperately to turn the tide at Plevna. Despite his injury, his followers believed he had fallen, fueling their rage and driving them to fight fiercely. As the battle intensified, Russian reinforcements arrived, bringing Nicholas and Petroff closer to their desired fate. Amidst the chaos, Dobri Petroff faced off against the Nubian Hamed Pasha in a fierce duel that ended in tragedy for both. The Turkish forces, overwhelmed and beaten, regrouped and retaliated, while the battle continued with both sides under cover for hours. Ultimately, the conflict ended in a stalemate, highlighting the futility of war and the concept of mutual agreement, akin to schoolboys halting a fight without a clear victor.|"[""1.

The battle at Plevna was fierce, but as the day progressed, the gunfire lessened until silence fell. A white flag emerged, signaling a truce. Russian troops cheered as Turkish envoys approached to negotiate. The aftermath of war was evident, with wounded soldiers and fallen comrades dotting the landscape.

The battlefield, once bustling with life, now lay deserted except for the dead and dying. As night fell and the cold grew intense, even the few remaining soldiers disappeared. The moon rose high, casting an eerie light on the tragic scene. Nicholas Naranovitsch, once full of youth, now lay wounded and unable to move, surrounded by the groans of suffering men. In the quiet of the early morning, a hymn of praise to God began to fill the air, sung by dying soldiers seeking solace. Among them was Hamed Pasha, who, in his last moments, gazed around before passing away. Dobri Petroff, nearly crushed under the weight of the dead, managed to free himself but succumbed to his wounds.

Petroff found the Pasha, who gazed longingly at the water. Despite a moment of anger, Petroff showed mercy. He approached the dying Turk and offered him water. As Petroff struggled to help, he realized his own injuries. Just as he tried to give the Turk more water, Nicholas groaned weakly. Petroff spoke of reuniting with loved ones and God. Nicholas, struggling, managed to move the Turk's head. He saw men looting the dead and killing the wounded. Nicholas, fearing for his life, shot at them but missed. Russian soldiers intervened, capturing the criminals. Recovering, Nicholas wanted to return to the Russian lines. Learning of brutal Turkish actions, he was eager to leave. Reports of Bulgarian executions shocked him. The Turks seemed bent on wiping out Bulgarian males.

The assistant was pleased with the secretary's actions in eliminating Bulgarian men but showed some sympathy for the suffering refugees. The town was filled with trembling refugees bearing expressions of horror and despair. Many had witnessed loved ones tortured and killed before their eyes. The secretary praised the charitable help from England and other countries that prevented many refugees from perishing.

"""Yes, you may well laugh at that one,"" he chuckled. ""It was taken under fire, and I can tell you that a sketch made under fire is apt to turn out defective in drawing. That highly effective and happy accidental touch in the immediate foreground I claim no credit for. It was made by a bullet which first knocked the pencil out of my hand and then terminated the career of my best horse; while that sunny gleam in the middle distance was caused by a piece of yellow clay being driven across it by the splinter of a shell. On the whole, I think the sketch will hardly do for the _Evergreen_, though it is worth keeping as a reminiscence.""

Nicholas was not dead, but so badly wounded that there was no chance of his ever again attaining to the semblance of his old self. The doctors, however, had pronounced him at last out of danger. His sound constitution and great strength had enabled him to survive injuries which would have carried off most men in a few days or hours. His whole frame had been shattered; his handsome face dreadfully disfigured, his left hand carried away, and his right foot so grievously crushed by a gun-carriage passing over it that they had been obliged to amputate the leg below the knee.

In a chalet on a woody knoll, there are young men who were once strong and full of life but are now crippled by war. Some move slowly with crutches, trying to regain their vigor. Others sit in wheelchairs, pushed by caring loved ones. A young soldier named Nicholas, covered in wounds, lies in pain on a bed, his face scarred and bandaged. His fiancee, Bella, arrives, determined to stand by him despite his injuries. Bella insists that Nicholas must not give up on their engagement, even though he feels broken and unworthy. Despite his protests, Bella remains steadfast, reminding him that they are in this together and that she will not let him push her away.

"Bella playfully responded, ""If he dared to do that, I would demand a second opinion from two other doctors before following his advice. But let's put this to rest. You need care, and both mother and I are here to help."" With light-hearted banter, she gave him a glimmer of hope, hinting that recovery might be possible. Slowly, Nicholas transitioned from bed to sofa, then attempted to stand. The doctor assured him that with time, a prosthetic leg could restore some mobility. Despite his initial doubts, Nicholas began to improve under Bella's cheerful encouragement. The doctor lightened the mood, mentioning the advancements in prosthetics, sparking a glimmer of optimism in Nicholas. Bella, determined to support him, stood firm in her resolve, ready to face the challenges ahead with unwavering dedication."|[]|[]
Let's revisit the Balkan Mountains. Snow blankets both the valley and the hill during the harsh winter season. In the past, warriors would take a break during this time, resting until spring. However, in modern times, warriors and their weapons are deadlier. While leaders debate comfortably, soldiers are sent to prolong conflicts, resulting in bloodshed. In a remote shepherd's hut, Marika mourns the loss of her loved ones. Despite the tragic events, she decides to join the ambulance corps as a nurse, finding solace in helping others.

After a few weeks at the hospital, a change was made in Marika's duties. She was moved to a more spacious room to care for the patients needing extra attention. That evening, she assisted the surgeons on their rounds. They examined a man who was severely weakened, with little blood left in his body. Despite his critical condition, the man, Dobri Petroff, regained consciousness and shared his harrowing story of survival. Marika, filled with hope by Dobri's survival, approached her hospital duties with newfound optimism. Dobri, though physically weakened, remained determined to find his daughter Ivanka, believing she might still be alive.

"""I disagree,"" I responded quickly. ""It's possible for me to recognize and criticize a problem even if I don't have a solution. By speaking out against an issue, I can help raise awareness and encourage others to find remedies. Take sea-sickness, for example. It's terrible, and I won't stay silent about it. When many others join in, we create a clamor that catches the attention of skilled individuals. This led to the creation of the _Calais-Douvre_ steamboat, aimed at combating sea-sickness. While the success of this solution is uncertain, the key is that our vocal outcry prompted action. My hope is not madness; it's about striving for peace despite the presence of sin and conflict. I propose arbitration, where nations commit to resolving disputes peacefully without resorting to war.

My friend expressed his love for traveling enthusiastically, calling it his chief joy on Earth. He described the thrill of exploring the world, gathering information, and sharing it with readers. He then humorously contrasted this joy with the celestial joy of gazing into his wife's blue eyes. Despite his desire to be a poet, he found poetry challenging due to issues like managing feet, finding rhymes, and balancing sentiment. He mentioned his wife's importance in inspiring his writing. Moving on to a more serious topic, U. Biquitous proposed a unique idea of training boys in military skills during their school days, comparing it to learning to swim or skate. He emphasized the importance of this training for national defense, suggesting that even a few days of annual drill could maintain a strong reserve force.|"[""1.

I would propose a small, highly paid, and extremely efficient army for our colonies and homeland. This army would serve as an excellent example in military affairs and a solid foundation upon which the nation could build its defense in times of invasion. The remaining military resources should be well-maintained and ready for action when needed. If all countries adopted this approach, they would be as prepared for war as they are now, while also benefiting from having more productive citizens, reduced crime and poverty, and overall improved well-being. The other person responded optimistically, hoping for a future where peace is prioritized more effectively. They expressed willingness to embrace better systems and advocate for them. The scene shifted to a village where Dobri Petroff and Marika were found in their partially rebuilt home. Despite the devastation around them, a sense of renewal was sparked when Ivanka reunited with her parents. Marika's unwavering faith had sustained her through hardships, and now she praised God with a joyful heart. The narrative then delved into the devastating impact of war, painting a grim picture of its consequences on individuals and nations. War was depicted as a destructive force that robs humanity of its progress, resources, and most importantly, lives. The passage emphasized the futility of war by highlighting the immense losses incurred compared to the negligible gains achieved through conflicts like the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War.|"['1.
