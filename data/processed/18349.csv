"Title: Irish Catholics' Struggle for Freedom

For centuries, Irish Catholics faced persecution, oppression, and limited opportunities in their homeland. Due to harsh laws and restrictions, many Irish Catholics sought refuge abroad, serving as soldiers in foreign lands. The oppressive laws in Ireland denied them civil rights, employment, and even the freedom to practice their religion openly. Catholics were marginalized, unable to hold positions in the army, government, or even own land. They endured imprisonment and death threats for minor offenses. The hope for change led many Irish to support the Jacobite cause, believing that the return of the Stuarts would bring relief from their hardships. Despite the challenges, Irish Catholics remained resilient, seeking freedom and equality in a society plagued by discrimination and sectarian hatred."|['1.

In the late 1700s, Catholics in Ireland faced restrictions until 1774 when they could serve the crown and enlist in the army. Irish regiments had fought in France before the Limerick Convention. After defending Limerick, the Irish army moved to France, forming the Irish Brigade, known for its bravery in battles across Europe. Irish soldiers served in various armies, with their descendants still honored today. Over time, many Irish soldiers served in the British military. A new recruit, Desmond Kennedy, joined the Irish Brigade in France. Despite a mysterious family history, Kennedy's loyalty to the king was unquestionable. His background, upbringing, and entrance into the regiment were explained to ensure a harmonious environment among comrades. Kennedy's story exemplifies the loyalty and courage of Irish soldiers throughout history.|"[""1.

The young man, Desmond, was tall and handsome, showing promise of becoming powerful. He was observant, understanding the importance his countrymen placed on family lineage. Despite being the son of a fallen officer, Desmond was warmly welcomed by his fellow officers. His upbringing under the care of a priest had granted him access to the gentry, contrasting the isolation he would have faced if left at Kilkargan. Desmond's estranged father, O'Carroll, had little involvement in his life, except for arranging his commission in the Irish Brigade. Desmond's journey to join the military was supported by Father O'Leary, who guided him and helped secure his place. Despite his father's distant demeanor, Desmond was grateful for the opportunity to pursue his career.|"[""1.

"O'Sullivan explained, ""It may not have been the most gracious way, but given your circumstances, accepting the money was wise. Fortunately, I had made contact with an Irish officer in France, aiding recruits for the Brigade. Many young Irishmen yearn to join their countrymen, but lack the means. Agents facilitate their journey across the channel. Despite losses in battle, three new regiments have been formed.

Kennedy, it's important to keep your thoughts to yourself. In our brigade, we fight for King James against the English. With William gone and James's daughter on the throne, things are complex. Parliament chose Sophia of Hanover as the next heir, but the quarrel remains. There's doubt Louis will help King James. Father O'Leary believes we must rely on ourselves and loyal friends in Scotland and England. He thinks a Stuart king forced by France would not last. Our loyalty to France is based on the hope of their support. It's best to keep quiet about Father O'Leary's views to avoid discord in the regiment. Desmond remains loyal to King James and trusts in support from within Ireland. Loyalty to France is crucial in the hope of restoring our rightful king.|"[""1.

I didn't practice as much as I wanted to, but I trained with some of the tenants who served in James O'Carroll's regiment. The French officers don't like us much because we often lead assaults. Dueling is banned, but it still happens. In battles, sword skills aren't as crucial; it's mainly about pressing forward. I recommend you spend a couple of hours daily to become an excellent swordsman. Our fencing instructor thinks I'm too hot-headed for it. You seem calmer, so you might excel. It's easy to lose your temper in fights. We have morning drills and free time afterward. The colonel introduced me to James the 3rd at Saint Germain, where he wished he could fight for his rights with us in Ireland or Scotland. He's waiting for France's support after Marlborough's defeat. Kennedy, fresh from Ireland, speaks candidly, unlike us who are used to waiting and being politically correct.|"[""1.

"""Yes, Your Majesty, but they are in the service of France, and, by the terms of the treaty of Limerick, were allowed to expatriate themselves, and to enter the French service.

All this cannot change our loyalty to the Stuart cause. It is encouraging to think that the king's son might inspire personal loyalty. Men fight harder for someone they care about than for an abstract idea. Father O'Leary shared a similar view. He believed the late king's downfall was due to a lack of personal qualities that could rally his followers. Charles the Martyr made mistakes but had passionate supporters. His son, James, lacked this personal appeal. I hope the grandson inherits some of these qualities. Desmond Kennedy trained diligently and became popular in his regiment. Despite initial coldness, he gained favor at the king's court. The counsellors stressed the importance of avoiding actions that could harm the cause. They valued Desmond's potential positive influence on the young king but cautioned against impatience for action. France's support is crucial for any successful uprising.|"[""1.

Mr. Kennedy was asked if he could prevent King James from seeking action and becoming discontented. He assured that he would advise against rash actions, as even Irish supporters believed success required French aid. Encouraged by this, Mr. Kennedy was welcomed at Saint Germain, but his influence did not have the desired effect on the young prince. James, being indolent, did not share Mr. Kennedy's energy and enthusiasm. Despite initial cordiality, their differences became apparent, leading to less frequent visits. James' counselors understood that Mr. Kennedy's spirited nature was too contrasting for the prince, who needed a companion more in tune with his upbringing. Desmond, feeling relieved, preferred focusing on fencing lessons rather than trying to motivate the young king.|"['1.

I am as warm an adherent as ever of the cause of the Stuarts, and should be perfectly ready, when the time comes, to fight my hardest for them; but I would vastly rather fight for the king, than converse with him.""

""I suppose, by what I have seen of him, that he must be somewhat wearisome,"" Phelim O'Sullivan said, with a laugh. ""Fortunately, wit and gaiety are not essential qualities on the part of a monarch; but I must own that, treasonable as it may sound, I fear His Majesty is lacking in other qualities, far more essential in a monarch. I should say that he is kindly and well disposed, he wishes to be fair and just, and may turn out a wise ruler; but he is altogether deficient in energy. I suppose there is no occasion for a king, safely seated upon a throne, to be energetic; but a prince in exile should possess the qualities that excite enthusiasm, and bind men to him. Possibly, the qualities King James possesses would be highly valued by the Scotch, but they would certainly fail to inspire our people.""

The priest, after being offered a large sum of money, began his deceitful plan. He convinced the governor to remove the sewer grating due to health concerns.

The delay gave us time to prepare for defence. Mercy strategically positioned six hundred cavalry to cut off the French cavalry on the right. Our barricade was well-made with narrow openings between square piles. The Germans fired on us, but we waited until they were close before retaliating. Major O'Mahony and Colonel Wauchop led our regiments in a successful counterattack. The French regiment occupied the church and the battery, while Vaudemont's corps approached. The Irish garrison surprised the Austrians with heavy musketry fire. Eugene, upon hearing of the defeat, tried to negotiate with the Irish but was met with defiance.

During a brief pause, the Count de Revel and the Marquis de Queslin managed to regroup French infantry and attempted to reclaim lost gates. They seized the church of Santa Maria and a bastion near the gate of All Saints. O'Mahony found himself leading a full company as Wauchop was injured. The battle was tough as they faced Austrian guards, but O'Mahony strategized well. They repelled attacks from cuirassiers and infantry, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. Despite exhaustion, O'Mahony's men fought bravely. Orders came to march to the gate of Mantua. Captain Dillon led a successful charge, driving back Austrians.

During a military mission in the valley of La Perouse, soldiers faced a challenging task of subduing the Vaudois, a group known for resisting intruders in their mountainous refuge. The soldiers, including an officer, found the mission distasteful as it reminded them of past brutalities they had witnessed. The officer recounts the arduous journey through treacherous terrains, battling unseen foes, enduring hunger, and facing constant danger. Despite the destruction caused to the Vaudois villages, the mission proved futile with heavy losses on their side. The officer expressed relief when the troops were called back, acknowledging the devastation caused and the lasting resentment towards the Irish troops.

The battle at Blenheim was intense. The crest between the two sides was a weak point. The French cavalry were ready to charge if the enemy crossed the swamps. The fighting favored the English, Dutch, and Hanoverians at first. The Prussians and Imperialists faced the left. The Germans showed great bravery. The English cavalry and infantry made strong advances. The battle was fierce, with heavy fire exchanged. The English fell back from Blenheim, and the Germans suffered losses. The cavalry charged, forcing the Germans to retreat. Marcin held his ground against Eugene. The battle turned when Marlborough's forces crossed the rivulet. The French were forced to retreat, and Blenheim surrendered. The day was disastrous, with missed opportunities for victory. The troops in Spain were fighting to support Philip the Fifth against Archduke Charles, backed by England. The troops were distributed among garrisons on the frontier, awaiting further orders.|"['1.

In the historical account, Philip was not inactive. Two armies, led by the Duke of Berwick and General Villadarias, invaded Portugal. Berwick captured Dutch battalions and Portalagre, forcing the garrison to surrender. The allies sent General Das Minas into Spain, capturing towns and defeating French and Spanish troops. Hostilities stopped due to hot weather, and troops went into quarters. The English and Dutch contingent's general resigned due to Portuguese actions, replaced by the Earl of Galway. The next year, Galway captured towns and invested Badajos but faced resistance. Earl of Peterborough sailed to Valencia with troops and captured Barcelona, astonishing the Spaniards. Philip advanced on Barcelona but retreated when Peterborough aided the besieged. Despite challenges, Peterborough's daring tactics led to success, capturing Catalonia. French reinforcements arrived, but Philip raised the siege and retreated. The English force, Portuguese, and Spanish adherents faced internal conflicts. The forces retreated towards Valencia, facing hardships. The Battle of Almanza ensued, where the English, Dutch, and Portuguese forces fought bravely, despite losses.|"['1.

On the next day, with no supplies, some escaped to Portugal, while the rest surrendered. Valencia, Saragossa, and other towns welcomed us, yet the Archduke Charles's cause seemed doomed. Despite our successes, we lost all Spanish territories in Italy that year. The English pledged continued support to prolong the war in Spain, diverting French troops from Marlborough in Flanders. Galway and Das Minas were returned to Portugal, and General Stanhope took command. Desmond, after mastering the rapier, explored Paris cautiously with his soldier servant, Mike. O'Neil warned of dangerous areas rife with crime. Desmond avoided wine shops to steer clear of trouble, recalling Ireland's tumultuous drinking culture.

In our Brigade, soldiers have specific cabarets for their use, and French troops are not allowed in these wine shops. Officers have their own preferred establishments.

Quarrels are swiftly stopped to uphold the regiment's honor. Disputes are resolved by the colonel the next day. Desmond aims to avoid conflicts and hopes for soldierly adventures.

Desmond and Mike devised a plan to scale the gate and investigate the mysterious happenings in the house. By standing on Mike's shoulders and using a sash, they managed to reach the top of the gate.

In the scuffle, Desmond narrowly avoided a bullet to the head and retaliated, while Mike took down another assailant. Overwhelmed, the remaining attackers surrendered.

"As he looked around the room, his gaze landed on a young girl about seventeen years old. She was by the window, her hands tightly clasped.

The nobleman was ordered to leave Versailles and return to his estates due to the serious outrage he committed against Mademoiselle Pointdexter. Despite the king's decision, Baron Pointdexter expressed his dissatisfaction, feeling that the punishment was too lenient for the offense. The king, understanding the Baron's concerns, showed kindness to Anne at the court levee to protect her reputation. Although grateful for the king's gesture, Baron Pointdexter was still troubled by the situation and contemplated seeking further retribution through a duel. However, he hesitated to challenge the nobleman due to the risk involved and his responsibility as Anne's protector.

The soldier, Monsieur Kennedy, explained to the King how he rescued Mademoiselle Pointdexter after hearing her cry for help during an evening stroll. The King praised his bravery but cautioned against always intervening in such situations. Monsieur Kennedy then modestly described his actions as a simple act of assisting a woman in distress, regardless of her status. The King commended him and awarded him a valuable ring as a token of gratitude. The Baron expressed his deep appreciation and invited Monsieur Kennedy to his chateau. Despite the Baron feeling indebted, Monsieur Kennedy felt more than adequately rewarded for his spontaneous act of heroism.

We discovered Mademoiselle Pointdexter and were informed that her carriage, along with the horses, remained in the stable. We retrieved it, harnessed the horses, and placed her attendant, an elderly woman, in the carriage. Mike drove, I rode a horse, and we escorted her to her father's residence in Versailles. After ensuring her safe arrival, we hurried back just in time for the regiment's formation on parade. I had not encountered Baron Pointdexter and was uncertain of his actions—whether he would conceal the incident or report it to the king. Until I learned his decision, I believed it prudent to remain silent. Upon my visit to Versailles today, I discovered that he had brought the matter to the king's attention. The Vicomte de Tulle, responsible for the offense, had been banished to his estates. I had the privilege of meeting His Majesty, who commended my actions and presented me with this ring as a token of his approval. The colonel and major praised my conduct, acknowledging the risk I undertook to assist Mademoiselle Pointdexter.

Fortunately, even if a courier takes the vicomte's word that the baron and his daughter have said their goodbyes to His Majesty, the man cannot learn of it for two days, no matter how swiftly the messenger travels. Tulle is nearly a hundred miles closer to Paris than Pointdexter, positioned between Florac and Sainte Afrique. Both towns fall within the estate's vicinity. While I acknowledge the baron might swiftly return to his lands, the vicomte could be ready to depart upon receiving the news. However, he must ride about eighty miles to intercept our path. He might head north to find a suitable spot for an ambush. Even if he hastens, we will be halfway to Paris before any potential encounter. My men should rendezvous with us by then. This villain deserves credit for his cunning. It's plausible he has stationed men at Versailles to intercept any messenger heading south from the baron. If our messenger was carrying urgent news, it might attract unwelcome attention. Despite the risks, we can only hope for a safe arrival. The forests are teeming with disbanded soldiers and rogues, making it easy for de Tulle to recruit aid without his tenants' knowledge. The heavy court expenses have driven many to desperation, forcing them into unlawful acts. However, informing the baron of our concerns would be futile.

Early the next morning, they set off for Moulins, a longer journey ahead. The road through the forest was rough, slowing their pace. At two o'clock, riders ahead found a fallen tree blocking the road. The baron was alerted, suspecting an ambush. The coachman and Eustace fired their arquebuses, engaging attackers. Philip dueled with the leader, the Vicomte de Tulle, but was shot. Desmond fought fiercely, inflicting a severe wound on the vicomte. As the assailants closed in, Desmond made a daring move, striking down foes. With the vicomte injured, Desmond and Mike fled into the woods. The attackers, momentarily stunned, tended to their fallen leader. Mike, rejoining Desmond, lamented the losses and the peril Miss Anne faced.

After an hour's ride, they reached Moulins, where Desmond went straight to the mairie. In his uniform, he was treated respectfully by the mayor. However, upon hearing his story, the mayor felt unable to intervene. It appeared to be a private dispute between nobles, and he lacked the necessary force to help. Still, he dispatched four men with a cart to search for any survivors. Desmond then quickly changed horses and sped south to Roanne. Realizing the local authorities wouldn't act, he instructed his companion, Mike, to check inns for a troop of men. Eventually, they learned the group they sought had arrived at the Soleil inn.

Desmond explained that the wounded man from the fight would likely pass through Felletin on his way to Aubusson. To intercept them, Desmond proposed posting men at Aubusson and Pont Gibaut. With a surprise attack and a small group of about thirteen men, they could easily defeat the enemy, who were likely hired robbers and not well-prepared for a fight. Desmond then arranged for fifteen horses and set out with his men, covering a total of seventy miles to reach Aubusson. They left a lookout at Pont Gibaut, and Desmond scouted the area but found no sign of the enemy. Later, a scout reported that the enemy had taken a route to Croc with a carriage and a horse litter.

Desmond and his group swiftly changed their position to a spot between Croc and Felletin. An hour later, a group of horsemen was spotted approaching their hidden location. Desmond lined up his armed men among the trees, waiting for the carriage to pass by, then shouted, and they swiftly attacked the escort. Caught off guard, the escort struggled in the fight. The vicomte, with his head bandaged, tried to attack Desmond but was shot by Mike, saving Desmond. The vicomte expressed surprise at their rescue and inquired about his daughter and Philip. Desmond explained the plan to rescue the vicomte's daughter and the unfortunate attack on the messenger. The vicomte then turned his attention to his daughter, who had fainted due to recent distress.

When they arrived, it was too late. Eustace and the coachman were found dead near the carriage, surrounded by defeated brigands. The leader of the bandits approached the Baron, offering a deal. He demanded the Baron's word that he and his daughter would not attempt to escape or raise an alarm during their journey. Reluctantly, the Baron agreed to ensure the safety of his daughter. They traveled for two nights under guard, stopping at isolated houses. Despite feeling humiliated by the situation, the Baron knew he had to keep his promise to protect his daughter.

After resting briefly and changing horses, they set off for Moulins, reaching the town late in the evening. At the Soleil inn, Desmond learned that Monsieur de la Vallee had been taken to the Couronne by the mayor's men. The landlord informed Desmond that the surgeons were uncertain of Monsieur de la Vallee's fate. Despite having the bullet removed, he remained weak and despondent. Desmond's arrival seemed to stir him from his despair. After being given a restorative, Monsieur de la Vallee weakly expressed relief that Desmond was safe. Desmond recounted their escape from danger and the rescue of Monsieur de la Vallee's daughter. He reassured Monsieur de la Vallee that he had evaded capture.

The doctor explained that he had not allowed anyone to see Monsieur de la Vallee, as they might agitate him. Desmond was advised to retire for the night while the doctor gave the patient a soothing drink. Desmond planned to return after supper to sit by his friend's bedside. He found Mike at the Soleil inn, relieved that de la Vallee was improving. Desmond went back to the Couronne, quietly entering his friend's room to find him sleeping peacefully. He decided to stay the night and fell asleep himself. In the morning, de la Vallee woke up, and they discussed the safe journey of Mademoiselle de Pointdexter and her father.

Desmond admitted to Philip with a grin that he had failed to keep watch as planned. Desmond explained that he had dozed off while Philip slept peacefully and the surroundings were quiet. He assured Philip that he would have woken up if Philip had moved. The surgeon cautioned against Philip moving too soon as it could lead to complications. Desmond suggested that Philip should rest for a fortnight before traveling. Desmond proposed accompanying Philip for part of the journey but emphasized that he needed to return to Paris soon. They arranged for a messenger to inform Anne and the baron of Philip's recovery progress. The messenger was dispatched with letters from Philip and Desmond. The messenger returned with letters of gratitude and reimbursement for expenses incurred during the journey.

After ten days, Philip regained enough strength to walk across the room. The surgeon allowed him to travel to Lyons, just twenty miles away, by boat down the Rhone to Viviers. Desmond accompanied him to Lyons, where Philip boarded a craft down the river, under the care of his own retainers. Desmond and Mike, whose wound had healed, rode back to Paris in easy stages, arriving a day before their leave ended. The colonel praised Desmond for his bravery and informed him that the king requested his presence at Versailles to discuss the recent events. The colonel also revealed that they would march in three days, a timely departure considering the enmity they had incurred. Desmond then shared the details of their journey, the intercepted messenger, and the attack near Moulins. The king commended Desmond's actions and assured him of future opportunities for distinction.

Desmond chuckled, advising O'Neil to wait ten years for wisdom to bloom. The unexpected arrival of Colonel Wauchop and Irish officers set the regiment abuzz. The colonel shared the king's plan for an expedition to Scotland, excluding Irish regiments due to French troops' involvement. Irish officers would lead and train new recruits. A fortunate few were chosen to join the mission secretly. The regiment would set off in an hour, heading north through Montvidier and Arras to an undisclosed port. Each officer was to bring a horse and soldier servant. Colonel Wauchop would lead the journey, with two months' pay in advance.

As the regiment was initially thought to be heading to Spain, staying within the barracks after dark was deemed safe. However, with the possibility of staying longer and joining an expedition to Ireland, the situation has changed. There are concerns that the friends of de Tulle may take matters into their own hands after failing to have you imprisoned. The king, though, has shown support for your actions in rescuing Mademoiselle de Pointdexter. Given the potential danger in Paris, you were included in the list of officers for the expedition. The journey to Dunkirk was enjoyable, with officers informed of their destination. However, a setback occurred as King James fell ill, delaying the departure. This delay could jeopardize the mission due to the presence of English spies and the looming threat of interception by the English fleet.|"['1.

The outcome of the expedition was clear to everyone involved, leading to a sense of hopelessness replacing the initial excitement. The misfortune encountered at the start of the well-prepared and secretive mission was seen as a bad sign. Despite the setbacks, James set sail with a show of support from the warships. However, they soon realized the Salisbury was the slowest ship, causing the fleet to adjust its speed to accommodate her. The delay and the slow ship made some question Kennedy's luck. The fleet encountered the English ships at the Firth of Forth, prompting a retreat to Dunkirk due to the superior English forces. The Irish and Scottish officers were disappointed by the decision to return, feeling powerless with mostly French soldiers aboard.

They worked swiftly. Mike cut the thin lining to create a hole in each boot, large enough to hold ten coins. The officers assisted in cutting the leather to hide the coins. In half an hour, they finished. Mike proudly presented the job, ensuring the hidden coins wouldn't be detected. Leaving their boots behind, the trio moved to the deck. The British fleet was trailing close, with the French ahead. Mike concealed four coins in his mouth, but it was deemed unnecessary. The English frigate approached, signaling for surrender. The French officers handed over their swords. The English lieutenant, sympathetic to the Irish prisoners, promised their comfort. As night fell, the pursuit was abandoned, with the French fleet out of reach. The Salisbury joined, reporting the prisoners and cargo. The officers dined together, maintaining a cheerful atmosphere.|['1.

The officer took every precaution to secure the prisoners. Guards were stationed on the ship and sympathized with the Irish officers due to their recruitment methods.

The prisoners received meals from an outside tavern, paid for in advance by an unknown benefactor. The authorities suspected hidden messages, closely monitoring their food. The prisoners wished for their clever friend, Mike, to aid in their escape, but bribery seemed risky. The turnkey was cautious, unlikely to be swayed by money. The prisoners faced challenges in attempting to escape due to the solid oak door and the complex layout of the prison. They strategized, with O'Neil standing on Desmond's shoulders to survey the surroundings. They observed houses, a stream, a stone bridge, and a marketplace nearby.

We must focus on finding a way out before planning our escape. Desmond suggested taking turns to watch from the window for sympathetic individuals who might help us. By hanging a handkerchief and possibly leaving messages, we could signal our supporters. After days of waiting, they noticed people looking up at the handkerchief but no one made a move. Suddenly, a man resembling Mike, their friend, was seen approaching their location. Despite being puzzled as Mike was left in a different prison, they hoped he could help them. Although the man was dressed as a country peasant, there was a possibility that it was indeed Mike.|"['Question 1: What did Desmond suggest as a way to find help?\nA) Climbing out of the window\nB) Yelling for help\nC) Taking turns to watch from the window\nD) Breaking the door\nE) Running away', 'Question 2: How did they plan to signal their supporters?\nA) By shouting loudly\nB) By sending letters\nC) By hanging a handkerchief\nD) By calling the police\nE) By sending smoke signals', 'Question 3: What did they notice people doing in response to their signal?\nA) Ignoring it\nB) Taking pictures\nC) Looking up at the handkerchief\nD) Shouting back\nE) Climbing up to their window', 'Question 4: Who was the man approaching their location resembling?\nA) Desmond\nB) A country peasant\nC) Mike\nD) A police officer\nE) A guard', ""Question 5: What did they hope the man resembling Mike could do for them?\nA) Bring them food\nB) Take them to a different prison\nC) Help them escape\nD) Report them to the authorities\nE) Steal the guard's keys"", ""Question 6: How was the man dressed when he approached their location?\nA) As a guard\nB) As a police officer\nC) As a country peasant\nD) In a suit\nE) In a prisoner's uniform""]"|['C) Taking turns to watch from the window', 'C) By hanging a handkerchief', 'C) Looking up at the handkerchief', 'C) Mike', 'C) Help them escape', 'C) As a country peasant']
O'Neil had a worn bill that he picked up, hoping to pay it someday. Lacking ink or pen, Desmond got an idea. He took a piece of gold wire, twisted it, and made it stiff. Curious, O'Neil watched as Desmond pricked holes in the paper, letting light through the message. Desmond tore the bill, put a note in a button, and waited for the man outside. The man found the message, and Desmond signaled to him. They used a thread to send a note down. Desmond prepared another message and sent it down with a wool ball. As the clock struck ten, a whistle sounded, and they lowered the ball with the note.|"['1.

They heard a whistle, pulling the thread revealed a silken cord. Another whistle silenced the night. O'Neil planned to saw through the bars, preparing disguises and a rope for escape. With steel saws, they cut through the bars, concealing their work with bread putty. They signaled for help and cut through the main bar. Lowering the grating, they readied the rope for descent. Knots secured the rope as they descended to freedom. Strong and cautious, they made their escape, leaving their coats behind.

Desmond and Mike helped O'Neil down quietly, but his strength waned, causing a sudden descent. O'Neil swore in English, Irish, and French, expressing frustration. They disguised themselves as sedan chairmen to navigate London's streets, avoiding suspicion. The trio, armed and cautious, reached Mike's lodging safely, despite the rowdy atmosphere outside. Desmond thanked Mike for saving them from impending danger, as the government sought to capture and hang officers.

They initially doubted my sincerity, but upon realizing I was serious about giving them money, their demeanor brightened. Not only did they return change, but they also offered me bread and cheese, which I accepted gratefully. I wore the clothes over mine to avoid leaving any trace of my presence.

They decided to abandon the idea of freeing their friends and planned to head to France quickly. They knew the English Government might execute the prisoners, so they aimed to seek an audience with the king to plead for their friends' lives.

They arrived to inform the King that the English Government had decided to execute Colonel Francis Wauchop and the twelve officers from their regiment aboard the Salisbury, which was captured off the coast of Scotland. Desmond, observing the King's expression closely, noticed that this news did not surprise him and that he seemed annoyed by its sudden mention. The fate of a colonel and a group of young officers did not seem to concern him much. However, Lord Galmoy suggested a plan to save the officers' lives by threatening retaliation against the English Government if they were harmed. The King agreed to send a messenger with a letter to negotiate for the officers' release.

The king nodded, and O'Neil explained how they escaped and crossed the channel on a government vessel, all thanks to Desmond's quick thinking. The king was impressed and laughed at the capture of Lord Godolphin. He praised Desmond's resourcefulness and the officers' willingness to follow his lead. The king approved promoting Mr. Kennedy to lieutenant and having the officers join his staff. The king graciously offered them orders for new uniforms, horses, and money. The officers were thrilled with their new roles. Kennedy's luck had turned their fortunes. They discussed the challenges ahead but were excited about the opportunities for promotion. The Duke of Berwick advised them to prepare for their expedition, offering them horses from his stables.|"[""1.

The officers thanked the duke for the horses and then left for Paris. They returned the borrowed horses and uniforms, and informed Lord Galmoy of their new appointments. The officers took a lodging together and ordered military gear. The next day, they bought horses and equipment and ordered uniforms. Desmond also got a horse for Mike and a uniform. They armed themselves with swords and pistols. Desmond joked about his future as a general's aide-de-camp. Despite Mike's satisfaction with going to Flanders instead of Spain, Desmond was indifferent, as he would be fighting against the English in either place. They discussed the differences between campaigning in Spain and Flanders, focusing on the better conditions in Flanders. Kennedy and O'Neil agreed that the war in the north would offer more substantial military action compared to Spain. They looked forward to better food and accommodations in Flanders.|"['**1.

Five minutes before the hour, they gathered at the meeting point. The duke arrived punctually with his officers and a group of troopers. He inspected their gear and horses, showing approval with a nod. Captain Fromart, the duke's secretary, and Lieutenant d'Eyncourt were among the officers present. Mike joined the escort, accompanied by the duke's servant and two cavalrymen serving the officers. O'Neil explained their delay in joining the army, opting to wait for reliable soldiers. They discussed the value of good soldier servants and the challenges of unreliable ones. The conversation shifted to their recent return from England and the duke's experiences in Spain, where the climate and conditions were harsh.

In general, people tend to support the winning side. In Madrid, they would cheer for the Archduke Charles as much as for Philip, except in Catalonia and Valencia. These regions fear Peterborough and support the Austrian cause because they see him as almost supernatural. Some cities show equal loyalty to both candidates without clear reasons. The French fight for Philip due to his relation to Louis, but they have little faith in their Spanish allies. The Spanish military strength has declined due to past defeats and resource depletion. The ongoing war involves England against France, as the Dutch and Austrians are preoccupied elsewhere. Although the situation seems favorable now, with Peterborough gone and Galway's army weakened, Spain's potential military power could be significant with the right leadership.|"['1.

Two days after departing Paris, the group reached Peronne, where a significant gathering of soldiers awaited. Desmond, an aide-de-camp, discovered for the first time that the duke would assume command. The troops at Peronne required more regiments to reach full strength, delaying their movement for weeks. The allies were inactive as Eugene and Marlborough had strategized the campaign. Marlborough hesitated to act offensively due to the stronger French forces and the absence of Hanover troops. Desmond and his fellow aides-de-camp had limited interaction with their commander, who was preoccupied with war matters. Despite his aloofness, his comrades assured that he was a different man in the field, dedicated to his troops' welfare and respected by all. Desmond was assigned to report to Marshal Vendome in Lille, tasked with observing and reporting back to the duke.|"['1.

Lieutenant Kennedy, you are expected by Vendome, who will assign you to mess and ride with the junior officers of his staff. A tent will be set up for you promptly. If any part of the force moves without Vendome, you will go along. There are five battalions of the Irish Brigade in camp, including O'Brien's, to which you belonged before joining Vendome's staff. The marechal-de-camp will introduce you to the officers, ensuring you are well looked after. Most French officers view their duties as leisure rather than work, focusing on pleasure activities. Desmond joined expeditions to towns like Bruges, Ghent, and Ypres, where the inhabitants welcomed the French, opposing the English and Dutch. Desmond spent time with his regiment and the other Irish battalions, reuniting with comrades who thought him lost. The colonel praised Desmond's courage and brain, hoping for the return of other captured officers. The army advanced in late June, with Desmond receiving orders to accompany Berwick. There was a setback as the enemy forced Vendome to retreat from Oudenarde. Desmond and three aides-de-camp were to ride with Berwick, while Captain Fromart stayed back with the force.|"[""1.

There is no time to waste. The duke's horse will be ready in fifteen minutes, and he won't like waiting. Leave your extra horses for now. The escort has been informed. Despite the short notice, the four aides-de-camp and their soldier servants were all mounted on time. They rode about fifty miles, stopping briefly to rest before arriving at Vendome's camp at night. Desmond expressed gratitude to the Duke of Vendome, suspecting Berwick's influence in their warm reception. They were to rest for the night as a battle loomed the next day. The Duke shared the plan to cross the Scheldt at daybreak and engage the enemy. Burgundy's and Vendome's differing strategies were discussed, leading to the decision to advance on Oudenarde.

During the ongoing conflict, Marlborough and Eugene led the main body to the river for crossing, while Vendome planned to attack them. Burgundy, however, wanted to continue the march to Ghent. Vendome argued that in the broken country, a larger army like the French's eighty-five thousand would lose its advantage against Marlborough's eighty thousand. Eventually, Burgundy gave in to Vendome's plan after Berwick sided with the marshal. The allies managed to cross the river and set up at a village north of Oudenarde. Marlborough then ordered an attack on the French at Eynes, leading to the capture and dispersal of several battalions. A fierce battle ensued with both sides fighting fiercely in difficult terrain. The allies managed to drive the French back, and Marlborough's strategic moves further cornered the French forces.

Desmond experienced his first time facing gunfire, feeling a strong discomfort from the sounds of battle. The cannons were left behind due to the armies' rapid movements, leaving only a few guns on the field. Desmond preferred fighting with O'Brien's regiment over being alone in the lanes. The troops initially celebrated as the French advanced, but the battle was far from won. O'Sullivan warned Desmond about enemy movements and sent him to gather information. Desmond rode to various points, observing enemy positions. He spotted a large force heading towards the mill and quickly informed the generals.

"I could not gather any information about the force you mentioned from General Grimaldi at Royegham or on the heights above Diepenbeck.

The commander quickly ordered the troops near the village to prepare for a possible attack. Desmond and Mike dismounted, securing the horses to a tree. Mike bound Desmond's arm with a scarf as they discussed their escape plan. Concerned for their missing comrades, Desmond shared his worries about O'Sullivan, O'Neil, and d'Eyncourt. The firing ceased, indicating a pause in the battle. The general gathered the colonels, explaining the situation and leaving the decision to escape or scatter to their discretion.

The soldier quickly left as the village filled with troops, now in disarray. Officers circulated, proposing a risky plan to break through enemy lines and unite with forces on the plateau. Some soldiers, undeterred by defeat, joined forces to march into the darkness. Others dispersed quietly. A few indulged in wine and beer, while the rest collapsed from exhaustion. Two soldiers, Desmond and Mike, disguised themselves with stolen uniforms to navigate safely. They met no obstacles and reached the plateau, reporting back to headquarters. Desmond shared their journey, noting the majority of troops had already left. The doctor, impressed by their resourcefulness, provided medical aid and planned to requisition supplies.

Berwick instructed Kennedy to lie down immediately as they were set to march at daybreak. The marshal and Berwick had arranged everything, urging Kennedy to eat despite his faintness from hunger and his wound. Desmond managed a few mouthfuls before dozing off on the sofa, exhausted from the day's work. By morning, five thousand troops had joined the camp, and they set off for Ghent at daylight. Desmond learned none of his comrades had returned, fearing they were either killed or captured. D'Eyncourt would be treated as a prisoner of war, and O'Sullivan and O'Neil faced a grim fate if linked to escaped Newgate officers.

"The journey's riskiest part will be crossing the mountains. Traveling through the defiles, we might face watched roads and potential attacks. In case of an assault, we must try to ride through. If that's impossible, we'll fight fiercely. ""You can count on us, Major,"" the sergeant assured. Discontent with the current task, they veered off near Merida and headed towards Truxillo. Desmond pondered the map, debating between two roads from Truxillo. Opting for the main road to Almarez for a possible confrontation, they prepared for potential danger. Desmond handed a crucial report to Mike for safekeeping, emphasizing its importance to the Duke of Orleans. Despite differing views on the cause, the mission's success was paramount."|['1.

The following day, at dawn, the group started their journey up the sierra. Initially, no signs of any individuals were visible until they approached an area where the path was flanked by steep hills. The leader instructed the men to ride towards some boulders nearby, dismount, and fire a volley to deter their unseen adversaries. The soldiers' superior weapons and accuracy quickly turned the tide in their favor, causing the bandits to retreat and seek cover. As the skirmish unfolded, reinforcements for the bandits arrived, prompting a strategic response from the soldiers. They fired, forcing the bandits to climb higher up the hill before charging down the road. The surprise attack caught the bandits off guard, leading to a swift victory without the need for swords. Desmond, the leader, credited their success to the element of surprise and quick action, sparing them from significant losses.|"['1.

That night, Desmond and Mike stayed in Almarez and then traveled to Oropesa before reaching Toledo the next day. Desmond rewarded his escort and rode into Madrid with Mike. In Madrid, the Duke of Orleans was surprised by Desmond's report on the inaccurate provisions in Badajos. The Duke was concerned as Badajos was crucial for blocking enemy advances. Desmond revealed attempts on his life and the assassination of a Spanish colonel who helped him. The Duke praised Desmond's strategic actions during the attacks. The King decided to take immediate action against the corrupt governor and contractors. Desmond suggested sending French soldiers and dragoons to secure Badajos.

Mike is a tricky character. He might run away before we reach him. He knows that once I report back, he's in trouble. I hope to find him one day and make him pay for sending men to harm you and obstruct us. As for his deceit with the Spaniards, that's their issue to deal with. I want to settle the score myself. My main task, Mike, is to inspect roads, bridges, and passes. The duke can't rely on Spanish reports, and it's crucial to know the routes for his army's advance into Portugal or to counter the enemy at the Guadiana. I prefer being on horseback scouting the land than walking the streets. Desmond joined Colonel Crofton's regiment, known for its valor in battles. Desmond informed the Colonel about the governor's shady dealings, but solid proof is lacking. There's a chance the governor fled to Portugal or surrendered to the troops there. The soldiers seemed unhappy and poorly fed. They won't likely support the governor against us.|"[""1.

Desmond's excitement was justified. As they journeyed into the valley of the Guadiana, they encountered a military officer bearing news that the governor and his family had abruptly departed, leaving no instructions. It was suspected they wouldn't return, having taken their belongings. The officer sought guidance, and Colonel Crofton, armed with royal authority, instructed the troops to prepare for his arrival. Upon reaching Badajos, they were met by the colonel and his officers. Colonel Crofton revealed his temporary governorship and the need for immediate action. The colonels were briefed on the situation, and Desmond was tasked with road assessments. He discovered discrepancies and reported back, leading to urgent repairs to ensure troop mobility.|"['1.

Desmond completed his survey of the roads in Spain and Portugal, identifying potential defensive positions. He then set out to explore the roads on the Portuguese side of the frontier, accompanied by Mike. Despite the enmity between the Spanish and Portuguese, they were prepared to face potential attacks from the peasants due to the ongoing conflict. Riding out for a week, they examined routes across the frontier, encountering no trouble from the locals who mistook them for English or Dutch officers. The roads were challenging, especially for armies with artillery and wagons. They learned about a pass from Elvas over the mountains, which they planned to investigate. As they continued their journey, they encountered a cavalry behind them but realized they were not being pursued.

""Captain Kennedy,"" the general continued, ""you probably have the results of your surveys along these roads. Kindly share them with me; it could be as valuable to me as it would have been to the Duke of Orleans, and save me much trouble.""

Desmond handed over his notebook with daily notes on road conditions and repair suggestions. He planned to take his reports to Madrid once completed.

""I've been on the road to Portalegre for eight days. I would have headed to Madrid if I hadn't heard about this mountain road by chance,"" Desmond explained.

The general turned out to be the Earl of Galway, which Desmond found fortunate. The cavalry squadron met them, and Mike joined the earl's escort without orders. Upon reaching Elvas, the general arranged for Desmond's accommodation.

""I couldn't see you yesterday as I was busy with the Governor. How did you become a captain so early?"" the general inquired. Desmond then shared his adventures, including rescuing Anne de Pointdexter.

The general considered his options carefully. He mentioned that sending the young officer to Lisbon as a prisoner would not benefit his government much, as the officer had not been caught in action. The general appreciated the officer's papers, which had saved him trouble. He decided to make an exception in this case and grant the officer his liberty to cross the frontier. The general acknowledged the challenges of dealing with allies like the Portuguese and the suspicions that could arise from releasing the officer. The officer was advised to withdraw his parole, and they set off towards Badajos. The general assured the officer that he would be strictly guarded but could share information that would not harm his friends. The group rode to a rise to view Badajos and the surrounding area. The general engaged the officer in conversation about the villages in the valley. As they moved forward for a better view, a sudden commotion caused the troopers to react swiftly. The general emphasized the importance of caution, considering the possibility of encountering Spanish forces.

Gentlemen, it seems that Desmond has escaped our grasp, and while I must admit that I am not entirely sorry, as he was a fine young man, it would have been a shame for him to spend the best years of his life in prison. The English officers shared knowing smiles, understanding the earl's true feelings. It was surprising that the earl did not confine Desmond after he withdrew his parole, instead taking him along on his reconnaissance mission. Desmond was not required to testify before the commission as the fraudulent contractors had fled, likely making a fortune. The earl hinted at the corruption in Spain and France, noting the challenges faced by those who strive for honesty. Desmond's journey to Madrid was uneventful, and upon his return, he presented his report to high praise. The Duke of Orleans unexpectedly departed, leaving Marshal de Bay in charge. The King of France was negotiating for peace, potentially altering the situation in Spain. Rumors of France withdrawing troops created tension in Madrid.

When the time finally arrived, I sneaked out of my hut an hour before the planned switch, moving silently until I spotted a sentry pacing between our huts and the soldiers'. Armed with makeshift ropes and a gag, I approached him carefully. Seizing his musket, I subdued him swiftly. Disguising myself in his gear, I managed to blend in with the relief squad. After marching out, I slipped away unnoticed, shedding my disguise and finding refuge at a nearby cottage.

Passing through the outposts with Desmond, they found the outposts carelessly guarded due to a recent victory. The Marquis de Bay planned to attack again, but Galway and Frontiera were well-prepared and held a strong position near Elvas. The heat intensified, and the forces withdrew across the frontier. Meanwhile, in Madrid, the French faced public outrage due to negotiations with France. The king assured the people of his commitment to Spain.

In 1710, Charles and his allies marched towards Madrid. General Stanhope's division reached Madrid without resistance, while Charles entered the city on September 28. France was alarmed by the defeat at Saragossa, sending the Duke of Vendome to command. Vendome quickly gathered troops and secured the bridge of Almarez to prevent the Portuguese from joining Charles. Despite urgent requests, the Portuguese army did not advance, leading to Stanhope's retreat from Madrid. A council of war decided to evacuate Madrid due to approaching French reinforcements. Stanhope's division faced the French at Brihuega, defending fiercely until surrendering due to ammunition exhaustion. The battle was inconclusive, with both sides claiming victory. Staremberg retreated to Barcelona, while Desmond and O'Neil navigated through the battles unscathed.|"[""1.

Mrs. Rooney shared with Desmond Kennedy that he was raised in Kilkargan by John O'Carroll, who claimed his name was Desmond Kennedy. Desmond learned that his true name was Desmond Kennedy, but John O'Carroll concealed his identity to protect his inheritance. Mrs. Rooney revealed that Desmond was baptized as Gerald O'Carroll, son of James and Elizabeth O'Carroll. Desmond decided to gather evidence from his father's former army officers to prove his lineage. Mrs. Rooney agreed to provide the baptism certificate and officer names.

Mike, you've helped me greatly. When you told me your sister was coming to clear up the mystery of my birth, I never imagined she'd provide proof of my heritage. I aim to prove I'm James O'Carroll's son, even if regaining the estates may be challenging due to my past in the Brigade. Lord Godolphin's support might help. But my true goal is to establish my Irish lineage. I plan to return to France, seeking officers who knew my father for evidence. Your sister's testimony is crucial, backed by Mrs. Callaghan's account. The officers' recognition of my likeness to my father would strengthen my case. The chain of evidence, from my baptism certificate to your sister's care for me, seems solid. Even if I lose the estate, proving my name's legacy matters most.|"[""1.

Mike's business in France was temporarily concluded. With a year's leave, he planned to visit surviving officers to seek their recognition. Mike contemplated legal action or seeking Lord Godolphin's support in England. He believed a notification from Godolphin supporting his claim could sway the judges in Dublin. Mike aimed to avoid tarnishing his uncle's reputation and sought his resignation. To travel back, he considered a sea passage to London, then by horse through Luxembourg or Switzerland towards France. A month later, they reached the duke's camp. Desmond, son of Major James O'Carroll, hoped for recognition from officers who knew his father. The duke acknowledged Desmond's resemblance to his father and offered support through written testimonials from officers.|"[""1.

The duke advised Gerald not to be satisfied with just one person's opinion. He suggested getting more people to confirm the likeness he bore to James O'Carroll. Gerald traveled to Spain and spoke with three Irish officers who all recognized the resemblance to James O'Carroll even before he mentioned his name. They recalled that James O'Carroll's wife had a son during the siege of Limerick, but the fate of the child was unknown. Gerald gathered signed documents from these officers. He continued his journey to London, where Lord Godolphin welcomed him. Over supper, Gerald shared his story and presented evidence of his true parentage. Lord Godolphin assured him of support and advised him to take legal action against his uncle, John O'Carroll, who had unjustly deprived him of his rights.|"[""1.

"""So it is, sir. So it is, sure enough, when one comes to think of it.

""That they certainly would not, Mike.

Three days later, Gerald received a message from Lord Godolphin, saying that he wished to see him; and, on going to his house, the minister handed to him the paper with the full pardon, and the confirmation of his ownership in his father's estates; together with a letter to the lord lieutenant, and the Lord Chief Justice Cox.

Gerald promptly wrote to his uncle, expressing his clear understanding of the situation and suggesting that it would be best if they did not meet. His uncle, John O'Carroll, then gathered the tenants and revealed the truth about Gerald's rightful ownership of Kilkargan.
