Polly quietly moved to Mrs. Whitney's side and sat down to observe Phronsie sleeping. Suddenly, Phronsie woke up feeling hungry and complained to Polly. They decided to clear a space on the table and all the children gathered around it. They started writing letters, and Phronsie's was placed in the center with care.

Polly instructed everyone to turn their backs to the road and whirl around when they heard the carriage approaching. Phronsie thought she heard a noise, but it was just a market wagon rushing by.

Van quickly abandoned the idea of going to the museum with his brother Ben and Percy. He was upset that they had left without telling him. Van tried to convince Joel to come and look for them, but Joel was calm and said they were too far away by now. Van described the museum to Joel, with old dead crabs, shells, bugs, stones, and even an old crocodile. Joel was overwhelmed by the description and sat down to think. They decided to seek help from their mother to find Ben and Percy. When they entered their mother's room, they found Polly, Ben, Percy, Davie, Phronsie, and little Dick all gathered around something important. Mrs. Pepper was mending nearby, looking at them with a calm expression. Joel proudly exclaimed that Ben could do anything better than the dog they saw in a picture.

Mr. King stood up, holding Phronsie, declaring the Pepper children's home. Polly faced a frustrating task with her clothing buttons that always seemed to disappear when needed. Mrs. Pepper insisted Polly fix them before doing anything else. Polly's impatience grew as the buttons kept popping off, causing her to toss her boot in frustration.
