Sue explained to her mother that the doll Bunny played with was old and had sawdust coming out when Bunny hit it with a stick. Meanwhile, Bunny pretended there was a fire, but it was just make-believe. As they played, Bunny's dog Splash accidentally spilled water on Uncle Tad's feet. Despite the mishap, Bunny was unharmed as he fell on soft grass. They decided to end the game, and Bunny's mother, dressed to go out, was unsure whether to laugh or scold. Bunny asked where she was going, and they talked about Wango, a monkey Mr. Winkler brought from his sea voyages. Bunny and Sue hoped to visit their grandpa's farm, as mentioned in the letter they received.|"[""1.

The hand-organ man chased his monkey, followed by Bunny Brown and his sister Sue. Wango, their dog, stayed behind. Miss Winkler, covered in flour, came out due to the noise. The monkey perched high in a tree, refusing to come down despite pleas. Spectators gathered as the organ was played, but the monkey remained aloof. Bunny suggested offering lollipops, which the Italian man accepted gratefully. The monkey descended for the treats and clung to his master, enjoying the candy. The Italian rewarded Bunny and Sue with pennies. Later, a large van arrived, intriguing Bunny and Sue as they peeked inside.|"['1.

Bunny Brown and his sister Sue were amazed by the unique, large automobile parked in their yard. Unlike the usual cars they had seen, this one had four small beds inside, resembling ship bunks. Excitedly, Bunny noticed an oil stove and pots and pans, realizing they might cook in this auto. As they explored further, they found a room with two windows, white curtains, cupboards, and a clock. The next room had four beds, two for Bunny and Sue, and two larger ones for their parents. Eager to learn more, Bunny's mother suggested they play while waiting for their father to explain the vehicle. With cookies in hand, Bunny and Sue played near a pond, catching tadpoles with a homemade net. Sue held a can as Bunny scooped the creatures, splashing some water on her dress.|['1.

Bunny and Sue had been catching frogs by the pond, but they soon grew tired of it. Looking around for something else to do, they spotted a clay-hill nearby. Sue put down her can of frogs, and Bunny set aside his net. They made their way to the top of the hill, which was slippery from the rain. Without much thought, they started sliding down the hill like Jack and Jill. The clay was so slick that they couldn't stop themselves, and with a big splash, they landed in the shallow pond at the bottom. Covered in mud, Sue tried to clean her face with a wet handkerchief, while Bunny helped her up. Together, they waded back to shore, leaving behind a muddy mess.|"['1.

Bunny and Sue bombarded their father with questions about the old moving van that he had transformed into a cozy Gypsy wagon for their summer vacation. Excitedly, Mr. Brown explained how he had the van converted into a small house on wheels with beds, a table, chairs, and an oil stove. The family planned to travel in it to their grandpa's farm instead of taking the train. With the bunks made up, lamps filled, and cupboards stocked with food, they set off on their adventure. Along the way, they could stop to buy more supplies. As they packed up, the children insisted on bringing their dog, Splash, along.

Mr. and Mrs. Brown, along with their children Bunny and Sue, embarked on a unique adventure in their special automobile that doubled as a home on wheels.

The children and older folks enjoyed a delightful dinner under the trees. Bunny claimed it was the best meal he ever had, and Sue and Bunker Blue agreed. After a brief rest, they continued their journey in the big automobile. Splash, their dog, also had his dinner of meat scraps and leftovers. As they traveled, many people passing by in cars or carriages admired their unique house-on-wheels. While Mrs. Brown and Bunker washed dishes, Bunny and Sue noticed smoke nearby. As they prepared for the night, with Mrs. Brown making beds and Mr. Brown checking the engine, Bunker explained the importance of keeping it cool. He fetched water to pour into the radiator. Mrs. Brown decided to go get fresh milk, leaving the children to explore the area near the stopped automobile. Bunny played with willow branches, pretending they were circus props.|['1.

Bunny and his sister Sue ventured into the woods, following the smoke from a fire. Ignoring warnings from adults, they stumbled upon a camp of Gypsies with colorful wagons and horses. Despite hearing stories of Gypsies taking children away, Bunny and Sue were curious and unafraid, explaining they were on their way to their grandpa's in a big automobile. Bunny shared that his grandpa had let Gypsies borrow his horses, but they never returned them, leaving his grandpa without horses. The children, intrigued by the camp and the horses, continued on their path, eager to learn more about the Gypsies and their way of life.|"['1.

"""We have some horses,"" he said, ""but they are not your grandfather's, little chap. But I think you had better run home, or run back to wherever your automobile is. Your mother may be looking for you.""

""I--I guess we can find it--thank you,"" said Bunny. He was not sure that he could, for it was almost dark now, and the Gypsy fire looked bright and cheerful. But Bunny did not want to walk along through the woods with the Gypsy woman. She might, after all, take him and his sister.

He kept on. He went more slowly, though, so Sue would not get tired. At first Bunny managed to keep to the path through the woods--the path that led from the main road, on which their automobile was standing. But, in a little while, Bunny found himself walking into a patch of bushes.

A dog did rush up to Bunny and Sue, but it was a good, friendly dog, and seemed very glad to see them. It jumped about Bunny, and, no sooner had the little boy put his hands on the shaggy back of the frisking animal, than Bunny cried out:

And, a little later, they were all safely at the big automobile. Bunny and Sue had some bread, with the milk their father and mother had bought at the farmhouse.

Mr. Brown led the cow away to keep her from bothering Bunker. After securing her to a fence, he returned to update Bunny, Sue, and their mother. Even Splash, the dog, eventually settled down. The family woke up to a bright morning. They washed up in the makeshift bedroom, and Mother Brown prepared breakfast on the oil stove while Daddy and Bunker set the table outside. The farmer reclaimed the cow, mentioning her nocturnal wanderings. They enjoyed a delicious breakfast under the willow tree. The family continued their journey, stopping near a village to avoid a potential storm. Bunny, familiar with horses, led one along the road, just like he did with Splash and the express wagon.

"The horse walked slowly as Bunny led it, with Splash following behind. Maybe Splash thought he was helping too, just like dogs drive sheep. ""Dogs can drive horses too, right?"" Mr. Brown disagreed, worried the horse might run off if tied to their auto. Instead, he secured the horse to the fence. The horse wasn't Grandpa's but belonged nearby. As they settled for the night, Bunker chose to sleep under the car in the rain. The next morning, they set off, hoping to find Grandpa's missing horses.

Grandpa Brown shared a story about the Gypsies camping nearby. They needed horses, so he lent them his best team. However, the Gypsies never returned the horses, leaving Grandpa and the police searching in vain. Meanwhile, Bunny and Sue, dressed in play clothes, explored the barn. They encountered a friendly brown horse and a mischievous old ram pulling Bunny's coat. The siblings then ventured into the field, where they learned about the animals' diet, enjoying the sweet grass that horses, sheep, and cows like.|"['1.

Back into the barn went Bunny and Sue, followed by the horse and ram eagerly munching on the grass they brought. Bunny and Sue ran out thrice to gather more grass for their animal friends. Each time Bunny fed the horse, the ram tugged at his coat. Initially, the children didn't understand why they couldn't play with the intriguing little boxes resembling dollhouses. Sue even planned to fetch her dolls from the farmhouse. The hired man swiftly intervened, carrying Bunny and Sue away from the boxes to avoid the bees. He explained that smoking the bees calms them, ensuring they don't sting. Grandpa Brown apologized for forgetting to warn the children about the bees.

Grandma Brown would carefully thread strawberries onto grass stems like glass beads on a string. Bunny and Sue enjoyed sitting in the shade, pulling off and eating the strawberries sprinkled with sugar and covered in rich, yellow cream. After playing by the brook, Bunny suggested building a mud and stone wall across it to create a waterfall. They built a high wall that formed a pond, using it to float sticks and bark as boats. Bunny wished for a real boat or a raft like Robinson Crusoe's. Despite not having fishing gear, they imagined ways to have fun by the water.|['1.

"Sue scanned the stream's bank until she spotted a lengthy, slender branch fallen from a nearby tree. She extended one end to her brother, who grasped it. ""You're a mess!""

Bunny encountered a large, angry turkey approaching his sister Sue. Without hesitation, Bunny grabbed a tin pail they had planned to fill with strawberries and hurled it at the turkey. Surprisingly, the pail landed over the turkey's head, blocking its view of Sue's red dress. Confused and unable to see, the turkey danced around in frustration. Eventually, the turkey managed to remove the pail, allowing Bunny and Sue to safely reach their friends. Later, as they passed by the field, the turkey was nowhere to be found. Perhaps the turkey had retired for the night, as it was time for chickens to roost.

Bunny and Sue had a fun day picking berries on the hill their grandpa mentioned. They filled their pail with strawberries and then found some bushes with purple raspberries. Excitedly, Bunny suggested they pick the raspberries for grandma to make jam and tarts. As they ventured closer to the woods, they spotted a big frog hopping around. Following the frog, they ended up chasing it to another spring where it splashed in with a grunt. Despite being tired and hungry, Bunny remembered his responsibility to look after Sue. As the sun began to set, they continued their adventure, with Sue asking if she needed to wash her hands stained from the berries.

Bunny Brown and his sister Sue found themselves lost in the woods, unsure of the way home. Though they had been lost before, this time was no different in terms of fear. They wandered through paths made by animals and people, but no one was around to guide them. All they heard were echoes of their own voices, bouncing back like a ball. As they continued, unsure of their direction, Sue began to feel scared. Bunny tried to reassure her, and they rested on a log. Bunny shouted, hoping for help. Eventually, they encountered a hermit who offered them food and promised to take them home before dark. Bunny and Sue were relieved and enjoyed a meal in the hermit's cabin.|['1.

Grandpa shared a tale with Sue and Bunny about missing horses and a mysterious encounter with Gypsies. Sue added a funny incident involving a cow tickling Bunker Blue. The old man living in the woods mentioned seeing Gypsies in the valley, hinting they might have the horses. Sue suggested Bunny could play Robinson Crusoe with the hermit as Mr. Friday. The hermit, touched by the children's imagination, offered to take them on his back. Bunny thought he saw tears in the hermit's eyes, but it might have been raindrops as storm clouds gathered. The hermit hinted that the Gypsies might have the missing horses, urging the children to inform their grandfather.|"['1.

Sue, feeling drowsy, snuggled against the hermit's shoulder, praising his piggy-back ride skills. Curious, she asked if he ever carried his daughter like this. The hermit, pointing to the sky, mentioned she was up there, causing Bunny to notice tears in his eyes. As rain began to fall, the hermit suggested they head back to his house. Despite the storm, they found shelter under the trees. Sue, exhausted, was comforted by the hermit's words about the thunder and lightning. Once at the cabin, the hermit assured Sue's safety while he went to get her umbrella. The stormy night continued, but Sue felt secure in the hermit's care.|"[""1.

Bunny and Sue were too tired to play after the storm. Sue noticed a cozy bed in the corner of the room. Bunny snuggled up in a chair, imagining he was a soldier on guard. The rain drummed on the cabin roof, and Bunny pretended it was a circus wagon rumbling by. Suddenly, their dog Splash bounded in, wet from the rain, but full of joy. Bunny and Sue were thrilled to see Splash, despite getting wet from his coat. Grandpa Brown held Sue, and Papa Brown carried Bunny. Splash happily settled on the rug, ready to rest. The family thanked the hermit for sheltering them during the storm. They all left the cabin, with Splash trotting alongside, to head back to their carriage in the gentle rain.|"['1.

The family grew anxious when Bunny and Sue didn't return from berry picking. As supper time passed with no sign of them, a search party formed, including Grandpa Brown, hired men, Mr. and Mrs. Brown, Grandma Brown, and even Bunker Blue. Grandpa Brown hitched a horse to a carriage, and with Papa Brown and the hermit, they set off to the cabin. Meanwhile, Splash found Bunny and Sue. When Papa and Grandpa Brown arrived, the adventure ended happily. The hermit, Mr. Wright, cared for the children well. Later, Mr. Wright showed Grandpa Brown the valley where Gypsies had camped.

It was a beautiful day for a picnic. The sun shone brightly in the blue sky, and a cool wind made it pleasant. Bunny and Sue, all washed and dressed, were excited for the adventure. They wore play clothes, ready to explore and have fun in the woods. Grandpa Brown arrived with a wagon, seating Bunny, Sue, and their family. On the way to the picnic, they passed other families heading to the Sunday-school gathering. Upon arrival at a grove near a lake, the adults settled while the children played. Bunny and Sue enjoyed swings, tossed sticks in the lake, and explored the woods. Sue kindly shared her doll, and they found a cozy spot to play, reminiscent of their Robinson Crusoe adventures.|"['1.

During lunchtime at the picnic, Bunny and Sue decided to share their meal with other children. Sue wanted to be with her friend Ethel, while Bunny had made a new friend named John. Suddenly, two rough-looking men emerged from the bushes and tried to grab the children's lunch baskets. John bravely held onto his basket, but when he tripped and fell, his lunch spilled out. The smaller tramp started eating from the basket, causing some of the children to cry in fear. Bunny tried to scare the tramps away by pretending his dog was nearby, as his father had told him tramps are scared of dogs. The tramps quickly took the remaining food from the dropped baskets and mixed it all together. In the end, Bunny explained his plan was just make-believe to protect his friends.|"[""1.

The picnic was coming to an end. The children had eaten their fill, Bunny and Sue especially. Some of the kids' baskets were emptied by tramps. As the day waned, the adults still had treats left, sharing with those who were still hungry. A boy named Sammie fell into a pond but was quickly rescued. He only got wet and cried a bit. Everyone had a great time at the picnic, wishing there could be one every day. Later, it was discovered that someone had broken in and taken food from the pantry while the family was out.

Grandma Brown noticed the missing cake, pies, and crullers from the pantry. They found a red handkerchief outside, possibly dropped by the tramps who scared the children. Papa Brown suspected the same tramps took the treats. The hired man saw nothing suspicious. Grandpa Brown worried the tramps might be hiding in the barn. Bunny and Sue enjoyed rainy days at the farm, playing in the attic with sleigh bells and a spinning wheel.

Bunny and Sue were playing outside when they encountered the old gray hen. It was a challenge to move their ball away from her without getting pecked. Grandma Brown explained that the hen was sitting on her hidden nest under the currant bush. With Grandma's help, they retrieved the ball and discovered eggs under the hen's wing. The next day, eleven fluffy chicks hatched. Bunny and Sue were delighted. Meanwhile, they discussed the upcoming circus.

Bunny and Sue were determined to go to the circus, but they faced a challenge - they had no money for tickets. Bunny suggested trading pins, but they needed a lot. They planned to collect unwanted pins from grandma's house. Bunny knew they had to carry water for the animals to earn tickets. Despite the obstacles, they were set on going. They kept their plan a secret from their family, fearing they would be stopped. The day before the circus, they prepared a lunch and set off early the next morning.

"""That's right,"" Bunny said slowly, realizing he hadn't considered that before. Standing on the road, he gazed back at grandpa's house. At that moment, there were no wagons or carriages in sight, but Bunny noticed a small cloud of dust approaching. It sped closer and closer until he heard a bark. Bunny hadn't expected Splash to come; they had left without him that morning to avoid questions from Mother Brown. However, Splash had found them anyway, barking happily and eager to be with the children. As the man in the wagon announced they had reached the circus grounds, Bunny and Sue were instructed to walk straight ahead. The man bid them farewell and drove off as Splash leaped out.

As Bunny and Sue observed, two unfamiliar men approached who seemed out of place in the circus setting. The men sported gold earrings and had dark complexions. Their attire included coats adorned with silver buttons and red sashes around their waists. Each man led a horse that differed from the circus horses. Bunny excitedly speculated that these might be their grandfather's missing horses taken by Gypsies. The children closely scrutinized the men, identifying them as Gypsies due to their distinct appearance. The Gypsies conversed with circus staff, indicating the horses multiple times. Bunny and Sue suspected the men intended to sell or train the horses for circus performances.|"['1.

A colorful parade passed by, with elephants, camels, and horses carrying people in sparkling clothes. The children, Bunny and Sue, watched in awe. They enjoyed peanuts and pink lemonade, planning to share everything. Mrs. Kendall found them and kindly explained that their family was worried, offering to take them back home. They felt a mix of emotions but were comforted. Riding back with Splash, they left the circus behind, returning to Grandpa Brown's farm. Surprised by their adventure, Grandpa Brown chuckled at their circus escapade.|"['1.

"""I don't know anything about it,"" was the answer. ""My wife and I went to the circus, and when we were standing around, waiting for the show to begin, we saw these tots there. They were all alone, so we knew something must be wrong. They told us they'd run away, and we brought them back. But I didn't see your horses, though I did see two Gypsy men hanging around one of the tents.""

Bunny and Sue were glad to hear this. Grandpa Brown rode off with Mr. and Mrs. Kendall; and Bunny and Sue were given a good dinner and put to sleep that afternoon, for they were tired, sleepy and hungry.

It was late in the afternoon when Bunny and Sue awoke. They went out on the porch, and the first thing they saw was Grandpa Brown coming down the road, riding on one horse and leading another which trotted by the side of the first.

""The Gypsy man, who borrowed my team, just before you folks came to the farm,"" grandpa said to Bunny, Sue and Mother Brown, ""that Gypsy man really meant to bring my horses back, when he got through with them, but he was taken ill. Then some of the bad Gypsies in the tribe ran away with the team--they took them far off and kept them."""|"['1.
