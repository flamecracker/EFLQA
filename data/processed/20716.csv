In Pleasant Valley, Mr. Crow wasn't the oldest resident. Another elderly creature, Timothy Turtle, had spent more time under Blue Mountain's shadow. Timothy Turtle preferred the muddy bottom of Black Creek, rarely seen by others. Unlike Mr. Crow's aerial jaunts, Timothy Turtle waddled or crawled near the creek. In the water, though, he was a swift swimmer with webbed feet. Mr. Crow often grumbled about Timothy, wishing he would stay submerged. Mr. Crow disliked Timothy's grumpiness, contrasting it with his own pleasant demeanor. Timothy Turtle's habit of snapping his long neck and biting anyone quickly earned him a reputation for being unfriendly. Despite his age, he was swift and unwilling to release his grip once he caught someone.|"[""1.

Timothy Turtle enjoyed a mischievous game of biting unsuspecting passersby, finding it more fun than anything else. Living by Black Creek suited him well as he loved fishing and could easily find his meals. However, his neighbors, especially the mother birds, warned their young ones to be cautious of him.

Timothy Turtle claimed he was often misunderstood, insisting he was truly kind-hearted. To prove his helpfulness, he offered to meet at the bluff to teach flying. He swiftly reached the bluff by swimming down Black Creek. Unaware of Mr. Crow's hidden friends, Timothy met him at the pine stump. Mr. Crow was eager for the fun to begin with Timothy's leap off the cliff. Despite delays, Timothy finally took the leap, prompting loud cheers from Mr. Crow and his friends.

Old Mr. Crow coughed and winked at his friends. He explained that the trouble was losing balance and landing upside down in the creek, unable to fly in that position. It's called 'turning turtle,' he added. Timothy Turtle, known to be in Black Creek in Pleasant Valley, sometimes went on excursions for pleasure. Despite his grumpy demeanor and lack of work ethic, Timothy Turtle decided to stay with the Beaver colony for a week. The Beavers were not pleased with his company, as they were busy and hardworking creatures.

Once, a young beaver named Brownie overheard the commotion caused by Timothy Turtle. He felt it was unfair that someone couldn't make Timothy behave. Brownie believed that Timothy was old enough to know better. Timothy's visits were always unpleasant, leaving the villagers wishing he had never come. The rude remarks hurt the Beaver family deeply. When Timothy grabbed Brownie's mother's tail, refusing to let go until sunset, it was the last straw. Brownie decided to make Timothy work as punishment.

Timothy Turtle was working hard all day, plugging a hole in the dam with his flat body. However, he didn't realize what he was doing. Brownie Beaver noticed and pointed out Timothy's efforts to the other workers, who then asked Timothy to move aside so they could fill the hole with mud. Timothy felt ashamed and sank into the pond to sulk for the rest of the week. The villagers criticized Timothy for his rude behavior and lack of manners. Despite his hard shell, Timothy didn't like being disturbed and had a reputation for grabbing boys' toes in the water. Even though the boys still swam in the creek, Farmer Green wished his son Johnnie would spend more time working in the hayfield than playing around the creek. Johnnie even joked about carving his initials on Timothy's shell.|"['1.

"When you grow up, you'll have more responsibilities than catching snapping turtles. This afternoon, you can carve your initials on the hay-rake and play with it in the big meadow,"" Johnnie's father suggested. Initially disappointed about missing a visit to the creek, Johnnie set off the next morning with pockets full of cherries. However, when he arrived at the creek, he discovered Timothy Turtle sunbathing on the sand. Though tempted to carve his initials on the turtle's shell, Johnnie hesitated, realizing the turtle's fierce appearance up close.

Johnnie made sure Timothy Turtle couldn't move and left him on his back. Mr. Crow overheard Timothy's remarks and was surprised by what he said about Johnnie Green.

Timothy Turtle asked Peter Mink for a place to spend the night, as he was wet and tired. Peter welcomed him into a cozy nook beneath a rock near the water. They sat down, and Peter showed Timothy an Almanac. Peter explained a unique way of reading the book, even standing on one's head. Timothy shared that Farmer Green was ploughing his cornfield, but it didn't interest him much. Peter read advice from the Almanac about offering a good supper and bed to guests. While eating, Timothy thought Peter was disagreeable, not knowing Peter felt the same. Timothy Turtle enjoyed fishing and once caught seven fish, annoyed when Johnnie Green fished in his favorite pool. Peter suggested Timothy speak to Farmer Green for food.|"['1.

Timothy Turtle was eager to help Farmer Green, suggesting a letter be written and signed by everyone to communicate. He rushed back to the creek to count the fish Johnnie Green caught, intending to include the number in the letter.
