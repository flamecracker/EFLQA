No one noticed the small boy, sitting alone by the lake, his gaze intense and a bit wild. If his scout uniform fit better, he might not have seemed so forlorn. Scouts often seek solitude in nature. Suddenly, the boy's attention shifted to something at his feet. He knelt down excitedly but found nothing, just knelt there, thrilled. He rushed off, fearing his discovery might vanish. In his cabin, he rummaged through a suitcase and found an old scout handbook, flipping to page thirty. Breathing heavily, hands trembling, he was lost in the book. At the same time, Tom Slade, done with his tasks, wandered into the woods, lost in thought. He reflected on his journey from a mischievous boy to a respected scout leader, finding solace in nature. His true reward was the lasting impact of scouting on his character.|"['1.

Tom Slade, a seasoned scout, stood surveying the camp with a look of accomplishment. His face, the color of a mulatto, showed no hint of fatigue. He sported no hat, his sleeves rolled up, revealing no merit badges. Clad in a pongee shirt and khaki trousers held by a unique braided belt, he exuded a sense of readiness. As he pondered the scene, a fellow scout named Willetts approached, seeking advice on scouting. Willetts, a lively Eagle Scout from Massachusetts, shared his eagerness for adventure and camaraderie. Tom, initially taken aback by the sudden company, soon embraced Willetts' enthusiasm and welcomed his presence on their exploration. Together, they embarked on a journey through the camp, united by their shared love for scouting and the thrill of the unknown.|"[""1.

Hervey Willetts complimented Tom, saying he must know all the routes around. Hervey thought Tom would make a good guide, philosopher, and friend. Tom was puzzled by the phrase and explained it's a moral guide concept from Shakespeare. Hervey then shared his troubles about merit badges, feeling he messed up his Eagle award pursuit.

They chose me for the Eagle award. I began with seven badges - camping, cooking, athletics, pioneering, angling, carpentry, and bugling.

Pioneering, pathfinding, athletics, angling, bugling, carpentry, conservation, cycling, firemanship, music, seamanship, and signaling were his choices. He aimed to be an Eagle Scout by Saturday.

Two friends took a leisurely walk until they reached the sparse woods near a mighty mountain. The dying sun's last rays illuminated the rocks and sparse vegetation, highlighting the dark ascent ahead. Stories of hermits, bears, and mysterious men lurking in the mountain's wilderness intrigued campers. A glint of light on a rock high above the campfire sparked tales of a draft dodger trapped on the mountain. As the sun set, a bird circled above, then swooped down. Hervey noticed a small bird's nest swaying on a branch. Suddenly, the large bird descended towards the nest. Hervey realized the danger and Tom watched in awe as Hervey swiftly climbed the tree to protect the nest from the predator.|"[""1.

Every second drew the scout closer to the hanging nest. Climbing up with lightning agility, he straddled bending limbs and swung himself between branches. Tom Slade, spellbound, watched as his companion ascended fearlessly, taking risks on slender branches. Despite wanting to warn him, Tom trusted Hervey's daring nature. The mighty bird of prey advanced towards the nest, causing it to sway dangerously. As the branch bent under the bird's weight, a splitting sound filled the air. Hervey swung just in time to avoid crashing down. Seizing an opportunity, he reached for the branch above, outwitting the eagle. With daring recklessness, Hervey's risky move paid off, using the eagle's weight against itself.|"[""1.

In a thrilling moment, Tom Slade heard a terrifying sound as a branch split. Besides the nest, a boy dangled from the deserted branch. He clung to the swaying nest, trusting it. The nest moved in a sweeping curve, with a small olive-colored head peeking out curiously. The boy cautiously moved along the limb to support the weight. The little creature in the nest seemed unfazed by the upheaval around. The boy calculated how to cut the branch near the nest without disturbing its occupant. He bound his handkerchief around the nest's opening and cut the branch carefully to move the nest to safety. The delicate operation required balance and precision to ensure the nest's security.|"['1.

"As Tom descended closer, he heard the cheerful voice more clearly. ""Moving a house and family isn't easy. I have to be careful. Oh, boy, coming down! This tree is tied like a sailor's knot."" Hervey called back happily, ""I'm moving the bird and the whole block he lived in. I'm relocating the neighborhood. He's moving to a better area—very stylish. He's moving up in the world—well, down.

If I fell now, it wouldn't be a long drop."" And soon, his neat, agile figure stood on the lowest strong branch, balancing with one hand on the trunk. His khaki jacket was torn, his sleeve ripped, and a bloody scratch showed through a tear in his stocking. In his other hand, he held the branch with the nest, keeping it safe.

"Tom attempted once more to engage the savior in the fate of the small companion, confined within its snug abode, being escorted back to the base. He struggled to grasp how someone who had just executed a daring feat like Hervey had, with such care and compassion, could swiftly forget his actions and show little interest in the bird saved by his bold bravery. That was Hervey Willetts in a nutshell – his heart followed where action led. Once the action ceased, so did his interest.

Hervey, determined and impatient, scoured the ground for elusive marks. Finally, he spotted animal tracks leading towards a field. Following them, he discovered a trampled grass belt under a rail fence. Climbing a tree, he located the trail continuing into the sparse woods.

Frustrated by the need for patience, he pushed forward, planning to mark his progress with a stake and navy blue scarf.

Looking back, the mountain base seemed close, but the journey was short. The tracker found tracks on damp ground, leading to Skinny McCord, the camp's mascot. Skinny was alone, looking small in the woods. He tracked to earn a badge, wanting a trail named after him. Hervey, near winning an Eagle Scout badge, thought of the eagle he scared off.

Hervey admired Tom Slade but also stood in awe of him. He thought to himself that even though he didn't win the award as Tom predicted, he still outsmarted him. Hervey considered it a triumph to outsmart Tom, realizing that Tom isn't always right.

Hervey, who wasn't too involved in scouting before, watched as Skinny diligently followed the tracks to meet the requirements. Hervey congratulated Skinny on becoming a second-class scout, not mentioning that Skinny had followed the tracks backward.

"""Maybe he doesn't know what you're talking about,"" one of his patrol, the Panthers, suggested. This was intended as a sarcastic reference to Hervey's way of losing interest in his undertakings before they were completed. ""Hervey,"" he finally said, ""the boys think it's too bad that you should fall down just at the last minute. After all you've accomplished, it seems like--what shall I say--like Columbus turning back just before land was sighted.""

""Now, Hervey, my boy,"" said Mr. Warren, ""I don't want you to be angry at what I say, but the boys are disgruntled and I think you can't blame them. They set their hearts on having the Eagle award in the troop and they elected you to bring it to them. I was the first to suggest you.

You won twenty badges with flying colors, I don't know how you did it, and now you're falling down all on account of one single requirement.

Is that fair to the troop, Hervey? Is it fair to yourself? It isn't lack of ability; if it was I wouldn't speak of it. But it's because you tire of a thing before it's finished.

The thrilling article about the disappearance of little Anthony Harrington, Jr., captivated everyone at camp. The search for the missing child involved scouring every inch of the estate, dragging ponds, and exploring old wells, yet the child seemed to have vanished into thin air. Scouts from Temple Camp in Catskill Landing were intrigued by the mysterious case. A group of scouts even ventured to Catskill to investigate, but their sleuthing efforts only led them to ice cream sodas. The scouts speculated about the possible escape routes of the kidnappers, with imaginative theories ranging from airplanes to cabin cruisers. Despite the excitement, the scouts were not keen on the idea of a ransom for the child's return. While Skinny's tracking skills led them in the wrong direction, Tom Slade, known as Sherlock Nobody Holmes, had a different adventure awaiting him.|"[""1.

As Tom sat on a log, pondering the mysterious animal tracks he and Skinny had come across, his thoughts wandered to another scout who had once been in those woods. This scout, known for his adventurous spirit and carefree nature, had left an impression on Tom. Skinny, excited about the encounter with the other scout, pointed out the log where they had spoken. Tom, more observant than his companions, noticed something intriguing about the tracks near the log. Despite the small size of the creature that had passed by, there were no traces of it climbing over the log, puzzling Tom.

Tom carefully examined the animal tracks near the log, noticing the clear prints due to the mud's crust. Under the animal's path, he discovered strange markings that seemed out of place. The prints were distinct, resembling writing in the mud. Puzzled, Tom speculated that either someone without feet or a writing animal had left the marks. Despite the mystery, Tom focused on his duties as the season closed, prioritizing the camp's talk about a kidnapping. He dismissed the odd discovery, attributing it to another scout's initials. The newspapers detailed the kidnapping, with various sightings reported. Tom pondered the strange discovery under a tree that night but decided to focus on camp tasks the next day.

During a summer day at Black Lake, Pee-wee Harris from the Elk Patrol of the First Bridgeboro Troop showed off his diving skills, attracting attention with a splash. As he emerged from the water, he discovered a turtle. Despite attempts to coax the turtle out of its shell, it remained motionless and unresponsive. Scouts gathered around, trying various tactics to engage the turtle, but it remained unfazed. Even Scouty, the camp dog, couldn't entice the turtle. Eventually, most scouts grew tired and left, except for Westy Martin, known for his patience. However, even he couldn't outlast the turtle's stubbornness.

Tom observed a turtle he named Llewellyn. Sitting on a rock, he noticed initials on the turtle's shell, sparking memories of carved initials at camp. Thinking about the initials H. T. and T. H., Tom realized they were connected to campers. As the turtle headed for the lake, Tom remembered a fact about turtles seeking water. Tom then realized the turtle's tracks matched those followed by others. Acting on impulse, he prevented the turtle from reaching the water, causing it to flip over, revealing the initials H.

The letters T. H. on the creature's back were reversed when it fell upside down. Tom realized that the same thing had happened at the log in the woods. Teddy Howell and Harry Thorne were innocent. The creature had come down from the mountain to its destination. Tom wondered who T. H. was. His thoughts drifted to Orestes, who lived near where the creature came from. This made Tom think of Hervey Willetts. As Tom gazed at the mountain, he felt its solemnity. The creature had brought a clue. Tom wondered if he could match the creature's determination.

Tom instructed Llewellyn and Orestes to climb the tree quietly and examine a red streak without disturbing a bird's nest. He emphasized the importance of finding clues without calling out. Llewellyn ascended skillfully, barely making a sound. After a brief moment, he descended and described the material as similar to worsted. Tom speculated that the bright red streak was recently placed in the nest, possibly within a couple of days. He compared the situation to sailing up the Hudson River, where trails are visible from above. Tom suggested that the kidnappers, not experienced woodsmen, likely took an easy path up the mountain.

Despite no visible trails, faint lines on the mountain were discernible from afar, appearing like fleeting shadows. Tom, a thoughtful scout, deduced that following a road from Catskill would lead them to the mountain's less steep side. As they hiked, they carefully searched for any signs of a trail, occasionally venturing into thickets only to find dead ends. Tom's resourcefulness shone as he used willow bark and shavings to track the kidnappers.

The mountain they climbed was less steep than the side facing the camp, with occasional thickets along the overgrown path.

Tom, in silent moccasins, led Hervey stealthily down the thicket, revealing a glint of red, little Anthony Harrington. Tom proposed a daring rescue plan, warning Hervey of the risks. Hervey, eager to prove his bravery, agreed without hesitation.|"['1.

Tom paused, holding the brush open, peering thoughtfully and intently. He resembled a scout in a picture. Hervey waited anxiously behind him, unable to stand there if Tom wasn't in front.
