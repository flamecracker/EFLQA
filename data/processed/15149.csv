""Shall we move on to your second topic, Miss Martineau?"" Primrose continued. ""I value your wisdom and financial acumen. You inquire about our plans--well, honestly, we don't have any, do we, Jasmine?""

""My dear,"" she said, ""let's set aside the first issue and focus on the second. Primrose, when planning, the first consideration is how you'll sustain yourselves.""

Miss Martineau's serious expressions, Mr. Danesfield's strong advice to enjoy their time at Shortlands, and Mrs. Ellsworthy's distressed face about their financial struggles deeply affected Primrose. Riding home in the Ellsworthys' fancy carriage, she felt somber, not engaging in Jasmine's talk or Daisy's excitement over a new puppy. Back home, chaos ensued as the new pet met the family cat. While the girls sorted out the commotion, Primrose worried about their finances. She realized their yearly expenses exceeded their income of thirty pounds. Pondering over cutting costs by possibly moving to a cheaper home or letting go of their maid, Hannah, she felt anxious. Primrose's concern led her to seek advice from Mr. Danesfield at the bank the next day, despite his initial annoyance at her visit.|"[""1.

Poppy, with a sense of humble pride, shared her exciting news with Primrose. She revealed that her aunt runs a boarding house for ladies only and has offered her a position to assist the guests. This opportunity thrilled Poppy, who saw it as a dazzling prospect. Jasmine, caught up in the excitement, expressed her wish to visit London too. She eagerly suggested places for Poppy to explore, starting with Westminster Abbey to enrich her mind. Primrose added that Poppy must also visit the Houses of Parliament and the Tower for a solemn experience. Poppy, while intrigued by the idea of monkeys at the zoo, also looked forward to admiring fashionable shop windows. Despite her mother's warnings about the temptations of London, Poppy found the idea of her aunt's boarding house and the city's elegance truly dazzling. Jasmine, envious of Poppy's upcoming adventures, dreamt of praying with her friends in the Abbey.

A stream of words flowed quickly and clearly, surprising the girls. They feared losing Mrs. Ellsworthy's friendship but were delighted by her kind offer. Innocent Primrose didn't realize that a pound a week for three people was unusually cheap. Mrs. Ellsworthy had written to her friend, Mrs. Moore, asking her to provide the girls with a home, comfort, and even luxury, with Mrs. Ellsworthy covering the costs. Despite the excitement, Primrose stood firm on their plan. Daisy and Jasmine also wanted to accept Mrs. Ellsworthy's offer, but Primrose's determination prevailed. Miss Martineau suggested Shepherd's Bush as the place for them to live within their means, arranging for her friend to assist them. She emphasized the importance of following certain rules in London.

Miss Martineau had talked herself out of breath, trying to convince the girls to stay near Constantia Warren. She discussed with Mrs. Ellsworthy how Primrose, Jasmine, and Daisy wanted to have their own way without being indebted to anyone. Despite feeling sorry for hurting their friends, the girls were determined to go to London to carry out their plans. They decided to stay at Penelope Mansion for a few days to finalize their arrangements. Poppy Jenkins, who was feeling lonely in her new place, was delighted to receive a letter from Primrose inviting her to visit them in London. Poppy expressed her eagerness to see the girls and mentioned the busy and noisy surroundings of Penelope Mansion. The girls, upon reading Poppy's letter, were inspired to uplift her spirits by planning a visit to London. Jasmine encouraged her sisters to approach the trip with determination and conquer the city.

The last time in the quaint old garden, the final glance at Jasmine's flowers, the farewell to the room where her mother passed, and to the cottage where Daisy was born, the parting hug from Hannah who vowed to join them in London, and the girls left Woodbine Cottage. Despite their stubbornness, friends saw them off at the station. Miss Martineau, looking stern yet holding back tears, Mrs. Jenkins with gifts, and a boy Jasmine helped bid goodbye. Mr. Danesfield rushed to give Primrose an envelope. Mrs. Ellsworthy arrived last, with a basket of treats and tears in her eyes. Jasmine's excitement faded at Penelope Mansion, where Mrs. Flint greeted them formally. Jasmine found the atmosphere stifling, but Mrs. Flint led them to join the others for tea.

When Primrose approached Mr. Danesfield to withdraw their savings from his bank, he surprisingly raised few objections. Among all their acquaintances, he was the least resistant to Primrose's plan. This made her more inclined to heed his advice over Mrs. Ellsworthy or Miss Martineau. Mr. Danesfield acknowledged their unique and independent situation, where the sisters, though young, were in complete control of their finances. He advised Primrose to limit their annual spending to no more than seventy pounds. To ensure their safety and financial stability, he proposed sending them quarterly allowances rather than a lump sum. Despite Primrose's desire for independence and seclusion from their friends, Mr. Danesfield suggested using their address solely for sending money discreetly. He also shared an encounter he had with the Ellsworthy girls, particularly noticing the second girl's emotional display at St. Paul's Cathedral, which led to an unexpected connection between them.|"['1.

Primrose reassured Jasmine that Daisy was not as fragile as she appeared. They remembered their resolution to stay positive and not give in to tears. Daisy, concerned about her pet, the Pink, requested milk for her. She shared a dream of a prince finding them. Jasmine mentioned writing a melancholic poem titled 'The Uses of Adversity.' Primrose found some periodicals, like _The Watch_, too morbid, and Jasmine shared a worse one called _The Downfall_. They debated submitting Jasmine's poem to this magazine.|"['1.

Jasmine admired Primrose's ability to manage money wisely. Primrose had always been skilled at making the most of every shilling. However, when they moved to London and encountered Mrs. Dove, their landlady, things took a dishonest turn. Mrs. Dove, while not admitting to stealing outright, found ways to take advantage of the girls. She would use their resources without permission, manipulate accounts, and borrow money without returning it promptly. Primrose, who had been entrusted with the family's finances, found herself in a challenging situation.

Mrs. Dove, despite considering herself honest, had a husband who was not. He took Primrose's five-pound note from her trunk. When the girls discovered the theft, Mr. Dove pretended to help them and even offered a loan. Primrose, nearing Christmas with little money, held on to a letter from Mr. Danesfield, hoping to return it unopened. Jasmine struggled more with their situation, being of a delicate nature. Daisy, the youngest, remained resilient despite her declining health. The girls received their quarterly allowance from Mr. Danesfield, celebrating with a special breakfast.

The young ladies had differing opinions from the experienced women. Mrs. Dove felt the attic girls were ungrateful. She considered asking them to leave. However, Dove thought the girls were excited about the letter due to possible money. The girls received their allowance and were happy. Jasmine decided to start writing a novel. She was determined to prove herself and show her talent. She wanted to escape into her writing and forget their struggles. Despite their situation, they found joy in their pursuits. Primrose received orders for her china-painting, lifting their spirits. Christmas was pleasant, but Daisy fell ill, and Miss Egerton was away.|"[""1.

Jasmine comforted her sister Daisy, promising to return quickly. Daisy, feeling unwell and alone in the attic, wished for company. Unexpectedly, Tommy Dove, a boy she usually disliked, appeared. He demanded Daisy to reveal what she had seen, suspecting her of deceit. Frightened, Daisy denied seeing anything, explaining she was trying to sleep due to her cold. Dove persisted, warning her about lies. Daisy, feeling scared, insisted she had seen nothing and mistook him for Jasmine.

""I prefer some kinds,"" replied Daisy, a very choosy child, hesitating at the sticky sweets offered by Dove. ""I enjoy the best chocolate creams; Primrose brings them sometimes, but they are costly. Oh, and I also like sticky sweets,"" she added, noticing Dove's frown. ""Thank you, Mr. Dove."" With effort, she reached out to take a sweet.

Jasmine was puzzled by Hannah's constant muttering about their resemblance to someone. Daisy, however, confidently pointed out that Jasmine bore a striking resemblance to her dear Prince. Hannah, with her old-fashioned views, surprised the girls by suggesting they wear white instead of black to Mrs. Ellsworthy's. The girls, looking charming, were warmly welcomed by Mrs. Ellsworthy, who revealed a change in plans. They were to walk to a nearby cottage-like house for a gathering. The small house had a lovely garden and was adorned with roses. Noel, looking a bit nervous, greeted them and explained that it was his home. Poppy, the maid, led the girls to a beautifully prepared room with three of everything, making it the most delightful and comfortable space they had ever seen.|"[""1.
