"""I won't go any farther with you,"" he said, and there was something in his manner of speaking that made them see again in imagination the tired slump of his shoulders, the wild, haunted look in his eyes. ""I don't like the road. But you can find it easily from here. Then turn to your right. Three Towers is hardly half a mile up the road. Good night.""

He turned with abruptness and started back the way they had come. But impulsively Billie ran to him, calling to him to stop. Yet when he did stop and turned to look at her she had not the slightest idea in the world what she had intended to say--if indeed she had really intended to say anything.

After that it did not take the girls long to reach the road. They felt, someway, as if they must have dreamed their adventure, it had all been so strange and unreal. And yet they knew they had never been more awake in their lives.

For once the others were willing to do as the most timid of the trio wished, and they hurried along in silence till they saw, with hearts full of thankfulness, the lights of Three Towers Hall shine out on the road before them."|"[""1.

After a hearty meal, the girls headed to their dorms, changed into cozy nightgowns, and gathered to share their adventure stories.

Billie and Teddy walked together, but Teddy seemed gloomy despite Billie's mischievous laughter. As they neared her house, Teddy kept walking past the corner. Billie teased him, asking where he was off to. Amused, she dared him about his deep thoughts. Teddy quickly left, leaving Billie chuckling. Later, Billie excitedly greeted her friend Connie, nearly knocking over some men in her rush. Chet, who liked Connie, struggled to chat with her as Billie and friends swarmed around. Disappointed, Chet slipped away, feeling ignored. The girls chatted happily about new outfits and plans, walking towards Billie's house.

Across from them on the train, a colorful parrot was causing a ruckus by squawking loudly. An elderly woman tried to calm it by covering its cage with a black cloth. The passengers chuckled and resumed their activities, but the girls were still bothered by the woman's constant chatter about the parrot.

Billie was bubbling with excitement, listing all the intriguing things she had encountered recently. She was convinced there were mysteries afoot, especially surrounding Hugo Billings, Miss Arbuckle's album found in the woods, and the enigmatic children.

Connie chuckled, explaining the smell of clams aboard the _Mary Ann_, always available for islanders to buy. Proudly, she mentioned they never needed to purchase any as Uncle Tom kept them well-supplied. Pointing to a small island ahead, she revealed it as theirs, with a beacon flashing in the evening mist. Connie warned of the shallow waters causing shipwrecks in storms. She shared stories of wrecks and how the lighthouse had saved many lives. Upon arrival, Connie warmly greeted her parents.

"Connie was correct, absolutely correct. It was clam chowder--the kind of clam chowder one imagines about--come true. Uncle Tom had prepared it that very afternoon and had brought it over in a large bucket reserved for such special occasions. Connie's mother had also served pork chops, applesauce, muffins, honey, and apple pie. After the meal, the table looked as if a swarm of locusts had been at it. Now, having fulfilled his duties, Uncle Tom had strolled into the dining room to meet the girls and smoke a cigar. The dining room was cozy and tastefully decorated. Mr. Danvers, older than his wife, adored her and watched her every move. The girls were tired and looked forward to exploring the next day. They were tempted by the thought of bed. Tomorrow, they might visit the lighthouse and Uncle Tom. Thinking of Uncle Tom made Billie remember the clam chowder, even though she couldn't eat another bite. ""Oh, this is so relaxing,"" sighed Billie as she crawled into bed. She praised the delicious dinner and wondered if Connie's mother always cooked so well. Connie explained that her mother was an excellent cook, despite having a maid. Connie expressed her eagerness to uncover the mysteries surrounding Miss Arbuckle and her album.

"Connie responded defiantly, ""Well, of course I do. So do all the rest of you. But as for regretting asking you, I have half a mind to..."" She stood up threateningly, but Billie intervened, chuckling. Gradually, the sound of waves lapping on the shore calmed her into a daze where tall men, shabby albums, and odd huts blurred together.
