Mollie hesitated, blushing uncomfortably. She wasn't as quick with words as Polly and Betty but was skilled with her hands. ""I don't know,"" she replied.

Polly raised her hands, urging quiet from Betty. She agreed to join the Camp Fire Club and use her influence to recruit others. However, she questioned how the club related to their problem about their mother, which was her main concern. Betty insisted the club was essential. Suddenly, the doorbell rang, startling the girls. Polly went to greet Mr. Wharton and his family. She returned looking gloomy, mentioning they couldn't entertain in the kitchen due to 'The Princess'. As they gathered by the fire, Betty proposed forming a Camp Fire Club to camp in the woods all summer. She preferred this over a trip to Europe. Polly danced in excitement, envisioning a summer under the stars. Betty emphasized the need for the right girls and guardian. When Esther Clark was mentioned, Betty hesitated due to her background.

"Betty swiftly tipped her chair. ""Goodnight,"" she said, ""we'll chat tomorrow. I mustn't stay too late. It's not that I mind having Esther in our group, it's just we don't know her well. It's crucial we all get along."" As Betty tried to leave, her skirts snagged. ""If you go, I'll cry all night,"" Polly said, almost convincingly. ""I shouldn't have been honest, being Irish and all,"" she apologized. ""Never tell me the truth about myself. Let anyone join your group. We don't have to agree to have fun and help each other,"" Polly suggested. Betty groaned, knowing Martha, her rival, was suggested as a chaperone.

The living room at the Ashton home stretched along one side of the house, flooded with sunlight on that May afternoon. The portraits on the walls seemed to soften in the light, gazing down with a hint of warmth at the unfamiliar girl in the room. She busied herself arranging fresh flowers and adjusting the furniture. Esther Clark, the girl, then placed a vase of apple blossoms on the grand piano, where the sunlight touched it gently. She hesitantly began to play a simple yet powerful tune, the Camp Fire Girls' call. Suddenly, Richard Ashton, Betty's brother, entered, mistaking Esther for his sister. Esther, shy and startled, remained silent, causing Richard to wonder about her presence. As they exchanged a few words, Richard noticed Esther's unease and tried to put her at ease.

The new girl's shyness disappeared momentarily, revealing a bright smile that transformed her plain face. She expressed her desire to play the piano, hesitant to ask Richard's mother.

Betty quickly guided her guests into the fragrant drawing-room as soon as the car halted. Esther, feeling awkward and fearful, stood by the wall, trying to blend into the background. Despite lacking a traditional home and social upbringing, she was determined to follow the Camp Fire law and believed it would lead her to happiness. Miss McMurtry then requested Esther to recite the Law of the Camp Fire for the girls. Initially hesitant, Esther found the courage to speak, encouraged by a friendly face in the crowd.

Polly hesitated but decided not to interrupt Sylvia, who seemed absorbed in her own thoughts. As Betty showcased the Camp Fire club's honors, she encouraged everyone to recite the club's laws to earn their woodgatherers' rings. Betty explained the progression from woodgatherers to Fire-Makers and finally to Torch Bearers, the highest honor. Miss McMurtry, the appointed guardian, expressed doubts about her suitability but was reassured by Betty's enthusiasm. Esther proudly displayed her bead chains representing her achievements in health and home crafts. Despite initial reservations, Betty warmly included Esther in the group, offering her a Wood-Gatherer's ring.

Mrs. Ashton held Polly's hand as the maids served cake and hot chocolate to the guests in the drawing-room. Most girls were busy with Miss McMurtry and Betty, leaving Esther alone. Dick Ashton noticed and brought her treats, chatting without prying. Mrs. Ashton pondered Betty's restlessness and decision to explore the Camp Fire idea. Polly assured her they would be reformed. The morning sun painted the White Mountains in opal hues as the campers woke to birdsong. The campsite was well-organized with tents, a clean ground, and a smoldering campfire. The thrush's song marked the start of a new day. Polly's excitement for the day ahead was met with a sleepy voice reminding her of the hard work camping entailed.|"['1.

"Polly chuckled, ""Oh, what a joy!"" she exclaimed. ""Betty, you've been eager to be helpful; think of the honor beads you'll earn! But now, be useful to me; let's go for a swim together."" Betty couldn't resist her friend's request. ""Okay,"" she agreed, searching for her sandals as Polly wrapped a gown around her. ""I'm not sure if Miss McMurtry will approve of us going alone, but she didn't say we couldn't, even though Camp Fire life is about doing things together.""

Mollie O'Neill protested, ""Betty and Polly, that's not fair! Just because I can't swim well and Esther can't swim at all, you're leaving us behind. Please bring our bathing suits."" Both girls nodded and laughed sheepishly. As they swam in the lake, Betty turned to Polly, ""Isn't it a bother having Esther with us? I wish we had Meg or someone else."" Polly looked serious, ""You don't like Esther, do you? She cares for you, though.""

A boy, about sixteen, stood near a lake, looking amused. He had the appearance of a country boy with sunburnt hair and tanned skin. Polly, feeling haughty, asked him to leave, but he ignored her and laughed. He carried a pail and a basket, behaving rudely. Betty, Mollie, and Esther asked him to leave as they were camping. The boy, uninterested, walked towards their tents. Polly, with a temper, threw a stone at him, causing him to bleed. Mollie apologized, feeling ashamed. The boy, surprised, noticed the blood and acknowledged that Polly was not the one who threw the stone.

The young man, staring at Polly and Mollie, remarked, ""You are alike--with a difference,"" neither accepting nor refusing her apology. He then noticed blood on his hand, causing concern.

"Polly stood quietly with Betty, watching the scene unfold. She felt regretful and embarrassed, but her Irish humor made her slightly amused.

Since Eleanor's arrival at camp, she had put aside her artistic talents to focus on camp duties. Dressed in the camp uniform, she hadn't painted the camp's totem as planned. Instead, she surprised everyone with her talent for making an exceptional Irish stew, earning her recognition. Alongside seven other girls, there was Edith, a milliner's assistant who joined the camp, courtesy of Betty's persuasion. Edith's health improved in the fresh camp air, away from her daily grind. The two sisters, Juliet and Beatrice, added a mix of fashion and mischief to the group. Miss McMurtry decided to establish camp rules after some girls went swimming unsupervised. The girls gathered for breakfast, reciting a morning verse of thanksgiving together, a camp tradition. Led by Polly, they faced Sunrise Hill, reciting an ancient chant as the day began.|"['1.

Betty was upset that Polly invited Nan to the camp without warning, interrupting their Council Fire tradition. Miss McMurtry scolded Nan for being in the woods alone at night. Polly explained that Nan shared a fun secret about boys planning a surprise visit in disguise. Polly suggested preparing a surprise for the boys instead. Despite initial disapproval, Polly's charm softened Miss McMurtry's tone. Polly invited Nan to stay the night, planning to sleep outside. Later, Betty watched over Nan and Polly, who were asleep outside. Meanwhile, on the lake, three girls fished for a couple of hours.

From two until the sun went down, the time at Sunrise Camp was quite busy. The Camp Fire girls and Boy Scouts engaged in friendly competitions. The girls excelled in knot-tying, surprising the boys. While the boys were better at running and marksmanship, one girl named Beatrice surprised everyone with her speed. Sylvia, the youngest, shone in observation games. As evening approached, the Scouts intended to stay, but Miss McMurtry bid them farewell. John admitted the girls impressed him, despite his initial doubts. The day ended with a song, led by Esther. Betty felt neglected by her brother, Dick, who shared a secret with Esther. The girls retired early, including Nan, who stayed the night. Amidst the peaceful night, Nan's sobs woke Polly.|['1.

Polly remembered Betty's suggestion to change her opinion after thinking things over. Despite the lack of time for reflection that day, Polly decided not to give Betty too much time to reconsider. Later, under the blue blankets, Polly whispered her request to Betty, who initially was too sleepy to understand but eventually agreed. Six weeks had passed at Sunrise Hill, where the Camp Fire girls enjoyed harmonious days. Nan Graham, initially struggling with her behavior, showed improvement due to the camp's influence. Nan learned neatness and independence, yet she still struggled with being truthful. Miss McMurtry hoped the Camp Fire would teach the girls valuable lessons, including independence and honesty. Despite Nan's challenges, the group showed kindness and support. Polly, optimistic and influenced by the number thirteen, sought to fulfill her commitment to Betty regarding Nan's expenses. On the thirteenth of August, Polly requested to go alone to Woodford for an important errand, a request granted by their guardian. The girls, usually not going alone into town, saw no issue in Polly's request as the route was safe and through familiar areas.|"['1.

Miss McMurtry watched with unease as Polly O'Neill set off after lunch, noticing Polly's lack of physical strength compared to other girls. Polly's high spirits and nervous energy often led to misunderstandings. Today, Polly seemed unusually well and eager, teasing her friends about a mysterious errand. Despite promising to share details, Polly kept silent, upsetting Betty and Mollie. Polly's conviction that her desire would come true grew as she walked through the golden fields, reciting poetry. Alone in the woods, she stumbled upon an unexpected answer to her wish. At the post office, she sent a letter to her mother about her find. Returning to camp, Polly shared her discovery through a gift of peaches, silently settling her debt to Betty.

Fifteen minutes passed, and Esther and Nan were still absent. Eventually, Esther returned looking upset.

Before the feast, the Camp Fire girls had a significant ceremony. Each girl had to swear an oath of purity and honor, followed by singing the maidens' song and dancing around the altar. The purpose of this ceremony puzzled the group, including their guardian, Miss McMurtry. There was suspicion that the girls had a deeper motive than just entertainment and reviving an old Indian custom. Edith stepped forward looking nervous, signaling something important was about to happen. The ceremony involved touching a stone and arrows to declare purity. Edith's trembling voice hinted at recent uneasiness and the disappearance of money. The girls were uncomfortable, especially Nan, who seemed the focus of attention.

Betty found $50 in an envelope near their tent, but she lost it. Polly discovered the envelope in the woods and used the money without realizing it belonged to Betty. When the truth dawned on her, she panicked as she had already spent it. Polly regretted her impulsive actions, especially since the money should have been returned to Betty. During a camp activity, Nan was falsely accused of taking the money. Nan, innocent, silently endured the accusations until Betty reassured her. Meanwhile, Polly, overwhelmed with guilt, slipped away unnoticed. As the girls searched for Polly, fears of her safety arose. Despite worries, Miss McMurtry calmed the girls, suggesting Polly might have lost her way and would return at sunrise. The group decided to organize search parties if Polly didn't return by morning, following scouting methods they had learned.|"['1.

Mollie O'Neill required the most care during the night. She and Polly were close despite their differences. Betty Ashton sat by Mollie, comforting her and trying to reassure her about Polly's disappearance. Betty was also puzzled and anxious.

Betty handed the note to Esther and felt conflicted. Mollie comforted Betty, assuring her that Polly cared deeply for her. The group split up to search for Polly, with some staying back at the camp.

Billy Webster, or as he liked to be called, was out in a wheat field with his reaper, about to start his work when a Camp Fire girl, either Mollie or Polly, came running towards him in distress. To avoid making mistakes, he let the girl speak first, smiling friendly at her. Until lunchtime, Billy searched the farm with the three girls. Though they didn't find anything, the girls found comfort in him, especially Mollie, who relied on him like an old friend. Billy reassured her several times that there was no need to worry. By noon, Billy convinced the girls to go to his big farmhouse, meet his mother, have lunch, and rest. Meanwhile, Betty, Esther, and Sylvia were slowly walking along the main path towards the village. Sylvia was meticulously tracing Polly's footsteps, finding her red, white, and blue beads, leading them to Mrs. O'Neill's cottage where they found Polly, unwell but safe.|"[""1.

"Polly whistled, and some of the girls giggled. ""Sylvia, you'll be the richest among us, even richer than 'The Princess',"" Polly exclaimed. Sylvia remained silent, her lips pressed together firmly. She inherited her father's determination, a self-made man. Eleanor and Juliet brought tea, and Polly was handed a pine knot by Betty. Polly wished for forgiveness for her past behavior and embraced the camp's motto: 'Think first.' Mollie mentioned Polly's missed opportunity to win $50 for the best essay.
