The Rat didn't speak, but he bent down and untied a rope, then pulled on it. He got into a small boat painted blue outside and white inside, a perfect fit for two animals. The Mole admired the boat, even though he didn't fully grasp its purpose. The Rat skillfully rowed across the water and secured the boat. He gestured for the Mole to step in cautiously. The Mole found himself seated in the stern of a real boat, feeling the cushions and oars. The Rat emphasized the joy of being in a boat, whether messing about in it or with it. He proposed spending the day on the river together, which thrilled the Mole. The Rat then fetched a lunch basket and suggested they set off.

"The Rat shared with the Mole how their friend Toad had a history of quickly tiring of his hobbies. Toad had gone from sailing to punting to house-boating in a short time. The Rat and the Mole watched as Toad rowed past them in a wager-boat, putting in a lot of effort. The Mole, eager to row, took over the sculls from the Rat but ended up capsizing the boat and falling into the cold water. The Rat, with a good laugh, helped the Mole back to shore and warmed him up.

The Toad, leading his companions, prepared to capture the old grey horse for their journey. The horse, annoyed at the dusty task assigned by Toad, was hard to catch. Meanwhile, Toad packed the cart with essentials and they set off, chatting happily. On a golden afternoon, they enjoyed the birdsong and friendly passersby. Arriving at a remote common, they rested, dined, and talked under the stars. The Mole and Rat planned to return home early the next day, but the Rat decided to stay with Toad until the trip ended. The next morning, while Toad slept, the Mole and Rat worked to prepare breakfast. They took a pleasant ramble, camped, and Toad learned the value of hard work.

The patter of footsteps grew louder, echoing like hail on the dry leaves. The entire forest seemed alive, creatures running, hunting, closing in on something—or someone. Panicked, the figure ran aimlessly, bumping into obstacles, stumbling, darting under and around things. Finally seeking refuge in the shelter of an old beech tree, hoping for safety among the dry leaves. Trembling, he faced the Terror of the Wild Wood, a fear that others had encountered. Meanwhile, the Rat dozed by the fire, until a noise woke him. Concerned for his friend, the Mole, the Rat ventured into the Wild Wood, following the Mole's tracks. Armed and determined, the Rat searched the woods, calling out for his friend until he finally heard a faint reply. Relieved, he found the Mole hiding in a tree, offering comfort and advice.|['1.

The Mole felt comforted by the Rat's laughter and the sight of his weapons. The Rat suggested they head home while there was still light. The tired Mole asked for a break. The Rat agreed, and they rested. The Mole fell asleep, troubled, while the Rat waited, pondering their situation. They set out, pretending the wood was familiar. After a while, they sat, exhausted, lost in the thick snow. The Rat proposed finding shelter in a dell to rest. They searched for a dry spot and stumbled upon one, but the Mole fell and hurt his leg.

"""It's a very clean cut,"" said the Rat, examining it again attentively. ""That was never done by a branch or a stump. Looks as if it was made by a sharp edge of something in metal. Funny!"" He pondered awhile, and examined the humps and slopes that surrounded them. But the Rat, after carefully tying up the leg with his handkerchief, had left him and was busy scraping in the snow. He scratched and shoveled and explored, all four legs working busily, while the Mole waited impatiently, remarking at intervals, ""O, come on, Rat!"" ""Well,"" he said at last, slowly, ""I see it right enough. Seen the same sort of thing before, lots of times. Familiar object, I call it. A door-scraper! Well, what of it? Why dance jigs around a door-scraper?"" ""Of course I see what it means,"" replied the Mole. ""It simply means that some very careless and forgetful person has left his door-scraper lying about in the middle of the Wild Wood, just where it's sure to trip everybody up. Very thoughtless of him, I call it. When I get home I shall go and complain about it to— to somebody or other, see if I don't!""

After some hard work, the Rat's cudgel hit something hollow. They uncovered a small dark green door in a snow-bank. The Mole was amazed. The Rat's clever deductions led them to the hidden door. The Mole was in awe of the Rat's intellect. The Rat urged the Mole to ring the bell while he tried to open the door. The Mole pulled the bell-pull, and they heard a deep-toned bell. After a while, they heard shuffling footsteps approaching. The Badger welcomed them warmly, surprised to see them in the snow at night. He invited them in, impressed by their adventure in the Wild Wood.|"[""1.

The Badger, in his worn dressing-gown and shabby slippers, greeted the animals kindly as he ushered them into his cozy kitchen. The room was filled with the warmth of a crackling fire and the inviting aroma of supper. The red brick floor, the crackling fire, and the well-worn settles all contributed to a sense of comfort and contentment. The Badger tended to their needs, providing them with dressing-gowns, slippers, and even attending to the Mole's injury with care. As they sat by the fire, toasting themselves and enjoying the hearty meal laid out for them, the storm outside felt like a distant memory.

"""Oh dear, things seem to be going from bad to worse,"" solemnly stated the Rat, as the Mole lounged comfortably by the fire, trying to appear appropriately sorrowful. The Rat explained how their friend Toad had been in another accident recently due to his insistence on driving, despite his incompetence. The Rat suggested that if Toad hired a skilled animal driver and left the driving to them, everything would be fine. However, Toad believed he was a gifted driver and refused to listen to advice, resulting in multiple crashes.

"""It's bedtime,"" the Badger said, rising and fetching candles. ""Follow me, I'll show you where you'll sleep. Take your time tomorrow—breakfast whenever you like!"" The Badger led the animals to a room filled with his winter stores. Two cozy beds awaited them, surrounded by the scent of lavender. The Mole and Water Rat quickly settled in, feeling joyful and content. The next morning, they came down late to find a warm fire and young hedgehogs eating porridge. The hedgehogs explained how they got lost trying to go to school. The Rat, preparing breakfast, asked about the weather. The animals knew the Badger was busy during this time of year. Later, the Otter arrived, sharing news from River Bank, where everyone was worried about their absence.

The Otter and the Rat were engaged in lively conversation, discussing the happenings around the river. The Mole, being a good-natured fellow, prepared some fried ham for them. As they enjoyed their meal, the Badger joined them, expressing the comfort and security he found underground. The Mole shared his contentment with the Badger, emphasizing the peace and tranquility of being underground. The Badger agreed, highlighting the freedom and ease of living in a burrow. He contrasted this with the challenges faced by those living above ground, like Rat having to move due to floods or Toad dealing with house maintenance issues.

"The Mole agreed enthusiastically, and the Badger became very friendly with him. ""After lunch, I'll show you around my place,"" the Badger said. ""I can tell you'll appreciate it. You have a good eye for domestic architecture."" After the meal, the Badger lit a lantern and led the Mole through tunnels and rooms of various sizes. The Mole was amazed by the vastness and complexity of it all. The Badger explained that he only cleaned the passages and chambers he needed, as the tunnels were remnants of an ancient city that existed long before. The Badger shared how nature had reclaimed the land, creating a home for them once more. The Badger reflected on the cyclical nature of life, how beings come and go, but some endure.

The Badger comforted the Mole after his first encounter with the Wild Wood creatures, assuring him that all will be well. The Rat, feeling anxious about the river, urged them to leave before dark. The Otter offered to guide them through the paths, and the Badger reassured them of safe passages. As they emerged from the tunnel, they faced the Wild Wood's menacing presence. Following the Otter's lead, they headed back home, longing for familiar comforts. The Mole realized his connection to cultivated lands, finding solace in the known. Passing by a sheep pen, the animals continued their journey, guided by an instinctive path leading them home. Approaching a village, the Rat assured them of a peaceful passage, envisioning the villagers gathered around fires indoors.|"[""1.

As the two travelers trudged through the snow towards the village, the early winter night enveloped them in a soft, chilly embrace. The quaint village was barely visible, illuminated by the warm glow seeping out of the cottages' windows. Peering in, they observed scenes of domestic bliss - families gathered around tables, engaged in conversation or immersed in handiwork, exuding a natural grace in their unawareness of being watched. Yet, it was a specific window, shrouded in darkness, that emanated a sense of home and comfort, a sanctuary from the harsh outside world. A birdcage hung by the window, its silhouette etched against the night, the occupant nestled in its feathers, oblivious to the observers. The travelers felt a pang of longing for their own distant abode as they witnessed these intimate moments. Moving forward, the scent of the fields beyond the village beckoned, signaling the nearing end of their journey. They pressed on, lost in their thoughts, until a familiar scent stirred a deep yearning within one of them, evoking memories of a forsaken home. The Mole, overwhelmed by nostalgia, halted in his tracks, his senses reawakened by the poignant call of his long-forgotten dwelling. In a desperate plea, he implored his companion to heed the silent summons and return home.|"[""1.

The Rat had raced far ahead, too distant to hear the Mole's calls or notice his distress. Concerned about the weather and the looming snow, the Rat urged the Mole to hurry, promising to return for whatever the Mole had found. Despite his own longing for home, the Mole's loyalty to his friend held firm. Overwhelmed by emotions, the Mole struggled to keep up with the Rat, who chattered cheerfully, oblivious to the Mole's silent suffering. Eventually, the Rat, noticing the Mole's exhaustion, suggested they rest by some tree-stumps. There, the Mole's pent-up emotions burst forth, and he wept for his lost home.

"The Rat waited until Mole's crying calmed down and became more rhythmic. Then, he stood up, saying casually, ""Well, old chap, we should continue our journey."" Mole, still sniffling, pleaded for them to go back due to the darkness and snow. But the Rat insisted they find the place, cheering Mole up with stories as they walked. Suddenly, the Rat felt a strange sensation through Mole's body and stopped, observing. Mole, almost in a trance, led them through fields until they reached a neatly swept area with Mole's door. Inside, the place was tidy, with a garden seat, a skittle-alley, and a pond with goldfish. Mole, overwhelmed, regretted bringing Rat to the cold, neglected home. But the Rat, undeterred, lit up the house, praising its compactness and planning a cozy night with a fire."|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did the Rat do when Mole's crying calmed down?\nA) He left Mole alone.\nB) He continued their journey.\nC) He scolded Mole for crying.\nD) He fell asleep.\nE) He went back home."", 'Question 2:\nWhy did Mole plead for them to go back?\nA) Because he was hungry.\nB) Because he was scared of the snow.\nC) Because he was tired.\nD) Because he missed his home.\nE) Because he wanted to play.', ""Question 3:\nWhat did the Rat feel that made him stop while walking with Mole?\nA) Hunger.\nB) A strange sensation through Mole's body.\nC) Tiredness.\nD) Happiness.\nE) Sadness."", 'Question 4:\nHow did Mole feel when they reached the neatly swept area with his door?\nA) Frightened.\nB) Overwhelmed.\nC) Angry.\nD) Excited.\nE) Confused.', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the Rat do to the neglected home?\nA) He left it as it was.\nB) He criticized it.\nC) He lit it up and praised its compactness.\nD) He destroyed it.\nE) He left Mole alone in it.', ""Question 6:\nWhat did the Rat plan for the night in Mole's home?\nA) To leave and go back home.\nB) To scold Mole for bringing him there.\nC) To have a cozy night with a fire.\nD) To sleep outside.\nE) To go exploring in the snow.""]"|"['B) He continued their journey.', 'B) Because he was scared of the snow.', ""B) A strange sensation through Mole's body."", 'B) Overwhelmed.', 'C) He lit it up and praised its compactness.', 'C) To have a cozy night with a fire.']"
Encouraged by his cheerful friend, the Mole energetically cleaned while the Rat gathered fuel for a warm fire. The Rat invited the Mole to join him by the fire, but the Mole felt despondent and refused. Feeling sorry for his friend, the Mole expressed his inability to offer any food. The Rat, undeterred, found some sardines and biscuits, lifting the Mole's spirits. They then discovered a hidden cellar with beer, delighting the Rat. The Mole shared the story of how he acquired his homey possessions, forgetting about their hunger. As they were about to eat, they heard the field mice carol-singing outside. The Mole explained that it was a local tradition for the mice to visit homes during the holidays. The scene of the mice singing carols outside the door warmed their hearts.|"['1.

The chatter stopped and the bashful singers shared smiles before a distant sound of bells reached their ears, followed by a joyful peal. The Mole excitedly invited the field-mice to join them by the fire. Amidst preparations, coins changed paws for supplies, and the field-mouse scurried off with a lantern. The others cozied up to the fire, enjoying warmth and stories while sipping mulled ale. The Mole shared tales of the field-mice's plays, trying to coax a shy performer. As supper preparations buzzed, the Rat ensured everyone was cared for. Soon, a bountiful spread appeared, and the friends dined, reminiscing and catching up.

The friends bid farewell to the departing visitors, their pockets filled with gifts for loved ones. Alone in their cozy home, Mole and Rat stoked the fire, sipped mulled ale, and reflected on the day. Rat, exhausted, suggested turning in, praising their snug abode. Mole, too, tired, felt the comfort of his surroundings. As he drifted off to sleep, he appreciated the simplicity and warmth of his room. Despite the allure of the world above, Mole cherished his humble sanctuary. The next day, amidst the river's tranquility, Mole and Rat readied their boats for the season.

The Badger walked up the stairs and instructed his friends to take Toad inside. Toad, resisting and protesting, was then led through the door. The Badger turned to the chauffeur of the motor-car and informed him that Toad had changed his mind and would not need the car that day. Inside, they had to wrestle Toad to the ground to remove his motor-clothes. With his bravado gone, Toad giggled weakly, realizing the situation. The Badger addressed Toad, expressing concerns about his reckless behavior and the trouble he caused. He decided to have a serious talk with Toad in the smoking-room to make him understand the consequences of his actions. After a lengthy discussion, Toad emerged remorseful and agreed to give up driving motor-cars for good.|"['1.

"""Alright,"" said the Badger firmly, standing up. ""Since persuasion won't work, we'll resort to force. I knew it would come to this. Toad, you've often invited us to stay at your beautiful house, and now we're going to. We'll stay until we change your mind. Take him upstairs and lock him in his room while we sort things out."" The Rat, speaking kindly, said, ""It's for your own good, Toad,"" as they carried him struggling upstairs. The Badger sighed, ""It will be a long process. We must take turns to watch over him until he's better."" They took shifts to watch over Toad, who had fits where he pretended to drive a car. Over time, his fits lessened, but he seemed disinterested in everything. One morning, the Rat found Toad still in bed and Badger eager to go for a walk.

Toad expressed his gratitude to Rat for his concern but assured him that he didn't want to be a burden. Despite feeling unwell, Toad insisted he didn't expect to trouble his friends much longer. Rat, in a heartfelt response, acknowledged Toad's struggles and expressed relief that the difficult times might soon come to an end. Toad, though weak, understood his friends' weariness and didn't want to impose further. Even in his condition, he thought of sparing his friends from additional trouble by declining their help.

"""It's wise to err on the side of caution,"" he remarked after some thought. ""Toad has a history of imagining things, but asking for a lawyer is a new level. If there's no real issue, the doctor will set him straight and lift his spirits. I should play along and go; it won't take long."" With that, he hurried to the village on his merciful mission. Toad, who had eagerly sprung out of bed upon hearing the lock turn, watched him from the window until he vanished down the drive. Then, chuckling, he quickly dressed in his best attire, grabbed some cash, and fashioned a makeshift rope from his bed sheets to escape out the window. Whistling cheerfully, he walked away in high spirits. As the Badger and the Mole returned, Rat faced a somber lunch, recounting his feeble tale. The Badger's biting comments were skipped over, but even the Mole, while supporting his friend, couldn't help but remark, ""You've really messed up this time, Ratty! Toad of all creatures!""

Hardly aware of how it happened, Toad found himself at the wheel of a car, his old passion for driving overwhelming him completely. In a trance-like state, he drove the car recklessly through the streets and countryside, feeling like the lord of the road. However, his joyride came to an abrupt end when he was caught and sentenced to twenty years in prison for his crimes. Dragged away by the law's minions, Toad was met with public scorn and ridicule as he was taken to a grim dungeon in a castle.

The Rat explained to the Mole that he had to leave because the animals were kind to him and made his departure jolly. However, he felt guilty as they seemed unhappy, especially with Little Portly missing. The Mole, not too concerned, mentioned how the child often strayed but returned safely. The Rat, grave, revealed that Portly had been missing for days, worrying the Otters. They searched high and low, even asking other animals, but found no trace. Otter feared Portly might be near the weir, a dangerous place. Otter was so anxious that he planned to watch by the ford, where he once taught Portly to swim and fish. The Rat shared how Otter hoped Portly, if he returned, would remember the ford and stop there to play. So, Otter kept vigil every night, hoping for Portly's safe return.|"['1.

The Rat was completely absorbed by a new experience that filled him with joy. As they rowed in silence, the Rat guided the Mole towards a backwater. The surroundings were breathtaking, with colorful flowers lining the water's edge. The Mole was captivated by the enchanting music that surrounded them, bringing tears to his eyes. The meadow looked fresher and greener than ever before, with vibrant roses and fragrant meadow-sweet. Approaching a weir, the animals felt a sense of anticipation. They moored their boat at a beautiful island, filled with orchard trees. Awe struck the Mole as he felt the presence of something divine nearby. As the sun rose, a vision appeared before them, only to vanish moments later.

Rat spoke slowly, suggesting they were in the right place to find their friend. Suddenly, he spotted Portly asleep. Excited, Rat ran towards him. Mole, lost in thought, struggled to remember a beautiful dream. Portly woke up joyously but soon felt lost and cried. Rat and Mole comforted him with a promise of a boat ride. They paddled down the river, noticing a change in the colors of the flowers. Approaching the ford, they let Portly off, who recognized Otter. Feeling exhausted but content, Mole and Rat drifted downstream, soaking in the sun and the wind's whispers. Rat shared a poetic moment with Mole, describing the music of the reeds.

In a dark dungeon, Toad found himself trapped and forgotten. He lamented his fate, fearing he would never see the light of day again. But a kind-hearted girl, the gaoler's daughter, took pity on him. She offered him comfort, coaxing him to eat and lifting his spirits. With a plate of bubble-and-squeak, the scent of hot cabbage filled the cell, sparking a glimmer of hope in Toad's heart.

When the young lady returned, a few hours later, she brought a tray with a cup of sweet-smelling tea and a plate stacked with hot buttered toast, thickly sliced and golden brown on both sides, with the butter oozing through the holes like drops of honey. The aroma of the toast spoke directly to Toad, reminding him of cozy kitchens, breakfasts on crisp mornings, and warm firesides on winter evenings. As he sipped his tea and ate his toast, Toad's spirits lifted, and he eagerly shared stories about his home, Toad Hall.

Toad embarked on a daring escape disguised as a widow woman, relying on the washerwoman's appearance to navigate the prison gates. Despite facing challenges with chaff and humor, Toad managed to maintain his composure and wit. Eventually, he reached the railway station, aiming to board a train homeward. However, his attempts to buy a ticket were thwarted by his lack of a waistcoat pocket, which contained all his essentials.

The train raced through the tunnel with the engine roaring and the sparks flying. The pursuers were slowly catching up. The engine-driver, realizing they couldn't outrun them, had a plan for Toad. He explained that they would speed through the tunnel, then slow down as they reached the woods. Toad had to jump off and hide while the pursuers passed. The plan worked, and Toad found himself alone in the dark woods. The silence was eerie after the noise of the train. Toad felt scared and lost.

Once upon a time, Toad Hall was taken over by the Wild Wooders, causing chaos and mess. Toad, outraged by the situation, encountered a ferret with a gun and narrowly escaped.

The Rat scolded Toad for his ungrateful behavior, highlighting how Toad had been enjoying a lavish lifestyle while his loyal friends, the animals, were out in the harsh weather, working hard to protect his property. Toad, realizing his mistakes, felt remorseful and wanted to go out and find his friends. However, his mood quickly changed when he heard supper was ready. The Rat, understanding Toad's hunger after being on prison fare, joined him at the table. The Badger, looking disheveled, greeted Toad solemnly. Toad was puzzled by the serious greeting but the Rat assured him the Badger would cheer up after eating. Soon, the Mole arrived, excited to see Toad back. Toad downplayed his adventures, claiming he was not clever. The Mole was thrilled to have Toad return unexpectedly.|"['1.

The Badger spoke kindly to the upset Toad, urging him to stop crying and turn over a new leaf. The stoats guarding the area were formidable, making an attack futile. Toad, known for his inability to keep secrets, dismissed the idea of the stoats being vigilant. The Badger revealed a secret passage in Toad Hall, known only to Toad's father, and explained how it could help in times of trouble. The Badger shared a plan involving Otter disguised as a sweep to infiltrate a banquet at the hall, where the weasels would be unarmed and unsuspecting.

The Badger explained the plan to the other animals. The weasels would rely on their sentinels, but the animals had a useful tunnel under the butler's pantry. They agreed on a plan and decided to make arrangements the next morning. Toad, despite feeling excited, went to bed as instructed. He dreamt vividly but eventually slept soundly. The next morning, he found the others had finished breakfast. The Mole had disappeared, and the Rat was busy distributing weapons. The Badger assured them that once inside the dining hall, they could handle the stoats with their sticks. The Rat, slightly confused, mumbled to himself until the Badger told him to stop. The Mole shared how he got the idea for the plan while in the kitchen at Toad Hall.|"[""1.

Toad felt envious of Mole for his recent actions. Mole recounted a tale of a ruse he played on some stoats, claiming a fierce attack on Toad Hall by badgers, rats, and toads. The Badger praised Mole's wit, causing Toad's jealousy to escalate. Before Toad could react, lunchtime interrupted. They dined on bacon, beans, and pudding. The Badger, foreseeing a busy night, took a nap. The Rat, diligently preparing for the night's events, equipped everyone with belts, swords, cutlasses, pistols, and more. Toad, eager to share his adventures, recounted stories of what-could-have-been. As night fell, the Rat dressed them for the upcoming mission. The Badger teased the Rat about the excess gear, but the Rat insisted on being thorough.|"[""1.

The Badger, holding a lantern and a stick, led the way with Mole, then Rat, and lastly Toad. Toad, eager not to be left behind, followed quietly. As they journeyed along the riverbank, Toad slipped into the water. After a scare, they continued through a dark, cold tunnel. Toad, wet and shivering, heard Rat's warning. Anxious not to be left alone, he rushed forward, causing chaos. Mistaken for attackers, the Badger drew a pistol. After calming down, they heard cheering above. They heaved open a trap-door into a noisy banquet. The heroes, including Toad, confronted the weasels, causing a panic.

The event ended swiftly. The four Friends patrolled the hall, striking with their sticks at any foe in sight. In a matter of minutes, the room was empty. The Mole handcuffed about a dozen weasels on the floor. The Badger, taking a break, praised the Mole for his efforts. He instructed the Mole to check on the stoat-sentries outside. Meanwhile, the Rat and Toad were tasked with setting up a table for supper. They found various foods in the pantry. As they prepared to eat, the Mole returned with rifles, reporting that the stoats had fled. The Badger commended the Mole and asked him to tidy up the bedrooms for the captured weasels.

The Mole and Toad enjoyed a delightful supper together, with Toad expressing gratitude for the Mole's efforts. The Badger praised Toad's bravery, and they all retired to rest in Toad's home. The next morning, Toad overslept and found a meager breakfast waiting for him. Seeing his friends outside having a good time, Toad begrudgingly accepted the task of writing invitations for a banquet. Despite his initial reluctance, Toad decided to write the invitations and boast about his achievements in the recent fight with the Chief Weasel.

Toad had a grand idea and worked diligently to finish all the letters by noon. Just then, a bedraggled weasel arrived at the door, offering to help. Toad gave him the invitations to deliver and hinted at a reward. Later, when the animals returned from their river trip, Toad seemed unusually proud. The Mole felt uneasy, and the Rat and Badger suspected something was amiss. After lunch, Toad tried to sneak away, but the Rat and Badger confronted him about the banquet plans. They gently explained that there would be no speeches or songs, urging Toad to change his ways. Toad, after a moment of reflection, agreed to reform and promised to be a better Toad.|"['1.
