Once upon a time, a young man set sail on a magnificent ship made of gold and silver, with sails of brocade and a crew of noble-looking men. St. Nicholas guided the ship. The vessel was laden with precious gems like diamonds and rubies. As he journeyed, he encountered a rival who had fallen on hard times. In response, the young man commanded a ship of black wood, tattered sails, and a crew of disfigured and sickly sailors. This contrast puzzled his rival, who invited the young man to his palace. Meanwhile, an old man, skilled in dark arts, stole the young man's magical bronze ring. With the ring's power, he transformed the splendid ship into a vessel of misfortune.

Once upon a time, there was a king who fell in love with a princess under an enchantment. To break the spell, he sought help from a fairy. The fairy granted his wish but warned that his son would be unhappy until he realized his nose was too long. The king was forbidden to share this secret or else he would vanish. The king married the princess but passed away soon after, leaving behind their son, Hyacinth. Despite his large nose, the queen was reassured that it was a mark of heroism. As Hyacinth grew up, he believed that a long nose was a sign of beauty. On his twentieth birthday, he saw a portrait of a princess, the Dear Little Princess, and was captivated by her beauty, despite her small nose. When he sought to marry her, an enchanter whisked her away, leaving Hyacinth determined to find her.

"""Oh! it doesn't lack anything,"" replied the Fairy. ""On the contrary, quite, there is only too much of it. But never mind, one may be a very worthy man though his nose is too long. I was telling you that I was your father's friend; he often came to see me in the old times, and you must know that I was very pretty in those days; at least, he used to say so. I should like to tell you of a conversation we had the last time I ever saw him.""

""The poor boy is right,"" said the Fairy. ""I was forgetting. Come in, then, and I will give you some supper, and while you are eating I can tell you my story in a very few words--for I don't like endless tales myself. Too long a tongue is worse than too long a nose, and I remember when I was young that I was so much admired for not being a great chatterer. They used to tell the Queen, my mother, that it was so. For though you see what I am now, I was the daughter of a great king. My father--""

""But I really cannot listen to anything until I have had something to eat,"" cried the Prince, who was getting quite angry; but then, remembering that he had better be polite as he much needed the Fairy's help, he added:

Once upon a time, a prince was content with his long nose until a fairy pointed out its unusual length. The prince, irritated by the constant remarks, rode away. The fairy then trapped a princess in a crystal palace to help the prince realize the impracticality of his nose. When he tried to kiss the princess's hand, his nose obstructed him. This made him see his flaw for the first time. The prince learned a valuable lesson about self-awareness and how self-love can blind us to our faults. In another tale, a poor man's daughter refused to marry a white bear who promised riches. Eventually, she agreed, and the bear took her away on an adventure.

The North Wind offered to take the girl to a faraway land, but as they traveled, he grew tired and had to rest by the sea. The girl, unafraid, was carried to a castle where a Princess with a long nose lived. The Princess wanted the girl's golden apple, but the girl refused to sell it for gold or money. Instead, she asked to spend the night with the Prince. The first two nights, the Prince was asleep, and the Princess with the long nose drove the girl away. On the third night, the Prince pretended to drink a sleeping potion and stayed awake. The girl revealed how she had come to the castle to save him from marrying the long-nosed Princess. The next day, the Prince tested the Princess's abilities by asking her to wash a shirt with three drops of tallow on it, a task only someone born of Christian folk could accomplish.

While the King expressed his deep love for the Princess to the Fairy of the Desert, he knew he had to be patient and clever to outsmart her powers. The Fairy, torn between her friendship with the Yellow Dwarf and the King's plea, led him to a magnificent palace with transparent emerald walls. The King, feeling like a prisoner, tried to please the Fairy to stay in her good graces. However, a Mermaid appeared offering to help him escape the Fairy's clutches. The Mermaid assured the King of her intentions and proposed a plan to deceive the Fairy.

The Mermaid gave the King a sword made of a single diamond, brighter than the sun, to help him rescue the Princess.

Once upon a time, in a village, there was a little country girl called Little Red Riding-Hood. She wore a red hood made by her grandmother. One day, as she strolled through the woods, she met a wolf who wanted to eat her but couldn't due to others nearby. The wolf tricked her into picking flowers while he rushed to her grandmother's house. Upon reaching the house, he devoured the grandmother and disguised himself in her bed.

"Dear King and Queen, rest assured that your daughter will not perish due to this calamity. While I cannot entirely reverse the actions of my elder, the Princess will indeed prick her hand on a spindle. However, instead of death, she will only fall into a deep slumber lasting a hundred years, until a prince awakens her.

To prevent the foretold tragedy, the King immediately issued a proclamation forbidding the use of spindles under the threat of death. Yet, years later, the Princess, unaware of the ban, encountered an old woman spinning in a tower room. The Princess pricked her finger and fell into a deep sleep.

The good Fairy, upon learning of the situation, arrived swiftly and ensured that when the Princess awoke, she would not be alone. The Fairy cast a spell, causing everyone in the palace to sleep until the Princess's awakening. Additionally, she grew a dense forest around the palace to protect the Princess.

Years later, a young Prince, driven by love and honor, ventured into the enchanted forest and found the sleeping Princess. The Prince, undeterred by the eerie silence and sleeping figures, knelt before the Princess in awe of her divine beauty."|"['1.

However, the younger son was considered stupid by many, unable to grasp even the simplest of concepts.

The prince was once a kind young man, but his upbringing by a foolish nurse had made him spoiled and self-willed. He was told he would be a king and that kings could do as they pleased. As he grew older, he realized the folly of his ways but found it hard to change. A magical ring pricked him when he misbehaved, but he grew tired of its reminders and cast it away. He then fell into wicked habits and wanted to marry a girl named Celia, who refused him because of his bad deeds. His foster-brother, a bad influence, advised him to imprison Celia, but the prince's conscience was troubled. Eventually, his anger led him to seek vengeance against those who helped Celia escape, including his old tutor, whom he banished despite once respecting him.|"[""1.

The Fairy Truth punished Prince Darling for his evil ways by transforming him into a monstrous creature with the head of a lion, the horns of a bull, the feet of a wolf, and the body of a snake. As he roamed in the forest, he fell into a pit set by hunters. They captured him and took him to the city, where they found out that the Prince had been killed by a thunderbolt. Suliman, the tutor, was crowned as the new ruler. Prince Darling, filled with regret, realized his wrongdoings and repented.

The prince decided to do good instead of seeking revenge. He freed the keeper from the tiger and was saved by a kind monster. The monster then turned into a dog named Prince Darling. The Queen wanted to keep him but the court physician advised feeding him only bread. Prince Darling was hungry but patient. One day, he found a house made of gold and precious stones where people entered looking splendid but came out pale, thin, and hungry. He saw Celia being taken inside against her will. The prince regretted not being able to help her. Celia later threw food to him, turning him into a white dove. He found Celia in a desert with an old hermit and was restored to his human form by the Fairy Truth. Celia and the prince were reunited, and the prince was grateful for the Fairy's kindness.|"['1.

"Once, as they neared the shore, a magnificent chestnut horse appeared just as the ravens had foreseen. The King exclaimed, ""Excellent! This horse will take me to my palace."" He moved to mount the horse, but Trusty John, quick to act, snatched the pistol and shot the horse. The King's servants, who never favored Trusty John, protested, ""How could he kill the beautiful horse meant for the King's ride?"" The King silenced them, recognizing John's loyalty. They proceeded to the palace, where a cupboard held a bridal shirt that seemed to gleam like gold and silver. As the young King reached for it, Trusty John swiftly threw it into the fire. The servants grumbled again, but the King, trusting John, saw purpose in his actions. The wedding festivities began, but when the bride suddenly fell as if dead, Trusty John acted swiftly to revive her. Despite not understanding John's actions, the King ordered him imprisoned. Trusty John, before his sentence, revealed his actions were to save the King. Impressed by his loyalty, the King tried to pardon him, but it was too late.

When I landed, the Emperor discovered me sleeping on the ground.

The machine, a wooden frame on wheels, was prepared by five hundred workers. Eighty poles were used to lift and secure me onto the frame. Nine hundred strong men pulled cords to hoist me onto the machine. Fifteen hundred horses then pulled the machine towards the capital.

In the right pocket of the giant Man-Mountain, we discovered a large piece of rough fabric suitable to cover a royal chamber. In the left pocket, a massive silver chest proved too heavy to lift. Upon opening it, one of us found themselves knee-deep in dust, causing a sneezing fit. The right waistcoat pocket held thin white sheets tied with a cord, possibly inscribed writings.

One morning, a fortnight after gaining my freedom, Reldresal, the Emperor's private affairs secretary, visited me at home. He spoke of a potential invasion from Blefuscu, a powerful empire like Lilliput. The conflict between the two empires began over the way to break eggs. The Emperor of Blefuscu's people, the Bigendians, have rebelled against breaking eggs at the smaller end. Now, war looms as the Blefuscudians prepare to attack. The Emperor of Lilliput seeks my help due to my strength and valor. I devised a plan to seize the enemy's fleet. The channel between Blefuscu and Lilliput was only eight hundred yards wide. I used cables and iron bars to move the enemy's ships, facing arrows that struck my hands and face. With determination, I successfully moved fifty of the enemy's largest men-of-war.|"['1.

"When the Blefuscudians saw the fleet moving in order and me pulling at the end, they cried out in sorrow and hopelessness that is hard to describe. After escaping danger, I paused to remove the arrows from my hands and face and applied the ointment given to me upon my arrival. I then took off my spectacles and, waiting for the tide to lower, waded to the royal port of Lilliput. The Emperor and his Court awaited me on the shore. Initially, they couldn't see me in the water, and the Emperor feared I had drowned. However, as I approached and held up the end of the cable, I shouted, ""Long live the Emperor of Lilliput!"" The Emperor welcomed me with joy and honored me. He wanted me to bring the enemy's ships to Lilliput, but I refused to enslave a brave people. A plot against me began, leading to a dangerous situation. Later, an embassy from Blefuscu arrived, offering peace. They praised my valor and invited me to their kingdom.

Through the secretary's friendship, the affair was arranged. The plan to starve gradually was to be kept a secret, while the sentence to put out the eyes was recorded. In three days, the secretary would visit, read the accusation, and highlight the mercy in only condemning to eye loss. Surgeons would ensure the operation's accuracy by discharging sharp arrows into the eyes. I decided to sail to Blefuscu, where I was welcomed graciously. The Emperor of Lilliput, unaware of my knowledge, sought to have me returned as a traitor. However, the Emperor of Blefuscu refused, offering protection. I prepared to depart, receiving gifts and leaving with livestock. While sailing, I encountered an English ship, which rescued me.|"['1. What was the plan to be kept a secret?\nA.

Once upon a time, a man owned a meadow by a mountain with a barn storing hay. Each St. John's eve, the hay vanished mysteriously. The man asked his sons to guard the barn. The eldest tried but ran when the barn shook. The next son failed too. The youngest, Cinderlad, was mocked but accepted the challenge. As the night approached, the barn rumbled and quaked. Cinderlad remained brave. Despite the violent noises, he stayed put. Suddenly, a horse appeared outside the barn, eating hay. Cinderlad used a steel tool to tame the horse. He rode the horse to a secret place. When he returned, his brothers were surprised at his success.|"['1.

Once upon a time, there were two brothers who were too scared to watch the meadow on St. John's Eve. However, Cinderlad, the youngest brother, dared to go. He witnessed three violent earthquakes and caught a horse eating hay. Cinderlad tamed the horse with a steel for striking fire and rode it home. The next St. John's Eve, the same events occurred, and Cinderlad tamed another horse. On the third St. John's Eve, Cinderlad faced the earthquakes bravely, tamed the third horse, and rode it home. Despite his brothers' mockery, Cinderlad proved his courage. In the kingdom, a glass hill challenge was announced to win the Princess's hand. Knights and princes failed until a mysterious knight on a copper horse rode up the hill. The Princess admired him and threw a golden apple that landed in his shoe.

All the princes and knights were summoned by the King that night to display the golden apple from the glass hill. Each knight attempted but failed to produce the apple. Cinderlad listened to his brothers' tales of the knights' attempts. The next day, the brothers set out again, leaving Cinderlad behind due to his appearance. Determined, Cinderlad went alone to the glass hill. Despite the knights' efforts, none could ascend. A knight in silver armor rode up two-thirds of the hill but turned back.

Prince Houssain admired the abundance of rose-sellers in the Indian streets, where everyone carried a nosegay or garland. Tired from exploring, a merchant invited him to rest at his shop.

Prince Ahmed visited the Sultan of the Indies regularly, always in grand attire. However, some viziers filled the Sultan's mind with doubts about his son's intentions, fearing he might overthrow him. The Sultan, trusting in his son's loyalty, dismissed the viziers' claims. To test Prince Ahmed, the Sultan secretly hired a female magician to spy on him.

The sorceress, disguised as a magician, reluctantly drank the potion from a china dish. After a short rest, she claimed to be cured sooner than expected. The two fairies, disguised as women, led her to a grand hall where Fairy Paribanou sat on a throne surrounded by other fairies. The sorceress was amazed by the grandeur. Later, she reported to the Sultan about Prince Ahmed's wealth and the danger he posed. The Sultan's advisors suggested killing the prince, but the sorceress proposed a different plan. She advised the Sultan to ask Prince Ahmed to procure a magical tent from his fairy wife. The Sultan agreed to follow the sorceress's advice.

The treasurer quickly took the tent out of the palace and placed it far away. The Prince, initially skeptical, was amazed to see the tent expand to shelter huge armies. He apologized to Paribanou for doubting her powers. The Fairy explained the tent's unique ability to adjust its size based on the army it covers. The treasurer then returned the tent to the Prince, who promptly rode to his father, the Sultan. The Sultan was astonished by the tent's size and requested water from the Fountain of Lions.

Once upon a time, there were two widows living on a small piece of land they rented. One widow had two sons, and the other had one. When it was time for the widow with two sons to send them off to seek their fortune, she gave her eldest son a can to fetch water from the well. The amount of water he brought back would determine the size of the cake she would bake for him. Despite the can breaking, leaving him with little water, he chose to take the whole small cake with his mother's curse rather than share it with her blessing. As he embarked on his journey, he gave his brother a knife, instructing him to check its condition daily. If it remained clear, all was well; if it grew dim, trouble had befallen him. On his travels, he encountered a shepherd who spoke of the Red Etin of Ireland, a fearsome creature.
