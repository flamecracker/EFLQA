"In the story ""By Pike and Dyke,"" the focus shifts to the later stages of the War of Independence in Holland. The war was so lengthy and complex that it required multiple books to cover. The first volume ended with the death of the Prince of Orange and the capture of Antwerp. The second volume delves into the phase where England openly supported Holland, significantly aiding in the war's success. England's involvement expanded the conflict beyond Holland and Zeeland, leading to the defeat of the Spanish Armada and the capture of Cadiz. The English soldiers, led by Sir Francis Vere, played a crucial role in securing the independence of the Netherlands. The English queen, Elizabeth I, sympathized with the Dutch cause and eventually joined the conflict, sending troops and financial assistance to aid in their fight against Spain."|"['1.

The ship's skipper explained that the Susan, though roomy, had limited space in the fo'castle where they would sleep. The ship could accommodate six people, including the skipper, a man, and a boy. The skipper mentioned that the cargo, including flour and bacon, would fill up the hold. The skipper regretted not having all the items on board to set sail that evening.

Afterward, they enjoyed a supper of hot cakes prepared by John's daughter. The next morning, they set sail on the Susan. John explained how they navigate using marks on the sandbars and the importance of these markers for safe travel.

During their first few hours at sea, Geoffrey and Lionel absorbed a lot of nautical knowledge. They grasped distinctions like the mainmast versus the mizzen, and understood that ropes supporting the masts were stays. They also learned that halliards hoist sails, sheets control sail corners, and gaffs and booms are parts of the sails. John Lirriper advised them to remember these basics to be useful on the ship. They observed other vessels at Whittaker Spit and learned about different channels for ships. After a hearty breakfast, they set sail again, experiencing beating - sailing against the wind by tacking. Geoffrey pondered how the boat moved forward with the wind almost against it, a concept beyond their current understanding.|"['1.

Geoffrey and Lionel pondered the concept of a boat having a sense of direction while chatting on deck. They observed that each vessel had its own quirks and moods, much like a living being. The boys were intrigued by the idea that boats seemed to have a personality of their own. They discussed how sailors believed that ships had an unexplained essence that made them unique. Despite finding the idea of boats being alive absurd, they acknowledged the superstitions prevalent at the time. As they sailed towards Sheerness, they marveled at the Susan's speed and agility compared to larger vessels. The skipper explained that in rough waters, weight and power played a crucial role in a ship's performance. The boys decided to seek their father's wisdom on the matter when they returned home.|"['1.

The Susan sailed smoothly along the river, passing Gravesend and the fort of Tilbury. As they continued, they saw Grays and Greenhithe. The tide slowed as they reached Purfleet, where they anchored for the night. The skipper decided to wait until morning to navigate the narrow river. Upon arriving near London Bridge, the boys were amazed by the bustling city and the multitude of ships from various countries. They saw Dutch traders, Venetian and Genoese ships, and vessels from France. The Tower of London was impressive, but the boys found it less beautiful than their own castle. The crowded streets of London surprised them, but as they walked into Eastchepe, they found a more pleasant and lively atmosphere with well-dressed people and bustling shops. Their guide led them towards Tower Street, avoiding the narrow and smelly lanes.|['1.

In just fifteen minutes, they reached the shop that smelled strongly of tar. Coils of rope were stacked against the walls, with blocks, lanterns, compasses, and various gear on shelves above. The chandler welcomed them warmly, expressing his relief at their safe arrival. He recognized the sons of Mr. Vickars, the rector, and offered them hospitality in his spacious home. The chandler's wife, Dorothy, was equally welcoming. The boys were assured they would find comfort in their new abode after their cramped ship cabin. The chandler led them upstairs, revealing a surprisingly roomy and cozy house. As the chandler excused himself to attend to his shop, the boys were left in Dorothy's care.

Two boys ventured out into the bustling streets of London, where they marveled at the array of goods on display in the shops. Accustomed to the grandeur of noble gatherings at the castle, they found the silver work, silks, and satins less surprising. What truly fascinated them was the lively scene: the shouts of apprentices, the diverse crowd of citizens, nobles, knights, foreigners, soldiers, and sailors. The boys' amusement turned to anger as the apprentices made snide remarks about their rural origins, provoking them to retaliate. Despite their desire to confront the insolent apprentices, they knew it could lead to trouble. As they made their way back, they reflected on the challenges of keeping their composure in the face of such provocations and the importance of not giving in to rash actions.|"[""1.

"Tomorrow we will explore the city, visit the shops in Chepe, see the Guildhall and St. Paul's, then walk from Temple Bar along the Strand to Westminster to admire the great abbey. We might even take a boat back. The following day, if the weather allows, we plan to row up to Richmond to see the palace. Mistress Dorothy, we hope you'll join us; it's a delightful and trendy outing. The river, with its boats, is one of the loveliest sights in London.

Unfortunately, these plans were disrupted the next morning. As they entered Cheapside, they encountered two young men. ""Look, Lionel, it's Francis Vere!"" Geoffrey exclaimed. ""Wasn't he supposed to be in Holland with the Earl of Leicester?"" They greeted Captain Vere, expressing their desire to join him in the wars.

Captain Vere and Geoffrey discussed the possibility of the boys joining the army as pages. Captain Vere appreciated the boys' spirit and intended to take them along. He believed it would be beneficial for the boys, shortening their path to becoming officers. Captain Vere acknowledged the lack of experienced officers and the need for pages. He saw the boys as part of their extended family, making their presence more pleasant. The conversation took place as they arrived at the Tower, preparing for a meeting regarding arms and munitions. Geoffrey excitedly shared with Master Lirriper that they had asked to join Captain Vere as pages and were awaiting his decision.

The boatman hesitated, torn between his loyalty to the vicar and his respect for the lords of Hedingham. He pondered the consequences of defying Mr. Vere's decision to take the boys with him. The boys, consumed by the thrilling prospect of fighting against oppressors, paid little attention to their surroundings. John Lirriper felt conflicted but ultimately resigned to the situation, realizing he couldn't prevent the boys from joining Mr. Vere. He arrived promptly with the boys at the abbey, where they were to meet Mr. Vere. Despite his misgivings, he decided to accept the situation and engage with the boys cheerfully.

Captain Francis is now a captain in the Earl of Leicester's army. He recently returned and finished his meal. He explained that the boys would be his pages, helping with tasks like collecting firewood and forage. They would have duties similar to gentlemen volunteers, aspiring to become officers. Despite the hardships, they would have the opportunity to associate with officers and volunteers when not on duty. They must obey orders strictly while on duty. The boys were excited to go with Captain Francis, who arranged for the Earl to take a letter to their father, reassuring him about their early military journey. The boys were staying with a citizen and ship chandler in London and were preparing to sail from Deptford soon. The Earl offered to take care of their outfit and arrangements.|"['1.

John Lirriper expressed relief, grateful for the earl's involvement. Plans were made to stay for fitting clothes. They requested John to collect their belongings and thank their hosts. Letters were penned for their parents. The boys were then guided to a meal and later to purchase three suits each. Armor and necessities were also obtained. After exploring the abbey, they penned letters to their parents, explaining their decision to join the army.

During the journey, the young lads had no tasks to perform as the ship's cook prepared their meals, and the officers' servants attended to their needs. Their final stop was Bergen op Zoom, a town located at the mouth of the Scheldt River. While sailing, Captain Vere pointed out landmarks like Walcheren and Flushing to the boys. He explained how the Dutch used dams and dykes to keep the sea at bay, preventing flooding of their low-lying lands. Despite the risks, the Dutch were resilient and hardworking, defending their country against invaders. The ship briefly anchored at Sluys until the tide turned, allowing them to continue their journey.

"""Welcome back, Vere; welcome, Allen. You have been fortunate to spend a few days in England and see more than just this dull flat country and its slow rivers. What's the latest from London?"" Vere answered, ""There's not much news. We were only in London for four days, and it was quite busy. How are things here? With summer approaching, the Dons should be getting active."" The officer responded, ""They claim to be. The Duke of Parma is gathering his army at Bruges, recruiting the best Spanish infantry and some Italian regiments. A battle was fought at Crevecoeur, Hautepenne was slain, and the fort captured. Our leaders fear Parma may move towards Sluys, and we may struggle to defend it."" As they entered town, they arrived at Francis Vere's quarters. Vere introduced the boys as his pages until they were old enough to be volunteers. The boys settled in quickly, with light tasks and much to explore in Bergen op Zoom. Their stay was cut short by a call for troops to aid Sluys against Parma's advancing army. Sir William Russell, the governor at Flushing, urgently requested troops and provisions, prompting a swift departure from Bergen op Zoom."|"['1.

In a short time, the town buzzed with activity as soldiers were summoned by trumpets to head towards the river. Ships were ready for their service, and each company boarded their assigned vessel. Geoffrey and Lionel proudly joined their troop, clad in steel caps and jerkins, under Captain Vere's orders. The little fleet set sail towards Sluys, a town near the Zwin river, defended by a moat and walls. The English troops, led by Sir Roger Williams, were warmly welcomed by the Protestant townspeople. They worked together to fortify the town against the impending Spanish threat. Captain Vere and his men were graciously hosted by a wealthy merchant family in a splendid house, marveling at the comfort and luxury of the Low Countries compared to their English estates.|['1.

The house was spotless from top to bottom, with no speck of dust on the furniture. Even during the city's siege threat, the merchant's wife ensured her maids were always cleaning. Geoffrey mentioned his mother's pride in cleanliness, comparing it to the Dutch households where cleaning seemed constant. Lionel thought the Dutch went overboard with cleaning, missing out on peace and quiet. The boys felt like criminals when entering muddy. The Duke of Parma faced challenges due to the canals and swamps surrounding Sluys during the siege. Wooden huts were built on piles, protected by earth bags. The attack focused on the western gate, with batteries targeting the castle and the bridge. John Menyn showed Vere and the boys the wine cellars under the town, explaining their strategic advantage against the Spaniards.|"[""1.

The wine merchant explained that the cellars were not solely owned by wine dealers; they were rented out like houses. Different merchants needed different numbers of cellars, so there were usually doors connecting them. Captain Vere was grateful for the information, as it ensured the safety of the men defending the walls. He planned to inform Williams and Morgan to station men in the cellars closest to the Spaniards. The town's defense strategy involved occasional firing to keep spirits high but not to stop the enemy's progress. The townspeople organized into groups to guard the walls and strengthen defenses. The women in the town formed companies and built a fort named Fort Venus. Captain Vere explained the origins of the Flemish and Walloons and how the Spanish cruelty led to an increase in Holland's population and defense. The Spaniards' actions inadvertently strengthened Holland's resolve to resist.|"['1.

The boys quickly left at their fastest pace. They had a list of all the houses where the company's men were staying. The loud cannon fire had everyone coming out to see what was happening. The company gathered quickly. Francis Vere led them through the town's long streets and onto the bridge of boats. It was the boys' first time under fire. They stayed brave but later admitted feeling uneasy crossing the bridge with cannonballs flying overhead. Inside the castle, they felt safer. The men took their positions on the walls, firing at the Spanish artillery. The boys helped by carrying wine and water.

During the afternoon, the boys helped bring down wounded men from the walls. Gaps appeared, making the courtyard dangerous. The decision to evacuate the castle was made due to the impending attack. The garrison worked at night to transport guns and ammunition. The communication with friends outside was blocked by the enemy. The garrison, outnumbered by the Spaniards, prepared to defend Sluys. The English and Dutch garrison were determined to resist. The Spanish forces aimed to capture the town swiftly. The importance of defending Sluys was evident due to its strategic location for the Spanish fleet. The boys watched the events unfold from a warehouse window. The Spaniards landed close to the ramparts, making it difficult to retaliate.|['1.

Governor Arnold Groenvelt, along with English leaders, decided to drive off the enemy from the dyke to safeguard the city. A force of 400 men gathered and advanced along the dyke towards the Spaniards. Despite a fierce battle, the English and Dutch were supported by comrades on the wall. The Spaniards received reinforcements from boats. The assailants were forced to retreat back to the south gate. The English had been defending for five weeks, and the battle intensified with heavy cannon fire. Amidst the chaos, the population remained remarkably calm. The townspeople continued their daily activities, even as shots struck buildings. The boys admired the resilience of the Dutch women who carried on with chores despite the ongoing cannonade, preventing panic.

Geoffrey and Lionel were observing the Spanish soldier's suspicious behavior. They speculated that the soldier might be sending secret messages to the enemy by tying notes to bolts. Although they lacked concrete evidence, they decided to keep a close watch on the soldier. The boys learned that the neighboring warehouse belonged to William Arnig, a respected Catholic merchant and a captain in the city bands. Geoffrey and Lionel resolved to monitor the soldier's actions the next day. They witnessed the soldier firing bolts towards the moat, with one bolt disappearing beyond their sight. The soldier then retrieved something from the water's edge. Concerned, they reported their findings to Captain Vere.|"['1.

Early the next morning, Geoffrey, accompanied by two men, made his way to his usual lookout. Both men were active and fully engaged in the task after Geoffrey explained the plan. They peered out of the window at the sharp roof sloping in front of them and up to the ridge above. Roger Browne, one of the men, suggested he should go up first due to his experience climbing in high places from his time at sea. Geoffrey agreed and secured a rope around Roger's body for safety.

Geoffrey, a page to Captain Francis Vere, and his friend Lionel, were summoned to London by Lord Burleigh. They had discovered a plot against Queen Elizabeth's life. Twelve armed men were arrested near Datchet Wood, three of them foreigners. The prisoners planned to make the queen a prisoner and force her to abdicate. Geoffrey and Lionel gave evidence before the council. The prisoners were sentenced, some to death and others to imprisonment or banishment. Lord Burleigh thanked the boys in the queen's name and gave them rings as a token of gratitude. The struggle between Spain and England was imminent due to religious differences. Queen Elizabeth's policies had alienated the people of the Low Countries. Spain's isolation was due to Philip's personal ambitions. The Spanish plan to conquer England was hindered by the lack of allies.|"[""1.

In 1587, tensions between England and Spain were high. While Philip of Spain was diligently preparing for an expedition to conquer England, Queen Elizabeth was indecisive. At times, she readied her fleet for battle, only to disarm them shortly after. Sir Francis Drake, seizing a fleeting moment of Elizabeth's warlike resolve, set sail to Spain with a fleet of ships. Despite facing opposition from Vice Admiral Burroughs, Drake led an attack on Cadiz harbor, capturing Spanish ships loaded with supplies for the Armada. Subsequently, Drake's fleet intercepted and destroyed Spanish convoys headed for the Tagus, a port where the Armada was assembling. Though ordered to refrain from entering the Tagus, Drake challenged the Spanish admiral to battle, but the Armada did not engage. Drake then sailed to Corunna, decimating the Spanish ships there before returning to England. These actions by Drake showcased England's naval prowess and its ability to challenge Spanish dominance at sea.|"[""1.

The English fleet faced challenges due to lack of preparation. While the land forces were organized, the navy was ill-equipped. Spain, underestimating the English levies, planned to invade. Sir John Hawkins managed the navy well, but it was still insufficient. Spain had a superior navy due to Philip's grants for shipbuilding. In contrast, England lacked large ships. The English navy, despite being in good repair, was limited in size. The total budget for the royal navy was meager, hindering its readiness. The English fleet was finally prepared, with support from merchants. However, delays and inadequate supplies plagued the fleet. Crews were dismissed, leaving England vulnerable. Despite reports of the Armada's readiness, Elizabeth's restrictions hampered the navy. Lord Howard sailed with the fleet, facing challenges with provisions and sickness among the crew. Elizabeth's delays and restrictions worsened the situation.|"['1.

The Spanish Armada, a formidable fleet, finally set sail after gathering soldiers and sailors from various countries. Divided into six squadrons, the fleet consisted of 129 vessels with a total of 2430 cannons. On board were 8000 sailors, 19,000 soldiers, and other personnel. Meanwhile, in England, the earl, Geoffrey, and Lionel Vickars awaited news. The earl, concerned about the fleet's condition, tried to persuade Queen Elizabeth to send supplies, but she was reluctant. The boys received a letter from Captain Vere advising them to stay in England. They later journeyed to Plymouth to join a ship preparing to face the Spanish Armada. The earl, unable to board due to seasickness, took action by providing provisions for the sick sailors and appealing to the queen. Despite the storm delaying the Armada's departure, tensions rose as England braced for the impending threat.|"['1.

During the summer of 1588, a fierce storm wrecked four galleys off the French coast, including the Santa Anna galleon with 90 seamen, 300 soldiers, and 50,000 ducats in gold. Despite the setback, the fleet continued its journey. The English fleet spotted the Armada near the Lizard, with an English fishing boat alerting Plymouth. Men armed themselves and marched to defend England. The English, with limited provisions and ammunition, prepared for battle. As the Spanish Armada advanced, the English ships, led by Howard and Drake, outmaneuvered and outgunned the Spanish, showcasing superior tactics and firepower. The English maintained the upper hand despite the Spanish fleet's size advantage. The battle raged on, with the English holding the weather gage and inflicting heavy losses on the Spanish. The Spanish vice admiral, Martinez de Ricaldo, tried to cover the fleet's retreat as the English ships from Plymouth joined the fray. The battle for control of the English Channel had begun.|"['1.

The wind picked up, and Lord Howard dispatched a quick boat to alert Lord Henry Seymour about the Spanish fleet's approach. As the afternoon progressed, the wind grew stronger, creating rough seas from the west. Howard trailed the Spanish fleet cautiously, conserving his ammunition. By evening, the Spanish ships clustered together, leading to collisions. The flagship, Capitana, commanded by Admiral Pedro de Valdez, suffered damage. Despite attempts to tow it, the rough waves hindered rescue efforts. Meanwhile, a London vessel engaged with Capitana throughout the night until Drake intervened. The Spanish galleon, San Marcos, valiantly defended itself, forcing Howard to retreat due to low ammunition. The English fleet swelled in numbers, eager for battle, but the Armada remained resilient. The lack of ammunition led to a temporary standoff between the fleets.|"['1.

That night, a new supply of bullets for another day's battle came, and at sunrise, the English fleet headed towards the Armada, engaging them closely for the first time. Ships like the Ark Raleigh, the Bear, the Elizabeth Jones, the Lion, and the Victory went straight into the heart of the Spanish galleons, exchanging gunfire as they passed. During the clash, the Ark Raleigh collided with Oquendo's vessel, losing control as its rudder was damaged. Despite being surrounded by enemy ships, the Ark Raleigh managed to maneuver through them. The battle raged on for hours, with the English ships inflicting damage on the Spanish vessels. However, no captures were made. The Spaniards, low on ammunition, requested urgent supplies from Parma.

At five o'clock on Sunday evening, Lord Howard and his council decided to use fireships to drive the Spanish Fleet out into the Channel. Combustibles like pitch, tar, old sails, and empty casks were loaded onto eight private vessels. At midnight, the fireships were set towards the Armada. The Spaniards panicked at the sight of the approaching flames and cut their cables to sail out to sea. The English fleet pursued them, with Drake and Seymour attacking while Howard captured a galleass. The Spaniards, scattered off Gravelines, were pummeled by the English ships until sunset. Despite the Spanish courage, they suffered heavy losses, with four thousand men killed or drowned.

The English admirals were unaware of the full extent of their victory. Howard, who joined the battle late, believed they were still strong, while Drake, though aware of their losses, hoped to delay the Armada's reunion with Parma. Despite low ammunition, the English showed resolve and gave chase. At dawn, the Armada seemed defeated as the wind shifted. The Spaniards, with a fair wind to Calais, debated returning or sailing around Scotland. The shattered Fleet chose to head north. The English decided to split, with Seymour guarding the Channel and Howard and Drake pursuing the Spaniards, anticipating another Spanish attempt. During the fighting, Geoffrey and Lionel Vickars were mostly spectators, aiding with supplies. In a perilous moment, Geoffrey was knocked overboard, injured, and stranded among the Spanish ships.

He stayed silent for a while, pondering his next move. Aware that revealing his English identity would lead to immediate danger, he struggled to find a way to hide it. With limited knowledge of Spanish, he feared detection if he spoke. The idea of jumping overboard crossed his mind, but the odds of reaching an English ship were slim. Suddenly, he noticed other exhausted Spaniards nearby and a group of soldiers and sailors manning a cannon. Seizing the opportunity, he pretended to be an imbecile, laughing foolishly and assisting with repairs. Disguised in a shirt and trunks, he blended in, escaping suspicion. As the Spanish fleet sailed away, his hopes dwindled. Despite his disappointment, he continued his charade, hoping for a chance to escape and reunite with his countrymen.|"['1.

After the fleet's heroic service, Queen Elizabeth turned stingy once the danger passed. The sick sailors received no fresh food, causing deaths and disease. Admirals Drake and Howard used their own money to buy provisions and shelter. The sailors' wages were withheld, despite a full Treasury. Howard paid for supplies, leaving Hawkins bankrupt. Meanwhile, the defeated Spanish Armada faced hunger and harsh weather. They rationed bread, wine, and water, struggling in the stormy seas. Some ships sought refuge in Ireland but were met with hostility. The Irish, fearing the English retaliation, refused aid and attacked the stranded Spanish. Many ships wrecked, and survivors were killed for their belongings. Among them, Geoffrey, unnoticed due to the chaos, endured suffering and worked tirelessly to help despite his own weakened state.|"['1.

As the ships sailed past Galway Bay, one of them, leaking badly and unable to stay afloat much longer, anchored near the town. Don Lewis of Cordova sent a party ashore, hoping for a warm welcome due to the ties between Galway and Spain. Instead, they were captured. The crew tried to raise anchor but were too weak. Natives in boats captured all, including Sir Richard Bingham, who sent troops to rescue the Spaniards, fearing their strength. Despite his humane reputation, he ordered all but a few nobles be executed. Over 8,000 Spaniards died on the Irish coast, with many killed by the Irish. Among the victims was De Leyva, losing 250 nobles. Geoffrey Vickars went missing during the chaos, presumed lost at sea. His brother, Lionel, received news of the tragedy and set out to join Francis Vere in Holland as Parma's army advanced.|"['1.

Lionel acknowledged that his parents held onto a glimmer of hope that Geoffrey might have been rescued by a Spanish ship and taken as a prisoner to Spain. He confessed that this hope was baseless, as even if Geoffrey had been rescued, he would have met a grim fate. Still, Lionel felt it was better for hope to fade slowly rather than abruptly. The news of active service ahead was a welcome distraction from his grief. Meanwhile, Francis Vere shared that there had been little action on their end compared to Lionel's involvement in the critical battles. The siege progressed slowly, with occasional sorties and cavalry excursions.

Stanley entertained the visitors in his tent, and Parma gifted them two gold chains. They then returned to Bergen and shared the events with Lord Willoughby. The plan was kept a secret in the town, only a few, including Francis Vere, were aware of the plot. On the agreed night, Grimeston ventured out alone, while Redhead was to open the fort gates. Unfortunately, the Spaniards grew suspicious. Grimeston was captured and under threat of immediate harm. As the Spanish troops approached the fort, they were met with a surprise. The drawbridge was down, but suddenly raised, trapping the attackers. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in heavy losses for the Spaniards. After the failed siege, Parma retreated, and Vere was knighted for his bravery. Later, Vere faced challenges with mutinous soldiers at Gertruydenberg, leading to a siege and eventual surrender to the enemy.|"[""1.

In May, Lord Willoughby resigned his command, leading to a shift in leadership dynamics. The appointment of Sir Francis Vere, a young man, to the post was a testament to the high regard the queen and her advisors held for him. Vere had to navigate complex relationships with various stakeholders, including the queen, the States, and military commanders. Vere's first major task was to prevent Count Mansfelt from crossing the Maas with an army of equal strength. Despite challenges, Vere succeeded in throwing a convoy of provisions into the besieged town of Rheinberg. Facing enemy forces, Vere displayed tactical prowess and bravery, leading his troops to victory.

The ship arrived at the port the next morning. Boats filled with people surrounded them, seeking news of other ships and friends on board. Authorities sent large boats to disembark the sick and helpless survivors. Most were too weak from disease, exhaustion, hunger, and thirst to move. Geoffrey was about to join the sick when an officer ordered him to stay on board. Another officer explained that Geoffrey was unwell and confused, allowing him to leave. A kind woman fed him and gave him money. Geoffrey watched as the survivors were brought ashore. Later, he met Gerald Burke, who had arranged for their journey to Madrid. They set off on horses with mules carrying their baggage.

He accompanied Mr. Burke around the city, making friends and improving his language skills. Gerald Burke, a friend of Geoffrey, confided his past and financial troubles. Seeking a new path, Gerald set his sights on Donna Inez, the daughter of the Marquis of Ribaldo, for her wealth. However, challenges lay ahead as the Marquis had other marriage plans.

In the morning, Gerald Burke and Geoffrey admired the view from the ramparts, overlooking the sea. Geoffrey marveled at the city's strategic location and bustling trade. Gerald pointed out the English and Dutch ships, restricted from landing without permits. They discussed the city's potential for trade and its limitations due to space constraints. Gerald then steered the conversation to a more serious topic they had discussed the night before. Geoffrey proposed a risky plan involving a small band of men to help Gerald meet a young lady of interest. If successful, they could flee to a port for a secret marriage. Gerald considered the plan but highlighted the need for a priest for an immediate wedding if the lady agreed.|"[""1.

"Gerald Burke pondered quietly for a while. ""The plan seems feasible,"" he finally spoke, ""but the priest's involvement concerns me. While I have acquaintances in Seville and Cadiz who are priests, involving them in such a risky venture could lead to severe consequences. However, the first challenge is recruiting the right individuals for the task. I cannot simply approach anyone on the street and ask for their assistance in an abduction.""

Geoffrey suggested a muleteer they had encountered earlier as a potential contact for recruiting individuals for the task. Gerald agreed and decided to approach the muleteer discreetly to discuss the matter further. Geoffrey warned Gerald to be cautious, as revealing the true nature of the plan could jeopardize their mission.

Upon returning to the inn, Gerald sought out the muleteer and proposed a conversation in a quieter setting.

The muleteer, impressed by the valour of the Irishman and his servant, offered to join forces for future adventures. He mentioned the defeat of their foes and his willingness to work with the Irishman. The muleteer proposed meeting at Jeres to discuss details and handed over five crowns as a token of agreement. The Irishman, now disguised, met the muleteer at the inn. The muleteer shared that his friends might be nearby and would check on them. The plan was to rendezvous in an hour for confirmation. The muleteer informed the Irishman that his friends were eager to work under such a valiant leader.

The four robbers who had been in the fight greeted him respectfully, and the other two members of the gang, who had been away, followed suit. They had heard of the bravery of the two companions of the trader who had defeated their four comrades. Without a leader and disheartened, they were willing to forgive Gerald for their misfortunes and accept him as their leader. Gerald proposed a plan for profitable adventures. He offered each of them twenty crowns as earnest money for a private job. In future tasks, they would share profits. Gerald and his friend would take three and two shares, respectively, while each of the robbers would take one share. The risk would be mainly on Gerald, as he would handle the captives. The robbers agreed to his terms, took an oath of fidelity, and agreed to punish any traitor. Gerald instructed them to meet at the church twice a day for further instructions and gave them five crowns each for expenses.|"['1.

Gerald and Geoffrey, disguised as an old soldier and a sailor boy, devised a plan to deliver a letter to Donna Inez. They reached the Marquis of Ribaldo's estate after a long walk. In the village, they overheard peasants discussing Donna Inez's kindness and her daily visit to the chapel. The peasants suggested that Gerald and Geoffrey seek charity from Donna Inez the next morning when she passed by on her way to mass. Gerald, pretending to be a war veteran, lamented their plight to the peasants. The villagers advised them to wait by the roadside for Donna Inez, as she was known for her compassionate nature.

That night, the friends slept on straw in an outhouse behind a wine shop and prepared for the next day. By morning, they positioned themselves near a village road, disguised to avoid recognition. Gerald, with a patch over his eye and false moustaches, appealed for help from two approaching ladies. Donna Inez, one of the ladies, showed concern and handed them a coin. The friends then changed back to their usual attire and moved to a nearby village inn. The next day, they returned to the village, hiding in a thicket to observe passersby. Gerald shared with Geoffrey that Donna Inez showed signs of affection towards him. They made plans to ride to Seville, where Gerald intended to arrange a secret marriage with Donna Inez.

The next day, they decided to try to get Inez away in Seville during the grand procession at the cathedral when the streets would be crowded. They hoped she could slip away unnoticed. They preferred this to forcibly taking her. The plan was to intercept the party on their way back as a last resort. Gerald went to the Irish College to seek help from a young priest he knew. The priest was about to return to Ireland and agreed to help despite the risks. Gerald's plan was to marry Inez, then escape to Malaga and sail to Italy, ultimately reaching England. The priest warned of the risks due to Inez's powerful father's influence. Gerald shared his vague plan with the priest, who agreed to assist in getting Inez safely married and away from Spain.|"['1.

Gerald and Denis planned a clever scheme to help a young woman named Inez escape from a forced marriage. They decided to disguise Inez as a peasant woman and themselves as farmers. Gerald's servant would be told that his newly married niece and her husband were visiting, so no suspicions would arise. Gerald would conduct a secret marriage ceremony in the church late at night. They planned to leave the village the next morning to avoid any organized pursuit. By creating a diversion that Inez had run away to become a nun, they aimed to buy time. If their initial plan failed, they would resort to a more forceful escape, prompting an immediate search. Gerald secured a hiding place for Inez with a band of robbers, and they prepared for the upcoming festa. On the day of the festa, they observed the Marquis of Ribaldo, his daughter Inez, and her duenna arriving in a coach for the festivities. Gerald and Denis followed discreetly, blending in with the crowded streets as the procession began.|"['1.

The nobles were upset by the crowd's refusal to make way for them. They argued with the people in front, who were also stuck in the crowd. The crowd, oblivious to the nobles' status, began to mock them. Geoffrey, determined to get through, cleared a path for the lady they were escorting. He assured her that everything was arranged for their escape. As they moved through the streets, Inez, disguised in a lace mantilla, kept an eye out. Geoffrey planned to draw her away from the group during the procession. Once at their destination, Inez changed into a peasant girl's dress to avoid detection. Geoffrey carried her jewels, and they discussed their escape plan. Geoffrey distracted the duenna to create a diversion, allowing Inez to slip away unnoticed.|"['1.

The two young men chatted constantly as they walked to the village to keep Donna Inez's spirits up and distract her from the challenges ahead. The village appeared deserted upon their arrival since everyone had gone to Seville for a festival. Father Denis warmly welcomed them and had prepared rooms for their stay. That evening, Gerald Burke and Inez de Ribaldo were married in a small church with Geoffrey Vickars as the sole witness. The next day, they discussed their escape plan. Father Denis proposed disguising themselves as a trader and his wife traveling to Malaga, with Geoffrey as their servant.

Gerald and Inez set off on a journey, leaving their peasant clothes behind. Gerald carried their belongings while Geoffrey, his former servant, resumed his old attire. They rode through a wood and reached Malaga without any trouble. Despite encountering rough-looking men, their armed appearance deterred any robbery attempts. In Malaga, Gerald arranged for a voyage to Naples for himself, Inez, and Geoffrey. The next morning, they boarded a vessel bound for Italy. Gerald marveled at the ease of their escape, while Inez expressed doubts about her father's forgiveness. Lionel Vickars, fluent in Dutch after 18 months in Holland, overheard Prince Maurice discussing military plans to capture Breda, a strong Spanish-held city.

A few days later, Lionel discussed a daring plan with Captain de Heraugiere. They contemplated infiltrating the town of Breda in disguise to assess the feasibility of a surprise attack.

Captain Heraugiere returned after getting permission. They bought disguises, went back to their place, changed, and headed to the wharf. They found a boat to Willemstad. They landed after a short trip. They discussed blending in at Breda. They rowed towards Breda with the boatman's help. Upon arrival, they were questioned but managed to pass. They explored the town near the river Mark. Breda was guarded, and they noticed the strict checks on boats. They saw a boat unloading peat, an idea struck Lionel.

After a brief stroll through the town, they returned to the ship. The fisherman had already sold all his goods and was pleased to see his passengers back earlier than expected. However, the guard scolded them for the delay. The captain requested to be dropped off on the left bank out of town view and offered extra payment for the inconvenience. They disembarked, circumvented the town, and settled at an inn in Leur. Over supper, they met Adrian Van de Berg, a boatman with valuable information. Captain Heraugiere shared a daring plan to capture the town, and Van de Berg agreed to assist. They discussed details late into the night.

Captain Heraugiere proposed a secret mission to the prince, aiming for success. The plan involved eighty men from Gorcum and Lowesteyn garrisons, with young, daring soldiers like Captains Logier and Fervet. They set off on a vessel near the Mark River mouth. Meanwhile, Prince Maurice, Sir Francis Vere, and others sailed to Willemstad secretly with English and Dutch troops. When Heraugiere's group arrived at the rendezvous, Van de Berg was missing, causing delays. Despite frustrations, they boarded a barge filled with turf, and Heraugiere kept them updated on the slow progress due to icy winds.

When the wind grew too strong for the barge to navigate, it was anchored by the bank. The storm lasted from Monday night till Thursday morning, leaving the party hungry and thirsty in the cramped hold. They finally landed at Nordand on Thursday evening, weak from confinement. After a brief rest, they reboarded upon hearing the wind change. Progress was slow due to low water levels. By Saturday afternoon, they reached the inner harbor. An officer boarded, unaware of those hidden on the barge. A leak caused panic as water rose rapidly. The boatmen pumped furiously, avoiding capture by Italian soldiers. Amidst unloading turf, Lieutenant Held's cough risked exposure. Quick thinking by the boatmen averted disaster. Finally, a plan was set in motion to overtake the fortress, with Captain Heraugiere leading the charge.|"['1.

A group of seventy Hollanders launched a surprise attack on a castle, catching the defenders off guard. The assailants swiftly overpowered the garrison, causing them to flee in panic. Paolo Lanzavecchia attempted to negotiate but was thwarted when Hohenlohe and his cavalry arrived, storming the castle. Shortly after, Prince Maurice and other officers joined the scene, finding the battle already won. The burgomaster, realizing defeat, initiated negotiations for the town's surrender. The terms included payment to the soldiers instead of plunder, safe passage for those wishing to leave, and religious freedom for those staying. The victory showcased the strategic prowess of the Dutch army, honed by Prince Maurice and Lewis William's innovative tactics.

In an hour, the corsair was halfway between the coast and the vessel. Every preparation was made for their arrival. Arms were given to the crew and passengers, guns were ready, cauldrons of pitch were heated, and fires were lit.

Geoffrey fought hard, but soon found himself isolated as the ships drifted apart. In the chaos, he was struck down and lost consciousness. When he awoke, he realized the situation and saw the officer dead beside him. The Moors paid little attention to the survivors until they reached shore.

"Geoffrey had been observing the group from a distance, waiting for the right moment to make his move. As darkness fell, he crept closer to where the traders and captives had settled for the night. The captives were lying down, exhausted from the day's journey. Geoffrey noticed the man with gray hair, the father of the captive girl, whom he had seen earlier. He knew he had to act carefully, as any attempt to escape would be dangerous.

Waiting until the traders and their men were asleep, Geoffrey approached the Spaniard, who had lost all hope after losing his wife and having his daughter taken captive. Geoffrey offered to help him escape, and the Spaniard, filled with gratitude and newfound determination, agreed to follow him.

Together, they journeyed through the night, the Spaniard pushing through his pain and exhaustion with a renewed sense of purpose. As dawn broke, they reached the coastline, where Geoffrey left the Spaniard with provisions before continuing on to ensure their safety."|['1.

The gentle wind and calm sea masked the ship's motion. Below deck, it was hot, but a hint of air seeped through. Geoffrey and his friend spoke softly, while the Spaniard, consumed by thoughts of his daughter, stayed silent. Uncertain of the crew's whereabouts, they anticipated ten adversaries armed with heavy iron bolts. Their plan? Subdue the foes without bloodshed. As night fell, the tension rose. Geoffrey proposed a stealthy approach: bind the crew's legs while they slept. With caution, they aimed to secure the ship peacefully.

For a couple of hours, the talking on deck continued, but eventually, everything fell silent. Down below, the group waited patiently for another thirty minutes before silently climbing back up to the deck. Each person held a cudgel in one hand and several six-foot-long lengths of line in the other. They lay flat on the deck as they reached it, ensuring no noise. Working together, they carefully tied the legs of the sleeping guards without waking them. Ropes were fastened like manacles so that if the men tried to walk, they would fall. Swords and knives were drawn, and the operation, conducted with caution, took time. The group then secured the captain and sailors, ensuring their safety.

Geoffrey, an English gentleman, found himself in the merchant's home in Cadiz after rescuing him and his daughter from the Moors. The merchant introduced Geoffrey to his friends, mentioning his involvement in the Armada and capture by corsairs during a voyage to Italy. Geoffrey assisted the merchant with communications to Dutch and English ships in the port. Concerned about suspicion, the merchant suggested Geoffrey accompany him to church. Geoffrey agreed, seeing no harm in it. They attended a special mass at St. Dominic's, where Geoffrey pondered the differences in worship practices. Despite considering escape plans, the strict Spanish authorities made it challenging. Geoffrey contemplated waiting for peace negotiations between England and Spain. His friend, Stephen, joined a ship to the West Indies for a chance to escape. Geoffrey grew fond of the merchant's daughter, Dolores, and was advised by Stephen to settle in Cadiz.|"[""1.

The camp settled into silence quickly as the march had been long, and dawn was approaching. The king, accompanied by Marshals D'Aumont and Biron, inspected the camp, ensuring all was in order, troops had rations, and officers knew the next day's orders. He visited each regiment and troop, encouraging soldiers and sharing laughs with officers. Lionel admired the king's bravery, astuteness, and charm. Despite facing overwhelming odds, the king maintained a cheerful demeanor. The next day's battle was crucial for his future. The League's forces, adorned in splendid armor, faced the battle-hardened Huguenots led by Henry of Navarre. As the sun rose, both sides prepared for the imminent clash. The battle began with artillery fire and a fierce cavalry charge led by Count Egmont. Despite initial setbacks, Henry rallied his troops, inspiring them to stand firm against the League's onslaught.|"['1.

After repelling the charge, Henry swiftly led his troops into action, charging towards the disordered cavalry of the League. The League's lancers and cuirassiers were overwhelmed by the force of the attack. Marshal Biron, rallying his troops, followed the king's white plume into the heart of the battle. Egmont, leading the cavalry of Flanders, fell dead during the charge. At one point, the king's white plumes disappeared, causing a moment of uncertainty in the army. However, Henry reappeared unharmed, boosting morale with his presence. The cavalry played a crucial role in the battle, with the infantry of both sides staying out of the fight. The victory was decisive, with the royalists losing a quarter of the Leaguers' losses. Despite the opportunity to capture Paris, Henry opted for a siege due to various factors, including financial constraints and negotiations with the pope. The siege strategy involved cutting off Paris's food supply and relying on famine to force surrender. Paris resisted with religious fervor and support from the League. The eventual arrival of reinforcements prolonged the siege until late August. The armies finally clashed, with both sides preparing for a major battle. Parma's cavalry initially advanced, but he then diverted his forces to attack Lagny.|"['1.

When Lagny was first occupied, some of Sir Ralph Pimpernel's group were assigned to stay there. Additionally, half a company of English soldiers who had traveled from Holland were also based in the town, making the garrison a total of 1200 strong. Lionel's horse had been injured at Ivry, needing rest and care before it could carry him again. Lionel wasn't keen on driving off cattle from locals to feed the army, so he welcomed the chance to stay in town due to his horse's injury. He took the place of an ill officer in charge of the English infantry stationed there. Lionel enjoyed his time in the town, staying with a citizen's family. After a week, he joined them for meals and became friends with the daughters, learning a bit of French from them.

As the weeks passed, Lionel Vickars grew close to the family. The maids also liked the young officer. When trouble arose from unruly groups near the garrison, Lionel swiftly brought his soldiers to protect the house. When Parma's army neared, Sir Ralph Pimpernel's cavalry joined the king, leaving Lionel and the infantry disappointed for missing the expected battle. One morning, Lionel was urgently woken by Timothy Short, reporting that the Spaniards had set up a bridge and were preparing to besiege the town. Lionel quickly armed himself.

In just thirty minutes, the Spanish cannons, set up overnight, began bombarding the town walls. The town had few cannons to fight back, and the defense was weak. By evening, breaches were made, gates destroyed, and the Spaniards were ready for an assault. Lionel and his group, along with Huguenot gentlemen and Germans, bravely defended their gate, pushing back the Spanish attacks repeatedly. Despite the heavy Spanish columns, they couldn't break through the archway defended by the brave group. As chaos spread, some soldiers shouted that the Spaniards had entered the town at multiple points. The Germans dispersed, but the Huguenot noble suggested surrendering. Lionel was advised to hold the gate. Eventually, the men surrendered, leaving their arms and seeking refuge in churches. Lionel, after facing danger, found safety in a secret underground chamber with the merchant's family.|"['1.

Jacques had learned the location of Parma's army the night before and guided Lionel on a detour to Henry's camp, taking great care to avoid detection. Along the way, they encountered Parma's cavalry but managed to pass without raising suspicion. Jacques, a humble man, refused payment for his guidance, considering Lionel a guest of his master. When Lionel reached the camp, he shared news of the recent events with Sir Ralph Pimpernel and King Henry. Henry had been outmaneuvered by Parma, who had captured Lagny, leading to a disintegration of Henry's army. However, as Parma's troops faced sickness and internal conflicts, he had to withdraw, allowing Henry to regain control of Lagny and Corbeil. Lionel, grateful for Jacques' help, protected his family from harsh treatment in the town. Prince Maurice's brief visit ended when Parma relieved Paris, prompting his return to Holland.|"[""1.

During their absence, little occurred in the Netherlands, except for Sir Francis Vere leading a small group of English soldiers to storm the Spanish fortifications blocking relief to Recklinghausen. He successfully freed the town and repelled the besiegers. Subsequently, he captured a fort near Wesel on the Rhine. By the end of 1590, around eight thousand English troops were in Holland, marking the start of a significant shift in the war. Prince Maurice, with the aid of his English allies, initiated an active offensive strategy, surprising enemies with his rapid maneuvers and innovative tactics. In a clever move, Vere disguised his soldiers as villagers to retake Zutphen forts lost due to betrayal.

The Duke of Parma believed he had enough time to capture Knodsenburg before Prince Maurice could return to help. Two rivers blocked the prince's way back, and he would have to cross the treacherous Foul Meadow and the dangerous Rouvenian Morass. However, Prince Maurice seized the chance to showcase the quality of his army. Upon hearing of Parma's advance on July 15th, Prince Maurice swiftly marched south. In just five days, he crossed the rivers and marshes, surprising the Spanish army. Despite a failed Spanish assault on Knodsenburg, Prince Maurice's forces, led by Vere, ambushed the Spanish cavalry.

During a fierce siege, the storming parties quickly advanced to capture the town's bastions, leaving it vulnerable to the besiegers. The garrison surrendered the next day, with many casualties on both sides. Count Lewis Van der Berg lost his life, and the wounded were left behind. The besiegers suffered losses too. Following the surrender, Prince Maurice moved on to lay siege to the well-fortified city of Coevorden. Meanwhile, Sir Francis Vere was ordered to withdraw with English regiments to aid Henry of Navarre. Despite initial reluctance, Vere rushed to assist Maurice in a critical battle against Verdugo. Vere's timely arrival turned the tide, forcing Verdugo to retreat. Coevorden eventually surrendered, marking a significant victory for Prince Maurice's forces.

He planned to reduce his business in Cadiz, sell his ships, and transfer his fortune to a banker in Brussels. The banker would send the money to England through merchants in Antwerp. Geoffrey intended to sail to Italy and then to England, where he would find his partner. After the successful voyage, Geoffrey, Dolores, and their children sailed to England on the Rainbow. The fleet's departure caused destruction in Cadiz, impacting Spain's trade and prestige. Geoffrey's return to England with his Spanish wife pleased his family, who warmly welcomed Dolores. Geoffrey abandoned soldiering, settled in London, and established a successful trading business with his father-in-law. Lionel Vickars later joined a failed expedition against Spain's fleet in Ferrol.|"['1.

In January 1598, Sir Francis Vere led an expedition to Turnhout, where a Spanish force was gathered. Despite the bitter cold, the allies reached the village after a 24-mile march. Count Varras, upon hearing of the approaching allies, ordered a retreat, breaking down a bridge to slow them. Prince Maurice, with Vere's advice, pursued the retreating Spaniards. Vere's musketeers engaged in a skirmish, allowing Maurice and the cavalry to charge. The Spanish musketeers fled, and the cavalry broke their formations. The English cavalry covered the retreat of their allies and repelled the Spanish cavalry. Count Varras perished, and many Spanish soldiers were captured. The allies emerged victorious, capturing numerous enemy colors in the battle.|"[""1.

The triumph was achieved solely by the allied cavalry, as the foot soldiers never made it to the battleground. This notable victory, an early one for the allies in open combat, sparked widespread celebrations. It not only shattered the myth of Spanish invincibility but also showcased how much the individual fighting skills of both sides had evolved during the war. After Archduke Ernest's passing in 1595, Archduke Albert took over the Netherlands' rule. Unlike his predecessors, he lacked accomplished generals and had demoralized troops. Spain's drained coffers, coupled with military setbacks, forced Philip to seek peace with France and England. Henry IV swiftly embraced Philip's terms to end France's internal strife, despite objections from English and Dutch envoys. A new pact between England and the Netherlands eased financial burdens. The subsequent offensive campaign, led by Sir Francis Vere and Dutch forces, proved pivotal in repelling Spanish invasions.|"[""1.

Towards the evening, news came from Ostend, nine miles away, that the enemy had gathered before a recently captured fort. Most officers thought it was a small Spanish force trying to trick the Dutch into abandoning the siege of Nieuport. Sir Francis Vere disagreed, believing it was the main Spanish army. He urged Prince Maurice to march back with the full force to confront them. Despite Vere's advice, Maurice sent a smaller group to block the enemy, resulting in heavy losses. The next morning, the army positioned themselves among the sand hills by the sea, facing the advancing Spanish army. Vere strategically placed his men on the East and West Hills, ready for battle. A council decided to wait for the attack, which Vere supported. When the battle began, Vere's division held the frontline, engaging in a fierce fight until reinforcements could arrive.|"[""1.

In the battle at Nieuport, Sir Francis Vere led his English troops against a much larger Spanish army. Despite being outnumbered, the English forces fought bravely under Vere's command. The Spanish cavalry advanced but were met with a fierce defense from musketeers and cannons. Vere strategically positioned his men to attack the Spaniards from multiple angles, forcing them to retreat. The Spanish army regrouped and tried to drive the English back, but Vere's troops held their ground. Eventually, the Dutch reinforcements arrived, and a combined effort pushed the Spaniards back. The battle was intense, with Vere fighting alongside his soldiers despite being injured. The Spanish forces were eventually defeated, securing the independence of Holland.

Sir Francis Vere was wounded and had to rest for months. Among the officers who fought with him at Nieuport were Fairfax, Ogle, Lambart, and Parker, who later became famous in England's civil conflict. Lionel Vickars, wounded at East Hill, was knighted for his bravery at the battle but had to return to England to heal. During his recovery, he stayed with Geoffrey in London. Juan Mendez had joined them, and their business was thriving. Dolores missed the outdoors, so they moved to a large house in Chelsea. Geoffrey and Juan Mendez improved trade by redirecting it from Spain to England. Geoffrey became a prominent London merchant.

Geoffrey and Gerald, old friends, reunited after years of separation due to war and misfortune. Gerald, once pardoned, sought to restore his lost estates. With Geoffrey's help, Sir Francis Vere intervened, securing the return of Gerald's lands. Inez and Dolores, their wives, became close friends.

For a while, the men stood together, hands clasped, moved by their reunion. Tears streamed down the sailor's weathered face, and Geoffrey was speechless. They had shared two years as brothers, facing dangers and hardships. Stephen had saved Geoffrey from slavery in Barbary. The Spaniard, grateful, had searched for Stephen, sending messages to find him. Stephen, now home after a rough five years, rushed to London to reunite with Geoffrey. Stephen recounted his adventures, escaping Spanish captors and finding refuge with natives. Initially mistaken for a Spaniard, he convinced them of his English identity. The natives, also slaves, welcomed him after he rejected the crucifix. Their shared distrust of the Spanish bonded them, leading to Stephen's unexpected rescue.|"['1.

After years spent among the natives, aiding them in their struggles against the Spanish, I found myself marooned on a key after a storm at sea. Surviving on turtles and rainwater, I caught the attention of a passing Spanish ship and was taken to Porto Rico. Suspected of being a criminal, I was imprisoned and later forced to work on fortifications. Escaping, I managed to stow away on an English ship.

The silver was divided before we anchored, with each man receiving their share, and the officers theirs accordingly. I got over a thousand pounds, needing two strong men to carry it to the owners' office in London. Stephen decided to return to Devonshire to find remaining friends, not expecting many to be alive after fifteen years. He expressed a desire to work under Geoffrey without pay, aiding in loading and unloading vessels. Stephen later decided to settle down on a small estate due to his cousin's request. Despite not joining Geoffrey's service, Stephen visited him yearly in London. In 1601, the Archduke Albert besieged Ostend, defended by ramparts and ditches. The town's fortifications were challenged by Spanish troops, and Sir Francis Vere reinforced the garrison. Ostend's defence was crucial, and the Spanish troops positioned themselves strategically around the town.|"['1.

The town's vulnerable side was the low sandy flat north of Ostend. The Spaniards aimed their attacks here, across the shallow Old Haven. Defences included the Porc Espic and Helmond. North of the ditch were three works, with the Sand Hill fort opposite. Major bastions were Schottenburg, Moses' Table, and Flamenburg. Vere fortified the Polder field and created a sea passage to bypass the Geule. To distract the enemy, he stationed troops to fire upon incoming boats.

On the 12th, a hard frost began, and a strong gale blew from the southeast until Christmas. The town was cut off, with dwindling defenders and scarce ammunition. It took 4000 men to guard all walls and forts, but only 2500 were fit for duty. The archduke planned an imminent assault, and Vere feared they couldn't hold. Vere consulted officers on defending all areas with the current numbers or withdrawing to protect the town. Most officers wanted to hold all positions, despite insufficient troops. Vere, however, chose to send a message seeking dialogue with the archduke. This led to a delay in the attack. Later, reinforcements arrived, and negotiations were cut short.

In early January, the English general, Sir Francis, was alerted to enemy preparations for an assault. The Spaniards bombarded the forts with cannon fire, causing widespread destruction. The enemy planned a multi-pronged attack on various points defended by the English troops. Sir Francis and his men, including Sir Horace Vere and Sir Charles Fairfax, prepared for the assault. They strategically placed troops and defenses, such as barrels of ashes and stones, to repel the attackers. When the enemy launched their assault, they faced a fierce defense from the English forces. Despite the enemy's efforts, the English successfully repelled the attack, causing heavy losses to the Spaniards and securing the town's defense.
