Fred Samson, a sick sailor, was resting in a cot due to his illness. He appeared to be slowly dying from a disease. Despite his condition, he wanted to send a message and a packet to his mother through a kind visitor. He expressed his love and final thoughts, acknowledging his trust in God.

Captain Stride, upon hearing the news of a crew member's death, swiftly decided to use the sailor's berth as a makeshift coffin due to the urgency of the situation. The approaching storm was causing the ship to be lifted and dropped by the swell, signaling imminent danger. The crew quickly prepared three boats with provisions. Charlie was assigned to the long-boat with the captain and others. As the storm intensified, the boats were separated, making it challenging to reunite. Despite the challenges, the crew remained vigilant, using tarpaulins to shield the boats from swamping. After a stormy night, only one boat remained, with the crew realizing they were alone at sea. The men, despite their weariness, stayed alert, with some searching for matches to light their pipes, only to find none, leading to a sense of shared concern among the crew.|"[""1.

Charlie Brooke had been consoling a dying boy all day, whispering comforting words from God's book. The mate, grim and silent, seemed indifferent. The dying boy was too weak to notice. A can of paraffin oil was mistaken for something else and avoided as poisonous. That night, Jim drank from the can, went mad, and lunged at the cabin-boy with a knife.

"""I'm glad to see you, dear Shank,"" said careworn Mrs. Leather, laying her knitting-needles on the table; ""you _know_ I'm always glad to see you, but I'm naturally surprised, for this visit is out of your regular time.""

The youth was considerably changed since we last met him. The year which had passed had developed him into a man, and clothed his upper lip with something visible to the naked eye. It had also lengthened his limbs, deepened his chest, and broadened his shoulders. But here the change for the better ended. In that space of time there had come over him a decided air of dissipation, and the freshness suitable to youth had disappeared.

""Yes, sir,"" said Shank, rudely interrupting, ""and I came here not so much to hear what you have to say about my outbreak--as you are pleased to style a little jollification--as to tell you that you had better provide yourself with another clerk, for I don't intend to return to your office.

It was evident that the youth was, even at that moment, under the influence of his great enemy, else his better feelings would have prevented him from speaking so rudely to a man who had never shown him anything but kindness.

May's transformation from a girl to a young woman surprised the Captain. Her curly brown hair, once wild, was now elegantly styled. Although unchanged in many ways, a hint of sadness added to her allure. The Captain, meeting her at the door, caused May to blush and nearly faint, saved only by his quick actions.

The remark caused laughter, sparking a lively debate comparing the merits of two races until a galloping horse interrupted. A tall Englishman entered, armed but unfamiliar with local customs. He sought shelter for the night but was warned about the dangerous Traitor's Trap. Undeterred, he intended to venture into the perilous area alone. A cow-boy recounted a near-death experience at the trap, advising against going there. Despite the warnings, the Englishman intended to face the danger head-on.

At that instant, the Englishman returned, settled in his corner, laid out his blanket, covered his eyes with his hat, and prepared to rest, seemingly oblivious to the events unfolding. The cowboy attempted to discreetly signal the Englishman's attention towards Buck Tom, but to no avail. The landlord then informed the Englishman of his account balance, revealing a debit of $299 and a credit of $1.10. Buck Tom's expression darkened upon hearing this, and he hesitated briefly before heading for the door, where the landlord stopped him. Buck Tom left with a promise to settle the account in his own way. As the company in the tavern recovered, they heard Buck Tom's horse galloping towards Traitor's Trap.

Warned by his companion, the young man tightly held the reins and stayed close to his guide. The moon was hidden by clouds, casting a dim, eerie light on the steep cliffs and towering mountains, creating an almost tangible darkness.

Charlie felt uneasy about joining the outlaws to fight a group of unknown Indians. Despite his doubts, the urgency of the situation pushed him to act quickly. He saddled his horse and rushed to save his friend, Dick Darvall, who was in danger at a ranch with women. As they rode towards the ranch, Charlie realized the fierce nature of the outlaws he was riding with, but he also felt a sense of duty to protect his friend and the innocent people at the ranch. Meanwhile, United States troops and a band of Indians led by Bigfoot were also converging on the same location. Mary Jackson, the daughter of a ranch owner, had caught the eye of Dick Darvall, who quickly fell for her. Despite their mutual feelings, they both remained reserved, while Mary's father, Roaring Bull, subtly encouraged their relationship, hoping for a wedding to strengthen their family ties.|"[""1.

"""Alright, Dick, don't worry about Buttercup. She fights bravely like a fierce tiger. She's almost as good as a man, but she can't aim well, so giving her a rifle is useless.

After the moon set, the ranch fell silent. Horses stood ready in the shed, saddled for a quick escape. Jackson planned to dash through foes if needed. For hours, the three men waited, but no enemy appeared. The dark woods' outline was barely visible against the sky. Dick, not used to this, imagined threats. He almost fired many times but remembered not to shoot at nothing. The stockade, made by an eccentric genius, was sturdy with boards for protection. Mary and Buttercup watched from a window, armed with an ancient blunderbuss. Mary instructed Buttercup carefully. Inside, a pot of water bubbled on a hidden stove. Suddenly, Dick spotted a real threat and fired, alerting his comrades. Chaos erupted as rifles fired, and Buttercup's blunderbuss surprised the attackers.|['1.

The swift defense made the Indians retreat to the woods for a possible strategy session. A young girl, armed with fresh rifles, rushed to the fighters, swapped weapons, and reloaded the rifles. As dawn approached, Jackson faced a dilemma: defend the fort's walls in the dark or risk attackers infiltrating the outbuildings. Suddenly, a shot grazed him as Bigfoot, a savage chief, breached the stockade. A fierce battle ensued, with Bigfoot subdued by Jackson. Despite repelling the initial attack, more Indians scaled the walls. Dick thwarted one near the house, while the defenders held off the assailants. As daylight exposed the attackers, they retreated, realizing the peril of further attempts. The defenders maintained their positions, repelling the savages' assaults.|"[""1.

Buttercup, in the room below, had a better view from her window, but she was not skilled in combat to aim the blunderbuss effectively down. She trusted her leader and awaited orders calmly. When Mary left to get more rifles, Buttercup smiled slightly. Suddenly, a loud yell and a stampede of the attackers ensued. The negress, taking the blunderbuss, fired, causing chaos but not hitting anyone. The ranch owner hoped to hold off the Indians until help arrived. A cheer and gunfire in the woods signaled the arrival of reinforcements. Jackson and his companions sprang into action, devising a plan to fend off the attackers. As they opened the gate, a shot was fired at Jackson, but Crux swiftly retaliated, injuring an Indian. With a battle cry, they drove the remaining attackers away.|"[""1.

In the midst of a sudden attack, Jackson and his team swiftly mounted their horses and rode towards the sound of battle. Surprised to find the combatants were not their own men, they braced for the fight. With ammunition running low, they formed a protective triangle with the girls in the center. As the Indians circled, trying to capture them alive, the situation seemed dire. Just then, a turn of events in the battle's favor saw another group of whites joining the fray.

The Indians quickly fled as the fight turned into a rout. Troopers, outlaws, travelers, and cowboys chased after them. The cavalry rode fast but the mustangs left them behind. When the forces regrouped, none of the outlaws returned. A wounded man was brought forward, suspected of being part of the outlaw band. He was taken prisoner despite his innocence. Charlie and Jake were locked up, and breakfast was prepared for everyone. Hunky Ben, a self-taught surgeon, attended to the wounded. Jackson sympathized with Dick, assuring him they would help Charlie prove his innocence.

At this point, the brave horse stumbled, nearly throwing off its rider. The rider, with angry words, spurred the horse fiercely, causing blood to mix with the foam. It was a rare sight to see the horse urged to such extreme efforts, reminiscent of a time when Captain Wilmot had to flee from danger. However, the Captain's urging had never been cruel, unlike now. The horse, gasping and sobbing, tried to climb the steep gorge, but the rider's unmerciful prodding only caused more distress. Unfortunately, the horse tripped over a root, sending the rider flying over its head. The rider, Jake, landed face-first, bloodied and stunned.

Dick's plan worked as he fired rapidly, creating noise and smoke like a whole company of riflemen. The Indians halted as Dick's shooting scared them. When his last cartridge was spent, he fled on his horse, Black Polly, reloading on the go. His recklessness made him cool under pressure. As the Indians closed in, Dick fired, causing them to split up. He cleverly shot alternately, forcing the Indians to avoid hitting each other. After using up his ammo, he fled again. Reaching a knoll, he saw the ranch and decided to make his final stand. The Indians tried to surround him, but Dick outmaneuvered them on Black Polly.

Jackson quickly returned to Mary's side, followed closely by Dick Darvall. A sudden pistol shot startled them as Jackson shot Dick's horse, causing it to collapse. With a determined command, Jackson instructed Dick to bind the horse's hind-legs. Understanding the plan, Dick and Jackson swiftly maneuvered the horse onto its side, creating a shield for Mary. As the savages approached, both men armed with rifles repelled the attackers. In the midst of the chaos, Jackson and Dick shielded Mary, urging her to lie low behind her pony. The men engaged in a fierce exchange of fire with the savages until reinforcements arrived. A group of cowboys and troopers appeared on the horizon, driving the attackers away.

"""I'm so grateful I didn't hurt Black Polly,"" Dick expressed as they freed the mare's feet. ""I wouldn't have been able to face Hunky Ben again."" They walked to Roaring Bull's ranch as the troops and cowboys drove the Native Americans back into the mountains.

The next day, Dick Darvall rode off to Traitor's Trap, leaving behind his heart and a reputation for bravery. As he approached the cave, he found his friends in better spirits. Buck Tom was recovering thanks to Hunky Ben's care, and Leather was uplifted by the hope of his friend's recovery. Despite Shank's obliviousness to Buck Tom's fate, the outlaw remained resolute and concealed his emotions. When a letter arrived, Buck Tom's reaction was fleeting, but noticeable. As the group read their letters, Dick shared a summary of his trip to the ranch. Charlie then mentioned a letter from Jacob Crossley, the owner of the _Walrus_, expressing relief at Dick's safe arrival in New York and hoping for Leather's recovery.|"[""1.

Charlie and the scout discussed the concept of free will and responsibility while walking through the woods. The scout explained that while individuals are free to will their actions, they may not always be free to carry them out. He used the example of cutting off a leg and not being able to sew it back on to illustrate his point. The scout believed that while individuals are responsible for their deeds, they can seek escape from the consequences through God's help.

The scout led Charlie Brooke through the woods at a fast pace, testing his endurance. After walking about four miles in silence, they found an open space with fresh ashes from a campfire, indicating recent visitors. The scout speculated that the visitors had left to explore elsewhere, which was fortunate for them. Meanwhile, Buck Tom, lying in a cave, suddenly deteriorated. He confessed his love for Shank's sister and expressed remorse for his actions. Shank held his hand as Buck Tom passed away. Later that evening, Brooke and the scout discovered Buck Tom's death in the cave. However, their attention shifted when a group of horsemen, led by the cowboy Crux, arrived. They were on the hunt for the outlaw Jake Flint, who had committed heinous crimes, sparking the fury of the townspeople.

That night, the avengers sought Jake the Flint and rested near the outlaws' cave. The chief of the outlaws rested in eternal sleep in a shed outside. A scout checked on the body and saw a figure near it. Ben, unafraid, approached silently. It was Shank Leather mourning beside Buck Tom. Shank sobbed deeply, and the scout left quietly. Jake, a dangerous outlaw, led his men to a town for a wild night. They fired wildly, causing panic. After looting and drinking, they fled. At dawn, they encountered Red men seeking revenge for a senseless murder. The outlaws were captured, with Jake tied to a stake. The Indians, silent with rage, stripped him as punishment. Jake's fate was sealed, and his comrades watched in horror, knowing what awaited him.|"[""1.

The leader then used his sharp knife to cut a strip of skin from Jake's back, causing him immense pain. Despite Jake's cries, the Red men showed no mercy as they continued their cruel act.

The next day, Crux and his group rode to the town to gather information about the outlaws. They stumbled upon Jake's mutilated body tied to a spear.

The only thing he remembered was when Mr. Leather dropped his ticket and couldn't afford a new one. Mr. Leather had asked for one on trust, which the clerk couldn't provide. Luckily, a porter found and returned the ticket. Armed with this small lead, Charlie Brooke went to Scotland Yard to report the missing man. He then visited the London City Mission and met a helpful secretary who connected him with a missionary familiar with the Whitechapel area. Despite warnings of danger and attention, Charlie wanted to explore the area. With the missionary's guidance, he visited lodging houses and learned about the rules and prices. Finally, he settled into a modest room with a kind landlady who assured him of the bed's sturdiness and offered tea and a fire.|"[""1.

Charlie looked steadily in the honest, pale, careworn face of his companion for a few seconds without speaking. Poverty, it is said, brings together strange bedfellows. Not less, perhaps, does it lead to unlikely confidants. Under a sudden impulse, our hero revealed to poor Zook the cause of his being there—concealing nothing except names.

Charlie was delighted to see the poor man, Zook, enjoy a meal that he rarely experienced. Zook's gratitude was evident as he ate heartily, his watery eyes reflecting both appreciation and chronic cold. Zook shared how he left his previous job, feeling foolish, and ended up under the care of Mrs. Samson. Charlie sought Mrs. Samson's help to rescue a friend from alcoholism. Mrs. Samson explained her connection to Mr. Leather and how she came to be involved in helping him. She revealed that Mr. Leather sought her help secretly, and it was through a mutual acquaintance that Charlie found his way to her.
