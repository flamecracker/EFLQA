Uncle Remus decided to approach Miss Sally at the big house to inquire about the child that was sent down to him with a cloak and parasol. 'Tildy mentioned that Miss Sally was concerned about lightning striking the place, which led to her sending 'Tildy down with the items. Uncle Remus then shared a story about two plantations that held a party for their fowls. The fowls marched in a line led by Mr. Rooster, but upon reaching the dining table, all they found was cornbread. Mr. Rooster strutted off, unimpressed, but later realized there was a hidden feast beneath the cornbread. Despite the other fowls calling him back, Mr. Rooster's pride led him to walk away, only to regret it later. Uncle Remus continued to entertain the little boy with tales of Brother Rabbit.|"[""1.

One day, Uncle Remus told a story about Brer Rabbit and his clever tricks. Brer Fox invited other animals like Brer Bear and Brer Wolf to his house, but he didn't invite Brer Rabbit. However, Brer Rabbit found out and decided to go anyway for some fun. While the other animals were at Brer Fox's house, Brer Rabbit played a trick. He used a drum to make thunder-like sounds that scared everyone away. Brer Rabbit then went to Brer Fox's house, drank some of the liquor, and had a good time. The other animals, listening from afar, got scared by the drum's sounds and fled. In the end, Brer Rabbit outsmarted them all with his clever plan.|"[""1.

It appears that Brer Rabbit had a bit too much to drink, but he managed to keep his wits about him when he spotted Brer Fox nearby. He pretended to be more intoxicated than he was, stumbling around and acting like a loose rag. Approaching Brer Fox, he greeted him and inquired about his health. When the other creatures arrived, Brer Rabbit put on a show, claiming he was scared and begging not to be thrown into the spring branch because he couldn't swim. However, the animals decided to drown him, with Brer Fox eagerly agreeing. As Brer Rabbit was thrown in, he cleverly used a walking cane to keep himself afloat in the shallow water.

"Once upon a time, there was a clever old turtle named Brer Tarrypin. He loved honey more than anything, but his slow nature made it hard for him to find it.

As they embarked on their honey-seeking adventure, Brer Tarrypin stumbled upon a bumblebee nest. He tasted the honey and thought it wasn't the good kind everyone talked about.

Brer Buzzud flapped his wings repeatedly, fanning the fire until he burned up, except for one large feather on each wing. Brer Tarrypin used these feathers to make quills and played a lonesome tune. Brer Fox desired the quills but couldn't obtain them. Eventually, Brer Fox tricked Brer Tarrypin into showing him the quills and snatched them away. Brer Tarrypin felt upset but didn't react. The next day, Brer Fox played the tune near Brer Tarrypin, who remained silent. As Brer Fox got closer, Brer Tarrypin suddenly grabbed his foot.

One morning in the fall, Brer Rabbit was searching for bergamot in the woods to make hair grease. The cold wind made him feel lively, and he pretended to be scared when he heard the bushes rustling. Suddenly, he heard Mr. Man cutting a tree in the distance. Brer Rabbit stopped to listen. As Mr. Man kept cutting, the tree eventually fell with a loud crash. Startled, Brer Rabbit jumped and ran away as fast as he could. He met Brer Coon on his way, who saw him running and called out. Brer Rabbit kept running until he met Brer Bear, and then the rest of the animals joined in the chase, all because of the noise of the falling tree. When they reached Brer Tarrypin's house, they slowed down. Brer Tarrypin asked where they were going, and when they mentioned the terrifying racket in the woods, he laughed and said he might join them after breakfast if he heard any suspicious noise.

Suddenly, a group of Guinea hens appeared. They exchanged greetings, and Sis Cow inquired about the local news. As they chatted, they heard a strange noise from the other side of the field. The Guinea hens got agitated, just like they do nowadays, and Sis Cow raised her head to look around but saw nothing. To their surprise, a huge Lion emerged. The Guinea hens panicked, and Sis Cow was terrified. Lions prefer cow meat, and this one planned to catch Sis Cow, eat her, and take the calf to its family.|"['Question 1:\nWhat was Sis Cow doing in the field?\nA) Eating grass\nB) Shielding her calf from the hot weather\nC) Running around\nD) Chasing the Guinea hens\nE) Sleeping', ""Question 2:\nWhere did the calf stand to keep cool?\nA) In the water\nB) Under a tree\nC) In the sun\nD) In Sis Cow's shadow\nE) On a rock"", 'Question 3:\nWhat were the Guinea hens doing when they appeared?\nA) Fighting with each other\nB) Sleeping\nC) Exchanging greetings\nD) Hiding from Sis Cow\nE) Eating grass', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Sis Cow inquire about from the Guinea hens?\nA) The weather\nB) The local news\nC) Their favorite food\nD) Their names\nE) Their travel plans', 'Question 5:\nWhat did the Lion plan to do with Sis Cow and her calf?\nA) Play with them\nB) Take them to a zoo\nC) Eat Sis Cow and take the calf\nD) Protect them\nE) Join their family', 'Question 6:\nHow did Sis Cow feel when the Lion emerged?\nA) Excited\nB) Relieved\nC) Terrified\nD) Happy\nE) Curious']"|"['B) Shielding her calf from the hot weather', ""D) In Sis Cow's shadow"", 'C) Exchanging greetings', 'B) The local news', 'C) Eat Sis Cow and take the calf', 'C) Terrified']"
Once upon a time, the Lion decided to confront Sister Cow. The Guineas scattered in fear, but Sister Cow stood her ground, ready to defend herself. The Lion crept closer, looking for an opportunity to attack, but Sister Cow remained steadfast, horns pointed directly at him. As the Lion circled, Sister Cow pawed the ground, showing the whites of her eyes, and bellowed deeply. The Guineas, seeing Sister Cow's bravery, gained courage and began to support her. They took turns distracting the Lion by raising dust clouds until he was blinded. Enraged, the Lion lunged at Sister Cow, but she swiftly overpowered him.

Brer Rabbit shared a tale with the African man about a young lady who ignored him. The African man claimed to have encountered such women before and boasted he could charm them. Brer Rabbit was thrilled and jumped so high he hurt his heel. The African man challenged Brer Rabbit to make a charm bag with an elephant's tusk, an alligator's tooth, and a rice-bird bill to win the girl. Brer Rabbit first got the elephant's tusk, then the alligator's tooth, but the alligator's tooth got stuck in a pine tree.

"When Brer Rabbit felt this way, did he just sit on the ground and let the other creatures rush up and grab him? He might do that these days because times have changed. But back then, he just sat down and thought about what he was going to do. He thought and thought, and finally, he told his old lady that he was going on a journey. So, Miss Rabbit fried him some bacon and baked him a loaf of bread. Brer Rabbit packed this up in a bag, took his walking stick, and set off.

Brer Rabbit took the snake home, stewed and greased it to make it more agile. Despite his weak legs, Brer Rabbit wasn't disabled under the hat.

When they arrived, there lay old Big-Money stretched out on the river bank. This made Brer Wolf feel very pleased, and he confidently strutted around, examining Big-Money. After inspecting it thoroughly, he suggested they divide it fairly. Brer Wolf asked Brer Mink, Brer Coon, Brer 'Possum, Brer Tarrypin, and Brer Rabbit which part they wanted. They all agreed that since Brer Wolf was the biggest and heartiest with the largest appetite, he should get the first choice. Brer Wolf then asked Brer Rabbit how much of the meat an old man like him should take. Each animal made a case for how much they should receive, but eventually, they all decided to let Brer Wolf have the first pick at Big-Money.

Passersby went by, he didn't look up; creatures came to stand and watch him, he didn't look around; work, work, work, from sunrise to sundown, until that steeple was done. Then old Brer Rabbit took a deep breath, wiped his forehead, and said that if those other creatures who had been after him for so long had any advantage over him, the time had come for them to show it. With that, he went and got himself a snack, a long piece of plow-line, and instructed his old woman to put a kettle of water on the fire and stand close by, doing everything he told her not to do. Then old Brer Rabbit sat down in his rocking chair and looked out from the steeple to see how the land lay.

The young boy was always eager for a hands-on demonstration and inquired of Uncle Remus how Brother Rabbit could mimic a turkey's call. Uncle Remus rummaged through his belongings and found a reed to use as a pipe stem. Placing one end in his mouth and enclosing the other with his hands, he sucked air through the reed to imitate the turkey-hen's call, much to the delight and amazement of the boy. Uncle Remus shared stories of mimicking turkeys in the woods back in Virginia and how they had now moved away from the wild turkeys. He recounted a tale of Brother Rabbit outsmarting Mr. Wildcat and the turkeys, showcasing his cleverness. The turkeys debated whether Mr. Wildcat was dead or alive until he finally gave up and left, tired from waiting. Brother Rabbit then bid farewell and left the area, receiving a turkey wing as a gift the next day.|"[""1.

"Once upon a time, Brer Fox and Brer Wolf were walking down the road when Brer Fox mentioned that he was very hungry. Brer Wolf was surprised and asked why he was hungry when Mr. Benjamin Ram was so fat. Brer Fox admitted to eating Mr. Benjamin Ram's children but was afraid of the old creature due to his red eyes and wrinkled horns.

Brer Fox challenged Brer Wolf to go with him to get a bite of Mr. Benjamin Ram. Brer Wolf, not wanting to back out of the challenge, reluctantly went with Brer Fox to Mr. Benjamin Ram's house. However, when they arrived, Brer Wolf got scared by the wind blowing leaves and ran off, leaving Brer Fox to face Mr. Benjamin Ram alone.

Mr. Benjamin Ram appeared with his red eyes and wrinkled horns, causing Brer Wolf to flee in fear. Brer Fox laughed at Brer Wolf's cowardice and teased him for not being able to face Mr. Benjamin Ram. Brer Wolf, feeling unwell and not liking mutton, made excuses and left, while Brer Fox tied them together with a plow line to approach Mr. Benjamin Ram's house.

As they got closer, Brer Wolf panicked and ran off, dragging Brer Fox behind him until he finally got away.

Once upon a time, Brer Rabbit and Brer Wolf had a disagreement over a cow they had killed. Brer Wolf, being bigger, wanted the lion's share of the meat. However, Brer Rabbit cleverly pretended not to care but secretly felt upset. He then cooked a slice of the meat over a fire and pretended to enjoy it. Brer Wolf, suspicious of Brer Rabbit's actions, watched closely. Brer Rabbit then pretended to feel sick and groaned, scaring Brer Wolf away. Brer Rabbit then quickly stored all the beef in his smokehouse. When Brer Wolf returned with a doctor, the beef was gone, and only the sign of the fire remained.

One day, Brer Rabbit found himself in a hollow log with a hole at the other end. He kept moving through the log, darting in one end and slipping out the other without stopping to say goodbye. Meanwhile, Brer Wolf watched and laughed, resting by the entrance where Brer Rabbit went in. They set fire to the log and watched it burn until it was all gone. Afterwards, they shook hands, hoping for peace in the neighborhood. Later, Brer Wolf visited Miss Meadows and was astonished to see Brer Rabbit sitting next to one of the girls. Brer Rabbit teased Brer Wolf about the honey oozing from hollow trees and how it protects from fire. Brer Wolf begged to try it, and once inside, Brer Rabbit sealed him in as the log burned.

This caused the other creatures to laugh and clap their hands in amusement. Mr. Dog, feeling embarrassed, thought they were laughing at him, which made him growl and snap angrily. Eventually, Brer Rabbit suggested a law that all creatures with sharp teeth should eat using their claws, except Mr. Dog, Brer Wolf, and Brer Fox who disagreed.

The animals decided they needed a watchman to catch Wattle Weasel in the act. Brer Mink was the first to take on the task, but he got tired and fell asleep, allowing Wattle Weasel to steal the butter. Next, Brer Possum was appointed, but he couldn't resist laughing when Wattle Weasel tickled him, so the butter was taken again. Brer Coon tried next, but he was tricked into a race by Wattle Weasel and lost. Finally, Brer Fox was chosen, and he cleverly woke up the Killdees to distract the other animals while he sneaked out to get some food. Despite his efforts, Brer Fox also fell prey to Wattle Weasel's tricks.

Once upon a time, old Brer Wolf forgot why he was at the chinkapin tree and dashed back to find signs of Wattle Weasel nibbling the butter.

Wattle Weasel tricked Brer Bear into falling asleep by rubbing his back and scratching his sides, allowing him to steal the butter. The animals were unsure how to handle the situation. Some suggested calling Brer Rabbit or Brer Tarrypin for help. Eventually, they called Brer Rabbit, who suspected a trick but agreed to help.

They hunt all day long, and when night falls, they are so far from home that they have to camp out. They continued until they reached a creek, where they cleared the area, built a fire, and cooked their supper. After supper, they sat by the fire and told tales.

"Brer Rabbit quickly retreated into the bushes as Brer Fox dropped his pipe and rushed to his watermelon patch down by the stream. As soon as Brer Fox was out of sight, Brer Rabbit emerged from the bushes and entered the house. ""You're way smarter than I am, Brer Tarrypin - a lot smarter. You're ahead of me. I know how you got in the bag, but I have no idea how you tied yourself up in there,"" Brer Rabbit chuckled. Despite Brer Tarrypin's attempts to explain, Brer Rabbit kept laughing until he untied the bag and freed Brer Tarrypin, taking him deep into the woods. Brer Rabbit then ran off to get a large hornet's nest he had seen earlier. He covered the nest's entrance with his hand, trapping the hornets. Later, Brer Fox returned from the watermelon patch, looking furious. He stormed into the house, and Brer Rabbit and Brer Tarrypin listened intently.
