Melville rode Saladin, a spirited black pony, which he likened to the Arabian steeds of old. Skilled in horseback riding, Melville carried a breech-loading rifle slung over his shoulder and a revolver, prepared for any frontier emergency. He set out early from Barwell to bring his homesick sister, Dot, back from her uncle's. Riding the familiar trail, they crossed a shallow stream where paths converged like spokes of a wheel.

Dot's curls clustered under a jaunty hat, fluttering around her shoulders. She wore a simple dress, shoes, and stockings, with extra clothes bundled behind Melville. They paused to pick flowers and drink from a spring. As they neared home, they saw an Indian horseman in the distance. The horseman made a mysterious gesture with a blanket, leaving the siblings puzzled. Melville felt a sense of unease as they approached their house. Upon arrival, they noticed the absence of horses and cows, only ducks and chickens remained. The house was built for defense against potential Indian attacks, with narrow windows and a heavy door.

Dot was upset while Mel hesitated on the small porch. She vowed never to speak to the unkind man again. But when he peeked through the narrow window, she rushed to his side, eager to understand his odd behavior. Startled by her cry, young Clarendon turned and saw his sister by his side like a fairy. She held a paper folded like an envelope with a message from their father warning of danger. The note instructed them to leave immediately as hostile Sioux warriors were approaching. Mel read the message aloud to Dot, who stood beside him, not fully grasping the situation. They needed to follow the trail to safety, avoiding ambush and staying alert. They quickly gathered their belongings, including Dot's beloved doll Susie, before fleeing the house to escape the imminent danger.|"['1.

"Although there was an old-fashioned fireplace, the Clarendons used a large stove nearby. Curiosity led Melville to check it, and he smiled to find it still warm. The ashes inside showed some embers glowing beneath when stirred. This made Melville feel closer to his parents than before. ""Strange that I took the upper trail,"" he thought, ""and missed them. It's the first time I've been over that course in a while, and today, when I shouldn't have, I did. Luckily, no harm was done."" Melville placed his hand on the door latch, opened it, and felt a bullet graze his face. Quickly realizing the danger, he closed the door, securing it against a Sioux warrior's attempt to break in. Melville warned his sister to stay away from the window, ensuring her safety. The tension escalated as Red Feather, a notorious Sioux warrior, threatened them. Melville, brave and cautious, decided to assess the situation upstairs, where he encountered Red Feather, a dangerous foe known for his hostility towards the white settlers."|"['1.

Red Feather rode a stolen horse, stopping a hundred yards from the house, facing it. Young Clarendon realized the reason behind the confusion. Red Feather spotted them before they saw him, assuming the settlers had left. He rode back to learn about the cabin's fate. Melville missed surveying the area before entering, unaware of the Sioux warriors nearby. They aimed to attack the family. Saladin, the horse, evaded capture, outspeeding the warriors. Red Feather fired at Saladin, angering Melville. Dot obeyed Melville's instructions, aware of the danger. A Sioux quietly tried to open the door but failed. Red Feather approached the house unnoticed by Melville, planning a different approach.|"[""1.

With minimal exertion, he lifted the sash on the narrow window to the right. A wooden button halfway up secured the lower sash when raised. The house occupants neglected window security due to their narrowness. Red Feather, forgetting his recent attack, cautiously inserted his head through the window, struggling to enter the log house. As he realized the difficulty of retreat, a young girl inside prayed for their safety. Startled by the sight of the Sioux warrior, she alerted her brother, Melville. Armed and furious, Melville confronted Red Feather, who, stuck in the window, panicked. Melville, though tempted, showed mercy and didn't harm the trapped Red Feather. The Sioux, realizing his predicament, pleaded for mercy, his face reflecting fear and desperation.|"['1.

He was not hopeless but rather optimistic as he assessed the situation. Despite being surrounded by hostile Sioux, he believed the siege wouldn't last. He anticipated that his parents, who had left Barwell early, would arrive by noon and learn he had taken a different trail. Mr. Clarendon would likely gather friends for help. Feeling secure inside, he noted the sturdy door and unclimbable chimney. Suddenly, he heard faint noises near the chimney. An Indian warrior was descending the flue and landed in the room. Despite the soot-covered warrior's appearance, he boldly confronted Melville. The daring descent had left the warrior with a smudged face, indicating his aggressive intentions.|"['1.

Red Feather, once a fierce warrior, had a change of heart when he saw the innocence of Dot, a little girl praying to the Great Spirit. This unexpected act of kindness from the child made him reflect on his own actions. Melville, puzzled by this sudden shift, wondered if Red Feather could truly harm his sister. The chieftain's gesture of laying down his weapons and embracing Dot showed a softer side to him. Dot, in her pureness, accepted his affection without fear. Red Feather's actions, like firing a shot to deceive his warriors, revealed his complex nature. As he motioned for Melville and Dot to follow him upstairs, leaving his weapons behind, a sense of trust and understanding began to form between them. The chieftain's resolve to face his warriors alone hinted at a deeper motive, one that Melville could not fully grasp.|"[""1.

The chieftain's party, described as being in the Muddy Creek country, might have changed course to join Red Feather and the smaller group. The question arose: would Red Feather defend the children against his own people upon their arrival? If the five original warriors were outnumbered, Red Feather might have remained neutral. However, when the larger party arrived, Red Feather signaled Melville. The Sioux, puzzled by the silence from the cabin, were taunted by Melville. Red Feather's attempt to escape through the window was a failure, leading to his ruin. The arrival of the larger party seemed to alter Red Feather's plans. Melville decided to trust in Heaven and protect his sister Dot. He instructed Dot to watch Red Feather's movements, ready to alert him if Red Feather approached. Dot, understanding the situation better, eagerly prepared to assist her brother by keeping an eye on Red Feather from the top of the stairs.|"[""1.

The band from Muddy Creek had just arrived, a group of around twenty wild and menacing men, eager for trouble. They congregated around a man who had signaled them, discussing the events at the Clarendon cabin. The men rode back and forth, shouting and waving their rifles excitedly. No one had been hurt yet, but tensions were high. Meanwhile, inside the cabin, Dot found food, including currant jam, milk, bread, and butter left by Mrs. Clarendon. Red Feather and Melville shared the meal, with Dot making a mess of her face while eating, causing laughter among the group. As the afternoon progressed, Melville grew concerned about the settlers not arriving and pondered the consequences if they didn't show up before nightfall.|['1.

The Native American prefers to cause trouble at night, and the horsemen wouldn't be able to hide their arrival, making them vulnerable in the initial clash with the red men. The Sioux chieftain, beside a narrow window on the lower floor, devised a plan to help the brother and sister, especially the latter, in their dire situation. It was a risky plan, and he knew the odds were against its success. Despite this, he kept his thoughts hidden from Melville, who could only wait and hope for divine protection. As Melville pondered, he sensed a strange smell outside, connecting it to the war-party's silence. The Sioux set fire to Archibald Clarendon's barn, which was close to the house, ensuring the flames would spread. The barn was easily ignited due to the dry timber and stored hay, posing a threat to the house. The barn faced away from the house, hidden from view, making it an ideal target for the marauders. While the Sioux could have set fire to the house directly, it would have required more effort and time. As the Sioux and Melville conversed quietly upstairs, Dot prayed by the bed, moving the chieftain with her faith. The Sioux listened for signs of fire spreading from the barn, ensuring the safety of the house. The weather worsened, hinting at an incoming blizzard.|"['1.

"During the summer in Texas and the western plains, cold winds called ""northers"" can suddenly sweep through, posing dangers to people and animals. Red Feather offered his blanket to Dot, who declined due to it being dirty. Melville, her brother, didn't want to offend the chieftain and kept quiet. The Sioux attempted to set fire to the house, but their efforts failed. Red Feather planned to save Dot during the chaos, but Melville's fate seemed uncertain. As night fell, the Sioux lingered nearby, causing distress to Melville, who feared for his parents' safety.

The story was ruined for the youth by the chief's belief in a confrontation between Mr. Clarendon and the Sioux led by Tall Bear, a rival of Red Feather. Red Feather, unaware of Tall Bear's presence, would have taken a more assertive approach if he had known. The Sioux outside were acting suspiciously, possibly signaling the arrival of hostile forces.

When the chief arrived, he heard an intriguing tale from five warriors. They found a dwelling with occupants unprepared for a Sioux attack. Despite the cabin's defiance, Red Feather got caught while trying to enter through the window. However, the youth inside saved him. The warriors doubted the chief's change of heart toward the boy and girl. Red Feather's actions, hiding inside the house, surprised his people. He refrained from attacking, fearing it might provoke a furious response. The warriors circled the building but found no weak points for entry. The lookout reported no approaching threats except a possible rescue from the north. The Sioux then feasted on poultry before focusing on their next move.

The wind favored the barn being set on fire, with the belief that the flames would reach the house nearby. However, Providence intervened as the breeze changed direction, saving Dot and Melville for a while. They gathered embers and piled them against the house, which started to burn. The logs, damp inside from a recent rainstorm, resisted catching fire easily. The chieftain tested the logs and realized why they wouldn't burn. Just when he was about to renew the fire, a sentinel spotted horsemen approaching from the north. The Sioux couldn't identify the riders due to the darkness. The Sioux prepared for a possible confrontation, unsure if the horsemen were friends or foes. Tall Bear was surprised to find the children missing from the cabin, leaving him speechless with shock.|['1.

The warriors were on alert as the chief, Tall Bear, discovered a group of approaching horsemen led by Nat Trumbull, a renowned frontier scout. The Sioux were concerned about the white men's intentions, knowing Trumbull's reputation. With the risk of a confrontation looming, Tall Bear swiftly decided to relocate his warriors to avoid a potential conflict. Upon receiving news from a scout that the white men were moving towards their location, Tall Bear realized they needed to retreat.

The journey was going smoothly until they reached halfway, and suddenly, three mounted Indians appeared, indicating trouble ahead. The settler stopped, ready to defend. The animals were brought close as Mr. Clarendon shielded his wife from the bullets. With his gun loaded, he awaited the imminent attack. Skilled in marksmanship, he faced the warriors with respect. The Indians circled cautiously, then fired shots, prompting a return from the settler. The Indians retreated, and Mr. Clarendon learned his children were missing. A rescue party was swiftly organized with the help of Nat Trumbull and his rangers. Red Feather seized an opportunity to divert the Sioux, allowing the rescue mission to progress. The chief carried Dot discreetly, and Melville followed cautiously as they left the cabin. Red Feather's unique pace surprised Melville, who struggled to keep up as they moved swiftly to safety.|"['1.

The Sioux cautiously scanned his surroundings as he left the building, hoping to spot his pony or another warrior's. Not finding any, he couldn't linger. Red Feather kept up a brisk pace, forcing the boy to trot to keep up. Melville thought their direction was changing, but the prairie was featureless. The duo was likely headed ten miles north to the settlement. Both were vigilant, knowing they weren't safe yet. Red Feather listened intently, sensing danger nearby. After a brief pause, they resumed their journey, reaching the Upper Crossing. The Sioux's navigation skills were impeccable, guiding them through the dark without hesitation. Melville expressed gratitude, but the Sioux decided it was time to part ways, having led them to safety.|['1.

Melville cautioned his companions about the deep spots in the stream before riding in. Night had fallen by the time they reached the water. The darkness made it hard to see, and Melville could no longer spot his friend Saladin. As they waited, a bright light emerged from a neighbor's farm that had been set ablaze by Sioux warriors. Melville worried about Red Feather's delayed return. When Saladin finally reappeared, it was clear he had swum across the stream, indicating something was amiss. Other animals were now approaching the bank, and the burning buildings illuminated the opposite shore. Melville realized something unexpected was unfolding.|"['1.

In his alarm, Melville noticed the riverbank teeming with mounted Indians, three of whom had already plunged into the stream, skillfully guiding their ponies across. He marveled at their expertise, aware they were familiar with the treacherous terrain. The sudden appearance of these Sioux puzzled the lad, speculating they might be linked to the group responsible for the burning buildings. Racing against time, Melville urged his horse, Saladin, along the rugged upper trail, evading his pursuers who were hot on his heels. Despite the peril, Saladin's speed outmatched the horsemen until Melville cleverly concealed himself among rocks and bushes, out of sight. With darkness cloaking the surroundings, Melville cautiously retraced his steps, skirting the water's edge towards safety, avoiding detection by the remaining Sioux.|"['1.

Melville found himself in danger after Saladin's stumble may have revealed his location. Despite his fears, he pushed his pony onward, putting distance between him and the potential threat. Concerned about Dot's safety, Melville pondered the sudden departure of Red Feather. He suspected that the Sioux from Tall Bear's band, who had set fire to buildings, might have dispersed to search for the children. The appearance of white men in the area had likely driven the Sioux away. Mr. Clarendon's worry for Dot prompted a search effort, with Nat and others eager to help. Trumbull aimed to force Red Feather's band into a confrontation to prevent further unrest among the Sioux in Minnesota. As the situation unfolded, Trumbull strategically maneuvered his forces to provoke a decisive battle.

The Sioux scouts fleeing changed Nat Trumbull's plans. Unable to surprise them, he gathered his men and rode swiftly towards the Clarendon cabin. Trumbull hoped to arrive before the raiders could escape, wanting to punish them. Approaching cautiously, they found no enemies at the cabin. Trumbull suspected the Sioux had taken the children and headed to the Upper Crossing. Spotting an Indian running, Trumbull chased him down, eventually catching him. The Sioux warrior attempted to fight back with a knife, but Trumbull disarmed him. Recognizing his opponent as Tall Bear, Trumbull challenged him to a fair wrestling match.

The scout waited until the chief signaled he was prepared. Then, swiftly, he crouched low, grasped the other's legs below the knee firmly, and with remarkable speed and strength, he flung Tall Bear through the air like a frog. Tall Bear's head hitting the ground interrupted his words, leaving his intentions unclear. However, he recovered quickly from the impact, showing resilience to such rough handling. Within moments, Tall Bear stood up unsteadily, realizing he was now their captive. This marked the failure of the chieftain's last attempt, as he was easily apprehended by the authorities without causing serious harm. Despite destroying property, his efforts to inflict greater damage were unsuccessful. Red Feather's concern for Dot Clarendon led to his mistake, waiting with her on the southern bank for the pony to cross them to Melville on the other side.|"['1.
