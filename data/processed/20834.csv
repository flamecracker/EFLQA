On a mild midwinter day, a girl in a Red Cross uniform strolled along a grassy lane. The air was warm, the trees looked ready to bloom, and the grass stayed green.

A motor car armored at the front roared down a hill, carrying uniformed officers. The Red Cross girl, used to the colorful French Army Corps, noticed their gray, hard-bitten faces and sparse eyebrows. They saluted her as she stood by the lane. The military activity hinted at an impending enemy advance. As the girl hurried to the hospital, a young man in a major's uniform, not typically French, respectfully bowed to her. Ruth Fielding, walking with the girl, inquired about the officers and the aeroplane. The girl revealed that the man Ruth was supposed to meet was not at the front but in Paris.

"Two girls, walking side by side, approached a small gate next to a large iron fence that was rarely opened except for horses or cars. The gate had a small shutter at a man's height, as the main entrance used to be a sturdy oak door, impenetrable except by cannonballs. The thick stone wall surrounding the chateau was built centuries ago for protection. Beside the gate hung an old-fashioned rope-pull bell. Henriette tugged on it, but the sound came from far inside the chateau. The girls discussed the loyalty of the countess, defending her against rumors. Ruth Fielding, a visitor to the chateau, was confident in the countess's allegiance to France. Ruth had been involved in uncovering criminals preying on the Red Cross, an adventure detailed in a previous book titled ""Ruth Fielding in the Red Cross; or, Doing Her Best for Uncle Sam."""|"['1.

Ruth excelled in the Supply Department and earned praise, later joining a Red Cross unit in France. Helen accompanied her father on a mission to the front lines. Ruth worked at an evacuation hospital near General Pershing's forces, close to Tom Cameron's regiment. The chateau's lady, despite dwindling staff, selflessly sold her treasures to aid soldiers. The countess warmly welcomed Ruth and Henriette to her library, adorned with sold rugs and books for soldiers. The countess, still beautiful, greeted them graciously, showing kindness and generosity despite the ravages of war.|"['1.

In the cozy room, adorned only with a few family portraits, the bookcases stood empty. Madame la Countess brewed tea while thin slices of war bread lay on the table, lacking butter, sugar, and milk. To everyone's surprise, Henriette revealed a jar of thick yellow cream from her pocket, sharing it generously despite its scarcity. The mention of an old superstition about a werewolf unsettled the countess, noticed only by Ruth. As Henriette and Ruth were introduced to the countess's son, Henri, the encounter left Ruth feeling a bit flustered by his intense gaze and unfamiliar European greeting. Despite the tension, they were invited to enjoy tea with sugar and real cream, courtesy of Henriette and Ruth.|"['1.

Ruth was at ease in the company of the charming Major Marchand, but Henriette, being bashful, was enamored by the young major's captivating presence. As they left the chateau, Ruth recognized a friend, Charlie Bragg, who urgently needed supplies for a field hospital after a tragic incident. Despite the devastation caused, the American soldiers retaliated fiercely upon hearing about the Red Cross girl's death. Major Marchand bid them farewell with a respectful German bow, showing his diverse military education. Charlie, with a playful wink, and Henriette shared a laugh as they drove off, leaving behind a mix of emotions from the day's events.|"[""1.

Ruth had doubts about the loyalty of Major Henri Marchand and his older brother, the count. Their mother was lovely, but something seemed off about her sons. The younger one was idling around the chateau or in Paris, while the count had mysteriously disappeared. Neither brother was involved in dangerous work on the battlefront, making it all very strange. Ruth assured Charlie that she could handle the supplies alone at Clair, teaching someone else at the hospital. She quickly packed her bag, ready to go. Ruth smiled, offering to go in the crowded ambulance. She sat beside Charlie as they left the hospital, passing nurses bidding her farewell. The car rolled out of the gate towards the first dressing station, a risky journey ahead.|"[""1.

Ruth Fielding had been working at a hospital in France, where she was the only American among the staff. Despite her role in the supply department, she dedicated much of her time to helping the patients, assisting those who couldn't read or write. She was well-loved by everyone at the hospital, from the matron to the orderlies. As the United States Expeditionary Forces took over the sector, Ruth anticipated the arrival of American wounded soldiers. On a journey to the hospital, she passed through war-torn villages and witnessed the devastation caused by the Germans. The sights weighed heavily on her, but she found comfort in the camaraderie with her fellow American companion, Charlie. They joked about the high prices in France and the locals' perception of Americans as wealthy.|"[""1.

"Charlie Bragg suddenly stopped the car and stepped out. Ruth peered ahead with interest. The road appeared smooth and empty. A cluster of trees, scarred by gunfire, concealed a bend in the path and what lay beyond. Charlie tinkered with the car's engine. Dusk descended swiftly. The sky was cloudy, devoid of stars. Through the dimness, an ambulance sped by, the driver hunched low over the wheel, straining to see ahead. For five minutes, the heavy guns had fallen silent. Then, a bright white flare illuminated the horizon. A distant booming marked the firing of a massive gun, likely a German Bertha. ""Keep going!"" Charlie urged. ""I need to free this car from the mud. Head to the small house on the left under the bank. That's Mother Gervaise's cottage. It's safe from enemy shells."" ""I've never been hit,"" he reassured Ruth. ""I must rescue this car. The supplies must reach the field hospital. They're crucial. I can't abandon them here and flee."" The whistle of an approaching shell coincided with the distant thud of the gun. Charlie grabbed Ruth's hand, and they dashed along the road. As the shell exploded, this time far to the left of the stranded ambulance, they paused."|"['1.

"""He's trying to make me quit, huh?"" he asked firmly. ""Don't you understand, once the enemy catches you, that's it? That car has to be removed from that pit one way or another."" Ruth fell silent. This young man, whom she mentally labeled as a boy, possessed a bravery that humbled her. It was the exact kind of courage required for his wartime duties -- a hint of recklessness that prevented him from dwelling on the risks too much. Charlie Bragg had his own philosophy that kept his spirits up in the face of danger and proved highly practical in that moment.

""Yeah, I was scared at first too. But you can't let fear win. Otherwise, you'll never become a top-notch ambulance driver. I'm sure some of the guys will be at Mother Gervaise's, and I can ask for help."" Soon after, they turned a corner and Ruth spotted a faint light to the left of the road. It turned out to be an open window with the shutter thrown wide against the wall. The absence of glass in the opening was noticeable.

""Here we are,"" Charlie announced. ""You might have missed it on your own. The house is snug against the steep bank, with the hill shielding us from the front. The enemy can't target this spot. It's a safe haven for travelers. Look, there are two cars parked here. We're in good hands now."" Ruth discerned the shapes of the two cars by the"|"['1.

I learned about the boasting of men, especially Germans. A major and nobleman stayed overnight, promising to take me to Germany after the war, saying France would be absorbed by Germany.

Ruth Fielding's initial fear subsided when she recognized the faces of the newcomers, young men from the American Expeditionary Forces. They jovially teased Mother Gervaise in typical American youth fashion. As they entered the cottage, they were surprised to see Ruth at the table's end. Their voices hushed upon noticing her. Ruth, relieved, observed that they were all young officers—a youthful captain, two first lieutenants, and some subalterns. They awkwardly greeted Ruth, unable to look away. Ruth mentioned her acquaintance with Lieutenant Thomas Cameron, one of their regiment members. The officers were speechless, jokingly referring to themselves as General Haig and his staff. They hurriedly ate Mother Gervaise's food, discussing repairing cars in remote areas. Ruth struggled to eat, unsure of the challenges ahead.|"[""1.

She respectfully greeted the officers with a bow, yet warmly shook hands with the ambulance drivers. Ruth admired these young men who bravely served as ambulanciers. Many of them had volunteered in France even before the United States entered the war. They appeared to be the type of boys known in their neighborhoods as troublemakers or rebellious youths. Ruth saw them as unsung heroes, humbly denying any heroic status. Charlie, one of the ambulance drivers, was modest about his experiences, although he had written a book about them that was published in New York, with proceeds going to the Red Cross. Ruth sensed a mysterious air surrounding Tom, another driver, as if something shameful or secretive had occurred involving him. Reports circulated about an American accused of espionage, allegedly seen conversing with a German spy in no-man's-land.|"[""1.

The driver of the ambulance suddenly hit the brakes, causing the vehicle to lurch to a stop. Just ahead, a white figure darted across the road and vanished into the shadows. The locals, steeped in superstition, believed in the legend of the werewolf, a creature that could transform from a human to a wolf at will. This mysterious white figure was often spotted crossing the road near the chateau. Despite suspicions surrounding the countess, Ruth Fielding dismissed the idea of her involvement with the werewolf. She pondered the presence of Major Henri Marchand and the roaming greyhound, Bubu, at night.

In a bustling hospital compound, with numerous huts housing groups of patients cared for by diligent nurses and orderlies, Ruth observed the comings and goings of visitors. Some arrived in cars with military passes, bearing gifts for the wounded, while others walked in with homemade treats. Ruth noticed a peculiar figure, Nicko, the chocolate peddler, whose behavior seemed odd due to a past encounter with a gas bomb. The atmosphere was tense, with rumors of a looming battle. Ruth's thoughts were consumed with prayers for the safety of the soldiers, especially her friend Tom Cameron, as the guns roared in the distance.

In this area, the search for news about the missing lieutenant was futile. Many believed Tom Cameron had betrayed his country for personal gain and joined the enemy.

Devil Corner Charlie Bragg, the spot you passed the other night, has been devastated by shells. To reach Clair, we now have to take a detour of about two miles. The route no longer goes by Mother Gervaise's place. Holdness, feeling uncomfortable, stated he had no opinion on the matter. Suspicion arose as someone had mapped the area for the enemy, resulting in casualties and wasted ammunition. At Clair Hospital, Ruth Fielding was warmly received. She promptly sent a message to the police in Lyse, signed with her full name and occupation. Days passed with no response from the police or news from the field hospital or front lines.

Ruth was confident that Henriette and her family would realize their mistake and become friendly with her again. The Latin nature is easily offended but fair. Ruth listened in amazement as an old man excitedly described Major Marchand flying in a machine. She remembered the paper bomb dropped from the plane that carried Tom Cameron's message. Ruth was puzzled by how Major Marchand got the message and his connection to Tom. She pondered where Tom was and where the major flew to.

The young girl, Ruth, regretted not confiding in Monsieur Lafrane about her concerns for Tom Cameron. She wished she had sought his advice. However, the countess interrupted her thoughts as she strolled in the courtyard, humming a cheerful tune. The countess greeted Ruth warmly, expressing her delight in their friendship. She then proudly spoke of her sons, Henri and another unnamed son, saying they resembled her. Ruth noticed a greyhound sprinting past the chateau, realizing it was Bubu, who had likely traveled from the battle front. Ruth pondered what would happen to Bubu now that he had returned.

The dog gazed at her with a wide mouth and hanging tongue, but he didn't bother her. Instead, he lowered his head and tried to lick up the water from the stones with his pink tongue. The elderly man approached with a broad leather strap connected to a chain adorned with large brass rivets. He fastened it around the panting dog's neck, and the dog licked her hands. Ruth watched in astonishment as she reached into the dog's mouth and extracted a white rubber cap from one of his teeth. With a knitting needle, the countess skillfully removed what looked like an oiled paper twist from the rubber cap. She then patted the dog with her slipper, and he yawned before resting his head on his paws, still panting heavily. Ruth sensed the countess trusted her with important information. She realized that Bubu wasn't carrying messages to aid the enemy, easing her suspicions. Ruth refrained from asking questions, as the countess seemed to assume she was aware of Bubu's purpose. Monsieur Lafrane, the French secret service agent, had brought Ruth to the chateau, a fact known to the countess. The countess explained that Monsieur Lafrane always sent her messages, ensuring his safety. She hinted that the messages contained more than just cheerful words, implying a deeper purpose.

My husband, a wise man, avoided political schemes and instead supported the Republic. Count Marchand owned a small estate near Merz, just over the German border. He'd visit for the waters or hunting, taking his dog Bubu. We trained Bubu to carry messages between the two places, using a hollow tooth to hide them. Thanks to an American dentist in Paris, we made the tooth secure for sending messages. Count Allaire now sends messages beyond German lines, having disguised himself and crossed over recently. The countess mentioned the challenging terrain between the armies, like the lake and swampland of Savoie, where patrols move back and forth, making it easier for messengers like Bubu to pass undetected.|"['1.

She was not found. They stood on the surface. Major Marchand held her hand and led her away quietly. The ground looked gray, surrounded by the black night. No lights were visible. Despite the darkness, she sensed they were on the lowland beyond the ridge they had tunneled through with Sergeant Tremp. As her eyes adjusted, she glimpsed water below, likely the lake mentioned by Major Marchand. After an unexpected eruption, they remained still.

They continued walking steadily. As they progressed, the path turned soft and sticky. She found herself sinking ankle-deep into the mire, then gradually deeper until the mud and water reached her knees. Eventually, she trudged through the morass, panting heavily. Soon, she managed to walk alongside him on firmer ground, conserving her energy for the journey ahead. Approaching a wire entanglement resembling those on the American side, they navigated through a narrow opening created for patrols. Ruth followed suit through the wires, crossing a field where they faced another challenge. After a brief discussion with a sergeant, they were permitted to proceed.

She paced back and forth in the small hut, attempting to adjust her stride to match her new role, a challenging task. Eventually, she approached the door, illuminated by the lamplight, casting her figure boldly against the frame. Observing the major waiting, she noticed him react and mutter something quietly. Retrieving a leather roll from his pocket, he revealed shaving tools and cosmetics. Using a brush dipped in grease paint, he darkened her lips and cheekbones, creating a more masculine appearance. Glancing at her reflection, she saw the transformation. The major chuckled as he packed up their belongings, erasing any traces of their presence in the hut. After extinguishing the lamp, they left discreetly, guided by the Frenchman through the woods to a bustling inn. Major Marchand advised her to maintain a low profile among the Crown Prince's associates. They secured a car for their journey, with Ruth assuming the persona of Sub-Lieutenant Louden. As they set off, she rested, fatigued from their recent endeavors. Ruth recognized the young count upon their arrival, and Major Marchand introduced her to him warmly in the dimly lit hall.|"['1.
