The previous day had seen rain, leaving the ground under the dense trees and brush quite marshy. As they navigated carefully, Mollie led the way while chatting with her friend Barbara.

Barbara blushed and hesitantly asked Mr. Stuart for a favor regarding some neglected business papers left by her late father. Mr. Stuart, a successful man, carefully examined the papers with the same attention he would give his own affairs. Suddenly, he found a promissory note signed by Ralph Le Baron, owing five thousand dollars to his brother-in-law, John Thurston. As they discussed the matter, Mrs. Thurston, looking distressed, overheard and was shocked by the revelation. She claimed ignorance of the debt and was taken aback by the news.

Mr. Stuart pondered the situation, considering the debt and Ralph Le Baron's actions. He questioned whether the law required the debt to be paid after so many years without prior claims. Determined to uncover the truth, he took a trip to New York with Mr. Le Baron. The next morning, he arranged for Mrs. Thurston and Barbara to join them for dinner. Despite the Le Barons' cold reception, Gladys showed a kinder side towards Barbara. When Ralph arrived for the meeting, he avoided eye contact and greeted his sister with a cold tone. Barbara observed him closely, noting his tall, thin frame and sharp features.|"[""1.

Mr. Stuart addressed Mrs. Thurston about her brother's denial of borrowing $5,000. Initially, her brother claimed he never received the money until shown the note. He then argued the debt was forgotten after her husband's passing. Mrs. Thurston found it odd and mentioned they needed the money. Her uncle, Ralph Le Baron, coldly stated he had no intention of repaying the debt due to a law that excuses debts after six years without a request for payment. Mr. Stuart intervened, accusing Ralph of deceit for not repaying his sister. He highlighted the injustice of Ralph's actions and suggested involving legal help to investigate the matter further.|"[""1.

Mr. Stuart shared the whole story with Gladys. She stood silently, her face flushed. Barbara watched tearfully. After Mr. Stuart finished, he regretfully mentioned Mrs. Thurston taking the case to court. Overcome with emotion, Gladys wept. She then proposed giving her $5,000 birthday gift to Aunt Mollie to settle the debt, feeling it was the right thing to do. Her father, Ralph Le Baron, initially hesitant, eventually agreed to return the money to his sister, setting aside business principles for sentiment. Mrs. Thurston and Barbara were relieved.

Barbara playfully teased the passengers in the car, urging Miss Sallie Stuart to leave the chauffeur be. Miss Stuart preferred the idea of a hotel over a log cabin in the woods. Determined to make the trip comfortable, she insisted they head to the best hotel in Lenox for their mountain adventure. Bab whispered to Ruth about finding guides and wagons at the foot of the hill.

"""Ruth!"" she called from her throne on the wagon seat. ""Here is a perfectly good place for our lunch. There is water near and view enough, I am sure. I must be given food before I am taken another step up these hills. I am famished!"" The party found a clear space in the woods. In a short time Naki had built a fire of pine twigs, and Ceally had a giant pot of coffee boiling over it. Its delicious perfume mingled with the fresh mountain air. ""I declare I haven't been so hungry since I was a girl,"" Miss Sallie avowed. She was seated on a log, with a sandwich in one hand and a cup of coffee on the ground by her. Her hat was on one side of her head, and her pompadour drooped dejectedly, but Miss Sallie was blissfully unconscious.

Nothing could induce her to keep still. ""Do let me get the water,"" she coaxed the guide. Like a flash she was off and back bearing a heavy bucket.

By nightfall, the small house in the woods was fully prepared for living. The girls, with the help of Naki and his wife, worked hard to make it cozy. Miss Sallie gave instructions by the warm fire in the living room. Next to the living room were two bedrooms. Further back, Naki and Ceally had a small room connected to the kitchen. Ruth pointed out a mirror hanging over Miss Sallie's dressing table. The girls later gathered around a campfire under the starry sky, not wanting to go to bed yet. Mollie, half-dreaming, half-listening, was intrigued by Grace's singing. The next morning, Mollie sensed an unseen presence outside the hut as she looked out at the peaceful forest.|"['1.

Mollie tiptoed back into the room, slipping into her bright red robe and slippers. Determined to uncover a mystery, she hesitated to step outside, wary of Miss Sallie's cautionary tales of wolves and wild cats. Despite her apprehension, Mollie ventured onto the small porch. Peering through the trees, she spotted a swift, slender figure darting up the hillside like a deer. Was it a person or a mythical being? Mollie couldn't discern. The fleeting glimpse left her intrigued, with only a blur of motion and a flash of colors in her sight. Later, during breakfast, Ruth praised Ceally's bacon cooked over an open fire, prompting Miss Stuart's amusement at their hearty appetites. Eager to explore the forbidden hill, Mollie and Bab discussed their plans, while Ruth arranged for an afternoon adventure to the post office with Naki's guidance on campfire building.|"[""1.

Mollie sat on a pile of leaves under a cedar tree as the September day faded. She had spent the day wandering alone in the woods, unsure of how far she had gone. Despite her weariness, she remained brave, not shedding a tear even when close to tears. As the cold set in, Mollie pondered the possibility of staying in the woods overnight, wishing she knew how to make a fire. Suddenly, a mysterious figure appeared but vanished quickly as Mollie slept deeply. Meanwhile, Ruth, Bab, and Grace were practicing under Naki's guidance. Unaware of Mollie's absence, they continued until lunchtime. Miss Sallie, concerned, instructed the girls to eat and not search for Mollie on empty stomachs. She feared for Mollie's safety, especially with the haunted mountain nearby, where tales of a ghost lingered.|"['1.

Searching for missing individuals in the woods was a familiar task for the guide. Disregarding Mollie's disappearance due to her disobedience, he blew a horn thrice but received no reply. Realizing Mollie was out of earshot, he made a crucial error by heading in the wrong direction instead of into the woods where she had strayed. Bab, feeling remorseful for quarreling with Mollie earlier, expressed her regret. As dusk approached, the group returned to their cabin without Mollie in sight. The guide, Naki, suggested Ruth return home while he sought help for a thorough search due to the dense underbrush.

Ruth and Grace were upset by the situation but pretended to be offended to comfort Bab. Ruth asked Grace to go to Aunt Sallie while she stayed with Bab.

Ruth and Bab hurried to the location where they found a fire burning in a small clearing. There, they discovered a girl, Mollie, sitting on a bed of autumn leaves, rubbing her eyes. Bab noticed Mollie's scarlet coat and yellow curls. Mollie explained she didn't know how to light a fire without matches and asked to be taken home. Ruth found Grace's sweater near Mollie, which puzzled them. As they guided Mollie home through the forest, Ruth's torn paper pieces acted as markers.

"Bab nodded and thoughtfully replied, ""Mollie knows less about it than the rest of us. She was sitting quietly at the bottom of the ravine when leaves showered over her, and she heard feet running above. Curious, she climbed up but got lost wandering all day until she rested.

Miss Stuart agreed to Mr. Latham's invite, feeling bored with life on the hill. Although she was hesitant about the journey, Mr. Latham's property was conveniently located between the hill and Lenox town. Ruth playfully teased Miss Stuart about her liking for Mr. Latham and the amazing features of his place. However, Mollie, who was facing consequences for breaking camp rules, declined the invitation due to being tired. Despite Mollie's protests, Miss Stuart encouraged her to join the group. Mollie insisted that Bab should not stay back with her, highlighting Bab's heroic role in a past rescue mission.

Mollie watched them leave for Mr. Latham's, then went back to her cozy cabin. Resting on her cot, she felt refreshed after her ordeal. The autumn afternoon was bright, leaves rustling in the wind. Mollie thought of the leaves' farewell song, like a swan's. She imagined the leaf bidding goodbye to the tree, heading to an unknown land below.

A young girl, about the same age as Mollie, appeared in front of her. Her hair was long and black, falling over her shoulders. Her cheeks had a deep red color, and her complexion was unique, not quite olive, brown, or red. She wore a soft garment that fit snugly from her neck to her ankles, with a crimson scarf tied around her waist. On her head, she had a striking wreath made of bright autumn leaves. The girl's dark face lit up with a smile as she reassured Mollie that she was not afraid. Speaking English with an unfamiliar guttural tone, the girl asked if Mollie was well.

Aunt Sallie anxiously inquired if Mr. Latham was confident about the expedition. She stood by the door, ensuring the group was ready to depart. Before they left, she instructed Hugh to watch over Ruth and Grace, and Ralph to care for Mollie and Bab. Ralph, teasingly, asked if he could also look after Miss Thurston, aiming to repay her for saving him. Amidst the excitement of the hunt, a raccoon was chased by dogs. The party split up as some dogs pursued a second raccoon. Barbara, struggling to keep up, expressed admiration for the raccoon's swimming skills. When one raccoon swam across a pond, Reginald Latham, in a rush, accidentally fell into the water. Barbara, unimpressed by the shallow water, helped him out.|"['1.

Bab and Mr. Latham found themselves in a muddy situation after a hunting trip. Bab felt sympathetic towards the raccoon they were hunting, admitting she wasn't a great hunter. Mr. Latham, on the other hand, was fearful of water and was grateful for Bab taking some blame for their pond mishap. He explained his need to please his wealthy uncle.

Bab asked Naki if he should go ahead to inform Eunice's grandmother about the accident. Ruth insisted on accompanying Bab, stating that the accident was not solely Bab's fault. Naki advised them to stick together as he knew the way to the wigwam. Eunice, despite her injury, expressed her wish for Mollie to join her at the tent.

Eunice, speaking in the Indian language, caught the attention of an elderly Native American woman who emerged from the wigwam.

Ruth calmly instructed, ""Naki, go down the hill immediately and ensure a doctor comes up to examine this child's arm. While an Indian remedy for a bullet wound might be effective, I want to make sure she sees a doctor. Bab and I would never forgive ourselves if something serious happened. Go now, Naki,"" Ruth concluded, showing her authoritative side.

Eunice, smiling at Bab, reassured her, ""You'd almost blend in with us if you lived in the woods. Don't be too sorry about my arm. It was my mistake, not yours. I shouldn't have been hiding.

Ruth reassured Grace, saying that their efforts to train the pets for the upcoming event wouldn't be too stressful for the animals. She believed that the excitement of the chase would be more fun. Ruth mentioned that the pets might face a bigger shock from encounters with automobiles or carriages. She expressed excitement about the race and spotted Ralph and Hugh with the girls. Hugh jokingly questioned the tasks assigned to them in the next day's events. Dorothy explained that Ralph and Hugh were signed up for the Egg and Spoon Race, the Dummy Race, and the Thread and Needle Race. Ruth explained the details of the Thread and Needle Race, where the men had to ride on horseback with a needle while a woman sewed a button on their coat. Maud Warren, a skilled rider, overheard the conversation and subtly mocked the country girl, Bab. The Ambassador praised Ruth's traditional horseback riding style. Gwendolin Morton confirmed the schedule for the next day's events, including the Gymkana race and horseback riding and jumping after lunch.|"['1.

Miss Stuart expressed concerns about the dangers of horseback riding and the lack of ladylike behavior in jumping over fences. The day of the Lenox sports began beautifully, with clear skies and reflections of trees in the lakes at the feet of the hills. Miss Stuart and her girls watched elegant vehicles heading to the Fair Grounds from their veranda. Barbara, in a tan riding-habit borrowed from Ruth, was eager to start. Ruth and Grace, dressed for a serious race, used ribbons as reins for their turkey and rooster. At the Fair Grounds, they joined other girls for the Society Circus. Ruth's turkey was stubborn, while Grace's rooster strutted proudly, setting the stage for a lively event.|"['Question 1: What did Miss Stuart express concerns about?\nA) The lack of ladylike behavior in horseback riding\nB) The dangers of swimming in the lake\nC) The lack of elegance in the vehicles heading to the Fair Grounds\nD) The weather on the day of the Lenox sports\nE) The lack of enthusiasm from the girls', 'Question 2: How did the day of the Lenox sports begin?\nA) With heavy rain and thunderstorms\nB) With snow covering the ground\nC) Beautifully, with clear skies and reflections of trees in the lakes\nD) With a strong wind blowing across the hills\nE) With a sudden earthquake shaking the area', 'Question 3: What were Ruth and Grace dressed for at the Lenox sports?\nA) A tea party\nB) A fashion show\nC) A serious race\nD) A dance competition\nE) A cooking contest', 'Question 4: What did Ruth and Grace use as reins for their turkey and rooster?\nA) Flowers\nB) Ribbons\nC) Chains\nD) Ropes\nE) Belts', ""Question 5: What event did Ruth's turkey and Grace's rooster participate in at the Fair Grounds?\nA) A talent show\nB) A magic show\nC) A pet parade\nD) The Society Circus\nE) A cooking demonstration"", ""Question 6: How did Ruth's turkey and Grace's rooster behave at the Society Circus?\nA) Ruth's turkey was proud, and Grace's rooster was stubborn\nB) Ruth's turkey was stubborn, and Grace's rooster was proud\nC) Both animals were stubborn\nD) Both animals were proud\nE) Both animals were scared""]"|"['A) The lack of ladylike behavior in horseback riding', 'C) Beautifully, with clear skies and reflections of trees in the lakes', 'C) A serious race', 'B) Ribbons', 'D) The Society Circus', ""B) Ruth's turkey was stubborn, and Grace's rooster was proud""]"
In the enclosed field in front of the stand where the Ambassador sat, two poles stood ten yards apart. Across the meadow, a short distance away, two more poles awaited. The girls aimed to guide their animals from one set of poles to the other and back. Grace's rooster led the way, while Ruth's turkey got distracted by a worm. Dorothy's goose moved gracefully, unperturbed by the chaos around. The rooster and the goose had a brief encounter, causing a commotion. As Dorothy struggled with her goose's return, a duck passed by, lured by corn. Dorothy faced a challenge getting her goose back, highlighting the age-old lesson of persistence over haste.|"['1.

Unexpected help arrived when Grace's rooster finally dashed swiftly through the required markers. During its frenzied sprint, it narrowly passed the elderly goose. Seizing the opportunity for payback, the rooster swiftly pecked at the goose's tail feathers before swiftly flying away. The startled goose whirled around with a loud squawk, taking flight momentarily before landing and charging towards the rooster. However, the rooster's erratic movements made it an elusive target, causing the frustrated goose to abandon the chase. Meanwhile, only three girls remained in the race as Ruth gave up due to her wandering turkey. Dorothy passed by a girl feeding a hen, continuing her journey with the duck. Franz Heller, carrying wreaths, accidentally dropped an egg during a spoon race mishap, while Mr. Latham's egg fell as he paused to adjust his glasses.|"[""1.
