"""Don't be upset; I'll ask mom to allow your friend Ned Miller to visit once Polly leaves,"" Fanny said, trying to calm Tom's feelings. ""If I can help it, she won't stay long,"" muttered Tom, who thought girls were unnecessary. Boys at fourteen often think this way, which might be wise. Tom felt uneasy about meeting Polly, a girl he didn't know. ""You'll have to come with me, Fan,"" he said, not keen on addressing several strange girls before finding Polly. Tom walked away, feeling sisters never do him justice. Fanny watched Tom leave, muttering about boys. Tom, after turning the corner, changed his demeanor and hurried off. He felt anxious about recognizing Polly among the crowd at the station. As he spotted a girl in a peculiar get-up, he prepared to approach her. However, he realized it wasn't Polly and walked away annoyed. Tom then noticed a cheerful girl running towards him and realized it was Polly.

Tom felt embarrassed after realizing he had acted in a way that went against his family's values. To distract himself, he decided to play a prank on the coachman, leaving Polly worried inside the carriage. When they arrived, Tom boasted to Fanny about his antics. Meanwhile, Polly, feeling uneasy about Tom's behavior, changed the subject. Fanny, attending a school focused on foreign languages, made Polly feel out of place with her different upbringing. Despite the differences, Fanny showed unexpected kindness by inviting Polly to join her at school. Fanny explained the distinctions in their lifestyles to Polly, who admired the elegance of Fanny's home but remained true to her simple style.

"Before Fanny could reply, a cry from below caught their attention. ""It's just Maud; she's been fussing all day,"" Fanny started, but before she could finish, the door burst open. A little girl, about six or seven years old, stormed in, roaring. She paused upon seeing Polly, stared briefly, then resumed her roar and flung herself into Fanny's lap, complaining angrily, ""Tom's laughing at me! Make him stop!"" Polly hoped the ""dreadful boy"" wouldn't be around, but there he was, staring at her throughout dinner, making her uncomfortable. Mr. Shaw, a busy man, greeted her briefly, while Mrs. Shaw, a pale, nervous woman, ensured Polly lacked nothing. Madam Shaw, a quiet elderly lady, remarked on Polly's resemblance to her mother, but her constant peering made Polly lose her appetite. The dinner was unpleasant, and Polly was relieved when it ended. After everyone dispersed, leaving Polly alone in the grand drawing-room, she walked around, humming to herself as the room darkened. Madam Shaw joined her, requesting an old tune. Though Polly was hesitant to sing without proper training, she respected elders and complied. Polly sang her favorite Scottish tunes, impressing Madam Shaw. Polly was surprised to see that her music had touched the old lady, and she felt pleased."|"[""1.

"""Girls, did you know that Carrie has gone abroad? There's been so much talk about it that her father couldn't bear it and took the whole family away. Isn't that exciting?"" said a lively girl who had just entered the room. ""I think it was adventurous. She was only sixteen, and her father was really wonderful. She has lots of money, and everyone was talking about it. People would stare when she walked by, and she enjoyed the attention. But her dad is quite strict, so he sent them all away. It's a shame because she was the most cheerful person I've ever known.""

Polly didn't engage with the lively Miss Belle, but Fanny remarked, ""I enjoy reading about such adventures, but it's inconvenient when it happens so close to home. I wish you could have heard my father. He threatened to send a maid to school with me every day, like they do in New York, to ensure I arrive safely. Can you believe it?"" ""That's because it came out that Carrie used to forge notes in her mother's name and go out with her boyfriend when they thought she was at school. Wasn't she clever?"" exclaimed Belle, as if she admired the scheme.

Before Polly could respond, Mr. Gus joined them, and she found herself following behind, sensing that things were amiss. Fond of music, she assumed others were there for the same reason and was perturbed by the whispers among the young people. Belle and Trix were elegantly dressed, while Messrs. Frank and Gus entertained the young ladies with college gossip. Polly, in awe of them, was ignored as they focused on the girls. Despite this, Polly enjoyed the music, her heart responding to the melody. As they left at dusk, Polly was relieved to find the carriage waiting, as she had enough of playing third fiddle. Fan assured her that the boys would behave better next time. Tom, overhearing their conversation, teased them and made a bargain with Fan. After tea, they made molasses candy in the kitchen, with Polly taking charge.|['1.

"""Oh, thunder! I must have accidentally put them in and ate the meats without realizing,"" said Tom, attempting to hide his mischievous pleasure as the girls peered over the pan with disappointed expressions. Maud began to cry over her lost treat, while Polly solemnly prodded at the ruined mess. However, her focus shifted quickly to the commotion in the corner. Fanny, disregarding her usual demeanor, boxed Tom's ears, prompting him to retaliate by seating her forcefully in the coal-hod, engaging in a scuffle. Polly, taken aback by the scene, tried to intervene, urging them to stop. Eventually, Fanny locked the door to prevent further mischief.

"Grandma's gentle voice replied, ""It's just me, dear. Poor Tom is suffering from a terrible toothache, and I came down to find some creosote for him. He asked me not to tell you, but I can't locate the bottle, and I don't want to disturb your mother."" Polly quickly realized she was in a new world, where customs and manners differed greatly from her simple home life. She felt like a stranger in this unfamiliar land and often regretted her decision to come. She found herself with nothing to do but idle, gossip, read novels, stroll the streets, and focus on appearances. Within a week, she grew weary of this lifestyle, longing for the simplicity she knew. Despite being impressed by the luxuries around her, she couldn't understand why the Shaw family wasn't happier. Fanny's friends didn't captivate Polly; she felt out of place among them. She sought solace in Maud, her younger sister, who was engrossed in her own world of social events and material possessions. Tom, although initially teasing Polly, gradually earned her admiration as she observed his neglected state within the family.

Polly was upset about not getting enough exercise. She preferred running, riding, coasting, skating, and other active pursuits at home. She found the daily promenade with her friend Fan and other girls boring. One day, she decided to go for a run alone. As she ran down the mall, she saw children playing with sleds. Polly felt a strong desire to join them in spite of her fear of Fan's disapproval. She took the children coasting down the hill, feeling the thrill of the swift motion. Tom, a boy she knew, also joined in the fun. They had a great time coasting together until it was time for dinner. Later, Polly was worried about the consequences of her actions, but Tom invited her to go coasting again the next day.|"[""1. Why was Polly upset in the text passage?\nA.

Polly was upset that her joy was ruined by the idea of children playing at love, considering it silly. She believed love was serious and sacred, unlike the flirting she witnessed. Despite laughing at her friend's engagement, Polly found it ridiculous and unnatural. She decided to give up coasting to avoid any nonsense with Tom, who was as ignorant as her. Polly entertained herself by playing games and giving lessons to her friend. She felt troubled by her plain clothes and wished for more embellishments. After her mother's wise words, Polly realized the value of simplicity and contentment over material things. She found solace in a locket from her mother, a reminder of the importance of a happy heart. Polly learned the beauty of simplicity and the power of doing good through her actions and words, making girlhood sweet and charming to those who truly appreciate it.|"[""1.

Grandma handled the emergency skillfully, planning activities for everyone with materials and expertise. Polly, knitting bed-socks for her mother, pondered temptation.

Mrs. Shaw was an anxious, particular invalid, who needed assistance frequently; so Polly found many small tasks to help her with and did them happily. The kind child would wait on her, read to her, run errands, or hand her the seven different shawls she often wore. Grandma was also pleased to have Polly's help, and the girl spent many joyful hours in the quaint rooms, learning various crafts and enjoying pleasant conversations. Tom was a challenge for Polly, as he was unpredictable and mischievous. However, despite his troublesome nature, Polly couldn't resist helping him when he struggled with his studies.

"Tom was right; and he admitted that “the governor” was kind, did like him, and hadn't entirely forgotten his promise. The boy blushed with pleasure and fiddled with the buttons on his jacket while hearing this unexpected praise. When he spoke, he looked directly at his father, his own face beaming with joy, and replied, “Thank you, sir. I'll do it, sir. I think I am, sir!”

“Very good; then be prepared for your new horse tomorrow, sir.” Mr. Shaw affectionately stroked Tom's fuzzy red head, feeling paternal pride in his son.

As they moved aside, Tom zoomed past, his arms and legs moving frantically, resembling a runaway engine. It would have been a triumphant descent if a large dog hadn't suddenly bounced through one of the openings, causing everything to tumble into the gutter. Polly laughed as she rushed to see the mess, but when she noticed Tom's pale face, she became alarmed. His eyes looked strange, drops of blood trickled from a deep cut on his forehead. The man and Polly quickly helped Tom up, but he couldn't stand and sat on the curbstone, dazed. Polly held her handkerchief to his forehead, worried if he was seriously hurt.

As Tom tried to stand, he steadied himself with Polly's help, issuing instructions for the procession to head home. The big dog barked, the Irishman pushed the velocipede, and"|"['1.

Tom couldn't sleep, so the girls entertained him. Fanny played and read aloud, Polly sang and told stories. It became a routine for Polly to start telling stories at twilight when Tom settled in his favorite spot on grandma's sofa. However, one night, Polly didn't feel like telling stories. Tom noticed her sorrowful expression and asked what she was thinking about. Polly explained that she was thinking about her brother, Jimmy, who used to sit with her when he was sick.

After being exceptionally well-behaved, children often revert to mischievous behavior. For a week following Tom's accident, the kids were angelic, prompting concern from grandma. However, such excessive virtue is short-lived. Once Tom recovered, the group strayed from the path of goodness. It all started with an innocent mistake by Polly. When she received a bouquet of flowers meant for Fan, she unwittingly revealed the sender, Mr. Frank. This led to a confrontation with Mr. Shaw, who disapproved of Mr. Frank's attentions to Fan. Polly, being honest, unintentionally caused a stir by divulging the truth. Mr. Shaw, displeased, warned Fan to cease all contact with Mr. Frank or face consequences. This incident taught Polly the importance of honesty and the consequences of keeping secrets from loved ones.|"[""1.

Polly reluctantly shared details about walks, lunches, and meetings with Mr. Shaw, who found it comical how the young imitated adults without understanding the depth of their actions. Polly defended her friend Fan, who had misbehaved. Mr. Shaw forgave Fan but warned her to focus on studies. Despite this, Fan remained obstinate and demanded her flowers back. Mr. Shaw returned the flowers and advised Polly to set a good example for Fan. Later, Tom, Fan's mischievous brother, wreaked havoc in Fan's room, trying on her clothes and accessories. Tom even dressed up in Fan's outfit, causing a humorous scene. When Polly tried to stop him, Tom got aggressive, leading to a comical scuffle over a key.

Fanny closed the book, feeling regretful for her unkind words towards Polly. Polly, visibly hurt, left the room with a mix of contempt, grief, and anger. Tom, feeling ashamed, sought out Polly to apologize. He found her in a dark closet, despondent. Tom, surprised, sat down and asked for forgiveness. Polly was angry but not resentful. She appreciated Tom's apology and forgave him. She enjoyed seeing Tom humbled and felt that Fan should also show remorse. Tom appealed to Polly, mentioning Fan's tears and his discomfort, asking for a word of forgiveness.

After the girls reconciled, Fanny was humble and tender, Tom polite but pensive, and Polly forgiving and friendly.

I sometimes think I ain't good for much, and that seems to me the reason why I should n't even try to be a minister,” said Will, smiling, yet looking as if with all his humility he did have faith in the aspirations that came to him in his best moments.

“Yes,” said Polly, unconsciously giving the strongest stimulus to her brother's hope and courage. “Yes, and he added, 'I shall let my boys follow the guide that is in them, and only ask of them to use their gifts conscientiously, and be honest, useful men.'”
