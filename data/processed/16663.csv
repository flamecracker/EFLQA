"Chapter I: Scaring Johnny Green

Solomon Owl was in a predicament. Insects were scarce, he didn't fancy frogs, and fish were hard to catch. Seeking advice from Aunt Polly Woodchuck, he realized the solution: pullets at Farmer Green's chicken house. Despite Aunt Polly's scolding, Solomon hurried off, planning his next meal. As night fell, the hunter's moon rose, but Solomon wasn't interested in the moon; he craved a plump pullet. Careful not to be seen, he arrived at the chicken house after dark.

Tommy Fox was excited about a pullet Farmer Green was saving for him. Fatty Coon noticed a man with glaring eyes watching the chicken house. Solomon Owl thought the man was there to catch Tommy Fox. Suddenly, Jimmy Rabbit appeared fearlessly and confronted the man. But when Jimmy Rabbit brushed the man's head, something fell off, revealing a glowing fire inside his head. Solomon Owl and Tommy Fox were shocked to see the fire shining through the man's mouth and nose. Solomon Owl explained that the man's eyes glared because his head was on fire, making it impossible for him to speak. Despite the distraction, Tommy Fox and Solomon Owl were disappointed as they were not interested in corn and had their minds set on chicken.|"['1.

Tommy Fox and Fatty Coon were in a hurry. Tommy felt the same way as Fatty Coon, who was sneaking down the tree to the cornfield. Without a goodbye, Tommy dashed off. He thought to himself that he had done his best, even though he didn't follow Aunt Polly Woodchuck's advice to eat a pullet for supper. Solomon Owl was upset all night, worried about the man watching the chicken house. At daybreak, the man was gone, so Solomon flew to the chicken house. But Farmer Green appeared, causing Solomon to flee. Solomon had pains and sought Aunt Polly's help. She diagnosed him with a wishbone inside. Solomon refrained from catching mice and frogs, as Aunt Polly advised. Despite his pains, Solomon was relieved when his hunger pangs lessened.|"[""1.

Solomon's peculiar behavior had intrigued his neighbors, who were disappointed when he stopped. Rumors circulated that he was angry with Farmer Green and wanted to knock down his trees. Despite the forest folk following him, hoping to witness such an event, Solomon seemed unfazed. Aunt Polly examined him, noting his improved condition due to a broken wishbone. Solomon, feeling better, attributed his previous troubles to not eating enough. He rudely flew off before Aunt Polly could respond, starting his nightly hunt. Benjamin Bat, another nocturnal creature in Pleasant Valley, was known for his erratic flight patterns and upside-down resting habits. Solomon Owl, skeptical of Aunt Polly's advice, warned against relying too heavily on her catnip tea. Benjamin Bat's mysterious movements added to the nighttime intrigue of the valley.|"[""1.

Many of Benjamin Bat's friends thought he was crazy because he didn't act like them. However, Benjamin didn't let their opinions change his habits. He continued to live life differently, even hanging by his heels. Benjamin believed others were crazy for not doing the same. Once, Benjamin narrowly escaped being caught by Solomon Owl, who mistook him for a field mouse. Although they crossed paths often, Benjamin never stopped to chat with Solomon. One stormy night, Benjamin found himself far from home and sought shelter. He turned to Solomon Owl, known for his wisdom, for help. Solomon welcomed Benjamin into his home in a hollow hemlock near Blue Mountain. Despite the storm, they found comfort and rest together.|"[""1.

Solomon Owl invited a guest to stay in his tree but was displeased when the guest left without thanking him. Hungry and grumpy, Solomon Owl decided to go back to sleep until dusk. He preferred dark nights to bright days. In his dream, he chased Benjamin Bat around Blue Mountain but couldn't catch him due to Benjamin's erratic flight path. Benjamin Bat, unaware of Solomon Owl's hunger, flew away aimlessly.

When Benjamin Bat overheard Solomon Owl's words, he realized Solomon intended to eat him. Terrified, Benjamin dropped from the limb and flew straight away in a hurry to escape. Solomon, having caught many mice, didn't pursue. Instead, he watched Benjamin fly off without zigzags, pondering his behavior. Solomon Owl, impressed by Benjamin's boldness, wished he had his courage. Solomon became known for settling disputes among forest creatures, gaining a reputation for wisdom. To accommodate daytime visitors, Solomon agreed to meet at dusk and dawn. The first pair seeking his help were Mr. Crow and Jasper Jay, who arrived at sunset, squawking for his assistance.

The following evening, Jasper Jay and Mr. Crow returned to Solomon Owlâ€™s house appearing disheveled. Mr. Crow had a nearly closed eye, and Jasper Jay's crest looked half torn. They waited for Solomon Owl, but he didn't show up. Unable to enter his dark cavern, they decided to head home. Solomon Owl's cousin, Simon Screecher, was different from him with yellow eyes and ear-tufts. Despite being smaller, Simon was more agile and caught mice faster. Solomon realized Simon had caught more mice than him. Solomon pondered until he had an idea. He proposed they share the mice they caught, giving two-thirds to Simon and keeping one-third for himself. They agreed to hunt together, but Simon grew discontented when Solomon didn't share any mice he caught. Simon decided to stop hunting with Solomon.|"[""1.

Simon Screecher scolded Solomon Owl for being slow and clumsy, claiming he was still hungry after sharing his food. Solomon, however, had been busy catching locusts and frogs, not mice. Solomon had decided not to hunt mice anymore and ate the locusts and frogs freely. As the thaw came, Solomon enjoyed the warmer weather but later found himself heavy and stiff-winged after getting wet. He struggled to fly and eventually couldn't even reach his perch.

Solomon Owl faced a challenge due to the rain and freezing cold. As he sat helplessly, the ice binding his wings melted in the bright sunshine. Once free, he swiftly flew back to his cozy home in a hollow tree. However, mischievous Reddy Woodpecker liked to disturb Solomon by tapping on his door, making him ill-tempered. Despite the annoyance, Solomon tolerated it until Jasper Jay's loud screams startled him. Startled, Solomon removed his forgotten red night-cap, while Reddy Woodpecker, unable to remove his red cap, dashed at Jasper Jay.

Solomon Owl and Reddy Woodpecker were in a constant feud, with Reddy always disturbing Solomon's daytime rest. Despite being wise, Solomon couldn't figure out how to outsmart Reddy until he decided to take his naps in Farmer Green's haystack. This new hiding spot provided him with the peace and quiet he needed. When Reddy invited friends to tease Solomon in his old home, they were surprised to find it empty, leading to tension among the group. Solomon, feeling well-rested for the first time in a while, even greeted Reddy pleasantly, unaware of the chaos his absence had caused. This turn of events left Reddy Woodpecker and his friends in a bit of a pickle, as they had to deal with the aftermath of their failed plan.|"[""1.
