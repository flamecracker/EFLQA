"""Oh, bother!"" muttered the girl. ""I must release you, my darlings. I never had two of you in my arms simultaneously before. It's always the same, interrupted when I'm enjoying a moment of joy.

Polly greatly admired her father, but she held the deepest affection for her young, beautiful mother. Dr. Maybright was too occupied with his work to engage in the children's games or share in their joys and sorrows. The children respected him and loved him, but it was their mother who truly understood and connected with them. The Maybright family was known for their wild ways, with six tall, slender girls and two mischievous boys.

Dr. Maybright, a kind-hearted doctor, often treated his poorer patients for free on Saturday mornings, finding their gratitude more rewarding than money.

The doctor, preoccupied with his patients, struggled to address Alice's concerns. However, a more serious confrontation awaited him when Mrs. Power, the cook, arrived to give her notice. Despite her excellent cooking skills, Mrs. Power felt undermined by Polly's inexperienced attempts at housekeeping.

Polly blushed but stayed silent, determined to make a good meal. She felt relieved for not betraying Maggie and hoped the apple-tart would turn out excellent. The children's faces brightened at the sight of the noble apple-pie. Despite their hunger, they were content with the meal. Mrs. White's delicious cream added to the success of Polly's first dinner. Helen suggested speaking to their father about hosting the Australian children their mother had arranged to come. Dr. Maybright was hesitant due to their mother's passing, but the girls insisted it would be a financial help.

On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the family enjoyed good meals and managed well. However, on Friday morning, Dr. Maybright informed his daughters that he had urgent business in London and would not return until Monday. He quickly packed and left. The younger siblings proposed a late-night feast in the attic, which excited Polly. Although she was worried about the cost, her siblings gathered money. Polly agreed to use it for whipped cream and ginger beer. With Helen away, they decided to keep the feast a secret to avoid any objections.

All the children rose together and rushed towards her. She had a brilliant idea, so Mrs. Ricketts' youngest son and daughter, along with the mischievous sons of Mrs. Jones, the laundress, were invited to join the upcoming feast. The day passed calmly. Helen was absent, the Doctor's carriage stayed put, and the Doctor himself was not around. The children behaved exceptionally well, almost too well, which raised suspicion among the adults. The children's unusually good behavior hinted at something mischievous brewing. If Nurse had been present at dinner, she would have noticed Bunny, Bob, and Firefly's unusual conduct. There were mysterious activities happening in the attic, with trays of crockery, flowers, and delicious food being transported there. Despite the stealthy movements, Helen returned home to a cozy tea prepared by Polly. As Helen enjoyed her meal, the children quietly sneaked towards the attic for a secret adventure.|"['1.

Polly happily led her family and guests to a hidden attic for a joyful party, confident that their revelry would go unnoticed. However, a nosy old lady named Mrs. Cameron, accompanied by her snarling little dog Scorpion, unexpectedly arrived at Sleepy Hollow. Mrs. Cameron, with her traveling trunk and bandboxes, was shocked by the remote location. She pondered why her late friend Helen married the odd Dr. Maybright and settled in such a desolate place. Determined to care for Helen's children, Mrs. Cameron embarked on the journey. Scorpion's unruly behavior added to her discomfort as they approached the mysterious Hollow.|"[""1.

Alice, the tidy housemaid, interrupted Helen in the nursery, informing her of a lady downstairs with a lot of luggage and a troublesome little dog. The dog had caused chaos, even attacking the Persian kitten. The lady, Mrs. Cameron, had arrived unexpectedly, requesting Helen's immediate presence. Helen, shocked, realized it was her Aunt Maria.

The doctor stepped out of the carriage at his doorstep, looking around with a smile. It was six o'clock, and the evenings were getting darker. The children, usually lively, seemed quiet.

"""Doctor Maybright, I will join you for tea,"" Maria said. The Doctor's once bright look faded into one of weariness and concern. He hurried up the stairs to find his room overtaken by Maria's belongings and guarded by the disgruntled Scorpion, who nipped at his legs. After a brief scolding, he sought refuge in another room. Maria welcomed him back warmly and offered the room above the porch for his stay. Although the children were absent upon his return, the Doctor remained in good spirits, unfazed by their absence.

"""I don't know where they are.

""Father!"" came convulsively from three little parched throats; there was a volume in the cry, a tone of rapture, of longing, of pain, which was almost indescribable. ""Father's come back again, it's all right now,"" sobbed Firefly, and immediately the boys and the little girl had cuddled up to him and were kissing him, each boy taking possession of a hand, and Firefly clasping her arms round his neck. ""So we sat down here, and tried to pretend we were gipsies,"" continued Firefly. ""The moon was shining, and that was a little wee bit of comfort, but we didn't like it much.

"The moon shone brightly that night, and Helen's sad expression made her father kiss her affectionately. ""You're brave, Nell. Be the bravest by taking the others home now. Kids, it's bedtime, no visiting the drawing-room tonight."" Polly Maybright was in a complex state of mind. Her life of joy and love was disrupted by Aunt Maria Cameron's strict punishment for her wrongdoings. Polly, though naughty, was usually excused due to her charm and quick wit. But now, with her mother gone, Mrs. Cameron was unforgiving. Polly was confined to her room, feeling the effects of harshness hardening her heart.

"In neither place, she continued, ""I couldn't bear it any longer, and you won't stay in this room any longer, Miss Polly. I nearly hurt myself clinging to the honeysuckle and ivy-roots, but here we are. Let's use a bit of rope and the bedroom towels to escape,"" said Maggie. ""It's easy getting down, what I did was the risky part. Hurry, Miss Polly, let's go while they're at dinner."" Polly quickly decided. Between roaming with Maggie and reading Webster's Dictionary, freedom won. They tied the towels to the rope, secured it, and descended fearlessly. Holding hands, they ran through the kitchen garden, over the fence, into the green lane. Polly suggested hiding in the old hut by the fir-trees on Peg-Top Moor. The moor was lonely and dangerous, but they journeyed on, with Polly riding Sultan, the old pony. The sun beat down, and their pace slowed, Maggie complained about the lack of food, accusing Polly of getting her into this mess.

"The woman's voice was very menacing; she was of enormous size, and going up to the little girls, attempted to place one of her brawny arms on Polly's shoulder. But Polly with all her faults possessed a great deal of courage; her eyes flashed, and she sprang aside from the woman's touch. ""You are talking nonsense,"" she said. ""Father has over and over told me that the moor belongs to the Queen, so this little bit couldn't have been given to your husband, Micah Jones, and we are just as free to walk here as you are. Come on, Maggie, we'll be late for our business if we idle any longer."" The hut to which the woman took the little girls was the very hermit's hut to which their own steps had been bent. It was a very dirty place, consisting of one room, which was now filled with smoke from a fire made of broken faggots, fir-cones, and withered fern. Two ugly, lean-looking dogs guarded the entrance to the hut.

During the days spent in her room, Polly felt lonely and longed for her mother. She blamed Aunt Maria for her situation, but now her heart ached for her mother. Polly's longing often led to fits of passionate weeping. Despite feeling scared of the dogs and Micah Jones' wife, what really troubled her were the stars in the sky and the vast moors around her. As the night darkened, Polly comforted Maggie, who fell asleep in her lap. Dr. Maybright found them and took them home, with Polly clinging to him in relief.
