"As a young boy, I used to think mixing education with fun was as bad as putting powder in jam. Back then, books were more about learning and less about enjoyment. I've tried to change that. I hope my tales of battles and sieges, along with maps, are as exciting as the lighter parts of the story. Just like in ""_The Young Franc-Tireurs_,"" where I outlined the Franco-German war, I now aim to highlight the key moments of the Peninsular war. The military facts, generals, regiments, dates, and places are all accurate. In my story, ""The Young Buglers,"" the Scudamore brothers, Tom and Peter, were often in trouble but never for anything dishonorable. They were mischievous but never deceitful. Their daring act against a malicious bargeman caused quite a stir but went unpunished."|"['1.

"No reply was given in words, but a few lit fireworks were tossed into the cabin, exploding loudly. Quickly, the hatch was closed and secured from outside. The rope was untied, and the barge started drifting downstream with the fireworks still bursting inside, drowned out by the shouts and banging at the hatch. Tom assured, ""He'll be fine. The smoke will clear through the chimney hole. The barge won't capsize with the current. We didn't mean harm."" The Provost questioned the bargeman's suspicion of boys, recalling an earlier boat incident. The bargeman left, threatening vengeance. The Provost checked on the boys, then dismissed the matter. This event happened on October 15, 1808, after a holiday. Tom and friends walked by the river, discussing Tom's desire to be a soldier. They later learned of their father's sudden death and left for London. Mr. Scudamore, a banker, had inherited the family business but had been neglecting it since his wife's passing.

"At any rate, my boys, you have saved me from a loss of a couple of hundred pounds which I had got hid in my boots, but which those fellows would have been sure to have discovered,"" one of the passengers said.

Captain Manley explained that the boys, Tom and Peter Scudamore, seemed to be related to the former colonel, Peter Scudamore, who was highly esteemed. Major James and others felt compelled to help them, as they didn't want the boys to end up as buglers. The boys, however, wanted to be treated like any other boys in the regiment to avoid jealousy. They were practicing the bugle diligently to accompany the regiment. Tom and Peter subtly hinted that they were actually sons of Sir Arthur Wellesley, seeking to pay their way into the regiment. The men in the band were impressed by the boys' dedication and suspected their noble lineage.

The boys cautiously raised their rod, bringing a square-mouthed bag close to them. Peering inside, they cheered at the sight of little fish. Slowly lifting the net out of the sea, they examined their catch. With gratitude, they ate the fish, grateful for the sustenance. They realized they could survive on these catches for days.

The allies retreated across the Alberche to protect Talavera. Sir Arthur positioned his troops defensively, knowing the Spanish were ineffective in open combat. The Spanish were positioned from Talavera to a mound with defenses like a redoubt, a convent, ditches, and walls. Campbell and Sherbrooke's divisions extended the line, with Mackenzie and Donkin still holding the Alberche. The British, with 19,000 troops and 30 guns, faced 50,000 French troops. The Spanish, with 33,000 men and 70 guns, fled when the French attacked. The French then targeted the key hill defended by Donkin's brigade.

The boys quickly devoured the raw eggs, then joined the men as gunfire erupted from the hill above. Without hesitation, the regiment readied to assist Donkin's brigade. Knapsacks dropped, rifles gripped tightly, they awaited the command to advance. The colonel, eager to act, ordered the regiment forward upon seeing the English falling back and the French seizing the hill's crest.

A brief pause followed the intense battle. The French lost 1400 men, while the British also suffered. The French decided to launch a full-scale attack.

The French prepared for an assault, drums beating at one o'clock. Tom and Peter observed the French forces advancing, with artillery in the distance. Sir Arthur Wellesley and his staff watched the enemy closely. The French artillery fired at the British right flank, followed by a charge. The British retaliated, driving back the French with cheers and capturing guns. The British artillery then bombarded the retreating French forces. The troops witnessed the intense clash, erupting in triumph as the French retreated. The battle shifted to the left, with the British cavalry engaging the advancing French divisions. A courageous cavalry charge faced difficulties due to the terrain, resulting in losses. Despite challenges, the British forces displayed resilience and strategic maneuvers during the conflict.|"['1.

Tom and Peter didn't witness the disastrous event as they joined the ranks upon the enemy's approach. The French struggled to claim the hilltop. Lapisse led an attack on Sherbrooke's division, but the British repelled them. The Guards followed with zeal, but the French reserves pushed back. The 48th regiment, ordered by Sir Arthur, ambushed the French column, turning the tide. The French retreated, and the British celebrated victory. The battle ended with both sides holding their ground. The British lost 6200, and the French 7400. Exhausted, the British couldn't pursue the retreating enemy. The French awaited an English attack, but the British were unable to advance. The next morning, the French army moved, and the British fell back to Arzobispo.|"['1.

The army, including artillery, baggage, and wounded soldiers, crossed the bridge by two o'clock. The troops were so hungry that they chased and devoured raw a herd of swine they encountered. The British army then secured a strong position guarding the Tagus bridges and stayed put until the end of August. Starvation weakened the troops, causing many cavalry horses and baggage animals to die. Sir Arthur eventually retreated to the Portuguese border due to the Junta's lack of support. The Spanish army suffered a significant defeat at the hands of the French, prompting Lord Wellington to focus on preparing Portugal for the imminent French threat. The Portuguese army faced difficulties due to the government's incompetence and mistreatment of soldiers despite English subsidies. Lord Wellington had to intervene to address these issues. Despite delays in reinforcements from England, Lord Wellington continued his preparations in Portugal, while Tom and Peter Scudamore offered to assist in gathering information on French movements.|"['1.

In late March, a group of muleteers and mules departed from the town of Alonqua. The Scudamores had been out of the army for four months, traveling through Spain. They carried secret messages hidden in their coats and gold coins sewn into their shoes. Disguised as peasant boys, they gathered intelligence on French troops in various towns. Staying with contacts, they observed troop numbers, food supplies, and local sentiments. Often, muleteers aided them, sharing their deep hatred for the French. The boys, fluent in Spanish, convincingly played their roles, never revealing their true identities. By speaking only Spanish and adopting local customs, they avoided suspicion and successfully gathered crucial information for the British.

The messengers had been traveling through friendly territories, but their mission was about to change. They had accurately predicted the French army's movements and were now tasked with delivering important messages to the guerilla leaders in the mountainous northeast of Spain. This region was a hotbed of irregular warfare, with fortified towns resisting French control. The guerilla bands varied in size and strength, swelling in numbers under brave leaders. The conflict depended on the actions of French generals; some maintained discipline, while others resorted to brutal tactics, sparking retaliation from the guerillas. Armed with rifles and British-supplied muskets, the guerillas tied down significant French forces, aiding the overall war effort. The English commander sought to coordinate with the guerillas to disrupt French supply lines. The messengers were headed to Nunez, a prominent guerilla chief, with a mule train carrying concealed supplies to avoid detection by the French.|"[""1.

The group continued their journey through the hills, reaching a crossroads where they saw the bodies of French soldiers hanging from trees. Garcias explained that it was the work of Nunez, a rough individual. They spent the night at a farm and resumed their journey at dawn, now in the mountain's heart. The path led through ravines and rocky ledges until they arrived at a village, which Garcias identified as Nunez's current headquarters. He explained the strategic location of the village for ambushes and escapes. As they approached the village, they found armed men gathering for an expedition. Nunez, the guerilla chief, arrived, surprising the boys with his small and hump-bodied stature, fierce eyes, and thin lips, contrasting with his reputation for cruelty.|"['1.

The man led his band to a small inn where they would eat. He mentioned that some of his men were absent but would meet them later. He estimated having about a thousand men under his command. After unloading the mules, they entered the inn. Inside, an old woman by the fire complained about having to cook for the hungry group. Despite her grumbling, she prepared dinner for the twelve men. After the frugal meal, the boys lay down on benches to rest. The next day passed slowly as the band was not expected back until late. The boys mingled with the villagers, telling stories of distant cities. They noticed two girls dressed in fine silk, the captain's children. The boys learned that the captain's wife was killed by the French, and he sought revenge. The woman shared that the captain adored his children and was ruthless towards the French.|"['1.

Upon the third day after their arrival, the expected regiment arrived. The boys began their journey early next morning with their friends. Madame Reynier, who had been ill, insisted on continuing the journey. She was placed in a cart with straw, pillows, cushions, and an awning to shield her from the sun. While marching alongside the regiment, the boys overheard a conversation that led them to believe they were being followed by members of Nunez's band. The boys, armed with pistols, confronted one of the suspicious individuals. Madame Reynier, grateful for their protection, offered to help them with fresh disguises and a pass to travel safely to the French lines.|"['1.

Madame Reynier assured the boys that their courageous act had not gone unnoticed. She introduced them to Julie, who remembered how the boys had saved them from the wicked men. Tom explained the differences between English and French army officers to the boys. As the convoy reached the village, the boys made sure their unwelcome followers left. The march to Madrid was uneventful, and the boys practiced French phrases with a friendly sergeant. In Madrid, they stayed close to the French soldiers for safety. While exploring the city, they sensed they were being followed. A scuffle ensued, but the boys, with the help of the sergeant, defended themselves successfully. Impressed by their bravery, the sergeant commended Peter for his quick action. They left the scene before attracting further attention.|['1.

Two French soldiers approached the boys and their friend after hearing a gunshot. The sergeant explained the situation, and the soldiers were satisfied. The boys then returned to the main street, leaving the bodies behind. At the barracks, Tom's wound was treated, and they received praise for their bravery. Due to safety concerns, they remained in the barracks in Madrid. Madame Reynier later informed them that their journey was arranged for the next day. She provided disguises, a pass, and instructions for a safe departure. She expressed gratitude and presented them with gold watches as tokens of remembrance.

Madame Reynier had everything planned meticulously, ensuring the boys' smooth journey from Madrid to the frontier. Tom appeared as a university student, while Peter disguised himself as a novice heading to a convent in Ciudad Rodrigo, where his aunt was the lady superior. The colonel and his officers were courteous, the mules sturdy, and the weather pleasant. The boys relished the fortnight's march, learning along the way that Massena was besieging Ciudad Rodrigo, and the 16th was en route to join the French army. Despite challenges, Wellington's strategic decisions aimed to safeguard his troops and Portugal's fate. The boys, now at a cottage near Villar, awaited the right moment to rejoin the British army while navigating the complexities of the ongoing conflict.|"[""1.

As night fell, the Scudamores left the cottage and walked two miles up the stream. They shed their disguises, left them on the bank, and crossed the river in peasants' suits tied to bundles of rushes to stay dry. They aimed to reach Almeida before the English retreated. Despite the wind and rain, they followed the river to avoid detection by French cavalry. Upon reaching a road leading to Almeida, they encountered British troops preparing for a French attack at daybreak. Recognized as British officers, they were welcomed and directed to join the Norfolk Rangers to help hold the enemy at bay.

The group now had time to observe their surroundings and quickly realized the danger they were in due to General Craufurd's stubbornness. In front of them stood a massive French army consisting of 24,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 30 artillery pieces. The odds were overwhelmingly against the 4,000 British infantry, especially given the unfavorable position they were in. The British were on the edge of a plateau with steep terrain behind them leading to the Coa River, a mile away, with only one bridge across. General Craufurd wisely ordered a retreat as resistance was futile. The 43rd regiment held their ground, allowing the rest to retreat, and then cleverly broke through a wall to escape. The British troops, using the rough terrain to their advantage, retreated in good order. Fortunately, French internal conflicts prevented a full-on attack, allowing the British to escape. Major MacLeod and his men bravely charged the French skirmishers, buying time for the rest to retreat. The Scudamore brothers played a vital role in setting up a trap with a rope to halt the French cavalry, ensuring the safe retreat of the British forces.|"['1.

The remaining infantry and artillery had already positioned themselves on the heights behind the river. They began firing at the French soldiers as they neared the bridge. The British troops were now in a secure location they should have taken earlier. If General Craufurd had followed orders not to engage beyond the Coa, the lives of 306 brave soldiers, including officers, could have been spared. The battle continued with artillery exchanges and French skirmishers advancing. Despite the French pushing forward, the British marksmen's accurate fire caused heavy casualties. The French eventually retreated, and the British troops fell back to the Pinhel river. The next day, the boys changed into British officers' uniforms. They joined the Rangers at Guarda, warmly welcomed by their comrades. They enjoyed a celebratory dinner with tales of their adventures by the fire.|"['1.

Sam's story was abruptly interrupted by a loud burst of laughter from everyone at the table, even Captain Manley joined in, laughing at himself. After the laughter subsided, Sam continued with a serious tone. He explained how he had nothing for dinner after being away for seven months. He came up with an idea and casually strolled up to a large farmhouse on a hill. Sam carefully approached the house, staying out of sight from the window. Then, he took off his hat and suddenly popped his head in through the window. As expected, there sat the fat old mistress of the farm and her fat old servant. When they saw Sam's head, they thought he was the devil and started praying frantically. Sam played along, pretending to be the devil and even asked for the soul of a little pig as a gift. The servant gladly handed over the pig, and Sam left with it, giving some advice to the old women about being kind to the poor.

Captain Manley observed the explosion at Almeida, realizing the town was severely damaged. The magazine explosion killed 500 people, leaving only six houses standing. Despite the devastation, Colonel Cox attempted to negotiate, hoping for Wellington's rescue. However, the Portuguese officers' treachery led to French occupation. The British army prepared for Massena's advance, concentrating at Busaco heights. Despite being outnumbered, they anticipated defending against the French. The British set up strong defenses at Torres Vedras, ready to face Massena's forces. The soldiers, confident in Wellington's strategy, awaited the impending battle. As the French approached, the British took a formidable position at Busaco, deterring Massena's attack. Wellington's strategic brilliance and the soldiers' readiness instilled hope for a successful defense against the advancing French forces.|"['1.

On the 27th and 28th, the armies faced each other calmly across the chasm. Rifles cracked from the woods below as skirmishers pushed back and forth. By the evening of the 28th, the fighting intensified, with British troops ready for a night attack. The enemy's riflemen advanced up the hill towards the British lines, causing tension. As night fell, the fire ceased, and the ravine between the armies quieted. The Rangers, with Picton's division, were on high alert. A heavy fire erupted, and the regiment prepared for action. The French assault overwhelmed the Rangers, who fell back. The French gained the crest, cutting off British positions.

The Battle of Busaco, though not strategically significant, resulted in higher losses for the French than the British. The French, with losses around 4000, were forced to retreat after their flank was turned. The British army, in retreat, faced chaos and disorder, with many civilians and soldiers fleeing towards Lisbon. Massena's French troops, delayed by difficult terrain, allowed the British to retreat to Torres Vedras. Wellington's army, disciplined and prepared, surprised the French with their fortified positions. The British had three lines of defense, with the second line being the main stronghold. Massena, unable to attack the strong British position, found himself unable to sustain his army in the region due to lack of provisions. Ultimately, the British successfully defended their territory against the French invasion.|"['1.

Sam was about to descend when the mule suddenly kicked him in the nose. In pain, he grabbed the mule's tail for dear life as it wildly thrashed around. The soldiers, coming out of their tents, found the scene amusing. The mule, galloping furiously down a narrow road, caused chaos among the officers, with some leaping over walls to avoid it. The mule charged through the group, causing havoc. Troopers were sent to catch the mule but struggled to keep up. As they closed in, they were surprised by gunfire and realized they had strayed into enemy territory. They were saved by British cavalry. The mule, however, ran into French lines and was captured. Despite losing Sam, the boys joined General Beresford's division and marched to Campo Mayor, where they prepared to lay siege to Badajos, only to face a strong French army led by Soult.|"['1.

Tom was relieved to have his loyal servant, Sam, back to care for Peter. He abandoned his post by Peter's bedside, feeling assured that Sam would provide excellent care. After reading a letter from the colonel, Tom prepared for a peaceful night's rest. The letter expressed sympathy for their wounds and praised their bravery in battle. The colonel congratulated them on their promotions to captains. Sam devotedly nursed both Tom and Peter, even though Tom had to convince him to rest. After weeks of care, Peter's health improved, and they began a journey to Lisbon for the voyage back to England. The journey was made comfortable with hay in the cart and a canopy for shade. Upon reaching Lisbon, they boarded a transport to Spithead. Peter, still recovering, had to use crutches due to stiffness in his back. The journey continued to London and then Marlborough, where they took a coach. Sam shared stories of their adventures, and they encountered the same coachman from a previous incident with highwaymen.

During the next part of their journey, the coachman and guard shared the story of stopping the coach with the other passengers. Sam, the black servant, beamed with joy as he recounted his own tale of falling overboard and being rescued. The boys felt embarrassed by the attention they received for their bravery. Upon reaching Marlborough, they couldn't find the expected carriage. Tom suspected their aunt hadn't received their letter. They decided to take a post-chaise instead. As they approached their aunt's house, they saw familiar sights like the pigeons on the roof. Rhoda, their cousin, rushed out to greet them with excitement.

The French forces crumbled, allowing the British to advance. Despite the fierce fighting, the Scudamores, staff officers, were unable to join the assault. However, witnessing the horrors of war made them reconsider resigning. The triumphs at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajos did not immediately lead to further successes for Wellington.

Lord Wellington and his troops were on the move towards Toro when they received news that the French forces had retreated. However, a sudden development occurred when Marmont's army attacked Cotton's outposts near Trabancos. Wellington swiftly reacted, ordering his cavalry towards Alaejos. After a brief rest, they rushed towards the battlefield where the mist concealed the approaching French army. An intense battle ensued, with Wellington and his staff caught in the midst of the fight. The British cavalry from Alaejos arrived just in time to thwart a French charge. As the mist lifted, the two armies marched side by side towards the river, engaging in occasional skirmishes.

The day passed swiftly, with both sides resting after their fatigue. Wellington anticipated an attack the next morning, positioning his army for combat. At daybreak, Marmont's army moved up the river, turning Wellington's right and threatening his communications. The British fell back, marching along parallel hills. The French troops, marching farther, secured the ford of Huerta on the Tormes River, threatening Wellington's position. Marmont intercepted a crucial letter from Wellington, planning to cut off the British retreat. The armies crossed the Tormes, with news of French reinforcements arriving. Marmont made a bold move to cut off Wellington's retreat, detaching his wing from the main body. Wellington seized the opportunity, launching a successful attack that led to a French defeat. Clausel took command, reinforcing the French troops, but the British cavalry and divisions secured victory.|"['1.

During a fierce battle, Wellington's British divisions were outnumbered and began to fall back as French cavalry threatened their flank. But Wellington had reserves and launched them at the enemy, turning the tide. The sixth division charged the enemy's center, while other divisions attacked the flanks. The French, overwhelmed, retreated in disorder. Although Wellington expected Spanish help at a crucial ford, they had abandoned the post. The French suffered heavy losses, and Wellington's triumph was celebrated in Madrid. Amidst the joy, the city was in distress with starvation and illness. The British officers tried to help by setting up soup kitchens. Wellington then marched north to seize Burgos, leaving General Hill in Madrid. The Scudamores, now officers, felt safe until an incident made them doubt their security from a guerilla chief's hatred.|"['1.

Several officers knew some Spanish but couldn't understand the girl's fast speech. One officer joked that it was beyond them and suggested that Scudamore, who spoke Spanish well, should handle it. The girl then approached two brothers, telling a tale of French oppression. The brothers suspected she was lying, and one of them gave her coins. Later, they noticed a peasant signaling to the girl. The brothers felt they were being watched and suspected a setup to test their Spanish skills. Despite their suspicions, nothing happened, and they continued to be cautious. One evening, Tom received a dispatch to deliver to a general outside town. Upon returning to his quarters, he found the door open and suspected something was amiss. Tom and his orderly hurried to check on the situation.|"[""1.

Tom and his loyal companion, Sam, discovered mysterious clues in their home. Tom noticed dirty shoe marks and signs of a scuffle, hinting at an unwelcome intrusion. As they ventured upstairs, they found more disturbing evidence of a struggle. Despite the absence of blood, Captain Scudamore was missing. Tom pondered the motive behind the events, suspecting the involvement of a dangerous gang. With Sam by his side, armed and ready, Tom set out to unravel the mystery, seeking answers from Captain Farquharson.

The officer, awakened and informed of the situation, verified the orderly's report that Peter had disappeared. Tom suspected the Nunez group, who held a grudge against them, orchestrated Peter's abduction. Tom believed Nunez sought to harm them personally. Tom planned to rescue Peter, disguising himself to avoid detection. Sam, unable to accompany due to his conspicuous appearance, vowed to find Peter independently, even if it meant deserting. Tom pondered his strategy until morning, while Sam, emotional and determined, prepared to embark on his mission. Tom resolved to seek permission and confront the guerillas, with Sam joining him discreetly to aid in the rescue.|"[""1.

Tom had already considered this carefully. He believed the loyal man would not stay behind, but he understood that his presence could be dangerous. Tom had a plan in mind, similar to Sam's suggestion. He was confident that when the time came to act, his bravery, strength, and loyalty would be crucial. Tom went to see Lord Wellington, who had just woken up. He explained Peter's disappearance and the encounter with the guerillas, which led to Nunez's desire for revenge. He requested permission to leave. Lord Wellington granted him leave and provided a note to show to French officers if needed. Tom then went to a shop to buy disguises and informed the police about Peter's disappearance. Six days later, an old man with white hair and a box of trinkets was near the Pyrenees waiting for someone. He recognized a figure approaching - a black man named Sam. They decided to go back into the woods to talk safely. Sam explained his challenges and shared that Nunez was still at his old location. Tom and Sam exchanged information and discussed their journey so far.|"[""1.

Sam had few stories to share. Before he set out, Tom carefully guided him on the road, towns, and distances between them. Sam traveled only at night and rarely spoke to others. In a troubled country, people avoided traveling at night. When he heard someone approaching, he hid until they passed. Sam exchanged a few words with foot-passers, using a Spanish greeting and his disguise hid his identity. Tom thought the group who took Peter hadn't arrived yet. They likely had a slow bullock-cart and might take another day to reach. Tom planned to eavesdrop in the village, while Sam waited nearby. If Tom was caught, Sam would seek help from the French garrison. Tom arrived in the village cautiously, noticing the sentries were absent. The brigands seemed complacent, thinking the French wouldn't return. Tom disguised himself and saw a group of men in a house, talking about their boredom.|"['1.

At six o'clock, Sam lit a fire near the village where Peter was held captive. He crept closer, hiding to observe the guerillas surrounding Peter. Sam planned to rescue him but needed to wait for the right moment. As dusk fell, he prepared for the soldiers' arrival. Sam strategically gathered supplies and observed the guerillas' movements.

"When Sam peeked out through the window, he noticed that something was about to happen. Nunez sat smoking a cigarette with a fierce look on his face while the others built a large fire in front of the trees. ""I don't trust that man's expression,"" Sam thought to himself. ""It's time for me to get ready for the show, that's quite clear. Master Tom arrived too late."" Saying this, Sam began to undress deliberately.

Peter, still tied up, sat against a tree, witnessing what he believed were preparations for his demise. For the past ten days, he had been living in a bewildering and painful haze. From the moment he was ambushed in his room and taken away, he had not seen anything. He had never doubted who had taken him or what awaited him. Even now, facing the threat of being roasted alive, Peter remained calm, expecting Tom to come to his rescue.

Peter was silent as Nunez rolled a cigarette. Sam, hidden in the shadows, watched guerrillas preparing a fire. Nunez planned to smoke Peter, not kill him yet. The guerrillas tied Peter upside down over the fire. As smoke engulfed him, Peter felt agony, then lost consciousness. Suddenly, Sam, disguised as a devil, leaped through the flames, scaring the guerrillas. Sam freed Peter, enraging Nunez, who shot at Sam, injuring him. In retaliation, Sam impaled Nunez and threw him into the fire. The sight terrified the guerrillas, causing them to flee in horror. Sam rescued Peter and escaped the village.|"[""1.

The night was dark as the group gathered around the fire after a successful mission against the brigands. Sam, who had disguised himself, revealed his true identity to the surprise of the others. The prisoners spoke of a devilish tale involving their captain and the fire. Peter, injured but recovering, enjoyed supper with the group. General Reynier requested Sam's account of the events before their arrival, which was translated by Tom. Sam's story was met with laughter and admiration for his cleverness and bravery. The next day, they moved to Vittoria where Peter was cared for by Madame Reynier. Once recovered, they set off to rejoin their army, disguised as Spanish gentlemen. They avoided the French army and eventually reached the British outposts, continuing towards the headquarters besieging Burgos. Despite the unsuccessful siege, the allied armies retreated towards Portugal as the French forces advanced.|"['1.

During the retreat, the British army suffered greatly, leading to a decline in discipline. Lord Wellington reprimanded the army for the deterioration of discipline, despite no extraordinary hardships faced. The allied army lost over nine thousand soldiers, with most not falling in battle. By December, they reached winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo, gaining respite as the French replenished supplies. The defeat of Napoleon in Russia boosted morale, prompting a decisive attack. The Portuguese and Spanish forces, along with insurrections in the north of Spain, supported Wellington's plans. By late May, the allied army of nearly a hundred thousand troops entered Spain, overwhelming the French. The French retreated to Vittoria, laden with baggage and refugees. Joseph's indecision and poor tactics worsened the situation, leading to a poorly chosen battle position. Wellington devised a plan to outflank the French, setting the stage for the Battle of Vittoria.|"['Question 1: What prompted Lord Wellington to reprimand the British army during the retreat?\nA) Extraordinary hardships faced\nB) Decline in discipline\nC) Loss of over nine thousand soldiers in battle\nD) Arrival at winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo\nE) Defeat of Napoleon in Russia', 'Question 2: What boosted the morale of the allied army before the decisive attack?\nA) Arrival at winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo\nB) Loss of over nine thousand soldiers\nC) Retreat to Vittoria\nD) Insurrections in the north of Spain\nE) Defeat of Napoleon in Russia', ""Question 3: What supported Lord Wellington's plans in Spain?\nA) French replenishing supplies\nB) Arrival at winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo\nC) Portuguese and Spanish forces\nD) Retreat to Vittoria\nE) Poorly chosen battle position"", ""Question 4: What worsened the situation for the French at Vittoria?\nA) French retreat to Vittoria\nB) Insurrections in the north of Spain\nC) Arrival at winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo\nD) Joseph's indecision and poor tactics\nE) Loss of over nine thousand soldiers in battle"", ""Question 5: What set the stage for the Battle of Vittoria?\nA) French replenishing supplies\nB) Loss of over nine thousand soldiers\nC) Retreat to Vittoria\nD) Wellington's reprimand\nE) Wellington's plan to outflank the French"", 'Question 6: What prompted the allied army to overwhelm the French in Spain?\nA) Retreat to Vittoria\nB) Loss of over nine thousand soldiers in battle\nC) Arrival at winter quarters near Ciudad Rodrigo\nD) French replenishing supplies\nE) Nearly a hundred thousand troops entering Spain']"|"['B) Decline in discipline', 'E) Defeat of Napoleon in Russia', 'C) Portuguese and Spanish forces', ""D) Joseph's indecision and poor tactics"", ""E) Wellington's plan to outflank the French"", 'E) Nearly a hundred thousand troops entering Spain']"
On the morning of June 21, 1813, as the rain fell and mist enveloped the area, the troops began their movement towards the Zadora river. Hill's forces swiftly captured the village of Puebla and started crossing the defile. A fierce battle erupted as the French troops met the Portuguese and British forces. Villette's division joined the French, while Hill sent reinforcements. Graham confronted Reille's division at Gamara Mayor, engaging in intense combat. Meanwhile, Wellington's main force faced delays but eventually seized a crucial unguarded bridge, outflanking the French. As the battle raged on, the allies made strategic advances, pushing the French back. The French, realizing their perilous position, retreated towards Vittoria, leaving behind their supplies and treasures, ultimately losing the battle and control of Spain.|"['1.

Ten days after the battle of Vittoria, Napoleon sent Soult, a skilled general, to replace Joseph and lead the French troops. Soult swiftly arrived at the border on July 11th, taking command and gathering troops from various regions. With an army of 114,000 men, he moved to relieve Pampeluna. Intense battles like Maya, Roncevalles, and Buenza ensued in the Pyrenees, known as the battles of the Pyrenees. Despite fierce fighting, the French suffered heavy losses. The Scudamores, like Sam, assisted Wellington's army diligently, running errands and gathering supplies. Sam's resourcefulness in finding food endeared him to the troops, even overcoming initial skepticism due to his race. Sam's ability to procure provisions, especially fowls and eggs, impressed and amused the soldiers, showcasing his clever tactics in bartering with local villagers.|"['1.

The Scudamores were pleased with Sam's approach, which even the strictest disciplinarian would approve. The siege of St. Sebastian during the Pyrenees battles led to a significant loss for the British troops due to inadequate siege preparations. The town was well fortified, with the Cask Redoubt and Mount Orgullo citadel. The assault on the fortress faced challenges, with a nighttime attack resulting in confusion and defeat. The second assault witnessed by the Scudamores also faced difficulties, with the fleet's neglect allowing reinforcements for the French garrison. General Graham oversaw the assault, which faced heavy fire but managed to push forward despite losses. Sam's keen observation helped anticipate the French's actions during the assault.|"[""1.

The soldiers charged towards the breach like a wave, but upon reaching the top, they were met with a deep gulf that separated them from the town. French musketry rained down upon them from every direction, preventing any further advance. Undeterred, the troops stood their ground, piling the breach with fallen comrades. Despite multiple attempts, each brave soul that mounted the breach was met with a storm of fire, falling beneath the onslaught. The assault seemed futile, with the French forces holding strong. However, a stroke of luck turned the tide when the French's own stored explosives caught fire, allowing the British to break through. After a fierce battle, the town of St. Sebastian was finally won, marking a significant victory in the campaign.|"['1.

The weather briefly halted operations, but Wellington was getting ready to cross the Adour River. Soult, guarding the river passages above Bayonne, never expected an attempt to bridge the wide and rough Adour below the town. With help from sailors, they bridged the river on February 13. Leaving General Hope at Bayonne, Wellington led the rest of the army to the Gave River. Initially, the French had the upper hand, but Wellington's strategic moves turned the tide. The French retreated towards Toulouse, leaving Bordeaux open to the British. Promotion for staff members was swift and less risky than for regimental officers. The Scudamores were promoted after their commendable conduct in battles. Lord Beresford assured the boys they would witness the upcoming battle near Toulouse. Lord Beresford's march to Bordeaux was unopposed, and they were welcomed by the city's upper class. Tom suspected an American banker in Bordeaux of being a scoundrel who caused their father's death. Lord Beresford led an operation to apprehend the banker with the Scudamores and troops.|"[""1.
