"The book ""Black Ivory"" delves into the grim reality of the slave trade, but our protagonists are not the ones engaged in it. The story kicks off with a shipwreck, leaving the charterer's son and his seaman friend stranded on the African coast. They encounter slave traders, despite British efforts to curb the trade. Hitching a ride on a captured dhow, they reach Zanzibar. After securing funds, they embark on an inland journey where they face the horrors of the trade. The narrative mostly focuses on their other encounters. The book sheds light on the harsh realities of the time, with the west coast nearly free of slavery due to British actions, unlike the east coast.

Harold was thrilled at the idea, but now faced with leaving the 'Aurora' behind at the end of a successful journey, he felt torn. The crew was prepared to lower the two largest boats with supplies. The man steering, a typical British sailor, suggested leaving, but Harold decided to stay on board. The ship was sinking fast. Despite the captain's regret, he had to abandon it for safety. Harold chose to remain, causing mixed reactions among the crew. Disco Lillihammer, a sailor, decided to stay with Harold despite the danger. As a wave hit, the ship capsized, throwing Harold and Disco into the sea. They swam ashore and were grateful for their rescue. Disco, missing his tobacco, joked about their situation. The current had carried some ship parts to the shore, helping them escape unnoticed by nearby armed natives.|"[""1.

Harold was the first to notice they weren't on an empty shore. As they pondered their next move, shouts caught their attention. Hurrying to a rocky point, they spotted the natives. Signaling Disco, they decided to retreat into the woods to plan. The climate made it clear they needed shelter and food. They stumbled upon a boat with unfamiliar sails and armed men across the creek. Harold explained their situation, hoping for help. Disco suggested working on the boat, but Harold felt uneasy about the situation. They were unsure about the trader's intentions but decided to stay cautious. Disco recommended avoiding the traders and seeking a nearby village. Harold, aware of the dangers of the African climate, insisted on finding safety first. Disco, unfamiliar with the African climate, trusted Harold's judgment.|"[""1.

"""I sail this night,"" he said, ""when the moon goes down. That's not far before midnight. You must keep close to the boat here. If you go this way or that, the locals will harm you. They won't come here; they know I am here. I am going to check on my belongings, my Black Ivory.""

""There is no need,"" said Yoosoof, gesturing towards the hut. ""Go; you can rest until we sail. Sleep; you will need it. There is a little rice in the hut—eat that, make a fire, dry yourselves.""

As they were preparing, two armed men approached, leading a girl with a brass ring around her neck. Harold cautioned, ""If we could free her by fighting, I would help you, but we can't. We've stumbled into a nest of slavers. Recklessness will only lead to our demise. Be wise; wait for the right moment, and we might yet make a difference.""

Disco, observing the scene, felt a surge of pity for the slave-girl. He had never truly grasped the horrors of slavery until now. ""I always thought all Africans had unattractive features,"" he mused. ""But look at her, she's different—pretty, you know. Her features are not what I expected. She's not black—she's brown."""|"[""1.

Disco was right in noticing the differences among the African tribes, some being handsome and distinct from the typical features we associate with the region. Among these tribes was a slave girl named Azinte, brought from the far interior. Despite her youth, she bore a look of deep sorrow and hardship, evident in her thin frame. Disco, a seaman, showed compassion towards her, wishing he could set her free. However, his companion, Harold, cautioned him to be discreet to avoid danger. Yoosoof, in another part of the story, discovered unguarded Arab boats with suspicious items like chains and bars. As he observed quietly, the scene hinted at a potential threat.|['1.

After about ten or fifteen minutes, Yoosoof looked up from his deep thoughts and saw a group of people emerging silently from the bushes. They were black men, women, and children, chained by the neck or wrists, and guarded by armed Portuguese. When around a hundred of them gathered by the creek, they were told to stop. Yoosoof spoke to the leader in Portuguese, instructing him to hurry and load the weakest slaves onto the small boat. These poor souls had endured a long, arduous journey, leaving them emaciated and frail. Despite their condition, they were quickly loaded onto boats for transport. Yoosoof, though having lost much of his cargo, was satisfied as the demand for slaves was high. The embarkation was swift and quiet, with only the sound of chains and occasional cries of pain. With more slaves to be acquired, Yoosoof left with a young girl named Azinte, showing both haste and grace in his movements.|['1.

Nevertheless, the small town boasted a mud fort, a modest army of about thirty Portuguese convict soldiers, and a Governor appointed by the Governor-General in Mozambique. It was known for its trade in ivory, ebony, and other native goods, as well as a hidden trade in slaves. Yoosoof hurried to meet the Governor, Senhor Francisco Alfonso Toledo Bignoso Letotti, who was conversing with his daughter, Senhorina Maraquita. The Senhorina, having recently arrived from Portugal, was intrigued by Yoosoof's trade. As they chatted, a British war-steamer anchored in the bay caught their attention. The conversation shifted to the risks of trading, with the Governor cautioning Yoosoof of the dangers involved. Marizano, a local, joined in, contrasting his own misfortunes with Yoosoof's success. The Governor, amused by their banter, allowed Marizano to stay during their meeting, acknowledging Yoosoof's skill as a trader despite the risks he faced.|['1.

Senhor Letotti asked how the plan to evade the English cruiser would work, knowing the captain's vigilance in tracking the slave traders. The British cruiser, when capturing slaves on the East African coast, must sail to specific ports to free them to prevent re-enslavement. During the cruisers' absence, traders exploit the opportunity to smuggle slaves to Arabia and Persia. Yoosoof believed the 'Firefly' captain might have to offload the slaves due to limited provisions and their health. The Senhorina, in distress, observed an Arab, his friend, and Azinte. Lieutenant Lindsay, in love with the Senhorina, was sent to bring them to the Governor's house, unaware of the situation's complexity. Lindsay caught up with the group, urging Azinte's return to avoid the Governor's wrath. The Senhorina convinced her father to buy Azinte, saving her from a grim fate. Later, Lindsay met Captain Romer and Mr. Small for dinner, discussing the ongoing slave trade investigations. Jackson, a sailor, learned about the corrupt practices of local authorities in the slave trade.|"[""1.

British ships were stationed on the east coast of Africa to combat the exportation of slaves. They did not interfere with domestic slavery, which was legal in some areas. Jackson, a sailor, overheard a conversation between an Arab and an Englishman about plans to shipwreck Englishmen and throw them overboard to avoid detection. The Arab's information was a trick to lure the British cruiser. The Governor, despite being hospitable, was involved in underhand schemes related to the slave trade. He praised efforts to stop the trade but failed to mention the mistreatment of slaves in his town. The Arab traders used deceptive tactics to smuggle slaves. The Governor's slaves, although well cared for, were still considered his property.|"['1.

Governor Letotti refrained from mentioning the cruelties of slavery to avoid upsetting his guests. Instead, he entertained them with coffee and music. Lindsay shared the heartbreaking story of Azinte, a captured woman separated from her family. Despite her kind owners, her situation was dire. The captain's ship set sail, secretly aiming to intercept a slave ship. Meanwhile, Yoosoof plotted to keep his captives to mislead the authorities. A sudden struggle ensued as Harold and Disco resisted being chained. Despite their valiant efforts, they were overpowered and subdued by the slavers.

After the traders secured the Englishmen, they were led to the dhow moored by the creek. Harold and his companion thought it was the same boat, but it was different. Inside, slaves were cramped and worn out. The hold was dark, but they could see rows of slaves. The smell confirmed their fears. The slavers rowed away boldly, showing no fear of being caught. As they navigated through narrow channels, the slaves' pitiful cries echoed. Harold and Disco sat silently, bound and guarded. They fell into a troubled sleep. When Harold woke at dawn, he saw the miserable state of the slaves. They were packed tightly, suffering from the journey. The sun rose, revealing the horror in the hold. Harold and Disco were speechless, overwhelmed by the situation. Yoosoof and his crew ate while the slaves watched, hungry and suffering.|['1.

"Yoosoof's boat was adrift, with Harold and Disco bound and unable to help themselves. A steamer, the ""Firefly,"" approached, causing Yoosoof to navigate towards breakers to evade capture.

On a particular occasion, the man-of-war faced a troubling situation with a large cargo of slaves aboard. Captain Romer had to rush to the Seychelles Islands, sailing against the monsoon. Meanwhile, another vessel with a similar cargo headed to Aden, leaving the seas less guarded. This allowed Arab traders to seize the opportunity, sending out numerous ships filled with slaves along the East African coast. Among these ships were the four large dhows of Yoosoof. Despite some sacrifices, Yoosoof loaded up his living cargo and set sail. Each man cost him four yards of cotton cloth, women three yards, and children two yards. The slaves would then be sold at varying prices in different regions. This story is just a glimpse of the horrors of the slave trade in Africa, where thousands are taken annually.|['1.

The man explained that a mother had sold her young child, a chubby two-year-old boy, to a trader who came by recently. The trader only wanted the boy and not the mother, so he bought the child. The mother initially resisted but was quickly subdued by the trader. Disco, a character in the story, reacted with anger and forcefully pushed the man away. He and his friend then headed to the harbor to inquire about trading dhows heading south, trying to calm their emotions. The harbor was bustling with dhows loaded with slaves. The narrative sheds light on the grim reality of the slave trade, where even the Sultan of Zanzibar, who professed to oppose it, derived a significant portion of his revenue from taxing slave exports. Despite the knowledge and awareness of the situation, the slave trade continued unabated. Disco and his friend eventually found a reputable dhow for their journey to the Zambesi, preparing with goods like cotton, brass wire, and beads commonly traded with African natives.|"['1.

Embarking on the dhow with favorable wind and weather, Harold and Disco sailed to the Zambesi river mouths, reaching Quillimane port. They encountered a British cruiser once but were allowed to continue after inspection. The town of Quillimane, known for the slave trade, was inhospitable due to its location. Harold and Disco faced challenges procuring men for their journey. Despite initial difficulties, they remained determined to reach the East Luavo mouth of the river. Disco expressed distrust towards the Arab skipper, suspecting involvement in the slave trade. Harold emphasized perseverance to overcome obstacles.

Returning to the conversation, the main concern was finding an interpreter. The protagonist, Harold Seadrift, could only speak French, Latin, and Greek, which wouldn't help much among the locals. His ally, Disco Lillihammer, was skilled in seafaring but lacked language skills. However, he introduced Antonio, a man with knowledge of various languages. Despite Antonio's comical appearance and flawed language skills, he was willing to join as an interpreter for a modest payment of cotton cloth and a gun. Harold agreed to pay him monthly in cloth and a gun at the end of the journey. With Antonio's help, Harold managed to recruit a diverse group of nine men to accompany them on their adventure, including half-caste brothers, wild tribesmen, and experienced travelers.|"['1.

"Harold armed everyone with guns and knives for their journey into the African interior. He and Disco carried Enfield rifles, while Harold also brought a spare heavy-caliber rifle for large game. Landing near the East Luavo mouth of the Zambesi, they found two canoes and set off, leaving the Arab skipper behind. As they rowed up the smooth river, the men enjoyed the calm morning, watching wild-fowl and monkeys. Jumbo, one of the Makololo men, skillfully steered the canoe. Disco, relaxing with his pipe, marveled at the reflected world in the still river. The peaceful atmosphere led Disco to coin the term ""sailumterracious,"" meaning heaven on earth.

Antonio's English was a mix of various broken languages he had picked up from different cultures he encountered in his travels. His excitement was evident as he gestured wildly and used his unique language to express his joy. Jumbo, a black crew member, chuckled at the situation, finding amusement in the interactions onboard. Disco, another sailor, with a penchant for exploring nature, engaged in a conversation with Antonio about the abundant wildlife they observed around them. They marveled at the crabs busily sifting through the sand for food and the peculiar behavior of the blenny fish in the nearby pool.

Upon seeing the coast clear, the blenny, an amphibious creature, hopped onto dry land. This African blenny is quite unique, spending as much time out of the water as in it. It is most active during low tide when it crawls onto the sand using its fins and stands up to look for flies to feed on. Disco, a seaman, watched as the blenny caught flies by leaping at them. Suddenly, another blenny appeared and tried to take over the first blenny's spot. A fierce battle ensued between the two blennies, with Disco cheering them on.

In the dense jungle canopy, Disco, a lover of monkeys, was captivated by the creatures. His lifelong fascination with monkeys led him to observe their behavior keenly. As he watched, a small monkey with a sad expression caught his attention. The monkey's melancholy demeanor stood out among the lively troop. Suddenly, a larger, fierce monkey rudely displaced the sad one, causing a commotion. The mother monkey, preoccupied with chasing the troublemaker, left her tiny offspring clinging to her waist. The chaos revealed that the jungle was full of monkeys observing the strangers. Disco, overwhelmed by the jungle's wonders, had to tear himself away reluctantly. The unfamiliar sights and sounds of equatorial Africa left him in a constant state of astonishment, making him swallow flies and navigate his canoe clumsily.

"""Get up your steam and go alongside,"" he said to Jumbo one afternoon as the two canoes quietly navigated among tall giant-reeds, sedges, and bulrushes towering above them. ""There are many twists and turns in it. And such strong reflections of those reeds in the calm water. When I gaze dreamily at them for a while, I start to imagine they're palm trees and we're sailing through an endless forest. And when I look over the side and see each reed mirrored below, following the reflection down till my eyes get lost in the blue sky and clouds below us, I sometimes feel like we're in the middle of fairyland, floating on air, on a voyage through the universe! But it's the reflections that I like the most. Every leaf, stalk, and flag is just as real in the water as out of it. And look at that frog on the big leaf, which plopped down like lead. He was sitting on his own clear reflection. There's so much variety here. You never know what you'll find in these swamps.

One morning, shortly after Zombo's encounter with the crocodile, Disco's canoe unexpectedly came across a herd of elephants feasting on palm-nuts. Startled, the elephants scattered as Disco fumbled for his rifle. A baby elephant tripped and fell, risking the wrath of its mother. Quick to act, Disco grabbed the young elephant's trunk and pulled it into the canoe. However, the baby elephant proved more troublesome than expected, leading to the decision to release it back to its mother. The journey continued, with a stop at a village where they encountered a cruel half-caste known for his brutality towards slaves.

"The details of this situation were well-known. The Portuguese Governor and justice officials were aware, yet no action was taken to punish the wrongdoer or safeguard his slaves. However, when the slaves fought back and killed their master, suddenly there was a rush to deliver ""justice."" Soldiers were dispatched, some canoe-men were shot, and the rest were caught and brutally whipped to death. This is the grim reality of ""domestic slavery"" in Africa.

The sympathetic sailor patted Chimbolo on the back, encouraging him not to lose hope. He shared a motto from the great Nelson, urging Chimbolo to stay strong despite being in difficult circumstances. Antonio relayed this message, but Chimbolo remained despondent, gazing at the ruins. The group journeyed through a beautiful yet wild country, with dense vegetation and hidden villages. As they neared Zomba mountains, they encountered distressed Manganja men who had suffered at the hands of the Ajawa. The men sought their chief's help to counter the Ajawa's attacks. Chimbolo revealed his connection to Marunga, who had been taken by slavers led by Marizano. The group decided to search for survivors and aid the afflicted Manganja.

As they emerged into an open space, a troop of women and a couple of boys walked towards them, led by Chimbolo with a child on his shoulder, performing a peculiar dance. Among them was Marunga, the only one returning to joy after a devastating loss. Chimbolo's exuberant display of affection towards his wife and child, though unrefined, showed a deep emotional bond. Harold reflected on Yoosoof's misconceptions about the lack of affection in black hearts.

One day, a hippopotamus left the river to find food. He was tired of playing and needed to eat grass. As he waddled along, his huge lips mowed down the grass like a machine. He had to move away from the river to find more grass. Unknowingly, he walked under a beam set up by a chief to catch him. The hippopotamus triggered the trap, and the beam fell on him, piercing his back with a poisoned spike. Despite his agility, he succumbed to the poison and died. The chief and his men returned to the village with the hippopotamus meat. The chief, Kambira, led his group through a lush landscape with rivulets towards their village. The land was fertile, and the villagers were busy farming various crops like maize, millet, and beans. The village was surrounded by a hedge of euphorbia trees, providing shade and protection.

In the village, the blacksmith's anvil rang out, a sound that would be familiar to English ears. The natives, despite their savage appearance, had a skilled blacksmith who crafted iron tools with great dexterity. The Manganja people were hardworking, mining iron ore, smelting it, and forging various items like hoes and bracelets. Kambira, after observing the village scene, descended towards it. Children, chubby and excited, ran towards him, stealing pieces of raw meat. Kambira warmly welcomed them, engaging in playful antics with a child named Obo.

A man was running down the path towards the village with urgent news. He arrived breathless, warning of slavers led by a cruel man named Marizano armed with guns heading towards the valley. The villagers, fearing the leader's cruelty and powerful weapons, prepared for the worst. The man explained how slavers often incite conflicts to capture people as slaves. The approaching danger led the women and children to flee to safety in the bush. The older villagers struggled to keep up, showing the panic in their eyes.

Antonio mentioned Bishop Mackenzie and Dr. Livingstone, who were respected missionaries. Bishop Mackenzie led a mission among the Manganja hills in 1861, showing Christian love and courage. They gained influence but faced challenges due to wars caused by slave-traders. The missionaries, including Bishop Mackenzie, died due to the harsh conditions. Antonio faced skepticism from Kambira, a Manganja chief, who questioned the truthfulness of the visitors' intentions. To prove their honesty, a plan was devised with signals and precautions. Eventually, Kambira welcomed them, and a feast and dance ensued. Harold planned to rest his men and hunt game in the area.

In the village, most men took pride in their unique hairstyles. Some wore long coils down their backs, others fashioned their hair like buffalo horns, and a few let it hang in large masses or shaved it into patterns. But one young man stood out with innumerable tails stiffened with bark fillets radiating from his head. His simple attire included a white calico kilt.

Obo, playful and fond of his father, received a friendly punch that landed him in a hippopotamus dish, causing a brief alarm.

Harold and his companions encountered hippopotami by a river, but decided not to disturb them due to fresh elephant and buffalo traces. Harold fired a shot to startle the hippopotami, causing them to retreat into the water. They then noticed lizards and zebras in the area.

The group then heard a herd of buffalo approaching and quickly moved to a clearing to see them disappear into the jungle. Suddenly, Disco spotted two serpents in a tree, firing in panic and causing a commotion. Smoke from a fire drove out a buffalo, chasing Jumbo towards the river. Despite multiple shots, the buffalo remained resilient until Harold's final shot took it down. The hunters marveled at the varying resilience of different animals to gunfire.|['1.

As Antonio neared the tree, the buffalo sprang up like a cat and charged. Antonio dashed towards the tree, his legs a blur, and climbed just in time to escape the battering-ram force of the buffalo. The buffalo paused, glared, and charged again, but Harold's shot brought it down. Disco, out of breath, joined Harold by the fallen beast, remarking on the close call. Kambira warned that lions were harder to find and more dangerous than elephants. Disco, preferring lions, followed Harold. Meanwhile, another group of hunters, armed with bows and arrows, approached a buffalo herd. A vigilant bird perched on the buffalo's back warned them of danger. The hunters used poisoned arrows to bring down a buffalo. The herd fled, but the hunters tracked and successfully took down the stricken animal.|"['1.

During a hunting expedition, Harold and his companions encountered an enormous crocodile attacking a water-buck. The injured animal managed to escape the crocodile's jaws and began swimming across a stream. Another crocodile attempted to attack it, but Harold swiftly shot at the predator, deterring it. The water-buck made it back to the bank but succumbed to its injuries. The group continued their hunt, and Disco, eager to encounter larger game, led a small party. They stumbled upon a herd of elephants, and Disco's precise command led to a successful shot, causing the elephants to flee.

The villagers were filled with excitement and chaos after the successful hunt of the elephant. Disco, the seaman, managed to calm them down with his commanding voice. He ordered everyone to head back to camp to gather knives and dishes for the elephant's meat. Despite Jumbo's attempt to scare Disco, the seaman remained vigilant, ready for any danger. Jumbo's prank made Disco nervous, thinking there might be a lion lurking nearby. As he waited for the villagers to return, Disco stayed alert, prepared for any potential threats.|"['1.

Jumbo laughed loudly as he saw a yellow monkey in the leaves above. He quickly threw his spear and brought down the monkey, leaving it on the ground for his friends to find. Disco, mistaking the sound for a lion, fired into the bush, only to find the monkey. Laughter and delight filled the air as they cut up the elephant's meat. The camp settled into a peaceful night, with Harold and Disco the only ones awake, Harold making notes while Disco smoked his pipe. The natives, having feasted and danced, lay down to rest. The night passed quietly, with stars overhead and fires flickering below, as the hunters prepared to return to camp.|"['1.

During the night, as the camp settled down after supper, the sleepers began to wake up one by one. They stirred the fires and started cooking again. Soon, the whole camp was bustling with activity. Pots bubbled, roasts sizzled, and songs filled the air. Kambira instructed his men to cook an elephant's foot at Harold's fire. The foot was roasted in a hole in the ground, covered with hot ashes and soil. The dish turned out to be delicious, resembling sweet, gelatinous marrow. However, the travelers learned that a long walk was needed to avoid any digestive issues. The natives around them had diverse tastes, some preferring boiled meat, others roast, and a few enjoying porridge made from mapira meal. The debate at the neighboring fire caught the travelers' attention. Antonio translated the heated discussion, which started with a comparison of ostrich toes to human fingers but shifted to political matters, showing that political discussions happen even in Africa.|"[""1.

"Frizzyhead adamantly declared, ""No use at all. We could govern ourselves better, so what's the use of them?

Flatnose, a loyal subject, defended the chief, stating, ""Is not the chief the father of the people? Can there be people without a father? The chief is wise, but his children are fools!""

Harold and his friends found themselves in a perplexing situation in the jungles of central Africa. Kambira, the chief, was determined to search for his missing wife, Azinte. Despite the urgency in Kambira's voice, Harold was torn between returning to the coast or venturing further into the interior. The chief's unwavering devotion to his lost wife contrasted with the customs of other African leaders who had multiple wives. Harold sympathized with Kambira's plight but realized the challenges ahead. The uncertainty of Azinte's whereabouts, possibly sold into slavery, made the chief's quest seem almost impossible. Additionally, leaving the protection of the Englishmen would expose Kambira to the dangers of falling into the hands of slave traders. The group's journey back to the village was hastened by the fear of imminent danger, only to find the village peaceful upon their return.|"[""1.

Harold couldn't bring himself to explain much of this to his friend. He did, however, emphasize the possibility of death or slavery. The chief wasn't afraid of death and felt slavery could be exchanged for it. Harold convinced him to wait a month before returning to take him to the coast. Despite some unease, they agreed it was the only option. The next day, they resumed their exploration. Kambira bid them farewell, and as they looked back, they saw him standing proudly. The travelers left with regret, waving goodbye. Later, Harold mistook glow-worm eyes for a lion's and caused a commotion. The incident led to laughter and discussion around the campfire, with Antonio joining in noisily. Disco's skepticism about lions in Africa was quickly dispelled when a real lion roared near their camp, leaving everyone in awe.|"[""1.

Kambira, a skilled hunter, wields a sharp spear and hunts buffalo swiftly. He also enjoys thick porridge and fearlessly faces lions, hippos, and even elephants. The English visitors witness his exceptional hunting abilities and admire his marksmanship with guns. The group is startled when a lion interrupts their music, causing a brief commotion. Chimbolo, believing lions to house the souls of chiefs, scolds the lion for stealing buffalo meat, amusing the travelers. Despite Chimbolo's scolding, the lion continues to feast, unfazed.

Harold and his men encountered a lion in the jungle. Despite attempts to scare it away with gunfire, the lion lingered nearby. To avoid danger, they kept a watchful eye and maintained bright campfires. The men's sleeping bags were unique, open on the side for easy access. As they journeyed, they encountered elephants and various animals. The group had a routine: rising early, packing up, and traveling on foot. They covered 12 to 15 miles daily, resting during the heat of the day. Harold and Disco treated their guides with respect and kindness, unlike some travelers who mistreated locals.

In the wild, two English explorers ventured into a rich land teeming with life. They encountered elephants cooling off in a pond, zebras, waterbucks, wild pigs, and playful monkeys. Each day, they set off to hunt for fresh meat with their guide Chimbolo, interpreter Antonio, and the jester Mokompa. The explorers marveled at the country's potential for cotton cultivation, coal mining, and other resources, but lamented the impact of the slave trade. As they journeyed through varied landscapes, they encountered abundant wildlife and human settlements engaged in peaceful activities. In one particularly quiet spot, the stillness was broken by the sight of animals taking a midday rest, reminding the explorers of the vibrant life surrounding them.|['1.

Halting to rest the group in a shady spot, Harold lay down on the grass while Disco, not in the mood to smoke after just finishing his fifth pipe, wandered ahead. Suddenly, Disco crouched behind a bush and ran back to Harold, signaling wildly. Down in a gorge, a shocking sight met the Englishmen's eyes. They saw a procession of slaves, chained together with expressions of terror and despair. The slaves were being led by armed men, and some showed signs of defiance. The men wore slave-sticks around their necks, and lash marks covered their bodies. Women and children were also bound and marched naked, carrying only essentials for the journey. Harold and Disco were filled with horror and anger at the scene. Disco was particularly moved when a woman with an infant fell, and he witnessed the brutality of the slavers. Overwhelmed with rage, Disco confronted the slaver Marizano, unable to contain his fury.|['1.

It is likely that the mixed-race leader, who was not lacking in bravery, would have stood his ground if his attacker had been a person of color. However, the sudden appearance of a white man with a fierce expression and blue eyes that gleamed as he charged forward with unstoppable rage was too overwhelming for him. In a panic, Marizano fired inaccurately and fled into the forest, followed by his men. But they were pursued by a large group of Ajawa warriors armed with bows and poisoned arrows. The Portuguese chief stopped and rallied his men, seeking cover behind trees to fight back. Witnessing this, Harold gathered his men and coordinated a volley that completely defeated the slave traders. Meanwhile, Disco, unable to catch Marizano, finally knelt down, took aim, and shot him in the arm, causing him to flee. Returning to the slaves, they were freed with some difficulty, especially the men with riveted gorees that required hatchets to remove. Amid excitement and conversation, fires were lit, and the women were encouraged to cook a meal for themselves and their children. The captives, initially hesitant, eventually devoured the food voraciously, expressing gratitude and relief. Harold, an Englishman who detested slavery, planned to speak with the freed captives after the meal. Approximately a hundred individuals, mostly women and children, enjoyed the meal, displaying signs of recovery from their past hardships.

Harold and Disco encountered a group of enslaved people led by a kind-hearted man who shared their tragic story. The merchants in the town of Tette were heavily involved in the slave trade to obtain ivory. The Banyai tribe, once elephant hunters, were forced to trade women and children for ivory due to a conflict with the Matabele tribe. The merchants, under Portuguese rule, paid tribute to avoid being expelled by a savage tribe. Although Portuguese law banned the export slave trade, they engaged in domestic slave trade through violent means. The enslaved people Harold and Disco encountered had no home left due to cruel Marizano's atrocities. Despite the challenges, Harold and Disco decided to leave provisions for the enslaved and continue their journey, hoping to find a way to help them.|"['1.

"The legal traders in the Sultan's dominions use boats to transport slaves between different parts of the region. These boats are distinguished from pirate vessels by carrying papers that label them as ""legal traders."" However, these traders are actually deceivers who transport a large number of slaves each year, far exceeding what is needed domestically. The Sultan profits from allowing this slave trade, receiving payment for each slave imported into Zanzibar. Despite efforts to stop this trade, many slaves are still smuggled by traders pretending they are part of the crew.

Marizano decided to help them escape slavery. The villagers welcomed the strangers. Marizano claimed to be a slave-trader but offered to guide the white men to safety. Harold and Disco were unsure of his intentions but had no choice. They joined the slave-gang for protection. The villagers were sad to see them leave.

At the beginning, most slaves stayed in line, except for a few weak ones and the lazy ones who were controlled with ropes and chains. Harold and Disco avoided their leader during the journey. Marizano respected their choice. They cooked away from the camp to avoid seeing the slaves' suffering. They considered leaving but realized it was futile. Marizano revealed he was an Arab trader. They reached a lake where a dhow awaited them. They were surprised to see the trader. Disco expressed his disdain but felt powerless. They doubted if the cruelty they witnessed was real. Illness weakened their resolve. They faced a swamp with a large slave-gang led by Marizano. Harold and Disco sat down, exhausted, as the gang prepared to cross the swamp. Antonio and Jumbo stayed with them.|"['1.

The leader of the gang paused, showing signs of fatigue and fear. He was young and frail, worn out by the harsh treatment and heavy workload. The slave-traders cared little for the well-being of their captives, finding it easier to discard weak individuals rather than waste time resting them. When the leader hesitated, a driver lashed him, drawing blood from his already wounded back. Despite the pain, he silently pleaded for mercy with his eyes, receiving only more lashes. Disco and Harold intervened, offering water and compassion to the suffering man. As the slave-gang trudged through the swamp, some collapsed from exhaustion, left behind to die or be devoured by wild animals. The children suffered the most, their small legs struggling in the treacherous terrain.

Harold and Disco did not see this, but they heard a cry of despair as the man they were helping passed away. They left quickly, not looking back, planning to head into the swamp away from the scene. Suddenly, a group of men emerged from the woods and ran towards them. It was Jose, Nakoda, Chimbolo, Mabruki, and the rest of their friends. There was excitement, laughter, and tears as they reunited. Zombo took charge and led them out of the swamp. They halted to discuss the situation. Zombo shared the news that the slave-hunter was close. The group decided to prepare food and supplies for their return. Harold was concerned about their safety as they set off to confront the slavers. The next day, Zombo and his men returned with the entire slave-gang, having defeated Marizano and his followers.

After handing over his duties, Zombo, the loyal assistant, stepped away, leaving our protagonist in a tough spot as a worn-out man responsible for leading an expedition and managing a large group of slaves in an unfamiliar part of equatorial Africa. Yoosoof, a trader, had recently departed for the coast with a considerable number of slaves, leaving the Englishmen under the care of a half-caste. Yoosoof traveled a perilous route from Lake Nyassa to Kilwa, a distance of about 500 miles. This path was described as a land of death and desolation by Livingstone, with many slaves perishing en route due to the cruelties of the slavers. Despite starting with thousands of slaves, Yoosoof arrived at Kilwa with only a fraction of them, as most succumbed to exhaustion or mistreatment along the way. The loss was significant, but the surviving slaves were to be sold for profit, albeit in a severely weakened state.|"[""1.

Moosa was brutally punishing a small boy while a man lay wounded nearby. The man, a former chief, had been struck down by Moosa for interfering. Despite the man's injuries, Moosa showed no mercy. Yoosoof, however, saw value in the man and his son as slaves to sell. The man, named Kambira, had endured brutal treatment, but his spirit remained unbroken. Obo, his son, clung to him despite the hardships. Yoosoof planned to sell them together for a better price. Kambira, once a proud chief, now bore the scars of his suffering. Despite his ordeal, the bond with his son was his only solace. Separating them would unleash Kambira's wrath, making him more dangerous than any wild beast.|"['1.

The Arab mentioned that the time allowed for the Zanzibar slave trade had ended, but despite the ban, many slaves were exported. Yoosoof planned to evade the blockade and sail the next day. The slaves were tightly packed on the upper deck, sitting shoulder to shoulder without space to move. Below, another layer of people sat on a bamboo deck, and even lower was a dark, filthy hold where Kambira and little Obo were placed. This cruel arrangement was not out of mercy but to ensure Kambira's survival and to subdue him. The conditions were unbearable, with no air, light, or room to move, fed only enough to survive.

A man sat next to Kambira on the dark dhow, showing signs of illness. Despite the darkness, Kambira sensed his suffering through groans and tremors. One night, the man's groans ceased, and he leaned on the chief before turning cold - he had passed away. The crew discovered more deceased and dying slaves in the hold. Moosa, the dhow's leader, took charge. He inspected the slaves, assisted by armed men, and threw overboard those infected. Passengers and crew watched silently. Children and diseased slaves were cast into the sea. The decision became harder with healthier slaves. Some resisted, leading to unfortunate ends. Despite efforts to contain the disease, many lives were lost. Moosa's resolve wavered, and the spread of the sickness could not be halted, leaving the remaining slaves to fate.|['1.

While Moosa's vessel sailed towards the land to find water, two other dhows under Yoosoof and Suliman were lost from sight. Despite this, they were all headed to the same Persian port and hoped to reunite there, if British cruisers allowed it. Moosa, cautious of the cruisers, delayed landing to avoid capture, risking the lives of the thirsty slaves on board. Eventually, Moosa steered towards the land to fetch water. At the same time, two cutters from H.M.S. `Firefly' spotted the dhow. A chase ensued, with gunfire and rockets exchanged. The dhow's sail was brought down, and after a fierce struggle, the crew surrendered. The slaves were transferred to `Firefly,' revealing a grim sight of suffering and illness among them.|"[""1.

Captain Romer's primary concern was transporting the rescued slaves to a safe place for care. Initially, he disembarked the crew and passengers, except for Moosa and three men. The dirty dhow was then deliberately sunk, and the `Firefly' headed to Aden, the closest port for freeing the rescued slaves. Africa's blood flow faces three main routes for the slave trade, and to stop it effectively, all three channels must be closed. Significant progress has been made in Zanzibar, but more work is needed in Portuguese territories and Egypt. Establishing refuge points and introducing the Bible are crucial for curing the continent's woes. Great Britain must secure land to create Christian settlements, offering protection from slave traders and teaching Christianity and civilization. These centers could halt the slave trade while spreading light and freedom across Africa.|"[""1.

In summary, as a nation, we should push for the immediate end of the slave trade in Portuguese territories, ensure that treaty obligations are met by various leaders, establish effective consular offices as needed, acquire mainland territories for stated purposes, and collectively support missionary work to spread Christianity to the African people. By doing so, we can halt the Eastern slave trade, uplift equatorial Africa, and boost global commerce and happiness. Harold and Disco, English travelers, witnessed a slave being cruelly whipped and decided to seek help from Governor Letotti. Despite initial reluctance, the Governor eventually pardoned the slave. However, when Harold and Disco were away, the slave was punished to death. This tragedy led Harold to refuse further hospitality from the Governor.

Harold assured his friends that he would settle Azinte comfortably in Cape Town through his father's business connection. He had a special reason for taking Azinte there. Harold wanted to reunite Azinte with a young lady named Senhorina Maraquita Letotti. Maraquita desired to have Azinte back not as a slave but as a friend. Slavery was prohibited in English settlements, and Maraquita shared Harold's abhorrence for it. They planned to travel to Cape Town where Maraquita resided. Despite challenges like the slave trade, missionaries continued spreading the Gospel truth. Chimbolo, with his family, sought refuge in the interior, grateful to the Englishmen who rescued him. Harold, along with his companions, embarked on a journey to Zanzibar and eventually Cape Town. There, Harold met Maraquita and her aunt, who introduced him to her friend, Alice Gray. Harold fell in love with Alice and made plans to establish a branch of his family's business in Cape Town. Disco stayed behind to assist Kambira at Maraquita's request.
