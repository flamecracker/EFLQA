""Well, I'm not sure,"" Allen pondered, ""that part wasn't very thrilling, but wait until you hear what happened next. After locating the recruitment office, we returned to our hotel and enjoyed a hearty breakfast. We knew we were about to embark on a risky journey and wanted to fuel up.""

""What's next?"" Allen inquired, stretching his legs. ""Let me recall. Ah, yes! After our substantial breakfast, we headed out again to face our fate. By then, we were so anxious that we almost mistook a café for the recruitment station.""

""Hey, speak for yourself,"" Roy interjected, turning to the girls with a smile. ""We had to distract Allen with a street performer before guiding him to the right place.""

""After nervously climbing the stairs, we entered a room with open windows and several serious-looking men, likely doctors,"" Allen continued. ""There were a few other men waiting to be examined. We were then directed behind a screen with others to undress for the examination.""

""Yes, Will joined us,"" Allen confirmed. ""But after reaching the hotel and discussing enlisting, he opted out, citing personal matters. We don't know what he was up to, but I trust he has valid reasons. How about some biscuits, Betty?""

Betty expressed her desire to join the Y.W.C.A. to be close to Mrs. Barton Ross, whose company made her feel uplifted like after church. On a stormy evening, Roy found it dizzying to watch the girls knit all day and evening. Mollie suggested the guys learn to knit, mentioning a men's knitting club. The conversation turned to Herb, who had to report for duty suddenly, leaving without saying goodbye. Frank envied Herb for having received his orders, finding the waiting nerve-wracking. Will's behavior puzzled his friends, as he seemed distant from the patriotic spirit. Allen, feeling perplexed, hoped for the best understanding Will's situation.|"[""1.

Betty hung up the phone with a jerk, tears streaming down her cheeks. She tried to compose herself, brushing away the tears and reaching for her handkerchief.

Betty exclaimed, ""Another ship!"" eagerly listening to the boys sharing details. ""If only I were a man,"" she clenched her hands, ""I'd fight until every enemy was gone.""

Frank added, ""We may not defeat them all, but we'll make the enemy surrender. I can't wait to get into the action!""

Mollie snapped at Amy, feeling like a beast for her outburst. Betty pondered about Camp Liberty, the boys' training camp nearby.

The following weeks were full of excitement, and the girls even forgot about missing the boys. The boys, on the other hand, seemed a bit upset that the girls didn't seem to miss them much. Allen had written to Betty expressing his feelings about being missed. The girls were busy organizing events to raise funds for the Hostess House and the young men of Deepdale were away at training camps.

As the girls eagerly listened to the detailed instructions, trying their best to stay still, Mollie felt like screaming from the sheer torture of sitting quietly.

"""I saw you coming, my dears,"" she said, sitting comfortably in a big chair, ""and I'm almost sure I know what you have come to ask me. And you needn't even ask,"" she added, raising her hand as Betty started to speak, ""for the request was granted two weeks ago. My whole house is at your disposal--to do with as you please.""

The Little Captain caught a quick glimpse of the man darting into a doorway to hide. She grabbed a large piece of wood as a makeshift weapon and dashed towards the door. Upon cautiously opening it, she realized the man was trapped inside, frantically trying to open the locked door. As the man pushed against the door, the girls braced themselves, knowing they were outnumbered. Just as things seemed dire, the sound of approaching footsteps brought relief. Help was on the way. The man, Adolph Hensler, proved difficult even when faced with loaded revolvers. Eventually, he was subdued, and the girls, along with their captors, made their way back home.
