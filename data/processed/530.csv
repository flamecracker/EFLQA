When the young boy, Carl, had been laboring for a few hours, his hunger began to grow. The physical exertion from his work and his stroll had made him ravenous to the point of discomfort. It was precisely noon when the farmer's wife appeared at the front entrance and blew a fish horn so loudly that it could have been heard from a considerable distance. She instructed Carl to wash up in the tin basin and provided a chair for him at the table. The farmer's wife served a simple boiled dinner of corned beef and vegetables, followed by apple pudding, which Carl thoroughly enjoyed. As they sat at the supper table, rain started to pour outside. Carl decided to stay the night for a modest fee of fifteen cents. The following day, he resumed his journey, declining further work offers. Hungry and unable to find a nearby restaurant, he knocked on a house's door hoping to buy a meal. However, no one responded. Carl then peered into a barn, but it was empty.

Carl positioned himself discreetly behind a stone wall across from the factory, located just outside the village.

Carl hesitated but decided to inquire further. The striking similarity between the man before him and his stepbrother sparked curiosity. Could there be a connection?

Carl felt a mix of emotions as he prepared to confront the startling truth about his stepmother's past. Despite his dislike for her, the revelation of her criminal history shocked him. He pondered if his father, Dr. Crawford, was aware of her dark past. The thought of his father unknowingly marrying a convicted criminal troubled Carl deeply. He believed that once his father learned the truth, their family dynamics would change. Dr. Crawford's strong moral principles would likely lead to a separation from his stepmother. Carl hoped this would bring them closer together. As he embarked on a journey to Buffalo, Carl couldn't shake the worry about the impact of this revelation on his family.

After leaving home, I faced some challenges but was fortunate to find work with a furniture manufacturer, Mr. Jennings. He pays me two dollars a week and provides a place to stay.

Mr. Jennings started like me and is now successful, inspiring me to aim for a similar future. Meanwhile, Dr. Crawford, noticing my letter, defends me to his wife, who suspects my intentions.

Despite her husband's carelessness, the woman was determined to find and read the letter secretly. She was confident she would stumble upon it somewhere, and she was proven right when she discovered Carl's letter in her husband's desk that very day.

Unfazed, she believed she could maintain her influence over her husband. Reading further, she came across Carl's lament about not being able to live at home due to the hostility from his stepmother and Peter.

Carl continued his journey to Buffalo and enjoyed the daylight trip over the Central road. His plan was to make a full-day trip back to appreciate the scenery. In Buffalo, he focused on Mr. Jennings' business and explored furniture stores, securing significant orders. Later, he headed to Niagara to witness the falls at dawn. Despite intending to retire early, he overslept and encountered a sociable man on the piazzas. The man discussed Lord Bedford, noting his plain appearance and contrasting it with the more distinguished Mr. Stuyvesant. Stuyvesant, unaware of Carl's presence, spoke highly of England. Carl, recognizing a stolen necktie on Stuyvesant, approached Lord Bedford, acknowledging him politely along the way.|"[""1.

On the train, Carl engaged in conversation with Lord Bedford, who had been trying to deceive him. Carl saw through Lord Bedford's schemes and confronted him, causing Lord Bedford to reveal his true intentions. Despite the awkward situation, Carl managed to salvage the encounter by inviting Mr. Atwood to join them for a drive. Mr. Atwood was thrilled to be in the company of Lord Bedford, whom he admired greatly. After a pleasant dinner, Carl had to cut short his visit to Niagara due to work commitments. He continued his journey to Chicago, where he achieved great success as a salesman. In Chicago, Carl stayed at the Sherman House and visited a store to buy shoes, where he met a friendly clerk named Gray. Gray, a young man from Indiana, was eager to accompany Carl to a high-class hotel for supper. Despite his modest salary, Gray's positive attitude and good manners made him well-liked by customers and promised a bright future.

"Dear Young Friend,

Your report is exactly what I needed, and I appreciate your advice. I have decided to decline the loan. If you happen to pass through Albany, please visit me. If not, send a letter to Milford. Carl spent a few extra days in Chicago where he met his English friend, Lord Bedford. They explored Chicago together, impressing other guests at the hotel. Carl's Chicago business was done when he unexpectedly encountered a family friend, Cyrus Robinson. Back home in Edgewood Center, his absence was felt deeply by his father, who seemed unwell. Rumors circulated that Carl's stepmother was influencing his father to change his will. Dr. Crawford, feeling uneasy, unknowingly signed a will that favored his wife, leaving Carl at her mercy.

Warm regards."|"['1. What did Carl do in Chicago?\nA) Met a family friend\nB) Explored the city with Lord Bedford\nC) Conducted business meetings\nD) Visited his father\nE) Signed a will', '2.
