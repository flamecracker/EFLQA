Jacob Farnum, the owner of the shipyard, was pleased to have sold the 'Pollard' to the Navy. He didn't mind storing the Navy's property for a while. The young shipbuilder, Jack, inherited the business from his father and was the captain of the submarine torpedo boat. Hal Hastings, the engineer, was also present. The shipyard was bustling with competition among American and foreign builders of submarine fighting craft. The 'Pollard' was the first submarine built at the yard, designed by David Pollard. Farnum mentioned naming the third boat after Jack. He joked about the Navy changing boat names if they objected. Farnum praised Jack and Hal for their success, promising to build more boats. The conversation was light-hearted, with plans for future boats named after the crew.|"[""1.

Farnum explained that in the United States Navy, a gunboat accompanies every two or three submarines, with the larger craft known as the 'parent boat' to assist any disabled submarines. The plan was for the 'Pollard' to be taken by naval crew to the Naval Academy in Annapolis for inspection and possible sale to the Government. Jack and Hal were excited to act as civilian instructors to teach the midshipmen about the Pollard boat. Farnum, Jack, and Hal then inspected the new submarine being built before realizing that the Farnum had disappeared.

Eph, feeling unlucky, grumbled about spending an hour searching for new information only to find it in a book from ten years ago. Meanwhile, Jacob Farnum, the shipbuilder, was focused on observing a steam craft to the south. After preparing the newer submarine boat, Andrews and his crew made final adjustments.

"Jack Benson rushed towards the Naval Academy, realizing he looked unkempt and out of place. Lacking money to buy new clothes, he hurried into town with a plan. As he reached Annapolis, he felt self-conscious of his appearance, with people staring at him. Determined to avoid further embarrassment, he dashed into the Maryland House hotel. Unfortunately, the clerk's disapproval led to Jack being escorted out by two porters. Despite the humiliation, Jack decided to head straight to the Academy.

Mr. Benson, a civilian instructor, will guide everyone to the cabin. He will explain how to use the diving controls, the compressed air device, and other important details usually managed from the cabin. It's important to address Mr. Benson as 'sir' like an officer. One cadet, who was older, felt embarrassed saying 'sir' to a younger cadet like Jack. Despite finding it funny, they respected the instructions. Truax suggested asking Benson tough questions to see him flustered. However, Mr. Merriam reminded them to stick to relevant questions. The cadets did well, and if they continue to perform as well during sea training, they will have a good grasp of operating the Pollard boats. The submarine boys were prepared for the next squad's arrival in the afternoon. They explained everything smoothly, ensuring the cadets addressed them with respect. Jack decided to wait a few days before taking action to catch the mulatto and his friends off guard.

A smile appeared on the faces of the group of cadet midshipmen. The person with the blanket unfolded it, and many cadets grabbed the edges, holding it out over the ground. Suddenly, Jack Benson was thrown across the blanket by his captors with some force. The cadets holding the blanket pulled it taut, sending Jack into the air a few feet. Each time he landed, they jerked the blanket harder, sending him higher. The cadets chanted a refrain, lifting Jack higher with each word. They expertly tossed him up about eight or nine feet each time. Escape was impossible as Jack was continuously thrown into the air. After Jack, Hal Hastings was also tossed up and down to the cadets' rhythmic chant. The officer reprimanded the cadets for hazing, especially since the victims were temporary civilian instructors in submarine work.|"['1.

Mr. Mayhew responded less coldly, expressing concern about Benson's repeated troubles and involvement of Mr. Hastings. Eph Somers, leaning over the rail, found humor in Jack's situation. Williamson, now able to leave his motors, joined them and listened in amazement. Despite the troubles, they believed the boys acted honestly. Eph and Williamson discussed the fear of the 'Farnum' being ordered away from the fleet due to false accusations. Doctor McCrea reported on the boys' condition, praising their physical health.

Captain Jack decided to question Truax, but Mr. Benson and Mr. Hastings were unfit to teach the cadets that day. Lieutenant Halpin would lead sections on the 'Pollard' only. The next day, Mr. Mayhew reported the commander's orders for the formation after leaving the bay. As the submarine dived, many cadets had to find their footing. Captain Jack expelled water from the compartments, and the 'Pollard' emerged. The next day, Jack asked Mr. Mayhew about questioning Truax. Truax confessed to a scheme to deceive Jack, revealing the involvement of Tip Gaynor. Truax tried to escape but was believed to have drowned, later discovered to be hiding with Gaynor in Europe.|"[""1.
