A loud cheer filled the air, but the young man paid it no mind. In moments, he reached the third-story window, passing through thick smoke, yet the flames had not reached that area. Miss Harrow gasped, paralyzed by fear, clinging tightly to the window sill. With determination, Tom balanced on the ladder, extending his hand to grab the teacher under her arm. As the smoke cleared, Tom had hoisted the teacher from the window sill over his shoulder, her limp form indicating she had fainted. Slowly descending the ladder with his burden, Tom was guided by another teacher to a bench on the campus where Miss Harrow was made comfortable. The fire was eventually extinguished, and the damage was minimal. Tom later expressed his intentions to marry Miss Laning and voiced his disapproval of how Miss Harrow had treated her.|['1.

Dick and Tom were brainstorming about how to recover the stolen bonds without any leads. Tom suggested finding the mysterious man spotted by Kittie Donovan, but Dick doubted its feasibility.

Andy Royce recounted his departure from the seminary to the boys, stating his knowledge of the impending trouble with Miss Harrow.

Tom handed over two five-dollar bills to the man. He explained that he wanted the man to stay for two reasons: to be available if needed by the seminary authorities and to confront Miss Harrow about her judgment of Royce. Tom believed Royce could improve if he stayed away from drinking. After the former gardener left, Tom and Sam wrote letters to Nellie and Grace. Tom decided to send a telegram to Nellie to ease her worries. The next day, Tom focused on financial matters with Dick, while Sam helped as much as he could.

"""I apologize, but you understand how some land company representatives can be,"" he replied. ""This payment is necessary to clear the land. If it remains uncleared, the company can sell your father's share to others. He has already paid fifteen thousand dollars. What the share would fetch if sold to someone else, I cannot say."" This news hit the two young men hard. Since losing sixty-four thousand dollars in bonds, they had been struggling to meet various obligations. Dick had exhausted nearly all resources except borrowing without collateral, which he hesitated to do. ""Perhaps he could. But that's not the issue, Tom. We want to be self-reliant. It's unfair to ask for money without offering proper security."" ""We should write to Uncle Randolph to discreetly inquire about the land company matter from father,"" Dick suggested. ""There might be a solution, though I'm not very hopeful."" The next day, Tom and Sam were surprised to find Nellie and Grace at the hotel.

Despite receiving assurance about a legitimate investment, he was preoccupied with the matter. Sorting through his mail, he found a mysterious letter.

"The train carrying the three Rover boys from New York to Philadelphia was rolling into the big, smoky station. It was about two o'clock in the afternoon, and the youths had dined on the train while making the journey. They had left the offices in charge of Bob Marsh, stating that they would most likely be away for the rest of the day. At first Dick and Tom had thought to leave Sam behind, but the latter had insisted on going along. It had been a two hours' run to the Quaker City.

""I guess I had better go in alone,"" suggested Dick. ""If I need you I'll whistle or wave my handkerchief;"" and then he ran up the front steps and rang the bell. A tall, angular woman, wearing large spectacles, soon answered his summons.

""We won't be held up--not if I show this,"" said the detective, and exhibited the badge pinned to his vest. Then Dick and Mr. Bronson jumped into the taxicab, and away the turnout went at top speed back to the heart of the city.

""As I said I would, I got into communication with one of our men out West, and he went after that Barton Pelter. He got him in Dayton, and made him confess that he had sent that note to you.
