Mrs. Bobbsey informed Freddie and Bert that Flossie and Nan were at Mrs. Black's house, so the boys decided to head out without them. Mrs. Bobbsey preferred the girls not be out in the hot sun, as they had a long train journey the next day. Riding in the automobile with their father along the shady lake shores, the boys bounced on the cushions as the car hit bumps. Mr. Bobbsey had to warn the girls not to stand up in the rowboat as it's dangerous. He rowed out to them as they drifted in the boat without oars. The girls were grateful for the rescue, and Mrs. Mason thanked Mr. Bobbsey for saving them. She advised the girls not to go on the lake without supervision. Mrs. Mason showed a shortcut through an orchard to reach the lumber office, and the group continued their journey after saying goodbye to the girls.|"['1.

"""It's crucial to be cautious around boats,"" Mr. Bobbsey advised the young boy as they arrived at Mr. Mason's lumber yard by the lake.

Bert's father explained that the man who gave him the Confederate bill might have done so by mistake, as some people keep old Southern bills as souvenirs. Mr. Mason, feeling the loss of his money, planned to recover it from Frank Kennedy. However, Mr. Bobbsey doubted if Frank would return, feeling sorry for the boy and wondering where he would sleep.

Bert and Snap were on an adventure on the train, but there was no danger as the cars were connected like one big coach. Snap was happy to see Bert and got to run around when the train stopped.

"""We need to rescue Snap from the baggage car before the train leaves,"" Mr. Bobbsey exclaimed. He rushed to free Snap while Uncle Daniel assisted the family into the comfortable wagon from the Bobbsey farm. ""Watch out for Snap, he loves to play rough,"" Uncle Daniel warned. As they approached the Bobbsey country home, Bert spotted his friend Tom Mason. The wagon pulled up the driveway lined with boxwood hedges and fragrant flowers. Snap and Snoop were eager to explore. Suddenly, a man arrived breathlessly, warning of a situation with the ram. Uncle Daniel instructed the children to go inside for safety. The ram, known as Upsetter, was causing trouble. Uncle Daniel explained how Upsetter's behavior changed as he grew older, causing chaos whenever he escaped. The men headed to handle the ram while the children stayed indoors."|"['1.

Before the farmhand returned, the ram dashed towards the barn through the driveway. As Uncle Daniel predicted, the ram was making its way to the house, possibly recalling it as a pleasant spot from its days as a young lamb. However, now the ram was large, strong, and not very friendly. After a brief pause, the ram pawed the ground, lowered its head with its imposing horns, and advanced again. The farmer anticipated this behavior and placed salt on the ground to lure the ram, as sheep and cattle are drawn to salt for their health. The ram, upon finding the salt, calmed down and began licking it. Bert and Harry observed the captured ram, now appearing less hostile. The tired Bobbsey family retired early that evening after a long journey. The next morning, Harry and Bert watched men pick apples from trees using ladders and bags to prevent bruising. Uncle Daniel advised the boys to pick apples from low branches to avoid damaging them. Nan visited a friend, while Flossie and Freddie amused themselves on the farm, later joining the apple picking in the orchard.|"['1.

"Harry explained to Freddie, affectionately calling him ""little fat fireman,"" that the fallen apples were called 'windfalls.' These apples get knocked down by the wind and end up crushed and bruised on the hard ground, making them unsuitable to mix with the carefully hand-picked ones. Meanwhile, Snoop and Snap, the pets, enjoyed life in the countryside, with Snoop befriending another cat and Snap finding playmates among the dogs in the meadow. The adults, Mrs. Bobbsey and Aunt Sarah, engaged in discussions while the kitchen was bustling with activity as Dinah and Martha prepared delicious meals. The children, including the Bobbsey twins, cousin Harry, and some local kids, embarked on a cheerful woodland picnic. Mr. Bobbsey advised them to wait before drinking cold beverages to avoid falling ill. After a meal of sandwiches, cake, and lemonade, the group relaxed under the trees while Bert and Harry tried their luck at fishing, with Bert catching a good-sized fish.
