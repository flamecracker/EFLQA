Tom pondered about the identities of the Secret Service men and spies around him. He couldn't shake off the unsettling thought of being suspected as a spy himself.

Tom found himself standing waist-deep at the conning tower of a German submarine, feeling drenched and astonished. As he was led through the submarine, he passed by electrical apparatus and periscopes, and even saw a parrot in a cage. Inside a tiny compartment that seemed like the commander's private space, he was met by a young man in a dark blue jumper. The atmosphere was hot and oily, but spotlessly clean. Tom felt like he was in a strange world, akin to the tales from the Arabian Nights. Despite the impoliteness of the Germans, Tom tried to gather his courage and not be afraid. The experience inside the submarine was surreal, with compartments resembling a camping outfit and a sleeping-car. Tom could only imagine what lay beyond the different doors and compartments of the U-boat.|"['1.

Tom was taken by a German officer to a room where he was questioned. Despite the officer's efforts, Tom refused to reveal any information. Later, he was given food and a bunk to rest. When he awoke, soldiers led him to the deck where he saw many U-boats. He was then escorted to a stone building, closely watched by soldiers. Inside, he found men in sailor suits and oilskins seated around. The room was guarded by crippled soldiers.

Tom was surprised to hear English spoken, and it sounded comforting to him. The sailor, unfazed by the grim surroundings, put Tom at ease. British sailors and soldiers are known for taking things in stride. The sailor shared his experience of being captured by a German destroyer while inspecting mines. Tom admired the sailor's good-natured attitude and thought being an English soldier must be more enjoyable. Tom found himself in a German prison camp, feeling frustrated about not being able to fight in the war. Despite feeling rebellious, he clutched a small iron button given to him by a friend, determined to face his fate.

Throughout their journey in the boxcar, Tom caught only fleeting glimpses of Germany through the sliding door at stations where more prisoners were ushered in. Uncertain of the fate of the British trawler men, he found solace in the company of his jack-tar comrades, whom he knew as Freddie and Tennert. Despite the war's gravity, their conversations lacked patriotic fervor, viewing their duties as a mere job. Tom, a scout, pondered escape, guided by the Britishers' counsel that evading captors was his prerogative. Determined to join the American forces, he resolved to redouble his efforts, drawing strength from his scout training and the valor of his companions.

In the afternoon, friendly conversations were interrupted by the arrival of military prisoners in a crowded boxcar. These soldiers, British and Belgian, were captured after a German raid near Flanders. Despite their situation, the British captives, like Tennert and Freddie, remained cheerful and chatted about the war as if it were a cricket game. Tom, a non-combatant, observed the soldiers' resilience. Eventually, they arrived at their supposed destination, Slopsgotten, which turned out to be a misnomer. Tom found the name amusing and felt disappointed when he learned the actual name was Schlaabgaurtn. As they gazed at the distant battle line, Tom pondered the soldiers' experiences and the challenges of crossing into France.

The unfortunate captives were thoroughly checked and stripped of their belongings before being escorted to a nearby camp, referred to as a civilian camp but serving a broader purpose. They walked through the streets of the quaint town in a somber procession, observed by silent onlookers. Tom, feeling compassion rather than self-pity, noticed the many disabled individuals among the crowd. The camp was oval-shaped, enclosed by a high barbed wire fence, lacking electricity due to coal shortages. The former stables were transformed into living spaces, with makeshift shacks constructed from scavenged materials. Monotony and squalor defined daily life, with straw bedding and meager food. Visits from the Spanish Embassy often irked the camp's stern German commandant. Prisoners received packages from home, fostering camaraderie. Tom adapted to the camp's informal structure, engaging in conversations about various war experiences while embracing the camp’s laid-back atmosphere.|"['1.

Archer had an eventful journey that could fill a book. He was finishing an apple when a torpedo hit the ship. He regretted not throwing the core faster. He jumped for a lifeboat, missed, swam to another, drifted to Ireland, then London. He got a job on a troop-carrying steamer, teased troops, collected souvenirs, and ended up in France. He wriggled into military service, rode a motorcycle, and was caught by Germans while mimicking Charlie Chaplin. Archer spoke of generals humorously and had a unique French accent. He joked about engine issues, suggesting ways to fix it. Tom, impressed, spread the word, making Archer a hero in the camp. Archer's lively storytelling made him popular, and he initiated efforts to repair the old pump.|['1.

A long petition circulated among the group, requesting General von Griffenhaus to either remove the engine's cylinder head or lend Tom Slade a wrench for the task. The prisoners, including Tom and Archer, showed little interest in the matter. Archer was seen as a troublemaker, while Tom, new and quiet, remained a mystery.

Tom explained to Archer that he felt compelled to fight in the war for both of them. He believed that escaping was not an option because he had already made up his mind to take the risk. Tom then discussed a plan involving corroding a wire to break free, but he wanted to ensure Archer was fully aware of the risks before involving him. Despite the lack of a file to aid in their escape, Tom and Archer were determined to find a way out. Archer, being game and eager, was fully on board with the plan.

It was crucial to be vigilant of the guard outside, which required teamwork. Archer engaged the sentry near the provision gate, distracting him with his charming talk. Meanwhile, Tom carefully examined the wire fencing under the bushes, identifying seven weak points to pass through.
