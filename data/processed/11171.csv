Uncle Tom was feeling sadder than ever. He had hoped for a clean and tidy room, but he had to share a crowded space with five or six others. Each morning, they were driven to work in the fields like cattle under the harsh sun. Legree and his cruel slaves, Quimbo and Sambo, watched over them with whips. At night, they returned to miserable huts. Meanwhile, Tom Loker was recovering at a Quaker farmhouse, tended to by a kind old lady. Despite his discomfort, he revealed a plan to help Eliza escape.

Miss Ophelia's letter to Mrs. Shelby, informing her of Tom's impending sale, was delayed in the mail. When it finally arrived, Mr. Shelby was gravely ill, leaving Mrs. Shelby unable to act. Sadly, Mr. Shelby passed away, but Mrs. Shelby remained true to her promise to Aunt Chloe and Tom. She sold land to fund George Shelby's mission to repurchase Tom. Legree, the cruel overseer, expressed anger towards Tom, calling him rebellious. Despite the abuse, Tom's last wish was for George to convey his love to his family. George buried Tom under a sandy knoll beyond Legree's farm. Though unmarked, Tom's grave is a testament to his enduring spirit.|"[""1.
