In a cozy white house surrounded by fragrant honeysuckle, a little garden bloomed with vibrant flowers. The head of Sweetclover wore a purple morning-glory as a dress, cleverly fashioned to resemble a bonnet. Peggs crafted a soldier's uniform from newspaper, adorning it with cornsilk plumes and golden leaf medals. Jackie dreamed of Kernel Cob becoming a brave general or an adventurous admiral. The flowers, Kernel Cob and Sweetclover, conversed softly, their whispers unheard by Jackie and Peggs. Flowers communicate in a language unknown to people, their gentle swaying and nodding revealing their secret conversations. A sudden wind swept Kernel Cob and Sweetclover away, leaving Jackie and Peggs in tears. They soared through the sky and landed on the Moon, where they were greeted by silver-clad Moonpeople. Kernel Cob's leadership impressed the Moon King, who appointed him as the head of his armies. Sweetclover admired the exquisite Silverfloss flowers, whispering to them in awe.|"[""1.

For many days, they sailed on a ship until they reached land. Men came to unload the vessel, and their crate of oranges was carried onto the dock and placed on a wagon. They were driven off, unaware of their location. Peering out from the crate, they heard unfamiliar talk. Kernel Cob, bravest of them, peeked out and compared the surroundings to a house made of cards. A little girl approached, lifting Sweetclover. A sailor named Jackie Tar greeted them, happy to hear American language. He informed them about the Japanese residents. Jackie Tar offered to help them escape using a kite. They agreed and moved the kite to the center of the room. As they attempted to escape, they were captured by the Toy-maker.
