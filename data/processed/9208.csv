Guilt is like a stain on the soul, a question of whether the soul can be tainted by deeds only thought of but never acted upon. Must evil thoughts be manifested physically to be considered sinful? While earthly courts judge only actions, can guilty thoughts alone condemn a person in the eternal court? Imagine Mr. Smith, a virtuous man, drinking wine alone when he is visited by three figures: Fancy as a showman, Memory as a clerk, and Conscience shrouded in darkness. They show Mr. Smith haunting images, like a moonlit scene of a man triumphing over a kneeling woman. As Mr. Smith recognizes the figures, he is shocked. Memory reveals his past thoughts, and Conscience pierces him with guilt. The story teaches us the power of our thoughts and the weight of our conscience.|"['1.

The show continued. Fancy unveiled her artworks one by one, each seemingly crafted to upset Mr. Smith. Not a shred of evidence could prove him guilty of the sins depicted.
