He continued his journey at a slow pace, passing by Fairview and Ion, carefully observing his surroundings. After circling several miles, he returned to the town he had left earlier. At the village inn, he handed his horse to the caretaker and joined a group discussing politics. Later, he casually checked on his horse at the stable, noting its exact position. Around ten o'clock that night, he quietly left again, saddled his horse in the dark, and rode off cautiously. He avoided confrontation by diverting off the road into the woods, changing into a disguise. During a secret meeting of the group, he narrowly escaped being recognized. After ensuring his horse was returned to its place, he retired to his room for a well-deserved rest.

The invaders, following their usual routine, dismounted at the gate, leaving their horses with two of their group, and proceeded on foot towards the house. They advanced in a line of three, but as they approached, one group veered off towards the kitchen. As the troop, led by their captain, reached the veranda steps, they halted abruptly, surprised by the barricade hidden by darkness and vines.

The doctor had completed his work and was now asleep on the floor. The other raiders, who were unharmed, had also fallen asleep, leaving the room in darkness and silence except for the sounds of suffering. Boyd, unable to sleep due to his severe burns, especially in his eyes, feared he would go blind. The thought of living in darkness was unbearable, and he even considered ending his own life. Despite his disbelief in the Bible, teachings from his mother haunted him, making him question his choices. Alone and in pain, he longed for his aunt's comforting presence, but feared her judgment if she knew of his crimes. With troops in the area and the fear of being discovered, Boyd's distress grew.

The harmful effects of tobacco and alcohol on the body are significant. Tobacco weakens the heart and can lead to sudden deaths, as observed in a town where many deaths were linked to tobacco use. Alcohol can cause intense thirst that water cannot satisfy, leading to the consumption of even more alcoholic drinks. In one study, a majority of convicts had committed crimes under the influence of alcohol, with many citing tobacco as a gateway to drinking. It is essential to remember that our bodies are sacred, as they are temples of the Holy Ghost. We must care for our bodies and avoid self-indulgence that can harm our physical and mental well-being. It is crucial to make wise choices to honor our bodies and spirits as gifts from God.|['1.

There were cradles to rock the babies in, and coaches for them to ride in; there were dinner and tea-sets of the finest china and of solid silver; indeed almost everything in the shape of toys that the childish heart could desire.
