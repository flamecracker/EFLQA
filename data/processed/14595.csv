"Tom Somers descended from the bank after securing a good spot, having done more than planned. He watched the spirited horse rush wildly towards its demise. The horse's run was brief; it overturned the chaise and got entangled, unable to rise until helped by a stout man. Tom, witnessing the incident, philosophically thought, ""I wish that chaise had been the southern confederacy."" The town of Pinchbrook, near Boston, is not easily found on maps. It is a town of around three thousand residents, mainly engaged in farming, manufacturing, commerce, and fishing. The Somers family lived in a cottage close to Pinchbrook Harbor.

Squire Pemberton's mansion was an old-style house, set back about a hundred feet from the road. In front, there was a lush green lawn with large buttonwood trees. The front yard was open without a fence, where a crowd had gathered. The boys were curious about the exciting conversation happening in the squire's living room at the back of the house.

When the group of three, chosen by the upset loyalists of Pinchbrook, finished their task at the squire's home, they sensibly decided to depart. They made their intentions known through their spokesperson to the unwilling host. After putting on their hats and heading towards the front entry, the embarrassed traitor followed them. Just as they exited the room, a loud crash echoed, alarming those left in the room. Mrs. Pemberton, hearing the noise, feared the worst, thinking the angry mob had begun to destroy the house. However, the house remained intact, and the committee's success was celebrated with cheers. Meanwhile, the squire, frustrated, cursed and attempted to repair the broken door. Mrs. Pemberton, worried about a potential fire, urged him to investigate the noise in the cellar. The squire, relieved to find no fire, proceeded to inspect the cellar with a lantern.

The landowner stepped back, quite scared by the motionless body before him. He felt as if a severe punishment had befallen someone who had been killed while trying to harm his property. With his lantern in hand, he hurried back up the cellar stairs, his speech frozen, and his knees trembling in fear. Though we are unsure of what he feared, it seemed like an instinctive dread of death had overwhelmed him. Yet, there was truly nothing to fear, as a deceased person is less likely to cause harm than a living one. After a while, the landowner regained some composure, especially in front of his family. Mrs. Pemberton took the lantern and approached the young intruder lying on the ground. The landowner, still agitated and afraid, examined the intruder's face.

When the pole fell, it made a loud noise, causing the young man to hurry down the stairs. As he descended, the door to the squire's room opened, and Tom found himself flanked from both sides. A figure in white appeared at the other end of the entry, but Tom dismissed the idea of it being a ghost. Miss Susan, with a romantic scream, confirmed her presence. Tom noticed a light below, indicating Mrs. Pemberton's assistance, making escape seem imminent. He quickly opened a window onto the portico roof, where he climbed down. However, a fierce dog chained in the barn confronted him. Despite coaxing failing, Tom used a heavy stake to keep the dog at bay until the squire intervened with a lantern.

Upon reaching the road, Thomas put on his boots, retrieved after the encounter with his dog, Tige.

He recounted his adventures to his family and eventually fell asleep, exhausted. The next morning, he arrived late at work due to the previous night's events, which were accepted as a valid excuse.

"Tom cautiously rose from his lying position and grabbed the musket. Carefully, he tiptoed over the slumbering soldiers, but one of his shoes squeaked, alerting the guard. ""Who's there!"" Tom called out mockingly. ""You just woke up? Where were you five minutes ago when I passed by? There won't be any prisoners left by morning. The long roll wouldn't even wake you all up."" Following his companion's advice, the guard didn't object to Tom leaving. Tom walked away calmly, as if he had just been relieved from duty. He soon stumbled upon a regiment's camp, prompting him to avoid it by jumping a fence into a field. Despite maintaining composure, the nerve-wracking experience drained him. After discarding the musket to avoid detection, he wandered aimlessly, unsure if he was heading towards Richmond or Washington. Tom eventually reached a railroad, faced with the dilemma of choosing the right direction without a clear sense of north or south. Sitting down in contemplation, he resorted to flipping his cap to decide his path, relieving him from the burden of uncertainty."|"['1.

Tom cautiously continued his journey, keeping a keen eye out for any signs of the rebels' main camp near Manassas Junction. Despite his initial confidence, he found no camp along the way, which left him feeling uncertain. As he walked along the railroad, expecting to see Fairfax station or rebel camps, the landscape grew unfamiliar and rugged. Tom used the position of the rising sun to orient himself, realizing he was moving westward. Hungry and tired, he stumbled upon a small village but decided not to pass through it in his United States army uniform. Instead, he sought food, acknowledging the pressing need to address his hunger as a critical problem to solve.|"[""1.

Tom visited a humble house in Pinchbrook Harbor, seeking food. The dwelling was simple, made of rough boards with a large stone chimney. Inside, there was a single room with a bed and a fireplace. The family was outside in the garden. The man was digging while his wife and two children watched. The woman served Tom a meal of hoe cake and a stew, which he enjoyed. Despite his offer to pay, the woman refused, showing true southern hospitality. Instead, Tom bought a loaf of bread for six cents. The family observed Tom with amazement as he ate heartily.

As he was about to open the door, a sudden knock startled him. Peeking out of the window, he saw an officer and two soldiers. Panicked, he rushed to the back door. Meanwhile, the woman headed to the front door, and Tom tried to slip into the garden but spotted a soldier. With no escape, he decided to hide in the chimney. The officer refused to leave without the woman's husband. Tom feared being trapped in the chimney all day. He watched as the officer and a soldier left for the woods. As the woman's husband approached, Tom felt conflicted. Wanting to help the family, he tried to signal the man discreetly. But the man didn't notice, and Tom realized he might be stuck in the chimney until nightfall.|"[""1.

Tom, a young boy, cautiously approached the house. He worried that the soldier inside might hear him, so he softly whistled. When his whistle went unnoticed, he tried again, but still no response. Tom then spoke quietly, careful not to be heard inside. Suddenly, the soldier headed towards the front door. Tom peeked over the chimney to see what was happening. The soldier, armed, was now close to the chimney. Mrs. Burnap, distressed, pleaded with the soldier, but he was unmoved. Joe, who was being confronted, started to retreat. The soldier threatened to shoot if Joe didn't return.

Tom hurled a stone down upon the rebel, injuring his arm. Despite the less than expected outcome, Tom seized the soldier's musket. With Joe Burnap as a guide, they hurried towards the mountains. Tom, unfamiliar with the area, pondered his next move. Burnap's indifference to the war dismayed Tom, who resolved to part ways when possible. Lacking a map, Tom relied on his faint geography knowledge to navigate towards Washington. They dined and walked until Tom collapsed in exhaustion.

The young soldier found himself alone in the dark, searching for his companion Joe. He suspected Joe had found a spot to sleep nearby. After calling out to no avail, he realized Joe might have already left for the Gap. Unsure of the direction, he followed the crowing of a rooster to a road, leading him to a house. Avoiding new acquaintances, he continued until he reached the Gap. Spotting a battery of artillery and rebel infantry, he retreated to the woods. After a meager breakfast, he napped till midday. As darkness fell, he braved the Gap, armed with a revolver. Challenged by a sentinel, he passed through, reflecting on the deception he had used. Walking through the night, he covered twenty-five miles, heading towards Manassas Gap.|"['1.

In the rugged mountain area, Tom found a quiet spot where he felt safe from disturbance. The region was teeming with soldiers, adding to his anxiety. The Virginia mountaineers were joining the rebellion, causing chaos with their rowdy behavior. Tom managed to avoid encounters with these unruly groups, but he remained on edge, fearing he might stumble upon a camp or soldiers at any moment. He settled in a hidden nook among the rocks, concealed by tree branches, to rest. After waking up, he cautiously listened for any signs of danger, finding only silence. He rested again, knowing the importance of being well-rested for his mission. Refreshed after his nap, he continued his journey, deciding to leave the railroad for a safer route.

Tom's heart was heavy as he sat in the boat, reflecting on the events of the morning. He thanked God for his escape, realizing the thin line between life and death. The face of the rebel who shot at him lingered in his thoughts, haunting him even in solitude. As he listened to the water's mournful ripples, he was startled by a sentinel on the shore, this time wearing the blue uniform of the U.S. army.

In a letter from John, he learned that Captain Barney had lent the money to pay the interest on the note, and Squire Pemberton hadn't mentioned foreclosing the mortgage. His brother wanted to join the navy, even if he had to leave secretly. He could earn good wages and felt it was a shame not to help the family. Tom finished writing his letters, happy that his family was well. Soon, they would receive a letter from him confirming his safe return to the regiment. Hapgood asked if all was well, noticing Tom's content expression. Tom then shared his adventures modestly, captivating his audience. The regiment had a period of inactivity after the Bull Run battle, assigned to watch rebel movements near Budd's Ferry on the Potomac. The soldiers picketed the river to deter enemy approaches. The boys found life at Budd's Ferry uneventful, with rebel batteries causing occasional noise. Tom remained philosophical as the weather turned colder, adapting to military life. One December night, on picket duty near Chickamoxon Creek, Tom spotted a small boat approaching, likely carrying supplies for rebels. Despite the stormy night, the boat aimed to evade Union pickets along the river.|"['1.

Tom and Hapgood quickly discussed a plan. Tom took the front of the boat, while the others handled the oars. They headed to the middle of the creek to intercept the schooner. The soldiers on the schooner noticed them and tried to avoid the boat. Tom signaled his companions to row closer. They reached the schooner, but the rebel crew hesitated, unsure of their intentions. The night was dark, and Tom's strategy seemed to confuse the rebels. With some luck and the rebels' mistakes, Tom and his friends managed to get on the schooner. Fred accidentally let the boat drift away, leaving them no escape route. They were forced to fight. The rebels fired at them, and a brief struggle ensued. Tom took control of the schooner, steering it towards safety. Despite the darkness and confusion, Tom spotted a familiar landmark, Mrs. Budd's house, near a Union battery.|"['1.

Fortunately, the Confederates hesitated more than the Unionists, possibly anticipating a larger enemy force. They decided to abort the pursuit and returned to their positions. The deserter was missing for a while, and Tom assumed he had lost his way in the woods or missed the path taken by the Federal scouts. The group stopped, and after a brief wait, the rebel deserter appeared. He seemed around fifty and looked incredibly unkempt and wretched. His torn gray uniform was caked in mud, and his appearance was comically pitiful. The soldiers burst into laughter at his bizarre outfit. The deserter, noticing the amusement, acknowledged his ragged appearance. He revealed he had joined the rebel army to escape the country but never harmed a Union soldier.

After the battle, Tom was found wounded on the ground. The old veteran, Hapgood, and his friends took care of him. Tom had been hit by a bullet near his left temple during the battle. The wound was not as severe as initially thought, but Tom was completely exhausted from the march and the fight. He was taken to a hospital in Williamsburg for treatment. Despite a lack of sleep and the strain of battle, Tom's condition improved after a long rest. When he woke up, he wanted to rejoin his regiment, but he realized he was too weak to carry his gear. With the surgeon's approval, Tom set out to find his regiment, feeling weak but determined to reunite with his comrades.|"[""1.

"""No, he's badly hurt, but the surgeon thinks he will recover. The captain was slightly wounded."" And Hapgood listed the names of those in the group who had been killed or wounded, or were missing. ""So would I; and between us, Tom, you didn't come very far from losing your number in the mess,"" said the veteran, poking his little fingers into a bullet hole in Tom's coat. ""That was a close shave."" ""I felt that one, but I hadn't time to think about it then, for it was just as we were repelling that flank movement,"" replied Tom, unbuttoning his coat and reaching into his breast pocket. ""Do you suppose she will give me another?"" he asked, pulling out the envelope containing the letter and the photograph of the author of his socks. A minie ball had pierced the envelope, tearing through the picture, cutting away the chin and throat of the young lady. The letter was torn and shredded beyond repair. Tom discovered the damage when he woke up in the hospital, for his last thought at night and his first in the morning had been the beautiful Lilian Ashford. He was saddened when he first saw the ruin; but when he considered what a great proof this would be of his conduct on the battlefield, he was pleased with the notion; and while he thanked the rebel marksman in his heart for not hitting closer to the vital organ beneath the envelope, he was grateful for the splendid evidence"|"[""1.
