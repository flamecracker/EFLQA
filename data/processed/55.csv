Dorothy lived with her Uncle Henry and Aunt Em on the vast Kansas prairies. Their small house had only one room with basic furniture like a cookstove, a cupboard, a table, chairs, and beds. The prairie stretched endlessly in all directions, with no trees or houses in sight. The scorching sun had turned the land gray, even the grass. Aunt Em's youthful beauty had faded, and Uncle Henry, a solemn man, worked tirelessly. Dorothy, an orphan, found joy in her little black dog, Toto. One day, as a storm approached, Uncle Henry and Dorothy noticed the grass bending in the wind. Aunt Em, scared, sought shelter in the cyclone cellar. Dorothy tried to follow but was knocked down as the wind howled and the house trembled.|"[""1.

In the center of a cyclone, Dorothy found herself in a house lifted high by the strong winds. Despite the darkness and howling wind, she felt oddly calm, like being rocked gently.

"Dorothy was amazed as she listened to the speech of the little woman. She couldn't understand why she was being called a sorceress and accused of killing the Wicked Witch of the East. Dorothy was just a harmless girl who had been carried far from home by a cyclone and had never harmed anyone in her life.

The little old woman explained that although Dorothy hadn't killed the witch directly, her house had, which was just as significant. The woman revealed herself as the Witch of the North and explained that the Wicked Witch of the East had held the Munchkins captive for years, and now they were free thanks to Dorothy.

The Witch of the North clarified that not all witches were wicked, and in the Land of Oz, there were only four witches. She mentioned that the Wicked Witch of the West was the only remaining evil witch in the land.

Dorothy was intrigued and wanted to ask more questions, but the Munchkins interrupted, pointing out the remains of the Wicked Witch of the East. The Witch of the North then gifted Dorothy the silver shoes that belonged to the deceased witch.

It was revealed that in the Land of Oz, witches and wizards still existed because the land was isolated from the civilized world. Dorothy learned about the Wicked Witch of the West ruling over the Winkies and how dangerous her territory was."|"[""1.

Dorothy cried feeling alone among the unfamiliar faces. Her tears moved the sympathetic Munchkins, who wept with her. The elderly woman performed a magical act with her cap, turning it into a slate that revealed directions to the City of Emeralds. The Witch advised Dorothy to seek help from Oz and bid her farewell. After the Munchkins wished her a safe journey, the Witch vanished. Dorothy, feeling hungry, gathered food and dressed in her gingham frock. She set off on the yellow brick road toward the Emerald City, marveling at the beauty of the land and the kindness of the Munchkins. As evening approached, she stumbled upon a lively house with dancing and a feast, where she could rest for the night.|"['1.

Dorothy was warmly welcomed by the Munchkins, who invited her to stay the night and share a celebratory supper. Despite their kindness, Dorothy felt out of place as they mistook her for a witch. The next morning, after a restful sleep, she continued her journey to the Emerald City. Along the way, she encountered a Scarecrow in a cornfield who could talk and even wink. The Scarecrow confided in Dorothy, sharing his desire for a brain to gain knowledge. As they traveled together, the Scarecrow revealed his only fear - a secret he kept close.

After a few hours, the path became rough, and the Scarecrow often tripped over the uneven yellow bricks. Sometimes they were broken or missing, forcing Toto to jump over them and Dorothy to walk around. The Scarecrow, lacking brains, continued straight ahead, falling into holes but unharmed. Dorothy would laugh and help him up. The Scarecrow, unable to eat due to a painted mouth, shared his story with Dorothy about being made just a day before.

The Scarecrow felt disheartened when the crows realized he was not a real threat. The old crow consoled him, emphasizing the value of brains. Determined to gain intelligence, the Scarecrow hoped to receive brains from the Great Oz in the Emerald City. As they journeyed, the travelers encountered a dense forest with towering trees that blocked the sunlight. Despite the darkness, they pressed on, relying on Toto's keen eyesight and the Scarecrow's ability to see in the dark. They eventually found refuge in a cozy cottage where Dorothy rested while the Scarecrow stood watchfully. The next morning, they continued their journey, discovering a tin man in need of oil to move his rusted joints.|"[""1.

The Tin Woodman requested his neck be oiled first, and the Scarecrow helped move his rusted head. Feeling relieved, the Woodman asked for his legs to be oiled next. As they journeyed down the yellow brick road, they encountered a dense forest. The Woodman used his axe to clear a path, proving to be a valuable addition to the group. He shared his story of how he lost his body parts due to the Wicked Witch's curse, leaving him made entirely of tin. Despite his hardships, the Woodman remained determined and joined Dorothy and the Scarecrow on their adventure.|"['1.

In the bright sun, the Tin Woodman felt proud of his shiny body, not fearing his axe slipping. His only worry was rusting joints. Forgetting to oil himself, caught in a rainstorm, his joints rusted, leaving him stuck until help arrived. He longed for a heart to love again. Dorothy, puzzled by her friends' desires, focused on reaching Kansas with scarce food left. As they walked, the road, once paved with yellow brick, was now covered in debris. They heard growls of hidden animals, making Dorothy anxious. Suddenly, a Lion attacked, but Dorothy bravely defended Toto, surprising the Lion. The Lion, despite being the King of Beasts, confessed to being a coward, scaring others with roars. His heart raced in danger, revealing his sorrow.|"[""1.

Once more, the group embarked on their journey, with the Lion striding gracefully beside Dorothy. Initially, Toto was wary of the Lion due to a past incident, but eventually, they became good friends. The rest of the day was peaceful until the Tin Woodman accidentally stepped on a beetle, causing him great sorrow. His tears rusted his jaw shut, but the Scarecrow saved the day with oil from Dorothy’s basket. The group camped under a tree, and Dorothy built a fire. The Lion offered to hunt a deer for breakfast, but he found his own meal. The Scarecrow gathered nuts for Dorothy, filling her basket. The day took a turn when they encountered a wide, deep ditch, seemingly blocking their path.|"['1.

The Scarecrow agreed to help the group cross the gulf, ensuring the safety of Dorothy and the Tin Woodman. The Lion fearlessly leaped over the ditch, impressing everyone. Dorothy, carrying Toto, rode on the Lion's back, crossing effortlessly. The Lion then carried the Tin Woodman across. The group paused to rest, hearing eerie noises from the dark forest where the dangerous Kalidahs lived. Despite his fear, the Lion bravely faced the Kalidahs, roaring loudly. As the beasts approached, the Scarecrow had a quick idea. He instructed the Woodman to chop the tree bridge, causing the Kalidahs to fall to their demise. The relieved Lion expressed gratitude for surviving the encounter. Eager to leave the forest, the group quickened their pace and soon reached a beautiful river, beyond which lay a picturesque landscape with a yellow brick road and lush surroundings.

The Woodman started crafting a raft by chopping small trees, while the Scarecrow discovered a tree full of delicious fruit. Dorothy, tired of nuts, relished a meal of ripe fruit. As night fell, the raft was unfinished, so they slept under the trees. The next morning, they had a hopeful breakfast of peaches and plums. The raft was almost ready, and they set off, with Dorothy holding Toto and the Scarecrow and Woodman pushing the raft with long poles. However, the swift river current carried them away from the yellow brick road. The Scarecrow got stuck in the river, but with teamwork, they managed to reach the shore. A Stork helped rescue the Scarecrow, reuniting the group. They continued their journey, hopeful to reach the Emerald City with the Stork's well wishes.|['1.

They strolled, hearing the birds' tunes and admiring the vibrant flowers carpeting the ground. Among the yellow, white, blue, and purple blossoms were clusters of scarlet poppies, dazzling Dorothy. The meadow transformed into a sea of poppies, known for their sleep-inducing scent. Overwhelmed by the red blooms, Dorothy succumbed to slumber. The Scarecrow urged haste to avoid the flowers' spell. Carrying Dorothy, they navigated the deadly bed. The Lion succumbed too, but the group reached safety by the river. A yellow Wildcat approached, chasing a field mouse. The Tin Woodman intervened, saving the mouse. The mice, grateful, offered help. They constructed a truck to rescue the sleeping Lion from the poppy bed.

The Scarecrow and the Woodman started tying the mice to the truck using strings. Each mouse had a string around its neck connected to the truck. Despite the size difference, the mice effortlessly pulled the truck with the help of the Scarecrow and the Woodman. They transported the Lion, who had fallen asleep among poppies, to safety. The Queen urged them to move quickly to prevent the mice from falling asleep too. With effort, they moved the Lion out of the poppies. The refreshed Lion expressed gratitude for the small creatures saving his life. They continued their journey to the Emerald City, leaving behind the dangers of the forest.

Dorothy and her companions continued their journey towards the Emerald City. As they approached the great green wall surrounding the City, they saw a magnificent gate adorned with sparkling emeralds. Dorothy pressed a button beside the gate, which opened slowly, revealing a high arched room filled with dazzling emeralds. Inside stood a small green man, the Guardian of the Gates, who warned them of the power and wisdom of the Great Wizard, Oz. He explained that anyone seeking an audience with Oz must wear special green spectacles to protect their eyes from the city's brilliance. The Guardian provided Dorothy with a pair of these spectacles, ensuring she was prepared to meet the Great Wizard.

The Gatekeeper, wearing special glasses, guided Dorothy and her friends through the dazzling Emerald City. The streets sparkled with emeralds, and the houses were made of green marble. The people wore green clothes and had greenish skin. The shops sold green items, even green candy and lemonade. They reached the Palace of Oz, where a soldier with a green uniform and beard greeted them. The soldier relayed that the Great Wizard would grant them an audience one by one. They were led to comfortable rooms to rest. Dorothy followed a green girl to her lovely green-themed room with green silk sheets and a green fountain. Each friend was shown to their own pleasant room in the Palace, except the Scarecrow, who stood waiting, the Tin Woodman who checked his joints, and the Lion who curled up and purred to sleep.|['1.

The next day, the green maiden led Dorothy to the Throne Room of the Great Oz. Dorothy wore a beautiful green gown and a matching silk apron. Toto, her dog, had a green ribbon around his neck. They entered a hall filled with people in rich costumes who waited outside the Throne Room, eager to see the Wizard. The soldier who took Dorothy's message assured her that Oz would see her. Inside the Throne Room, Dorothy found a magnificent place adorned with emeralds. In the center was a throne of green marble with a large head, no body, and sparkling gems. The Head told Dorothy that to return to Kansas, she must first help by defeating the Wicked Witch. Dorothy agreed and left, knowing she had a challenging task ahead.|['1.

Sadly, Dorothy left the Throne Room and returned to where her friends, the Lion, the Scarecrow, and the Tin Woodman, were waiting anxiously. She shared that Oz had informed her that she could only return home after defeating the Wicked Witch of the West, a task she felt incapable of accomplishing. The Scarecrow then approached Oz, appearing as a beautiful Lady, requesting to have brains instead of straw. Oz agreed to grant him brains if he eliminated the Wicked Witch. Next, the Tin Woodman sought a heart from Oz, who had transformed into a fearsome Beast. Oz promised him a heart after the Witch's demise. Lastly, the Lion bravely approached Oz, who appeared as a Ball of Fire, seeking a solution to help his friends. Each friend faced a unique challenge from the enigmatic Oz, testing their courage and resolve.|"['1.

The Fiery Orb blazed brightly, demanding proof of the Wicked Witch's demise for courage. The Lion, infuriated, left the room, meeting his companions to share the encounter. They decided to set off the next day. The Woodman readied his axe, the Scarecrow stuffed himself with straw, and Dorothy improved his sight. The green girl packed food for them and placed a bell on Toto. They slept early, awakened by a green cock's crow. The Guardian of the Gates warned them of the Witch's wickedness. They headed West and the landscape changed, Dorothy's dress turning white. The Witch, spotting them, summoned wolves. The Woodman swiftly defeated them. The next morning, the Witch, enraged, blew her whistle, signaling trouble ahead.|"['1.

The Scarecrow and his companions encountered a flock of crows commanded by the Wicked Witch to sting them to death. Quick to act, the Scarecrow instructed the Woodman to scatter his straw over Dorothy, Toto, and the Lion, protecting them from the bees' stings. The bees, frustrated by their broken stings against the Woodman's tin, perished. Enraged by this failure, the Witch sent her Winkie slaves armed with spears to attack. However, the Lion's fierce roar sent the Winkies fleeing back to the castle. The Witch, determined to defeat the group, decided to use her last resort: a Golden Cap that could summon Winged Monkeys. This cap had been used twice before to enslave the Winkies and drive out the Great Oz. Now, with her other forces defeated, the Witch planned to call upon the Winged Monkeys for the final showdown.|"[""1.

The magic spell took effect, darkening the sky with a rumbling sound. Monkeys with immense wings appeared, causing chaos. They dropped the Tin Woodman on sharp rocks, leaving him battered. The Scarecrow had his straw removed and was thrown into a tree. The Lion was tied up and flown to the Witch's castle. Dorothy, protected by the Good Witch's kiss, was carried to the castle unharmed. The Monkeys explained to the Witch that they couldn't harm Dorothy due to the Power of Good. The Witch, fearing Dorothy's Silver Shoes, planned to make her a slave. Dorothy was made to work in the kitchen while the Witch attempted to harness the Lion. However, Dorothy secretly fed the Lion, forming a bond with him.

Dorothy felt disheartened and sat on the grass, unsure of what to do next. Toto, too tired to chase a butterfly, panted beside her. Remembering the whistle gifted by the Queen of the Mice, Dorothy blew it, summoning the tiny creatures to her aid. The Queen suggested using the charm of Dorothy's Golden Cap to call the mischievous Winged Monkeys to take them to the City of Oz. Reciting the charm, Dorothy summoned the Monkeys, who swiftly lifted them into the air. Initially frightened, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman soon enjoyed the aerial view.

Oz cut a hole in the Tin Woodman's chest and replaced his missing heart with a silk one filled with sawdust. He then gave the Cowardly Lion a potion for courage, urging him to drink it. Oz, feeling like a humbug, pondered the challenge of helping Dorothy return to Kansas. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion were content with their gifts but Dorothy missed Oz's presence.

Dorothy swiftly sewed together strips of silk in different shades of green to make a large balloon. Oz planned to visit a wizard in the clouds and used hot air to inflate the balloon. The people marveled at the sight as the balloon rose into the sky. Dorothy, not wanting to leave her dog Toto behind, searched for him in the crowd. As she found Toto and ran towards the balloon, it began to lift off the ground. Sadly, they bid farewell to Oz, who might have safely reached Omaha.

The path lay straight to the South, but tales of dangers loomed ahead. Wild beasts roamed the woods, and a strange tribe guarded their land from strangers, deterring Quadlings from reaching the Emerald City. Despite the risks, the group decided that Dorothy must seek Glinda's aid in the South to return home to Kansas.

The Scarecrow led the group and found a tree with wide branches. As he passed underneath, the branches wrapped around him and tossed him among the others. The Woodman, determined, chopped a branch that tried to seize him. The Tin Woodman followed safely. Toto got caught, but the Woodman freed him. They realized only the first row of trees could bend their branches, like forest policemen. Walking through, they reached a high wall of white china. The Woodman made a ladder. The Scarecrow climbed first, exclaiming at the sight. The Lion and the Tin Woodman followed, amazed by the view below. They saw a land with china houses and people made of china, all tiny. A little china dog barked at them. Unable to pull the ladder up, they all jumped down, landing on the Scarecrow to protect their feet. They fixed him up and continued on their journey.|['1.

As they strolled through the land of the china people, the first sight they encountered was a china milkmaid tending to a china cow. Suddenly, the cow kicked over everything in a clatter, leaving the milkmaid frustrated. The cow's leg broke, and she needed to mend it at the shop. The milkmaid, upset, led her cow away, casting reproachful glances at the strangers. Then, a clown, cracked and mended in many places, approached them. Dorothy admired the china Princess but learned that taking her away would stiffen her joints. As they journeyed through the china country, they reached a wall. Climbing over it, the Lion accidentally toppled a china church. Moving on, they navigated a challenging landscape of bogs and marshes before entering a vast, ancient forest that enchanted them all.|"['1.

When the sun rose, they resumed their journey. Soon, they heard a distant growl, like wild animals. Toto whimpered, but the others weren't scared. Following the path, they reached a clearing filled with all sorts of creatures. Tigers, elephants, bears, and wolves gathered, causing Dorothy to feel a moment of fear. The Lion explained that the animals were in trouble due to a giant spider-like monster threatening them. The monster had a body as big as an elephant, long legs like tree trunks, and a mouth with sharp teeth. The Lion defeated the monster while it slept. Later, they encountered a short, stout man with a shooting head. Despite his attempts to stop them, they continued on their journey.
