The old Yale fence was a hub of activity where students gathered to read, study, chat, and socialize. This spot was cherished by alumni as a symbol of democratic spirit at Yale. Unlike Harvard, where drinking often took place in expensive clubs, Yale students frequented places like Morey's and Traeger's for a more casual atmosphere.
