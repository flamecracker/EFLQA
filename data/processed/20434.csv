While the whole group was having their lunch, one of them, named Robert Quail White, was known as Bob White due to his Southern accent.

""Which direction did it come from, Thad?"" inquired Smithy, who, despite his tidy appearance and delicate manner, stood close to the leader, his face paler than usual but his eyes filled with newfound determination. ""Listen!"" ordered Thad, raising his hand, prompting them all to stop. Each scout strained to hear any sound that could lead them to where Bumpus needed help. The six boys rushed through the underbrush, making a racket like an elephant in their eagerness to reach their companion in distress. Thrilled and expecting to encounter a savage beast, the boys searched frantically. ""I believe Bumpus is by that large tree trunk over there, sir,"" Allan said, saluting as per the organization's rules.

Thad called out cheerfully to Bumpus to hold on a bit, as they didn't have a rope to pull him up and the stump was rotten. He sent Giraffe for an ax to cut a hole for Bumpus to climb out. The scout-master assured Bumpus that Allan would handle the ax well. Allan arrived quickly with the ax, and Giraffe mentioned making a fire. Allan carefully chopped a hole near Bumpus, who urged them to hurry due to swelling from bites. With the help of his friends, Bumpus was pulled out of the tree trunk. Thad had a package with medical supplies from Dr. Philander, including bandages and remedies, to help Bumpus with his swollen face.

Bumpus, a good-natured fellow, was being treated by Thad with a lavender-colored fluid after being bitten. Despite looking like a strange freak, Bumpus was more concerned about the treatment being effective than the stains.

As they prepared to resume their march, Step-hen couldn't find his campaign hat, prompting a discussion about keeping track of belongings.

In the past, a wealthy man owned the land with plans for a game preserve, but his passing left the project unfinished. The widow sold the property to a lumber company, abandoning the idea of a game preserve. Davy Jones, known for his sharpness and legal lineage, shared this history. As the group continued their journey, Bumpus, feeling a bit refreshed, was supported by his friends. They approached the lake, its waves glistening under the sun. The sight motivated them, especially Bumpus, who was kindly assisted by Step-hen. Despite Step-hen's generosity, Bumpus suspected ulterior motives regarding a missing compass.

They all sat in different poses, breathing heavily, looking at the intruder with mixed feelings. Some hearts raced like trip-hammers; others found humor in the situation, chuckling a bit despite initial alarm. Allan and Thad, being different and having prior encounters, saw the funny side. In a mere minute, the scene unfolded. Thad, safe on a branch, saw the oddly dressed scouts fleeing from the bear. The bear, standing bewildered, sniffed the air for food. Thad, now calm, found the situation comical. Bumpus, in horror, thought the bear eyed him as a meal. Thad realized the bear's odd behavior and the dangling chain. The boys feared the bear climbing their tree and wondered about its climbing abilities. The bear, hungry and helpless, begged for food.

Thad found a shiny bugle on his way to a tree and decided to play it. To everyone's surprise, the bear started dancing to the tune. Thad's friends watched in amazement as the bear twirled around like a real dancing bear. Smithy then revealed that he had met the bear before and even fed it bread. The group realized they needed to lure the bear out of their campsite before it ate all their food and settled in for the night. Thad suggested that Smithy, who had a previous connection with the bear, should try to coax it away.

Thad hesitated, unsure if Smithy should take the risk of approaching the bear. However, Smithy was eager, feeling confident the bear would remember him as friendly. Davy chimed in, urging Thad to let Smithy try, as the cold was getting to him. Giraffe suggested trying a quarter of a loaf instead of the whole, not wanting good food wasted on the bear. Thad agreed to let Smithy try, cautioning him to be alert. Bumpus watched, relieved that fate didn't choose him as bear bait.

The Southern boy's response was telling. He guided the boat towards the island's shore with determined strokes, prompting Thad to leap onto land swiftly. Bumpus, though hesitant, followed suit cautiously. The three scouts now stood on the sandy beach, intrigued by signs of prior visitors. Thad's curiosity was piqued, driven by a sense of adventure or a hereditary love for the unknown. As they prepared to explore the island, Bumpus hesitated, torn between sticking with his friends for safety or staying by the boat. Fearful of being alone and vulnerable to any lurking dangers, Bumpus decided to stay close to his companions, armed with cudgels for protection.

Giraffe expressed his suspicions about a group snooping around the area, hinting they might be involved in illegal hunting activities. He vowed to keep an eye out for traps set to catch wildlife and investigate suspicious activities around the lake. The group discussed their opinions late into the night, with no new groundbreaking ideas emerging. They retired to bed, divided on whether the educated tramp with the bear owner was cunning or deceitful. The night passed peacefully, with no threats. Allan, a seasoned camper, checked the surroundings periodically. A strange cry startled them, but it turned out to be a bird unfamiliar to the area. The next morning, after a swim, Thad randomly selected a companion for an expedition, with Smithy being chosen. Thad hoped the trip would help Smithy grow into a brave and self-sufficient scout.|"['1.

"""Yes,"" said the leader, smiling, ""after discussing with Allan, who will be in charge here, I've decided to take an extra scout. Three are better than two in case of trouble."" Bumpus suggested this, looking worried. What if he was the unlucky one chosen to go to the island again? Some hoped to be chosen, while others were indifferent. Davy was excited; he loved danger. Giraffe wanted to catch bass. Step-hen teased Bumpus and Giraffe, hinting at a race. Bumpus, new to swimming, agreed to race Giraffe the next day.

Step-hen was determined to find a way to prove that Bumpus had the compass. He didn't want to ask the scout-master for help as he was obstinate and wanted to handle it himself. Meanwhile, Bumpus had already forgotten the conflict and was his usual cheerful self. Thad, Allan, and Davy were preparing to journey to the mysterious island. Thad reassured the group that they would be back for lunch and mentioned they were carrying snacks. Thad wished he had brought his gun for comfort, but they didn't want to appear too military-like. Davy, eager to explore the island, urged Thad to hurry. The scouts watched as the trio embarked on their expedition, teasing each other playfully.|"[""1.

Once the boat had sailed about fifty yards away from the shore, the scout leader took out his bugle, which had been concealed until then, and played a mournful tune as a farewell to the departing travelers. The sound was so sorrowful that it made Davy Jones cover his ears and shake his fist at the bugler. Despite the interruption, the bugler continued until Allan intervened. The scout leader, accompanied by his two brave helpers, embarked on a journey to uncover the secrets of the mysterious island. Little did they know the unexpected events that would unfold from this expedition. As the departing adventurers received a final cheer from those on the shore, they set off towards the unknown island. Thad and his friends chuckled upon hearing Step-hen's complaints from inside the tent about his missing coat. The group paddled towards the island, with the scout leader offering Davy some paddling tips along the way. Davy, though not as skilled as Allan or Bob White, managed to steer the canoe straight. Thad demonstrated the proper paddling technique to Davy, emphasizing the importance of silence and precision in paddling. Davy expressed his longing to visit Maine, inspired by Allan's tales of the pine woods. Smithy, though hesitant due to his overprotective mother, also expressed his desire to explore new adventures with his friends.|['1.

Davy was enthusiastic about exploring the black holes, suggesting they could be ideal fox dens or wolf hiding spots. The scout leader, Thad, cautioned Davy to wait and observe the surroundings. Thad was keen on studying footprints to uncover any potential threats on the island.

Thad and his friends were exploring a remote area, suspecting some shady activities were happening there. Davy was glad they came without much prior knowledge, enjoying the thrill of the unknown. Thad suspected hidden shacks or caves where suspects might be hiding. They discussed the possibility of poachers or criminals using the area as a hideout. Smithy raised concerns about a man seen at their campfire, wondering if he was involved with the suspicious group. Thad speculated the man could be an undercover game warden or law enforcement officer after criminals. Davy's imagination ran wild, suggesting the suspects might have broken into a rich man's place in Faversham.

"""I believe that game wardens are hired by the State,"" Thad explained to Davy. ""It doesn't concern the regular police if someone hunts deer out of season or fishes for black bass illegally.""

""That makes sense, Davy,"" Thad continued. ""You seem destined to follow your father's path into law after you finish school. I doubt we'll find any illegal nets in the lake or traps for partridges in the woods from now on.""

""I remember our visitor was tall,"" Thad recalled. ""I heard how they tricked Malcolm, taking advantage of his small stature and white hands, making him look like a woman in a police uniform. But he's sharp as lightning.""

""That visitor can't be the Faversham Head of Police,"" Thad deduced. ""Maybe they're working together, trying to send a message through you to Hotchkiss.""

""You've figured it out well, Thad,"" Davy praised. ""Seems like a big game, hiring a bear man to travel with him, asking questions undercover.""

""I don't get why an officer would do that,"" Thad admitted. ""Maybe they're moonshiners, like in Bob White's area, but we've done our part. Let's head back to camp.""
