O'Grady expressed his uncertainty about getting involved with the Spaniards and preferred marching against the French. However, the lack of information about the French's whereabouts and strength made the situation challenging. Despite previous victories, the French fought well, even when outnumbered. The tension in the camp made risky actions unwise. O'Grady was relieved to hear that there was still whisky in camp, saved for the sergeants who helped train the men. The soldiers had improved significantly in drill and shooting skills, with support from dedicated non-commissioned officers. O'Grady struggled with learning the language but was willing to try. The officers' dedication and the soldiers' progress were commendable, even if parade movements were not as polished as the infantry's.|"[""1.

"Terence chuckled, ""It's essential, O'Grady. An adjutant who can't communicate is useless. I'd love to have you with me, but there are drawbacks. You outrank me in our army, and I'd hate to give you orders. Bull and Macwitty just got commissions and would feel awkward having you under them. Besides, you dislike work, and there's more to do here. Portuguese regiments expect discipline. O'Grady, you must walk straight to your tent after a night at mess, a superstition. The Portuguese are serious about it. I doubt you'd fit in. Colonel O'Connor will march to Plasencia, scout the French army, and report daily. He must avoid contact with the enemy and prevent news from reaching them. He'll focus on the area between the mountains and Almaraz. If attacked, he'll retreat to the mountains.

The commander swiftly ordered the troops to prepare for an immediate march upon the arrival of Herrara, Bull, and Macwitty. Tents were to be dismantled and handed over to the quartermaster, with each soldier carrying four days' worth of biscuits. Three carts were to accompany each battalion, to be drawn from the quartermaster's department. Six men from each battalion were to assist in managing the carts. Additionally, each battalion needed to carry 25,000 rounds of spare ammunition and a 250-pound chest.

By now, Terence had discovered that the French forces in the north were stronger than he had thought. He underestimated Soult's army and was unaware that Ney had left Galicia and was moving south rapidly. Del Parque had not kept his promise to defend Bejar and Banos, leaving only a few of Cuesta's Spaniards to hold the passes. Terence was ordered to guard these passes, with his battalions positioned to secure them. He discussed the situation with Sir Robert, who believed a large French force was approaching. They planned to signal each other with bonfires in case of an attack. Terence acknowledged that his men could delay an advance but not stop it without artillery. Sir Robert expressed concerns about the delays in Sir Arthur's plans and the movements of the French forces.|"['1.

I believe your plan is excellent, and I am committed to executing it. We are both guarding the left side of our army, and our cooperation will enhance our defense. We should establish another signal system. One fire indicates a march away, possibly towards Madrid to force Victor to divide his troops. Two fires signal the French advancing from various directions. Together, we can fortify the defiles effectively. I would greatly appreciate your assistance if Soult approaches. My 1200 soldiers are reliable, but the 3000 newly recruited men may not perform well in intense combat. With your two battalions, we can hold the defiles for an extended period if needed. Two days later, Terence was ordered to move swiftly with his troops down the valley, parallel to the hills, and await further instructions at Alberche to counter any French attempts to flank the British.|"['1.

Cuesta agreed to Sir Arthur's pleas and moved back across the Alberche River to position themselves near Talavera. The area's marshy ground and a stream provided a natural defense. A redoubt with Spanish artillery stood on the left, while a strong battery was on the right near Talavera. Sir Arthur fortified the front with fallen trees and abattis to strengthen the line against any attack. Campbell's division was on the British right, followed by Sherbrooke, the German legion in the center, and Donkin on a hill two-thirds of the way across the valley. General Hill's division was to hold the northern face. The area between the positions was filled with olive and cork trees, spanning two miles from Talavera to the hill. The valley was half a mile wide, rugged, and intersected by a ravine with a stream flowing into the Tagus at Talavera.|"['1.

As the day was calm, Terence decided to have lunch with his friends in Talavera. They had plenty of supplies and were prepared for any situation. The officers discussed the soldiers' lack of food and the need for provisions. Suddenly, heavy firing was heard from the woods, and the British troops were caught off guard. Sir Arthur quickly organized the troops, and the French advance was halted. The French army descended from the high ground, and a division moved towards the allies' left. The French cavalry tried to provoke the Spanish troops, causing a panic. The Spanish line broke, and thousands fled in fear. The British and Spanish forces engaged in battle, with the French retreating momentarily. The news of defeat spread, but the allies continued to fight bravely.|"['1.

Cuesta had initially panicked but recovered, sending cavalry to retrieve the fleeing soldiers. By morning, some troops had returned, but 6000 were still missing. The British, with the German Legion, numbered 19,000, while the French had 50,000 troops. Bull expressed frustration, suggesting they would fare better alone. Terence strategically positioned his battalion on the hillside, anticipating a French attack. Bull's battalion was stationed at the hill's foot for added defense. As they prepared for battle, the French attempted to flank Donkin's brigade. Terence and Herrara observed the unfolding skirmish. French troops ascended the hill, prompting a firefight.

The command was given, and the battalion set out across the valley towards the steep ascent. As twilight approached, the Portuguese soldiers made their way unnoticed towards the French forces climbing the hill. With a swift and coordinated attack, the Portuguese surprised the French, causing them to recoil and retreat down the hill. General Hill's reinforcements played a crucial role in turning the tide of the battle. Despite the fierce fighting, the Portuguese, led by Terence, successfully repelled the French forces. Terence's strategic decision to flank the enemy proved to be a decisive move that ultimately saved the day.

Brushwood was now gathered, and soon numerous fires blazed. The men were joyful, proud of defeating a stronger enemy force. They were pleased with their captains' praise for their bravery. At dawn, the enemy moved again, seeking to take the hills held by the British. Terence, seeing Hill's division secure, faced threats from two regiments of light troops. Macwitty's battalion lined up, ready for battle. The French, advancing in skirmishing order, were halted by the British fire. Despite three failed attempts to rush, the French were forced back. Terence observed the fight across the valley. The hillside was lit with fire as the French climbed, only to be pushed back by the British. After 40 minutes, the French retreated, losing 1500 men. The light troops opposing Terence also withdrew. Sir Arthur Wellesley moved cavalry and Spanish troops to support Terence. The French suffered losses but planned to attack again, despite Soult's approaching forces. The king feared for Madrid's safety and wanted the British to retreat. Both sides remained quiet until midday, sharing a moment of peace by the rivulet. The soldiers rested, preparing for the imminent battle.|['1.

The French forces were well-prepared for the battle. Ruffin's division was assigned to cross the valley, move along the mountain's base, and outflank the British left. Villatte guarded the valley entrance with one brigade and threatened Hill with another. Lapisse's division, along with Sebastiani, attacked the British center. Milhaud's dragoons were strategically placed on the main road to Talavera to prevent Spanish reinforcements for the British. The battle commenced with a fierce assault on the British right, but Campbell's division and Mackenzie's brigade, supported by Spanish columns, repelled the French with heavy losses. Despite initial setbacks, the British successfully defended against French attacks on their center and right. On the left, the 23rd Light Dragoons and 1st German Hussars charged Ruffin's column but faced difficulties crossing a ravine. The British forces effectively repelled the French assaults, leading to the French retreat behind the Alberche River. The British suffered 6200 casualties, including 600 prisoners, while the French losses totaled 7400.

The commander-in-chief praised the Minho regiment's brave actions during a critical battle. Colonel O'Connor led his troops to repel a French attack, causing the enemy to retreat. Later, Terence received orders to secure the pass of Banos with the Spanish forces. While scouting the area, they encountered French troops. Terence quickly retreated to avoid a confrontation with the larger French army. The Portuguese troops bravely defended themselves when pursued by French cavalry, forcing the enemy to retreat. Terence, realizing the danger posed by the advancing French forces, decided to inform Sir Arthur of the situation. With Soult's army moving swiftly, Terence understood the urgency of the situation and acted promptly to warn Sir Arthur of the impending threat.|"['1.

Before we act, it's best to observe the situation. We should cross the Sierra to camp where we can watch the French movements on the plain. This way, we can also monitor the road to Plasencia and inform Sir Arthur of any additional French troops heading into the valley. Our position is risky, and if Sir Arthur knows, he'll likely retreat from Talavera. Victor will follow, and his cavalry will meet Soult's soon. It's wise to wait and see how things unfold before descending to the plain. Two troopers were dispatched with news of 15,000 French troops in the valley, and more arriving the next day. The regiment moved across the Sierra, positioning high up with Plasencia to the right and Oropesa visible across the valley. On the following day, another army corps descended towards Plasencia, blocking the British retreat. Troopers reported movements to Sir Arthur, who then marched to Oropesa to face Soult before Victor's arrival.|"[""1.

I dislike approaching Banos, Herrara, as the French likely have a significant presence there, and finding a local guide might be challenging since the villagers in the surrounding areas have probably fled. It might be safer to travel along this side of the Sierra, cross the road above Plasencia, head towards the mountains, and descend near the river Coa where Beresford might be located. We stand a better chance of locating a guide this way than going through Banos. The journey will be tough regardless, even if we manage to avoid encountering any French troops. It's dark now, so climbing the mountains would be risky. It's best to wait until morning to search for a guide. Dressing up some men as peasants and sending them in pairs to scour the hills might yield better results. By nightfall, three peasants were captured, but they were uncooperative until one agreed to lead the group to a path the next day in exchange for their safety and payment. Precautions were taken to ensure the captives didn't escape and alert the French. At dawn, the group descended into the valley, and upon encountering French cavalry, they formed a defensive square and repelled the attack successfully.|['1.

Terence quickly realized the need for a change in formation to outmaneuver the French cavalry. Urging Bull to act swiftly, they altered their formation to a column of eight abreast, ready to face the enemy in lines four deep on either side if charged again. As they advanced, the cavalry attempted to meet them, but the Portuguese's well-timed fire forced the French to withdraw. Bull's strategic maneuvers, forming a T-shaped column, kept the march steady despite repeated cavalry attacks. Terence, aware of the looming threat, urged them to double their pace to reach safety. With the French infantry closing in fast, Herrara planned to hold a strategic position to delay the enemy. As the French gathered, the Portuguese prepared to defend their ground, ready for a fierce confrontation.|"['1.

After a brief delay, a group of soldiers split into skirmishers, while the others divided into two groups, moving alongside the rocks to the left and right. Terence realized he couldn't defend against such a spread-out attack with only 200 men. He achieved his goal as the descent behind them was clear, and he could see the column ascending the hill in the distance. The French cavalry had retreated after their last charge, leaving the infantry to handle the situation. Terence ordered a retreat, and the Portuguese soldiers quickly descended the slope. As they reached halfway, the French cavalry appeared, charging down from the right. The Portuguese formed a square and fought back, holding off the cavalry's attacks. Eventually, Terence decided to surrender to avoid further loss of life. He identified himself to the French officer, explaining the situation and the valor of his Portuguese troops in battle.|"['1.

In a short while, the French cavalry and infantry set off towards Plasencia with the Portuguese prisoners. The Portuguese captives, feeling proud of their efforts to cover their comrades' retreat, marched with dignity despite their captivity. Upon reaching Plasencia, they were placed in a large converted prison with other prisoners, mostly Spaniards captured by Marshal Soult. Terence, a British officer, was questioned by General Foy through an English-speaking officer. General Foy inquired about Wilson's whereabouts, to which Terence replied honestly. General Heron praised the two battalions under Terence's command for their bravery. Terence decided to accept freedom on parole as escaping alone through the mountains was nearly impossible. He was lodged in a house with French officers who treated him kindly. The war was conducted honorably between the English and French, with prisoners receiving good treatment. Terence spent his time studying French newspapers and improving his language skills. After three weeks in Plasencia, he was instructed to prepare for a journey to Talavera with a convoy of prisoners. Riding with the officer in charge made the two-day trip enjoyable. Upon reaching Talavera, the British captives were to be interned in a French fortress on the frontier.|"['1.

The commander of the escort from Plasencia praised Terence to the officer leading the two hundred men continuing with them. To avoid any commotion in Madrid, the group was directed to march towards the Escurial, then over the Sierra to Segovia, and up through Valladolid and Burgos. As the escort was infantry only, Terence had to walk with the other officers as he couldn't take his horse. Terence, optimistic about their journey, discussed escape plans once they reached prison. His companion had been injured by a French shell but had recovered. They shared their experiences, with Ryan expressing frustration at the lack of help from the Spaniards. The group, including convalescents heading back to France, had waggons for the weak and provisions for the journey.

In mid-August, the heat in the Tagus valley was intense. The convoy set off at 6 a.m., taking a break at 8 under the shade of olive trees until 5 p.m. The warm night led many to sleep outdoors with blankets to avoid the fleas in stuffy cottages. They reached Escurial on the third day, then continued towards Segovia. The journey to Aranda on the Douro River and then north to Gamonal followed. Passing through Miranda and Zadorra, they ascended the Pyrenees. The marches, longer now, helped the soldiers gain strength. The camaraderie between English and French soldiers made the march pleasant. The prisoners, though not trying to escape, were cautious due to guerilla threats.

In the past, conflicts between soldiers and peasants led to retaliation and a deepening sense of animosity on both sides. Peasants often formed guerilla groups after defeats, resorting to banditry in the hills between the Bay of Biscay and the Mediterranean. These guerillas, while targeting the soldiers primarily, also plundered their own people for supplies, causing havoc in villages. The challenging terrain of the mountains made it hard for them to sustain themselves, with limited communication between different regions. During Napoleon's campaign, the mountain passes proved treacherous, delaying the troops and causing significant losses. The French officer recounted the hardships faced by their army, including attacks from the local peasants. The night in a village ended with a tense encounter with guerilla forces, demonstrating the dangers lurking in the hills.|"['1.

But know that we officers plan to defend this church without our uniforms. If any of you wish to join us, you're welcome.

The men responded with cheers and laughter, quickly shedding their red uniforms. They armed themselves with the captured French muskets and clubs. The battle raged on, with the officers urging the men to conserve ammunition. The major suggested a strategic sortie under cover of darkness to surprise the guerillas. The plan was to divide into two groups and attack from both ends of the village.

The leader emphasized the need for silence as they prepared to leave the church. The English officers also instructed their men to be quiet. It was decided that they would exit two by two, ready to attack in different directions if needed. A French lieutenant stayed behind to command the wounded. The soldiers wrapped their boots to muffle their steps. Eager to face the enemy, both French and English troops were ready for action. They split up and moved through the village, the French charging down the main street, while the British cleared the houses. The Spaniards fled in panic as the soldiers fought fiercely.

At Bayonne, the British officers and their escort bid farewell on friendly terms with the French, who expressed admiration for their bravery and suggested their immediate release and return to Portugal. The major handed over the soldiers to the prison authorities and then took Terence and the other officers to meet the town's governor. The major recounted the fight with the guerillas and how the prisoners had joined forces with the French to defeat the Spanish. The governor thanked the officers and offered them the liberty of the town on parole, which most accepted, except for Terence and Lieutenant Ryan, who preferred not to give their parole to keep their options open for a possible escape. The officers were assigned prison quarters, with those on parole having more freedom to move about the town while Terence and Ryan were confined to a room with a sentry. Terence and Ryan discussed their situation, including their limited funds and the need for careful planning for a potential escape.|"[""1.

Our barred windows face west, blocked by buildings, denying us a view of the sea. Escaping by cutting through the bars is futile. Speaking French, as agreed, will be our norm, with an hour of respite daily. A warder brings us broth, meat, vegetables, bread, and wine. Few prisoners are held here; naval officers were recently moved inland. A cousin of the warder is sympathetic and willing to help us escape. This could be our chance to break free. The guards may soon change, offering us an opportunity to flee. Our escape from this prison seems promising. Vigilance is lax here, unlike at other prisons near the border.|"['1.

When Terence and Ryan left after breakfast, the sentries they passed saluted them as if they were officers. They returned the salute and exchanged friendly words. A French staff officer questioned why they saluted a prisoner. The soldier explained they saluted a brave officer who had saved their lives in battle. The French officer understood and admired their respect for bravery. The soldiers planned to help the colonel escape, but the challenge was finding a way out of town. One soldier, a native, promised to aid in the escape. They agreed to keep their plans secret to ensure success.

The soldier assured Monsieur that his sister's husband, Jules Varlin, a fisherman, would provide shelter. He could hide in the loft with the fishing nets. Jules might even accompany him down the river to ensure a safe passage. The soldier provided tools for escape - a saw to cut the lock, an augur to make holes, and files to remove bars. The plan involved distracting the guards, disguises, and using a rope to descend. The soldier emphasized that the blame would be shared among many soldiers to avoid severe punishment. Monsieur was advised to wait until midnight to escape, wearing disguises over their uniforms and destroying their old clothes.

They worked for hours that night, being careful not to drop any filings outside. By morning, the holes were filled with bread paste and dust, blending with the bars perfectly. The next day, they avoided talking to the soldiers and waited until night to work on the door. With the help of files, they managed to cut through the bars and the lock.

The man mentioned the possibility of bad weather as they settled on the nets. He hoped the rough conditions would deter boats from going out, avoiding comments on his decision to stay home.

Terence and Ryan woke up when Jules arrived. They got ready with their gear and provisions. Jules carried the water barrel, said goodbye to Marie, and headed to the ship. They watched as Jules skillfully maneuvered the boat. The tide helped them drift down the river before they hoisted the sail. Jules steered the boat expertly as they sailed south. After a while, Jules disembarked, leaving them with a compass for guidance. He reminded them to stay clear of the Spanish coast. Jules had taught Terence how to sail the boat, explaining wind directions and sail adjustments.

Jules estimated our sailing speed at about four knots an hour down the river, and now about three knots and a half. Dicky calculated the distance to Corunna and Santander. They were cautious due to the weather and the Spanish coast ahead. The wind picked up, forcing them to reef the sail. As night approached, they anchored close to shore for shelter. The next morning, they resumed sailing but encountered stronger winds. Terence suggested heading towards shore to avoid taking on water.

Terence and Dick found themselves in a challenging situation at sea. They decided to lower the sail and row towards shore as the wind picked up. After struggling with the oars, they realized they were farther from land. Terence suggested running before the wind until the gale passed. They bailed out water, ate provisions, and lit a lantern for comfort. Despite being drenched and cold, they felt hopeful that their small boat could withstand the rough weather.

Once in a while, the baler was used to keep them dry from the splashing water. They chatted happily, both having good spirits. They took turns smoking their pipes, sharing fire to avoid using the lantern. Morning brought relief, surrounded by mist and rain.

Terence and Ryan found themselves in a challenging situation on a ship where they were mistaken for Spaniards. Despite their protests, they were forced to join the crew. The captain, unaware of their language, saw them as valuable additions due to their skills. The ship was headed to Brest, and the crew believed they were safe until they spotted an English warship. Panic ensued as the crew prepared for a confrontation. The captain, in a fit of anger, even injured a lookout. As the British sloop closed in, tension rose on the deck. With cannons fired and orders shouted, the crew scrambled to respond to the imminent threat.

A light wind stirred as the vessel moved through the water at three knots an hour. The men swiftly manned the guns as the ship's course changed to catch the wind. The first mate stood by an eighteen-pounder gun, ready for action. The sloop fired shots overhead, but the lugger retaliated, hitting the sloop's bulwarks. The sloop's broadside response caused damage, injuring sailors and cutting ropes. Despite this, the lugger's crew cheered, knowing their advantage with the wind. The sloop aimed to cripple the lugger, but the captain ordered to lower the foresail and make a quick repair.

Two sailors, Terence and his companion, devised a plan to travel discreetly. They decided to speak French if questioned and made up stories about being ill-treated on a ship. They bought provisions and blankets for their journey to Saint Malo. Walking through villages, they avoided detection, sleeping in ditches during the day and walking at night. They reached Dinan and continued towards the port. Despite concerns about their story not adding up, they crossed the river and traveled towards the coast. Terence hoped their French would suffice if questioned, but they aimed to avoid attention by sticking to the coastline.

It took them a while to launch the boat, and they estimated it was close to midnight when they departed from the river mouth. Until daylight revealed Jersey Island, they couldn't steer accurately. Terence noted their luck with the weather, crucial for their journey. He mentioned the risks of rough seas, currents, and encountering French privateers. As dawn approached, they prepared to sail towards Jersey, hoping they weren't off course. They raised the sail, increasing speed. Soon, they spotted a lugger and a schooner nearing each other.

The boat changed direction to sail closer to the wind. Both vessels were now moving slowly, with the boat trailing a few hundred yards behind the lugger. After sailing a bit further, the boat altered its course towards the schooner. Just as they approached, the mainsail of the schooner was damaged, causing it to come down. The lugger crew cheered and closed in on the schooner. When the two ships were side by side, a fierce fight broke out. The French boarders were pushing the Jersey men towards the stern. The Jersey men quickly moved aside as the cannons were aimed and fired at the French. The attack disheartened the French, who retreated back to their ship.

There is not much to complain about, sir. The regiment has been a bit slower in their drills since you've been away, but now that you're back, everything will be fine. The men missed you greatly and would have rushed back to you if allowed when they saw you in danger. The soldiers have been struggling with their uniforms and boots, as they haven't received any new ones. Many are in tattered clothes and worn-out boots. The men would prefer sandals, which they are more used to, and can march longer distances in them. The rations are satisfactory, with bread, meat, and wine being provided regularly. The issue lies with the uniforms. Sandals could be a practical solution, easily made from hides, resembling Indian moccasins. They are comfortable and suitable for marching in the hills.|"['1.

Terence proposed a new idea for the troops' footwear, suggesting sandals made from black hides to replace worn-out boots. He believed the sandals would be quieter for night attacks and asked skilled shoemakers among the soldiers to craft them for a small fee. The troops spent a week drilling and adjusting to the new footwear. Terence and Ryan then visited the Fusiliers in Portalegre, where they were warmly welcomed. Banter ensued between the soldiers, with Ryan defending his capabilities as an adjutant, despite O'Grady's teasing.

In spring, Ney besieged Ciudad Rodrigo with 50,000 men as the Agueda became fordable. Terence's regiment marched to Guarda where Wellington concentrated his army, leaving Hill with 12,000 men in the south. Spanish and Portuguese urged to relieve Ciudad Rodrigo, but Wellington declined risking the campaign. Facing Massena's 50,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry, Wellington's 56,000 men, including 20,000 Portuguese, prepared for Regnier's potential threat. Terence's Minho regiment, in new uniforms, reached Guarda. Terence was instructed to strengthen Almeida's garrison anticipating a French siege. With 500 men, he entered Almeida, fortified but lacking defense. Colonel Cox aimed to delay Massena for a month, relying on Terence's men for defense against artillery.

For a fortnight, the area remained undisturbed. Crawford's troops stayed across the Coa River, engaging in skirmishes with French scouts. However, on July 2nd, news arrived that Ciudad Rodrigo had fallen. It was now certain that the French would advance westward soon. Massena delayed, but on the morning of the 24th, the garrison at Almeida was suddenly attacked. Crawford, despite orders not to engage beyond the Coa, believed he could retreat if needed. The French surprised them in the wooded area, but the well-trained Light Division fought back fiercely, ensuring a safe retreat across the bridge. Almeida faced a siege starting on August 18th. Terence foresaw its fall due to weak defenses and demoralized Portuguese troops. The situation looked grim, with doubts about the town's ability to hold out.|"[""1.

Terence and Ryan, along with the half battalion, agreed to relieve the Portuguese troops at the redoubts at daybreak. Equipped with tools and an engineer officer, they began fortifying the positions. Men dug pits for galleries while others assisted the artillery. The French attacked the town, targeting the old castle and dropping shells. Terence and Ryan discussed the French strategy and the town's vulnerability. Fires broke out in the town, and the garrison struggled to respond to the French assault. Terence suspected disaffection among the officers. Despite the bombardment, the garrison held on. Terence eventually withdrew men from the ramparts to safety, anticipating a prolonged siege. The French focused on the city, aiming to prevent the garrison from controlling the fires. Communication between the redoubts was maintained through a hidden ditch. Throughout the day, the cannons roared, and smoke filled the air as the French intensified their attack.|"['1.

Yesterday, we decided on the best route to take. The French forces nearby are not strong, with most stationed between here and the Coa River. Massena, aware of the garrison's makeup here, only sent enough troops to guard the batteries, mainly positioned on the city's heights. There's no French camp between the roads to Escalon and Fort Conception, our escape route. Near Villa Puerca, there are significant forces, but we can follow the Turones River downstream safely. The French may be at the San Felices bridge, but the river is likely crossable. Their vigilance is likely low due to the explosion. We have enough biscuit supply for eight days and can move faster than French infantry. We'll avoid the enemy's trenches by moving between your redoubt and the town. The men must be silent and careful to evade detection. They silently left the redoubt and were joined by Bull's group. Scouts ahead reported French sentries, and some were quietly eliminated to allow safe passage. The march continued cautiously, with the sound of distant gunfire masking their movements.|"['1.

Ryan and his column marched towards a star on the horizon to ensure they stayed on track. They continued for three hours without interruption, covering at least twenty-five miles. Upon reaching a large village near the Aqueda, they rested. Later, they crossed the Aqueda, guided by a peasant, and found themselves in Portuguese territory. The troops celebrated their safe return. Terence then reunited with his regiment, boosting morale. Orders came to cooperate with Portuguese militia against Massena's advancing French army. Trant and Terence engaged Massena's forces, delaying their progress. The British army strategically positioned themselves at Sierra Busaco to counter the French advance.

During the battle between the British and French forces, Ney and Regnier arrived at the crest of a hill opposite the British position. Initially, Ney wanted to attack right away, knowing that some British divisions were not yet present. However, Massena, the French commander, was determined to fight. The French forces descended the hill at daybreak on the 29th, with Ney and Regnier leading the attack against the British positions. Despite their bravery, the French were met with strong resistance, especially from the British troops under Wellington's command. The French forces were unable to withstand the British onslaught, and the battle ended with the French retreating. The British held their ground, with determined troops making their position nearly impregnable. Ultimately, the French suffered heavy casualties compared to the allies due to the effective use of British artillery.|"['1.

Orders were given to the troops to march immediately. They were instructed to split into smaller groups and visit all nearby villages along the Mondego River. The villagers who hadn't followed the proclamations were to leave immediately. All food supplies were to be destroyed, mills set on fire, and machinery smashed. The troops were to head south, spreading out between the Zezere River and the sea, compelling peasants to move their animals towards Lisbon. The regiment quickly prepared for the task, dividing into smaller parties to carry out the orders. They moved along the Mondego, leaving behind groups to head south and execute the commands. The troops split further, some moving east towards the Zezere River and others following the Mondego to the sea. Officers were assigned to oversee the work and ensure coordination between the battalions. By daybreak, the villages were evacuated, belongings packed, and the frightened villagers forced to flee south.|"['1.

The slow progress of the work was due to delays in each village, making it a challenging task. The French aggressively pursued the British forces, engaging in minor battles with their cavalry. Terence, receiving orders, regrouped his regiment near the Zezere River to join Trant and other leaders. They aimed to disrupt Massena's rear and hinder French communication lines. Despite French movements, Terence's men gathered near the Mondego River, preparing to ambush the enemy. Trant proposed a surprise attack on Coimbra, believing their combined forces could overpower the few French troops left in the town.

Terence expressed his willingness to follow the orders of his senior officer, acknowledging their age and experience. The plan was set to surprise the French troops in Coimbra early the next morning. Terence proposed capturing the post while the main force entered the town, causing confusion. The key target was the Santa Clara convent, believed to house part of the garrison. The goal was to intercept Massena's troops, who were unaware of the impending attack. Macwitty was optimistic about cutting off the French retreat, but Terence cautioned that Wellington's outnumbered forces might have to retreat instead. The plan was to march at half-past three, aiming for a successful takeover of Coimbra.|"[""1.

At half-past three, the troops were awakened earlier than expected, surprising them after only a brief rest. The news spread quickly, and the soldiers were immediately alert and prepared. They crossed the river and marched swiftly towards Coimbra, arriving near the town by five o'clock. They were divided into four columns to enter the town from different directions. The signal to move was the sound of galloping cavalry. Terence listened for any signs of the French troops, but all was quiet. Suddenly, a group of horsemen thundered past, signaling the troops to advance. As they entered the town, the bugles sounded, and the Portuguese soldiers rushed forward with loud cheers. French troops were captured in public buildings, and the town was swiftly taken, except for the convent of Santa Clara. Trant's command arrived, and the troops moved to capture the convent, leading to the surrender of the astonished enemy. Wellington's army was strategically positioned on a fortified line to protect Lisbon, with three lines of defenses. The center was the most heavily fortified, making it nearly impregnable. Massena, surprised by the unexpected fortifications, realized the British position was too strong to attack. The British troops reinforced the defenses, making it clear that the enemy could not breach the formidable line of defense.|"[""1.

Wellington ordered the northern militia to advance and cross the Mondego to limit the French's district. Trant, Wilson, and other partisan corps assisted. A strong force positioned between Castello Branco and Abrantes surrounded the French. Despite ample provisions left in towns, the French cavalry still managed supplies. The Minho regiment, Wilson, and Trant guarded strategic points. Terence, with 1500 men, secured the frontier, capturing convoys and causing alarm in Ciudad Rodrigo. He cut off supplies and baffled the French, forcing them to retreat. The French garrison, unaware of Massena's situation, sent out troops but were met with resistance. Foy's cavalry ravaged the area, prompting Terence to withdraw. Beresford guarded the Tagus, harassing French marauders. The Minho regiment remained strong due to regular pay and provisions captured by Terence.|"['1.

In early spring, Soult, besieging Cadiz, received orders from Napoleon to cooperate with Massena. Soult crushed the Spanish force on the Gebora, captured Badajoz, and moved north. Meanwhile, Massena's army was weakened by sickness and famine due to exhausted supplies. Learning that Wellington was reinforced and ready to attack, Massena began his retreat, sending off the sick and stores. Ney guarded the rear but was forced to retreat, losing 500 men. Massena, tarnishing his reputation, destroyed villages during his retreat. Wellington pursued, but the advance was slowed by the need to build bridges. Massena retreated to Guarda, then to Sabuga on the Coa, where he was attacked. Despite some British divisions getting lost, Massena managed to reach Ciudad Rodrigo. The disobedience of his lieutenants hindered his plans, leading to fierce altercations.|"['1.

Even now, he did not feel safe, despite being joined by a large number of recovering soldiers. Drawing supplies for his troops from the citadel's stores, he led the army to Salamanca. After reorganizing his forces, securing fresh horses, and resting for a few days, Massena advanced to cover Ciudad Rodrigo and lift the siege of Almeida, which Wellington had initiated promptly. In a battle at Fuentes d'Onoro, Massena's 50,000 men clashed with the British. The fight was fierce, with the French pushing back the British right but failing to take the village. Despite both sides claiming victory, the British had the upper hand as Massena retreated without relieving Almeida.

The soldier expressed concern about the ongoing battle but mentioned that their center was holding its ground near the village. He was captured but noticed the intensity of the fire increasing. The battle continued for two more hours, lifting the spirits of the prisoners as it focused around the village. Despite setbacks on the right, the center stood firm against the French. The following day, 300 prisoners were escorted away while both armies maintained their positions. The soldiers speculated on the outcome, with indications that Massena might retreat. The convoy halted, and the wounded were tended to. The officer suggested that Massena might withdraw, indicating a potential victory for their side.

Despite initial setbacks, British resilience turned the tide, repelling French assaults. The valiant British infantry's unwavering courage secured victory amidst turmoil. Terence, a captive, gleaned updates from French guards. Reports hinted at Wellington's strategic shifts, consolidating forces with Beresford.

The British general faced a critical decision. With Regnier's division bolstering the French forces at Massena's side, besieging Ciudad was unfeasible. Meanwhile, Beresford couldn't engage in battle and the control of Badajoz by the French posed a threat to Portugal. Marmont now led the French army concentrated near Salamanca, capable of striking the British at Ciudad or joining forces with Soult against Cadiz or Portugal. Wellington strategized, leaving Spencer to guard the Coa while he marched south.

Negotiating with a local fruit seller, he devised a plan involving a rope and a disguise to evade capture and navigate the challenging terrain towards freedom.|"[""1.

It was fortunate that the muleteer suggested veering off from Estremadura into Portugal, steering clear of the scattered French army near Badajoz. The pass could be respected by higher-ups, but foraging parties might pose a threat. The muleteer proposed crossing the mountains to Portalegre and Elvas for safety. The conversation touched on the lack of provisions left by the army and the need to travel discreetly. There was a discussion on the reluctance of the Spanish and Portuguese to assist the British forces due to internal politics and lackluster leadership.

Garcia and Terence embarked on their journey in the early hours of the morning to escape. Garcia assured Terence of the muleteers' support in aiding the British officer's getaway. They prepared by disguising Terence with walnut juice to stain his face and hands. After a quick meal, they set off with Garcia leading the mules, followed by Terence and Sanchez. The mules, well cared for by Garcia, responded to their names and enjoyed the attention. As they left Salamanca behind, conversation was sparse, and Terence tried to mimic the Spaniards' endearing words to the mules. They passed through the gates and ventured towards safety, knowing that any pursuit would likely head in a different direction.

After a long day's journey, they stopped at a village for the night. The troops marching south had already camped nearby, leaving the village depleted of resources. Luckily, they had a week's worth of provisions with them: bread, black sausage, cheese, onions, garlic, and capsicums. The innkeeper provided a cooking pot, and they made a stew. The mules grazed in the plain as the village's forage was taken by the French column. The next day, they veered off the road for sixteen hours, rejoining it at the foot of the pass of Bejar. They learned they had outpaced the French troops. They hurried to Banos, mostly deserted due to the harsh requisitions. The innkeeper stayed put, as officers exempted him from demands.

Ryan was imprisoned in the city's heart, given comfortable quarters but with slim chances of escape due to the barred window and a sentry at his door. Terence regretted not accepting the general's offer to give his parole. A British officer, likely Ryan, had been captured by French dragoons. Terence planned to rescue Ryan, sending his lieutenant, Leon Gonzales, to gather information and devise an escape plan. The force moved to new positions, leaving 500 guerillas and Portuguese soldiers behind. Terence and Moras's guerillas positioned themselves in the mountains, ambushing convoys and acquiring supplies and ammunition. The plan was to disrupt French communication and gather resources for their troops.|"['1.

The supplies and wine were plentiful for the troops. Half the funds were saved for future use, divided between Moras and the Minho regiment. The rest was shared as rewards among the soldiers, with a portion sent to Herrara. The band's actions caused trouble for the French, blocking their main route between Burgos and Valladolid. French convoys needed heavy protection. Attempts to attack the guerillas failed due to their knowledge of French movements. The guerillas stored supplies in hidden spots to avoid losses. Cold weather posed a challenge, forcing them to retreat from the hills. Communication with Herrara revealed French strength in Salamanca. In prison, Dick Ryan awaited rescue efforts from Terence, noticing a change in guards. A note found in his bread hinted at a possible escape plan orchestrated by Terence.|['1.

Terence was working when he received a special loaf of bread that hinted at an escape plan. Despite the strict surveillance in the prison, he believed Terence would find a way to help him escape. Following the instructions hidden in the bread, he discovered a saw to cut through the bars of his window. With the help of friends outside, a plan was set in motion. However, the first attempt failed. Yet, after a fortnight, a mysterious figure arrived in the dead of night to lead him out.

Ryan quickly retrieved the saw, lubricated it with oil, and located a small notch by running his finger along the metal bar. With precise cuts, he effortlessly sawed through the bar that was already partially severed. Within minutes, he had completed the task. Moving a bit higher, he found another mark and repeated the process smoothly. Handing the removed piece to a man, Ryan peeked out through the hole, hearing the distant footsteps of two sentries. After a brief exchange below, a voice guided him across the street to a grand house, where he was introduced to Alonzo Santobel, an advocate and friend of Don Leon Gonzales. They shared a drink and a smoke as Ryan learned about the intricate plan to aid a prisoner, facilitated by inside connections and careful negotiations.|"['1.

After a long conversation, Ryan and Gonzales decided to rest for a few hours in the room while their host retired to his bed. Ryan stayed at Don Alonzo Santobel's flat for four days. Meanwhile, Gonzales left early to avoid the commotion caused by the prisoner's escape. The town was in chaos, with soldiers being assassinated and a prisoner being released. To avoid suspicion, Ryan was disguised as a servant and instructed not to open the door to visitors. The French conducted searches, but Leon's group managed to leave the town unnoticed. Ryan followed a careful plan to leave the city disguised as a peasant, carrying a uniform hidden in a basket. Leon met him at a farmhouse, and they set off on a night journey to avoid detection by the French troops stationed in the area.|"[""1.

When the morning arrived, they found themselves just five miles away from the Douro River. They decided to spend the day in a nearby wood to avoid any French troops stationed along the river. Dressed as countrymen, Leon ventured to a hamlet in the afternoon, learning that 2000 French soldiers were camped at a village near Miranda's bridge. A peasant offered to guide them to a hidden ford, unknown to the French, which could be crossed by swimming their horses a short distance. After resting and consuming their provisions, they were prepared to depart when their guide arrived. The information was accurate, and they safely crossed the ford, arriving in Miranda.

Let's look at the maps now. We plan to turn the blockade of Ciudad into a siege promptly. We aim to capture it before the enemy can come with enough troops to help. The enemy would gather forces from Salamanca, Zamora, and Valladolid, and might receive more soldiers from Madrid and Estremadura. We need to figure out ways to delay some of these troops. We could blow up bridges or send a regiment to hold a strategic point for a day or two, slowing down the enemy's advance. Even a short delay could be crucial. This information will be essential if we decide to besiege Ciudad. Napoleon's focus on a campaign in Russia might create an opportunity for us to strike. Colonel O'Connor will prepare to march to the river Aqueda and secure the area to prevent any communication between Ciudad and Salamanca. The army is gearing up to besiege Ciudad, and secrecy is key to our strategy.|"['1.

"""Yes, colonel. We march tomorrow morning. I daresay you will hear of us before many days are over; and may, perhaps, be able to make even a closer guess than O'Grady as to what we are doing. I am heartily glad that we are off. We are now at our full strength again. Most of the wounded have rejoined, and I could have filled up the vacancies a dozen times over. The Portuguese know that I always manage to get food for my men, somehow; which is more than can be said for the other Portuguese regiments, though those of Trant and Pack are better off than Beresford's regulars. Then, too, I think they like fighting, now that they feel that they are a match for the French, man for man. They get a fair share of it, at any rate. The three months that we have been idle have been useful, as the new recruits know their work as well as the others.""

""That is a comfort, Terence. But, my dear boy, have a little pity on us and don't finish off the business by yourselves.

The attack was a success with the small garrison falling to the assailants. The Portuguese regiment, led by Colonel Elder, faced heavy fire from French forts but managed to build a 600-yard parallel before dawn. Over the next days, the troops worked tirelessly under continuous French artillery fire. By the 13th, the convent of Santa Cruz was taken, and by the 14th, the assault on the town began. Despite strong French defenses, breaches were made in the ramparts by the 19th. Terence received orders to join the assault, with divisions strategically attacking various points.

Wellington and his staff failed to maintain order in the town after the assault, leading to chaos. The Portuguese, fueled by animosity towards the Spaniards, also resorted to looting and setting fires. Amid the horror, the French held the castle, adding to the tense situation. Terence, realizing the need for protection, divided his men into two groups to safeguard two houses. They barricaded the doors and windows with furniture, prepared to defend themselves at any cost. The plan was to show a strong front to deter attackers. The Count de Montego welcomed the protection, offering his assistance.

The count swiftly instructed his servants to follow the British officer's guidance. They began securing heavy furniture against the doors while the count reassured his family upstairs. Terence and his companions introduced themselves to the count's family and then stationed themselves on the balcony. Despite Terence's warnings, the unruly soldiers, fueled by alcohol, continued their aggressive behavior. Shots were fired, and one man attempted to break down the door. Terence, with a steady hand, fired back, successfully defending the house. Despite his efforts to reason with the soldiers, they persisted in their attack.

Help was on the way. A Portuguese officer arrived with twenty-four men he had gathered. Soon, three hundred sober and ashamed men were assembled. They were given instructions to improve their image. Half were to position at windows without loading guns, ready to point down when ordered. The others were to clear the hall and wait to pour out into the street under Captain Ryan's command, using bayonets if needed. The crowd of soldiers outside was warned to disperse in two minutes or face consequences. When they refused, soldiers inside appeared at the windows, armed, while others poured out into the street, forming defensive lines.

In just thirty minutes, over fifteen hundred men were gathered. Two lines, each with a hundred soldiers, were positioned across the street, eighty yards apart. The remaining troops stood together in the center. Terence directed that if they were attacked, half of them should take shelter in the nearby houses and man the windows. The sight of this strong force deterred the rioters, who were too disorganized due to drunkenness. The soldiers retreated upon seeing the troops and English officers. An hour later, a mounted officer arrived with a small group. Terence had stationed himself on a balcony overseeing the street and quickly descended to meet them. The officer commended Terence's actions and decided to lead the regiment to restore order, ensuring only the leading company carried loaded weapons.

Colonel O'Connor divided the regiment into four columns, each led by a group of officers. This strategic move aimed to reduce resistance among the soldiers by having their comrades and officers present. Any soldiers who disobeyed orders were to be taken prisoner, and those who used force were to be shot immediately. Drunken soldiers were to be detained and guarded. After a few soldiers resisted and were dealt with, the columns dispersed in different directions. Lord Wellington arrived, reorganized the regiments, and addressed the troops.

The money was to be counted and distributed among those in need, while the rest of the items were to be displayed for rightful owners to claim.

In the following three months, not much significant action took place. The army's discipline had worsened due to the soldiers' unchecked behavior after capturing two fortresses. Lord Wellington expressed his frustration in letters about the troops' disobedience and misconduct towards the locals. In May, heavy rains halted movement, but General Hill's surprise capture of Almaraz was a remarkable feat. Wellington advanced towards Salamanca, crossing the river and engaging the French. The Minho regiment and British forces made strategic moves. The siege of the forts began, with insufficient artillery. Marmont's arrival with reinforcements prompted the British to withdraw and prepare for battle. After intense fighting and fire exchanges, the French retreated across the Douro River. Terence, accompanied by Ryan, sought Nita in Salamanca, finding her safe but away from home due to the unrest.|"[""1. What was a significant event during the three months described in the text?\nA.

In a strategic move to engage the British forces, the French attacked the village of Arapiles, leading to a fierce battle. Marmont's impatience to prevent Wellington's escape backfired as Maucune's division was left vulnerable due to a gap between his troops and Marmont's. Sensing an opportunity, Wellington swiftly organized his troops, with the 3rd division blocking Maucune's advance and the main line attacking his flank. As chaos ensued among the French ranks, Marmont suffered severe injuries, disrupting their command. The British forces, led by Pakenham, launched a relentless assault, overwhelming the French with artillery and cavalry support. Despite brave French resistance, the British forces proved unstoppable, capturing prisoners and scattering Maucune's divisions.
