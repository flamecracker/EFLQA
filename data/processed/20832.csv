All the Camp Fire Girls gathered to discuss a serious matter. Katherine, after a bit of a rocky start, addressed the group regarding a troubled young boy named Glen Irving. Mrs. Hutchins, his guardian, discovered that the people caring for Glen were neglecting him despite receiving a substantial yearly sum for his well-being and education. Glen's father, before his passing, entrusted his care to his uncle and aunt, who have not provided him with the care and education he deserves. Mrs. Hutchins is concerned and wants to investigate the situation to ensure Glen's welfare. Katherine highlighted the importance of the issue and sought the support of the Camp Fire Girls to address this matter of neglect and ensure that Glen receives the care and attention he deserves.|"['Question 1: What is the main topic of discussion among the Camp Fire Girls?\nA) Camping adventures\nB) Fundraising for charity\nC) Neglect of a troubled boy named Glen Irving\nD) School projects\nE) Cooking recipes', ""Question 2: Who is the guardian of Glen Irving?\nA) Katherine\nB) Mrs. Hutchins\nC) Glen's father\nD) Uncle and aunt\nE) Camp Fire Girls"", ""Question 3: What prompted the Camp Fire Girls to gather and discuss the serious matter?\nA) A birthday celebration\nB) A sports event\nC) A camping trip\nD) Katherine's address about Glen Irving\nE) A talent show"", ""Question 4: What did Glen's father entrust to his uncle and aunt before his passing?\nA) His car\nB) His house\nC) His savings\nD) His care\nE) His pet dog"", 'Question 5: What is Mrs. Hutchins concerned about regarding Glen Irving?\nA) His grades in school\nB) His lack of friends\nC) His neglected well-being and education\nD) His favorite hobbies\nE) His upcoming birthday party', ""Question 6: What is Katherine seeking from the Camp Fire Girls regarding Glen Irving's situation?\nA) Financial donations\nB) Moral support\nC) Cooking tips\nD) Camping gear\nE) Gardening advice""]"|"['C) Neglect of a troubled boy named Glen Irving', 'B) Mrs. Hutchins', ""D) Katherine's address about Glen Irving"", 'D) His care', 'C) His neglected well-being and education', 'B) Moral support']"
Mrs. Hutchins discussed with Miss Ladd and me about a plan. She suggested that we visit where Glen lives to see how he is treated. Mrs. Hutchins believes we are capable and wants us to investigate. She will cover all expenses for our trip. The family Glen lives with, the Grahams, live in Baltimore. They rent an expensive apartment and rely on money from Mrs. Hutchins. Despite Mr. Graham's modest salary, they seem to live luxuriously. Mrs. Graham appears to control the family's finances. They even own a summer cottage at Twin Lakes. Our task is to visit Twin Lakes, observe the Grahams, and report back to Mrs. Hutchins. She will cover all costs and provide assistance for our camp. It's an intriguing opportunity.|"['1.

The girls were quick to respond to the discussion. Azalia Atwood praised Mrs. Hutchins' idea, calling it romantic and exciting.

Despite the hour-long discussion and a unanimous vote in favor of Mrs. Hutchins' proposal, Ruth Hazelton wondered how they could earn honors from the mission. Helen added a humorous touch, comparing their investigation to spying for jam thieves. Hazel Edwards returned with yarn for their knitting project, expressing excitement for the upcoming adventure.

Miss Ladd, the Guardian of Flamingo Camp Fire, gathered with thirteen girls and one young woman in a parlor car, setting off for Twin Lakes. The group embarked on a secret mission, testing the girls' abilities to remain discreet. Miss Ladd emphasized the importance of not discussing their true purpose during the journey. She warned against dropping any hints that could arouse suspicion. The girls were instructed to act as if they were on a simple pleasure trip, avoiding any conversations that might reveal their true intentions. Marie Crismore playfully declared her determination to be a skilled detective, while Miss Ladd stressed the need for caution and secrecy.

On the train, the Camp Fire Girls were busy knitting warm clothing for the boys at the front. They kept their mission a secret as instructed by Miss Ladd. However, their peace was disrupted when a telegram warned about a suspicious man named Pierce Langford on the train. The girls remained vigilant, observing Langford's every move. When he disappeared into the observation car, Katherine and Hazel followed him discreetly, suspecting his intentions. Inside, they found Langford pretending to be asleep, but his actions raised their suspicions. The girls, with a sense of determination, kept a close eye on Langford, ready to uncover any potential threat he might pose to them.|"['1.

"The three girls were certain that all this was just pretend, but they didn't show it to each other. Langford, peeking through his eyewinkers, seemed puzzled by their behavior. It was a game of spy on both sides during most of the journey, with mysterious results. The train reached Twin Lakes at sundown, but the girls found no evidence of the ""squint-eyed man's"" purpose. At the hotel, Flamingo Camp Fire prepared for rest without discussing their visit or the mysterious passenger. Miss Ladd whispered to Katherine about being cautious around the man. The next morning, they had breakfast, and Langford tried to be friendly with the waitress. The girls ignored him and went for a walk in their hiking gear."|"[""Question 1:\nWhat was Langford's reaction to the girls' behavior during the journey?\nA) He was amused\nB) He was puzzled\nC) He was scared\nD) He was angry\nE) He was indifferent"", ""Question 2:\nWhat did the girls do upon reaching Twin Lakes at sundown?\nA) They found evidence of the man's purpose\nB) They went for a swim\nC) They discussed their visit\nD) They ignored Langford\nE) They prepared for rest"", 'Question 3:\nHow did Flamingo Camp Fire behave at the hotel?\nA) They discussed their visit\nB) They prepared for rest\nC) They ignored Langford\nD) They confronted the man\nE) They played a game', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Miss Ladd warn Katherine about?\nA) Being friendly with the man\nB) Being cautious around the man\nC) Ignoring Langford\nD) Going for a walk\nE) Discussing their visit', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Langford try to do during breakfast the next morning?\nA) Be friendly with the waitress\nB) Ignore the girls\nC) Leave the hotel\nD) Spy on the girls\nE) Confront the man', ""Question 6:\nHow did the girls react to Langford's attempt to be friendly?\nA) They ignored him\nB) They confronted him\nC) They joined him for breakfast\nD) They went for a walk\nE) They discussed their visit""]"|"['B) He was puzzled', ""A) They found no evidence of the man's purpose"", 'B) They prepared for rest', 'B) Being cautious around the man', 'A) Be friendly with the waitress', 'A) They ignored him']"
Miss Ladd gathered the girls for a secret meeting on a grassy knoll near the lake, ensuring privacy under the shade of oak and butternut trees. She explained the advantage of being watched by Langford, suspecting he was sent to block their investigation. Hazel astutely pointed out that Langford's presence confirms Aunt Hannah's suspicions about mistreatment. Miss Ladd praised Hazel's clarity in understanding the situation. She emphasized the importance of Langford's actions, like requesting a room next to them, revealing his true intentions. Despite Langford's attempts to feign disinterest, his keen curiosity betrays him. The girls were urged to remain cautious and observant as they continued their mission.|"[""1.

Two important points need to be made before we continue. First, it's crucial that each of you act as if Langford is of no importance, treating him like any other tourist. Don't exaggerate; just genuinely believe he's insignificant and behave accordingly without forcing it. The key is to forget our mission when he's near. Miss Ladd then assigns Katherine and Hazel as spies to map the enemy's fortifications discreetly. She warns them not to get caught, advising them to stay calm and avoid raising suspicion. The girls propose a plan where they each have specific tasks and earn honors for completing them successfully. Miss Ladd approves and suggests the tasks can earn them beads. She appoints them as scouts and plans to confirm it at the next Camp Fire meeting. The girls are to cleverly gather the needed information. Miss Ladd praises their ideas and decides to let them proceed independently while the group enjoys other activities back at the hotel.|"[""1.

"Katherine and Hazel hurried back to the hotel and decided not to search for the Grahams' address there. Instead, they went to a drug store on the main street. The other girls waited at the hotel while Katherine and Hazel went to get some picture postcards. They returned with the postcards and an address written by Katherine. Miss Ladd approved their plan to take a motorboat to Stony Point. Katherine and Hazel then hired an automobile for a drive. They set off on a road that led to Stony Point, an area of interest in their vacation plans at Fairberry. Twin Lakes, a summer-resort town with a population of about 2,500, sits near two lakes connected by a narrow river. The road they took was scenic, passing through forests and cottages along the lake. At Stony Point, they found a cluster of cottages and a hotel called ""The Hemlocks."" They were curious to find the Graham cottage without openly asking.

We have two hours to gather the information we need unless we want to share the credit with the other girls."" The girls decided to head towards the macadam highway from the Point. They walked northward along the road by the lake, passing rustic cottages nestled among trees and bushes. Suddenly, they heard sobbing coming from a nearby bush. They cautiously approached and found a frightened little boy. Despite their gentle words, the boy was scared. They wondered if he could be the missing boy they were searching for, despite his shabby appearance. Trying to calm him, a stylish girl appeared abruptly, looking determined to take the boy away."|"[""1.

"The boy stopped crying when he saw a new person approaching, his face turning pale with fear. The girl, who was heavily perfumed and stylishly dressed, seemed unfazed by his panic and forcefully pulled him out of his hiding spot. ""Is this any of your concern?"" she snapped at the person questioning her. ""He's my brother, and I can take him home without interference."" The captor and the frightened boy disappeared down a path, followed cautiously by two others, Katherine and Hazel. They observed from a distance, trying not to arouse suspicion.

Two girls, Katherine and Hazel, explored the area near a lake for a camping spot. They gathered information from a friendly woman named Mrs. Scott about the neighboring cottages. Mrs. Scott mentioned the owners of the nearby cottages and informed the girls that the land belonged to an estate managed by a man named Mr. Ferris. Excited about the potential camping locations, Katherine and Hazel decided to meet the boat and discuss their findings with the other girls. They planned to seek permission from Mr. Ferris to camp on the land. As they walked back, they encountered Attorney Langford, a lawyer from Fairberry, in a car. Hazel couldn't resist sneaking a glance back at the car, feeling regretful afterward for potentially causing trouble.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Katherine and Hazel gather information about from Mrs. Scott?\nA) Fishing spots\nB) Neighboring cottages\nC) Hiking trails\nD) Local restaurants\nE) Bird watching locations', 'Question 2:\nWho manages the estate where the land near the lake belongs to?\nA) Mr. Scott\nB) Mrs. Langford\nC) Mr. Ferris\nD) Mrs. Ferris\nE) Mrs. Scott', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Katherine and Hazel plan to do after gathering information about the potential camping spots?\nA) Leave the area immediately\nB) Explore the lake\nC) Meet the boat\nD) Visit a nearby town\nE) Go fishing', 'Question 4:\nWho did Katherine and Hazel plan to seek permission from to camp on the land?\nA) Mrs. Scott\nB) Attorney Langford\nC) Mr. Ferris\nD) The other girls\nE) Mrs. Ferris', ""Question 5:\nHow did Hazel feel after sneaking a glance back at Attorney Langford's car?\nA) Excited\nB) Regretful\nC) Relieved\nD) Curious\nE) Indifferent"", 'Question 6:\nWho did Katherine and Hazel encounter on their way back from exploring the area near the lake?\nA) Mrs. Scott\nB) Mr. Ferris\nC) Mrs. Langford\nD) Attorney Langford\nE) The other girls']"|['B) Neighboring cottages', 'C) Mr. Ferris', 'C) Meet the boat', 'C) Mr. Ferris', 'B) Regretful', 'D) Attorney Langford']
Katherine reassured Hazel not to worry about someone jumping to conclusions just because they looked back. She suggested that appearing uneasy might give away their plans. Hazel disagreed, believing suspicion was their biggest threat. She thought the man might have followed them out of curiosity. Katherine found it odd that Aunt Hannah had chosen a group of girls for such an important task. Hazel defended their selection, stating it wasn't strange for a group like theirs. They joked about acting nonsensically to throw off Mr. Langford. They planned to keep him guessing by sharing ideas subtly. As they waited at the water's edge, they saw their friends approaching in a motorboat. Both girls were eager to see who was on board without giving away their presence.|"['1.

Arriving at Twin Lakes, Katherine and Hazel promptly visited Mr. Ferris at the real estate office to seek permission to set up camp.

The group reconvened after thirty minutes to share their findings. Marion Stanlock and Harriet Newcomb's report stood out as the most captivating. They discovered a charming spot halfway up the hillside, shielded by a bluff and surrounded by trees and bushes, providing excellent protection from storms. The area was spacious enough for all the tents. After a unanimous vote, they decided to set up camp there. The girls, with the help of the pilot and a boy, swiftly transported their gear to the site. They worked efficiently to set up the tents and organize the camp, skipping a proper lunch in their eagerness. In the evening, they enjoyed a hearty meal and relaxed by the fire, admiring the picturesque scenery.

During their hike, Katherine, Hazel, and Miss Ladd discussed plans to attract attention for their mission. Katherine's random suggestion of doing something sensational or lively to draw interest was met with approval. They decided to use poles to test the water's depth and ensure safe swimming spots. After gathering long poles, they checked the water along the shore. Finding a suitable place, Azalia, a skilled swimmer, tied a rope around her waist while the others held it. With caution, she ventured into the water. This careful approach was necessary as Flamingo Camp Fire rules mandated safety measures even for strong swimmers. The group's new plan was met with enthusiasm by the other girls and became the main topic of conversation during their return to camp for lunch.|"['1.

The Camp Fire Girls at Flamingo Lake had an eventful day. Miss Ladd's keen observation sparked excitement among the girls, leading to plans for a bonfire. After a tiring afternoon, they rested under the shade until some revived the bonfire idea to ward off mosquitoes. The girls sang Camp Fire songs and patriotic tunes by the fire, enjoying the warm atmosphere. As night fell, a sudden scare with a falling object caused chaos, but the girls quickly extinguished the fire and returned to their tents.

Using the boat this time made the task much easier. Instead of the challenging stake-driving, they rowed out to where the southwest stake was needed. Two girls got in the water, while the third steadied the boat as they secured the stake. After finishing, they enjoyed a swim. Returning to camp for lunch, they discussed setting up a night watch for protection. Miss Ladd encouraged them not to underestimate themselves and taught them how to make a catapult for defense. The girls then quietly prepared for any potential nighttime intruders."|"['1.

In a short while, they delved into the dense woods, scouting for Y-shaped branches to fashion into catapult handles. Thirty minutes later, they returned with a dozen handles of various shapes and qualities. The task of constructing these miniature war machines commenced. Some girls displayed adept mechanical prowess, while others' attempts sparked laughter with their clumsy efforts. Marie, amidst the merriment, defended her sewing skills, comparing them to a boy's mishap at a button-sewing contest. After crafting several catapults, the girls honed their stone-slinging skills, determining who excelled. Following Miss Ladd's suggestion, they fashioned slings to carry stones for hand throwing and catapult use. Stones were collected from the beach and stored in the slings. Night watch duties were assigned, with four scouts embarking on a special mission. As darkness enveloped the camp, the remaining girls conversed around a fire, prepared for any unforeseen events.|"['1.

"The night was calm and clear, without a moon in the sky. The air was so quiet that even a dog might have felt lonely and howled. While the scouts waited near the Graham house, they heard a mournful howl from a distant farmyard. As they cautiously approached the house, they heard a muffled cry that sounded like a child's voice. Peeking through a window, they saw Mrs. Graham and her son, ""Jimmie Junior,"" in the house. Mrs. Graham seemed upset by the sound of crying from another room. She quickly opened a closet door, revealing a shocking sight that angered the scouts. They watched in disbelief as Mrs. Graham's actions unfolded, determined to uncover the mystery."|"['1.

Little Glen was tied tightly to a chair, tears streaming down his face, in a scene of distress. A woman held a leather strap, striking him twice on his bare legs. Hazel and Katherine were appalled, ready to intervene until a disturbance interrupted. A man entered, cutting the rope that bound Glen. As he released the boy, he made it clear he acted out of self-preservation, not sympathy. He revealed his failed attempt to frighten a group of girls, resulting in a head injury. Despite Mrs. Graham's lack of concern, he requested aid for his injury. The man's encounter with the girls had left him in pain, emphasizing the importance of first aid and care for both the injured boy and himself.|"[""1.

Glen followed a suggestion and moved to another room while Mrs. Graham and the lawyer returned to the living room. Katherine and Hazel observed for about twenty minutes but heard little conversation. Langford left, and Mrs. Graham and her son prepared to retire. Since no more useful information seemed available, the group returned to camp. Early the next day, Miss Ladd, Katherine, and Hazel went by boat to Twin Lakes. They appeared before a magistrate and swore out a warrant for Mrs. Graham's arrest on charges of mistreating a child. Mrs. Hutchins was summoned urgently. Upon her arrival, Mrs. Graham was arrested, and Glen was placed under court protection. Mrs. Graham, faced with the charges and evidence, agreed to Mrs. Hutchins' terms. The group spent a week at Stony Point camp, then returned to Fairberry to wrap up their achievements and honors. More adventures awaited in the future volumes of the series.|"['1.
