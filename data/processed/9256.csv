Pandora stood staring at the box, pondering its contents. Epimetheus had left to gather fruits, tired of hearing about the box. Pandora thought it might contain lovely things like dresses for her or toys to play with. She recalled the messenger, Quicksilver, who had a distinct staff and had delivered the box.

The container, almost overlooked, was secured not by a lock, but by a complex knot of gold cord. The knot seemed endless, with no clear start or finish. It was so intricately woven that it defied even the most skilled hands to unravel it. Despite the challenge, Pandora was tempted to inspect the knot and figure out its construction. She contemplated undoing it but hesitated, thinking she could retie it without opening the box. Pandora's mind was consumed by this task, as children in those peaceful times had too much free time. With no chores, except minor cleaning and flower arranging, Pandora's thoughts were fixated on the box.
