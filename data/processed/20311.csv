Flossie and Freddie were sent to bed earlier than Nan and Bert, who were allowed to stay up a bit longer. The talk was all about the gypsies and what they might have taken. Nan and Bert were preparing for bed when they heard footsteps on the stairs. A voice called out for Flossie and Freddie, who were being called by their father and Bert to join them the next morning to search for the gypsy camp. The night passed peacefully, and Snap and Snoop were found safe at dawn. After breakfast, Mr. Bobbsey and Bert were planning to head to Lake Metoka to locate where the gypsies had parked their colorful wagons. They were hoping to find Helen's doll and other missing items. Freddie expressed his readiness to scare off the gypsies with his fire engine and bugs from New York. Mrs. Bobbsey assured him that they would be safe with their father. Bert and Mr. Bobbsey, accompanied by a policeman, made their way to the gypsy camp. The policeman, Joseph Carr, dressed inconspicuously to avoid alerting the gypsies. They reached the woods where the gypsies were camped, encountering the wagons, horses, and dogs. The gypsies were not welcoming, and the dogs growled, prompting the gypsy man to send them away.|['1.

The police, Mr. Bobbsey, and Bert searched the gypsy camp for the missing doll, but found no trace. Mr. Carr mentioned that two horses were missing, possibly taken by the gypsies. They roamed the camp, but the doll was not found. The gypsies were forced to leave due to complaints about stolen chickens. Flossie, Freddie, and Helen were upset about the lost doll. The gypsies left, but the worry lingered. The Bobbsey twins promised to help Helen find the doll. The gypsies threatened revenge for being driven away. The Bobbsey family received a postal card regarding something in New York. The children eagerly awaited news about a goat that their father had bought for them. Mrs. Bobbsey humorously remarked on managing their large family. Mr. Bobbsey revealed the surprise goat waiting at the express office.|"['1.

Mr. Bobbsey, along with the children, headed to the express office from his lumberyard. The kids were excited about the idea of all fitting into the wagon pulled by a white goat named Whisker. The goat seemed gentle as Flossie and Freddie patted him. After some preparations, Bert harnessed Whisker to the wagon, and the children set off for a ride. Whisker happily pulled the full wagon around the yard, delighting the Bobbsey twins and their friends. The goat was so well-behaved that even Freddie got a chance to drive. One day, as they ventured near the woods, a new adventure began.|"['1. What is the name of the white goat that pulls the wagon?\nA) Fluffy\nB) Whisker\nC) Snowball\nD) Daisy\nE) Rocky', '2.

Whisker, the large white goat, seemed to have a plan as he led the two youngest Bobbsey twins and Helen Porter to the forest in search of a lost doll. The goat confidently pulled the wagon with the children, navigating the rough woodland path. Despite the bumps and obstacles, Whisker continued on, occasionally stopping to nibble on leaves or grass. Freddie, holding the reins like a seasoned driver, guided Whisker along the way. The children, hoping to find the missing doll left by the gypsies, searched under trees and bushes. As they called out for the doll, they were startled by a faint response. However, it turned out to be Bert, who had been searching for them. Relieved, Bert guided the children back home, puzzled by their unexpected adventure in the woods.|"['1.

Bert explained that their family was planning a camping trip on one of the islands in Lake Metoka. While at the lumberyard, Bert overheard his dad discussing the best island for camping. Freddie, munching on a forgotten cracker, listened as Mrs. Bobbsey reminded them not to repeat mischievous acts. Mrs. Bobbsey chuckled about the upcoming island adventure and arranged a lunch for the children. The Bobbseys were preparing for a summer camp on Blueberry Island. Mr. Bobbsey had purchased tents, and they were eager to sail to the island. The family was excited for the summer vacation, anticipating the fun on the island.

"Freddie exclaimed, ""I can whistle just like that!"" as he let go of the black cat, leaving poor Snoop hanging upside down by his hind legs. Dinah, the cook, responded, ""I didn't see your dog chasing the peddler, honey lamb. But a woman in a fancy red and yellow dress came by earlier selling lace. She petted Snap, and he seemed to like her."" Mrs. Bobbsey cautioned, ""Maybe the woman was a gypsy, but let's not jump to conclusions. Snap might have just followed her out of curiosity.""

The Bobbsey family was camping when they heard noises outside their tent. Mr. Bobbsey, who loved animals like his children, comforted the goat. Later, Mrs. Bobbsey asked Mr. Bobbsey if he saw anything. The children were moved closer to their parents' cots for safety. The family settled back to sleep after a drink of water. The next morning, Mr. Bobbsey planned to investigate the disturbance. They enjoyed a delicious breakfast prepared by Dinah. The family planned to go fishing, but they needed bait. Bert, Freddie, and Flossie dug for worms but had little luck. Freddie got distracted searching for his toys and found his toy bugs had escaped.

Mrs. Bobbsey rushed to Freddie's side, concerned about the commotion. Flossie explained that the tin bugs had escaped the box by knocking a hole and fleeing. Though upset, Mr. Bobbsey assured them he would get new toys if the bugs couldn't be found. The children soon forgot about the loss, joining Bert to dig for worms. Meanwhile, Bert and his parents examined the broken box. They speculated that someone might have accidentally stepped on it, allowing the bugs to escape. Mr. Bobbsey dismissed the idea of gypsies taking the bugs but acknowledged the possibility due to their vibrant colors.

The bacon had vanished mysteriously, leaving the cook, Dinah, puzzled. Mr. Bobbsey suggested a dog might have taken it, but Dinah suspected a human thief. Mrs. Bobbsey redirected the conversation, deciding the missing bacon wasn't a big concern. Bert then asked Dinah about a strange noise at night, but she hadn't heard it.

Bert, not afraid, planned to keep a close eye on the twins with Nan and the cook. They vowed to protect Flossie and Freddie from the gypsies. Bert even suggested using their pet, Whisker, as a watchdog. Excited and worried about recent events, Bert stressed the need to watch over the little ones. Despite the potential danger, Bert and Nan took Flossie and Freddie fishing, staying close to shore. The children enjoyed fishing while being cautious of gypsies. The family had fun playing and exploring the island, free from any further scares. Bert remained vigilant, knowing the gypsies might return. A week later, all four twins went for a ride in a goat wagon along the island's road.|"['1.

The twins had their lunch and decided to picnic in the woods. They rode under the green trees, picked flowers, and Nan made a wreath for Whisker's horns. As they settled near a spring, Freddie took a bite of his sandwich when a noise from the bushes startled him. A blue-faced boy emerged, explaining he was hungry after berry picking. Tom Turner, the boy, shared that his family picked blueberries in Freedon each year. Despite his ragged appearance, the twins found Tom kind. Tom mentioned his father worked for the Bobbsey lumberyard, surprising the twins who never expected to meet someone from their town while having a picnic.|"['1.

Tom shared a story about a man who had worked in a circus, mentioning the hard work and strict rules. Meanwhile, the Bobbsey twins learned about gypsies on the island who were known for picking blueberries. Curious, Nan asked if the gypsies were still there, expressing some concern. Tom confirmed their presence, having seen them recently. As Tom rowed away, Mr. Bobbsey expressed his reservations about the gypsies camping on the island. Despite keeping a watch, no gypsies were spotted in the following days, and the blueberries were not yet ripe. Flossie warned Freddie about wading too far as he headed towards a boat blown close to the shore by the wind.|['1.

Freddie had scars on his legs from past accidents, like a wavy scar near his knee from a cut by a lawn mower. Flossie found a stick to pull their boat ashore. They pretended to sail to New York, then realized they were using someone else's boat. The twins knew about boats and water safety, being near Lake Metoka. They were cautious, not going too far and planning to return the boat to its owner. They figured the blueberry boy must have forgotten to secure his boat properly, just like they sometimes left their oars on shore.

Flossie and Freddie decided to use Freddie's jacket as a makeshift sail for their boat. As the wind picked up, they found themselves being blown closer to a mysterious cave on the island. Despite the rain and rough waves, the wind helped propel them towards the shore. Excited by the idea of finding treasure in the cave, Freddie reassured Flossie and guided the boat to safety near the cave's entrance. The children, seeking shelter from the rain, held hands and bravely ventured into the dark cave, eager to explore what secrets it might hold.|"[""1.

Freddie and Flossie explored a cave on Blueberry Island, accessible by both land and water. The cave had an entrance for boats and a path through trees. Inside, the cave had a bay large enough for a few boats. As their eyes adjusted to the darkness, they realized the cave was quite spacious. Even though Freddie brought his popgun, he left it behind, and they found themselves in the dark without it. The storm outside intensified, with rain and thunder, but soon it calmed down. They noticed a boat blown into the cave, resting in a small cove. After the storm passed, they decided to leave the boat and walk back to their camp through the path.|"['1.

While playing hide-and-seek, Freddie, Flossie, and Helen found creative hiding spots. Freddie crouched behind brush-wood, Flossie nestled between logs, and Helen concealed herself in a hollow stump. As Freddie counted, the girls stayed hidden, eager not to give away their positions. However, Helen's discovery of a wet white dress distracted them from the game. Speculating that gypsies might have washed the dress, the children's focus shifted. Helen, holding up the dress she found, stood up in the stump, revealing herself.

The two young girls, with the help of Freddie, began searching for the lost doll around the stump. Despite their efforts, they couldn't find any trace of the doll. Flossie mentioned that the doll was wet from the rain, suggesting it might have been left out during a downpour. Mrs. Porter, upon inspecting the doll's dress, recognized it as one she had made for Helen when she was a baby. The family speculated that the doll might have been taken by gypsies who were seen on the island. Mr. Bobbsey believed the gypsies had likely taken the doll for a little girl in their group. The family decided to search the island thoroughly to find the missing doll. Later that evening, the family enjoyed a marshmallow roast by the campfire, toasting the sweets until they turned golden brown. The following day, due to rain, the twins couldn't search for the doll and had to stay near the tents. As the rain cleared, they went to the dock to welcome Mr. Bobbsey back from the mainland.

Bert made signs on paper with a pencil to find Snoop, the missing cat, tacking them on trees for the blueberry pickers. Despite Snap and Snoop being missing, the Bobbsey twins enjoyed camp. They played games, went on walks, and rowed to nearby islands. Fishing was good, and they had fun with Whisker, the gentle goat. Flossie and Freddie decided to search for Snoop quietly.

Freddie asked his sister to find a longer tree branch to help him out of the mud. His sister found one, holding one end for Freddie to grab onto while she held onto a small tree. The branch kept Flossie steady as Freddie pulled himself out of the sticky mud and onto the gravelly bottom of the brook. They used moss as a sponge to clean off the mud from Freddie's legs. Flossie's shoes and stockings got wet and muddy as well. After cleaning up, they continued searching for their lost cat. Mrs. Bobbsey advised them to think before acting next time.

The twins were shocked to discover that some people even made pies out of sparrows and cooked larger birds like robins and blackbirds over fires. Despite the net causing a mishap for one of the twins, they managed to enjoy their camping days on the island, picking blueberries and having fun with new toys.

The Bobbseys had been camping on the island for about a month. One day, Mrs. Bobbsey went to Lakeport with Nan and Bert for shopping, leaving Flossie and Freddie with their father. While Mr. Bobbsey rested and read a book, Flossie and Freddie wandered off to collect mussel shells. They strayed far from the camp, following a butterfly until they tumbled down a hole on a sandy hill. Though startled at first, they realized they were safe and helped each other up, shaking off the sand that had gotten into their clothes.

At the top, which felt very high to them, the twins spotted the hole they had fallen through. It was nestled between two large stones with bushes on either side, camouflaged by grass. As they tried to climb back up the sandy slope, they struggled to find a firm grip. Even on hands and knees, the sand slipped beneath them. Thirsty and tired, they longed to reach the top. Flossie imagined being Ali Baba to open the cave magically. In the dim cavern, they noticed a distant light, hoping it would guide them out. Startled by a strange noise, they clung to each other. As they called out, a lantern-carrying man approached, casting light on their fear-stricken faces.|['1.

"Nan suddenly shouted, ""Hark!"" The Bobbsey family, including Flossie and Freddie in the goat wagon drawn by Whisker, followed the police to the cave. They found their black cat, Snoop, either lost or stolen by gypsies. The family was relieved to have Snoop back, and Mrs. Bobbsey reminded them to take turns being happy instead of quarreling. They also discovered that the gypsies had taken their dog, cat, bacon, and Helen's doll. Despite the gypsies leaving, the mystery of how Helen's doll ended up in the cave remained unsolved.
