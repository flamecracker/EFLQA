Jack hurried to his room and changed into a dry suit. Feeling overwhelmed by the news he had received, he decided to ride the pony Mrs. Ruthven had given him.

The group of three, including Jack, quickly acted on the plan to surprise the guerrillas. Jack disarmed one while Old Ben subdued him. As the storm raged with lightning and thunder, they trudged through the dark, wet forest. Jack, soaked and shivering, followed Old Ben's lead. Seeking shelter in a cabin, they hid from Dr. Mackey and St. John, overhearing their suspicious conversation about Jack's heritage and possessions. Old Ben kept a watchful eye on the doctor, ready to act. The group then headed towards Ruthven plantation, with Jack learning a shocking revelation about his true lineage.

"""Your father is resting now,"" Mrs. Ruthven explained. ""He's better but still a bit weak. You can see him when he wakes up. It's best to keep Dr. Mackey's capture a secret for now."" After discussing, Dr. Mackey was taken to a garret room and securely tied to a heavy bedpost. Old Ben was stationed to guard him. ""You've been caught, St. John,"" Mrs. Ruthven confronted him. ""Stay away from here. You tried to steal from me, but you won't succeed."" St. John decided not to press charges for now, considering the man's poor health. Eventually, he left with his companions, never to return. The next day, there was a fierce battle in the mountains, resulting in the death of many outlaws, including those who had held Jack captive. The outlaws' camp was searched, revealing stolen goods and a tin box from the shipwreck. Colonel Stanton recovered slowly, and upon his return, he pursued Dr. Mackey, leading to his imprisonment and the recovery of a significant fortune for the Stantons. Colonel Stanton resigned and decided to stay on the plantation, eventually marrying Mrs. Ruthven. Their wedding coincided with Marion's marriage to Dr. Harry Powell. The double wedding was a lavish event, with St. John notably absent. St. John's financial downfall led to the loss of the plantation, forcing Mrs. Mary Ruthven to rely on"|"[""1.
