With the mask and the box hidden beneath her pillow, Mary waited until Joyce fell asleep. She cautiously sat up, scooped out the ointment, and spread it on her nose and cheeks. The smell was too sweet, and the mask made her feel hot and suffocated. She struggled to sleep, having unsettling dreams. Thirsty from salty beef, she crept to get water, seeing her reflection and getting scared. Startled by a crashing pitcher, she frightened Joyce. Throughout the night, her sleep was troubled, and her face burned. In the morning, she saw red blisters on her face, regretting using too much ointment.

"""Yes, you can, Mary,"" said Joyce, comfortingly. ""Mom has Grandma Ware's old recipe for rose balm, which will heal those blisters soon. You would have saved yourself trouble and suffering if you had gone to her first.""

""I know that!"" Mary snapped, then burst into tears. ""You don't know how it feels to be ugly like me! Mom said I was as brown as a squaw, and I couldn't bear Lloyd and Betty at The Locusts seeing me that way. That's why I did it!""

""You're not ugly, Mary,"" Joyce insisted. ""Not everyone can be a supermodel, and with a bright face like yours, you should be happy as you are.""

""That's easy for you to say,"" Mary replied bitterly. ""You're pretty, talented, and you'll be someone. But I'm just plain 'little Mary,' with no talents or anything!""

By the tea-house, the coachman worked on a barge under Malcolm's guidance, inspired by Tennyson's Lily Maid. Lloyd, playing Elaine, tested the bier's fit. Malcolm, as the servitor, prepared to row. Despite the makeshift boat and modern attire, the scene amused them. Miss Allison assured Malcolm that with props, he'd embody Methuselah, and Lloyd would shine. A planned reading would explain each scene. Mary, enthralled by the play, longed for the romance she imagined. Disappointed by Malcolm's playful demeanor, she sought the chivalry of Sir Feal.

The old servant rose, guiding the boat with the lifeless lady holding a lily and a letter. Her hair flowed as the gold coverlid draped her. She looked serene, almost alive, lying still. Mary paused her recital as the maids set tables under the beech-tree. Unsure of where to go, she read quietly. Elise was summoned for her dress fitting, Lloyd and Lieutenant Logan chatted, and Mary wished she had a role. She felt plain among the pretty girls. As the picnic began, Elise waved Mary over to her table, where she could see Lloyd and Phil nearby. Malcolm teased Lloyd about Tennyson's Lily Maid, and Mary imagined herself in such romantic scenes.

Mary listened attentively to the conversation at the outdoor picnic table. She blushed when the discussion turned to the character Elaine from a romantic poem. The men at the table found Elaine's actions silly and sentimental, prompting Mary to reconsider her own romantic ideals. The moonlit setting of the evening's outdoor entertainment added a magical touch to the night. Mary watched the tableaux unfold, feeling enchanted by the scene.

""How many girls of seventeen do you know who would take the trouble to go to their fathers with a trifle like that, and make a careful explanation about it?

There was no mistaking the deep tenderness of his voice or the earnestness of his question. Lloyd felt the blood surge up in her face and her heart throbbed so fast she could hear it beat. But she hastily thrust back the proffered turquoise, saying, in confusion:

As Betty finished writing, she noticed the clock striking, realizing she had been writing for an hour. The household was now awake, and she hurried to get ready for breakfast. Below the balcony, she saw Stuart and Doctor Bradford returning from a stroll. They gazed at Eugenia's balcony, where she stood in a pink morning dress, plucking a rosebud. Eugenia warned Stuart discreetly, then playfully tossed the rosebud to him. Betty, feeling guilty for witnessing the exchange, quickly retreated into her room. Soon after, the family gathered to admire the bride's cake, which had been iced in Louisville. Stuart jokingly urged someone to distract Phil, recalling a past incident with a birthday cake. Phil, in turn, playfully pushed Stuart away, hinting at hidden stories that might change Eugenia's mind about Stuart.|"[""1.

Lloyd insisted on being part of the wedding preparations and urged everyone to help find the four-leaf clovers for the dream-cake boxes. Mary explained that each guest would receive a heart-shaped box with cake and a clover to put under their pillow for three nights to make their dreams come true. Although they didn't truly believe in these superstitions, it was fun to follow the traditions. Rob Moore shared a story about Abdallah's quest for the lucky shamrock with leaves representing different elements, including Perfect Happiness that can only be found in Paradise.

In the story, Joyce and Lloyd discuss the pursuit of true happiness, inspired by an old legend. They debate whether perfect happiness can be achieved all the time, like finding a diamond leaf in Paradise. Lloyd challenges the idea, suggesting that times have changed. To illustrate his point, Phil sings a song about finding a place where four-leaf clovers grow, symbolizing hope, faith, love, and strength. The group then searches for four-leaf clovers in an orchard. Despite some skepticism, they realize that the legend and the song both emphasize the importance of effort, patience, and faith in finding true happiness.

Tremont, a wise and honorable hero, earned his golden leaf through selfless service and a life of integrity. His story inspired Betty and her friends to seek their own silver leaf by following the Tusitala rings and Hildegarde's motto. They believed that everyone deserved a chance at happiness, not just the youngest or luckiest. Phil playfully acknowledged the prince's role in bringing the diamond leaf, symbolizing perfect happiness. However, Eugenia raised a valid point about finding happiness even without the prince's arrival. The group discussed Mammy Eastah's fortune-telling teacup reading, hinting at the uncertainty of love and happiness. Rob shared examples of unhappy marriages, cautioning against relying solely on external factors for fulfillment.|"[""1.

Eugenia firmly disagreed, stating that Mrs. Deckly, Mrs. Twickett, Mrs. Grayson, and Mrs. Blackstone were not worthy examples like Hildegardes. They failed to earn their third leaf due to unwise decisions in their weaving. Joyce proposed that success could be the prince instead of a man, emphasizing the value of personal achievements. Betty believed that those who fulfill their responsibilities will find happiness, whether through marriage or other paths. Lloyd expressed her uncertainty about her future without a career or family responsibilities. Rob, offering support, promised to find a four-leaf clover to symbolize luck and protection.

"Lloyd glanced at the watch he extended to her. ""Hello, Bobby,"" she exclaimed, using the old name from their childhood days, ""I thought you lost this lucky charm long ago."" ""Not at all,"" he replied. ""It's the best good-luck charm ever. It got me through high school. I couldn't have passed Latin without it. It's really important for me to keep it."" Ignoring his attempts to engage her in conversation, she resumed searching for clovers, excited about a discovery she believed she had made. Satisfied with only two dozen clovers found, Eugenia suggested putting them in boxes randomly to add excitement. As they walked back to the house, they passed the kitchen where colored women were assisting Aunt Cindy. One of them called out to children watching decorators hang a gate of roses inside. The youngest child sat precariously on a barrel, causing a commotion when the barrel tipped over. Lloyd explained to Doctor Bradford that the children were drawn to parties and were there because their mother was helping in the kitchen.

Stuart called it the ""Gate into Paradise,"" leading to the altar adorned with white roses. Mrs. Sherman hoped for a peaceful wedding without last-minute chaos.

Lloyd then asked for Mary's help in finding a lost item, a scrap of unset turquoise. Mary eagerly agreed, and together they began searching through ribbons, laces, handkerchiefs, and sachet-bags.

In the quiet old mansion, as the upstairs lights flickered out, a deep silence enveloped The Locusts. The only sound was the steady tick-tock of the grand clock on the stairs. Suddenly, cries of distress pierced the peaceful night, jolting everyone awake. Lights flickered on, doors flew open, and a group rushed out, armed with various makeshift weapons. Amidst the chaos, Mary, trembling and sobbing, recounted a bizarre dream where she was forced into a cat-and-dog life by a mysterious man.

Some girls have a strange idea of friendship, being nice to your face but showing a different side behind your back. This behavior, like what Bernice has been doing lately, can be hurtful.

Rob expresses his frustration, preferring an open enemy over a fake friend. The discussion turns to Bernice's jealousy towards Lloyd. Rob suggests dropping a hint to Lloyd about Bernice's behavior, but Betty questions if Rob may be misinterpreting the situation.

As the bridal party made their way down the aisle, all heads turned to watch. M'haley, dressed in a pink chiffon gown from Paris, walked slowly, adorned with a sky-blue sash that covered any imperfections in the altered dress. Mimicking the maid of honor before her, she held a bouquet of flowers in the same precise manner. The flower girl, with a worried expression on her face, struggled to walk gracefully in high heels while tossing daisies every third step. Despite her difficulties, she made it to the altar without incident. Sylvia, the bride, followed with grandeur, wearing a lavender satin skirt and a makeshift silk waist.

At the sound of the organ, a couple descended the steps slowly. Ca'line Allison, eager to resume throwing posies, nearly tripped but quickly recovered. Following them was M'haley and a pompous minister. Lloyd noticed the bride's smile and decided to join the line.

She linked arms with Mary Ware to avoid a conversation with Phil. Walking four abreast, they navigated through buggies and wagons. Lloyd saw Kitty with Phil and felt relieved. As they reached the path through the woods, the group scrambled through. Lloyd was grateful when Alex Shelby helped her avoid a fall. The group chatted and joked as they walked, unaware of Bernice's silence. They parted ways at The Beeches, where Alex invited Lloyd for a horseback ride, causing a momentary awkwardness.
