The prince and the merchant were both embarrassed by the extravagant gifts exchanged. The prince decided to send a royal gift in return to prevent further gifts. The merchant hired an entourage to accompany the lavish caravan. Wali Dâd, a humble old man, mistook the caravan for a crowd coming to buy grass. When the merchant explained the gifts, Wali Dâd selflessly suggested keeping only a few animals and giving the rest to a princess who would appreciate them more. Reluctantly, the merchant agreed to deliver this message to the prince. The king of Khaistan, upon receiving the gifts, suspected Wali Dâd's intentions and decided to visit him with his daughter. The merchant, feeling trapped, accompanied the royal party, hoping for a way out of the predicament.|"['1.

When the merchant left, Wali Dâd felt overwhelmed with shame and distress from his foolishness. He decided the only way out was to end his life. In the dead of night, he went to a cliff by the river to jump. But as he stood at the edge, he couldn't do it. Terrified by the darkness and eerie sounds, he was about to give up. Suddenly, a gentle light appeared, revealing two beautiful beings. They transformed his rags into fine clothes, and his sickle into a jeweled scimitar. They led him through a gateway to a magnificent palace where he was left in awe. The next morning, the merchant, astonished by the transformation of the land, found Wali Dâd in the palace.

Once upon a time in a land of vast rivers and deep forests, where wild creatures roamed freely, a tortoise lived. This tortoise, known for his cleverness, embarked on adventures from a young age. One day, he encountered an elephant and challenged him to a strength test. Not long after, he met a whale and proposed the same challenge. Craftily, the tortoise tied a bone to both the elephant and the whale, pitting them against each other in a fierce tug of war. The unsuspecting opponents pulled with all their might, unaware that it was the tortoise orchestrating the contest. The battle raged on, with the elephant being dragged into the water by the whale and the whale being pulled onto land by the elephant.

Once upon a time, a clever tortoise challenged an elephant and a whale to a contest. After playing, the tortoise saw their exhaustion and suggested they call it a day. Later, the tortoise met a fox and proposed a competition of burying themselves for seven years. The tortoise easily tricked the fox into feeding him oranges while buried. In return, the tortoise buried the fox and promised to bring him birds for dinner. The tortoise became respected for his wisdom and strength in the forest. He even outsmarted a deer in a race by strategically placing his relatives along the course.

As the monkey made his way to his favorite palm tree in the forest, he encountered a woman scaling a fish with a piece of wood. He kindly offered her his razor to make the task easier. A few days later, the woman returned the razor to the monkey. Further along, he saw a baker eating a dry loaf and offered him a fish to accompany it. The baker gladly accepted. Days later, the monkey returned to collect his fish. He then came across a woman teaching little girls how to style hair. He gifted them a barrel of meal to make cakes. The children were thrilled and quickly baked and enjoyed the cakes. When the monkey revisited, he asked for his barrel back. Threatening to take a child if he didn't get it, he ended up taking the prettiest girl to his home in the palm tree. This caused animosity between the monkey and the puma, who had long wanted to trap the monkey. When a severe drought hit the forest, the puma saw his chance to capture the monkey as he came to drink from the last remaining pool. However, the monkey's quick reflexes saved him, and he escaped the puma's grasp.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a puma invited his friend, the stag, to visit a famous comrade known for his delicious milk. The stag, eager for a taste of milk, agreed to the journey. Along the way, they reached a river with no bridge, and the stag hesitated due to his fear of swimming. However, the puma encouraged him to cross. After a near-drowning experience, they continued their journey. The puma tricked the stag into climbing a tree to pick bananas, which turned out to be unappetizing. The puma then led the stag into trouble with men working in a field and a snake that bit him. Later, the puma framed the stag for eating a sheep, resulting in the stag's unfortunate demise.
