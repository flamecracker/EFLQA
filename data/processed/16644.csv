In 1638, on a warm May day, Goodwife Pepperell, a tall woman with blue eyes and a firm mouth, peered out from her log cabin. She scanned the meadow and the distant river, searching. Her eyes held a hint of worry as she gazed at the dense forest to the north, wary of its hidden dangers like wolves and Indians. She also observed the cornfields to the east and the view of Boston town across the bay. With no response to her calls, she resorted to the samp-mill, pounding corn into meal. A resounding thump echoed as she worked, prompting her children, a boy and a girl with English features, to appear. Proud but concealing it, she asked where they had been, upholding her Puritan beliefs.|"[""1.

Through the bushes, past young oak trees, and over stones, the children raced towards their cabin as a storm approached. Goodwife Pepperell anxiously watched for them, and as they burst in, soaked from the rain, her husband was taken aback.

"""We would be delighted to have you stay as long as you wish,"" the Goodwife warmly expressed. ""Place the lobsters in this container while I prepare the kettle to boil.""

More than ten days had passed, and the Goodman had not returned. The Captain had to leave for Boston, leaving Dan and William wondering when their father would come back. One day, while working in the cornfield, they spotted a tired horse with two riders emerging from the woods. Daniel recognized his father and ran to greet him, while William followed at a slower pace. With their father was a black boy, Zeb, who seemed frightened and confused. The boys tried to reassure Zeb, who misunderstood their gestures and thought they wanted to eat him. Despite their efforts, Zeb was scared and resisted going to the village. The return of Goodman Pepperell and Zeb drew a crowd of curious children who had never seen a black person before. Goodman Pepperell decided to head back to Boston promptly to attend to farm work and ease Susanna's worries.|"['1.

Daniel and his cousins took care of Zeb while his father prepared for their journey. They built a fire by the shore and cooked dinner for everyone. Zeb, feeling relieved, watched them cook a fish instead of him. Daniel shared a big piece with Zeb, making him feel grateful. As they set off on their dangerous journey, the town bid them farewell. Traveling through dense forests on a narrow trail, they had to be cautious of Indian attacks. They walked at times to rest the horses. Daniel almost fell asleep due to the warm day and buzzing mosquitoes. Suddenly, they encountered a deer and an Indian.

Goodman Pepperell and his wife woke early the next morning, leaving their children still asleep. They quietly descended the ladder to the floor below. There, Zeb lay sound asleep, resembling a little black Cinderella. The Goodwife's heart filled with pity as she gazed at him.

The days that came after were challenging for everyone. The Goodwife struggled to manage her family and chores in the cramped space. Zeb shadowed Dan constantly, while the Goodman worked tirelessly to catch up on the tasks he had left behind.

Despite the Goodwife's efforts with hot pepper tea, Zeb's howls filled the night. Eventually, the Goodman brought a saw from Boston, teaching Dan and Zeb how to use it to make boards for the new house. Nimrod, the dog, grew bigger and helped with the sheep.

As they awaited their parents, the cozy kitchen was filled with the aroma of simmering clams and freshly baked pies cooling on a shelf.

Excited to discover the whereabouts of the missing boy, Dan climbed up to the small window in the closet and peered out into the dark night. By the moon's glow, he witnessed two men dragging Zeb towards the straw-stack. Zeb fought back vigorously, making it challenging for the men as they juggled their guns and a tankard. To Dan's horror, one of them waved a burning brand snatched from the fire. Dan, filled with adrenaline, stayed composed. He quickly asked Nancy for a pumpkin and a pistol. Placing the pumpkin with a grinning face in the window and firing the pistol into the air, the Indians were startled and fled. The shot prompted a chorus of yells as the figures ran off with Zeb. Dan located the door catch by the lantern's light, and the children burst out of the closet. Dan grabbed a bucket of water, and they rushed outside to extinguish the spreading fire caused by the Indians. Despite their efforts, the fire continued to grow. They focused on keeping the ground wet around the stack to prevent the house from catching fire. The drumbeat in the distance signaled Gran'ther Wattles was alerting the village.
