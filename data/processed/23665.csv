The Elder Lady Toucan was the first to speak, accompanied by the old Doctor Buzzard and Admiral Penguin. Wise Owlet descended from Ivy-bush tower, while Counsellor Cross-bill offered advice. Some older birds, still single after many St. Valentines, observed the lack of wisdom in the current age. Lady Mackaw and Cockatoo disapproved of the Greenfinch flirting with the Siskin. The Raven predicted trouble, while others criticized the Bantam for strutting in pantaloons and the Game Chicken for wearing spurs. Alderman Cormorant eagerly awaited supper, and Magpie finally announced the banquet. The birds enjoyed a feast with wasps a la sauce piquante and flies en compote. The Razor-bill carved, and the Spoon-bill ladled soup. As the Lark signaled the end of the night, Chanticleer sensed the morning. With light hearts, the birds bid farewell and flew away, leaving the Peacock's ball to be remembered by future generations.|['1.
