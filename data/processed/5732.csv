Bunny and Sue were playing in their makeshift tent made from old sail pieces when their friends Charlie and Sadie joined them.

"Aunt Lu expressed gratitude, assigning Bunker to watch over her trunk and mentioning it could be sent later due to limited space in the pony cart. After scrubbing Sue's muddy dress, Aunt Lu prepared to leave, acknowledging familiar faces like Mr. Sam Gordon and Mrs. Redden. Bunny shielded Sue's dress from view as they rode in the pony cart. Sue suggested going to the dock to watch the fish boats arrive, a favorite pastime. They informed their father of Aunt Lu's arrival before heading to the dock with Bunker.

Lobsters have two large claws and several smaller ones. They walk backward on the ocean floor, picking up food. In rivers, there are crayfish similar to lobsters but smaller. When a fisherman caught a lobster, he avoided its claws and put it in a basket. George tried to touch the lobster and got pinched. Bunker helped him by opening the claw with a knife. The lobster can't close its claws tightly out of water. Lobster claws have tasty meat inside. Bunny and Sue played with them. Later, Aunt Lu lost her diamond ring.

After dinner, the family searched for Aunt Lu's missing ring, but it was nowhere to be found. Aunt Lu, usually fond of lobster salad, hardly ate, too worried about the lost ring. Bunny and Sue, sensing their aunt's distress, didn't feel like playing. Aunt Lu hoped to find the ring soon so she could join in their games. The next morning, she continued her search without success, growing sadder despite her efforts. Bunny and Sue, with pennies from Aunt Lu, decided to visit the candy store.

The mischievous monkey, Wango, continued to pull the lady's hair despite Bunny and Sue's presence. However, when tempted with candy and peanuts, Wango's demeanor changed. He graciously accepted the treats, showcasing his tamed side by bowing before retreating back to his cage. Miss Winkler, the elderly lady, explained that Wango had escaped due to an improperly locked cage, and she appreciated the children's help. Wango, who had been taught tricks by an old sailor, obeyed commands better from Mr. Winkler than Miss Winkler.

Sue and Bunny were having a blast sliding down the banister rail in an empty house. They were having so much fun that Bunny forgot about the red paint he wanted for a funny face.

Bunny and Sue found themselves on a large island in the river, their boat stuck firmly on the shore. Bunny decided to fish from the island, realizing they needed to secure the boat to prevent it from drifting away. Despite forgetting bait, Bunny tried fishing with an empty hook, to no avail.

Bunny and Sue decided to play a game of Robinson Crusoe on the island. Bunny suggested Sue could pretend to be colored by rubbing mud on her face and hands. Excited, Sue agreed and found some black mud to use. They explored the island, taking breaks in the leafy bower to escape the hot sun. Bunny pretended to row a boat, but Sue accidentally fell headfirst into the river. Panicked, she splashed around, forgetting how to swim.

Bunny and Sue easily boarded the boat, followed by their joyful dog. However, when Bunny tried to push the boat away from the island, it was stuck in the mud.

Bunny crafted a tiny cup from an oak leaf and shared a drink with Sue. Splash, the dog, also lapped up some water trickling down the road's grassy edge. The dog found something by the road, resembling a black stone, but Bunny and Sue noticed it moving. Stones don't move on their own. The object turned out to be a turtle. The dog barked at it, but wisely kept a distance. Bunny prodded the turtle with a stick, causing it to retreat into its shell. Bored of watching, they ventured into the shade, finding a spring to drink from. They built miniature houses from pine cones. Lost in the woods, they searched for a way home, but the paths led to dead ends. They encountered frogs and turtles in a swamp.|['1.

"""Oh, Bunny!"" she exclaimed, ""if Splash knew the way home he could take us. Maybe he does. Mother read to us about a dog that found his way home from a long way off. Splash, can you take us home?"" she asked, patting the big dog on the head. It was easy to get home now. All the while Bunny and Sue had been only a little way from the road which led to their home, but the trees were so thick they could not find the right path. And Splash had never thought his two little friends were anxious to get home until Bunny had told him so. Then he led them. On walked Bunny Brown and his sister Sue, happy now that they were no longer lost. Splash seemed to think he had done all that was needed, for now he ran here, there, everywhere--across the road, back and forth, trying to find something with which to amuse himself. He no longer watched to see that the children followed him. He must have known that they were on the right road at last--that he had led them there. Bunny and Sue passed Mrs. Redden's store. In the window were the red, blue, green, yellow and other colored toy balloons that they had set out to buy. Bunny and Sue still each had five cents, though it was in pennies now.

Bunny had a plan to keep Wango safe. He decided to use a long chain to fasten Wango to the porch railing so he could stay outdoors when the weather was nice. At night, Wango would go back into his cage. Mr. Winkler went on his way, and Bunny found Sue playing with their friends in Sadie West's yard. They were having fun on a homemade see-saw when Bunny arrived. Sue kindly gave up her spot for Bunny to play, causing a funny mishap with the see-saw. As dinner time approached, the children dispersed. Sue and Bunny headed home through a vacant lot where they encountered a big goat. Bunny, unsure of what to do, tried to scare the goat away with the idea of a red rag, not realizing that goats don't react to red like bulls do.

Bunny and Sue were playing in the yard when a goat approached them. Bunny tried to scare the goat away by throwing stones, but it didn't work. Suddenly, their dog Splash came running and barking at the goat, causing it to run away. Sue urged Bunny to follow her through a hole in the fence to escape. Later, they found out the goat was friendly and mistook Sue for someone who would feed it. The siblings then planned a party for Splash, inviting their friends. They decided to make kites and play with dolls at the party. Bunny and his friends would fly kites while the girls played with dolls. Aunt Lu helped set up tables in the yard, and Bunny even tried to make Splash pull a wagon. The day of the party arrived, and everyone was excited to celebrate Splash.|"['1.

At the party, Bunny tried to make a harness for Splash, but it kept breaking. Sue gathered flowers from the fields nearby. Sadie brought a bone for Splash with a pink ribbon. The dog happily gnawed on the bone and dog biscuit. As the guests arrived, more girls than boys came. They played games on the lawn while Splash dug a hole for his bone. Later, everyone sat at the tables with delicious food. Aunt Lu and Mrs. Brown served the kids, who were too busy eating to talk much.

"Aunt Lu shared a story with Bunny and Sue about boys who set up a lemonade stand to help poor children. Inspired, Bunny decided to do the same for ""Old Miss Hollyhock,"" a kind, elderly lady in need. With their mother's approval, Bunny and Sue prepared lemonade, set up a stand under a tree, and covered it with a white cloth. They eagerly served lemonade to passersby, hoping to raise money for Mrs. Borden. The children worked hard, pouring drinks and collecting coins. By the end of the day, Bunny and Sue had made a good amount of money. Their kind gesture brought smiles to their faces, knowing they were helping someone in need."|"[""1.

A man paid only a penny for a glass of lemonade worth five cents. As Bunny and Sue saw a dog with a tin can tied to its tail approaching, chaos ensued. The dog ran under a box, causing it to fall over on Bunny, Sue, and the lemonade pitcher, splashing them. Amid the commotion, the dog got entangled with the children. After the dog realized Bunny and Sue were friends, they all got along. Aunt Lu, with her scissors, cut the tin can off the dog's tail. She comforted the frightened dog and helped Bunny and Sue clean up. Aunt Lu suggested they go back home as they had probably sold enough lemonade for the day.|"['**1.

Everything turned out fine, with no broken glasses as they landed on soft grass. Some lemonade spilled on Bunny and Sue, but they didn't mind. The best part was the yellow dog no longer had a tin can tied to its tail. The aunt mentioned that it was likely the work of mischievous boys who didn't consider how scared the animals would be. The dog, after saying goodbye to Splash and the children, trotted away happily, occasionally looking back in gratitude. The children spent a rainy day playing in the attic, pretending a spinning wheel was a trolley car. They took turns being the motorman and conductor. The day was so fun that bedtime arrived before they knew it. Bunny and Sue, hand in hand, strolled down the street and were drawn to a new moving picture theater with colorful posters that caught Bunny's eye.|"['1.

A while later, Bunny Brown and his sister Sue found themselves at the open side door of a theater. The sound of the piano filled the air, accompanying the flashing moving pictures on the white screen visible from the entrance. Entranced by the spectacle, the children ventured inside without paying as no one was there to collect tickets. The dark theater concealed their entry as they made their way closer to the stage where the vivid images were displayed. Unaware of the audience's attention being on the screen, Bunny and Sue stepped onto the stage itself, illuminated by the bright light from the projector. Laughter erupted as they stood in the spotlight, prompting the piano player and the usher to take notice. The lights were turned up, revealing the children to the amused crowd. Bunny grinned while Sue shyly tried to hide behind him, adding to the laughter in the theater.|"['1.

The usher chuckled, suggesting the kids return with a guardian and through the main door next time. Excited, Sue agreed to leave with Mrs. Wakefield, who knew them. At Mr. Brown's dock, boats were being prepped with new sails and fresh paint. Lobster-filled fishing boats arrived, one with massive claws for dinner salad. When Aunt Lu declined lobsters, Bunker Blue offered them a boat ride. They later witnessed a mischievous monkey, Wango, causing chaos in a candy store. Wango's playful antics resulted in jelly beans scattered on the floor, showing his mischievous yet amusing character.|"['1.

Miss Winkler, the sister of the sailor who brought Wango from a distant place, was not liked by the monkey. Wango did not like her either, and it seemed she did not like him back. Wango also did not seem to like Mrs. Redden, the owner of the candy shop he was in. Mrs. Redden tried to shoo Wango off the shelf with a broom, worried he might ruin the candy.

Meanwhile, Bunny and Sue received their lollypops and Mrs. Redden began cleaning up the mess caused by Wango's mischief. The candy-shop lady realized Wango must have sneaked in when she was busy. Sue shared how Wango had grabbed the lollypops. The kids decided to play hide-and-seek, and Bunny cleverly hid inside an empty rain-water barrel.

The cook explained that she covered Bunny with a cloth over the barrel, mistaking it for a towel. Bunny then wanted to harness Splash to his wagon but struggled with the harness breaking. Bunker quickly made new handles and a strong harness. Bunny guided Splash with the reins around his neck, as dogs can't wear bits like horses. They went on a smooth ride in the yard and then onto the sidewalk. But Splash, wanting to meet a yellow dog, ran faster, not heeding Bunny's calls to stop.

Down the road, Splash ran swiftly, closing in on the small yellow dog. The yellow dog, with its short legs, began to yelp in fear of being caught or made to pull Bunny and Sue in the toy wagon. Meanwhile, Bunny and Sue, unaware of the commotion, enjoyed their fast ride with Splash pulling the wagon. As Splash caught up to the yellow dog, a mishap occurred. The yellow dog stumbled, causing the wagon to tip over, spilling Bunny and Sue onto the grass. Fortunately, they were unharmed, though Sue's dress got stained.

In the barn, there were many spots where a hen could lay eggs—under wagons, behind boxes, and in the haymow. Bunny and Sue found the hidden nest, though Sue ended up with egg stains. Mrs. Brown wasn't upset and just changed Sue's dress. When they visited the grocery-store-keeper's wife, she laughed at the egg mishap and gave them cookies. Later, their friends came over and were shown the hay spot where the eggs were found. The kids played with dolls and climbed apple trees.

Bunny had gotten his foot stuck deep inside a hollow tree. Despite his efforts, he couldn't free himself. George came to help, using a box to reach Bunny's foot and eventually freeing him. Mrs. Brown also lent a hand, managing to release Bunny's foot from his shoe. After the rescue, the group enjoyed cookies and treats from Aunt Lu.

"Bunny and Sue told their mother about a ""show"" in the barn without revealing details. To play there, they needed permission and old clothes for dressing up. Bunny made a lobster claw nose with Bunker's help, making everyone laugh. They couldn't do a Punch and Judy play like the real one. Bunker built a mini theater, hidden in a wagon, for the show. Tickets were sold to help Old Miss Hollyhock and Aunt Lu. Bunny and Sue visited Mrs. Redden's shop, bought candy, and saw Mr. Reinberg's car. They pretended to be on a boat in the car, but Mr. Reinberg drove off, unaware of them until Sue spoke loudly."|"['1.

I assumed you were going to ask your mom for permission."" The dry-goods-store owner chuckled, ""This is quite amusing!

I've been driving fast. Let's figure out what to do. I need to head to Wayville and can't turn back with you. I don't want to worry your folks. Let me think.""
