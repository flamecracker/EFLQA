In the group of marksmen by the riverbank, Louis Lambert, a confident and handsome youth, impressed with his accurate shot. The scene took a comical turn when little Tony, who had been hiding behind the target, pretended to be hit and fell dramatically, only to jump up laughing. As the group recovered from the prank, a Red Indian chief appeared, drawn by the gunshot. Mr. Ravenshaw, a fur-trader, took the opportunity to release his frustration on the chief due to a recent practical joke. The arrival of the Indian caused a stir, particularly for Miss Trim, a governess from England, who was startled by the sight.

"Sam Ravenshaw chuckled, ""I know who you're talking about, that sneaky Petawanaquat, also known as Little Wolf. He may look tough, but he's not that dangerous.

Ian, feeling embarrassed, forgot his prepared speech and bravely expressed his love for Mr. Ravenshaw's daughter.

Angus Macdonald returned home in a grumpy mood. His small log house, built by him, resembled a Noah's ark. It had no special foundation, just a wooden frame. Angus, a widower, lived with his sister Martha, who excelled in caring for fowls. Martha's chickens were always tender and fat, and her eggs were the best. One of her hens, named Beauty, played a crucial role later. Despite being plain and useless, Beauty was a widow and a cross hen. Angus discussed his troubles with Martha, leading to a lengthy conversation. Meanwhile, Tony, a child, played near Willow Creek. Petawanaquat, an Indian, observed Tony and swiftly approached him, covering his mouth before he could yell.|"['1.

Petawanaquat swiftly took the child in his canoe, covered him with a leather coat and buffalo robe, and paddled down the river unnoticed. Tony's absence was soon noticed, causing panic. Ian and Victor, determined to rescue Tony, set out in their canoe. Victor's anger fueled their pursuit as they raced to catch up with Petawanaquat. The friends paddled tirelessly, cutting corners to save time. As they ventured deeper into the wilderness, their canoe began to leak. Ian skillfully repaired it with wattape and melted gum, while Victor lit a fire. With the canoe fixed, they continued their urgent journey, fueled by determination and a sense of justice.|"['1.

Ian quickly sealed the canoe's seams with melted gum, ensuring it was as tight as a bottle. As they set off downstream, Ian suggested resting to conserve energy until the moon rose for observations. Victor, exhausted, was advised to sleep. After a quick meal, they changed into dry moccasins and settled on the shore of Lake Winnipeg. The calm night was broken only by the chorus of frogs. The stars reflected dimly in the water until the full moon's light revealed their surroundings. Ian noticed footprints, and Victor identified Tony's moccasin by a distinct patch. Excited, they prepared to follow the trail, eating pemmican for strength.|"[""1. What did Ian use to seal the canoe's seams?\nA) Wax\nB) Melted gum\nC) Rope\nD) Clay\nE) Paint"", '2.

As the moonlight shimmered on Lake Winnipeg, Victor and Ian paddled their bark canoe with care and speed. The vast wilderness of Rupert's Land surrounded them as they glided through the water. Victor, leaning against the wooden bar, felt the sun rising and hunger stirring. He reached for the pemmican bag, a mixture of dried buffalo meat and fat, a hearty meal for their journey. The crystal lake water refreshed them, and they continued paddling under the emerging sun and clear blue sky. Spotting a creek, they hurried, only to find an old Indian and a French half-breed in a hidden canoe. The chase for Petawanaquat began, with the old Indian Peegwish left behind. The trail led them through woods, swamps, and stony places, testing their woodcraft skills as they pursued their quarry.|"['1.

Old Peegwish stared at the fire as if he were deeply thinking. Although he understood little English, it's more likely he was focused on the roasting duck. To shift from despair to hope is common for energetic youth. Victor Ravenshaw woke up refreshed, ready for the day. Peegwish had been up early, starting a fire and preparing breakfast. Victor, amused by Peegwish's intense focus on the duck, burst into laughter. Ian, waking from a nap, scolded Victor for disturbing them. They enjoyed a meal of robbiboo, a soup made of pemmican and flour. Ian questioned their next steps cautiously, unsure if their plan was wise. Rollin proposed a solution: he and Peegwish would go on a long hunt for supplies while the others continued the chase. The group agreed, and the plan was set in motion. They set off on foot, following the faint trail of the fugitives. Despite challenges, they persevered, with Ian's keen eyes leading the way until they found fresh tracks.|"[""1.

The group, determined to rescue Elsie and Tony, followed Petawanaquat's trail through the woods and onto the vast prairie. The pursuit was relentless, with hope growing as they emerged from the trees. The trail led south and then sharply west, hinting at a journey towards the Pacific Ocean. Despite tempting distractions like game and a mysterious bird, the group pressed on. As they reached a point of confusion near a lake, they discovered recent signs of an Indian camp. Anxiety gripped them, unsure if Petawanaquat had joined the camp or continued alone. With resolve, they scoured the area for clues, but the trail vanished among the many footprints.

The entire day was spent in a fruitless attempt to find Petawanaquat's footprints among the Indian tracks. Ian and Rollin wandered far, losing sight of each other and the camp. Victor got lost, but his comrades quickly searched and found him by firing shots for his reply. That night they camped by the lake, discussing their plans. It was decided Petawanaquat had joined the Indians, and they resolved to follow fast. For days they pursued without catching up. Running low on food, they neglected hunting. One evening, they stumbled upon the Indians' recent camp. Petawanaquat had altered Tony's appearance and cared for him during their travels. Tony, who spoke some Indian, began to feel fondness for his captor. The Indian transformed Tony's look with colorful deer-skin clothing and a unique haircut.|"[""1.

The artist, a versatile operator, painted Tony's face with bright-red, yellow ochre, and blue paint, creating a striking effect. Starting with a scarlet streak from the eyebrows, he skipped the mouth and continued down the chin with a blend of yellow ochre and charcoal. The painter skillfully added blue bars on the cheeks, red circles, and a black triangle on the forehead. Tony's eyes were accentuated with intensely black spots on the upper eyelids. After the general effect was achieved, the finishing touches were added. Petawanaquat, the artist, modified his own costume with fringed leggings, face paint, feathers in his hair, and accessories like a firebag and a tomahawk. Tony, the boy being painted, was intrigued by the process and the intense gaze of the artist. Despite not understanding everything, Tony tried to engage in conversation, impressing the Indian with his knowledge of Christian virtues. The Indian, while puzzled by Tony's responses, appreciated the boy's attempt to understand.|"[""1.

After leaving the small lake on the flat lands, the Native American journeyed for a few days with his companions. Eventually, he bid them farewell and headed west to reunite with his family. The trackers missed this crucial split, only catching up with the tribe to discover the abductor had eluded them. Ian Macdonald, in discussion with his group, decided to stick with the tribe. They learned of a buffalo sighting in their path, giving them an advantage as they knew the kidnapper's destination. They anticipated a slower pace from the fugitive, believing he had outpaced all followers. The plan took a turn when they stumbled upon a wide trail made by carts and riders. The tribe's leader confirmed they were heading in the same direction, prompting an overnight march to catch up. By midnight, they spotted the campfires in the distance. Ian proposed borrowing horses from some of the group to speed up their pursuit, promising a good reward. With the horses secured, they enjoyed a hearty meal and stayed up chatting and drinking tea until morning. The band they joined was a mix of Red River half-breeds on a grand buffalo hunt, comprising hundreds of hunters, women, children, carts, horses, oxen, buffalo-runners, and dogs. The women managed camp tasks like cooking and skinning buffalo hides for bags and pemmican.

Twice a year, the hunters embarked on trips to the plains: the spring hunt provided them with essential supplies like clothing and ammunition for the year, while the fall hunt stocked their winter food and helped settle debts. Failure in the fall hunt led to starvation and suffering. Despite the risks, the half-breeds were carefree during the spring hunt. Victor, a novice horseman, joined the exhilarating chase. The vast herds of bison on the North American prairie were mirrored by the gregarious buffalo-hunters of Red River. Organizing themselves into a camp, they elected Baptiste Warder as their chief. Each captain oversaw ten men, and guides led the camp daily, hoisting flags to signal movement and encampment. The organized structure provided protection against potential threats.|['1.

No hunting is permitted on the Sabbath day. Hunters must stay together and follow the leader's orders. Punishments for breaking these rules were severe. A first offense meant having gear destroyed, a second led to clothing being ruined, and a third resulted in a flogging. Thieves were publicly shamed in the camp. When scouts finally found buffalo after weeks of searching, the camp was overjoyed. The hunters, including Victor Ravenshaw, spotted the buffalo in the distance. The hunters carried bullets in their mouths for quick reloading while riding. When the signal was given, they charged towards the buffalo, causing chaos and taking down many animals swiftly. Skilled hunters could identify their kills even in the midst of a fast-paced hunt.|['1.

During the intense battle, the air was filled with dust and smoke. With the rocky ground and badger-holes, casualties were inevitable. Twenty-three horses and riders tumbled to the ground, one horse gored by a bull and two others disabled. Riders faced injuries like broken bones, lost fingers, and damaged guns. Despite the chaos, most bullets hit their targets due to the skilled marksmen. In the midst of the chaos, Victor Ravenshaw, filled with both fear and determination, joined the fray. He fired at a buffalo, nearly losing his balance. After a successful shot, he quickly reloaded, narrowly avoiding gun mishaps. An intense moment ensued as a bull charged, causing a rider to be tossed in the air. Miraculously unharmed, the rider was temporarily out of the battle.

As Ian spoke, the bull turned suddenly and hit Winklemann's horse. The impact threw Winklemann off his horse, but luckily he only suffered a minor injury. Victor and Ian rushed to help him, and after a quick check, they found he was okay. They decided to head back to camp since they were far from the main group. On the way, they spotted more game to hunt, ensuring they had enough food for the camp. Back at camp, there was a feast with juicy steaks and marrow-bones. Everyone celebrated the successful hunt with joy and laughter. The women prepared pemmican, and the men continued hunting the next day.

As the sun began to set, a group of hunters rode triumphantly towards the camp. Baptiste Warder, the fearless leader, was at the forefront, with Victor, Ian, Rollin, and others close behind. They burst into the camp excitedly, dismounting their horses with joy. Victor shared his success, boasting of ten kills, while Ian had missed fifteen shots. Herr Winklemann, usually lively, seemed off during dinner, his aversion to falling a sensitive topic. The group chatted after supper, smoking their pipes, except for Ian and Winklemann, who abstained. Winklemann criticized Victor's attempt at smoking, stating it was a foolish way to appear manly. Victor, feeling exposed, realized his true intentions and gave up the habit before it controlled him. Winklemann challenged Victor's choice, arguing that drinking, a natural act, was more justifiable than smoking.|['1.

The laughter that followed the question was abruptly halted by the urgent sound of a galloping horse. Everyone quickly armed themselves as the rider approached the camp, clearly in distress. The rider, Valle, a young boy, arrived with tragic news - his father had been killed by Sioux Indians. A group of hunters immediately set out to seek revenge, led by Valle on a fresh horse. As they rode back to camp, Valle recounted the harrowing events. The father, Louison Valle, had been ambushed by a group of Sioux while skinning a buffalo, leaving Valle to warn his son before succumbing to the attackers. The hunters knew the murderers had fled to the thick bush, making pursuit difficult. Understanding the grim reality of war for the first time, Victor Ravenshaw's perspective on conflict was forever changed.|"['1.

That evening, the group of avengers came back after a successful encounter with the Sioux. They managed to capture eight of the Sioux warriors, while the remaining four fled into the bushes. Luckily, none of the avengers were injured, although one had a close call when an arrow narrowly missed him. The following day, Victor and his friends were about to resume their pursuit of Petawanaquat when a sudden and intense thunderstorm hit the prairies. The storm was so severe that lightning struck down several horses, including one that Herr Winklemann was riding. The camp was flooded, and some children had to be rescued from drowning. The storm also caused destruction to the tents and resulted in injuries from large hailstones.

Victor, Ian, and Rollin finally escaped the buffalo and savages. They had three good horses, fresh provisions, and ample ammunition. Galloping with light hearts over the plains, they left the hunters' camp far behind. With determination, they pursued Petawanaquat. Following the trail described by the Saulteaux Indians, they easily found it. Racing over the prairie, their excitement grew as they searched for their target. Despite days of racing and searching, they remained confident. Resting briefly on a knoll, they discussed their pursuit. As they spotted a group of buffalo, Rollin suggested chasing them, but Victor reminded them of their important mission. Pressing on, they encountered challenges but remained focused.

Unbeknownst to the three friends, as they settled down for the night after a hearty meal, danger lurked nearby. Petawanaquat, an Indian chief, observed them from a clump of trees. His son, Tony, pondered the mysteries of his father's smoking pipe. Suddenly, Petawanaquat sensed approaching horses and stealthily moved to investigate, his intentions veiled in mystery. As he contemplated taking drastic action, a fleeting smile and a moral lesson stayed his hand. The night passed without incident, leaving the friends blissfully unaware of the peril that had loomed so close. The silent vigil of the Indian chief, guided by patience and wisdom, averted a potential tragedy that night in the wilderness.|"['1.

Petawanaquat, moving stealthily like a cat, swiftly readied his horse at camp. Despite Tony's deep slumber, the Indian roused him with some effort. Tony, still half-asleep, obeyed silently. Together, they crossed a stream and rode off into the night under the moon's faint light. Meanwhile, Michel Rollin's early rising led to the discovery of the mysterious visitor's trail. Alerted, Ian and Victor quickly followed the tracks, suspecting Petawanaquat's involvement. They hurried on, tracing the Indian's path to his previous campsite. Ian, undeterred by the extinguished fire, swiftly discerned the truth and urged his companions to mount up and pursue. The chase led them through open plains and thick grass until they reached a small pond where they paused briefly, mirroring the fugitive's earlier stop.|"['1.

The Indian riding through the prairie suddenly saw smoke and flames ahead. The fire was spreading fast towards him with the wind. To protect himself and Tony, he quickly lit a fire around them to create a safe space. As the flames closed in, they rode into the burnt area just in time to escape the suffocating smoke. The pursuers following them had to do the same to survive. The chase continued with hope despite facing challenges like the horse tripping and a rainy night.

No one responded to such an obvious truth, but each man slowly got up and stumbled towards higher ground. The night was extremely dark, making it impossible to see even a yard ahead. Victor didn't bother to reply; he lay under a tree for some shelter, wrapped in his wet blanket, and fell asleep. His companions did the same. They woke up damp and disheartened but mounted their horses at dawn to continue the chase. The landscape changed, becoming more uneven with patches of woodland. One evening, the clouds cleared, and the sun shone brightly, lifting their spirits. Ian pondered about heaven, wishing people talked more about it.

The danger was immense, as the hunter's aim was poor and the prey was a resilient creature that could survive a shot. Ian Macdonald, aware of the risks, prepared to face the bear.

The pursuers searched in vain for the lost Tony. Unable to find his trail, they headed to the nearest fur-traders' post. There, they learned of an Indian heading towards the Rocky Mountains, but no one had detailed information about the boy. The traders provided them with provisions on credit, knowing Victor's father's reputation. They joined a party going up the Saskatchewan river. Despite vague memories from a trader about Tony's unusual brown, curly hair, Victor, Ian, and Rollin decided to continue the chase. The summer and autumn passed. The hunters returned to the plains for the fall hunt after selling their spring hunt's proceeds. The half-breeds faced difficulties due to a partial hunt failure. The hunters had to deal with starvation when the hunt failed completely. Despite leaving many carcasses behind, the spring hunt was successful, providing substantial provisions to the settlement. The hunters sold most of their provisions to the Hudson's Bay Company but struggled with debts due to their volatile spending habits. They returned for the fall hunt soon after. The hunters split into smaller groups, following the buffalo for survival during winter. Herr Winklemann and Baptiste Warder were part of one such group, facing starvation. The plains were snowy, and the hunters were desperate. Winklemann, dressed in a wolf-skin, set out on a sledge pulled by dogs armed with bow and arrows to hunt buffalo near a clump of trees.|"[""1.

Winklemann, a skilled hunter, cleverly disguised himself with a wolf-skin to approach a herd of buffalo for food. He shot a cow and another animal, causing the buffalo to flee in a panic. Meanwhile, a child on a sled was chased by dogs into the buffalo herd, leading to chaos. Despite the dogs being killed, the child miraculously remained unharmed.

During their winter journey following the buffalo, the mixed-race families had traveled over 150 to 200 miles away from their settlement. Despite facing hardships, they remained hopeful that they would find more buffalo herds soon. Unfortunately, on December 20th, a severe snowstorm hit, pushing the buffalo out of reach and causing the death of many horses. The sudden disaster caught everyone off guard, leading to a famine. Some families huddled together for warmth but tragically froze to death. While some people acted selfishly, thinking only of themselves, others showed selflessness by caring for those around them. Warder urged his group to keep moving to seek help, and they encountered a tragic scene of a frozen family. Determined to reach safety, they continued their journey, only to be startled by a man threatening them with a gun.|"['1.

They found the man's wife and child lifeless in the bush. The men discovered tracks of the woman with her baby, trekking through the snow. Despite their own struggles, they shared their provisions with her. Even though they couldn't stay to help her, they parted ways with kindness. The woman's determination led her on a journey of over a hundred miles, but tragically, she and her child didn't make it home. Warder and Winklemann, on their own challenging journey, encountered only a raven for food. Despite exhaustion, they pressed on towards the settlement. Mr. Ravenshaw worried about Tony and Victor, hoping for their safe return. The old man's heart ached, longing for the presence of his dear ones.|"['1.

"At that instant, a noise was heard in the porch. The door swung open, revealing a thin, weary man with torn, snow-dusted clothes, a pale face, and bloodshot eyes against the dark porch background.

No one can understand until they've starved for two weeks - I mean two days; it feels the same to me."" Warder clarified they had intended to arrive sooner but got lost, attributing it to weakness. Guided by the pole-star, they stumbled upon Willow Creek's house. Lambert, with a playful look at Elsie, explained the Great Bear constellation and how to find the pole-star for direction. While Louis tried to engage Elsie, she was absorbed in the hunters' plight. As they ate, the hunters shared more details, and Warder, invigorated, insisted on rushing to inform the Governor of the urgent news and rally the settlement for aid.

Lambert immediately drove off upon hearing Angus without waiting for his response. Angus, dressed in his leather coat, fur cap, and mittens, readied himself to drive to Fort Garry, where the Governor resided. His aim was to offer help and learn about the situation. Similarly, old Ravenshaw prepared his horse to head towards the same destination, despite the harsh weather and his age. As they approached a junction near the creek, both neighbors, eager to aid the hunters in need, found themselves on a collision course. With pride influencing them, a clash seemed imminent until Ravenshaw chose to yield, mending their strained relationship. They continued in silence, but the rift between them had begun to heal. Both men generously contributed to the relief efforts, joining rescue parties with dog-sled teams to navigate the deep snow and aid those in need.|['1.

The dogs tried to escape with Angus but soon found him heavy. They paused, panting, waiting for the driver to guide them. A young driver led them to a clear path on the plains, where the dogs trotted briskly. Despite the driver's attempts to slow them down, the dogs dashed ahead, causing the sled to tip over. Along the journey, they encountered settlers heading to help. Many lives were saved, but some perished. The survivors had endured extreme conditions, resorting to eating leather and even their own shoes. Mr. Ravenshaw and his neighbor aided those in need. Eventually, all hunters were rescued, with one family surviving being buried in snow for five days. The harsh winter brought heavy snow, freezing temperatures, and challenges, leaving the community in awe of nature's power.|"['1.

In the wilderness, Angus Macdonald often dismissed heavy snowfall with a nonchalant remark. Peegwish, his kitchen assistant, would respond with a deep glare. One morning, as Ian Macdonald prepared breakfast in the woods, Victor Ravenshaw rushed in, claiming he spotted huge grizzly bear tracks. This news excited Ian, who had lost hope as autumn waned. Ian confided in Victor about his feelings for his sister and the opportunity to impress her with a bear-claw collar. Despite Ian's doubts about his shooting skills, he decided to pursue the grizzly. With his friends' promise not to interfere unless his life was in danger, Ian led them to examine the bear's fresh tracks.

"Victor chuckled, ""Do as you wish. Rollin and I will scout for a wild goose."" Ian Macdonald readied his gun, armed with determination to track a bear. He marched towards a narrow pass, thick with trees and undergrowth. Ian cleared the path by felling trees, blocking the way completely. Crafting a trap with a suspended log, he waited, gun at the ready. As the day waned, a noise stirred him. Alert, he scanned the area, tense. With a relieved sigh, he relaxed, but his senses remained sharp. Ian's vigil continued, prepared for whatever might come his way."|['1.

The grizzly bear is known for its strong will to survive. Ian missed hitting the neck-bone, causing the bear to twist the axe handle violently, knocking the hunter down. The bear then clawed deeply into Ian's thigh. Despite the intense pain, Ian kept his composure and used his scalping knife to stab the bear twice. Victor, Ian's friend, offered him hot tea to refresh him after the fight. Ian was not proud of his accomplishment but was thrilled at the thought of presenting Elsie with superior claws. The harsh winter of 1826 gave way to a warm day, signaling the end of the severe season. Louis Lambert decided to go wolf-hunting on horseback as the snow thawed, allowing horses to move freely while wolves struggled in the soft snow.

Peegwish, an elderly Indian, lived with his sister Wildcat in a small, rundown log-cabin near a river. Despite their humble abode, Wildcat kept the place warm by tending to the fire and collecting fuel. One day, Peegwish decided to brew his own beer using barley. He carefully boiled the barley in a pot over the fire, while Wildcat observed his unusual behavior with curiosity. As the hours passed, Peegwish patiently waited for the barley to turn into beer, but his attempts were unsuccessful. Despite Wildcat's concerns about the rising river and the ice, Peegwish remained focused on his brewing experiment.

The quiet at breakfast was broken when Mr. Ravenshaw's horse was ready. Passing near Angus Macdonald's coveted summer-house, he paused to see the alarming river. The ice was crashing down the torrent, flooding the lower lands. Trees were swept away, including a tall elm on Angus's property. People were frantic, moving their valuables to safety at the mission station. Chaos reigned as they prepared to abandon their homes due to the rising flood. Mr. Ravenshaw, buttoned up against the sleet, galloped to the mission station. There, men, women, and children were in a frenzy, securing their belongings. The missionary tried to restore order. The scene was chaotic, with people in distress. Mr. Ravenshaw then went to check on his friend's house, finding it surrounded by goods and livestock, a refuge for many. The devastation was apparent as the river overflowed, turning the land into a lake. Settlers were evacuating, and the chilling scene was worsened by shivering cattle and a freezing temperature.|"['1.

One of the most noticeable sights from Ravenshaw's viewpoint was Winklemann's small house, already surrounded by rising water. Winklemann, without a coat or hat, waded through the flood carrying a large bundle. Herr Winklemann had an elderly mother, frail and wrinkled, whom he was determined to protect. He carefully moved her to old Liz's cottage, securing her in a chair to keep her safe. As the flood worsened, the water rose rapidly, threatening the wooden houses in the settlement. Despite efforts to secure the homes, the ice-laden water proved too powerful, causing destruction. Winklemann's house, like many others, succumbed to the flood, leaving settlers homeless. With the waters rising, settlers had to flee to higher ground, seeking safety from the deluge.|"[""1.

Louis Lambert had to leave his home the day after his friend Winklemann's house was destroyed. Lambert's sturdy two-storey house was less affected by the flood due to its location. Despite moving his belongings to the upper floor, the rising water made Lambert fear his house might float away like others. He decided to relocate to Ravenshaw's place. Lambert rode off recklessly to secure his goods, passing devastated homes submerged in water. He encountered friends loading belongings onto a canoe. They warned him of the spreading floodwaters. Lambert, undeterred, galloped onward but faced obstacles like a washed-out bridge. After a mishap, he continued his journey, passing a mission station and a settlement of tents.

"""It's important to be prepared,"" Lambert said, looking at Elsie and Cora seated near the window. He explained that his house was not as safe as he had thought and asked for space to store his belongings. Suddenly, a loud crash was heard outside. A massive block of ice, resembling a church spire, tried to leap over the garden fence but eventually succeeded, causing water to rush in. Mr. Ravenshaw and Angus discussed the rising water levels and the need to protect their belongings from damage. Peegwish, a wise man, sought refuge at the mission station. As the flood worsened, many sought shelter at the church and parsonage. By May 13th, the entire area near the Red River was submerged, with houses and huts floating away.

The Indian guided his canoe to the door, resembling a gondolier from Venice. The Wildcat paddled at the bow, the clergyman sat in the middle, and they swiftly disappeared. The day was warm, but the sky hinted at bad weather. They navigated carefully to avoid obstacles, reaching open plains akin to Lake Winnipeg. They encountered a stage by a cottage with women and children singing hymns. Further up, they met old Liz, the only one left near her hut. A storm trapped Mr. Cockran with a farmer as a gust knocked down their tent. Chaos ensued as a fire broke out, but rain extinguished it.

Mrs. Cockran pleaded with Winklemann to stay a bit longer to help with the stage setup, hoping her husband might return early or the storm might pass. Despite his concerns about the weather, Winklemann agreed to stay briefly. He worked on building a sturdy stage for safety in case the parsonage became unstable. As he worked, a fierce storm hit, trapping the clergyman and forcing Winklemann to stay. Determined to leave, Winklemann tried to paddle away but failed against the strong winds. Even with extra help, the storm thwarted their efforts. Meanwhile, Mrs. Winklemann and Daddy remained oblivious to the danger, trusting their children to care for them.

The cozy moment was short-lived. Soon, water seeped in, flooding the floor. The elderly couple, luckily perched on stools, stayed dry. Quick-thinking Liz grabbed a table to keep them above water. She even served bread and cheese to distract them. As the water rose, Liz grew anxious. With no higher ground, she feared for their safety. Then, a miracle: the hut began to float.

Liz was determined and daring, climbing up the chimney like a skilled dancer. Balancing on one toe, she vanished from sight, only to reappear moments later like a dark demon with wild hair. Undeterred by the storm brewing outside, Liz quoted poetry while cleaning herself in a comical mishap.

One morning, the calmness at Willow Creek was so deep that the sleepers weren't roused until the sun shone over the tranquil sea. The grassy prairie had transformed into a glass-like water body. Wooden houses and barns floated like boats on the water. Elsie and Cora, awakening in their upper room, were amazed by the fairyland-like sight. The flood had forced the Ravenshaws to the upper floor, with rooms assigned for men and women. The family and neighbors found refuge in the barn, connected by a canoe ferry. The lumber-room turned into a shared space for meals and discussions. Mr. Ravenshaw, enjoying the challenges, attempted culinary feats.

Houses and barns floated everywhere, abandoned by their owners. Dogs, cats, and poultry were left behind, adding to the desolation with their noises. Furniture and dead animals were swept away by the flood, creating a scene of chaos. Carts, carriages, and various items were stranded along the riverbank. The settlers sought refuge on higher ground after being displaced by the rising waters. At a mission station, the pastor emphasized the importance of cheerfully accepting whatever challenges come their way. A widow, despite losing everything, showed great strength by quietly making moccasins for her child.

Poor Winklemann was frantically searching for his lost mother in his small canoe when he crashed into a fence, damaging the delicate birch bark vessel. The canoe sank, leaving him stranded in the water. Despite being a good swimmer, the large hole in the canoe left him helpless.

Lambert pulled Herr Winklemann alongside the boat under the moonlight. Winklemann was stupefied and clung tightly to his canoe, making it hard to rescue him. Lambert and the Indian managed to get him into the birch canoe. As they struggled to lift Winklemann out of the water, they finally freed his hands and saved him. Years later, the Red River Settlement faced a similar flood, with only one casualty, like in 1826. The red man, Petawanaquat, spent the winter teaching Tony hunting skills in the Rocky Mountains. Petawanaquat was a kind husband to his wife, Meekeye, who treated Tony like her own. Tony, in turn, grew to care for Meekeye and learned from the red man's chivalrous ways.|"['1.

In the presence of his new father, Tony strived for absolute perfection. Petawanaquat's seriousness intimidated him, but Tony quickly adapted. Meekeye taught him to craft leggings and embellish moccasins, satisfying Tony's hunger for knowledge and food. Under Petawanaquat's guidance, Tony learned to ride bareback and shoot arrows fearlessly. During a hunting trip, a grizzly bear startled them. Tony's arrow stunned the bear, and Petawanaquat finished it off. As winter approached, Petawanaquat seemed troubled, hinting at white strangers nearby. Tony, now more mature and expressive, responded gravely. His transformation impressed Petawanaquat, who acknowledged Tony's growth with a nod, while Tony, observing Meekeye's near mishap, remained composed. Their silent understanding spoke volumes about their evolving bond.|"[""1.

Tony made a solemn vow to act foolish, clueless, and silent. He then inquired the Indian about the strangers, but learned only that Petawanaquat had spotted them near his home, and they appeared to be traders. The Indian painted Tony's face and hair to disguise him. The next morning, a missionary arrived to spread the message of Christ. Despite the missionary's efforts, the family remained unresponsive. The missionary left feeling disheartened but hopeful. Petawanaquat had wrestled with moral dilemmas, realizing the injustice of his revenge. His conscience grappled with the concept of forgiveness and the teachings of Christ, leaving him conflicted between the sweetness of vengeance and the righteousness of forgiveness.|['1.

The missionary's visit had a profound impact on Petawanaquat, opening his eyes to the concept of showing kindness in the face of adversity. Learning about the Savior's sacrifice for His enemies led to a significant shift in the red man's beliefs. The seeds of this new perspective took root and bore fruit even in the winter, blossoming into action by spring. Tony, despite his painted appearance, symbolized this transformation. The Indian family, including three dogs, packed up their belongings on horse-drawn poles, resembling a makeshift cart, and set off towards Red River settlement. Meanwhile, Ian Macdonald, recovering from a grizzly bear encounter, and his companions, Vic Ravenshaw and Michel Rollin, found themselves stranded in the wilderness due to Ian's injuries. With no doctors nearby, they built a shelter and awaited Ian's recovery before embarking on their journey home.|"[""1.

The next day, the three friends found the river they sought. They traded their horse for a canoe and supplies from a friendly Indian family. As they journeyed by water, they faced challenges. They navigated the swollen river expertly until a series of mishaps occurred. They hit a snag, broke a paddle, and nearly capsized in a rapid. Finally, disaster struck when they crashed into a large rock, breaking the canoe and tossing them into the water. Despite the rough ordeal, they were rescued by the Indian boy who led them to his father's wigwam. The kind Indian provided them with provisions and a bow and arrows, but they had to continue their journey on foot.

Victor, overjoyed at finding his brother safe, approached the Indian with a friendly gesture, which was reciprocated with a handshake and the word ""Wat-chee!"" A settler then emerged from the woods, updating them on the settlement's condition after a disastrous flood. Upon hearing news about their loved ones, Michel Rollin, eager to find his missing family, prepared to set out on canoes with his companions. As they paddled towards the settlement, Peegwish, an Indian fond of fishing, found solace in his favorite pastime, casting his line out of the window thanks to the floodwaters.

Mr. Ravenshaw's large pig was swept out of the loft by the stream. Passing under the storeroom window, it encountered Peegwish's line. Tails tend to shut down when touched, and the pig's tail obeyed, leading to a comical situation. Peegwish and Wildcat tried to help, but the pig was too heavy to haul in. The women watched in horror and amusement as the pig's shrieks filled the air. Meanwhile, the wanderers navigated through submerged homesteads, encountering swallows and yellow birds.

The event brought back memories for the young man, particularly of a recent conversation with the owner of a smoking-box. While lost in thought, a commotion caused by their distressed hen, Beauty, interrupted him. Ian discovered that Beauty had gotten tangled in ropes meant for a boat Angus intended to sail on Lake Winnipeg. After freeing the hen, Ian felt a strange sensation as the house began to float due to rising floodwaters. Quickly, he secured a rope to prevent the house from drifting away. Ian then formulated a plan to fulfill a seemingly impossible task set by the smoking-box owner to win his daughter's hand. As he prepared in the attic, a realization dawned on him about the challenge of achieving the task unaided.

Ian acted swiftly and decisively when he encountered Peegwish, swiftly overpowering the savage and binding him tightly. With a rope, Ian secured Peegwish to a chair, creating a makeshift restraint. As Ian made his escape by boat, he faced challenges navigating the floodwaters. The house he left behind threatened to drift off course, potentially into dangerous currents. Ian's intense focus and physical strength were put to the test as he struggled to keep the house on track. Despite his efforts, the house continued to veer off course, leading to a desperate battle against the powerful currents.

In a thrilling moment of crisis, Ian steers the house back on course, feeling a surge of hope in his heart. Despite his chest heaving with exhaustion, he pulls hard to correct the house's path. After a tense few minutes, his efforts pay off, and the house moves steadily in the right direction. Just like in life's battles, there are pauses for reflection in the midst of struggles. Ian nears his goal, but the risks grow as he faces diverging currents. With the house almost at the knoll, success seems within reach. However, the currents pose a new challenge. Despite his anxiety, Ian navigates the punt skillfully. Finally, the house reaches the smoking-box, a few feet away from victory. Yet, the final stretch poses unforeseen challenges.

"""Hush! Be quiet!"" exclaimed the polite daughter, jumping from her wet bed into the water, showing no emotion except a sharp gasp as the cold water touched her skin. ""There's nothing wrong with your legs, I just tied them to the table to prevent them from falling off."" ""No, he hasn't returned yet, but he'll be back soon, no doubt. Now, be quiet like good children. I can't let your legs down yet, the floor is very wet. There!"" she untied the ropes and adjusted the limbs comfortably, ""just leave them where they are, and I'll give you breakfast in a moment."" As she served the morning meal, the anxious woman quickly ate a bite or two herself while moving around. Then she informed the elderly couple that she was going up the chimney to explore. Without hesitation, she climbed into the fireplace and vanished up the chimney. Upon reaching the top, she was surprised to find the cottage no longer floating on a wide sea but in a calm basin surrounded by trees near Lake Winnipeg. The hut had drifted during the night and become entangled in the woods. It was now completely surrounded by foliage, held in place by a sturdy branch that had caught the roof. Old Liz, who struggled with deep thinking, impulsively climbed a tall tree for a better view. Despite her torn clothes and bleeding hands, she stood at the top, observing two moving specks on the horizon, likely boats or canoes."|['1.

Down came old Liz, much faster than she went up; slipping, scratching, rending, grasping, and clutching, until she gained the chimney, down which she went unceremoniously, alighting as formerly, with a squash which not only alarmed but besprinkled the old couple. Liz caught up the rod, tied an apron to it, and then, using it as a lance, charged the fireplace. It stuck, of course, but Liz was in no mood to be baffled. She bent the rod powerfully and forced it up. Following it, she emerged from the chimney, and, with a spirit worthy of Excelsior, bore her banner to the tall tree-top, and fastened it to the topmost bough with the last remnant of her torn neckerchief. Victor Ravenshaw and his friends arrived at the settlement in the morning. Michel Rollin set off alone in a canoe in search of his mother. He paddled wildly at first but then made straight for the mission station, where he found Mr. Cockran's family encamped. Advised to go to the Mountain, Rollin paddled away with diminishing hopes.

Old Liz abruptly stopped her movements and listened intently, her expression a mix of surprise and recognition. The familiar shout echoed memories of days gone by, bringing tears and laughter. As she gestured wildly, the branch she stood on gave way, sending her tumbling through the tree's foliage and into the water. Michel, witnessing her fall, rushed to her aid in a canoe. Despite the chaos of the moment, their reunion was filled with love and joy. Winklemann, joining them, rescued both from the water and led them to safety.

It was nighttime when they arrived at the settlers' camp on Little Mountain. The homeless individuals were busy with their dinner, and despite their unfortunate situation, the scene did not appear distressing. The weather was pleasant, campfires illuminated the area, revealing content bronzed men, attractive women, and robust children. Laughter filled the air, showing that children are often oblivious to hardships, and adults can momentarily forget in times of comfort. The camp erupted in cheers as Winklemann's canoe emerged from the darkness, bringing the good news of the elderly folks' rescue. Ian Macdonald secured his father's house on the knoll and decided to visit Little Mountain to inform his father.

""I believe you've suffered,"" Elsie replied gently, ""but you're well now, and that doesn't justify being rude to old friends or losing interest in everything.""

The Little Mountain was not a towering peak but a gentle rise on the flat prairie. Children at the campsite brought life with their joyful play. To them, the recent floods were just a grand adventure. No lessons, no rules - just pure fun! Mr. Ravenshaw, watching from his tent, felt a mix of joy and sorrow.

After coming out, the man put on a fake calm look and ordered tea. The group happily gathered around the campfire as the flames danced in the darkening sky.

Ian claimed a promise from Mr. Ravenshaw, who had to agree due to his reputation. Petawanaquat, hearing Tony's name, looked lovingly at his son. Everyone laughed at Tony's seriousness.

Ian approached his father, placing a hand on his shoulder, and shared the news that he had moved their house to Mr. Ravenshaw's knoll from Willow Creek. Additionally, he revealed his proposal to Elsie Ravenshaw, which she accepted. The reactions of the party, especially of old Ravenshaw and Angus, upon hearing this news were indescribable. The Red River settlement faced devastation from flooding, resembling a scene of wreckage with destroyed houses, uprooted trees, and scattered belongings. Despite the destruction, the resilient inhabitants returned to rebuild their homes and resume their agricultural work. Peegwish, a native inhabitant, spent his time fishing leisurely, while Angus Macdonald struggled with a stubborn ox during post-flood recovery efforts.

Daddy, with a strong memory for the past, doubted the flood's recurrence. He mentioned floods in 1766, 1790, and 1809. The cottages at Willow Creek are new, close to each other, and similar. They are surrounded by fields with cattle and sheep. Inside, the homes lack ornamentation but reflect the refinement of women. Ian and Louis built the cottages after the flood quickly. The couples, after weddings and celebrations, visited each other's homes frequently. Shon Flett's family narrowly escaped the flood by floating on oxen-tied planks. A house set adrift on fire was a remarkable sight. The flood was likely caused by heavy rains, sudden winter freeze, and spring thaw.

Petawanaquat sat with a book, looking dignified yet slightly puzzled. Sinclair, his friend, taught him to read the Word of God.
