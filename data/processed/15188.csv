They recalled a promised trip to Yellowstone Park or a wilderness hunt if they succeeded, eagerly discussing their preference for the hunt.

"Jerry, too, either felt shocked at the enormous size of the wonderful hunting-knife, or else pretended to be. He shrugged his shoulders in that scornful way he had, and turned his back on the prize Bluff had drawn. ""What else could you expect of a man who goes after quail with a Gatling gun?

The workers increased their efforts, raising buckets of water in an endless chain. It was amazing how much water they could move. Will didn't join but used his flashlight to capture the scene. Some were startled by the light, but others explained. Opinions varied on the bridge's condition. As the passengers rushed back to the train, the engineer whistled. The cowboys helped with the luggage. The group followed Mr. Mabie to his ranch, surrounded by wild scenery. Bluff was eager to check his trunk. The ranch had various women and a Chinese cook.

The boys at the Big M Ranch were in for an unexpected thrill. As they prepared the horses, a mounted cowboy raced in with urgent news. Mr. Mabie explained that a grizzly bear, known as 'Mountain Charlie,' had strayed dangerously close, dragging off a yearling. The boys, inexperienced in the wild, were quickly briefed on the situation. The cowboys sprang into action, saddling up with determination. Jerry marveled at the sight of the brave ponies ready to face the formidable grizzly. The boys, though confident riders back home, were about to learn the true test of horsemanship in the rugged West. The tension was palpable as they braced themselves for a daring encounter with the wild beast.|"[""1.

Jerry's prediction came true. The cowboys successfully cornered the grizzly, preventing its escape to the mountain. Reluctant to abandon its prey, the bear was lassoed by the cowboys, forming a triangle to restrain its movements. The grizzly, in a frenzy, snarled and foamed, displaying its deadly claws and teeth.

Before leaving camp, Bluff asked many questions to understand the surrounding area. He was cautious of the wind direction to not alert any potential prey. Climbing rocks and passing through dense woods, he remained alert for game signs. Bluff wasn't a skilled hunter before but had studied and wanted to showcase his knowledge. He amusingly crawled closer to the elk, making some unconventional moves. When the elk unexpectedly charged, Bluff, startled, forgot about his gun. After a chase, he remembered his weapon and used it, finally managing to bring down the elk.

Bluff was thrilled to see his loop over the gun barrel. With a quick jerk, he pulled the weapon within reach. The elk started to move, but Bluff's feint made it angry again. As the elk fell, Bluff realized it had breathed its last. He bled the elk before heading back to camp. Bluff hoped to bring the elk back with help. The stockman praised the boys' hunting skills. Frank soaked up information eagerly. Bluff recounted his adventure, from shooting the elk to climbing a tree. Confused, Bluff couldn't find the elk later.

"Frank quickly grasped the stockman's intentions. Bluff's claims of the elk's demise should have left visible evidence.

Frank and his friends returned to camp after a day of hunting. Frank was deep in thought, pondering the mystery of why the Crees stole the elk they had hunted.

Jerry hiked up the hill, reaching a spot where he could see the water cascading over the edge with a thunderous roar.

Billy sat still. Only Frank saw Bluff move when he lifted his gun.

Frank observed his friends suspiciously, wondering if there was a secret between them. However, Mr. Mabie intervened, cautioning them to avoid any mischief. Later, strange cries were heard in the woods, possibly from panther cubs searching for their mother. Mr. Mabie hoped the cubs were old enough to fend for themselves. He expressed disdain for panthers due to livestock losses. Despite Mr. Mabie's absence due to rheumatism, the group prepared to embark on a thrilling boat ride down the rapids. Reddy would take Mr. Mabie's place. Bluff was reminded not to be reckless, as the group prepared for their exciting adventure.|"[""1.

Reddy was chosen as the guide for the group, having good knowledge of the area and the elk's habits. As they ventured further, Will lagged behind, engrossed in capturing the scenery with his camera.

In the morning, the camp was about to be abandoned. Tents were taken down while the group had breakfast, packing everything into small bundles for the pack horses. Will planned to position himself midway down the shore to capture the bullboats in action. As the first boat navigated successfully, the second boat, carrying the two friends, faced trouble. They either hit a rock or misjudged the current, ending up stranded on rocks in the rapids. The situation was a mix of comedy and danger. Despite the predicament, they found humor in their plight, comparing themselves to figures of luck.

Frank and his friends found themselves in a challenging situation near some rapids. Jerry, one of the group, ended up in the water and needed help getting out. The cowboy, Reddy, came to their rescue by using a clothesline to pull Jerry to safety. Despite some struggles, Jerry was eventually brought back to dry land. After the ordeal, they made a fire to dry off and enjoyed a meal together. The group discussed the dry weather and its impact on the ranch.

"""I won't ask you which man it was, Frank; but I must warn them again to be more than ordinarily careful about throwing matches around and leaving a fire burning anywhere in the woods. Many a grand forest has been ruined by such carelessness,"" he said.

""It is easy. The careless hunter or trapper leaves his dying fire when he breaks camp. Then up comes a sudden wind and some of the red cinders are blown into the dead leaves or punk grass.

""We certainly will, sir,"" replied Frank sincerely. ""Not to speak of the damage done, it must be mighty unpleasant to be caught in a forest fire. I've read of such things, but never hankered for a personal experience.""

Frank knew that a loud shout would likely bring Jerry to him. He had a reason for asking the Indian boy for help and observed his reaction closely. Perhaps Frank exaggerated his distress to ensure Jerry's sympathy. The boy agreed to help, leading Frank to a camp by the river. Frank noticed signs of the Crees' camp and their lack of weapons for hunting. He learned that the Crees were chased out of their village and were struggling to find food. Although puzzled why they hadn't sought help from others, Frank understood their pride. The Crees hoped to regain their standing among their people, led by their chief Running Elk.

Frank's expression turned serious as the wind grew stronger by the minute. The possibility of a brush fire sparked concern. Frank suspected a camper had left a fire that was now spreading due to the rising wind. As they ran, the wind howled through the trees, and distant crackling turned into a menacing roar.

Frank and Will were in a dangerous situation, trying to escape from a forest fire. Frank was worried about having to tell Violet that her brother Will had died. They hurried towards the river to escape the fire, pushing their belongings into a hiding spot. As they plunged into the river to cool off, they realized their clothes were on fire.
