The Deveril children were thrilled to receive an invitation from their former nurse to spend the day at her cottage. The kind nurse, who had recently married a gardener and had no children of her own, loved entertaining the children she once cared for.

When the kids returned inside, they discovered their beloved uncle had come from London, suggesting an early dinner and a trip to Carisbrooke. Excited, they forgot everything else. Even when Jimmie changed his outfit, he didn't think about the captive crab. Their visit to the old castle was delightful. Jimmie, not a big fan of learning, became eager to learn more about King Charles and his imprisonment. He had a dream that night where he was a prisoner in a sand grotto with a giant crab jailor. The dream mixed with reality as a crab crawled over his pillow. Startled, Jimmie screamed until his sister, Daisy, took the crab away. The next morning, Jimmie released the crab by the shore. He learned that bad company can lead to trouble, just like the cats who stole cheese in a barn and caused innocent cats to be blamed.|"['1.

However, there were exceptions; he didn't rush to start his lessons or go to bed. One thing he had to wait for was growing up.

"In a distant land where French is spoken, it's hard to fathom what goes unbroken! Amidst the chatter, can anyone decipher such clatter? Perhaps it's English they speak, don't you think? In a place where clergymen are black, uttering sounds like a ""choke-a-cockatoo"" knack. Rows of folks with scanty wear, I wonder, wouldn't you dare? To a realm where women can't stroll, where all's bamboo, and eyes are small. Surviving on rice and tea, a sight I wish to see. A land where wild elephants roam, never knowing of a zoo home. Strolling like lords in the woods, a peek would be good, wouldn't it, wouldn't you? Mrs. Ferrars, anxious but trusting, lets Dolly go skating, the last day at home, a joyous outing. The frozen lake bustling with skaters, Ralph and Dolly spot friends, no haters. Dolly yearns for a new path, the ice glistening, trees bending in a wintry bath. A sword-like icicle catches her eye, as Frank and Dolly rush by. But danger lurks beneath the ice, Frank's warning concise. They retreat to safety, the thrill of adventure, a lesson in caution, a memory to treasure."|"['1.
