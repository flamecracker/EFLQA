We will delay our journey west until next spring. Initially, Father planned to leave right away, but upon learning that Arnold Baxter was safely in jail and could no longer trouble him, he decided to stay with Uncle Randolph and Aunt Martha until the following spring to regain his strength after his hardships in Africa had weakened him considerably. Meanwhile, I am happy that you will be here during the winter. Next summer, Mother has promised to accompany me on a trip to Buffalo and around the Great Lakes. Hopefully, the fresh lake air will benefit her health, and we hope to avoid any encounters with Mr. Crabtree while we are on the water. As the others headed up the hill where the road split into three directions, Joel Darwell pointed out two newly dug holes about fifteen feet apart. Everyone began searching for clues to identify the wrongdoers, except Joel and his helper, who were busy securing the posts and boards firmly in place. Tom and Sam noticed a coin similar to those they had from Africa, raising suspicions. Captain Putnam arrived and inquired about the injuries of Dick and Frank, expressing his desire to catch the culprit behind the mishap. Sam and Tom followed footprints leading to the lake, while the rest prepared for the evening feast.

"A few hours later, Tom and Dick brought the colored man to the Stanhope cottage. Mrs. Stanhope and Dora welcomed him warmly. Pop had a pistol and a war club from Africa, ready to defend. Everything was peaceful until Josiah Crabtree's trial. The Rover boys, Dora, and her uncle went to the county seat for the trial. Crabtree surprisingly got six months in jail instead of several years in prison. On their way back, Dick couldn't believe it and thought Crabtree must have influenced the judge. Despite the disappointment, they knew Crabtree would be away for some time. Snowball fights started, and everyone had fun. The lake froze, and they prepared to skate. Frank decided to build an ice-boat, and with the help of friends, they constructed the ""Fiver."" They used their manual training skills to build the boat quickly."|"['1.

On a cloudy Saturday, the boys excitedly prepared an ice-boat for a trip on the lake. The other cadets watched with interest, eager for their own turns later. The group pushed the ice-boat through a snowstorm, but suddenly the ice cracked, sending the boat into the water! Startled, they hurried away from the dangerous spot. As they regrouped, a playful snow fight ensued. Lost in the snowstorm, they found shelter in a rundown building. The wind intensified, making them grateful for the meager protection. The storm grew fiercer, causing the old barn to shake violently. A deafening crash followed, sending debris flying. Terrified, they sought refuge in the hay, feeling as if the world was ending.|['1.

Kennedy left his interest in the mine to me, but Baxter claimed it as his own, falsely stating he found it alone. We couldn't locate the mine near Bumble Bee Creek, now called Larkspur. In those days, Colorado was unsettled, and names changed often. Dick feared Baxter's interference, knowing Baxter could cause trouble. The conversation was cut short by a late supper call. The boys, eager to learn more, heard of a midnight intruder incident involving Arnold Baxter. The boys were cautioned to keep quiet around Baxter, who was ill. Jack Wumble's help was sought for the trip. Plans were made for the boys to leave for Chicago on Monday. They prepared, wrote letters, and attended church before departing. Despite worries, they embarked on the journey with hope and strength.|"[""1.

"During dinner time, they entered the dining car but couldn't sit together. Tom sat across from a burly man who shared tales of his travels to San Francisco, New York, and mining districts.

Once again, Baxter tried to hit, but missed. Tom then landed a blow on Baxter's ear, making him dizzy. Realizing he had enough, Baxter ran off down the street. Tom then turned to help Dick and Henry Bradner. After a discussion with Dick, they decided to let go of the matter and left Henry Bradner behind. The next day, they headed to Gunnison, a small mining city. The boys, accompanied by their friend, began a journey along the foothills, leaving the city behind. They were cautious of Dan Baxter's father, Arnold Baxter, and the dangers of the wild country. The trail was challenging, with rocks and watercourses to cross. Despite warnings, they continued their journey, preparing a meal in a protected hollow. They were advised to return to Gunnison to avoid trouble, but they decided to press on towards Larkspur Creek, aware of the risks.|"['1.

Jack Wumble added, ""We shouldn't move forward. We'd be worse than fools with those dangerous men watching us."" The boys trusted Wumble's knowledge of the area and agreed to follow his plan to reach Larkspur Creek. They rested in the shade for hours as the old miner smoked his pipe.

Later, Bill Noxton approached, offering to introduce Tom to some Englishmen camping nearby. As they made their way down the hillside, they stopped at a cliff overlooking a river.

The elder Rover descended down, snagging his clothes on bushes, until he plunged into the stream with a loud splash and vanished. Wumble, hearing the splash, joined him at the edge of the bushes, but the cliff obstructed their view. The experienced miner cautiously descended the cliff using his prospecting skills. Meanwhile, Dick tumbled to the stream's bottom, disoriented by the cold water. He was swept towards a narrow canyon where the water churned over rocks. Exhausted, he struggled to reach a strip of sand. Feeling trapped, he pondered their ill-fated expedition. After resting, he explored the sand strip and the canyon, eventually climbing up cautiously. Fearful of falling, he climbed higher, only to stumble into a large cave, surprised by this unexpected turn of events.|"['1.

Fortunately, the boys had their waterproof match safes from Africa. Dick used one to light a torch from the dry bush. Feeling the cave had no side paths, he ventured deeper, hoping for another way out. The cave was dry with dead leaves and branches, hinting at an entrance. As he walked, he noticed a light in the distance. Cautiously, he moved towards daylight, remembering the growl he heard. Suddenly, he spotted two glowing eyes nearby. With the bear behind him, Dick sprinted out of the cave, using the torch to keep the animal at bay. Climbing a rock, he escaped the bear's pursuit.|"['1.

The bear cautiously approached the cave's mouth, spotting the boy on a rock. It growled fiercely, circling the rock to assess the situation. Suddenly, it reared up and headed straight for the boy, causing his heart to race. With a scream, the boy thrust a torch at the bear's face, causing it to retreat.

Tom realized he needed to act swiftly. He examined the wide chimney, open to the sky, and spotted a tree branch. Determined to climb it, he made his way up the sooty chimney easily. Once at the top, he grasped the tree limb, pulling himself up. The branch swayed but held his weight as he reached the trunk. Tom swiftly moved to another tree further from the house. He leaped into it, crossed to a drooping branch over bushes, and stealthily descended. Crawling like a snake, he navigated around a rock and thorns. As he ran to his horse, Arnold Baxter and his men pursued. Shots were fired, but Tom evaded them, leaving his pursuers behind. At sunset, Tom sought refuge in a small wood for the night.

Tom and his friends embarked on a mission to track down a group of thieves. Tom, unsure of the trail, offered to lead the men back to the thieves' camp, a deserted house with a wide chimney and big trees nearby. The men, equipped with rations, mounted their horses and set out. During the pursuit, one of the thieves, Noxton, attempted to flee but was shot in the leg by one of the men. As the group continued their chase, the remaining thieves, the Baxters, fled into the woods. Despite being wounded, the thieves managed to escape for the time being.

After a good night's rest, they were up early. Slim Jim knew a shortcut to the creek, better than the old miner's trail. Over two days, they traversed hills, mountains, canyons, and valleys filled with pines and firs. The boys marveled at the scenery, momentarily forgetting their enemies. As they tried to stake their claim, a shot wounded Dick's hand, fired by Arnold Baxter. Tom retaliated, hitting Arnold in the shoulder. Rain poured down, and their enemies began rolling rocks towards them. Seeking shelter, they followed Slim Jim through the brush in the heavy rain and thunderstorm.|"['1.
