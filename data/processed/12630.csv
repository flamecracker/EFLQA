Old Mother West Wind had just come down from the Purple Hills and set free her children, the Merry Little Breezes, from a big bag. They danced and raced across the Green Meadows, happy to be back. Old Mother West Wind wanted to join them, feeling young and carefree in springtime. But she had work to do, like pumping water for Farmer Brown's cows. Meanwhile, Jimmy Skunk saw Old Mr. Toad in a hurry, which was unusual. Mr. Toad explained he had an important role in the spring chorus and was on his way to sing, claiming to have a beautiful voice. This amused Jimmy Skunk, who couldn't believe Mr. Toad's self-praise and burst into laughter.|"['1.

When Jimmy Skunk couldn't stop laughing, he saw Old Mr. Toad hopping down the path towards the Smiling Pool. Puzzled, Jimmy watched as Mr. Toad claimed he had a beautiful voice and needed to join the spring chorus. Peter Rabbit joined them, finding Jimmy lost in thought. They laughed at the idea of Mr. Toad singing. Unc' Billy Possum, wise and shrewd, suggested they might have underestimated Mr. Toad. While he didn't believe Mr. Toad could sing, he thought Mr. Toad might believe he could. Curious, they decided to head to the Smiling Pool to uncover the truth about Mr. Toad's mysterious behavior.|"['1.

Jimmy Skunk, Peter Rabbit, and Unc' Billy Possum decided to follow Old Mr. Toad. Peter led the way, followed by Unc' Billy, and Jimmy Skunk lagged behind. Old Mr. Toad was slow compared to the others because he could only make short hops, unlike his cousin Grandfather Frog, who could leap far. While they followed, they stopped to search for beetles for Jimmy Skunk and sweet clover for Peter. They even delayed to look for Carol the Meadow Lark's nest, but it was too early for eggs. The group played with the Merry Little Breezes and lost sight of Old Mr. Toad. When they reached the Smiling Pool, he was nowhere to be found. They split up to search for him along the bank but had no luck. Peter speculated that spring might have made Old Mr. Toad behave oddly. Mr. Redwing, overhearing, explained that Old Mr. Toad was crucial for the spring chorus.|"[""1.

Peter Rabbit sometimes envies the birds in spring because they can sing to express their joy, unlike him who can only kick his heels. While Peter finds satisfaction in his antics, he knows that sharing joy with others adds to his own happiness. Hearing the Meadow Lark, Song Sparrow, Bluebird, Robin, and even Sammy Jay singing beautifully fills Peter with wonder.

They had never imagined that Old Mr. Toad could sing so beautifully. His music bag under his chin was the secret to his melodious songs.

Old Mr. Toad sang joyfully as the sun set, his beautiful eyes catching Peter's attention. Mr. Toad shared a tale about his family's beautiful eyes and the wisdom of being prepared even in peaceful times. As the evening settled, the Smiling Pool was filled with the songs of hylas, frogs, and Mr. Toad, celebrating the arrival of spring. Amidst the tranquility, Mr. Toad's keen observation led him to spot a mysterious object heading towards them. He immediately stopped singing, signaling all the creatures to hush. The once lively chorus fell silent, echoing the sudden darkness that enveloped the Green Forest.

"Over the Smiling Pool, the shadow floated back and forth, but no living thing was in sight. ""Hooty the Owl missed us this time,"" chuckled Old Mr. Toad. Then, he sang, and the chorus resumed joyously. The Smiling Pool is like a kindergarten where Joe Otter's and Jerry Muskrat's children learn to swim, along with Billy Mink's, Trout's, and Minnow's babies. Peter Rabbit knew about Frog babies but was puzzled about Toad babies. He recalled seeing tiny Toads on rainy days, similar to Old Mr. Toad. As Peter visited Old Mr. Toad, he noticed him watching wriggling tadpoles. Grandfather Frog boasted about his babies, sparking a dispute with Old Mr. Toad, but Peter stayed silent, finding beauty in none of the pollywogs."|"[""1.

In the lively Smiling Pool kindergarten, the pollywogs of Grandfather Frog, Old Mr. Toad, and Stickytoes the Tree Toad were busy growing and learning. Peter Rabbit, initially uninterested, found himself fascinated by their development. Observing the pollywogs closely, Peter realized they faced dangers from bugs, fish, and even Longlegs the Blue Heron. Despite the threats, the pollywogs were quick and vigilant, constantly swimming, eating, and growing. Peter was amazed to witness a pollywog regrow a lost tail, highlighting their remarkable abilities. Jerry, another observer, marveled at the rapid growth of the Toad youngsters, noting how they would soon transform into Toads and leave the Smiling Pool.

Peter observed a pollywog sprouting fore legs, making it look funny. He had not visited the Smiling Pool for a while but decided to check on the pollywogs. As he ran towards the pool, rain started to fall, and suddenly tiny Toads surrounded him. Surprised, Peter watched as they hopped around. Continuing towards the pool, he met Old Mr. Toad, who explained that the little Toads knew rainy weather was good for traveling. They had left the pool at night and hid until the rain, then emerged to explore.

In a short while, Old Mr. Toad managed to free himself from his old suit, pulling it off slowly. He struggled to swallow it with his mouth full, glaring at Peter who burst into laughter at the sight. Once his hands were freed, he pulled the suit over his head and gulped hard to swallow it. Peter felt sorry for laughing and apologized to Mr. Toad, expressing his amazement at the transformation. Mr. Toad, still a bit annoyed, explained that he wouldn't undertake such a journey just to return to the Smiling Pool. He scolded Peter for speaking before thinking and claimed he could vanish instantly. Peter, skeptical, couldn't see where Mr. Toad could hide.|"['1.

"Old Mr. Toad's mischievous eyes gleamed with delight. He saw an opportunity to play a trick on Peter for witnessing his suit change. ""If you turn around and focus on the Crooked Little Path for five minutes, I'll vanish,"" he proposed. ""And I promise not to move more than three feet from where I am sitting."" Peter agreed and fixed his gaze down the path, fighting the urge to peek. When the time was up, he turned around, but Old Mr. Toad was nowhere to be found. Peter searched frantically but found no trace. Feeling foolish, Peter pondered how the toad had disappeared, finding it inexplicable. Suddenly, a voice startled Peter, coming from beneath him.

Old Mr. Toad was quite mischievous. He delighted in showing Peter his unique skill of disappearing into the ground using his hind feet, equipped with spurs. Peter was astonished to see Mr. Toad vanish before his eyes, only to reappear by backing into a hole he dug in soft earth. Mr. Toad's method was fascinating. He demonstrated how he kicked the earth out while backing in, and the loose soil fell back over him, concealing him completely. Peter was grateful for the demonstration and asked Mr. Toad another question.

"Jimmy Skunk was out for a stroll, enjoying the arrival of Summer. He was amused by Peter Rabbit's eagerness for the season. As he ambled along, his sharp eyes caught sight of a piece of bark that he thought might hide beetles. Just as he was about to investigate, a grumpy voice interrupted him. It was Old Mr. Toad, who was napping under the bark. Jimmy, taken by surprise, apologized and asked about beetles. The encounter led to a conversation where Old Mr. Toad shared his concern about Mr. Blacksnake, who had shown an interest in toads. Startled, Old Mr. Toad rushed off without asking for details. Unfortunately, he ran into Mr. Blacksnake on the path, as he was too focused on looking back in fear. This led to a risky situation, showing how a series of ""ifs"" can change the course of events."|['1.

Old Mr. Toad was hopping along the Crooked Little Path, trying to escape from Mr. Blacksnake. As he turned a corner, he almost bumped into Mr. Blacksnake. Both were surprised, but Mr. Toad was too scared to speak and quickly ran away. Mr. Blacksnake followed, knowing he could catch Mr. Toad easily.

Jimmy Skunk chuckled and stood in front of Old Mr. Toad. Mr. Blacksnake coiled in their path, sticking his tongue out at Jimmy rudely, trying to appear fierce. He lunged at Jimmy with his mouth wide open but purposely fell short, only trying to scare him. Jimmy, however, was unfazed. Knowing Mr. Blacksnake was a coward, he gritted his teeth and advanced towards him, causing Mr. Blacksnake to retreat hissing. Meanwhile, Old Mr. Toad and Buster Bear have a peculiar taste for ants.

Buster Bear led the way, and Old Mr. Toad followed quickly. Buster stopped by a decayed log, inviting Mr. Toad to dine. Buster rolled the log, revealing a swarm of ants. Excited, Mr. Toad joined in, forgetting his fear and manners. Buster Bear enjoyed his own feast of ants. After eating his fill, Mr. Toad, puffed up with pride, hopped slowly down the path.
