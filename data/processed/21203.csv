In Farmer Green's garden lived an unusual old creature known as Grandfather Mole. He resided in a mound he dug himself, spending most of his time underground. Despite being nearly blind, Grandfather Mole had an exceptional ability to find food, mainly angleworms, through his intricate network of tunnels. His small eyes only distinguished light from dark, and his ears were hidden but functional. Grandfather Mole was content with his unique abilities, using his long nose and front legs like a drill to navigate through the soil effortlessly. Meanwhile, the cat at Farmer Green's was a skilled hunter, feared by mice and rats alike for her hunting prowess. She often ignored the milk set out for her and ventured outside to hunt for her meals.|"[""1.

Early one morning, while crossing the garden on her way to the meadow, Miss Kitty encountered Grandfather Mole. Despite his blindness, she decided to forego her breakfast and play with him in the garden. The pleasure-seeking cat enjoyed capturing and releasing Grandfather Mole multiple times, pretending he almost escaped each time. While the cat found it entertaining, Grandfather Mole did not appreciate the game. When Grandfather Mole suddenly disappeared, the puzzled cat blamed Mr. Crow for distracting her. Although she didn't quite understand Mr. Crow's words, she pretended to, not wanting to appear foolish. Still upset, the cat left for the meadow without acknowledging Mr. Crow.|"['1.

Mr. Crow found the whole situation amusing and stayed cheerful all day. He shared the tale of Grandfather Mole escaping under the cat's nose by digging under the garden. Grandfather Mole was halfway done when he emerged near the cabbage-patch due to a gap left by Farmer Green's hired man's hoe. Recognizing Jimmy Rabbit's voice, Grandfather Mole felt safe and knew he was in the cabbage-patch. He swiftly disappeared underground, promising to meet Jimmy Rabbit at the duck-pond. Jimmy Rabbit, waiting for him, was relieved when Grandfather Mole finally emerged, ready for a lunch of clover-tops. Jimmy Rabbit marveled at Grandfather Mole's swimming skills, noticing his webbed hind feet, perfect for navigating the duck-pond.|"[""1.

Jimmy Rabbit was fascinated watching Grandfather Mole swim. He only started running around the pond when Grandfather Mole was almost across. Jimmy raced along the edge to meet him, as he had forgotten they had plans. Despite waiting for Grandfather Mole to finish swimming, Jimmy didn't mention it. Instead, he politely said he would keep up. Grandfather Mole preferred the darkness of his tunnels and wanted his coat dry to avoid dirt. Eventually, they set off together, with Jimmy hurrying to the meadow for lunch. He decided he wouldn't invite Grandfather Mole for a walk again. Jimmy realized he had the advantage of finding angleworms easily underground, unlike the birds. Mrs. Jolly Robin wished she could hunt like Grandfather Mole, especially with a greedy young Cowbird in her nest.|"['1.

Mrs. Robin was in a rush to feed her hungry family, but Grandfather Mole was nowhere to be found. Eventually, Grandfather Mole emerged, explaining that he had just finished his lunch and needed to hunt for angleworms. Due to his fear of hawks and owls, Grandfather Mole preferred to stay underground during the day and night. He enjoyed digging in the dark and feasting on worms and grubs. While some of his bird neighbors shared his taste for worms, others preferred the bright sunshine. A Worm-eating Warbler suspected Grandfather Mole of causing a worm shortage and wished he would stay above ground.

"Grandfather Mole turned his head towards the speaker, unable to see him but sensing his presence. He disliked the Worm-eating Warbler's comments. ""Why not join me underground for the cool, dark air? It's good for you. I've thrived below for ages,"" Grandfather Mole retorted, leaving the Warbler speechless. The Warbler flew off, pondering the odd world and its inhabitants. Grandfather Mole, uncomfortable above ground, often returned to his burrow swiftly. One day, he emerged among the turnips, frantic and disoriented. Rusty Wren noticed his distress and offered help, but Grandfather Mole, too agitated to stop, urged Rusty Wren to leave quietly to avoid attracting unwanted attention, especially from the cat."|"[""1.

Rusty Wren was puzzled by Grandfather Mole's behavior and sought answers from his friends in hushed tones to avoid alerting the cat. They all agreed that there was a mystery surrounding Grandfather Mole, but no one knew what it was. Rusty Wren speculated that Grandfather Mole might have lost his bearings, leading to his erratic movements. The Worm-eating Warbler questioned Rusty Wren's suggestion, not understanding what bearings were. When the birds noticed Grandfather Mole's frantic actions, they wondered about his secret. Suddenly, Grandfather Mole's daughter emerged from a hole, prompting him to frantically dig to reach his grandchildren. Mrs. Jolly Robin worked tirelessly to feed her young and the Cowbird in her nest, while her husband gathered food with a renewed sense of purpose.

Grandfather Mole often overheard Mrs. Robin and her husband chatting in the garden. When Mrs. Robin exclaimed about finding a big angleworm, Grandfather Mole knew she meant to share it with the children. Mrs. Robin, not wanting to share with Grandfather Mole, aimed to catch the biggest angleworm. Grandfather Mole, hearing of this plan, offered unsolicited advice, irritating Mrs. Robin. Despite this, Grandfather Mole felt unappreciated when Mrs. Robin left without thanking him. Mrs. Robin, worried about her private conversations being shared, focused on finding worms for her young ones, ignoring her husband.
