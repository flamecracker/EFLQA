The sheep outsmarted the jackal, who was lured by dates in a sack. As the jackal tried to grab the dates, he was startled by two eyes in the sack and ran back to the sheep. The sheep then shared the dates with the jackal, who flew away after thanking her. The story continued with a family tale where the old man passed away, leaving his sons to seek their fortunes.

Scarcely had Jack's brothers filled their bags with silver when Jack discovered another door leading to a room filled with gold. Overwhelmed by the sight, they quickly exchanged their silver for the glittering gold. Feeling the weight of their newfound wealth, Martin suggested they leave before others arrived. Jack, however, stayed back to pocket some coins and have a bite to eat. Later, as they rested in a forest, hunger struck Martin, prompting Jack to return to the castle for food. While there, Jack decided to take enough gold to live comfortably. As he filled his makeshift bag with gold, a thunderous noise startled him. Two giants appeared, accusing Jack of theft. After a brief discussion, the giants spared Jack's life on the condition that he guard their treasures. Jack agreed, but soon grew weary of the task.

Once upon a time, Jack found himself alone and ambitious. He traded his table for a cornet, but soon regretted it when hunger struck. Cunningly, he used the cornet to summon soldiers for a feast.

The young fish was initially hesitant about embarking on the journey with the other fish, but she feared being left alone even more. With a wave of her tail, she signified her agreement, and they all set off together, a large group of hundreds. Observers on the rocks and ships marveled at the sight, unaware that the fish were heading to the queen’s palace. The land-dwellers had little understanding of the sea's depths. The new fish, too, was clueless about what lay below the surface. As she delved deeper, she encountered astonishing sights: gold wedges, precious pearls, valuable jewels, and even the remains of deceased individuals. After swimming for hours, the little fish arrived at the magnificent palace of the queen of the fishes. The palace was a spectacle to behold, with walls made of smooth pink coral adorned with rows of pearls. The queen, who possessed a human-like form, shared her tragic tale with the fish and revealed that she needed her crown back to reclaim her rightful place. She advised the fish to transform into a creature that could assist her in retrieving the crown. The fish transformed into a majestic beast with horns and legs, ready to face the challenges ahead.

The deer pleaded with the prince not to harm her, expressing a need to run far and complete important tasks. The prince, struck by her beauty, suspected she was an enchanted maiden.

Once upon a time, a king found himself at war with his neighbors, a kind man content with his own land. Defeated and forced to retreat behind his city walls, he sent his wife to a distant fortress for safety. The queen, unhappy and bored, longed to explore beyond the castle walls. Yearning for news of her husband, she felt trapped. Eventually, she decided to hunt near the forest, straying from her attendants.

As he stopped speaking, he touched a cow's forehead, and she walked down the path with two others beside her. Ardan, son of Gorla, followed, thrilled that the task seemed easy. He imagined having enough money by year's end to search for his sister in distant lands. Suddenly, a golden cock and a silver hen caught his eye, and he chased them, forgetting the cows. Exhausted, he turned back to find them grazing peacefully. Later, he saw golden and silver staves moving mysteriously, but he couldn't catch them. Tired, he ate fruits from a nearby tree. As the sun set, the cows headed home, led by Ardan. The maiden awaited them, but the milk she drew turned to water. The old man appeared, accusing Ardan of betrayal. He turned Ardan into stone as a warning. Ardan's family mourned, unaware of his fate. Ruais, the second son, then set out, repeating Ardan's actions and meeting the same end.

The door was open, and Covan entered. The old man and the golden-haired maiden welcomed him. Just like his brothers, he was asked to herd the cows by the old man, and the maiden advised against it. Despite his brothers' rude responses, Covan thanked her politely. The next day, he set out at dawn with the cows. Along the way, he faced temptations like the gold cock and silver hen, but he resisted. The cows led him to a burning heather moor and a foaming river. Covan followed them through challenges, and they finally reached a yellow stone house where sweet songs played. As they journeyed back, he noticed contrasting sights like fat and lean horses. Despite darkness and rain, Covan found shelter in a cave with the Dog of Maol-mor. The cows led him to a barren plain where they rested for the night. The black raven of Corri-nan-creag guided him to food and rest in a rock crevice. Covan rose at dawn, refreshed, ready to continue his journey with the cows.|"['1.

When Andras visited Vadso, a challenge was set. They must leap over a boat without touching it to win a prize. Andras cleared it easily, but the bailiff's heel brushed the boat.

Andras felt a cold shiver run down his spine, wishing he had the agility of a reindeer calf. These calves, once they start shedding their hair, become so swift that no creature can catch them. But even they are not as fast as the Stalo, as Andras discovered when he heard the pipe playing and feared for his life. Thinking quickly, he remembered two lakes connected by a river with a hidden stone. With a leap, he crossed the river, leading the Stalo to a fatal mistake. Andras shot him with an arrow, and as the Stalo lay dying, he made Andras promise to bury him honorably and spare his son. Andras then sailed across the fiord, defeated the Stalo's dog, and rescued the boy. With the Stalo's treasure, Andras bought a herd of reindeer and married a wealthy woman, living happily ever after.|"['1.

Once upon a time, in a kingdom far away, there lived a king named Balancin. He had suffered from a deep wound on his foot for a long time, despite the efforts of the best doctors in the land. Hearing of a miraculous healer in a distant city, the king convinced the doctor to come to him.

"The king was in distress, unable to explain his pain, only managing to utter, ""My shoe! my shoe!"" Sailors watched, bewildered, thinking him mad. Diamantina, noticing her father's gaze at the stream, saw something white dancing on the water, drifting further away.

When the sun shone upon him, he quickly rose and hurried to the pot. To his amazement, the plant had vanished, replaced by a thick syrup as the book had foretold. Carefully, he scooped the syrup with a spoon, spread it in the sun until it thickened, and then poured it into a crystal flask. After cleaning himself up and dressing in his finest attire, he tucked the flask into his pocket and headed towards the palace to meet the king urgently.

Once the old man vanished, Hans enjoyed a hearty meal and then slept until morning. He explored the rooms, questioning the odd task of spreading sand on the floors. Hans decided to tidy only his room, realizing no one checked the cleanliness of the other rooms.
