The Toscaneli Map was a guide used by Columbus on his voyage across the Atlantic. It resembled the Behaim Globe, which depicted the world in 1492 based on Toscanelli's map. The Behaim Globe showed no continent between Spain and Japan, with mythical islands bridging the gap. Maps from 1548 and 1745 reveal evolving knowledge about the world. Geographical discovery has been driven by a desire to conquer, trade, and explore. Captain Cook's voyages marked a shift towards scientific curiosity. The history of geographical discovery traces the gradual knowledge of lands beyond the Mediterranean. Exploration often relied on guides who knew the territories well. The European partition of Africa exemplifies the convergence of conquest, trade, and scientific motives in exploration. The history of geographical discovery is intertwined with the history of conquest and the spreading knowledge of the world.|"['1.

During the Middle Ages, much knowledge from ancient times was lost, and imagination and theory replaced it. The Arabs were the true inheritors of Greek science during this period and contributed to geographical knowledge. The discovery of America marked a new era in modern history and geography. In the last four hundred years, more of the world has been explored than in the previous four thousand years. This exploration has shaped modern society and will influence the future. Englishmen will play a significant role in addressing the challenges related to these discoveries. The Greeks learned about geography from the Phoenicians and Homer's poems. Homer imagined the world as a flat shield surrounded by a wide river called Ocean. These early conceptions influenced later views of the world. The Greeks likely got the idea of an encircling ocean from the Babylonians. They believed in seven zones or climates dividing the world, represented by islets on a map of Mesopotamia.|['1.

"After Homer and Hesiod, Greek knowledge expanded through colonization around the Eastern Mediterranean. Southern Italy still speaks a Greek dialect due to the vast Greek colonies there, known as ""Magna Grecia."" Marseilles, established in 600 B.C., sent colonies along the Gulf of Lyons. Greek cities dotted the Black Sea coast, with Byzantium being historically significant. Greeks also colonized North Africa and Aegean Sea islands. Anaximander of Miletus invented map-drawing in the 6th century B.C. The gnomon, attributed to Anaximander, helped determine latitude. Herodotus of Halicarnassus, known as the Father of History, extensively traveled and provided accurate information about Egypt, Babylonia, Persia, and Greece, also detailing Scythia and Persia's royal roads."|['1.

One of the intriguing tales he shares involves a group of five young men from the Nasamonians who embarked on a journey from Southern Libya, west of the Soudan. After traveling for numerous days to the west, they stumbled upon a grove of trees. To their surprise, they were captured by men of remarkably small stature. These captors guided them through marshes to a grand city inhabited by black men of similar size, with a large river flowing through it. Herodotus linked this city to the Nile, but based on the journey's description, it seems more likely to have been the Niger, suggesting that the Nasamonians might have reached Timbuctoo! Following Herodotus, Xenophon and Alexander's expeditions expanded Greek knowledge of Asia. Additionally, mariners' log-books revealed the Carthaginian admiral Hanno's voyage to Sierra Leone, where he encountered Gorillas. Another log-book by Scylax detailed sailing distances in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. These accounts, along with Alexander's admiral Nearchus navigating from the mouth of the Indus to the Arabian Gulf, and Hippalus discovering the monsoons' use for sailing from Arabia to India, enriched Greek geographical knowledge. Megasthenes' insights from his embassy to the Indian king of the Punjab and Pytheas' travels to Britain and Thule further broadened geographical understanding. Eratosthenes, the librarian of Alexandria, made significant contributions to scientific geography|"['1.

"After Eratosthenes' time, the Roman Empire expanded, taking over lands from Alexander and Carthaginians, reaching Gaul, Britain, and Germany. STRABO, a Greek writer around 20 B.C., refined Eratosthenes' ideas, rejecting Thule but acknowledging Ireland as the northernmost habitable place. A seaman's manual, the _Periplus_ of the Erythræan Sea, detailed coasts from Aden to the Ganges, impacting Ptolemy's later work. Ptolemy, around 150 A.D., synthesized ancient knowledge, introducing latitude and longitude. Despite errors, his work influenced geography for centuries, though later corrected. He also speculated on a vast southern land, influencing later explorations. Ptolemy's legacy remains significant, shaping astronomy and geography for over a millennium. His method of dividing the Earth into ""climates"" based on day length was pivotal for determining latitude, despite its simplicity."|"[""1.

In this chapter, I have briefly outlined the accomplishments and names of the Greek scholars who compiled the knowledge gained by traders, soldiers, and explorers about the known world in ancient times. Much of this information was acquired not through deliberate geographical exploration, but rather through military campaigns aimed at conquest. To understand how the Greeks and the Roman Empire acquired this knowledge, we need to delve into the various stages of conquest that led to the discovery of different regions in the Old World. The rise and progress of ancient civilizations in the East are detailed in the companion book of this series. Notably, early civilizations thrived along major rivers like the Nile, Euphrates, Tigris, Ganges, and Yang-tse-Kiang. The Romans, through a series of expansions and conquests, eventually amassed a wealth of information summarized by Ptolemy.|['1. What is the main focus of the text passage?\nA.

In the next two centuries, the Greeks engaged in a significant battle against the Persian Empire, a crucial conflict that determined whether Europe or Asia would dominate the world. The Greeks discovered the vulnerability of the Persian Empire through the journey of ten thousand Greek mercenaries led by Xenophon. This expedition shed light on the weaknesses of vast empires encompassing diverse tribes and nations. Meanwhile, in Greece, various tribes competed for supremacy, with the Macedonians eventually rising to power under Philip of Macedon, who planned to challenge the Persian Empire. Following his father's intentions, Alexander the Great conquered vast territories, spreading Greek influence. Alexander's conquests led to the foundation of numerous cities, including Alexandria, a hub of intellectual activity. The triumphant march of Alexander also contributed to geographical knowledge, especially in North-West India. In the Western Mediterranean, Rome and Carthage emerged as dominant powers, with Rome eventually becoming the master of the Western Mediterranean by 200 B.C.|"['1.

During the first century before our era, Rome's reach expanded under the leadership of Cæsar and Pompey. Cæsar pushed Rome's borders to Gaul, Western Germany, and Britain, while Pompey paved the way for Roman rule in Asia Minor, Western Asia, and Egypt. The Romans built straight, durable roads to move their legions across the vast empire, aiding in its preservation for nearly five centuries. Roman law and the worship of the Emperor unified the empire, fostering a sense of community. However, after the Roman Empire's fall, geographical knowledge was lost and distorted during the Dark Ages due to religious influences. Medieval geography was shaped by theological interpretations, resulting in maps depicting a circular world with Jerusalem at the center and Asia greatly exaggerated. Legends and mythical creatures were often included in maps, reflecting the limited knowledge and imaginative interpretations of the time.|"[""1.

"One writer, driven by religious fervor, drastically altered the traditional views of the world. A Christian merchant named Cosmas, also known as COSMAS INDICOPLEUSTES, penned ""Christian Topography"" around 540 A.D. to challenge what he deemed as misconceptions held by Pagans about the Earth's layout. He vehemently rejected the idea of a spherical Earth and Antipodes, depicting a round Earth with four men standing on it, posing the question of how they could all stand upright. Cosmas suggested a colossal mountain in the far north around which the sun circled every day. He also claimed the sun was smaller than Earth. His theories, though intriguing, failed to gain much acceptance, even among medieval monks. This extreme view was not reflected in the medieval world maps, like the one found in Hereford, England. These maps served more to spark wonder than for practical navigation."|"['1.

"During the Dark Age of geographical knowledge, inaccurate concepts like the Hereford map replaced the precise measurements of ancient times. Surprisingly, scholars clung to these ideas until Columbus' era, neglecting the new information gathered during the Middle Ages. This period was marked by the reorganization of Europe's political map due to invasions from Asia. Waves of tribes, including the Huns, Visigoths, and Vandals, disrupted the Roman Empire. The Franks' kingdom expanded across France and Germany, leading to Charlemagne's coronation as Emperor. The Kingdom of Burgundy and Poland played crucial roles in European history, acting as buffers between nations. Additionally, the spread of Islam in the Arabian peninsula revived lost Græco-Roman knowledge, influencing the Crusades and reuniting the West with East Asia. Arab merchants explored Southeast Africa, China, and islands like Ceylon, Java, and Sumatra, contributing valuable insights to geography. The Arab geographer, Edrisi, created an extensive work resembling a chess-board, dividing the world into ""climates"" and sections, offering a unique perspective on global geography."|"['1.

During the eighth and ninth centuries, a significant movement took place in Europe that greatly impacted the knowledge and exploration of the northern European peoples. The Vikings, also known as Sea-Rovers, from Norway emerged as a formidable naval power. They conducted bold attacks along the European coastlines, establishing stable governments in various regions. The Vikings played a crucial role in preventing further disruptions in Europe, forming kingdoms in places like Iceland, England, and Ireland. Notably, they are believed to be the first Europeans to discover America, with evidence suggesting they settled in Vinland, possibly present-day North America. The development of the mariner's compass, which allowed sailors to navigate away from the shore, was a crucial advancement that facilitated extended voyages and exploration. The use of compasses spread from the Chinese to European mariners, enhancing their ability to navigate the seas accurately. The creation of detailed maritime charts called Portulanos further improved navigation, enabling safer and more precise voyages. These advancements in navigation laid the foundation for future explorations and discoveries, marking a significant period in medieval geography.|"['1.

During the Middle Ages, spanning from the fifth century to the fifteenth century, significant events shaped the expansion of knowledge about the world. The Vikings' voyages in the eighth and ninth centuries, the Crusades in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and the rise of the Mongol Empire in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were pivotal. The Vikings' discoveries did not spread widely, while the Crusades reintroduced classical knowledge to Europe. However, the Mongol Empire's growth provided Europe with new information about Eastern Asia. The Mongols, led by Chinchiz Khan and later his son Okkodai, conquered vast territories in Asia, including China. The Franciscans' expeditions to the Mongol court and Marco Polo's travels in the East significantly expanded Europe's understanding of Asia, setting the stage for future explorations.|"[""1.

"In the 13th century, the Polos embarked on a perilous sea voyage to escort a princess from China to Persia. Initially mistaken for Tatars, they surprised their relatives by revealing hidden gems sewn into their clothes. Marco Polo, known as ""Messer Marco Millione,"" shared tales of his travels to the Great Khan's empire, where he marveled at the vast riches and advanced civilizations.

During the Middle Ages, India started to gain more recognition through the journeys of wandering friars. These friars often visited India to pay homage to the shrine of St. Thomas, believed to have been martyred there. Additionally, the Nestorian Church began to spread across Central Asia during this time. Syrian Christians following Nestorius's teachings moved eastward, establishing churches in Persia and Turkestan, reaching as far as Pekin. The Nestorian priests' reports also sparked interest in the legend of Prester John, a Christian king-priest ruling in the East. While the search for Prester John led to Abyssinia, the Nestorian travels added to geographical knowledge by revealing more about China and Japan. These medieval travels paved the way for future discoveries, setting the stage for explorers like Marco Polo and Columbus.|"['1.

The earliest communication between nations was through the sea, with the Phoenicians establishing trade centers along the Mediterranean coasts. The Greeks followed suit in the Ægean and Black Seas. Caravan routes were also established between Egypt, Syria, and Mesopotamia. The Romans were great road builders, creating solid roads that have lasted for centuries. These roads were crucial for the expansion of the Roman Empire, allowing quick movement of troops. Stations were built along these roads, forming the basis of Europe's major highways today. Asia, with its plateaus and mountain ranges, had significant caravan routes that connected Eastern and Western Asia. Communication between Southern Asia and Europe mainly occurred by sea. Europe heavily relied on the East for luxuries like silk, spices, and gems. The East provided Europe with essential goods, from medical supplies to incense. Europe's culture and trade were greatly influenced by the East.|"['1.

Spices like cloves, nutmegs, maces, and pepper were traded from distant lands to Europe. Cloves came from Maluco, Tarenate, and Amboyna, while nutmegs were sourced from Banda. Pepper was common from Malabar, and cinnamon from Seilan. Other exotic items included ginger from Sorat in Cambaia, camphor from Brimeo near China, and saffron from Balsara and Persia. These goods were brought to Europe through trade routes, enriching the continent with flavors and scents from faraway places like Arabia Felix, Persia, and China. The trade also included items like lacquer from Pegu, musk from Tartarie, and indigo from Zindi and Cambaia, showcasing the vast array of products exchanged between different regions during ancient times.|['1.

During the Middle Ages, Asia was a hub of luxury and necessity trade. The Arabs dominated this commerce, trading with Europe for gold and silver. Alexandria was a bustling center for trade, attracting merchants from various European nations and even distant lands like India and Arabia. The Italians, especially from ports like Amalfi and Pisa, played a significant role in this trade, eventually overtaken by Genoa and Venice due to their strategic positions. Venice became wealthy from this trade, expanding its influence along the Mediterranean. However, a new era of exploration began in the 15th century with Portugal's Prince Henry the Navigator. Establishing an observatory and navigation school, he sought new routes to India, leading to the Age of Exploration and the discovery of new lands.|['1.

"During the era of Prince Henry, the northwest coast of Africa was known up to Cape Bojador. Norman sailors had ventured beyond Cape Non, also called Cape Nun, believing nothing existed beyond it. Prince Henry aimed to determine if the African coast turned east after Cape Bojador and if ancient beliefs about the torrid zone's uninhabitability were true. Expeditions were sent each year, surpassing the previous ones. Madeira was discovered in 1420, and Cape Bojador was crossed in 1435. By 1455, the Gambia was reached, but locals were hostile. Prince Henry's men brought back around a thousand natives for the Portuguese nobles. The discovery of Cape Verde Islands in 1460 marked the end of Prince Henry's explorations. The Portuguese continued exploring, with Fernando de Poo finding an island in 1471, and Pedro d'Escobar crossing the equator. Stone pillars called _padraos_ were erected to mark their presence, and in 1484, the River Congo was discovered. Information about a Christian king to the east led to attempts by land and sea to reach him. Bartholomew Diaz rounded the Cape of Good Hope, later renamed from ""Stormy Cape"" by King João."|"[""1.

For nearly a decade after Prince Henry's plan to reach India was put on hold, Columbus successfully discovered a western voyage to the Indies in 1492 while working for the Spanish monarchs. This achievement made the traditional Portuguese route along Africa seem less appealing. King João passed away three years later, and his successor Emmanuel, in the third year of his reign, commissioned Vasco da Gama to attempt the eastward route to India. Facing challenges from Moors along the African coast, Gama eventually reached Calicut with the help of an Indian pilot. Despite initial resistance, Gama managed to establish an alliance with the Zamorin of Calicut. His successful voyage threatened the trade monopolies of the Venetians and the Sultan of Egypt, leading to tensions and naval preparations against the Portuguese. Subsequent Portuguese expeditions under Pedro Alvarez Cabral and Vasco da Gama further expanded their discoveries, including lands like Santa Cruz in Brazil and various islands.|"[""1.

During the 16th century, King Emmanuel of Portugal adopted the Venetian method of colonization, sending Vice-Doges to oversee trade and collect tribute in their colonies. Affonso de Albuquerque, a notable Viceroy, captured key posts like Goa in India and the Moluccas, also known as the Spice Islands. The Portuguese monopoly on spices led to a rise in prices in European markets. In 1521, the Portuguese secured the Spice Islands, just as Magellan reached the Philippines, nearing the same goal. The Pope's Bull in 1493 divided discoveries between Spain and Portugal, with Portugal gaining rights to the east. The line of demarcation was adjusted to include Brazil, discovered by Cabral. The Spice Islands' ownership was contested, eventually resolved through a family compact. Portugal dominated the Indian Ocean trade until the 17th century when new competitors emerged after the Spanish-Portuguese union. Meanwhile, the idea of reaching the Indies by sailing westward captivated a Genoese sailor, inspired by ancient beliefs in a round earth and mysterious islands to the west.|['1.

Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa in 1446 to humble parents. His early years were spent learning seamanship and studying the works of Latin translations. In 1473, he settled in Lisbon, with his brother as a map-maker and himself as a seaman. Columbus married Felipa Moñiz, and around this time, he heard of Toscanelli's idea of a westward voyage to Cathay. Toscanelli's map showing the distance between Spain and Cathay inspired Columbus. He gathered information about the Atlantic islands and mysterious signs, fueling his enthusiasm. After failed attempts in Portugal, Columbus sought support from Spain's Catholic monarchs. In 1492, he set sail with three vessels. On October 11th, after 33 days at sea, they spotted land, confirming Columbus's belief in reaching Zipangu. Columbus's voyage led to the discovery of San Salvador and later Cuba and Hayti. Despite challenges, he returned to Spain with news of his successful journey, marking the beginning of a new era of exploration.|"[""1.

Christopher Columbus was warmly welcomed by the Spaniards upon his return from his voyages to the islands he had discovered. He presented Ferdinand and Isabella with gold and treasures from the natives he had encountered. This led to the outfitting of a larger fleet of seven ships that set sail from Cadiz in September 1493. Columbus explored the West Indies once again, finding the fort in Hayti destroyed and his men missing. Despite facing challenges and controversies on subsequent voyages, Columbus continued his explorations. In his third voyage in 1498, he touched Trinidad and glimpsed the coast of South America, which he believed to be the Terrestrial Paradise. Columbus's daring voyages inspired others like Vespucci and Cabral to make significant discoveries in the New World. Amerigo Vespucci explored Brazil and the southern regions, shedding light on the true extent of Columbus's discoveries and leading to the naming of the continent after him as America.|"['1.

In 1521, after a long journey, the explorers finally arrived at Tidor, one of the Moluccas, and traded with the locals for valuable spices and nutmegs. The ship, Trinidad, was too damaged to sail back immediately, so the Victoria set off to catch the east monsoon. After a perilous journey around the Cape of Good Hope, the Victoria returned to Seville in September 1522, with only 18 men out of the original 270. Meanwhile, the Trinidad faced its own challenges, sailing north but running out of supplies, forcing a return to the Moluccas where the crew was captured by the Portuguese. This voyage was crucial for geographical discoveries, confirming the existence of a New World separate from Asia.

In 1534, Jacques Cartier explored the St. Lawrence River, paving the way for Samuel de Champlain to establish French rule in Canada. The English, on the other hand, aimed to reach the Indies by a northern passage. Sebastian Cabot, appointed Grand Pilot of England, led a voyage in 1553 that reached Archangel and Moscow. Martin Frobisher's exploration in 1576 led to the discovery of a strait named after him. Sir Humphrey Gilbert's attempt to find a passage to China ended tragically in 1583. John Davis discovered several westward passages in the late 1500s. Henry Hudson's expeditions in the early 1600s led to significant discoveries, including the Hudson Strait and Bay. William Baffin's 1615 voyage resulted in the discovery of Baffin Island. The Dutch, after revolting against Philip II, focused on seizing Portuguese routes in the East Indies. By 1658, the Dutch had gained control of Ceylon and the Spice Islands, while the English concentrated on India.|"[""1.

During the 16th century, the English aimed to establish direct trade routes with the East. Anthony Jenkinson, an English ambassador, traveled to Bokhara in 1558 but faced challenges. English merchants formed a company in 1583 to trade with Aleppo, Bagdad, Ormuz, and Goa. While unsuccessful at some ports due to Portuguese interference, they managed to arrange cheaper transit routes for Eastern goods to England. By 1587, the English conducted their own trade with the East as the Venetian and Portuguese monopolies ended. Russian expansion towards the Far East led to new trade opportunities. Russian merchant Strogonof and Cossack Vassili Yermak's expeditions paved the way for Russian exploration towards Asia.

Cortes, a Spanish explorer, established himself in Central America and sent expeditions to explore the region. He reached Honduras after a challenging journey guided only by a map on cotton cloth. Cortes also supported an expedition to the Moluccas, reaching Tidor in 1527. In 1536, he explored the northwest coast of Mexico, believing he found a great island he named California. His actions led to the discovery of Central America. Inspired by Cortes, Francisco Pizarro set out to find El Dorado in Peru. Pizarro captured the Inca ruler Atahualpa and obtained immense riches. Pizarro's conquest of Peru and his exploration of the Amazon River expanded Spanish influence in the New World. By 1540, Spanish adventurers had revealed much of Central and South America. Spain exploited the region's resources, enriching Europe but causing economic issues.|"['1.

During the exploration of North America in the 16th century, the French and English made initial attempts along the northeast coast but did not settle due to the inhospitable conditions. The French explorer Cartier in 1534 and the Cabots did not follow their explorations with land possession attempts. Breton fishermen frequented Newfoundland, and explorers sought a northwest passage. St. Augustine, Florida, was founded in 1565 but was destroyed by the French. Sir Walter Raleigh's colony near Virginia in 1584 failed. In the 17th century, the French established settlements in Port Royal and Quebec, while the English formed plantations along the coast. The French explored the interior, discovering the Mississippi, and La Salle explored the Ohio and Illinois rivers, claiming the Louisiana territory for France. The Treaty of Paris in 1763 ceded French America to England, leading to the end of French power in North America.|"['1.

In the early 19th century, the United States initiated exploration of the land west of the Mississippi River. Lewis and Clarke extensively explored the Missouri basin from 1804 to 1807, while Pike investigated the area between the sources of the Mississippi and the Red River. President Monroe declared in 1823 that the United States would not allow further colonization in the Americas to prevent Russian encroachment towards the Californian coast. By 1848, the United States acquired California and neighboring states during the war with Mexico, just before the gold rush in the Sacramento Valley. The Oregon Territory, shared by Great Britain and the United States, was divided along the 49th parallel in 1846. This marked the completion of the partition of America, with the northern coast remaining unexplored. Geographical exploration in America was driven by conquest, trade, and settlement, facilitated by advancements in communication like steam technology.|"['1.

In 1642, ABEL JANSSEN TASMAN led an expedition to explore the southern land. Tasman sailed southeast from Mauritius and discovered Van Diemen's Land, now known as Tasmania. He then found Staaten Land, which was part of New Zealand. Tasman's voyage also led to the discovery of several Pacific islands. His explorations helped reduce the mystery surrounding the southern continent. Later, William Dampier explored New Holland and noted the kangaroo's habits. These Dutch voyages increased knowledge about the southern lands. Captain Lemuel Gulliver's journey to Lilliput in Swift's tale reflects the geographical understanding of Australia at the time. The search for the Spice Islands drove these discoveries, setting the stage for future explorations. James Cook later played a crucial role in furthering geographical knowledge through his scientific voyages.|"[""1.

During the 18th century, advancements in timekeeping revolutionized navigation. Clocks became so precise that they could help sailors determine their longitude at sea. The English government even offered a large reward for a chronometer that wouldn't lose more than a few minutes a year. John Harrison won this prize, enabling sea captains like James Cook to navigate accurately. Cook, a skilled sailor, used Hadley's sextant and Harrison's chronometer on his voyages. In 1769, he observed the transit of Venus and then explored new lands, including New Zealand and Australia. Cook disproved the existence of a great southern continent and later searched for the mythical north-west passage. His voyages greatly advanced geographical knowledge, proving invaluable for future explorers.|"['1.

In the late 18th century, the French, inspired by Cook's voyages, honored his legacy by instructing their fleet to respect his ships despite being at war with England. François de la Pérouse, in 1783, embarked on an expedition to continue Cook's work. He explored the north-east coast of Asia, the island of Saghalien, and the strait between it and Japan, now named after him. Pérouse's journey led him to Kamtschatka, where he landed Monsieur Lesseps, the Russian interpreter. Lesseps later traveled overland to Paris, becoming the first European to cross the Old World from the Pacific to the Atlantic Ocean. Pérouse then ventured to New South Wales, discovering English ships establishing the first Australian colony. Despite surveying New Holland, Pérouse's fate remains a mystery after his expedition was lost near the Fijis in 1826. Cook's exploration of Australia's eastern coast led to the settlement of convicts at Botany Bay under Captain Philips, followed by English explorers accurately mapping Australia's coast and interior over time. Bass and Flinders, in the late 1700s, made significant discoveries along Australia's southern coast, including Bass' Strait and Port Philip. Subsequent explorers like Captain P. P. King and Sturt furthered inland investigations, with Stuart, Burke, Wills, and others crossing the continent to expand knowledge of Australia's interior. By the|"[""1.

In the 18th century, the British, particularly explorers like James Bruce and Mungo Park, played a vital role in uncovering the mysteries of Africa. Bruce ventured into Abyssinia to trace the sources of the Nile, identifying the Blue Nile's origin. His adventures captivated many, marking the dawn of scientific exploration. Park, dispatched by the African Association, journeyed along the Niger River, shedding light on the fabled city of Timbuctoo. Adams, a seaman, shared tales of Timbuctoo after his enslavement and ransom. Major Denham and Lieutenant Clapperton expanded our knowledge of West Africa by traversing Lake Chad and Bornu. The exploration of Timbuctoo continued, with Major Laing and Réné Caillié visiting the city in the 19th century. These expeditions paved the way for a better understanding of Africa's interior and its rich history.|"[""1.

In 1850, Barth resumed the exploration work of Denham and Clapperton, spending five years exploring west of Lake Chad, reaching Timbuctoo. Nachtigall undertook a similar journey east of Lake Chad, covering Darfur and Wadai in five years (1869-74). Recent political interests led to expeditions connecting French territories in Algeria and Tunis with those on the Gold Coast and Senegal. David Livingstone played a crucial role in African exploration, discovering Central Africa. He crossed Africa from west to east, reaching Lake Nyassa in 1859. Livingstone's efforts inspired others like Burton and Speke, who discovered Lake Tanganyika and Victoria Nyanza. Stanley later crossed the Dark Continent, tracing the Congo River. This era of exploration led to European powers partitioning Africa, with Belgium establishing the Congo Free State. Germany also entered the colonization race, leading to the Berlin Conference of 1884-85, setting rules for Africa's partition.|"[""1.

"Shortly after the Berlin Congress, England and Germany finalized their claims in South-West Africa. They also determined their ""spheres of influence"" in East Africa. The British East Africa Association managed the land north of Victoria Nyanza, bordered by the Congo Free State to the west and reaching the revolted provinces of Egypt to the north. In South Africa, a Chartered Company led by Mr. Cecil Rhodes controlled the region from Cape Colony to German East Africa and the Congo Free State. Agreements in 1890-91 set boundaries for Portuguese Angola, Portuguese East Africa, and Italian claims in East Africa. Delimitation agreements between Germany and England in 1890 defined borders in the Cameroons, Togoland, and along the Niger River. Friction persisted over unclear boundaries, especially between England and France in Africa. Political complications in Egypt led to joint administration by France and England, resulting in British occupation after a rebellion.

Exploration of Africa has been a fascinating journey, driven by various motives like adventure, scientific curiosity, and even big game hunting. The abolishment of the slave trade was a significant outcome of these explorations. North Africa, being predominantly Muslim, continued to raid Central Africa for slaves to supply West Asia and North Africa. The Mahdist rebellion was partly a response to Egypt's abolition of slavery. England and France raced to control the Upper Nile, with England focusing on the Nile's upper course and France attempting to access the region through the French Congo and Abyssinia. European powers like England and France have made significant progress in exploring and annexing parts of Africa, with England gaining the Nile valley and South Africa, while France expanding its territories in North-West Africa.

The era of Arctic exploration truly began in 1818 with two expeditions aimed at uncovering the north-west passage and reaching the Pole. John Ross and W. E. Parry set out on the _Isabella_ and _Alexander_ ships, respectively, confirming Baffin's discoveries but falling short of their goals. In 1821, Franklin embarked on a perilous journey from the Coppermine, barely surviving on lichens and leather scraps. Despite setbacks, explorers like Ross, Franklin, and Richardson made significant progress, mapping coastlines and discovering new lands. Interest in Antarctic exploration also grew, with expeditions by Weddell, Bellany, Dumont d'Urville, and Captain Wilkes leading to remarkable discoveries. Sir J. C.

In 1845, Sir John Franklin set out on an expedition to find the Northwest Passage with 129 crew members on the ships _Erebus_ and _Terror_. The ships were last seen in 1845 waiting to enter Lancaster Sound. Franklin's ships got stuck in ice near King William Land in 1846. Franklin died in 1847, and his crew faced starvation and disease. In 1854, explorer John Rae learned from an Inuit woman that some of Franklin's men had died on King William Land. Despite numerous search efforts, the fate of Franklin's crew remained a mystery until 1859 when explorer M'Clintock found evidence of their demise.

In the past, explorers like Baffin and Inglefield mapped out the islands in the North American region, with Smith Sound being a significant area reaching beyond the 80th parallel. Kane and later explorers like Hayes and Hall continued the investigations around Smith Sound. Concurrently, Professor Nordenskiold successfully navigated the northeast passage, opening up new commercial routes. Inspired by his success, Nordenskiold embarked on a journey towards Behring Strait. In 1878, he nearly completed the northeast passage, reaching Cape North. Despite challenges with ice, he eventually rounded East Cape, marking the completion of the northeast passage. This accomplishment led to increased interest in Arctic exploration, culminating in an international Polar Conference in 1879. The conference aimed to establish scientific observation stations around the North Pole. Subsequent expeditions, including Lieutenant Greely's, pushed the boundaries of exploration, with Nansen's bold plan to drift across the Arctic Ocean aboard the Fram proving successful. His journey reached 86.14° N, nearly 200 miles from the Pole, showcasing the spirit of adventure and discovery in Arctic exploration.|"['1.

In the past, Arctic exploration reached a pinnacle with Nansen's successful voyage. Following his daring method of abandoning his base, Andrée embarked on a balloon journey towards the Pole in 1897, equipped for a prolonged Arctic stay. While Andrée's whereabouts remain unknown after a year, inspired by Nansen, hope lingers for his safe return and the realization of a significant geographical discovery. Interestingly, the Arctic now captivates global attention for contrasting reasons: the pursuit of wealth and the thirst for knowledge and honor. Throughout history, notable milestones in geography include the invention of maps by Anaximander of Miletus, the first written geography by Hecatæus of Miletus, and the travels of explorers like Pytheas to Britain and Alexander to India.|"[""1.

Around 332 B.C., Alexander the Great visited India. In 330 B.C., Nearchus explored the region. Approximately in 300 B.C., Megasthenes documented his experiences. Moving forward to 400-414 A.D., Fa-hien journeyed to India. In 518-521 A.D., Hoei-Sing and Sung-Yun visited. By 540 A.D., Cosmas Indicopleustes explored the area. Between 629-646 A.D., Hiouen-Tshang made his journey. Following that, in 671-695 A.D., I-tsing explored India. In the late 12th century, Benjamin of Tudela visited. Then in the 14th century, travelers like Ibn Batuta, Mandeville, Jordanus of Severac, and John de Marignolli visited India. In the late 15th century, explorers like Nicolo Conti, Abd-ur-Razzak, Athanasius Nikitin, Pedro de Covilham, Hieronimo di Santo Stefano, and Ludovico di Varthema explored the Indian subcontinent.|['1.
