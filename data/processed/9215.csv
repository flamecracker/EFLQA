During a past summer at Edgartown on Martha’s Vineyard, I met a tombstone carver who had journeyed from Massachusetts seeking work. He anticipated earning a substantial sum transforming slate and marble into riches during his stay. The simple life and enduring spirit of the islanders, particularly on Martha’s Vineyard, ensure lasting memories for their departed loved ones. The tombstones in the burial ground varied from elaborate older ones with intricate carvings to recent plain slabs. The most touching were the rough ones hewn from the island's rocks by unskilled hands, bearing heartfelt inscriptions. The carver, Mr. Wigglesworth, a descendant of a Puritan family, approached life with simplicity and a focus on his craft. Despite the melancholy nature of his work, he found joy in it, imparting wisdom through his unique perspective.|"[""1.

My friend, the sculptor, shared a story with me that made me think deeply. He spoke of a broken rose that had spread its sweet fragrance for forty years, symbolizing the life of a good woman. As I pondered this, I observed different individuals seeking gravestones. Among them was an old man with his fourth wife, ordering stones for his three previous spouses. His lack of distinction between them troubled me. In contrast, a whaling captain planned a memorial with a vacant space beside his deceased wife’s epitaph, awaiting his own name. The devotion of husbands to their departed wives struck me more than widows' memorials for their husbands. Women, feeling a deep connection even after death, may not seek visible reminders. The sculptor also shared a humorous incident of a woman ordering a tombstone for her supposedly deceased husband, only for him to return alive, much to the chagrin of the sculptor.|['1.

During a conversation with Mr. Wigglesworth, I suggested that a simpler and more natural expression from the mother and daughter could have been a better choice for the inscription on a gravestone. The sculptor disagreed, finding comfort in old poetic phrases. He believed these phrases could adapt to both great and small sorrows. The interactions between Mr. Wigglesworth and his clients often sparked amusing thoughts. One scenario involved a tavern owner wanting gravestones for her family in exchange for boarding the sculptor. This led to a whimsical image of Mr. Wigglesworth carving at a tombstone dinner table. Another client, consumed by hatred, ordered a gravestone for his enemy, planning to be buried next to him. Meanwhile, an antiquarian commemorated an Indian chief with a broken bow and a cherub. Lastly, a miser commissioned an extravagant tombstone to ensure remembrance.|['1.
