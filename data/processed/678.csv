Dot was a noble and influential young girl. She took care of Caleb and Bertha, ensuring they found comfort in each other's company. Dot then returned, as lively as a daisy, to watch over a baby. She invited Mrs. Fielding to share baby care tips. Despite being left alone momentarily, the old lady didn't fall into the trap easily. Dot kept busy with needlework and nursing, making the afternoon fly by. As evening approached, she took on Bertha's household chores, played the harp, and prepared tea. Tackleton returned for the evening. Caleb was remorseful, feeling he had deceived Bertha. Dot, anticipating the Carrier's return, became restless.

The man faced a challenge from an elderly woman, and they began to play a game. Initially, he occasionally glanced around with a smile, involving Dot in advising him on the game. However, his opponent was strict, making him focus solely on the cards to prevent her from cheating. Suddenly, a hand on his shoulder brought him back to reality.

She had been upstairs with the baby, putting it to bed. As he sat brooding by the fire, she quietly approached him and placed her small stool next to him. He only noticed when he felt her hand on his, and saw her gazing up at him. Was it with wonder? No, not quite. Initially alarmed, then a wild smile of recognition crossed her face, followed by a solemn look. He couldn't bear to see her there, where she used to sit so innocently and happily. When she left, tears streaming down her face, he felt a strange relief. The emptiness beside him was a reminder of his desolation, his shattered life. The sight of her crouching there had been too much to bear. He looked for a weapon and found a gun on the wall. The idea of shooting the man like a wild beast grew in his mind, transforming his thoughts into blind fury. But her image, pleading for mercy, softened him. Her words of love for the cricket echoed in his mind, stirring his better nature. He recoiled from the door, setting the gun aside, tears of relief streaming down his face by the fire.

As the Carrier sat lost in thought, a magical Presence surrounded him, reflecting memories of his wife through fairies that emerged from every corner of his home. These fairies, not mere spectators like the Cricket, busied themselves honoring her memory. They lovingly adorned her image with flowers and gestures of affection, dispelling any negative thoughts. Meanwhile, Dot, his cheerful and diligent wife, sat by the fire sewing and singing. Suddenly, a group of merry young people, including the radiant Dot, arrived to invite her to a dance.

Please, John, don't love me just yet. Let me explain. When I seemed sad about the upcoming marriage, it was because I remembered May and Edward, such young lovers. I knew that May's heart was not with Tackleton. You believe me now, right, John? When I tease you, calling you clumsy and a dear old goose, it's because I love you so much. I take pleasure in your ways and wouldn't want you any different. When I talk about us being a humdrum couple, it's just a silly act. I love you more every day. I can't love you more than I do now.
