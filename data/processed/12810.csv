"Ten minutes later, a team of builders from the shooting range paused by the road when Greg glanced back. He saw Sergeant Mock limping away from the group. ""Prepare your bayonets,"" Greg commanded. ""Bring Sergeant Mock to the back of the battalion. Encourage him to keep up, but if he hesitates, use the bayonet tips to nudge him along gently.""

Greg added, ""That's enough, Sergeant Mock. A surgeon will check your feet when we return. Unless the surgeon says otherwise, expect consequences!"" As Greg ran back to his company, he thought he heard a hissing sound from the carpenters but didn't investigate.

Later, a regimental surgeon was supposed to examine Mock's feet, but there was a delay. Mock, looking miserable, remained outdoors.

"Dick was catching up when he stepped on a round stone, slipped, and fell. Mock chased after him. The fleeing German paused briefly to throw an automatic pistol at Mock's face, then ran off. Mock dodged the weapon, which hit the ground behind him. Believing the pistol could be useful, Mock stopped, retrieved it, and prepared to give chase. However, the fugitive had disappeared into the darkness.

""I felt tired the other day and thought Captain Holmes was against me. So, I misbehaved and got in trouble. Then I despised Captain Holmes and wanted revenge. But the carpenter, who I thought was a friend, turned out to be a spy. If I had known, I would have confronted him immediately,"" Mock confessed.

Dick whispered to Mock, ""I trust you as a loyal man. I pretended earlier because I suspected the spy was nearby. I didn't pursue him tonight as I plan to catch him red-handed later. Mock, your loyalty will face a tough test if you agree.""

After returning the horse to B company barracks, Dick handed the animal to an orderly and joined Greg in the company office. The conversation with Greg and Colonel Cleaves revealed that the camp was infiltrated by German spies. Sixteen men in F company fell ill after supper, suspected of being poisoned with ground glass in the apple pie.

Meanwhile, Dick described a carpenter who had tried to involve Mock in a dangerous revenge plan. The carpenter had vanished, prompting Secret Service involvement. Sergeant Kelly cautioned against underestimating soldiers who talk too much, as they may be spies plotting mischief. Later, Greg received a list of soldiers requesting passes for a visitors' afternoon. Private Riley expressed frustration, suspecting the applicants of plotting. Mock and Wilhelm were instructed to spread germs in the bedding of fellow soldiers to cause illness. They were promised civilian clothes and money to disappear.|"['1.

"""Alright, then,"" Prescott nodded, as he and Dick exchanged a handshake. ""If you ever have more questions, feel free to ask me. I may not have all the answers, but together we can seek the truth."" Walking down the corridor, Dick heard the melancholic tune of a soldier playing the piano during a break from drills. It's interesting how soldiers enjoy sad songs when they are feeling cheerful. 

""I have a favor to ask,"" Dick continued. ""I want each of you to write a four-page letter to your mother before supper. We have time between drills today. What do you say?"" The recruits, feeling the sting of the corporal's words, were not in the best mood. 

Corporal Barrow, a young man promoted quickly, was not easily satisfied that day. The top sergeant, noticing the tension, pulled Barrow aside for a private conversation.

Corporal Barrow patiently explained the correct way to salute to the squad. He emphasized bringing the hand up smartly without jerking it, holding it horizontally at the hat-brim, and not lowering it until the officer returns the salute. Captain Prescott commended the squad's efforts and stressed the importance of mastering the salute for every soldier. After a long wait for the delayed train, new recruits were finally settled in the barracks. The hungry soldiers rushed to wash up before the bugle called them for formation and mealtime. Following instructions, Sergeant Kelly organized the men to dispose of straw, prepare for inspection, and receive razors.

All the missing equipment was finally sorted out. One evening, after dark, the Ninety-ninth regiment assembled and began their march. The band members carried their instruments quietly as they moved with the headquarters company. Captain Prescott inquired about Sergeant's feelings as they awaited the final orders to set off. Once the command was given, the soldiers boarded the troop train in an orderly manner. The dimly lit train cars accommodated the nearly four thousand officers and men. As the journey began, the soldiers settled in, some dozing off despite the excitement and uncertainty. Singing was prohibited, and noise levels were to be kept low. The train journeyed through the night, and eventually, they arrived at a pier where a grand ship awaited. The regiment boarded the ship in an organized manner, guided by officers. Lights on the ship welcomed them as they embarked on their next adventure, well-prepared from their drills on abandoning ship.|"['1.

On the ship, military drills were constant, especially for the new recruits who were starting to look like seasoned soldiers. Dick and Greg, cabin mates, spent a lot of time together due to the leisure on board. Lieutenants led the drills while captains had little to do. One morning, as the fleet entered the Danger Zone, Dick and Greg observed the sea from the deck. Captain Craig soon shared news about the fleet's location. The duo quickly returned with life-saving belts, mandatory until further notice, making dining a challenge. Torpedo-boat destroyers guarded the ship, ready to act against any enemy sightings. Greg noticed an increase in speed, suspecting possible submarine threats. Dick speculated about additional ships approaching.

For those who prefer precise data, the captain just received a message that two enemy submarines were taken down by the navies of two countries. The initial views from the ship's decks were disappointing as it was early morning, and the mist had thickened, obscuring most of France behind a veil of winter fog. Docked at a French pier built by American engineers, there were no cheering crowds of French present. The French residents were used to American troops arriving, and many were leaving their beds. After a meal and inspection, the men were sent ashore, forming ranks on the street. The battalion commander announced that a select few officers, including the narrator, would be heading to the front lines to study war conditions, guided by Captain Ribaut.

When Dick and the other officers disembarked from the ship with Captain Ribaut, French infantrymen lined the nearby street, cheered by the sight of French women and children watching from the water front. Since the dispute at Camp Berry, Cartwright had avoided Prescott and Holmes. Dick, finding the captain lazy, was unsure of his overall opinion. Most of the Ninety-ninth officers considered Cartwright unfortunate. Captain Ribaut explained how American influence had transformed the city, with signs in English and few in French. As they passed through the city, French shopkeepers greeted them in broken English. The Americans were led to a first-class coach and were told about the front lines.

Near the end of the morning, a soldier arrived on the ship with dishes on trays, followed by others carrying food and coffee. The soldiers left, and the travelers enjoyed their meal. At the next stop, different soldiers cleared the dishes as the train continued its journey. Major Wells praised the resilience of the French people during war. The group soon reached their final station, witnessing the organized chaos of supplies being unloaded. They then moved to a waiting car for a more comfortable ride.

American ambulance sections were unmistakably present in French service, evident by the drivers' informal salutes upon spotting the American uniforms. Amidst the cheer, a young American playfully remarked a unique greeting as his ambulance sped by, prompting Major Wells to jest about the unconventional salutation. Captain Ribaut expressed admiration for the spirited American drivers, acknowledging their fearlessness and unwavering dedication to duty, especially in aiding the wounded after battles. General Bazain warmly welcomed the American officers, showcasing maps detailing the divisional front and strategies against the enemy.

The airman from the enemy revealed the location of the division headquarters, leading to a German shell hitting the yard, causing casualties. Despite the danger, General Bazain decided to relocate. As they moved outside, another shell exploded nearby. Seeking safety, they descended into an underground shelter with equipped rooms for communication. Private Berger guided them through communication trenches to the front lines. They navigated through dangerous terrain with shell-holes, intersecting trenches, and defence lines. Captain Ribaut explained the defensive strategy to the visitors. They met Major Ferrus in an underground room before proceeding to the front line with Private Berger.

The French lieutenant advised them to speak quietly as they approached the enemy's first line trench, just a quarter of a kilometer away. They walked through a communication trench to the first line ditch, where duck-boards covered the wet ground. Sandbags lined the parapet with loopholes for sentries. A sandbag wall, called a parados, shielded against shrapnel. Lieutenant De Verne suggested Dick stand on the fire platform to see the barbed wire, shell-torn ground, and German defenses.

"""Wait!"" interrupted Captain Ribaut swiftly and entered the passage on the left. He returned with two French soldiers who seized Private Berger. Captain Ribaut pointed out a small electric light hidden up Berger's sleeve, used for signaling to the enemy. Captain Prescott had noticed this before. Berger was exposed as a spy, and Captain Ribaut demonstrated the signal. Berger was taken away, and the men were warned of possible enemy attacks.

"""Alright, then,"" agreed the lieutenant. ""The sergeant and three men will carry rifles; the other three will be bombers. Our faces and hands are blackened to avoid being seen in No Man's Land.

The soldiers were ready, some dozing, lacking excitement. ""You're next, Captain,"" urged De Verne. Dick climbed out cat-like, following the sergeant through the wire defenses.

Dick Prescott found himself outside the crater after hearing a click, realizing he needed to avoid alerting the enemy. He carefully navigated towards his French comrades, ensuring their safety. Moving silently, he reached the group, impressing the French lieutenant with his stealth. The soldiers aimed to gather intelligence from the German trenches and ambush patrols. Prescott spotted a smaller shell-hole near the enemy's defenses and observed a soldier creeping towards it. Guided by De Verne, Prescott and the sergeant joined the soldier in the shell-hole. The soldier advanced towards the enemy's barbed wire, disappearing into the darkness. Prescott marveled at how the soldier blended in with the night, showcasing the bravery and cunning of the French soldiers.|"['1.

With a gentle push, Prescott urged the sergeant to cautiously emerge from the hole, with Dick close behind. Despite the absence of any rush, they eventually approached the initial wire barriers. Dick now understood the soldier's recent hand signals. He realized that the Germans had created narrow paths in their own wire entanglements, likely for their patrols to navigate. This time, it was the sergeant who advanced first. Dick felt a surge of admiration as he watched the French non-commissioned officer pass through the barbed wire and cautiously peek over the German parapet. Following closely, Dick and the French soldier beside him observed the sergeant give a subtle signal, prompting the soldier to climb to the parapet. Prescott mimicked the action. This was his first glimpse into a German trench, although there was little to see except the empty trench itself. After a brief pause, the patrol regrouped as Lieutenant De Verne led them further into the enemy territory. As they moved eastward, Dick noted the absence of German soldiers along the way. Lieutenant De Verne whispered to Dick about the enemy's tactic of pretending to be vigilant before withdrawing to rest or regroup. Dick assured the lieutenant of his swift return before venturing into the nearby trench with his pistol at the ready.|"[""1.

As Captain Prescott cautiously approached, he heard voices ahead. Moving closer, he discovered a German colonel and a French sub-lieutenant in conversation. The German lamented the capture of Berger, a valuable asset. The colonel revealed a signal to call their troops back. Realizing the danger, Dick disarmed the sub-lieutenant and made the bold decision to take both men as prisoners. The colonel offered Dick a chance to escape to the French lines. Following the colonel's directions, Dick and the prisoners encountered French soldiers led by Lieutenant De Verne. One prisoner turned out to be Lieutenant Noyez, surprising everyone. De Verne commended Dick for his remarkable capture of the German, highlighting the tense situation and the strategic decisions made in the heat of the moment.|['1.

Lieutenant De Verne overheard a conversation revealing Noyez as a spy reporting to an enemy colonel. De Verne handed Noyez over to his patrol, ensuring he wouldn't escape. As they headed back, they were challenged by a French sentry but allowed to pass. Dick suggested that Noyez's presence in the German trenches without orders indicated treason. Noyez awaited Captain Gaulte, who denied knowledge of his actions. General Bazain interrogated Noyez, revealing evidence of his treachery. The code book used for sending secret reports to the enemy was found in Noyez's possession. General Bazain confirmed Noyez's guilt, leaving him in dejection.|"['1.

General Bazain was shocked to learn that Noyez, a French sub-lieutenant, was actually a German spy. Noyez, born in Alsace to a German father named Bamberger, had served the Kaiser and infiltrated the French Army. Now exposed, Noyez defiantly revealed his true identity and allegiance to Germany. Despite his impending death, he boasted of the havoc he had wreaked on the French forces. General Bazain, though dismayed, found some solace in the fact that Noyez's treachery had been uncovered.

"De Verne admitted, ""I thought you might ask for a place to rest in a dug-out."" Dick replied, ""I prefer sleeping during the day as the real action seems to happen at night."" Ribaut guided them to a shelter below the barbed wire. They were alerted about a barrage preventing reinforcements due to Colonel Pernim's capture. The noise of exploding shells filled the air, making conversation impossible. The continuous shelling kept French reinforcements away. Despite the chaos, the French fought back fiercely.

Dick reluctantly agreed to the request and found himself sandwiched between his companions. As a gesture of gratitude, he shared his trench coat to provide extra warmth for all three of them.

At last, a German officer appeared to lead the long line of prisoners. With precise commands, they marched under the watch of forty infantrymen. After covering eight miles, they reached a railway yard. Here, the officer left to seek orders. The prisoners were then ushered into cattle cars, lacking seats and cleanliness. Amidst the stifling atmosphere, the officer-prisoners were confined to one car. Despite the discomfort, ventilation was available. Suddenly, a fierce exchange of artillery fire lit up the sky. The French guns retaliated, causing chaos in the railway yard. In the dead of night, a breakdown halted the train.

In the foggy night, Dick managed to slip away from the Germans unnoticed. He cautiously made his way through a ploughed field, avoiding making any noise that could alert the train guard. Following the clue of a crowing rooster, he steered clear of farm buildings and chose a path away from them. As he crossed a road, he spotted two tree trunks and moved towards them. Suddenly, a man with an axe mistook him for a German and swung the weapon at him. The man quickly realized his mistake, apologizing to Dick for the confusion in French.

Lieutenant Tom Reade and Captain Richard Prescott, of the American aviation and infantry services, found themselves in a perilous situation. Papa Prim, an old Frenchman, guided them through the dangerous territory. Despite their mission, the young soldiers were concerned for Papa Prim's safety. Reade revealed his hidden pistol, prepared to face the enemy alone if necessary. However, Dick insisted that Papa Prim should not risk his life with them. They exchanged introductions and promised to reconnect once the area was free from German occupation. Papa Prim detailed the layout of the Prussian-occupied schoolhouse, warning them of the guarded sheds and the troop camp nearby.

At 5,000 feet on a dark night, heading to 15,000 feet, fear of German aircraft loomed. Despite the roaring motors and rushing air, Prescott acknowledged the danger. Below, anti-aircraft guns fired at them, guided by their telephoned course. Shells exploded nearby, causing unease. Another plane attempted an attack but failed, thanks to Dick's swift response. Outmaneuvering the Germans, they evaded pursuit due to their faster aircraft. Approaching French territory, they signaled for a safe landing, facing the risk of being mistaken for enemies. Guided by a flare on the ground, they landed safely. Commandant Perrault greeted them, amazed by their story. A car was arranged to take Prescott to the communication trenches. Escorted by a trench guide, they reached Major Wells and the others a third of a mile away.|['1.
