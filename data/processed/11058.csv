At the King's School in Canterbury, the students are back from their holidays and settling into the routine of lessons. While some are already looking forward to football matches and play, most are focused on their studies. Jack Archer, a student at the school, is surprised when summoned home suddenly. His father wants him to learn military drawing and fortification instead of focusing on Latin and Greek. Jack, feeling verses are useless, is taken aback by the unexpected recall.

"""Jack, please sit down,"" his father said. ""You've always wanted to go to sea. I reached out to your cousin Charles, a navy lieutenant, six months back to inquire about a midshipman's position for you. Charles was on half pay and uncertain about ship commissions.

I believe war is a possibility, contrary to popular opinion. England has criticized war for so long that the Emperor Nicholas may think we won't fight. However, I believe he is mistaken. The people of England are inherently warlike. Wars have always been popular here. If the honor and interest of England are threatened, the people will support war. At present, England and France hope to deter Russia with a show of force, but I think Russia is committed to its conquests. Russia has a vast population and a formidable army. The Czar has the resources to challenge us. It's a busy day as Jack prepares to leave for the navy, bidding farewell to his school and family. His father anticipates a possible encounter in the East, hinting at potential military actions and the need to bolster the army.|"['1.

Upon reaching Portsmouth, Major Archer stayed at the renowned George Inn before heading to the bustling Hard. Portsmouth was alive with activity, as the dockyards were bustling with workers preparing ships for commission. Bakeries worked tirelessly to produce biscuits, while stores were filled with supplies. In addition to warships, merchant steamers turned into transports lined the wharves. Military forces were ready for departure, and officers from various ships were ashore for duties. Major Archer's son, Jack, marveled at the scene, contrasting it with the quiet of Canterbury. A naval officer recognized Major Archer and greeted him warmly. The officer, Charles, assured Major Archer that Jack's lack of success in Latin would not hinder his performance as a sailor.

With their pockets filled with oranges, the boys embarked on their climb, completing it swiftly. At the flagstaff, they marveled at the stunning sights: the African coast, Spain sprawling to their right, the vast blue Mediterranean, and the bay with ships below. After descending, they explored fortifications and galleries overlooking the neutral ground. Disappointed by the oranges, they ventured to a Spanish village. Feeling the heat, they spotted a man with mules and decided to ride. Hawtry pulled out silver, but Jack cautioned about the price. Despite initial confusion, they agreed on a fare. Hawtry found the mule ride uncomfortable and regretted not riding bareback.|['1.

Hawtry and Jack found themselves on a dusty road, riding mules with the help of a Spaniard. Suddenly, the mules started trotting, causing Hawtry to fall. Despite the mishap, they continued their journey, admiring the sights along the way. As the sun began to set, Hawtry realized they might be lost. Using the sun's position, he determined they were heading north instead of towards Gibraltar. Concerned about the Spaniard's intentions, they followed the road as it curved towards the direction of Gibraltar. Hawtry and Jack were unsure of what to do next, fearing the possibility of an ambush.

"""We can't just attack the mule-driver without reason. We might lose, and even if we win, how do we explain killing him? Whatever happens, we must trust him for now, Jack,"" advised Hawtry. The Spaniard tried to stop them, but they ignored him. As he reached for his knife, the boys drew their dirks. The Spaniard whistled and followed them on his donkey. The boys were light and fast, but the road twisted, allowing others to block them. The boys were captured, tied up, and forced to walk uphill. After hours, they reached a plateau by the Mediterranean Sea. The captors unbound them, shared food, and seemed more interested in ransom than harm.

Jack and Hawtry found themselves in a perilous situation, captured by bandits. Despite the danger, they remained optimistic about their escape. They decided to act scared to lower the guard of their captors. Jack suggested following the example of heroic figures from stories they knew to plan their escape. They observed the surroundings, noting the sea and nearby villages, strategizing their potential routes. The bandits were tricked by their act, allowing them a chance to plan. The boys were bound again after dinner, but with determination and clever thinking, they continued to plot their escape. The arrival of a muleteer with food provided a distraction, giving them more time to strategize. Despite the odds, Jack and Hawtry remained hopeful and focused on finding a way back to safety.|"['1.

"The leader reassured the boys, indicating the rifles, saying there was no need to fear any attempt. He doubted the boys, being young, would dare such a risky move. After the meal, the muleteer handed the chief paper and a pencil. The chief wrote down ""$5000"" and showed it to the boys, gesturing to the sun's movement and drawing a line across his throat. The boys wrote a distressing letter to Captain Stuart, explaining their situation with the brigands demanding money. Another letter was written by the brigands, threatening the boys' lives if the messenger faced any trouble. The youngest boy was chosen to deliver the letters. The boys maintained a despondent facade, waiting for the right moment to escape.

Late into the night, the boys whispered about their escape plan. They were free during the day but tightly bound at night. The guards changed every two hours, staying vigilant. They decided to slip away at dusk when the group was busy cooking or talking. The slope in front was steep, and the boys observed the guards' routines. They planned to wait until dusk, distract the guards, and crawl under the blankets for cover. As the brigands returned, the boys saw an opportunity and acted quickly.

As the boys hesitated, a rifle shot rang out, narrowly missing them. Startled, they turned to see the guard, whom they thought was unconscious, now on his feet with a knife. The boys split up, with Jack circling a fire to evade the guard. Hawtry grabbed the rifle, defending against the guard's knife. Seizing a fiery brand, Jack struck the guard on the head. They then hid as men approached, discussing the gunshots. After the men passed, the boys fled swiftly down a steep path under the moonlight. Reaching a rough road near a fishing village, they debated waking the villagers but were wary of Spaniards. Eventually, they launched a boat, rowing towards Gibraltar despite Hawtry's frustration with Jack's rowing skills. The wind died, forcing them to row the remaining twenty-five miles to safety.|"['1.

"All night they rowed until the moon sank, aware that it was about three o'clock. They rested in the boat for a nap and awoke to daylight. The wind had picked up, blowing off shore, and they were five miles from land with Gibraltar's Rock rising ten miles away. ""What a nuisance!"" Hawtry exclaimed. ""This boat makes too much leeway. We must head towards the African shore and tack back."" Spotting a steamer, they hoisted the sail and caught its attention. The officers onboard helped them aboard, and after sharing their adventure, they were taken to the saloon for breakfast. The boys spent four pleasant days with the Coldstream Guards officers before reaching Malta. Upon arrival, they were met with a stern reprimand by their first lieutenant for deserting the ship."|"[""1.

"The captain scolded the boys for leaving without caution but praised their bravery. The ""Orinoco"" and Grenadiers arrived, cheered by the ""Ripon"" crew. Malta was bustling with troops and vendors. The French appeared, stirring up more excitement. War was declared, and preparations began. Jack and his friends worked hard, moving supplies.

The boys had an enjoyable evening and set off for town at half-past ten. The town was quiet and mostly asleep when they arrived, with only a few officers in the streets. They heard shouting and the clash of weapons as they passed through a dark street. Bursting into a room, they found officers defending themselves against Greeks armed with knives. The boys quickly joined the fray, using chairs to fight off the attackers. When the Greeks armed themselves with chairs, the boys lit the curtains on fire, creating chaos and allowing them to escape with the officers. As they fled, the house caught fire, illuminating the street. The boys, along with the officers, sought help as they heard their pursuers behind them.|"[""1.

"A group of English officers rushed to the scene, drawn by the noise and flames. The Greeks ceased their attack upon seeing the new arrivals. Panic spread as the fire engulfed wooden houses.

"Two days later, Jack received permission to disembark. He paused briefly, contemplating whether to choose the right or left riverbank. The plateau of Scutari was filled with British army tents, constantly increasing as troops arrived by the hour. After some consideration, Jack opted to land at Constantinople. The camps in Scutari seemed similar to those in Gallipoli, while the Turkish capital held countless wonders to explore. Jack hailed a passing caicque and sat alongside young Coveney, who also had shore leave. They were offered long pipes, but the large amber mouthpieces were challenging to use. The boat docked at Pera near the Golden Horn bridge, where the boys were amazed by the diverse crowd crossing it. Turkish, English, and French soldiers, Turkish women in veils, and porters carrying heavy loads passed by. Jack and his companion were surprised by the unveiled faces of some Turkish ladies, who seemed unfazed by the attention they received. Eventually, they crossed the bridge and met two young English officers heading in the same direction. They chatted about their regiments and recent arrivals, then explored Constantinople together. They visited bazaars, selected gifts, and later dined at Missouri's, a popular hotel for military personnel. Afterward, they rowed back to Scutari, where Harry showed them around the camp.

The rain fell steadily, and the wind picked up, making it a night to remember for the soldiers in Crimea. Jack easily found his brother's regiment, where they were left exposed to the elements. With no shelter, the men were soaked and cold. Jack suggested creating a makeshift tent using blankets and muskets.

The next day, Jack bid farewell and returned the tarpaulin, government property he had used to help his brother's regiment.

The Light Cavalry Brigade covered the advance and left flank, while the allied fleet sailed parallel to the troops, ready to provide assistance if needed. The troops were excited to finally face the enemy after months of waiting. As they marched, they encountered hares, which were caught for food during their night's rest.

The Light Division, after a hard-fought battle, faced a challenging situation. Despite their valor, they were outnumbered and unsupported. The Russians, regrouping, launched a heavy assault, forcing the Light Division to retreat. Hindered by an unfounded cavalry alarm and disorganization, they struggled to hold their ground. However, the Guards and Highland Brigade provided a shield, allowing the Light Division to regroup. Meanwhile, General Sir De Lacy Evans led a fierce fight on the right flank. Amidst the chaos and smoke, the British and French forces eventually gained the upper hand, leading to victory at the Battle of Alma.

The soldiers and sailors worked tremendously to move the guns, aided by bullocks from Constantinople and other Turkish ports. Lines of arabas carried provisions between Balaklava and the front, while mules and horses transported tents. Soldiers helped unload ships at Sebastopol, and officers on ponies bought supplies. Despite the lively atmosphere, old boatswain Dick Simpson expressed concerns about the upcoming winter and the challenges the mud might bring.

In the night, the Russians, armed and with plenty of labor, set up more guns, overpowering the French. The bombardment lessened, and it was clear that not attacking earlier was a big mistake. Ammunition was running low, and the siege's duration was uncertain. The sailors, led by Captain Peel, worked hard despite being outgunned. Tom Hammond struggled with cooking, often making mistakes that led to laughter or frustration. Inspired by an officer's tent, they dug a hole, creating a cozy shelter with a wall of sods. The tent was warmer and more spacious, a welcome change. The brothers, Jack and Tom, stayed healthy amidst the army's illnesses. Jack woke Tom to alert him of Russian movements near Balaklava, urging him to join the action.|"['1.

Jack quickly dressed, joining other midshipmen who were also in a rush. Tom brought hot coffee for four which they drank swiftly, munching biscuits as they left. Upon reaching the plateau's edge, they witnessed a dramatic scene. Turkish redoubts dotted the plain, manned by troops. Russian forces camped by the Tchernaya River, preparing to advance. British infantry readied at Balaklava to Marine Heights. Drums and bugles filled the air, troops forming up as staff-officers relayed orders. The midshipmen ran as No. 1 redoubt replied to Russian fire. Turkish forces fled, sabered by Russian cavalry. The 93d Highlanders retreated as Russians seized redoubts. Turkish troops fled towards town, under fire from naval guns. British and French forces prepared for battle, while generals observed from a distance. Russian cavalry charged towards the Highlanders, who stood firm, firing as the enemy advanced.|"['1.

When the Highlanders were within 250 yards, a flash of fire startled the Russian squadrons, causing them to retreat towards their main body. Lord Raglan then commanded Lord Lucan to advance, and the Heavy Brigade charged at the Russian cavalry. The Scots Greys and Inniskillings led the attack, cutting through the enemy. As chaos ensued, the Redcoats emerged victorious but were flanked by the Russians. The 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards joined the fight, overwhelming the Russian cavalry. The French infantry arrived, securing Balaklava. Subsequently, the Light Brigade was ordered to advance further, resulting in the infamous charge towards the distant Russian guns. Despite facing intense artillery fire, the Light Brigade courageously charged, breaking through the Russian line but sustaining heavy losses. The Heavy Brigade then covered their retreat, ensuring their safe return.|"['1.

Our troops advanced, forcing the Russians to retreat by half-past eleven, concluding the battle at Balaklava. Meanwhile, the French cavalry executed a daring assault on the left, seizing a battery but later withdrawing, losing two captains and fifty men. Our casualties included thirteen officers killed or captured, twenty-seven officers wounded, 162 men killed or captured, and 224 men wounded. Additionally, 394 horses were lost or missing, with 126 wounded. The Russians managed to seize ten guns from the redoubts they overran earlier. Upon their return to camp, Jack and his friends faced a stern reprimand for leaving camp during the battle. As October ended, the besieged and besiegers continued their bombardment, with the Russians causing trouble with their heavy shellfire. The weather worsened, weakening the soldiers, and disease spread among the ranks. Plans to capture the fortress and return to Constantinople were dashed, with supplies running low due to the muddy conditions. Jack was sent to Balaklava to deliver a message and procure supplies, returning with a pony laden with provisions, much to the amusement of his comrades. The following night, a grand feast was held, with officers scrambling to partake in the scarce luxuries brought back by Jack.|"['1.

The initial dish served was pea-soup, emitting a pleasant aroma but with a questionable look due to grease droplets on top. Despite the appetizing smell, when the first spoonful was tasted, there was an outcry. Tom, the culprit, confessed to accidentally dropping a tallow candle into the soup. The disgusted students were instructed to return the soup to the pot. Shortly after, they were presented with a generous helping of Irish stew, followed by fried ham rashers and hard biscuits. The highlight of the meal was a delectable plum-pudding from England, served with ignited brandy poured over it. The jovial atmosphere continued with songs and camaraderie, despite the inclement weather outside. The evening concluded with a reminder from the first lieutenant to abide by lights out curfew.|['1.

Allison, a young officer, observed the camaraderie between high-ranking and junior officers in the camp. He believed that being genial and approachable helped in getting work done effectively. As the night passed with laughter and songs, little did they know of the impending danger. Early the next morning, Russian forces attacked the camp. The British pickets were taken by surprise and had to fall back. The British forces, under General Pennefather, swiftly organized a defense. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the British troops fought bravely. General Cathcart led a charge but suffered heavy casualties. The 77th regiment came to the rescue of the surrounded 88th, allowing them to retreat. The battle was fierce, with individual regiments fighting valiantly against the advancing Russian forces.|['1.

The Guards were under intense pressure as a heavy Russian column advanced towards them. Despite running out of ammunition, they bravely defended the Sand-bag battery with stones. The second division faced similar challenges, enduring a storm of bullets and fierce attacks. Although the 41st and 95th regiments suffered heavy losses, they held their ground. As fresh enemy columns continued to assault, the British forces were on the brink of defeat. However, the battle took a turn when the French arrived, aiding the British in repelling the Russians.

I'll take two midshipmen and update you."" He instructed Mr. Hethcote to move all men to the battery if reinforcements were requested. The mist, thick with gunpowder smoke, enveloped them as they passed the deserted second division camp, with wounded soldiers heading to the hospital tents. The landscape was marred by fallen tents and fires caused by enemy shells. In the distance, Russian guns loomed.

Jack Archer and others were ordered to join the camp at the marine heights above Balaklava, where they found better shelter and supplies compared to the front.

Two days later, the sailors faced a storm in the Black Sea. On Friday afternoon, the wind picked up, blowing directly into the bay. The sea quickly became rough, with waves crashing against the cliffs. Ships strained at their anchors, billowing smoke to keep their engines running. An old sailor warned of the danger, fearing the ships might run aground. Despite the damage and close calls, no vessels were lost. However, the storm's intensity served as a warning. As another night of fierce winds approached, sailors prepared for the worst. The howling wind and crashing waves made it a terrifying night. Tents collapsed, and men struggled to stay upright.

In a short while, the sailors returned, carrying a long spar. They lowered it to where the boys were. A lantern lit the scene as a block was tied to the end of the spar with a rope threaded through it. Another rope was attached as a safety line. The spar was secured between rocks. The boys were fastened to the rope, face to face but separate, for the descent. They swung out from the cliff, buffeted by the wind. After a perilous descent, they reached the rocks below. They found survivors from the wreck and were hauled up to safety.

When the slings reached the top, those below stopped feeling the rope between their hands. They waited for a moment to let the others out before pulling the slings down again for a new group. Slowly, two by two, the entire party was lifted from the wreck. Throughout the rescue, loud crashes and screams echoed as vessels crashed ashore nearby.

"""That's my situation,"" Dick stated, ""although I can still move. The doctor examined me thoroughly this morning and mentioned how fortunate I am to be young with flexible bones. If I were older, I would have been severely injured. My elbows, knees, and other protruding body parts have lost their skin, and my uniform is in tatters. Nevertheless, we accomplished a great feat last night. We saved sixteen lives, received praise, and our chief will report to the Admiral, which could lead to our promotion.

Hawtry shouted for the sailors to form up and make a rush at the Russians. The sailors, led by the midshipmen, charged ahead. Despite coming under fire, they fought bravely, using the butt-ends of their muskets to push through the enemy. Jack, seeing Hawtry fall, went back to save him, shooting down a Russian attacker. Unfortunately, Jack was then struck on the head and lost consciousness. When he woke up, he found himself being carried by the Russians. Eventually, they reached a village in a valley beyond the Tchernaya River. The next day, they were taken to Sebastopol, where they were questioned by a Russian general. They were then held in a casemate at Fort St. Nicholas for two weeks, with only a soldier bringing them food. During their confinement, they could see the allied warships sailing in the sea.|"['1.

It was very cold in their unglazed shelter. They had straw and blankets to keep warm during the freezing days. Dick's leg was treated by a surgeon upon arrival and healed quickly. Their rations were meager, but the guards were kind, providing tobacco to smoke.

The food was surprisingly warm as it had been wrapped in flannel before being placed in the basket. The soup was delicious, and the meats were of exceptional quality, better than anything they had tasted since leaving England. They also enjoyed some sweets. After finishing their meal, they shared the leftovers with their guard, along with water and spirits. They then settled in the straw, wrapped in blankets, shielded their candle, and toasted to the governor's health before singing a few songs and going to sleep. The next morning, they were given sheep-skin cloaks with hoods for comfort. They were then transported across the harbor on barges, escorted by soldiers.

A small group of soldiers accompanied the convoy, led by medical officers caring for the injured. The convoy paused near a deserted village named Mamaschia by the river. The sickest were taken into houses, while the others settled under wagons. Forage was stored by the village for passing convoys, and drivers fed their animals. Guards and able men gathered firewood from orchards. The boys' guard stayed close. The doctor, with an interpreter, told the soldiers to stop watching the prisoners. The boys helped set up a tent with blankets and sticks. They made a fire, had a meal, and shared stories. The doctor praised them. The convoy moved northward without trouble. The midshipmen avoided attention with their cloaks. At a town, wagon wheels were changed. Animals suffered from famine, and many died. Bodies were buried daily, with a priest's blessing. The flat, snowy landscape was bleak. The midshipmen learned Russian words from the doctor to pass the time and potentially aid in escape.|['1.

The town was bustling with a diverse community, and its coastal location hinted at escape possibilities. Russian authorities, fearing an attack, sent prisoners inland. The daily journeys covered twelve to fifteen miles, with clear skies aiding the convoy's progress. Despite deep snow, the pace was manageable. Nights were comfortable in adapted wagons, providing warmth and shelter. The town's vibrant buildings and churches added to its cheerful atmosphere. The convoy reached a hospital in converted barracks. The midshipmen, shedding their sheepskin cloaks, attracted attention in their uniforms. The governor, a stern figure, received them. The doctor's discreet gesture advised caution in front of the governor.

Although Dick's French was not great, the girls understood him, and a lively conversation mixed with French and Russian began. The girls asked how they arrived and how they were captured. Upon learning they had been in Sebastopol, they were anxious to know the real situation there. The official reports always spoke of victories, yet the allies were still in front of Sebastopol despite being defeated. The boys' limited French and Russian were not enough to satisfy their curiosity, but they all laughed over their mistakes. The countess offered to show them their rooms. The boys were impressed by the countess and her daughters. They worried about their clothes and lack of money. The countess kindly provided them with clothes, and after cleaning up, they looked more presentable. The boys returned looking like proper British officers and gentlemen, much to the admiration of the Russian girls.|"['1.

A short while later, dinner was ready, and the countess gracefully linked arms with Dick, while Jack, slightly blushing, did the same with the eldest girl. The boys found the dinner to be splendid, with attentive servants catering to their needs. The girls, during the meal, taught the boys Russian words for items on the table, leading to laughter and a lively atmosphere. They discovered that Count Preskoff was away at his estates in the north and wouldn't return soon. After dinner, Dick politely informed Katinka that they would explore the estate without being a bother. The countess, through her daughter, welcomed their company and mentioned options for activities like riding or sledding. The elegant blue sled, with a driver in traditional attire, featured three horses harnessed uniquely, a style typical of Russian tradition.|"['1.

The boys had a thrilling ride on the sledge, with the driver cracking his whip and the horses racing across the plain. As the wind blew in their faces, they declared sledging to be the most fun they had ever experienced. After returning to the chateau, they were warmly welcomed by the countess and her daughters. The evening was filled with music and singing, with Jack joining in the harmonies. The boys kept their knowledge of Russian a secret, fearing it might change their situation. The countess, though cold at first, eventually engaged in conversation with the commandant, discussing the ongoing war efforts and the suffering of the enemy troops.

The young girl sat at the piano, playing without pause. Her music filled the room for an hour, captivating those present. Count Smerskoff, after a while, grew restless but remained seated until politeness allowed him to excuse himself. Olga praised the girl's clever tactic of playing continuously to unsettle the count. The countess, aware of the count's connections and potential threats, cautioned against offending him. Olga later explained to Jack, while riding in a sledge, the political tensions within Russia. Her father's liberal views had put him at odds with the autocratic Czar, leading to his banishment from court. The family faced the risk of further repercussions due to their political stance. Additionally, a looming threat was the unwanted proposal from the governor, Count Smerskoff, to marry Katinka, which could bring more trouble to the family due to his influential connections.|"['1.

Both Jack and Dick agreed that action needed to be taken. They were content with their current situation in the family but were concerned about the countess and her daughters falling prey to someone unworthy. Jack expressed his disdain for the man wanting to marry Katinka and wished they could teach him a lesson. The boys declined riding horses to avoid looking foolish but eagerly embraced the opportunity for wolf-shooting. They set off in a sledge with guns and meat as bait. As they waited in the forest, the moonlight revealed approaching wolves. The coachman and woodmen prepared for the impending chase, ensuring the horses were ready to flee if needed.|['1.

The boys had an idea that the wolves would stop to devour their fallen comrade, but the smell of the meat was more tempting. The lads fired repeatedly, the woodmen handing them spare guns and loading fast. The coachman drove faster for a bit, then stopped suddenly. The peasants leaped out, blindfolded the horses, and jumped back into the sledge. The late pursuers growled and fought over the meat. The peasants loaded the guns and prepared to fire at the wolves.

Odessa was bustling with wounded soldiers, yet the boys roamed freely through the town unnoticed. They passed by shops run by Frenchmen and Germans, evidence of the once thriving trade that now lay dormant due to the war. The harbor, once teeming with ships, now sat empty except for a few brigs and naval vessels. Feeling uneasy upon learning of a Polish regiment in town, the boys quickly finished their meal at an eatery and planned to leave. However, their departure was interrupted by a sergeant and soldiers entering. The landlord greeted the sergeant, mentioning the wounded Polish compatriots. The sergeant, speaking in Polish, envied the boys' journey home. The boys realized they were in a precarious situation and decided to stock up on provisions and leave Odessa promptly.|"['1.

"Dick was momentarily stunned, but Jack remembered three phrases the countess had taught him about Poland's insurgent bands.

As they journeyed across the south of Russia, the two friends found their walking abilities improving each day, allowing them to cover thirty-five miles without trouble. Upon entering Poland, they realized their disguises as Polish soldiers were no longer sustainable. Therefore, they purchased peasant attire and concealed their military uniforms in a forest. While avoiding conversations and sticking to quiet villages for purchases, they observed troops on the move, indicating a troubled state in the country. Their cautious approach was validated when they were suddenly seized by insurgents during a dusk encounter with Russian troops. Despite their attempts to explain, they were accused of being Russian spies due to a misunderstanding at a village shop.

The boys were now able to observe the diverse group gathered in the clearing. Most were peasants, but a few stood out with their refined attire and demeanor. While some peasants carried guns, most wielded scythes attached to long handles, formidable weapons in close combat.

The boys were offered shelter in a village or the option to join the Polish group fighting for freedom against Russian oppression. The Polish leader shared the harsh realities faced by the Polish people and the ongoing struggle for independence.

The boys wanted to join the group cutting trees to build a defense. Stanislas chose a lieutenant who spoke Russian to lead 200 men as per the boys' plan. They arrived at the spot before dawn and set up a strategic defense. They placed guns behind trees and built an earthwork with guns ready to fire. Trees were felled to create a barrier on both sides of the road. The boys scattered green boughs to camouflage the defense. Stanislas and his men arrived and approved the setup. The Russian column approached, and the boys waited for the signal to attack. The Russians fired over the obstacle, thinking it was unmanned. The boys signaled their attack, and the Poles prepared to strike.|['1.

The 200 men stationed behind the barricade were armed with muskets. Each man hid behind the leaves, rested his musket on a branch, and waited for the advancing column. When the signal was given, two guns loaded with grape-shot roared, causing chaos among the Russian infantry. The Poles hidden behind the abattis then opened fire, decimating the advance guard and causing confusion among the artillery. Despite the Russian officers' attempts to regroup, the situation worsened as the unseen foes behind the abattis joined the fight. The midshipmen and Poles fought fiercely, repelling the Russians repeatedly. The Russians, overwhelmed and with their retreat threatened, eventually fell back. The Poles claimed victory, capturing ammunition, stores, and artillery.

On the evening following the battle, a meeting was held to discuss the next steps. The Polish peasants, after their victory, wanted to return home briefly. Various plans were suggested, and the officers sought advice from the young midshipmen. One proposal stood out - to seize the momentum and launch an offensive by attacking a Russian garrison at Piaski. The plan was met with enthusiasm, and preparations began. The men were trained in using Russian muskets, and equipped with scythes for close combat. The attack was set for the next night. The troops, divided into separate bands, would converge at the market square at one in the morning. Each group was assigned a target, and hidden guns were prepared to breach the barracks' gates. The men, in silent sandals, set out on their mission, aiming to surprise the enemy and secure victory.|['1.

There was no more need to hide, and with a loud cheer, the group charged ahead. Some men attacked the gate with axes, which the guard had closed behind him. A cannon, near the front, was positioned close to the gate, its barrel aimed at the lock. When it fired, it made a hole in the gate, but a thick bar kept it shut. Another shot broke the bar, and the Poles triumphantly rushed in. A fierce battle followed. Some Russians, caught off guard and afraid of the sudden attack, barely resisted and jumped out of windows to escape. Others fought fiercely, defending themselves until they were defeated. The absence of their officers proved fatal as they were used to following orders. The Poles quickly took control of the barracks. Jack Archer and his men then prepared the horses and wagons. They looted the barracks, set it on fire, and left for the forest. The other division also succeeded, while the town lit up with burning barracks. The group decided not to attack the last barrack to avoid unnecessary casualties. The townspeople cheered as the patriot band marched through the town, and some joined the fight.

In the morning, the guns were moved deeper into the forest. Most of the group decided to return home for a few days, with plans to reconvene in ten days. Around 400 men stayed behind, and the count asked the midshipmen to select enough men for two batteries of 80 each to train during this time. Meanwhile, the count headed to his estates about 80 miles away to gather more men. Six days later, many new recruits joined the band in the forest, eager to fight after hearing of recent victories. However, news arrived that Count Stanislas had been captured by the Russians and was to be executed in Lublin. The group decided to attempt a daring rescue, disguising themselves in Russian uniforms for the mission. They learned the details and prepared to save their beloved leader.|"['1.

In a daring move, a group of fighters faced off against the cavalry, holding them back while their comrades fled down side streets to regroup in the forest. As the garrison closed in, a final charge was made, and the group raced after their friends. Two brave midshipmen fought together, making a narrow escape down a street. Just when they thought they were safe, more cavalry appeared at the opposite end, with more in pursuit. Feeling trapped, they dashed down a lane towards open country. Spotting a large mansion, they leaped through an open window, surprising a young English governess inside. She agreed to hide them, but warned of the risk as the palace might be searched.

Throughout the day, officials and messengers entered and exited the room, including the chief of police, who reported a thorough search of the palace but found no trace of the fugitives. The general ordered a close watch on the house and planned another search the next day. The midshipmen, hiding against the wall, waited anxiously. When the room emptied, a lady assured them of safety in her private sitting-room. She offered them biscuits and discussed a risky plan for their escape disguised as the governor's daughters. Despite the danger, the midshipmen agreed to the plan to avoid prolonged hiding and the constant threat of discovery.|"['1.

The midshipmen quickly agreed to the plan and changed into the clothes provided by their friend, Agnes Sinclair. She taught them how to walk, talk, and behave like the general's daughters, ensuring they would pass a casual inspection. Agnes reassured them that they were safe in her room until the servants arrived at half-past seven. She even provided them with gloves and bonnets to complete their disguise. Agnes instructed them on how to act when they would leave for the public promenade in a carriage waiting at nine. She warned them about the two soldiers who would follow the carriage but reminded them that they had their revolvers. The boys thanked Agnes for her help and assured her that their families would appreciate her kindness.

With a brief thank you, the boys bid farewell to Miss Sinclair. She advised them to move leisurely and cautiously, ensuring the passage was clear before proceeding. The boys followed her instructions, walking slowly and stiffly, pistols ready. As they reached the grand hall, they were mistaken for the governor's daughters and treated with respect. They boarded a carriage bound for the promenade, but an officer on horseback caught up with them. The officer recommended they return home due to recent events. Suspicion arose as the coachman noticed something odd about the boys' voices. Upon reaching the deserted promenade, the boys took control of the carriage, surprising the soldiers who approached. A confrontation ensued, leading to a daring escape with a shot fired at the soldiers.|"['1.

The horses raced at full speed as they fled from their pursuers, a group of soldiers and officers. With the forest in sight, the midshipmen urged the horses on, knowing they could lose their chasers in the dense woods. Once in the safety of the forest, they abandoned their borrowed finery and continued on foot. They stumbled upon peasants who led them to the insurgents' hideout. Count Stanislas welcomed them warmly, relieved to see them safe. The midshipmen shared their daring escape story, omitting details to protect their allies. The count proposed moving west to regroup with other rebel forces. After a ten-day march, they joined a larger band of rebels, eager to take the offensive.

"""Now,"" he told the midshipmen, ""I will keep my word. The border is only fifty miles away. I will dispatch a scout to find a spot with boats on our side of the river. At dawn, I will lead 150 men, and I am confident that a surprise attack will help us break through the guards."" The strategy unfolded smoothly. The young sailors, accustomed to long walks, covered the fifty miles before nightfall. Their contact informed them that most boats had been moved, except for a few in a village occupied by 200 Russian soldiers. The midshipmen suggested sneaking in for a boat, but their ally dismissed the risky idea. After a brief rest, they resumed their journey. Just before dawn, they reached the village. A sentry fired, and the Poles charged forward. The plan was for the count and the midshipmen to head to the water while the others attacked the Russian-occupied houses. The noise of battle erupted, but as the Poles achieved their goal, they retreated. They rowed across the river, encountering Austrian sentries who guided them to an officer.

Jack explained that he would share the full story later as it was too lengthy to narrate at that moment. He was eager to hear about the events in Sebastopol since he had been away and only knew that it had not fallen yet. The soldiers in the Crimea faced severe hardships, worse than what Jack had experienced. After the storm and the Battle of Inkerman, the generals realized taking Sebastopol before spring was impossible. The troops suffered greatly due to lack of proper supplies and the harsh winter conditions. Balaklava was filled with essentials, but the soldiers at the front lacked these necessities. The troops were physically exhausted, making it challenging to even travel to Balaklava for urgent supplies. The situation improved as spring arrived, with the arrival of reinforcements, the construction of a railway, and better health conditions for the soldiers.|"[""1.

The preparation for the re-opening of the bombardment continued energetically, with the arrival of Turkish and Sardinian troops strengthening the allies' positions. Despite the Russians' initial success, Sebastopol had transformed into a heavily fortified city. The Russians constantly launched sorties, challenging the allies in the trenches. The ground in front of Russian works was filled with rifle-pits, making it dangerous for the allies to operate their guns. In winter, fierce battles occurred in the dark, resulting in more casualties than pitched battles. The fleet finally took action, capturing Yenikale and destroying Russian vessels supplying Sebastopol. The fleet's actions in the Sea of Azof disrupted Russian supply lines. Jack learned of promotions among his comrades and shared his adventures with his superiors. Captain Hethcote considered assigning Jack as an interpreter due to his Russian language skills.|"[""1.

After a lot of traveling since leaving Breslau, the captain was looking forward to some peace. However, he was ready to follow orders and excited for the upcoming adventures. The next day, the captain was invited to dine with Admiral Lyons, who was interested in hearing all about the captain's experiences. Admiral Lyons confirmed the captain's plans and instructed him to report to the naval brigade at the front. On the 5th of June, Jack received his orders and set off with two sailors towards the front. Balaklava had transformed into a bustling town with new uniforms for the troops and a lively atmosphere. Jack caught a ride on a train and marveled at the changes around him. Upon reaching the camp, Jack was assigned as an aide-de-camp and interpreter.

The day after his arrival, everyone anticipated the resumption of the bombardment. At half-past two, the British and French batteries thundered with over 800 guns, while the Russians retaliated. The hot, still day cloaked the hillside in smoke, obscuring the cannonade's impact. It wasn't until the following morning that the Russian batteries showed any signs of damage. The allies relentlessly fired, prompting intermittent responses from the Russians. News spread of an imminent assault at six o'clock. French troops advanced towards the Mamelon, overcoming Russian resistance. The Zouaves led the charge, successfully securing the parapet. Despite Russian attempts to repel them, the French maintained their ground. The battle intensified as the French pushed forward, gaining control of the Mamelon. The Zouaves valiantly attacked the Round Tower but were forced to retreat. Meanwhile, the British forces seized the advance trenches, engaging in fierce combat throughout the night. The following day, an armistice allowed for the burial of the fallen, fostering camaraderie between the opposing sides.|"[""1.

At six o'clock, the guns resumed firing as the Russians armed fresh batteries to counter our works. We faced heavy losses maintaining the quarries against enemy batteries. The French and British ships bombarded Sebastopol on the nights of the 16th and 17th. Marshal Pelissier and Lord Raglan planned an assault for June 18th. The British force was divided into three columns under Sir John Campbell, Colonel Shadforth, and Colonel Lacy Yea. The French planned to attack Russian bastions with six columns. The assault began early, but a premature attack failed. The British columns faced overwhelming Russian fire, resulting in heavy losses. Despite bravery, the assault was futile, with officers killed and men struggling against strong defenses. The naval brigade supported the attack but suffered casualties, including wounded officers.|['1.

Jack, in the morning, regretted not being part of the service. However, upon learning the heavy losses suffered by those who participated, he was relieved he wasn't assigned the duty. The British lost 22 officers and 247 men killed, with many more wounded. The French also suffered losses, with 39 officers killed and 93 wounded, and 1600 men killed or captured. The Russian losses were even more significant, with 5800 killed or wounded. Jack, along with others, watched the scene from Cathcart Hill but could barely grasp the intensity of the battle due to the distance and smoke. The disappointment after the failed attack was palpable, with wounded soldiers expressing regret and anger over the defeat. The following day, a truce allowed for the burial of the dead and retrieval of the wounded. Lord Raglan passed away shortly after, succeeded by General Simpson. Jack's brother, Harry, arrived at his tent, bringing news from home and sharing in the relief of Jack's safety.|"['1.

"Jack, you're fortunate,"" Harry exclaimed. ""All those adventures you've had will be tales for a lifetime."" ""I'm recovering,"" Harry continued. ""Dealt with typhus and frostbite, lost two toes, but can march fine. Typhus left me weak, but the wind from England revived me. I thought you were dead, but here you are, having fun with Russian girls."" The days passed calmly. On July 12th, Jack joined a reconnaissance with his commander towards Baidar, avoiding the Russians. Both sides worked on trenches. The French progressed swiftly towards the Malakoff, a key Russian post. A storm hit on the 31st, but little damage occurred. Rumors of a Russian attack circulated, but no one expected a major battle.

General Della Marmora quickly sent reinforcements to hold the bridge against the advancing Russians. Despite heavy artillery fire from both sides, the Russians charged forward but were repelled by the Sardinians. The French and Sardinians fought bravely, driving the Russians back across the bridge. The battle was fierce, with casualties on all sides. Eventually, the Russians retreated, unable to overcome the allied forces' strong defense. The camp life following the battle was lively, with races, music from regimental bands, and cheerful dinner parties.

During the winter, the French troops were in poor condition, while the British soldiers were well cared for due to public support. Large sums were collected, and ships with supplies were sent to the British troops. In contrast, the sufferings of the French soldiers were hidden from their people, resulting in no aid for them. The French troops faced illnesses while the British soldiers were healthy. Jack, an interpreter, took a break on a ship for a few days to rest and row along the cliffs. Rest and letters from home brought him joy. Letters from loved ones provide comfort and a break from the challenges of life. Jack received a letter from Count Preskoff, bringing news of hope and reform in Russia. Jack returned to camp happily after his break.

Lieutenant Myers received news of a planned reconnaissance from a fellow officer in the Sardinian army. The mission was kept hush-hush to avoid overcrowding. Only a few joined the 400 cavalry members on the journey. Jack, used to flat lands, marveled at the lush valley they rode through. Deserted villages dotted the landscape, stripped by past looters. As they rode, gunfire erupted from a country house. The Sardinians swiftly overtook the enemy, celebrating their victory. Meanwhile, a soldier warned of approaching foes.

They explored the rooms of the once-occupied house, finding traces of recent habitation. Women's belongings adorned the table, a canary sang in its cage, and a meal was left half-prepared. Gathering keepsakes, they took small items like Greek saint pictures, a bronze statuette, and old plates. Jack secured a work-box for his sister. As they planned to leave, a sudden thick fog descended, hindering visibility. Concerned about the returning Sardinians, they decided to head to the valley. Jack suggested retrieving Cossack cloaks and lances from the house. After a successful trip back to the chateau, he overheard Russian voices and gathered Cossack attire from fallen soldiers.

The lieutenant spotted a boat approaching the shore and quickly signaled for it to land in front of the village. The boat was in distress, likely blown off course by the wind. Despite the rough sea, the sailors skillfully navigated the boat to safety. However, upon reaching shore, they were mistaken for enemies and engaged in a scuffle with the officers. Eventually, they realized the sailors were friends and learned about the nearby Russian camp. To avoid capture, they decided to row back out to sea, dodging Russian fire.

Three jets of earth and dust suddenly shot into the air as the French detonated three mines, igniting a three-mile-long stream of fire between batteries. The ensuing volley wreaked havoc on the Russian defenses, causing chaos and destruction.

As darkness fell, mortars and heavy guns continued the assault, illuminating the sky with bursts of flames and explosions. The following day, the English intensified their attack, keeping the Russians on their toes.

The British were ordered not to attack until the French captured the Malakoff. With 30,000 men ready, the French swiftly took the Malakoff by surprise. The Russians tried to fight back but were overwhelmed. The French quickly hoisted their flag on the parapet. The English then joined the battle, facing heavy fire as they advanced towards the Redan. The Russian resistance was weak, and the English stormed the Redan. The Russians retreated, firing from their defenses. The English paused inside, losing their regimental order. Fresh Russian troops arrived, intensifying the fight. After heavy casualties, the remaining English soldiers retreated to their trenches.

Jack Archer was deeply saddened because his brother had been badly injured in a battle. The doctors were not very optimistic about his chances of survival. His brother was shot in the hip while trying to gather his company, just before the Russian army pushed back the remaining attackers. At eleven o'clock, there were two huge explosions that shook the hut where they were. Some wounded officers asked Jack to go to Cathcart's Hill to see what was happening. Jack agreed and found many officers and soldiers heading in the same direction. When he reached a spot where he could see Sebastopol, he witnessed a spectacular sight. The town was on fire in many places, and there were continuous explosions as the Russian forts were blown up one after another. By morning, the city was in ruins, surrounded by destroyed batteries. The English army was pleased with the victory but felt disappointed that they had not played a significant role in the battle compared to the French. Despite the defeat, there was no animosity between the English and French troops. The following day, officers inspected the battleground, finding many casualties.

None who had rested on the vine-covered hill that night anticipated the great siege ahead. Only a few who fought at the Alma remained at Sebastopol. The battle of Inkerman, trench hardships, Redan repulses, and harsh winter had taken a toll. The armies prepared for winter by digging deep holes under tents. Harry Archer, wounded, was sent to Balaklava. The surgeons couldn't remove the bullet. Hope lay in his youth and health. Weeks passed with both armies watching. An expedition aimed to destroy Kinburn forts. The British and French fleets set sail towards Odessa. The sight was grand. Odessa was defenseless against the armada. Controversy arose over capturing Odessa. The fleet then turned towards Kinburn, where they bombarded Fort Kinburn successfully.|['1.

Finally, realizing they could not fight any longer, the commanding officer raised the white flag. The fort on the opposite shore was destroyed by the Russians, and their fleet entered the channel. Troops were landed, Kinburn was captured, and held until the war ended. The fleet returned to Sebastopol after a reconnaissance mission up the Dneiper. The winter was uneventful except for daily exchanges of fire between the north and south sides. A massive explosion shook the area for miles, causing casualties. An armistice was signed in February, ending the war. Jack returned home after his ship's journey, much changed. He then joined a naval brigade during the Indian Mutiny, where he showed bravery. After the war, he returned to his ship, now a respected officer. Later, he visited his Russian friends in Paris.|"['1.
