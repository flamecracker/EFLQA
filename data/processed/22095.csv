Nona's mother, Anna Orlaff, held strong beliefs in equality and social justice, inspired by the writings of Tolstoi, a great Russian writer. Due to her socialist views, she was sent away from her homeland to the United States. Nona, unaware of her mother's past, began to uncover the truth through a letter from Sonya Valesky, a friend of her mother. The letter revealed her mother's struggles in a conservative society that rejected her ideals. Nona's father, disapproving of Anna's beliefs, had kept her past hidden, but Nona's curiosity led her to discover the truth. As Nona delved into her mother's history, she realized the importance of embracing differences and standing up for one's beliefs, even in the face of adversity. Through this journey, Nona learned about the power of acceptance and the value of seeking the truth.|"[""1.

Nona Davis stood up suddenly, filled with questions she longed to ask. Luckily, she was close to Sonya Valesky, who might have the answers. Sonya had never explained why she hadn't looked for Nona until they met by chance on the ship. Was she too focused on her own life and mission to notice? Despite preparing to approach Sonya, Nona hesitated. Why was Sonya living near the Russian fortifications with only two old peasants? And why did a Russian officer warn her about his friend, Michael Orlaff? The name reminded Nona of her mother. Nona decided to trust Sonya unless given a reason not to.

Nona Davis, dressed in her Red Cross nurse outfit, greeted two men in uniform at the door. They turned out to be police officers sent to take Sonya to Petrograd. Sonya had been hiding near Grovno for months, hoping to evade capture. Sonya believed she had done nothing wrong and hoped to explain herself to the Russian authorities. The church in Grovno, with its golden dome, was a target due to its visibility. Mildred, visiting the church, admired its beauty and unique Russian religious paintings. She found solace in the peaceful atmosphere. The Russian church's lack of pews and use of colorful paintings intrigued her, despite not understanding the service.

I need to inform you, Mildred and Barbara, that I am pleased about our upcoming trip to Petrograd. I had planned to go back there alone. I previously mentioned Sonya's arrest but didn't share that I aim to support her. She appears to have no one except her elderly servants, Katja and Nika. I might not be able to do much, but I've asked Eugenia for financial help to assist Sonya. I wish to leave soon as I'm uncertain about her whereabouts and trial date. Mildred, Nona, I understand you may not value my advice, but I believe it's best to avoid getting involved with Sonya's political situation in Petrograd. Let's rest now; we can think clearly in the morning.|"['1.

In the hospital, more and more wounded soldiers filled the wards, leaving little space for cots. Uncertainty loomed as news was scarce about the ongoing battle. Signs of outer defenses falling hinted at a possible retreat by General Alexis. Mildred suspected a plan to draw the enemy deeper into Russia. As heavy guns were swiftly moved away from Grovno, the idea of a strategic retreat took shape. Despite the continued firing from the fortress, preparations for a potential withdrawal were evident. Slowly, others began to grasp the situation as munitions were relocated, signaling a shift in the battle's direction. Mildred kept her thoughts to herself, aware of the implications of a possible retreat.|"['1.

Even in the midst of danger, the American Red Cross girls felt relieved to learn they were being relocated from Grovno. They were instructed not to follow the army but to head to Petrograd as soon as they reached a railroad. There, hospitals awaited them. The girls, though not without fear, were reassured by General Alexis' care for the wounded. They were to travel through open roads, while the Germans were kept at bay by ancient stone walls. The departure from the fortress courtyard was somber, with wounded soldiers, nurses, and a physician boarding carts for the journey. The girls, in their Red Cross uniforms, prepared for the cold night ahead. Barbara, bundled up in layers, anticipated the challenging yet unforgettable experience of traveling through the unfamiliar Russian landscape.|['1.

As soon as Barbara finished her speech, a Russian army colonel from General Alexis's personal staff emerged from a nearby door where the three girls stood. Although they didn't know his name, they recognized his rank by his uniform. They had noticed him always by the general's side as one of his main aides. Instead of joining the soldiers preparing to march, the officer paused outside the door, scanning his surroundings. The girls, too overwhelmed to speak, watched in silence. Mildred caught the officer's eye when she moved, and he approached her. Mildred returned shortly, visibly shaken, and revealed that she couldn't accompany them to Petrograd. She explained that General Alexis had been wounded but refused to leave, and they might need a nurse. Mildred had been asked to stay behind by Colonel Feodorovitch.|"[""1.

Barbara urgently argued with Mildred, explaining that she couldn't abandon her. Barbara reminded Mildred of the importance of their safety, especially since General Alexis wished for them to be in Petrograd before the retreat. Mildred was hesitant, mentioning the language barrier with Colonel Feodorovitch. Mildred felt a duty to help General Alexis during the crisis, even if it meant leaving her friends. As they rode in a wagon towards the Styr River, the girls encountered desolate scenes of burnt and ruined peasant homes. The peasants were fleeing, carrying their belongings. The night was dark and the driver struggled with the horses. Barbara used an electric lamp gifted by Dick Thornton to light their way.|"[""**1.

A mix of voices filled the air as men gathered around fires, waiting for tea to brew. The soldiers, now forbidden from drinking alcohol by the Czar, had diverse features that puzzled the girls. Some resembled the Chinese, hinting at their Asian roots from beyond the Caspian Sea. Nona and Barbara speculated on their history, catching the interest of a wounded Russian soldier, a university graduate. The American girls watched ambulance wagons cross a bridge, feeling for Mildred Thornton left behind in a besieged fortress. Nona wrestled with worries about Mildred's safety, understanding her friend's sense of duty.

Nona's attention shifted from Mildred to her friend Sonya Valesky. She wondered how to find Sonya in the vast city of Petrograd. Without even saying goodbye to Lieutenant Orlaff, who had promised to help Sonya. Nona was determined to locate her. She even thought of seeking the Czar's pardon if Sonya left for the United States. As they assisted wounded soldiers onto the train, Nona and Barbara saw their resilience and cheerfulness. Despite the soldiers' suffering, they found solace in the journey to Petrograd. Barbara worried about Mildred's whereabouts. A few days later, Nona fell ill with malarial fever.

In response to Nona's concerns about her health and discomfort meeting new people, the elderly lady assured them they could stay in a private section of her lavish Petrograd home. They would only interact with the house staff. The wealthy American Countess, eager to help, welcomed Barbara and Nona. They settled in a grand house on Nevski Prospect, Petrograd's equivalent of Fifth Avenue. The Countess, busy with wartime relief efforts, respected the girls' desire for solitude. Despite her social standing, she valued their independence. Nona, torn between seeking her missing friend Sonya and following the Countess's advice, chose to wait for unexpected aid.

In Petrograd, the Russian streets were covered with ice, making them as smooth as glass. The shops displayed painted pictures for those who couldn't read. Most buildings in the city were stucco, resembling a poor version of Paris. Peter the Great aimed to westernize Russia, bringing artists from France and Italy to model the city. The Winter Palace faced a river and a square, with a monument of Alexander the First nearby. The Hermitage, once Catherine's palace, is a renowned art museum. Despite being in Petrograd for weeks, the Red Cross girls hadn't visited the gallery. Barbara suggested seeing the paintings but Nona preferred to stroll the town. They decided to return the sleigh to the Countess and explore side streets off Nevski Prospect. The girls, tired from the cold, preferred to save the gallery visit for another day.|"['1.

Nona and Barbara found themselves alone in the Russian streets after the sleigh they were in drove away. Nona, gifted in languages, found the Russian atmosphere more appealing than the interior of the shops. Barbara, fascinated by Russian brass, explored the goods on display. Nona, with limited funds, observed the crowd while waiting for Barbara. The shop was busy with people, including soldiers buying trinkets for loved ones. The Russian women wore heavy shawls and had distinct features. Suddenly, a peasant woman startled Nona, who then remembered the safety of Russian churches.

The next day, Nona Davis marveled at the glistening onion-shaped domes that adorned Petrograd. Russian priests explained that these domes symbolized the church on earth blossoming in heaven, resembling folded rosebuds. Among them, the Cathedral of St. Isaac stood out with its central dome, a massive copper ball covered in gold, radiating brilliance from afar. Nona set out to find it, admiring the blue domes studded with stars representing the sky's canopy. Despite her attempts to deceive Barbara about her true intentions, Barbara saw through her plans. Nona eventually left to search for Sonya, who was imprisoned for treason. Katja, unable to read or write, shared Sonya's message through a friend, asking Nona to bid farewell on her behalf.

Nona and Barbara shared a room in their new lodgings. Nona, feeling lonely and sad, couldn't focus on Barbara's reading. Her mind wandered to Sonya Valesky, a noblewoman turned Russian nihilist, sentenced to life in Siberia for treason. Nona felt a deep connection to Sonya, like the older sister she never had. As they prepared to leave Europe as Red Cross nurses, Mildred surprised them. Nona, trying to hide her tears, opened the door to find Mildred, who was warmly welcomed by both girls. Despite her elegant attire, Mildred's presence overshadowed her outfit. The girls embraced her joyfully, happy to be reunited.|"[""1.

Barbara was frantic with worry upon Mildred's sudden arrival. Mildred, exhausted from her recent experiences, explained that she had just reached Petrograd with General Alexis and his team, along with their Russian maid, after being left behind at Grovno. Despite her hunger, Barbara bombarded her with questions about their time at Grovno and their encounter with the Germans. Nona, noticing Mildred's fatigue, intervened and urged Barbara to fetch some food. Mildred, humble and unassuming, recounted the events in a calm manner. She revealed how they had bravely held off the Germans at Grovno, with General Alexis wounded but determined to fulfill his duty. Mildred, the Red Cross nurse, had stayed behind against the general's wishes but was cared for by the Russian maid. Despite the danger and hardships, Mildred remained composed and selfless throughout the ordeal.|"[""1.

Mildred shared her daring escape from Grovno with Nona, explaining how they had been away for almost two weeks. They fled through an underground passage to the river, where motor cars awaited them. General Alexis, wounded and ill, needed urgent care. They sought refuge in a deserted Russian house to tend to his grave wound, which was more severe than anticipated. The group had to blow up bridges to prevent the Germans from following them. Mildred, overwhelmed by the magnitude of their ordeal, recounted the perilous journey and the battle that lay ahead. Barbara, captivated by the tale, listened intently as Mildred unfolded the harrowing events that had kept her away and preoccupied with saving General Alexis's life.|"['1.

Barbara asked about General Alexis's recovery, impressed by Mildred's care. Mildred humbly clarified that the general hadn't fully recovered but was well enough to be moved to Petrograd for safety and to meet the Czar. Barbara admired Mildred's humility and lack of regard for social status. Nona agreed, praising Mildred's down-to-earth nature. Mildred explained that she wouldn't continue nursing the general but would see him at the Winter Palace, where he would stay in close proximity to the Czar. Mildred preferred being with her friends in Petrograd rather than at the palace. She mentioned that another nurse would take her place, emphasizing that her presence at the palace was not personal.|"[""1.

"The other girl blushed and giggled. ""I never thought of that, Bab dear. Please keep it a secret. We might meet the Czar and Czarina soon, even if it's just for a short while. General Alexis wants to introduce us. He appreciates what I did. But, Bab, please don't say I refused to nurse him. I only asked for a replacement who might be more skilled."" The next day, Nona shared Sonya Valesky's fate with Mildred. Mildred was more concerned than Barbara because of her understanding nature. Mildred received a note from General Alexis inviting them to the Winter Palace to meet the Czar and Czarina. The girls knew it was more of a command than an invitation. They had to wear their Red Cross uniforms. Despite having limited clothing due to constant moving, they looked dignified and stunning in their Red Cross attire at the Palace.

Mildred blushed and snuggled into her soft brown furs. She explained how General Alexis had kindly gifted her the coat after she left hers behind. Barbara wondered if General Alexis had special feelings for Mildred, but quickly dismissed the thought. The girls were escorted to a room in the Winter Palace, where they were greeted by General Alexis and Lieutenant Michael Orlaff. The reception was a result of Mildred's bravery, unknown to her at the time. The Czar and Czarina, seated like ordinary hosts, welcomed the girls. The Czarina, known for her beauty but plagued by deep sadness, left a lasting impression on the visitors. Despite the guards nearby, the royal couple received their guests with grace and warmth.|"['1.

Barbara and her friends were honored to meet the Czar and Czarina, a rare privilege for American Red Cross nurses in Europe. Despite the grandeur of the occasion, Barbara felt awkward and unsure of what to do. The Czar appeared older than expected, possibly aged by the war. He awarded Mildred, one of the nurses, the prestigious Cross of St. George for her bravery, comparing her valor to that of a Russian war hero. After the ceremony, they were given a tour of the palace, including a painting said to be by St. Luke. Despite the excitement, the girls were relieved to return to their lodgings. Barbara found General Alexis, who accompanied them, to be handsome and younger than she had thought.

Barbara watched as Mildred and General Alexis prepared for their sleigh ride, feeling a mix of regret and relief for not joining them. She observed the scene from the window, noting the Imperial livery of the driver and the guard in citizen's clothes. Despite the potential for danger, public figures in Russia remained vigilant against fanatics. Reflecting on her decision not to go, Barbara reasoned that it would have disrupted the group's dynamics. She contemplated writing to Dick about General Alexis but found it challenging to articulate her thoughts. She admired the general's courtesy and quiet dignity, finding him surprisingly similar to men she knew in the United States. Mildred, on the other hand, felt a sense of ease sharing personal stories with General Alexis, appreciating his sympathetic nature despite their differing political views.|"['1.

General Alexis behaved in a very innocent way, almost like a young boy rather than a respected European figure. Mildred was taken aback by his words and wondered if he was expressing his love for her. She had never expected a proposal, especially from someone she admired so much. Mildred was speechless at first, but later expressed her gratitude for his feelings. General Alexis understood her concerns and assured her that he wouldn't ask her to marry him until after the war. He just wanted to write to her and hoped to visit her in happier times. Mildred was touched by his consideration for her well-being and her situation in a foreign land. As they walked back in silence, Mildred thought about how her father and mother would feel about General Alexis's proposal.

Four days later, the three American girls departed from Petrograd earlier than planned due to a safe opportunity to travel across Europe into France. The journey was arduous, crossing Finland, Sweden, and Norway before reaching Holland, then on to England and France due to the ongoing conflict in southern Europe. They were accompanied by Sonya Valesky, an exile from Russia, who had been pardoned by the Czar at General Alexis' request. Despite her quiet demeanor and past hardships, the American girls showed her kindness and affection during their travels. They were headed back to the chateau country of France, where they were welcomed by Madame Castaigne and planned to stay at the farmhouse with the blue front door.
