The aircraft Tom was working on had a unique design. Unlike traditional planes, Tom's craft had an air-cooled motor located at the front, just above the heads of the operator and passenger. The propeller was ten feet in diameter, providing a minimum thrust of one thousand pounds at two thousand revolutions per minute. This gave Tom's craft an advantage over others with smaller propellers that produced less thrust. Despite its light and delicate appearance, the monoplane was actually quite sturdy due to innovative bracing techniques. As Tom continued to work on his speedy aircraft with his father and Mr. Jackson, he couldn't shake off his worries about the missing plans. One day, while working on the plane in his shop, Tom was interrupted by Mrs. Baggert, who seemed troubled. Tom immediately feared for his father's health and rushed to attend to the situation.|"['1.

Tom asked Mr. Sharp to stay a few days longer to help gather clues against Andy Foger and witness a trial flight of the Humming-Bird. However, Tom's plans were delayed as Mr. Swift fell ill, keeping Tom busy at home. Despite Tom's efforts to seek information about Andy, a week passed without progress. Tom pondered how to gather the needed information. Suddenly, Mr. Damon arrived, eager to assist Tom in his quest. Mr. Damon proposed disguising himself as a tramp to investigate the Fogers' activities.

"The man, surprised by the explanation and the need for silence, sought solace with his mule in the stable. ""Never mind,"" chuckled the odd gentleman, explaining the disguise and the impending blessing. Tom, eager and dressed in rags, accompanied him toward the Foger home. Waiting until the house was dark, they cautiously approached the shed. Inside, using a flashlight, they found only empty walls and rubbish, not the expected airplane. Surprised, they hesitated, expecting to see the stolen plans materialize. As they left, they heard noises near the main doors, where the Anthony was kept. Chuckling softly, they left, unnoticed, with a light still flickering in the shed."|['1.

Tom, a young inventor, was determined to break speed records with his monoplane, the Humming-Bird. Despite his nerves, he made adjustments to increase the motor's power, aiming for a hundred miles per hour. Excited about the upcoming Eagle Park meet, where top aviators would compete, Tom worked tirelessly to perfect his aircraft. One night, he was startled awake by the alarm, mistaking it for his plane's engine. Ready for action, he rushed to investigate, even waking up Mr. Jackson for assistance.

Tom spoke confidently, convincing Mr. Swift to believe him. As the engineer rushed out in response to Tom's call, Tom planned a strategy to catch the intruder. He instructed Mr. Jackson to fetch Eradicate with a club, as the intruder couldn't be trusted with a gun. Tom and Mr. Jackson positioned themselves strategically to corner the intruder. Observing the man examining his Humming-Bird aircraft with a bright electric lamp, Tom wondered about the intruder's intentions. He waited for Eradicate and Mr. Jackson, ready to scare the intruder with a warning shot. Soon, Eradicate and Mr. Jackson arrived, and they prepared to confront the mysterious figure lurking around Tom's invention.|"['1.

Tom and the engineer cautiously approached the large double doors, waiting for Eradicate to join them. Tom was tense, expecting to hear the destructive blows on his invention. With a shiver of anticipation, he braced for impact, but the strikes never came. Pushing the door open, Tom and Mr. Jackson entered to find the man menacing the Humming-Bird. As the intruder raised the hatchet, Tom stood his ground, wishing for a club instead of his revolver. In a swift move, the man lunged at Tom, knocking him down. Darkness enveloped the shed as the intruder fled. Mr. Jackson quickly illuminated the space, revealing Tom injured on the floor.

Miss Nestor hesitated at first but eventually found herself seated in the small aircraft, ready for a flight. The young pilot assured her that they would only fly five feet above the ground unless she requested otherwise. With a nod to his companions, the pilot initiated the takeoff, and the aircraft smoothly accelerated across the ground. As they ascended slightly, the pilot demonstrated gentle maneuvers to the passenger, showcasing the basics of flying without taking unnecessary risks. Despite the limited altitude, the experience left Miss Nestor with rosy cheeks and a newfound appreciation for aviation.

Tom eagerly asked if he had reached ninety miles an hour, hoping to hit a hundred during the race. Mr. Swift revealed that they had actually hit a hundred and fifteen, splitting the difference with Mr. Jackson's one hundred and eleven. Tom was pleased with his sky racer's performance and planned to make improvements.

A few days later, with just a week left until the competition, something unusual occurred. Tom had tested his Humming-Bird aircraft and was preparing to dismantle it for shipping to Eagle Park. He decided not to fly it there due to safety concerns. As he planned to disassemble it the next morning, he left his windows open in his warm room. Struggling to sleep, he hoped for a breeze. Hearing a noise that seemed like wind, he peered outside and noticed a low-flying plane with two figures aboard. Although night flights were becoming more common, the sight surprised Tom. He pondered the unique design of the aircraft with Mr. Jackson, and they marveled at its resemblance to various innovative planes. Mr. Swift joined them on the roof, but the plane had ascended higher, leaving them with a sense of unease as if they were being observed. Tom anxiously checked on his Humming-Bird in the shed, finding no signs of intrusion.|['1.

The strange airplane suddenly sped up, circling faster and shooting upward dramatically. It then dove straight toward the building housing Tom's latest invention. Tom watched through his glasses, curious about its design. Just as he started to doze off, a commotion outside jolted him awake. Eradicate and Boomerang were making a ruckus. Tom quickly realized it was a fire. Without hesitation, he rushed out, focused on saving his Humming-Bird aircraft. Despite the shed containing valuable tools, Tom's priority was the plane's safety.

Tom's voice was too quiet to be heard far, so he gestured with his hands. His assistant pushed the Humming-Bird forward swiftly. Tom eagerly scanned the other aircraft in the race, like Andy Foger's Slugger. As he climbed steeply to catch the upper air currents, he noticed the tiny Demoiselle bouncing along the ground. Suddenly, the Demoiselle crashed, but its pilots seemed unharmed. Tom checked on Mr. Damon, who was focused on the lubrication system, crucial for the race. Other competitors like De Tromp in the Farman and Loi Tong in the Santos-Dumont were gaining speed. The race became intense as they circled the course, keeping an eye out for signals.
