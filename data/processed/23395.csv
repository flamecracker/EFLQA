"In middle school language studies, it is crucial to comprehend the multiple uses of words. To achieve this, students should explore the ordinary and literal meanings of words. They can practice by creating sentences that illustrate each word and maintain a notebook for reference. Teachers should encourage reviews to solidify the understanding of roots and prefixes. A useful method is to have students analyze words on the blackboard without their books, following the provided examples. The State Course of Study for seventh and eighth years includes 45 prefixes, 64 roots, and 33 suffixes, totaling 142 word components. For instance, ""hostile"" combines ""host"" and ""ile,"" meaning belonging to an enemy. ""Portable,"" derived from ""port"" and ""able,"" describes something capable of being carried. ""Benefactor,"" from ""bene,"" ""fact,"" and ""or,"" refers to someone who does good deeds, especially through charitable donations."|"['1.

"Words like ""advertise,"" ""criticise,"" and ""fertilize"" are formed by adding the suffix ""-ize"" to the root word, creating new verbs. For example, ""agonize"" means to cause agony. Similarly, ""Tantalize"" originates from the Greek myth of Tantalus, signifying teasing or torment. Other examples include ""humanize,"" ""organize,"" and ""realize,"" all formed by adding ""-ize"" to a root word. In this way, suffixes can alter the meaning of words, like in ""florist"" (flower) or ""scientist"" (knowledge)."|"['1.

"In English, various words are made up of root words combined with prefixes or suffixes. For example, in the field of measurement, we have words like ""anemometer"" for wind, ""barometer"" for weight, ""chronometer"" for time, ""diameter"" for across, and ""gasometer"" for gas. These words help us understand different concepts related to these areas. Similarly, in mathematics, terms like ""geometer"" for earth, ""hexameter"" for six, ""pentameter"" for five, and ""perimeter"" for around are used. Understanding the roots of words can help us grasp their meanings better. Additionally, certain marks called diacritical marks are used to indicate different sounds in the English language, making it easier to pronounce and understand words."|['1.

"Diphthongs are combinations of two vowel sounds in one syllable. Common diphthongs include ""oi"" in ""oil,"" ""oy"" in ""toy,"" ""ou"" in ""sound,"" and ""ow"" in ""cow."" These are proper diphthongs. Consonants can be semivowels with a continuous sound. Subvocals are voice consonants, while aspirates are breath consonants. Labials are formed with the lips, lingua-dentals with the tongue against the teeth, and palatals between the tongue and the palate. Syllables in a word have accents. The ultimate syllable is the last, the penultimate is the second to last, the antepenultimate is the third from the last, and the preantepenultimate is the fourth from the last. Words can be monosyllables (one syllable), disyllables (two syllables), trisyllables (three syllables), or polysyllables (three or more syllables). Some words retain silent ""e"" to preserve pronunciation, like ""serviceable"" or ""changeable."" The silent ""u"" in words like ""honour"" and ""favour"" is a remnant from French influence."|"['**Question 1:** What are diphthongs in the English language?\n\n- A) Consonants with continuous sound\n- B) Voice consonants\n- C) Combinations of two vowel sounds in one syllable\n- D) Breath consonants\n- E) Syllables with accents', '**Question 2:** Which of the following is NOT a common diphthong?\n\n- A) ""oi"" in ""oil""\n- B) ""oy"" in ""toy""\n- C) ""ow"" in ""cow""\n- D) ""ou"" in ""sound""\n- E) ""ea"" in ""break""', '**Question 3:** What are semivowels in the English language?\n\n- A) Consonants with continuous sound\n- B) Voice consonants\n- C) Combinations of two vowel sounds in one syllable\n- D) Breath consonants\n- E) Syllables with accents', '**Question 4:** Which type of consonants are voice consonants?\n\n- A) Semivocals\n- B) Aspirates\n- C) Labials\n- D) Subvocals\n- E) Palatals', '**Question 5:** How are labials formed in the English language?\n\n- A) With the lips\n- B) Against the teeth\n- C) Between the tongue and the palate\n- D) In the throat\n- E) At the tip of the tongue', '**Question 6:** Which of the following words retains a silent ""e"" to preserve pronunciation?\n\n- A) ""breakable""\n- B) ""honour""\n- C) ""changeable""\n- D) ""favour""\n- E) ""serviceable""']"|"['** C) Combinations of two vowel sounds in one syllable', '** E) ""ea"" in ""break""', '** A) Consonants with continuous sound', '** D) Subvocals', '** A) With the lips', '** E) ""serviceable""']"
"Spelling rules can be challenging due to various exceptions, but some rules are valuable for spelling difficult words. One such rule involves dropping a silent final ""e"" when adding a suffix that starts with a vowel. Conversely, when adding a suffix starting with a consonant, the silent final ""e"" is retained. For example, ""love"" becomes ""lovable"" when adding a vowel-starting suffix. Exceptions to this rule must be practiced to ensure mastery. Another rule focuses on doubling the final consonant for monosyllabic or last-syllable-accented words ending in a single consonant after a single vowel when adding a suffix that starts with a vowel. This rule helps spell words like ""refer"" turning into ""referred"". By practicing spelling words following these rules and their exceptions, students can improve their spelling skills effectively."|"['1.
