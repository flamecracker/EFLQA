In writing this book, I aimed to create a precise reflection of the memories etched in my mind. I have diligently steered clear of exaggeration in crucial aspects. The main events and many minor incidents are factual. Yet, in less significant details, I have taken some liberties akin to a novelist—not to embellish excessively or fabricate implausibilities, but—to adjust time, location, and circumstance at will. My goal was to impart to the reader a truthful essence of the overall impact—the life and terrain of the Fur-Trader, so to speak. Snowflakes and sunrays, cold and heat, winter and summer rotated routinely for fifteen years in the untamed lands of the Far North. Over this period, our protagonist transitioned from infancy to boyhood, encountering the usual array of mishaps, illnesses, and fluctuations typical of those life stages, eventually entering the transitional phase preceding early manhood.|"[""1.

Around the same time, the annual council at Red River in spring decided to send Mr. Kennedy to a remote part of the country, close to the North Pole. Mr. Kennedy was not pleased with this decision and expressed his frustration by vowing to defy the council's orders. Despite his initial outburst, he eventually wrote a respectful letter to the council, resigning from his position due to health reasons. He then moved his family to Red River Settlement, where he bought a house and enrolled his children in a reputable academy. As his children grew older, Mr. Kennedy decided to change their roles. Kate became the housekeeper, and Charley was to work for the Hudson's Bay Company. Although Charley protested, saying he would rather be a buffalo, he eventually accepted his new path.|"[""Question 1: Why did Mr. Kennedy initially express frustration with the council's decision?\nA) He did not want to move to a remote part of the country\nB) He wanted to be closer to the North Pole\nC) He disagreed with the council's annual decisions\nD) He preferred to stay at Red River Settlement\nE) He wanted to defy the council's orders"", ""Question 2: How did Mr. Kennedy eventually respond to the council's decision?\nA) He defied the council's orders\nB) He moved his family to Red River Settlement\nC) He wrote a respectful letter resigning from his position\nD) He enrolled his children in a reputable academy\nE) He vowed to change his children's roles"", ""Question 3: What was the reason for Mr. Kennedy's resignation from his position?\nA) His disagreement with the council's decisions\nB) His frustration with his new role\nC) His desire to move closer to the North Pole\nD) His health reasons\nE) His children's enrollment in a reputable academy"", ""Question 4: Where did Mr. Kennedy move his family after resigning from his position?\nA) To a remote part of the country\nB) To Red River Settlement\nC) To a house close to the North Pole\nD) To a reputable academy\nE) To work for the Hudson's Bay Company"", ""Question 5: What role did Mr. Kennedy assign to his son Charley?\nA) Housekeeper\nB) Hunter\nC) Buffalo\nD) Hudson's Bay Company worker\nE) Council member"", ""Question 6: How did Charley initially react to his new role assigned by Mr. Kennedy?\nA) He accepted it right away\nB) He preferred to be a housekeeper\nC) He wanted to be a buffalo instead\nD) He defied his father's decision\nE) He moved to a remote part of the country""]"|"['A) He did not want to move to a remote part of the country', 'C) He wrote a respectful letter resigning from his position', 'D) His health reasons', 'B) To Red River Settlement', ""D) Hudson's Bay Company worker"", 'C) He wanted to be a buffalo instead']"
Charley and Kate were close siblings who shared their joys and sorrows. As they grew older, their bond deepened, finding comfort in each other's company. They understood the power of sympathy, finding solace in sharing their feelings. When faced with Mr. Kennedy's decisions, they sought a quiet place to talk. Their conversations brought calmness and happiness. Charley's sadness was lessened by Kate's joy, and Kate found solace in Charley's sorrow. After their heartfelt talks, they felt more at ease. A week later, Charley and Kate sat near the Red River, where Charley revealed his plan to run away. This decision marked a new beginning for them. Near the Red River colony, Fort Garry stood as a trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company. The fort, with its imposing walls and guns, was a symbol of power and trade in the peaceful colony. The fort overlooked the Assiniboine River, surrounded by wooded land and vast prairies covered in snow. At noon the next day, an elderly man observed a familiar figure approaching the fort, driving recklessly. The driver's sudden crash led to a comical mishap, but he quickly recovered, showcasing his spirited nature.|['1.

""Why don't you warn travelers about the new fences and road changes?"" Mr. Grant responded with a smile, explaining that the road and fences were signs enough. Mr. Kennedy then instructed his son, Charley, to take the mare to the stable carefully, but Charley dashed off at a fast pace. Mr. Kennedy, seeing Charley take the wrong turn, expressed his frustration. Mr. Grant suggested they go to his room for a smoke.

In a counting-room at Fort Garry, the small wooden space housed two large desks, tall stools, ink-bottles, rulers, and books. The room was lit by two windows, with blue walls painted up to three feet, then a stripe of red and pale yellow above. The ceiling, originally ochre, was now stained from tobacco and candle smoke. Three doors led to rooms where clerks slept. The room had no carpets, only scarlet sashes and winter clothing on the walls. An open fireplace without a grate provided warmth with crackling wood fires. The three clerks were distinct: a diligent book-keeper, a flute-playing mechanic, and a spirited young boy named Harry Somerville. Harry's constant fidgeting with the fire tested the patience of the senior clerk, Charley.|['1.

Harry jumped off his stool with such suddenness and energy that it seemed like he had been attached to it with a powerful spring, which was released with a sharp bounce, propelling him out the door, disappearing instantly. He returned shortly with groom Tom Whyte, a cockney and ex-soldier, who stood so upright that it was a wonder how words climbed up his throat and out his mouth. Tom spoke slowly and deliberately. The conversation revealed that a pony had an injury, and Charley might need to ride Harry's gray pony instead. Tom described a new, wild colt, and Peter suggested borrowing a pony from John Fowler. Tom, known for his slow pace, walked off to the men's quarters. The room they were in was a typical Hudson's Bay Company dwelling, with wooden construction and a brown patina from dust and smoke. The room housed wooden berths, tables, benches, and a large iron stove for cooking and warmth. The walls were adorned with various tools and equipment. The passage also described the extreme cold in the northern regions of America, detailing the effects of frostbite and the necessity of proper winter attire like moccasins.|"[""1.

During the winter in Red River, the land is covered in snow, making it look like a vast white sea for five to six months. Hungry prairie wolves roam around the area, safe from humans due to their light weight allowing them to run on the snow's surface. However, in spring, as the snow melts, the wolves struggle to move while horses can easily chase them. Charley Kennedy was eager to join a wolf hunt. The morning was perfect, with the sun shining brightly, and the snow sparkling like diamonds. The temperature was rising, and signs of spring were in the air. At Fort Garry, the courtyard was lively as Tom Whyte tried to control the horses. Charley and Harry arrived, amused by Tom's serious demeanor. They decided to wait for someone together, laughing at Tom's comical expressions.|"['1.

Tom's speech was abruptly halted by a natural event unique to arctic regions. In winter, snow accumulates on rooftops, forming thick layers that can suddenly slide off due to spring thaw, posing a danger. A heavy mass of snow fell on Mr. Kennedy's mare, startling her. The mare kicked and reared, causing chaos. Tom, known for his rigidity, fell awkwardly due to the impact. Laughter ensued as the boys tried to control the horses. Mr. Grant, armed for a wolf-hunt, discussed sending Charley away to toughen him up. Despite initial resistance, Mr. Kennedy softened, opting for a gentle approach with Charley. The power of kindness in communication was highlighted, showing its ability to influence even the sternest hearts.|"[""1.

Harry didn't know what to do and admitted it sympathetically. He suggested Charley take his pony, but Charley refused. They decided to wait for the expected horse and took a walk by the fort. Passing a stable, Charley wanted to see the new horse, described as spirited. Against warnings, Charley saddled and rode the horse. Charley was confident in his ability to handle the spirited horse, even if it ran off. They rode off towards the horizon, following tracks in the snow. The spirited horse tried to bolt but was stopped by a snowdrift, showing Charley's skill in handling him.|"['1.

Charley, full of determination, whipped his horse vigorously, causing it to bolt forward like a cannonball. The snow-covered landscape blurred past as the horse raced with incredible speed, leaving Charley exhilarated and his cap abandoned in the snow. The scene was a vast expanse of white, broken only by scattered willows. The hunters, caught up in the excitement of the chase, rode with their hearts pounding. Suddenly, Mr. Grant's sharp cry halted the group as they spotted a distant figure that turned out to be a wolf. The pursuit began, with the wolf initially outpacing the horses in the shallow snow. However, as the chase led into deeper drifts, the horses gained ground, and the wolf struggled through the snow. After a thrilling pursuit, the hunters paused to catch their breath, with Mr. Kennedy comparing the wolf to a mythical creature in jest.|"[""1.

Charley had been on a long ride when we last saw him. After navigating a wide curve with his horse deftly avoiding snow-covered ground, he sped towards the fort once more. Despite Charley's attempts to slow down, he decided to enjoy the ride as the horse raced on. The young horse seemed almost like lightning, dashing forward tirelessly for miles. Charley, a skilled rider, was unfazed by the speed. As he approached his companions, a wolf suddenly appeared. Charley readied his borrowed pistol, but the wolf veered off course, allowing another man to shoot it. The gunshot startled Charley's horse, causing him to swerve and nearly throw Charley off. The horse also accidentally discharged bullets towards another horse, causing chaos. Charley, caught up in the excitement, continued racing towards the fort uncontrollably. As he neared the stable at Fort Garry, he wondered whether to risk jumping the fence or crash into a snowdrift. Ultimately, he decided to leap the fence, but the horse landed in a snowdrift, abruptly ending their wild journey. Charley was thrown off the horse and landed headfirst in the snow, with only his legs visible. Mr. Kennedy rushed to help his son, while Tom Whyte caught the new horse as it emerged from the snow.|"[""1.

Shortly after the disaster just described, Charley regained consciousness and emerged from a long fainting spell due to his robust constitution and the care of his companions. Medical aid in the untamed wilderness of North America is quite unique and somewhat vague in its approach due to the absence of doctors. Men are left to rely on themselves, making everyone a makeshift doctor. While there are a few real doctors employed by the Hudson's Bay Company, their locations are often far from the remote outposts where emergencies arise. In such situations, individuals resort to amateur medical practices, often resorting to extreme measures like tooth extractions and bleeding as common remedies. Charley, lacking access to a genuine doctor in Red River, received amateur treatment from his friends. Peter Mactavish, attempting to help by administering what he thought was laudanum, mistakenly gave Charley tincture of rhubarb instead. This led to chaos and frantic attempts at solutions, highlighting the challenges of medical care in the wilderness.|"['1.

Mr. Kennedy declared with immense relief, and Peter Mactavish sighed deeply. Charley, woken by the commotion, went back to sleep as his friends left. Tom Whyte couldn't find the doctor, who was out tending to emergencies. Tom then drove to Mr. Kennedy's house, alarming Mrs. Kennedy and Kate with an exaggerated account. Kate and Tom rushed to Charley's side. Charley, waking up, wanted to talk. He asked Kate about his fall from the horse and how he ended up there. Mrs. Grant was a large, slow woman who liked teasing her friends in a good-natured way. She once had a mishap with her baby in a tub chair, causing a brief quarrel with her husband.|"[""1.

She recounted the happy memories they shared together, emphasizing the fear and sorrow she felt at the thought of losing him. Charley, touched by her words, acknowledged his thankfulness for having such a caring sister. Despite his initial reluctance about his father's plans for him, Kate reminded him of the importance of honoring their parents as stated in the Bible.

In April, at Red River, the arctic winter had given way to a vibrant spring. The snow melted, the ice broke, and the land burst into life. The river flowed freely, boats glided, and canoes crossed the waters. Birds filled the air with their calls, and frogs sang in the marshes. The settlers worked the fields, and the earth awakened from its slumber. The voyageurs, descendants of French-Canadian and Indian heritage, lounged at Fort Garry, dressed in traditional attire. The younger men exuded recklessness, while the seasoned ones exuded strength and experience. Their diverse costumes reflected their individual circumstances. These voyageurs were a blend of spirit and muscle, shaped by their adventures in navigating treacherous waters and hunting bison across the vast prairies.|['1.

Boat travel in these regions is quite remarkable compared to what many are used to in more developed areas. With numerous large lakes and rivers crisscrossing the land, these waterways serve as the main routes for transporting supplies and furs. Navigating American rivers can be treacherous due to rapids and falls, necessitating the carrying of cargo overland to bypass these obstacles. Sometimes, boats must be lightened to navigate turbulent waters safely. Skilled steersmen guide the boats through these perilous passages, with the bowman assisting in avoiding rocks. In addition to the challenges of the water, there are seasoned guides and steersmen who are revered for their wisdom and experience in the wilderness. The trading store, a hub of activity where goods are exchanged for furs, plays a crucial role in the lives of indigenous peoples and voyageurs. At Fort Garry, Peter Mactavish oversees the bustling store, where young voyageurs eagerly prepare for their journeys, like Antoine who carefully selects items, including a green blanket and a blue cloth capote, before embarking on his travels.|['1.

Harry was confused as he couldn't recall what he had left behind. He joked about selling odd items like 30 guns or copper kettles. Mactavish pointed out Harry's mistake in the accounts, causing Harry embarrassment. A man named Hugh from Orkney was lazy and rough. When Hugh tripped over Baptiste's bundle and was laughed at, he tried to start a fight. Baptiste, not one for many words, promptly punched Hugh, and a scuffle ensued. Mactavish stopped the fight and threw Hugh out of the fort. Fighting styles differ among nations, with the English having strict rules, the Scots being less formal, and the half-breeds fighting without rules. Baptiste tackled Hugh in a chaotic manner, showing that sometimes, it's best to get things done quickly and effectively.|"['1.

For a brief moment, they grappled and writhed like snakes, then sprang to their feet, engaging in a frenzied war-dance, swinging their fists in what seemed to be a practiced manner. Hugh Mathison, averse to leaping due to his size and sluggishness, opted for a defensive stance. His nimble opponent, driven by a lively spirit and physical agility, moved in a manner akin to a wild cat or a zigzag firework. Baptiste, dancing backward with agility, suddenly unleashed a flurry of attacks, leaving Mathison bewildered. After a series of chaotic movements, Baptiste landed a blow, prompting Mathison to brace for the next assault. When Baptiste lunged forward, Mathison countered, sending him reeling. Undeterred, Baptiste sprang up, intensifying the fight. Amidst the scuffle, an unexpected stumble led to a temporary halt, allowing Baptiste to seize the opportunity and overpower Mathison. Meanwhile, Mr. Kennedy, a former fur-trader, intervened in a fit of rage, scolding the combatants.

On the next day at noon, the area where the recent fight occurred turned into a lively scene. Voyageurs in their finest, newest, and most colorful outfits filled Fort Garry and the space leading to the river. Six large boats bound for the north were docked, loaded with fur bales, ready for a long journey. Young men, new to the road, eagerly watched the experienced guides inspect and prepare the boats. Old men, who had spent their lives in similar work, observed in silence, reminiscing about their youthful days. Tender moments unfolded as couples separated for a while exchanged heartfelt goodbyes. Among them, Charley and his sister Kate took a final walk together, expressing their sorrow at parting. Despite Charley's reassurances, Kate's tears flowed uncontrollably, and Charley couldn't help but shed tears alongside her. Their clergyman, Mr. Addison, appeared, offering his blessings and bidding Charley a heartfelt farewell.|['1.

During a long and thrilling afternoon, Charley was captivated by the sights and sounds around him. His heart swelled as he sang along with the choruses, his voice soaring wildly regardless of tune or time. The spirit of adventure filled him as he experienced the life of a rover for the first time, surrounded by the enchanting woods. As the sun dipped below the horizon, the boats headed towards land. Louis Peltier chose a spot covered with trees and bushes for their night's camp. Pierre swiftly set up a roaring fire using his flint and steel, creating a lively scene as other voyageurs did the same. Soon, the camps were bustling with activity, kettles boiling, men chatting and smoking. Charley observed it all from his tent, grateful for the warmth and cheer of the fire on a peaceful evening in the wilderness.|"['1.

Charley drank tea while resting on his blanket, feeling tired from the day's activities. Mr. Park, also quiet by nature, joined him silently. They watched the men eat their supper, which included robbiboo, a thick soup made of flour, pemmican, and water. Although not gourmet food, robbiboo was nutritious and satisfying. Pemmican, a key ingredient, was made from buffalo meat. The process involved hunting a buffalo, skinning it, drying the meat, pounding it, and storing it in buffalo hide bags with melted fat to create pemmican. This compact and long-lasting food was essential for voyageurs on their journeys. The men ate directly from the pot with wooden spoons, showcasing their hearty appetites. As the meal progressed, conversations flowed in a mix of English, French, and Indian languages, filled with tales of past adventures and future plans. Amidst the chatter, a sound caught their attention, leading to speculation and a suggestion to investigate the source at the beach.|['1.

"Charley abruptly responded, ""More than enough,"" as a gust of wind swirled the flames around him, singeing his eyelashes. He expressed concern that he might lose all his hair on this journey. Harry, in a state of immense delight, revealed that he was joining Charley on the adventure. The boys' excitement led to a playful wrestle near the fire, causing chaos.

Charley carefully considered his options. On one side, there was a deep hollow that he thought could even challenge a buffalo's strength. On the other side, a cluster of stumps looked menacing, ready to poke anyone who dared to rest there. Despite the obstacles, Charley swiftly wielded his axe, clearing the stumps and filling the hollow with collected moss and twigs. Next, he ventured into the woods and returned carrying a spruce fir tree. After stripping it of branches, he laid the flat, elastic branches under the canoe, creating a comfortable bed. Charley then fetched blankets, pillows, and other essentials to make a cozy sleeping area. Meanwhile, his friend Harry, exhausted from the day's adventures, prepared for bed. Before sleeping, Harry, influenced by his Christian upbringing, paused to pray, holding onto the values instilled in him by his loving family back home.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did Charley use to fill the deep hollow?\nA) Rocks\nB) Moss and twigs\nC) Sand\nD) Leaves\nE) Water', 'Question 2:\nWhat did Charley use to create a comfortable bed under the canoe?\nA) Rocks\nB) Pine needles\nC) Elastic branches of a spruce fir tree\nD) Sticks\nE) Mud', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Charley fetch to make a cozy sleeping area?\nA) Rocks\nB) Pillows and blankets\nC) Sticks\nD) Leaves\nE) Sand', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Harry do before going to bed?\nA) Cook a meal\nB) Go for a swim\nC) Pray\nD) Read a book\nE) Sing a song', ""Question 5:\nWhat influenced Harry to pause and pray before sleeping?\nA) The sound of the wind\nB) The darkness of the night\nC) His Christian upbringing\nD) Charley's actions\nE) The cozy sleeping area"", 'Question 6:\nWhat values did Harry hold onto while praying?\nA) Values from his adventures\nB) Values from his education\nC) Values from his work\nD) Values from his family\nE) Values from his dreams']"|['B) Moss and twigs', 'C) Elastic branches of a spruce fir tree', 'B) Pillows and blankets', 'C) Pray', 'C) His Christian upbringing', 'D) Values from his family']
On a serene evening by Lake Winnipeg, Charley felt a mix of emotions as he gazed at the moonlit sea. His thoughts drifted to loved ones left behind, pondering past actions. The vast lakes resemble oceans, with waves that can be as fierce as the sea. Amidst the camp's quietness, Charley's mind wandered as he lay under the stars. The camp stirred as Louis Peltier's morning call broke the dawn. The voyageurs responded in various ways, some sprightly, others sluggish, reflecting the transition from dreams to reality. The camp came alive with murmurs and yawns, a blend of night's remnants and the new day's beginning.

French and Irish yawns are quite similar, with a slight distinction in how they end. The Frenchman concludes his yawn calmly and gets up, while the Irishman finishes with a vigorous gasp, almost defiantly, as if challenging fate. The subdued camp sounds turned into a bustling buzz as the men readied themselves for the day. Mr. Park emerged from his tent, observing the camp's activity and the weather. He noticed the boys still in their lairs, puzzled by the remnants of the campfire. After a gentle reprimand, the boys quickly prepared to embark, realizing they had forgotten to pack blankets. Amid laughter and confusion, they rectified their mistakes and joined the crew in the boats.

The men's rough voices softened as the two Indians listened to their friends' departing song. The distant boats and their fading music vanished in the bright eastern light. The Indians stood still, heads bowed, savoring the last echoes. The Company's men usually sat at the stern of the boats, where cargo formed a makeshift bed. Charley and Harry sat on this uncomfortable couch, eager for breakfast after hours of travel. Suddenly, a gull flew by, startling Charley, who missed his shot, much to the amusement of the others. Banter ensued, with Baptiste teased for his fancy hat. Mike, collecting the feathers, joked about the hat being more suitable for a feather-bed.|"[""1.

Baptiste was getting angry, but everyone turned their attention to Charley and his friend, who had reached the rock and were eagerly waiting. Shooting small game might seem odd, but the boys were new to shooting. Harry had only borrowed a gun a few times, while Charley had never shot before. They were thrilled when a flock of gulls flew above them. They fired many shots but missed due to their excitement. Charley even loaded his gun incorrectly. Despite their efforts, they couldn't hit any gulls until Charley accidentally shot one while falling over. The guide then called for breakfast as they reached a rocky bay.

Travelers, like poets, have felt the invigorating effect of the new day, even if they couldn't express it in grand words. The bright eyes, smiles, light steps, and laughter of the travelers spoke volumes about their joy. Poets and artists would have found inspiration by the secluded lake, watching groups by the fires, enjoying breakfast, fixing boats, or relaxing on the grass. The morning meal was quickly prepared, and two friends ventured into the forest for a hunt. They encountered bold whisky-john birds, impudent and puffy, stealing food fearlessly. The friends played a trick on one bird, capturing it briefly. Later, the travelers faced an impending thunderstorm on the lake, rowing with urgency to reach safety. The storm unleashed its power, with thunder and lightning, making the travelers reflect on the awe-inspiring forces of nature.|"['1.

The guide, with a worried look, monitored the rising waves and the approaching storm. Thunder echoed and rain poured down as the crew tried to row against the wind. As the gale intensified, the oars were useless. The men sought shelter under a tarpaulin while Mr. Park and the boys huddled under an oilcloth. Mike Brady prepared to release the sheet as the storm approached. An Indian swiftly cut the sail loose just in time, preventing the boat from being swamped. Everyone bailed water frantically. Eventually, the crew managed to bail out most of the water and reset the sail. The boat, now lighter, picked up speed and safely reached the shore. The crew found refuge with other boats in a sheltered bay, waiting out the storm for the next few days.|['1.

"While they were occupied, Redfeather, the Native American who had severed the ropes during the storm, strolled down to the shore and settled on a rock nearby, appearing lost in thought. ""Do I ponder about home? It's all I think of when not conversing with you, Harry. My dear mother and my aged father are ever in my mind. Home? Yes, and sweet Kate, too, lingers by my side day and night, tears in her eyes, her curls cascading over my shoulder, just as I saw her the day we parted, beckoning me back, or reproaching me for leaving—God bless her! Yes, thoughts of home often consume me, Harry.""Harry stayed silent. His friend's words shifted his mind to a distant scene—another Kate, another father and mother, residing in a glen across the vast Atlantic waters. He reminisced about them as they used to be, a cherished circle where his absence would leave a void. He recalled the gentle voice reading the Bible and his mother's tender goodnight kiss. He remembered the somber day he departed, sailing away to a foreign land amidst strangers. Now, he envisioned them—without him—accustomed to his absence, perhaps occasionally forgetting he was once there.

One or two young people playing by the river were allowed to join the group, including Misconna and me. As we passed a gathering of women seeing us off, I noticed the girl who had sparked jealousy between us. She dropped a white feather near us, which I picked up and placed in my hair. As we hurried through the forest, we overheard some old women laughing and making comments about me. Eventually, we reached a prairie area with scattered trees and began walking in single file, following the scout. Our tribe's chief led the group, with Misconna and me at the back. The scout and the chief had a discussion, gesturing towards the moon and the horizon. After some disagreement, they reached a decision, and we continued our journey along the edge of the woods. We paused for a brief rest by a fountain, then resumed our march under the moonlight. The scout became more cautious as dawn approached, and we halted near a ridge where our enemies were camped. The chief led us to the top of the ridge, where we saw the enemy's campfires across the river. Despite the late hour, the fires surprised us, suggesting they were unaware of our presence. Our chief prepared the group for what lay ahead, as we peered into the dark valley below, ready for the impending confrontation.|"['1.

Our leader prepared for the attack. We were told to split up and get as close to the camp as we could without being seen. Then, we were to wait for a signal - the sound of an owl hooting. We all went our separate ways. I followed the stream, its gentle murmur echoing in the quiet night. The thought of the impending violence weighed heavily on me. But the words of an old woman and a white feather in my hair spurred me on. As I approached the camp, I climbed a hillock to scout the area. From my vantage point, I could see the camp, unaware of any danger. I noticed the trapper among the sleeping figures, his rifle close at hand. Just as I settled in to wait for the signal, a figure emerged from the bushes. It was a woman, the trapper's wife. She seemed anxious, questioning if I came alone and whether I was friend or foe. Realizing the need to delay her, I spoke of unknown Indians and potential threats. She hesitated, torn between trust and suspicion, but ultimately chose not to raise the alarm.|"['1.

"As I gazed into the girl's eyes, a sudden idea struck me. ""Hurry,"" I urged, ""tell your husband to leave camp immediately and meet me here. Make sure the Chipewyans don't see you go. Quick! His life and yours may rely on your speed."" The girl understood at once. She dashed up the bank, but a gunshot rang out, followed by war cries as the Knisteneux attacked the camp. I ran after her, grabbing her arm. ""Stop, it's too late. Your husband is quick, he may save himself. Hide here, you might escape."" A chilling cry pierced the air behind me. I turned to see the trapper's wife on the ground, Misconna poised to strike. ""Does the fighter want another wife?"" he taunted, raising his spear. I intervened, striking him down. Another band member appeared, plunging a spear into the woman. I tried to stop him, but it was too late. A gunshot rang out, felling the attacker.

During the battle, the Chipewyan warriors were defeated by the Knisteneux. Most of the Chipewyans were killed, and their scalps were taken as trophies. Only a few escaped, including a trapper and four others. The trapper, covered in blood, returned to bury his wife, who had been murdered. Overwhelmed with grief, he knelt beside her lifeless body, embracing her for the last time. He then buried her under a willow tree and left. As he departed, he paused to look back at the scene, raised his arms to the sky, and disappeared into the prairie.

Redfeather proudly shared that he was considered a poor warrior in his tribe for not bringing home any scalps. Due to his interactions with traders, he adopted a respectful attitude towards women, unlike many of his fellow tribe members. Redfeather's affectionate nature and exposure to the traders' ways made him cherish his wife deeply. The Indian, Misconna, informed Redfeather that he had not seen his tribe in a long time due to following his white friends. The story then transitions to skip over the events along Lake Winnipeg's shore, avoiding becoming tedious.

"""Careful, Jacques!"" he shouted, feeling the canoe shake in the fast-moving water. ""Let me secure my pole behind this rock. Now, push us forward. Oh no!"" he groaned as the pole slipped and the canoe spun around. ""Watch out for the rock!"" called Jacques, thrusting the pole to steer the canoe into a calm spot behind a large rock. Kneeling in the canoe, they assessed the rapid stream. ""Should we try once more? Maybe we can dash to the tail of the eddy and then the current above seems less fierce. What do you think, Jacques?"" Jacques, a man of action, encouraged the daring plan. Despite knowing it was tough, he agreed with a determined ""Ho"" and guided the canoe back into the stream.

The two travelers decided to carry their canoe and belongings overland to avoid the rapids and waterfalls. The hunter lifted the canoe onto his shoulders and ventured into the woods. This feat wasn't due to his strength alone; Charley could have done it too. The hunter navigated through the challenging terrain, climbing steep banks and forcing the canoe through thick branches. Once on level ground, he moved swiftly, occasionally avoiding obstacles. Charley followed with more cargo. They reached a peaceful stretch of water above the rapids. Charley noticed geese feeding across the river. He cleverly used a tree branch to conceal himself and shot one goose.

In winter, Charley delivered provisions to needy men who were struggling with old, barely edible food. With the supplies gone, they journeyed back to the fort, hoping to find food on the way. Despite traveling with an Indian companion, they found nothing to eat. As their hunger grew, Charley and his comrade resorted to eating deerskin moccasins to survive. The next day, they even consumed a tough and dirty leather breech to stave off starvation. Later, while navigating a narrow river blocked by fallen trees, they persevered by cutting through the obstacles. Despite the challenges, they found a picturesque campsite where they could rest and enjoy the beauty of nature, surrounded by hills, forests, and wildlife.

Jacques quickly skinned the deer and cut steaks from its flank. He impaled the steaks and the plucked goose on wooden spikes to roast over the campfire. As night fell, the fire's glow illuminated Jacques and Charley as they enjoyed their supper. The stars disappeared, and the owls and wolves retreated. The morning star shone brightly in the sky. Jacques accidentally hit Charley's nose, causing a comical awakening. They laughed, yawned, and then resumed their journey by canoe. The fur-traders had decided to expand operations, leading to Mr. Whyte and his team setting up an outpost named Stoney Creek. Charley and Jacques embarked on a journey to inform the nearby Knisteneux tribe of the traders' arrival. The tribe warmly received them, showcasing their unique clothing and customs.|"['1.

During the chief's speech, he praised the qualities of white men and his tribe's bravery. He humorously mentioned the fat deer that seem to offer themselves for hunting. Jacques, a white man, then commended the Indian brethren for their hunting skills and offered to trade with them. Charley, hoping to find his friend Redfeather, suggested a walk to escape the curious stares of the natives.

Charley reflected on the lonely hut without Kate and agreed with Jacques that living alone would be too desolate. Jacques shared a story about a man who bled to death due to a severe injury without anyone to help him. Charley then asked Jacques about his encounter with the Sioux tribe, where Jacques cleverly pretended to be nervous to protect his fellow trappers. Jacques explained how he tried to act scared but ended up looking red-faced instead of pale, all while trying to convince the Sioux that his companions were far away. Charley pointed out the potential flaws in Jacques' approach, but Jacques believed in adapting to the customs of the people he encountered to avoid unnecessary conflicts.

The large man scrutinized my face closely to determine if I was truthful. I pretended my teeth were chattering, but he saw through it. The Sioux are known for their deceitful nature and couldn't recognize honesty. He demanded to know the direction of my people, threatening me with a knife. I feigned ignorance, but he brandished his knife, calling me a coward. To avoid danger, I gestured towards a distant part of the plains. I led them close to our camp, hoping my friends would hear. When a wolf appeared, I seized the opportunity to distract them. As we approached the camp, I tripped the man, allowing me to escape. Bullets flew as I ran, but my comrades' gunfire saved me.

Charley and Jacques were deep in discussion about truthfulness and the importance of sticking to the truth, even in difficult situations. Charley shared a story about a minister who chose to tell the truth about his beliefs, even when faced with persecution and death. Despite the consequences, the minister's unwavering truthfulness inspired his people to embrace Christianity and live more virtuous lives. The hunter, who had been pondering their conversation, likened preaching to hunting, suggesting that some are naturally inclined towards certain paths.

Charley responded that it was impossible in a tone only his friend could hear. He joked about how hard it would be for him to keep a serious face like the serious-looking man across from him. Charley found it difficult not to laugh, feeling like a high-pressure steam engine. He was distracted by a woman with a baby on her back, making it hard for him to keep a straight face. Charley's smile was sweet, but it was seen as inappropriate by his Native American friends, who valued seriousness. However, when Charley frowned at his mistake, he regained some respect.

Charley gazed hopelessly at his uneaten food, realizing no one else would touch it. Jacques suggested bribing an Indian with tobacco to finish it. The Indian, Redfeather, shared his portion with a friend, surprising Jacques. Redfeather, influenced by the missionaries, ate less than the others. A chief sang as women played tambourines outside. Redfeather, a brave warrior, felt torn between his tribe and the missionary's teachings. The missionary's words haunted him, and he decided to join the missionary to learn more about the Great Spirit. He felt the spirits communicating with him through nature, compelling him to seek answers beyond his tribe's beliefs.|"['1.

Redfeather deeply cared for his tribe. He wished they could hear the missionary's words about the happy hunting-grounds. The missionary spoke of Jesus as the guide to lead them there. Despite his love for his people, Redfeather felt restless and must go! After a silence, the old chief praised Redfeather's bravery but questioned his decision to leave. Some agreed with his choice, hoping for a taste of the miraculous with the missionary's arrival. Misconna, a rival of Redfeather, tried to dissuade him, hinting at a hidden agenda.

In the past, young gentlemen at York Fort committed practical jokes, which were often more harmful than fun. However, considering their limited sources of entertainment, it's somewhat understandable. They had few books, no newspapers, and the desolate wilderness offered little excitement. After being scolded by Mr. Rogan, the clerks at _Bachelor's Hall_ grew restless. They planned a night expedition to check their traps for foxes and wolves, followed by a search for ptarmigan. Equipped in unique attire for the harsh climate, Harry wore a fur cap, a shawl covering his face, a deer-skin coat, leggings, and moccasins. His feet were layered with socks and moccasins to combat the cold and chafing from snow-shoes. Ready for their adventure, the group prepared to venture out into the wintry night.|"['1.

"While the trio prepared themselves, grunting and groaning at stubborn clothing, the night grew darker outside, and the snow fell thicker. Stepping out into the frosty air, they were momentarily tempted to abandon their plan and return to the warmth of their dwelling. ""Keep your spirits up,"" Harry encouraged cheerfully. ""You'll feel differently after a mile's walk. A bit of moonlight would help,"" he added, stumbling off the platform into deep snow. ""It's a full moon now,"" the accountant noted. The friends followed the path towards the woodcutting area, the snow making it challenging. They then strapped on snow-shoes, enabling them to traverse the snowy wilderness effortlessly. Snow-shoes, made of a wooden frame and deer-skin netting, keep the wearer afloat on top of deep snow. As they journeyed, a moonbeam illuminated the forest, revealing poor Hamilton struggling comically in the snow. With a helping hand, they continued on their snowy adventure."|"[""1.

Harry and his companions trekked through the frosty night, guided by the radiant moonlight that bathed the snowy terrain. The stillness of the Arctic night enveloped them in a solemn atmosphere. The trio, lost in their thoughts, occasionally paused to rest, their hushed voices barely breaking the silence. Raised in homes where reverence for the Almighty was instilled, Harry and Hamilton found solace in reflecting on their faith amidst the icy wilderness. As they navigated the frozen swamp towards North River, the accountant shared insights about the brackish waters and the frozen sea beyond. Approaching the river's edge, the group marveled at the desolate expanse before them. Harry's misjudgment of distance underscored the challenges of navigating the wintry landscape by moonlight. As they neared the accountant's winter camp nestled among fir trees, a sense of urgency gripped the group, hinting at unforeseen perils ahead.|"['1.

Harry and his friends found themselves in a dense forest, seeking shelter in a hidden knoll. The accountant led them to a concealed entrance in the knoll, where a blazing fire transformed the dark night into a warm and cozy retreat. The fire illuminated the snowy surroundings, creating a snug atmosphere. The group cleared a space in the snow, revealing a moss-covered area where they set up a makeshift living space with a fire, pine branches for seating, and essential supplies. While Hamilton's frostbitten feet were tended to, the group prepared to head out to check traps, leaving him to rest by the fire. Despite the cold and isolation, the warmth of the fire and the camaraderie of the group brought comfort and a sense of home in the midst of the wilderness.|['1.

The snow on the river was hard, so they carried their snow-shoes over their shoulders and moved quickly. The icy road had sharp corners that required careful walking. Harry spotted a group of white foxes playing and watching them. The accountant called the foxes stupid and shared a story of trapping one before. They planned to build a trap using slabs of snow and logs. They constructed a box-like structure with snow and logs to trap the foxes.

My dear Charley, I have missed you greatly and cherish your last letter dearly. Although understanding the delays, the time between hearing from you feels long and dreary. Our beloved parents are well. Papa has taken up smoking more since you left and spends time in the summer-house where we read and talk. Recently, he was engrossed in mysterious work, writing advice letters to you. Mama is recovering from an illness, and papa nursed her tenderly. He was clumsy at first but improved. The cook, George, bore the brunt of papa's occasional outbursts due to mishaps. Papa's temper has mellowed, partly due to Mr. Addison's influence. Our dog Twist has grown into a majestic protector. The livestock is also in good health. Now, let me share news about the colony's activities.|"['1.

For two days, there was no news about old Mr. Seaforth. The settlers were too busy saving themselves and their families to think of others. It wasn't until the third day that people started asking about him. His son Peter searched diligently in all directions but found the house stuck on a shallow point with neither his father nor the cat inside. Eventually, an Indian who had passed the house brought him back along with the old cat. Mr. Seaforth was considered a remarkable man for surviving so much in his old age and remaining active and hearty. Sadly, Mr. Swan from the mill died of fever, and Mr. Cordon also passed away after a tragic accident. The letter Harry read from Charley shared news of marriages and events in the community, including Jane Patterson marrying Mr. Cameron and an unexpected marriage between Mr. Peters and Marie Peltier. Harry cherished the letter, finding comfort in the news from afar.|"['Question 1:\nWhat caused the delay in people asking about old Mr. Seaforth?\nA) The settlers were too busy saving themselves\nB) Peter searched diligently in all directions\nC) The Indian brought him back along with the cat\nD) Mr. Seaforth was considered a remarkable man\nE) Mr. Swan died of fever', 'Question 2:\nWho eventually brought back old Mr. Seaforth and the cat?\nA) Peter\nB) Mr. Swan\nC) Mr. Cordon\nD) An Indian\nE) Harry', 'Question 3:\nWhat was Mr. Seaforth considered for surviving so much in his old age?\nA) A remarkable man\nB) A lazy man\nC) A forgetful man\nD) A wealthy man\nE) A famous man', 'Question 4:\nWho died of fever in the community?\nA) Mr. Seaforth\nB) Mr. Swan\nC) Mr. Cordon\nD) Mr. Cameron\nE) Mr. Peters', ""Question 5:\nWhat brought comfort to Harry in the passage?\nA) News of marriages and events\nB) Mr. Swan's death\nC) Mr. Seaforth's survival\nD) Peter's search efforts\nE) Mr. Cordon's accident"", 'Question 6:\nWhat did the letter Harry read share about marriages in the community?\nA) Jane Patterson marrying Mr. Cameron\nB) Mr. Peters marrying Marie Peltier\nC) Mr. Seaforth marrying Jane Patterson\nD) Mr. Swan marrying Marie Peltier\nE) Peter marrying Mr. Cameron']"|['A) The settlers were too busy saving themselves', 'D) An Indian', 'A) A remarkable man', 'B) Mr. Swan', 'A) News of marriages and events', 'B) Mr. Peters marrying Marie Peltier']
Three months had passed at York Fort, and the snow remained deep and white, surrounding the fur-traders' dwelling. Winter's icy grip persisted, coating every surface with frost and snow. Icicles dangled from rooftops, and the frozen sea stretched endlessly. Despite the cold, the sun shone brightly, casting a dazzling light over the landscape. A group gathered by the fort's gate, preparing for a journey. Mr. Rogan bid farewell to the travelers, advising the Indian driver to care for the dogs and the young passengers. With a shout, the sled dogs raced off, pulling the sled into the snowy expanse. As Harry and Hamilton said their goodbyes, Mr. Rogan expressed his fondness for the departing friends, wishing them well on their journey.|['1.

Mr. Rogan warmly shook their hands before walking sadly to his house. Harry and Hamilton said goodbye to their friends and began their journey to Norway House. A week earlier, an Indian messenger arrived with orders for their departure. Harry excitedly prepared, while Hamilton quietly readied himself.

Harry and Hamilton were trekking through the woods when they encountered a commotion ahead. As they approached, they found dogs in a heated scuffle, and the driver trying to break them apart. The dogs, caught in their harnesses, were fiercely fighting, paying no heed to the driver's commands. The driver's frustration led to harsh treatment of the animals, causing Hamilton to intervene. Enraged by the cruelty, Hamilton confronted the driver, defending the dogs' rights. Despite his initial impulse to resort to violence, Hamilton restrained himself and instead forced the driver to face the consequences of his actions. Reflecting on his outburst, Hamilton acknowledged his uncharacteristic anger but stood by his defense of the mistreated dogs.|"['1.

The three travelers camped that night under a pine tree in the snow, reminiscing about their past adventures. Hamilton had a serious talk with the Indian companion, gradually earning his respect. As days passed, the journey became more challenging. Initially full of energy, they soon realized the toll the harsh conditions were taking on them. Despite blisters and exhaustion, they pressed on, toughening their bodies and spirits. Their conversations evolved from hopes of a pleasant destination to observations of nature and cheerful chats.

Hamilton and his friend were walking by Playgreen Lake when Hamilton shared a wise thought. He mentioned that worrying about the unknown winter placement was futile since they couldn't change it. He advised his friend to focus on the present and make the best of their current situation. His friend, Harry, expressed concerns about being sent to a remote and desolate outpost. Hamilton reassured him that young men like him usually weren't posted to such isolated places. They discussed the experiences of acquaintances in different locations, some good and some challenging. As they admired the view from a rocky spot, a seasoned hunter joined them and confirmed that the Saskatchewan River was indeed a great place.

"""Give me your hand, buddy,"" said Harry, leaping forward and grasping the hunter's strong hand. ""Charlie is a dear friend, and he mentioned you in a letter as one of the best guys he's met."" ""I remember,"" Harry continued. ""Meeting you, Jacques, is almost as good as meeting Charlie. Let's head to my room; there's a fire."" Guiding his new friend, Harry hurried to his quarters. As they passed under the fort gate, snow fell near Hamilton. Jacques shared his view on judging character through sudden actions. The trio spent the day chatting by the stove. Harry was eager to know more about Redfeather. The next day, they visited the Indian village managed by Pastor Conway, a versatile man dedicated to educating and uplifting the community.

The village thrived under good management, but the growth was slow due to the Native Americans' reluctance to settle. Our trio found Pastor Conway in his workshop, instructing an Indian on a tin canoe-like machine. Welcoming the newcomers, the pastor shared his plan to visit a Northern tribe using the tin canoe. The pastor's home overlooked the lake, and his wife warmly hosted the guests. Walking through the village, the pastor confided in Jacques about Redfeather's spiritual journey. Jacques explained how Redfeather intended to come but waited to interpret for the pastor.

"The hunter's expression grew serious. ""That's not possible, sir,"" he said, ""I couldn't help him even if I tried my best. He should consider himself lucky that I don't wish him harm, but to truly love him, it's just impossible."" Jacques, with his naturally philosophical yet uneducated mind, understood this logic. He believed that if God created his soul, body, and the intricate workings of nature around him, then surely God could change, influence, and reshape them according to His will. Although he couldn't feel it, Jacques acknowledged the truth in the hunter's words. The missionary then discussed the importance of not despising others based on their race, emphasizing that God created everyone and despising His creation is akin to despising Him. The hunter, reflecting on these new ideas, accepted a Bible from the missionary, showing his willingness to learn. Jacques also shared his thoughts on the missionary's upcoming journey to preach to the Knisteneux Indians, expressing his belief that the natives' way of life as hunters should be respected. The pastor agreed, acknowledging that change is possible, just like how nothing on earth could break the frozen lake before them."|"[""1.

The pastor explained that just as the sun melts ice into water, so can the Sun of Righteousness change a person's heart. He planned a journey to convert the Indians and asked a hunter, Jacques, to be his guide. Jacques tried to back out but had to keep his promise to the fur-traders. Spring arrived, and Jacques, along with two young men, Harry and Hamilton, set out on a canoe voyage to the Saskatchewan district. They were thrilled to receive orders to join the fur-trade efforts in new lands.

As their small boat carried little cargo, they decided to abandon the usual path and venture through a network of lakes and rivers, a route known to their guide. They hoped to travel faster, avoid a long river stretch, and find more game in this less-traveled area. One evening, about two weeks after leaving Fort Pitt, the voyagers paddled around a wooded point and entered a vast lake. The scene was breathtaking, with hills, promontories, bays, islands, and waterfowl dotting the landscape. Harry marveled at the beauty, suggesting to Jacques that he settle there forever.

It was getting late, and after paddling across the lake for two hours, the exhausted party decided to camp on the other side.

Harry and Hamilton approached him, while Jacques stayed behind to unload the canoe. The stranger, with a mix of Native American and white features, turned out to be an old friend of Harry's.

Today, the group embarked on an adventure to the creek. Mr. Whyte assigned tasks to each member, with one assisting him at the creek and the other helping with fishing. Jacques, Redfeather, Harry, and Hamilton loaded their canoes with supplies and set off. They arrived at a small settlement by the lake, where they met two men and an Indian woman. Soon after, they were alerted by a passing Indian of a herd of deer approaching. The party swiftly paddled to intercept the deer. Harry successfully hunted one deer with a spear, providing much-needed food for the settlement. Mr. Whyte welcomed them upon their return, eager to discuss important dispatches. Charley guided Harry and Hamilton to their quarters, ready to dine in half an hour.|"['1.

Harry reflected as he sat on Charley's bed, observing Hamilton clean up in the corner. He pondered on Mr. Whyte's behavior, suggesting they hadn't expected such conduct. Hamilton, amidst his washing, warned against hasty judgments, citing deceptive first impressions. Charley defended Mr. Whyte, claiming he's kind-hearted once you earn his favor. Harry, however, humorously compared Mr. Whyte to a polar bear. The trio was interrupted by the cook announcing dinner. The Stoney Creek establishment comprised several buildings, with the main house and trading shop prominent.

Charley assured his friends that Misconna wouldn't recognize Jacques among the gathering of Indians meeting with Mr. Whyte. As they hurried back to the fort, they found the hall packed with natives in a somber mood. An old chief spoke of their grievances, demanding more goods in advance for hunting. Mr. Whyte sternly refused, accusing them of laziness. Another chief blamed the failed hunts on the will of the Great Manito. Misconna, unable to contain his anger, warned of consequences if they weren't heard. Tensions escalated, leading to a physical confrontation where Jacques struck Misconna, sparking a violent clash between the white men and the Indians. In the midst of the chaos, Redfeather stepped forward, attempting to mediate the escalating conflict.|"['1.

Listen: Redfeather does not support his white friends over his comrades. He was loyal in the war and would be just now if your cause was right. Redfeather knows something his comrades don't. The white hunter, Jacques, is a friend to Redfeather and the Knisteneux. The dispute wasn't about his boss; it was because Misconna is his enemy. The Indians sheathed their knives, unsure what to do. The unexpected intervention of their comrade and Jacques' explanation calmed them. A loud noise outside made Mr. Whyte fall, shot through the heart. This tragic event reconciled the disputants. Most Indians had no ill-will towards Mr. Whyte. When they saw him dead, anger turned towards Misconna, the assassin. Redfeather and others chased him, while Charley and his friends tended to Mr. Whyte. Jacques and the young men planned to catch Misconna, bringing a sense of relief amid the tragedy.|"[""1.

Jacques guided his party to the Duck River point with two canoes. Harry, Charley, the guide, and a Canadian man split between the canoes. They swiftly descended the river, planning to intercept Misconna. Charley asked Jacques about their strategy. Jacques reassured them, explaining Misconna's likely path and their plan to confront him at the flat-rock fall. As they approached the fall, Charley, eager and brave, led his canoe ahead. Jacques cautioned him about the rocks, but Charley's enthusiasm drove him forward. Suddenly, an Indian appeared, firing an arrow that struck Harry. The chaos caused both canoes to capsize.

Jacques muttered about their unfortunate situation as they landed, trying to dry their wet clothes. Their guns were useless after the soaking, and the Indians were aware of it. The guide examined his gun and realized they were in trouble. Misconna and eight others, unarmed due to their hasty escape, had them surrounded. The guide devised a plan to lead the Indians into a trap by running away, prompting a chase. As the Indians closed in, Jacques hid behind a bush and struck the first one to approach, stunning him. This halted the others momentarily. Misconna shot an arrow at Jacques, but he dodged it and retaliated by throwing his paddle, knocking Misconna down. A fierce brawl ensued, with the white men prevailing due to their fighting skills. In a critical moment, Harry was saved from being pushed off a cliff by a timely intervention from his friends.|['1.

Redfeather hurriedly approached the scene, his chest heaving from the exertion. Hamilton kneeled beside Harry, relieved that he arrived in time. Harry, wounded in the shoulder, was examined and treated. Jacques marveled at Harry's resilience. The defeated Indians were captured and taken to the fort. Misconna, one of the injured, was placed in a canoe. Jacques prevented an attack on Misconna, insisting on fair treatment. Despite this, an Indian fatally struck Misconna. The traders allowed the Indians to take his body. Charley, deeply affected by recent events, found solace in caring for Harry. However, news of his mother's death added to his sorrow. Redfeather and Jacques bonded over discussions from the Bible. Their discussions were cut short by the arrival of Mr. Conway, the missionary, providing comfort and medical aid.

Kate and Harry were both deeply affected. Kate acted erratically, immersing herself in a whirlwind of emotions. Despite the turmoil, she managed to maintain her composure. The grey cat, often neglected and mistreated, sat quietly in the room. Harry, seeking solace, approached the cat with care. As they prepared to visit a secluded bower by the river, their conversation was filled with unspoken emotions. Harry, overwhelmed by his feelings, finally mustered the courage to confess his love for Kate. In a moment of vulnerability, he poured out his heart, seeking forgiveness for his past behavior.

Jacques, Redfeather, and Louis, similarly dressed, sat modestly in a corner, conversing quietly. The lively evening continued with a fiddler playing energetic tunes, inspiring vigorous dancing.
