Irene pointed out the issue of constant friction and lack of consideration among the family members. Alora didn't value the care provided by her father, Jason Jones, for her recovery. Jason initially showed little interest in their new home, focusing on reading all day. The maid, Jane Gladys, was hired due to her family's financial struggles.

Alora shared with Mary Louise that her father, previously uninterested in life, had now found fascination with airplanes.

Mr. Conant decided to read the will, hoping to find a way to help Alora. After finishing, he was disappointed. Mrs. Antoinette Seaver Jones had foolishly given her ex-husband control over her money while her daughter was young. Jason Jones, in Mr. Conant's view, was selfish and neglectful. Despite his wealth, he failed to properly care for his daughter. Mr. Conant confronted Jones, refusing to be involved in his affairs. Alora improved through her friendship with Mary Louise and Irene.

"Peter said, ""We should be able to catch the woman soon with the help of the O'Gorman girl and the police. I trust Josie O'Gorman and have more trust in the police."" The lawyer replied, ""I have thought about it, and considering the man's peculiar traits, I don't think it's a good idea yet.
