Until recently, the area where this story is set in the United States was completely unexplored. The incredible canyons of the Colorado River cut through a region that was barren and without water. Very little was known about this area, except for stories from a few hunters and gold-seekers who had descended into some of the canyons to escape from Indians. It wasn't until 1869 that a government expedition led by Major Powell thoroughly explored these canyons. The expedition traveled through all the canyons, from the upper ones on the Green River to where the Colorado River flows out onto the plains. The explorations took place about eight or nine years after the events in the story. The details about the geography and scenery are based on Mr. Baillie-Grohman's accounts of his visits to the region in the late 1870s. The dangers and challenges of navigating the canyons are described in Major Powell's official report.|"['1.

"Dear Jack,

It has been a while since I last wrote. I've been meaning to share some good news with you, but writing has never been my favorite task. I've been traveling, growing older, but not necessarily richer. I've had some successes, but the money always seems to slip away. Recently, I explored the Ute country and found promising opportunities, but it's currently unsafe to pursue them. I'll be joining a hunting party in the mountains soon. How are things with you? If there's no prospect for your boy at home in a few years, consider sending him to me. I can teach him valuable skills in Colorado. I have connections and know of opportunities in ranching and mechanics. The rough life out here is rewarding. Your family's reply to my offer was expected, but I hope you'll reconsider. Let's meet soon. 

Best,
Tom"|"['1. What has the speaker been doing recently?\nA) Staying at home\nB) Traveling\nC) Working on getting rich\nD) Avoiding writing\nE) None of the above', '2.

Carry and Tom discussed Tom's upcoming voyage cheerfully. They agreed that Tom should pack light, only taking necessary items for the journey. Tom planned to travel steerage to save money and would only carry a small trunk with a few flannel shirts. Carry insisted Tom take fifty pounds for his journey, anticipating expenses for travel, a horse, and other essentials.

The taxi driver easily found the _Parthia_ in the dock. Tom barely made it on board in time as the crew was preparing to depart. The ship sailed out of the dock and anchored in the river. Tom, having been on many ships before, wasn't disoriented like first-time travelers. He observed the busy crew and left his luggage by the front rail, watching the ship being maneuvered out. The steerage area was crowded, but the cabins were empty for now. Tom was directed to the berths, where he chose a lower one for cooler air. The ship, a Cunarder, offered cooked meals and bedding, unlike sailing ships. Tom assisted passengers boarding, noting their confusion. Some accepted his help gratefully, while others were wary. Despite warnings about strangers, Tom felt he had made a difference in easing the worries of fellow passengers.|['1.

With no dedicated gun shop in town, rifles and pistols were available at various stores. The miner, along with Pete Hoskings, scouted for the best rifle for a young boy. Pete recalled a legendary scout named Billy who had a remarkable gun. Billy's widow still had the gun, refusing to sell it despite tempting offers. Pete, determined to secure the prized weapon, planned to visit her that evening. He hoped his past kindness to her would persuade her to part with the cherished gun. The miner understood the sentimental value attached to the gun and was willing to negotiate to acquire it for the young boy.|"['1.

"Jerry mentioned, ""It's twenty minutes early,"" while Tom checked his watch. ""The red-skins won't arrive until it's exactly twelve o'clock. A red-skin is never early or late; they'll be there right on time, no matter how far the meeting was set or when.

"""There,"" he said.

The horses snuffed the corn with some apprehension when it was held out towards them, backing away from the sieves with their ears laid back; but seeing that no harm came to them they presently investigated the food more closely, and at last took a mouthful, after which they proceeded to eat greedily, their new masters patting their necks and talking to them while they did so.

The next morning at sunrise, Jerry and Tom set off on their journey. Riding north, they skirted the hills until they reached the emigrant route. The railway only went as far as Wabash before turning south to Denver. The trip to Fort Bridger was about 500 miles, taking them a month. Sometimes they followed the usual path, other times veering north for more game. Tom, having learned much on the journey, still needed practice with his gun. Jerry praised Tom's progress, noting his skill in shooting a stag and camping. He mentioned the scarcity of buffalo and the challenging landscapes near the Green and Colorado rivers.

At the fort, the group decided to set up camp outside. To ensure safety, they picketed their horses and kept their belongings close. They were cautious of potential threats, especially from lurking Indians. As they settled, a familiar face arrived - a former Seneca chief known for his hunting skills. They shared a meal and stories, discussing the whereabouts of Straight Harry and his group. Surprisingly, they had ventured into risky territory, pursued by Utes.

Tom and his companions had finished cooking their meal. Tom served the meat on a ramrod-turned-spit, along with some bread, tea, and sugar. After eating, they relaxed, smoking and chatting. Jerry praised the Indian's skills and suggested talking to him about his adventures with the 'Rappahoes and Navahoes. The Indian, a trusted friend, had spent years hunting and guiding others through the plains.

Jerry remained silent, puffing on his pipe and gazing at the flames. Tom, accustomed to Jerry's quiet nature, didn't push the conversation. After tending to the horses, Tom returned to the fire, wrapped himself in blankets, and settled down for the night. The next morning, Tom asked Jerry if he was ready to guide him to his uncle.

The land they were about to explore was vast and rugged, akin to a puzzle of mountains scattered randomly. The two Indians accompanying them shed some light on the terrain, explaining that they were far above sea level, where the hills rose high enough to surpass the timber-line. This meant barren lands of rock, lacking sufficient grass for horses, and unbearably cold winters making it impossible for the Indians to reside there. The valleys sheltered the Indian villages, keeping them hidden from sight. The region was home to wapitis and big-horns, large animals with mighty horns, and mountain sheep, mainly found above the timber-line. Although the land was abundant in beavers, their numbers had dwindled due to the trade with the whites. Bears were also present, but the risks involved in hunting them outweighed the rewards. The maps of the area were unreliable, based on vague tales from trappers, making the journey through the mountains perilous and uncertain.

Tom and Jerry rode through the rugged landscape, surrounded by sagebrush and towering rock formations. The miner explained to Tom that the land was once flat, but over time, rain and rivers carved out the terrain, leaving behind the unique buttes and crags that now stood. The miner mentioned a scientific explorer who believed the area was once underwater, with different rocks settling at the bottom, creating the diverse colors seen today. As they rode, Hunting Dog signaled a halt, and they observed two Indians stalking a herd of deer. The Indians fired their rifles, and Jerry explained that they likely only took the hindquarters of the deer, as Native Americans were known to be selective in their hunting practices.|['1.

In the early afternoon, as they rode past the buttes and reached a small lake, the group decided to make camp. With no suitable bushes nearby, they chose the sheltered side of a large boulder. Carefully collecting dry wood, they lit a smokeless fire. The miner warned about the importance of concealing their campfire from any lurking red-skins. The chief and Hunting Dog discovered traces of the white men's campfire, indicating that they were being followed. The miner explained the differences in footprints left by white men and Native Americans, helping them realize they were being tracked.

Tom took a few minutes to comprehend his companion's words. He realized that the straight alignment of footprints indicated the person walked in a line, not turning their toes outward. The chief gathered fuel, starting a bright fire. Later, Hunting Dog returned with news. He showed the chief black dust on two leaves, indicating the presence of a horse and gunshots fired by an Indian. Jerry, concerned for their friends, suggested they move on. The chief agreed, acknowledging Harry's knowledge of hiding his trail. They discussed the dangers posed by the 'Rappahoes in the area and Harry's planned route to evade them.

"""Leave your horses by mine,"" he said as they joined him. ""Trail very bad, all rock."" He spoke to the young Indian, who, on dismounting, at once went forward, quartering the ground like a spaniel in search of game, while the chief as carefully searched along the bank.

""The white men went forward, the red men could not find the trail, and thought that they had kept in the river, so they went up to search for them. Come, let us go forward,"" the chief said.

After riding some fifteen miles beyond the stream, and crossing two similar though smaller rivulets, the chief, after a few words with Jerry, turned off to the left and followed the foot of the hills. At the mouth of a narrow valley, he stopped, examined the ground carefully, and then led the way up it, carrying his rifle in readiness across the peak of the saddle.

As they waited for the young Indian to return, Tom's hunger grew desperate. It was three o'clock in the afternoon, and they had only eaten a few leftover bites of meat from the day before. The Indians quickly gathered dried wood and cooked fish over hot ashes. Tom realized they had traveled nearly forty miles and needed to rest the horses for a couple of hours. They planned to continue at night, avoiding the risk of ambush in the dark. The chief warned of Indian villages in the valley, advising caution. They spotted smoke ahead, indicating the presence of Indians. Hunting Dog signaled the sighting of ten 'Rappahoes riding slowly with packed meat, unaware of the white men's trail.

They began their journey quietly, the leader in front, Jerry behind him, and Tom riding between them and Hunting Dog, who brought up the rear. Tom was instructed to stay silent, but if he needed to speak urgently, he could whisper to Jerry. They remained alert, as they could encounter a group at any moment. Passing by Indian villages, they observed the flickering firelight and heard distant sounds. The chief signaled Hunting Dog to scout ahead towards the village. As they rode on, the pace quickened. They heard distant gunshots, indicating a battle ahead. Jerry and Tom realized the seriousness of the situation, understanding the need for caution.

The hills sloped down sharply, leading to the entrance of the Rivière de Noir valley, a branch of the Big Wind River. The gunfire had dwindled, with sporadic shots heard. Jerry suggested they could easily defend the spot against any attackers, as there was water and some feed for the horses. He reassured Tom, saying their friends were likely safe for a while. The group moved up the canyon with the horses. The miner noted an ancient landslide, now covered with grass and trees. He mentioned the risk of being trapped if the Indians found them.

"Native Americans often rely on their fingers to count, not realizing that white men only have four fingers.

The Native Americans, or ""Red-skins,"" have various superstitions and believe that certain occurrences, like fire emerging from a bush where a 'Rappahoe was killed, signify bad omens.

The group, led by the chief, hurriedly discussed their escape plan from the pursuing 'Rappahoes. The chief, confident that there were no 'Rappahoes in the valley, urged the group to cross the river quickly. He had spotted Indian villages with fires on the hillsides and knew they needed to move before daylight. Sam Hicks warned about the 'Rappahoes' swift retaliation upon realizing their escape route. The group continued cautiously, facing obstacles like a river mishap and a narrow valley.

Tom heard Jerry growl as they rode through the valley, knowing that concealment was no longer possible. An Indian spotted them in the moonlight, and the group galloped away. Shots were fired from behind, but they managed to reach the shelter of the trees by the stream. Harry explained that the Indians had followed their trail using torches and set fires as a warning to their villages. They were now being pursued and needed to find a place to make a stand. As they climbed the steep terrain, the pack-horses struggled, and more Indians appeared behind them.

"No more words were needed. Harry and his friends rode slower while the Indians, Jerry, and Tom dismounted, taking cover behind boulders. The Indians noticed them and gathered for a discussion. ""Prepare your gun, Tom,"" Jerry instructed, ""add more powder. Aim slightly above the target for elevation. You have a good shot."" Tom followed the advice, aimed, and fired. The Indians reacted, retreating down the valley. Impressed, the Senecas praised Tom's shot. The Indians split into two groups, advancing cautiously.

As they rode past, Jerry warned Tom about a grizzly nearby. Hunting Dog found a well-used trail between boulders, likely an Indian path. Jerry marveled at the steep, winding trail, speculating that the Indians discovered it by tracking game.

Ben and his companions found themselves in a tough spot as a storm raged outside. To shield themselves from the cold, they decided to fortify their shelter with bundles of wood and blankets.

When morning broke, they woke to find a thick layer of snow covering everything. They quickly cleared the snow, melted it for water, and prepared a meager meal for themselves and their horses.

One evening, while near the wagons, I saw some bright-looking maids among the Mormons. It bothered me to think they might be given to some old man with many wives.

As the sun began to set, the lone horseman I had been tracking set up camp with his companions. I had planned to sneak closer under the cover of darkness to eavesdrop on their conversation, particularly to confirm if the women were there willingly. However, my initial bravado waned, and I considered retreating down the valley. Suddenly, the sound of approaching horsemen from the camp made me realize my mistake. The group had brought reinforcements, the Regulators or as the Mormons called them, the Destroying Angels. They were hunting for me, and I found myself trapped at the foot of a steep cliff.

I cautiously descended the rocks, taking my time to avoid drawing attention from the men below with torches. The horsemen continued firing, hoping to dislodge me. As I reached a narrow ledge, I had to walk with caution, knowing I was an easy target. The ledge widened, providing space to lie down. I assessed the situation, realizing the men were closing in. I found a way to climb up to the next ledge, eventually reaching safety. I hid until morning, then rejoined the caravan. My companions criticized my risky encounter with the Mormons. Despite my recklessness, I survived the ordeal. A mishap with the fire interrupted our tea preparation, but we accepted it as part of our adventure.|"['1.

The fire crackled to life again, and the group waited for the water to boil for tea. The bread, soaked from the kettle's water, took a while to be edible. As darkness fell, they settled in for the night. Suddenly, Leaping Dog leaped up, rifle in hand, as a large head appeared at the entrance. Five rifles fired, and a thud followed outside. Despite having eaten recently, they cooked bear-meat slices for a satisfying meal. Their spirits lifted, knowing meat was scarce. Curiosity and hunger led the intruder to them. Sleep was forgotten, and they stayed up smoking pipes till midnight. The next morning, they skinned the bear, and the snowfall lessened. They secured the bear's skin above the fire for warmth. The chief warned of Indians in the valley, and Harry shared stories of deadly snow-slides. The ground rumbled, signaling danger ahead.|['1.

The men were standing near a rock when suddenly a massive avalanche of snow and rocks thundered down the cliff, crashing trees and boulders. The ground shook, and the men braced themselves, fearing for their lives. After the deafening roar, a tense silence fell. Sam Hicks cautiously stepped forward, and the group, visibly shaken, hesitated. Tom's uncle acknowledged their fear, emphasizing the importance of staying composed in dangerous situations. He suggested a toast to thank their luck and offered a drink of whisky to calm their nerves. The men, grateful for their safety, removed their hats and took a moment to express their gratitude. Ben poured whisky for everyone, and they drank, acknowledging its power as both a friend and a foe. Harry warned of the dangers of alcohol but shared its occasional benefits in emergencies. He advised Tom to be cautious around liquor, as it had ruined many lives.|"['1.

Tom, it's tough out here. Many folks start like you, not caring much, but soon they get drawn in and can't let go. Imagine being out in the hills for months hunting or looking for gold, then coming to town where friends offer drinks and gambling. It's hard to say no. There's not much else to do here. I know I've gambled, but I've stopped. It's easier to quit cards than drinking once you start. It's a relief it was cards that took my money, not drink. Let's change the subject. Let's check out the snow-slide. They wrapped in robes and went outside. The snow had cleared a path down the slope, sweeping away everything in its path. They saw the bear's hide intact, narrowly escaping being buried. The snowfall stopped, and they prepared to leave the next morning. The mountains were alive with sounds - trees breaking under snow, avalanches rumbling. The journey ahead would be hard, with deep snow slowing down the horses.|"['1.

The group faced a tough decision while navigating treacherous snowy terrain. The chief and his companions debated whether to continue their journey or wait for better conditions. Despite the risks of avalanches and losing the trail, they pressed on cautiously. Leaping Horse, the chief, suggested the pass lay to the west, but uncertainty loomed. Sam Hicks proposed returning to their last spot to wait out the snow. The group weighed the dangers of continuing versus the safety of retreating. Ultimately, they chose to prioritize their safety, acknowledging the unpredictable nature of the weather and the harsh reality of their situation. Leaping Horse remained prepared to follow whatever path his companions decided upon, showing resilience and unity in the face of adversity.|"['1.

Harry and his companions decided to fortify their shelter for the harsh winter ahead. With Leaping Horse's reassurance of abundant game, they planned to focus on hunting for meat. Harry emphasized the importance of creating a roof for their shelter and gathering food supplies. As the snow fell heavily, they worked together to clear the snow off the shelter's roof, ensuring its stability. Despite the challenges, they remained determined to survive the winter. They understood the need to care for their horses and make strategic decisions to ensure their survival.

For six days, snow fell continuously. They cleared it off the hide every morning, noon, and night, never leaving the shelter. The snow broke through the trees, startling the horses. Finally, the snow stopped, and the next day was clear. The group went out, clearing a path and gathering firewood. They cooked a quick meal, then led the horses down the valley. They cut poles for a roof and hunted wapiti. The chief drove the wapiti back towards them. They shot the wapiti, using rifles carefully. They carried the deer back, cut poles for the roof, and built it by night. The Indians returned with more deer, and the day ended with a completed shelter.|['1.

In the morning, the roof was finished with hides stretched over the frame and secured tightly with thongs. Trees and brushwood were chopped down to create a level floor. The foliage was fed to the horses, and the wood was stacked for fuel. The chief discovered a pine-wood area at the valley's upper end, providing good shelter for the horses. Nearby, there were plenty of bushes and a grass-covered meadow once inhabited by beavers. The group planned to set up a bear-trap and sew more skins together to finish their hut. They discussed the need for a chimney to prevent smoke from filling the hut. Some of them went to the valley with axes to cut wood, while others took the horses to graze on the grass in the meadow. The valley was once a beaver meadow, now reclaimed by nature, offering rich grass for the horses to feed on during the winter.|"['1.

In the woods, a clever trap was set up to catch wild animals for food. A deer was lured by a piece of venison hanging just beyond its reach. The hunters had rigged a rope to release a tree branch when the meat was tugged, ensnaring any creature underneath. One day, growls alerted the hunters to a huge bear caught in the trap. Despite its struggles, the bear was swiftly taken down by a volley of bullets. This successful hunt provided them with meat and valuable skins. Although other hunting attempts were less fruitful, they managed to shoot deer and big-horn sheep. On another occasion, they found evidence of a fierce battle between a bear and their horses, which had bravely fought off the predator. The hunters marveled at the horses' defensive tactics and the bear's gruesome injuries from their powerful kicks.|"['1.

"The animal lay where it had fallen, a mile up the valley. They went up and tied the great sheep's feet together, and putting a pole through them brought it down to the hut. Partly skinning it, they obtained some fat and melted this in a kettle over the fire. Sam Hicks had stayed behind at the fire, the horses all standing near him, excited at the prospect of their usual meal. As soon as the fat was melted, it was poured into the horse's wounds. The mess of gruel was then prepared and given to the animals. The bear was skinned, and the hams cut off, then by a united effort, it was dragged some distance from the hut, and the carcass of the big-horn, the bear's flesh and hide, were afterwards carried up to the hut.

Early in February, the cold reached its extreme point, and in spite of keeping up a good fire, they had long before this been compelled to build up the entrance with a wall of firewood, the interstices being stuffed with moss; the hut was lighted by lamps of bear and deer fat melted down and poured into tin drinking-cups, the wicks being composed of strips of birch bark.

"Tom yelled loudly, ""They have gone right down!"" Harry acknowledged with a wave, and the men hurried to the corner. The Indians were already a quarter mile away, entering the woods below. Just as the whites prepared to fire, the chief intervened, ""No need to shoot. Hide behind rocks; don't reveal our rifles to the 'Rappahoes.""

Jerry expressed his concern about the hard ground making it impossible to drive posts for protection. Tom suggested building a wall of ice by cutting out blocks of snow, pouring water over them to freeze into a solid structure. The group agreed to create a semicircular line at the top of the pathway for defense. They worked tirelessly, cutting out snow blocks and piling them to form a wall. Tom melted snow to pour over the blocks, while the others trampled down loose snow behind the wall. By nightfall, the wall stood three feet tall, serving as a sturdy fortification. The chief scouted for any approaching danger but found none. They left a gap for horses to pass through and took turns keeping watch. The chief settled in for the night behind the wall, ready to keep a lookout over the snowy landscape for any movement in the darkness.|"[""1.

The hut was silent unusually early as the men, fatigued from a hard day's work, retired early. At dawn, they arose briefly to face the intense cold, taking hot tea and a quick breakfast. The chief left Hunting Dog behind as they resumed work on the wall, adding three feet to its height. The decision was made to focus solely on building the wall taller before reinforcing it the next day. Harry expressed confidence in the wall's strength, ensuring safety from potential Indian attacks. A lean-to shelter was quickly constructed against the wall for warmth during watch shifts.

Despite the buffalo robe providing some protection, it was bitterly cold outside. The warmth of the fire during his turn was a relief. Time passed swiftly with the changes, and he was surprised when his uncle and Sam took over. The others, including the chief, were still smoking by the fire. The chief, vigilant, would frequently stand on the platform listening intently. Just before the guard change, he whispered something to Hunting Dog. Suddenly, the chief raised his rifle, firing at a figure that had been hidden in the snow. The men rushed over. Later, at daybreak, Sam fired at a bush where the trail was, suspecting movement.

They walked together and paused to observe the body of the young Indian shot by the chief. The Indian had crawled unnoticed, creating a trench in the snow to shield himself. The chief, noticing a slight movement in the snow, accurately fired, hitting the Indian. Although unarmed, the Indian displayed bravery. Harry remarked on the Indian's fate, acknowledging his intent to harm them. Sam admitted his hasty shot, causing laughter. The group discussed the chief's restraint due to his interactions with whites. They anticipated the Indians would not attack due to the fort's strength. Harry recalled a past encounter where they repelled Navahoes. The group acknowledged the risks of fighting in the cold and the advantage of their rifles.

"One night, as Tom kept watch, a loud noise caught his attention from beyond the cliff wall. It escalated into a deafening roar as a mass of white snow cascaded down. Tom swiftly ran to the hut, sensing danger. Without a word, everyone sprang up at the rumbling sound and trembling rocks. Horses panicked, trying to break free. ""Backs to the wall!"" Harry yelled, and a crash followed as the roof collapsed, burying them in snow. After a tense moment, they were rescued by Harry and the others. Ben, injured but safe, needed help.

That evening, the group began their journey. The horses were loaded by sunset, and they set off half an hour later. Ben Gulston needed help to mount his horse due to a strained back. The moonlit snow illuminated their path, lifting their spirits as they left their six-month prison behind. They traveled silently to avoid triggering snow-slides. Crossing the valley through the cliff wall, they attempted to find a pass. After a challenging ascent, they descended into another valley, likely leading to the pass.

For the next six weeks, they journeyed slowly, camping by streams for days before marching on. They left the beaver traps behind but stumbled upon beaver villages. By being patient, they managed to shoot around fifty beavers for their skins. Tom would observe the beavers at work in the evenings but refused to shoot them, feeling it was akin to shooting humans at work. They also hunted wolverines and other animals, gathering enough skins to buy new supplies and have a hundred dollars each.

Tom and his uncle rode through the desolate badlands, keeping close to the edge to avoid long detours. The chief and his companion, Leaping Horse, had no interest in gold from the mine they were exploring. Leaping Horse was like a brother to Tom's uncle, refusing to take any gold. Instead, they preferred hunting and fighting alongside their friends. The Indians found contentment in hunting for food and skins, trading them for supplies. The chief's share was intended for Tom's sisters, showing his loyalty to the family. Tom's uncle explained the arrangement to his partners, who were satisfied with the fair division.

It is hot now, and in the height of summer the heat and glare from the rock must be awful."" ""That is so, lad. One knows whereabouts it goes, as men driven by thirst have followed cañons down to it; and in some places it runs for many miles across low land before it plunges into another cañon. Then it cuts its way for two or three hundred miles, perhaps, through the hills, with walls two or three thousand feet high. No one, so far as I know, has gone down these big cañons, but it is certain there are rapids and whirlpools and rocks in them. Two or three parties have gone down through some of the shorter cañons to escape Indians, and most of them have never been heard of again, but one or two have got down some distance and managed to escape.""

Jerry skillfully drove the wedge into the crevice, revealing a hidden treasure of gold. The miners rejoiced at the discovery, with the gold studded in thin leafy plates. Jerry wiped his forehead, acknowledging the significance of the find. The men labored to break up the hard quartz rock, bound together by gold. After breaking it into manageable pieces, they concealed the traces of their work to secure their claim. Leaping Horse, indifferent to gold, shared his perspective on wealth and contentment. Despite philosophical differences, the allure of gold for Jerry and his companions represented a means to return home, live comfortably, and bring happiness to their loved ones.|"['1.

Leaping Horse's heart was heavy as he realized that his white brother, Harry, would soon journey across the vast ocean, leaving him behind. Harry, acknowledging his oversight, promised to return for hunting trips every year to maintain their bond. The men collected quartz samples, eager about the possible fortune. They crushed the rock, revealing a high gold content, sparking excitement. They followed the quartz vein, finding it narrower but still promising. Further exploration exposed a wider lode with rich gold deposits. The men contemplated the potential wealth hidden in the lode, planning to return with drills and powder for deeper exploration.

It required three days of hard labor to construct the cradle and troughs for gold mining. The troughs were roughly but securely built using clay to seal the joints. A dam was erected to control the water flow, and a system of trestles was used to guide the water to the cradle. The chief and Tom managed the camp while others worked. The chief hunted for food and firewood cautiously to avoid detection. The men started washing the gravel for gold, carefully collecting the gold-dust in pans. After washing, mercury was used to extract gold from the sand. The process involved filtering the amalgam through wash-leather to separate gold from mercury. Finally, they obtained six lumps of amalgam, each the size of small hens' eggs.|"['1.

Gold and quicksilver have a special connection. When gold meets quicksilver, it gets absorbed, similar to how salt absorbs water. The gold thickens the quicksilver, and when squeezed through leather, the quicksilver is strained out, leaving behind a thickened substance. Applying more pressure won't help, as it could lead to squeezing some gold through the leather. By shaking the cradle, the heavier gold settles at the bottom, while every gold particle that touches the quicksilver is absorbed. To separate the gold, they heat the mixture in a clay crucible with borax, evaporating the quicksilver and leaving behind pure gold. The miners worked diligently for seven weeks, extracting about a pound of gold daily. They secured the gold in deer-skin bags for safety. When they heard gunshots, they prepared for a possible attack by unknown intruders.|['1.

Harry and Jerry discussed their precarious situation, surrounded by a large group of Indians. Jerry suggested that the Indians must have crossed the valley they were in just after they left. They realized they were in a tight spot with enemies on both sides. Jerry took a shot at one of the Indians, causing chaos among them. They quickly prepared a meal over a fire, knowing they needed to act fast. They decided their best chance was to ride down the narrow valley, where they could defend themselves better.

The blankets and buffalo rugs were packed behind the saddles once they were secured on the horses. They had a small amount of meat left, as the chief planned to hunt the next morning. They attached this, along with eighty pounds of flour, to a pack-horse. After filling their powder-horns and holsters with ammunition, they mounted their horses. Harry mentioned they might gain a couple of hundred yards before being spotted. However, upon leaving the woods, they heard loud yells from Indians watching from the slopes. They rode off at full speed, with the Indians in pursuit. Reaching the narrow valley, they dismounted and fired at their pursuers, causing them to retreat.

Harry explained that their best chance of escape was to build rafts from nearby trees by the riverbank. They needed to act fast as the Utes could attack at any moment. The plan was to construct rafts using trunks and lariats to carry themselves and their supplies. Unfortunately, the horses would have to be left behind or put down to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Utes. Tom struggled with the idea of sacrificing his horse, feeling a deep bond with the animal. Harry reassured Tom and assigned him to guard duty during the escape.

Tom joined his uncle at the fire to eat his meal, only to find that essential items like stores, blankets, and robes were missing. After finishing his meal, his uncle took him to the river where two sturdy canoes awaited them. These canoes were about twenty feet long and five feet wide, showcasing strength over beauty. Constructed with strong pine pieces, the canoes had ribs placed at intervals along the sides and a flat bottom. The outer layer was made of tough wood and horse hides, sewn together with thongs and smeared with fat for protection. Tom's uncle explained that the canoes were built wide for light draught in case of shallow waters or rocks. They prepared ten paddles and spare hides for repairs. Tom expressed gratitude, despite the heavy weight of the canoes. The group divided their supplies between the two boats, with plans for Tom, his uncle, and two others to paddle together downstream.|"['1.

When everything was set, Harry shot his rifle, and soon Hunting Dog ran down. The rest were seated. Hunting Dog joined Harry in his boat, and they set off. The river flowed smoothly. Harry planned to practice paddling upstream before rough waters. Tom, Hunting Dog, the chief, and Harry were in the boats. Paddles were easier for beginners than oars. After practice, they could propel the boats well. They passed the canyon's end and cliffs rose. Harry instructed Tom on steering. The boats initially swerved but improved. After practice, they landed for the night, hoping for a bear. The canoes were tied to trees. They lit a fire, cooked horsemeat, and ate. Tom hesitated but saw others eat without issue. Harry assured him it was like beef.|['1.

Encouraged by their successful start, Tom took a bite of the horse meat and found it surprisingly good due to the animals' excellent condition from their time in the valley. Terry agreed, mentioning that after a year of deer and bear meat, horse meat was a welcome change. Harry suggested they rest for two days to dry the meat like the Indians do with buffalo meat, ensuring it would keep. They planned to practice paddling during this time to get more comfortable in the canoes. They discussed using gut from a small animal for fishing lines and cutting strips from hides for longer lines. Overall, they were relieved to have escaped the valley and were optimistic about their future journey.|"['1.

By evening, the group noticed a significant improvement in their paddling skills compared to the previous day. After another day of practice, everyone felt confident about their progress. The meat was fully dried by nightfall on the second day, packed, and the next morning they set off early. They agreed to keep the boats a hundred yards apart, allowing the leader to signal any upcoming challenges to the others. This precaution ensured they could navigate safely. Harry's boat led the way, and as they ventured into unexplored territory, the landscape surprised them. The river widened, surrounded by hills and cliffs. They spotted deer and discussed hunting for fresh meat. As they anticipated rough waters ahead, they approached a challenging gap in the cliffs, preparing to navigate it cautiously.|"['1.

As they approached the gorge, the current grew stronger. Harry signaled the other boat, and both canoes headed to the shore. The chief pointed to a ledge above, suggesting Hunting Dog hunt while they explored the canyon. Tom couldn't see what the chief pointed to, but Hunting Dog set off to hunt. They walked along the rocks, getting a better view of the river turning into waves and white foam downstream. The group reached a wide part of the gorge, where the water looked rough. Harry mentioned the canoes could navigate through the waves safely. Despite the loud water, they discussed the plan. The chief was confident, and Jerry mentioned staying close to the side and paddling hard would help them through. After discussing the strategy, they returned to their boats. Jerry carried the deer, and they prepared for the challenging journey through the rapids. Harry asked Tom if he felt confident to paddle through the dangerous waters, leaving the decision to him.|['1.

"""I believe I could handle it, uncle, as I've been in rough seas before at Spithead in wherries. But maybe it's best for the chief to take my spot this time, so I can see how I feel,"" Tom suggested. The boat swiftly departed from the shore and entered a turbulent gorge. Tom focused on paddling with all his might, trying to ignore the chaotic waters around him. Despite feeling weak and trembling, he gathered his composure by observing the chief's calm demeanor. After successfully navigating the challenging waters, Tom regained his strength, ready to continue their journey. ""I'll be fine soon, uncle,"" Tom assured.

"A mile further down the river, the group spotted a pile of driftwood on the left bank. Harry steered the canoe towards it, and they carefully got out. Shortly after, the other canoe joined them. ""That was quite a wild ride,"" Jerry exclaimed, feeling shaken by the rough waters. They decided to take a break and dry their wet blankets and blankets in the sun. The group spent the day resting, smoking, and napping. The next morning, they continued down the river, entering a deep canyon with swift rapids.

Jerry and his friends were on a long journey down the river. They faced dangers from both the land and the people who lived there. Jerry preferred carrying the canoe over rough terrain to risking a confrontation with the Navahoes, known for their fierce fighting spirit. Ben agreed, mentioning the Navahoes and Apaches' long history of raiding Mexico. The group encountered various landscapes, from wide valleys to rugged peaks and cliffs. As they navigated the river, they faced challenges like dangerous rapids and falls. Despite upsets and encounters with rattlesnakes, they pressed on, exploring ancient ruins and cliff dwellings along the way.

Sailing through a short cañon, the boats entered a valley with flat shores along the river. To the right, a wide side cañon offered a potential route into the hills. Further down, signs of trees and cultivation were visible, with smoke rising in the distance. As they neared the shore, Leaping Horse cautioned Harry about potential danger from the smoke, suspecting bad Indians. Suddenly, a group of hostile Indians emerged, firing shots at the boats. In the chaos, Ben was fatally hit. Despite the grief and anger, the men retaliated, managing to take down one of the attackers. Realizing the Indians might be regrouping, the group decided to pause, have a meal, and plan their next move cautiously.|"['1.

Jerry expressed concern about the dangerous situation they were facing, debating whether to risk traveling through the canyons at night or leaving the boats to cross on foot. Harry pointed out the risks of crossing on foot due to the lack of settlements and harsh terrain. The chief warned about the Navahoes tracking them and the dangers of the rocky and waterless landscape. Harry proposed a plan to paddle under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, hoping to outrun the pursuing Navahoes. Despite the dangers, they decided to bury their deceased companion, Ben, and continued their journey with heavy hearts, especially impacting Tom, who felt a deep loss for his friend.

During the day, only a few men stayed watchful on the opposite bank to avoid the Navahoes. As darkness fell, the group quietly boarded their canoes and began rowing downstream. Harry emphasized the need for silent paddling. After an hour, they approached a dark wall of rock, signaling to stop paddling to avoid a nearby rapid. Suddenly, a shout and rifle shots echoed, but the group sped away. Harry reassured them that they were likely not seen. They decided to anchor near the rapid. Tom stayed behind to start a fire. When the others returned, they found out the Navahoes had left. Tom lit the fire using matches stored in waterproof containers.|['1.

"""It's better than we thought,"" Harry remarked. ""The noise was just an echo off the smooth rocks. Luckily, we camped here last night. The river narrows ahead, with water brushing against the walls. We climbed up to a ledge parallel to the water, but the river's character remains the same. We're off to a good start."" After a quick meal, they resumed their journey in canoes. The canyon resembled the previous one, with high walls and shelves. The river was swift, and they covered six miles in half an hour. Approaching a dangerous roar, they disembarked before a natural dam. The river flowed over it, creating a rapid downstream. They portaged the boats and continued cautiously. Passing more falls, they expertly navigated the river. Entering a narrow gorge, they faced swift currents and rocky walls. After four miles, they found a sandy strip.

The group faced a daunting river journey, navigating treacherous rocks and whirlpools. The strong current saved them from disaster, but obstacles were aplenty. After days of hard work, they encountered a roaring rapid. Opting to avoid a risky descent, they explored a gulch for a safer route. Upon spotting a big-horn sheep, they secured fresh meat. The team made a grueling portage to bypass the dangerous cataract. The next day, they laboriously transported canoes and supplies. With no alternative but to descend the fall, they readied for the perilous journey. Carefully lowering the boats with ropes, they eventually reached the end of the rocky cliffs. Armed with ropes and determination, the group prepared for the challenging descent ahead.|['1.

The available rope was split into two lengths, tied to each canoe. One boat descended, allowing the crew to find footing on a ledge before the other boat followed. The process continued, with men navigating narrow ledges and rocks along the rock wall and stream. Progress was slow due to the treacherous terrain and deafening noise of the water. Suddenly, a tragic accident occurred when a boat capsized. The crew swiftly sprang into action, maneuvering through dangerous rapids and narrowly avoiding disaster. With teamwork and skillful paddling, they managed to rescue a crew member stranded on a rock ledge.

With difficulty, Jerry, who was unconscious, was placed in the boat. Hunting Dog smoothly climbed aboard near the stern. The young Indian explained that the boat went down a narrow passage between rocks, where Jerry fell off due to a collision. Hunting Dog, at the stern, tried to hold on but was swept into an eddy. He then swam to safety and called for help. Harry quickly found a spare paddle and they continued downstream. The boat maneuvered through the rough waters, narrowly avoiding capsizing. Eventually, they reached calm waters. Grateful for their safety, Harry asked the chief about Sam's canoe. The chief pointed to it on a rock ledge. They retrieved the canoe and the chief skillfully set Jerry's dislocated shoulder using wood splints and flannel. After giving Jerry some brandy and water, they secured his arm and provided comfort.|"[""1.

During their wilderness journey, a group of explorers faced a challenging situation when one of their members, Jerry, suffered an injury after their canoe capsized. Despite the mishap, the team managed to build a fire, cook food, and tend to Jerry's injuries. They decided to stay put for a few days to allow Jerry to recover. The group discussed the importance of having two canoes for safety and the need to navigate treacherous waters carefully.

Harry explained to Jerry that Sam had likely drowned when the boat capsized. Despite the emotional moment, they decided to focus on breakfast preparations. Jerry, feeling like a burden due to his injury, was comforted by Harry, who suggested rest would help. Meanwhile, Hunting Dog and Tom went fishing, catching plenty of trout for a delicious meal.

After a long journey down the river, Harry, Tom, and Jerry finally made it out of the dangerous cañon. Jerry had recovered from his injuries and was finally able to help out. They caught a large amount of fish to sustain them on their journey. As they reached Fort Mojarve, a bustling settlement, they decided to keep quiet about their adventures to avoid trouble.

Harry nodded, freeing two small bags and placing them in his pocket before heading to the Fort with Jerry and the Indians. Tom released the other bags, covered them with a buffalo-robe, and spent hours reflecting on their adventures by the calm river. As darkness fell, the group returned with supplies and horses. They changed into new clothes and rode to the village. The next morning, they enjoyed a Mexican breakfast and readied the horses for the journey to Santa Fé. They joined a caravan for safety and embarked on a long trip without encountering any Indians. The traders found their story of crossing the Colorado River unbelievable. After a few days in Santa Fé, they continued north, sharing the gold equally among them. Harry insisted the Indians accept their fair share as they all faced danger together. He encouraged them to consider a future beyond hunting and embrace a more settled life.|"['1.

"The chief solemnly responded, ""We will take the gold if my brother wishes it.

Choosing reliable miners is crucial for successful gold mining. Rushing this decision can lead to disaster. It's better to recruit inexperienced but eager workers from the east who are temporarily stranded due to snowmelt. Money is not an issue; a deposit of $25,000 is ready, and others will invest too. Old prospector Mat Morgan is a trustworthy choice. Stay for a while, then head to Salt Lake City before returning to Bridger. Send rock samples for financial arrangements. Later, buy supplies and recruit steady workers for the journey. By March, wagons will transport machinery and provisions to Bridger. Carefully select honest men for the task.

The Ute chief and the white men engaged in negotiations for the land. The Utes initially demanded a large amount of goods in exchange for the land taken. However, the white men, led by Harry and Leaping Horse, bargained and agreed to a smaller amount of goods, about half of the initial demand. A peaceful agreement was reached, and a promise was made to deliver the rest of the goods in three months.

The Utes accepted the goods, smoked the calumet of peace, and departed, leaving behind a strengthened friendship.

When nearing the fort, the guards would ride ahead, leaving only a few by the wagon. Inside were boxes, covered by sacks, holding provisions like flour, molasses, bacon, tea, and sugar. After buying supplies, the wagon headed to the fort. Jerry or Pete, with another man, carried the boxes to the Major's quarters. The valley's population grew, miners staked claims, and a store opened. No liquor was allowed at the mine. Tom's sisters thanked him for the money sent, but asked him to stop. They assured him the school was fine. The mine operated in winter, with more machinery and buildings added. By fall, the valley was deserted. Most miners stayed, having earned well. They were content and ready to continue working.|"['1.

An agreement was made with the Major at Fort Bridger for an escort led by a junior officer to accompany two wagons carrying the treasure to Denver. Pete Hoskings and Jerry were to stay behind as overseers of the mine during the winter. Harry and Tom decided to travel to England and return in the spring. The quality of the ore had significantly decreased, with the vein running out below where they had been working. Despite this, the mine remained exceptionally valuable, although it now contained only a fraction of the gold extracted previously. Only Harry, Pete Hoskings, Jerry, and Tom knew the exact amount of gold extracted in less than six months, while the miners were aware it was substantial. After deducting expenses, the treasure sent down was valued at £128,000, with the mine estimated to be worth double that amount if sold. Harry and Tom bid farewell to Pete and Jerry, then rode with the last wagon to Bridger. The iron boxes containing the treasure had been concealed in deer-skins and were carefully loaded onto the wagons. Despite encountering severe snowstorms, they safely reached Denver. The town had grown significantly since Tom's last visit, with new buildings and streets. They proceeded to the bank, where the treasure was securely stored in the vaults. Harry generously rewarded the soldiers of the escort and expressed gratitude to the Major. Harry reflected on their newfound wealth and the future prospects of the mine, anticipating continued profitability for years to come. Tom suggested a fair distribution|"['Question 1:\nWhat was the agreement made with the Major at Fort Bridger?\nA) To purchase additional wagons for the journey\nB) To sell the mine to the soldiers\nC) To provide an escort for the treasure to Denver\nD) To close the mine for the winter\nE) To hire more miners for the operation', 'Question 2:\nWho stayed behind as overseers of the mine during the winter?\nA) Harry and Tom\nB) The soldiers of the escort\nC) The miners\nD) Pete Hoskings and Jerry\nE) The Major at Fort Bridger', 'Question 3:\nWhat happened to the quality of the ore in the mine?\nA) It significantly increased\nB) It remained the same\nC) It became exceptionally valuable\nD) It decreased significantly\nE) It was extracted in less than six months', 'Question 4:\nWho knew the exact amount of gold extracted in less than six months?\nA) The miners\nB) The soldiers of the escort\nC) Pete Hoskings and Jerry\nD) Harry and Tom\nE) The Major at Fort Bridger', 'Question 5:\nHow much was the treasure sent down to Denver valued at after deducting expenses?\nA) £64,000\nB) £128,000\nC) £256,000\nD) £192,000\nE) £320,000', ""Question 6:\nWhere was the treasure securely stored in Denver?\nA) In the wagons\nB) In the mine\nC) In the bank vaults\nD) In the soldiers' barracks\nE) In the Major's office""]"|['C) To provide an escort for the treasure to Denver', 'D) Pete Hoskings and Jerry', 'D) It decreased significantly', 'D) Harry and Tom', 'B) £128,000', 'C) In the bank vaults']
In the morning, Harry spent two hours at the bank. He saw the gold weighed and got a receipt for its value, close to their estimate. As per their agreement, Pete Hoskings and Jerry's shares were credited. Harry withdrew a thousand pounds in cash and got a draft for the rest in New York, exchangeable for London. He then bought two horses, rifles, and revolvers. He gifted one set to the chief and the other to Hunting Dog. The Indians were thrilled. Harry gave them papers for the horses and advised them to keep their revolvers handy. The next day, they started east by train, carrying a substantial amount. In five days, they reached New York and sailed to England. They arrived in Southampton, surprising Harriet. Tom had changed a lot, having grown taller and tanned from hard work. Harriet and Carry were delighted to see them and eager to hear about their adventures.|"['1.
