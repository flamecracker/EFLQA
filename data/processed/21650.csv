In London Town, the toyman sings his song, selling toys to kids who pass along. A spider, a bat, a baby doll that cries, all catch the youthful passerby's eyes. Orange-girl Kitty sells fruits high and low, rain or shine, always on the go. Blackbird sings on Chimney Sweeps' Day, feathers as black as soot, piping away. Ducks and swans share a bun, a feast for all, a polite drake's call. Westminster Cloisters, old and grand, with gables glowing in the sun's warm hand. Kings and poets rest in peace, their stories in history never cease. Baby Bunting makes a fuss, at the Museum with siblings, he causes a ruckus. To the Zoo we go, with Bertie and Sue, seeing pelicans, penguins, and monkeys too. Laughing at the animals, unique and rare, a day of wonder for all to share.|"['1.

"Don't forget to visit the Zoo! See the bear climb up the pole for a bun treat. He's a funny old bear with thick paws and a big appetite. Watch him snap up the bun in a red trap. He loves his buns! In the morning, children wake up to cries of ""Milk o! Milk o!"" The muffin man from Drury Lane sells delicious muffins. Street Arabs are now proud members of the Shoeblack Brigade. The Mayor and Aldermen feast at the Guildhall with fine wine and turtle soup. Two giants, Gog and Magog, guard the Guildhall. A man in the street calls out ""Meat, meat!"" to feed dogs, cats, and kittens. The Foundling Nursery cares for babies in need. The Embankment holds Cleopatra's Needle, a stone from Egypt.
