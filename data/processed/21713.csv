Kate, the main speaker for sensitive matters, addressed Captain Bream candidly. Initially intimidated by his size and deep voice, they now appreciate his kindness and wish for him to stay, with a rent reduction. Captain Bream, known for honoring agreements, agreed but insisted on the original rent. He shared his warmth despite his size and mentioned his bear-skin coat for extreme cold. To their amusement, he demonstrated the coat's unique features, including attached mittens and a hood. Despite his unintentional chair mishap, Captain Bream's jovial nature and readiness to share made the room lively. Jessie insisted that he join them in the evenings, noting his late-night activities and lack of a fire.

""Hey! Bring a cloth, Liffie,"" thundered the captain from his room. ""Don't worry, ladies, just spilled the washbasin. It's tin, nothing broke. Hurry up, or the water will leak through the planks.""

Soon, the trio sat for dinner. The captain, with reverence, blessed the food. He then reached out his hand to Jessie and Kate, a gesture of affection. The meals were now hearty, a stark contrast to the past light fare.

Initially, an agreement was made to keep a record of expenses and for the captain to pay for a third of the food consumed at the house. However, the captain ate significantly more than the sisters, leading to a dispute. Eventually, he insisted on paying for all the food, except for his daily post-dinner coffee.

"On the fishing boat, the crew consisted of Joe Davidson, the mate, Ned Spivin, a strong man with a massive upper body, Luke Trevor, a handsome and agile young man, and John Gunter, a sour-faced and surly individual.

While the crew of the _Evening Star_ chatted, a light breeze picked up, and Billy noticed the admiral's boat sailing to the east into the wind. As the breeze reached the fleet, all the boats followed the same path, creating a line of nearly two hundred boats trailing behind the admiral. The smooth sea was now rippled with indigo waves. The fleet was heading to a fishing area before nightfall, aiming to turn back and sail with the wind at night, dragging their nets across the fish-rich banks. Night fishing is preferred due to fish possibly not seeing the nets well or being more likely to sleep at night. Around ten o'clock, the admiral signaled a stop, and the crew prepared to lower the massive fishing net into the twenty-five-fathom deep sea. The crew worked with vigor under the bright moon and lantern light, carefully maneuvering the heavy net and gear. Night fishing trips can be quite profitable, ranging from 10 to 27 pounds for a single night and up to 280 pounds for an eight-week trip.|"[""1.

The hardy sailors on deck enjoyed fresh air during their long hours at sea. Zulu, a jovial cook, served a hearty meal of soup, tea, fish, and biscuits. Conversation paused as they ate, balancing their bowls on the rolling ship. Joe, a sailor, preferred blessings over curses, noting the discomfort of chafed wrists from the hard work. The men heaved at the capstans to lift heavy loads from the sea, some using steam-power for relief. Zulu praised the ladies for providing wrist cuffs that prevented sores. The skipper encouraged the men as they worked, with David Bright advising his son Billy to control his excitement. Billy's eagerness to help with the catch of fish showed his jovial and energetic nature.|"['1.

At this point, the crew had successfully secured the heavy beam to the vessel's side, pulled in most of the net, and hoisted the bag filled with a variety of fish and debris above the surface. The skipper then instructed the men to lift the bag using a block and tackle system. As the heavy load rose, resembling a balloon, it was carefully swung inwards and secured on the vessel. Despite the physical exertion and occasional spray of water, the crew managed to avoid any losses. Luke Trevor was tasked with releasing the fish from the bag, with Billy and Ned Spivin eagerly watching. A playful rivalry between Billy and Spivin led to a comedic mishap where fish spilled over the deck, causing laughter among the crew. As they prepared for another round of fishing, the crew sorted and cleaned the caught fish, a task made more challenging during harsh winter conditions.

Busy activity ensued in the Short Blue fleet as the carrying-steamer approached, signifying a return to London soon. The fishermen rushed to haul trawls, clean and pack fish, launch boats, and trans-ship them quickly due to the perishable nature of fish. Fast steamers run between the fleets and Thames to transport the fish, preserving them with ice. The vessels near the admiral rush to load their fish onto the steamer swiftly to ensure they reach the market promptly. The _Evening Star_ was close to the admiral when the steamer arrived, prompting them to pack the catch with speed. Billy helped pack trunks with different types of fish, ensuring they were labelled correctly. As the fleet converged, vessels crowded together, friends greeted each other, and collisions were narrowly avoided with skilled maneuvering.

A crew member named David Bright joined them, warmly welcomed by all. The crew secured the boat and prepared to hold a service below deck. The fishermen, genuine and eager, filled the hold which had been cleared out. They sang with powerful voices, some tuneful, others not so much, but the enthusiasm was contagious. The heartfelt singing moved even those on deck. A simple prayer, reading, hymn, and a sermon followed, emphasizing that anyone, no matter their past, can find salvation through Jesus.|"[""1.

Fear not, dear reader, we do not plan to give you a sermon with a nautical theme. Our goal is to provide you with a genuine glimpse of life on the North Sea as we have observed it. Just as it would be a mistake to exclude the darkest shadows from a painting, it would be wrong to leave out the brightest highlights, even if you may not recognize them as such. The preacher's talk was brief, but his passion was evident. The audience reacted differently, with most showing deep sympathy, listening intently. Some initially wore cynical expressions but softened as the preacher discussed spiritual matters. On deck, Gunter and his companions were intrigued by the sermon and listened attentively. Afterward, hymns were sung, prayers were said, and advice was given, including a warning about the dangers of excessive drinking. The skipper emphasized the importance of avoiding the slippery slope of alcoholism and encouraged the young men to sign a temperance pledge. He explained that true temperance comes from trusting in a higher power and seeking help when faced with temptation.|"[""1.

Since that day, more ships have joined the Mission fleet, which now, in 1886, has five smacks. It is expected to grow in number, all supporting themselves while aiding the Mission cause. However, these vessels do not fully meet the needs of the North Sea fleets. Many men and boys in these fleets do not benefit from the Mission ships as they are not yet attached to them. The hope is that generous Christians will provide funds to expand these efforts. Just as like-minded individuals gather on land, at sea, men like Johnston, Moore, Jim Frost, David Bright, and others find themselves drawn to the mission ships for meetings and companionship. In a nearby incident, the Swab, also known as Dick Herring, trades fish for alcohol at a floating grog-shop, leading to a spree that involves intense discussions and eventually escalates into quarrels.|['1.

Ned noticed a breeze from the south, hinting at the need to get Ruth's father, David, aboard. Billy knew it wouldn't be easy; David loved cards and drink, making him hard to move. Despite Billy's attempts, David resisted. The breeze and a mishap finally prompted David to go on deck. The sky darkened, the sea grew rough, and the _White Cloud_ swayed. Drunk, David tried to steer but failed. He fell overboard and sank. The crew sobered and searched but found nothing. The visitors left in silence. Ruth welcomed Captain Bream, seeking his help but found scheming troublesome. Bream advised her to be direct. Ruth valued Bream's loyalty and insights. She justified her schemes, surprising Bream. Despite the inconvenience, Bream obeyed Ruth's urgent summons to an unfamiliar part of the city, eager to assist.|"[""1.

Finally, the fishermen saw the end of their hard work as the bridle was pulled aboard. The crew, filled with hope, felt a surge of excitement. With all their strength, they turned the capstan to bring up the massive forty-eight-foot beam. As the net emerged, it was evident they had a bountiful catch, but disaster struck. The rope holding the fish snapped, and the entire haul sank back into the sea. A moment of silence followed the loss, broken only by John Gunter's outburst. Despite the setback, David Bright praised John's skill, though a drunken argument ensued. Luke suggested seeking help from the mission-ship for cheaper supplies, leading to a physical altercation.

Luke hesitated. Immediately, the angry captain hit him in the chest, knocking him down. Seeing Gunter's drunken grin, the captain threw his drink at him and lunged. Gunter, rising but stumbling, caused the captain to miss and fall. Gunter quickly got up, ready to fight, while the captain lay stunned. Luke helped Gunter and Billy lift the captain. They struggled due to his weight, but with the Coper's owner's help, they managed. Luke bandaged the captain's minor wound, but he remained unresponsive. Billy, distressed, wanted to get him on board. Gunter, sobering up, tried to help the captain. Eventually, they safely moved him onto the boat.

John Gunter treated everyone in the room, including some struggling women, to drinks. Amidst the chaos, a burglar picked Gunter's pocket while the clerk and parson were preoccupied. The burglar then pretended to check the weather, hid the stolen goods, and returned to deceive Gunter. A fight broke out between the two men, causing a commotion. The police intervened to separate them. The burglar denied the theft, and Gunter, unable to find his money, left in a bad mood. Walking alone, Gunter wrestled with his conscience but dismissed it. Meanwhile, Ruth, feeling anxious, encountered Gunter. Despite her initial fear, she tried to offer him money, only to realize she had left her purse at home.|"[""1.

After escaping a frightening encounter, Ruth rushed home, her heart pounding with fear. She burst through the door of the Miss Seawards' house, seeking safety. Breathless and trembling, she recounted being robbed by a gruff sailor who had taken her father's precious silver watch. The watch held sentimental value, given to Ruth by her late father. As she shared the watch's history with the ladies, they listened with morbid fascination. The women, including the curious Liffie Lee, were drawn into the suspenseful tale. With the streets dark and deserted, they felt like burglars as they attempted to open the stubborn lock to their home, fearing to wake their landlady. Finally, with a mighty effort, Liffie managed to unlock the door, causing a loud noise that startled them all.|"[""1.

It was not impossible to spot two intensely black cats in a corner, their tails and backs forming a moorish-arch shape, emitting low thunder-like sounds. Relieved, the group stepped out onto the street, unnoticed by the enraged felines. Rushing to the Dotropy residence, the three elegant ladies tripped lightly but swiftly, with Ruth leading the way. Upon reaching the door, they hurriedly pushed Ruth inside, creating a commotion that caught the night watchman's attention. As they fled, the cats became brave, screeching loudly. Startled, the sisters tumbled over each other into the passage, where Liffie quickly shut the door on the bewildered policeman. Captain Bream, leaving behind the Miss Seawards and his theological studies, headed to the city's bustling business district. After dropping a penny for the monkeys, he entered a dim room cluttered with tin boxes and documents, meeting a lawyer with a sharp eye and a Roman nose. The lawyer, accustomed to investigating with limited information, cautioned the captain not to be too optimistic about finding a woman matching a vague description. Despite the challenges, he hinted at a potential breakthrough if only they knew the woman's husband's name.|"['1.

Two men engaged in a lively conversation as they sailed towards a distant ship, forming a close bond. Captain Bream, despite his age, was spirited and eager. However, a mishap occurred when he slipped while attempting to board another vessel. The boatman tried to catch him but failed, and the captain fell into the water. Determined, he made a second attempt and successfully boarded the ship. Meanwhile, the missionary interacted with the crew. The captain's wet clothes were dried, and they continued towards the emigrant ship. Concerned about finding his lost sister, the captain faced challenges due to the ship's size. The missionary suggested distributing literature to search for her discreetly. The deck was chaotic with families bidding farewells, passengers searching for belongings, and crew members giving instructions. Amidst the commotion, the captain embarked on a mission to find his sister.|['1.

"""We don't need to mind that bell, having our boat alongside,"" said the missionary to Captain Bream, as they stood a little to one side silently contemplating the scene. ""You see that smart young officer in uniform, close to the cabin skylight?""

""Not so young as he looks,"" returned the other. ""I shall have to get his permission before attempting anything on board, so we must wait here for a few minutes. You see, he has gone into his cabin with the owners to have a few parting words. While we are standing you'll have one of the best opportunities of seeing the passengers, for most of them will come on deck to bid relatives and friends farewell, and wave handkerchiefs as the tug steams away, so keep your eyes open. Meanwhile, I will amuse you with a little chit-chat about emigrants. This vessel is one of the largest that runs to Australia.""

""Indeed,"" responded the captain, with an absent look and tone that would probably have been the same if his friend had said that it ran to the moon. The missionary did not observe that his companion was hopelessly sunk in the sea of abstraction.""Yes,"" he continued, ""and, do you know, it is absolutely amazing what an amount of emigration goes on from this port continually, now-a-days.

During his journey, Captain Bream remained focused on his main goal. He distributed gifts while scanning the faces around him intently. The captain, somewhat absent-minded, mistakenly offered his gifts only to women at first. After some humorous and caustic remarks about his appearance, he realized his mistake. Despite the chaos on the lower deck, he persevered in searching for his sister by gazing at every woman's face. Although he often saw the same faces repeatedly due to the crowded ship, he kept hoping to find her. Exhausted and disheartened, he was about to sit down when a female voice interrupted him. Hopeful, he approached a fair-haired woman with gentle eyes, hoping she might be his sister.|"[""1.

In a moment of disaster, the brave fishermen did not back down. With all their strength, they rushed to the boat, which had been lifted but not carried away. Skillfully, they got it back in the water. Ned and Gunter jumped in, while Joe held on. Billy called out to his father, who remained at the tiller guiding the vessel after it had been lifted off the sand. A massive wave hit the boat, washing everything away and overturning it. The crew struggled in the water. Onshore, people saw the distress and quickly acted. A young man, seemingly a landsman, joined the fishermen in the rescue. The crew fought to reach the shore.

The fishermen helped him, some eagerly, some uncertainly, a few with disbelief. The young man persisted with unwavering patience, aware that half-drowned people can be saved with effort. Walking along the shore, he spotted a man's body washed up by the waves. Rushing to the scene, he and the fishermen carried the man to safety. Despite their efforts, the man could not be revived. Joe Davidson, who had been saved earlier, rushed to the scene and recognized the man as David Bright. His wife, Maggie, was filled with dread upon learning the news.

Ruth discovered the news of a shipwreck and its aftermath in a mysterious way. She had a unique ability to sense human suffering and was drawn to it instinctively, much like her namesake from the past. Ruth felt compelled to inform Captain Bream about her suspicions regarding Mrs. Bright, but her mother, Mrs. Dotropy, insisted that it was not the right time due to Captain Bream's recent illness. Despite Ruth's initial eagerness to act, she eventually agreed with her mother's decision to wait. Ruth shared details of the shipwreck with her mother, mentioning that the fisherman, Joe Davidson, was safe. A policeman informed Ruth about the incident and praised the positive impact of the Mission vessels on the fishermen. Ruth and her mother discussed the bravery of policemen, leading Ruth to assert that admiration for a courageous man does not equate to romantic feelings.

Ruth, deeply moved by the recent shipwreck, sat down with pen and paper to write about the _Evening Star_ disaster. Her emotions fluctuated from joy to sorrow as she detailed Mr. Dalton's heroism and Mrs. Bright's grief. John Gunter, still reluctant to believe in the value of mourning over revelry, was touched by the tragedy but not yet convinced of its lessons. Despite this, the community gathered around the grieving widow, offering quiet sympathy and reminiscing about happier times. Mrs. Bright, grateful for their support, expressed her deep sorrow, while Billy shared news of a generous donation that would enable them to purchase a new boat.

A boy, excited by news, offered his hand to Gunter, who agreed to join him. Joe mentioned selling tobacco cheaper on mission ships than on copers. This strategy helps keep sailors away from buying harmful spirits. The mission incurs expenses but benefits sailors. The Swan, a ship lent by the Admiralty, provided a sense of home for sailors.

Everyone consented, and Joe, as the former mate of the _Evening Star_, took the lead in reading a comforting passage about God's promises. They all knelt in prayer for comfort and blessings. Captain Bream, who was unwell and had lost weight, was surrounded by Miss Seawards as he lay on a sofa. Despite his physical decline, his spirit remained cheerful and loving. Kate, deeply moved by the captain's condition, shed tears. She was comforted by the captain's kind gestures and humor. Jessie suggested a trip to Yarmouth for the captain's recovery, but he expressed a longing for the sea instead.|"[""1.

This morning, I received a letter about a trip to the North Sea on a mission ship. The chaplain recommended me for this opportunity, but Kate, my friend, was upset as I am still recovering. Despite this, I was eager to join the mission. During a meal with the captain, he ate voraciously, surprising everyone with his appetite.

"Captain Bream, now on the path to recovery after a long journey through illness, felt the welcome embrace of health returning. The once frail and weary man had started to regain his strength. His cheeks were fuller, his eyes brighter, and his overall appearance healthier. He had reached a point where he could finally rest and let others take charge. With a sense of peace, he no longer felt the need to constantly be in control. Instead, he found solace in listening to others, observing his surroundings, and simply enjoying the serenity around him.

As he contemplated his journey back to health, Captain Bream engaged in a conversation about the fleet's admiral and the importance of having a capable leader. He shared anecdotes about ungodly admirals who disrupted the fleet's peace on Sundays, emphasizing the value of a leader who uplifts the spirits of the crew for better productivity.

"""Yes, I know that,"" said the captain. ""I've worked with many men, and Christian sailors are usually more reliable than non-believers because they work diligently, as the Bible says, 'unto the Lord and not unto men.' Have you heard of General Havelock?"" ""That's the man,"" replied the captain. ""I've heard that when soldiers were needed for special duty and most were drunk, the commander-in-chief asked for Havelock's men, saying they could be trusted.

Once again, a similar scene unfolded, resembling one described earlier, but this time, the commotion was to acquire empty boxes. Most of the fish had been taken by another ship that day, and the new arrival was waiting for the next day's catch. The deck was soon overrun with rough and rowdy men, surprising Captain Bream, who had expected friendlier sailors. The air buzzed with rough language and hints of aggression. The mate noted that despite their rough exterior, many had transformed into devout Christians due to the gospel-ship's influence. As preparations for night fishing began, the captain decided to wait on the mission-ship, grateful for the peaceful respite on the sea. The next day, the smacks with Bethel-flags gathered for Sunday service, including the admiral of the _Evening Star_, catching Captain Bream's interest.

The moral of the story is that even though you can lead someone to the right path, they must choose to follow it themselves. In this tale, Joe Davidson tried to guide John Gunter towards the gospel, but Gunter was reluctant. Gunter's guilt over stealing Ruth Dotropy's watch weighed heavily on him, and he struggled with the temptation to trade it for rum. Despite his resistance, the message of salvation reached Gunter through unexpected means, stirring his conscience. The captain's words about stealing struck a chord with Gunter, leading him to consider his actions. Eventually, the truth came to light when Captain Bream recognized the watch as belonging to Ruth's family. Gunter's internal turmoil and the captain's intervention highlight the power of moral lessons and the impact of our choices on others.|"[""1.
