"Little Mabel Blake exclaimed, ""Oh, how red your nose is!"" when her brother Hal dashed out of the schoolyard after playing with his friends. Mabel eagerly waited for Hal to walk home with her, as he had promised. Jennie Bruce chimed in, ""All our noses are red today! It's the cold weather."" She expressed her love for winter, anticipating snow and ice. The children chatted about how a steam engine works, with Mabel explaining the role of hot water turning into steam to make the engine go. Despite the chilly weather turning their noses red, the children happily ran home, knowing the warmth of the house would soon fade the redness. Mamma Blake called for help to bring in the flowers before a frosty night, and even Roly-Poly, the poodle, tried to assist, causing a bit of chaos in the process."|"['1.

"""Mamma Blake told Roly-Poly that the ground would soon be too hard to dig in. She called the children to wash up for supper as it was getting dark. Daddy Blake would make the fire hot for the cold night. Hal and Mab were eager about a new secret their father mentioned.

Hal and Mab lived in a city with their family, including Aunt Lolly and Uncle Pennywait. Uncle Pennywait was known for giving them pennies to buy lollypops. They also had a funny poodle named Roly-Poly who liked to hide things. One day, Daddy Blake explained to them how cold makes things shrink and heat makes them expand. To demonstrate this, he decided to freeze water in a bottle overnight. Hal and Mab were excited to see if it would freeze by morning. Even though they were sleepy, they wanted to stay up. However, their mother tucked them into bed, and Daddy Blake prepared the furnace and revealed a shiny surprise from a package he brought home.|['1.

"""Daddy Blake explained to the children at breakfast that heat makes things expand and cold makes them shrink, but freezing cold can make water expand, turning it into ice. He shared a story about a bottle of water that froze overnight, causing the ice to push against the sides and break the glass. This phenomenon of ice expanding when frozen is fascinating. He also mentioned how milk bottles are opened slightly in cold weather to prevent them from cracking when the milk freezes and expands. The children learned that ice's ability to swell can even split rocks. Daddy Blake hinted at a secret involving ice and mentioned taking the kids skating. Meanwhile, Roly-Poly, their pet dog, tried to play with Hal's package, showing his playful nature."""|"['1.

"""No, it's not too serious!"" called Daddy Blake when he saw the burst water pipe. ""We need to call the plumber. Wait until I turn off the water, then you can come down. It's like a shower now."" Roly-Poly, the chubby poodle, got tangled in Hal's legs and they tumbled down the steps like a pumpkin. Luckily, they were unhurt due to their plumpness. After the commotion settled, Daddy Blake inspected the burst pipe. With skates in hand, he led Hal and Mab to a frozen pond.

Hal and Mab watched as their little poodle dog, Roly, tried to dig in the hard ice, looking for something to bury. The frozen ground made it impossible. Suddenly, a crack in the ice appeared, and Roly slipped into the cold water below. The children were devastated, but something miraculous happened to Roly under the ice. It's a secret for now, but you'll find out at the end of the story. Don't peek ahead, though! Just like Hal and Mab, wait patiently for the surprise that awaits Roly.|"[""1.

"""Wait, don't go,"" said Mr. Blake quickly, but there was no need. As soon as Hal released his Daddy's hands, his feet, still in the slippery skates, slid out from under him, and down he went again. Mr. Blake instructed Hal and Mab to stay together in a safe spot on the thick ice. Slowly skating towards where Roly-Poly had fallen, Mr. Blake noticed the ice cracking again and skated back. Daddy Blake comforted Hal, explaining about air holes in the ice due to moving water beneath. Later, Daddy Blake created holes in the ice for fishing, using wire hooks with bells and red cloth to signal a catch. The family then baited their hooks and awaited a tug from a fish beneath the frozen surface."|['1.

"""Skating on a frozen lake can be so much fun,"" exclaimed Daddy Blake as he watched his children glide gracefully on their sharp steel skates. ""Remember, if you feel like you're going to fall, just let yourself go naturally. It's important not to strain and try to prevent a fall, as you might hurt yourself more. Just go with the flow!"" he advised.

As they skated, Daddy Blake explained to the children how their hearts pump blood just like a steam engine needs coal to run. ""Our blood is like the engine's steam. When we move fast, our heart pumps faster to supply more blood to our muscles, making us warmer, just like rubbing your finger fast warms it up.""

After a thrilling day on the ice, they enjoyed hot chocolate and sandwiches by a cozy fire. Daddy Blake promised more skating days ahead to help the children become good skaters."|"[""1.

"Hal and Mab set off on their race evenly matched, with neither ahead. They had learned to skate fairly well, though not very fast or far. They couldn't do fancy moves like the grape-vine twist. In races, everyone wants to win, but it's important to be fair and not get in the way of others. If you don't win, be cheerful and congratulate the winner. Hal let Mab start a bit ahead this time, called a ""handicap."" They planned a winter picnic at the big lake, taking skates and lunch. The Blakes were busy preparing food. Charlie and Mary Johnson joined for the skate. Despite the cold and cloudy weather, the children were happy skating on the frozen lake."|['1.

Once, Charlie sat on the ice to adjust his strap with a knife. The knife slipped, sinking into the ice. Charlie shared a tale of men at the North Pole with frozen molasses. They used a hatchet to chop it. One day, a man left the hatchet in the molasses, which melted, trapping the tool until spring. The children laughed, then skated races. Daddy Blake led them to see how ice is cut and stored. The ice was thick, allowing a man to ride on a chunk. Charlie compared it to a polar bear on ice. The foreman explained the process of cutting ice when it's thick enough, marking it into squares before cutting. They used a horse-drawn marking machine with sharp spikes.|['1.

The foreman explained the importance of cutting the ice into uniform blocks to efficiently stack them in the ice house. He likened it to how neatly you can stack blocks in a box. The ice blocks are cut with saws or sometimes marked deeply to break them evenly. The separated ice blocks are then floated to a dock and carried into the storehouse. The storehouse is accessed through a long incline with an endless chain carrying the ice up. Men use hooks to slide the ice onto wooden platforms, stacking them up to the roof. The cold mist from the ice made it hard to see the workers stacking the ice. The clattering sound of the ice being moved echoed through the storehouse, creating piles like an iceberg.|['1.

The foreman explained how the building shields the ice from the sun, keeping it cold. The ice house has double walls filled with sawdust to prevent heat from getting in and cold from escaping, acting like a refrigerator. Hal asked how they retrieve the ice in summer, and the foreman showed them how it's loaded onto freight cars through a passage with a railroad track. The ice is then transported to the city. Daddy Blake mentioned natural ice, formed by nature, and artificial ice made using machinery. He described the complex process of making artificial ice with tanks, saltwater, and ammonia. Daddy Blake suggested heading home, leaving the children fascinated by the ice storage and creation process.|['1.
