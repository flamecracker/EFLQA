As they neared the crossing, the daughter asked her father to pause. She cherished him deeply, willing to risk her life for him. In a strange turn of events, she swiftly stepped on a loose rock, causing it to collapse with her on it, leading to her tragic death. The father, teary-eyed, remembered her words about Jesus sacrificing for us, realizing his immense love for her and Jesus. Overwhelmed, he knelt and prayed for mercy. Would the daughter regret sacrificing for her father in heaven? The father, deeply touched, couldn't help but love his daughter even more. Yet, he pondered if it was more wicked not to love Jesus, who sacrificed infinitely more for humanity. A young girl, after reciting prayers, reminded her mother to care for her soul.

In a dim alley in New York City, a young, ragged boy, around twelve years old, looked worn and weary. The chilly air cut through his tattered clothes, leaving his skin blue and nearly frozen. Once happy, his parents passed away a year ago, leaving him alone and penniless. Struggling to survive, he sold newspapers to make ends meet. On a particularly tough day, feeling defeated, he collapsed in the alley. A group of boys approached, suggesting he seek shelter at the lodges for a few cents. But he could only whisper that he felt strange and saw angels beckoning him to heaven. With those words, the boy passed away. The next day, passersby discovered the frozen newsboy, prompting a wave of empathy and a proper burial.

"God often uses children to bring adults to Christ. Children have a strong faith and trust that God answers their prayers. The Bible says, ""All that ye ask in my name, believing, that ye shall receive."" As time passed, I strayed into sin, but my young son Donald, through his prayers and faith, led me back to God. Despite my sinful life, Donald's unwavering belief in God's power and his prayers for me touched my heart. One night, after a drunken party, I found Donald on his knees, tears streaming down his face, praying for me. His love and faith moved me deeply. On September 15th, after a prayerful group asked for my salvation, I found myself at the altar, with Donald by my side, praying for me. God answered our prayers, and I was saved.
