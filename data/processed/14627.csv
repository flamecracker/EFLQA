To get a clear account of the whole affair, Judith decided to seek Blasi's insight since he had been present during the incident. After locating Blasi, she asked him to recount the events from the beginning. Blasi, holding a silver piece from Judith, began his narrative. He described a tense scene where Dietrich, Jost, and a red-haired man were together. The situation escalated during a card game, leading to a physical altercation. Blasi observed the red-haired man inciting the conflict but refraining from direct involvement. When Dietrich fled with Jost's assistance, chaos ensued as the cattle-dealer discovered missing money.
