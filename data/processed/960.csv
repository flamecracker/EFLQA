"In my pocket, I carry a map of Oz,"" the boy insisted. ""It reveals that the Winkie Country, where we are now, is to the west of Oz, and the Munchkin Country is to the east, with the Emerald City lying directly between them."" ""That journey may be risky,"" the boy responded. ""I used to reside near Oogaboo in the Gillikin Country, and I've heard that the northern lands are best avoided. I made sure to steer clear of them during my travels south."" ""Fear doesn't equate to cowardice,"" Woot replied, growing slightly embarrassed. ""Avoiding danger is simpler than facing it. The safest path is the wisest, even for the brave."" ""Don't fret, we won't veer too far north,"" assured the Emperor. ""Our goal is to bypass the Emerald City without straying unnecessarily. Once past the Emerald City, we'll head south into the Munchkin Country, where the Scarecrow and I have many friends.""

"As they ventured deeper into the dense forest, the Scarecrow marveled at the unfamiliar surroundings. The path was obstructed by thick underbrush and towering trees, requiring the Tin Man to clear the way with his axe. The trio stumbled upon a vast clearing, illuminated by a soft, mysterious light emanating from an unseen source.

In the clearing, they encountered peculiar creatures known as the Loons. These beings were round in shape, with puffy bodies, saucer-shaped heads, and purple spot eyes. The Loons were engaged in various activities, but upon noticing the travelers, they swiftly rushed towards them, their soft blows overwhelming the group.

The Loons subdued the travelers and planned to take them to their leader, King Bal, for judgment. The captives were bound with vines and rendered immobile, awaiting their fate in the strange, domed chamber."|['1.

The King, with his purple eyes wide, observed the three prisoners. Panta Loon, advising caution, suggested condemning and perforating them. Despite this, the King's decision was questioned by Panta, who claimed he could have been King himself. Suddenly, Panta Loon disappeared, leaving behind a deflated skin. The lady Loon, Til, repaired the hole in the skin, creating a wart. Observing the prisoners, a Loon pricked the Scarecrow with a thorn, causing no harm. However, when the thorn pricked Woot, he kicked out, bursting his bonds and sending the Loon flying. The King explained that the Loon's pride led to his downfall, emphasizing the importance of humility.|"['1.

During the recent moments, the focus was not on the prisoners. Woot seized the opportunity to free himself by using the sharp edge of the Tin Woodman's axe to cut his bonds. After freeing himself, he picked up a thorn left by the Loon who had stuck it in his leg. Taking advantage of the distraction caused by the Loons watching a pump, Woot pricked three of the Loons with the thorn, causing them to explode. The rest of the Loons scattered in fear as Woot chased them. The group, now free from the threat of the Loons, continued their journey. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were untied, and they decided to let the King Loon, Bal Loon, go free. As they left the clearing, they headed towards Rolling Lands, where they encountered a massive purple stone castle in a cup-shaped valley.|"[""1.

"""I am not expecting to satisfy you, but intend to please myself,"" she declared, ""and my pleasure is to give you new shapes. For, if by chance your friends came in search of you, not one of them would be able to recognize you.""

Her tone was so positive that they knew it would be useless to protest. The woman was not unpleasant to look at; her face was not cruel; her voice was big but gracious in tone; but her words showed that she possessed a merciless heart and no pleadings would alter her wicked purpose.

Mrs. Yoop took ample time to finish her breakfast and the prisoners had no desire to hurry her, but finally the meal was concluded and she folded her napkin and made the table disappear by clapping her hands together. Then she turned to her captives and said:

""Yes; I dreamed it all out while I was asleep. This Tin Man seems a very solemn person ""--indeed, the Tin Woodman was looking solemn, just then, for he was greatly disturbed--""so I shall change him into an Owl.""

All she did was to point one finger at him as she spoke, but immediately the form of the Tin Woodman began to change and in a few seconds Nick Chopper, the Emperor of the Winkies, had been transformed into an Owl, with eyes as big as saucers and a hooked beak and strong claws.

Woot suddenly paused. He was no longer angry; he felt cheerful and playful. Instead of causing trouble, he sat on Mrs. Yoop's shoulder, gently patting her cheek. In return, she smiled and petted him. The Giantess explained that she had added a touch of magic to their transformations to ensure they were content in their new forms. She then introduced Polychrome, a Canary, to Woot, a Green Monkey, Nick Chopper, a Tin Owl, and a Brown Bear that used to be a live Scarecrow.

The Green Monkey was clever and decided to befriend the Giantess to gain her trust. He chattered with her while she worked on her stockings. The Giantess enjoyed the Monkey's company and even patted his head. Meanwhile, the little Brown Bear stayed quiet in a corner, and the Owl and Canary chatted in their bird language. The Owl guided the friends to escape when the Giantess fell asleep. Woot the Monkey used the Magic Apron to free them from the castle, taking the Canary with them. They heard the Giantess's cries as they fled to safety. The Green Monkey ran fast, carrying the bird-cage, while the Tin Owl flew alongside.

Woot had never seen Dragons before, but he knew what they were from tales he had heard. As he sat on the floor, the Dragons stared back at him silently. The Dragons began to argue among themselves, and Woot accidentally disturbed their peace. In a panic, he climbed rocks to the cavern roof, where he cried out ""Open!""

The Tin Owl expressed his reluctance to head south towards the Emerald City, fearing his sad state would be seen by friends. The Canary assured that they had passed the city and were nearing Glinda's castle in the Quadling Country. The Scarecrow, feeling humiliated walking on all fours, longed to break the enchantment. They all agreed to head south and soon entered the Munchkin Country, where the Scarecrow Bear recognized landmarks leading to his friend Jinjur's farm. Jinjur, known for her farming skills and artistry, once helped the Scarecrow Bear by painting a realistic straw-stack to restuff him.

In the Land of Oz, where unique creatures abound, a strange being caught the attention of onlookers. This creature had the head of a Munchkin, with a pleasant face and well-groomed hair. What made it truly peculiar was its long body with twenty legs – ten on each side – allowing it to lie horizontally with all legs touching the ground. Clad in Munchkin attire, the many-legged young man introduced himself as Tommy Kwikstep, living in a hollow tree. His unusual form was the result of a wish granted by a fairy, turning his active self into a multi-legged being. Despite his search for the fairy to reverse the wish, Tommy remained hopeful. The Rainbow's Daughter intervened, casting mystic figures that gradually transformed Tommy back to his original form, leaving everyone amazed at the magical process.|"['1.

The Tin Owl admitted that he would have to abandon his idea of marrying Nimmie Amee due to magic preventing it. Despite the misfortune, he resolved to be content fluttering along by himself if needed.

Jinjur used a broom to chase the intruders, knocking over the Brown Bear and causing chaos. The Green Monkey tried to escape up the chimney but ended up covered in soot. Jinjur, realizing her mistake, apologized and offered her help. Jinjur then proceeded to scrub the monkey clean, much to his dismay.

The Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Woot the Wanderer were leaving the tin castle together. Dorothy, unfamiliar with Woot, was curious about their journey as she saw his knapsack hinting at a long trip. She inquired with Ozma, who was unaware of their plans. Observing them in the Magic Picture later, Dorothy initially had little interest. However, her intrigue grew when witnessing the Giantess, Mrs. Yoop, transforming her friends. Ozma expressed her determination to help them by breaking the enchantments. They decided to head towards Jinjur's Ranch to meet them. Ozma prepared the Wooden Sawhorse to travel swiftly.

"""Who would agree to make the change?"" inquired Ozma. ""Forcing someone to become a Green Monkey would be as cruel as Mrs. Yoop. What good would an exchange do?"" she pondered.

Woot thanked the Tin Woodman and asked about his future plans. The Tin Woodman expressed his intention to continue seeking Nimmie Amee in the Munchkin Country. He believed it was right to marry her now that the enchantment was broken. The Scarecrow supported this decision, wanting to reward Nimmie Amee for her loyalty. They sought Ozma's opinion, who encouraged the Tin Woodman to approach Nimmie Amee and inquire about marriage. The group decided to journey together, with Polychrome joining them. Dorothy wanted to accompany them but didn't want to intrude. Ozma offered to take them in the Red Wagon near the Munchkin forest. They bid farewell to Jinjur and set off on their adventure through the forest, where the Tin Woodman and Scarecrow felt at home.|"[""1.

At night, they camped under trees. The boy ate cream puffs, offering some to Polychrome, who preferred dew at daybreak. Walking on, the Scarecrow paused, recalling meeting the Tin Woodman there. The Woodman shared how he rusted while chopping a tree, saved by Dorothy. They encountered a tin man resembling the Woodman, bearing a sword. The tin man revealed his tragic love story, enchanted by a Wicked Witch. Despite losing body parts, a tinsmith crafted tin replacements. The tin man's love for Nimmie Amee led to a happy ending.|"['1. What did Polychrome prefer to eat at daybreak?\nA) Cream puffs\nB) Dew\nC) Bread\nD) Apples\nE) Cheese', '2.

The day of their wedding was set, and it happened to be a rainy day. Despite the rain, the Tin Man embarked on a journey to find Nimmie Amee. The Witch had been absent, and they planned to elope before her return. As he traveled through the forest, the rain soaked his joints, but he was too focused on his upcoming wedding to notice. Suddenly, his legs stopped moving, and his joints rusted, leaving him unable to move or oil himself. He stood helpless until the Scarecrow, Soldier, and Emperor of the Winkies arrived. They shared their experiences of losing body parts and being rescued by Ku-Klip. They decided to visit Ku-Klip's house, a blue-painted dwelling at the forest's edge, to seek help.

In the land of Oz, the Scarecrow shared a tale about a dried-up old woman who turned to dust when Dorothy's house fell on her. He mentioned that magical arts had kept her alive. The Tin Woodman, exploring a workshop, found a cupboard containing a doll-like head that could talk. The head explained that its memory was hazy after being separated from its body. The Tin Woodman's companions, intrigued, listened to the conversation. Polychrome, a dancing figure, suggested sentimental reasons for wanting to see one's old head.

Old Ku-Klip the Tinsmith arrived and was surprised to see many visitors. He was stout and short, with muscular arms and a long leathern apron. His gray beard almost matched the length of his apron. Ku-Klip had a bald head with ears that stuck out like fans and bright eyes behind big spectacles. He welcomed everyone warmly, curious about their adventures. The group shared their quest for Nimmie Amee, who was supposed to marry the Tin Soldier but was mistreated by the old Witch. Nimmie Amee left to live on Mount Munch after the Witch's demise. Ku-Klip shared that Nimmie Amee took some magic powders and Magic Glue, which he used to mend his finger and the Tin Woodman and Tin Soldier's tin bodies.|"['1.

Ku-Klip, the old tinsmith, recalled how he created Chopfyt using spare parts of Nick Chopper and Captain Fyter. He used a bottle of Magic Glue to assemble the body, combining different pieces to form a complete figure. The process was challenging as some parts were missing, but eventually, he managed to create a decent body with all the necessary components. Ku-Klip affixed legs, one from each of the original characters, and a single arm. He randomly chose a head for the new creation, naming it Chopfyt. However, Chopfyt turned out to be a less than ideal assistant, always hungry and not very skilled. Eventually, Ku-Klip made him a tin arm and bid him farewell as Chopfyt set out to seek adventures. Ku-Klip assured Nick Chopper and Captain Fyter that Chopfyt would not recognize his origins, keeping their secret safe.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat did Ku-Klip use to assemble Chopfyt's body?\nA) Magic Wand\nB) Bottle of Magic Glue\nC) Hammer\nD) Screwdriver\nE) Paintbrush"", ""Question 2:\nWhy was the process of creating Chopfyt challenging for Ku-Klip?\nA) He was missing some spare parts\nB) He had too many spare parts\nC) He had no tools\nD) He was not skilled enough\nE) He didn't have enough time"", 'Question 3:\nHow did Ku-Klip choose the head for Chopfyt?\nA) Randomly\nB) He asked Nick Chopper and Captain Fyter for their opinion\nC) He used a magic spell\nD) He closed his eyes and pointed\nE) He used a spinning wheel', 'Question 4:\nWhat issue did Chopfyt have as an assistant?\nA) He was too skilled\nB) He was always sleepy\nC) He was always hungry\nD) He was too talkative\nE) He was too slow', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Ku-Klip do to improve Chopfyt as an assistant?\nA) Gave him a magic wand\nB) Gave him a tin arm\nC) Gave him a paintbrush\nD) Gave him a new head\nE) Gave him a new body', 'Question 6:\nWhy did Ku-Klip assure Nick Chopper and Captain Fyter that Chopfyt would not recognize his origins?\nA) To keep Chopfyt safe\nB) To keep their secret safe\nC) To make Chopfyt a better assistant\nD) To prevent Chopfyt from leaving\nE) To make Chopfyt forget his past']"|['B) Bottle of Magic Glue', 'A) He was missing some spare parts', 'A) Randomly', 'C) He was always hungry', 'B) Gave him a tin arm', 'B) To keep their secret safe']

The Scarecrow and his companions faced a dilemma when the Hip-po-gy-raf desired delicious straw but was unable to reach it due to a ditch blocking their path. The travelers observed a field of hay on the other side, a suitable alternative to straw. To aid the Hip-po-gy-raf, the Scarecrow selflessly offered to sacrifice his straw for the beast's nourishment. Polychrome, using her fairy magic, mended the Tin Soldier's leg, restoring him to his former strength. With the Scarecrow now stuffed with hay and the Tin Soldier healed, the group prepared to cross the ditch with the Hip-po-gy-raf's help.

As they journeyed towards Mount Munch, the Scarecrow, although a bit awkward, was assisted by Woot and the Tin Woodman. The Land of the Munchkins was full of surprises, and the travelers were uncertain if they had faced all their adventures. Upon reaching a hollow, they found a small blue Munchkin house with fields and a garden. The house belonged to Professor Swyne, known for his skills in cabbage and corn. Mrs. Swyne warned them of the Professor's sharp teeth but eventually welcomed them to the garden. Polychrome and Woot helped the Scarecrow by stuffing him with straw. They decided to spend the night there, and the Tin Woodman and Tin Soldier polished each other, showing their care for appearance. Professor Swyne mentioned that their nine tiny piglets were with the Wizard of Oz for care and education.|"['1.

"""No,"" said the Scarecrow, ""children in the Land of Oz always stay young. The tiny piglets are cuter because they are small."" That morning, the group continued their journey happily. Woot whistled a tune for Polychrome to dance to. When they reached the top of a hill, they saw the beautiful plain below and Mount Munch closer than before. As they walked, they saw a lovely little house near the mountain. The area had no paths but was clear. Suddenly, Woot stumbled, and the others fell over him. They noticed a sky-blue rabbit peeking out of a burrow. The rabbit explained that Nimmie Amee, the house owner, used magic to create an invisible air wall around her home. Polychrome, a colorful girl, impressed the rabbit. The rabbit allowed them to use its burrow, mentioning Nimmie Amee's unfriendliness towards animals. Polychrome easily made herself small to enter the rabbit's burrow."|"['1.

"""I'll go first,"" said the tiny Polychrome, who had shrunk to the size of the others, and she danced into the tunnel without hesitation. A small Scarecrow followed, then the two little tin men. Woot entered the hole, feeling his way in the dark until he saw daylight ahead, signaling the end of the journey. To his thumb-high self, the distance felt like a long walk. As they emerged from the burrow, they found themselves in the vegetable garden, with rhubarb leaves towering like trees. The Tin Woodman, now small, expressed concern about proposing to Nimmie Amee in his current size. Captain Fyter felt the same. The Scarecrow suggested Polychrome make them big again. After being enlarged, they thanked the Blue Rabbit and approached Nimmie Amee's house, eager to see how the adventure would end. Upon entering the house, they found a man in a Munchkin costume, who showed little interest in their presence. Nimmie Amee explained her encounter with Mr. Chopfyt, who reminded her of the tin men before they turned to tin."|['1.

Polychrome, laughing, corrected the group, stating that Chopfyt must be someone else since the tin men were still themselves. Nimmie Amee, calmly, admitted marrying Chopfyt because he resembled them but acknowledged his mixed nature. Despite his flaws, she preferred to keep him due to his training in household chores. The Tin Woodman and Captain Fyter offered to chop him up for her to choose one of them instead. However, Nimmie Amee declined, asserting her choice to keep Chopfyt. The Scarecrow advised leaving to avoid being trapped by the Wall of Solid Air after the storm. They bid farewell to Nimmie Amee and her scowling husband, leaving the house to seek the Blue Rabbit's burrow with Polychrome's guidance.

Polychrome suggested waiting until after the storm to see the Rainbow. She promised to make everyone big again before joining her sisters. Polychrome bid farewell and thanked them for saving her from Mrs. Yoop. She expressed her love for adventures but preferred the sky. As the Rainbow appeared, she joined her sisters, and the group parted ways. They visited Ozma's palace, where they shared their adventures.
