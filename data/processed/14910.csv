Early in the morning, the British ship Carnation tried to attack the Armstrong, but the American gunners fought back fiercely. The Carnation was badly damaged and had to retreat. The British suffered over 300 casualties, while the Americans only had two killed and seven wounded. To prevent the Carnation from falling into enemy hands, Captain Reid ordered the Armstrong to be scuttled, which means making holes in the ship to sink it. Even after the Americans left the ship, the British tried to board it but ended up setting it on fire. The defense of the Armstrong delayed the British squadron's journey to Jamaica, where they planned to attack New Orleans. The delay allowed General Jackson to reach the city and prepare its defense. Captain Reid's ingenious plan to modify the American flag, adding a star for each new state, was adopted by Congress. His bravery at Fayal and Jackson's defense of New Orleans against a powerful British force showed the strength of the American spirit.|"['1.

Once upon a time, a wise man told a story of a master who left his house on a long journey, entrusting his servants with tasks and telling them to be watchful.

The Canadians were aware of Pontiac's plan to attack the English, resulting in a lethal assault known as the 'Bloody Bridge' fight. After the siege was lifted in October, most tribal chiefs sought peace except for Pontiac, who retreated to Illinois. Pontiac was later assassinated in 1769 near St. Louis by an Indian bribed by an English trader. The _Dolphin_ ship briefly anchored at Mackinaw Bay, allowing passengers to explore the fort, village, and a cave where the French were tragically smoked to death by Indians. On their return voyage to Chicago, passengers enjoyed pleasant weather and visited the Lapland family at the Midway Plaisance, where they learned about the unique lifestyle and age dynamics of the inhabitants, including King Bull, who was 112 years old.|"[""1.
