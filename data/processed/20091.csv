James Stansfield orchestrated smuggling activities in Poole and nearby harbors during winter, when the work was most active. The operation involved signaling to boats using light from sand hills. Farmhouses were in on the scheme, and preparations were made for cargo landings. The smuggling was well-organized, with lookout points and coordinated boat departures. The Henriette, a lugger, played a crucial role in the operation, making appearances at various ports to maintain its cover as a trader.

I believe your offer to take Leigh along with you is a deciding factor in your favor. As the children are growing up, if anything were to halt our business, this place wouldn't sustain them all. It would be beneficial for Patsey to have her brother as a companion when you are away. The boy would learn French and gain valuable knowledge in your father's business, which would serve him well. Patsey has given her heart to the young sailor, and the prospect of moving to France is less daunting considering the risks associated with smuggling in their current location. The marriage was held at a small Catholic chapel and later at the parish church, followed by sailing to Nantes the next day.|"[""1.

Two months passed before the lugger returned to Poole, carrying the squire and Polly, who had been warmly invited by Monsieur Martin to visit Patsey at her new home. Patsey was delighted to be in Nantes, living in a charming house in Monsieur Martin's garden. She had her own servant and enjoyed the privacy of her separate abode while also being close to her husband's family. Patsey spent time with Jean's mother and sister when he was away, and Leigh, who was learning business habits, kept her company in the evenings. The squire and Polly stayed with Monsieur Martin, and Patsey's progress in learning French with Jean's family was evident. Jean's absences were short, and he often took Patsey to his estate in the Bocage, a rustic region with unique customs that fascinated her. Patsey appreciated the simplicity and warmth of life in the countryside, contrasting it with the formality of city living.|"[""1.

During the first eighteen months of Patsey's marriage, everything was peaceful. She learned to speak French fluently and could communicate in the local dialect after staying at the country chateau. Leigh, her husband, was adept in both French and English. He often sailed to various French towns and ports, growing stronger and more active. He got along well with Monsieur Martin but avoided his eldest son due to personal dislike. Jacques Martin, Leigh’s brother-in-law, was a stark contrast. Methodical and opinionated, he followed Voltaire and Rousseau, causing tension in the family due to his radical views. Leigh asked Jacques about the commotion at the wharf, and Jacques explained the unrest in France due to heavy taxation and royal extravagance. The nobles had immense power, unlike in England, where they interacted with and cared for their people. The tension in France stemmed from writers like Voltaire and Rousseau who criticized the church and institutions, leading to a loss of faith among the people.|"['1.

Jean was making careful plans to ensure the safety of his family amidst the political unrest in France. He decided to send his lugger to Bordeaux, where a friend would register it in his name to avoid suspicion. With fifty thousand francs in his father's hands, he arranged for the money to be transferred to his account in England. Leigh, facing troubles of his own, was relieved to leave Nantes and become a wine merchant in Poole. Jean's father, initially unconcerned, agreed to send Jean's wife and sister to England if needed.

The plan was set. The club wouldn't meet that evening, so there was no worry about any demands for arrest the next day. A friend, though not agreeing with the club's views, shared what was said there and promised to warn of any threats. To avoid suspicion, preparations were made on the lugger all day. Later, a party left for La Vendee, greeted warmly upon arrival. News spread that the master would stay among them. Tenants visited with offerings, including cider. The next day, they planned to visit neighbors for news. The ride through the wild country was new and unsettling for Leigh, seeing peasants with guns, wary of the unrest. The tension between peasants and authorities over priests' arrests was evident, escalating fears of forced conscription.

Jean Martin and his companion discussed the importance of having few natural leaders among the peasants if they were to rise up against the tyranny of Paris. Having too many leaders would lead to discord and jealousy. They also talked about the need for discipline and the peasants' reluctance to submit to it. Jean expressed his concerns about the events unfolding in Paris and his decision to leave Nantes to avoid imprisonment. He felt compelled to stay in La Vendee to fight against the tyrants in Paris. As the news of the king's execution spread, the region was gripped by horror. Despite the gloom, Jean and his friend found solace in hunting, with game plentiful due to the abandoned chateaux.

During their expeditions, Leigh often visited the houses of the estate's tenants. The peasants, who accompanied them as beaters, welcomed Leigh as the brother of their mistress. They enjoyed his high spirits and his interest in their country. The drawing for the conscription was met with strong resistance by the peasants. Jean expressed his willingness to fight but preferred not to lead. He mentioned other noble gentlemen like Marquis de Lescure and Henri de la Rochejaquelein, who were more suitable leaders due to their military experience. Jean planned to visit Monsieur de Lescure to learn about his intentions for the insurrection. He advised Leigh to observe the peasants' attitude in Saint Florent but not to participate in any potential disturbances. The peasants were determined to fight for their cause and liberty, showing their earnestness in the upcoming war.|"[""1.

Until we are certain of their seriousness, we should not align ourselves with them. If you go to Saint Florent, stay away from where the gathering is. Keep watch from afar. Those going will likely defend themselves, but success depends on a strong leader emerging. The challenge always lies in finding such a leader. If a scuffle erupts, we must watch. It's not our concern now. The journey to Saint Florent was challenging for Leigh. He encountered peasants with weapons heading towards the town. The gendarmes were overpowered, and the peasants claimed victory without violence. A man named Cathelineau introduced himself to Leigh, declaring his insurgent status and the need to combat tyranny.

The conflict has erupted, with Henri de la Rochejaquelein leading the peasants at Clisson. Lescure hesitated to join, wary of endangering his family. Meanwhile, the Chevalier de Charette accepted the peasants' call to arms near Machecoul. The uprising gained momentum, prompting the authorities to struggle with enforcing conscription. The countryside buzzed with activity, as church bells tolled news of rebellion. Cathelineau swiftly seized Tallais, then Chemille, acquiring weapons and cannons. The peasants, armed with pitchforks, rallied behind him. The wave of revolt spread like wildfire, reaching villages far and wide. Foret repelled Republican soldiers at Saint Florent, while Nicholas Stofflet marshaled a force against the National Guards at Maulevrier.

Cathelineau, a respected figure among the peasants, explained to Monsieur de la Verrie that he didn't seek leadership but was trusted by the people due to his understanding of them. Monsieur Sapinaud agreed, emphasizing that the peasants should choose their leaders. Cathelineau believed in the peasants' ability to fight bravely but noted their aversion to discipline. The group, including Jean and Leigh, set off for Chollet, a town loyal to the Convention. The plan was to attack the dragoons and National Guards stationed there. As they neared the town, more villagers joined their ranks. A brief strategy meeting was held, dividing the forces to engage the dragoons and National Guards.

The cavalry, expecting to intimidate the peasants, were surprised when the peasants stood their ground and even fired back. In the ensuing battle, the peasants defeated the dragoons, causing a panic among them. Subsequently, the National Guard also fled as the peasants charged at them. The victorious peasants collected arms, money, and ammunition. Later, they dispersed to celebrate Easter, while Cathelineau sought support from experienced officers. The defeated National Guard from Saumur abandoned their weapons, including a cannon with an image of the Virgin Mary, which the peasants named after her.

He is a determined young woodman, likely to lead the peasants against the Blues with a strong following. Three distinct characters, well-suited as peasant leaders, are discussed. Patsey clarifies that the woodman isn't seeking a general's role but will lead the estate's peasants and possibly those nearby. The desire to assess the situation before rallying the tenants was highlighted. The men inquired about not being taken along, and the reasons were explained. The woodman and his party engaged the cavalry, firing rifles and causing the enemy to retreat. The lack of order among the peasants during the skirmish was noted. The woodman anticipates the peasants adopting better tactics when fighting in familiar terrains. The hope is for Paris to focus on other conflicts rather than sending more troops. The woodman expresses a strong disdain for the Convention and a desire to dismantle it, akin to Guy Fawkes' intentions towards Parliament. Leigh acknowledges the difficulty of executing such a plan.|"[""1.

""Things are going well, Patsey. We are fighting on our own land, and we can call fifty thousand men to arms quickly by ringing church bells. We are prepared to fight without baggage or provisions.""

Jean Martin had come back home. Two days later, he gathered all the tenants on the estate to talk about the importance of having some discipline. He brought a wagon full of muskets and ammunition found at Chollet after most peasants had left. Cathelineau allowed him to take them to arm the peasants near the chateau for the upcoming battle. The peasants took the firearms gladly but refused to fight in any organized way. Leigh, having fought at Chollet and being related to the seigneur, convinced about twenty boys to follow him. The generals chose officers based on qualities like energy and position, not rank.

Remember, the less you store in your barns, the harder it is for an enemy to invade. If they find nothing, they must bring all supplies, making their journey difficult.

Troops may be stationed in villages beyond the town, which may be overcrowded. Your task is to observe discreetly without drawing attention. The goal is to gather information about the number of troops near Thouars, their plans, and movements. Stay hidden even if patrols pass by, as engaging them could alert the enemy. The soldiers passing by seem discontent with their mission, doubting the reliability of some troops. Their reluctance to fight reflects the complexity of the situation.

Three hours after reaching the river, Leigh spotted a group of horsemen descending the slope. He held his fire until they reached the broken bridge, then signaled his men hidden in the greenery to open fire. The enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated, mocked by the peasants. As the enemy regrouped and advanced, Leigh spread his musketeers to match their formation. A fierce exchange of fire ensued, with the defenders taking cover behind trees. The enemy struggled to cross the stream, hesitating at its depth. Urged on by officers, they waded through, only to be met with a hail of bullets. The defenders, reinforced by fresh troops, repelled the attack. A chaotic battle ensued, with the enemy eventually breaking through the barricade, only to be met with a fierce counterattack. The enemy fled in panic as the peasants pursued them, inflicting heavy casualties. The defenders regrouped, maintaining their position and exchanging fire with the enemy across the river. Despite heavy artillery fire, the defenders held their ground, inflicting significant losses on the enemy.

Leigh quickly directed the men with muskets to flank the enemy as the assault began. The peasants fiercely fought back, causing heavy losses among the Blues. After three unsuccessful attacks, Leigh decided they had done enough. He ordered the peasants to retreat through the woods to join Cathelineau. By the time the Blues regrouped, the peasants had vanished, leaving only a few casualties behind. General Berruyer and General Menou realized the peasants' fierce resistance required a much larger force than anticipated to subdue them. The generals acknowledged the peasants' courage and effective defense tactics. Berruyer criticized the Convention's harsh approach and suggested a general amnesty instead. Leigh and his band, unharmed but wounded, reached Chemille with news of their successful defense. The peasants praised the officer's strategic leadership in the battle.|"[""1.

Berruyer did not direct the force at Vihiers to join him. Instead, he planned to head south after taking Chemille to meet Leigonyer at Coron. He stopped near Chemille, rallied the new recruits, scolding those who showed fear, and urged them to be brave. Many were from the Paris force, involved in past violence, but acted cowardly in battle. After meeting Cathelineau and sharing fight details, Leigh wandered the town. Encountering drunken peasants, a former soldier named Jacques Bruno boasted of future wealth. Leigh suspected treachery, considering Bruno's background and lack of interest in the cause. Leigh organized a watch to monitor Bruno's actions. Later, he found Bruno asleep near cannons on a hill overlooking the road Berruyer's troops would use.|"['1.

Berruyer realized defeat was imminent. Despite his efforts to rally the troops and cover their retreat, they were relentlessly pursued by Bonchamp's forces. The peasants joined the battle, overtaking and killing many of the retreating soldiers. Berruyer led his men back to Saint Lambert, losing cannons and three thousand soldiers in the process. The rebels, however, made significant gains, capturing muskets and recapturing lost guns while inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. A council of war at Chemille revealed the grim reality: their ammunition was depleted, and reinforcements for the enemy were expected. The decision to abandon Chemille was made, and the leaders retreated to Tiffauges. The army dwindled, and the officers eventually left the town.

Leigonyer expressed surprise at Leigh's successful tactics against Berruyer's army, despite being younger and lacking military training. Leigh explained his strategic use of the forest to delay the enemy. The young count offered Leigh a spare horse for the upcoming mission. The force swelled to over twenty thousand men, inspired by Monsieur de la Rochejaquelein's reinforcements. Before departure, Leigh dispatched scouts to gather intelligence on Leigonyer's forces. A successful raid on Crilloire was carried out, led by Jean Martin, capturing the chateau and defeating Villemet's cavalry.|"[""1.

Berruyer acted swiftly, sending five hundred men to May, anticipating Leigonyer's arrival. The Vendeans attacked Leigonyer's grenadiers before they reached Bois-Groleau. Despite a valiant defense, the grenadiers were forced to retreat into Vezins. Leigonyer sent two thousand men to aid them but the Vendeans defeated them, causing a retreat. The Vendeans seized barrels of powder left behind in the chaos. Cathelineau, fearing an attack from Berruyer, retreated to May and Beaupreau. The chateau defenders surrendered due to lack of supplies. Berruyer, upon hearing of Leigonyer's defeat, rushed back to Chemille. Leigonyer's troops deserted him, prompting a retreat. The Vendeans conquered Beaupreau, driving the Blues out. Berruyer retreated to Saint Lambert, requesting reinforcements. The invasion failed, with many setbacks for the Blues. Cathelineau advanced on Bressuire, causing the Blues to flee to Thouars. La Rochejaquelein informed Lescure of the Vendeans' strength, prompting a united front against the Blues.|"[""1.

Leigh Stansfield rode with Rochejaquelein during the army's march to Vezins and then to Bressuire. He admired his companion's bravery as they engaged in battle. Rochejaquelein led the charge into Vezins and fought fiercely against the retreating infantry. Despite the peasants' eagerness to pursue, orders from Cathelineau halted the pursuit. Leigh found it challenging to obey orders to halt the pursuit, as he admired the bravery of the retreating soldiers. He acknowledged the difficulty in facing such determined troops and feared the Republic's armies would pose a significant threat. The Vendeans then marched towards Thouars, where Quetineau awaited with his troops. Despite the town's fortifications, Quetineau's troops lacked morale and confidence after repeated defeats. The Vendeans prepared for a fierce battle against the barricaded and guarded bridge at Viennes.|"[""1.

Quetineau, a general, was treated with respect and set free without conditions. He knew his efforts wouldn't save him from the Convention's guillotine. Despite his defense of the town, he faced a mock trial and execution. The Vendeans, led by La Rochejaquelein, faced defeat at Fontenay but regrouped quickly. With the priests rallying the peasants, they returned to fight at Fontenay again. The Vendeans, now called the Royal Catholic Army, advanced in three columns without cannons but with great enthusiasm. They defeated the Republicans, recaptured their beloved cannon, and forced the enemy to flee. The victory boosted the peasants' morale, leading them to return home after the battle.|"[""1.

For now, yes. I wish that the Count de Lescure will join us in a day or two. He will be one of our leaders. He has much power with the country people, and if he can convince them to stay ready for a while, we will attack the enemy. Some of us believe that to win in the end, we must be on the offensive, marching towards Paris. We think we should get Monsieur Charette to come with us, cross the Loire, wake up all of Brittany, and then march, a hundred thousand strong, towards Paris. They say that even though we have been successful so far, the enemy will return with more troops until they defeat us. If Monsieur de Lescure and Henri de la Rochejaquelein help us, we might persuade the peasants that it's better to make one big effort and finish it, rather than being constantly called away from their homes whenever the enemy attacks. We will also tell them that after their two defeats, the enemy will become more aggressive, and that they have been ordered to destroy all villages and cut down all hedges and woods. Once our plans are set, I will send a message to you. Right now, there's no need for you or your scouts, Monsieur Stansfield. They deserve a break after their good service.

The Abbe Bernier, a man of energy and intellect, led the council despite Fontenay's disaster. The Convention was roused, troops arrived, and Biron took command. The town was chaotic, lacking organization, filled with fugitives. Biron struggled with the disarray and the army's unpreparedness. The Vendeans issued a proclamation for parish councils to aid families of soldiers. Land sales from churches were nullified, impacting Revolution supporters. Leigh and his scouts rejoined, preparing to march against Saumur. Rochejaquelein welcomed Leigh, appreciating his light-heartedness amidst the seriousness. They discussed their roles and camaraderie, deciding to address each other informally as Henri and Leigh.

Leigh mentioned that the Vendeans greatly admired Henri and would follow him anywhere. He noted that the Vendeans were serious people and appreciated Henri's differences from them. Henri acknowledged that he was often considered more English than French in appearance and manner. The plan was to head to Saumur, a key location for the Blues. Leigh was tasked to scout the enemy's position near Doue. The Vendeans, led by Henri, attacked the Blues and forced them to retreat. Leigonyer, the Blues' commander, blamed treachery for the defeat and requested to be relieved of his command. General Menou took over. The Vendeans aimed to capture Saumur, where Biron and General Salomon might join forces to defend the town. Scouts were sent to gather intelligence from Thouars to anticipate troop movements.

Leigh gave instructions to split the party, with one half watching Saumur and the other monitoring the road between Tours and Saumur for troop movements. Emphasizing no fighting, they were to assess any unusual activity and report back. Pierre was tasked with gauging the village's allegiance, securing a boat, and relaying messages. Leigh planned to secure a boat from a nearby village, ensuring it wouldn't drift away. The group rested briefly before proceeding with their tasks.

Three or four boats were found by the bank. Leigh selected the smallest one, untied it, and rowed across the river. Upon reaching the other side, he secured the boat and headed towards the road. He then directed one of his companions to observe the road towards Tours. If they spotted a large group of troops, they were to retreat and rendezvous at a village. Another companion was instructed to check for Pierre and the boat at a different location. If Pierre was not found, the companion was to swim across the river using a makeshift float. Leigh and his two other companions, now without weapons, proceeded towards Saumur, passing through a village to avoid suspicion. As they entered the town, they noticed the citizens and soldiers were in a state of agitation, with the town abuzz with activity.|"['1.

Monsieur de Lescure stopped the peasants from chasing the retreating Blues, who left guns and supplies behind. The peasants found the carts and provisions, having breakfast before rejoining Cathelineau's army. Cathelineau, with General Bonchamp, checked enemy positions near Saumur. They felt hopeful of success, unless Biron's Paris brigade arrived. Leigh's description of the garrison's disorder boosted their confidence. Salomon's failed attempt to reach Saumur spread panic. Generals Coustard and Berthier arrived, increasing anxiety in town. Cathelineau's army, informed no enemy troops left Tours, moved towards Saumur. Confusion reigned in town, with new generals unprepared. Vendeans attacked the town, skirmishing fiercely. Berthier's battery caused chaos among the Vendeans. Lescure was wounded, but Vendeans took the faubourg of Fenet. Dommaigne's cavalry clashed with cuirassiers, resulting in casualties.|"['1.

General Menou was deeply involved in the battle, losing three horses. He sent reinforcements to Berthier, but they fled when faced with enemy fire. The line battalions and gendarmes continued to fight, supported by artillery running low on ammunition. Menou and Berthier attempted a cavalry charge, but the troops accused them of betrayal and retreated to the town. The Vendeans took control of the defenders' center works. Coustard tried to hold a crucial bridge but was disobeyed and attacked by his own men. The Vendeans seized the bridge, prompting Coustard to send cuirassiers to recapture it. Weissen led a daring charge, but the infantry broke and fled. The defenders' main force retreated to Angers, leaving the town vulnerable. La Rochejaquelein led a charge into the town, encountering retreating infantry who allowed them to pass. The Vendeans entered the town unopposed as the defenders fled. Cathelineau decided against pursuing in the dark, content with the victory at Saumur. Berthier and Menou covered the retreat, salvaging cannons. The scattered defenders caused panic in Tours and Angers.|"['1.

Charette, a key figure in Vendee, missed a crucial chance to unite with Cathelineau and potentially change the course of events. Despite being pressed by enemy forces, he held his ground but lost the opportunity. The castle of Saumur, still under enemy control, faced a siege by the Vendeans. The townspeople, led by National Guards and other regiments, defended the castle. Eventually, the commandant surrendered, and the garrison marched out peacefully. The victors seized cannons, muskets, ammunition, and prisoners but showed restraint. A council convened to appoint a commander-in-chief, with Cathelineau chosen due to his influence, talent, and honesty. Lescure's proposal was well-received, avoiding potential conflicts among other leaders. The news of an enemy attack on Jean's chateau shocked Leigh and Jean.|"['1.

After breakfast at a small inn, we continued to a ferry, where soldiers were stationed. Upon entering Nantes, we noticed the town's discontent due to heavy taxes and executions.

There have been significant changes in this town recently. A year ago, many believed that the Assembly would bring about positive changes, promising better living conditions for everyone. However, as more and more people were arrested and executed, including ordinary citizens like tradesmen and doctors, the mood shifted. The fishermen and sailors, once hopeful, now try to rescue prisoners and defy the authorities. The town is now under strict control, with spies everywhere, making it dangerous to speak against the government. The situation is tense, with even moderate voices facing suspicion.

He described the cold-blooded nature of Jean's brother and his unwavering support for extreme measures against enemies of France.

Jean and his friend Leigh are planning an escape. Leigh, a resourceful captain, has a group of scouts led by him, ready to help. Jean, knowing the risks, decides to burn some papers and pack money. They discuss the imminent danger and the need for a quick departure. Desailles, recently denounced, is set to join them. The escape plan involves boats and allies. Jean ensures horses are hidden at his friends' places to avoid suspicion. They gather supplies and prepare for the escape.

I wasted no time. I am certain that it will take an hour before anyone joins me; they all love to hear themselves talk too much to end a discussion in less than an hour after the speaker sits down. I hope the boat is nearby because my bag is heavy. It's actually heavier than I thought. I packed everything I didn't want to leave behind until it was full. When I locked it and tried to lift it, I was shocked by the weight. I rang for her and said I was going out, not planning to return until late. She could go to bed whenever she wanted, which I knew would be soon. I was worried someone might recognize me, but luckily, I didn't see anyone. Jean laughed, saying it would be impossible for Monsieur Desailles, the advocate, to drag a heavy bag through the streets. Jules laughed, saying he left that part of his life behind and is now ready for any adventure. Jean took the bag, and Jules felt relieved, like he was walking on air. He had been living in fear and was falling out of favor with the people he knew. He had thought of escaping before but didn't know how. He felt like a boy afraid to jump into the water until someone pushed him in, and he realized it wasn't so bad. He felt free and lighthearted like a boy.

The man explained that the boat they were in was purchased from fishermen from Saint Florent and was suitable for sailing upriver but not ideal for fishing downstream near Nantes. Martin expressed relief that the boat was not local, as it would attract less attention. Their mission was to hide two gentlemen from the dangerous committee of public safety. The man revealed that his chateau was burned, and his wife was held captive by the committee. They planned to rescue them, but it would be challenging due to the prison's strong security. The man suggested using gunpowder to blow open the gate. They needed to be discreet while passing the town to avoid detection.

Leigh proposed a plan to Jean to escape from prison without being discovered. The idea was for everyone to change into peasant clothes bought by their wives to appear as if the attack on the prison was carried out by Breton peasants. Rouget suggested that some men should set fire to the town while others attacked the jail. He also mentioned the possibility of recruiting an artilleryman who might help. However, caution was necessary as some prisoners were spies for the committee. The plan involved secrecy and careful selection of trustworthy individuals. The entire operation would take about two weeks to organize, ensuring that the fishermen's involvement remained unknown.|"[""1.

The news of Cathelineau's progress was confirmed the next day by the return of the boys sent for help. They brought eight to ten men from the estate and reported that la Rochejaquelein stayed in Saumur to defend against Biron while Cathelineau, Bonchamp, and Stofflet marched along the river. Many of Cathelineau's men dispersed, causing concern. Jean lamented the lack of control over the troops. The plan to march on Paris seemed unfeasible. The group planned to keep their intentions secret to avoid betrayal. Tension rose in the city as the Republican forces prepared to defend against the Vendean army. Charette's movement towards Nantes added pressure. The French generals fortified the town, anticipating an attack. Peasants sought refuge in Nantes, and Leigh gathered his group cautiously. Fireballs were readied for strategic use. The plan was to target specific locations without causing harm to civilians.|"[""1.

The sailors were guided to the designated buildings to be set on fire, ensuring no confusion when the signal was given. Only the Martins' stores near the water were chosen for destruction, marking the end of their business. Desailles received updates on the prisoners' list, with Jean's wife already condemned. As the Vendeans approached Nantes, a summons was rejected by General Canclaux. The Vendeans changed tactics to avoid attacking well-defended positions. The sound of firing near Nantes signaled the start of the attack. Jean and Leigh prepared for action, laying out powder barrels and informing their group to be ready.

As soon as all rooms were opened, he and his group quickly left. The streets were bright with fire from Jacques Martin's stores. Gunfire on the wharves signaled troops stationed there. Shouts of alarm filled the town, spreading news of the prison attack. Released prisoners cheered upon reaching safety. They boarded boats and rowed across the river to their country. Some boats drifted downriver, losing people to troops' fire. Plans were made: Jean headed to Parthenay, Leigh to Cathelineau. The boys chose to join Leigh, eager for battle.

More powerful enemies were approaching La Vendee, greater than any the peasants had faced before. Mayence had yielded to the allies, allowing its large garrison of seasoned soldiers to depart after swearing not to fight for the Republic again. The desperate struggle in La Vendee remained unknown outside France. If England had known, they might have sent aid. Unfortunately, the Vendeans' leaders hadn't informed the English government. The Republicans controlled the ports, limiting information flow. Unaware, the allies granted the Mayence garrison lenient terms, enabling them to march towards La Vendee.

Their numbers were small as the notice was brief, only peasants from nearby gathered. Yet, led by Rochejaquelein and d'Elbee, they energetically attacked, penetrating the camp, seizing the headquarters, treasury, and causing chaos among the enemy. Rochejaquelein, in the thick of battle, acknowledged the setback but deemed it a noble one. Despite being outnumbered, victory nearly theirs if not for the enemy's return. Reinforcements were expected in days. On the seventeenth, the French column moved to Vihiers unopposed. A blast signaled an attack on their baggage left behind. Santerre's battalion faced Rochejaquelein's men but stood firm. Later, the main peasant force attacked, causing disarray and retreat. The army faltered, fleeing in panic towards Saumur. The invasion failed as generals rotated, each unsuccessful. The Bocage remained a challenge, testing the French army's mettle.|"[""1.

During the conflict in La Vendee, the Vendeans showed remarkable courage and determination. Despite facing a better-armed enemy, they managed to acquire more firearms and artillery through various means. The Vendeans were driven by a deep love for their homes, which motivated them to fight fiercely even after victories or defeats. They were joined by deserters and foreign cavalry, forming a small but dedicated army. On the other side, the Republicans, alarmed by the insurrection, resorted to ruthless tactics, including plans to poison the population and destroy the region. The Vendeans defended their land using strategic ambushes, taking advantage of the terrain to surprise the Republican forces.

During the conflict in La Vendee, the undisciplined peasants, though outnumbered, triumphed over the well-trained troops. The Convention was astonished by the success of the peasants in driving out the enemy. However, the victory was short-lived as Charette, a key leader, left to continue the fight in the south. Despite the initial joy, the leaders knew the battle was far from over. With a dwindling number of fighting men and scarce resources, the peasants faced immense challenges. The devastation caused by the war left many homeless, with towns in ruins and families displaced. The idea of abandoning La Vendee for Brittany began to take root as a last resort. Amidst these struggles, the death of Monsieur Martin brought a mix of sorrow and relief, as his passing spared his family further hardship, and he found peace in his final moments.|"[""1.

Jean expressed relief at the thought of sharing the fate of their companions. The group spent three weeks discussing their future in the cottage. It was decided that traveling alone would be safer in case of a setback. Jean suggested leaving behind Francois and Marthe to ensure their safety, while taking Francois to join the fighters when needed. Disguises were debated to avoid detection, with Leigh proposing attire of well-to-do townspeople for their journey.

It was decided that Marthe, the nurse, should return to her village. If all went well, she could rejoin them later. In case of trouble, they would send for her. Three people traveling together would not raise suspicion. The nurse wanted to go with them to the army's headquarters. Everyone was fleeing the atrocities committed by the invaders. The roads to Chollet were filled with refugees. Francois led the horse, while Patsey, the nurse, and the child were in the cart. Jean and Leigh rode ahead. The scouts no longer existed; many had fallen in battle. The enemy's columns closed in on Chollet. General Beaupuy's advanced guard was attacked but managed to retreat to Mortagne. The Vendeans were driven back to Chollet. Kleber was also attacked but repulsed the assailants. The Republicans found Chollet deserted and were about to move towards Beaupreau.|"[""1.

The battle started around one o'clock and continued fiercely until nightfall without a clear winner. As a panic spread among the noncombatants, the cry to retreat to the Loire arose. Despite leaders' efforts to reassure their men, the panic persisted. Lescure had fallen, Bonchamp and d'Elbee were wounded, and a sense of defeat loomed. The group, including Jean and Leigh, sought refuge in Beaupreau after a grueling day. Amidst the chaos, news of Westermann's approaching division stirred more fear, prompting a hasty departure.

At Beaupreau, around five thousand Republican captives were guarded. When the defeated Vendeans arrived, the locals wanted to harm them, but Bonchamp, near death, ordered their release. The prisoners were set free and sent off quickly. The Republicans encountered their freed comrades as they marched out of Chollet the next day. The Convention's commissioners viewed the Vendeans' act of mercy negatively. The Vendeans fled to Saint Florent, avoiding the enemy. The Republicans were caught off guard when the Vendeans attacked and captured a post at Saint Florent. The Vendeans crossed the river, facing challenges, and some were massacred by Republican dragoons. The Vendeans sought refuge in the woods, feeling disheartened and sorrowful. They hoped the Bretons would join them for support.|"['1.

After the army's capture of Saumur, had they advanced into Brittany, the peasants would have risen up. However, as fugitives, they were more a caution than a cause of excitement. Jean Martin, his wife, and Leigh discussed their situation. La Rochejaquelein was elected commander-in-chief after Bonchamp's death. D'Elbee was left wounded at a Breton peasant's cottage. They knew their only hope was a British force landing to help them. Unfortunately, England was unaware of the crisis. The Revolution was seen as a result of years of oppression, and a powerful group in England supported it. If England had sent troops to Brittany or La Vendee, Europe's fate would have changed. France's Revolution could have been stopped, saving lives and money. The people of La Vendee bravely fought against France. England's inaction led to the near destruction of the Vendee peasants. Moving north was their only choice due to limited resources. Crossing the Loire was a risky move, and returning would be even harder. The enemy was likely mobilizing to block their return. Their best chance was to march to Laval and prepare for battle.|"['1.

Danican, new to his role, faced resistance from the soldiers who misconstrued his orders. The bridge at Vihiers was vulnerable. A council was held that night, where Westermann expressed frustration at the unguarded heights. Beaupuy's division advanced as planned, but conflicting orders caused confusion.

Kleber, a key figure, emphasized the dire condition of the soldiers, advocating for a complete reorganization before any further military action. The losses suffered were substantial, with thousands of soldiers missing and significant equipment captured by the enemy. Despite their defeat, the Vendeans demonstrated remarkable bravery and military acumen, impressing even Napoleon with their tactics. The Vendeans, content with their success, retreated to Laval for a well-deserved rest.

A large part of the army stayed back in Avranches, leaving behind the artillery. The locals were anxious, suspecting the leaders might abandon them and flee. This caused a lack of vigor as they marched towards Granville. Despite this, they managed to push back a section of the garrison and entered a suburb. The garrison, fortified in a fort with a palisade, held their ground. Lacking the means to breach it, the Vendeans resorted to musket fire but suffered heavy losses due to the garrison's ammunition advantage. Realizing they couldn't take the town, the Vendeans retreated towards Avranches. La Rochejaquelein tried to rally the troops towards Caen, but only a thousand followed.

The army divisions under Muller's command faced chaos due to his drunkenness, allowing the Vendeans a chance at victory. Marceau, unable to restore order, sought help from Kleber. The two generals found the divisions in disarray and decided to withdraw. Despite orders to remain defensive, Westermann advanced toward Dol. The Vendeans attacked fiercely, causing the Republicans to retreat. Kleber, preparing for battle, faced an unexpected flank attack. The Republicans began to flee, with only the grenadiers holding their ground. As the Vendeans pressed on, the Republicans were forced into a rout. Marceau tried to defend a bridge but was overwhelmed. The Vendeans, upon hearing of atrocities committed against their wounded, retaliated by executing prisoners. Despite the victory, the Vendeans faced resistance as they approached Angers, a well-defended city. The Vendeans hoped for a quick victory before Kleber's reinforcements arrived.|"[""1.

The event was a repeat of what happened in Granville. The Vendeans quickly took control of a suburb. Twenty cannons fired from the walls while the Vendeans shot back from the houses. Overnight, some men worked to undermine a wall near a gate. They were interrupted by daylight, and the defenders positioned cannons against them. Discouraged, the Vendeans halted their efforts. When news arrived of the Republican army's approach, they resumed their journey. The following day, Kleber received reinforcements from Cherbourg. The Vendeans retreated, leaving behind exhausted and deceased men, women, and children. Marceau took command temporarily. The Vendeans, except for a few, were disheartened. Many hid their weapons and hoped to find a boat to cross the river. Leigh rode with his sister, while Jean rode with Rochejaquelein. The column changed course due to a strong Republican force at Saumur, heading towards Le Mans. Rochejaquelein aimed to rest his followers before continuing the journey.|"['1.

Even the soldiers were exhausted and weak due to the lack of proper food and the spread of dysentery among them. Jean realized the impending defeat and urged Martin to think of his English family's safety. The group faced attacks but managed to cross the Loir River and capture Le Mans.

During the night, the battle raged on as la Rochejaquelein faced the armies of Brest, Cherbourg, and the west. The Vendean line held strong, forcing the Republican columns to retreat. However, panic spread among the fugitives. In the morning, Kleber's division arrived, relieving Marceau's tired troops and continuing the attack. Despite the fierce resistance, the Vendean forces were outnumbered. As the town fell, Jean Martin planned to flee with his wife to England. La Rochejaquelein commended his decision, stating his duty to remain with his men until the end. Jean, Leigh, and his wife devised a plan to escape to the east, as the west was heavily guarded.

For our safety, we plan to travel across the Loir between Chateaudun and Nogent, then head south via Fontainebleau through Montargis. Passing through Nevers, we aim to avoid suspicion by saying we're visiting friends in Macon. Lacking papers, we'll claim we're from Le Mans, fleeing the Vendeans' capture without time for documents. Speaking French fluently and without accent, we hope to avoid association with La Vendee. As we journey, we may adjust our story. Upon reaching Macon, we'll decide whether to head to Switzerland or Toulon. Remember, Patsey, if danger looms and all seems lost, ride with Leigh without waiting for me. I trust you'll follow this plan, ensuring your safety and that of the child. Let's hope we reunite at Poole, but if separated, we must each forge ahead.|"['1.

Patsey nodded, but after he had gone out she did not lie down, but threw herself on her knees by the couch, and prayed for the safety of her husband. Hour after hour passed. From time to time Leigh returned and, towards morning, told Patsey that it was time that they should mount.

Leigh easily purchased a sailor's outfit and, accompanied by Monsieur Tourrier and a market official, obtained a pass at the mairie without any issues. The pass was approved for Jeannette Martin, her brother Lucien Porson, and her two-year-old son Louis Martin. Opting to travel by water, Leigh sold the horses and boarded a sailing craft down the river. The boat, originally used for transporting goods, now carried passengers due to reduced travel. The voyage was slow but not unpleasant, with stops along the way. Arriving in Havre after six days, they found lodging and learned that the Henriette had sailed to La Rochelle weeks before. The sailors mentioned it was better to check Bordeaux for more information on the ship.|"[""1.

"""I have arranged for our passage, Patsey. She is a fast-looking little craft, with very decent accommodation.

She carries a crew of eight hands; and I have made inquiries about the captain, and hear a very good report of him, and he seemed to me a first-rate fellow.

In the past, few executions occurred, and the moderate party held power. Two months ago, a local rebellion led to chaos. The terror faction took control, arresting council members and other citizens. The guillotine was put to use, targeting wealthy individuals. Citizens with status now face constant risk of arrest. Daily, many are taken away, mainly the affluent. The trials are a sham; the rich are killed for their wealth, benefiting the ruling council and their supporters. The speaker, uninvolved in politics, employs many and owns ships, which shields them from arrest due to potential unrest. To avoid suspicion, the visitor must dress as a privateer's mate.

"The captain joyfully reported, ""She's doing great, sailing at seven knots an hour. I stick to counting knots instead of leagues, just like Captain Martin. The tide adds two knots, so we'll reach the river mouth soon. We're two knots short of our goal. We'll reach the village in five hours. The river mouth is wide; heading south for a couple of miles before turning out to sea hides us. We'll sail inside the islands to Finisterre, then head to Poole.

"The journey to Ushant was uneventful. The French lugger went unnoticed by privateers and British cruisers. The travelers decided to sail towards the Isle of Wight due to the favorable wind. Spotting an English warship, they altered their course to approach it.

""We are English,"" Leigh explained. ""The lugger belongs to my sister's husband or her if he's no more. We are fleeing France with two French companions. My brother-in-law fought in the Vendean war. We aim to reunite at Poole.""

"""I won't keep you any longer,"" he said. ""I hope you have a pleasant trip. It seems you're heading to the Isle of Wight. You should reach there tomorrow afternoon."" The boat sailed back to the lugger, set its sails, and by four the next day, the Henriette passed Handfast Point towards Poole harbor. As they neared home, Patsey grew more excited, pacing the deck restlessly. Leigh, peering through a telescope, mentioned the revenue men on the cliff possibly recognizing them as French. Suddenly, a figure in a distant boat caught Patsey's attention. Leigh hoped it was Jean but didn't want to raise false hopes. The crew cheered as the boat approached, and Patsey, overwhelmed with emotion, stood watching through tears. Leigh's reassurance and the crew's cheer filled her with hope."|"['1.

Patsey reached out to Jean, who had hesitated before sitting back down. He covered his face with his hands until they were just a few hundred yards from the ship.

Upon deciding not to meet at the rendezvous, I avoided hindering your escape with my broken arm. A kind peasant helped bind my injury, and we journeyed away from the army's retreat. He recognized me from a nearby farm and insisted on assisting me, stating that it was his duty. After hiding in the woods, he skillfully splinted my arm using bark and bandages. We survived for days on provisions from his valises. When it was time to part ways, he bought us supplies, and we headed in opposite directions. My journey led me to Louviers, where I sought medical help for my painful arm. I explained to the surgeon that my horse caused the injury, allowing me to find the care I needed.|"[""1.
