After capturing a merchant ship and burying the loot in a closet, the Pirate Queen, Polly, had to assert her authority over Wan Lee, a pirate who rose at an inappropriate time. She sternly ordered him to bed without supper for their misbehavior. Polly's mother interrupted, dispersing the pirate band. Later, Polly contemplated running away, confiding in her nurse about her plan to escape with her favorite doll. During supper, Polly's precocious interest in history led to a confusing conversation with her father. The next day, the children met on a ridge overlooking a beautiful valley, captivated by the mysterious canyon below. The children, including a neighbor named Patsey, enjoyed the picturesque landscape and indulged in their pirate fantasies, surrounded by red earth and white quartz.|"['1.

Patsey dashed off swiftly, his small red feet shaking as he returned with an old revolver and a banana. The group, now united, ate the fruit, their mischievous plan unclear.

Five minutes later, the workers from the Excelsior mine were startled by a rain of stones from the cliffs above. They saw three boys and a girl rolling down the slide towards the chasm. The girl clung to a clump of chimasal, hanging dangerously. The boys tried to help but failed until Wan Lee threw a black rope to save the girl. Laughter echoed from above as the children played.

"The group vehemently shouted, ""No!"" The idea of being near Wan Lee's malevolent spirit without his protective powers was unsettling. ""Please, don't leave!"" Even Polly, shedding a tear on Lady Mary's head, objected to breaking up their circle. ""Go to bed,"" Polly commanded, ""and rest until morning."" The pirates obeyed, succumbing to sleep one by one, worn out or comforted by the cave's coolness. Polly, driven by duty and care, watched over them. As she sat in the shadows, she gazed at the mountain landscape, feeling a mix of loneliness and fascination. She could smell pine trees and bay, hear distant sounds, and see dust clouds from a stagecoach. Unwilling to wake her companions, she pondered her life as a widow with ailing children, lost in her thoughts until they reached a bright, dreamlike place."|"[""1.

"In a round cave with three tunnels branching off, the walls sparkled with quartz and mica, illuminated by candles. Inside were large men with blackened faces, red bandannas, and weapons.

"""Listen,"" he said, in a silence broken only by the soft sucking of candies. ""Years ago, the Red Rovers hid their treasures in a secret cave in this mountain. They used spells to protect it.
