Mr. Lagg was genuinely concerned about the haunted mansion, and Mollie, who initially found the ghost theory amusing, started to see his point. She realized that if the property turned out to be unusable after all the effort Mr. Lagg had put into it, he would be in a difficult situation. The storekeeper urged Mollie to take her time to consider his proposal and discuss it with her family and friends. He feared losing the money he invested if the ghosts didn't leave the place soon. Despite the mystery surrounding the mansion, the girls decided to focus on planning a motor tour first. They discussed the trip, ensuring they had a chaperone for overnight stays. Once ready, they dressed in auto veils, bonnets, goggles, and gowns, with Mollie driving them down Deepdale's main street.

The young law student, representing Mr. Lagg in legal matters, mentioned the old mansion owned by Mr. Lagg and the difficulty he faced selling it to the sanitarium doctors. While unsure about the ghost rumors, the student believed there was an issue hindering the transaction. The students discussed the mystery as they drove on the muddy country roads. They came across a peddler's wagon stuck in the mud, with a boy named Jimmie Martin trying to free it with his horse. Jimmie explained he bought the wagon cheap but underestimated the horse's strength. He took a shortcut to Limeburg for trade but got stuck. The students offered to help, realizing Jimmie was the same boy who helped them before.|"[""1.

"Jimmie contemplated his situation, stuck in the mud with Stamp, his horse. Will suggested using a rope to pull the wagon out. As the auto started, the rope strained, creaking the vehicle, but successfully freeing it. The valley they were in had shadows from the surrounding hills, earning it the name ""Kenyon's Folly."" Suddenly, a strange figure emerged from the bushes, the proprietor of Bennington's Hair-Tonic. He offered his services, though the group suspected he was a fraud.

Mollie looked back at Shadow Valley, where the shadows were growing darker over the deserted mansion, a reminder of past extravagance. The girls found the place eerie, especially with the mysterious peddler in the distance. The discussion turned to the mansion's potential as a sanitarium, though its haunted reputation might deter visitors. As the car descended, the mansion disappeared from view, relieving everyone.

Mollie reassured Cousin Jane, saying they were always careful and not to worry. Despite Mrs. Mackson's nervousness in the car, they continued towards Freedenburg, about seventy-five miles away. Passing through Deepdale, Mollie accidentally splashed a puddle on a youth's shoes, but he took it well. Once out of town, they enjoyed the perfect day, ready for a pleasant journey. They had lunch with them and planned to stop at noon. Mr. Lagg shared a ghostly tale about doctors hesitating to take a haunted place. He admired the girls' courage, hoping they could solve the mystery. The girls were unfazed, recalling their bravery on Elm Island, ready for any challenge.|"['1.

The girls continued their journey, enjoying the ride to the fullest. Shortly before noon, they encountered a flat tire and decided to deal with it after a lunch break near a spring by a large oak tree. Fortunately, luck was on their side as a kind chauffeur passing by offered to help them change the tire. The girls accepted gratefully, observing his expertise. Despite offering payment, the chauffeur declined, leaving the girls impressed by his honesty. As they resumed their journey without any further mishaps, they arrived at Freedenburg and checked into a hotel, leaving their car at a nearby garage. In their hotel rooms, a maid complimented Mollie's long hair, reminiscing about a girl with a similar scar they had encountered before. The maid described the mysterious girl's troubled demeanor and hinted at a hidden story behind her travels.|"['1.

The register had many names, but the clerk remembered the girl asking for a room. This hotel specialized in serving female guests.

Betty hesitated, wanting to comment on the haunted house but wisely chose not to add to her friends' nerves. Recognizing the urgency to fix their stalled car before a storm hit, she took charge. Betty suggested a prize of chocolates for whoever found the car trouble first. Mrs. Mackson supported the idea, offering hairpins to help. As darkness fell and thunder rumbled, Betty and Mollie inspected the engine. Mollie adjusted the carburetor and primed the cylinders. Despite their efforts, the motor wouldn't start.

Betty and Mollie were in a fix with their car, but they had a clever idea. Betty found out that the self-starter could move the car without the motor running. They decided to use this to their advantage. Betty planned to start the self-starter, engage low gear, and let the car coast down the hill. They hoped to repeat this on the next level to cover a mile. Mollie suggested putting up the top to stay dry. Grace, on the other hand, preferred to walk away from the gloomy Shadow Valley.

Betty and her friends were caught in a sudden storm while in their auto. As the rain poured down and the wind howled, they struggled to secure the side curtains. Despite their efforts, the wind ripped off one of the curtains, leaving them exposed to the elements.

The situation was challenging as the new curtain fasteners proved to be ineffective against the strong wind. The girls found themselves battling the storm, with rain coming in through the open sides of the auto.

During a storm, a group of girls sought refuge in a supposedly haunted house. Despite their fears, Betty took charge and led the way inside, followed by her friends. The shelter was old and decaying but offered them a dry place to stay. As they explored, they found the house empty and abandoned. Amy insisted that no one lived there, and the place was deserted.

They entered the old mansion, once grand but now showing only slight signs of decay. Grace marveled at its size, envisioning it as a cheerful sanitarium with some repairs and decorating. As they explored the spacious rooms, Grace clung to Amy's arm, staying close to Mr. Blackford, who had returned empty-handed in his search for his sister. They ascended the grand staircase to the upper floors, finding mostly storage rooms on the fourth floor. The third floor contained beautifully decorated guest rooms, now dusty and worn.

A man was mistakenly thought to be a ghost in a haunted mansion while making his hair tonic. The groaning sounds were from heating the tonic in a furnace, causing air pressure changes. He used sulfur for the tonic, creating blue flashes and a distinct smell. Wearing a white garment to protect his clothes, he mistook a girl for someone else and locked her up. The man was eventually caught for fraudulent activities. A poetical storekeeper rewarded the girls for dispelling the ghostly rumors. The mansion became a sanitarium, and the girls welcomed their friend back after her fortune was restored.
