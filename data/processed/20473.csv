""I used to think the same about her until she confided in me. She may appear tough, but deep down, she's always been afraid of the other girls. She struggled to find the right words at the right time, which is why she seemed so stern when interacting with others,"" Elfreda added with a smile.

""I don't think she meant to be intimidating,"" Elfreda continued cheerfully. ""She recognizes her flaws but is making an effort to change. Just wait and see how Laura Atkins transforms,"" she said optimistically.

""She does,"" remarked Arline. ""That's exactly who I had in mind. Dressed as a live doll and showcased in the middle of the booth, she would attract a lot of attention. Will you invite her to meet us at the gymnasium on Monday at five o'clock? Let's also plan to approach the others we need for the bazaar before Monday. We should decide now who will be left over for the circus.""

""They should, but they probably won't,"" Gertrude dryly predicted. ""There are some rebellious freshmen this year. That peculiar West girl, who fancies herself a 'newspaper woman' and looks like a mischievous little elf, is leading the pack.""

""Gertrude, she's quite intelligent and has worked hard to prepare for college,"" Grace defended, her sense of fairness surfacing. 

""That may be true. I believe you, Grace, but why can't she just follow the rules of the college? She may not break the study rules, but she's defiant in other areas. Plus, she disregards traditions and their significance. She--well--"" Gertrude paused, then blushed slightly and stopped.

""This is the first time I've received an anonymous letter,"" she said seriously, hoping it would be the last. She expressed disbelief that a student from Overton would resort to such mean-spirited actions. Grace, recalling a past incident with an unsigned note that had troubled a friend, wondered if the same person was behind this one. She asked to see the note again, studying the handwriting closely. Finding it both familiar and unfamiliar, she returned it, puzzled. Before the dean could respond, a knock interrupted them, revealing Arline Thayer.

Grace and Arline left the tent, nodding coldly to the newcomers. Grace thought about the Sphinx and how Emma Dean, disguised as the Sphinx, cleverly answered questions.

The Cheshire Cat danced, the Dodo jumped through hoops, and the King and Queen had a funny dialogue. Elfreda, as the Mad Hatter, stole the show with her humor.

Early in the morning, Jean was busy preparing his cabin for his young guests' arrival at three o'clock. He decorated the walls with ground pine and evergreen, and hung a perfect piece of mistletoe from the ceiling. After cleaning his rifle and scrubbing the cabin spotless, he built a warm fire in the fireplace. Jean then gathered wood and arranged his belongings neatly. Meanwhile, Grace shared her love for fairy tales, preferring giants and magic over fairy princes. Nora recalled her fondness for 'The Magic Fiddle,' while Hippy dreamt of owning a magical table.

"The elderly man stopped talking and gazed back at the fire. Silently, he got up, walked to a small table, and took out a worn envelope from a drawer. Returning to the group, he handed it to Grace, saying proudly, ""This is the letter my friend wrote. Will Miss Grace read?""

""Let's make up for our mistake by being helpful,"" suggested Anne, grabbing paper and a pencil. ""I'll write down names for the surprise party if you give them to me.""
