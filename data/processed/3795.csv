Voices could be heard around the area, with the lilacs nodding over the tall wall as if they hinted at secrets they could share. The mullein by the gate hurried to peek through the keyhole to see what was happening inside. A peculiar sight awaited anyone who might have looked through the keyhole on a June day; a party was being prepared. A wide walkway paved with dark stones led from the gate to the porch, bordered by tall bushes forming a green roof. Neglected flowers and wild weeds covered the walls, creating a beautiful tapestry. A board covered with a shawl held a miniature tea set, though slightly worn. Thirteen dolls in full dress lay on the seats, waiting for the festivities to begin. A fourteenth doll hung from the door knocker, dressed in yellow calico, awaiting a grand ball for her seventh birthday. Two girls approached, one with a pitcher and the other carrying a basket. They were not twins, but looked alike, with sunburnt faces and braided hair. Betty ran to embrace the suspended doll, exclaiming her beauty, while the girls enjoyed the fragrance of the cake in the basket.|['1.

Betty and Bab were busy setting up a doll tea party. They carefully arranged the dolls around the table, struggling to make them sit properly.

Bab grabbed her new pail and gathered all the bits and pieces, attempting to coax the sad dog into eating and feeling better. However, the dog only made it to the door and sat up, pleading with its eyes. Bab put down the pail and stepped back, feeling sorry.

The children shrieked, especially Bab and Betty, who lost their pail. The bell rang for school, and the children went in, leaving the boys to investigate. After school, Bab and Betty rushed home to share their story with their mother, who consoled them. She promised to get them a new pail and then took them to see the old coach-house.

"""No, ma'am, and I don't think I mind. Just don't be tough on Sanch; he's been really good to me, and we're fond of each other; isn't that right, old buddy?"" answered the boy, with his arm around the dog's neck, and a worried look he hadn't shown for himself.

Bab and Betty burst into laughter when their mother mentioned that, and Ben let out a faint giggle, as if he wanted to join in if only he had the strength. But his legs trembled, and he felt a strange dizziness; so he just held onto Sancho, blinking at the light like a young owl.

""Come with me, child. Girls, go and warm the rest of the broth and fill the kettle. I'll take care of the boy,"" commanded Mrs. Moss, shooing off the children and checking the pulse of her new guest.

The children were busy finishing up their schoolwork. The plans for ""lilac-parties"" were postponed. The boys entertained themselves with Miss Celia's suggestions. Thorny and Ben spent time arranging boyish treasures. Thorny taught Ben how to use a printing press, and they planned a newspaper. They also worked on stamp collections and flags of different nations. Miss Celia joined in, providing resources for the children's creative projects. The children sewed bright strips and created an array of colorful banners. They also engaged in ship-building and waterworks activities outdoors, enjoying the June weather. Miss Celia planned exploring expeditions, filling their days with adventures and discoveries. Thorny asked Ben to be his amanuensis, teaching him about botany and writing."|"[""1.

"Ben gazed absentmindedly from the ground to the sky, almost ready to abandon his search, when a buttercup landed at his feet. He noticed Miss Celia smiling at him from behind her brother Thorny, who was unaware of the flower. Thorny, taking charge like a strict schoolmaster, demanded Ben to learn about the buttercup as punishment for cheating. Ben, perched on a mossy stump, obediently struggled through the analysis Thorny dictated, with Thorny guiding him through the botanical terms. Overwhelmed, Ben exclaimed, ""If that's botany, I'm out!"" But Thorny insisted Ben would learn it all, promising a study of dandelions next. Thorny explained the importance of botany for their Scientific Exploration Society, emphasizing the need to identify plants for safety. The conversation led to a discussion on the differences between toadstools and mushrooms, highlighting the practical applications of botanical knowledge."|['1.

Thorny, a keen botany enthusiast, warned Ben about the dangers of poisonous plants in the woods. Ben, intrigued by Thorny's passion, learned about plants with long names, bugs, and ants. Despite his preference for insects, Ben agreed to study dangerous plants. The boys embarked on a botanical adventure, exploring the woods and fields. Ben's vivid descriptions of nature enticed Thorny to join him. The town buzzed with children on vacation, engaging in picnics and baseball games. Thorny, too weak to play, appointed Ben as his proxy in baseball matches. The boys eagerly anticipated a grand Fourth of July baseball match but faced setbacks due to absent players.

Two boys, Ben and Sam, were discussing the lack of excitement in their town for the Fourth of July. Ben reminisced about the thrill of celebrating in Boston, while Sam read aloud an advertisement for a circus coming to town. The boys were captivated by the images of the grand show, filled with performers, animals, and acrobatics. Sam suggested walking to the circus with Billy, offering to send word to Sam's mother. Ben hesitated, worried about leaving his dog Sancho alone. However, Sam reassured Ben and encouraged him to join in the fun, promising a memorable time.

"""They never come to small towns like this,"" Bab exclaimed in frustration, feeling disappointed. Ben, though laughing and cutting canes, felt guilty for not asking permission to go. He regretted not including Mrs. Moss in the plan. As they rested by a watering-trough, Sam suggested a quick lunch with gingerbread. The boys lay under a wild cherry-tree, munching, while gazing at the grand tent in the distance. Sam proposed a shortcut through fields to explore the circus. Billy, excited for his first circus, urged them on. Suddenly, he spotted a tired-looking Bab and Sancho approaching. Bab, red-faced and tear-streaked, clutched Sancho, who looked worn out.

Bab talked to the dog as if it could understand her and Sancho seemed to respond. He stopped drinking, perked up his ears, and barked suspiciously at the squirrels. Bab, exhausted yet determined, tried to pull Sancho along to see the tent from the outside. Sancho, hearing a chirrup, bounded away and playfully pounced on Ben. Amidst laughter, Bab climbed up the bank fearlessly. She had managed to get there without bothering Ben. The boys were impressed by Bab's bravery and Ben promised to take care of her. Ben warned Bab about poisonous swamp-sumach leaves she had collected. Ignoring the warning, they ran down the hill with the lively dog, exploring the big tent's external attractions. Ben, feeling at home, confidently paid for the tickets and led the group through the menagerie, impressing them with his nonchalant demeanor. Bab was captivated by the animals, especially the ponies and their colts.|['1.

Ben and Bab were at the circus, eagerly watching the procession of gold carriages, lovely horses, flags, and elephants. The band played as the performers caracoled around the ring, showcasing their skills. Ben was particularly excited about the upcoming bareback riding and acrobatic exercises. The acrobats displayed incredible strength and agility, each trying to outdo the other. The leader even performed a double somersault over five elephants, leaving the audience in awe. Bab was thrilled, especially when the dogs took their seats in the chairs, including a poodle with a blue ribbon that reminded her of Sancho. Sancho, Ben's dog, was eager to join the fun, but Ben had to keep him in check to avoid causing a disturbance.|"['1.

Sancho, once a rebellious dog, now lay still, pondering his mistreatment. He watched the dog show without showing any interest, secretly believing he could outperform the tricks if given the chance. Ben, his owner, regretted the rift between them and longed to showcase Sancho's talents once more. Meanwhile, Bab marveled at the performers' skills, particularly a lady driving four horses and performers on the trapeze. The show continued with elephants and tigers, captivating the audience until a sudden thunderstorm caused panic. Ben reassured Billy as the storm approached, urging him to wait it out and enjoy the animal exhibits later. Despite the excitement, Billy's fear of the storm overshadowed the spectacle, wishing to be safe at home with his mother.|"['1.

Bab, determined to keep her promise, bravely insisted on walking home despite the rain. Ben, leading the way to the outer tent, encountered Billy Barton, who was caught in the rain after attending the circus alone. Billy's uncle found him and offered to take him home, despite having a full car. Ben, unable to join them, assured Billy that he would inform Bab's mother of her whereabouts. Despite the rain, Bab remained cheerful and expressed her love for circuses and the excitement of living in such a place. Ben, reflecting on the importance of family, realized the value of having loved ones to care for. The scene set at the circus with the animals being tended to and the workers preparing for the evening show sparked a moment of realization in Ben before he handed Sancho's strap to Bab.|"['1.

"Sancho could have replied, ""You are too,"" but, being polite, he sat down to watch as the little colts, now awake and playful, entertained themselves behind their mothers. Bab found joy in their antics, tying the strap to a post to pet the mouse-colored colt. Unfortunately, Sancho untied the knot and wandered off to meet a bulldog, leaving the colt vulnerable. Bab and Ben were distraught when Sancho disappeared, and Ben was visibly upset. Bab followed Ben, both feeling the weight of the loss. As they trudged along, Ben's silence spoke volumes, leaving Bab longing for his forgiveness.

Ben was kinder than expected. Just before reaching home, Bab, with tears in her eyes, stumbled over a tree root and tumbled down a bank into wet nettles. Ben quickly helped her up, trying to comfort her. Bab, feeling miserable, cried about her stinging skin, hunger, cold feet, and overall horrid situation. Ben, feeling sorry for her, apologized for being cross, promising never to shake her again. They decided to go home to tell their mother all about it. Ben pushed Bab in a wheelbarrow, hoping their dog Sanch would return home before them. Bab, exhausted and with wet boots, wished someone would give her a ride. A boy with a wheelbarrow helped them, and Ben, determined to show his strength, pushed Bab uphill to their house. Despite the challenges, they finally reached home where Pat, a family member, scolded them for causing worry. Pat then offered to take them home in a chaise.

At the lodge gate, Ben excitedly ran ahead, leaving the waiters anxious. Pat, left behind, shook his fist playfully as he drove away. Mrs. Moss, relieved by the news of Bab's safe return, warmly welcomed the wanderers. After tending to them, she scolded them mildly. The children shared their adventures, causing laughter, especially at the wheelbarrow incident. Miss Celia, though displeased, decided not to scold, feeling Ben had been punished enough. The loss of the beloved dog, Sancho, caused great sorrow. Ben was inconsolable, feeling the loss deeply. Thorny offered comfort, suggesting they would find Sancho or get another dog. Ben, disheartened, felt no other dog could replace Sancho. Thorny, understanding Ben's grief, offered his dog Jack, but Ben declined. Thorny's kindness showed Ben the value of friendship. Later, the sound of a hand-organ and a monkey brought some comfort to Ben, evoking memories of happier times.|"[""1.

Escorted by Bab and Betty from the Lodge, the man and his monkey arrived, bringing joy to the children. The man played the hand-organ while the monkey collected pennies. Ben, familiar with monkeys, made Jacko comfortable. Miss Celia conversed with Giacomo in Italian, understanding his longing for Naples. The man played music for the children, and Ben considered joining him on his journey.

That very evening, Thorny wrote to a boy cousin in New York, providing all the details of the situation and requesting him to investigate. The boys anxiously awaited a reply, but when it arrived, they found little comfort in it. Cousin Horace had tried his best but could only report a failure. The owner of the black poodle was suspicious, claiming he bought the dog from a stranger. Despite the setback, they remained hopeful that Sanch would return. Weeks passed, and still no sign of Sanch. One afternoon, as Ben sat reading, Lita returned from a ride in a distressed state. Ben quickly realized she had taken a long journey at full speed. Sensing Lita's distress, Ben sprang into action, removing the broken saddle and preparing to ride bareback to find Miss Celia.

Ben swiftly approached old Mrs. Paine, who was calmly knitting, startling her like a clap of thunder. She immediately sprang into action, instructing Ben to bring the pale girl inside. Liddy was to get camphor, and Melissy was to prepare a bed. Meanwhile, Ben's father and Bijah would attend to the girl's needs.

Miss Celia was comfortably placed in bed by the farmer's wife and daughter. When the doctor came, she endured the arm setting bravely. Ben was then sent home to reassure Thorny and to request the Squire to bring a carry-all for her the next day if she could be moved. Mrs. Moss wisely stayed silent, making preparations and awaiting news. Bab and Betty were out berrying, keeping Thorny unaware. He had a peaceful nap and later found Ben and Lita resting in the loose box after a refreshing wash. Ben shared his thrilling tale with Thorny, who was amazed and excited.

Miss Celia hesitated, observing the heated exchange between Thorny and Ben. The boys were in a dispute, with Thorny accusing Ben of hiding something. Just as Thorny was about to confront Ben physically, Miss Celia intervened, seeking the truth. She asked Ben if there was something hidden in the closet, to which Ben responded with defiance. Thorny then mentioned missing money and suspected Ben. Ben, feeling misunderstood, revealed that he had taken a cat from the Squire's place as a gift for Miss Celia.

Thorny's stern expression and tone made Ben realize they suspected him of taking the money. Feeling innocent but overwhelmed, Ben's heart sank as he saw doubt in their faces. Unable to prove his innocence, he decided to leave. Thorny stopped him, urging Ben not to go and offering to talk it through. Miss Celia suggested searching the room to clear things up.

The orphaned baby mice were separated from their cozy nest by two people, Miss Celia and her brother. Among the torn pieces of their home, they found some greenish paper that seemed to be parts of two bank bills. They could see a big number ten, but the rest of the figures were missing. Despite this, they decided to trust the other bill. Miss Celia and her brother extended their hands warmly to Ben, who shook them both differently. He held Miss Celia's hand gratefully, remembering her kindness, while he squeezed Thorny's hand tightly in a revengeful manner. Miss Celia tried to lighten the mood by joking about the incident, and they all laughed. Kitty, a cat, then appeared and quickly ate the last baby mouse, bringing a swift end to the situation. Miss Celia suggested giving Ben cuff-buttons and a whip handle as gifts, while also planning to help him with his education.

"The boys had risen early to set up the show and were thrilled by the fluttering pennons in the fresh breeze. The Venetian lion seemed to yearn for home, the Chinese dragon tangled with the Burmese peacock, and the Russian eagle pecked at the Turkish crescent while challenging the English royal beast.
