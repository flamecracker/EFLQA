This short tale was crafted after exploring various versions of Celtic stories like 'Old Celtic Romances' by Dr. Joyce, 'Reliquae Celticae' by Dr. Cameron, and 'The Pursuit after Diarmud O'Duibhne and Grainne the daughter of Cormac Mac Airt' by Standish Hayes O'Grady. I believe you will find these Celtic Tales quite captivating. Although they may carry a tinge of sadness, sometimes we seek stories beyond mere amusement. These tales are not shared for their moral lessons but for their sheer beauty. Just like many Irish and Scottish children before you, I hope you relish these stories without pondering too much on their meanings. In a time when numerous Kings ruled the lush Green Island of Erin, none surpassed the grandeur of the mighty Concobar. Poets sang of his kingdom's splendor, and his palace was a marvel that inspired the sweetest songs of Erin. Amidst a grand feast, an aged magician rose before the assembly. His long white hair cascaded over his stooped frame, and his piercing black eyes held a gaze that seemed to transcend reality. The magician's prophetic words had already come to fruition, and a hushed reverence fell upon the gathering as all eyes turned to him. He fixed his gaze upon Concobar, the King, and then upon Felim. 'Tonight, O Felim the Harper, a daughter with starry eyes shall be born within these castle walls.|"['1.

In the kingdom of King Concobar, a girl named Deirdre was kept hidden in a cottage deep within the forest. The King had ordered that anyone who entered the woods would face death. Deirdre grew up in seclusion, visited only by the King and a trusted nurse. As she blossomed into a young woman, she longed to see the world beyond her sheltered life. Lavarcam, the woman who cared for her, devised a plan to introduce Deirdre to a man named Nathos. Against the King's strict rules, Lavarcam led Deirdre to a well in the forest where she encountered the swineherd and two shepherd lads. Deirdre, expecting to meet a man as described in her dreams, was disappointed by the reality. She realized Lavarcam had deceived her and confronted her about the lies.|"[""1.

In a forest, Deirdre's beauty revealed her true identity to the men she encountered. They were humble hill dwellers, not nobles. Deirdre instructed a swineherd to find Nathos, the eldest son of Usna, and inform him of her location by a well beyond the Moor of Loneliness. Deirdre kept her plans secret, leaving Lavarcam curious. The swineherd's mysterious death hinted at King Concobar's knowledge of their meeting. Lavarcam, avoiding the palace, sought out Nathos, sharing Deirdre's message. Days passed until Deirdre, alone in the woods, heard a hunting horn. Nathos appeared, captivated by her beauty. Deirdre revealed her identity, expressing her longing for him.

Nathos urgently advised Deirdre to act swiftly, warning her of the danger lurking. He tossed his javelin into the bracken, revealing the treachery of the King. Nathos instructed Deirdre to return home and await the King's summons to be his Queen. They hurried through the dark forest, taking a brief rest among the bracken. Nathos dispatched his huntsmen on a diversion to mislead Concobar's pursuit. Despite the risks, they pressed on towards safety at the castle of the sons of Usna. Nathos planned to flee to the hills of Alba with his brothers, Ailne and Ardan, to evade the King's wrath. As they journeyed under the stars, Nathos led Deirdre to the castle, where his brothers awaited them in awe of Deirdre's beauty.

Early next morning, one hundred and fifty men rode with the three sons of Usna and Deirdre, the wife of Nathos, towards the bay where their black galley was harbored. As they gazed back at the castle of the sons of Usna in the far valley below, a column of flame caught their eyes. At sundown, the galley reached the shores of Mull, and they debated whether to seek protection from the King or return to their father's destroyed castle. That night, a galley arrived from the north island with twenty men and a richly-clad stranger. Deirdre insisted they rest before deciding. Despite Angus's pleas, Deirdre stood firm, delaying their departure until the following day. The group set sail through a misty night towards a sea-loch, where they learned that Angus was the King of Alba and had already departed for Dunedin. They spent eight peaceful days by the sea-loch, and upon returning to their boyhood home, they were welcomed by the community with joy and homage. Throughout the winter, they lived contentedly, with Deirdre's enchanting words inspiring dreams of valor and heroism among the sons of Usna.|"[""1.

In the spring, the sons of Usna were informed that the King of Alba sought to destroy their father's land and harm Nathos. They embarked on a journey northward, where they found their mother's abandoned castle. The people of the mountains pledged their loyalty to Nathos, who became like a king. After three years of peace, news of the King of Alba's death brought a bond of friendship. However, Concobar in Erin plotted revenge against Nathos for taking Deirdre. He sent Fergus to bring the sons of Usna back to Erin. Fergus approached Nathos with a message of peace and a welcoming return to Erin.

"Fergus spoke, ""Erin is Nathos' adopted land. He's been a hero in the Green Isle since his boyhood. It's good for him to rejoice in the land and defend it if needed."" The next day they sailed swiftly to the shores of the Green Isle. Deirdre felt glad to be back in her homeland, forgetting her fears and dreams briefly. Arriving at Borrach's castle in three days, Fergus had to keep his feast-bond with Borrach. Despite his feast obligation, Fergus sent his two sons with the group. Deirdre had a troubling dream about Fergus' younger son and warned Nathos to avoid Concobar. They were welcomed at the House of the Red Branch and treated with honor.

In ancient times, in the land of Erin, there lived a noble people known as the Dedannans. Among them were five chiefs, including Bove Derg and Lir, who were worthy of ruling. These chiefs journeyed so the people could choose their king. The sons of Fergus, fierce warriors, fought against the Ultonians, causing chaos. King Concobar, witnessing the battle, called upon his son, who possessed magical weapons, to join the fight. A great warrior with a blue sword appeared, seeking vengeance. Amid the turmoil, the sons of Usna, along with Deirdre, managed to escape through magical barriers. Tragedy struck as Nathos, one of the sons, faced death, followed by Deirdre, who succumbed to grief.

The Dedannans were angry, drawing swords under the sun. They sought to slay Lir, who disrespected their King. Lir lived discontent, obeying none. His wife's sudden death brought sorrow. Bove Derg, the King, sent messengers to bring Lir to him. Lir, glad to reconcile, journeyed to Bove Derg's palace. Peace was made, and joy filled the Green Isle of Erin. Lir stayed with Bove Derg, who offered his foster-daughters as Lir's wife. Twins were born, but their mother died. Lir mourned deeply. Bove Derg promised Eva, his foster-daughter, to Lir.

The children of Lir were on a joyous ride, unaware of the dark plan of their stepmother Eva. As they journeyed through a dark pass, Eva whispered to her attendants to harm the children, promising them wealth. The scene changed as they emerged into the bright sunlight, surrounded by colorful flowers and the songs of birds. Upon reaching a tranquil lake, Eva used her magic wand to transform the children into beautiful swans. She cursed them to spend centuries on different waters until certain conditions were met. The children, now swans, sang haunting songs of their plight, while Eva's heart remained cold. The king, unaware of Eva's actions, inquired about the children, leading to a search by the Dedannans.

Lir got off his chariot and was amazed. He heard a sad sound, his daughter's voice speaking Gaelic, more enchanting than ever, but only the lake surrounded him. The haunting music grew clearer as four swans appeared and flew away. The swan-maiden spoke, saying they must spend 300 years on the lake, 300 in stormy waters, and 300 on the sea, until certain events unfolded. Lir was heartbroken, but the swan-maiden assured that their music would bring peace. Lir then went to Bove Derg's palace, where he revealed Eva's treachery.

Long ago on Green Island of Erin, the children of Lir, transformed into swans, lived by Lake Darvra. The Dedannans, enchanted by their music, gathered around the lake. As years passed, the time came for the swans to fly to the stormy sea of Moyle. With heavy hearts, they bid farewell to their peaceful home. Amidst a tempest, the siblings were separated. Finola, searching for her brothers, found no trace. Alone on a rocky isle, she sang a sorrowful song. The storm passed, revealing a desolate sea.

In the tale of the four white swans on the sea of Moyle, Finola and her brothers, Conn, Fiacra, and Aed, endured many hardships. Frozen in the bitter winter, they suffered from the icy grip of the black ice. Despite their pain, they found solace in each other's company. Over the years, they flew to different lands but were bound to return to the sea of Moyle at nightfall. One day, they encountered their own Dedannan people, bringing immense joy and relief. The Dedannans shared news of their father, Lir, and Bove Derg, celebrating the Feast of Age. Although their father and friends were well, their hearts ached for the return of Finola and her brothers.|"['Question 1: What did Finola and her brothers endure on the sea of Moyle?\nA) Storms and hurricanes\nB) Harsh sunlight and drought\nC) Icy grip of black ice\nD) Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions\nE) Tornadoes and tsunamis', ""Question 2: How did Finola and her brothers feel about each other's company during their hardships?\nA) Indifferent\nB) Annoyed\nC) Disgusted\nD) Found solace\nE) Hateful"", 'Question 3: Where were Finola and her brothers bound to return at nightfall?\nA) Different lands\nB) The Dedannan people\nC) The sea of Moyle\nD) The Feast of Age\nE) The black ice', 'Question 4: Who did Finola and her brothers encounter one day on the sea of Moyle?\nA) Their enemies\nB) Strangers from a distant land\nC) Mermaids\nD) Their Dedannan people\nE) Pirates', 'Question 5: What news did the Dedannans share with Finola and her brothers?\nA) News of a war\nB) News of a famine\nC) News of their father, Lir, and Bove Derg\nD) News of a treasure\nE) News of a shipwreck', 'Question 6: What did the hearts of Finola and her brothers ache for?\nA) The Feast of Age\nB) The return of their Dedannan people\nC) The return of their father and friends\nD) The bitter winter\nE) The icy grip of black ice']"|['C) Icy grip of black ice', 'D) Found solace', 'C) The sea of Moyle', 'D) Their Dedannan people', 'C) News of their father, Lir, and Bove Derg', 'C) The return of their father and friends']
Finola and her brothers were relieved and comforted. They had to leave Erin's shores quickly for the sea-stream of Moyle, as fate demanded. While flying, Finola sang, her voice faintly reaching the kneeling host. As her sad song faded, the Dedannans wept. The sorrowful group turned towards Lir's home upon hearing of the siblings' plight. Lir was saddened but hopeful for the day the spell would break. Three hundred years of doom ended, and the swans were eager to leave Moyle's cruel sea. They faced storms and frost, driving them to despair, until Finola had a dream. She encouraged her brothers to trust in God. They found solace on a grassy isle until the years passed. Finally, they flew east to their old home, finding only ruins. Disheartened, they settled at Inis Glora, enchanting all with their music at the Lake of the Bird-flocks.

Finola, with deep joy, revealed to her brothers that the chime they heard was the Christ-bell they had dreamed of for centuries. She sang a song of hope by the Western Sea, calming their hearts. The music brought peace instead of fear. Kemoc arrived at the lake, seeing the four white swans, knowing they were the children of Lir. He took them under his care, chaining them with silver. Kemoc shared the story of Christ with them, bringing happiness and making them forget their past sufferings. Three hundred years had passed since Eva's prophecy, and Decca heard of the swans. She wanted them, but Kemoc refused. King Largnen, her husband, sought the swans, but Kemoc protected them.|"['1.

Once, Largnen, angered, snatched the silver chains of Finola, Aed, Fiacra, and Conn, dragging them from the church. As they neared the exit, the swans shed their feathers, breaking the spell. The children of Lir begged the Saint to baptize them as death approached. They asked to be buried together, Conn by Finola's side, Fiacra on the other, and Aed in front. The Saint witnessed the swans transform into radiant children ascending to heaven. The children were buried by the church, Cormac welcomed messengers from Finn, and Grania confessed her love for Dermat, seeking to escape a forced marriage to Finn.|['1.

Dermat felt troubled as he listened to Grania's words. He believed he wasn't worthy of her love and feared the wrath of Finn. Grania urged Dermat to follow her from Tara before Finn woke up, emphasizing the importance of keeping his vow. She assured him that he could easily escape with his skills. Grania revealed that her father's horses and chariots were nearby for their getaway. With the help of loyal nobles, warnings were sent to Dermat through Bran the hound and a loud-voiced servant. Finn's men were unable to reach Dermat due to the strong fence he had built. Eventually, Dermat managed to escape to safety with Grania under the protection of Angus, leaving Finn behind.|"[""1.

In the early hours, Angus bid farewell to his companions, leaving them with a caution as he knew Finn would pursue them. He warned them not to enter trees with a single trunk, caves with only one opening, or islands with a sole path. They were advised not to eat where they cooked, sleep where they ate, or rise where they slept. Dermat and Grania eventually reached a wood where a giant named Sharvan guarded a tree with magical berries. The giant was fearsome and could only be defeated by his own club. Upon hearing of the berries, Grania expressed a strong desire to taste them. This angered Sharvan, leading to a fierce battle where Dermat emerged victorious. He then instructed the captive chiefs to bury Sharvan's body to calm Grania before calling for the Princess.|"['1.
