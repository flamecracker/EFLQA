"Jane started her car and drove through the town in search of the hotel. They found it after a few inquiries. Wantagh, a prosperous village on the shore of Lake Winnipesaukee, was where Miss Elting's brother had practiced law before heading West. He left behind the ""Red Rover,"" an old houseboat, for Miss Elting and her friends, the Meadow-Brook Girls, to use for their summer vacation. Meeting Dickinson, who was in charge of the boat, was discouraging. The girls were put off by his shifty eyes and reluctance to prepare the boat. Despite their initial impressions, Dickinson was a notary who did real estate business. The boat, once yellow, was now weathered and rundown. Inside, it was dirty and neglected, with food scattered about and a rusty stove."|"['1. What did Jane and her friends find at the hotel?\nA. A treasure map\nB. A mysterious letter\nC. A houseboat\nD.

"Harriet moved to the stove for a fresh view of the boat's interior. Resting her hand on it briefly, she pulled back, almost speaking but then stopping. ""A deal's a deal,"" Jane said. ""I'll fetch the paint. You explore and note what we need. We'll stay at the hotel tonight."" Jane left with Dickinson to get the paint. Meanwhile, the girls, excited about the boat's potential, discussed plans with Miss Elting. They welcomed the painters and began unloading supplies. Hazel wet the floor to reduce dust, and the girls, wearing aprons, scrubbed the cabin. Despite the dusty start, they were eager to transform the ""Red Rover"" into a cozy home."|"['1.

"Jane called out to the group, ""Let's all work on one side of the boat to get it dry for painting."" The sound of brushes slapping against the boat's exterior filled the air as the windows' boards were removed for later use. Two hours later, the painters opened cans of white paint, adding a quick-drying agent to speed up the process. Tommy couldn't resist joining in, causing a playful paint fight. Miss Elting suggested an olive green ceiling. The houseboat's interior was brightening, but they knew two coats were needed. By nightfall, they had completed one coat inside and out, even painting the roof. Jane had a plan for the roof, which they executed the next morning. The girls were exhausted but happy with their work, despite their paint-splattered faces."|"['1.

"The ""Red Rover"" gleamed in its fresh paint as the girls approached. The scent of new paint wafted through the air from the lake. Excited, the girls quickly boarded the boat, eager to settle in and start their new adventure. With aprons and gloves on, they began painting the interior while the windows were installed. By noon, both inside and outside of the boat were painted, including the floor. After paying the painters, Jane led the girls to load the old stove into the car. They then rushed to the village for shopping. They bought an oil stove, canned goods, and a sea chest for clothes. A carpenter was called to create an awning on the upper deck.

"When the girls completed their work that evening, Crazy Jane McCarthy had spent a significant amount of money, but the equipment for the ""Red Rover"" was almost fully ready. Just before sunset, they observed Miss Elting painting the boat's name on its side. In large, neat white letters, she carefully inscribed the name, making it stand out boldly against the boat's bright red color. Harriet suggested painting just one side for now, leaving the other side for later. Meanwhile, Harriet and Jane had a private conversation and then rowed the houseboat out into the lake, anchoring it without explanation. The next morning, they loaded the car with supplies and drove to the dock. To their shock, the ""Red Rover"" was missing, with only the rope tied to the dock remaining.

"""In a moment, I want to check the other end of this rope, Harriet. It's important to start from the right end. This is it; once we pull the rope in, we'll move to the other side.

I'll row. Remember when I accidentally touched the hot stove on the houseboat? And the bread crumbs? Someone was living there. Dee didn't want us there until he checked."" Harriet rowed the boat back to the ""Red Rover,"" which had drifted. The girls, excited and out of breath, climbed aboard to find the back half flooded with water and sand from the waves.

Harriet and Jane worked tirelessly to bail out the water from the boat's cockpit. With aching backs, they managed to clear the stern, but the boat's front was still stuck. As they tried to move the heavy boat, Harriet slipped and fell into the water, drenching herself. Jane laughed at the sight. They continued their efforts, and with a sudden push, both girls ended up in the lake. Despite their soaked state, they found humor in the situation. The boat finally floated free, and Harriet rowed a smaller boat to help tow the larger one. They secured a rope to the boat, preparing for a challenging but necessary task to move it to safety.|['1.

"Jane waded to the rowboat for the rope and secured it. Harriet rowed while Jane pushed the ""Red Rover,"" but it moved slowly. Jane had to wade into deep water to reach the rowboat and nearly tipped it getting aboard. With two pairs of oars, they tried to tow the houseboat, but it went sideways, almost tipping over. Harriet dove into the lake to help. After a struggle, she climbed back aboard the houseboat and took control. Despite Jane's directions, the boat was hard to steer. Suddenly, the rope broke, and Jane fell into the rowboat. Then, a crash alerted Harriet to Jane struggling in the water.

"""Yes. You need someone to save you about once every five minutes, Tommy Thompson. Now, if Crazy Jane had thought out such a plan, no one would have been surprised. But for Harriet Burrell to do so--oh, my!"" exclaimed Jane.

""I do not think the plan feasible,"" declared Miss Elting. ""I am not saying that it would not work, but I don't believe I care to trust myself to drift across the lake in a gale. No, thank you. We will keep to the shore. Remember, we are on the water, Harriet.""

""Yes. And it isn't so long ago since we were in it,"" nodded Jane. ""Tommy was the last to be in it. Please pass the potatoes. This life at sea does sharpen one's appetite. It wouldn't do for me to go to sea really. I'd get so hungry between meals that I'd gnaw the masts off short.""

""I had forgotten about the dishes. But I've got a plan about that. You just put the dishes in a bag and slosh them up and down in the lake. Then you put them on deck till they dry off. Now, isn't that a plan? That is a better plan than Harriet said just now.""

After dinner, the girls quickly cleared the table. Jane filled the hanging lamps, and Harriet prepared the lantern to be used as a night light to prevent other boats from colliding with them. Miss Elting proposed roles for the crew: Jane as chief officer, Margery as purser, Hazel as third officer, and asked Tommy what role she preferred. Harriet expressed doubts about being captain due to her lack of experience with larger boats. As night fell, they chatted until the cabin was dimly lit by a lantern. Harriet noticed the wind picking up, predicting rough weather ahead. She checked the anchor while the girls sought shelter below deck. Tommy, feeling seasick, was helped to bed by her friends. They all settled in for the night, finding comfort in the cozy but rocking cabin.|"[""1.

"Harriet stayed up late, worried about the weather and the anchor rope on the ""Red Rover."" Despite the heavy sea, the boat seemed to handle the swells well. As the night progressed, the waves grew stronger, and Harriet even ventured out to the deck. The moon provided some light, but the rough waters sprayed her, making her retreat to bed. Suddenly, a loud crash jolted her awake as water flooded the cabin, throwing everyone around. In the darkness, the girls were terrified, but Harriet calmed them, assuring them they were not sinking.

"""Now,"" she said as the scared girls responded to their names. ""Let's figure out what happened. The boat isn't rocking as much, and the tilt has lessened."" With Jane's help, the girls followed Harriet's instructions. First, Tommy and Margery, then Miss Elting and Hazel. In the cockpit, the water was shallower, but Jane guided them all to the upper deck.

Jane and Harriet descended to the cabin, which was flooded. They struggled through to the forward deck, where waves still crashed. Knocked down by the waves, they managed to get back up. The boat was stuck on the shore, with the rear end raised higher than the front, submerging the lower deck. ""Let's use that awning. It's dry. Come on, Jane; let's make the best of this,"" said Harriet. They set up the awning on the ground, providing a dry place to rest. Tommy, Hazel, and Margery joined them ashore. ""Let's empty the cabin.

Jane McCarthy reported that there was no rope available. Harriet chose to proceed without it, confident in her plan to assess the flood. Enlisting Jane's help, the two girls moved the dining table to the upper deck, leaving it there temporarily. Despite standing in water, Harriet positioned the cots at the doorway's edge, with Jane assisting in holding them steady. Using the table as support, Harriet secured the cots in place. Jane later located a heavy blanket, which they placed over the cots on the upper deck, weighting it down with stones. Unable to access the upper deck or the boat without disrupting the barricade, Harriet waded ashore, enduring waves that knocked her over. The girls then tended to the stove, gathering leaves and grass to prevent rusting. They also dried bedding and clothing, hanging them on bushes. Though the girls were uncomfortable, Harriet and Jane focused on organizing supplies in the cabin and bailing water out of the boat.|"['1.

Two brave girls began bailing water out of the boat without seeking help from their friends, believing they could achieve more alone. The task was exhausting, and despite their efforts, the boat's hold remained flooded. They took brief breaks on shore but continued working tirelessly. Miss Elting urged them to stop, but Jane and Harriet persisted. They worked through the night, alternating between bailing and resting until morning when they finally rested alongside their friends. Later, they managed to open a chest in the cabin, finding everything inside dry. They quickly changed into clean clothes just as a motorboat approached.

The dark night made it hard for Harriet to navigate her boat quietly. Approaching the lake, she spotted lights on the island and heard a motor boat and shouts.

The Meadow-Brook girl hesitated to enter the secret channel to protect the houseboat's hiding spot. Instead, she looked for another hiding place for her boat. Ready to escape if discovered, she tossed a tin dipper into the lake to divert attention. The pursuing boat turned towards the splash, giving her a chance to move her rowboat closer to shore. Hiding in foliage, she waited as the men in the other boat searched in vain. They decided to stay close to the shore, hoping to catch her if she emerged.

The rowboat was slowly returning with the rowers chatting and wondering about the mysterious spy. They passed by the girl, one of them even threatening revenge. Once they rowed a safe distance away, the girl cautiously pushed her boat out and headed home. Harriet was amused but stayed alert, not forgetting about the mysterious canoe. As she rowed past their retreat entrance without noticing, she quickly realized her mistake and skillfully navigated her boat into a secret waterway, surprising her companions. Harriet shared her encounter with the mysterious canoe, prompting Tommy to complain about being tired from watching others work. The group discussed the girls' impressive hike and made plans to search for them without letting on that they were looking.

Once again, the canoe moved and positioned itself under a window. The window was open, and the curtains fluttered in the breeze. A figure in a canoe stood up without tipping it. Suddenly, Tommy woke up with a gasp. She had dreamt of Buster as a pirate trying to smother her. Tommy thought she saw a face at the window, causing her to scream in terror. Despite the moonlight and no boats in sight, Tommy insisted she saw someone. Miss Elting decided to investigate, suspecting a prowler. While Jane and Hazel searched the boat, Tommy and Margery debated whether Tommy truly saw a face. Miss Elting speculated that the Tramp Club might have stolen something, but she believed Tommy's sighting was likely just a nightmare.|"['1.

"""I don't think stealing a rowboat in the dead of night is clever or original,"" Harriet said slowly. ""I doubt the boys would think so either.

Billy expressed his concern that the girls might play more tricks that night, and George suggested putting a boy on watch to surprise them if they tried to escape. The plan was put into action at the camp, with Larry on guard watching the girls' boat until dawn. The boys feared being outwitted by the girls and were determined not to lose the wager. However, at daybreak, the anchor light disappeared as the morning light grew stronger. George dismissed the incident as a false alarm and acknowledged the girls' cleverness in outsmarting them three times.

"""We will deal with the ghosts once we locate the 'Red Rover',"" George replied. His face turned slightly pale upon hearing the sound, admitting to himself that he felt uneasy. He was relieved to be leaving their camp for a while. It was clear that the noise was a sign of disapproval of their presence on the island. George recalled Harriet Burrell's talk about ghosts the night before. He had dismissed it then but took it seriously now. No more cries were heard that morning. The boys extinguished their campfire, tidied up the camp, while Billy prepared his motor for a morning ride around the island. The launch departed half an hour later, with a somber atmosphere. George expressed his disappointment in Larry for underestimating the girls' honesty. As they searched, they found a small red-painted boathouse that resembled the 'Red Rover.'

The boys quickly approached their tent, finding it in disarray. The tent's contents were haphazardly piled in the center, with a khaki suit draped over sticks, resembling a person at first glance.

Larry remarked on the girls' visit, praising their resourcefulness despite the mess.

Jane McCarthy, aided by Harriet, climbed a tree with determination. Harriet skillfully helped Jane reach the top. After surveying their work, Harriet quietly left, earning Jane's admiration.

A group of boys from the Tramp Club heard a strange, human-like laugh echoing in the night. They looked at each other in confusion as Larry nervously scanned the area. Suddenly, a chilling and eerie laugh filled the air, followed by more laughter and shrieks from different directions, making it hard to pinpoint their source. As the boys tried to flee, a towering white figure emerged, causing them to panic and run towards camp, leaping in fear. However, they unknowingly headed straight for Jane McCarthy, who was eager to join in the ghostly fun.

George let out a loud cry and jumped backward. The ghost moved closer towards him. Billy felt a light touch, and Sam screamed as something wet brushed his face. Unaware that it was just a bush's leaf, he mistook it for the ghost's cold hand. Startled, the boys began to retreat, unsure of the camp's location. Looking back, they saw the ghost following them. Shouting and running faster, they were terrified. George, thinking the camp was to the left, hesitated when he saw another ghost. Despite being the brave Tramp Club captain, he ran. The others followed suit, each going in a different direction. The woods seemed full of giant ghosts with chilling voices, all chasing them. Eventually, they ran back to camp, with each arriving one by one. After a quick discussion, they decided to leave. Sam kept watch while the others packed up. Thankfully, there were no more ghostly encounters that night.|"[""1.

"As they circled the island, the group underestimated the waves' height due to the land's protection from the wind. Once in the lake's center, a strong gale hit them.
