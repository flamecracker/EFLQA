Marilla agreed. To an outsider, the fact that the Sloanes were unmistakably Sloanes might not be very clear, but she understood. Every town has such a family; good, honest, respectable people they may be, but Sloanes they are and must always remain, even if they spoke like angels. Gilbert and Anne, unaware of Mrs. Rachel's decision about their future, strolled through the shadows of the Haunted Wood. Beyond, the harvest hills were glowing in an amber sunset light, under a pale, airy sky of rose and blue. The distant spruce groves gleamed bronze, casting long shadows over the upland meadows. But a gentle wind whispered among the fir tassels, carrying the essence of autumn. Anne remarked, “This wood now feels haunted by old memories. It seems like the young girls Diana and I used to be still play here, sitting by the Dryad’s Bubble at dusk, meeting with the ghosts. Do you know, I always feel a bit of the old fear and shiver when I walk this path in the twilight? I can’t help but imagine the ghost of the murdered child we created, creeping up behind me and touching my hand with cold fingers. Even now, I sense its little, stealthy footsteps behind me when I come here after dark. I’m not scared of the White Lady or the headless man or the skeletons, but I wish I never brought that baby’s ghost to life in my mind.|"[""1.

“Honey, can you imagine me being a poor man’s wife? I can’t do anything useful, and I am very extravagant. Oh no, my husband must have lots of money. So, I narrowed them down to two. But I couldn’t decide any easier between two than between two hundred. I knew I’d regret not marrying the other for life.”“Goodness, no. I couldn’t love anybody. It isn’t in me. Besides, I wouldn’t want to. Being in love makes you a perfect slave, I think. And it would give a man such power to hurt you. I’d be afraid. Alec and Alonzo are two dear boys, and I like them both so much that I really don’t know which I like better. Alec is the best looking, of course, and I simply couldn’t marry an ugly man. He is good-tempered too and has lovely, curly, black hair. He’s rather too perfect—I don’t believe I’d like a perfect husband—someone I could never find fault with.”“Think of marrying a name like Alonzo!” said Phil sadly. “I don’t believe I could endure it.

Anne stood by the iron railing in the sweet graveyard, her heart racing with excitement. The worn stone marked the grave of a middy killed in a historic battle. Imagining the past, Anne saw the Kingsport Harbor from a century ago. In her mind's eye, a great frigate emerged from the mist, proudly displaying the English flag. Another ship followed, carrying the heroic figure of Lawrence, wrapped in the star-spangled banner. Time seemed to rewind as the Shannon sailed victoriously with the Chesapeake as its prize.

"""I've always enjoyed that old tale,"" she expressed, ""and despite the English prevailing in that triumph, I believe it was due to the valiant, vanquished leader that I cherish it.

Davy wasn't afraid yet. He was excited for a fishing trip with the Cottons. He wished Dora was braver. She seemed scared and spoiled the fun by looking like she might cry. Davy thought girls were a bother. The Cotton kids were alone in their yard, playing happily. Dora felt relieved that Mirabel, who was like a boy, was there. They couldn't fish in the pond where churchgoers could see them, so they went to a brook in the woods. Davy, wise in his decisions, wore overalls and had a great time. Dora, on the other hand, was miserable, missing her Sunday School class. They caught plenty of fish and then had fun playing games.

Davy had a fun day fishing with the Cottons, but as the day came to an end, the sound of people heading home from church signaled that it was time to go. Reluctantly, he changed out of Tommy's overalls and back into his own clothes, leaving the string of trout behind. Davy felt a pang of guilt for skipping Sunday School and church. He remembered Mrs. Lynde's kindness, like when she fixed his torn pants without scolding him. Despite his mischievous actions, Davy tried to soothe his conscience by reciting a Golden Text. Later, as Anne settled in for the night, Davy confessed his misdeeds, seeking forgiveness through a heartfelt prayer.

When it was finally time to leave, it felt like a relief. Returning to Redmond was delightful, with experienced friends welcoming Anne on the first day. Among them were Pris, Stella, Gilbert, and Charlie Sloane, who looked more important than ever. Moody Spurgeon MacPherson, who had been a teacher, was now urged by his mother to become a minister. Unfortunately, he had a rough start in college when some Sophs shaved half his head. Aunt Jamesina arrived after Patty's Place was set up. The girls had fun decorating the house with items from friends like knick-knacks, pictures, and embroidered cushions. They even received a quilt from Mrs. Lynde. The quilts were so heavily scented with mothballs that they had to be aired outside before being used indoors.

Anne, on her way back from Redmond a few days after her return, noticed people looking at her with a hidden, kind smile. Puzzled, she wondered if something was wrong with her appearance. Was her hat askew? Was her belt loose? When she turned to check, she saw Rusty for the first time. Following her closely, Rusty was a pitiful sight. The cat, past its kitten days, looked scruffy and unkempt. Missing parts of its ears, one eye injured, and a swollen cheek, Rusty's fur was a singed black color. Anne tried to shoo him away, but Rusty persisted in following her home. Despite Anne's efforts to get rid of him, Rusty returned the next day. The girls fed him, but they knew they couldn't keep him. Although Rusty's appearance improved, they couldn't have two cats, especially with Aunt Jimsie bringing another cat soon.

"Our new teacher is a man who enjoys playing pranks. Last week, he had us, the third-class boys, and girls write about our ideal spouses. When he read our compositions, he burst into laughter. Here is what I wrote: ""My wife must have good manners, serve my meals on time, obey my commands, and always be polite to me. She should be fifteen years old, kind to the poor, keep our house tidy, attend church regularly, and have curly hair. If I find a wife like this, I promise to be a great husband. Every woman should treat her husband well. Some unfortunate women don't have husbands."" At Mrs. Isaac Wright's funeral, her husband grieved deeply. Mrs. Lynde mentioned that Mrs. Wright's grandfather stole a sheep, but Marilla advised against speaking ill of the deceased. Mr. Harrison attempted to get rid of his dog, but it miraculously came back to life and ran off. After a second attempt, the dog stayed dead.

Just thinking about it makes me realize how hungry I am. Is there any snack in the pantry, Queen Anne?"" Phil hurried to the pantry while Anne headed to the orchard with Rusty. It was a damp, pleasantly scented early spring night. The snow hadn't completely melted in the park; a small dirty mound of it still lingered under the pines along the harbor road, shielded from the April sun. Gilbert returned from the park with hands full of pale, sweet arbutus. Anne sat on a large gray boulder in the orchard, admiring the beauty of a bare birch branch hanging against the pale red sunset. She daydreamed about a magnificent castle where she ruled as queen. As Gilbert approached, Anne's thoughts were interrupted. She pondered what a summer in Avonlea without Gilbert would be like and realized she didn't fancy the idea. Anne tried to make conversation, mentioning the delightful evening and the white violets she found earlier. A long, uncomfortable silence followed, prompting Anne to look up.

Cousin Emily's boarding house has only five other residents, four elderly ladies, and one young man. Mrs. Lilly, my neighbor, enjoys sharing all her health problems in great detail. On the other side sits Mrs. Phinney, who always sounds on the verge of tears, making life seem full of sorrow. Miss Maria Grimsby, seated across from me, laughs at everything, even serious matters. The young man at the table, Jonas Blake, a Theological Student, is very ugly but kind. We quickly became friends, bonding over our connection to Redmond. Despite the disapproval of the other residents, Jonas and I enjoy each other's company, fishing, boating, and walking on the beach.

Mrs. Skinner kindly bid farewell to the visitor and shared directions to the school through a shortcut. The visitor, now a schoolteacher at Valley Road, described the charming home of Miss Janet Sweet. Janet, a good cook, had a warm demeanor with blue eyes and rosy cheeks. The small white house, 'Wayside,' nestled in a picturesque hollow, had an orchard and garden. The visitor’s cozy room featured a picture of Robby Burns and Highland Mary. The parlor had a grotto-like ambiance from the willow tree outside, with tidies, mats, and preserved coffin plates as decor. Despite a dream of being unable to laugh, the visitor found the place delightful and unique.|"['1.

Janet adored me for appreciating feather beds, despite Esther's objections. Esther, although dear, had peculiar habits due to her lack of imagination and tendency for indigestion. Janet even offered me the parlor when young men visited, although there weren't many around Valley Road. Sam Toliver, the hired boy next door, was the only young man I'd seen, offering peppermints and comments about the jump-grasses. Meanwhile, elderly love stories unfolded around me, like Mr. and Mrs. Irving's marriage and Ludovic Speed's courtship with Theodora Dix. Anne attended a feminine prayer meeting, observing a man with long legs and a kind, enduring face. Anne sensed a strength and resilience in him, hidden beneath his unkempt appearance.|"[""1.

Anne was pleased to hear that Janet had a beau. She thought Janet would make an excellent wife with her cheerful demeanor, frugal habits, tolerance, and exceptional cooking skills. The idea of Janet remaining single seemed like a waste to Anne. The next day, Janet mentioned that John Douglas wanted to take Anne to visit his bedridden mother, who loved having visitors. Anne agreed to go that evening. As they set off, Anne noticed Janet looking uncomfortable in her heavy dress on the hot day. The Douglas homestead was a beautiful, prosperous-looking house on a windy hill. Anne was surprised to see that Mrs. Douglas, John's mother, was a tiny, gentle-looking woman with pink cheeks and blue eyes. Mrs. Douglas welcomed them warmly, expressing delight at meeting Anne, who she had heard praised by her son. They all sat down to chat while enjoying a lavish spread of delicious food.|"[""1.

"""I'm afraid dear Janet's cooking has spoiled you for any other,"" she said sweetly. ""Of course nobody in Valley Road aspires to rival her. Won't you have another piece of pie, Miss Shirley? You haven't eaten anything."" After tea, Mrs. Douglas smiled benevolently and told John to take ""dear Janet"" out into the garden and get her some roses. ""Miss Shirley will keep me company while you are out—won't you?"" she said plaintively, settling down in her armchair with a sigh. ""There have been scores of nights when they've thought I could never live to see the dawn,"" Mrs. Douglas continued solemnly. ""Nobody knows what I've gone through—nobody can know but myself.

Anne was relieved when John Douglas left, feeling like her happiness was leaving with him. She hoped for a change, but nothing happened. John continued his routine with Janet, and the summer passed. Anne enjoyed her walks through the swamp on the way to school, finding solace in its beauty. One evening, Samuel, in his usual work attire, sat on the porch bench. He awkwardly expressed interest in Anne, but she found it amusing rather than hurtful. Anne shared the encounter with Janet, both laughing at the unexpected proposal. Meanwhile, Alec noted Anne's subdued reaction, suspecting it was due to her sadness over Mrs. Douglas' passing.

Janet wept sadly, but Anne brewed her a warm cup of ginger tea for comfort. Later, Anne realized she had used white pepper instead of ginger, but Janet never noticed. The evening after the funeral, Janet and Anne sat on the porch steps at sunset. The wind was calm in the pinelands, and heat-lightning flashed in the northern sky. Janet, in her black dress, looked disheveled from crying. They spoke little, as Janet seemed to prefer her sorrow. Suddenly, John Douglas entered the garden. Janet and Anne stood up. John explained that his mother had made him promise not to propose to Janet while she was alive. Despite his suffering, he now asked Janet to marry him.|"['1.

Anne was startled to find herself in a place she shouldn't have been. She quietly left and met Janet the next day. Janet shared more of the story with Anne, revealing that someone had passed away. Janet felt relieved but sad about the situation. She explained that they needed to keep the truth a secret to honor the deceased. Janet comforted John, her partner, and reassured him that they shouldn't let gossip affect them. Forgiveness and understanding were important lessons Janet shared with Anne, emphasizing that with age comes a deeper ability to forgive.

Silks, satins, velvets, jewels, laces were the preferred attire of the heroines in Jane Andrews' stories. In one tale, the protagonist sleeps in a stunning white satin nightdress adorned with seed pearls. Another story involves a character sparkling with large diamonds at a ball, yet the outcome is tragic. The paths of glory lead to the grave, either through murder or a broken heart. A masterpiece titled 'My Graves' by another author tells a sorrowful tale of a Methodist minister's wife who loses her nine children, each buried in different places from Newfoundland to Vancouver. Despite the somber themes, the stories from the olden days at Avonlea school were filled with sunshine and mirth, penned by the members of the Story Club.

Anne was the liveliest at the party that night, turning down Gilbert for a dance with a full dance card. Later, at Patty's Place with the girls, she chatted cheerfully about the day. Aunt Jamesina, keeping the fire going, mentioned that Moody Spurgeon MacPherson had visited, unaware of the dance. Aunt Jamesina humorously suggested he sleep with a rubber band around his head to train his ears. Anne, packing quilts, looked forward to returning to Avonlea the following week but lamented leaving Patty's Place forever.

Aunt Jamesina declared she would take Rusty, Joseph, and Sarah-cat home together to avoid separating the cats who had learned to live in harmony. Anne sadly admitted she couldn't bring Rusty to Green Gables due to Marilla's dislike for cats and Davy's teasing nature. Anne shared her uncertainty about her future plans, as she had been offered the principalship at Summerside High School. Phil understood Anne's predicament, knowing her plans depended on Roy's proposal. When Roy finally asked Anne to marry him in a romantic pavilion by the harbor, everyone anticipated her answer. Though the proposal was sincere and beautiful, Anne found herself unexpectedly hesitant, realizing the gravity of the decision.

"""Goodbye,"" Roy said sadly. ""I can't believe you're not who I thought you were. But there's no point in blaming each other. You're the only one I'll ever love. Thank you for your friendship, Anne.""

Anne replied softly, ""Goodbye."" She sat in the pavilion, watching mist roll in over the harbor. She felt humiliated and ashamed, but also a strange sense of freedom.

Later, Phil confronted her, ""I can't believe you led Roy on for so long and then rejected him. It's scandalous.""

Anne explained, ""I need someone who truly fits into my life. Roy was just an infatuation.""

Phil comforted her, ""Real life isn't like a novel, Anne. It's messy and complicated. Don't be too hard on yourself.""

Anne returned to Green Gables feeling lost without her dreams. Solitude without dreams felt empty, but she knew she would find her way again."|['1.

Long after Pacifique’s cheerful tune had faded away into the silence under the trees of Lover’s Lane, Anne lingered under the willows, savoring the sweet relief of a lifted dread. The morning was filled with mist and enchantment, with dew-kissed roses blooming nearby. The birds' melodious songs above her matched her mood perfectly.

As Gilbert left, Anne sighed, feeling conflicted about their friendship and unsure of his feelings.

When Gilbert arrived the next day, he found Anne eagerly waiting for him, looking as fresh as the morning and as beautiful as a star, despite the fun they had the night before. She wore a green dress, not the one from the wedding, but an old one that Gilbert had complimented her on at a Redmond reception. The shade of green perfectly complemented her hair, eyes, and skin. As they strolled along a shady path, Gilbert thought Anne had never looked lovelier. Anne, stealing glances at Gilbert, noticed how much more mature he appeared since his illness. The day and the surroundings were enchanting. Anne felt a tinge of regret as they reached Hester Gray's garden and sat on the old bench. The garden was just as beautiful as when they first discovered it, now adorned with golden rod and asters. The sound of the brook, the scent of the flowers, and the picturesque landscape brought back old memories and dreams.
