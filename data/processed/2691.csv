Nan Sherwood, a lively and curious girl, playfully questioned her friend Elizabeth about where to look, spinning around in a way that surprised Elizabeth. Nan, with her rosy cheeks, brown eyes, and unruly hair under a blue tam-o'-shanter, had a hard time sitting still in school. The people around them were mostly hardworking foreigners, visibly affected by poverty. Despite the cold, none wore gloves. A notice about the mills closing due to market conditions caught Nan's attention, but Elizabeth was indifferent to the struggles of the less fortunate. Nan empathized with the workers, understanding their fears and helplessness. Elizabeth, on the other hand, felt that the poor should learn frugality. The conversation turned to political economy, a topic that Elizabeth disliked.|"[""1.

"Nan found a girl her age peeping through the window, wearing old patched men's boots, a woolen skirt, a blouse, and a shawl.

Nan was troubled by the talk of fighting among the lumber camp men. She was concerned about the wild behavior and frequent quarrels. When Tom and Rafe were summoned to work at Blackton's camp, Nan realized the rough nature of the lumber crew. Despite the early morning start, Nan recalled Margaret's tragic story and the mystery surrounding the burned house at Pale Lick. As she hurried to prepare for the day, Nan joined her uncle and the boys for a quick breakfast of Aunt Kate's doughnuts and coffee. They hurried to the barn where the ponies were ready, eager to start their journey. The dark, cold morning didn't deter them as they set off towards Pine Camp, the ponies' hooves echoing on the packed snow. Nan found the jingling of the bells on the harness enchanting as they rode through the wintry landscape.|"[""1.

In the dim light of the early morning, Nan and her family journeyed through the snowy landscape in a horse-drawn sleigh. The lantern at the back cast a warm glow, but Uncle Henry kept it facing backward. Suddenly, they heard a wolf's cry, and Nan glimpsed a large creature chasing them. Despite the danger, Tom and Uncle Henry remained calm. Nan's heart raced as the creature drew closer, but to her relief, it wasn't a wolf. As the sky brightened, the cold intensified, and Nan noticed Rafe watching her closely. Though wary of his previous antics, she found herself secretly grateful for his concern.

Rafe urgently instructed his father to rein in the horses, then swiftly scooped up a handful of snow to rub on Nan's cheek. Although Nan was taken aback at first, she understood the reason behind Rafe's actions. Rafe explained the importance of protecting oneself from the extreme cold, sharing a cautionary tale about frostbite. As the sun rose, revealing the camp bustling with activity, the men prepared for the day ahead. Uncle Henry guided Nan to the warm dining area, where the men greeted them warmly.

"""Oh, my goodness!"" gasped the elderly man, rushing in a hurry. ""I won't get involved in any land dispute, no way! You can exclude me right now!"" He grabbed his axe, put the whetstone back on the wall, and quickly left the cabin.

Nan Sherwood would always remember that breakfast, not because of its taste, but because of the huge portions. She had never seen lumberjacks eat like this before, except for a few days at Uncle Henry's house. The table was filled with platters of baked beans, pork, fried pork, fried potatoes and onions, golden cornbread, and bowls of white gravy.

After riding twenty-five miles in the frosty air, Nan couldn't help but enjoy the food. She felt shy around the rough men but they mostly left her alone, allowing her to observe and listen.

The conversation at the table caught her attention. The men talked about Ged Raffer and Uncle Henry without holding back. It was a world different from what Nan was used to, filled with rugged individuals who seemed always ready for a fight."|['1.

The workers at the lumber camp were like giants compared to the men at the mills. Nan watched as the woodsmen got ready to head into the woods to chop down trees. Tom, with his strong dapple grays, and his brother Rafe, shared a playful moment before starting their work. Nan's uncle explained that the rough play and challenges among the men were just a way to release energy. The sound of the axes hitting the trees echoed through the forest. Nan followed the process of loading the logs onto the sledges, amazed at the strength and skill of the workers. Tom, sweating in his blue jersey, expertly guided the logs into place with precision. Despite the tensions in the camp, Nan hoped for peace between her uncle and Mr. Gedney Raffer.|"['1.

Nan sought warmth in the cook shed as her uncle was busy with the camp boss. Feeling lonely, she decided to head towards where the men were working. Following a trail, she encountered a fork and chose a path that led her to a hollow. There, she unexpectedly faced a menacing bobcat. Frozen with fear, Nan couldn't even cry out. The cat, ready to pounce, was hindered by the deep snow. Just in time, a sharp voice intervened, striking the bobcat swiftly, causing it to retreat in pain. Nan witnessed the cat retreat to a tree, injured and yowling, revealing her kittens hidden nearby. The encounter left Nan shaken but safe, thankful for the timely rescue.|"['1.

He was a small man, yet remarkably strong and agile. His attire was a mix of worn-out pieces - a ragged fur cap, a woolen muffler wrapped around his ears, a patched coat belted with a frayed rope, and oversized boots with bagging around the feet for walking on snow. With a rusty gun in hand, he gestured towards a tree where a cat had her kittens, ensuring they were left undisturbed. Speaking in a pleasant voice with broken words hinting at his French background, he introduced himself as 'Injun Pete', a familiar name in the woods.

Nan timidly reached out to touch Mr. Pete's sleeve, expressing her desire to see him despite hearing about his disfigurement from a fire.

She kept the encounter with the lynx and Mr. Pete's disfigured face a secret from her family, especially after Gedney Raffer's threatening behavior towards her uncle.

Turner struggled to start a stranded log as others rushed down the river towards him. The foreman, facing danger, shouted for an axe. A man leaped to help. Nan and Mr. Sherwood watched as a massive log headed straight for Turner. Rafe, risking his life, raced to warn him. The impact of the log hitting Turner sent him flying into the air.

Rafe bravely leaped into the river to save Turner, who was in danger of drowning among the racing logs.

Meanwhile, Mr. Blackton rushed to cut the key log of the jam causing the dangerous blockage in the river.

Nan Sherwood was very proud of her friend Rafe, filling her letters to Bess with stories about him. Slow Tom didn't feature much in Nan's thoughts or letters during this time. Her focus was on the handsome Rafe. During the Blackton drive near Pine Camp, Nan met old Toby Vanderwiller. After dinner, Nan, Margaret, and Bob Llewellen watched the Blackton drive by the riverbank. Margaret, unlike her mischievous brother, rarely showed affection. Nan wasn't sure if Margaret liked her. Margaret had thrown away a doll given to her, disliking its painted face. Nan laughed and helped Toby with a wound, despite Margaret's disdain for him. The Llewellen family, from Grandfather down to Baby Bill, had peculiar ways. Nan often saw Margaret, who disliked anyone without a fair face or smooth skin. The Llewellens lived chaotically, despite not being poor. Nan didn't have many opportunities to meet other girls in Pine Camp, except at church services held every other Sunday in the schoolhouse.|['1.

Nan had a heartfelt conversation with Aunt Kate, who was known for her kindness but lacked the initiative to engage beyond her household chores. Aunt Kate expressed her desire to see children gather on Sunday afternoons for positive teachings but felt inadequate to lead due to her own perceived shortcomings. Despite this, she shared how she had taught her own children to pray and read the Bible. Aunt Kate also mentioned Elder Posey, a humble man who struggled to support his family while serving multiple churches for a meager income.

Nan cherished a special doll named Beautiful Beulah that she kept hidden in a box in her closet at Pine Camp. While girls her age were expected to outgrow dolls, Nan couldn't part with her beloved toy. She spent rainy days playing with her doll in secret, fearing ridicule from the boys. Despite the temptation to share her secret with her family, Nan kept it to herself. She enjoyed the solitude of the tamarack swamp and the beauty of the forest, despite her initial fears of encountering wild animals.

On the day Nan walked to Toby's place for the first time, she encountered a variety of fascinating plant life. She marveled at exotic plants growing on decaying logs and stumps, delicate vines she had never seen before, and beautiful ferns. Hummingbirds and butterflies flitted above, sipping nectar from flowers. The forest was alive with the sounds of birds singing and squirrels scurrying. As she ventured deeper, she encountered mysterious creatures and unfamiliar bird calls. Suddenly, she overheard a man's harsh voice discussing her Uncle Henry.

Nan was deeply troubled by the conflict between Gedney Raffer and Uncle Henry, both seeking Toby Vanderwiller's help. Uncle Henry, facing a legal battle over timber cutting rights, needed Toby's testimony to resolve the issue. However, Raffer, threatening foreclosure on Toby's farm, put him in a tough spot. Toby, struggling to make ends meet, was torn between aiding Uncle Henry or succumbing to Raffer's pressure. Nan, empathetic towards Toby's plight, considered seeking financial help from her wealthy mother to save Toby's home.

In the countryside, a fire broke out in Pale Lick due to sawdust. The town had many buildings with sawdust foundations that smoldered for weeks before being discovered. The fire was worsened by a big wind. An old man shared a slow process for tanning leather involving vinegar and water. Nan was amazed by the beauty of the farm with green grass, tall trees, and a clear stream. The farm sometimes turned into an island in winter due to flooding. Nan met Corson, a young man with a child's body who showed her his treasures, including toys and items from the swamp and woods.

Old Toby had crafted a cabinet for Corson filled with preserved butterflies and moths, some rare and valuable. Nan suspected a moth with a human skull pattern was the famous death's-head moth. She thought collectors might be interested. The pressed flowers were pretty but not as valuable. Nan admired the neatness, likely due to old Mrs. Vanderwiller. Despite being speechless, she was kind to Nan. Nan found it pitiful and showed gratitude. Nan didn't mention the land dispute.

Nan was amazed by the intense rain pouring down. It felt like a curtain of drops sweeping across the open sawdust stage. Within minutes, they were completely drenched. Nan couldn't have been wetter if she had gone swimming. With her eyes closed, she couldn't see anything and thought Tom was being stubborn. Tom's idea of a tree fire seemed far-fetched to Nan.

Tom was startled as he gazed down from the tree and shouted, causing his horse to speed up. Suddenly, the wagon's rear wheel sank into a fiery hole, spewing flames and smoke. Nan screamed as a ball of fire shot into the air and the wind intensified. Tom bravely grabbed an axe and swiftly cut down a tree, creating a makeshift pole. As he returned, the wagon's wheel continued to spew fire. Despite the recent rain, the hidden fire found fuel in the dry sawdust.

The loud noises of the horses, the howling wind, and the thunder made Nan's ears ring. She could barely hear Tom's cries for help. Finally understanding his directions, Nan pulled with all her might to free Tom. Despite the rain pouring down, Tom managed to grab a pole and head towards the timber cart. The horses were panicking, but their chains held them in place. Tom used a lever to lift the stuck wheel, with Nan joining in to help. Slowly, the wheel began to rise. There was no suction holding it down, just a tree root in the way. Flames burst out again, but with the rain slowing, the wind fanned the fire.

Tom urgently directed his team towards the main road that cut through the tamarack swamp. Pine Camp lay at one end, while the other direction led to the Vanderwillers' knoll and a more frequented road to the forks and the railway. Pine Camp was the closest place to seek assistance to control the fire, with a telephone line that could relay news of the forest fire across the Big Woods settlements and the railway.

Old Mrs. Vanderwiller prepared dinner and insisted they eat before heading to Pine Camp. Tom ate eagerly while his horses enjoyed their corn.

Glow worms and phosphorescent stumps lit their path. The swamp at night was new to Nan, with frogs hiding from the rain. Ghostly sounds filled the air as they traversed Pine Camp.
