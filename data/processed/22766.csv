"Topic: Measuring Instruments and Electrical Circuits

---

In the study of electricity, various measuring instruments are used to detect and measure current. One common device is the Detector, which helps determine the direction of the current flow. A simple current detector can be placed in different ways to accurately measure current.

Two types of voltameters, the Sulphuric Acid Voltameter and the Copper Voltameter, are used to measure electrical quantities. The Galvanoscope employs an electromagnetic method, while the Calorimeter and Light Method offer alternative ways to measure current.

When setting up electrical circuits, switches like the Two-Pole, Double-Pole, Sliding, Reversing, and Push Buttons are essential components. Electric bells, annunciators, and burglar alarms are also part of circuiting systems, providing safety and convenience in wiring up a house."|['1.

The mechanism in a telegraph circuit involves the sending key and the sounder. By connecting these components, two stations can communicate using the Morse Telegraph Code, which consists of dots and dashes. Vibrations are used in the acoustic telephone to transmit sound waves, converting them into electrical signals through a diaphragm in a magnetic field. A simple telephone circuit can be constructed using a microphone with light contact points. To make a microphone, one can follow simple steps. The microphone serves as the transmitter in this setup. Automatic cut-outs are used for telephones, ensuring proper circuiting with transmitters.

Electricity, similar to all sciences, has two sides: one is the theoretical understanding, and the other is the practical application. Boys are more inclined to learn through hands-on experience rather than just reading about it. For instance, telling a boy that electricity can be generated by joining two different metals and heating them might not be as engaging as letting him actually do it. When a boy is actively involved in experiments, like riveting metals together and observing the results with a galvanometer, he starts to question and understand the underlying principles. This hands-on approach helps him see the connection between different metals and their properties, leading him to explore the fundamental nature of matter. By engaging in practical work, boys naturally evolve into thinkers and reasoners, exploring the intricate world of electricity and its relation to various natural phenomena.|['1.

In 1747, Sir William Watson ignited gunpowder using an electric spark, sparking a series of groundbreaking experiments. Galvani's 1790 discovery led to galvanic or voltaic electricity, later linked to frictional electricity. Poisson analyzed electricity in 1805, and Ørsted's 1820 revelation of electricity's magnetic effects propelled the field forward. Ampere theorized about motors powered by electromagnetic currents, while Faraday uncovered electro-magnetic rotation around 1830. The evolution of electricity accelerated rapidly, culminating in Ohm's law, Thomson's galvanometer, and Wheatstone's rheostat by 1850. Instruments like the electrometer and voltmeter furthered progress. The narrative underscores the importance of practical experimentation over mere speculation, urging students to engage in hands-on learning to truly grasp electrical concepts.|"[""1.

When a magnet is severed in the middle, each part becomes a magnet with a new north and south pole. If the parts are placed close together, they attract; if one part is reversed, they repel. Positive and negative electricity are associated with the north and south poles. Magnetic lines of force pass through the bar and then through the atmosphere. Air is a poor conductor, so finding a shorter way to conduct the current increases magnet efficiency. The north magnetic pole is near the earth's rotational pole. When a small magnet is suspended within the magnetic field of a large magnet, it aligns north-south. A magnet's power of attraction is the same at both ends. Armatures on magnets are attracted to and held by magnetic influence.|['1.

When electricity flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field that can magnetize an iron core within its influence. This phenomenon is used in constructing various electrical devices like motors and dynamos. The wire coil is insulated from the core, and the current passing through it is called a conduction current. The induced current in the core moves in the opposite direction. Similarly, if two parallel wires have currents flowing in opposite directions, they induce currents in each other. Early experiments with electricity involved frictional means to produce a current stored in jars. These accumulated charges could only be discharged instantaneously. An apparatus was designed with a glass disc, leather collectors, and rods to generate and collect electricity for discharge.|['1. What happens when electricity flows through a wire?\nA.

Resistance is opposition to the flow of an electric current. It can be internal if it comes from the electrolyte or external if it occurs through the wire. The strength of the current is measured in amperes, while the force causing it to flow is measured in volts. Current is often referred to as ampere flow, and electromotive force (EMF) is used instead of voltage. Electro-magnetic electricity is generated through electro-magnets, utilizing induction for magnetic action. When metal is in the path of an electric current, it creates an electrified field around it. By moving another metal piece through this field, a current is generated. Dynamos work on the principle of moving a field of force through another field to generate electricity. Different types of dynamos produce various currents, such as high voltage-low amperage or vice versa, direct current for lighting and power, and alternating current for transmission. The construction of magnets for dynamos involves steel cores with pole pieces and wire coils for insulation.|['1.

"**Electric Dynamo Components Explained**

The armature winding involves creating cylindrical members by riveting plates with holes around a central block, where insulated wires are wound. To mount the armature, a brass disc with a stem is made for rotation. The commutator consists of a wooden cylinder with a tube attached, cut to form two tubular surfaces, mounted on bearings with iron blocks. Commutator brushes are attached using a horizontal bar and metal arms with adjusting screws.

The field may be excited by a cell or battery, making it a ""separately excited"" dynamo. In a series-wound dynamo, the field wires are connected in series with the armature brushes.

A compound-wound dynamo, shown in Fig. 33, has two windings. The regular field winding (J) is connected to the armature brushes. Another winding (K, K') connects to the lighting circuit. Wire (L) completes the lighting circuit. To measure electric current, we need instruments like a galvanometer. This device detects current and its direction. When a current passes through a wire near a magnet, like in Fig. 35, the magnet moves. The direction of the current affects the magnet's movement. If the current flows from right to left, the magnet moves clock-wise. If reversed, it moves counter-clockwise. A pointer (G) shows the current flow. To create a simple galvanometer, follow the instructions in Fig. 37 and Fig. 38 using a base, wire coil, blocks, nails, and a bridge made of brass.|"['1.

In the middle of the bridge, there is a slot to hold the magnet's pivot pin. To secure the pin, use an H-shaped brass piece that wraps around the bridge. The magnet is made of steel, while the pivot pin is an ordinary pin. Attach a small disc to the pin and seal it to the magnet using wax. A pointer is soldered to the pin, perpendicular to the magnet. A glass cover should be placed on top to prevent displacement. When the detector is aligned north-south, it points in that direction due to Earth's magnetism. When an electric current flows through the coil, the magnet deflects, indicating the current's direction. Another method to measure current strength is the Sulphuric Acid Voltameter. By decomposing an acid solution and measuring the gas produced, current strength can be determined accurately. The preferred methods ensure chemical effects are independent of apparatus size or shape. A simple form of the sulphuric acid voltameter involves platinum plates in a jar with a weak acid solution. The copper voltameter uses copper plates in a copper sulfate solution to measure current strength by weighing the plates before and after the current passes through.|"['1.

In the study of electricity, various methods are used to measure its intensity and quantity. One such method involves comparing the strength of different currents by passing them through a voltameter for the same duration. This ensures accurate results. It is important to note that the shape, size, and distance between plates do not affect the gas produced or the amount deposited or eaten away in different methods. The galvanoscope and calorimeter methods have their disadvantages due to the need for precise construction and winding. Terms like voltage, amperage, and watts are crucial in understanding electricity measurement standards. For instance, a kilowatt is derived by multiplying volts and amperes, serving as a standard for dynamo and motor rating. The ampere standard involves passing a current through a solution to deposit silver, while the ohm standard measures resistance based on conductor size.|['1.

The ohm is a unit of electrical resistance. The International Ohm is commonly used and is calculated using a column of pure mercury that is 106.3 millimeters long and weighs 14.4521 grams. This column would be about 94 inches long and slightly over 1/25 of an inch in diameter, resulting in a resistance of 1 ohm. To calculate voltage, a conductor with a resistance of 1 ohm that produces 1 ampere is needed. The volt is the practical unit of electromotive force. Simple switches are essential for practical electrical work. A base block with binding screws and switch bars made of copper or brass are used to create connections.

The push button, in its basic form, consists of an insulating circular base (A) with a rectangular contact plate (B) and a spring finger (C) that is normally not touching the plate. When pressed, the finger makes contact with the plate. The button is enclosed in a casing. To understand electrical work, one must create a battery, electromagnets, a switch, and learn to connect them using push buttons. An electric bell (Fig. 49) has electro-magnets (C, C), an armature (D), and a clapper arm (G). When the current passes through, the armature is attracted to the magnets, causing the clapper to strike the bell. The vibrating armature breaks and re-establishes the circuit rapidly, creating the bell sound. To make the bell, ensure proper insulation and use a return spring for the clapper. Annunciators are constructed using a wooden box with a magnet and an armature that moves to expose a numeral plate when activated by the magnet.|['1.

Accumulator plates are essential components made of red lead for positive plates and precipitated lead for negative plates. Lead grids are used to hold these materials effectively. The grid, typically square with a wing and hole, is about a quarter-inch thick. The positive plate is created by mixing red lead and sulfuric acid into a stiff paste, pressing it onto the grid, drying, and converting it into lead peroxide. The negative plate is filled with precipitated lead made by placing zinc in an acetate of lead solution to form crystals. The cell setup includes glass, porcelain, or hard rubber with five plates, holding positive and negative plates apart using tubing and bolts. The acid used is pure sulfuric acid diluted with water. Charging the cells requires a minimum of 2.5 volts per cell, and the cells can be arranged in series or parallel for charging with the appropriate voltage.|['1.

To charge a battery using a dynamo, connect the positive poles of both the dynamo and the battery, and do the same for the negative poles. Run the dynamo slightly above the battery voltage, ensuring at least a 125-volt requirement for 50 parallel cells. Charge the battery for 36-40 hours initially, then let it stand for 12-15 hours. Recharge until the positive plates turn chocolate and the negative plates turn slate or gray, releasing large gas bubbles. In a charging circuit, lamps in parallel are used to charge the battery. For example, if a dynamo gives 110 volts and a 4-volt accumulator needs 2 amperes, connect four 16-candle-power 105-volt lamps in parallel.

"TO CONNECT THE KEY AND SOUNDER

After creating the key and sounder, the next step is to link them in the circuit. Each end of the line should have a battery, a key, and a sounder. In Fig. 69, you'll see two groups of these instruments. The wires connect them together. One line wire (A) connects the two batteries, with one end linking to the positive terminal and the other to the negative. The other line wire (B) between the stations connects to the terminals of the sounders' electro-magnet C. The electro-magnet terminals are connected to each key terminal by wire (D), and each key's other terminal has a wire (E) to its battery. When the operator at station 2 closes switch F' and the operator at station 1 opens switch F, the sounder operates at both ends. The double click of the sounder is crucial for the receiving operator to distinguish between dots and dashes. The downward movement of the lever in the key and the bar in the sounder produce a sharp click, while the return creates a dull click. The operator will learn to recognize dots and dashes by the timing of the clicks.

In the diagram shown in Fig. 71, we see that when bar A falls onto spring B, it compresses the spring until the bar reaches line C. The spring's elasticity then propels the bar back up. Similarly, electricity behaves elastically, aiding induction in a coil for better efficiency. In Fig. 73, a high-tension circuit is depicted with coils and a condenser. To create a current interrupter, assemble a toothed wheel on a wooden base with a crankshaft. By rotating the wheel, the current is momentarily broken, creating interruptions based on wheel speed. Wireless telegraphy uses the principles of electricity, magnetism, and light to transmit messages through the ether, a substance that fills space.

The induction coil has a primary coil with a wire (B) connected to a telegraph key post. Another key post (C) connects to a battery. The other battery side connects to the primary's other terminal via wire (D). The secondary coil links to a binding post (E) and another post (G) with adjustable rods and knobs (F, H). A wire (I) from post (E) acts as an aerial wire. It connects to one side of a condenser via a conductor (J). The ground wire (K) links to post (G), and a branch wire (L) connects the ground wire (K) to a condenser end. The receiving station lacks a condenser, induction coil, or key. When in use, the coherer switch closes, and the galvanometer shows the current when the telegraph sounder operates. When the key is pressed, a circuit forms from the battery through wire B to the primary coil and back through wire D. The secondary coil energizes, causing a disturbance in the ether when the current leaps across the gap between knobs (F, H). This sets up vibrations transmitted through space. Nature's manifestations occur through vibrations. Sound, taste, and color reach our senses through vibrations. Electricity and magnetism are vibrations of different wave lengths.

"In the chapter on magnetism, it was explained that the magnetic field extends beyond a magnet. If we could see magnetism, a magnet's end would seem like a moving field. The magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 80, appears at one end but is similar at both. It extends far and has a wide influence. 

When a diaphragm is placed in this magnetic field near a magnet's end, its movement disturbs the field. If the diaphragm vibrates due to sound waves, the disturbance affects the magnetic field at both ends in the same way. This concept led to the invention of the telephone. By connecting two magnets in a circuit, disturbances in one diaphragm affect the other similarly.

"When electricity is passed through a liquid, a process called electrolysis occurs, leading to the decomposition of the liquid into its original components. For instance, when water undergoes electrolysis, it breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen gases. This separation happens because hydrogen is released at the negative pole, while oxygen is released at the positive pole. By utilizing a simple apparatus with a glass or earthen jar and electrodes, one can generate pure oxygen and hydrogen gases. This process can be used not only to create these gases but also to purify water. Oxygen, a vital element in this process, is known as the ""acid-maker of the universe."" By bubbling oxygen gas through water, harmful germs can be destroyed, as oxygen becomes an active agent in this form. While common air can somewhat purify water, it is not as effective as oxygen gas due to its lower oxygen content."|['1.

The use of hydrogen in water purification is crucial. Hydrogen, when used with aluminum electrodes, helps in the purification process due to aluminum's purifying properties. The aluminum electrodes create a flocculent substance that moves through the water, trapping germs and organic matter. This substance settles to the bottom after releasing gases, carrying decomposed matter with it. An electric hand purifier can be easily made using three pieces of sheet aluminum. By assembling these pieces with bolts and wires, the device can be used in water to demonstrate electrolysis.

Electroplating is a fascinating process where a less expensive metal can be coated with a more valuable one using electrolysis. For example, iron can be plated with copper to prevent rust. To do this, a dynamo with high amperage is needed, along with a copper solution like cyanide or sulphate. The iron is cleaned and placed in the solution, connected to a copper sheet called the anode. A direct current flows through the copper plate to the iron, depositing a thin copper film. The process is slow with cyanide, so it's switched to a sulphate solution for a thicker layer. Different metals have varying resistance to electricity, affecting heat generation in conductors like wires. Materials like copper are preferred due to their cost-effectiveness compared to others like aluminum.|['1.

To set up a resistance wire heater, coil the wire to a suitable length based on the current needed. Secure one end by wrapping it around a screw and bring the other end through the coil to fasten it to another screw. Ensure the coils do not touch. Immerse the coil in water, turn on the current, and heat the water. To determine the right coil length and wire size, build a wooden base and mount four electric lamp sockets. Connect the inlet wire to all sockets on one side and the outlet wire to the other side. Each 16-candlepower lamp equals half an ampere. An electric iron is made similarly, using a high resistance wire wound around a slate spool.

In this lesson, we explore the concept of electric currents and how they behave in different scenarios. When a thermo-electric couple is joined and a difference in temperature exists between its ends, a current is generated. This current flows in one direction continuously, known as a direct current, when produced by a cell. On the other hand, when generated by a dynamo, the current alternates direction. Understanding the basics of alternating currents is crucial for comprehending the operation of various electrical devices. We also delve into the magnetic field's influence on electric currents. When a wire moves through a magnet's magnetic field, it induces a charge of electricity. Additionally, we discuss how the current in a charged wire reverses direction as it interacts with the magnetic field, leading to alternating flow patterns.|"['Question 1:\nWhat type of current flows continuously in one direction when produced by a cell?\nA) Static current\nB) Alternating current\nC) Direct current\nD) Induced current\nE) Magnetic current', 'Question 2:\nWhen is a current generated by a dynamo said to alternate direction?\nA) When a difference in temperature exists\nB) When produced by a cell\nC) When flowing continuously\nD) When a wire moves through a magnetic field\nE) When interacting with a magnetic field', 'Question 3:\nWhat is crucial for comprehending the operation of various electrical devices?\nA) Understanding the basics of static currents\nB) Understanding the basics of magnetic currents\nC) Understanding the basics of direct currents\nD) Understanding the basics of induced currents\nE) Understanding the basics of alternating currents', ""Question 4:\nWhat happens when a wire moves through a magnet's magnetic field?\nA) A static charge is generated\nB) A direct current is induced\nC) An alternating current is produced\nD) A charge of electricity is induced\nE) A magnetic field is disrupted"", 'Question 5:\nWhat happens to the current in a charged wire as it interacts with a magnetic field?\nA) It remains constant\nB) It increases\nC) It decreases\nD) It reverses direction\nE) It becomes static', 'Question 6:\nWhat do alternating flow patterns result from when a wire interacts with a magnetic field?\nA) Continuous current\nB) Static charge\nC) Direct current\nD) Reversal of current direction\nE) Induced magnetic field']"|['C) Direct current', 'E) When interacting with a magnetic field', 'E) Understanding the basics of alternating currents', 'D) A charge of electricity is induced', 'D) It reverses direction', 'D) Reversal of current direction']
Self-induction is the tendency of a current to reverse itself, also known as inductance. By using multiple loops and magnets, we can increase the number of alternating periods in each second. Time plays a crucial role in the operation of alternating currents. Connecting and building a dynamo involves using contact fingers on bearings to attach circuit wires. In a direct-current dynamo, brushes and a commutator convert the wire's inductance into a current that flows consistently in one direction. The commutator has split terminals, positive and negative, which the armature wire connects to. Brushes contact these terminals to ensure the current flows in the desired direction. This process prevents the current from reversing direction, allowing it to flow continuously through the external circuit.|['1.

An alternating current changes the poles from positive to negative due to its surging movement. Imagine a line (A) as the zero line with no electricity. The current, shown by a zigzag line (B), goes above A as positive and below as negative. At A, the polarity switches, reaching maximum intensity at D above zero and at E in the opposite direction. If it takes one second to go from C to F, it only takes half a second to go from C to G. In constructing an alternating dynamo, a frame (A) holds field magnet cores (B), while the armature shaft (C) carries magnet cores (E). Wires are wound around magnet cores in alternating directions, with armature wires connected to form north (N) and south (S) poles.

In diagram 115, the core is shaped like an 'O,' allowing a primary winding (A) from the electrical source to be wrapped around one limb, while the secondary winding (B) is wound around the other limb. The wires supplying power to the lamps come from the secondary coil. The primary and secondary coils are not electrically connected; instead, energy is transferred through induction. When a current flows through the primary coil, the iron core transmits this energy to the secondary coil. The voltage produced by the secondary coil depends on factors like the strength of magnetism, current frequency, and the number of wire turns. By varying the number of turns in the coils, the voltage output can be adjusted. Increasing voltage doesn't mean more electricity; it's about balancing voltage and amperage.

The lamp commonly used to light vast areas like streets and railway stations is the arc lamp, which also serves as searchlight illumination and locomotive headlights. Arc lights operate on a series current, where lamps are connected in a single line. In contrast, the incandescent system functions differently. It relies on the principle that certain metals conduct electricity more easily and become heated when electricity passes through them. In the incandescent system, a small wire heats up and fuses if it cannot carry the current passing through it, as demonstrated in Fig. 118. To address this, a new wiring system, the multiple circuit, was introduced to reduce costs and simplify the installation of electric lights by dividing the amperage among lamps.
