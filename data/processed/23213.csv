Uncle Wiggily enjoyed his time in his cozy hollow-stump bungalow in the woods. On days with nothing to do, he would take a ride in his makeshift airship made from a clothes-basket and toy circus balloons. Alternatively, he would cruise in his automobile with bologna sausages for tires. To speed up, he sprinkled pepper on the sausages. Equipped with soft cushions and warm mittens, Uncle Wiggily embarked on his airship adventure. As he soared over the treetops, he noticed a lady with a tall hat and a broom perched on a big gander.

Uncle Wiggily promised to get the doctor immediately. He rushed to Dr. Possum's house but found out he was attending to Jillie Longtail, who had the mouse-trap fever. When Uncle Wiggily returned to Mother Goose, she exclaimed that Dr. Possum was not available. Concerned, they needed to help Jack, who was upset because he couldn't remove his thumb from a plum. Eventually, Jack Horner managed to eat the plum stuck on his thumb. Uncle Wiggily, after putting the button-hook away, headed back to his hollow-stump bungalow, concluding his adventure. Everything turned out fine in the end. Next, he planned to share a story about Uncle Wiggily and Mr. Pop-Goes. Mrs. Littletail asked Uncle Wiggily to fetch items from the store despite the storm. He gladly obliged, donning his fur coat and using his corn-stalk crutch. At the store, he requested bread and sugar for Mrs. Littletail. The monkey-doodle gentleman, the store owner, cheerfully obliged. Amidst their interaction, a toy balloon popped, surprising them.|['1.
