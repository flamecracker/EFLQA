Once upon a time, on a big plantation in the heart of Middle Georgia, there lived a little girl named Sweetest Susan, a little boy named Buster John, and their playful companion, the twelve-year-old Drusilla. Sweetest Susan, with her serious dark eyes and black hair, was always full of fun, while Buster John, with his golden hair and mischievous brown eyes, was never far from trouble. Drusilla, as black as the old black cat, was always in a good mood except when pretending to be angry. The children, fearless and adventurous, spent most of their days outdoors, only retreating inside when the weather forced them. Sweetest Susan cherished her many dolls, each with a special place by her bedside each night, until one evening when she went to bed in tears after being scolded by her mother. This rare event left her dolls out of place, a sign of her troubled heart.|"['1.

Drusilla lay on a mat near Sweetest Susan's bed, wide awake. The fire flickered, casting shadows that seemed to move. Suddenly, a tiny old lady emerged from behind the andirons. Sweetest Susan watched in amazement as a big Black Spider dangled near the old lady's face. Without a scream, Sweetest Susan observed the old lady use mutton suet and cobwebs to mend Rag-Tag's back. She then tended to each doll, fixing their flaws with care. The old lady turned to Sweetest Susan and asked about the giantess mistreating the dolls. A black cat joined them, purring and rubbing against the old lady. Frustrated, the old lady tried to shoo the cat away.|"[""1.

"The large Black Cat halted abruptly and declared, ""Stop! I know your purpose here. Notice my eyes, as green as grass. My teeth, strong as iron. My claws, sharp as needles.

After breakfast, Buster John and the children gathered on the wood-pile to discuss the peculiar encounter. The boy, filled with curiosity, bombarded them with questions.

As they approached the spring, Mr. Thimblefinger led the way with impressive speed. Drusilla gently warned Sweetest Susan to be cautious of him, fearing he might lead them into the water. Luckily, no one was around as Mr. Thimblefinger confidently moved forward, followed closely by the children, although Drusilla hesitated a bit. When they reached the spring, Mr. Thimblefinger took out a small watch, captivating the children's attention, especially Buster John, excited for a unique adventure. Following Mr. Thimblefinger's instructions, Buster John reached into the water but felt nothing, only seeing it. He tried again with the same result, even plunging his arm in, yet his sleeve remained dry. Encouraging them to join, Mr. Thimblefinger gestured from the spring's bottom, prompting Buster John and eventually Sweetest Susan to cautiously enter, experiencing a strange but thrilling sensation.

Once upon a time, two children, Drusilla and Buster John, stumbled upon a peculiar house. The house was quite large, resembling more of a barn than a typical home. Despite its appearance, the children were eager to find shelter and food, as they had missed their dinner. As they approached, they noticed a strange sight that filled them with fear. An old woman sat knitting, accompanied by a Rabbit as big as a man, smoking a pipe. The old woman, Mrs. Meadows, welcomed them warmly, while the Rabbit, Mr. Rabbit, made curious remarks about Drusilla resembling the Tar Baby. Drusilla, offended, asserted her identity, claiming she was older than the Tar Baby tale itself. The Rabbit, with failing eyesight, insisted on the similarity.

The mayor was astonished when the coachman implored for mercy and revealed the truth about the unfaithful servants. The mayor handed them over to an officer and set up a watch around his house and stable, leading to the capture of the thieves and their accomplices. Mrs. Meadows explained that stories sometimes contain harmless fibs for entertainment. Two peculiar children, a girl and a boy, were playfully chasing each other until they noticed the children at the table and stopped abruptly. After an admonishment from Mr. Rabbit, the children bowed awkwardly and walked away, trying hard not to laugh.

The Mayor warned Tip-Top about a notorious thief planning to steal his brother's racehorse. Tip-Top, determined to protect the horse, visited the stable with the Mayor. The horse was heavily guarded by six men, including the Mayor's brother. Through clever communication, Tip-Top discovered that one guard was in cahoots with the thief. A secret signal was exchanged, and Tip-Top pretended not to notice. Later, Tip-Top shared a plan with the Mayor to catch the thief in the act. That night, the guards, anxious about the impending theft, waited vigilantly. However, as time passed without any sign of the thief, they grew weary and decided to take turns resting.

A thief and his accomplice drugged the wine to steal a horse. They put three watchers to sleep and took the horse. The thief got worried about leaving the saddle behind, so he returned. The horse's owner, Tip-Top, woke up and caught the thief. Tip-Top then found out where the thief was supposed to meet his partner the next day. He informed the Mayor and his brother, who captured the thief. The thief begged for forgiveness and promised to turn honest. With Tip-Top's help, the thief found success in business.

"Before Buster John could speak further, the surroundings dimmed slightly, and a massive shadow appeared in the sky, which should have been the spring's bottom. The children gazed at it quietly, feeling a sense of unease. The shadow, though not very dark, stirred their alarm. Despite the familiar sights and sounds, they couldn't shake off the memory of their journey through the spring. Drusilla summed up their unease by saying she felt ""skittish."" They hurried to the door to investigate the cause of the shadow. Looking up, they noticed a large jug's vague outline dominating the sky.

The kids glanced at each other sheepishly, then started singing a sorrowful tune together. It went like this: Imagine living alone in a shoe's toe, where you could hop, skip, and dance carefree. Or dwelling in a pantry, enjoying jelly and scaring mice. What about living underground, riding Mr. Mole and hearing crickets play? The children and the Looking-Glass kids pretended to play but didn't seem to have fun. Mrs. Meadows asked why, and Mr. Rabbit explained they were too similar yet raised differently.

In the morning, there was no news from the convention on the hill. Despite waiting and even taking an afternoon nap, there was still silence from the hill. Eventually, Mr. Rabbit laughed heartily, not because his feelings were hurt, but at the situation. Observing from afar, he discovered that the animals on the hill were arguing about the kind of rain they wanted. Brother Bear preferred a heavy rain, Brother Coon wanted a light rain, Brother Fox desired a heavy shower, and Brother Mink simply wanted a cloudy night for the frogs. Each animal had a different preference for the weather. The animals' disagreements led to a humorous situation where they all had different ideas about the rain they wanted.

In Mr. Thimblefinger's peculiar land, there were no astronomers, so the children weren't too scared by odd occurrences. Drusilla quickly figured out the mystery. The strange movements in the sky were due to lifting the buttermilk jug from the spring. Once the commotion settled, dark lines and shadows appeared across the sky. Drusilla observed them, puzzled. Suddenly, a shadow with a lively appearance darted among the dark lines, making Drusilla laugh. Mrs. Meadows pondered about grooming Brother Bear.

One day, while strolling down the road, I unexpectedly encountered old Brother Bear. I anticipated a confrontation, but it turned out differently. Brother Bear was cordial, and we conversed about the crops. However, I sensed he had a weighty matter on his mind. Eventually, he sat down and inquired about my well-groomed hair. He confessed that his wife admired my hair and wanted him to emulate it. I humorously explained that my head was chopped off daily, combed meticulously, and then reattached. Brother Bear, eager to please his wife, tried the method. Unfortunately, a mishap occurred, and the axe fell on his neck.

Three Wits followed the old man's instructions and rode the Stag down the road, with the dogs trailing behind. Passersby were surprised to see a boy on a big Stag and retreated into the woods. As he approached the witch's house, all was quiet except for a black cat. Three Wits circled the house on the Stag and threw bobbins over the roof, causing it to collapse. Out emerged Three Wits' father and elegantly dressed men who thanked him and rewarded him with gold. The father was overjoyed and proud of his brave son. As they celebrated, the old man appeared, blessed Three Wits, and then vanished into the woods. Mrs. Meadows shared this tale, likening it to a story about a little girl, emphasizing that real life can be just as magical as stories.|"[""1.

Once upon a time, in a land where the Meadows family often resided due to its scenic beauty, there lived a young girl who was both lovely and kind. She didn't fit the typical image of a storybook princess with golden locks but had a unique charm with her curly black hair, large brown eyes, and creamy complexion. Her parents, though wealthy, cherished her more than their riches. They ensured her happiness and upbringing with utmost care. One day, while strolling in the garden, she met the gardener's wife, whose warmth captivated her. The girl insisted on having her as a nurse, which surprised her parents. Eventually, the gardener's wife became her nurse, and the girl found joy in her company. However, her mother grew concerned about her close bond with the gardener's son and decided to limit their interaction.|"['1.

The nurse agreed with the little girl's mother, but she wasn't happy that her son couldn't play with any girl. After thinking for days, she decided to quit her job to be with her son.

Once upon a time, an old man left a little girl by a spring and a pomegranate-tree under a strange spell. The girl was thirsty, hungry, and tired. Feeling the old man was stingy, she drank water from the spring and ate a pomegranate. Little did she know, the spring and tree belonged to a Conjurer who cast a spell. When she drank and ate, the Conjurer's water bowl shook, and the little bush in his cave swayed. The Conjurer found her, carried her to his cave, and she disappeared for days. Meanwhile, the girl's nurse, searching for her, found the gardener at the gate. Determined to find the girl, she ventured into the house but couldn't find her.|"['1.

In a short time, there was a big commotion. The household staff scurried around the house, yard, and garden looking for the little girl. Despite searching every possible hiding spot, she was nowhere to be found. The girl's father arrived just in time to hear the news and suspected foul play. He decided to keep a close eye on the nurse, believing she had taken his daughter in hopes of a reward. Without revealing his thoughts, he instructed a trusted clerk to pose as a peddler and investigate the nurse's home to uncover the child's whereabouts. The clerk was surprised to find genuine grief at the nurse's house, where both she and her son were distraught over the girl's disappearance. The clerk's attempt to gather information was met with anger, but a chance encounter with an old man led to a revelation that could solve the mystery.|"[""1.

Early the next morning, the boy, guided by Keen-Point, resumed his journey. As he grew thirsty, he approached a spring near a pomegranate-tree. There, he encountered a traveler enjoying the water and fruit. The traveler kindly engaged the boy in conversation, learning about his origins and destination. The traveler mentioned the region being under the rule of a cruel Conjurer, except for those who find the spring and tree. The boy discreetly used Keen-Point to reveal the way beyond the spring, then continued his path. Looking back, he realized the traveler was likely the Conjurer.

Valentine was instructed by Keen-Point to move straight ahead, carrying Butch and Cob-Handle.
