Pat was a skilled dancer and found himself caught in a magical dance with fairies. Despite his exhaustion, the fairies continued dancing, and Pat struggled to break free from the enchantment. A kind fairy lent him a pair of shoes that miraculously fit him perfectly and relieved his blisters. Pat's newfound wealth from the fairies' dance led him to order new shoes. When a greedy shoemaker heard of Pat's adventure, he decided to dance with the fairies himself. The shoemaker danced until dawn, and the fairies gave him shoes that he couldn't remove.
