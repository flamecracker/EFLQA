The idea quickly spread among the group in the woods, and eventually, the girls agreed to leave some food for the rabbits and head to the hotel. As they made their way, a woman blocked Cora's path, causing her to stumble. The woman, noticing Cora's appearance and demeanor, remarked on her leadership qualities and connection to automobiles before walking away. Meanwhile, Ed called for the bus driver, Silent Bill, known for his constant chatter. Silent Bill wasted no time in guiding the horses and sharing the marvels of the White Mountains. That evening, a dance was planned at the hotel, marking the end of the season. The young women, relying on their youth and charm, put together simple yet elegant outfits for the event. The young men, lacking formal attire, still managed to look sharp in summer clothes. After a dance, Ed received a message, prompting a break on the porch with Cora.|"['1.

Ed insisted on sounding the alarm first before investigating further. He believed finding Cora was the priority, even if it meant people's nerves would have to wait. Suspecting a fake message to lure him away from Cora, he suggested involving the hotel manager. The situation left Jack anxious about Cora's disappearance. Ed awkwardly informed others about the incident, revealing a blank message that distracted him while Cora vanished. The chef was outraged by missing silver and money, prompting a thorough search. Mr. Blake organized a search party while Belle needed medical attention due to the stress. Bess struggled with the idea of losing Cora and remembered the mysterious face at the window.|"[""1.

Mr. Rand, after listening to all the details, asked the porter for a donkey as he felt more comfortable riding one over hills. The sudden disappearance of Cora had caused fear and panic among everyone. Cora was believed to be held against her will, and her whereabouts were unknown. Meanwhile, in a gypsy wagon, Cora was being taken away by desperate members of the clan. The night grew darker as they evaded the searchers. Cora, under the effect of chloroform, tried to stay calm as she was carried away. Awakening to a woman who claimed to be the gypsy queen, Cora felt a mix of fear and fascination.

Cora found herself in an unfamiliar place, realizing she had been taken against her will. Despite feeling like a prisoner, she followed the woman's advice to avoid questions around the other girls.

"""I care for you and want to be your friend,"" the voice reassured as it leaned in close. ""I understand your pain. It's natural. Let me offer you some mineral water to calm your nerves."" The room brightened as the figure in the white robe moved to a cabinet. Cora noticed the gypsy's delicate, snowy-white attire, making her resemble a living statue.

""I'm eager to help. Nursing has always fascinated me. It's a chance to shine. If I can make you feel better, it's enough for me,"" Cora expressed. The gypsy sat beside her, gently waving her hands in front of Cora's eyes. Although Cora worried about being hypnotized, the gesture felt comforting. Thoughts faded as drowsiness crept in.

"Once, Cora crossed paths with a queen-like figure riding in a grand procession. Intrigued, the mysterious figure managed to send Cora a note, leading to a secret rendezvous in the park where they were staying. Since then, their connection had grown, but the time apart felt endless to Cora.

During a quiet moment, Cora watched as the girl serving them placed a linen tablecloth on the ground, following the unique customs of their nomadic lifestyle. The queen, graceful and agile like a forest creature, sat beside Cora as they shared a meal. The berries were fresh, the milk served in a clean bowl, a testament to the queen's resources.

Engaging in conversation, the queen offered watercress, a luxury she believed was scarce in America, enhancing their simple meal.

Cora sighed as she spoke of the splendid hotel they had stayed at. She expressed her disappointment at not being able to invite her friend or even return herself. The queen, enjoying some berries, reassured Cora that nothing is impossible in Gypsy land. She advised Cora to be patient, teaching her the value of waiting. The queen hinted at the need for Cora to become a Gypsy and warned against hasty decisions. Cora, changing the subject, asked about the queen's indoor activities and their impact on her complexion. The queen mentioned walking in the woods but expressed concerns about Cora's trustworthiness. Cora observed the billiard parlor converted into a large room with oriental decor, including hardwood floors and exotic rugs. Lena brought robes for Cora, setting up a dressing area with a mirror that caught Cora's eye. Helka noted that Cora's dark features would help her blend in and be safe among the tribe.

Helka was excited about the new tribe, hoping for more freedom. However, she knew to be cautious around the powerful old woman who held influence over all the American gypsies. Despite pretending to be powerful, Helka couldn't help but feel the woman's authority. The old woman, Mother Hull, searched for Cora, suspecting she was hiding behind a screen. Helka teased Mother Hull about her warnings, but she also admired the bracelet she received as a gift. Mother Hull expressed her efforts to reform, even giving up smoking for the day. Meanwhile, Mr. Rand assured Mrs. Kimball that Cora's disappearance would be resolved soon.

Bess, the next in command after Cora in the Motor Girls' Club, chose the path through the woods for their adventure. Despite objections from her sister, she led the group up a rough and shaggy pass. As they navigated the newly made road, stones kept rolling under the wheels, making the journey challenging. Mr. Rand, searching for a lost girl, approached a forest ranger for information. The ranger explained that due to forest laws, camps were not allowed deep in the woods, reducing the chances of the missing girl being found by gypsies. As they rested, Cora prepared to sing to show her confidence, while planning a risky night-time escape using a rope and a signal for her friends to follow.|"['1.

"""I will sing,"" Cora whispered. ""Look, the stars are appearing. The night will guide us. I've memorized every twist in the path. I pretended to move stones from the grass, placing them where I could sense them in the dark."" The girls spoke softly, fearing even a word might expose them. Helka, overwhelmed at the idea of leaving her peculiar life forever, was visibly moved. ""I've never prayed,"" the queen admitted, ""but now I feel the need for strength from a higher power."" ""There is,"" Cora affirmed. ""Let's find joy. Look at the shimmering stars,"" she said, drawing back the drapes. ""And we'll have a bright moon to light our way.""
