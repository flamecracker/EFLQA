Jack and Hal, two ambitious boys, were discussing their plan to make their mark in the world. Jack, an orphan with a knack for machinery, had worked hard to pay for his schooling by doing odd jobs in his seaport town. Hal, on the other hand, faced challenges with an unkind stepmother and a father who paid little attention to him. Both boys decided to leave their town of Oakport to seek better opportunities. Carrying a camera outfit acquired by Hal in settlement of unpaid dues, they traveled from town to town, earning their living through photography. With some savings carefully hidden, they were determined to succeed. Jack was optimistic about the growing field of submarine torpedo boats and believed they could make their fortunes by seizing early opportunities and building their reputations.|"['Question 1:\nWhat does Jack do to pay for his schooling?\nA) He works as a photographer\nB) He does odd jobs in his seaport town\nC) He receives a scholarship\nD) He asks for donations\nE) He takes out a loan', 'Question 2:\nWhy did Hal acquire a camera outfit?\nA) To become a chef\nB) To pursue a career in fashion design\nC) In exchange for unpaid dues\nD) To start a jewelry business\nE) As a gift from a friend', 'Question 3:\nWhat challenges did Hal face in his family life?\nA) An unkind stepmother and a neglectful father\nB) Overbearing siblings\nC) Lack of access to education\nD) Financial struggles\nE) Health issues', 'Question 4:\nWhat field did Jack believe would bring them fortunes?\nA) Agriculture\nB) Photography\nC) Submarine torpedo boats\nD) Medicine\nE) Law', 'Question 5:\nHow did Jack and Hal earn their living while traveling?\nA) Selling handmade jewelry\nB) Working in restaurants\nC) Photography\nD) Performing music\nE) Teaching at schools', ""Question 6:\nWhat was one of the boys' main goals?\nA) To become famous actors\nB) To travel the world for leisure\nC) To win a photography contest\nD) To build their reputations and succeed\nE) To retire early""]"|['B) He does odd jobs in his seaport town', 'C) In exchange for unpaid dues', 'A) An unkind stepmother and a neglectful father', 'C) Submarine torpedo boats', 'C) Photography', 'D) To build their reputations and succeed']
Landlord Holt welcomed the boys into the hotel, where even eight dollars were valued. The boys freshened up in the washroom, preparing to meet their host. Excited about their future plans in submarine work, they were interrupted by a menacing youth named Dan Jaggers. A scuffle ensued as Dan tried to intimidate Jack, but Jack's agility and skill in boxing surprised Dan. Despite being smaller, Jack managed to land a few blows on Dan, leaving him in pain and defeated.

"Confined in a small space within a sturdy steel vessel, the noise, usually faint outside, became deafening inside. The human ears couldn't endure it for long. The boat, named ""Pollard,"" had a flat floor running its length with storage compartments below it. Water tanks beneath the floor could be filled to sink the boat or emptied to resurface. The boat ran on a powerful gasoline engine on the surface and electric power from batteries underwater. A torpedo tube in the bow could launch a Whitehead torpedo. The central cabin had a table and convertible berths. The engine room housed the motors and machinery. The crew had been working for over an hour, with Jack and Hal assisting.

"When the workmen were told to stop, they lit their pipes. Jack and Hal, disliking the smoke, hurried up the staircase to the platform. On their way, they met a man in his thirties who had just arrived. ""Mr. Owen,"" Pollard said to the foreman, ""we need the feed pipes from the gasoline tanks to the motor for the next job."" The foreman mentioned that a new pipe with the right specifications was needed. Jack suggested measuring and cutting the pipe at the machine shop in the yard. Mr. Farnum agreed and handed Jack a tape measure. Jack, Hal, and O'brien carried the pipe and cut it to the correct length with a new thread. Despite initial doubts, the pipe was fitted perfectly. Jack noticed the cement was too dry for sealing the joint, ensuring it wouldn't be properly sealed.

Jack chuckled as he handed Mr. Forrester an authorization paper to receipt the account. Politely, Jack requested a check since they had early business the next day. Mr. Forrester, feeling the young man's determination, hesitated about evading payment. He counted $950 in cash, considering banking it the next day.

Jacob Farnum carefully adjusted the submarine as it descended beneath the water's surface. The deck outside vanished from view as the boat's bow dipped, causing everyone to struggle to stay upright. With water filling the forward diving tanks, the submarine lurched downward like sliding down a slope. Farnum quickly opened other tanks' sea-valves to stabilize the boat, bringing it to a depth of forty feet. Despite the eerie darkness, the crew adapted to the sensation of moving smoothly underwater. Some felt nervous, but Jack Benson remained calm, eager to see how the submarine would resurface.

The builder, with confidence, believed they would resurface soon. Using a large compressed air container, they forced water out of the tanks. He showed a special wrench, designed for maximum force with minimal effort. Little did they know the wrench would play a crucial role later. David Pollard invited them to see for themselves. Eph, eager, tripped but quickly recovered. The gasoline motor started, engines throbbed, and the submarine moved. Jack stood by the wheel as they skimmed the ocean's surface. The searchlight revealed a sloop's hull with two men clinging to it. They seemed reluctant to be rescued. Benson found it odd and prepared to help.

The elderly man effortlessly navigated the water, aided by his life preserver. With one hand clutching his satchel, he used the other to pull himself along a slightly drooping rope. His son, Eph, swam beside him, holding onto the rail with one hand and assisting his father and son up to the deck with the other. Once they were safely on board, Hal released the line, and he and Jack swam back. Eph hoisted them up to the platform deck. Curious, Jack and Hal ventured below deck, followed by Eph. The father, still wet and holding onto his satchel, sat on a bench in the cabin, while the son paced anxiously. The father explained his urgent need to meet friends on a passing yacht.

"""Come up, Benson, and take the wheel,"" Mr. Pollard called. Jack headed to the deck with Eph, while Hal went to the engine room to observe Grant Andrews' work. Jack turned the speed wheel and steered north, as Eph directed the searchlight towards the approaching vessel. In fifteen minutes, the two crafts were visible to each other and within hailing distance shortly after. The other craft, an eighty or ninety-ton schooner, used an auxiliary gasoline engine.
