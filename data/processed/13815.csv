In ancient times, Eastern princes valued fables as guides for life's challenges. Aesop, an enigmatic figure from 2500 years ago, penned these enduring tales. Despite living over two millennia ago, Aesop's stories remain captivating. Scholars debate the origins of his works, with uncertainty surrounding his existence and writings. Aesop's fables were popular in Athens, where even Socrates and Plato found joy in them. Abraham Lincoln, too, drew inspiration from these tales. The tradition of storytelling through fables transcends cultures, with Buddhist priests in India sharing similar moral stories in Sanskrit. These fables, passed down through generations, eventually found their way into written form in various languages, offering timeless lessons on wisdom and conduct.|"[""1.

"In ancient times, Indian fables from Bidpai's collection fascinated readers, including the renowned French fabulist La Fontaine, who acknowledged the Indian sage's influence. Bidpai's name, meaning ""beloved physician,"" led to scholarly debates about his identity, with some suggesting he might have been one of the wise camels from earlier fables. The spirit of inquiry and wonder, seen in the youngest brother of fairy tales, triumphs over obstacles and leads to knowledge. Fables, like those from Aesop and the Hitopadesa, have endured through generations, migrating across cultures. La Fontaine, a master fabulist, crafted elegant and charming verses, drawing inspiration from Aesop, Phaedrus, and Oriental tales. Similarly, the Russian fable-maker Krilof, born in 1768, found fame through his verses, capturing the essence of peasant life in his stories.

"Aesop, a renowned fable-maker, left behind a legacy that still resonates today. Children playing around his monument evoke memories of ancient times when Greek children frolicked near Aesop's statue in Athens. Lysippus, a famed sculptor, immortalized Aesop's memory in bronze. Reading Krilof's fables like ""Education of a Lion"" and ""The Lion and the Mosquitoes"" while Aesop's tales are fresh in mind can transport one to different lands like Africa and India. Aesop's fables, with animals as characters, subtly convey moral lessons, making it easier for listeners to reflect on their own faults.

Once upon a time, a Camel and a Pig encountered two different gardens. In the first garden, the Camel, with his long neck, enjoyed a feast while the Pig couldn't enter due to the low wall. Mocking the Pig, the Camel asked if it would rather be tall or short. In the second garden, with a high wall and a gate, the Pig entered easily and ate to its heart's content, while the Camel couldn't fit through the gate.

Once upon a time, a clever Mouse-deer found himself in a perilous situation. A Heron, losing his temper, pecked a hole in their boat, causing it to sink. The Mouse-deer, struggling in the sea, was approached by a hungry Shark. However, the quick-witted Mouse-deer struck a deal with the Shark. Promising to teach the Shark magic that would eliminate the need to hunt for food, the Mouse-deer cleverly tied the Shark to a creeper and dragged him ashore, turning him into butcher's meat. Later, a Tiger arrived, seeking a meal. The Mouse-deer tricked the Tiger into preparing the meat, then slyly escaped with the Shark's share, leaving the Tiger empty-handed.

Once upon a time, a wise old Wolf was teaching its young Cub how to survive in the wild. The Wolf sent the Cub out to scout for food near the woods and instructed it to consider stealing from a nearby shepherd for their meal. Excitedly, the Cub returned, boasting of a flock of fat sheep ripe for the taking. However, the old Wolf cautioned against the risk, suggesting a safer target with a foolish shepherd and less vigilant dogs. In another tale, a mischievous Pike faced judgment for making a pond uninhabitable. The case was brought before a court of judges - two Donkeys, old Horses, a few Goats, and a Fox as an advisor. Despite rumors of the Pike feeding the Fox, justice prevailed, and the Pike was sentenced to a humiliating punishment. Lastly, a proud Cuckoo was promoted to a Nightingale but faced ridicule from other birds. Angered, the Cuckoo complained to an Eagle, who suggested a severe punishment to deter future mischief.|"['1.

Once upon a time, in the animal kingdom, there was a case where the Sheep was accused of eating the fowls. The Eagle, acting as a king, presided over the trial. The Sheep defended itself, claiming it was asleep all night and had never committed any wrongdoing before. However, upon investigation, it was found that the Sheep had the opportunity to eat the fowls as they were not separated. The Eagle decided that the Sheep would be put to death and its fleece given to the Plaintiff. This story teaches us that actions have consequences and that even the seemingly innocent can be held accountable.

The Cuckoo expressed her sorrow to the Dove, lamenting that her own offspring did not recognize her, unlike other animals that stick close to their mothers. She admitted to laying her eggs in other birds' nests instead of building her own. The Dove sympathized but couldn't imagine her own dovelets not loving her.

Once upon a time, in a village, a Wolf quarreled with everyone, leaving him with no protection. A wise Mole warned two Eagles not to build a nest on a rotten oak tree, but they ignored the advice due to their pride. Tragically, the oak fell, crushing the Eagle's mate and young ones. The Eagle regretted not listening to the Mole's counsel. Meanwhile, an envious Spider tried to compete with a successful Merchant by weaving goods for sale, but failed.

Once upon a time, a Secretary and a King had a disagreement over a beetle. The King believed that beetles were fit for kings, not common chickens. In a fit of anger, the King and the Secretary fought, causing the beetle to escape and hide in the grass. Later, when the King returned home, he found his fellow chickens had saved the best roosting spot for him. However, he was upset that they hadn't accompanied him to the wilderness earlier. The chickens decided they would no longer serve this ungrateful King and sought refuge in a vegetable garden. The King, still proud and defiant, refused to make amends. As he boasted about his royalty, an eagle swooped down, seizing the King in its talons, and carried him away, never to be seen again. The chickens, now under the care of a wise farmer named Ah-Po, lived happily ever after.|"['1.

Ah-Po decided not to harm the old Turtle, choosing to keep him in the barnyard instead. The Turtle coexisted peacefully with the Chickens for three months until one day when the young Chickens mocked him. They criticized the Turtle for taking up space, being unclean, and not contributing to the household. In response, the Turtle questioned why he was placed there against his will and reminded the Chickens that he did not choose to be there.

The animals in the barnyard had a discussion. The Chickens felt ashamed after being scolded by the Turtle for their greed. They realized that it is foolish to want everything and that they should live peacefully with each other. The Fox then boasted about its speed, mocking the Crab for being slow. The Crab challenged the Fox to a race and suggested weighing them to see who was heavier. The Fox, feeling superior, agreed to the race confidently.
