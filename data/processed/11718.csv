Aunt Phoebe's strict rules turned the once warm house into a gloomy place. The blinds stayed shut, blocking out the sun. No cozy fires crackled anymore, as they were seen as wasteful. Hinpoha was even forbidden from reading fiction during mourning. Instead, she had to read aloud from a boring history book to Aunt Phoebe. This led to constant criticism from Aunt Phoebe, making Hinpoha feel suffocated. Nyoda, Hinpoha's confidante, advised her to be patient and win her aunt's respect. Despite the dull routine, Nyoda tried to lighten the mood with a humorous remark. Hinpoha's Sundays were restricted to church and reading religious texts, leaving her yearning for freedom.

Mrs. Gardiner asked Migwan to buy porterhouse steaks and cream puffs for dessert. Migwan found only twenty-five cents in her mother's pocketbook. She decided against buying the cream puffs due to the limited money. Instead, she looked for ingredients at home and found dry prunes.

Mrs. Gardiner complimented Migwan for her knack of putting things together and suggested she should handle meals from now on.

Amid the chaos, a small boat carrying cheerful girls cruised up the dark river under the Winnebago flag. Following closely was a birchbark canoe with Sahwah at the helm. They passed lumber yards, chemical plants, and factories, marveling at the industrial landscape. Meanwhile, Hinpoha, left behind, captured bees in the garden. Aunt Phoebe noticed her thinness and took her for a drive. On the river, the Winnebagos marveled at the twists of the Cuyahoga River. They docked at a scenic gorge for lunch, surrounded by vibrant foliage. Nyoda spotted Hinpoha and Mrs. Evans on a cliff above, leading to a joyful reunion.|['1.

"At a chance meeting, Mrs. Evans stumbled upon her daughter and her friends, the Winnebagos, during a leisurely drive. The girls eagerly invited her to spend the day with them, but Hinpoha, feeling uncomfortable, hesitated. Mrs. Evans, determined to make the most of the situation, called Aunt Phoebe for permission to have Hinpoha stay with them.

In the forest, a loud shriek startled the group. Migwan had a frightening encounter with a bat in the kitchen, causing chaos. The girls laughed as the bat fluttered blindly around them, creating panic. Eventually, the bat settled back in the corner, and dinner resumed. Nyoda suggested a game where they listed items made in Cleveland alphabetically. Sahwah and Nyoda then took a canoe for a paddle in the river, relishing the joy of being on the water. Sahwah got carried away and found herself in danger near a dam, unable to steer the canoe back. The group watched in horror as Sahwah sped towards the rushing waters, realizing the imminent danger she was in.|['1.

The _Keewaydin_ swiftly accelerated, racing towards the falls as Sahwah heard the deafening roar. Near the edge, a rock split the current in two. The canoe veered sharply towards the shore, heading for the falls. A willow tree loomed overhead. Sahwah seized a branch, leaped from the canoe, and swung to safety. The girls, stunned, watched the empty canoe plunge over the falls. Nyoda scolded Sahwah for the reckless act. Feeling ashamed, Sahwah vowed to be more cautious. To distract from the scare, Mrs. Evans suggested visiting a dairy farm nearby. Excited, the girls piled into the car.

It seems they might be facing financial difficulties if they can't afford the private school anymore."" ""Maybe I shouldn't ask Mrs. Evans for a donation.

Migwan was ecstatic about the party plans, forgetting her lessons to focus on the dress. Mrs. Gardiner suggested dyeing it green or blue due to its yellow hue.

Sahwah teased her extravagance, contrasting it with her own silk poplin dress. Gladys kept her dress a secret, causing curiosity among the girls. Emily Meeks, a quiet girl, was invited to the party by Gladys out of kindness. On the night of the party, Migwan looked stunning in her finished dress and her mother's wedding slippers.

As she prepared, a large group of girls and boys arrived, and the orchestra began playing. Gladys was excited to dance the Butterfly Dance. However, she noticed Emily Meeks in a simple outfit, feeling out of place. Gladys realized how it must feel to stand out and be noticed for not fitting in.

Migwan, a resourceful and clever girl, found ways to save money and create unique gifts for her friends.

Hinpoha helped her friend Emily by fixing a damaged painting. When teachers and students were around, she had to hide the painting quickly. Hinpoha cleverly stashed it in a room with stage equipment. She retrieved it later and safely placed it back in the art room. Relieved that the painting was secure, she headed home happily. Meanwhile, Sahwah explored the set for an upcoming play. She admired a statue of Joan of Arc on the stage. The school was quiet and dark as evening set in. Sahwah's curiosity led her to the stage, where she took in the grandeur of the statue.|['1.

Sahwah, a curious girl, found herself trapped inside a statue on stage. What started as a fun exploration turned into a nightmare as she realized she was stuck. Unable to call for help due to cotton wool blocking her mouth, she faced the dilemma of disrupting the play's opening scene. With no way to escape, Sahwah's mind raced with worry about the consequences of her impulsive decision. As time passed slowly, she tried in vain to tip the statue over for attention but was thwarted by its sturdy base. Alone and desperate, she could only hope that someone would discover her plight before the play began. The once fascinating statue now felt like a prison, and Sahwah regretted her misadventure.|"[""1.

A quarter or maybe half an hour passed slowly. Suddenly, two figures quietly entered the stage from the back. Sahwah's heart raced with hope. If she could just catch their attention, they might free her. Desperately, she tried to call out but found her mouth stuffed with cotton wool. As she listened, she realized it was Joe Lanning and Abraham Goldstein. They were up to no good, carrying the statue off the stage. Joe mentioned they had taken items from Room 22, where the play props were kept. Disguised, they loaded the statue onto a truck outside the school. In the dark, they headed towards the athletic field, with Sahwah feeling the strangest ride ever.|"['1.

The statue was placed in a truck and covered with canvas. Joe and Abraham drove the truck to a building, where they unloaded the statue into an empty barn. Sahwah, hidden under the canvas, felt suffocated but was relieved when the ride was short. Left alone in the dark barn, she worried about being discovered and starving. Exhausted, she dozed off and dreamt of a circus with wild animals. Waking up to the sound of a dog chasing a cat, Sahwah realized the cat had climbed on the statue. When the dog lunged at the cat, the statue tipped slightly, freeing Sahwah's feet. She could now move and balance the statue's upper part, giving her hope of escape.|"['1.

The dog continued to bark and chase the cat around the barn. The cat found a window without glass, slipped out, and disappeared into the night. The dog, also entering through the window, couldn't get out as there was no aid inside. A voice called for the dog, named Lion, to come out. A small boy opened the door, saw a statue, got scared, and ran off with the dog. A girl named Sahwah, stuck inside the statue, figured out a way to jump out and escape. She hurried away, passing an empty house. Sahwah realized the plan to hide the statue in the barn failed, but she understood Joe's intent was to ruin the play. The statue of Joan of Arc was crucial for the performance.|"['1.

Sahwah found herself lost in a new neighborhood, seeking help. As she walked, a man approached her, but to her surprise, he ran away in fear. Unbeknownst to Sahwah, a button had triggered a halo around her head, causing panic among the locals. A Slovak priest, torn between preaching peace or preparing for war, sought guidance.

Dick quickly brought the knife to Mr. Jackson's office, where it perfectly fit the broken piece to the shortened blade. The evidence proved that it was Frank Boyd, not Hinpoha, who had tampered with the wires in the electric room. The following day, Frank admitted his wrongdoing after being confronted with the knife. He confessed to working with Joe Lanning and cutting the wires as part of their plan. Despite committing the act while the actors were occupied, he went undetected until Hinpoha was mistakenly seen leaving the electric room, diverting suspicion.

Aunt Phoebe was unwell with a cold that week and demanded extra care. She secluded herself in a closed room with a mustard plaster and a heating pad, vowing to stay until her cold vanished. Hinpoha, concerned about the lack of fresh air, suggested opening a window, but Aunt Phoebe insisted on keeping it shut. She fell asleep while Hinpoha read history, leaving her to read alone in the stifling room. Later, Aunt Phoebe woke feeling uncomfortably hot from the excessive heat. As she started to relax, she was startled by a ghostly presence in the room. The formless figure moved eerily, causing Aunt Phoebe great fear. She prayed fervently as the ghost hovered over her bed, only to discover it was Hinpoha making owl sounds.

Gladys and Nyoda arrived at the Evans house to find it empty. Despite ringing the doorbell multiple times, no one answered. Frustrated, Gladys expressed the urgency of retrieving a sweater and shoes left inside. With no one home and no way to enter, Gladys contemplated breaking a window. However, Nyoda noticed an open window on the upper floor. As they attempted to reach it, a man from the neighboring estate intervened, mistaking their actions for burglary.

Gladys and Nyoda found themselves in a peculiar situation. They arrived at a grand estate before the others, despite missing their car. The white house perched on the cliff edge looked inviting. As they entered, they realized the place was deserted, with no sign of their friends. A mysterious servant led them to an elevator disguised as a room, which took them to a tower room with luxurious violet furnishings. The girls were amazed by the unexpected turn of events.

Nyoda admired the room's extraordinary purple decor. She wondered if this was where they would sleep. Impatient for Mrs. Bates, she pondered their situation. Suddenly, Gladys found the window, matching the room's purple theme, was barred. Shocked, they tried to summon the elevator but failed. The car that brought them had vanished, leaving them in eerie silence. Panicked, they peered out at the calm lake below. Nyoda recalled a bright blue car at a specific intersection, questioning if it was theirs. Confused and anxious, they turned to find the elevator mysteriously back with the same woman inside. She passed them a tray through a slide, leaving them bewildered.|"['1.

The lady gestured to her ears and shook her head, then pointed to her lips and shook her head. ""She can't hear or speak!"" Nyoda realized. Suddenly, the woman pressed a button, and the elevator vanished. Nyoda and Gladys exchanged bewildered looks. The situation was growing more mysterious. Clearly, they were not in Mrs. Bates's house. They were caught in a mix-up. But how could they clear the confusion without communication? They searched the room thoroughly for clues but found none. The room had no exit except to the bath, with no other doors or windows. Everything was violet, adding to their wonder. Nyoda mused, ""Are we in a Dumas novel? Is this really 1915?

As darkness enveloped the room and the elevator failed to arrive, they discussed their predicament until exhaustion led them to rest on the bed, still fully clothed and with the lights on. Nyoda, bothered by the purple light, closed her eyes briefly. When she reopened them, a streak of light shone through the window, the room dark, and the tray missing.

Nyoda looked out the window at the sun rising over the familiar lake she had known all her life. The cliffs jutted out in a curve along the shore. She felt like a prisoner, gazing at the scene from behind bars. She noticed breakfast on a shelf, realizing they had not heard the deaf-mute's arrival. As they waited, they inspected the iron grating for any opening. The elevator suddenly appeared, and the deaf-mute handed them a note. Nyoda and Gladys hoped to signal a passing boat but found the tower well-hidden by trees and rocks. The ornamental trellis outside the window concealed their view from the lake.

The girls felt trapped in the room, searching for a way out but finding none. Despite their efforts to learn why they were being held, the woman remained silent. Nyoda, trying to lift their spirits, distracted herself by planning an escape. She wrote a letter to a friend and offered her rings to the woman as a bribe. Just as the woman seemed tempted, a motor sound startled her, and she hurriedly sent the elevator down.

"Why does holding a knife make you want to cut something? Nyoda searched for an escape plan with the knife, studying the window bars closely. They were only set into the wooden sill.
