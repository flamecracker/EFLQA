Tom Swift and his friends embarked on an adventure in their airship, unaware of a bank robbery. Accused of the theft, they faced arrest upon their departure. Andy Foger falsely claimed Tom's involvement in the crime. Pursued by the police, the friends encountered perilous situations, including a forest fire and gunfire. Forced to land, they discovered the truth and sought the real culprits with the sheriff. In a subsequent volume, Mr. Swift worked on a submarine to win a government prize. The team later recovered sunken treasure, facing challenges from rivals and dangerous sea creatures. Returning the gold to the bank, Tom secured a promotion for his deserving friend Ned. Amidst inventing a storage battery, a crash diverted their attention, leading to a new mystery.|"['1.

Andy confidently boasted to his friends about leaving Tom behind in a race. Secretly, he planned to outpace Tom by shifting gears. However, Andy's car struggled as he clumsily shifted gears, while Tom smoothly adjusted his motor-cycle for better performance. Tom effortlessly sped past Andy, who then attempted to catch up by shifting gears again, but this time, his car malfunctioned and started rolling backward. Andy blamed the broken gears for his failure, but Tom's motor-cycle continued to lead.

The bottle shattered, splattering Andy, Sam, and Pete with black liquid. It seemed as if Tom had personally aimed the throw. The dark substance covered their clothes, hands, faces, and even the car. Tom watched in disbelief as the trio tried to wipe off the mess, forming puddles in the car. Andy used his handkerchief, but it quickly absorbed the blacking. Tom, feeling partly responsible, offered help, but they refused. He left on his motor-cycle, glancing back to see them cleaning up by the brook. Andy shook his fist, and Tom knew there might be trouble. Later, Andy falsely accused Tom of throwing the bottle. Meanwhile, Tom shared the true story with Mrs. Baggert. He then focused on improving his storage battery, working diligently in his machine shop for days to enhance its efficiency.|"['1.

Tom was excited about his new electric automobile design. The car would have a traditional style with two removable seats at the back, protected by curtains, and space for two people in the front, also shielded by curtains. The batteries would be located under the middle of the car and under the removable seats. There would also be a smaller set of batteries in the front, with room for tools. Tom planned to install a register gauge to warn when the battery was running low, ensuring he had enough power. He also aimed to make the battery rechargeable quickly or replaceable with new cells. Tom's determination stemmed from a desire to outdo Andy Foger's car and win a prize, all while navigating the challenges posed by a potential rival bank in town.|"[""1.

Tom excitedly explained his new invention to his father and Mr. Sharp. He planned to use a chain drive for more power and flexibility, steering it conventionally with starting and reversing levers near the wheel. With gears and a big reserve battery, he aimed for greater speed. After receiving feedback on his sketches, Tom began constructing the car with Mr. Jackson's help. Some parts were bought instead of made to speed up the process. The electric car started taking shape in Tom's shop, focusing on speed, strength, and control over appearance. Meanwhile, Mr. Foger tried to persuade Tom to move his deposit to a new bank, but Mr. Damon promised to help Ned by depositing money in the old bank.|['1.

After much effort, Tom managed to assemble a set of batteries. Eager to test them that night, he needed a specific powder from his father's lab. Unfortunately, he found none. Determined, Tom left after dinner, recalling past encounters with Andy Foger. Concerned about Andy and Sam Snedecker, Tom set off to get the needed chemical. On his way back, he kept an eye out for a special someone but did not find her. As he rode, several masked figures suddenly blocked his path, demanding him to stop. Surprised, Tom hesitated, causing his motor-cycle to slow down. Unfazed, Tom shone a bright light on the masked group, revealing their faces. Startled, the figures reacted, throwing a stone that shattered Tom's lamp, plunging the road into darkness. Tom prepared to confront the vandals for their actions.|"[""1.

Tom found himself outnumbered and dragged into the dark woods by masked figures. His arms were tied, and a cloth covered his eyes, making him a prisoner. As he stumbled along, he tried to identify his captors but couldn't due to the darkness. Despite fearing the Happy Harry gang, he realized they were unlikely culprits due to their current incarceration. Tom suspected the group might be highwaymen but dismissed the idea since they hadn't robbed him earlier. Emerging into a clearing with a fire, he recognized the masked figures as Andy's acquaintances, mostly local youths.

Tom, the young inventor, found himself tied up by Andy Foger and his gang. Despite his attempts to free himself, he was securely fastened to a tree near a campfire. The group, calling themselves the Deep Forest Throng, wanted to tar and feather Tom. As they discussed their plan, Tom managed to free one hand and heard their intentions. He found something in his pocket and realized it could help him escape. The group was getting ready to carry out their humiliating idea, but Tom was determined to fight back and outsmart them.|"['1.

There was a brief silence, then a bright blue flash illuminated the woods, followed by a muffled boom like gunpowder igniting. A thick cloud of white smoke billowed up, and it felt as though a strong wind swept through. Some of the masked boys were knocked down by the blast, and cries of pain and fear echoed as the smoke cleared. The fire was put out by Tom's unexpected explosion, causing chaos among the Deep Forest Throng. Andy Foger exclaimed, ""He does all sorts of tricks!"" Pete Bailey, nursing a bump on his head, speculated that Tom must have used a chemical in the fire to cause the explosion. ""Well, we didn't do it,"" Pete dryly remarked.

The young man reluctantly agreed and soon found himself dreaming of being in his electric car, attempting to retrieve a thousand-pound piece of gold from the sea. He woke up with the covers bunched on his chest, removed them, and fell back asleep. As he neared the old Shopton bank, he noticed a commotion. A crowd had gathered, growing by the minute. Tom felt disappointed, hoping his father and friends could prevent disaster. He sensed troublemakers fueling the chaos. The crowd grew restless, some even tried to break into the bank. Tom searched for his father but couldn't find him. The tension rose as the clock struck ten, and the bank's doors remained shut. Finally, Ned Newton appeared, calming the crowd and announcing the bank was open but urged everyone to wait in line.|"['1.

Ned had spoken his piece and returned inside, looking pale. The door stayed ajar, flanked by policemen, as anxious depositors lined up. Tom observed the crowd pushing forward, eager to withdraw their money first. Amidst this, Ned signaled Tom from a bank window. Tom saw Ned motioning him to the rear entrance opening to an alley. Curious, Tom rode his machine to the alley. Unnoticed, he entered the bank through a side door and headed to his father and Mr. Damon's offices. In the hallway, the murmurs of the crowd and the sound of money being paid out could be heard. Mr. Damon shared a plan to use railroad securities as collateral to secure sixty thousand dollars from the Clayton National Bank, located forty miles away.

"Tom enthusiastically declared, ""Yes, I can do it!"" in his electric car, confident he could reach speeds of a hundred miles per hour if needed. Determined to secure the sixty thousand dollars, Tom's bold proposal, supported by Mr. Damon, stunned the bank officials into silence.

With a firm handshake from his father and a nervous goodbye from the bank president, Tom and Mr. Damon left through the rear entrance in the electric car. As they sped away, Mr. Damon observed the new bank and remarked to Tom.

"With a determined look in their eyes, three farmers armed with pitchforks emerged from behind a load of hay, ready to take on the thieves who were attempting a hold-up.

The sound of pistol shots filled the air as the farmers chased off the would-be robbers.

Mr. Swift suggested that Mr. Pendergast make an announcement to the waiting crowd that there was enough cash to meet all demands, and the bank would stay open until everyone was paid. Learning that their money was safe, many depositors decided not to withdraw it, thus avoiding interest loss. The crowd began to disperse, breaking the run on the bank. Only a portion of the sixty thousand dollars brought by Tom and Mr. Damon was needed. The president decided to reward the farmers who helped with the hay and sent them a substantial reward.
