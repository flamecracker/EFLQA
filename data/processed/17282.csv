Once upon a time, a crow perched on an oak tree, observing a tailor craft his cloak. The tailor, aiming to shoot the crow, called for his bow but mistakenly struck his own sow instead. Distressed, he requested brandy for the injured animal. Meanwhile, a hen and a rooster exchanged banter about laying eggs and buying shoes. The hen shared a whimsical tale of a tiny husband in a pint pot, while the rooster sang about King Cole and his merry fiddlers. Another story unfolded with a curious encounter between a maid and a gentleman discussing her father's profession, marriage proposal, and her witty response to his inquiry about her fortune.|"[""1.
