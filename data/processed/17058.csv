The torpedo was shaped like a cigar and had a propeller at the back. This propeller was turned by an engine at the rear of the torpedo, which started running the moment the torpedo left the tube and went into the ocean. The propeller had a mechanism that kept the torpedo moving in a straight line. The naval officer explained that the torpedo could travel underwater at speeds faster than thirty miles per hour but could only go a short distance due to its high speed. Jack learned how to fire the torpedo by pushing a lever to release compressed air and launch the torpedo into the water. The torpedo was shot towards a scow, and they saw it travel underwater before hitting the scow and floating back to the surface.|['1.

The Farnum group was heading upstairs to their rooms when John C. Rhinds and Radwin approached them. Rhinds introduced Radwin as the secretary of the Rhinds Company. Lieutenant Danvers was absent due to a prior commitment. Rhinds, Radwin, Farnum, Pollard, and the three submarine boys gathered around a table. Mr. Farnum mentioned that alcohol is not used to build business relationships anymore. Rhinds agreed, acknowledging that drinking is outdated in business. Rhinds informed them about the board members and the upcoming submarine boat race. Radwin offered to show the boys around town to see the sailors' activities. They decided to sit near the entrance to observe the street until their employers finished their meeting. Radwin excused himself to post a letter at the drugstore.|"[""1.

As they chatted, Jack expressed his thoughts on Mr. Rhinds and Mr. Radwin, mentioning that Rhinds seemed a bit rough while Radwin was too slick. He felt they weren't like their friends Jake Farnum and Dave Pollard, who were true gentlemen. Despite this, Jack acknowledged that Rhinds and Radwin had been pleasant that night. While walking, they didn't notice how long Radwin was gone. Radwin returned after almost half an hour and suggested taking everyone for hot chocolate. He asked Captain Benson to wait for the others while he led Jack and Hal to the place. Disappointed, Radwin had hoped to leave Jack at a different corner. A girl approached Eph, asking for his arm, showing she was scared by her trembling hand. Eph, not a flirt, agreed to help her, not wanting to see her in trouble.|"['1.

He walked down a quiet street with a girl, trying to ease her fear. Despite her veil, he noticed her beautiful eyes. Suddenly, the girl screamed and ran off as they reached an alley. Eph faced Tom and two others, ready to fight. Darkness enveloped him as he fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Radwin left, realizing he forgot to mail a letter. Hal saw two sailors approaching, showing respect for them. The sailors mentioned Eph's fight and assured Hal he would be fine soon. Hal feigned a shoe nail issue to stay put.|"['1.

We located your friend, Hastings, and brought him there. Hastings wanted us to find you and bring you there, friend. Shortly after, Jack Benson turned off a side street into an alley. The houses in this alley were dark. Most of the buildings here were only used during the day, like junk shops and old stores. ""Take it easy, friend, and you'll sleep better tonight!"" chuckled one sailor, covering Jack's mouth, while another held his hands. In the commotion, Jack threw a punch, knocking one sailor down.

They wore uniforms similar to naval officers, earning them respect from sailors. Despite this, two fake sailors approached Jack in a familiar manner. Concerned about their missing friends, they suspected Rhinds and Radwin's involvement. Determined to solve the mystery, they decided to rest for the upcoming race.

Shortly after, the young leader reappeared on the deck, holding a range-finder on a stand. He quickly took some readings through the scope and made some calculations. Benson noticed Jacob Farnum nearby, looking worn and pale. As the second hour ended, Jack called Eph to take a break at the wheel. Instead of resting, Jack set up the range-finder, his hands trembling. Lieutenant Danvers, observing, knew how to operate it but couldn't help without disqualifying their submarine. Feeling uneasy, Jack left for the engine room. After four hours, the Rhinds boat led, with the Seawold boat behind, and the Blackson boat far off. Jack and his team focused on their race, strategizing to maintain their speed and let the others risk overheating. Farnum praised Jack's tactics, boosting morale for the remaining race.|"['1.

The older man explained that he had already started contacting state Senators and Congressmen to secure government orders for submarines. Despite a slight lead by Pollard boats, he aimed to influence the government to order two types of submarines. The naval board signaled a mission to locate and destroy a drifting derelict, assigning submarines to accompany a gunboat. The submarine 'Thor' received the signal, symbolizing a bold mission ahead. As the mission began, the 'Oakland' set off at high speed, testing the submarines' endurance. Rhinds had an advantage in crew numbers, but all crews took turns operating to maintain speed. The 'Hastings' maintained a lead in the race, showcasing their teamwork and determination.|"['1.

The fleet sailed far from land, facing strong winds and lively seas with choppy waves. Despite the challenging conditions, the submarines handled the sea adeptly. Orders were given for the 'Hastings' and 'Thor' to maintain specific positions at a distance. As the boats advanced at a reduced speed, the young skipper directed all hands to be on deck. Spotting the semi-submerged derelict ahead, the crew increased their speed, alerting the other vessel. The rival craft also spotted the derelict and attempted to reach it first. The young commander, Captain Jack, coordinated the operation from the conning tower, ensuring the engines were not overwhelmed. A sudden explosion near the derelict sent a massive spray into the air, signaling a dramatic turn of events.|"['1.

Lieutenant Danvers shared his observations, noting the 'Thor' boat's course change just before a torpedo approached their ship. The shipbuilder urged action, directing Jack to cautiously approach the torpedo to prevent any accidental detonation. Lieutenant Danvers, usually not involved in ship operations, now took charge as a Navy officer. He requested Ensign Hal to stay vigilant. Danvers then ordered a search of the 'Thor' for the suspicious torpedo. Captain Magowan agreed that the circumstantial evidence was strong enough to proceed. The boarding party, including Danvers and marines, inspected the 'Thor.' Despite initial suspicions, the evidence cleared the 'Thor' crew of any wrongdoing. Captain Magowan acknowledged the lack of guilt and ordered the investigation to cease.|"[""1.

Lieutenant Danvers interrupted, confirming that Radwin was the only missing crew member from the boat. Ensign Pike denied knowledge of any torpedoes being fired. The president of the naval board acknowledged the lack of evidence to make an arrest but decided to leave marines on board for surveillance. The recovered torpedo was found with a full war charge, leading to a search of other submarines. Returning to Groton Bay, the crew rested as the Seawold boat departed. Lieutenant Danvers suggested that the Navy Department favored the Pollard and Rhinds boats. Despite suspicions, proof was lacking, and government orders would depend on evidence.

In the past, when the Pollard boats were not well-known, Captain Jack understood the value of newspaper recognition. He once hosted a large group of newspaper reporters in Dunhaven to witness the impressive capabilities of the Pollard boat. By creating an exciting program, the fame of the Pollard boat spread across the nation, prompting public demand for the Navy to own these remarkable vessels. Captain Jack sought approval from Jacob Farnum before pursuing this strategy. Despite the newspapers spreading the story, it was based on verifiable facts. The newspapers sensationalized the account, leaving no room for legal action. John Rhinds, feeling unjustly blamed, vented his frustration at the newspapers. When a reporter arrived to interview him, Rhinds remained composed, emphasizing that the boat was thoroughly searched and no hidden torpedoes were found. The reporter proposed a thorough inspection of the boat, but Rhinds declined due to the secrecy of submarine technology.|"[""1.

He then sent urgent telegrams seeking help from Congress. As more requests poured in, he realized he couldn't handle them alone. Despite feeling desperate without his associate, Fred Radwin, who had vanished, Rhinds faced mounting pressure. The newspapers worsened the situation by highlighting his refusal to allow inspections of his submarine. Despite the chaos, he planned a shore trip for the crew, cautioning them to stay silent.
