Tayoga, Robert, and Willet, after a victorious battle at Lake George, headed north, hoping for more success. But due to provincial disputes, the army remained inactive. Undeterred, the trio sought to achieve greatness in the coming cold months, willing to face risks. As they ventured into the forest, Tayoga led, confident in finding a suitable refuge. In the growing darkness, they reached a rocky recess where they decided to build a fire for warmth and comfort. With the fire lit, they enjoyed a meal of venison and bread, feeling grateful for nature's provisions. As the flames dwindled, they settled in for the night, pondering their individual concerns. Robert reflected on St. Luc, a French leader who had shown unexpected friendship, prompting questions about his mysterious origins.|"['1.

He turned his eyes away from the burning coals and looked at the calm face of the hunter. He almost asked a question but knew the Great Bear would avoid answering. The hunter, who had been like a father to him, surely had his best interests in mind. Robert's thoughts turned to the task ahead, involving the cunning opponent, St. Luc. He wondered if they would cross paths again. The Onondaga, with his keen senses, sensed a man approaching along the cliff's edge. As the man drew closer, Robert trusted the Onondaga's judgment. They waited in silence, knowing that encountering a stranger in this perilous wilderness was rare and required caution.|"['1.

"A shadowy figure emerged on the hilltop right on time and paused as if needing a break. The sky brightened, outlining him clearly. Robert gasped. ""He's likely heading to a French camp with intel on us,"" Willet remarked. ""We spooked Mynheer Hendrik Martinus in Albany, but traitors don't change. Now that the danger's shifted, Martinus and Garay may be at it again."" ""Let him go,"" Willet continued. ""French leaders will learn what he knows. We'll tail him, learn about our foes."" The trio readied themselves quietly, leaving the spot. Robert eyed the embers one last time, resolved. Garay vanished into the foliage, but Tayoga and Willet could track him easily. Eager, Robert pressed forward, following Garay's trail. Tayoga whispered, ""We don't aim to get too close."" They trailed Garay, the moonlight aiding their pursuit. Robert was determined to thwart the French spy and avenge the attack in Albany. Tayoga noted Robert's resolve, emphasizing the need for honor in their actions."|"['1.

Robert, Willet, and Tayoga tracked the spy, Garay, to a large camp where French and Indian forces gathered. The camp was filled with the enticing aroma of cooked food from twelve crackling fires. The trio observed over three hundred men, including French soldiers and Canadians, bustling about. Among them was De Courcelles, Jumonville, and a striking young man. Tandakora, an imposing Ojibway warrior, stood by a fire, his body painted for war. As they spied on the camp, Robert felt a mix of fear and curiosity. The group remained hidden, watching the camp with caution, aware that danger lurked in the shadows.|['1.

"""No,"" Robert stated. ""He thinks about the battle at Lake George that he lost, and the scalps he didn't take. He's worried about his warriors, the defeat of his people, and the French."" ""Even so, Dagaeoga. Tandakora and De Courcelles talk to the spy, Garay. They are pleased that Waraiyageh and his soldiers haven't prepared to advance after their victory. The delay will give the French and Indians time to regroup. Tandakora and De Courcelles are happy with Garay's news. But look, Dagaeoga! See who's coming now!"" Robert's heart raced as a tall, athletic man in a white uniform, St. Luc, approached. He was graceful and proud, commanding respect. St. Luc's presence impressed, showing his strength even in the forest. ""St. Luc is a great leader,"" Willet whispered. ""His spirit and leadership are unmatched."" They observed the camp, watching the French and Indians wake up and cook breakfast. St. Luc conversed with Garay and the others, then retreated to a knoll, deep in thought. They left the camp, relieved to be away from potential danger. ""Now, we set up camp,"" Robert said, feeling stiff and hungry after their covert observation."|"['1.

"""Dagaeoga always has plenty of words,"" said Tayoga in a whimsical tone, ""but he will have to endure his hunger a while longer. Let the pincers tear and burn. It is good for him. It will give him a chance to show how strong he is, and how a mighty warrior despises such little things as food and drink.""

""I'm not anxious to show myself a mighty warrior just now,"" retorted young Lennox. ""I'd be willing to sacrifice my pride in that respect if I could have carried off some of their bear steaks and venison.""

Nevertheless, he led them forward sternly, pursuing a westward course for many miles before allowing a halt. They found a secluded place among the rocks, no fire permitted, prompting Robert to grumble. Willet suggested they rest to conserve strength, taking turns to watch. The peaceful forest belied the imminent danger from hostile hunters seeking game."|"[""1.

The sun climbed high in the sky as the hours slipped away, bringing noon closer. Willet remained still, not asleep but resting deeply. His body relaxed, regaining strength lost to fatigue. Suddenly, a distant sound caught his attention—a rifle shot, not from a battle but a hunt. Hunters roamed nearby, unaware of the rangers' presence. Willet, undisturbed, found amusement in their ignorance. As more shots echoed, his amusement grew. The hunters, focusing on deer and bear, failed to realize the true prey in their midst. Willet, calm and collected, knew their enemies thought they were safe, not suspecting the lurking rangers. By afternoon, the hunt moved away, and as Tayoga awoke, Willet finally stirred and spoke.|"['1.

"""Dagaeoga and I are safe under the protection of the Great Bear,"" the Onondaga assured confidently. ""Tandakora will be furious if he discovers we were here, vulnerable for capture. Lennox is awake now too! Oh, Dagaeoga, you missed the grand jest while you slept.""

""I'm uncertain. I once thought we should journey south to our army at Lake George with news of this large group, but it's quite a distance, and it might be wiser to remain here and keep an eye on St. Luc. What do you think, Robert?""

Later in the day, Willet dozed off, leaving Robert and Tayoga to keep watch, relying more on their ears than their eyes. They heard distant gunshots from the hunt, causing Robert's heart to race. As twilight fell, they had a simple supper and then stretched their stiff muscles with a short walk.

""It's true, Dagaeoga, but we face another challenge. We must guard against freezing. The mountain air is turning icy! The wind now blows from the north, can't you feel its sharpness?""

""I do,"" replied Robert, feeling the chill. ""It's an unfortunate change for us. But we should expect it in the high mountains near Canada. Should we start another fire?""

The wind suddenly rose, hissing sinisterly through the passes and gorges. Robert felt dampness on his face as snowflakes melted. More flakes filled the air aggressively, stinging cheeks and eyes. Despite shivering violently, they endured the storm. After a long wait, Willet finally spoke. They urgently needed a fire for warmth. They endured the bitter cold, thinking of the French and Indians with their cozy fires. Finally, Willet decided they had no choice but to light a fire. Using their skills, they lit a blaze, and Robert built a protective wall of wood. The fire brought warmth, lifting their spirits.

"""Dagaeoga has many words when he is happy,"" said the Onondaga. ""His tongue runs on like the pleasant murmur of a brook, but he does it because Manitou made him that way. The world must have talkers as well as doers, and it can be said for Lennox that he acts as well as talks.""

""I can't, Dave. You know I slept all the morning, but I'm not suffering from dullness. I'm imagining things. I'm imagining how much worse off we'd be if we didn't have flint and steel. I can always find pleasure in making such contrasts.""

But he crouched down lower against the cliff, drew his blanket closer and spread both hands over the fire, which had now died down into a glowing mass of coals. He was wondering what they would do on the morrow, when their food was exhausted. They had not only the storm to fight, but possible starvation in the days to come. He foresaw that instead of discovering all the plans of the enemy they would have a struggle merely to live.

The other two found the suggestion good, and all three acted upon it promptly, ranging through the forest about them in search of brushwood, which they brought back in great quantities. Robert's blood began to tingle with the activity, and his spirits rose. Now the snow, as it drove against his face, instead of making him shiver, whipped his blood. He"|['1.

The two boys, one wearing white and the other red, huddled together near the cliff as the hunter tended to the fire. Sheltered from the snow by their blankets, Robert felt no worry. Accustomed to the wild, he ignored the discomfort. The falling snow covered their tracks, keeping them safe from any danger. Feeling secure, Robert drifted back to sleep, followed by Tayoga. Willet kept watch. Tayoga took over later, ensuring the safety of the group throughout the night. When they awoke to a white world, they decided to descend the mountain to hunt. The snow had stopped, leaving a cold, clear landscape. They cooked their remaining food over the coals, discussing their next steps. Tayoga returned with news of warriors nearby, forcing them to stay hidden until nightfall. The threat of rain and freezing temperatures loomed, making their situation more challenging.|"['1.

Tonight, Dagaeoga will face a great challenge as he goes without food for many hours. He will long for venison, bear steak, and fish from the streams, but they will only be memories. Despite his hunger, he must endure and test his limits. Robert, too, struggles with the intense hunger, but they must remain hidden from their enemies. As the rain turns to ice and the night grows colder, the hunger becomes almost unbearable. They wait in silence, their bodies weakening, but their spirits strong. Despite the hardships, they find solace in patience, knowing that endurance is their greatest weapon. Dagaeoga must draw strength from the stories of those who have faced similar trials and emerged victorious.|"['1.

The Onondaga tribe member laughed heartily, knowing Robert wasn't complaining but merely passing the time. He shared tales of brave warriors and chiefs who endured long periods without food or water. Willet, listening quietly, understood the need for uplifting conversation before their upcoming challenge. As daylight faded, Robert felt weakness creeping in due to hunger. Determined to take action, Willet and Tayoga exchanged glances, deciding it was time to depart. Robert eagerly agreed, ready to leave. They wrapped in blankets and set out, the shelter now seeming precious as they trudged through slush and snow. Despite the harsh conditions, they pressed on, their moccasins soaked, facing the bitter cold. Robert persevered, silently enduring the physical and mental strain, realizing the impact of the harsh winter on their escape.

In the wilderness, hunger gnawed at Robert, weakening his resolve despite Tayoga's incredible tales of men enduring days without food. Willet, with his sharp eyes, led the way through treacherous terrain. Suddenly, he halted, sensing danger ahead. A war party of twenty lurked close, poised to intercept them. Faced with a perilous choice, they opted to ascend a steep, snowy cliff to evade the threat. As they climbed, fear of ambush haunted Robert, but Willet reassured him. Eventually, they reached a desolate summit, battered by wind and hail. Though they evaded immediate danger, their ordeal was far from over, the harsh elements testing their endurance. Despite the unforgiving conditions, they pressed on, driven by the will to survive.|"[""1.

They continued on the arduous journey, sometimes slipping on the slick path, feeling their energy dwindling. Occasionally glimpsing a vast, desolate landscape under a gloomy sky, with peaks and ridges shrouded in clouds, seeming to resist human intrusion. Robert was soaked, his vitality draining rapidly. Despite his body's exhaustion and the desire for warmth, he persevered silently. Willet proposed building a fire in a sheltered spot after a tough morning fire-starting struggle. The warmth revived them, but their weakened state made the effort exhausting. As they waited for dawn, Robert hoped for fair weather, yet dark clouds loomed. Despite feeling weak and desiring to stay put, hunger stirred him into action. The will to survive rekindled, urging them to move on from the comfort of the fires. Willet praised Robert's resilience, encouraging him to keep fighting for life.|"['1.

The journey of Robert, Tayoga, and Willet continued with uncertainty, traversing ridges, dips, and forests with eerie winds. Despite rain, snow, and hail soaking them, Robert's vigor dwindled, hunger persisting. As they trudged in silence, Robert reminisced about sumptuous banquets Tayoga described earlier. Tayoga, consumed by hunger, joked about eating a deer whole. Robert's hope sparked at the thought of fishing in the mountain lakes. They descended into a valley, but their fishing lines remained untouched. Tayoga solemnly interpreted this as a sign of the Sun God's displeasure, indicating they had offended Areskoui. Despite the abundance of fish, none took the bait, leaving the trio pondering their fate.|"['1.

"He reeled in his fishing line, coiled it neatly, and stowed it away in his bag. The rest, after waiting in vain, followed suit, convinced of his wisdom. They then labored to build two fires again, and nestled between them for the night. But come morning, all three were feeble. Their strength had waned overnight, and the situation turned dire. ""Let's split up and search,"" he suggested optimistically. ""Robert, head west; Tayoga, east; I'll go north. By nightfall, we'll regroup here, successful or not."" Energized by action, they set off in their designated directions. Robert, momentarily forgetting his gnawing hunger, moved with newfound vigor. Encountering a rugged slope, he paused, gazing at a ray of light in the clouds. Interpreting it as a good sign, he pressed on, feeling guided by unseen forces. Spotting fresh tracks, his hope surged.

Robert turned toward a tall rock and a black figure sprang up, staring at him briefly before attempting to flee. Quickly, he raised his rifle and shot the animal through the heart at close range. The young bear, named Areskoui, fell to the ground, providing Robert with much-needed food. Grateful for the bounty, he blew a whistle to signal his companions, Tayoga and Willet. They arrived, and together they dragged the bear to a valley, cooked the meat, and savored the meal slowly. Rejuvenated by the food, they discussed their next steps in serving their country. Impressed by Robert's hunting skills, Willet suggested they continue their mission near the French and Indians. Robert's successful hunt filled them with satisfaction and strength, ready to face the challenges ahead.|"['1.

The transformation was remarkable. The once gloomy forest now appeared magnificent and cheerful, with splendid oaks and beeches. The sky, previously dark and sinister, now displayed gorgeous colors of a benevolent sunset. The wind had shifted from cold and wet to soft, dry, and warm. It felt like a grand, kind, and friendly world. Tayoga explained to Robert how the stomach can influence one's perception of the universe. As they enjoyed a satisfying meal of juicy bear meat and nuts, their physical vitality and mental strength returned, lifting their spirits. Despite the lurking danger of Tandakora nearby, they felt content and untroubled. With the night growing warmer under a starlit sky, they found comfort in each other's company, looking forward to facing whatever challenges lay ahead with renewed optimism.|['1.

Tayoga climbed the ridge to the north around noon and returned with a gleam in his eyes that caught Willet's attention. The Onondaga, however, stayed silent, waiting for the right moment to speak. Tayoga reassured them that the enemy was unaware of their presence and that they were under the protection of Areskoui and Tododaho. As smoke rose beyond the ridge later in the afternoon, they knew the warriors were nearby, indulging in food and rest. Despite the danger, they remained defiant throughout the day and night. The next morning, well-prepared with supplies, they cautiously headed south, encountering fresh trails and realizing the hostile forces were still close. Hiding on a lofty summit, they observed Tandakora and his warriors searching for them in the valley below. As they listened to the sounds of the forest, they remained vigilant, knowing the savages were close by. With the need for caution paramount, they spent the day and night on the crest, hoping to evade their pursuers.|"[""1.

There was no wind, but Robert spotted movement in the shrubs halfway down the slope. He saw a glint of metal, likely from a rifle. Willet warned that the enemy was lurking, waiting for an opportunity. Tayoga's unusual behavior intrigued them. Following Tayoga's lead, they found a cool, clear fountain. Robert drank gratefully and returned. Suddenly, a shot rang out, taking down an enemy. The warriors retreated, and the group remained patient, waiting for the next move. Tayoga's reverence for nature and confidence in their situation gave them hope. The sun shone brightly, symbolizing their resilience and unity.|"[""1.

The hunter and Tayoga stood guard while Lennox roamed the crest freely. Lennox scouted the unguarded sides, confident no warrior could scale the steep slope. Returning to the sentinels, he observed distant warriors cooking game in the gorge, seemingly prepared for a lengthy siege. Spotting De Galissonnière, a young French officer, climbing towards them, Lennox joined the watchers. De Galissonnière halted near the crest, where Willet warned him not to proceed. De Galissonnière, seeking their surrender, emphasized the danger they faced from the angered Indians. Lennox, making light of the situation, mentioned a bet on their endurance. De Galissonnière urged them to surrender, expressing concern for their safety.

Robert, speaking earnestly, expressed gratitude for the help they received but declined any immediate repayment, citing the hope they have as long as they are alive. Willet shared that the savages expect their surrender due to exhaustion, unaware of a life-saving fountain provided by Tayoga's Areskoui. Tayoga, noticing a flock of wild pigeons heading their way, believes it's a sign of help from Areskoui.

They spoke quietly for a bit, then fell silent. The night was dark, no stars or moon in sight, perfect for Tandakora's plans. Yet, they felt a deep sense of contentment. Robert had made a path to the water, pigeons had arrived for food, and they were confident in defending their fortress. They lay near the edge, listening keenly in the darkness. They heard the wind, rustling leaves, and faint movements. As midnight approached, a pebble fell, signaling an approaching enemy. After a tense wait, they spotted figures below and fired, repelling the attackers. The enemies retreated, and the defenders prepared for a siege.

In the center of the crest, a dip held fallen wood, abundant in the wilderness. With wood and water in plenty, the men would have been content to stay on the peak. A blazing fire soon lit up, visible to warriors on opposing peaks, but they were safe. Enjoying bear meat and wild pigeon, they discussed their natural fortress. Tayoga spoke of the Sun God watching over them, satisfied with the night. Robert noticed an abundance of grape vines that could be used as a rope. They decided to use the vines to escape, propping up tree trunks to deceive watchers. After hours of work, the men were pleased with their escape plan.|"['1.

"They called Willet, and the three, leaving the crest which had been such a refuge for them and which they had defended so well, descended to the fountain. At that point they secured their cable with infinite care to the largest of the dwarf trees and let it drop over across a bare space to the next clump of bushes below, a distance that seemed very great, it was so steep. Robert claimed the honor of the first descent, but it was finally conceded to Tayoga, who was a trifle lighter. The Onondaga fastened securely upon his back his rifle and his pack containing food, and then, grasping the cable firmly with both hands, he began to go down, while his friends watched with great anxiety. He was not obliged to swing clear his whole weight, but was able to brace his feet against the cliff. Thus he steadied the vines, but Robert and Willet nevertheless breathed great sighs of relief when he reached the bushes below and detached himself from the cable. Robert went next, and Willet followed. When the three were in the bushes, clinging to their tough and wiry strength, they found that the difficulties, as they invariably do, had decreased. Below them, the slope was not so steep by any means, and by holding to the rocky outcrops and scant bushes, they could make the full descent of the mountain.

Willet praised Tayoga's idea, influenced by Iroquois beliefs, as they witnessed a storm without rain. The lightning struck the mountain, emphasizing the power of the gods. Robert observed the thunder's direction, anticipating rain. The atmosphere grew intense, with thunder echoing conversations among mythical figures. Despite the awe-inspiring spectacle, Robert felt safe in the presence of the gods. As the storm intensified, they sought refuge in a shelter. The downpour cleansed the world, renewing their resolve to monitor the French and Indian forces. They settled near a scenic lake, strategizing to intercept any enemy movements.

A small stream flowed nearby, ensuring a steady water supply for the two friends who had made their home in a secluded valley. They focused on securing their dwelling against wild animals before turning to hunting. Tayoga set traps while Robert gathered firewood.

Tayoga and Robert were in a hurry to finish their tasks. A mysterious message hinted that Dave had reached the lake, urging them to speed up. Tayoga decided to craft a bow and arrow to conserve their ammunition while hunting. With his hatchet and knife, he skillfully fashioned the weapons in a few days, using strong sinews and sharp bone tips. Proud of his work, Tayoga tested his new gear by hunting a moose, deer, and smaller game, while traps captured various animals. They dried the furs and jerked the game for winter. Despite their sore hands and bones, they worked tirelessly. Robert explored nearby caves, believing bears would return. Tayoga shared his belief that bears carried the souls of fallen warriors. As winter approached, the cave provided warmth and comfort, filled with furs awaiting trade in Albany.

One special day arrived when Robert noticed the wind switching between hot and cold, creating a contrast in temperatures. The skies were covered in a peculiar mist, distorting his view of objects, making them appear out of proportion. Some seemed too large, while others appeared too small. Robert felt like either the world was off-kilter, or his own senses were distorted. Despite his waning interest in daily tasks and his vague thoughts, his curiosity remained sharp and focused. He sensed an impending unusual event, with nature signaling its approach. The mysterious atmosphere lingered into the night, as the wind grew colder. Seeking fresh air, Robert and Tayoga ventured outside, climbing the ridge that enclosed their valley. Tayoga's demeanor turned contemplative, speaking to the air about their safety and seeking protection from their enemies. As the night progressed, the mist revealed rolling figures resembling bears, believed to be the souls of great warriors.

Robert and Tayoga found themselves in a cave as heavy snow fell outside. The two friends believed that the souls of great warriors inhabited the bears they had seen. They secured the entrance with stones and settled in for the night. The next day, the snow continued to fall heavily, covering the landscape in a deep white blanket. Despite being trapped by the storm, they kept busy with tasks like making arrows and repairing clothes. As the days passed, they cooked and enjoyed meals together, making the most of their time in the cozy shelter.

There was much to be done, even though they had prepared themselves well before the heavy snowfall arrived. They crafted simple shovels from wood and expanded the area they had cleared of snow. With stones fitted together, they created a basic furnace that aided greatly in their cooking. Gathering more brushwood hidden under the snow, they preserved the supplies they had stored for harsh times. They used bone needles and sinews to fashion bear fur cloaks for warmth, though not stylish. Despite the freezing temperatures and brittle trees, they continued working on snowshoes and made buckskin gloves, earmuffs, and caps for protection. Tayoga set out early the next day, leaving Robert to wait alone. Robert found comfort in work and pondered the bears' caves, believing the spirits within were having profound dreams. Tayoga returned with powder and lead, obtained from enemies in a nearby valley, ensuring they had the needed supplies.|"['1.

The Onondaga scout, Tayoga, and his companion, Robert, found themselves in a hidden cave, safe from their enemies. Tayoga, skilled in stealth, managed to steal a valuable cache of ammunition from their foes, ensuring their survival through the harsh winter. As they melted lead and cast bullets for their rifles, the pair grew restless, yearning to rejoin the world outside. Despite the comfort of their shelter, they both agreed that it was time to venture out again.

Robert and Tayoga prepared meticulously for their journey through the harsh winter wilderness, knowing the challenges that lay ahead. They packed essential supplies like powder, bullets, food, and warm clothing to combat the extreme cold. Despite the heavy load, they ventured into the snowy landscape, relying on their snowshoes to traverse the rugged terrain. As they trekked southward towards Lake George, the frigid conditions tested their endurance. Robert's ankle began to ache from the unfamiliar snowshoes, prompting a rest in a sheltered grove. The duo faced slow progress through thickets and frozen lakes, with the distant howls of wolves echoing in the night. As the days passed, the weather shifted, making their journey more arduous. They paused to rest, lighting a fire to warm their chilled bodies and spirits. Tayoga ventured off to hunt, leaving Robert by the fire, eagerly anticipating his return with fresh game.|"['1.

He was exhausted, finding solace in the comforting warmth of the fire, slipping into a state of reverie filled with visions. Faces of old friends like Willet, Colonel Johnson, Grosvenor, Colden, Wilton, and Carson appeared before him. Suddenly, a crunch in the snow startled him. Was Tayoga returning without his deer? As he tried to react, dark figures closed in on him. A blow to his head rendered him unconscious.

Langlade, however, led them to the forest's edge, explaining the need for a formal audience with Montcalm. Eager to meet the renowned commander, Robert waited anxiously, his curiosity piqued by the camp's activity. Langlade, confident and chatty, hinted at Robert's imminent meeting with Montcalm. The morning brought an unexpected encounter with De Galissonnière, another officer. Robert, accompanied by Langlade, cautiously entered Montcalm's tent, where the French general, flanked by officers De Levis and Bourlamaque, fixed his gaze on the young prisoner, leaving Robert feeling scrutinized.|"['1.

Langlade identified Robert Lennox as a prisoner with influential friends in the British Colonies. Despite being respectful, Robert felt warmth towards the Marquis, acknowledging him as a capable adversary. Robert expressed his familiarity with the wilderness, having spent most of his life there. The Marquis mentioned the disappointment among the British Colonials due to the lack of progress after a battle. He then offered Robert the option of giving his parole to not participate in the war further. When Robert declined, the Marquis decided to send him to France on one of their returning ships. The Marquis commended Robert's spirit, hinting at a French connection within him.|"['1.

There may be individuals who understand you better than you comprehend yourself. I reiterate, there is a refined quality about you, reminiscent of French sophistication. Embrace it with pride. France, the oldest of the great civilized nations, offers a rich cultural experience. While the wilderness holds its own beauty, high civilization like that in France is equally magnificent. A visit to Paris, the city of light, and an audience with King Louis can be a delight for a discerning young man. Robert, captivated momentarily, knew a trip to France was improbable. Yet, the courteous French general's words lingered. The Owl, treating him graciously, reflected Montcalm's influence. Robert pondered the Marquis's intentions, unable to fathom why he would extend such hospitality. As St. Luc, a paragon of French gallantry, approached, Robert's admiration for the noble figure grew.|"['1.

Robert spent the night in Langlade's camp, pondering the next move at dawn. Albany was safe as they were too far west. The Colonials' defense would deter any attack. Despite Robert's efforts, Langlade kept quiet about their plans. Tandakora, a menacing figure, approached Robert. The huge Ojibway, armed to the teeth, eyed him fiercely. Robert met his gaze boldly, unflinching. Tandakora offered to buy him, but Langlade refused, claiming Robert was no longer his captive. The night was filled with the sounds of the French camp and the forest. Robert, unbound, lay near the fire, surrounded by the dense foliage, trying to sleep amidst the stirring events. The camp was alive with activity, from French songs to sentinels patrolling the unfamiliar woods.|"[""1.

The noises faded slowly, but Robert remained awake, intrigued by the distinct sounds around him. From the impatient horses to the faint notes of a song, each sound piqued his curiosity. Suddenly, a swishing noise caught his attention - the unmistakable sound of an arrow cutting through the air. Langlade, too, reacted to this sound, jumping up with alarm. As he examined the arrows, Robert noticed fresh marks near the barbs, revealing the outline of a bear. It was Tayoga's clan symbol, a message meant for Robert. The realization filled Robert with hope for escape. Langlade, known as the Owl, suspected the arrows held a message, possibly directed at Robert. Despite being held captive, Robert felt a surge of optimism, knowing he had a loyal ally in Tayoga. The next morning, as the French and Indian army marched west, Robert's desire to warn others about the impending attack on Oswego grew stronger, even though escape seemed impossible with the enemy forces surrounding him.|"['1.

From a hill, Robert saw three forts ahead of the French force. The largest fort, shaped like a star, stood on a plateau on the east bank of a river flowing into a lake. Its fortifications were made of sharpened tree trunks closely placed. Across the river was a stone and clay fort, with an unfinished stockade mockingly called Rascal Fort. Some flat boats and canoes were on the lake. The French army, led by Montcalm, surprised the forts. The defenders tried to resist but were overwhelmed by the French cannons. Robert, a prisoner, watched as the French and their Indian allies triumphed. The victory was swift and brutal, leaving Robert fearful for the future. The French army celebrated their success, while the defeated settlers faced a grim fate.|['1.

Robert sat wearily on the sand near the lake shore after a long day of watching. Feeling almost hopeless, he knew his courage would return. As he observed the wild Indians celebrating, he searched for Tandakora but didn't see him. The French soldiers guarding the prisoners were amazed and apprehensive at the chaotic scene. The sun set, casting a dark glow over the forts, troops, savages, and captives. A young Indian danced wildly, captivating Robert with his agility. Suddenly, the Indian approached Robert, signaling to escape. Robert sprang into action, knocking down a guard and leaping into a canoe with Tayoga, paddling away into the darkening lake as the wind howled.|['1.

Robert nearly capsized the canoe, but the Onondaga swiftly restored its balance, and they glided onto the lake under the night's cover. The fugitive remained silent, knowing it was not the time to talk. Tayoga's powerful strokes propelled them forward, bullets splashing in the water behind them. Luck favored them with a large, stable canoe, allowing Robert to stay hidden while Tayoga paddled with skill. The darkness shielded them from the French and Indian pursuers on the shore. As they paddled towards the lake's center, Tayoga cautioned Robert to stay on course to avoid detection. Despite the danger, Tayoga felt triumphant for saving Robert. As they navigated the lake, their escape remained perilous, with enemies in pursuit. Tayoga, vigilant and focused, prepared for any threat, his spirit lifted by the protection of his patron saint.

"""Keep going, Dagaeoga,"" the Onondaga encouraged. ""My rifle can reach far, signaling the enemy to halt. If they don't, your rifle will reinforce the command."" ""They've stopped,"" declared Tayoga. Reloading swiftly, they paddled into a dense fog bank, evading pursuers. Resting in the calm, moonlit waters, they admired the starry night. Tayoga, grateful for Robert's past help, now repaid the favor by guiding them safely. After ensuring their supplies, including food, they enjoyed a meal.

Tayoga, the Onondaga, skillfully procured supplies for himself and Robert from a nearby village. He secured blankets, ammunition, and venison, ensuring their provisions were ample. Robert, feeling unwell, was cared for by Tayoga, who prepared medicinal herbs to aid his recovery.

Robert lay on his back in the wilderness, feeling grateful for being saved by his loyal comrade, Tayoga. Despite being weak, he found peace in the wilderness, surrounded by potential dangers. He gazed at the star of Tayoga's Tododaho, finding solace in the Iroquois beliefs that mirrored his Christian faith. Wrapped in blankets with his weapons close, Robert heard footsteps and voices nearby, including the menacing Tandakora. He watched as the warriors, bearing spoils from Oswego, skinned a deer, all while hoping they wouldn't discover his hiding place. Filled with anger at the losses suffered by his people, Robert feared the French leader Montcalm and wondered if his people would continue to be defeated.|"['1.

As the Indians worked on the deer, the moon and stars shone brightly, casting a silver light in the forest. Robert spotted Tandakora and his men, feeling exposed. He resisted the urge to hide, realizing silence was crucial. Although he could have taken out Tandakora with his rifle, he hesitated, valuing his own life. Tayoga's Tododaho shielded him. Two Indians seeking water nearly stumbled upon him, but Tayoga redirected them. Robert's anxiety eased when they returned safely. The Indians, content from their victory, spoke freely. Robert, feeling insignificant, relied on Tododaho's protection. When two warriors neared him, a distraction saved him. The Indians departed, passing by him unnoticed, thanks to divine intervention.

Far to the east, towards Andiatarocte, a plan to strike Mountain Wolf is in motion. Frenchmen De Courcelles and Jumonville will team up with Tandakora. St. Luc will lead a large force against Mountain Wolf, who is suspected to be with the Great Bear. After a wide circuit, a little fire was lit to warm tea. Robert drank three cups under Tayoga's insistence and fell into a deep sleep. The next day, he woke up with a strong appetite. They had a hearty breakfast, and Robert felt rejuvenated. While watching a cloud approaching from the west, Robert became anxious. The cloud grew dark, and a storm ensued. Tayoga quickly built a shelter to protect them from the rain. Despite the shelter, Robert felt cold and shivered. Tayoga, determined to get a buffalo robe for Robert, braved the storm to fetch one from the village.|"['1.

"The thunder rumbled distantly to the south and then faded away. A few flashes of lightning lit up the sky before all fell silent. Robert drifted into a half-conscious state until Tayoga, a shadowy figure, appeared at the shelter's entrance. He carried a large bundle.""I've retrieved your buffalo robe, Dagaeoga,"" Tayoga said with a smile. ""It was in the head chief's lodge, but I managed to get it while he was busy with Tandakora and his warriors. It's one of the best I've seen.""As predicted, they ventured into the dark forest, Robert wrapped in the warm buffalo robe. Despite the wet woods hindering their progress, they persevered.

The day was bright, and as they journeyed on, Tayoga noted the trails left by war parties heading southeast.

They used various tricks to hide their tracks, like wading through water and walking on stones or logs. But they knew Tandakora would catch up eventually. As night fell, they quickened their pace, hoping the darkness would shield them. They heard distant shouts, indicating the pursuit continued. Thankfully, the night was pitch black, and they found refuge in a windrow from an old hurricane. Resting there, Robert recovered from their rapid flight. Suddenly, they sensed a presence nearby, but it turned out to be a bear, seeking shelter too. Tayoga assured Robert they were safe, as the forest spirits whispered to the animals that they meant no harm.

Robert quickly fell asleep, feeling a sense of self-respect and pride in his newfound responsibility. He was now an equal partner in their alliance, his senses sharpened by his resolve. The rustling of animals seeking refuge and the distant cry of their Indian pursuers barely escaped his notice. Despite the looming threat, Robert and Tayoga stealthily made their way northward, evading their pursuers. They reached a lake where Tayoga revealed a hidden canoe. They decided to hunt from the safety of the water, successfully catching a deer. Aware that their enemies might have canoes nearby, they stayed close to the shore, paddling cautiously. Tayoga suspected they would be pursued on the lake, but they remained determined to outwit their foes.|"['1.

They journeyed northward, staying within the shadow of the dense foliage. Traveling slowly in the luxurious canoe was a welcome change after trekking through the wilderness. Despite the comfort, they remained vigilant, scanning the waters. Robert spotted black dots on the lake, soon realizing it was Tandakora and his fleet of sixteen warriors. Hiding among the reeds, they watched as the Indian boats passed by, praying not to be discovered. As evening approached, the sun's descent seemed agonizingly slow. They anxiously awaited nightfall, knowing their safety depended on it. The vibrant sunset illuminated the lake, making their hiding spot crucial.

The sun lingered on their side of the world before setting. The colors in the water faded from orange and gold to silver and then gray as twilight descended. Tayoga, speaking in deep tones, warned of danger. As night fell, the afterglow faded, and the dark waters became ruffled by a light wind. Suddenly, attackers emerged from the bushes, causing their canoe to sink. Robert, struggling in the water, managed to defend himself against an assailant. Tayoga and Robert, now standing in the water, searched for their lost canoe. They decided to swim toward the middle of the lake, battling the rising wind and waves. Despite the perilous situation, their strong swimming skills and determination kept them afloat as they sought to recover their only means of escape.|"['1.

Dagaeoga and Tayoga heard the paddles of Tandakora's fleet approaching. The mist concealed both the canoe and the two friends, providing a shield from their enemies. As the fleet passed, Robert felt the danger surrounding them in the mystic atmosphere. The sound of the paddles intensified Robert's fear, but they remained unseen. The friends swam with determination, searching for their lost canoe. Finally, they spotted it in the distance, beckoning them back. With gratitude in their hearts, they swam towards the canoe, cautious not to overturn it when boarding. The canoe, a symbol of hope, awaited their return, slowly drifting away but carrying their essential supplies.

"""The canoe retreats before us, Dagaeoga,"" he said, ""but it is not to escape us, it is to beckon us on, out of the path of Tandakora's boats which soon may be returning again and which will now come farther out into the lake, thinking that we may possibly have made a dash under the cover of the mists."" The regular swishing grew louder and came closer, but the courage of the two youths was still high. They had been drawn on so steadily by the canoe, apparently in a predestined course, and they had been victors over so many dangers, that they were confident the boats of Tandakora would pass once more and leave them unseen. ""Aye, Dagaeoga,"" said the Onondaga, looking back. ""They do not appear through the mist and we hear only the paddles, but we know the threat is there, and we can follow them as well with ear as with eye.

"Hours passed before they spoke again. They had been at the utmost edge of exhaustion when they got into the canoe. Physical weakness may have made their minds more open to the belief that they were in more powerful hands than their own. Even as strength returned, the conviction remained strong. Wrapped in blankets, warmth returned to their bodies, bringing immense peace. The boat continued silently through the night with its two occupants. ""I do not know, Dagaeoga,"" replied the Onondaga in reverent tones. ""I too have dozed, but nothing has changed. We are still on the waters, carried by the west wind. I have always loved the west wind. Its breath is sweet, coming from the setting sun, the vast unknown plains, and the forests of the great valley. Now it guides us to safety."" ""Perhaps two hours, but we may reach land sooner. I sense the forest's scent. The west wind is fading, knowing we no longer need it. Surely land is near,"" said Tayoga.

Robert and Tayoga continued their journey cautiously along a beautiful northern river. The clear, silver waters flowed peacefully, surrounded by dense forests with blooming wildflowers. Birds sang sweetly, adding to the serene atmosphere. Despite the pleasant canoe ride, they encountered challenges like carrying the canoe around rippling shallows. The dense forest and the weight of the burden tested their strength. However, the abundance of game lifted their spirits. As they cooked deer by a fire, they remained watchful, believing in the importance of caution.

"After the distant echo of the last Indian canoe faded away, the two friends stealthily relaunched their own canoe, paddling silently until the edge of dawn. They reached a spot where thick bushes and tall grass grew along the riverbank. With great care and skill, they concealed their trusty little boat in the dense undergrowth, expertly camouflaging it so that even the sharpest Indian eye would not suspect anyone had been there.

""We should not rush, Dagaeoga,"" one of them remarked, ""lest we pass the Great Bear and the Mountain Wolf without realizing it. Let us head towards Oneadatote, where Rogers and his rangers often operate near George and Champlain.""

Traveling for two days and nights, they navigated through high ridges and peaks, watching for signs of the Great Bear. Eventually, Tayoga spotted subtle traces in the moss, indicating the Great Bear's presence.

In front of the log, you can see prints made by the heels of moccasins. The Great Bear tilted his feet up to rest only on the heels, an unusual stance for standing. Evidence shows he sat not to rest but to ponder. Several bark pieces where he sat were picked off, indicating deep thought and uncertainty. Traces reveal he hesitated between continuing forward or retracing his steps. The distance between footprints varied, suggesting changing pace and direction. Following the toeprints, it seems the Great Bear sought game near a lake, likely a wild fowl. A faint blood trace on the grass indicates a successful hunt for a wild goose.

Tayoga and Dagaeoga were on the trail of the Great Bear, a wise and skillful hunter. Tayoga pointed out clues along the way, teaching Dagaeoga to use his mind to interpret the signs left behind. They followed the path to where the Great Bear had cooked the fattest goose he had hunted. Tayoga explained how the Great Bear's hunger drove him to take risks and complete the task at hand. By observing the ashes, burnt sticks, and cleaned bones, Tayoga deduced that the Great Bear had eaten the entire goose.

After a satisfying meal, the Great Bear felt thirsty and sought a brook in the valley to quench his thirst. He knelt by the clear stream and drank deeply. However, his caution returned as he remembered the danger from warriors. The Great Bear cleverly waded in the stream to hide his trail, a common forest trick. Choosing to follow the current downstream, he moved swiftly to gain time and evade possible pursuit. Finding a dense bush, he rested and slept well, leaving behind a clear impression of his body. In the morning, refreshed and strong, he continued his journey eastward, leaving faint traces due to his vigor.

The Great Bear's movements were carefully observed by the Onondaga and his companions. They deduced that the bear was tracking a group of warriors, possibly a war party.

They enjoyed their cooked deer meat as darkness enveloped them, but they felt cozy and secure. Robert felt brave and optimistic, believing they would succeed in their mission. After a hard day's work, he fell into a deep sleep under the robe. Later, Tayoga, with his sharp senses, detected a human presence nearby. Knowing it was likely a foe, he readied himself, stealthily approaching the intruder. Tayoga, embodying the spirit of his Onondaga ancestors, confronted a Huron warrior who attacked him. In self-defense, Tayoga swiftly defeated the foe, regretting the need to take a life. He concealed the body, ensuring their safety, and returned to rest, keeping the encounter to himself."|"['1.

Tayoga stayed alert throughout the night, keeping a keen watch from the thicket. As dawn broke peacefully, Robert emerged, craving a change from deer meat to a juicy goose or duck. Tayoga suggested the left path, leading to fresh water, while the hidden warrior's body lay on the right. They discovered traces of the Great Bear's recent meal, realizing he was heading towards Lake Champlain. Tayoga suspected the Great Bear had left the rangers to pursue them. Later, they noticed another man had joined Willet, with distinctive large footprints. Tayoga recognized the newcomer's identity, hinting at a mysterious turn of events ahead.|"['1.

Willet and his companion, known as the Great Bear, were skilled hunters and brave warriors. They were so confident in their abilities that even a band of attackers would find it challenging to defeat them. Tracking them through the forest and observing their actions in battle revealed their expertise. The Great Bear and Black Rifle, as Willet's companion was called, split up after their meal, each going their separate ways. The Great Bear, without food of his own, relied on Black Rifle's provisions. Their caution was evident as they built a fire to cook and warm themselves, choosing a hidden spot to avoid detection. The Great Bear's precise shot at a squirrel showcased his skill and efficiency, emphasizing the importance of both mind and observation in wilderness survival.|"['1.

"""Dagaeoga, your eyes are valuable tools in the forest,"" Tayoga explained. ""Look closely at the bare bough and you'll see a spot of red, a sign of blood from the squirrel."" He pointed out bones nearby, evidence of the squirrel's demise. As they settled in for the night, they rekindled the abandoned fire and Robert kept watch. The fog enveloped the mountain, bringing a cold rain. Robert, vigilant, relied on his ears in the thick fog.

Wrapped in a buffalo robe, Robert rose quietly from the fire, proud of his silent steps. Beyond the firelight, he heard the distinct clank, urging him to investigate. Moving cautiously through the bushes, he descended a ravine slowly, wary of any misstep. As he approached, he saw a red glow through the fog, revealing a camp of warriors. Robert estimated their number to be around four or five hundred, many of them Canadian Indians. The warriors were well-armed and in high spirits, likely preparing to join Tandakora against Rogers and his rangers. Observing the stacked rifles, Robert felt anger at the sight of English and American weapons turned against their own. Determined to find Willet and warn him, Robert retraced his steps through the fog, eager to overtake his friends before the warriors could strike.|['1.

Two skilled scouts, Robert and Tayoga, are on a mission to track down the Great Bear and Black Rifle. The duo has a plan to smother a fire and hide in the protective fog to avoid detection. Tayoga's calm demeanor reassures Robert, and they take turns keeping watch. As the fog starts to thin, they know they must move quickly to avoid being seen. Following the trail left by the Great Bear and Black Rifle, they find evidence of the hunters' recent presence. The pursuit intensifies as they aim to catch up before the next sunset. Despite the hunters' caution, Robert and Tayoga remain determined to close in on their targets.|"['1.

Tayoga confidently predicted they would encounter their targets before noon, but the exact circumstances remained a mystery. The fresh trail indicated a recent change in direction by the pursued, leading to a vantage point atop a nearby peak. Robert speculated that the pursuers, the Great Bear and Black Rifle, might slow their pace due to the chase. Observing the trail closely, Tayoga inferred that the duo might be shifting focus from flight to confrontation. The signs suggested a tense moment where the pursued paused to assess their surroundings, potentially contemplating a strategic stand against their trackers. As they reached the hill's summit, a sudden turn of events forced the pursuers into an unexpected confrontation, setting the stage for a dramatic encounter.|"['1.

They discovered the junction point nearby and followed the deliberate trail towards Champlain in silence for hours. Tayoga paused on a ridge and signaled that they were close. Robert's heart raced, grateful for Willet's guidance. Tayoga's tracking skills led them to the valley where Willet and Black Rifle awaited. A bird's song broke the silence, signaling their arrival. The reunion was brief but heartfelt. Willet explained the urgent situation - a large Indian army moving south to join Montcalm. The group swiftly moved on, aware of the enemy's pursuit. Traveling day and night, they reached Lake Champlain, where Rogers' ranger camp awaited. News of the approaching war band under St. Luc heightened tensions.

Robert didn't hear the conversation as he sought rest in the ranger camp. Carrying only his arms and ammunition, he felt the relief of unburdening himself. The rangers, hospitable, allowed them to relax, and the two youths enjoyed a refreshing bath in the lake. After a deep sleep, Robert sensed the tension in the camp. Rogers, Willet, and the leaders discussed the approaching danger from the north or west. The scouts reported St. Luc's advancing force, now strong with a thousand men.

Their eyes fixed on the dark dot that grew larger on the horizon, Robert and Tayoga observed a canoe approaching swiftly with two warriors on board. The warriors halted at a distance, watching the shore intently. As the canoe retreated and then returned with a fleet of war canoes, the tension heightened. Shots rang out from the forest, and the group on the cliff, including Willet and Black Rifle, prepared for a confrontation. Despite the enemy fleet advancing, Willet's group stood their ground, exchanging fire. The battle intensified as bullets flew, taking a toll on the defenders. Willet remained resolute, urging his men to keep firing. Amid the chaos, Robert stayed focused, seeking targets through the thick smoke.

The enemies on the lake fought quietly, with only the sound of rifles breaking the silence. Robert suddenly heard loud shouting behind him. He had been so focused on their own battle that he had forgotten about the main fight. Looking back, he saw smoke and flashes of red in the forest, where the rangers were under heavy attack. The Indians let out triumphant yells as the cannon fired, causing heavy casualties among the rangers. The echoes of the cannon reverberated through the mountains, creating a sense of impending doom. The French and Indians intensified their assault, pushing the rangers back. Robert caught sight of familiar faces among the enemy, including De Courcelles, who had tried to harm him before.

In the heat of battle, Robert and his comrades faced a fierce French and Indian horde. As they fought valiantly, Robert's aim wavered when he recognized a familiar face among the enemy. His hesitation saved a life, yet brought him face to face with the chilling war cries of Tandakora, a fierce Ojibway warrior. Despite the chaos and danger, Robert's resolve remained strong, fueled by the Sun God's guidance whispered to his friend Tayoga. The battle raged on, with the voice of Tandakora echoing ominously, a constant reminder of the ultimate showdown to come.

Tayoga spoke fervently, and Robert, his face shining through the smoke, looked at him with awe, feeling the weight of his words. Tandakora's booming voice pierced the chaos, his invisible presence commanding his fierce warriors. Armed with French muskets, they advanced, firing relentlessly. Despite the rangers' valiant defense, the enemy pressed on, undeterred by losses. Tayoga explained the enemy's confidence in victory, their determination to crush the rangers. Robert and Tayoga, unharmed amidst the chaos, witnessed the rangers dwindling. Rogers, realizing the dire situation, ordered a retreat. St. Luc's forces overwhelmed the rangers, driving them to scatter. Black Rifle stayed with Rogers, while Robert, Tayoga, and Willet fled southward, seeking safety.

The trio encountered a vast army on the trail the next day, with soldiers and cannons. Nightfall caught them near Lake George, exhausted from their escape. Seeking refuge in thickets, they ate, wrapped in blankets to shield from the chilly wind and drizzle. Despite setbacks, Willet remained steadfast, attributing their challenges to the ebb and flow of war. Believing in divine protection, Tayoga sensed Tododaho's watchful eye over them. A war party passed close by, unaware of their presence. The next morning, they detected traces of a white man, Langlade, ahead. A sudden ambush ensued, leading to a fierce skirmish.

On a dark and rainy night, Tayoga and his companions silently evaded danger, feeling grateful for their escape. Tayoga saw their safety as a sign from Manitou, the ruler of all things. Despite the challenges they faced, he believed they were meant to survive. As they journeyed near Andiatarocte's shores, they glimpsed the enemy's canoes on the lake, realizing its strategic importance. The trio's flight became easier as the rain stopped, and they encountered a deer for food. Tayoga sensed impending danger from Montcalm's advancing forces, based on subtle signs in nature. Following faint traces in the forest, he predicted an imminent confrontation with the enemy.|"[""1.

"""In the northern valley, warriors cooked and ate deer they had hunted,"" Tayoga explained. ""They kept to themselves, leaving few white men's footprints. Nearby, the cannons were parked. An Onondaga child could read the camp's story. Cannon wheel impressions and hoofprints reveal where artillery horses were tethered. Willet noted that French leaders were meticulous, setting up tents to inspire respect. They held a council by a log, planning an attack on Fort William Henry. Traces of ashes and knife marks suggest deliberation. Tayoga observed that chiefs and French officers discussed strategy. Mindful of details, they deduced Montcalm's tent was the largest, a move for prestige. Tayoga emphasized training the mind for keen observation, a lesson in wisdom."""|"['1.
