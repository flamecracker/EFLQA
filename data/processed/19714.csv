Fergus, a young soldier, was eager to excel in swordsmanship. The best masters, the marshal and Herr Van Bruff, trained him intensely. Fergus's days were packed, training from ten to half-past eleven with Herr Van Bruff and from six to half-past with the marshal. His mountain training toughened him for the rigorous barrack sessions. Despite initial wrist pain, his skill grew rapidly. The marshal was impressed, saying Fergus was becoming a formidable swordsman. Fergus's regimental duties kept him busy, and his teachers were pleased with his progress. As war loomed with Austria, the troops prepared for battle. The sudden declaration of war against Austria, with potential powerful allies, initially caused alarm. However, the soldiers were enthusiastic, eager to showcase their prowess in the upcoming conflict.|"[""1.

The grand assembly at the palace the night before the troops' departure was dazzling. General officers, their staff, court ladies, and nobility gathered. The jovial king mingled freely. Princess Amelia, though charming, wore a sorrowful look, mourning Baron Trench, imprisoned for seeking her hand. Conversations buzzed about the impending campaign. Two aides-de-camp, Fergus and Lindsay, discussed the uncertainties of war. They reflected on the advantages of foreign service, where defeat bore less personal consequences.

During a military campaign, each officer carried essential items in their saddlebag for meals - a tin plate, a drinking horn, and a knife, fork, and spoon. The soldiers shared a meal where soup was served first, followed by hare and sucking pig. Spirits were also provided. The night was pleasant, so they decided against setting up tents. The next day's orders were distributed, and the army camped near Torgau. The force then moved towards Dresden, a city in Saxony. The Prussian army aimed to secure Saxony's neutrality to protect their communication lines. Frederick found a crucial treaty in Dresden, justifying his actions. Soldiers were ordered to behave respectfully towards the citizens. One evening, Fergus heard a gunshot and decided to investigate, leading him to a mysterious house.|"['1.

With difficulty, due to his unsuitable high boots, he climbed a tree, reached a wall, and descended into large park-like grounds. Spotting a light in a window, he hurried to the house, finding the door shut. Moving along, he found an open window and entered through it. Inside, a lit hall caught his attention. Upstairs, he heard voices and cautiously ascended with weapons in hand. At the top, he discovered two dead men. Peeking into a room, he found scared women guarded by a soldier. Not wanting to cause an alarm, he retreated. Approaching a grand room, he heard voices and entered to find a gentleman dead, a pale lady, and a girl bound.

No, indeed. We do not completely block the direct route, but our position, along with Marshal Schwerin facing Koeniggraetz, threatens their retreat path, preventing them from leaving their cover. Our cavalry makes it hard for any supplies to reach them without a large army escort. There are paths over the hills where infantry could pass, but with no safe haven to retreat to, we could easily catch up and force them to surrender. The king arrived a few hours later, and orders were given for cavalry and infantry to march at dawn, with the rest following two hours later.

A long journey brought them to Prague, where the news of victory spread joy among the people. Bonfires lit the streets, bells rang, and the town celebrated.

The prisoners were taken to a military prison, given comfortable quarters, and received medical care. Fergus and Kerr bid farewell, expecting to be moved to Olmuetz or another fortress. The war's course would likely confine them to Bohemia until spring, with looming threats from France, Austria, and Russia.

In April, Frederick of Prussia made secret preparations to invade Bohemia. With three armies ready, he surprised the Austrians by crossing into Bohemia on the 20th of that month. The Austrians had to abandon their supplies, which fell into Prussian hands. The Prussian light corps captured towns and spread fear. The Austrian armies retreated to Prague, where Prince Karl took command. Frederick's forces closely followed and reached Prague on May 2nd. Thirty thousand Prussians under Marshal Keith watched Prague while Frederick and Schwerin's forces made a junction. The Austrians, led by an inactive Prince Karl, did not interfere. Frederick's forces crossed the river and prepared to face the Austrians the next day. The Austrians had a strong defensive position, but their inaction allowed the Prussians to advance.|"['1.

Daun's new position was strong, but only vulnerable on the right. The Prussian army was directed to ignore Austrian fire and advance. Ziethen's hussars defeated Austrian cavalry, while Hulsen's infantry took the village of Preezer. Hulsen then battled Austrians in a wood, unsupported due to Mannstein's impulsive attack elsewhere. Prince Maurice also engaged prematurely. Despite fierce fighting, the Prussians were forced to retreat. Daun hesitated to pursue as the Prussians withdrew. The Prussian losses were significant, prompting Frederick to prepare to lift the siege of Prague. The news of defeat spread, causing allies to rejoice. The Prussian army regrouped at Leitmeritz, a strategic location for defense.

Efforts were made to fill the gaps in the regiments at Prague and Kolin with fresh troops, who were trained rigorously to join the veterans. The king stayed in the cathedral close, while Keith's division was across the river. Prince Maurice and Bevern went to Bunzlau but were recalled when Austrian troops approached.

Before it had died away, similar calls echoed from all parts of the town. Soldiers ran hastily through the streets, mounted officers dashed in every direction, and the citizens came to their doors, in surprise at this sudden movement. Fergus had no longer any doubt about the cause of the stir. The great thing now was to ascertain whether the army would advance to take up some strong position outside the town and oppose the Prussian advance, or whether they would march away. Being fifty thousand in number, the former would appear to be the natural course for a general to adopt, as Frederick had with him but twenty-three thousand men. Of this fact, however, Soubise would be ignorant and might only have heard that the Prussian army was marching to annihilate him. Fergus followed them to the plain outside the town. The tents had already been struck; the troops, as they arrived from the town and camp, were marshaled in order; a long train of baggage wagons was already making their way westward; and there was no longer any grounds for doubt that Soubise was retreating.|"['1.

Fergus rode swiftly back to the Prussian camp after gathering intelligence on the French movements in Erfurt. He assured the main road was clear of enemy forces. Fergus had overheard French officers discussing their plans during breakfast, revealing the French were unaware of nearby Prussian troops. As Fergus reached the Prussian camp, he learned that the French were retreating westward, leaving Erfurt. Fergus shared his findings with the king, who appreciated the timely information.

A group of French non-commissioned officers expressed dissatisfaction with their general and the delays. They showed contempt for the Confederacy army, crediting Austrian non-commissioned officers for their discipline. The king acknowledged the risks Captain Drummond took to gather information. The troops set off early, and Frederick rode ahead to Erfurt. The marshal praised Drummond's German skills for missions. The conversation highlighted the Prussian officers' rigidity and lack of adaptability compared to Drummond's language skills and quick thinking. Seidlitz occupied Gotha briefly, impressing the duke and duchess, but had to retreat when faced with a larger enemy force. The enemy entered Gotha victoriously, and the duke and duchess hosted a banquet for the officers.|"['1.

In October, the news of an imminent threat to Berlin spread. General Haddick and his force of four thousand appeared to be a formidable fifteen thousand. The governor of Berlin, with only four thousand troops, decided not to resist, evacuating the royal family and archives. Haddick demanded a ransom but settled for 27,000 pounds before leaving. Prince Maurice arrived shortly after. The false news of Berlin's capture sparked enthusiasm in Paris and Vienna, prompting reinforcements for Soubise, who marched towards Leipzig. Frederick, Ferdinand, and Maurice reached Leipzig first. Meanwhile, in England, Pitt empowered Prince Ferdinand to lead the army, replacing the ineffective Duke of Cumberland. Soubise retreated before Frederick's forces, and a victory at Weissenfels ensued. The Prussians built a bridge swiftly, outmaneuvering Soubise.

On the 4th of the month, the army began moving at two in the morning under the light of a bright moon. They soon realized that the enemy had repositioned themselves to a stronger location with wooded and marshy defenses. The Prussian army retreated to their camp, hoping the enemy, now far from their supplies, would make a move that would allow for a better attack. The area around Weissenfels slowly rises to a height of about a hundred and twenty feet, considered a hill in the flat region. Villages like Rossbach, where Frederick's right wing was stationed, and Bedra, where his left was located, dotted this slight elevation. As the enemy began to move towards their left, Frederick observed from a house in Rossbach. Little did he know that the enemy's slow movements were leading to a flank attack.|"['1.

Frederick's infantry swiftly advanced over the hill with a thunderous artillery barrage. The French, caught off guard, struggled to reposition as chaos ensued. Despite their efforts, the Prussian forces swiftly closed in, unleashing a devastating volley upon the disarrayed enemy. The French ranks crumbled under the relentless assault, and a surprise cavalry charge from Seidlitz sealed their fate. In a matter of moments, what was once a formidable army became a disorganized mass of fleeing soldiers. The Prussian victory, achieved with a significantly smaller force, dealt a severe blow to the defeated allies.

Fergus, a loyal officer to the king, was relied upon greatly by Frederick. Despite Fergus's recent illness, Frederick needed him by his side. The surrender of Schweidnitz came as a shock to Frederick, as it was a strong fortress that fell too easily. The blame was placed on the weak commandant and the desertion of Saxon troops. The news worsened as Prince Karl attacked Bevern, resulting in heavy losses for the Prussians. Bevern's capture was seen as intentional by Frederick. Breslau's surrender followed, leading to more setbacks. Frederick, though facing adversity, remained resolute and prepared to confront the enemy with his diminished forces.

The foe, five cavalry regiments, stationed to protect the army, were caught off guard and swiftly defeated. Frederick, after scouting the terrain, identified the Austrian forces from Borne to Sagschuetz. He discerned Sagschuetz as a prime target due to its favorable layout for a surprise attack. Concealed behind hills, the Prussians marched towards Sagschuetz unseen. As the Prussian columns gathered at Borne, they were ordered to advance obliquely towards the Austrian left. Austrian generals, unable to see beyond the hills, speculated on the Prussian movements. The Austrian right wing commander, Lucchesi, feared an imminent attack and requested reinforcements. Daun finally sent aid, realizing the impending Prussian assault.

Ten minutes into the fight, the Austrian left was in trouble. The Prussian army focused on it, causing chaos. Prince Karl tried to stop the Prussians, but they were too quick. The Prussians overcame obstacles and charged into the Austrian troops, capturing many. The Austrians tried to regroup at Leuthen, but the Prussians were already upon them. The battle intensified as both sides fought fiercely. The Prussians, like a well-oiled machine, relentlessly attacked. Eventually, the Prussians broke through the Austrian defenses, forcing them to retreat. The Austrians attempted a final stand at Saara, but it was futile.

Tired from their long night of work, the soldiers were not yet finished with their task. The king asked for volunteers to accompany him to the village of Lissa. Three battalions stepped forward as the landlord of the inn walked beside the king with a lantern. As they neared Lissa, shots were fired, but no one was harmed.

On January 16th, an important event took place as Frederick crossed the border and entered Koenigsberg. He declared that his sovereign now ruled East Prussia and demanded all officials and prominent individuals to pledge their allegiance. Despite the recent devastation and strong anti-Russian sentiment in East Prussia, the people had no choice but to comply. Many young men secretly joined the Prussian army, while the impoverished residents raised funds to support Frederick. With English financial aid, Frederick was able to sustain his efforts effectively. The campaign unfolded with victories for Ferdinand of Brunswick and Frederick, who besieged and captured Schweidnitz and then Olmuetz.

Rarely has such a fierce battle been seen. As night fell, the Russian forces were steadily pushed back. General Demikof tried to regroup with 2,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry on a hill, but Frederick dispersed them. Despite orders to attack, the Dohna soldiers fled in disarray. The conflict halted at nightfall, allowing the Russians to retreat. The Cossacks looted the battlefield under the cover of darkness, but were later confronted and defeated by Prussian hussars. The next day, the Russians retreated, leaving behind a scene of devastation. Both sides suffered heavy losses, with the Prussians losing a third of their troops. Frederick, unable to pursue the retreating Russians, had to leave to defend Saxony. Amid the chaos, Fergus bravely protected the king from Russian attackers, fighting off two of them before they retreated.|['1.

A moment later, there was a loud sound of hooves as Seidlitz charged into the Russian forces, altering the battle's outcome. Fergus, caught up in the excitement, followed Seidlitz's cavalry into the fray. Engaged in fierce combat, Fergus sustained multiple wounds but continued fighting. After the clash subsided, Fergus found himself riding back with Seidlitz's forces, his horse injured but not critically. Upon reaching the king's location, Fergus was tended to by Karl, who bandaged his wounds and offered him a drink. As darkness fell and the battle raged on, Fergus rested while Karl attended to their horses.

Karl expertly tended to the wounds, reassuring his comrade that they were not severe. The worst was a flesh wound on his leg, but it was under control. After securing the horses, Karl and his fellow soldiers shared a meal by the fireside. They discussed the fierce battle they had just faced, amazed by the relentless Russian soldiers. Despite their initial defeat, the Russians fought bravely, leaving a lasting impression on the troops. Karl recalled a heroic act by Fritz, who had saved the king's life during the chaos of battle.

"Shortly after leaving, Sir John Mitchell visited Fergus. As the English ambassador had met Fergus several times in the king's chambers over the past two winters, they were familiar with each other. Mitchell saw Fergus as helpful in engaging Frederick and diverting his mind from troubles. ""That lad is different from most of your countrymen,"" Mitchell noted.

The doctor insisted that Fergus wait until the end of September before leaving Frankfort. Despite the delay, Fergus felt relieved by the news that Daun had retreated from Meissen to Stolpen, blocking Frederick's path to Silesia. Neisse was under siege and needed relief, but Daun's strategic move at Stolpen hindered their progress. Fergus followed the doctor's orders and took a four-day journey to Dresden. Despite his friend Lindsay's jests about Fergus's rising fortunes in battle, Fergus downplayed his achievements, acknowledging the challenges and setbacks he faced. The conversation turned to the ongoing war, with concerns about the prolonged conflict and the toll it was taking on the army. Lindsay expressed hope for a swifter resolution to the war, while Fergus remained pragmatic about the challenges ahead.|"[""1.

Drummond, I hope your sword cuts won't leave lasting scars. It would be tough to have your looks affected at just nineteen, even though people think you're a bit older. But, if they're from battle, they'll be honorable scars, and women don't mind a man's battle wounds. It would have been better if you got them while defending the king, not during the cavalry charge. Fergus, like me, has honorable scars too, from defending the king. He got a bad wound on the flank and may have white hair grow on it. He also survived a bullet through the neck, missing vital parts. The count congratulated him on his promotion to major for his valor. The count and his family were glad to see Fergus back in Dresden after his absence since Frederick's march against Soubise. The count mentioned that he wished Saxony had understood earlier to fight alongside them. Drummond shared stories of battles and how his mother was proud of his service for the Protestant prince. The count agreed that many now see their cause as their own, especially after the enemy's mistreatment of Saxony's people. Despite the wounds, Drummond and Fergus healed quickly, hoping the scars would fade with time.|"['1.

Count Fergus contemplated his future as a soldier amidst the brutal war scenes. He expressed a desire for a peaceful life after the conflict, unlike his cousin Marshal Keith, who had no home or tranquility. The Count acknowledged the horrors of the ongoing war, where death seemed almost certain. Discussing the imminent battle near Dresden, Fergus speculated on the strategies of the opposing armies. Despite the uncertainty, he prepared to march with the army the next day, destination unknown. The Count offered support, but Fergus, financially prudent, declined, having saved from his pay. Grateful for the Count's past assistance, Fergus hoped never to need the funds. The army set off towards Bautzen, facing challenges but moving forward with determination.|"['1.

In the past, Frederick was forced to abandon his stronghold due to the Prussians' threat at Hochkirch. He then occupied hills near Zittau. Waiting for supplies at Bautzen, he later joined the division at Hochkirch. Despite Daun's army intrenching, Frederick underestimated Daun's attack. Frederick's officers were uneasy about their position. The village of Hochkirch had a view for miles except for the south, where hills rose. The Devil's Hill was believed to be haunted. Frederick's force was spread out, with Keith at Hochkirch and Retzow at Weissenberg. Daun's force, much larger, planned a surprise attack on Frederick's right wing. Daun's generals convinced him to attack, leading to a plan to encircle Frederick's army. The attack was set for early Saturday morning, aiming to defeat Frederick's smaller force.|"[""1.

Frederick was unaware of the approaching storm. The Austrians were busy strengthening their defenses on Thursday and Friday, while skirmishes with Prussian outposts went unnoticed in Hochkirch. Fergus, up early as usual, heard distant gunfire. Concerned about the nearby enemy, he prepared for potential danger. The sound of ongoing battle prompted him to light lanterns for guidance in the dark. As they approached Hochkirch, the village was alive with troops mustering for defense. Fergus rode towards the sounds of battle, realizing the seriousness of the situation. With difficulty navigating crowded streets, they pushed forward towards the farmhouse, where the enemy had launched a surprise attack on the right flank and rear. The battery was under heavy fire, signaling a fierce battle ahead.|"['Question 1:\nWhat prompted Fergus to light lanterns for guidance in the dark?\nA) The sound of distant gunfire\nB) The approaching storm\nC) The mustering of troops in Hochkirch\nD) The strengthening of Austrian defenses\nE) The skirmishes with Prussian outposts', 'Question 2:\nWhy was Fergus concerned about the nearby enemy?\nA) Due to the approaching storm\nB) Because of the ongoing battle\nC) The mustering of troops in Hochkirch\nD) The surprise attack on the right flank and rear\nE) The skirmishes with Prussian outposts', ""Question 3:\nWhat did Fergus realize as he rode towards the sounds of battle?\nA) The seriousness of the situation\nB) The need to strengthen defenses\nC) The approaching storm\nD) The presence of Austrian troops\nE) The enemy's location in Hochkirch"", 'Question 4:\nWhy did Fergus have difficulty navigating the crowded streets?\nA) Due to the approaching storm\nB) The mustering of troops in Hochkirch\nC) The surprise attack on the right flank and rear\nD) The sound of distant gunfire\nE) The battery under heavy fire', 'Question 5:\nWhat signaled a fierce battle ahead according to the text?\nA) The approaching storm\nB) The sound of distant gunfire\nC) The mustering of troops in Hochkirch\nD) The enemy launching a surprise attack\nE) The skirmishes with Prussian outposts', 'Question 6:\nWhere were the Austrians busy strengthening their defenses on Thursday and Friday?\nA) Hochkirch\nB) The farmhouse\nC) The battery\nD) The right flank\nE) The rear']"|['A) The sound of distant gunfire', 'B) Because of the ongoing battle', 'A) The seriousness of the situation', 'C) The surprise attack on the right flank and rear', 'D) The enemy launching a surprise attack', 'A) Hochkirch']
The commander bravely decided to confront the Kannaker battalion alone and rode swiftly to their camp, sending his staff to rally nearby regiments. He instructed Fergus to check on the village and retake a battery while holding the village. Fergus quickly returned to find a fierce battle raging. The Prussians, aided by fresh battalions, fought fiercely, using bayonets in the misty confusion. The village was nearly lost, but the defenders held on, aided by flames lighting the way. Further on, the Plothow battalion valiantly defended the battery against overwhelming odds. Ziethen's horse charged in, freeing prisoners and scattering the enemy. In the chaos, isolated fights erupted everywhere as Prussian forces battled the Austrians in the darkness.

In the area surrounding Hochkirch, intense battles were unfolding. Despite the challenges, soldiers stood their ground, regrouping and launching counterattacks. The cavalry, including Ziethen's horse, fought fiercely against the encroaching Austrians. Lange's battalion bravely defended the churchyard until their ammunition was depleted. Facing dwindling numbers, they resorted to a bayonet charge to break through enemy lines. Fergus and Karl, seizing an opportunity, made a swift escape on horseback. Meanwhile, as the King approached, the battlefield intensified. Tragic losses occurred, including the death of Frank of Brunswick and the injury of Prince Maurice of Dessau. Frederick found himself surrounded and was forced to surrender. Despite setbacks, Frederick managed to reorganize his forces and secure a new defensive position. The Prussians, though battered, held their ground against subsequent Austrian attacks.

During the battle, many Austrians were killed or wounded, and a thousand were taken as prisoners. As the Austrians passed through the dark woods, twenty thousand deserted. Fergus, a young officer, was captured but remained with his regiment until the fighting ended. He inquired about Marshal Keith, fearing he was killed. Two officers reported that the marshal had fallen in battle. Fergus was deeply saddened by this news, as he held Keith in high regard, almost like a father figure. Later, he was summoned to see General Lacy, who was surprised to see such a young officer holding the rank of major. Promotion in the Prussian army was usually slow, but Fergus had risen quickly due to his bravery and service.|['1.

The following day, Lacy and Fergus Drummond led the procession as the main mourners for Marshal Keith's burial at Hochkirch church. A grand military procession with solemn music and soldiers paying their respects accompanied the gun carriage carrying the marshal's remains. After the service, Keith was laid to rest with twelve cannon salutes and musket volleys. Months later, his body was moved to Berlin for a military burial. Lacy regretfully informed Fergus that he needed to continue his journey with a new officer escort. The convoy traveled south, making stops for wounded officers to recover. Fergus was relieved not to be in a group heading to his former prison, where he might be recognized. Arriving at Linz, they were assigned to a fortified prison near the Danube River.

"Stauffen admitted, ""I hadn't considered that. If we were to escape through this door, which seems unlikely, it would be an advantage.""

Fergus had earned his promotion through heroic actions, such as rescuing Count Eulenfurst's family, saving the Prussian cavalry at Lobositz, and protecting the king at Zorndorf.

Fergus found it challenging to engage in conversation with the two officers, who were adamant about upholding their ranks. He decided to stop trying to bridge the gap they were creating.

We must abandon our clothes and swim in our undergarments. It's wise to carry extra suits on our heads while swimming. Once we reach a boat, we change into dry clothes. We could either overpower boatmen for their clothes or land at a house to get new attire. After lying low, we should travel west for at least fifty miles. Munich, Landshut, Ratisbon, and Bayreuth are possible destinations. There's a good chance of success if we act swiftly. Removing the rivets is the first task; sawing them off with oiled knives seems doable. This plan, if executed on a dark stormy night, should help us escape unnoticed.|['1.

Three men appeared on a boat on the river, startling the three boatmen already on board. The strangers demanded clothes without causing harm, offering to pay a fair price.

The next day, Fergus embarked on a journey to Breslau riding a new horse gifted by the count, with Karl leading Tartar. The trip was uneventful, and upon reaching Breslau, Fergus learned that the king had moved to Landshut with a portion of his army. From Landshut, the king controlled the main pass to Bohemia and could swiftly respond to any threat from Daun towards Silesia or Dresden. The war had already seen significant action with Prince Henry defeating the Confederate army, Prince of Brunswick capturing prisoners, and Duke Ferdinand engaging the French army. Prince Henry's swift maneuvers included destroying Austrian magazines and capturing prisoners, showcasing his strategic prowess. Frederick warmly welcomed Fergus back, acknowledging his bravery and accomplishments during the war.|['1.

He's supposed to have dinner with me tonight, and afterward, he will share the story with us. Mitchell will also dine with us. He is a friend of this young soldier and holds him in high regard. For months, the Prussian and Austrian armies remained inactive. Daun had assumed that the king would follow his usual strategy of attacking Bohemia. However, Frederick, with his reduced forces, decided to stay on the defensive. He waited for the Austrians to make a move. The slow pace of the Austrian army allowed Frederick to plan his attacks carefully. It took a while for the Austrian general to realize Frederick's new approach and abandon his defensive tactics. By July, the Austrians were in a strong position at Marklissa, while Frederick bided his time. The Austrian general knew Frederick was eager for battle but waited for the approaching Russian troops before making a move.|"[""1.

One officer criticized a fellow soldier as ill-tempered but brave. Despite delivering messages to General Sackville, Fergus never spoke to him. The English general barely acknowledged Fergus, reading despatches that often displeased him. Fergus grew to dislike him, leading to a confrontation. Fergus questioned the lack of salutes returned by Sackville, prompting a discussion. The Duke of Brunswick acknowledged Sackville's troublesome behavior. The duke tactically gained control of Bremen and Osnabrueck, weakening the French supply line. To provoke the French, the duke sent the Hereditary Prince to Gohfeld, risking a battle with fewer troops. The French took the bait, seeing an opportunity to defeat the duke's army.|"[""1.

On a misty morning, the French and British troops faced off at the Battle of Minden. The French cavalry, ten thousand strong, launched repeated attacks against the British infantry, but were repulsed each time. The British regiments, including the 12th, 20th, 23rd, 25th, 37th, and 51st, stood their ground and delivered a devastating file fire that stopped the French cavalry in its tracks. The British, following the beat of their drums, held their fire until the enemy was within forty paces, then unleashed a barrage that decimated the French forces. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the British infantry stood firm and successfully repelled the attacks, creating history by repulsing a superior force of cavalry.|"['1.

The duke ordered Fergus to convey a message to Lord Sackville to charge with his cavalry, but Sackville hesitated. Despite several attempts to persuade him, Sackville remained reluctant. His inaction led to a missed opportunity to defeat the French army at Minden. Meanwhile, the British infantry's remarkable performance astonished Europe. While the battle unfolded, the Hereditary Prince executed a successful maneuver against the French, forcing them to retreat. Sackville's failure to act resulted in his recall and disgrace. Major Drummond received a hostile message from Sackville, leading to a duel arrangement with Major Kurstad as his representative. The duel was to be conducted with swords, as pistols were uncommon in such situations. Both sides agreed to have a second accompany them to witness the duel.|"[""1.

At the agreed time, both parties met at a designated spot. Fergus was joined by Major Kurstad, another officer, and the duke's surgeon. The seconds exchanged formal greetings. The duelling swords were inspected and deemed equal. The location was chosen in a shaded area of the woods. Lord Sackville, known for his fencing skills but lacking in physique, faced Fergus, who was fit and agile. The general, filled with animosity, faced Fergus, who remained indifferent. Coats were removed, and the duel began with Fergus advising Sackville on his technique. Despite Sackville's cautious play, Fergus easily bested him, piercing his arm. Sackville, acknowledging his fault, apologized to Fergus for his behavior. Fergus accepted the apology, emphasizing the importance of respect and understanding among officers.|"['1.

The two sides then said goodbye and rode back to their respective camps. While Fergus's friends kept quiet about the duel, Sackville openly discussed it with other officers the night before, expressing his wish that it had been the Duke of Brunswick instead of Fergus. Sackville faced consequences upon his return to England, being stripped of his military rank by a court martial. The king personally removed him from the council, considering it a severe punishment. Sackville's behavior at Minden remains unexplained, with some speculating he was disgruntled at having to wake early. The more likely theory is his desire to see the Duke fail in battle, hoping to take his place as commander. Following the victory at Minden, bad news arrived of Prussian defeats, including Frederick's heavy loss at Kunersdorf. Despite initial despair, Frederick regrouped, and Dresden was lost due to a premature surrender following Frederick's letter.|"['1.

During a critical time, Fink, along with thousands of men, was dispatched to assist Wunsch in relieving Dresden. Although they failed in their initial objective, they recaptured Leipzig and other towns seized by the Confederate army, reclaiming all of Saxony except Dresden. Schmettau was relieved of his duties due to a lack of firmness, but his past record as one of Frederick's esteemed generals was acknowledged. Frederick, known for holding his generals to high standards, expected success. Meanwhile, Prince Henry's strategic retreat kept Daun's army on edge, outmaneuvering them until their location was finally revealed after four days of uncertainty.

Henry took a different route, marching west from Rothenburg to Klitten, 18 miles away. After a brief rest, he traveled another 20 miles to surprise General Weyler and his 33,000 troops at the Austrian position. Weyler, unaware of the threat from the east, was caught off guard. In the ensuing battle, 600 of his soldiers perished, and he, along with many others, was captured. This bold 50-hour march covered 58 miles and changed the course of the campaign. Prince Henry's strategic move forced Daun to retreat, but Frederick's impulsive decision to send a small force under Fink backfired. Fink's troops were surrounded and suffered significant losses. The blame fell on Fink, unfairly, as Frederick's risky tactics led to the defeat.

In a strategic move, Frederick outmaneuvered Daun and his forces at the Battle of Torberger. Despite being outnumbered, Frederick's army of thirty thousand cleverly laid a trap for Daun's forces of ninety thousand. As night fell, Frederick's army silently retreated to the heights of Torberger, leaving behind burning fires to deceive the enemy. Daun and Lacy, believing they had caught Frederick off guard, marched towards Liegnitz, only to be met by Loudon's troops unexpectedly. A fierce battle ensued, with Loudon attempting to flank Frederick's forces. However, Frederick's troops held their ground and repelled the Austrian attacks.

During the recent battles, the French suffered significant losses, with fifteen hundred soldiers killed, over two thousand captured, and the loss of their artillery. On the other side, the allies, including the British, had twelve hundred casualties. Frederick, despite facing challenges, received positive news that General Hulsen had triumphed over a much larger enemy force in Saxony. Meanwhile, Prince Henry fell ill, but Frederick successfully joined forces with him, bolstering their army to fifty thousand soldiers. Throughout September, there were strategic movements, with Frederick outmaneuvering Daun and preventing the Austrians from besieging their fortresses. Notably, General Werner achieved a surprise victory over the Russians, forcing them to retreat from Colbert. However, the Russians, in collaboration with Daun, planned an assault on Berlin. Despite the overwhelming odds, negotiations ensued, resulting in Berlin paying a ransom to the invaders.

The king expressed his hope that the war would end soon, as he never desired it. He was willing to agree to any terms for peace. Frederick, after several battles, aimed to attack Daun's impregnable camp in Torgau. Daun's position was on Siptitz's heights, surrounded by vineyards and covered by woods and ponds. Frederick planned to attack from the front and rear simultaneously. Despite the difficult terrain and weather, Frederick's troops marched towards the camp. The king's column contained grenadiers, foot guards, and cavalry. Daun, alerted by scouts, repositioned his forces to defend against Frederick's attack from the north. Meanwhile, Ziethen encountered a small Austrian force delaying his progress towards the camp. This delay hindered the coordination of the attacks, with Ziethen engaging Lacy instead of ascending the hills to aid the king.|"[""1.

When Frederick's soldiers emerged from the forest, they couldn't find Hulsen or Holstein's troops. The king sent his staff to locate them while he scouted the area. The ground was too wet to cross, so Frederick retreated back into the woods to plan an attack on the Austrian left flank. The Austrians had used their defenses for firewood, making it easier to penetrate. Despite the delay, Frederick decided to attack alone to support Ziethen. The grenadiers led the charge, with infantry in the center and cavalry behind. As they advanced, the Austrian cannons roared, causing heavy casualties. The Prussians fought bravely but were pushed back. Eventually, Holstein's cavalry arrived, and the Prussians regrouped for another assault under the cover of darkness. Daun's forces were caught off guard, allowing the Prussians to briefly gain ground before being pushed back. Despite being injured, Frederick continued to lead his troops in battle.|"[""1.

The cavalry faced challenges on the battlefield, making it difficult to carry out their planned attack. Despite this, two regiments managed to succeed and capture Austrian soldiers and guns. Frederick's troops displayed extraordinary bravery but suffered heavy losses. Daun, the Austrian commander, was wounded, which disrupted their forces. Exhausted, the Prussians rested on the cold hilltop, while fires burned in the forest below. Enemies gathered around the fires, setting aside their differences for the night. The king, wounded and in pain, sought refuge in a village church. Generals struggled to regroup the troops, with Ziethen failing to support the king during battle. Eventually, Ziethen made a move towards the enemy, capturing a battery but facing obstacles. Mollendorf's timely intervention helped secure a crucial pass, allowing the Prussians to regroup.|"['1.

The Austrians were alarmed and rushed to oppose the passage, but Mollendorf had troops across the bridge, holding his ground until reinforced. A fierce battle ensued for an hour and a half. The Prussians struggled to advance while the Austrians received constant reinforcements. Hulsen, noticing increased cannon fire and a glowing fire from the village of Siptitz, realized Ziethen was approaching. Despite fatigue and injuries, the old general led his troops towards the battle, where they joined Ziethen's forces.

We rushed away, feeling triumphant, to try and drive the Austrians out of Dresden. They laughed at us from their mountain tops. Feeling defeated, I retreated to a humble village in Saxony. My plan is to push the Reich's army out of Freyberg and settle somewhere with food and shelter. This life has aged me terribly, my hair is gray, teeth are falling out, and wrinkles cover my face.
