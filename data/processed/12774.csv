Their instructions required them to arrive at 9.15. Dan wanted to immediately meet the aide to the superintendent. However, Dave disagreed, suggesting they strictly follow their orders. While waiting, the young men admired the impressive buildings of the Naval Academy, particularly the grand Bancroft Hall. This hall houses the midshipmen's mess, barracks for a thousand young men, offices, and a large recreation hall. As the midshipmen were busy with drills and instructions, the grounds seemed empty.

As the young men ascended the long white steps to Bancroft Hall, a mix of excitement and uncertainty filled their hearts. Would this grand government training school become their home for the next four years? Would it be the place they would always remember as their alma mater? These questions hinged on the verdict of the Naval surgeons who would examine them. The commandant signaled for a midshipman to escort Candidates Darrin and Dalzell for their examination. The thorough inspection covered everything from their hearts to the soles of their feet, leaving Dan nervous. After passing all tests, they joined others in taking the oath to serve in the United States Navy for eight years.

The busy hour that followed the arrival of the new midshipmen at the Naval Academy was filled with important tasks. Each young man had to deposit $264.98 with the pay officer, as required by law. Sixty dollars of this amount went towards purchasing necessary books, while the rest covered uniforms and equipment. Even though it may seem like a poor boy would have no chance to join the Academy due to the financial requirements, often times, the boy's Congressman, friends, or townsmen would lend him the money. Additionally, new midshipmen had to hand over any extra money they had, which would be credited back to them. Once in service, midshipmen received a yearly salary of $600, most of which went towards living expenses. Despite the formalities and initial awkwardness, the new midshipmen were soon led into the mess hall, where they felt the weight of being watched by their upperclassmen.|['1.

"The midshipmen at the Naval Academy are grouped into companies within divisions, each occupying a ""deck"" in Bancroft Hall.

"Dan's initial reaction was to smile, but then he felt compelled to obey the last speaker's serious demeanor. ""Very well, sir,"" Dalzell responded, rushing to fetch his basin.

""If needed,"" nodded Dave, ""we are here to learn to be Naval officers and hold command. A man who can't take orders isn't fit to give them."" 

""Good morning, gentlemen,"" greeted the Lieutenant as the midshipmen rose to attention. After supper, they had a brief recreation time before studying for two hours. 

Youngster Quimby lectured on being either touge or ratey, but Dan couldn't help but burst into laughter at Quimby's attempt at sternness.

Dan, grinning mischievously, knew his grin would enrage Quimby. Quimby, determined, landed blows on Dan, who blocked most but was staggered by one.

Plebe Farley and Henkel had a disagreement about a situation involving Darrin. Henkel felt strongly about seeking revenge against Darrin for a past incident. He believed that Darrin had unfairly gained favor after a fight, and he wanted to find a way to make things right. Farley, on the other hand, seemed more willing to let the issue go. Henkel proposed a plan to get back at Darrin and restore justice. He suggested coming up with a strategy to make Darrin face consequences for his actions.

Midshipman Henkel, who had been quick to think, realized that no one had caught him misbehaving in the room. The offense of entering another midshipman's room improperly would only result in ten demerits. He planned to deny the graver charges and face just ten demerits. Lieutenant Nettleson instructed Mr. Darrin and his roommate to return to their room, where they would find evidence of disorder. They were not to fix anything and return to him after leaving their books. Commander Jephson, known for his slow speech, was actually quite strict. He recounted Mr. Darrin's past delinquencies, where he denied responsibility for the disorder in his belongings. Mr. Darrin had claimed someone was framing him, but with no evidence, demerits piled up against him. Midshipmen Farley and Page suspected someone was targeting Mr. Darrin and requested to stay in their room during math class to catch the offender.

Brimmer, seething with anger, left quickly to avoid a fight with Darrin, who knew he couldn't defend himself due to an injured eye.

At the first chance to go to town, Dave, Dan, and Farley hurried to Tony, the Greek, pressing him for answers. Tony, however, remained silent, denying any involvement. Tony's silence was fueled by his demand for two hundred dollars from Brimmer, who sought help from his father. Despite their efforts, Dave, Dan, Farley, and Page couldn't find evidence. They visited all the drugstores in Annapolis but found no leads. Brimmer's anxiety grew as his comrades worked to expose him. At Annapolis, academics took precedence over athletics. Dave and Dan declined baseball try-outs, focusing on gym work, fencing, and drills. During a sailing drill, the wind weakened, challenging the crew captains.
