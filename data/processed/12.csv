Alice was talking to her kitten, Kitty, about saving up punishments for Wednesday week. She imagined what would happen if her punishments were saved up. She thought about going without dinner for each punishment, which would mean missing many meals at once. Alice then wondered if snow loved the trees and fields as it gently kissed them. She imagined the snow covering them like a white quilt, telling them to sleep until summer. Alice found the idea pretty and wished it was true. She then asked Kitty if it could play chess seriously, pretending it was the Red Queen. Alice shared her thoughts about the Looking-glass House and how things were different there, like the room seen through the glass and the books with words going the wrong way.|['1.

Alice thought about the possibility of entering this magical place through a soft, mist-like glass. She found herself in the Looking-glass room, where everything was different and fascinating. The pictures on the wall seemed alive, and even the clock had a face of a little old man. Alice noticed the chess pieces moving on their own, with the Red King and Queen, and the White King and Queen all in action. The White Queen's concern for her precious Lily added a touch of drama to the scene. Alice helped calm the situation, placing the Queen and Lily together.

Alice observed the White King's slow struggle from bar to bar. Realizing it would take him hours to reach the table, she offered to help. Ignoring her, the King couldn't see or hear her. Gently, Alice lifted him, making sure not to startle him. She dusted him off, causing the King to make comical faces in astonishment. He fell back on the table, leaving Alice concerned. She searched for water but found ink instead. As the King recovered, he and the Queen whispered in fear. The King then began writing in a large book. Alice, curious, took the pencil and wrote for him. The King struggled with the pencil, leading to amusing results. The Queen, reading Alice's writing, found it amusing. While watching the King, Alice read a book in a foreign language, finding it pretty but hard to understand. She decided to explore the garden through a twisty path, eager to see more.|"['1.

Alice was determined to avoid going back through the Looking-glass and into the old room, ending her adventures. So, she turned away from the house and headed towards the hill. Suddenly, the path twisted and she found herself back at the door. Undeterred, she started again and stumbled upon a flower-bed with talking flowers. The Tiger-lily scolded the others for being rude to Alice. The Red Queen, now taller, appeared, and Alice tried to approach her but ended up back at the front door. Frustrated, she decided to walk in the opposite direction but found herself in a peculiar country with tiny brooks and hedges. The Queen claimed all ways belonged to her and asked why Alice was there. After observing the strange land, Alice pondered her response.|['1.

Alice, in a state of excitement, observed the vast landscape before her as a giant chessboard. Enthralled by the idea of being part of the chess game, she expressed a desire to be a Queen. The Queen assured her that she could start as a Pawn and progress to become a Queen by reaching the Eighth Square. As they began to run hand in hand, Alice struggled to keep up with the fast-paced Queen. Despite their speed, the surroundings remained unchanged, leaving Alice puzzled. The Queen urged her to run faster, leaving Alice breathless and struggling to keep up. Eventually, they halted, and Alice found herself breathless on the ground. The Queen explained the peculiar nature of their surroundings, where running was necessary just to stay in the same place.|"['1.

The Queen measured the ground with a ribbon marked in inches while Alice watched. She mentioned the rules of the game. At the two-yard peg, she explained how Alice would quickly move through the squares. Alice was expected to reply politely. The Queen talked about each square and the fun they would have in the eighth square. Alice was reminded to speak French when she couldn't recall English words. The Queen vanished before Alice's eyes. Alice observed the surroundings, comparing them to geography lessons. She saw creatures making honey that turned out to be elephants. Alice decided against going down the hill without a branch to brush the creatures away. As she pondered, the Guard interrupted, asking for tickets. Everyone presented their tickets, including Alice, who was scolded for delaying.|"['1.

Alice was in a strange carriage surrounded by peculiar passengers. The Guard told her she was going the wrong way and shut the window. A Beetle suggested she be sent back as luggage. Other voices proposed different ways for her to continue her journey. The Horse reassured everyone about jumping over a brook. Suddenly, the carriage rose into the air, and Alice found herself under a tree with a Gnat fanning her. They discussed curious creatures like the Bread-and-Butterfly and the Butterfly with its head on fire. The Gnat talked about losing names and disappearing.

As she strolled through the woods, Alice found solace in the cool shade. She pondered the name of the tree she stood under, unable to recall it. Lost in thought, she realized she couldn't remember her own name either. Suddenly, a gentle Fawn approached, sparking a moment of connection. They ventured together until the Fawn, realizing Alice was human, darted away. Feeling a mix of emotions, Alice found comfort in remembering her name. She encountered two finger-posts, both pointing in the same direction towards Tweedledum and Tweedledee's house. Surprised by the revelation that they might live together, she decided to seek their help to find her way out of the woods. As she continued her journey, she stumbled upon the chubby Tweedle brothers, each distinguished by their collars.|"['1.

"Tweedledum exclaimed, ""You've been wrong! The first thing in a visit is to say 'How d'ye do?' and shake hands!"" The brothers then hugged each other and extended their hands to greet Alice. Not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings, Alice grabbed both their hands at once, leading to a spontaneous dance in a circle. The music, seemingly from the tree they danced under, added to the whimsical atmosphere. After the dance, the fat dancers, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, caught their breath and ended the dance. Alice felt unsure how to start a conversation after dancing with them. Suddenly, four young oysters approached, ready for a treat, despite not having feet. More oysters followed, hopping through the waves eagerly. The Walrus and the Carpenter discussed the trick they played on the oysters. Alice then noticed a strange noise, wondering if it was a wild beast nearby. Tweedledum and Tweedledee acted comically, with Tweedledee struggling to fold himself in an umbrella.

Alice was amazed at the commotion caused by the two characters, Tweedledee and the White Queen, as they fussed over dressing up. She found it amusing how they piled on clothes and gave her a hard time with buttons and strings. She thought they would end up looking like bundles of old clothes. Later, while seeking refuge under a tree, Alice encountered the White Queen struggling with a shawl being blown away. Trying to be helpful, Alice fixed the Queen's disheveled appearance, realizing she needed a lady's maid. The White Queen, in a distracted manner, mentioned the King's Messenger being in prison and a trial starting the following Wednesday.

"The pin on the Queen's shawl came undone in the wind, causing it to fly across a brook. Determined, the Queen chased after it, finally catching it herself. She proudly exclaimed, ""I've got it!"" But then, something strange happened. The Queen's voice turned into a sheep-like bleat, and she appeared to be wrapped in wool. Alice, bewildered, found herself in a dark shop facing an old Sheep knitting. The shop was filled with curious items, but whenever Alice tried to focus on one shelf, it appeared empty. The Sheep, working with multiple pairs of needles, puzzled Alice. Suddenly, the needles transformed into oars, and they found themselves in a boat drifting along a river. Despite the odd occurrences, Alice remained determined, reaching for the scented rushes along the riverbank, hoping the boat wouldn't tip over."|"['1.

"""The most beautiful things are always far away,"" she said with a sigh as she returned to her spot, arranging her newfound treasures. She didn't mind that the rushes she picked were already losing their scent and beauty. Alice was too captivated by the dreamlike rushes melting away like snow at her feet. As they continued, one of the oars got stuck, causing Alice to fall among the rushes. The Sheep, unfazed, continued knitting. Alice mentioned a crab she wanted to see, but the Sheep laughed. Later, the Sheep took the money and put it away, telling Alice to get it herself. Alice wandered through the shop, noticing oddities like trees and a brook.

"Humpty Dumpty was confident that all his horses and men could easily put him back together. Alice found the conversation moving too quickly and suggested going back to the previous topic.

Alice stood still, waiting for a response from the man lying on the ground. As he remained silent, she bid farewell and walked away quietly. While muttering to herself about the unsatisfactory encounter, a loud crash startled her. Soldiers flooded the forest, stumbling and falling over each other. Horses followed, also struggling to stay balanced. Alice found refuge behind a tree to avoid being trampled. She then encountered the White King writing in his book, counting the exact number of soldiers. The King mentioned missing messengers and horses needed for a game. Alice, distracted by a peculiar messenger approaching, began a nonsensical rhyme. The King tried to divert the messenger's attention, but the messenger's erratic behavior continued. The messenger shouted news to the King, prompting them to run off, leaving Alice to ponder the chaotic scene.|"['**1.

Alice and her companions, Haigha and Hatta, were on a silent trot until they stumbled upon a large crowd. In the midst of the commotion, the Lion and Unicorn were engaged in a fierce battle, stirring up a cloud of dust. Initially, Alice couldn't distinguish between the two, but she soon identified the Unicorn by its horn. Haigha informed Alice that the Unicorn had just been released from prison and was famished as he hadn't finished his tea before being sent in.

Alice sat by the brook with the dish on her lap, trying to cut the cake. Frustrated that the slices kept joining back together, she obeyed the Lion's instructions to carry the dish around, which magically divided the cake. As she did, a loud noise filled the air, causing her to panic and cover her ears. The Lion and the Unicorn, interrupted in their feast, rose with angry looks. The noise gradually faded, leaving Alice feeling alarmed. She noticed the dish still there, confirming it wasn't a dream. Suddenly, a Knight in crimson armor galloped towards her, declaring her his prisoner. Another White Knight appeared, and they engaged in a peculiar battle where they fell off their horses.

"The Knight gazed proudly at his helmet, swinging from the saddle. ""Yes,"" he remarked, ""but I've created a superior one—resembling a sugar loaf. When I wore it, if I tumbled off my horse, it barely touched the ground. So, my fall was minimal, you see—Yet, there was the risk of falling _into_ it. Once, that happened, and to my dismay, the other White Knight donned it, mistaking it for his own."" The Knight sighed, ""It was quite a predicament, I assure you!"" With great enthusiasm, he gestured, then suddenly tumbled off his horse into a deep ditch. Alice rushed to the edge, concerned. Despite only seeing his feet, she was relieved to hear his voice, ""All kinds of fastness,"" he continued. ""It was careless of him to wear another's helmet—with the person still in it."" The Knight seemed puzzled by the query. ""What does it matter where my body is?"" he mused. ""My mind continues working regardless. In fact, being upside down spurs my creativity."" ""Not the _next_ day,"" the Knight reiterated, lowering his voice, ""I doubt that pudding was ever cooked! Mixing it with gunpowder and sealing-wax makes all the difference.""
