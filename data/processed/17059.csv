"Captain Jack Benson, along with his friends Hal Hastings and Eph Somers, had been involved in many adventures. From building the first Pollard submarine to outwitting shrewd businessmen, their journey was nothing short of thrilling. In their latest endeavor, ""The Submarine Boys' Lightning Cruise,"" the boys underwent intense training in handling torpedoes for warfare. The government recognized their skills, awarding the Pollard company a substantial order for eighteen submarines.

Jabez Holt watched as the Professor's name was added to the register, the only new entry in a week. The old landlord pretended to be busy but was secretly observing. The German's invitation seemed somewhat authoritative, but Jack smiled and followed. Up the stairs, they went. The Professor unlocked a door to a suite of two rooms, locking it behind them. Jack, with a smile, mentioned the Professor's previous barber profession. The German explained his status in Germany, expecting respect. Jack humorously compared barbers in America, causing a brief tension. The German, composing himself, discussed Jack joining the German Navy, explaining the aristocratic nature of their officers. Jack acknowledged the difference but questioned the plan.|"[""1.

"""No, my young friend, not officers,"" the German explained. ""But you will have honorable positions and good pay for joining us. We know your expertise in submarines and will reward you generously."" Young Benson raised a concern, questioning the German's authority. Jack, serious as a judge, asked for proof of representing the German government. The German reassured them, planning to take them to Washington the next day. He emphasized the need for Jack's friends to understand the task. Herr Radberg then offered money to entice Jack, who calmly compared it with his own. Jack hesitated, contemplating leaving his country, sharing secrets, training with the German navy, and fighting for them in a war. Herr Radberg, devoted to Germany, struggled to comprehend others' patriotism for their own nations."|"['1.

"""Not very,"" Jack replied. ""Perhaps not old enough to know better. Anyway, if I were going to a foreign government, Germany would be about the last country. Germany is our rival in building a large navy. About every other month the experts in Germany sit down to figure whether they are anything ahead of us in the tonnage of warships, and, if so, whether there is any danger of our catching up with them. Now, unless the Germans have a notion that they may need, to fight us one of these days--""""Let's go along, fellows. Drowning and confusion to all possible foes afloat,"" proposed Hal, the one who could never see ""war"" on the horizon. ""After a winter on hot sodas, it'll be a relief to know that the druggist put in ice cream soda to-day.""So the three boys turned and made their way to the drugstore.

"""I will depart now, gentlemen,"" said the Frenchman in a disappointed tone. ""But I won't leave until tomorrow. If you change your mind or wish to hear my offer..."" The Chevalier d'Ouray shook hands graciously. Eph, feeling regretful for his earlier behavior, playfully slapped the Chevalier, causing him to cough. ""I disagree, mate,"" Jack argued. ""Foreign governments use spies to watch each other. If we hear from one, we'll likely hear from all. Look around, Eph. Do you see any Japanese?"" ""Japan is due,"" Benson chuckled. ""Let's head into the shipyard. If more agents show up, we'll sail out in one of the boats."" Grant Andrews, the foreman, approached, saying, ""Mr. Farnum wants to see you. He has serious business."" Mr. Farnum explained, ""There's an important task at Craven's Bay. The Army engineers are testing submarine mines. You'll see if a submarine can destroy the mines or vice versa.

"Eph quickly grabbed the box with the signal flags for the marine signaling code. He chose the flags for ""N"" and ""D"" and hoisted them up the mast. The launch was nearing, so he was just in time. Soon after dawn, Eph left the deck, returning only briefly. The smell of coffee and steak filled the air. He then blew the bugle, signaling reveille in the submarine. Captain Jack realized it was time for Navy discipline to have breakfast sooner. Major Woodruff explained the day's tests, involving planting dummy mines. Eph was to observe and mark the mine locations on a chart. He would then dive, avoid the mines, and attempt to disable them. The major addressed Jack as ""mister"" due to military protocol. The objective was for Eph to simulate an enemy submarine commander's actions."|"['1.

"Major Woodruff explained with a smile, ""We will immediately know if a collision occurs. A bell will ring in the camera obscura room at the fort, indicating which mine was touched. The camera obscura is a fascinating device used at modern forts. In a darkened room, a white table with a map of the harbor is displayed. Each mine's position is marked on the map against the white background. A revolving shutter projects reflections onto the map, allowing officers to track vessels. For instance, if an enemy battleship approaches a mine, an officer can trigger an explosion by pressing an electric button. This ensures the protection of the coast. At Fort Craven, they tested if an enemy submarine could disable the mines, but the system proved effective in safeguarding the harbor."""|['1.

A submarine torpedo boat sneaks into a harbor underwater, undetected by the camera obscura on the table. Eph is tasked with locating and cutting the wires of dummy mines to test the Army's detection methods. Major Woodruff instructs Eph to stay deep underwater to avoid detection, even warning against using a periscope. The periscope reflects scenes on a table in the boat's cabin. The major hopes Eph can outsmart the submarine torpedo boat. As a tug stops, Captain Jack Benson is left on shore. He wakes abruptly, unsure of how long he slept. Observing a stranger making calculations on the sand, Jack suspects the man is up to no good. The Army plants another mine as the stranger marks locations on a drawing board, leaving Jack suspicious of his intentions.|"[""1.

"The warning came, ""Then I'm going to fire!"" Glancing back, the submarine boy saw the pursuer with a raised revolver. Crack! Whizz-zz! Chug! The bullet missed, hitting the sand. The close call fueled the boy's anger. ""He's getting winded,"" thought the boy, confident in his stamina. Mockingly, he realized he had outsmarted the pursuer and secured the valuable plunder. As he slowed to a walk, he pondered how to return to the Army. Suddenly, he remembered the pursuer's name, Millard, from a past encounter at Dunhaven. Millard had sought work on submarines but left after being assigned menial tasks. The boy now knew his pursuer's identity and motivations."|"['1.

Dave Pollard, during his time in Washington, encountered Millard at the luxurious Arlington Hotel. Millard, using a different name, denied knowing Mr. Pollard, claiming a mistake. However, the truth was that Millard was involved in stealing submarine secrets in Dunhaven and was now attempting to map out harbor defenses in Craven Bay. Jack Benson, jogging along, spotted a small motor launch in a semicove. The skipper, a fisherman type, quickly understood the situation as Millard raced towards them with a pistol. The launch moved away from shore to avoid any danger. Jack then hinted to Major that he had valuable information to share. The Major acknowledged the seriousness of catching the thief and enlisted Jack's help, praising his dedication to the country. The Major expressed concern about the younger generation's commitment to the nation's values and hoped that boys like Jack would uphold the country's legacy.

Captain Jack found himself in a precarious situation. As he contemplated hailing a policeman, a streetcar sped by, whisking the officer away. Jack realized that confronting his adversary, Millard, could lead to false accusations. Reflecting on the potential danger, Jack decided to act cautiously. Despite his determination to catch Millard, Jack suspected a trap as he cautiously navigated down an alleyway. Suddenly, Millard ambushed Jack, swiftly ensnaring him with a noose.

Jack felt a poke in his stomach, slowly regaining his senses. Lying down, he opened his eyes, feeling his throat sore but able to breathe. Realizing his hands and feet were tied, he saw Millard nearby. They were in a basement with no furniture and shut windows. Millard searched Jack's pockets, finding an envelope. He took out a paper from it and expressed regret for his actions. Jack noticed his wrists were also tied to the floor. Millard brought in shavings, poured coal-oil, and placed a candle on top.
