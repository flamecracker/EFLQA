One of the men mentioned James Southwold, a former verderer of the forest who had now turned against his king. The leader asked James if he knew secret hiding spots in the forest, hoping to find a man named Charles. James agreed to help. The leader planned to use fire to flush out hidden enemies. The troop, led by Southwold, rode off to search the dell. Jacob, a forester, watched them go, shocked by Southwold's betrayal.

"Jacob hurried along, worried that the king might be seeking refuge in the forest or at Arnwood. He pondered over the term ""Leveler"" mentioned by a stranger. The Levelers were a faction of the Parliamentary army who believed in equality and the redistribution of wealth. They despised those of higher rank and property, particularly supporters of the king. Jacob, unaware of these details, only knew that Arnwood was in danger that night. He quickly made his way to inform Miss Judith. At Arnwood, only a few servants remained, struggling to maintain the household due to unpaid rents and uncertain futures. Miss Judith, preoccupied with waiting for a summons from her relatives, had little time for the orphans in her care. The children, left mostly to themselves, grew unruly under the limited supervision of the household staff, consisting of a cook, a housemaid, and a caretaker. The neglect they faced, however, unintentionally prepared them for the challenges ahead."|['1.

Jacob rushed up to Miss Judith Villiers's apartment where he found the old lady seated, looking prim and stern. He quickly shared the alarming news he had overheard about the mansion being targeted for burning that very night by troopers.

Jacob took the children into the bedroom and dressed them in clothes that would disguise their true identity. Edward stood by the bedside with a mug of water while Jacob removed the dinner platters.

"""Yes, my young friend, that deer is deceased; however, there might be another hidden in the brush nearby or further away that your shout has startled. Imagine if we both had guns, my shot could have roused another deer within range for you to shoot; or if a deer was farther off, the sound might have prompted it to move, allowing us to track it. Notice the antlers on this deer - it has nine, while a younger deer has fewer. Let's prepare the venison now,"" said Jacob.

After attending to the deer, Jacob suggested, ""We are about four or five miles from home. Could you find your way back? No worries, Smoker will guide you. I'll stay here; you can fetch White Billy to carry the venison. It's too much for us alone. Let's pack it up and head back."" Edward agreed, and they proceeded to transport the venison. On their return, Jacob shared insights on deer-stalking with Edward. They reached home, hung the venison, stabled the pony, and enjoyed a meal prepared by Alice and Humphrey.

Jacob went to Lymington as planned and returned late, bringing tools and a gun for Edward. He handed Edward the gun, once owned by a skilled ranger who perished in battle alongside Edward's father. The gun was sold by the ranger's widow to make ends meet. Jacob wanted Edward to have the gun, not for its value but for Edward's protection. They decided to practice shooting the next day.

One thing was clear to Edward: he couldn't fix his problems now. This realization kept him in check. Time passed quickly, and they stayed in the cottage, except for a couple of trips for venison. The frost melted, trees budded, and the sun grew strong. Jacob suggested going for venison to sell in Lymington. They found a deer track, but Jacob deemed it unworthy. They then spotted a stag worth hunting. Jacob went to drive it out, while Edward waited. A stag emerged, Edward shot it, and it fell. They saw another stag but couldn't reach it. Jacob went around and shot the stag, which ran towards Edward. Edward shot it again, and the dog chased after it.

Alice, Edith, and Edward hurried back to the cottage upon hearing Humphrey's plan. Humphrey strategically positioned the cart to distract the heifer, allowing Edward to open the gate swiftly. With the heifer occupied, they successfully guided her into the cow-house. Humphrey devised a clever scheme to secure the heifer by using a rope and slip-knot. After coaxing the heifer into the cow-house, they managed to fasten her horns to ensure safety. Despite initial doubts, Humphrey's resourcefulness impressed Jacob and Edward. They celebrated their successful venture and prepared to handle the bull after dinner. The following day, Jacob sold the bull and returned with supplies for the new cow.

Humphrey worked diligently to tame the heifer and her calf at the cottage. He spent time coaxing the heifer with food and gentle touches until she became calm. After a fortnight, he entrusted the heifer only to Alice, ensuring a bond between them. Humphrey successfully milked the heifer after gentle persistence. The heifer eventually grazed in the forest but returned every evening to her calf. The calf was weaned in winter, and Alice learned to milk the heifer, who became docile. Edward stayed to assist with collecting acorns for the pigs while Jacob procured puppies. Jacob narrowly escaped a stag in the forest but secured two puppies for Humphrey.

Alice prepared a feast with baked venison, venison stew, roast chickens, and an apple pie. Jacob praised their hard work and contentment, reflecting on their transformation since leaving Arnwood.

During the winter, not much happened for Edward and Humphrey. Jacob had rheumatism, so Edward hunted with Humphrey. Humphrey caught a bull and a cow calf in a pitfall, and they tamed them. Jacob couldn't go to Lymington due to his illness, so they couldn't sell venison. They smoked venison hams instead. Jacob couldn't get the puppies they were promised, so Edward was to go. Jacob gave him instructions, and he left the next morning on White Billy. Edward felt like a slave in the forest and wanted to join the royal party. He thought they wouldn't harm them since their father fought for the king. Edward believed they were safe if they stayed quiet. Jacob warned against leaving as their property was seized by Parliament. Edward pondered his next move if he left the forest.|"['1.

Whispering softly, Edward signaled for Oswald to lead him into the thicket while he sneaked to the opposite side. Edward cautiously crept through the dense foliage and spotted a small opening covered in tall ferns, where he suspected the stag was hiding.

Oswald is unaware of the situation. I am over seventy-six, Edward, and you know, Edward, the Bible mentions that a man's life is about seventy years; so, I have surpassed that age. Edward, I have a few words to share. Be cautious - not just for yourself but for your little sisters too. You are young but strong and mature beyond your years, capable of protecting them better than I can. Darker days may lie ahead, but it is God's will. I urge you not to reveal your noble birth yet; it may not help and could harm. There is money in my chest to sustain you for a while. Ensure you read the Bible and pray daily, as I have. Humphrey, remember, life is uncertain. Your sisters rely on you; don't take unnecessary risks with the wild cattle. Stay on the farm; it will provide for all of you. Alice and Edith, be good and look to your brothers for guidance. Farewell, my dear ones. Bless you all, and may God watch over you. These were the final words of the old forester. The children wept as they prayed by his bedside, fulfilling his last wish. When they rose, they discovered he had passed away. They mourned deeply, cherishing the memory of the kind-hearted man.

The requests shifted the focus and stirred sympathy in the young girls, leading them to the sitting room. Humphrey assigned his sisters to scrape potatoes while he tended to Edward's burn. The scraped potatoes provided relief for Edward. The girls, holding back sobs, continued to help prepare supper for Edward. After supper, they retired early. Edward read from the Bible, moving everyone to tears. Humphrey applied a fresh dressing to Edward's arm, then worked diligently through the night. In the morning, Humphrey woke Edward, and they prepared to move Jacob's body. They read Psalms at the grave, emphasizing the need to support each other as orphans.

Edward and the children said a prayer together before starting their day's work. Edward's arm had healed, allowing him to help on the farm with Humphrey. The return of fine weather and their busy days brought peace to their hearts. They planted flowers on old Jacob's grave, turning it into a place of love and remembrance. They even held their church service there, feeling the power of prayer. Edward found a bag of gold coins in Jacob's chest, left behind for him. Despite waiting for Oswald Partridge, he did not show up. Edward decided to ride to Lymington for supplies and to learn more about his finances. Oswald explained that the intendant opposed a deed and left urgently, leaving Oswald to care for the intendant's daughter.

Two bulls were fighting fiercely, trapping Smoker, who was injured and unable to escape. Edward and Humphrey climbed a tree to safety. As the bulls locked horns, the boys fired their guns, bringing down both animals. After waiting to ensure the bulls were down for good, the boys descended. Smoker, though hurt, was recovering. Edward tended to Smoker's injuries while Humphrey fetched water. The boys then skinned the bulls and loaded the meat onto a cart. They made multiple trips to Lymington to sell the meat.

Humphrey and Edward were discussing their plans for work and building projects. Humphrey was eager to start by digging a sawpit to cut boards for building. Edward, needing to go to bed, laughed at Humphrey's many ideas. The next morning, they were up early, and Alice made sure Edward had breakfast before he left. As they prayed, Pablo came out to listen. Humphrey then asked Pablo if he understood their plans. Edward decided to walk instead of taking the pony, enjoying the fine weather and planning to hunt for venison. His thoughts turned to his father's death and the family estate. Suddenly, Holdfast barked, and Edward found himself facing a foreboding man. Edward calmly prepared his gun, and the man backed off, realizing Edward was not a threat.|"['1.

Edward stood his ground, calmly asserting his innocence to the verderer who accused him of poaching.

He made it clear that he was on his way to the intendant's cottage and not in pursuit of deer. Edward warned the verderer against any rash actions that could jeopardize his own safety or position. The verderer, taken aback by Edward's composed demeanor and the lack of evidence against him, hesitated. Sensing the shift in the verderer's attitude, Edward proposed a compromise, insisting that they walk together with their guns half-cocked.

Edward Armitage, a young man, found himself caught in the middle of political turmoil during King Charles's reign. He joined a party opposing the king's attempts to become absolute and strip away England's liberties. Despite his belief in defending liberties, he also respected the sanctity of the king's person. Concerns arose as Cromwell gained power, potentially mirroring the absolute authority that led to the king's demise.

Edward helped Humphrey and Pablo load the iron chest onto the cart, stacking it with other items. Leaving Pablo in charge, Edward and Humphrey joined a friendly gathering in the cottage. Patience Heatherstone had made friends with the girls and the intendant was surprisingly jovial. They shared a meal of milk, biscuits, fruit, bread, beef, and ham. The intendant, reflecting on past animosities, apologized and bid them farewell. As they departed, Edward shared the intendant's offer with Humphrey, who advised him to accept it. Despite his love for the forest, Humphrey convinced Edward that the opportunity to work as a secretary and gain valuable experiences in the world was too good to pass up. The chance to make a friend and protector, and eventually secure a better life for his sisters, outweighed Edward's initial reservations.|"['1.

Humphrey and Edward, two young foresters, discussed the political turmoil of Cromwell and King Charles. Edward's thoughts were often interrupted by visions of Patience Heatherstone, whom he admired. Despite initial aversion, Edward grew to respect Patience's father. They debated the actions against the king, agreeing on the need for change but condemning the violence. Edward pondered the historical repercussions of the king's murder, contemplating the nation's tarnished history. Meanwhile, Edith and Humphrey worked on instilling Christian principles in Pablo, who was gradually understanding their teachings. Edward awaited a message from the intendant, which arrived through Oswald Partridge, inviting him for a meeting the next day.

Edward was grateful for the offer and expressed his willingness to accept the position on a trial basis. He believed that the role would provide him with valuable insights and keep him informed about important matters, unlike his secluded life in the forest. The intendant assured Edward that the job wouldn't be too demanding and that he would take care of ensuring it wasn't overwhelming. They discussed Edward's future responsibilities, including dictating letters and occasional trips to London. The intendant offered Edward a place in his home and mentioned that they would discuss his remuneration later.

Upon arriving in Lymington, Edward and Humphrey quickly sought out the inn where the landlord directed Edward to a tailor for a new outfit. Edward was measured for a dark suit while Humphrey suggested he also wear a steeple-crowned hat to match the intendant's style. As Edward gathered his new attire, Humphrey arranged to purchase goats for the household, securing a deal for several goats and kids. The next day, Humphrey and Pablo met the farmer to acquire the goats and safely drove them home.

Pablo explained to Master Humphrey that he used to steal because he was hungry and needed to survive. But now, he no longer goes hungry, has warm shelter, and no one mistreats him. With the guidance of Missy Alice and Edith, who taught him that stealing is wrong, Pablo decided to never steal again. He admired the girls for their wise words and cheerful demeanor. The conversation shifted to the dogs, Smoker and Watch, and the responsibility of looking after them. The next day, Pablo and the clever dog, Holdfast, led the goats into the forest to graze. Holdfast proved to be reliable, ensuring the goats returned home safely each evening. On the weekend, Humphrey and Pablo went to Lymington, discussing important matters in case Pablo needed to go there alone. Despite Edward's departure being imminent, the family spent Sunday together, finding comfort in each other's company. Edward, dressed in new clothes, prepared to leave for the forest, leaving behind a sense of nostalgia for the days at Arnwood.

Edward, while driving through the forest, pondered about the unexpected situation he found himself in. He was seeking shelter with a Roundhead, a person with opposing views to his own.

The intendant gave Edward three letters indicating that the time wasn't right for a plan to restore the king. The letters mentioned that the Scotch army was against the king, and it was best if they were defeated by Cromwell. Edward was told that English supporters couldn't join the Scots. The intendant shared this information with Edward, showing trust. Edward was content with the talk and the intendant's honesty. As predicted, Cromwell defeated the Scots, and the king retreated. Edward decided to trust the intendant's guidance. Edward spent time with Mr. Heatherstone, hunting with Oswald and providing venison for his family. Patience visited the cottage often, and Mr. Heatherstone occasionally joined them. Edward later went to the cottage alone during winter, sending venison back for his family. Patience sent books and supplies for Alice and Edith, while Humphrey taught them. Edward suggested Humphrey check if the robber's claim about hidden treasure was true. Humphrey set out on this mission, avoiding temptation for Pablo. Humphrey discovered men at Clara's cottage, including Corbould, who was supposed to be in London.

Humphrey was concerned as he moved forward, occasionally glancing back to check if the men had spotted him. He suspected Corbould's involvement with robbers seeking vengeance. Humphrey decided to inform the intendant promptly. After reaching a secluded spot near the oak tree mentioned by the robber, he began digging. Unearthed a box, Humphrey was interrupted by three approaching armed men. Sensing danger, he swiftly loaded the box into the cart and drove off. The men chased and fired shots, but Humphrey managed to escape. Upon reaching home, he shared the incident with Alice, preparing for a potential attack.

Humphrey carried a box into his sisters' room and then called Pablo to help fortify their cottage against potential attackers. They fetched timber pieces to secure the doors and windows.

Humphrey wrote a letter to the intendant seeking help and sent Pablo to deliver it. They prepared for a possible attack, but when evening came, a group from the intendant arrived.

Patience and Clara joined Edward to visit Alice and Edith, escorted back by Humphrey. They had a merry time. Humphrey stayed at the intendant's house for two days, then returned to the cottage where Edward had covered for him. Winter brought heavy snowfalls, but Humphrey's hay supply kept the animals fed. The goats ate bark and hay, surviving well. Edward struggled to visit due to deep snow. Humphrey planned to capture forest ponies by luring them with hay.

Pablo carefully haltered the pony and tied its fore-leg short to keep its head low. He used a lasso to control it and released the ropes binding its legs. The pony, iron-gray and beautiful, struggled and fell due to the restraints. With dogs barking, they led it to the cottage. Exhausted and foamy, they secured it in the stable. Two more ponies were captured, a bay mare and a brown horse. The ponies were tamed with fasting and care. Alice and Edith were thrilled, and the ponies soon allowed petting. After a month, they were ready to ride. Deep snow limited communication, and news of King Charles's army raised spirits. Edward was to go to London discreetly. The intendant provided guidance for Edward's mission. Patience was tasked with preparing Edward's wardrobe, including his father's sword, which he hoped to honor.|"['1.

Patience rose early the next morning to give Edward a little parcel before his departure. She had forgotten it the night before. It was a book of meditations to keep him company during his journey. Edward accepted the gift gratefully and promised to read it when he had some time. The intendant had already given Edward letters and money for his expenses. He cautioned Edward on his behavior and appearance while in the city. Edward prepared himself, commended his journey to the Divine Protector, and left before dawn.

Edward was bid farewell by Patience with a forewarning of potential danger ahead. He mounted his horse, accompanied by Sampson, embarking on a journey to London. The trip was uneventful, with Sampson providing insights into the unfamiliar city. Upon arrival, they settled at the 'Swan with Three Necks' in Holborn. The next day, Edward delivered a confidential letter to Mr. Langton in Spring Gardens. Langton acknowledged Edward's mission to the north and entrusted him with letters for the journey. Advised to lay low due to the precarious times, Edward was cautioned against being conspicuous in London. Langton recommended a swift departure to Lancashire or Yorkshire, where Edward could plan discreetly with the assistance of Langton's contacts.

Edward left the house and handed out the other letters, with the most important being the credit letter. The rest were introductions to Parliament members. The credit letter was from a merchant in Hamburg who offered money, which Edward declined for now. He mentioned needing it for business up north. He returned to the hotel and informed Sampson of his departure on Mr. Heatherstone's business. Sampson provided letters to trustworthy contacts in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Edward was advised to leave London promptly and cautiously. He acquired a credit letter for York, packed, paid, and rode north, stopping at Barnet for the night. Edward, in his plain yet good attire, was mistaken for a Roundhead due to his sword. Upon entering an inn room, he encountered three unsavory individuals who eyed him suspiciously until the host intervened.|"['1.

The following morning, a messenger arrived with news from General Middleton that the king's army had camped near Portlake. Chaloner suggested a change in Edward's attire, providing him with suits from his younger days. Edward selected two colorful outfits, transforming into a handsome Cavalier.

Middleton informed Chaloner of raising a troop of horse and offered Edward a captaincy, attached to the king's staff. Edward was quickly equipped and attended the king.

Chaloner expressed gratitude for the compliment from Mistress Alice but mentioned his ability to adapt to different situations, even ruffling feathers if needed. They successfully disguised themselves as troopers during their journey. The Parliamentary forces searched the forest for several days but did not suspect Edward and his companions, thanks to his explanations. Edward wrote to the intendant seeking permission to stay longer at the cottage. The intendant instructed them to maintain vigilance and cooperate with troopers in the search for the king. Edward shared this information with officers to avoid suspicion. Humphrey fetched clothes for Chaloner and Grenville to disguise as forest verderers. They settled in Clara's cottage, hidden in the woods. Edward contemplated revealing his true identity to the intendant due to the kindness shown.

"""Yes, and for much more; for I think I shall have good advice, and will therefore accept your offer. I feel, Patience, that although I was justified, on my first acquaintance with your father, in not making known to him a secret of some importance, yet now that he has put such implicit confidence, in me, I am doing him and myself an injustice in not making the communication--that is, as far as confidence in him is concerned. I consider that he has a right to know all, and yet I feel that it would be prudent on my part that he should not know all, as the knowledge might implicate him with those with whom he is at present allied.

Patience assured Edward that she saw no reason for his anger, explaining that she only viewed him as a friend and benefactor. She mentioned being young and guided by her father, not wanting to disobey him. While thanking Edward for his good opinion, she expressed a wish that he hadn't said what he did. Edward then shared news from London, revealing that he had finally obtained the property of Arnwood due to Edward's actions as a trooper and in the forest. Although Edward was disappointed by this news, Mr. Heatherstone defended his decision, stating that the property had no living claimants and would otherwise remain with the government.

Edward's heart raced as he pondered his predicament. He had been thwarted by Mr. Heatherstone from confessing his feelings to Patience, fearing a rift with the intendant. Supper with Clara's probing questions added to his distress. Unable to face Patience, he retreated to bed with a pounding headache. Sleep eluded him as he mulled over the day's events. Would Patience ever return his affections? He doubted it, especially now that she would inherit. Determined to seek advice from Humphrey, Edward rose at dawn, saddled his horse, and rode to the cottage. Over breakfast, he confided in Humphrey, feeling lost and unsure of what to do next. Despite his sisters' concern, Edward knew he couldn't stay at the Heatherstone estate any longer. His only resolve was to seek his fortune elsewhere, with Humphrey by his side.|"[""1.

Edward and Humphrey had a serious discussion about their future plans. Edward revealed his intention to break up their current setup. He planned for his sisters to go to the Misses Conynghame and for himself to go abroad, resume his real name, and work in a foreign service. Edward also mentioned relying on the king's assistance for this. Humphrey, upon hearing this, decided to wait before making any decisions. Edward then rode back to the intendant's place and received news of the king's escape to France. The next morning, Edward visited Clara's cottage, where he shared the news with Chaloner and Grenville. They received a letter from the Misses Conynghame inviting the sisters to stay with them in London. Edward thanked Chaloner and planned to send his sisters off soon.

Edward was delirious and weak, calling himself Edward Beverley and talking about his family. Humphrey stayed by his side, holding him down as per the surgeon's advice. Eventually, Edward fell into a deep sleep. Patience prayed silently while Humphrey felt remorse for his earlier words.

Edward woke at dawn, drank eagerly, and recognized Humphrey. Later, Clara questioned Humphrey about the sudden departure of his sisters and expressed concern about the household chores.

Humphrey, feeling troubled by Clara's questions, decided to act angry to cut the conversation short.

Humphrey revealed that Patience was now an heiress of Arnwood, a large property soon to be hers. Concerned for their sisters' future, Humphrey and Edward arranged for them to be cared for by friends near Lymington. Despite Humphrey's harsh words, his actions were driven by a mix of family pride and fear for their well-being.
