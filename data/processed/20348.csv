The film company included Mr. Wellington Bunn, an aspiring actor, and Pearl Pennington, the leading lady. Mrs. Maguire played the motherly roles, while Carl Switzer provided comic relief. Pop Snooks, the property man, was indispensable for creating props. The girls' adventures took them from Deerfield to Florida, where they filmed exciting scenes under the palms.

Mr. Switzer, a jolly German, bantered with a newsboy before catching a train. He joked about time and ships, then headed off with a wink. The train ride to Oak Farm was dull, but the group of actors finally arrived. Sandy, recalling a past barn-burning scene, chuckled at the memory. The farm had new buildings for the actors, and the DeVere girls would stay at the farmhouse. The next day, preparations began. Pop Snooks set up scenes, including a fake well for a water scene.

In movie-making, close-up scenes focus on a small part of an object in the camera. For instance, a fake door made of plaster-of-Paris with a frame around it can stand in for a grand entrance to a marble house. In a war play, a soldier was to leap through a barn window to escape. Since the farm lacked suitable structures, Pop Snooks built a one-sided barn with hidden braces. The soldier would land on hay out of sight of the camera. Inside scenes with Ruth were to follow in a makeshift studio. During rehearsals, Mr. Switzer, playing the soldier, cautiously approached the barn, expressing surprise and hope. A mishap during filming meant retakes were necessary to avoid ruining the scene. It's crucial not to disrupt filming to prevent retakes and film spoilage.|['1.

The making of a movie involves careful planning and creativity. Contrary to what you might think, scenes are not filmed in the order they appear in the final movie. Instead, all scenes set in one location, like a parlor or a battlefield, are filmed together to save time and money. For example, if a movie has scenes in an office and on a ferryboat, both office scenes are filmed together, even if they don't happen consecutively in the story. Later, during editing, the scenes are rearranged to follow the storyline logically. This process allows filmmakers to efficiently capture different scenes and save resources. So, next time you watch a movie, remember that what you see on screen might not have been filmed in the same order as the story unfolds.|"['1.

Mr. Apgar posted a notice because too many cowboys and girls were invading his home, causing a lack of privacy. While they welcomed the regular members of Mr. Pertell's company, they did not want the extra men, soldiers, cowboys, and horsewomen running around. Alice scrubbed her fingers vigorously after a man named Whitlow made her uncomfortable. Paul, a friend, intervened and handled the situation, ensuring that they wouldn't be bothered again. Making a big movie takes weeks or months, especially outdoor scenes where sunlight is crucial. Cloudy days or rain can cause delays, but it's all part of the process. Despite setbacks, the actors' salaries continue, so they understand and adapt to the challenges of filming.|"[""1.

Ruth mentioned that Estelle sometimes seemed absent-minded, recalling a time when Estelle mentioned not having a ticket for a walk. Speculations arose about Estelle's mysterious past, with Ruth dismissing the idea that she ran away to be in movies.

Yes, somewhat. It might sound odd, but I can only remember events from the past three to four years. I am uncertain about the exact time frame. But when I try to recollect as far back as possible, all I can recall is being on a large ship. It was quite strange. When I realized I was in an unfamiliar place, I was so startled that I considered screaming or asking questions. However, I refrained from doing so to avoid being mistaken for someone with mental health concerns. Instead, I isolated myself in my cabin and contemplated the situation. I was curious about how I ended up on the ship but hesitated to inquire directly. Eventually, I feigned interest in changing rooms and learned from the purser that I had chosen my current room upon boarding. This revelation indicated that I had come aboard independently, although I had no memory of the event. Moreover, I discovered that I possessed a significant amount of money and expensive belongings without any recollection of acquiring them. Despite the confusion, I confirmed my identity as Estelle Brown, a name that felt intimately connected to me. Upon arriving in Cleveland, I hoped to regain my memory by recognizing familiar landmarks or my supposed home.|"[""1.

Ruth decided not to go, so the other two girls started their journey. On the porch, they encountered Russ and Paul, who confirmed their suspicion that Mr. Pertell had acquired a large siege gun to demonstrate the impact of explosive shells. The cannon, an old-fashioned siege rifle from the Civil War era, had been stored away after minimal use. Mr. Pertell intended to film a war scene at Oak Farm, where the hill would represent a fortress for the Southern troops. The Union soldiers would attack after the hill was bombarded with shells from the cannon. Real shells with explosive charges would be used, ensuring the safety of the actors playing the Southern soldiers. Russ mentioned that they would film the scene the next day if the weather permitted. Paul explained the precautions taken to protect their ears from the shockwaves caused by the cannon's firing. Sandy Apgar, observing the scene, humorously remarked that the cannon firing was like plowing the hill, suggesting that the filmmakers' activities might benefit the land for future farming.|['1.

The filming day for the scenes with the big gun had arrived. However, due to delays in setting up the earthworks, no pictures could be taken. Both sides' men were put to work practicing military tactics like digging trenches. On the hill, Confederates prepared to respond to the big gun's fire. As shots were fired, the Confederate cannons were visually disabled by small charges. During a scene where Paul led his men up the hill, a mistake occurred, and a projectile was accidentally launched towards them. Luckily, a half-charge in the projectile saved them from harm. Despite the scare, the temporary halt in the advance added to the realism of the scene. The unexpected shell firing surprised both the actors and the Confederates waiting behind the battery.|"['1.

"Ruth and Alice exchanged a glance, puzzled by the unfamiliar names being mentioned. Could they be close to uncovering the true identity of the girl who had initially denied her name? With bated breath, they, along with the nurse, leaned in with anticipation. A crucial moment was upon them. Would the girl, despite her affliction, provide a clue to her identity? Or would her words fade into incomprehensible babble? As the tension mounted, the girl gazed at them, attempting to speak but no words emerged. The suspense was palpable. Would she manage to respond? Could her injured brain sift through the jumble of words to give a coherent answer? Finally, she spoke, ""Yes, I am Mildred Passamore. My father is Jared Passamore from San Francisco. I don't know why I'm here, but please telegraph him at the Palace Hotel. Ask him to bring my doll, Estelle Brown. I know it may seem silly for someone my age to have a doll, but Estelle has always comforted me when I was unwell. I feel better now, so please tell my father to bring Estelle Brown with him. Also, assure him that I wasn't severely injured in the train accident.""

After all these years? Why, Mom, I left you just two days ago to head to Seattle. There must have been a crash; I heard a loud noise, and then I woke up here with these kind movie folks. They were also on the train, I think. It was a joyful time at Oak Farm, with the movie girls getting a lot of credit. If Alice hadn't spotted the paper about the missing girl and kept it, Mildred's true identity might not have been revealed for a while. They finally told her the truth; Mildred had actually been Estelle Brown for four years after the train accident near Portland, Oregon. The blow to her head made her forget who she was. She ended up in Boston, drawn there by memories from her childhood. It was only at Oak Farm that Mildred slowly started to remember who she truly was.|"['1.
