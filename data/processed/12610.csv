He accused Nan's father of theft, but Mrs. Sherwood explained the situation. Mr. Sherwood had been falsely accused by Bulson after a train robbery in Chicago.

The railway and the company running sleeping cars denied any responsibility for Mr. Bulson's missing items.

Inez was now out of business, and her savings were taken by her aunt.

The actress was preoccupied with the important matters of the scene and only later realized the true identities of the girls when their real names came back to her subconsciously.

They entered a large room, semi-circular in shape, with a mostly glass roof and one side. Countless screens diffused the light, all focused on small raised stages along the curved wall. Each stage had its own scenery and was set for scenes. Two stages showed a tussle between a cowboy and an elegantly dressed Eastern youth, ending in a comedy where the Easterner disarmed the cowboy. The camera clicked as the directors guided the actors. Nan and Bess, guided by a girl in a Gypsy costume, observed eagerly. The bald man in a brown suit approached them, questioning Nan.

Walter sat on the edge of the seat wearing automobile goggles, with Prince's ears back as another sleigh passed by. Bess overcame her timidity, enjoying the ride with Walter and Nan.

He called Linda's aunt and arranged for her to be picked up. The group then rushed home for lunch. Despite concerns about the rescue, the friends were focused on Linda's possible change of heart.

Nan felt a sudden rush of excitement as she saw a child crossing the busy street. Without hesitation, she dashed towards the edge of the sidewalk. As a large truck approached, the child narrowly escaped its path, only to face a speeding car. While others screamed in fear, Nan sprang into action to rescue the little girl. Despite the car skidding dangerously close, Nan managed to save her just in time. The rescued child, named Inez, initially resisted Nan's help but eventually recognized her with a smile.
