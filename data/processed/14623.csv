"""Oh, wait a minute! I forgot to put the broom in the corner,"" said Rose, his sister. ""I was helping mother sweep, and I forgot to put the broom away. Wait for me, Russ! Don't let the boat start without me!""

""I won't,"" promised the little boy, as he tossed back a lock of dark hair which had straggled down over his eyes. They were dark, too, and, just now, were shining in eagerness as he looked at a collection of items piled together in the playroom floor.

""The steamboat will wait for you, Rose,"" Russ Bunker went on. ""But hurry back,"" and he began to whistle a merry tune as he moved a footstool over to one side. ""That's one of the paddle-wheels,"" he told his smaller brother Laddie.

""Why doesn't it go 'round then?"" asked Violet, Laddie's twin sister. ""Why doesn't it go 'round, Russ? I thought wheels always went around!""

One day, the Bunker children were playing in the playroom when a mishap occurred. Russ had constructed a steamboat out of a flour barrel, but it collapsed while he was sitting on it. The chaos ensued as chairs toppled over, and the children found themselves in a heap on the floor. Mother Bunker, alarmed by the noise, rushed to the scene to check on her children. Laddie found his leg trapped in a soap-box, and the others were tangled in the mess. Rose, the oldest at seven, tried to explain the situation to her mother. The Bunker family consisted of six lively children who always managed to have a good time, even amidst minor disasters. Rose, with her light hair and eyes, was a helpful hand around the house, while Laddie, a twin of Vi, was known for his love of riddles.

The Bunker family lived in Pineville near the Rainbow River in Pennsylvania. Daddy Bunker, also known as Charles, ran a real estate office where he sold houses and building materials. The six little Bunkers had many relatives like Aunt Jo in Boston, Uncle Frederick in Montana, and Cousin Tom in New Jersey. They also had a grandfather and two grandmothers. One day, the children were playing with a barrel pretending it was a steamboat. Laddie, the youngest, made a joke about the barrel being hungry when it takes a roll. Russ, the oldest, was steering the barrel when Laddie's movements caused it to break apart.|"['Question 1: Where did the Bunker family live?\nA) Boston\nB) Montana\nC) New Jersey\nD) Pennsylvania\nE) California', ""Question 2: What was Daddy Bunker's profession?\nA) Doctor\nB) Teacher\nC) Real estate agent\nD) Chef\nE) Farmer"", 'Question 3: Who was playing with a barrel pretending it was a steamboat?\nA) Aunt Jo\nB) Uncle Frederick\nC) Russ\nD) Laddie\nE) Cousin Tom', 'Question 4: Who was steering the barrel when it broke apart?\nA) Aunt Jo\nB) Uncle Frederick\nC) Russ\nD) Laddie\nE) Cousin Tom', 'Question 5: Where did Aunt Jo live?\nA) Boston\nB) Montana\nC) New Jersey\nD) Pennsylvania\nE) California', 'Question 6: How did Laddie describe the barrel when it took a roll?\nA) Sad\nB) Hungry\nC) Tired\nD) Angry\nE) Excited']"|['D) Pennsylvania', 'C) Real estate agent', 'D) Laddie', 'C) Russ', 'A) Boston', 'B) Hungry']
"""I guess the barrel was so old and dry that it couldn't hold together when you two boys got to playing with it,"" Mrs. Bunker said. ""Well, I'm glad it was no worse. At first, it sounded as though the house was coming down. You had better play some other game now.""

""I am worried,"" Mr. Bunker said. ""I've had quite a loss! It's some valuable real estate papers. They are gone from my office, and I came to see if they were on my desk in the house. Hello, children!"" he called to the six little Bunkers. But even Mun Bun seemed to know that something was wrong. Daddy Bunker's voice was not at all jolly.

Russ and Rose stayed on the porch with their parents. Mr. Bunker explained that valuable real estate papers were missing, potentially causing a significant financial loss. Despite searching, the papers were nowhere to be found. Mr. Bunker recalled placing them in the pocket of his old coat before going out to the lumberyard."|"[""1.

Mr. Bunker hurried back to his office after realizing he left important papers in the pocket of his old coat. He asked his children, Rose and Russ, to come along, leaving the younger ones playing in the sand. On the way, Mr. Bunker posed a riddle to the kids about lollipops. At the office, the clerks greeted the children as Mr. Bunker searched for the papers. He recalled leaving them in the coat pocket when he went to inspect lumber with Mr. Johnson.

Once, a tramp claiming to be a former lumberman asked for help. Mr. Bunker had forgotten about giving him his old coat, which had important papers inside. Now, Mr. Bunker realized his mistake and decided to involve the police to find the tramp and retrieve the papers. Meanwhile, the Bunker family received an invitation from Grandma Bell to visit her in Maine for the summer. Mr. Bunker wanted to discuss this with his wife and also address the issue of the missing papers. Russ and Rose, his children, were concerned about their father's worries. They didn't know much about real estate but understood the importance of the situation. They all needed to sort out the matter with the tramp and decide on the trip to Maine.|"['1.

"""Yes, that's true,"" Mr. Bunker remarked. ""He might be honest and return the papers, but we can't be sure. I'll call the police to keep an eye out for the red-haired tramp who visited my office."" Pineville had only a few policemen who were familiar with Mr. Bunker. He phoned the chief to alert them about the missing papers and the tramp. After informing his office staff and friends, Daddy Bunker decided to celebrate the Fourth of July at home before heading to Maine.

Mrs. Bunker chuckled at the thought of the mishap with the old barrel steamboats. The Bunker children had been playing in the barn, enjoying games like pretending the wagon was a stagecoach. Norah called them in to serve cream on the porch. Jerry shared a story about a close call with a shell in the Philippines. Norah explained the thunder-and-lightning cake she made, with its unique pink streaks. After Jerry left to get gas for the car, a tramp approached, mistaking the children for the paperboy.

"""I'm hungry,"" said the ragged man. ""I can't work much. All I want is something to eat. I don't have any of your father's papers. Is he home? Or your mother?""

""I don't know what the boy is talking about,"" interrupted the tramp. ""I just wanted a bite to eat. I don't have your papers. But if I see a red-haired lumberman, I'll tell him to return them to you.""

Later that evening, the Bunker family went to watch fireworks in the city square. They were mesmerized by the colorful display, forgetting about missing papers and tramps.

The box Laddie made for Vi's boat had many holes, causing it to sink in the brook. Vi got scared and screamed while Laddie couldn't figure out why it sank.

Mrs. Bunker glanced up from her work to see Rose cradling a real baby instead of her doll. The baby, now crying, had been mistaken for Rose's doll due to their similar white shawls. Daddy Bunker quickly realized the mix-up and comforted the baby. The passengers found the situation amusing, and the family soon headed to the dining car for supper on the train. After dinner, the berths were prepared for bedtime. Mr. Bunker learned they could save time by changing trains at Clearwell, getting them to Lake Sagatook earlier. The family gathered their things as the train approached the junction, where they would switch trains.

As they chatted, Laddie's father appeared in the crowd, relieved to find his son. The man revealed that he was asked by Mrs. Bell to pick up Laddie, as he had the only car around. They all hopped into the car and soon arrived at Grandma Bell's house by the beautiful blue lake. Welcomed with warm hugs and kisses, the family was overjoyed to be together. Mr. Mead, the man who helped Laddie, realized he had forgotten about a parrot in a cage under the back seat of his car, which had been peacefully napping throughout the journey.|"['1.

Mr. Mead took out a parrot from a hidden compartment in his car, delighting the children. The green bird immediately started grooming itself in the sunlight. Mrs. Bell, not a fan of parrots, preferred her dog and cat. Mr. Mead joked about the parrot keeping him company on the rest of the journey. Grandma Bell welcomed everyone warmly, cautioning the children about the nearby lake. After a meal and changing into play clothes, the children dashed out to explore. They had fun racing around, with even a cat joining in on the excitement. Grandma Bell's house was near woods, fields, and a lake in Maine. The children's grandfather had once owned a large farm there. The lively and picturesque setting was perfect for the six little Bunkers, who were eager to enjoy their time there.|"['1.

Thomas Hardy explained that Russ had an adventure on the old treadmill in the barn. Russ had wandered upstairs and started walking on the wooden roller platform. He had to keep running to avoid slipping down. Grandma Bell cautioned Russ about playing with unfamiliar machines. She described how the treadmill was used in the past to power farm equipment. The other Bunkers joined in to see the treadmill in action. Tom demonstrated how it worked by walking on the platform, making the wheel spin faster. The family then discussed going down to the lake for some water fun. Grandma Bell suggested they play near the shore where it was safe.

Daddy Bunker discovered a sandy spot that Grandma Bell had mentioned, perfect for the children to play safely. Dressed in old clothes to avoid getting dirty with sand and water, they all headed to Lake Sagatook. Under the shade of the large woods, they began to have a blast. Russ and Laddie crafted small boats and floated them on the calm blue water. Rose and Vi entertained themselves with their dolls. Meanwhile, Mun Bun and Margy dug in the sand with sticks they found nearby. The kids were enjoying their time when they heard splashing water and the sound of oars from a rowboat. As the boat approached, they noticed a big man with very red hair and a worn-out coat. He greeted the children warmly and inquired if they lived at Mrs. Bell's place. Laddie, one of the older boys, politely asked if he was a lumberman, not wanting to offend the man. The man, amused by the children's presence, explained that he lived on the other side of the lake and visited for fishing trips.|"['1.

While Laddie and Russ had a fun rowing adventure with their father on the lake, they also learned how to row. Their father mentioned that they would enjoy rowing even more once they learned to swim. The family then decided to try their luck at fishing to bring some home for dinner. As they prepared to fish, they remembered that Muffin, their pet, was also hungry for fish. After their fishing plans, they set off to find strawberries on a hill across the sheep meadow. While walking, they shared stories about the children's mother's childhood. However, they soon realized that Margy was lagging behind, picking flowers. Suddenly, a ram appeared and started moving towards Margy due to her bright red coat.

Grandma Bell and Margy found themselves near a ram in the meadow. The ram, named Bunko, seemed a bit agitated. Despite wearing a red coat that usually agitates animals, Margy remained unharmed. Grandma Bell explained that animals like the ram may get spooked by certain colors. They decided to leave the meadow and head towards the wild strawberries. As they picked the red berries, they had a delightful time. Even though they ate more than they collected, they planned to take some home to Daddy Bunker.

Russ searched the house for his brother Laddie but found a trail of sugar leading outside. Following it, he discovered Laddie planning to feed the sheep sugar instead of salt.

Laddie described Zip's guidance in the cart as similar to a horse or a boat. Since dogs need to keep their mouths open to cool off, there was no bit like in a horse's mouth. Despite Zip's fatigue from pulling the cart for over an hour, the children were considerate and gave him a break with water and a bone. The Bunkers enjoyed various activities at Grandma Bell's, from rowing trips to hunting for berries. Russ and Laddie discussed the tramp lumberman with red hair who took their father's coat.

Mr. Hurd mentioned the possibility of a tramp finding valuable real estate papers in an old coat pocket. He shared that a red-haired lumberman was hired by Mr. Barker, possibly a tramp out of season. Mr. Hurd advised the boys to inform their father to investigate the red-haired man. As Mr. Hurd rode off, Zip, the dog, was resting until a white rabbit appeared, prompting Zip to chase it. This sudden chase caused the dog-cart to sway, and the boys struggled to stay inside. Despite their efforts to stop Zip, the dog was determined to chase the rabbit. If the woods had been rougher, the cart might have been damaged. Zip's muzzle prevented him from feeling discomfort, and he continued the chase despite the boys' attempts to stop him.|['1.

Zip was on a wild chase after the white rabbit until the rabbit cleverly darted into his burrow, a safe underground house. Zip, disappointed, barked outside the hole, inviting the rabbit to come out. Moving on, Zip and the boys, Russ and Laddie, arrived at Mr. Barker's large house by Green Pond. The gate-tender mistook them for children visiting Mrs. Bell and made a joke about eating buns, referring to Russ's nickname, Bun. The boys clarified their visit was to see the lumberman who unknowingly took their dad's coat with important papers.|"['Question 1:\nWhat did the white rabbit do when Zip was chasing it?\nA) It hopped over Zip\nB) It hid in a burrow\nC) It climbed a tree\nD) It swam across a pond\nE) It flew away', ""Question 2:\nWhy did Zip bark outside the rabbit's burrow?\nA) To scare the rabbit out\nB) To play with the rabbit\nC) To invite the rabbit out\nD) To warn the rabbit\nE) To mark his territory"", 'Question 3:\nWho did the gate-tender mistake Zip and the boys for?\nA) Children visiting Mrs. Bell\nB) Delivery boys\nC) Lost travelers\nD) Gardeners\nE) Salesmen', 'Question 4:\nWhat did the gate-tender joke about when he saw the boys?\nA) Eating ice cream\nB) Eating buns\nC) Drinking lemonade\nD) Playing catch\nE) Flying kites', ""Question 5:\nWhy did the gate-tender joke about eating buns?\nA) He was hungry\nB) Russ's nickname was Bun\nC) He wanted to tease the boys\nD) He thought the boys were carrying buns\nE) He liked buns"", ""Question 6:\nWhy did the boys clarify their visit to Mr. Barker's house?\nA) To ask for directions\nB) To return a lost item\nC) To complain about the gate-tender\nD) To find a place to stay\nE) To retrieve their dad's coat with important papers""]"|"['B) It hid in a burrow', 'C) To invite the rabbit out', 'A) Children visiting Mrs. Bell', 'B) Eating buns', ""B) Russ's nickname was Bun"", ""E) To retrieve their dad's coat with important papers""]"
The gatekeeper recognized the red-haired lumberman mentioned by the visitor. The lumberman, named Mike Gannon, was hired to cut trees for a new dock at Green Pond. The gatekeeper directed the visitor to follow the road to the lake where Mike lived in a cabin. The gatekeeper also mentioned that Mike was used to living alone and could camp near the dock site. The gatekeeper inquired if the visitor's dog would guide them to Mike's cabin. Meanwhile, a commotion ensued when the visitor's dog chased a cat, causing a soap-box cart to tip over with two boys inside. Despite the chaos, the cat stood her ground and scratched the dog on the nose, leading to a standoff between the two animals. As the boys tried to fix the cart, a red-haired man emerged from a nearby log cabin without a coat, catching their attention.|"['1.

But your dog appears to be scratched,"" continued the man, noticing more red spots of blood on Zip's nose. ""No, we don't live in the big house,"" Russ explained, as the man gestured towards Mr. Barker's residence. ""We reside at Lake Sagatook--I mean, we're visiting Grandma Bell--and we came to see you.

Russ quickly explained that the coat was not meant to be worn, and Mr. Gannon, the red-haired tramp lumberman, had kept it despite its ragged condition. He mentioned that the coat was obtained from a real estate office in Pineville, but the pockets were empty when he received it, with no papers inside. Russ, Laddie, and Zip, the dog, drove back slowly toward Grandma Bell's house, as Zip was tired from chasing a rabbit and a cat. As they reached the top of the hill and headed towards Lake Sagatook, Zip picked up his pace, sensing rest and supper awaiting him in the barn. The sun was setting, casting longer shadows, and darkness was approaching. Russ continued sharing their visit to Mr. Gannon's cabin at Green Pond, where they learned more about the mysterious coat.|"[""1.
