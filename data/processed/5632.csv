Jefferson nodded, determined to help Phronsie with the pie. With skillful fingers, he added more butter and flour, guiding her through the process. However, Mr. King intervened, insisting on a less professional touch. He called for more flour and instructed Phronsie to start over.

"""We need to be quiet and run,"" Phronsie whispered to her grandfather and Jefferson, worried about the pie.

Marian stood firm against Mrs. Chatterton's criticism. With determination in her voice, she declared that no more negative words would be tolerated.

Phronsie was excited as she shared a plan with her family. She announced that Grandpapa would take everyone to visit the little brown house. The family eagerly discussed the trip, while Mrs. Chatterton expressed her disdain and left for a distant visit. The Peppers and Mrs. Whitney's family were set to go. The Peppers would stay in the little brown house, while the others would lodge at the old hotel in Hingham. Mrs. Pepper was relieved to know that Mr. King would stay at the parsonage instead of the dreary hotel. Jasper was thrilled by the new arrangement, and he and Ben happily prepared for the trip. The family was looking forward to the three-day adventure.|['1.

Dr. Fisher, with his eyes shining behind his glasses, arrived late as he was tending to a sick patient. He offered to drive the group in his carriage. Polly eagerly agreed, reminiscing about their previous outing. Mr. Tisbett struggled to organize the townsfolk eager to catch a glimpse of the Peppers. Eventually, everyone was settled, and the carriage set off. Polly, overwhelmed with emotion, asked not to see their home before her family. Dr. Fisher took a detour down a lane, and Polly could almost smell the flowers under the snow. She anxiously awaited the arrival of the stage. Finally, they reached the little brown house, where Phronsie was in awe, and Polly kissed the door in excitement. Mr. King suggested giving them a moment alone.|['1.

"""Yes, sir,"" said Mr. Tisbett cheerfully. ""Mis' Henderson had her boys light the fires early this morning, and there's plenty of food."" The stage-driver, eager to chat, was stopped by the old gentleman's command to drive on and stop talking. Mr. Tisbett, feeling slighted, drove roughly over the bumpy road.

"""I believe we will become good friends, Mr. Tisbett,"" Jasper warmly expressed, looking towards the cozy little brown house. At that moment, the door swung open, and all the young Peppers and Whitneys eagerly poured out to assist with unloading. The afternoon was well advanced, and the December twilight descended swiftly around the cheerful occupants of the small brown house. No one wished to light the candles until the very last minute. Mother Pepper, seated in her old rocker by the west window, remarked, ""You held us together many times, Polly, when nothing else could.""

Jasper excitedly proposed a baking adventure, throwing caution to the wind. Mr. King warmly invited everyone in for a baking session after a restful night. Jasper and Ben, donned in aprons, rolled dough under Polly's guidance. Grandma Bascom marveled at Phronsie's baking skills. Joel and David were also busy with their dough.

Phronsie, accompanied by an elderly gentleman who was worried about her safety, placed her pan in the warmest spot and checked the clock. She predicted that in twenty-one minutes, her baking would be complete and nicely browned. Within that time, the kitchen transformed from a baking hubbub to a tidy space with a display of biscuits and cookies, including Phronsie's gingerbread boy. Outside, a delightful surprise awaited the Peppers and their friends: Deacon Brown's wagon, pulled by a livelier horse than usual. Everyone hopped on the wagon, with Mr. King seated in a chair. The group set off on a drive, passing through town and arriving at Grandma Bascom's cottage, where Joel enthusiastically greeted her. The wagon journey continued, visiting Mr. Beebe's shoe shop, indulging in sugary doughnuts, and enjoying pink and white sticks. The day ended with a visit to the parsonage for supper, filled with laughter and fond memories shared among the friends.|"['1.

"""No, you mustn't,"" exclaimed Dick, entering just in time to hear the final words. ""Mom said we shouldn't have anything different for breakfast than what the Peppers are having. I like the yellow stuff; can I have some?"" He settled into a chair and handed his plate to Mrs. Pepper. ""I'm not having it,"" Dick insisted. ""The minister's wife said it was good, and she offered me some, but I told her I was going to the Peppers for breakfast. Grandpa also liked it; he had seconds,"" he added.

Despite his initial horror, he appreciated her effort. Candace then started preparing pins for Jasper's collection, using old needles with new wax heads. The boy kept her busy with this task, and she happily made a rag doll with materials from her past. Polly and Jasper found Candace's work impressive, and they decided to fetch Phronsie from Helen's house. Hannah, the maid, informed them that Phronsie had gone to Helen's, causing Polly to rush in a panic to find her."|"['1.

There was a commotion in the large house. Everyone was worried about Mr. King's well-being after a fright left him in a distressed state. Hortense informed Mrs. Whitney that Madame wouldn't be coming home for lunch as she was taken by de Mees Taylor from the modiste. Mrs. Whitney, with a determined look, instructed Hortense to leave immediately. Madame Dyce defended the Peppers, expressing empathy for their past struggles.

Mrs. Chatterton felt overwhelmed as she struggled to maintain her composure. She called for her maid, Hortense, to bring her a remedy for her nerves. Looking at her reflection in the mirror, she was startled by the sight of her pale face. With Hortense's assistance, she made her way to the window for fresh air. Despite the arrival of doctors and the darkening room, she clung to the window frame for support. Meanwhile, Mr. King, upon hearing advice from Fisher, acquiesced and returned to his chair. On the other hand, Polly comforted Phronsie, suggesting they both drift off to sleep.

Joel, determined to face the challenge, braced himself in his chair. As he reflected on the daunting task ahead, he couldn't help but chuckle at the thought of being all skin and bone. Suddenly, a flash of panic struck him as he spotted eyes peering through the keyhole. Fear gripped him, but Mamsie's stern gaze spurred him into action. With no firearms allowed, Joel armed himself with a club, ready to defend against the intruders. As the figures advanced, Joel acted swiftly, using the window drapery to create a diversion and escape. Meanwhile, Van and Percy found themselves in a chaotic situation, with a pistol-wielding Thomas mistaking them for burglars. Despite the commotion, Joel, injured but determined, urged everyone to remain calm and not alarm Mamsie.|"['1.

"In a quick moment, Joel was placed on his bed, and the wound, which turned out to be minor, was tended to. Everyone let out a sigh of relief. ""Let Van know I'm okay,"" Joel repeated. ""Please remove this scary thing,"" Polly said, untying the mask. ""Oh no, it's tangled. Let me fetch the scissors,"" she added, rushing off.

Polly thought about Phronsie, who was not having her planned party the next day. Jasper reassured Polly about a scratch on Percy's face and went to clean it. Joel insisted that Phronsie's party should go on despite his illness, threatening consequences if anyone suggested otherwise. He wanted the schoolbooks on the table neatly put away. The next day, Phronsie was unaware of the events from the night before. Cathie brought a doll as a sensible gift. Polly helped Phronsie manage the many dolls she received. Grandpapa emphasized his relationship to Phronsie when giving her a doll, hinting at Cousin Eunice's gift choice.|"[""1.

""Goodness me!"" Alexia exclaimed, stumbling back and almost knocking over Cathie. ""Polly Pepper, oh dear!"" She then sat on the floor, laughing until tears streamed down her face.

But Alexia couldn't stop herself. Amid Candace's story of fixing the doll's hair and clothes, laughter echoed through the room, catching everyone's attention.

"""Phronsie, it's time to make the children happy,"" Mr. King said, moving away from the cabinet. ""Shall we take them to the playroom to share the dolls?"" Phronsie disagreed, feeling she needed to inform her ""children"" first. She quickly went upstairs and returned with arms full of dolls. She handed a doll to Jane, saying, ""This one's for you.

Mr. Whitney pondered by the warm fire, questioning why anyone would want to cross the ocean again. He doubted he would unless forced. Mr. King mentioned a woman and challenged the group to guess who they were talking about. The discussion revolved around the Hendersons, praised for their kindness to Dicky and the group. They planned an expedition to ease things for the Hendersons. Many ended up joining the trip, including Alexia Rhys, Mr. Alstyne, Mr. Cabot, Mary Taylor, and others. Livingston Bayley unexpectedly hopped on the train, and Cousin Eunice Chatterton also joined, handing Phronsie a secret message for Mr. King.
