"External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect. They often ""came down"" handsomely, and Scrooge never did. Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome looks, ""My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?"" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, ""No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!"" But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones call ""nuts"" to Scrooge"|"['1.

Scrooge sternly warned his clerk to keep quiet or risk losing his job. Then, turning to his cheerful nephew, Scrooge was urged to engage in politics due to his persuasive speaking skills.

On a cold and foggy Christmas Eve, Scrooge shut down his office with reluctance. The clerk hurriedly extinguished his candle, eager to leave for the day. Scrooge grumbled about the tradition of Christmas and left for home. In his dreary chambers, he lived alone, the building seeming out of place and forgotten. The fog and frost enveloped the house, adding to its melancholy. As Scrooge fumbled with the key in the door, he was startled to see Marley's face on the knocker, looking ghostly and eerie. Despite his initial shock, Scrooge entered, lit a candle, and tried to dismiss the strange sight.

The noise echoed loudly in the house, resembling thunder. Scrooge, unaffected by the echoes, secured the door and ascended the stairs leisurely. The staircase was wide enough to accommodate a hearse, and Scrooge imagined a locomotive hearse ahead in the darkness. After checking his rooms, he settled by the dim fire with a bowl of gruel. The fireplace, adorned with Dutch tiles depicting biblical scenes, failed to warm him. Marley's face haunted his thoughts, overshadowing the tiles. Startled, he noticed a disused bell in the room swinging softly, then loudly, setting off all the bells in the house. The ringing stopped abruptly, followed by a clanking noise akin to chains being dragged in the cellar, a sound often associated with ghosts in haunted places.|"['1.

His color changed when the ghost entered the room. The dying flame leaped up as if recognizing Marley's Ghost. It was indeed Marley, with his pigtail, waistcoat, and boots, all adorned with tassels. He wore a long chain made of cash-boxes, keys, and ledgers. Scrooge could see through his transparent body. Despite observing him closely, Scrooge still doubted his senses. The ghost sat down, and Scrooge, trying to distract himself, cracked a joke. The ghost's voice terrified him. The specter had an eerie atmosphere around it. Scrooge feared the ghost and held onto his chair tightly. When the ghost removed its bandage, revealing a jaw dropped in horror, it spoke of the consequences of not living a fulfilling life. The ghost explained that the chain it wore was self-forged and heavy, symbolizing the weight of unfulfilled opportunities.|"[""1.

"The room was filled with eerie phantoms, drifting restlessly and wailing as they moved. Each one was shackled like Marley's Ghost; some were even chained together, unable to break free. Scrooge recognized many of them from his past. One ghost, in particular, haunted him – an old figure with an iron safe bound to its ankle, lamenting its inability to aid a distressed woman and her child. These spirits seemed to yearn to intervene positively in human affairs but were forever powerless. Scrooge shut the window and inspected the locked door through which the Ghost had entered. Despite being securely bolted, he hesitated to dismiss the encounter as mere ""Humbug!"" The clock chimed, indicating a time that contradicted his earlier recollection, fueling his confusion. As he pondered the visitation, the curtains of his bed were suddenly drawn back, revealing a spectral figure standing before him, plunging him into a state of uncertainty and fear."|"['1.

The figure was peculiar, resembling both a child and an old man seen through a supernatural lens. Its hair, white with age, contrasted with unwrinkled skin and a youthful glow. Long, muscular arms and hands held a branch of holly. Dressed in a white tunic with a radiant belt, the figure's attire was adorned with summer flowers. A bright light emitted from its head, revealing its changing form. As Scrooge observed, the figure shifted from one shape to another in the dimness. The Ghost reproached Scrooge for extinguishing its light with worldly concerns. Despite Scrooge's excuses about the cold, the Spirit led him through a wall to a snowy winter day.

They abandoned the main road and took a familiar path leading to a mansion made of dull red bricks. The mansion had a small weathercock on its roof and a bell hanging in a cupola. Despite its size, the mansion had fallen on hard times. The outbuildings were in disrepair, with damp walls and broken windows. Fowls roamed freely around the stables, and the coach-houses were overgrown with grass. Inside, the rooms were poorly furnished, cold, and vast. The air smelled musty, and the place felt empty and cold. They walked through a dreary hall to a long, empty room with plain desks and forms.

Scrooge's past self enlarged at the words, and the room grew darker and dirtier. The panels shrank, windows cracked, and plaster fell from the ceiling.
