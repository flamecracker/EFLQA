Tom adamantly expressed his determination to gamble his gold nuggets against Gashford at the store that night. Despite the warnings from his friend Fred, Tom was resolute.

Gashford, a solitary man with a hidden bag of gold, kept to himself in the camp. Lynch law ruled the area, where theft meant death.

"Flinders took out his shiny knife and gave it to his leader, who used it to cut off some extra rope. The prisoner's hands were tied behind his back like a sailor. Paddy, with a laugh, bowed and made a show of respect. He then playfully swung the knife, let out a war cry, and hopped around. In his playful swing, he accidentally cut part of the rope binding the prisoner. This bold move went unnoticed. Flinders, in a sudden move, grabbed Paddy and threw him down next to the prisoner.

The chase ended quickly as everyone gathered around the fire, realizing that hunting in the dark was futile. Fred Westly remained by the fire, while Gashford and Paddy Flinders joined the group. Paddy, disoriented, couldn't see well in the dark and comically narrated his mishaps. Gashford, determined to capture the fugitive, rallied a group of men to continue the pursuit. Some men, tired and disinterested, decided to head home the next day. As the moon rose, Gashford and his men set out, but the fugitive, Tom Brixton, had already gained a significant lead. Tom, despite feeling weakened and exhausted from his wounds and lack of rest, continued running ahead. The pursuers, led by a Native guide, struggled to keep up due to frequent stops to track footprints.

A feeling of despair came over the brave young man when he began to lose his strength. Near daybreak, he heard water and felt hopeful, realizing he was close to a river. He planned to drink and leave no trace by wading downstream. Finding a hidden canoe, he set off quickly, leaving the gold behind. He headed towards a gold-digger named Paul Bevan, who lived far away in a remote gorge. Despite not finding much gold, many miners visited him due to his daughter Betty's charm. Betty was not a beauty in the conventional sense, but her kind nature and grace made her irresistible. Tom Brixton, a miner, was drawn to her, captivated by her kindness and simplicity.|"['1.

"Even Crossby, the gruff worker, shared similar feelings about Betty, but in cruder terms. ""She's a beauty,"" he once told a friend, ""that's what she is, no doubt. With her big loving eyes, her sweet smile, and her graceful figure, she's a catch for any man. But she's too religious for my taste. That won't do in the mining camp."" This perceived flaw hindered Betty's chances at finding a husband, as it kept away many rowdy miners and made even the respectable men feel awkward around her. Tom Brixton, however, had once courted her boldly, but her strong religious beliefs had ultimately pushed him away. Now, as a fugitive, Tom navigated his canoe towards Paul Bevan's home, grappling with a mix of emotions. He felt a sense of guilt and shame, especially as he neared Betty's innocence.

Despite his dislike for Bevan, Tom decided to tell Betty the truth and give her up. Bevan suggested Tom deny the theft and confuse Betty with a fabricated story.

Mister Gashford insisted on capturing Tom Brixton, suspected of theft. Bevan tried to delay, but Gashford was determined. They searched the premises, suspecting Tom was hidden. Gashford got stuck in a trap-door, unable to move. Despite efforts to free him, he remained stuck. Flinders suggested giving him a beating, but Gashford stayed calm.

Tom Brixton found himself in a dire situation, bound and led back to Paul Bevan's hut. The fear of facing death as a thief haunted him, especially the thought of appearing in front of the girl he loved in such a humiliated state. Alone in the cellar, his mind wandered to thoughts of home and his mother, seeking solace in the darkness. Despite the impending doom, he clung to hope, praying for mercy. At daybreak, he was roused and given a meager meal before being forced to march with the miners. Fred Westly, his loyal comrade, sought permission to speak with Tom but was met with resistance.

"""Dear Tom,"" Fred whispered reassuringly, ""don't lose hope. Remember, with God, all things are possible. Even if your life is at stake, it's never too late for redemption. Jesus is willing and able to save. I promise to do everything in my power to rescue you. Many of the miners don't wish for you to face the harshest punishment, and I believe Gashford can be persuaded. I had a stash hidden under the pine tree, but I must confess, I gambled it away in a moment of weakness. Tom, the allure of gambling, especially when combined with alcohol, is a powerful temptation. I understand your struggle, but I won't give up on you. I'm determined to save you, body and soul. Does Gashford know about this?""

As the sun began to set, they arrived at Pine Tree Diggings. Tom Brixton was confined in a sturdy blockhouse, used as a prison. Fred was consumed by despair in his tent that night. His plans to save Tom seemed shattered when his hidden gold, intended to secure Tom's freedom, was lost due to Tom's actions.

Pat gathered his friends in a secluded dell under moonlit branches, proposing to raise five hundred pounds to buy off Gashford. The group, willing to help poor Tom Brixton, agreed.

While Tom was pondering his decision, Bully Gashford and Fred discussed plans nearby. In a mountain gorge not far off, a group plotted a sweeping operation to raid Pine Tree Diggings. The gang, led by Stalker, aimed to attack the camp, steal gold, and free a prisoner named Brixton. Stalker's plan involved a diversion at the blockhouse, where Brixton was held. The gang prepared to advance silently, with Stalker's signal being an owl's hoot. Meanwhile, Fred and Flinders readied to escape with Tom.

The stable on the outskirts of the camp was the most distant building where the marauders were headed. It was a simple log-hut on a small hill overlooking the camp and Tom Brixton's nearby prison. Paddy Flinders thought about the dangers ahead as he approached the hut. He heard voices nearby and found a log to hide behind. Stalker, the captain, planned to free Brixton from prison and signaled the attack. Flinders rushed to his tent, grabbed his comrade, and urgently warned him. He then led the way to Gashford's hut, followed by Fred Westly. Flinders burst into the hut, grabbed Gashford, and told him to follow. They all hurried to the prison, where Flinders locked the door, warning the group of an imminent attack.|"['1.

The words were spoken energetically but in a hushed tone as footsteps approached stealthily. A rubbing sound followed, like someone feeling for the door handle. After a brief pause, a soft tap echoed. Flinders, suspicious, challenged the intruder, believing them to be associated with Irish thieves. As the door swung open, the robber lunged, but Flinders struck him down with a wooden billet. Flinders then led the miners into battle against Gashford's armed men. Amidst the chaos, Fred Westly realized the danger and quickly prepared to flee on horseback with Flinders. The situation was dire, with the risk of being caught and facing severe consequences.

Tom quickly mounted his horse, urging his comrades to do the same. They rode away from Pine Tree Diggings under the cover of darkness. By the time they reached the Red Man's Teacup spring, it was almost midnight. Knowing this was a common resting spot, they decided to halt briefly to rest and refresh themselves and their horses. Tom anticipated that the robber-chief's men would take time to regroup after the recent events. Despite the dangers, they decided to make a swift departure to avoid any potential encounters. Their decision proved wise as the robbers arrived shortly after they left. The robbers, led by Stalker, camped at the same spot, unaware of the recent visitors. Meanwhile, Fred and his friends were also on their way to Simpson's Gully, a new goldfield, which coincidentally was in the same direction as the robbers.

Imperfection often leads to mistakes and misdirected actions in everyone. If we believe that Divine guidance only exists when we are completely free of errors, then there would be no such thing as God's guidance at all. Do you agree with that? Some people deny the existence of God, and we can only offer them our sympathy and prayers. When it comes to committing our ways to God, it's not about blindly moving forward and hoping for the best. God's guidance involves trusting in Him, seeking His wisdom, and acting with discretion. In a challenging situation, seek guidance from God, listen, observe, and act wisely. Remember what Flinders said about Bevan's Gully before we were interrupted. Let's head there quickly; Paddy might have overheard something crucial that could help us prevent further harm.

"""No smell o' drink there,"" he muttered. Then he untied Fred's neckcloth and loosened his belt. Then, as nothing resulted from these acts, he set himself to lift the fallen man in his arms. Being a sturdy fellow he succeeded, though with considerable difficulty, and staggered with his burden towards the hut, where he was met by his anxious daughter. While the active girl ran to the outer room or ""hall"" of the hut for the desired beverage, Paul slyly forced a teaspoonful of diluted brandy into Fred's mouth. It had, at all events, the effect of restoring him to consciousness, for he opened his eyes and glanced from side to side with a bewildered air. Then he sat up suddenly, and said--""Then swallow some grub an' make your mind easy. They won't be here for some hours yet, for you've come on at a rate that no party of men could beat, I see that clear enough--unless they were mounted.""""Pooh! that's nothing.

A loud yell interrupted the conversation, startling the speaker. He quickly barricaded the hut's door and windows, realizing their unexpected visitors had arrived. With urgency, he instructed Betty to secure the small window and gather weapons. The man, identified as Paul Bevan, prepared defenses against the approaching threat. Just in time, a man named Flinders burst in, explaining his involvement with the intruders. Flinders revealed his shooting skills had earned him a leadership role among the bandits, but he had escaped to warn Paul and his companions.

Betty had a plan. She knew Tolly would search everywhere for them, but there was a half cave in the cliff where they used to read. Betty wrote a note and left it in the cave, saying they were off to Simpson's Gully. The group set off quickly, leaving Flinders in the cart and Fred on the spare horse. Meanwhile, Stalker and his men arrived at Bevan's Gully, enraged to find Flinders gone. Stalker fell into a trap set by Bevan on a bridge. They searched the stronghold but found no one and nothing valuable except gunpowder. Unable to carry it all, Stalker decided to blow up the hut. However, the slow match took longer than expected, causing a massive explosion that lit up the night sky and destroyed the fortress.|"['1.

Tolly Trevor found himself in a state of shock after being unconscious, only to realize he was racing towards a destroyed fortress on his horse. Despite trying to stop, the horse wouldn't listen. Luckily, the pony he was riding obeyed commands and halted just in time, although it was a struggle for Tolly's arm. After securing the horses, he approached the ruins of his friend's home, devastated by the destruction. Despite the chaos, Tolly was determined to search for any clues left by his missing friends.

Though the idea of a catastrophe was unthinkable, the mere thought of it made young Trevor's lower lip quiver, tears clouded his eyes, and an indescribable feeling choked his throat. Anxious about his friends, he searched the ruined hut, fearing the worst. Resting on a rock, the desolate moonlit scene overwhelmed him, and he wept. Gathering his resolve, he wiped his tears, ready to continue his quest. Suddenly, a distant flicker of light caught his attention. It was the robbers' camp. Though armed only with domestic tools, he stealthily approached the camp, eavesdropping on their plans. The chief spoke of heading south to the Sawback Hills, seeking revenge on a certain Bevan and intending to claim Betty as his own. Alarmed, Trevor retreated, remembering Bevan's directions to Simpson's Gully. Determined and self-reliant, he rode off into the night, carrying only the essentials for survival.|"[""1.

In the forest near Bevan's Gully, three Native Americans, adorned in vibrant colors and feathers, moved silently through the trees. Walking in a single line, they suddenly halted at a strange footprint. With a mix of sounds, they communicated and discovered Tom Brixton lying near a spring. The men swiftly lifted Tom and carried him away, taking turns to bear his weight. Meanwhile, Tolly Trevor, exhausted and bruised from his own journey, stumbled upon the scene. His horses, worn out and defeated, reflected his own weary state.

The poor boy carefully gathered the few crumbs in his wallet, savoring each bite to prolong his satisfaction. After two days in the forest, he appeared thinner and weaker.

Paul explained to Betty Bevan that they couldn't wait for her because they were all set to leave and there were no horses available except the tired ones that Tolly Trevor had brought. Tolly was fast asleep, completely worn out from his wilderness adventures. After the men departed, Betty, known as the Rose of Oregon, tended to the horses and packed supplies. She then prepared weapons and mysterious items before retiring to her tent. The next morning, she woke Tolly, who was still asleep, and handed him a pork pie for breakfast. Betty shared her plan with Tolly to search for Mr. Brixton through the Long Gap, and they discussed the possibility of facing danger. Tolly agreed to accompany her, impressed by being chosen as her protector. They considered recruiting miners for support but ultimately decided to venture forth alone.|"[""1.

Trevor, excited for adventure, let out a war-whoop and raced off on the pony. The obedient pony and the stubborn horse galloped across the plain until the pony tripped in a badger-hole.

"""Yes, this is the Long Gap,"" the girl replied, tossing her curls back and surveying the surroundings. ""It cuts through the range here and gets much wilder and harder to cross on horseback further ahead.""

""What's your plan, Betty?"" the boy asked as they rode slowly towards the opening, which appeared like a dark entrance to the hills. ""If you find out the Redskins have taken Tom Brixton in this direction, what then? We can't rescue him, you know.""

""True, Tolly. If I discover they've gone this way, I'll ride straight to father's camp. He told me where he plans to sleep tonight, so I can find him easily, tell him what we found, and bring him back here.""

Before Tolly could finish his sentence, two painted Indians jumped out from the bushes, one grabbing him and the other the girl. Despite Tolly's struggle, the savage tied his hands while the other examined the saddlebags. Betty, unharmed, was let go after her weapons were taken. The Indians then made Tolly mount a pony and led him away, while the other helped Betty remount and followed.

A quick meal readied the rugged backwoodsmen for their journey towards the Sawback mountain range before daybreak. During the two-day trip, the botanist's demeanor shifted. He turned quiet, almost gloomy, distancing himself from conversations and often rode alone ahead or behind the group. The day after a stranger joined them, Fred quietly remarked to Bevan about suspicions regarding the botanist's true identity, to which Bevan bluntly dismissed the concerns.

In this world, fortunes can change unexpectedly. The couple searching for Indians didn't find them, but the Indians found them instead. As they journeyed through the Long Gap and the Sawback Hills, they encountered a group of twenty Indians from the same tribe as their captors. The two groups seemed to have been seeking each other, gesturing excitedly and communicating in their own way. The couple discussed a daring escape plan, but the man, Tolly, was tied up and felt helpless. Meanwhile, another group approached with what seemed to be a person wrapped in a blanket. Tolly speculated humorously about the situation, but Betty's sudden reaction hinted at something more serious.|"['1.

In great alarm, the boy turned to see where the girl stared so intensely. He saw his friend Tom Brixton, looking pale and thin, like a dead man, with closed eyes and bloodless lips. Tolly Trevor shouted, leaped off his pony, but couldn't stand due to his tied hands. Betty knelt beside Tom, lifted his head, and his sunken eyes widened at her touch. Tom whispered he felt weak and dying. Betty cut Tolly's bonds with a scalping knife, got water, and made a fire. She fed Tom sugar and water, while Tolly boiled dried meat for soup. The Indians, observing silently, cooked their meal on Tolly's fire. The chief ordered Betty to mount a horse, and they rode off, with Unaco leading and the Indians carrying Tom gently.|"['1.

As the Indian band journeyed through the Sawback Hills at dusk, Unaco suddenly halted and disappeared into the bushes. He returned with a determined look and gave orders to his warriors. They scattered into the underwood. Unaco led the way up the gorge, where they encountered four armed men preparing to camp. Unaco approached them openly, disarmed himself, and dispelled their suspicions. Tolly and Betty recognized the men. Unaco then signaled his hidden friends, who swiftly emerged and overpowered the group. Tolly cleverly feigned fear, while the captives were bound.

During their conversation, the Native Americans observed each speaker with interest, even though only their chief understood the words. Seizing the opportunity while they were distracted, Stalker, a robber chief, used his skills to free himself from his bonds. Despite the difficulty, he managed to escape the bindings expertly. As he leaped up to make a run for it, Tolly, a daring youth, anticipated his move. Tolly tripped Stalker, rendering him momentarily defenseless. Stalker attempted to resist but eventually succumbed, pretending to be defeated. The Native Americans, confused, believed Stalker had been subdued.

As the campfires were lit under the trees, the forest transformed into a vibrant banquet hall with natural decorations. Several campfires illuminated the red warriors, roasting steaks and cooking a rich mixture of dried meat and flour. Some Indians conversed in low tones, while others smoked calumets or tended to the food. Paul Bevan and his friends sat by a fire, with Unaco, the native chief, standing guard. The captives had one arm free to feed themselves while the other was tied securely. Paul, feeling lopsided, joked with his friends about their situation.

Paul encountered a tall and handsome Indian while hunting grizzly bears. Despite a dangerous trail, he followed the Indian until he found him injured at the bottom of a cliff. Paul carried him back to his camp, but the Indian's injuries were fatal. The Indian's brother, who Paul met on the way, shared that he had tried to seek help. Paul nursed the injured Indian, who couldn't speak but showed gratitude through his eyes. Sadly, the Indian passed away the next day. Paul buried him under a pine tree and sent the brother back to their tribe with provisions.

"Among believers, yes,"" responded Bevan; ""but individuals of European descent are not always followers of Christianity, just as indigenous individuals are not always evil. It appears to me that it's a matter of perspective. Furthermore, when the missionaries interact with the Native Americans, some convert to Christianity while others pretend to, much like individuals of European descent. I cannot speak to Unaco's beliefs regarding Christianity, as I am unaware. However, based on what I have heard about his character, I am confident that he is an honorable and genuine person. For the small favor I did for his son, he would be willing to make a significant sacrifice if necessary.""

""He wouldn't have caught up to us by now if he had encountered his troublemakers shortly after leaving us. In any case, he will likely send scouts in all directions and pursue our trail as soon as possible,"" Bevan added. ""Moreover, this visit to a friendly Native American tribe will be pleasant, and we might even come across gold. And when the hostile bandits do manage to locate us, we will have the support of the Native Americans, who are skilled fighters when defending a just cause and their homes are threatened.""

Mahogany Drake and Tolly debated whether smoking was suitable for boys and men. Tolly argued that if eating, drinking, and other activities were good for both, why not smoking? Mahogany Drake, a trapper, enjoyed smoking but didn't think deeply about its effects. Instead, he shared a story about a man named Miffy who was a ne'er-do-well. Miffy had a history of quitting various jobs due to being too hard or too easy. Despite his failures, the trappers took pity on him and let him join their group. When they reached a valley for trapping, they set camp at the Outlook due to Indian troubles. While crossing a gap, a trapper named Bounce showed off by leaping over it. The others chose a safer route by creating a plank bridge.|"[""1. What was Mahogany Drake's profession?\nA) Trapper\nB) Farmer\nC) Blacksmith\nD) Baker\nE) Carpenter"", ""2.

The trapper shared an exciting tale with Tolly and his friend about a dangerous encounter with a band of Redskins. As they returned from their traps, the trappers were ambushed, but cleverly escaped by using a plank to cross a gap. Miffy, who had been hunting, arrived just in time to join the escape. However, a mishap with the plank caused it to break, leaving Miffy stranded on the other side. In a daring move, Miffy leaped across the gap like a flying squirrel, landing safely but with a comical flop. The savages, shocked by his unexpected leap, fled, and the trappers held their ground until the danger passed. The trapper's storytelling skills captivated Tolly and his friend, who listened intently, their eyes fixed on the storyteller's face.|"['1.

Around the same time that someone was trying to harm Paul Bevan, Betty was in her tented room praying for friends and even foes. She recalled the events of the previous day and prayed for everyone, including the robber-chief and Tom Brixton. The next day, feeling refreshed, Betty went for a walk in the mountains. Coincidentally, Tom was there too. Tom, looking worn but determined, approached Betty to ask about his future plans. Betty, remembering their past encounters, remained silent. Tom mentioned concerns about Stalker following them, but Betty felt safe with the Indians. Betty shared how kind and intelligent the Indians were, especially Unaco's mother, who engaged her in deep conversations about religion.

Mahogany Drake and his companions, Leaping Buck and little Trevor, embarked on a journey to track down Tom Brixton in the mountains. The trapper, Mahogany Drake, initially offered to take charge of the search, but the trapper decided he would be better off going alone with Tolly Trevor and Leaping Buck. They followed Tom's trail, which was noticeable due to his unique swagger. The trio observed the trail of the robbers, including Stalker, who had veered off towards Tom Brixton's path. The trapper deduced that Tom was likely captured and needed their help. Tolly Trevor, showing his wit and bravery, suggested they were more than capable of taking on the robbers. The group continued their ascent, surrounded by majestic scenery of towering cliffs, forests, and distant snow-capped mountains. Tolly Trevor, in awe of the landscape, expressed a wish for wings to soar down into the valley below. The trapper mused on the potential chaos if humans had wings, highlighting the challenges and advantages of terrestrial travel over aerial mobility.|"['1.

Mahogany Drake chuckled softly and led his companions away from the rocky ledge, ascending the rugged mountain slopes cautiously to avoid detection. Tom Brixton, resolute in his mission, ventured into the mountains with a heavy heart, uncertain of his next steps. As he bid farewell to his past life, he pondered the myriad paths ahead of him - from hunting gold to becoming a fur-trader or a farmer. Despite the uncertainty, Tom knew he couldn't be idle. He knelt in prayer, committing his future to God, under the setting sun's warm glow. That night, as he slumbered, the robber-chief's sudden intrusion jolted him awake. Despite his weakened state, Tom faced the danger with a defiant spirit, which was met with a swift intervention by a backwoodsman and his companions, averting a potentially deadly confrontation.|"['1.

The trapper coughed violently, preventing him from finishing his sentence about trapping the scoundrels. Tom and Drake were kept apart in the camp, but in a brief moment, Drake whispered a signal to Tom. Drake's suppressed cough hinted at his illness. Unaco, a skilled Indian, heard Drake's cough and stealthily approached the camp. The sentinels were white men and failed to detect Unaco's movements. Drake's cough stopped, making it hard for Unaco to locate him. When Drake coughed again, a sentinel got agitated. Drake subtly freed himself and then freed Tom, instructing him to be ready to run.

He lost his temper completely and attacked me aggressively. Fortunately, there were no weapons around, only a clasp-knife in my pocket. We engaged in a fistfight, causing chaos in the room, breaking furniture, and almost smashing the skylight.

Paddy Flinders emerged from the bushes, agreeing with the speaker's desire for gold found in the valley. The man revealed his successful gold discovery and intention to join a search party led by Muster Gashford. Despite the gold's allure, he mentioned a debt owed to friends and the need to keep working for it. Flinders welcomed the man's decision and hinted at meeting another friend, Muster Fred. Later, it was revealed that Betty's refined demeanor came from her mother, not her rough father. Initially opposed to Tom's proposals, Betty agreed after her brother expressed his wish for her marriage before his passing. Mahoghany Drake suggested a quick trip to a fur-trader post where a missionary could marry them.
