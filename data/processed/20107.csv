Copenhagen's climate is pleasant in summer but harsh in winter, according to Andersen. The battle between the north-east wind and the sun results in winter being dominated by the wind and mud, while summer is ruled by sunshine, easing the winter's hardships. The city's many waterways, like Nyhavn, offer a refreshing escape during hot days. Here, the fish market is unique; fish are bought alive from the fishing smacks lining the quay. The Amager flower market is a colorful sight, where Amager women sell their blooms in traditional attire. Known for their storytelling and quick wit, the Amager women are a lively presence in the market square.

Sundays in Copenhagen are a time for leisure and pleasure. The State supports this by offering cheap transportation and affordable entertainment at theaters and other venues. Even those with modest means can partake in these simple joys, as families head out for picnics and strolls. Many homes lack proper ventilation, making the fresh air a welcome change.

"Hans Christian Andersen, a beloved Danish author, is most famous for his ""Fairy Tales."" Despite his success in novels, dramas, and poems, Andersen remained humble and adored by many.

"Nikolai Frederik Grundtvig, the founder of popular high-schools for peasants, was born at his father's parsonage in South Seeland. He attended school in Jutland and developed a love for his native moors. While at the Latin School in Aarhus, he befriended an old shoemaker who shared tales of Norse heroes and Danish folk-songs. Grundtvig, a true Dane and descendant of vikings, became deeply interested in his heritage. Studying at the University of Copenhagen, he focused on Icelandic, English for Shakespeare, and German for Goethe. Grundtvig's patriotic nature shone through his poetry, which celebrated Denmark and its people. His folk-songs are still enjoyed at festivals today. He established high-schools that produced skilled peasant farmers, and his influence led to the creation of the ""Grundtvigianere"" sect.

The Danes, like many Scandinavians, are known for their passion for dancing. Recently, they have brought back the beautiful traditional folk dances to preserve the ancient costumes, dances, and songs. A group of patriotic Danes, known as the folk-dancers, are working to revive these cultural treasures. These dancers aim to reignite the love for Denmark's heritage by showcasing dances and folk songs that were once cherished by their ancestors. The traditional Danish peasant costumes have mostly vanished, but the folk-dancers wear replicas to represent their regions. The dances often involve singing, with some comical and others depicting local industries. The Faroe Islands still follow the old ways, with dances accompanied only by voices and clapping.

"In Denmark, it is a tradition to say ""Grace"" after meals. When a Danish lady visited England for the first time, she surprised her English host by simply saying ""Grace"" after meals. This led to some confusion until the Danish guest explained the misunderstanding and joined in the laughter. Danish breakfast includes coffee, fresh rolls, and a unique dish called ""öllebröd,"" made of rye-bread, beer, milk, cream, and sometimes an egg. For lunch, they have ""Smörrebröd,"" an open-faced sandwich with various toppings like sausage, ham, or cheese. Danish dinners are hearty with soup, meat, pudding, and coffee.

Fredericia, a significant town, plays a vital role in Denmark's transport system.

Fredericia is also known for its historic city walls, offering a scenic view of the Little Belt. Vejle, another picturesque town, boasts the beautiful Vejlefjord and the enchanting Munkebjerg Forest, a favorite spot for Danish romantics.

"Our journey to Silkeborg takes us through the vast heathland, ""Alhede."" The Danes have admirably cultivated these barren lands with the help of convicts who plant and prepare the soil for farming. These workers wear caps with visor-like masks for protection from the cold winds and to maintain privacy. The heath, though seemingly monotonous, holds a melancholic charm and beauty, especially when the heather blooms, providing a purple carpet for children to enjoy. Peat stacks drying in the sun indicate the primary fuel source for the moor-folk. A paddle-boat or motor-boat can transport us across the lake to Himmelbjerget. The surrounding landscape is peaceful and picturesque, with beech-woods and garden-rooms in Danish gardens. Steen Steensen Blicher, the poet of Jutland, beautifully depicted this scenery in his lyrical poems. Herning houses an interesting museum showcasing the needlework and traditional attire of the moor-dwellers, reflecting their thriftiness and craftsmanship."|['1.

"As we travel through Skjern and down the west coast to Esbjerg, the final stop of our journey, we observe the charming appearance of the field-workers. An elderly shepherd, dressed in a bright blue shirt and sleeveless brown coat, with long white hair flowing over his shoulders, watches over his small flock of sheep. This wise man multitasks, tending to his sheep, smoking his pipe, and knitting a stocking all at once. The Danes excel at knitting, with both men and women displaying great skill. In the fields, many girls in colorful attire add vibrant splashes to the scenery. Occasionally, a bullock-cart laden with clattering milk-cans slowly crosses the field-road. We pass thriving farmsteads adorned with storks' nests on the roofs. The father-stork, standing on one leg, protects his young, gazing thoughtfully over the moors, perhaps contemplating the changing landscape of Jutland. In Copenhagen, a common question upon arrival is, ""Have you visited Tivoli?"" If not, a Danish friend will take you to these enchanting pleasure-gardens.

The Danish farmer values education, influenced by Grundtvig High-schools established by Bishop Grundtvig for yeomen's children. During winter, when farm work halts, the farmer and family attend to learn modern farming and dairy techniques. The farmer's children actively participate in farm work, cultivating a love for it. Butter-making is a fascinating process in well-equipped steam-factories, renowned for Danish butter's quality. The Hedeselskabet society, founded in 1866, reclaimed barren lands, converting them into fertile areas through tree planting and other improvements. Danish boys undergo military or naval training at twenty to defend their country. The daily parade of the Life Guards at the royal palace showcases a splendid military display, enjoyed by the King and the crowd.

In the Schleswig-Holstein War of 1864, the Danish soldiers showed bravery in a tough battle. The Danish soldiers were honored by the Schleswigers with a unique tribute. The graves were decorated with white flowers in the shape of the Danish flag, Danebrog, made of red geraniums. Holmens Kirke in Copenhagen is a church where many Danish heroes are buried. The church was originally a foundry converted by King Christian IV for dockyard workers. Denmark, being surrounded by sea, needs a strong navy for protection. Young boys interested in the navy join as apprentices at fourteen, then train for two years at the Naval Academy. The Academy has a rich history of producing skilled officers. Naval cadets sometimes face discipline, like wearing a red bob on their caps for misbehavior. Denmark's naval history includes heroes like Peder Tordenskjold, known for his clever tactics in battles.|"['1.
