The pretty Spanish girl held a unique position, more of a companion than a servant. Rest and good food had enhanced her beauty, impressing Jack and Walter. Inez's joy at returning to her island and helping her father overshadowed any romantic feelings towards the boys. As preparations for their voyage progressed, Inez spotted a fat man boarding, causing her to hide in fear. Cora, always dutiful, inquired about the man, suspecting a threat to Mr. Ralcanto. With the ship ready to depart, the commotion of passengers and freight signaled the start of their journey. The gang-plank was drawn in, sealing their departure as the steamer prepared to sail.|"['1.

The ship slowly left the harbor for Porto Rico as the mooring ropes were cast off. Passengers watched the scenes from the deck, including a mysterious fat man named Miguel Ramo. Cora, along with Inez, noticed the man's scrutinizing gaze. Captain Watson revealed that Miguel was a wealthy coffee merchant with a history of involvement in Venezuelan politics. Despite Inez's initial fear, Cora reassured her, emphasizing their safety under Mr. Robinson's protection. The group, including Inez, observed the surroundings as the ship sailed smoothly through the bay.

The pilot was abandoned, and then the actual journey of approximately fifteen hundred miles to San Juan began. It was meant to be uneventful, so we won't focus on it, except to mention that Mr. Robinson closely monitored Senor Ramo but found no link to the father of Inez's imprisonment. The weather had been cold upon leaving New York, but the warm winds of the south soon brought relief, prompting a change to lighter clothing. Mr. Robinson, knowledgeable about Cuba, assisted with clothing choices. Upon reaching the southern limits, the group changed to linen attire suitable for the climate. The ship anchored in San Juan Bay, where small boats awaited to transport passengers and baggage. The group admired the beautiful blue waters and the scenic city ahead, with mountains in the distance. Inez, thrilled to be closer to her homeland, shed tears of joy.|"['1.

The boatman was upset about his failed trick until Mr. Robinson, an experienced traveler, gave him a coin. This made up for the disappointment, and the man thanked him in Spanish. Inez advised her friends on ordering drinks in Spanish, suggesting coconut milk. The travelers were split into two carriages with their luggage in a wagon. As they explored the city, they saw a mix of white and black residents. The rooms were comfortable, though the kitchen smelled of onion and garlic. Mr. Robinson left to meet business associates, promising an afternoon drive. They visited a statue of Columbus and the old fort of San Juan. The group's rooms were close together, and Cora heard Belle calling for help. Jack and Cora found Belle's slipper and papers in the room.|"['1.

Jack threw away the centipede he had killed and searched for more among the waste paper. He stood with his bare foot raised, ready to protect himself from the unpleasant insect bites common in Porto Rico. Bess and Belle insisted on keeping their lights on to ward off any more unwanted visitors. Jack assured his sister he was nearby before returning to his room. The hotel clerk explained that the presence of centipedes was due to the rooms not being used recently. The group explored San Juan and enjoyed the local cuisine, adapting to the new environment. Mr. Robinson planned to rescue Inez's father while dealing with business on Guadeloupe. A sudden storm hit, alarming the motor girls as they watched the wind and rain intensify.|"[""1.

Jack reassured everyone that the steamer and its crew would be okay in the storm since they were likely prepared for such weather in the West Indies. Despite Jack's words, the girls and Walter grew more anxious as the storm persisted. Inez, with her experience in the region, was asked if this storm was the worst she had seen. The storm, though called a hurricane, behaved differently from typical hurricanes, with erratic gusts and intermittent rain showers. The group, worried for their loved ones aboard the Ramona, awaited news anxiously. The hotel clerk mentioned the ship could have sought shelter on any of the nearby islands, making it hard to locate them.

The boys were genuinely alarmed as reports of danger and damage to shipping reached the hotel. Large steamers were rumored to have gone on the reefs that abounded in the region. The Ramona had not been sighted since leaving San Juan. The sea wall offered a view of foaming waters and a sunken reef where waves beat furiously. The girls, clinging together against the blast, peered through the mist. Bess mended a silk stocking, admired by Belle, who marveled at Inez's lace patterns. Inez explained that Spanish ladies often forgo stockings unless attending church or a dance. As the storm cleared, the group enjoyed cocoanut milk at a refreshment booth near the fort, where they spotted flags signaling the approach of a steamer.|['1.

They walked back to the marina, the town's business area by the water. They saw the motor launches preparing for the first steamer arriving since the storm. Despite wanting news about the Ramona, the girls went for a nap due to the hot weather. Jack and Walter went to the marina for updates. Cora, Bess, Belle, and Inez, feeling better, came down later for a walk. A band concert was planned in the park. Senor Ramo greeted them, mistaking their names.

There were two other cabins on the boat, each with folding berths. Jack and Walter got the smaller cabin, while the girls took the larger one. They had plenty of lockers to store food and other items. They needed a lot of gasoline for the trip, but they could buy more on some nearby islands. Jack's sister mentioned that she wouldn't want to start the heavy flywheel too often. The plan was to sail around the eastern end of the island, between Porto Rico and Vieques, heading towards the Caribbean. St. Croix was their first stop, though they didn't expect much news from there. Cora suggested the boys go fishing to supplement their canned food. As they were preparing to fish, a shark suddenly appeared, surprising everyone. They shared some light-hearted moments, which lifted the tension they had been feeling. The group enjoyed a good meal prepared by the motor girls, who were experienced in cooking from their camping trips. Joe had his meal later as he needed to steer the boat. Despite the challenges, they tried to stay hopeful, especially when thinking about their missing loved ones.|"['1.

The group embarked on a journey from San Juan harbor to St. Croix, a Danish island, covering over a hundred miles at a speed of ten miles per hour to conserve gasoline. As dusk fell over Christianstad harbor, the Tartar anchored near the shore after navigating a tricky channel. Despite the small rowboat's limited capacity, a launch from the wharf helped transport them safely. Upon arrival, the travelers explored the picturesque town, noticing the mix of white sugar planters and black laborers. Despite their curiosity, no news of the wrecked Ramona crew surfaced, leading to a sense of initial disappointment.

"They finished their small snack and were among the few guests at the hotel. They explored the town under the lamplight. The shops had interesting items, but the girls weren't in the mood for shopping. ""This place feels cozy,"" Belle remarked as they entered the Tartar. The cabin was lit by incandescent lights powered by a storage battery. Jack and Walter checked the anchor rope as a precaution. They decided not to keep a watch since the harbor was safe. Everyone went to bed by eleven. The night was solemn aboard the Tartar. Jack fell ill, and Cora took care of him. The group planned to leave early the next day to search for the refugees but had to stay back as Jack was unwell. With the help of sea breezes and care from his friends, Jack started to recover.

They sailed around the Danish island, stopping at bays and inlets where shipwrecked refugees might have landed. Despite finding no traces, they decided to head to St. Kitts, stopping at small islands along the way. They cruised back and forth, hoping to find uncharted islands or coral reefs that could be a refuge. Near St. Kitts, sailors from the Ramona were rescued, sharing stories of a hurricane and mutiny. They expected news in Basseterre, the capital, as it was likely the ship had been torn apart nearby. They spent a week searching small islands, using a water glass to see underwater wonders like waving coral and sponge formations. The beauty of the ocean was overshadowed by their heavy hearts, except for Inez, who found the sights familiar from her childhood.|"['1.

Despite her worry about her father's well-being, she refrained from imposing her wishes on her friends. Rarely did she mention her dream of journeying to Sea Horse Island, either to aid in her father's rescue or to glean any news about him for others to help set him free. Upon reaching Basseterre, they verified the account of two shipwrecked sailors being rescued. Further inquiries in Old Road and Sandy Point yielded no additional information. As they were about to depart, an elderly man approached them at the dock one evening. Initially mistaken for a beggar, the man shared a peculiar tale about a wild man on the island.

Excitedly, they peered at the shore, yet no human was in sight. The small island sat lonely in the vast blue sea, bathed in golden shadows by the setting sun. After dinner aboard the ship, the search party chatted about the unusual events. Meanwhile, Jim and Joe worked on fixing the engine. They planned to explore the island at dawn to find the missing sailor. The night was calm, though eerie noises came from the island. In the morning, they discovered him in the trees, eating in a primitive manner. As they set out on their search, a noise startled the sailor, who cautiously faced the group. Slowly, he approached, fearing they might vanish like a dream. With a plea, he expressed his refusal to return to the ship, fearing he'd be forced to be a pirate.|['1.

The tale recounted by Ben Wrensch, the sailor, cannot be faithfully transcribed due to its lack of chronological order and frequent interruptions. Ben was haunted by the fear of waking up alone, begging not to be abandoned like the others. A hurricane struck the ship, causing chaos and mutiny among the crew. Ben, a man of character, refused to join the mutineers and was cast adrift in a lifeboat. He endured the storm, surviving on mussels, turtle eggs, and bird meat.

During his time on the island, his main concern was being rescued. He tried to signal passing fishermen but scared them off with his odd behavior. Eventually, a boat approached, but he unknowingly drove them away by throwing his cap. Jack and the others were curious about the Ramona's fate and the mutineers' plans. Bess felt hopeful that their loved ones were safe. Ben was rescued from Lonely Island and decided not to join the group on their cruise. He needed medical attention and couldn't provide more information about the Ramona. As a passenger, he would be of little help.

Lieutenant Walling assured her they were after the ship Ramona, but an accident had halted their pursuit.

Lieutenant Walling was bombarded with questions from the young people aboard the Ramona. He calmly requested them to ask one at a time while explaining the situation. The passengers were stranded on Double Island a week ago, except for the parents of Cora and the twins who were rescued by small boats when the ship was in distress. The lieutenant assured them that a rescue mission would be organized. Inez, who had been discussing matters with Senor Ramo, entered the cabin excitedly holding a package of documents. It was revealed that Senor Ramo was involved in smuggling and mutiny on the Ramona. He had stolen important papers from Inez to hinder her from freeing a political prisoner. Ramo's plan was to keep Inez's father captive to further his illegal activities, but his schemes were foiled.
