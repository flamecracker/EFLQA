The eagle is known as the king of birds, just like the lion is the king of beasts. However, besides being larger, stronger, and faster than other birds, there isn't much reason for this title. It's a mistake to attribute noble or mean qualities to animals since they can only do what they are created to do. The Golden Eagle, the most powerful among eagles, builds its nest in rocky mountain clefts. Eagles are attentive parents, feeding their young until they can fend for themselves. Zebras, like Mrs. Zebra and her baby, have distinct stripes all over their bodies. Zebras are wild and left to roam freely in large plains. The American black bear is depicted as lively and inviting. The female bear is a caring mother, showing affection and protecting her cubs. The Little Owl is a useful bird that helps control pests. The European Bison is fascinating, and efforts have been made to domesticate the American Bison.|['1.

Herbert Joyce marveled at the peculiar drawings his cousin brought from Australia, depicting a kangaroo with what seemed like three heads. His cousin clarified that the smaller heads belonged to the kangaroo's joeys, carried in a pouch until they could walk. These joeys appeared content, nibbling grass as their mother moved along. Sea lions, despite their size and strength, are gentle creatures. They are seen playing innocently, even sitting on chairs with their flippers. The sea lion, scientifically known as Otary, can be tamed and become friendly in captivity. At the zoo, visitors witness the struggles of wild animals adapting to an unnatural environment. A mother badger, exhausted from caring for her cubs, seeks refuge but remains ready to defend her young. The intricate nests of birds like the Bullfinch and Chaffinch are cleverly constructed with materials like moss, cotton, and silken threads to blend into their surroundings and provide security. Chamois, nimble mountain-dwellers, gracefully navigate treacherous terrains, unfazed by storms and avalanches, showcasing their agility and resilience in their natural habitat.|"[""1.

"Jacko, a Macaw with vibrant feathers of scarlet, yellow, and blue, is a talkative bird. He greets with ""Come along, Jacko,"" then playfully pecks when you approach. In good spirits, he'll say ""Poor, poor!"" as he chats to himself all morning. Jacko mimics sounds like coughs, sneezes, crows, and cackles in a comical way. If sparrows find crumbs, Jacko swoops in, claiming the meal with a grand display of wings. He even steals bones from poor Pussy, causing her to retreat with a hiss. Farmers and gardeners learn that birds play a vital role in nature, balancing ecosystems by controlling pests. The rook helps by eating grubs, benefiting farmers. The clever cow, skilled at opening gates, even learned to pump water from a trough using her horns. Carrier pigeons, prized for their homing instincts, have been crucial in delivering messages swiftly. The Siasin antelope, known for its spectacular ringed horns and impressive leaps, roams the vast plains of India."|['1.

The lynx, with its beautifully spotted body, is known for its keen sight, especially at night. Lynx-eyed individuals are those with exceptional vision. Like all cats, the lynx uses its mustache for feeling, hearing, and sight. Lynx are skilled hunters, capable of leaping great distances. They often hunt timid hares but can make missteps. Lynx are found in Canada and the northern U.S., where they build dams with wood, stones, and mud. They are known for their engineering skills and gather food for winter. Beavers, too, are industrious animals. They construct dams and homes with great skill, using materials they collect themselves. Their skins are valuable, and their flesh is enjoyed by hunters. The lioness, smaller and more graceful than the lion, gives birth to blind cubs that mew like kittens. As they grow, they lose their stripes and spots. Lionesses are fierce protectors of their young, and lions are most dangerous when defending their family.|['1.

"The first fish I ever saw in an aquarium, twenty years ago, was a ""Jack,"" as he is called when young, or a ""Pike,"" when he grows older; and ever since then I have contrived to have a pet one, and this, drawn from life by Mr. Harrison Weir, is an accurate portrait of the one I now possess in the Crystal Palace Aquarium. There he is, just as he steals round the corner of a bit of rock. He is glaring at a minnow, at which he is taking most accurate aim; he hardly seems to move, but yet he does by a very trifling motion of the edge of his back fin--sometimes resting a little on the tips of his two foremost fins, as they touch the ground, carefully calculating his distance; and then, at the very moment when the minnow has got into a position which leaves a space of clear water in front, so that Mr. Jack shall not hurt his nose against any hard substance when he gets carried on by the violence of his rush, he darts at the minnow with the speed of Shakespeare's Puck."|"['1.

The pig, a grateful and intelligent animal, can be taught tricks and is often a star attraction at country fairs. In London, pigs follow their masters like loyal dogs even into busy public places. Pigs can even perform coordinated tasks, like ringing bells in unison with almost human-like precision. Guinea pigs, native to South America, are known for their colorful coats and meticulous grooming habits. They feed on a variety of foods and are excellent parents, grooming their young and keeping them clean. The Argus bird, found in Java and Sumatra, boasts magnificent plumage with eye-like spots on its feathers. Monkeys, like the wise walnut-cracking monkey, learn from experience that labor often comes before reward. Foxes, like the clever fox on the Tweed river, use cunning tactics to catch their prey. Elephants, with their vast herds and powerful leaders, rely on their incredible trunks with thousands of muscles for survival.|['1.

"In Arundel, there is a clever retriever named ""Shock"" who shows good manners and intelligence to other animals. He gently carries the stable cat in his mouth and tries to carry the kitten, although the kitten prefers to walk. When Sanger's elephant got stuck in the river, Shock was sent to help and succeeded. Shock even helps carry umbrellas to the station and then asks for a reward, which he exchanges for a biscuit at the nearest shop. Timothy, a hedgehog, was a helpful garden companion until a dog attacked him. Similarly, Charles Durand's cockatoo, Billy, saved his owner from a deadly snake by alerting him.

The wind is getting cooler, and the flowers are losing their scent, but look at the grapes growing, shining in purple and gold. Let's enjoy the company, music, and laughter, undisturbed by Winter's approach, as Autumn still brings joy. Autumn offers the best with grapes and harvested corn, storing treasures for the future. The birds in the picture with long beaks live in marshes to find worms easily in the soft soil. Birds' beaks show how well they are adapted to their lifestyles; eagles have strong, short bills for tearing flesh, while canaries crack seeds. People often underestimate the pain caused when stealing birds' young. A sheep on a California ship helps lead flocks safely on board. Jack, a bear, was caught and brought to the Crystal Palace, growing in size and playfulness.|"[""1. What is the main focus of the passage?\nA. The changing weather in Autumn\nB.

"The woodcock, a bird known for its peculiar habits, has a fascinating way of protecting its young. Witnesses have reported that when the young woodcocks are unable to fly, the mother bird carries them to safety. This behavior has been documented by various sources, including L. Lloyd in ""Scandinavian Adventures"" and the Stuart brothers in ""Lays of the Deer Forest."" Similarly, larks are known for their joyous flights high into the sky, singing gleefully as they soar. These birds show remarkable intelligence and adaptability, as seen when a lark rebuilt its nest after part of it was accidentally cut off by a mower. In another instance, a seal found companionship with a family in Norway after being rescued as a pup. This seal displayed loyalty and intelligence, even assisting the fisherman in catching fish. The sheepdog, a shepherd's trusted companion, is celebrated for its intelligence and loyalty. Anecdotes abound of the sheepdog's quick thinking and devotion to its human companions.

Squirrel hung his head sadly, reminiscing about his lost freedom in the woods, now trapped by a wicked man. He longed for the forest's embrace and warned a child to greet the woodland creatures for him. The Otter, a water-weasel, gracefully swims and dives to catch fish, sometimes scaring them onto land. The mastiff, a loyal guardian, is gentle but vigilant, requiring trust and respect. Birds show remarkable instinct in feeding boxes, outsmarting vermin. The Plesiosaurus, a peculiar reptile, had a lizard-like head, crocodile teeth, and a serpent-like neck. In Switzerland, herdsmen and shepherds tend to the sheep and goats on mountain pastures. Driving animals through town streets can be distressing for them. Sheep and goats provide food, clothing, and warmth for humans.|['1.

One day, as I strolled through a meadow near a village, I witnessed a brave act by a terrier dog chasing a partridge. The partridge valiantly defended itself, rolling over, running, and confronting the dog to protect its young. It was heartwarming to see the old bird shielding its offspring from harm. This incident reminds us of the courage even the most timid creatures display when their young are in danger. Observing nature's creatures can teach us valuable lessons. For instance, Mr. and Mrs. Kingfisher, with their beautiful green and blue wings, were proud parents of equally stunning young Kingfishers. These birds built their nest near a stream, where they raised their chicks with care. Rats, known for their ingenuity, have been seen transporting eggs up staircases to their nests. Additionally, a peaceful creature by the river, resembling a rat but with a shorter, hair-covered tail, enjoyed a peaceful meal. The heron, when threatened by predators, rises into the sky to escape and feeds on fish and frogs near rivers and lakes. Lastly, a loyal horse protected its sleeping master after he fell from his saddle, ensuring his safety until he woke up.|['1.
