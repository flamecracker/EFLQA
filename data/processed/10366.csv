"The Publishers are thankful to the ""Young India"" Editor and Publisher for permitting the use of Mahatma Gandhi's articles. They also appreciate Mr. C. Rajagopalachar for his valuable help. Post the great war, most nations are not content. However, a positive outcome is that all countries, except India, are either free or aspiring to be. The new constitution in India doesn't include the military forces under the people's control, resulting in funds being used against the nation's wishes. The constitution restricts social reforms without added taxes, burdening the poor. Fundamental liberties like press and association are under bureaucratic rule, maintaining laws that empower the Executive Government excessively. The administration's cruelty and crimes go unpunished, perpetuating despotism and political servitude. Understanding the harm to Islam and Mussalmans in India is crucial. The Khalifa's role in defending Islam and the significance of Jazirat-ul-Arab for Muslims are highlighted."|"['1.

The Indian Muslims feel that a government claiming to promote peace and happiness among them should not disregard their religious beliefs. As per the Peace Treaty in Constantinople, the Khalifa lacks the power to safeguard Islam and is essentially a captive in his own city. His authority is limited, and his capital is isolated by foreign military control. The sacred sites of Islam are now under different jurisdictions, some under non-Muslim states. The unity of religions is vital, and India's mission is to foster understanding and unity among all faiths. Hindus supporting Islam against Western greed can lead to a victory for both Islam and Christianity. The Khilafat has united Hindus and Muslims, solving internal and external challenges, paving the way for a strong and peaceful nation.|"['1.

Every nation, much like each individual, is entitled to freedom. Absolute freedom is the inherent right of all peoples. The only restrictions that exist are those which a people impose upon themselves. The connection with Britain is valuable as a defense against any worse force imposed through violence. However, it is merely a means to an end, not a mandate of fate. An alliance born of mutual suffering for noble causes is a more natural and lasting bond than one rooted in greed and weakness. Violence or total surrender are not the only options when freedom and justice are denied. Violence may remove foreign rulers but will enslave from within. True freedom arises when producers, not destroyers, are in charge. Mahatma Gandhi proposed non-cooperation as a peaceful alternative to violence or surrender. Ultimately, the withdrawal of cooperation is the most effective means to bend oppressive forces.|['1.

Non-co-operation is a powerful method that some oppose due to fears of anarchy. They worry that by refusing to work with the government, chaos will ensue. This objection arises from a lack of understanding of human nature. It assumes that the British would rather let go of India than address the injustices. However, it is unlikely that the British would risk losing India over non-co-operation. The fear of anarchy is unfounded, as non-co-operation can lead to true order and self-government. Some also fear being defenseless against foreign aggression if the British leave. But if we show self-respect, patriotism, and unity, no foreign power would dare attack us. Non-co-operation is not just negative; it fosters unity and cooperation among ourselves. It allows us to rediscover the lost art of working together and promotes national unity. Through non-co-operation, we can regain self-reliance, learn communal duties, and build true national cooperation.|['1.

Freedom is a precious thing that a nation must strive for through effort, sacrifice, and purification. True liberty is not merely a change in government but a deeply ingrained part of a nation's soul. It cannot be handed out by a tyrant or won by chance. The people of India are engaged in a war for true and lasting liberty, using the powerful weapons of self-purification and self-strengthening. Every citizen, especially the youth, must contribute to this battle without expecting personal gain. Cooperation with foreign governments perpetuates slavery, but by boycotting government services and controlled schools, a peaceful transition to freedom is possible. Education is vital for preparing the next generation to continue the fight for liberty. It is important to understand and support the principles of justice and humanity in this struggle for freedom.|['1.

My moral responsibility drives me to support the Khilafat cause and stand with the Muslim community. This alliance between Hindus and Muslims is not to undermine England or the Allied Powers but to uphold my beliefs and resist injustice. I refuse to partake in broken promises regarding the Khilafat issue. The Indian Muslims have a just cause supported by scriptural authority, and it is essential for Hindus to stand in solidarity. The Turkish treaty, set to be released on May 10th, internationalizes the Straits and imposes Allied control over Gallipoli and Constantinople. The San Remo Conference assigns Britain mandates over Mesopotamia and Palestine and France over Syria. However, the terms of the treaty challenge Muslim demands by restricting Turkish sovereignty to the Chatalja lines, potentially violating promises made by the British Premier.|['1.

The Supreme Council's decisions regarding the lands of Asia Minor remain a mystery. Mr. Lloyd George's suggestion of a shared control over these lands might be accepted by the Allies. The handling of Smyrna's fate, while attempting to please all involved parties, is not likely to satisfy anyone. Mr. Lloyd George's observation that most people in the region prefer Greek over Turkish rule has been noted but will not be acted upon for five years. The mandate division among the Allies has caused discontent among the Arab delegation, who feel their desire for independence has been ignored. The terms of the Turkish treaty have raised concerns, with accusations of breaching promises and disregarding self-determination principles. The comparison of the Caliphate with the Papacy by statesmen at San Remo has led to misunderstandings. Mr. Mahomed Ali highlighted the distinction between the Caliphate and the Papacy at the Essex Hall meeting, emphasizing the supernational nature of Islam and the role of the Khalifa as the Defender of the faith.|"[""1.

The British Empire is a diverse land, embracing Christian, Hindu, and Muslim faiths. The recent decisions regarding the Khilafat question have caused unrest among Muslims. The Peace Conference at San Remo dismissed Mr. Mahomed Ali's deputation, leading to a settlement that is seen as unjust. The Viceroy's response, while courteous, falls short of addressing Muslim sentiments. Muslims demand the preservation of the Khilafat with guarantees for non-Muslims under Turkish rule and Arab self-rule in Arabia. The Viceregal reply, advocating punishment for Turkey, goes against the promises made to Muslims during the war. It is crucial for British ministers to rectify any mistakes and secure a settlement that upholds justice and satisfies Muslim sentiment.|"[""1.

In a recent letter, an Englishman expressed concerns about Mr. Gandhi's involvement in the Kailafat issue. The Indian Mahomedans argue that Turkish rule over Arabia is essential to their religion, but facing opposition from the Arabs themselves, this claim seems flawed. The writer questions who truly represents Islam if the Arabs do not support this demand. He compares this situation to German Roman Catholics making demands against Rome. The writer emphasizes that imposing Turkish rule on Arabs goes against principles of self-determination and would betray promises made during the war. While the Indian Mahomedans may desire Turkish rule in Syria or Arabia, it seems improbable. The writer underscores that English Liberal and Humanitarian opinions prioritize self-determination, making it unlikely for England to support such a demand.|"[""1.

The writer of the letter mentioned has presented a strong argument based on false information. He argues that Indian Muslims are seeking Turkish rule in Arabia against the wishes of the Arabs, which is not true. In reality, Indian Muslims are only asking for Turkish suzerainty over Arabia to ensure Arab self-rule and protect the Holy Places of Islam. The writer emphasizes the importance of upholding justice and religious sentiment. He rejects the idea of blindly following fanatical religious beliefs and dishonest pledges. The writer also addresses criticisms about supporting the Turkish claim, highlighting the need for substantial support to achieve justice.

From a religious perspective, the seventh objection is of little significance. Even if people don't respond to non-co-operation, it shouldn't deter reformers from trying. It would show that hopefulness isn't based on inner strength or knowledge but on ignorance and superstition. Non-co-operation, if earnestly embraced, could halt all other activities, including reforms, without reversing progress. It's a potent tool that, if used sincerely, can lead to great discipline, self-control, unity, non-violence, and organization, making a nation truly great. While some may see non-co-operation as a weapon of the weak, I believe it's a duty and a means of seeking justice without violence. I hold high regard for the British constitution and English character, and I don't view anyone as an enemy. I extend the same sentiments to Muslims, though our approaches may differ. Collaborating with them and inviting them to try my method, even with differing motives, can still yield positive outcomes.|['1.

The passage discusses the implications of the proposed changes in the Turkish Empire and its influence on regions like Armenia, Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. It questions whether the removal of Turkish influence and the introduction of European-Christian mandates would be just or if it's a display of brute strength by certain powers. Concerns are raised about the impact on the Moslem communities in these regions and the potential exploitation by capitalist interests under the guise of mandatory powers. The importance of upholding promises and pledges, especially regarding the self-government of these regions while retaining suzerainty with Turkey, is emphasized. The passage also highlights the need for fair treatment and justice in international relations, particularly in the context of historical events and alliances.|['1.

As someone who has gained some of your Excellency's trust and claims to be a loyal supporter of the British Empire, I feel compelled to clarify my involvement in the Khilafat matter. Even during the early stages of the war, while organizing the Indian Volunteer Ambulance Corps in London, I became interested in the Khilafat issue. Witnessing the deep concern among Muslims in London when Turkey aligned with Germany, I found the same anxiety in India upon my return in January 1915. The leaked Secret Treaties intensified their distrust of British intentions. Despite this, I urged my Muslim friends to express their fears and hopes in a disciplined manner. The recent peace terms and your defense of them have deeply unsettled Indian Muslims. They feel betrayed by the violation of ministerial promises and disregard of Muslim sentiments. As a devoted Hindu, I stand by my Muslim compatriots in their time of need. Their cause, in my view, is just. They seek justice for Turkey's actions. The consistent behavior of Muslims in India over the past five years showcases their restraint. The current situation has eroded faith in British justice and honor among both Hindus and Muslims. My loyalty to the Empire compels me to resist the injustice inflicted upon Muslim sentiments. I believe in the superiority of the British constitution and hope that justice will prevail through our capacity to endure. I have advised my Muslim friends to withdraw support from your Excellency's Government and urged Hindus to join them if the peace terms are not|"[""1.

I acknowledge that engaging in non-cooperation involves significant risks, especially in the current crisis faced by the Muslims in India. However, in such critical times, taking no risks may lead to even greater dangers or the breakdown of law and order. The alternative to non-cooperation is for Your Excellency to lead the agitation, as requested by the Muslim representation. If this is not feasible and non-cooperation becomes necessary, I hope that credit will be given to those following my advice for acting out of a strong sense of duty. The recent speech by Mr. Lloyd George, the Prime Minister, is disappointing as he now advocates for punishing Turkey despite earlier promises. His stance on self-determination and territorial deprivation for Turkey is concerning, especially in light of conflicting census data regarding Thrace. The Prime Minister's approach to the Khilafat issue and the Turkish question raises doubts about British integrity and the need for fair treatment. England faces a crucial decision between mandates over Turkish territories or winning the hearts of Muslims to uphold Britain's honor. The Prime Minister's current course reflects a concerning shift in British diplomacy.|"['1.

The Muslims are getting ready for a tough fight. They face challenges, but not as tough as what the prophet faced. The prophet risked his life many times but had unshakable faith in God. He moved forward with a light heart, trusting in God and truth. If his followers have even half of his faith and spirit, they can overcome the odds. The Allies' greed is backfiring. France and Greece struggle with their gains, and England faces difficulties in Mesopotamia. The Arabs dislike Indian soldiers in Mesopotamia. It's vital to think for ourselves and not support injustice. Non-cooperation is a powerful tool that can be used wisely. We must not seek employment in Mesopotamia unless it's necessary for our livelihood. We should stand against injustice and not be lured by titles or rewards. Non-cooperation can be a peaceful and effective way to resist unjust actions.|"[""1.

My advisors constantly remind me that even if the Turkish peace terms are changed, it won't be because of non-cooperation. I suggest that non-cooperation has a higher purpose than just revising terms. If I can't force a revision, I must stop supporting a government involved in usurpation. By pushing non-cooperation to the limit, I make the Government choose between India and usurpation. I trust England to replace ministers and create fair terms with an awakened India. Critics doubt India's strength for sacrifice, but we can evolve and inspire the nation. The Khilafat representation and my letter were criticized by the Anglo-Indian press. The Times of India objected to the idea of the Viceroy resigning if terms aren't revised. The signatories argue that the British Empire should respect Indian Muslim sentiment toward Turkey. Germany and Austria weren't treated as harshly as Turkey. Turkey was cautious about joining the Allies due to Russia. Turkey's bad choice led to punishment, but humiliating her now disregards Indian Muslim sentiment. Britain must avoid harming Turkey to keep the loyalty of awakened Indian Muslims.|"['1.

Mr. Andrews, a devoted writer for the 'Bombay Chronicle,' passionately supports the Khilafat movement, shedding light on the unjust treatment of Turkey by England, France, and Italy. He advocates for a fair examination of claims made by Mr. Mahomed Ali, aligning with the cause's intrinsic justice. The discussion between Mr. Andrews and the author emphasizes the need for Europe's support to revise unfair terms imposed on Turkey. The author rejects religious doctrines conflicting with reason and morality. He argues for the rightful independence of Armenia and Arabia from Turkey, emphasizing the importance of self-determination.

A friend once asked me if my speeches could be considered seditious under the Indian Penal Code. I admitted that I might fall under that category as I openly express disapproval of the government. My goal is to create a sense of discontent among the people towards a government that has lost their trust and respect. I do not differentiate between the British and Indian governments, as both have failed to address injustices. Despite my initial hope for positive change, recent events have shown me the dishonesty and disregard for Indian sentiments by the current government. I no longer hold any affection for such a government and find it distressing to witness ongoing injustices. While the government threatens me with imprisonment for my actions, I believe that my supporters should welcome it as a sign of progress in our non-cooperation movement. It is crucial for them to continue the struggle peacefully even in the face of adversity.|"[""1.

India is a vast land where a small number of educated individuals are aware of the activities of the larger population. While the government and educated citizens may view the Khilafat movement as temporary, many Muslims see it differently. The exodus of Muslims is increasing rapidly, with families leaving for Afghanistan, cheered along their journey. This movement is driven by a deep-rooted faith rather than mere fanaticism. Recent clashes between British military police and Mahajarins highlight the tensions. The incident resulted in the death of a Mahajarin and injuries on both sides. Such events risk escalating tensions and damaging British prestige. It is crucial for the government to handle such situations tactfully to prevent further unrest and ensure the safety of all individuals involved.|['1.

We have a better approach. Instead of resorting to violence, this method demands patience, restraint, and strong determination. It involves refusing to be part of any wrongdoing. History shows that tyrants often rely on terrorism to force compliance. However, there have been cases where terrorism failed to achieve its goals. India faces a decision now. If the actions of the Punjab Government are unjust, and if the reports condone these acts, we must not support such violence. While appealing to Parliament is an option, if that fails, we must show our worth as a nation by withdrawing our cooperation. The actions of certain officials, like Mr. Bosworth Smith, show a pattern of abuse and mistreatment. Despite evidence against him, he has been promoted instead of facing consequences. This raises questions about the integrity of the system and the need for justice.|['1. What does the method mentioned in the text demand?\nA. Violence\nB. Patience, restraint, and determination\nC.

During the final moments in the Viceregal Council, our sense of humiliation reached its peak. Mr. Shustri's resolution on the Punjab was not passed. The Indian victims of Jullianwala were compensated with Rs. 1,250, while English victims of mob violence received much larger sums. The guilty officials were only reprimanded for their crimes against those they were meant to serve, leaving the councillors satisfied. If India were stronger, such insults would not be tolerated. The use of terrorism and deceit is a sign of weakness, not strength. The British lack in numbers, and we lack strength despite our numbers, leading to a cycle of mutual degradation. To break free from this cycle, we must focus on self-improvement through non-co-operation with oppressive systems. By taking control of our education, disputes, and legislative matters, we can pave the way for true self-governance. Swaraj is only achievable when these conditions are met. Embracing Swadeshi, or self-reliance, particularly in the realm of cloth production, is crucial to breaking free from economic enslavement.|['1.

The need for a common language among Indians to express themselves in national gatherings is crucial. The inability of many to understand Hindi, which is likely to be the national language, signifies the depth of our degradation. This emphasizes the importance of the non-cooperation movement to uplift us from this state. The current government has played a role in diminishing our nation, and breaking free from it requires unity and a national language for communication. Non-violent, progressive non-cooperation is advocated as a means to achieve liberation. While non-violence is a creed for some and a policy for others, its value in India's emancipation is undeniable. The history of British rule in India reveals that violence only strengthens our oppressors. Therefore, a peaceful approach is essential for India to regain its sovereignty.|"['1.

What do we owe to Punjab? The whole of India suffered when even a single Punjabi was humiliated in Amritsar. Women across India felt exposed when innocent women in Manianwalla were dishonored. Indian children were shamed when young school kids were made to salute the Union Jack in the Punjab, leading to tragic deaths. It is a moral duty to boycott schools under this Government until it repents for these crimes. We should not seek justice from courts that sentenced innocent men. The women of India have shown deep understanding by supporting non-violent non-cooperation, offering their jewelry for the cause of Swaraj. This strong response gives hope for gaining Swaraj within a year. Students and lawyers must join this movement. Swaraj means full power over finance, police, military, and more. It will prevent injustices like the Khilafat and Punjab incidents from happening again. Swaraj will give India the freedom to choose between good and evil.|"[""1.

The clear evidence of the evil nature of the current system is that even a respected nobleman like Lord Ronaldshay avoids the real issues. Why does he ignore the Punjab and evade the Khilafat? Can mere words heal a patient suffering from a serious illness? It's not the lack of reforms that has caused turmoil in India, but the infliction of injustices and the attempt to make us forget them. A complete change of heart is needed for reconciliation. The gospel of Non-co-operation aims to make people strong and self-reliant, turning hatred into compassion. A strong India won't hate, but will have the power to forgive. Non-co-operation can purify and strengthen India, turning it into a global force for good. The Indian soldiers have unwittingly harmed other nations, and Indian Maharajas boasting about loyalty to the English is shameful.

The proposed change has faced criticism in newspapers, but the country's popular opinion is ahead of these influential newspapers. Today, forming opinions is not just for the educated; the masses now shape and enforce opinions. It's vital not to disregard this opinion or think it's temporary. The masses' awakening is not solely due to leaders like the Ali Brothers but because they voice the sentiments of the people. The masses are perceptive, even if they struggle to express and achieve their desires. Leadership is crucial to guide them rightly. The proposed creed mirrors the nation's current wishes and suggests how to achieve them. It's crucial to show the British that India aims for progress with or without their connection.

The changes in the All-India Congress Committee have made it the Subjects Committee, with a focus on linguistic divisions in India. Gandhi suggests proportional representation to allow all parties representation. He clarifies his views on the British Committee, stating that he has long held his current opinions. While he did not propose the extinction of the committee during the constitution preparation, he plans to push for its abolition. Gandhi believes that non-cooperation is a purifying movement despite some instances of rowdyism. He expects significant results and hopes for a non-violent redress of wrongs like the Khilafat issue and Punjab wrong. Gandhi envisions a Parliamentary Government in India, secured through British support or otherwise, leading to Swaraj.

In my humble view, the Congress will do the best thing if it agrees on this resolution. May we all support and have the strength to follow through within a year. The last question is significant but not complex. It concerns the influence of lawyers and doctors. Let's explore these professions. We've discussed railways earlier. It's vital for us to limit our movements to where we can reach on foot. By avoiding the rush of modern conveniences like railways, we can reduce confusion. Our self-created problems arise from exceeding our natural limits. India remains one nation despite diverse religions. Foreigners assimilate into the nation. A country is truly united when it can absorb different cultures. India has always been inclusive. Nationality and religion shouldn't clash. Hindus, Muslims, Parsees, and Christians in India are all fellow citizens who must live in harmony for their common good. The idea of inherent enmity between Hindus and Muslims is a misconception created by our adversaries. Both groups lived peacefully before British rule. Cooperation is key for a nation's prosperity.|"[""1. What is the main idea of the text passage?\nA. The importance of limiting modern conveniences\nB. The history of India's diverse religions\nC.

The sayings you mentioned were created during conflicts between Hindus and Mahomedans, and repeating them now only causes harm. Shouldn't we recall that many Hindus and Mahomedans share common ancestors and blood? Do people become enemies because of their faith change? Aren't the Gods of Mahomedans and Hindus the same? Different religions are like various paths leading to the same destination. It doesn't matter which path we take as long as we reach the same goal. Why quarrel then? There are harsh sayings between followers of Shiva and Vishnu, yet they are part of the same nation. While Vedic religion differs from Jainism, their followers are not separate nations. As we gain knowledge, we realize we need not fight those with different beliefs. Respecting the cow, a symbol of protection in India, is essential. Just as I respect the cow, I respect my fellow humans, whether Hindu or Mahomedan. Protecting the cow involves uniting with my Mahomedan brother for the country's sake. If he disagrees, I must let the cow go, as I cannot force him. Sacrificing my life for the cow's protection is noble, but not at the cost of my brother's life. When faced with stubbornness, a gentle approach is key to avoid escalating conflicts.|"['1.

When faced with a situation where a close friend is about to harm an animal, we must choose a path of peace and compassion. It is essential to understand that both Hindus and Muslims have their beliefs, but the core of all religions is to promote harmony and non-violence. While there may be differences in practices, it is crucial to respect each other's beliefs and not let external influences sow seeds of discord between us. By deepening our understanding of our own faith and living by its principles, we can prevent conflicts and maintain unity. Just as two brothers can live in peace if they choose not to heed divisive advice, Hindus and Muslims can coexist peacefully by upholding the values of their respective religions. Let us strengthen our hearts and minds like well-baked clay, impervious to outside influences that seek to divide us.|"['1.

There is a lack of trust between Hindus and Mahomedans. The Mahomedans seek concessions from Lord Morley, but why should Hindus oppose this? If Hindus refrain, the English would notice, and trust between the communities could grow, fostering brotherhood. It's unnecessary to involve English in our disputes. Quarrels may happen, but resorting to courts isn't ideal. Fighting may lead to injuries, and seeking justice from others isn't fair. Interdining and intermarrying aren't essential for Hindu-Mahomedan unity. Caste, in its origin, was beneficial. Eating is a private act, not a public display. Maintaining restraint over appetites, including food and marriage, is crucial for spiritual growth. Personal choices like eating privately don't hinder friendships. Strong religious beliefs don't require intermarriage or public dining for unity.|"['1. Why do Hindus oppose seeking concessions from Lord Morley according to the text?\nA.

Intermarriage and interdining do not always guarantee unity. The Pandavas and Kauravas fought despite sharing meals and marriages. The bitterness between the English and Germans persists. Friendship and unity do not depend on intermarriage or interdining. Insisting on these can create barriers to unity. Hindu-Muslim unity should focus on common goals, sharing sorrows, and mutual tolerance. Supporting each other's causes, like the Khilafat issue, fosters true unity. Tolerance is crucial; we can disagree but still respect each other. For successful non-cooperation, Hindu-Muslim unity and non-violence are essential. In times of strain, like in Agra, respected figures like Hakimji Ajmal Khan can help resolve disputes and strengthen unity.|"['1.

There are three options available to the oppressed individuals in the country. Seeking help from the government may seem tempting due to impatience, but it can lead to further troubles. Currently, they may be oppressed, but with government assistance, they might end up suppressing their own community. The experience of other groups like the Mussalmans and Sikhs who tried this route ended in failure and increased discontent. Therefore, government aid is not a viable solution. Another choice is mass conversion to Islam or Christianity for worldly gains, but religion is a personal matter not to be abandoned for convenience. The third and final option is self-reliance and self-improvement, with support from non-Panchama Hindus out of duty, not charity. This can be achieved through well-organized non-cooperation, which requires internal effort and leadership. Protest through intelligent non-cooperation can be effective, but it demands unity and guidance from capable leaders.|"['1.

The best approach for the Panchamas is to actively support the national movement against the oppressive government. This movement requires cooperation among all sections of Indian society. Hindus must unite with Panchamas, just as they have with Muslims, to effectively practice non-cooperation. This non-cooperation is a peaceful movement focused on self-purification. The attention given to national non-cooperation is crucial, even though the Panchama and non-Brahmin issues are significant. It is essential to address internal challenges like the treatment of the 'depressed' classes to strengthen the national cause. Hindu-Muslim unity and the upliftment of all citizens are fundamental for achieving Swaraj. Surrendering vital principles for unity is detrimental. The oppression of any group within Hindustan hinders progress towards true independence.|"['1.

The Gujarat Senate made a tough choice to resist the storm. Refusing to cooperate is a way of cleansing oneself. We should not hold onto outdated traditions to achieve true independence.

In various parts of His Majesty's dominions, such as Fiji, German East Africa, and British East Africa, Indian settlers face challenges due to the lawlessness of the powerful. In German East Africa, Indians express concerns about the safety of their property, facing obstacles in trade and financial transactions. British East Africa presents a thicker cloud of adversity, with European settlers attempting to strip Indian settlers of their rights through legislation and administration. The Government of India must uphold a consistent and firm policy to protect Indian settlers' interests. An urgent need for action was highlighted in a meeting in Bombay, emphasizing the political and civil rights at stake.

The East African resolution sheds light on the plight of our countrymen in the former German East Africa. Indian soldiers fought there, yet the situation for Indians worsened post-German rule.

The significant Conference at Gujrat addressed the status of Indians abroad, raising concerns about potential non-cooperation. In Kenia Colony, Indian rights faced unjust confiscation, supported by Lord Milnor and Mr. Montagu, leaving Indians marginalized without representation. Despite warnings, the Viceroy is yet to ensure justice. Similarly, in South Africa, repatriation appears compulsory due to anti-Asiatic sentiments, posing risks for unsuspecting Indians. Fiji's atrocities are being concealed, urging caution for Indian members. British Guiana's outlook for Indian enterprise seems bleak, as Indians are viewed as mere scavengers.

"In the ""Times of India,"" the Editor and Mrs. Besant criticized non-co-operation linked to the Khilafat movement. They raised concerns about potential violence arising from ostracism in Calcutta and Delhi. Ostracism, they argue, can turn violent if individuals face unbearable insults.

Despite these challenges, non-violent non-co-operation remains crucial. Mr. Montagu disapproves of the Khilafat movement's growing momentum. He expressed concerns about potential unrest.

I see no difference between the Imperial and Indian Government. The Indian Government has agreed to the Khilafat policy forced upon it by the Imperial Government. In the Punjab case, the Imperial Government has supported the policy of terrorism and oppression of a courageous people started by the Indian Government. British officials have broken their promises and hurt the sentiments of the seventy million Indian Muslims. Innocent people were insulted by the arrogant officers of the Punjab Government. Their grievances remain unaddressed, and the very officers who mistreated them still hold positions under the Government. I can no longer support a Government that is currently so corrupt. It is distressing to witness ongoing injustice. Mr. Montagu is right to threaten me with imprisonment if I continue to challenge the Government. My only regret is that Mr. Montagu does not see the injustice being perpetuated. Those who support me should not oppose my arrest, as it is essential for the progress of the movement. Resisting the Government's actions would only lead to disaster.

Dr. Sapru spoke at the Khilafat Conference in Allahabad, showing support for the Muslims in their difficulties but advising against non-cooperation. He believed non-cooperation would do more harm than good, even though he couldn't suggest an alternative. Dr. Sapru feared chaos if the ignorant masses joined non-cooperation. He argued that even a simple act like a door-keeper resigning due to a sense of national honor could be more impactful than speeches against the government. I agree with Dr. Sapru's concerns, but I believe any form of non-cooperation can have positive effects. I plan to appeal to judges and officials to join the nationwide protest against the injustices on the Khilafat and Punjab issues, as it involves national honor. I urge these officials to prioritize serving the country over personal gain or fame. It is crucial for judges and executives to step down if the government does not represent the people's will and engages in dishonesty and terrorism.|"[""1.

I urge our esteemed leaders to consider stepping down from their positions, as this act could swiftly end the struggle and prevent potential risks from arising due to the public expressing their disapproval through non-cooperation. If those holding titles and honorary roles relinquished them, along with high-ranking officials resigning, and aspiring councilors boycotting councils, the Government would likely heed the people's desires. Failure to do so may lead to despotic rule or even military dictatorship, which would not be tolerated in the modern world. Embracing non-cooperation could bring about a peaceful revolution, eliminating the need for bloodshed. The severity of the cause justifies this drastic method, especially concerning past injustices like the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. Gandhi's visit to Madras highlighted the growing discipline and unity among the masses, making non-cooperation a potent tool for change.|"['1.

During an interview, Mr. Gandhi was asked about his support for non-co-operation and the boycott of the Royal visit. He explained that non-co-operation was necessary to show dissatisfaction with the Government's actions regarding the Khilafat and Punjab issues. He acknowledged that not all Muslims were enthusiastic about non-co-operation but believed that the majority supported it. Mr. Gandhi emphasized that the upper class's response to the boycott was still uncertain as it was early in the process. He stated that advocating non-co-operation did not imply disloyalty to the King but was a form of protest against the government's policies. He believed that boycotting the Royal visit was a way for the people to express their disapproval of the government's actions. Mr. Gandhi saw non-co-operation as a means to achieve a just government and did not support obstructive tactics in legislative councils as they were inconsistent with the spirit of non-co-operation.|"[""1.

The leader discussed the use of non-co-operation as a means of protest. He explained that it is a constitutional remedy when all other options have been exhausted. Non-co-operation should be a strategic choice, taken gradually to avoid chaos. The leader emphasized the importance of readiness in the country before taking such steps. For example, citizens in Lahore and Amritsar successfully protected themselves through voluntary assistance when the police were unavailable. Although the response from lawyers to suspend their practice in non-co-operation has been limited, the leader remains hopeful that the masses will support the movement in later stages. The leader also touched on the concept of Ahimsa, emphasizing the positive aspect of love and resistance against wrong without resorting to violence.|['1.

Non-co-operation is an active stance, more vigorous than physical resistance or violence. It must be non-violent, free from punishment, malice, or hatred. It would be wrong for me to assist General Dyer in harming innocent people. However, showing forgiveness and care to him if he were ill would be an act of love. I would cooperate with the government to guide it away from wrongdoing but not to perpetuate it. I would rather be a beggar than accept anything tainted with the blood of innocents. The Gita teaches duty over consequences, not violence for good. Jesus navigated politics by serving Caesar but resisting temptation. Non-co-operation aims to create a moral impact through selflessness and purification. It is puzzling to equate General Dyer's massacre with non-co-operation.

The letter I received, written after my Vellore speech, highlights the importance of the non-co-operation movement, emphasizing that it is not against Christianity, England, or Europe but a battle between good and evil. The author criticizes Europe, stating that it represents the spirit of Satan, not God or Christianity. The letter questions the moral progress of Europe, pointing out that material possessions are valued more than spiritual growth. It also condemns the actions of the victors in the recent war, labeling them as Satanic due to the disregard for public morality. The letter praises the religious and honorable motives of the Hindus and Muslims in their struggle against the government, contrasting them with the materialistic greed seen in Europe.

India is battling evil forces through non-violent non-cooperation. Those like Miss Peterson, whether Christian or European, can help dethrone this error by joining the movement. The honor of Islam is linked to the safety of religion, and India's honor is tied to every weak nation. I am grateful for your kindness, which has influenced my future. I have devoted myself to India, yet my true abode is in Christ. We Christians must stop disgracing Him in India. We should stand with the poor and oppressed, not bow to worldly powers. Even if alone against the world, I must follow my conscience. Winning the majority is crucial, and Congress will support us. Uniting Hindus and Muslims will be a significant move.

I acknowledge that non-cooperation carries risks, but the danger of doing nothing in the face of a serious issue is far greater than the potential violence resulting from organizing non-cooperation. To merely condemn non-cooperation without understanding the deep sense of injustice felt by the people is easy. It is a more challenging task to calm a populace angered by wrongs. Those who oppose non-cooperation should engage directly with the people, comprehend their sentiments, and then decide if they can still stand against non-cooperation. The only way to prevent violence is by enabling people to express their grievances to seek redress. Non-cooperation is a logical and peaceful method. It is the inherent right of citizens to withhold support from a government that ignores their voices. The success of non-cooperation as a voluntary movement hinges on the genuine and strong feelings that drive people to endure hardships for their cause. If the religious feelings of Muslims are deeply wounded and Hindus truly value their Muslim brethren, they will spare no effort to achieve their objectives. Non-cooperation will not only be an effective solution but also a test of the sincerity of Muslim claims and Hindu friendships. While some argue against my involvement in the Khilafat movement, citing my friendship with the English and admiration for the British constitution, my duty towards my countrymen, the Muslims, takes precedence. I can serve my people without harming the English or anyone else. I will not harm an Englishman to gain power, but I will withdraw cooperation if necessary, just as|"[""1.

I propose a challenging idea for lawyers to halt their practice. The Government has always relied on lawyers for power. Though lawyers lead and fight for the nation, they are crucial in challenging the Government. Suspending their practice can show the Government their dissent. Lawyers, as honorary court officers, must relinquish their roles to withdraw support. This act aims to establish justice through arbitration courts and swadeshi justice. Additionally, withdrawing children from Government schools and collegiate students from colleges is essential to gauge national sentiment. These schools serve to produce clerks and civil servants, a system we must reject to cease cooperation. Furthermore, title holders should renounce their titles, as they symbolize dishonor under an unjust Government. This passive non-cooperation is crucial to evolving true justice from injustice and achieving ordered progress without chaos.|['1.

I appreciate the addresses presented to us but must now focus on business. It's a pleasure to reconnect with you, and I have high hopes for Trichinopoly, Madura, and other places. I believe in the significance of non-co-operation, particularly in matters concerning religion and honor. It's crucial for Hindus to support their Muslim brothers in their just cause. Our leader supports non-co-operation but suggests seeking election to Councils for a more effective battle. Boycotting Councils can create public opinion against injustices. The suspension of legal practice and boycotting government schools are steps towards non-co-operation that can weaken the authorities.

Our friend has proposed avoiding British or foreign products, known as Swadeshi. He believes a full boycott of foreign goods will garner more support. However, from my years of experience and understanding of business classes, boycotting all foreign goods is more challenging than other suggestions. The steps I propose involve little financial sacrifice. In contrast, boycotting foreign goods would require merchant princes to give up millions. While my suggestions involve no punishment, boycotting foreign goods is seen as a penalty, effective only when enforced. I urge all, including my Muslim brothers, to realize that vindicating national honor doesn't require punishment but self-sacrifice. It's crucial for the country to make the right choice, not in armed conflict but in enduring hardships for the nation's dignity. Citizens of Trichinopoly, you can start non-cooperation immediately, surrender titles, and support the Khilafat Committee. Let's nationalize schools and settle disputes through arbitration.

The first step in my view is quite simple as it requires no significant sacrifice. If respected individuals were to give up their titles, it would not only honor the nation but also receive applause. Renouncing titles is seen as necessary by many, including Mr. Kastariranga Iyengar, the editor of _Hindu_. The second step involves boycotting councils, which some oppose due to fears of moderates entering. However, citizens can prevent this by uniting in Mangalore. Lawyers are urged to suspend practice to protest against an unjust government. It is also crucial to withdraw support from government schools to fully participate in non-cooperation. Hindu-Muslim Unity is vital for India's progress, exemplified by Maulana Shaukat Ali resolving disputes without legal representation. Respecting each other's sentiments is key to fostering unity. Arbitration should be used to settle disputes peacefully, avoiding unnecessary conflicts.|"[""1.

I am pleased to inform you that Mr. Kaleswar Rao has decided not to run for election in the new Legislative Councils. Additionally, Mr. Gulam Nohiuddin has resigned from his Honorary Magistrateship.

The recent events in Punjab have united the Muslim community and awakened their sense of duty. We must stand upright and not accept injustices.

This morning, we discussed the bravery of the sword and the bravery of suffering. I personally reject the use of the sword. Today, I want to talk about the power of suffering, also known as Non-co-operation. This form of bravery is open to all, even the weakest among us. It doesn't require violence but rather sacrifice for a noble cause. If 300 million Indians can show this power, we won't need swords. Sacrifice is crucial for our nation's progress. Parents show this power in their daily lives. If we value our religion and nation, we can develop this power on a larger scale. By renouncing titles, suspending practices, and making sacrifices, we can achieve true education and honor. Let's not be tempted by government offices or legislative councils. Moderates believe in cooperation, but nationalists know justice comes from non-cooperation. Let's embrace sacrifice and spirituality to bring about real change.|"[""1.

The recent Congress was the largest and most significant ever held. It was a powerful demonstration against the current government system. The President acknowledged that the people were leading instead of being led. The Congress spent days discussing and voting on important matters. They showed their intelligence by dissenting when necessary. The Congress focused on non-interference in Native States but emphasized the need for Responsible Government. They took steps towards self-rule through honorable and non-violent means. The Congress emphasized non-violence, Hindu-Muslim unity, and eradication of untouchability. They called on parents and lawyers to contribute more to the nation. The Congress urged unity and full participation from every citizen. The boycott suggestion for the Prince of Wales was not about boycotting him but rather the bureaucracy and dishonest ministers.|"['1.

"You can't have it both ways. In a constitutional monarchy, the royalty is above politics. But if you send the Prince on a political visit to gain political advantage and then criticize those who refuse to play along and boycott the Royal visit, it's unfair to claim they don't understand constitutional norms. The Prince's visit isn't just for pleasure. His Royal Highness is coming as the ""ambassador of the British nation"" to promote the government's image and possibly give ministers a boost. This move aims to strengthen a regime that poses a threat to India. Mr. Montagu anticipates an exceptional welcome, indicating that people aren't deeply moved by the atrocities in Punjab and the dishonesty regarding the Khilafat promises. Given India's distress, the government should have postponed the Prince's visit. It's disrespectful to use the Prince's visit to enhance a government that should be ousted. I argue that India, mourning deeply, isn't in a mood to welcome His Royal Highness, and the government is disloyal for using the Prince in their political games.

At a packed gathering of Muslims in Muzaffarabad, Bombay, on July 29, 1920, Mr. Gandhi addressed the impending non-cooperation movement starting on August 1. He emphasized the need for a peaceful environment and a spirit of self-sacrifice for the movement's success. Mr. Gandhi believed that non-cooperation should be free from violence and anger, as violence wasted valuable energy. He stressed the importance of controlling negative forces and promoting non-violent methods. He urged people to withdraw support from unjust governments and establish independent systems for education and dispute resolution. Swadeshi, or self-reliance, was also highlighted as a key aspect of the movement, encouraging people to sacrifice luxurious foreign goods for locally made products. Mr. Gandhi envisioned a united nation embracing Swadeshi with religious fervor, which would empower them and make a global impact.|"[""1.

If the Viceroy had not been so defiant about the Punjab and the Khilafat, I would have congratulated him for using ridicule instead of repression to suppress a movement he disliked. Ridiculing opponents is a common tactic in civilized politics, showing a shift from savagery to civilization. His Excellency's interpretation of non-co-operation is reasonable when taken out of context. However, when combined with his views on the Punjab and the Khilafat, it seems like a forced virtue. His attempt to mock the movement with words like 'futile,' 'ill-advised,' and 'visionary' may backfire, as movements grow stronger with ridicule and repression. The only way to counter this is through organized non-cooperation to earn respect. The Viceroy's refusal to address issues in the Punjab and his plea for cooperation seem hypocritical. The Indian people deserve justice, not empty words.|"[""1.

His Excellency appears dissatisfied with the Khilafat situation. He claims to have advocated for Indian Muslims at the Peace Conference, but feels let down by the allied Powers' decisions. However, the Viceroy's stance is misleading as he shifts blame to the allied Powers for the peace terms when it was primarily Mr. Lloyd George's doing. The Viceroy acknowledges the validity of Muslim claims, yet his actions contradict this. The nation's movement towards non-co-operation is gaining momentum, with students and institutions joining in. Notably, Pandit Motilal Nehru's sacrifice highlights the seriousness of the situation. While the government's trial of individuals advocating violence may be justified, suppressing opinions and dissent is seen as repression.

To prevent disaffection from spreading, one way is to address its causes. This involves acknowledging the country's growing support for the non-co-operation movement. However, expecting the government to change its ways might be unrealistic. The government's likely response could be increasing repression, escalating alongside the non-co-operation movement. If the movement endures this repression, victory for truth may be close. The people must be prepared for legal actions, punishments, and even deportations. They must develop self-governance skills to continue their mission without relying solely on leaders. Ultimately, if the government refuses to heed the nation's demands, it may have to yield power to a more suitable administration.|"['1.

You are seeking a solution to calm the growing national sentiment. I propose that the only way to achieve this is by addressing the root causes. You still have the authority to act. You can acknowledge past injustices towards Indians. You can hold Mr. Lloyd George accountable for his promises. There are avenues for change. You can urge the Viceroy to step down for a more suitable replacement, reconsider your stance on Sir Michael O'Dwyer and General Dyer, and convene a conference with elected representatives to discuss granting self-rule (_Swaraj_) in line with the desires of the Indian people. But this requires recognizing every Indian as your equal and sibling. Repression is an option, but it will likely fail. Recent events show the government's crackdown on dissent. I urge you to choose cooperation with India, as opposing their aspirations is disloyal. Mr. Stokes, a Christian residing in the Kotgarh hills, supports non-cooperation but fears the aftermath of British withdrawal. He envisions India vulnerable to invasions. However, like Cardinal Newman, I believe in taking one step at a time. The movement is deeply spiritual, emphasizing the detachment from evil despite potential risks. Trust in good actions yielding positive outcomes is key. Those who view the government as evil must distance themselves from it, even if it jeopardizes their safety.|"['1.

Let's think about the worst-case scenario if the British suddenly leave India. Even if the Gurkhas and Pathans attack, we can handle their violence better than the ongoing oppression by the current Government. We can unite the Rajput, Sikh, and Mussalman warriors to defend against any invaders. If Japan, Gurkhas, and Pathans threaten us, we can either drive them out or make peace with them. It's better than submitting to an unjust regime. I believe in the goodness of human nature, whether English or not. If we embrace spirituality, help our neighbors, and become self-reliant, we can prevent invasions and live peacefully. By following non-violence and sacrificing for our beliefs, we can create a better future. Humility, reliance on God, and respectful behavior are key to our success in the movement for independence.

Non-co-operation is a test of sincerity, requiring silent self-sacrifice and challenging honesty and capacity for national work. It aims to turn ideas into action, revealing imperfections that humble us. A non-co-operationist sets an example through humble actions, not violence, allowing deeds to speak for beliefs. Strength lies in relying on the correctness of one's position, with humility key to success. Swaraj is attainable with humility and self-restraint. Critically, non-co-operation should not be anti-Government but a means to voice demands. Co-operation with the Indian Government is crucial unless it fails to represent India's needs.

I welcome the letter above and agree to the suggestion of giving a public response as many may face the same difficulty as our English friend. The challenge is not due to deliberate opposition but because people can sway others to support a cause without fully understanding it. Patient discussions with honest individuals are crucial to self-reflection, correcting errors, and persuading them to see the truth. The Khilafat issue is complex with many side matters, making decisions challenging. However, achieving harmony and peace in India is vital. Refusal to cooperate or pay taxes is not anti-Government but a stance against perceived injustice. It is similar to a brother not supporting his sibling's wrongdoing. Non-cooperation is justified when the Government fails to address the concerns of its people effectively.

"There has been much talk of violence ensuing from active non-co-operation. I venture to suggest that the Mussalmans of India, if they had nothing in the shape of non-co-operation in view, would have long ago yielded to counsels of despair. I admit that non-co-operation is not unattended with danger. But violence is a certainty without, violence is only a possibility with non-co-operation. And it will he a greater possibility if all the important men, English, Hindu and others of the country discountenance it.

I think, that the recommendation made by the friend is being literally followed by the Mahomedans. Although they practically know the fate, they are waiting for the actual terms of the treaty with Turkey. They are certainly going to try every means at their disposal to have the terms revised before beginning non-co-operation. And there will certainly be no non-co-operation commenced so long as there is even hope of active co-operation on the part of the Government of India with the Mahomedans, that is, co-operation strong enough to secure a revision of the terms should they be found to be in conflict with the pledges of British statesmen. But if all these things fail, can Mahomedans as men of honour who hold their religion dearer than their lives do anything less than wash their hands clean of the guilt of British Ministers and the Government of India by refusing to co-operate with them? And can Hindus and Englishmen, if they value Mahomedan friendship"|"[""1.

I believe that despite the lack of hope in the peace terms and the Viceregal message, there is no need for despair among Mahomedans and Indians. It is crucial for Mahomedans to maintain self-control, unite, and continue the struggle with renewed determination until justice prevails. If both Hindus and Mahomedans stand together and disengage from the unjust peace terms, they can push for a revision and achieve lasting peace. The path ahead may be challenging, but the sacrifice is worthwhile. The focus should be on unity, restraint, and non-cooperation rather than material losses. The response to these challenges will determine the fate of the Khilafat. The journey of non-cooperation may face obstacles, but with discipline and unity, the goal can be achieved. It is essential to educate the masses on the power of non-violence and work towards a cohesive and disciplined movement. The current environment is conducive to a restrained and united effort by the masses.|"[""1.

Leaving a civil job is not feared if one can support themselves and their family. Disapproving the withdrawal of students shows a lack of understanding of non-cooperation. When the education system becomes corrupt, continuing to support it means being part of that corruption. It is expected that teachers would resign if students leave. Money should not be prioritized over honor or religion. Boycotting councils should involve those who believe in non-cooperation, not just at the top but at all levels. Councillors cannot expect lower-ranking staff to resign while they remain. The letter from Mr. Pennington, though critical, shows a lack of understanding of the full context. The English lack in-depth knowledge of global events due to reliance on biased media. India has demanded trials for all involved in crimes against the Punjab. The truth may sound harsh, but it must be spoken, especially concerning General Dyer's actions. Military spending has increased significantly since Canning's time, and promises have not been kept.|"['1.

No evidence was found of the alleged Danda Fauj, which Mr. Pennington called a bludgeon-army. There was no rebel army in Amritsar. The violence was not limited to one community. The incendiary acts were not exclusive to a particular group. The incriminating sheet was only found in Lahore, not Amritsar. Mr. Pennington should have known that the meeting on the 13th aimed to condemn mob violence, as highlighted in the Amritsar trial. General Dyer acted independently without consulting anyone, deciding to shoot on the spot. The troops did not intervene, and the correspondent's claim that they would have objected to a potential massacre shows a lack of understanding of the situation in India. The Indian troops, unfortunately, lacked the courage to resist such orders due to the oppressive atmosphere they were in. Mr. Pennington is urged to review the evidence from the Hunter and Congress Committees to understand the gravity of General Dyer's actions. His biased and angry stance hinders his ability to seek the truth objectively.|"[""1.

I disagree with your plan to boycott the Indian government through non-co-operation. While I appreciate your peaceful intentions for revolution, your harsh criticism of General Dyer's actions lacks evidence. You accuse him of cowardice and brutality without proof. We were not present during the Jallianwalla Bagh tragedy, so we cannot be certain if the crowd was unarmed. The assembly was illegal, as General Dyer had warned against gatherings. Your sympathy for the mob overlooks their violence that led to Dyer's actions. It is unlikely that Dyer acted alone, and troops would have objected to a massacre. An accurate account of the events is crucial for understanding the truth. Let's consider General Dyer's perspective in dealing with a perceived rebellion to protect the city. Babu Janakdhari Prasad supports non-violent non-co-operation for India's progress, but has doubts that need addressing.|"['1.

The movement I lead is not about creating hatred but rather giving disciplined expression to it. Ignoring evil won't make it disappear. I choose non-co-operation to promote universal brotherhood and self-purification for a better world. The terms 'satanic' and 'devilish' describe a system, not individuals. We must hate evil to avoid it, but non-co-operation helps us separate evil from evildoers. Emotion fuels the movement, making it powerful. While there's a risk of violence, we can't abandon non-violent non-co-operation due to its challenges, just like we can't give up freedom for fear of misuse.

It is important for those who choose non-cooperation to understand that violence cannot lead to the progress of our nation. While other countries like Ireland and Turkey may achieve their goals through violence, India's path to freedom cannot be paved with violence due to the peaceful nature of its people. The essence of Islam in India has been one of peaceful coexistence and dignified suffering. To achieve Swaraj within a year, non-cooperationists must adhere to non-violence. Violence only perpetuates the cycle of oppression and does not align with the principles of our faith or the spirit of our vow. We must resist the temptation to resort to violence as it contradicts our pursuit of freedom through non-cooperation and peaceful resistance. Our strength lies in non-violence and righteousness, not in aggression and hostility. Let us remain steadfast in our commitment to non-violence and uphold the values of peace and dignity.|"[""1.

We must avoid using coercive methods to influence people to follow our beliefs. It is crucial to provide others with the same freedom we seek for ourselves. We should not manipulate or exploit the masses for political gains. Mahatma Gandhi emphasized the importance of non-violence and took full responsibility for his actions, acknowledging the consequences of his words and deeds. He faced the court with integrity, ready to accept the highest penalty for what he believed was a citizen's duty.
