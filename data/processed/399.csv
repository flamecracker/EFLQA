Dr. Sampson handed Rodney a letter that would change his life. The news meant Rodney had to leave school. His guardian, Benjamin Fielding, sent a check for $125. Dr. Sampson would keep what was due to him and give the rest to Rodney. The doctor told Rodney to stay until Monday before finding new arrangements. Later, a casket arrived with precious jewelry that belonged to Rodney's late mother. Feeling alone and abandoned, Rodney expressed his desire to keep the jewelry as a memory of his parents. Dr. Sampson offered to buy the items, but Rodney declined, valuing them for sentimental reasons. Despite Dr. Sampson's supposed friendship, Rodney felt a lack of genuine care.

"Dear Sir,

I have discovered that certain items, such as ladies' cloaks and silk dress patterns, have been taken from your inventory and sold outside. I won't reveal how I found out to avoid any ill will, but I must inform you that the culprit is one of your employees, possibly someone you least suspect - Rodney Ropes. I live near him and saw him carrying a bundle to his room from the store. If you investigate his room when he's away, you may find some of the stolen items. I don't wish to cause trouble, but I cannot stand to see you being robbed. A FRIEND.

Mrs. McCarty hesitated to allow Mr. Redwood into Rodney's room, but upon seeing the contents of the bundle - a lady's cloak - her doubts faded. Mr. Goodnow expressed regret, revealing his fondness for Rodney and the circumstances of their meeting. Rodney, unaware of the accusation, entered Mr. Goodnow's office to a stern look. Despite the serious accusation, Rodney remained composed, eager to uncover the truth.

At the store, Jasper took over Rodney's position, leading to a raise in his pay to seven dollars per week. However, this was still less than what he used to earn when he was involved in selling stolen items with Philip Carton. Their scheme involved Jasper packing extra items when Philip made a purchase, leading to reduced prices for Carton to sell them. Despite making some profit, it was not as much as Mr. Goodnow had lost. After Rodney's dismissal due to theft, Jasper and Philip decided to halt their scheme. This decision affected Carton more than Jasper since Jasper had a stable income and a home, unlike Philip. One day, Jasper noticed a well-dressed boy in the park, sparking his curiosity.

Despite Pettigrew having a tempting bag of gold, Wheeler hesitated due to fear. While others at the Miners’ Rest slept early after a tiring day, Wheeler, unlike the miners, was awake.
