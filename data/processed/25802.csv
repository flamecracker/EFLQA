Ruth and her companions embarked on a scenic drive to the Red Mill. Ruth pondered if the smart roadster they passed belonged to Mr. Horatio Bilby.

Aunt Alvirah didn't mind where the car went as long as it moved fast. She enjoyed the speed after years of being slowed down by rheumatism. The inn was a few miles from Long Bridge, and they caught glimpses of it as they rode. Scarecrows dotted the cornfields on the right, adding a touch of New England charm. Suddenly, a car emerged from the bushes with Horatio Bilby and another person inside. Ruth recognized Bilby and realized that the figure with him wasn't Wonota.

Ruth gestured to the younger girl and then turned her attention to the white man swimming towards the shore. She wasn't scared of him, just as the Indian chief wasn't afraid of the other white man on the motorboat. The swimmer reached the bank, looking disheveled, and Ruth watched him with disdain.

"""We may have avoided Bilby,"" the girl from the Red Mill stated, ""but I won't feel secure about Wonota unless you stay close to her, Totantora. You must watch over your daughter. She is precious."" The group spent the night at a small hotel in Chippewa Bay. The next morning, Ruth and her friends boarded a motor launch to reach an island where a film company had set up in rented bungalows.

The following day was just as beautiful as the first. Preparations were in progress all over the island Mr. Hammond had rented for Ruth's movie. Mr. Hooley, the director, was studying the continuity, and the main actors had their instructions. The extras in the film usually don't know much about the plot; they just follow directions for their scenes. Since the scenes are not shot in order, they have little idea about the story itself. Ruth had picked a series of events from early French-Canadian history, starting with an allegory about the introduction of Christianity to the Indians by French priests. Ruth and Helen later visited Copley Island, where they spent an enjoyable evening with friends. The next day, the film crew, including real Native American actors, began shooting scenes on barges in the waterways near Chippewa Bay. The day's bright weather made it perfect for outdoor filming.|"[""1.

The decorated barge carrying the Frenchmen approached the shore, where the Indians, adorned in traditional attire, created a stunning sight. Totantora and his daughter, White Fawn, stood out among the group. As the scene unfolded, Helen cheered the Osage girl, prompting a reprimand. The lush forest backdrop added to the spectacle. The actors meticulously portrayed the Frenchmen's arrival, with attention to detail in costumes and props. The day concluded with a late lunch and more filming. However, during the screening, a wild man's unexpected appearance disrupted the scene. Despite the setback, Mr. Hammond praised the overall work but acknowledged the need for a reshoot due to the unforeseen interruption.

The work progressed swiftly as the weather remained ideal for taking pictures. Ruth was occupied but managed to enjoy some leisure time, particularly in the evenings. One night, she happily joined a moonlit boating excursion to Alexandria Bay on Chess Copley's boat, the _Lauriette_. They dined, danced, and returned in the early morning, mesmerized by the moonlight on the islands and silver water passages. However, back at the bungalow, Ruth found her roommate, Helen, in a bad mood. Helen's behavior towards Chess Copley was cold and distant, causing Ruth some frustration.

In the story, Ruth and her companion Chessleigh were on a boat called the _Lauriette_ on the St. Lawrence River. They saw a powerful speed boat from Canada with several men on board. Ruth recognized one of the men as a rival picture producer named Bilby. Ruth explained to Chessleigh about Bilby's troublesome past at the Red Mill. Chessleigh wondered why Bilby had a Chinaman with him, suspecting smuggling. Mr. Hammond, the film corporation president, questioned Ruth's identification due to the darkening evening.

Ruth confided in Totantora after talking to Mr. Hammond but kept Wonota unaware. Ruth feared that knowing Bilby was nearby might unsettle Wonota, despite her usual calm demeanor. The chief, sensing danger, warned Ruth not to dwell on Bilby's threats against Wonota. As summer residents flocked to the Thousand Islands, plans for a grand costume dance at the Alexandria Bay hotel were underway. Wonota assisted in preparing Indian costumes for the event, wearing a stunning beaded robe for her role in a film.

On that day, Ruth and her friends were left waiting as Willie and the _Gem_ did not return for them. While coaching Wonota, Helen spotted an Indian in a canoe swiftly paddling towards them. The girls were amazed by the speed and skill of Chief Totantora. He quickly leaped ashore without tipping the canoe and exchanged words with his daughter in their native language. Ruth tried to inquire about their sudden departure, but Totantora seemed focused on a mission to reach Grenadier Island. Ruth understood that they were fleeing a potential threat and that Mr. Hammond had advised this sudden move. The Indian girl and her father swiftly paddled away towards safety, leaving Ruth pondering the unfolding mystery.|"['1.

"Helen interrupted, ""Even good sense won't save us. I want to go back to camp and hear the details. Totantora talks less than anyone I've seen. And Wonota isn't much better."" A distant sound echoed, ""co-ee! co-ee!"" fading into the forest-covered islands. They couldn't spot any inhabited isles. ""It's a signal,"" Ruth explained, recalling an early morning incident with Chess Copley. The boat slowed, passing the island where the old man lived. Ruth speculated on the sudden departure of Totantora. Helen remembered Mr. Hammond's trip to Oak Point and the delay in their return.

"""Kids, this is too important to argue about,"" Ruth advised, smiling as her friend showed interest in the young man. ""Guess what we saw, Chess?"" She filled him in on the Indian issue as they boarded the launch. Chess was keen on Ruth's problem and the fate of the Indians. Helen eagerly shared details about the fast launch, the mysterious lady, and their suspicions about the island they called the Kingdom of Pipes. ""Let's sail to the island tonight with Tom and investigate,"" Chess suggested. Ruth sought Mr. Hammond on the island where the film company was based. Mr. Hooley, the director, explained the situation with Totantora and the attempts to involve Wonota, the Osage princess, in a film. He mentioned the challenges faced in the film industry and the legal issues they were dealing with.

Ruth was beginning to understand the complexities of her contract with the Alectrion Film Corporation. She had gained valuable knowledge about the film industry and even offered advice that was admired by Mr. Hooley. However, she felt constrained by certain agreements that limited her artistic freedom. Ruth aspired to have full control over her projects, wanting to be her own manager and producer to ensure the quality of her work. This ambition stemmed from her serious dedication to her career in filmmaking. While out on the water with Chessleigh, Ruth pondered about the mysterious events involving the Chinaman and the King of the Pipes, which Chess was investigating.

Ruth and Chess hopped onto land. Both wore quiet canvas shoes. Chess tested his flashlight, illuminating the ground. It worked flawlessly. He kept a secret pistol in his jacket, not telling Ruth. She'd never have come if she knew. Firearms meant danger, not adventure. Ruth doubted the smugglers. Men on a boat seemed harmless. Boxes ashore didn't faze her. Copley hid his suspicions. He shouldn't have brought Ruth. Yet, he sought answers about the island's visitors. As they neared the round stone table, Ruth's unease faded. They found no camp near the beech tree. A nearby voice puzzled them. Ruth heard but couldn't understand the muffled speech. The mystery deepened.|['1.

Carefully descending the slope on the outer side of the island, they left their boat on the inner side. Facing the river's expanse under the soft starlight, they moved quietly, guided by the dim light. With a flashlight, they found a path between boulders. Suddenly, a light ahead startled them. A man with a club appeared, his face menacing in the torch's glow. Ruth realized they were in danger. Despite fear, she stood by Chess, who seemed confused. The man's threatening look chilled her. Ruth refused to abandon Chess. The man's howls signaled more danger. Ruth's resolve to stay by Chess remained firm, even as the situation grew dire.|"['1.

Ruth's wrist was seized by the man, and she tried to pull away, but he was stronger than she thought. With a quick jerk, she was dragged over Copley and into a narrow passage. The head Chinaman grabbed Chess, and he too was pulled inside. Amidst the chattering of high voices and dim torchlight, Ruth realized they were being rushed into a rocky tunnel on the island. The figures guiding them seemed gnome-like in the flickering torches. The old man leading Ruth and dragging Chess revealed a surprising habitation within the cave. Ruth, more concerned about Chess's injury, pretended he was worse off than he was to avoid drawing attention from their captors.

In a hidden cave on an uninhabited island, Ruth and Chess found themselves in a serious predicament. They discovered a group of men, including Chinese smugglers dealing in opium. Chess warned Ruth of the dangers and the strong guards in the cave. He revealed that he was not free to leave due to the fear for his safety. Ruth felt alarmed knowing that more men were expected, possibly more dangerous than the Chinamen. Chess, a king in his own right, shared his struggles with being a ruler.

Ruth recalled the white men in the launch, including Horatio Bilby, whom she now greatly disliked and feared. Although Bilby might not be directly linked to the opium smugglers, Ruth suspected his involvement in illicit activities due to his character. She believed he could be associated with illegal ventures for profit, just as he attempted to abduct Wonota. Despite her concerns, Ruth decided to maintain a facade of calmness to avoid drawing unwanted attention. Meanwhile, Tom Cameron returned to camp and learned about the mysterious events on the island. Eager to investigate, Tom and his sister Helen set out in a canoe to search for the missing motorboat _Lauriette_ among the islands on the river.

Ruth believed the leader of the Orientals was a heavy-set Chinaman who had attacked Chessleigh Copley. The others, some smoking brass pipes, were likely trying to enter the U.S. secretly. They were already in New York, south of the American line. To escape, Ruth hoped to leave before more people arrived. She feared for their safety, knowing the smugglers wouldn't let them go. Chess lay waiting, unharmed. Ruth felt helpless, surrounded by Chinese furniture in the cave. She wondered about hidden passages and other rooms. Their situation seemed dire, with Chess outnumbered.

The elderly man, claiming to be the ruler of the island, suddenly emerged from the corner where he had been observing Ruth and swiftly headed towards the cave entrance. The large Chinaman stood up and faced him. The King of the Pipes gestured through the passage, prompting the Chinaman to communicate with his companions. Most of them scrambled to their feet, except for two who were dazed from drug use. As they turned their attention to the cave entrance, the King of the Pipes disappeared through the passage. Ruth noticed Chess's alert posture and gleaming eyes, wondering about his intentions. Amidst the chaos, Copley stood up abruptly, startling Bilby and the boatman. Copley's determined stance and the sight of his gun unnerved the wrongdoers, who quickly raised their hands in surrender.

Even the two men who were affected by opium quickly became alert when Chess revealed his pistol. The group of Chinamen gathered on one side, while the boatman and Bilby stood on the opposite side of the tunnel's entrance. Ruth followed Chess's instructions and circled around behind the two men. Reluctantly, she disarmed them for safety. Suddenly, Helen appeared and helped Ruth by diverting the attention of one of the men with a weapon. Together, they decided to keep the group contained until the police arrived. Tom and Chess ensured the men stayed put, ready to act if needed.

"Chess Copley was in the middle of a mix-up, but it wasn't even his fault. Bill was the mastermind behind the whole thing, thinking it was a hilarious prank.
