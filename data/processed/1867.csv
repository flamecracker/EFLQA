"Referring to myself as a Goose Girl is a humble title among my many roles as a poultry-maid, a tender of Belgian hares and rabbits, and a shepherdess. The Goose Girl title holds a special place in my heart, evoking memories of German fairy tales from my childhood. After a brief encounter with a stable-boy, I decided to stay in the quaint village of Barbury Green, seeking solace from the bustling world. With money in my purse and daylight ahead, I wandered through the picturesque village, where civic life centers around a duck-pond on the Green. The charming old brick houses, adorned with flowers and bird cages, create a serene atmosphere. The shops, like the general draper's and the old watchmaker's, add to the village's idyllic charm. The draper's shop, with its colourful array of shoes and a dancing baby in the window, epitomizes the village's quaint beauty. The watchmaker's shop, with its revolving trinkets and ivy-covered exterior, exudes a sense of timeless tranquility. The village's unassuming inns, ""The Strong i' the Arm"" and ""The Running Footman,"" offer a quiet retreat, untouched by the guidebooks, adding to the village's enchanting allure."|"['1.

"The innkeeper at the ""Strong i' the Arm"" initially disappointed me by stating there were no available rooms in the village. However, she quickly offered a solution by suggesting a farm nearby. She recommended the Evan's farm just half a mile away, where they might accommodate me as a lodger. I was seeking a simple life and was willing to wait on myself, so I welcomed the idea. Another option was a charming cottage I had visited earlier, where the landlady asked if I would mind sharing her dining room for meals. She preferred to keep her home intact and only accepted paying guests who appreciated the peace and quiet. Mrs. Heaven, the landlady, was a plump and talkative woman, always emphasizing the tranquility of the place. She and her husband were kind but unremarkable, blending into the background like shadows."|"['1.

Phoebe, aged seventeen, is the daughter of the house. She is virtuous, hardworking, conscientious, and lacks physical charm. She appears plain, as if made without a clear purpose, using the wrong materials, poorly assembled, and never properly finished. However, beauty is relative. Some plain girls are married for their looks, while beauties can be considered plain by a critical eye. Phoebe is loved by the Woodmancote carrier, who brings her gifts daily. He is described as having sandy curly hair and a reddish beard. Phoebe reflects on her choice between the carrier and the postman, realizing she almost made a different decision. The household also includes the Square Baby, Albert Edward, who at five years old has a military gait and solid build. The house, Thornycroft House, is irregular and dilapidated, with hidden passageways and a charmingly overgrown garden.|"[""1.

The Belgian hares live in a corner about fifty feet away. There's a large area for poultry just outside the sweetbrier hedge. The rest of the houses and coops are in the meadow at the back, where the tumbler pigeons are kept. Phoebe takes care of the poultry; it's her responsibility. Mr. Heaven isn't capable or skilled enough, and anyone who thinks these qualities aren't necessary in such a humble job should spend a few days at Thornycroft to see. Mrs. Heaven would help, but she's busy with the Square Baby in the morning and night when the young feathered creatures need attention. A Goose Girl, like a poet, can be born or made. I was born one. No training was needed; I went to bed one night and woke up the next morning as a Goose Girl. My destiny was dormant during the day, but at eight o'clock, I heard a loud noise from the duck-ponds. I found Phoebe trying to get the ducks, geese, and other birds to go to bed. They need to be secured in enclosures to protect them from rats and foxes. The older geese are left to roam since they can handle themselves. The hens go to bed on their own, but ducks and geese need help. Phoebe was struggling to get them out of the water, so I stepped in to assist. It was an enjoyable challenge to make them|"['1.

Before I met the live goose, I had a skewed opinion of him due to my previous encounters involving gravy and stuffing. I considered him unjustly maligned, akin to Dreyfus among fowls. My views are evolving, and I suspect Phoebe's geese's peculiarities stem from her outdated teaching methods. At night, the ducks and geese are secured, while the diligent hens retire to their rat-proof boxes. Phoebe has introduced a unique breed of birds, the New Duck, challenging conventional roles. The hens' nurturing nature expands during motherhood, but we may be presuming too much on their goodwill. The hens' maternal instincts sometimes extend beyond their kind, as seen when they care for orphaned chicks or even kittens. Mrs. Greyskin, a cat, unexpectedly displays maternal care by fostering kittens, showcasing the unpredictable nature of maternal instincts.|"[""1.

A poultry farmer from Lancashire arrived at Barbury Green. He stayed at Thornycroft Farm with Mr. Heaven, sharing hen stories and fowl philosophy. One day, the farmer told a tale about a clever hen nest he built. The nest had a false bottom to collect eggs. A black Minorca hen, known for laying well, fell for the trick. After laying an egg, the hen looked down to find it gone. The hen was so upset it never laid another egg in any nest on the farm. The farmer also shared his disdain for the prideful roosters on the farm, finding them lazy and self-centered. He disliked their arrogant behavior, lack of chivalry, and annoying crowing at dawn. In conclusion, the farmer was unimpressed by the roosters' characters and found them more pompous than admirable.|"['1.

The hens on the farm display patience and dignity despite enduring polygamy, an institution offensive to women. Watching the hens climb the ladder to roost is a delightful sight. The process is comical as each hen takes its turn, with some hesitating and others rushing up too fast, only to falter and start over. The male cocks strut around, sneering at the scene. The hens critique each other's methods, while the cocks find humor in the situation. This human-like comedy plays out daily, providing entertainment. The narrative also touches on the dynamics of hen families, such as Catherine of Aragon's plight and a hen's attempt to adopt ducklings. The farm is a place where nature's laws govern even the hearts of hens.|"['Question 1: What is the main theme of the text passage?\nA) The importance of polygamy in hen families\nB) The entertainment provided by hens on the farm\nC) The dignity and patience displayed by hens despite offensive institutions\nD) The superiority of male cocks over hens\nE) The daily routine of hens and cocks on the farm', ""Question 2: How do the male cocks behave towards the hens on the farm?\nA) They show respect and admiration\nB) They critique the hens' methods\nC) They find humor in the hens' actions\nD) They display patience and dignity\nE) They support the hens in their daily routines"", ""Question 3: What is the tone of the passage towards the hens' behavior?\nA) Serious and critical\nB) Humorous and entertaining\nC) Sad and pitiful\nD) Angry and resentful\nE) Confused and uncertain"", ""Question 4: How do the hens interact with each other during the roosting process?\nA) They rush up the ladder too fast\nB) They critique each other's methods\nC) They ignore each other\nD) They help each other climb\nE) They wait for the male cocks to assist them"", ""Question 5: What does the narrative suggest about the dynamics of hen families?\nA) They are always in conflict with each other\nB) They follow nature's laws even in adopting other species\nC) They are governed by the male cocks\nD) They do not have any hierarchy\nE) They are not influenced by external factors"", 'Question 6: What is the overall effect of the hen and cock interactions on the farm?\nA) Sadness and despair\nB) Joy and entertainment\nC) Fear and intimidation\nD) Confusion and chaos\nE) Isolation and loneliness']"|"['C) The dignity and patience displayed by hens despite offensive institutions', ""C) They find humor in the hens' actions"", 'B) Humorous and entertaining', ""B) They critique each other's methods"", ""B) They follow nature's laws even in adopting other species"", 'B) Joy and entertainment']"
Returning to the old nesting-box, I discovered a lone egg left among the shells. Still warm, I hurried across the field to Phoebe with it. The egg squirmed and made sounds as if it would hatch in my hand. Upon reaching Phoebe, the egg burst, and a robust chick emerged. Tending to these young creatures, feeding, and caring for them is heartwarming and rewarding. I believe Phoebe will excel as a wife due to her experiences as a poultry-maid. My time here has transformed me into a better person. Despite recent challenges at the Hydro, I am content in my current surroundings. Life continues without me in Oxenbridge, as expected. I ponder if the hen is content with her ducklings, despite their differences. We are training the chickens to roost on perches to avoid rat encounters. While challenges persist, progress is evident in our efforts with the ducks and geese.|"['1.

Mrs. Heaven doesn't value teachings of great educators like Comenius, Pestalozzi, or Herbert Spencer when it comes to poultry. She disapproved of sending the ducks and geese back to the pond after a chaotic incident. Mrs. Heaven believes educating poultry is a waste of time. She questions if educated poultry will taste better or lay more eggs. The narrator, pondering on Mrs. Heaven's words, fears she might be right. Educating poultry may not make them better. The narrator contemplates if a hen with a larger brain and sense of duty will be leaner. The story delves into the dilemma of Cannibal Ann suspected of eating her own eggs. The narrative also touches on the amusing and sometimes tragic events in the lives of the Belgian hares and the French gentleman partridge married to a Hungarian lady with a visual impairment.|"['1.

Phoebe's flock once had mostly Brown Mallards, but a friend gave her eggs for a variety of white ducks. Only one survived, Lady Blanche, who formed a close bond with a Muscovy drake. They protected a misshapen duckling, Miss Crippletoes, from bullying. Lady Blanche disappeared, leaving the ducklings with Sir Muscovy and Miss Crippletoes. They led the ducklings up to the house, where they found their mother in an ideal nesting spot. The ducks communicated in their unique way, with Miss Crippletoes calling for help and Sir Muscovy responding. Together, they led the ducklings up the steep bank to the house, where they were fed.

At Barbury Green, the town's excitement peaks during summer when a colorful procession of vans arrives on Saturday afternoons. The community gathers for fun activities like rifle-shooting, fortune-telling, and games. The highlight is an orchestrion that plays delightful tunes. Phoebe and I joined in the festivities, spreading joy by treating the children. Despite the heartwarming scenes, the village faced nightmares from the orchestrion's tunes. Later, a nursemaid joyfully welcomed a traveler, enhancing the village's happiness. Such moments of happiness, whether from a baby's laughter or a romantic reunion, enrich everyone's lives. The old parson, a kind soul, shared tales of his peaceful thirty-year marriage, reflecting the tranquility of his home.

In Barbury Green, love is spoken of in a sweet and wholesome way, unlike the town's language. The idea of being a Goose Girl to understand the weed's heart is appealing. Society often feels like watching magic-lantern shows, but here we find peace looking at the stars. Phoebe and I attended a Hen Conference in Buffington to discuss British Hen standards. We talked about different breeds like True and Crossed Minorcas, Feverels, Andalusians, Cochin Chinas, Shanghais, and the White Leghorn. Despite the high price, I considered buying a silver Wyandotte pullet and cockerel as a gift for Phoebe. The conference debated imported eggs and hen diets passionately. I even gave a successful speech on poultry breeding. The handsome young farmer invited us to the R. C. B. O. Club meeting and seemed interested in me, but it turned out he was promoting the Banner Bone Breaker. Phoebe and I left the conference, leaving behind a hint of possible romance.|"['1.

"When we returned home, we got off the carriage to collect hogweed for the rabbits. I relaxed by the roadside while Phoebe gathered the tasty weed growing near nettles and thistles. Workmen passed by carrying their lunch baskets made of bulrushes. Fields of ripening grain surrounded us, shining in shades of green, yellow, bronze, and orange under the sun. As I thought about the word ""letter,"" I took one out of my pocket and skimmed through it. The letter, received late last night, was still in my pocket as I wore the same dress from the day before.

We placed it beneath an apple tree in the side garden, where the scarlet lightning grows tall and the Madonna lilies stand white against the fiery backdrop. We fenced it in, and every afternoon at tea-time, we fill the dishes with seeds and crumbs, the tiny cups with water, and place a cherry on each fruit plate, having a tea party for the birds. Occasionally, we invite an ""invalid"" duckling, a baby rabbit, or the peacock, with cards reading: Thornycroft Farm is a delightful place with fragrant odors and sounds. The scent of hay always lingers, hedges thick with wild honeysuckle, June roses, blackberry blossoms, and ripening fruit. Living with animals encourages good behavior. Animals are civilized and don't make mistakes like humans do. Man is the only animal that makes foolish choices. The bee and the beaver work diligently without causing harm. The bee doesn't have to worry about overcrowded hives or labor issues. The beaver simply works hard without dealing with complex social matters. The Square Baby is fascinated by the sick animals and is keen on learning medical practices. He recently gave medical treatment to the goslings using various remedies like sweet oil, paraffin, and tobacco, showing his interest in the medical field."|"[""1.

Mrs. Heaven caught her son red-handed as she was about to leave for Woodmucket. She delayed her trip to change her clothes, leaving the Square Baby in trouble. Phoebe couldn't go to market due to the sick baby, so I offered to help. Wearing Phoebe's gloves, I set out to deliver eggs and rabbits to various places.

During my trip, Mrs. Sowerbutt's lodgers unexpectedly left for London, causing a hiccup in my plans to take four rabbits with me. However, the Coke and Coal Yard and the Bicycle Repairing Rooms emerged onto the street, asking for weekly deliveries of eggs and chickens. They hoped I could bring them myself. Feeling content, I left Buffington's main street for home. Suddenly, a surprising event unfolded: a verse from the Bailiff's Daughter of Islington. Despite precautions taken to avoid such encounters, the unexpected happened. I had initially forbidden the postmistress to disclose the Thornycroft address, but later lifted the restriction. I began sending mysterious envelopes to someone at the Oxenbridge Hydro, each containing a unique item. These were not meant as inappropriate hints, but rather as tests of wit. I realized I could not tolerate a clueless husband and would prefer lifelong independence over such an alliance.|"[""1.

These were the thoughts that had been running through my mind while I was selling dressed poultry, but they did not prepare me for the appearance of my true love. To see the person I had tried to avoid was surprising. Buffington is far from Oxenbridge, making the encounter even more unexpected. He approached on horseback, looking handsome and determined. We talked, not very freely at first. I joked about my appearance, trying to hide my feelings. He bought rabbits from me, showing impatience. He mentioned finding me at Thornycroft, assuring me he'd get me a farm. He painted a picture of us together, like the Goose Girl and Swan Herd, to be near me. He asked if he could come tomorrow, comparing our meeting to a refreshing drink after a dull time.|['1.
