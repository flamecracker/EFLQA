At the age of fifteen, I moved to a rural village far from home. The next day, a warm September morning greeted me as I wandered into a shady oak and walnut tree forest. The rocky terrain was covered with bushes and young trees, crisscrossed by cattle trails. Following one path led me to a clear spring surrounded by fresh green grass and an oak's shade. A single sunbeam danced on the water's surface, illuminating the sand below. As I peered into the spring, I saw my reflection, but then, a deeper image of a young girl with golden hair appeared, as if the fountain had transformed into a woman. The vision vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving me pondering her existence. The magical encounter left me in awe, wondering if she was a creation of my imagination or a mystical being from the woods.|['1.

I watched and waited, but no vision returned. I left but felt a strange pull, drawing me back to the eerie spring that same afternoon. The water gushed, the sand sparkled, and the sunbeam shimmered. Instead of the vision, a large frog emerged, the hermit of the place, quickly hiding except for his long legs under a stone. He seemed devilish, and I felt the urge to harm him! The Vision's absence haunted me, leading to many sorrowful days. I searched everywhere - by the spring, in the woods, on the hill, and through the village - but she eluded me. Weeks turned to months, yet she remained elusive. I kept my mystery to myself, lost in a world of inner thoughts where the Vision lingered. As I prepared to depart in mid-January, I hoped for a thaw in my frozen heart, yearning for warmth amidst the desolate winter landscape.|['1.
