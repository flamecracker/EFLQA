The sound faded, leaving only the rustle of leaves above. A young man with a rifle stood still, listening for a response after his loud call. No answer came. A squirrel paused, surprised by the intrusion. A shot nearby startled the squirrel away. The man smiled, shouldered his rifle, and left. He soon met a hunter by a brook. The hunter had just shot a goose. They bantered about their luck and plans. The hunter intended to return to the fort and persuade others to join an expedition. The young man wished their brave friend Prince was present to inspire the others. They then lured a goose with calls, but it flew past them.|"['1.

Two young men, Frank and Stanley, were out hunting near a stream that flows into James's Bay in North America. Frank shot a goose, and Stanley teased him about his rifle skills. As they realized a large ice floe was approaching, they hurried to escape in their birch-bark canoe. Stanley paddled quickly, narrowly avoiding the ice crashing on the shore. Frank, carrying his rifle and the goose, decided to take a longer route through the woods instead of risking the canoe. They were heading back to Moose Fort, a remote fur-trading post on an island, where they lived among Muskigon Indians and wild animals. The fort, with its simple wooden buildings and cannons for saluting visiting ships, stood as a solitary outpost in the vast wilderness, isolated from the outside world.|['1.

Moose Fort was a place of contrast; some found it a luxurious palace, while others saw it as a desolate outpost. Frank Morton, who initially despised Moose, grew to love it. Despite being in the company of only about thirty people, Moose was soon to face a new challenge. George Stanley, a fur-trader, was tasked with leading an expedition to the distant Ungava Bay, inhabited by hostile Esquimaux. George, a man of decision and quiet humour, was undeterred by the dangers ahead. His impulsive friend, Frank, eager to join the expedition, was equally enthusiastic.

Once upon a time, a group of men gathered to discuss an expedition to the Huskies. Massan, a backwoodsman, shared a tale of a past mission gone wrong, where the Huskies caused chaos and destruction. As the men debated whether to join the upcoming expedition to Ungava, Francois expressed doubts about the venture. Gaspard, a man of imposing stature, seemed indifferent to their discussions. Despite their concerns, they hesitated to refuse the offer, especially seeing the enthusiasm of Messieurs Stanley and Morton. Stanley, carrying his gear, left the group to ponder their decision. Later, in the fort, Stanley confided in his wife, Jessie, about his inner turmoil. Jessie, raised in the fur countries without access to formal education, was a kind and educated woman. As their daughter's laughter filled the room, Mrs. Stanley's caring nature shone through, sensing her husband's worries and offering him comfort.|['1.

"""And what puzzles you now, dear George?"" she asked, putting down her work and gazing at him with a sincere look that once kindled his heart. ""Not much,"" he answered with a smile. ""These men think Ungava is worse than the land beyond the Styx. After convincing you to stay here for winter, I had to persuade them for the expedition."" ""These men are not cowards, but they hesitate,"" he explained. ""Dick Prince is hunting and won't return for three weeks."" He expressed his troubles to draw her sympathy, saying he'd endure anything for her loving gaze. Stanley kissed his wife, then hung his fowling-piece. Edith showed her mother a drawing of Chimo. She ran to her father, seeking his approval. Stanley invited her to a faraway land with reindeer and long days. Eda was eager, and her parents laughed. Mrs. Stanley didn't feign horror at her child's faults but expressed genuine sorrow. She advised Eda to pray for those she disliked.

Long ago, the Hudson's Bay Fur Company sought peace between the Muskigon Indians of James's Bay and the Esquimaux of Hudson's Straits. The Muskigons, timid by nature, turned fierce due to firearms from fur-traders. Physically superior, the Esquimaux suffered surprise attacks, leading to bloodshed and captives. The Muskigons returned triumphant, while the Esquimaux sought revenge. The fur-traders tried to stop the bloodshed, but failed. The governor of East Main devised a plan to end the violence, hoping for a peaceful resolution. In a hall, Stanley and his men prepared for an expedition, with a mix of determination and uncertainty in the air. The stage was set for a journey that would test their courage and unity.|"['1.

In the past, a fort faced a large group of Muskigons demanding guns and ammunition in exchange for furs to fight the Esquimaux. The governor, angered by this, refused their request and threw their furs away. The Indians, surprised, retaliated by slaughtering cattle. To avoid conflict, traders planned to move to Ungava Bay, a remote area. Mr. George Stanley was chosen to lead the new fort's construction and establish trade. He would navigate through Richmond Gulf, cross rivers, and reach Ungava Bay. The instructions emphasized starting early, traveling with chosen companions, and building shelter in a land possibly inhabited by fierce Esquimaux. Despite the dangers, Mrs. Stanley and her daughter volunteered for the expedition, inspiring the reluctant crew to join.

Stanley smiled at Augustus and mentioned that Franklin's discoveries were not complete yet, hinting at a possible upcoming expedition. Augustus, feeling attached to Franklin for his kindness, hoped to see him again. As they prepared for a journey, Massan warned about an approaching storm that might block their path with ice. The next morning, the ice-filled river and sea looked stunning under the rising sun. Edith admired the beauty, while Mrs. Stanley encouraged Stanley to stay positive. Despite his concerns, Stanley's resolve strengthened as he led the group towards the canoes. The scene was like a city of ice, with various shapes and sizes.

Upon seeing Stanley, his wife, and child approaching, Massan signaled to board the canoes. Each man quickly removed his capote, folded it neatly, and took his seat. After exchanging farewells, they embarked with care. Massan, with a hint of uncertainty, offered his shoulder to Mrs. Stanley as she settled in. Despite his doubts, he was determined not to cast any shadows on their journey. As they set off, Edith, who had been saying goodbye to her friends, suddenly exclaimed. Chimo, the loyal dog, had been napping by the fire but sprang into action upon hearing Frank's whistle. Trapped inside, he eyed the window and with a mighty leap, crashed through it, causing a stir. Free at last, Chimo raced towards the canoes, drawn by the voice of his beloved mistress, Eda. He leaped into Mr. Stanley's canoe, seeking comfort and affection from the little girl.|"['1.

Mr. Stanley smiled at his daughter, Eda, and praised the love of a loyal dog. The canoes set off into the water with Massan steering. They glided through the stream as people on the shore waved goodbye. Dick Prince sang a beautiful song, and the men joined in as they paddled swiftly. The wind changed direction, aiding their journey by keeping the ice at bay. They traveled past the river mouth, along the ocean's coast. The sea was filled with ice, but the canoes navigated through the open water lanes. Steering the canoes was challenging due to the fragile bark sides and brittle pitch seams. Massan, the steersman, was cautious not to damage the canoes. Mr. Stanley expressed concern, highlighting the importance of care, especially if one had loved ones on board.|"['1.

Edith was talking with Chimo about the beauty around them, with her doing all the talking and him all the listening. She asked her father about where they would sleep that night.

Mrs. Stanley praised Eda's speech, stating that making oneself and others happy is fulfilling God's will. Stanley was impressed by this idea. They found a spot to camp for the night due to the ice closing in. The men quickly unloaded the canoes, and just in time, as the ice closed in, blocking their path.

In the icy wilderness, Eda and her companions embarked on a daring journey. As the sun rose above the horizon, its light transformed the frozen sea into a shimmering expanse. Despite the icy waters, they navigated through open lanes, led by Frank and the two Indians. The canoes weaved cautiously, avoiding collapsing ice masses. La Roche's acrobatics and Bryan's initial panic added moments of tension. Chimo, always eager to help, ensured Eda's safety. The group camped in diverse terrains, finding comfort in each location. They hunted for food, feasting on birds and reindeer, much to Bryan's dismay. Respectful of the natives' beliefs, they spared seals, considered sacred. The journey continued, with encounters with polar bears and the challenges of the Arctic environment.|"['1.

One morning near Cape Jones, Mr. Stanley decided to check his instruments before venturing into unknown territory. The calm Arctic air and the sight of ice fields added to the peaceful atmosphere. After a break, Stanley asked Massan to stop for an observation while the men searched for eggs. Massan's loud call amused everyone, and Bryan's even louder response caused laughter. Meanwhile, Stanley's wife and Edith collected shells, while the men smoked, chatted, and hunted for eggs. Bryan and La Roche, sharing a bond, walked ahead to wait for the canoes, discussing their journeys from Ireland to Moose.

Excitement filled the air as Frank Morton emerged from the bushes, ready to finish off the bear he had shot. But to his surprise, the bear was already dead from his precise shot. As they skinned the bear, Frank thanked Bryan for his help. Bryan, the blacksmith, joked about the bear's fat ribs making the task difficult. La Roche, feeling guilty for not helping sooner, joined in the banter. After loading the bear's skin onto the canoes, they continued their journey.

The group faced a life-threatening situation as their canoes struggled against the fierce sea. The wind, though not usually strong, had a wide reach due to the bay's expanse. The canoes, fragile in comparison to boats, were ill-equipped for the rough waters. Despite their efforts, reaching land seemed impossible. Fatigue set in, and hope dwindled. Mrs. Stanley clung to Edith, eyes fixed on the distant cape obscured by ominous clouds. As desperation mounted, Stanley considered turning back. A glimmer of hope emerged as they neared a sand-bank, but the leaking canoes posed a new threat. A thunderous storm added to the chaos. In a harrowing moment, the canoe capsized, plunging them into the sea.

Frank, a devoted angler, possessed an extensive knowledge of his favorite sport. He was well-versed in the intricacies of the rivers and streams near his home, knowing the best spots for fishing within a fifteen-mile radius. As he matured, he equipped himself with a larger basket and a sturdier rod, venturing into the Scottish Highlands to experience the thrill of salmon fishing. Standing by the river, Frank carefully selected a fly and cast his line into the water. To his surprise, he quickly caught a trout, showcasing his skill to his friend Stanley.

Frank and Stanley were out fishing when Stanley was surprised by Frank's technique. Frank instructed Stanley to throw a stone into the water to scare the fish towards them. The plan worked, and the fish darted across the river. Frank skillfully reeled in the fish, showcasing his fishing expertise. The men watching nearby cheered as Stanley successfully gaffed the fish and pulled it onto the rocks. The fish was unique, resembling a trout with beautiful markings. Meanwhile, La Roche, a member of the group, decided to try his luck at fishing using a homemade rod and a peculiar bait made from feathers and a belt tag. His unorthodox approach intrigued the onlookers, and they watched as he cast his line into the water.|[]|[]
"""Oh! a hundred thousand thunders!"" he exclaimed angrily, as the huge hook caught in the leg of his trousers. The large and clumsy barb was deeply embedded, so there was no choice but to use the knife. The second throw was more successful, and the hook landed in the water with a splash that should have scared all the fish away. Instead, a trout darted at it in such a hurry that it barely missed. The Frenchman gave the line a tug in his excitement to catch the fish, pulling the hook out of its mouth. ""Oh! it's a pity, very great; but try again, my boy,"" exclaimed the angler. The next throw produced nothing, but on the third attempt, a salmon grabbed the bait, nearly pulling La Roche's rod out of his hands. Just then, La Roche slipped and fell into the water.

With a hunting spear and kayak nearby, he observed a deer on a cliff. Stealthily, he paddled towards the deer, separating it from the herd with a swift thrust of his spear. Indifferent to cooking, he devoured the deer raw, driven by hunger. His kayak, resembling an arrow, swiftly carried him across the water. The Esquimau's actions, though hasty, displayed his skill in hunting and survival in the vast wilderness.|"['1.

Quickly, though the kayak hurried over the rippling waves, it could not have escaped the messenger of death that appeared ready to pursue it. A dark-skinned, red-painted Indian aimed a gun at the unaware Esquimau as the vessel left the shore. Fortunately, the gun misfired, causing the Indian to angrily attempt to reload. Another Indian, likely a chief, intervened, questioning the need for violence. The Esquimau, unaware of the danger, continued paddling. As he reached the coast and secured his kayak, a young girl greeted him, blushing as he kissed her. Love transcends cultures, displayed in their playful interaction. The Esquimau then retrieved a valuable iron axe from the sand, a rare and treasured possession among his people due to its usefulness in hunting.|"['1.

The young Esquimau made sure his axe was free of rust before securing it in a raw hide belt, a rare accessory among Esquimaux. With the axe in place, he strode out confidently, resembling a decorated hero. His path led to the hut of the tribe's eldest member, where he found the old man listening intently to a conversation with Aneetka, a girl he adored. Though not conventionally pretty, she held his heart with her charm. Aneetka preferred the young giant over a suitor her grandfather favored, sparking tension. The old man, wary of spirits and the mist god, sought the young Esquimau's account of encountering the men of fire. Misled by the Red Indians, the Esquimau unknowingly led them towards his people's dwellings, prompting urgent preparations for escape among the village residents. Amidst the chaos, the young Esquimau claimed his bride, setting off a hurried exodus as the threat loomed closer.|"['1.

The oomiak, also known as the women's boat, is a large and spacious vessel used by the Esquimau to transport their entire household. Unlike the kayak for men, the oomiak is open at the top and is propelled by women using short single-bladed paddles. Despite its clumsy appearance, the oomiak is highly functional and serves as a reliable sea vessel. During a sudden attack by Indian foes, the Esquimaux hurriedly fled to their canoes upon hearing the dogs bark. The Indians, hidden in the bushes, fired a volley of musketry, causing casualties among the Esquimaux. The Esquimaux, terrified by the gunfire, quickly launched their boats to escape.

In the meantime, the Indians were angry and scalped the three dead bodies, throwing them into the sea. They then searched the huts for valuables but found very little. The only useful item they found was an axe left behind by the old grandfather. After looting, the savages destroyed the village and set it on fire before retreating into the bush. A council of war was held, and when an Indian tried to harm the captured Esquimau girl, a young Indian intervened. The Esquimau girl and her captor were taken into the bush by the chief, followed by the rest of the band. The young Esquimau, recovering from his wound, found himself in a boat with his grandfather, children, and dogs. He took control of the boat and paddled back to shore, determined to return to the deserted village.

The Esquimau seal-spear is a unique weapon that showcases the remarkable creativity of the Esquimau people. The handle is crafted from narwal horn or wood, with a detachable head or barb attached to a long line made of walrus hide or sealskin. This barb, made of ivory and iron, detaches from the handle upon striking the animal, staying embedded in the wound while the handle floats away. The Esquimau hunter would approach seals by crawling close to them, then suddenly spring up to strike. The story follows a young Esquimau who successfully hunts a seal for food, despite his exhaustion. Later, driven by the capture of his bride by hostile Indians, he embarks on a perilous pursuit, but eventually loses track of them in the rugged terrain. The tale ends with the Esquimau returning to his people, carrying the weight of his unfulfilled mission.|['1.

Three weeks after the Esquimaux left Ungava Bay, the Canadian voyageurs arrived, singing merrily as they approached a spring by a flat rock. La Roche was the first to step ashore, looking darker and travel-worn. Edith and Bryan also showed signs of rough travel. Gaspard, not paying attention, got hit by a pole and grumbled, causing a commotion. The group set up camp near a spring, and Stanley noticed they were close to the sea. The men split into two canoes to explore the area, one heading towards the sea and the other along the river. They planned to compare findings at night. Chimo, their dog, brought a bird for supper, adding a surprise to their meal. The next day, they set out on an investigative journey to find a suitable spot for a fort.|"['1.

Stanley assured his wife and child that they need not fear, as the camp was well-prepared for any encounters with Indians or Esquimaux. Moses and Oostesimow were ready to communicate with them if needed. Frank was instructed to stay within sight and earshot of the camp while exploring. The group fortified their camp and set off in canoes, leaving some behind to guard the goods. Frank and his men examined the coast, finding an old Esquimau encampment and fresh deer tracks. Massan, eager for a hunt, accompanied Frank. As they discussed using the timber for various purposes, Frank spotted a deer high on a cliff.

In the wilderness, Stanley and his companions embarked on a hunting expedition. As they sought a deer, Frank took a shot, causing the animal to leap off a cliff. Despite the unfortunate outcome, Massan praised Frank's marksmanship and skillfully prepared the deer for their journey back to camp. Meanwhile, Stanley explored the coast, discovering an abandoned Eskimo village. Hoping the natives might return, he left gifts at the site. Back at camp, the aroma of roasting deer and brewing tea welcomed the hungry explorers. The cozy scene by the fire, with Mrs. Stanley and Edith cooking, Chimo observing, and La Roche's lively antics, felt like home to the weary travelers.|"['1.

That evening, there was lively chatter and laughter by the fire as the different groups shared their discoveries and discussed the expedition's prospects. The general consensus was positive, although the barren and rugged landscape raised some concerns. Despite this, the party settled in for the night, comforted by the hearty meal and the excitement of the unknown challenges ahead. The next morning, with the sun rising, the group prepared for a day of exploration and tasks. They split into teams to fish, hunt, and survey the area for resources. Stanley stayed back to oversee and plan the next steps. Mrs. Stanley and Edith busied themselves with tasks at the camp, while Edith collected berries from the surrounding area.

Oolibuck, a chubby and good-natured Esquimau, was sent on a mission by Stanley to keep a lookout for a ship and light a fire to guide it to the right location. Stanley expressed concern that the ship might mistakenly sail into the wrong river instead of the correct one. He provided Oolibuck with four days' provisions and urged him to be a vigilant hunter. Oolibuck, with his eyes disappearing when he laughed due to his chubby cheeks, prepared for his expedition with enthusiasm. Meanwhile, Stanley tasked his men with constructing a smaller canoe to manage the nets more effectively. However, when they checked the nets, they found them tangled due to the river's currents. Determined to catch fish, Stanley decided to set up stake-nets before the tide rose. Frank and Bryan explored the area behind the camp, encountering ptarmigan birds along the way.|"[""1.

Excited by his fishing success, Bryan's adventure took an unexpected turn when he engaged in a fierce battle with a large trout. As the fish darted towards the lake, Bryan chased after it with all his might, tripping over rocks and bushes in his pursuit. The fish's sudden change in direction led Bryan to fall into the water, drenching him completely. Undeterred, he held onto his fishing rod tightly as he continued to follow the fish's movements. Eventually, Bryan managed to drag the fish into shallow water, but the line broke, prompting a physical struggle between man and fish. With determination, Bryan grappled with the slippery trout, finally gaining the upper hand by seizing it firmly and choking it to secure his victory.

Bryan, a skilled fisherman, caught a magnificent trout weighing around twenty pounds. While this was impressive, the lake trout in North America can grow much larger, sometimes reaching sixty pounds. Despite the size, Bryan handled the catch with care and expertise. As the evening approached, the group eagerly awaited the tide to reveal their stake-nets filled with fish. Edith, excited, darted towards the water to help. The successful catch of various fish, including a large salmon, lifted the spirits of the group.

As they made their way towards the camp, the distant voices of some men could be heard, but the darkness obscured their view. Soon, Francois, followed by Augustus and Ma-istequan, emerged into the light around the fire. They set down fat ducks and grouse they had hunted, hanging from their belts. Stanley and Frank welcomed them, noting that supper was ready with a deer Frank had shot. Dick and Massan joined, bringing a deer they had hunted.

"Bryan's arrival was met with laughter, but the real amusement came when he appeared in person. He was completely disheveled, covered in mud and soaked from head to toe, with torn clothes and unrecognizable features. ""Taizy voo, ye petit varmint,"" Bryan said, smiling through the mud on his face as he approached the kettle. Without changing his clothes, the hungry blacksmith started eating supper and revealed a bag with a dozen trout, including a large salmon-sized one. As the group discussed their journey, Francois shared their exploration for game, finding good-sized pines and larch trees suitable for building. They also encountered grouse and ducks, making careful decisions not to overburden themselves. Francois noted the abundance of pines and larch in sheltered gullies, ideal for construction."|"[""1.

"""We saw their marks, and they were not pleasant to look at. After landing above the point, Dick Prince and I ventured up one of the gullies. We climbed a flat area along the mountainside, heading straight up the river. Turning a corner, we spotted a menacing wolf. Both our guns were raised, ready to fire, but we noticed the wolf was staring past us, up a gully. Looking up, we saw a deer on the mountain-top, cautiously checking its surroundings before descending to the water. We observed a well-trodden deer-track down the gully, and the wolf was waiting for its prey. Dick shot the deer, and I took down the wolf. As we were about to leave, we encountered a deserted Indian camp, littered with deer bones. Further ahead, we found ninety-three deer carcasses left by the Indians, who only took the tongues and choice parts, leaving the rest for the wolves. We also spotted deer on the hilltops and fish in the mountain lakes, but we lacked the proper gear to catch any.

After exploring the land, Frank shared his findings with the party, confirming what others had seen. The evidence was reassuring, with ample timber nearby, abundant game in the mountains, and well-stocked lakes and rivers. The fur-traders began constructing their winter dwelling, living off the land and supplies from Moose Fort. Everyone, including little Edith, was busy with chores and building. The fort, shaped like three sides of a square, was taking form with a flagstaff raised in the center. The houses were made of timber frames filled with logs, a simple yet efficient method. The camp bustled with activity as the wood-cutters worked on the dwellings. A wharf was quickly built for Gaspard's nets. Despite some setbacks, like the delayed ship from York Fort, the traders persevered in preparing for the harsh winter ahead.|"['1.

"Stanley, leading his daughter Eda away, proposed to train her in shooting, fishing, and snow-shoe walking to become a trader. Eda was excited about learning snow-shoe walking and Francois making her a pair. She appreciated the kindness of everyone at the fort, even Gaspard. Later, Stanley and Frank watched Eda playing with Chimo on the beach. They discussed naming the fort, suggesting ""Chimo"" after the Esquimau word for friendliness. Eda and Chimo then ventured towards a hill for a better view of the fort. In the distance, they spotted a schooner approaching through the narrows, firing a cannon shot that echoed through the mountains.

Repeatedly, a loud cheer erupted from the fort, met by a response from the schooner. This was no mere formality; the deep, energetic tone revealed the men's intense emotions. It signaled relief from mounting anxieties and joy at the sight of friendly faces in a desolate land where foes might lurk. The arrival of a ship in port is always stirring, but when it's a lifeline for those watching, with its first voyage to their bay, emotions run high. Cheers echoed among the mountains of Ungava, even Edith's voice joining in. Tears welled in bronzed cheeks, despite iron wills. The bustling scene at Fort Chimo intensified after the schooner's arrival, with the captain recounting the crew's near mutiny due to ice delays.

La Roche, in a state of dramatic despair, worried about cooking for everyone the next day due to lack of sleep. The blacksmith, excited about the feast, accidentally knocked La Roche's pipe out of his mouth. At dawn, Massan, Dick Prince, and Bryan set off to hunt. By midday, they returned with loads of venison and fish for the feast. Bryan, known for falling into water, arrived wet from fishing. Cooking began with Bryan and La Roche showing off their skills. Despite mishaps, the food preparation carried on. Bryan ingeniously split an oversized pudding into two kettles. The blacksmith, cutting down another pudding, made sure there was enough to eat.

La Roche and Bryan prepared a feast at Fort Chimo, where the lack of traditional dining furniture didn't dampen the spirits of the guests. The makeshift table, made of packing cases, and nail-kegs for seats were humble but functional. The meal featured a variety of delicacies like salmon, lake-trout, venison, cranberry jam, goose, pease-pudding, and a selection of wines and spirits. The sailors from the ship joined the voyageurs and indigenous people, creating a lively atmosphere with a mix of cultures and languages.

The blacksmith nodded in agreement as he accepted the tool, acknowledging the scarcity of women in the area. He explained that the sailors had agreed to portray the lovely ladies for the event as they were shorter and wore wide breeches resembling petticoats. Stories were shared, songs sung, and dances performed that night under the influence of limited rum, ensuring no hangovers the next day. As dawn approached, a sense of melancholy settled as the schooner readied to depart. The sailors boarded, bidding farewell with a subdued cheer as a gun signaled the ship's departure. In the following days, the fort was swiftly completed, preparing for winter with hunting and fishing expeditions. Stanley's concerns about the absence of the Esquimaux were dispelled when they unexpectedly arrived in canoes, signaling a new chapter of peace and trade.|['1.

Stanley ventured down and entered one of the oomiaks, bearing beads and trinkets. While Oolibuck entertained the men on land, Stanley gifted the women, who joyfully received the offerings. The natives displayed childlike delight, dancing, singing, and embracing with abandon. Their carefree nature contrasted sharply with their reserved Indian neighbors. As Stanley shared gifts, the women crowded into the oomiak, nearly capsizing it. They revealed chubby babies hidden under their hoods, seeking attention. The group eventually disembarked, encountering Mrs. Stanley and Edith, intrigued by their attire. The Esquimau women wore sealskin shirts, breeches, and boots with long tails, unlike Mrs. Stanley's tailless gown. Despite initial surprise, they grew more comfortable and appreciative, accepting the gifts gratefully.

When the next day arrived, the people at Fort Chimo warmly welcomed the return visit from the Esquimaux. The natives were greeted with great excitement and joy, especially by the children at the fort. Despite their childlike enthusiasm, the Esquimaux displayed a strong and manly demeanor in their actions, with many of the men sporting thick black beards that were anything but childish. The children mirrored their parents in dress, appearing as miniature versions of them. Bryan, a worker in iron, quickly became a favorite among the natives, receiving unique and sometimes puzzling gifts. The Esquimaux traded sealskin boots and other clothing for goods at the fort, showcasing their valuable items. Little Edith, particularly fascinated by the Esquimaux, shared her belongings with them and even made friends with two Esquimau girls, introducing them to her dog Chimo and her favorite berries.|['1.

Edith had a unique bond with her young Esquimau friends, communicating through expressions rather than words. Their shared joy over delicious berries or distaste for sour ones was evident in their bright eyes and expressive faces. Despite the language barrier, the trio understood each other's emotions, whether it was the excitement of discovering new places or the fear of steep cliffs. The Esquimau children, dressed in loose deerskin shirts and wide boots, were a stark contrast to Edith, who wore a blue frock and a traditional Cree head-dress.

Maximus, a skilled hunter, was asked to stay at the fort while Moses inquired about a group of Esquimaux attacked by Indians nearby. Maximus, usually calm, turned grave as he recounted the tragic event where his people were slain, his wife lost. He identified a piece of sealskin from the Indian camp. Excited shouts about Esquimaux hunting deer reached the fort. Stanley, Frank, and La Roche hurried to the river, witnessing the Esquimaux driving deer into the water for slaughter. The Esquimaux expertly used kayaks to corral and spear the deer. Chacooto, a prominent Esquimau, displayed remarkable skill in leading the hunt, swiftly dispatching the captured deer.

"""Oh, the scoundrel!"" exclaimed a voice near Frank. ""He really knows how to handle it, no doubt. His spear moves swiftly and precisely, never striking more than once, that savage!"" ""He's quite skilled, Bryan,"" Frank replied. ""It's reassuring that his strikes are swift. I prefer not to witness unnecessary cruelty in such tasks."" Frank chuckled at Bryan's eager but clumsy attempts. ""Now, Bryan, take your time. Aim just behind the shoulder, a bit lower, as that gun kicks hard."" ""By the saints! Oh, Bryan, you're too clever, you are!"" Bryan corrected his aim with force, almost losing his grip. A sharp crack followed, and the deer fell lifeless at the edge of the willows. ""Forgive me, Bryan,"" Massan said, reloading his gun. ""I wouldn't have stolen your shot if you were ready. But one more leap, and the deer would have been out of range."" ""You deserve to be hanged for murder, Massan,"" Bryan teased. ""Gentlemen from the old country give the creatures a chance before shooting. You savages kill them on the spot when they're just a few yards away. Shame on you, Massan."" ""Look, Massan,"" Frank pointed to another deer on the heights. ""That one is too far for us now.

The hunt was a success, and the deer were all killed, except for the last ones that entered the river. The remaining deer returned to the shore. The evening was spent skinning and cutting up the carcasses, which required time, skill, and effort. Maximus, now known as Stanley, returned from an unsuccessful trip to the Indian camp and helped with the work. Although he didn't mention his visit to the deserted camp, his sad expression hinted at what he saw. The deer meat was timely as the frost was setting in, allowing it to freeze for winter. The Esquimaux celebrated with feasting and joy, although their camp was messy. They were honest but not very clean. They had tents made of skins and stored food in piles. The dogs eagerly awaited soup from a large kettle as the people enjoyed the deer meat. The successful hunt was marked by a small distribution of spirits. The Esquimaux were honest in their dealings, returning lost items and even useless scraps. Despite their begging, they were encouraged to hunt for more valuable furs.|"['1.

A few days after a successful deer hunt, groups of Esquimaux arrived at Fort Chimo and camped with their companions. This sudden arrival quickly depleted the venison supply, but hunting parties ensured a constant abundance of game. Stanley generously gave beads and tobacco to the visitors and encouraged them to hunt for furs, but they preferred staying put. The newcomers, along with the initial group, totaled about three hundred and were found to be peaceful and honest. One day, when Stanley was out in his boat, he was alarmed by loud cries from the shore. The Esquimaux had rushed into the fort, apologizing for a child breaking a window. They offered a large dog as compensation, insisting it be accepted. The Indians also arrived, firing a salute, providing an opportunity for Stanley to mediate between the two groups.|"[""1.

The leader of the Indian group stood out from the rest by wearing a flamboyant and eccentric outfit that didn't impress the traders. Despite the admiration of his companions, his attire, which included a scarlet coat with gold embroidery, blue trousers, and a hat adorned with silver and gold cords, did not enhance his dignity. The Indian chief, exuding importance, maintained a dignified demeanor. After an invitation from Ma-istequan, the chief declined to come down, citing the outnumbering Eskimos. Stanley then addressed the natives, emphasizing reconciliation between the Innuit and the Allat (Indian name). The Esquimaux agreed to treat the Indians hospitably. Despite initial reservations, the Indians eventually engaged in peace talks and exchanged gifts with the Esquimaux at Fort Chimo. The traders noted the Indians' reluctance contrasted with the Esquimaux's openness. Eventually, the Indians shared information about hunting grounds after being offered tobacco. The Indians and Esquimaux fostered a friendship, although occasional thefts strained relations. An influenza outbreak among the traders spread to the Esquimaux, resulting in ten deaths, altering the dynamics between the groups.|"[""1.

One day, Edith visited her little friend Arnalooa at the camp, bringing beads to console her. The next day, Edith returned with a native basket, but soon after, she ran back home in a panic. Edith explained to Stanley and Frank that she found the camp deserted, with eight dead bodies left out in the open and two buried under rocks. Frank shared that the Esquimaux believed a disease struck them when they entered the river, causing many deaths. The natives planned to flee to False River to avoid the illness. Frank also mentioned the Moravian missionaries who once considered setting up a trading-fort in the area. The missionaries' practice of combining trade with religion puzzled Frank, who believed missionaries should focus solely on spreading Christianity. Stanley, however, defended the missionaries, suggesting that traders might still share their faith with the natives in private.|"['1.

Frank admitted that he may have been unfair in his judgment of fur traders and reflected on his own shortcomings. Stanley agreed, highlighting the importance of self-reflection. The group prepared for the upcoming winter, with some focusing on hunting and fishing. Edith and her mother kept busy with various tasks, while the traders worked on fort improvements. The changing season brought joy to Edith as she reminisced about past winters spent at Moose Fort. The sight of snow outside her window evoked fond memories of playing in the snow and adventures with her friends and father's dogs. The sudden appearance of snow brought a rush of nostalgia and happiness to Edith's heart.|"['1.

Winter had now arrived in Ungava with a firm grip. The frost had been so strong for weeks that all lakes and pools were frozen thick, and even the salt bay had a growing layer of ice. The falling snow marked the beginning of winter's true reign. But the sunny days were short-lived. The sea's rolling fogs covered the sky, revealing the harsh reality of the northern winter. The landscape was blanketed in snow, with cliffs, peaks, and valleys all covered. Despite the dark rocks and icy river, life within Fort Chimo was bustling. The water-drawer, carpenters, and blacksmith were all busy, showing that winter's grip couldn't dampen their spirits. La Roche, with his fur cap and mittens, was preparing firewood, while joking with Bryan in the blacksmith's shop. The scene inside the fort was warm and lively, contrasting the cold outside. The day's excursion was to check the lake for fish and give little Edith a carriage ride for her health, as her mother knew her daughter longed for the company of children her age.|"[""1.

After breakfast, Frank led Edith to the kennel to release Chimo, who would pull Edith's sled. Passing the spring, Edith paused to see the snow-covered spot. A dome of ice had formed over the spring, rising to about twelve feet. Frank cut a block of ice, revealing a beautiful blue cave. Edith suggested making it a sitting room. They laughed and explored the icy palace. Frank checked it for practical use while Edith admired the walls and the spring. They continued to the dog kennel where a sled, like those used by the Esquimaux, awaited. The sled had wooden runners attached with sealskin thongs and was sheathed with mud and water that froze into a durable coating. This method was common among the Esquimaux for winter travel.|"['1.

Esquimau sledges are usually heavy and require large teams of dogs, but Edith's sledge was small and light, perfect for her and her dog, Chimo. During a trial trip, Chimo ran off with Edith, leading Frank on a chase. However, their plans for a trip were halted by a snowstorm, a fierce one unlike any seen before. The storm began with a mournful sigh, foretelling the desolation it would bring. Frank, to cheer up Edith, set up a draught-board by the warm stove in the cozy hall of Fort Chimo. The hall was now a comfortable place with deerskin carpets, fur coats hanging on the walls, and a glowing stove. Mrs. Stanley sat sewing a hunting coat, while preparations for tea were made. The hall felt secure and welcoming, a refuge from the storm outside.|"[""1.

On a stormy night at Fort Chimo, the howling winds and swirling snow created a scene of chaos and darkness. The men huddled by the stove, surrounded by their gear and weapons. Meanwhile, the party in the hall enjoyed their supper, shielded from the fierce elements outside. The two silent Indians smoked their pipes, unmoving amidst the uproar. Gaspard and Prince tried to peer out the window, but the frost obscured their view. In the midst of this tempest, a lone traveller, Maximus the Esquimau, braved the storm to help a sick old woman. Battling the fierce winds and blinding snow, Maximus pressed on, seeking shelter in the unforgiving landscape. Buried under layers of snow, he fought to survive, a testament to the resilience and determination of the human spirit in the face of nature's fury.|"['1.

That night, a fierce storm raged in the mountains, but the next day the wind calmed, and the sun brightly lit up the grey rocks and snow. Two mock suns shone on either side of the sun. Despite this, the fur-traders' dwellings remained dark. Stanley, realizing they were snowed in, suggested using the chimney to escape. However, the chimney was blocked. With Edith and her mother joining, they worked to dig a tunnel to the surface. After much effort, they saw light above. When La Roche accidentally caused the roof to collapse, letting sunshine in, they rescued him from the snow. Eventually, they all emerged from the tunnel into the open day.|"['1.

The scene that greeted their eyes was peculiar but not entirely satisfying. All that remained visible of Fort Chimo were the chimneys and the flagstaff. The overall look of the area had changed little, with the snow drifts shifting and growing without drastically altering the rugged landscape. The gale had exposed some mountain cliffs while burying others, and the lake was cluttered with more icebergs than usual. After a moment of silence, Stanley instructed La Roche to fetch a shovel to dig out the trapped men. As they prepared to start, a strange sound beneath the snow caught their attention. Suddenly, a man emerged from under the snow, startling everyone. Laughter erupted as they rescued the men from their snowy prison. Despite the laughter, they knew they had a lot of work ahead to clear the fort's buildings of the heavy snow drifts.|"['1.

Arctic travelers who lose their way sometimes burrow in the snow to survive the night. The Esquimaux often do this too, but prefer building snow-houses if possible. In this tale, a boy named Frank gives medicines to an old woman and then heads to a lake for ice fishing. The weather is fine, and he prepares to go the next day. Frank takes his little sister, Edith, on a sledge ride. Edith is warmly dressed in fur and blankets, looking chubby and cute. The journey is rough, with steep ravines and snowy terrain. Chimo, their dog, falls into a fissure but is saved. Frank uses a pole to check for hidden dangers as they continue their adventurous journey.|"['1.

In the afternoon, they reached the lake for camping and were thrilled to find Maximus already there. With little wood around, they decided to build a snow-house on the ice. The lake, surrounded by hills and snow-covered, had no trees. Maximus started building the igloos, drawing circles and cutting snow blocks. Edith watched in awe as the structures took shape. Frank returned from a hunt to help, and in two hours, the igloos were ready. They had doors and windows made of clear ice. Edith excitedly explored the snow bedroom, wondering if the bed would be made of snow too.|['1.

"""We will make the bedsteads of snow, Eda,"" replied Frank, ""but I think we shall manage to find blankets of a warmer material. Now, Maximus, get the things put inside, and the lamp lighted, for we're all tired and very hungry.""

The lamp that Frank mentioned was one Maximus had brought from the Esquimau camp. It was made of soft stone, resembling a half moon, about eight inches long and three broad, hollowed out inside. Esquimaux use these lamps to burn seal-fat for warmth and cooking. The heat from the lamps, combined with the inhabitants' warmth, can be so intense that they need to remove some clothing. Maximus prepared the lamp with seal-fat, lighting it to illuminate the igloo. Frank placed a kettle filled with snow on the lamp to melt water for tea. Edith and Frank arranged the bedding on the snow floor, using deer-skin robes and blankets for comfort. The igloo also featured a snow table covered with food, including pemmican, salmon, ship-biscuits, and tea. The cozy atmosphere inside the igloo, lit by the moonlight, made Frank and Edith feel snug and comfortable."|['1.

Maximus, the Esquimau, showed Frank and Edith how to build a winter house. After supper, Chimo, their companion, enjoyed the scraps. Frank and Maximus prepared their sleeping area while Edith arranged her dormitory. Frank read from his Bible as they settled down for the night. In the cold, wild spot, the group found comfort and warmth. During the night, the men's deep voices faded as they slept. Frank awoke to a wolf outside, but it quickly vanished. Startled by the cold, he hurried back inside. The next morning, they set hooks in the ice to fish. Maximus worked hard to cut through the thick ice while Frank went for a walk. The anglers used large hooks baited with seal-fat and quickly caught fish.|['1.

Frank caught a white-fish and a lake-trout while fishing with Maximus and Edith. Maximus struggled with a huge fish that put up a fierce fight. After a challenging battle, Maximus finally succeeded in pulling the massive sixty-pound trout out of the icy water. Frank swiftly speared the fish to secure it. They cleaned the fish, and as daylight faded, they decided to head back. Frank thanked Maximus for his help and sent him on his way back to False River. That evening, Frank, Edith, and their dog Chimo enjoyed a cozy meal in the igloo. They shared stories and laughter by the warm glow of the lamp. Frank planned for an early start the next day for a full day of fishing, unaware of the surprises that awaited them.|['1.

Upon waking in the morning, the travelers heard the familiar howl of the wolf that had visited them the day before. Maximus, determined to catch the wolf, had crafted a trap unique to the Esquimaux people. It was a hole dug through the ice near their igloo, just wide enough for a wolf to enter but deep enough to prevent it from reaching the tempting blubber placed at the bottom. Attracted by the scent of the meat, the wolf cautiously approached the trap at daybreak. Despite his efforts, the wolf's greed led to his demise as he got stuck in the hole, unable to free himself. In the end, the wolf met his unfortunate fate due to his insatiable hunger and the unforgiving cold.|"['1.

After a thrilling event where a wolf devoured its companion, Frank rushed to chase it, leaving Edith alone in the wild. Edith, accustomed to solitude, remained calm, preparing breakfast in their icy dwelling. As she awaited Frank's return, the sun rose, casting light on the lake's shore, but Frank was nowhere in sight. Anxious, Edith boiled fresh trout and made tea, growing concerned as time passed without Frank's return. Fearing the worst, she imagined various dangers he might face. Although comforted by the thought that Maximus would come to the hut, Edith's worry for Frank intensified as the silence of the desolate surroundings weighed heavily on her heart.|"['1.

The morning passed, the sun rose, and the day neared its end. Frank hadn't returned, causing Edith anxiety. She returned to the igloo, crying on the deerskin couch. Suddenly, Chimo, the dog, rushed in and comforted her. Edith, hopeful, asked Chimo about Frank. The dog's behavior puzzled her, running around aimlessly. Chimo led Edith outside, hinting at something. Edith followed, ignoring the danger. Chimo guided her to the ravine where Frank had been. Edith found a wolf's remains from Frank's snow-trap earlier. She put on snow-shoes, and Chimo led her up the ravine. Despite the harsh terrain, Edith's determination to find Frank kept her going. As they advanced, Edith's resolve grew, and she navigated the mountains with newfound strength, hoping to reunite with Frank.|"[""1.

For almost two hours, Chimo guided Edith through the mountains. The scenery grew more rugged as they advanced, with steep cliffs and dark gorges covered in snow. As daylight faded, stars lit their path. Following Frank's snowshoe trail, they reached a cliff where Chimo veered left. Edith followed, and Chimo led her down a steep path to find Frank at the bottom. Chimo alerted Edith to a wolf near Frank, which fled upon her scream. Edith tended to Frank, who had fallen due to a snow-covered gap. She cleaned his wound and frostbite, calling out to him until he stirred. Chimo comforted Frank, who initially mistook him for a threat. Edith, in tears, warmed Frank and tended to his cold hands until he slowly regained consciousness.|"['1.

Frank, feeling disoriented, asked Edith where they were after what seemed like a fall. Slowly regaining his senses, he urgently expressed the need to return to the igloo to avoid freezing. Despite his efforts, he struggled to walk, often unintentionally pushing Edith down. Overcoming her own exhaustion, Edith persisted, helping Frank move forward in their harsh environment. Eventually, they reached the lake's edge, where Frank's condition worsened. Edith hurried back to the igloo, heated tea, and tended to Frank, who, after drinking the warm beverage, regained strength. With Chimo's help, they made it back to the igloo, where Frank rested. Edith stayed by his side, watching over him as they both drifted into a peaceful sleep.|"['1.

Edith woke up to find Frank still unwell. He managed to speak faintly, telling her how he fell over a cliff and fought off a wolf. Edith, acting like a caring sister, tended to him for two days, but his condition worsened. Worried, she decided to find the Esquimau village to get help. Despite Frank's poor state, she set out alone with her dog, Chimo. Edith believed the village was nearby and that Chimo would guide her. As she journeyed, the heavy snowfall made it hard to see. Exhausted and disheartened, she thought she found the village but discovered it was just willows. Overwhelmed, she wept but knew she had to find her way back.

Chimo was faithful and responded to the cry by bounding towards it. However, his progress was halted by the sledge getting stuck among rocks. Despite Chimo's efforts, the sledge remained immovable. Edith, unable to hear Chimo's cries due to the rising wind, frantically searched for her sledge. Overwhelmed, she fell to her knees realizing she was lost in the snow. Three days later, the fort was filled with sorrow as Frank Morton was found alone and Edith missing. Despite the heavy snow erasing tracks, a search party was organized. Frank, upon learning of Edith's disappearance, tried to help but was too weak. The search continued for weeks, with no sign of Edith. The fort remained in sorrow, with hope fading for the child's return.|"[""1.

They often spoke optimistically about her, concealing their true feelings. Frank, silent, walked to the window. The scene outside was peculiar. The lake had frozen overnight, and the icebergs were crashing through the thin ice towards the river. Some icebergs were huge, passing dangerously close to the fort. The rising tide created spouts of spray, resembling cannons firing. Frank expressed a strange belief that Eda might still be alive. Suddenly, the sound of bells announced the arrival of two Indians with sled dogs. They had seen an Indian camp with a flower from Esquimaux fields. Stanley realized the need to send dispatches to headquarters and pondered the challenge of guiding the Indians back safely.|"['1.

Frank initially objected to the plan as it would hinder his search for Edith. Stanley convinced him that his presence at headquarters was crucial. Reluctantly, Frank obeyed. He planned to travel overland to Richmond Gulf with Maximus, Oolibuck, and Ma-istequan. They would rely on hunting for food. The island they visited was inhabited by Esquimaux, living in igloos. Edith was found in an ice hut. She got lost, reached the ice edge, and was rescued by Esquimaux. They had missed Fort Chimo and found her tracks. The Esquimaux lived in a village resembling beehives, with kayaks and tools around. The igloos were built for warmth, not space. Edith was found by chance and rescued by the Esquimaux.|"[""1.

Words cannot fully describe the astonishment of the native people as they saw the unfamiliar fair child. They realized she needed warmth, so they carefully lifted her onto a sleigh surrounded by furs. The women and children covered her and rubbed her limbs to revive her. Meanwhile, the six sledges with twenty dogs each sped away over the frozen sea, the dogs yelping in fear. As Edith awoke and tried to understand her situation, the natives watched her with curiosity, unable to comprehend her language. Edith, in turn, hoped that the natives would convey news of her to the fur-traders. She crafted whalebone medals with her name for the tribe's leaders to wear, hoping it would lead to her rescue.

Edith and her doll were interrupted by Peetoot, who burst in like a wild man, pointing excitedly towards the shore and uttering unintelligible sounds. Confused but curious, Edith followed him outside. She quickly realized they were going on a sled ride. Edith, Peetoot, and Annatock settled onto the large sled, pulled by a team of fifteen dogs. The sled was ingeniously crafted with rawhide and the dogs were harnessed in a specific order. The whip cracked, and the dogs dashed off over the frozen sea. Edith marveled at the sled's design and the skill of the driver, Annatock, who expertly managed the team with the long lash.

Annatock, a skilled hunter, wielded his whip with deadly accuracy, causing fear among the dogs and swiftly disciplining them. With a crack like a gunshot, he could bring down the whip on a skulking dog, sending the pack into a yelping frenzy. As they raced across the icy landscape, Annatock's team galloped at full speed, with Edith captivated by the thrilling chase. Upon reaching a group of Esquimaux hunters, Edith observed one preparing to spear a seal. Tied to the seal spear, the hunter was poised for a fierce battle. With a swift motion, the hunter speared the seal, engaging in a tug-of-war until emerging victorious. Further along, Annatock spotted a walrus and cleverly approached it as stealthily as a seal, only to discover it was already frozen.

In the Arctic, walruses often surface through ice holes to breathe and rest, relying on their thick fat for warmth. But when the ice freezes over their holes, they face a tragic fate. Annatock, an Inuit man, and his young companion Peetoot encounter a massive walrus trapped on the ice. The walrus, with its tusks and fierce appearance, is a formidable opponent.

The Esquimaux have a unique custom where every animal hunted is considered communal property. The successful hunter gets the first pick, but everyone shares in the bounty. Annatock knew that once he signaled, the entire village would rush to collect their share. The villagers wasted no time and quickly harnessed their dogs to head to the hunting grounds. The women, who had been on short rations, sang with joy at the news of the successful hunt. The return was equally swift, with the villagers dragging the walrus and seal carcasses back to camp. Peetoot, in high spirits, rode triumphantly on a seal, celebrating their success. The village erupted in a feast, with everyone enjoying the abundance after weeks of scarcity. Edith, despite the unfamiliar surroundings, found joy in the happiness of her hosts and shared a hearty meal with them.

This eventful day was marked by another triumph for Annatock and his nephew, who set out on foot to the site of the previous day's battle. Edith chose to stay back and care for the baby, making amends for her absence the day before. Upon arriving at the spot where the walrus was taken down, Annatock secured a portion to bring back to camp. While busy with this task, Peetoot rushed over, claiming to have spotted a seal on the ice ahead. Armed with weapons, they investigated but found the seal gone. Undeterred, they noticed fresh animal tracks on the ice. After a brief discussion, Peetoot, displaying determination, followed the tracks, with Annatock close behind. Their pursuit led them out of view, but they encountered a polar bear. Despite initial hesitation, Peetoot bravely faced the bear, prompting Annatock to join in the daring attack, resulting in a successful hunt.|"['1.

Annatock stood leaning on his spear, watching the bear with satisfaction, while Peetoot laughed and danced around like a maniac. His uncle ended the antics by tapping Peetoot's flank with the spear's butt. Peetoot howled, dashed off to share the news and get a sled for the bear. Back at the village, a feast began, dwindling as the food decreased. The weather warmed, melting snow and ice. Changes occurred in the Esquimaux customs. Women switched to waterproof boots, and men wore wooden spectacles to avoid snow-blindness. They readied skin tents and boats. Boys were scolded for damaging snow-houses. Edith fed her adopted baby seal-fat, undercooked for the baby's taste. Peetoot's disobedience led to a disastrous collapse, prompting the Esquimaux to move to sunnier grounds.

Edith sat by the sea, watching the waves glisten in the summer sun. Icebergs lingered as remnants of winter. The sea birds circled the blue ice peaks.

As she had done many times before, Edith paused and wept, but her hope was strong. She believed deliverance would come eventually. Edith prayed for help, a lesson from her mother.

Maximus and his companions were struggling to move forward with their sled dogs through the thickening snow. The dogs were tired, and even Chimo, the lead dog, was exhausted. Maximus, quick to think, tied a ptarmigan to his belt and walked ahead, encouraging the dogs with the scent of the bird. The dogs perked up and pulled the sled with renewed energy. As night fell, they set up a snow-house reminiscent of the one they built before. They fed the dogs and managed to kindle a fire briefly for supper. With no wood for another fire, they resorted to a clever trick - filling a bottle with snow to melt for water overnight. The next morning, they caught fish through a hole in the ice, providing a hearty meal for all.

Maximus and Aneetka found refuge in a cave, shielded by a rock ledge. Chimo, their loyal dog, joined them. The Indians, pursuing them, spotted Chimo and charged up the slope.

For almost an hour, silence enveloped Maximus and his companions as they speculated about the movements of the hidden Indians. They remained concealed in their refuge until nightfall, striving to make the place more comfortable and cleaning their weapons. From the cave's entrance, they spied their canoe on the beach. As they observed an Indian sneaking towards it, Maximus swiftly shot him, dissuading any others from approaching due to the imminent danger. Throughout the day, both sides strategized ways to outwit each other, with heightened vigilance as night approached. Maximus devised a plan to exploit the dog's howling to mislead the Indians. With the night growing darker and the sky obscured by clouds, Maximus readied his gun, aiming at the canoe with precision, preparing for their daring escape.|"['1.

In silence, the two women glided into the darkness, following Maximus's signals. He fired shots to mislead the pursuing Indians. Maximus swiftly launched the canoe with his wife and the old woman aboard, ready to escape. The Indian, Meestagoosh, tried to stop them but was subdued by Maximus. Maximus, unable to swim, used his dog, Chimo, to pull him out to sea. The Indians, unable to find him, heard a cry and a splash.

After their daring escape, Maximus and his companions journeyed safely. They left Indian territory and were nearing their own lands. However, the battle against the harsh elements of the Arctic was far from over. Traveling along the coast was treacherous, with storms and drift-ice constantly testing their resolve. Maximus and his faithful companions, Aneetka and Moggy, persevered through challenges. They relied on hunting and fishing for survival, often just having enough to get by. Along the way, they helped fellow Esquimaux and traders, spreading news of a new fort and fostering goodwill. As they approached Ungava Bay, they encountered more tribes and shared in the joy of successful hunts and valuable fur trades. The reunion with old friends brought immense happiness, especially for Chimo, the loyal dog, who couldn't contain his excitement at seeing his young mistress again.|['1.

Years have passed since the fur-trader's song first echoed through Ungava. The landscape remains unchanged, with deer roaming in summer and frost enveloping the air in winter. However, Fort Chimo, once a beacon of hope, now lies abandoned. Stanley, who once oversaw the area, departed for another station due to changes in the Fur Company. A Scottish Highlander succeeded him, but despite his efforts, the station was deemed unprofitable. The fort was dismantled, leaving only a green patch as a reminder of its existence. The characters dispersed, with Stanley retiring to a farm in Canada. Edith, his daughter, grew into a beautiful and unattainable woman.
