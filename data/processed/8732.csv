The start of the 19th century was a challenging time for British workers due to heavy taxes from the war and high food prices. Improved machinery, while boosting trade, initially caused distress among hand workers who blamed it for their troubles. This led to the Luddite Riots, where workers sought to destroy machinery and revert to old methods. In Yorkshire, the croppers were part of this movement. The story shifts to Mr. Hathorn's academy in 1807 Marsden, Yorkshire. Boys wore breeches and tight jackets, bearing signs of tears and dirt from canings. Mr. Hathorn was known for his strict discipline, using the cane vigorously. Despite hating their master, the boys accepted caning as a common practice. Mr. Hathorn believed in providing ample food to keep his students healthy and ready to learn.|"['1.

Punishment can lose its effectiveness if it's given too much. At Hathorn's school, all boys faced some level of punishment, with no one able to avoid it entirely. The pain became routine, and the boys would quickly forget it once it was over. Edward Sankey, a home boarder, was an exception due to his father's unique circumstances.

In the past, factories were rare, with men working at home and using their families' help. The need to travel long distances to steam-powered mills added to their unhappiness. Two friends, Tompkins and Ned, went fishing in a stream far from town. They struggled to catch fish with worms, not realizing trout are caught with flies in clear water. After a fruitless day, they decided to head home. While trying to find a shortcut, they ended up in a desolate valley. They encountered a large man who blocked their way, warning them of danger ahead. When Tompkins resisted, the man struck him, ending the confrontation.

Threats of revenge were made against a girl at school, and when a cat was found dead, students suspected each other. The boys likely to have done it claimed innocence. Mr. Hathorn punished all until the culprit confessed. The boys were innocent; the cat was attacked by a cook and left for dead. Ned thought punishing all was unjust.

For a few days, things stayed the same at the school. The playground was quiet, no more laughter or shouting. The boys were gloomy, focusing on their studies. They felt desperate. The mystery of the cat's demise remained unsolved, and the schoolmaster was determined to break their spirits. Ned Sankey didn't share his struggles at home. His behavior changed, rushing off after meals and staying silent about his activities. One day, Ned decided they couldn't endure it any longer. He led a rebellion, throwing his book into a tree, sparking a wave of defiance among his peers. The boys united, refusing to do extra tasks and standing up against unjust punishment.

The lawyer prepared to present evidence to the judges, explaining that more than half of the boys at the school were caned daily, causing distress. He mentioned a boy who meticulously recorded the daily canings, highlighting the excessive punishment. The lawyer accused Mr. Hathorn of harsh treatment, depriving the boys of playtime and overworking them. A cook, Jane Tytler, testified that she had killed a cat in her larder the day before the school cat was found dead. This contradicted Mr. Hathorn's claims, undermining his justification for the severe discipline. Witnesses confirmed the lawyer's claims, leading to a loud reaction from the court.

"A new school term began with excitement as the boys gathered in their places under the new master, Mr. Porson. The previous schoolmaster, Mr. Hathorn, had been replaced due to his cruel and tyrannical behavior. Mr. Porson, a younger man, addressed the boys with a calm demeanor, emphasizing the importance of learning and obedience. He encouraged them to do their best in acquiring knowledge and to be honest and honorable.

Ned, who had previously been involved in a conflict with Mr. Hathorn, was among the students who returned to the school. His father, Captain Sankey, had spoken to Mr. Porson about Ned's past struggles with his temper. Mr. Porson expressed his belief in managing boys with kindness rather than harsh discipline.

One aspect regarding discipline. I don't believe in forcing knowledge on students through punishment or fear. I expect you to learn because it's your duty, paid for by your parents, and because you want to please me. I hope to rarely use the cane. It will only be used if a lie is told, if someone acts dishonorably, is persistently lazy, or when necessary. I view you as friends I must educate. Treat me as a friend who educates you and cares for your well-being. If we maintain this relationship, punishment should be rare. Today, each of you will come to my desk individually for assessment. The first class will be examined this morning, and the rest can go to the playground. The second class will be assessed in the afternoon.

I forgot to mention something important this morning. I see you spend most of your free time in the playground, except on Saturday afternoons when you can roam freely. I don't want you wandering into town, so I'm making Marsden off-limits. Instead, you can explore the countryside.

I brought cricket gear, quoits, and more for you to enjoy. I want you to be happy and work hard. Lessons have improved with a new approach emphasizing understanding over rote learning.

"Ned listened quietly as Mr. Mulready shared his intentions to marry his mother. While Ned admitted he didn't like the idea, he understood that his feelings wouldn't change the situation. He expressed that his main concern was his mother's happiness, and if Mr. Mulready could achieve that, they might get along. Ned's firm tone hinted at a possible challenge for Mr. Mulready.

Later, Mrs. Sankey expressed her concerns about Ned's behavior and hoped he wouldn't cause any trouble. Mr. Mulready reassured her, mentioning that boys often see stepfathers as adversaries. He believed they would manage until Ned left for his commission.

As the wedding approached, tensions rose between Mr. Mulready and Mrs. Sankey. Mrs. Sankey insisted on settlements to secure her fortune, which didn't align with Mr. Mulready's plans to invest in his business.

Mrs. Sankey accepted his argument but insisted on keeping her money. This created a barrier between them, hinting that the match might fail. To prevent this, Mrs. Sankey agreed to invest her money in the business under her name. If she died first, her husband could choose to pay it to her children or give them an annual sum. If he passed first, the mill would go to any children from their marriage, or solely to her if they had none. Despite her lack of business knowledge, she negotiated fiercely, surprising Mr. Mulready. He needed the capital to avoid bankruptcy and couldn't risk losing it by pushing too hard. Ned, Mrs. Sankey's son, initially planned to skip the wedding, but Mr. Porson convinced him otherwise to avoid appearing hostile. The marriage caused controversy due to its timing after Captain Sankey's death, eliciting disapproval from onlookers. Mrs. Sankey looked radiant, while Mr. Mulready seemed pleased by the attention. Lucy and Charlie were indifferent, but Ned's visible hostility toward Mr. Mulready did not go unnoticed. Abijah, a loyal servant, decided to leave, adding to the family's woes.|"['1.

The public opinion remained unchanged after the examination. Many believed that Ned had followed his stepfather to the mill with the intention of causing harm. The general view was that Ned had stumbled upon a coil of rope and decided to use it to cause an accident with the gig. Charlie's testimony about the attack on his brother evoked sympathy and led many to believe that a longer prison sentence would have sufficed as punishment. Despite the challenging situation, Ned reassured his siblings, Lucy and Charlie, that everything would eventually be resolved. After an emotional farewell, Ned was informed that he would be driven to York for his trial, disguised as a regular traveler to avoid suspicion.

The doctor informed Ned that he must leave his patients for a day or two. Mr. Wakefield awaited Ned with news that might uplift him.

Mr. Grant's belief about juries was proven right when Ned, looking pale but composed, stood in the dock. The prosecution emphasized Ned's long-standing animosity towards the deceased, a well-liked gentleman in Yorkshire. Ned had a history of violence, including assaulting his stepfather and threatening his schoolmaster. The prosecution theorized that Ned may have planned vengeance against the deceased, culminating in a fatal encounter at a lonely mill. While the exact details were speculative, the prosecution presented a narrative of events leading to the tragedy. The counsel urged the jury to consider the evidence of ill will and animosity between Ned and the deceased, emphasizing that prior provocations did not justify the crime.

At the trial, various witnesses testified about the strained relationship between the deceased and the accused. Charlie's testimony was particularly damaging as he recounted the threatening words Ned had spoken. The defense counsel highlighted Mr. Mulready's unpleasant nature at home, contrasting with his public persona. Witnesses from the mill also spoke of Mr. Mulready's unpopularity and the fear of his potential harm. However, Dr. Green and Mr. Porson vouched for Ned's good character. The defense argued that the crime was likely committed by someone associated with a secret group that had threatened Mr. Mulready. Despite the prosecution's theories, there was no concrete evidence linking Ned to the murder.

Polly rushed to inform Ned about an imminent attack on Cartwright's mill by Varley men. With urgency, she relayed that the assailants were to meet at Sir George Armitage's fields. Ned, realizing the urgency, advised Polly against fetching troops to avoid suspicion. Instead, he hurried to Cartwright's, hoping to arrive in time.

The noise woke up the ten men in the building, five were workers of Mr. Cartwright, and the rest were soldiers. They quickly got dressed and grabbed their weapons. A burst of gunfire shattered the windows, and sledgehammers pounded on the doors. Mr. Cartwright rang the bell for help. The defenders, armed at the windows, returned fire. Ned fired at the attackers below, causing chaos. The Luddites tried to break in with heavy hammers, but the defenders fought back. The soldiers joined Mr. Cartwright to reinforce the door. The attackers were forced to retreat due to heavy gunfire. Some wounded Luddites were carried away as the rest fled. Ned suggested helping the wounded, signaling the end of the attack.|['1.

"""No, Ned,"" Mr. Cartwright said firmly, ""they must wait a little longer. The others may still be hiding close ready to make a rush if we come out; besides, it would likely enough be said of us that we went out and killed the wounded; we must wait awhile."" The questioner proved to be a friend who lived the other side of Liversedge and had been aroused by the ringing of the alarm bell. He had not ventured to approach until the firing had ceased and had then come on to see the issue. Hearing that the rioters had all departed, Mr. Cartwright ordered the door to be opened. The wounded Luddites were lifted and carried into the mill, and Mr. Cartwright sent at once for the nearest surgeon, who was speedily upon the spot. Long before he arrived, the hussars had ridden up and had been dispatched over the country in search of the rioters, of whom, save the dead and wounded, no signs were visible. As day dawned, the destruction which had been wrought was clearly visible. The doors were in splinters, the lower window frames were all smashed in, scarce a pane of glass remained in its place throughout the whole building, the stonework was dotted and splashed with bullet marks, the angles of the windows were chipped and broken, there were dark patches of blood in many places in the courtyard, and the yard itself and the roads leading from the mill were strewn"|"[""1.

In just thirty minutes, the group gathered for breakfast. Amy learned about the fight and was thankful to Ned for alerting them about the rioters. Despite the soldiers searching, the Luddites dispersed to their villages. Rewards were offered for information, but no one spoke up out of loyalty or fear. Mr. Cartwright wanted to reward Mary, but she refused, feeling it was wrong to accept payment for doing the right thing. Ned assured Mr. Cartwright of Mary's integrity. Mary shared that she saw John Stukeley, the blacksmith, talking with her father late at night, but he had been missing since the incident. The attack on Cartwright's mill caused a stir in the area, with Ned being credited for thwarting the rioters. To protect Ned, soldiers were stationed at the mill, which he reluctantly accepted.|"['1.
