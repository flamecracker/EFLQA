The king and queen, along with their butler Benson, found themselves in a peculiar situation after a magical journey. The queen, perplexed by their unexpected location, tried to act as if everything was normal. Benson, seizing the opportunity, decided to claim the crown princeship and ask for Lady Molinda's hand. Meanwhile, the king was eager to return to Falkenstein and resolve the situation constitutionally. The ambassador was relieved to see the royal party depart. The group considered using the flying carpet to return home, but the queen dismissed the idea as childish. Instead, she left in a carriage without bidding farewell. The king, Benson, and the prince opted for the flying carpet and safely arrived back at Falkenstein, a week before the queen's return.|"[""1.

Benson was the first to present his evidence. He refused to reveal where or how he defeated the Firedrake. He hinted that there might be more of these creatures left, especially young ones that would be hard to defeat. Benson kept his secret and claimed the reward, which was meant for the person who brought the horns and tail of the beast, not necessarily the one who killed it. The courtiers supported Benson, as they preferred him over Prigio, who they thought would be the next crown prince. Lady Molinda, torn between her dislike for Prigio and her reluctance to marry Benson, faced a difficult decision. Despite the reward being for the horns and tail, not for slaying the monster, the prince questioned the king's intentions. Ultimately, Prince Prigio produced the hoofs, ending the case in his favor. Benson, disappointed, returned to his master with a sour mood.|"['1.

Once upon a time in the kingdom of Pantouflia, the king wept, surrounded by his court. The prince, Prigio, was about to marry Lady Molinda, a dear girl, as proclaimed. However, Prigio had other plans. He wished to escape with his true love, Lady Rosalind, across the border. The king, determined to uphold his proclamation, threatened Prigio with marriage to Lady Molinda or facing the family executioner.

The king, whose mind did not work very quickly, took some minutes to ponder. He realized that by agreeing to the prince's terms, he could either retrieve his sons or rid himself of Prigio without the need for execution. Some kings have put their eldest sons to death, but they have never been loved for it. Prigio then spoke to Lady Molinda, hinting at their future together. Lady Rosalind was overjoyed to see him and they walked in the gardens, discussing various topics. Prigio assured her that within three days, things would be resolved. He shared his story with her, explaining how meeting her had changed his perspective on life. He then embarked on a mission to find his brothers, armed with a plan. The next morning, he set out on his quest, flying to the old castle. Despite the desolation, he found solace in an old cat named Frank. The prince then explored the fairy cupboard, discovering ancient water vessels with engraved plates.|"[""1.

Prince Prigio was determined to save his brothers, Alphonso and Enrico, who had fallen victim to the dreaded Firedrake. Armed with fairy water from the Fountain of Lions, he swiftly brought Alphonso back to life with a sprinkle of the magical liquid. The trio then set out to find Enrico, who was also revived by the enchanted water. Once reunited, the brothers feasted on sausage and bread, sharing tales of their adventures. Prigio led them to a hill where enchanted knights had been frozen in time. With a drop of fairy water, the knights sprang back to life, ready for battle. The reunited group rode triumphantly back to Falkenstein, where the king, moved by their bravery, welcomed them with tears of joy. Though the king initially hesitated to uphold his promise to Prigio, a clever threat involving the Firedrake's head quickly changed his mind. In the end, Prigio's quick thinking and bravery saved the day, and even led to a royal wedding celebration.|"['1.
