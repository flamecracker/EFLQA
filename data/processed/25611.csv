In the moonlit night, by the sea, a wooden spade was handed to me to dig the sandy shore. Each hole I dug filled with the sea's embrace until it could hold no more. Three of us floated in a meadow by the swing, three aboard a basket on the lea. Winds blew in the spring air, like those on the sea. Where shall we venture today on this floating spree, steering by a star, to Africa, Providence, Babylon, or Malabar? A squadron rows on the sea, cattle charge in the meadow, a quick escape to the harbor and garden's shore is our aim. Late at night, a rider gallops by when the moon and stars are high, riding through the dark and wet. The rider returns galloping back, a mysterious figure, a silhouette.|['1.

The wind blows all day, singing a loud song. It tosses kites high and blows birds across the sky. It hides itself but is everywhere, pushing and calling without being seen. The wind is strong and cold, a mystery of nature. A child watches Leerie light the lamps at night and dreams of joining him. In a little dell, a child finds a world of his own, naming everything and feeling like a king. But as evening falls, it's time to leave the dell and return home for tea. The child's nurse seems huge compared to the world of his dell, a reminder of the real world beyond his imagination.|"['1.

I have a whistle made by me, clear and sound, near the field's end, from a plane's branch with my knife, made by nursie alone! I found a stone with white, yellow, and grey, carried it back, sure it's gold despite father's denial. A chisel, handle and blade, by a real carpenter, is my treasured possession. When alone, I shut my eyes to sail through the skies to the Land of Play, where Little People dwell. Clover-tops as trees, rain-pools as seas, leaves as ships, and Bumble Bees hum above. I wander through the forest, see spider, fly, and ants carrying parcels. I sail on rain-pool seas on leaflet boats with thoughtful creatures watching. But when I open my eyes, reality sets in with bare walls, big knobs, people stitching, and talking nonsense. Oh, to be a sailor on the rain-pool sea, a climber in the clover tree, and return as a sleepy-head at night.|"[""1.
