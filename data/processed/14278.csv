In 1922, radio telephony was still in its early stages. By then, advancements had already surpassed what was even dreamt of in 1918. Germany and the Italian Government had achieved experiments where the human voice could travel hundreds of miles through radio. Broadcasting stations were sending concerts across the land with great reach. In the United States, over 700,000 receiving sets were in use by March 1922, with installations rapidly increasing. The government was working to organize airwave control, assigning specific wave lengths for amateurs, commercial use, and government purposes. Amateurs were drawn to radio due to the lack of licensing for receiving sets, while sending stations required licenses. To build a basic receiving set, a coil marked L was constructed using cardboard and wire, along with a purchased detector and variable condenser for tuning.|['1.

To set up your radio, choose an aerial between 60 to 100 feet long, placed as high and clear of obstacles as possible. Use porcelain cleats at each end for insulation. Mount your instruments correctly by securing them on a pine board with four binding posts: one for the aerial wire, one for the ground wire, and two for the headphones. Adjust the detector until you hear a clear click when a nearby electric light is turned on and off. If no light is available, use a buzzer and dry battery. Fine-tune the condenser knob until you pick up signals. Check the wiring if the set doesn't work. This setup is suitable for short distances but can be modified for greater range later.|['1.

Three wealthy boys, Frank, Jack, and Bob, lived on Long Island. Frank's parents were deceased, and Mr. Temple, his guardian, managed his inheritance. The boys, fascinated by science, received support from Mr. Temple and Mr. Hampton, who shared their scientific interests. When Mr. Hampton went to Texas and New Mexico for work, Jack persuaded his father to let him join. The boys planned to reunite in the Southwest after school ended in June. They intended to fly there in their airplane, despite Mr. Temple's concerns about their young age. The boys spent the last months of school preparing for the flight, studying maps and flight conditions. They also used the radiophone station on the Hampton estate to communicate and learn about radio telephony. Despite delays, the boys looked forward to being able to talk across the miles once the new station was operational.|"['1.

After checking the weather, Bob relaxed in a chair with a book while Frank put on a headpiece to listen to a message. Suddenly, Frank called out for Bob to come over. They heard various sounds, but as they tuned in, the noises faded. Then, Jack's voice came through clearly, surprising the boys. Jack mentioned he forgot something and asked them to play a specific record on the talking machine. Frank quickly found the record, played it, and Jack's voice became clearer. Jack shared exciting news about business rivals and Mexican bandits near him, urging the boys to visit soon. The urgent cry for help that interrupted Jack's message left the boys puzzled and curious about the situation.|"['1.

Bob confidently remembered Jack's exceptional athletic abilities, especially in swimming, boxing, wrestling, and fencing. Despite Bob being the best wrestler, Jack was undoubtedly superior in overall athleticism. Bob imagined the fierce battle that might have taken place between Jack and the intruders, causing a crash and possibly damaging the station equipment. Frank tried to calm Bob down, suggesting that they didn't know Jack's fate, speculating he might have been hurt, killed, or taken as a prisoner. Just then, Bob and Frank's father, a distinguished man resembling Bob, entered the room. He mentioned coming home early due to spring fever and inquired about the news from the Hamptons. Jack informed him about the encounter with the intruders, how he and his dad overpowered them, and that they were now tied up. The microphone cord was damaged but Jack managed to fix it to call for help.|"[""1.

The room where the boys were talking was round and windowless, with walls covered in a sound-proof material resembling burlap. The ceiling was nine feet high, with fabric stretching from the walls to the middle, giving it a circus tent-like appearance to enhance the acoustics. While Mr. Temple discussed oil operations with Mr. Hampton, the boys whispered enviously about Jack's adventures. Bob overheard his father mentioning a need for a vacation and his desire to join the boys. Suddenly, a whisper from Tom Barnum, the mechanic-watchman, interrupted them. Tom and the boys hurried into the power house, where Old Davey, the caretaker, shared his sighting of a dark intruder sneaking into the house through the cellar door.|"['1.

"Returning to the room, Bob got his father's attention, who was still talking to Mr. Hampton. He shared what Old Davey had said. Mr. Temple adjusted the headpiece and turned to the transmitter. ""I doubt it,"" said Mr. Hampton, then alarmed, ""Temple, yes. There is. The Octopus wants a list of oil field lessees who joined the independents."" Removing the headpiece, he rushed Bob to the power house, asking Tom to shut down and follow. With Old Davey alongside, they hurried to the Hampton house a quarter mile away. Bob joked about the chaos. Spotting a man from the cellar, Bob and Frank chased him towards the Gut, a narrow road stretch. The car slowed, revealing three men, one the intruder. The driver seemed like a taxi chauffeur, the others foreign."|"['1.

The man by the driver saw Bob and yelled. Bob jumped and landed on the car's running board. He grabbed the man in the back seat by his coat collar and partially pulled him out. Frank surmised that the man was trying to escape his coat but Bob held on. Frank found a return trip ticket to Ransome, New Mexico, a wallet with money, and a legal envelope with Mr. Hampton's name. Mr. Temple found a crucial document in the envelope that could give the Oil Trust an advantage over the independents. They decided to involve the police to stop the car and arrest its occupants. Frank discovered that the man came from Ransome, New Mexico, the nearest station to Hampton's camp. They all settled in the room as Mr. Temple, smoking a cigar, prepared to discuss the serious situation.|"[""1.

"""We need to keep this secret until we fully understand what's going on,"" Mr. Temple explained. ""We've recovered the stolen items, but I suspect there's more to this than just rivalry between the independent oil operators and the Trust.""

""In essence, the Octopus, as they're known, are smart businessmen,"" Mr. Temple continued. ""But they wouldn't resort to such underhanded tactics. The recent incidents at Mr. Hampton's camp and here suggest something else. The attackers were Mexicans, and the man at the Hampton house today was also Mexican. This could be a ploy to provoke a response from the U.S. government.""

""By targeting independent operators like us, these Mexicans might aim to draw Uncle Sam's attention,"" Mr. Temple elaborated. ""It's a political move, not a personal one. The rebels in Mexico are gaining strength, and stirring trouble on the border could spark a larger conflict.""

Bob and Frank were puzzled by the return of the thieves after they were scared off. Bob suspected a plot by Mexican troublemakers to disrupt operations in the Southwest. The boys, along with Mr. Temple, tried to contact the Hamptons in New Mexico to share the day's events but received no response. Reluctantly, they abandoned their efforts and headed home. The next day, they planned to attend church and then prepare for an airplane flight to New Mexico. At dinner, they discussed the day's events, and Bob's sister, Della, expressed interest in joining them.

Frank excitedly shared with Bob the capabilities of their airplane's radiophone, emphasizing how the all-metal body of the plane served as an excellent ground for communication. Bob, still groggy from sleep, quickly got ready as they planned to sneak out for an early morning tinkering session on the plane before heading to church. The boys hastily made sandwiches in the pantry, then dashed to the beach for a refreshing swim in the Atlantic. After their playful swim, they headed to their airplane shed, located in an ideal sandy landing field. The shed, a sturdy structure hidden from the house, housed their special plane equipped with a radiophone and a new detector they had designed.

Disheartened, he searched the shed, hoping to find the missing airplane. Mr. Temple, upon hearing about the theft, received a call from New York City that shed some light on the situation. The caller, a chauffeur, revealed that the thieves were likely a Mexican and a German. The German might have been an aviator who used the plane to escape quickly.

The Temples and Frank Merrick were at Ransome station in New Mexico. They had just been dropped off by a flier. Jack Hampton, the oldest of the three chums at 19, was there to greet them. Jack was tall and slender, with blue eyes and lively features. He excelled in sports at Harrington Hall Military Academy. Today he wore a khaki shirt, breeches, and a wide-brimmed sombrero, looking striking next to his East Coast friends in their summer suits. Mr. Temple expressed relief that Jack was safe, and Jack was eager to head into Old Mexico.

In the vast desert, mesquite and cactus dotted the landscape, with the only trees being the cottonwoods along a stream. Mountains surrounded the area, with foothills closer by in striking shapes and colors. The sunshine was warm, yet the air was clean and cooling as the day waned. Mr. Temple explained to Frank about oil prospects in the region and the arrival of the Independents. Suddenly, Gabby Pete, the camp cook, interrupted, delivering an urgent letter to Jack. The message demanded $100,000 for the release of Mr. John Hampton, held captive at the Calomares ranch. The ransom was to be delivered in two weeks by a lone rider wearing a white handkerchief in their hat. Excitedly, Jack and his friends gathered around to read the urgent message left by a mysterious messenger in an airplane.|"['1.

Gabby Pete assured Jack that he would keep the information about his father being held for ransom a secret. Pete promised to say that Jack's father had gone East for business if anyone asked. Pete and his horse, Angel Face, prepared to head back to camp to get dinner. Gabby Pete mentioned a man named Don Fernandez y Calomares in Mexico, who lived like a king in a palace and was involved in a revolution against the government.

As the sun began to set behind the mountains, casting long shadows across the plain, the sky turned a dark blue in the east. Stars twinkled brightly, while a rosy light lingered in the zenith. The western sky glowed with a ruddy afterglow as the sun disappeared. Night fell swiftly, and the group in the car fell silent, awestruck by the scene. Suddenly, the engine sputtered and stopped. Remedios, the driver, inspected the spark plug and declared it was broken. Just then, a horseman rode up, warning them of bandits approaching in another car. Ignoring the danger, Frank fixed the spark plug and sped off into the night, pursued by the oncoming vehicle.|"['1.

Mr. Temple and Bob were already standing in the back seat. Jack and Frank peered into the shadows behind. The moon, in its first quarter, cast a faint light. The bandits' car was in disarray, blocking the road. Groans came from dark figures on the ground. Gabby Pete commended Frank for disabling the bandits' car. Bullets flew as the boys escaped. Jack fired a warning shot. The car sped away. They reached a ranch house with a tower and antenna. They were welcomed with a good meal. Mr. Temple discussed the kidnapping of Mr. Hampton and mysterious events. The group pondered the bandits' motives and their link to oil interests.|"[""1.

Jack Hampton expressed his disbelief that the bandits who attacked them were after money. He found it suspicious that they were in a car instead of on horseback like typical border bandits. Jack suspected that the attackers had a carefully planned motive: to capture Mr. Temple, who was an American of wealth and influence. This, Jack believed, would create a stir in Washington and potentially lead to trouble for President Obregon of Mexico. Jack also mentioned the precautions they took to ensure secrecy in their conversations, using coded messages and specific radio wave lengths.

Frank agreed with Jack's assessment of the situation. They suspected that their cook, Gabby Pete, might have inadvertently leaked information about their predicament. Jack pondered whether to involve the county sheriff regarding the recent attack and the abduction of Remedios. Frank advised against it, fearing that alerting the authorities could escalate the issue and expose their plight to their adversaries. As for their father's ransom demand, they deliberated on the potential political implications of seeking government intervention.

Mr. Temple revealed to the students an intriguing tale about Rollins, who faced temptations from both sides. Initially, he was asked to gather secret information from independent oil operators but failed due to tight security by Mr. Hampton. Later, a representative of Calomares, a Mexican landowner supporting rebels, approached Rollins to betray his employers. The rebels aimed to create chaos between Mexico and the United States by raiding the oil operators. Rollins struck a deal with them, promising help in exchange for their assistance. Von Arnheim, a German agent, and Morales attempted to steal data from Mr. Hampton's home but were thwarted by Rollins.

Mr. Temple decided not to go with the boys because his age and distinguished appearance might raise suspicions.

Far ahead, the three companions rode on, with Tom finally making his decision. The dim moonlight cast a ghostly glow over the plain. Alone now, the solitude and the recent goodbyes weighed on them. They rode quietly for a while until Frank's lively spirit broke the silence. Dressed like a trio of warriors, they all carried guns and rode with determination. Jack, the leader, compared them to the Three Musketeers, assigning each a role. As they journeyed through the night, thoughts of home and their mission filled their minds. The landscape changed as they neared the foothills, prompting Jack to call a stop. In the darkness, with the wind chilling them, they struggled to find their way, haunted by the distant howl of a coyote.|"['1.

Tom faithfully followed the course given by Tom, steering south by south-west as instructed. Despite the darkness, he hadn't strayed from the path. They were searching for three rocks resembling a reclining camel, a landmark to guide them. Jack, taking the lead in their trio, advised caution, suspecting potential company behind them. With Tom's presence, a sense of relief washed over Jack. They rode onward, with Tom pointing out a rock formation resembling a crouching camel, leading them left. Tom mentioned a nearby cave, previously discovered accidentally, where they could hide. The group decided to tie up their horses near some trees before approaching the cave, strategizing to catch potential intruders off guard.|"['1.

As they approached the trees, the boys couldn't contain their excitement. Until now, a hill had blocked their view of the plateau. But as they reached the edge, they saw it laid out below them. The darkness was intense, but several oil flares illuminated the scene in a circle. In the center stood the stolen airplane, unmistakable even from a distance. Cautiously, they moved closer to the large rock, wary of any defenders in the cave. A glimpse inside revealed a luxuriously furnished chamber with bright electric lights. Suddenly, Tom, who had stayed back, signaled a warning. As they prepared to enter the second chamber, Jack took charge. With a plan in mind, they readied themselves for a surprise. The room was empty, but the boys sensed danger from the three men present, one of whom they recognized as the guardian of the cave.|"['1.

The boys were caught off guard, hesitating to fire to avoid hitting their enemies in front. This delay allowed the foes to reposition and take cover. When the boys finally shot, their bullets only hit the distant wall harmlessly. The enemy retaliated, bullets whizzing close. In the intense silence that followed, Jack quietly communicated with Tom Bodine about guarding the radio room to prevent being discovered by the enemy. As they cautiously moved, they accidentally stumbled into their enemies, leading to a chaotic brawl in the dark cave. Each man fought desperately for survival, the only sounds being heavy breathing and the scuffle of bodies in the darkness.|"[""1.

Tom Bodine was furious at his inability to help his friends in the dark cave. He couldn't shoot for fear of hitting them. Determined, he searched for a way to turn on the lights. Finding a button, he flooded the caves with light. Bob used his wrestling skills to defeat one enemy. Another man grabbed a fallen revolver and fired, missing Bob. Bob leaped and disarmed him. Jack overpowered his opponent, while Frank struggled against the German. Tom intervened, knocking out the German with his revolver. The enemies were tied up, and Frank was helped to safety by his friends.|"[""1.

"None of the three boys had suffered serious injuries, just bruises. Frank was battered in a fight but had a strained left shoulder.

Too tired to argue much, Jack agreed to rest after making sure Tom would wake him in two hours. However, Tom didn't call until eight hours later. The cave lights stayed on to watch the captives. When daylight came, Jack scolded and went to sleep. Bob guarded the cave entrance while the others found food in a pantry. After eating, they fed and re-bonded the captives. The prisoners were uncooperative. Jack and Frank worried about being recognized by the traitors. They discussed seeking help from Stone, an American captive. Jack suggested being cautious and consulting his father. Bob wanted to use the radio but ate first. After a quick meal, Bob and Jack headed to the inner room with the radio, while Frank kept watch.|['1.

Upon a quick examination, Jack realized that the station was not new, likely dating back to 1918. While the equipment was top-notch for its time, it had become outdated due to advancements. The setup included a generator for sustained waves, a control system to regulate output, and a ground system for energy transmission. Jack noted the robust water-cooling system and speculated the design was possibly German, as they were pioneers in radio technology. Jack and Bob tried to contact Dave Morningstar, a mechanic at Mr. Hampton's radio plant, for help. Bob reassured his worried father, Mr. Temple, that they were safe and doing well after a risky adventure.|"[""1.

When Bob recounted the cave fight to his father, he downplayed the details to spare his father unnecessary distress. Despite Mr. Temple's anxious inquiries, Bob provided honest answers, giving his father a clear understanding of the danger they faced. Mr. Temple acknowledged Bob's bravery but expressed concern about the ongoing rescue mission for Mr. Hampton. Bob reassured his father, mentioning the capture of Morales and Von Arnheim, their most significant threats. Bob believed that with the enemies subdued, their disguise as adventurous Americans would help them navigate the rebel territory safely. Mr. Temple, though cautious, suggested leveraging their prisoners for valuable information and authorized Bob to offer Stone a reward for cooperation. He advised Bob to consult him before taking any further action. The boys, including Jack and Frank, discussed the plan cautiously while keeping watch over the cave entrance.

"""Let's chat with Stone and hear his thoughts,"" Jack suggested. ""Frank and I have discussed the situation and have some ideas.

""I'm a big fan of the U.S.A.,"" he continued. ""But let me tell you, the people here are great too. They may have different customs and politics, but they're good folks.

Frank was not pleased with the role he was given. He was supposed to remain at the cave with Tom Bodine and Roy Stone, watching over the prisoners, Morales and Von Arnheim. Meanwhile, Mr. Hampton, Jack, and Bob would fly to the Hampton ranch in an airplane. Through the airplane's radio, they would communicate with the group at the cave. Once the rescue party was on its way to the border, the prisoners would be left restrained to avoid any trouble. The plan was to inform rebel headquarters of the prisoners' location once the party had moved towards the border. Bob and Jack then disguised themselves in the prisoners' clothing to deceive anyone who might recognize them. Bob was to act as the German aviator, while Jack would pretend to be Morales, as he could speak Spanish fluently. The two men followed the instructions reluctantly but knew their time for action would come again soon.|"[""1.

The boys had altered their initial plan of pretending to be adventurous American youths to join the rebel forces and save Mr. Hampton. Bob and Jack's new strategy involved landing the airplane, with Bob staying put while Jack freed his father and guided him back to the aircraft for a swift escape to the border. Despite the seemingly straightforward plan, challenges awaited. Finding the ranch and landing safely was the easy part, but the real obstacles lay ahead. Initially considering a late-night attempt to avoid detection, they realized the ranch and radio station would be dark, making it hard to navigate. Opting for an early arrival, they hoped to blend in with the hustle and bustle of the ranch. Jack planned to feign a toothache to avoid unnecessary interactions. With their friends' support, the daring rescue mission was set into motion.|"[""1.

Returning to the entrance, Tom took a step forward to see the airplane past the big rock outside. The boys had reached it, the oil flares lit on both sides, making the airplane stand out like a giant bird. As the propeller started spinning, Tom moved closer, fascinated by the aircraft. Suddenly, a figure darted out of the cave, catching Tom off guard. They both looked towards the cave, feeling a nameless fear. Frank suggested they move out of the light slowly, pretending to watch the airplane, to avoid danger. Stone proposed sneaking up to the cave through a private path to check on Tom.

Stone and Frank ventured across the valley towards a hill, avoiding the usual path to a cave. As they ascended in darkness, they took caution to prevent noise. Stone slipped, but Frank saved him. Resting briefly, they continued until they saw German towers camouflaged from view. Stone led Frank to a crevice where they heard voices in Spanish. Realizing the danger, they planned to sabotage the radio station to aid their friends. Suddenly, a figure attacked them, firing a shot narrowly missing Frank. Stone was knocked down in the scuffle.|['1.

Frank quickly realized that Roy Stone was in a fierce struggle with an opponent, either Morales or Von Arnheim. As he looked around, he saw no one else nearby. Hearing Morales' angry voice from a distance, Frank sensed trouble with the radio transmission to the Calomares ranch. An idea sparked in Frank's mind – he could rescue Tom Bodine, surprise Morales, and reclaim the cave and radio plant while the others were occupied. However, he felt ashamed of his initial plan and rushed to help Roy and Von Arnheim, who were locked in a fight. Frank disarmed Von Arnheim, but the battle continued fiercely. Eventually, Roy gained the upper hand, overpowering Von Arnheim. Frank then entered the cave, holding Morales at gunpoint, preventing him from making the radio call.|"[""1.

Frank quickly struck the Mexican, Morales, with the revolver, causing him to collapse. He then put on a device that played Spanish words that he couldn't understand. Jack, another person, intervened to prevent Morales from sending a message to a ranch. As they approached some lights, Morales regained consciousness and tried to attack Frank. Frank defended himself by fighting Morales, eventually overpowering him. Despite being heavier, Morales succumbed to Frank's determined strength. Frank, now in control, placed the revolver on a table and prepared to make a call, ready to defend himself if Morales tried to regain the radiophone.|"[""Question 1:\nWhat caused Morales to collapse?\nA) The device playing Spanish words\nB) Jack's intervention\nC) Frank's revolver strike\nD) The lights they approached\nE) Morales regained consciousness"", 'Question 2:\nWhy did Jack intervene in the situation?\nA) To make a call\nB) To overpower Frank\nC) To prevent Morales from sending a message\nD) To play Spanish words\nE) To defend himself', 'Question 3:\nWhat did Frank do after Morales regained consciousness and tried to attack him?\nA) Prepared to make a call\nB) Collapsed\nC) Fought back and overpowered Morales\nD) Put on a device\nE) Surrendered to Morales', 'Question 4:\nWhat did Frank do after overpowering Morales?\nA) Collapsed\nB) Put the revolver on a table\nC) Prepared to make a call\nD) Sent a message to a ranch\nE) Regained consciousness', 'Question 5:\nWhat did Frank do to defend himself against Morales?\nA) Played Spanish words\nB) Collapsed\nC) Fought back\nD) Sent a message to a ranch\nE) Regained consciousness', 'Question 6:\nWhat was Frank ready to do if Morales tried to regain the radiophone?\nA) Collapse\nB) Make a call\nC) Put on a device\nD) Defend himself\nE) Surrender to Morales']"|"[""C) Frank's revolver strike"", 'C) To prevent Morales from sending a message', 'C) Fought back and overpowered Morales', 'B) Put the revolver on a table', 'C) Fought back', 'D) Defend himself']"

The hills flanked them closely as they flew over the rampart behind them, with the distant valley extending ahead. The radio plant stood behind them, its towers and antennas against the sky, while the ranch house glowed brightly in the distance. Jack, disguised as Morales, was set to enter the ranch house to rescue his father, Mr. Hampton, with Bob staying by the plane. As Jack's heart raced with anticipation, Bob noticed his labored breathing and offered support. Unbeknownst to them, Muller, a young German at the ranch's radio plant, grew suspicious after intercepting their coded messages. Muller, eager to impress Calomares, hastened to report what he believed to be Von Arnheim or Morales approaching the ranch. Meanwhile, Jack cautiously followed Stone's instructions, aiming to navigate the ranch house and free his father.|"[""1.

Jack, passing through the grove, reached the ranch and was amazed by the sight of the magnificent mansion. The grand house, described by Roy Stone, resembled a palace in the wilderness. The mansion, with its vari-colored brick walls and inlaid designs of formal flowers, stood on a slight elevation with a lawn sloping down to the surrounding trees. The design was reminiscent of a country house from ancient Roman times, with two stories and corner towers rising even higher. As Jack crossed the lawn and approached the marble-tiled walk leading to the building, he was captivated by the marble courtyard with a fountain and pool, illuminated by concealed electric lights. Despite his anxiety to reach his father in the left wing, Jack paused to take in the breathtaking scene before continuing his journey.|"[""1.

The large man justified his decision to disobey orders by convincing himself that he couldn't bear to miss out on the action. Disguised in Von Arnheim's attire, he resembled the German pilot, making it unlikely for anyone to recognize him. Even his poor Spanish wouldn't give him away, as the German's Spanish was just as terrible. Meanwhile, not too far away, a conversation between Jack and Muller was reaching a critical point. Muller, unaware that Jack was the man from the cave, questioned him about the garbled radio message. Sensing danger, Jack tried to leave, but Muller stopped him, insinuating that he knew more than he was letting on. Jack, fearing discovery, attempted to walk away, but Muller accidentally knocked off his hat, sparking a tense moment. In a split second, Jack was exposed, leading to a physical altercation with Muller that drew the attention of rebel guards nearby.|"[""1.

The guards briefly paused, mistaking the running figure for Morales. Instead, they assisted Muller to stand. Bob, hidden in the bushes, wisely refrained from intervening to avoid trouble. He observed Muller clarifying that the man fleeing wasn't Morales but someone in his attire. Bob sprinted through the trees, collided with a Mexican soldier, and swiftly incapacitated him with a punch. Bob raced towards his aircraft, pondering his next move. With pursuers closing in, he pondered how to escape without anyone to start the plane. Approaching the aircraft, two Mexican soldiers saluted, mistaking Bob for Von Arnheim.

Bob, speaking broken Spanish, quickly took control of the plane and was obeyed by the men. As they tried to take off, shots were fired by pursuers, but Bob managed to escape unharmed. Meanwhile, Jack, seeking refuge, entered a room where he found Don Fernandez' daughter, Rafaela, and her chaperone, Donna Ana. The women were terrified but Jack had no time to lose. He needed to act swiftly to ensure his escape. As Bob flew over the hills, the rebel soldiers below were attacked by government troops.

Jack was on edge as he strained to hear the sounds outside. Menacing footsteps approached and then descended the stairs. Quickly, Jack locked the door just in time. Moments later, he heard the sentries' footsteps fade away as they split up, one going up the tower stairs and the other along the balcony. Feeling puzzled about his next move, Jack tried to guess the identities of the two women based on Roy Stone's description of the Don's family. As he hesitated, the girl regained her composure and sternly ordered him to lower his weapon. The older woman, Donna Ana, seemed less afraid now but whispered urgently to the girl. Despite his surprise at the girl's behavior, Jack managed to hold onto his gun when she tried to grab it. The girl's failed attempt left her in tears, leaving Jack unsure of what to do next.|"['1.

"Jack was startled. If his plan worked, what would happen when the searchers reached the locked door? He pondered for a moment. The bold idea to confide in the girl and seek her help had been forming in his mind. He scrutinized her for the first time. Would she assist him? Maybe the romantic aspect of his mission would resonate with her, despite being at odds with her father. Well, there was no harm in trying. Speaking quickly in his fluent Spanish, he shared with her the key details: Mr. Hampton, likely someone she knew, was his father, and he had arrived to help in an airplane. As he narrated, the girl's eyes sparkled with interest. She leaned in, listening attentively. Just as Jack finished, she seemed about to speak, but a knock on the door interrupted her. ""Our rescuers,"" Donna Ana whispered, still trembling, giving Jack a disdainful look. To the chaperone, young men were intimidating.

With that, the girl hurried out of the room, and Jack followed closely. Rafaela dashed up the spiral stone staircase of the tower, passing a lit landing. Jack trailed behind. Finally, they reached the top landing with a heavy oak door. ""They found you?"" Mr. Hampton feigned distress. ""Oh no. But, Jack, I heard Don Fernandez drop something as he rushed down the steps.

""I bet he's been waiting anxiously at the radio station on our New Mexico ranch for hours, pacing back and forth with old cowboy Dave Morningstar, smoking and looking out for news."" Jack thought of the urgent radio message from the cave they heard while flying to the Calomares ranch. ""He must have put up a good fight, especially against Morales. We lost contact after he said he beat the Mexican."" As they entered the sending room, they faced Muller, the German operator who had caused trouble before. Jack explained that Don Fernandez had given permission for them to use the radio. Reluctantly, Muller stepped aside, still harboring resentment due to his German background and past conflicts. Bob, disliking Muller, urged to use the phone and get the radio working."|"['1.

Dave Morningstar, with his hat shading his eyes, sat back in a chair against the wall, his only movements were the occasional glance and refilling his pipe. Mr. Temple, anxious as the hours passed with no word from the boys, regretted allowing the risky mission. He feared the worst as they failed to call from the airplane as promised. Anxious Frank paced the cave, worried about the boys' safety. The relief came when Bob's voice crackled over the radio, sharing the success of their rescue mission. Frank's anxiety eased as he listened to the thrilling tale. The radio connected the two locations, bringing relief and gratitude for the safe return of the boys.|"['1.

Jack, who was narrating Senorita Rafaela's role, blushed and grew angry. Bob, nearby, pondered if Jack was smitten by her. The conversation continued with Mr. Temple and Frank keenly listening. It was decided that the next day, Mr. Hampton, Bob, and Jack would fly to the Hampton ranch. Meanwhile, Morales and Von Arnheim were to stay at the cave until help arrived. Jack hesitated to let go of Rafaela's hand. The next day, under the bright sun, Bob piloted the plane towards the Hampton ranch. Jack waved to Rafaela as they flew off. Bob covered 150 miles swiftly. Upon arrival, Bob suggested fetching Frank and Roy Stone, leaving Tom to bring the horses. Mr. Temple agreed, and Bob set off, spotting his friends on horseback in Old Mexico.|"[""1.

"""Thank you for the offer,"" he said, ""but I'll ride with Tom Bodine instead. I'm not in a rush, and you all will have your own gathering at the ranch. Take your friend with you, but leave Tom and me. We'll join you with the horses later. Each of us will have an extra horse now, and the journey will be easy. Besides, I never really liked airplanes.""

Frank handed over the horse reins to Tom Bodine and bid farewell to his friends before boarding the airplane with Bob. Roy Stone skillfully started the plane, a skill he learned from Von Arnheim, and the plane ascended once more, heading across the border.

That evening at the ranch, a cheerful group gathered for dinner with Mr. Hampton, Mr. Temple, and the three boys. Gabby Pete was eager to hear about their adventures and had prepared a delicious meal for the occasion.

Rollins was absent, having requested to go to a distant oil well until Mr. Hampton could be informed of his past betrayal. Bob and Frank spent enjoyable hours exploring the country on horseback and taking plane trips, captivated by the beautiful scenery and pleasant weather of New Mexico. The weeks passed with visits to Santa Fe's Spanish ruins and attending a thrilling rodeo at Gallup.

A month later, during dinner, Mr. Temple announced his plan to visit San Francisco for business. Bob expressed his desire to explore the city, and Mr. Temple agreed to take the boys along"|['1.
