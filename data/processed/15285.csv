A messenger called John to see Captain Colton, his commander, who was about 300 yards away. John, crouching to stay safe from the artillery fire, made his way down the trench.

Despite the chaos of war, there were moments of humanity. French and German soldiers sometimes shared songs and conversations. John believed in the goodness of people beneath the surface of war.

The sky grew darker as heavy snowflakes fell faster. John, more troubled by snow than guns, navigated the flooded trenches. Despite the harsh conditions, he was warmly greeted by familiar voices.

"""Please sit down,"" the captain instructed Weber. He then kindly offered a match and a cigarette to the Alsatian, who accepted them gratefully. Turning to John, the captain made the same offer, but John politely declined, mentioning that he did not smoke. As the distant German thunder subsided, the French response, closer and resembling a rolling crash, began. It was expected to last for about an hour until nightfall, unless the heavy clouds and falling snow brought darkness sooner. Shielded by a makeshift shelter, the three men observed the snowfall. John anxiously looked at Weber, sensing the gravity of his news. Weber proceeded to share that he had seen Lieutenant Philip Lannes three weeks earlier near a village called Catreaux, sixty miles west. Lannes had been involved in intense fighting around Ypres and had expressed concern for his mother and sister, who he had not heard from in months. Weber had visited Lannes' house in Paris to deliver good news to his family and vice versa.

"Currently, I cannot. I bring a message that leads me to the Forest of Argonne, but I will return along this path in a day or two. Perhaps I can reach the village. If I do, I will inform Mademoiselle Julie and the Picards that I have seen you here, and maybe I can also contact Lannes."" The Alsatian shook hands with John and vanished into the cut, disappearing from sight. Colton put out the torch, and the two sat quietly in the darkness. Despite vast armies lining up along a four hundred-mile front, only the wind's soft sighs and the faint sound of snow falling could be heard where they sat. John felt a strong sense of the primitive days as if they were cave-dwellers once more, with the primary goal of killing. The soft melody of an American tune played on a mouth organ further down the trench. It was a small comfort amidst the harsh reality of war. John longed for home and the familiar faces in his homeland. The music from the mouth organ brought a sense of normalcy and comfort to the soldiers in the midst of chaos. John's thoughts drifted back to the safety and sanity of his homeland, but he found solace in his role in the significant events unfolding in the world.

Meanwhile, as the weather grew warmer, the melting snow filled the trenches with fresh water. Despite efforts to pump it out, the water kept seeping back in. John, grateful for his sturdy boots, anxiously scanned the skies for any sign of the _Arrow_ and worried about Julie at Chastel. Taking a break, he visited the recovering Young Kratzek in the hospital. Kratzek, grateful for John's help, shared his family's prestigious history and his cousin, Prince Karl of Auersperg. John, an American, noted Kratzek's reverence for his noble lineage.

A history enthusiast, John understood Europe's war-torn past but marveled at its geological youth. Amidst the chaos of war, he found splendor in the world's beauty, especially as he neared the village of Chastel. Despite the snow and distant gunfire, his anticipation to reunite with Julie grew. Chastel, an ancient town with a Gothic cathedral, held historical significance. As John traveled with the wounded, he observed the intricate web of telephone wires connecting the warfront.

John gazed at the old town of Chastel, perched on a cliff above a stream. War had left its mark, with buildings in ruins. As he helped transfer the wounded to the hospital, he saw the devastation caused by battle. Despite the desolation, he felt compelled to enter the town. Crossing a stone bridge, he observed the damaged château and cathedral. Snow began to fall, adding to the eerie atmosphere. The village, once picturesque, now lay in silent ruin.

The snow started falling heavily, whipped by a bitter wind, as he wrapped his thick blue coat tightly around him. Despite the cold, a different shudder passed through him, his heart feeling like ice. The deserted town, a battleground for Germans and French, weighed on him like a nightmare. Thoughts raced about Julie's whereabouts and why Philip had summoned her to such a place. With the hospital below, faint lights glowing through the gray air and snow, John trusted Lannes' decision to send Julie to Chastel. He hoped she hadn't gone to the hospital. Walking through the desolate village, he sought signs of life, finding none. Suddenly, a familiar figure, Picard, emerged from the storm, offering a friendly welcome that warmed John's heart.|"['1.

"""There is much reason in what you say,"" John acknowledged. ""Surely, racing through the ruined Chastel in a snowstorm would not benefit the Germans. But we can't stay in the church overnight. I'm confident we can locate shelter for all of us in an abandoned house."" The falling snow had eased John's worries about Julie spending the night in Chastel. The path to the river was steep, the bridge narrow with a high arch. A vehicle could easily lose its way in the dark storm and meet disaster. ""Antoine and Suzanne, time to get to work,"" John declared. ""While the cathedral may seem a refuge from the storm, a pew isn't a comfortable bed, except for tough soldiers like us, Antoine."" Julie insisted they all venture out together. Unfazed by the snow, she led the way, showcasing the bravery and decisiveness reminiscent of her brother Philip. As they stepped outside, the snowfall intensified, making their search for shelter challenging. Yet, the towering steeple of the church offered a beacon of hope.

John and Julie sat in the smoking-room, content but not lonely, as they conversed about various topics. The snow outside was deep, and the falling flakes showed no sign of stopping. John was grateful for finding Julie in Chastel, serving vicariously for Philip, who was unable to make it due to the snow. As the night approached, John suggested that Philip would come for Julie in the morning to help at the hospital camp. Feeling a sense of duty, John decided to check the front of the hotel, even though he didn't expect to find anything. The snowy street and the ruins looked desolate. Despite the eerie atmosphere outside, John's heart remained light, grateful for the warmth and hospitality of the Hôtel de l'Europe. When John returned to the bureau, he noticed that the register had been disturbed, and another name was written beneath his own, sending a shiver down his spine.|['1.

With a sigh of relief, he placed the candle back on the desk. Two drops of sweat rolled from his forehead and landed on the register. Weber had also arrived, which didn't surprise him. Being Lannes' messenger, it was expected that he would visit Chastel to witness the reunion of brother and sister. John knew Weber was knowledgeable and would be of help. After securing his coat unnoticed, he ventured out into the snow to find Weber. As the night approached, the desolation of the town made him shiver. Spotting a figure in the distance, he hurried after it, suspecting it to be Weber. Despite calling out, the figure continued on its path. Determined, John ran after the figure, hoping to catch up, realizing it was either Weber or a local returning to check on the town.|"['Question 1: Why did John place the candle back on the desk?\nA) Because he was scared of the dark\nB) To secure his coat\nC) To light up the room\nD) To find Weber\nE) To witness the reunion', 'Question 2: Why did John expect Weber to visit Chastel?\nA) Because Weber was lost\nB) Because Weber was a messenger\nC) Because Weber was scared\nD) Because Weber was a local\nE) Because Weber was cold', 'Question 3: What made John shiver as the night approached?\nA) The sound of footsteps\nB) The desolation of the town\nC) The warmth of the candle\nD) The sight of Weber\nE) The noise of the register', ""Question 4: Why did John suspect the figure in the distance to be Weber?\nA) Because he heard Weber's voice\nB) Because he saw Weber's coat\nC) Because he recognized Weber's walk\nD) Because he smelled Weber's perfume\nE) Because he saw Weber's face"", 'Question 5: What was John hoping to achieve by running after the figure?\nA) To scare them\nB) To catch up with them\nC) To ignore them\nD) To hide from them\nE) To avoid them', 'Question 6: Why did John realize the figure was either Weber or a local?\nA) Because of their height\nB) Because of their speed\nC) Because of their footsteps\nD) Because of their clothing\nE) Because of their voice']"|"['B) To secure his coat', 'B) Because Weber was a messenger', 'B) The desolation of the town', ""B) Because he saw Weber's coat"", 'B) To catch up with them', 'D) Because of their clothing']"
The man paused, and John saw him glance back through the heavy snowfall. As the snow cleared, the man appeared slender and faint. John hurried after him, fearing to lose him in the damaged woods. He called out, and the figure stopped and turned. John, showing his hands in peace, ran towards him. It turned out to be Weber, bringing John immense relief and joy. Weber explained he mistook John for a German scout and was relieved to see him. They discussed suspicious activities and a possible German presence in Chastel.

"""We only have Chastel,"" John stated, suggesting they return to the Hôtel de l'Europe. After a long absence, John worried about Mademoiselle Lannes' concerns, not for himself but for the implications. As they trudged through deepening snow on the far side of town, it took an additional half-hour to reach the hotel. Inside, they brushed off the snow. John, noticing the dark smoking-room door, was surprised by the absence of Julie and Picard. The room was in disarray, indicating a struggle without bloodshed.

War seems to align with his beliefs, giving him the upper hand. The captivating Mademoiselle Julie was briefly held captive before, and it's clear that her youth, stunning beauty, and brave spirit have caught the eye of His Highness. Amidst the chaos of battle, he has taken her away. However, Mr. Scott doubts that the prince would go to extreme lengths in this era. The prince, a widower with no heirs, might propose a morganatic marriage to Julie. But Scott believes Julie, a true republican, would never agree, no matter the riches or titles offered.

The building where John sought refuge was a damaged low brick structure, offering temporary protection from bullets. He hid in the deep snow until he caught his breath, hearing distant shots fired. The falling snow ceased, revealing a moonlit Chastel, a white ruin with a silver tint. John, buried in the snow, observed German infantrymen passing by. Despite his admiration for their honest faces, he despised the rulers who sent them to war. As the soldiers moved on, John brushed off the snow, preparing to return to the Hotel de l'Europe. He anticipated Lannes' arrival and their search for Julie. However, unseen forces were at work, with wireless stations and aircraft mobilizing over Chastel.

John hurried along the road towards Chastel, then swiftly retreated upon spotting the advancing enemy forces. Recognizing the danger of the situation, he dashed towards the bridge, wary of the impending conflict. As he approached, he encountered a French colonel who informed him of the heavy fighting ahead due to the Germans breaking through. The colonel's stoic demeanor and resemblance to Napoleon intrigued John, prompting thoughts of reincarnation. However, the escalating gunfire diverted his attention. The French forces strategically withheld their advance, opting to unleash a barrage of artillery fire upon Chastel. The destructive scene unfolded before John's eyes, with buildings engulfed in flames and walls crumbling under the intense bombardment. The French planned to follow up the artillery assault with a decisive charge against the enemy.|"['1.

John lay in the snow near Bougainville, hearing shells whizz above. Accustomed to gunfire, he knew they weren't aimed at him but still felt uneasy. The shrapnel's shriek worried him most. The rifle bullets seemed less harmful. The French artillery, powerful and precise, pounded the town. The moonlit scene glowed eerily as walls crumbled. The cathedral's spire stood untouched. A bugler signaled a crucial move. John, armed and ready, charged with the regiment towards the town. Bullets flew, but he remained unscathed. Bougainville led with valor. The French rained bullets on the enemy, streets echoing with gunfire. The battle raged on, both sides exchanging fire amidst the chaos.|"[""1.

Bougainville calmed him, emphasizing the strategic advantage of their artillery in driving the enemy back. As reinforcements arrived, the French forces, led by Bougainville, launched a successful charge, routing the Germans. Despite the intense battle, Captain Colton and the Strangers emerged unscathed, reflecting on the importance of skill in warfare.

John gazed into the misty world, convinced Auersperg had taken Julie eastward. He prayed for Lannes and the _Arrow_ to aid in the search. An aeroplane could cover ground faster than walking. He hoped Lannes would arrive by nightfall. He trusted Julie's safety, believing Auersperg wouldn't act dishonorably. However, talk of a morganatic marriage worried him. Germany, despite its advancements, held onto medieval principles. John shivered, feeling unsettled. As dawn broke, he saw a silver bar on the horizon, a sign of hope. Wharton urged him to rise, and John joined his comrades for breakfast. The sky was clear, hinting at summer despite the winter below. John scanned the skies for the _Arrow_ and awaited Weber's return, feeling disappointed when he didn't show. Many casualties, but no sign of Weber.|"['1.

In the morning, Lannes was absent, and General Vaugirard arrived around noon in a large, roaring automobile. He praised Bougainville's work and whistled a melodious tune. Vaugirard informed John that his friend, the aviator Philip Lannes, had been injured but would recover. Lannes was shot at by German soldiers after landing his plane.

John found the harsh winter night cruel and uncivilized. Despite being in a populated area, the snow-covered landscape made him feel isolated. Exhausted, he dug a shelter under a ledge and fell into a deep slumber. Accustomed to harsh conditions from his time in the trenches, he found comfort in the warmth of his blankets.

About thirty minutes later, Weber went outside, prompting John to follow for some fresh air. John hoped to chat with Weber and gather intel on Auersperg, but Weber had disappeared. John strolled up the street cautiously, aware of the soldiers' presence. Realizing the futility of the search, he shifted focus to finding Auersperg at the grandest hotel in Metz. The hotel teemed with high-ranking guests, a stark contrast to the Inn of the Golden Lion. Observing generals and colonels, John sensed a prince's presence. Spotting Julie briefly at a window, John's heart raced. He discreetly signaled to her, hoping she'd notice. Although she vanished quickly, John felt emboldened, determined to track Auersperg, drawing strength from the tale of the tortoise and the hare.|"[""1.

The morning was cold and bright, the streets slippery but bustling with life, mainly military. Carrying his knapsack filled with food and blankets on his back, the young peasant, recognized by his passport as a horse trader, wandered around Metz, where many peasants and farmers were on various errands.

Almost without realizing it, he locked eyes with Julie, pouring his heart into the gaze. The distance to her waiting car was short, giving him time. His stare intensified, becoming more spiritual than visual. As her eyes scanned the onlookers, they met his, lingering there. John gazed into her deep blue eyes, seeing a flicker of recognition. He felt a connection, knowing she wouldn't betray him impulsively. Their eyes communicated, understanding unspoken words. Julie moved on, entering the automobile with a German chauffeur. Comments were made about her beauty, some kind, some not. John overheard unkind remarks but refrained from reacting. He followed the convoy on foot, relying on his forged passport.

As John assisted with a young nobleman's horse at Zillenstein Castle, he observed the comings and goings discreetly, mindful of his recent arrival. Encountering Leopold Kratzek, the officer he had saved, John felt a sense of familiarity and relief at his recovery. Aware of the delicate political atmosphere, John strategized, recognizing potential allies in the castle's inhabitants.

John admired the view as Kratzek rode down the mountain and disappeared into the trees. Turning back towards the stables, he encountered two curious maids nearby, a bit shy but eager to engage with the handsome stranger. John complimented the maids, Ilse and Olga, on their beauty and wit. They discussed the presence of French spies at the castle, particularly the enchanting Mademoiselle Julie with her stunning golden hair. The conversation shifted to Prince Wilhelm von Arnheim's admiration for Mademoiselle Julie, with Ilse sharing details of their interactions. John expressed his disapproval of women being involved in spying. His engaging manner and genuine interest in the maids' stories won him favor with the group.

John glanced up and saw Julie standing in a window of the castle, illuminated by a soft light that highlighted her beautiful features. She appeared lost in thought, gazing out at the mist-covered mountains. Ilse shared that Julie had attended a dinner at the castle, wearing a dress lent by Prince Karl. Despite attempts to remind her of her status as a prisoner, Julie boldly expressed her allegiance to France. John, relieved to have found her, continued his work at the stables, impressing Walther with his skills. As Kratzek, seemingly recovered from his wound, returned to the castle, John assisted him with his horse. Despite the challenges ahead, John felt a sense of hope and determination.|"['1.

John received a ten-cent tip from a man he had saved, finding humor in the gesture. He then tended to the horse, unsaddling and caring for it. Walther praised John's work ethic and invited him to a hearty meal in the castle's kitchen. Despite uncertainties about his next steps, John found solace in Providence. Observing Julie from afar, he longed to communicate with her but couldn't due to Suzanne's watchful presence.

Unexpected opportunities often arise when least expected. John, quick and decisive, seized his chance when a small gesture led the way. Without hesitation, he took the flowers from Olga's hand and boldly approached Julie on the terrace. Kneeling, he offered the flowers, causing a beautiful blush to spread across her face and a sparkle in her eyes. Despite the challenges he had faced, all seemed insignificant in that moment. Their exchange went unnoticed by others, as John, feeling elated, walked back to the stables. His heart filled with joy, reminiscent of a young crusader rescuing his lady.

John heard from Ilse that Julie walked on the terrace twice daily, in the morning and afternoon. He arranged his work to see her again that afternoon. He suggested exercising horses to Walther, who agreed. John delayed until about four o'clock when he expected Julie. Leading a horse near the terrace, he hoped she would notice him. Julie appeared with Suzanne. John's heart raced. He longed for Julie to look his way. She glanced at him, but made no gesture. The prince arrived, a powerful and cruel man. John felt anger. He doubted his ability to compete with the prince. He saw Kratzek, a young noble, watching Julie and the prince. John empathized with Kratzek's youthful love.|"['1.

Julie and Auersperg were on the terrace, engaged in conversation while John observed from a distance. Suddenly, the sound of hoofs approaching caught his attention. Pappenheim, a familiar figure on his black horse, rode into view but slowed down upon spotting Julie and Auersperg. John couldn't help but smile ironically at the situation. As Pappenheim passed by, Julie glanced in John's direction, leaving him eager to respond but held back by caution. Eventually, Julie retreated into the castle, leaving Auersperg alone on the terrace lost in thought. John couldn't help but feel that Auersperg seemed out of place in the modern setting. As the day progressed, John continued his duties diligently until Walther permitted him to explore the castle grounds within limits.

John steadily gained favor with Walther at Zillenstein due to his hard work and skill as a groom. He quickly became adept at handling automobiles, especially on the winding mountain roads. John practiced diligently, sensing that his knowledge would be valuable one day. Pappenheim left briefly but returned after four days, drawn back by his interest in Julie. Despite Pappenheim's interest in Julie, John harbored no hatred or fear toward him. John often waited for Suzanne in the evening for news, but she never approached him. John suspected the prince's prolonged stay at Zillenstein was related to potential discussions between German and Austrian officials due to Italy's threat of war. Ilse and Olga, the Austrian girls, found John charming but sensed his reluctance to engage romantically. John discreetly inquired about a French prisoner named Mademoiselle Lannes, piquing his curiosity. He learned about a hunting lodge in the mountains where the prince often visited.

In humble respect, John followed Walther, both with their caps in hand, into the castle. Prince Karl of Auersperg sat regally in a grand room overseeing the valley, appearing as a sovereign on his slightly raised throne. John, emulating Walther, bowed deeply before the prince. The stable master left reluctantly, leaving the young peasant in his simple attire facing the prince.

He had not heard any noise from inside the car since he began driving. Despite sitting just a few feet away, the wind and the sound of the wheels on the road drowned out any faint sounds. They remained silent, and he focused on the road and the car, especially as the night grew darker and the wind stronger. He drove confidently, navigating the dangers with skill as they ascended the mountain. The road was becoming harder to see with the dark clouds approaching.

John, once again embodying the qualities of a noble young crusader, experienced a moment unlike any other in his life.

As the darkness enveloped the mountain, the snow gleamed through the window like a white blanket. John found himself cut off from Zillenstein, feeling safe rather than threatened by the storm.

John woke up in the night, feeling cozy between the blankets on the sofa he had moved into the gunroom. He enjoyed the sound of the storm outside. Despite the thick walls, he could still hear the storm's roar. Eventually, he got up and looked out the window. The snowstorm was still fierce, but he felt relieved. The castle was becoming more secure as nature built up its defenses. Muller, the huntsman, might be away on a mountain task and unable to return soon. John hoped Muller would stay away, not out of ill will, but to strengthen their position. The next morning, the storm continued, and John found better clothes to wear.

It snowed for a whole day and the following night. The late season intensified the storm's fury, with pines falling and snow piling up feet high.

John and Julie found solace in their mountain seclusion, growing closer. Despite the raging storm, they shared music, books, and laughter. John, feeling chivalrous, admired Julie's spirit and courage. Their faithful guardian, Suzanne, ensured their comfort. John even began to understand Auersperg's actions with compassion.

John believed Muller would come, but the day passed without a sign of him. John searched the snow but found nothing, thinking Muller sought shelter during the storm. John hoped Muller was safe, turning his hope into a fact and forgetting about him. He planned to escape in the limousine with the two women when the snow melted, seeking a road to Italy. Meanwhile, he focused on household tasks, making the lodge luxurious and defensible. Julie helped him, revealing her strong, thoughtful mind shaped by war.

Suzanne watched as the two figures with snow shovels walked back to the lodge, deep in thought. She knew they had not noticed her, but her heart warmed towards them. Suzanne felt a sense of responsibility for the two young individuals, lost in her own worries about the future. The arrival of spring was evident, with warmer temperatures and melting snow. John, determined and daring, planned to use the automobile to navigate the mountain road once the snow cleared. During his exploration, he discovered a tragic scene of a man's body at the bottom of a gulch. Despite the sorrow, a weight seemed lifted as the snow melted, signifying a new beginning.

John faced a tough decision. He pondered whether marrying a prince much older than him was worth sacrificing his pride and happiness.
