John Potter, a former dock worker, shared his experiences with his son, Tommy, about the building of the Eddystone lighthouse near Plymouth. John's wife, Martha, though initially skeptical, was supportive. The Eddystone, a critical structure for sailors, was once thought impossible to build due to its location on a treacherous reef. Henry Winstanley, an eccentric gentleman, took on the challenge in 1696. Despite his quirky inventions, like chairs that held people and phantom machines, Winstanley's lighthouse, resembling a Chinese pagoda, proved his engineering prowess. Enduring six years of perilous work, he defied odds and completed the lighthouse, setting a remarkable example of courage and determination. John, inspired by the project, hoped his son would follow in his footsteps as an engineer.|"['1.

Tommy's father was determined to provide his son with a good education to prevent any future regrets. He shared the story of John Rudyerd, who went from being a runaway boy to a successful silk-mercer in London. Mr. Rudyerd's engineering talent shone through when he built a remarkable lighthouse on Eddystone Rock, despite not being a professional engineer. The Trinity House corporation had granted Captain Lovet the right to build the lighthouse, and he chose Mr. Rudyerd for the task. The construction began in July 1706, with challenges posed by the rock's small and sloping surface. Despite stormy weather and mishaps, Mr. Rudyerd and his team persevered, cutting the rock into terraces to ensure a secure foundation for the lighthouse.|"[""1.

Mr. Dorkin secured the boat to a ring-bolt on a rock as his team began unloading tools. They worked around a tall column rising from the base, appearing sturdy against fierce weather. Mr. Rudyerd oversaw the crane setup to move stones for the building. The foundation had terraces, with holes drilled into the rock for iron hold-fasts. Massive timbers were laid across steps to create a solid base. Hold-fasts and cramps secured the timbers to the rock. Stones were stacked above to counter water pressure. The lighthouse had a central pole, with a door and stairwell built in. The first room, a store-room, sat thirty-three feet above the rock. The construction aimed to withstand harsh conditions and secure the structure against natural forces.|"[""Question 1: What was Mr. Dorkin's role in the construction project?\nA) Operating the crane\nB) Securing the boat\nC) Drilling holes into the rock\nD) Laying timbers across steps\nE) Stacking stones above"", 'Question 2: What was Mr. Rudyerd overseeing during the construction?\nA) Laying timbers across steps\nB) Securing the boat\nC) Drilling holes into the rock\nD) Operating the crane\nE) Stacking stones above', 'Question 3: What were the holes drilled into the rock for?\nA) Securing the boat\nB) Operating the crane\nC) Holding the timbers in place\nD) Stacking stones above\nE) Building a store-room', 'Question 4: Where was the first room in the lighthouse located?\nA) Above the rock\nB) Near the tall column\nC) At the base of the rock\nD) In the stairwell\nE) Thirty-three feet above the rock', 'Question 5: What was the purpose of the hold-fasts and cramps?\nA) Operating the crane\nB) Securing the boat\nC) Holding the timbers in place\nD) Stacking stones above\nE) Creating a store-room', 'Question 6: What was the main goal of the construction project described in the passage?\nA) To build a store-room\nB) To operate the crane\nC) To secure the boat\nD) To withstand harsh conditions\nE) To stack stones above']"|['B) Securing the boat', 'D) Operating the crane', 'C) Holding the timbers in place', 'E) Thirty-three feet above the rock', 'C) Holding the timbers in place', 'D) To withstand harsh conditions']
"The top part of the lighthouse column, which housed its four rooms, was not as sturdy as the lower section. It was mainly made of timber uprights that enclosed the building from top to bottom. These uprights, seventy-one in total, were thick beams, about a foot wide and nine inches thick at the base, tapering towards the top. They were sealed like a ship's seams, giving the lighthouse the look of a fluted column. The upper part of the column, where the lantern sat, rose to about sixty-three feet above the highest part of the rock. The outside timbers were not yet in place, with work only reaching the point above the entrance and the ""well-hole."" As Mr. Rudyerd prepared to leave, he instructed his assistant engineer, Mr. Franks, to keep the men working as long as possible. The approaching French schooner caused some concern, but the men continued their work diligently. Teddy Maroon and his comrades prepared for a possible confrontation with the approaching boats, guided by Mr. Franks's instructions on how to defend the rock. The tension rose as the boats drew nearer, but the men stood ready behind the lighthouse, ready to protect their work."|['1.

The commander issued an order, and the French soldiers aimed their muskets, causing the Englishmen to retreat to their hideout, giggling like mischievous schoolboys. Teddy Maroon, known for his inventive mind, rushed to his spot at the windlass with a plan to drop a heavy stone into the approaching boat to breach its hull. However, a sudden wave capsized the boat, forcing its crew to swim towards the rock. Amid the chaos, Teddy attempted to strike a Frenchman with a stone but missed, then joined the scuffle. As the conflict escalated, Teddy bravely tackled the French officer, preventing an attack on his comrade. Eventually, overwhelmed by the French forces, the English builders of the lighthouse were captured and taken aboard a French privateer. Teddy, gazing back at the disappearing English cliffs, lamented his uncertain future, while the Irishman among the French captors revealed his mixed heritage.|['1.

A daring rescue took place at the Eddystone Rock lighthouse during a devastating fire. Teddy Maroon and his brave crewmates struggled to contain the flames as the lighthouse blazed. The intense heat and smoke forced them to seek refuge in a cavern under the ladder. Meanwhile, Mr. Thomas Potter and a team of fishermen arrived in a boat to rescue the stranded keepers. Despite the dangerous conditions, they managed to save the keepers by anchoring the boat and using a rope to pull them to safety.

In the year 1755, tragedy struck the Eddystone Rock lighthouse when Henry Hall accidentally swallowed melted lead and passed away after twelve days. Despite efforts to save the lighthouse, the fire raged on due to calm weather and strong winds. Admiral West dispatched a sloop with a fire-engine, but the violent surf prevented them from landing. The fire continued to consume the lighthouse until it collapsed after four days and nights. This marked the end of the second lighthouse on Eddystone Rock, leaving ships vulnerable to its treacherous reefs. However, the story of a new lighthouse began with Teddy Maroon in 1756, showing a quick response to rebuild after the tragedy. Teddy visited old friends, John and Martha Potter, setting the stage for the next chapter in the Eddystone lighthouse saga.|"['1.

The Irishman and his crewmates were impressed to fight for their country but were quickly sent back. The foreman, Richardson, decided to take a boat ashore due to bad weather, leaving Teddy in charge of the _Buss_. A storm kept them stranded for a week. Teddy decided it was best to go ashore due to the weather. They rowed back in a makeshift boat. The relief boat managed to reach them later. Smeaton closed operations for the season. The _Buss_ sailed into Plymouth low on provisions. A storm hit, forcing them to cast off and navigate without proper equipment. They narrowly avoided disaster with the help of skilled crew members.

"This was a significant setback for the workers, forcing them to retreat to the boat, where they had to wait idly until a replacement stone was brought. Once the stone was replaced, they resumed work diligently and completed the second floor on July 21st within seven days. However, when they tried to install the entry and store-room doors, they realized they had forgotten the block-tin needed for the door hooks. Despite this setback, Mr. Smeaton came up with a solution. He melted down the boat's ""plate"" and mixed it with lead to create the necessary material for the hooks. The doors were then successfully hung, sturdy and iron-plated to withstand the ocean's forces.
