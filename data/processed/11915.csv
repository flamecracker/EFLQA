"""This is the greatest joke that ever was!"" exclaimed Unc' Billy. ""Soon, nobody in the Green Meadows or the Green Forest will talk to anyone except me. You've surely mastered all your old tricks."" 

""Yes,"" replied a voice unfamiliar to Bobby Coon, likely from down South like Unc' Billy Possum and Ol' Mistah Buzzard. ""I've got my old tricks and some new ones. It's easy to fool your new friends, they've never been tricked this way before. Shouldn't we stop soon? I don't want to be seen in daylight. If I'm caught, no one will want anything to do with me.""

""Don't worry, we'll keep it up a bit longer. You're great at mimicking voices. I'm surprised Ol' Mistah Buzzard hasn't noticed you,"" said Unc' Billy.

Listening intently, Bobby chuckled to himself as they left. He had been waiting under the tall dead tree where Mistah Buzzard perches.

Ol' Mistah Buzzard chuckled in agreement as he recognized the troublemaker, Mistah Mockah the Mocking-bird.
